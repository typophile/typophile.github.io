  body: "Yes, this is more complicated than it initially sounds. For what it's worth,
    I'm not sure what system fonts are really necessary for Windows XP to function
    reliably either. Personally, I keep /System/Library/Fonts/ intact, even though
    Apple has said in the past that some of them aren't \"necessary\". If you have
    a Classic System Folder, then keep Charcoal, Chicago, Geneva, and Monaco in /System
    Folder/Fonts/. \r\n\r\nI've also tested the suggestions within this document without
    trouble.\r\nhttp://dl.extensis.com/downloads/SC/EN/P/Fonts_Best_Practices_in_OSX.pdf\r\n\r\nIn
    my experience, removing all Asian language support can create a situation where
    the 10.4 Finder may crash when it is asked to display Asian glyphs. The amusing
    thing is that the Asian font names themselves use these glyphs, so it can be a
    trick to put them back. I don't keep anything in /Library/Fonts/ or /Users/(your
    username)/Library/Fonts/. Although, sometimes people like to keep common MS fonts
    like Arial and Verdana active at all times because they are commonly specified
    in webpages. If they aren't available, webpages will fall back to another font.\r\n\r\nThere
    should probably be a wiki article on this..."

  body: "Anything that the system itself <em>requires</em> to operate will be found
    in \"/System/Library/Fonts\" or elsewhere in the \"/System\" folder.  Mac OS X
    reorganized things and created the \"/Library\" folder precisely so that you would
    <em>leave the \"/System\" folder alone</em>.  Anything you remove from \"/System\"
    is simply a request for your machine to give you lots of hard-to-track-down trouble,
    period.\r\n\r\n(Yes, I realize 400 people may respond with \"but I removed X and
    nothing bad happened.\"  I don't care - they're wrong.  The \"/System\" folder
    is for Mac OS X itself.  That's why \"root\" owns all of it.  Leave it alone.)\r\n\r\nAnything
    in your personal fonts folder (\"~/Library/Fonts\") is discretionary, as is, <em>technically</em>,
    anything in \"/Library/Fonts\" (the machine-wide configurable fonts folder).  However,
    applications that require their own fonts are supposed to install them in one
    of those two places (usually \"/Library/Fonts\"), and if those fonts are missing,
    those programs may not work properly or at all.  Tax preparation and music notation
    programs may fail completely if their special fonts are not available; suites
    like Microsoft Office may try to \"reinstall\" Microsoft fonts if they're missing.\r\n\r\nGo
    to your nearby Apple store, find a display system that is obviously little more
    than an out-of-the-box machine with demo software, take screen captures of \"/Library/Fonts\"
    and \"~/Library/Fonts\", and E-mail them to yourself.  You should leave those
    fonts in place; use your font manager (or Font Book, if nothing else) to disable
    them if you don't want them cluttering up menus. Just keep in mind that some applications
    may require more.\r\n\r\nThe suggestion about the four basic fonts for the Mac
    OS 9 system folder is correct.  If you remove outlines from that folder, you must
    at least keep bitmaps for Charcoal 12, Geneva 9, Geneva 12, Monaco 9, and Chicago
    12 available to the system or it will not function.  (If your Mac is an older
    one that can boot into Mac OS 9, it may not even boot if the latter four bitmap
    fonts are not available.)\r\n\r\n"

  body: "<cite>Anything you remove from \u201C/System\u201D is simply a request for
    your machine to give you lots of hard-to-track-down trouble, period.\r\n\r\nI
    agree. I think the most common way to run into trouble is if you have your own
    Postscript family of Helvetica, which obviously has many more variations than
    Helvetica.dfont. It could be that it is activated in a font manager which can
    override system fonts, or it could simply be that it is earlier in the font path,
    for example, in ~/Library/Fonts/. The effect can be the same in terms of application
    functionality. An application that uses Helvetica (and many do)  will be using
    the Postscript version, which may not function as expected. \r\n\r\nUsually, this
    isn't a problem, but I think that's what \"hard-to-track-down\" problems are all
    about. In a way, it is unfortunate that applications like Safari, iChat and Mail
    make use of Helvetica for display purposes, when users may have perfectly valid
    reasons for using their own versions. For example, people commonly have older
    documents that were created with Postscript versions of Helvetica. \r\n\r\nIt
    is interesting to think of this in light of the Segoe/Frutiger controversy. Apple
    could have avoided this situation by somehow renaming their version of Helvetica,
    to say AppleHelvetica. Perhaps they couldn't because of licensing issues...\r\n\r\n"

    \r\n\r\nI agree with you. I find it annoying that all of the fonts must show up
    in all the applications I use. Don't delete them, deactivate them. I'd highly
    suggest using Linotype's Font Exporer for this. I created a set of the approved
    fonts that I can deactivate and haven't had any problems. I've also noticed apps
    like Pages and Keynote also install fonts into the system. Again, I create a set
    specifically for those fonts so I can deactivate them and activate them only when
    needed.\r\n\r\n"

    in the \"/System\" folder belong to the OS itself, not to you. Remove them at
    your peril. If something breaks after your remove anything from \"/System\", even
    a font, no one will cry for you.</em>\r\n\r\nOff the top of my head, I know that
    <a href=\"http://docs.info.apple.com/article.html?artnum=300501\">iChat will fail
    if Helvetica is removed or disabled</a>. So will <a href=\"http://docs.info.apple.com/article.html?artnum=25726\">Address
    Book</a>. Terminal gives you a <a href=\"http://docs.info.apple.com/article.html?artnum=25730\">tiny,
    unusable window</a> if you disable Monaco. Version 1.0 of iCal <a href=\"http://docs.info.apple.com/article.html?artnum=61734\">crashes</a>
    if you try to launch it without Helvetica Neue enabled, and that's just in \"/Library/Fonts\",
    not \"/System\".\r\n\r\nFor better or worse, some applications require their fonts;
    disable them at your own peril. Disable the <em>system's</em> fonts at the peril
    of every application.  Feaverish posted the <a href=\"http://docs.info.apple.com/article.html?artnum=301332\">link</a>
    to the list of fonts that Apple says you should not disable in Mac OS X 10.4,
    and it, in turn contains a <a href=\"http://docs.info.apple.com/article.html?artnum=25710\">link</a>
    to the same list for 10.3.\r\n\r\nBut Apple points out that there's an even simpler
    test: Font Book will not let you disable any font that the system deems as required.
    \ So, no matter what font manager you're using, if you have any questions, try
    disabling the font in Font Book.  If you can't, then removing it some other way
    is a bad idea, and you're on your own.\r\n\r\n(Honest to God, tinkering with the
    \"/System\" folder is such a bad idea.  It's like opening the hood of a car and
    saying, \"Hmm, how many of these parts can I remove and still think everything
    will work correctly?\")\r\n"
