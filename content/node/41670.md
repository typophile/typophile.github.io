  body: Agreed. I told my wife that ambulances had to be rolling in New York from
    all of the heart attacks being caused by the game. I was scared I was going to
    have cardiac arrest and I'm a Green Bay fan.

  body: I guess they must have had someone watching Chris Collingsworth on "Inside
    the NFL", because they pretty well covered the bases on his "How to Beat the Patriots"
    segment. A great game!
