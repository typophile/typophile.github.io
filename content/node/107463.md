  \"roule galette\".\r\n\r\nCould you help me to identify the 2 fonts :\r\n- for \"les
  albums du p\xE8re Castor\" and \"roule galette\"\r\n- fo the text behind \"Et la
  vielle pose la galette....\"\r\n\r\nOr 2 fonts close !\r\n\r\nMany thanks !"

  body: I'm afraid the one for "roule galette" is hand-lettered, the 3 /e are all
    different.

  body: "You're welcome.\r\nCan't get quite as close for \"les allums du p\xE8re Castor.\"
    \r\nDon't know the date of your book, but if it was after 1948 the artist might
    have been familiar with Alessandro Butti's _Rondine_ for Nebiolo. Digitized by
    Rebecca Alaccari for Canada Type as _Bella Donna_\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/canadatype/bella-donna/\r\nDon\r\n"
