  from Indesign. Is there any reason to not make the kerning adjustments to the page,
  in Indesign, and then just implement the same values in Fontlab so that I don\u2019t
  have to generate as many test fonts?"

    InDesign uses). Otherwise you'll have to do some conversion.\r\n\r\nT"

  body: "A see a reason not to.\r\n\r\nI mean, why do the kerning two times?\r\n\r\nWhy
    not just open up your words in FontLab and kern directly there? You can prepare
    text files and load them into Metrics window.\r\n\r\nThen if you would like to
    see how it looks in InDesign, have the document ready and just update the font
    you are generating.\r\n\r\nI usually generate all test-fonts directly to the Adobe>Fonts
    folder for immidiate updates in InDesign. Works very handy."

  body: "Twice? Just <a href=\"http://www.kltf.de/downloads/ATypI2007-CrossingBorders-kltf.pdf\">export</a>
    kerning from the ID document, for import into the font. (That could handle UPM
    conversion too.)\r\n\r\nKerning in ID is more comfortable than kerning in the
    FLS Metrics panel. Just my opinion.\r\nBut better leave the test font unhinted.
    Hinting may interfere with glyph positioning on the screen, which means that what
    you see is not what you get."

  body: I find it easier to kern things like ligatures and contextual alts in ID,
    or at least to spot the obvious errors and miscalculations. I still haven't found
    the best way to do that in FL.

  body: "As to the export/import scripts, I made them for my own use -- they identify
    glyphs by GID which has awquard side-effects like: don't apply features in ID.
    If I have some time later this year I'll write a new ID script for reading out
    ID kerning which should also consider features applied. But maybe others have
    done this already? I'd appreciate it.\r\n\r\nIndeed Metrics Machine currently
    looks like the best interface for manual kerning since it also helps with secondary
    things like producing kerning strings, creating classes and copying kerning values
    from glyph sets to other glyph sets (including adjusting values). I enjoyed the
    RoboThon presentation a lot."

  body: I have a script (javascript) to run in Indesign. It makes an afm file from
    the manual kerning. This can be imported in FontLab. I will put it on my page
    soon.
