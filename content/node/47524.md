  body: "Hi Kilment, I like the typeface very unique! it has a similar feel to [[http://subtype.org/cloud/|Cloud]]
    a contemporary typeface that I think you might like, I think yours would be pushing
    it to a new stage! I'm no expert but the only problem I can see is how each individual
    letter would interact with the next!\r\n\r\nOh yeah where does the photo come
    from? It's deadly!"

  body: "I would assume you would have to create a style that would use a strict baseline
    as well as a \"swash\" style that violates the baseline.  Do you think that having
    the characters too horizontally symetical like the capital K would cause it to
    loose it's flare?\r\n\r\ndaniel"
