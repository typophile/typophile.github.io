    a logo - a shame ;)\r\n\r\nbtw. Wir fahren nach Berlin :)"

    pictures.. 2, 4, and 11 are useless. #10 Would look good for your under 5 yr olds...Bah
    #3 is the only half decent one but the composition looks too large to be used
    well.'

    when no-one's watching.\r\n\r\nIs it wrong that I actually think Owen Hargreaves
    is our best player at the moment?\r\n\r\nAlso, can't help thinking Spiekermann's
    right on the money with those comments. Their mascot makes less sense than the
    2002 mascot/s - if that's possible!"

  body: "Tim - Hmmm... I think one (of the hundreds) of reasons that we've been mediocre
    (at best) is that we're missing Neville, he understands and links up really well
    with Beckham, is a solid defender (not so prone to mistakes as Rio), and has the
    longest throw-in range I've seen. Plus Hargreaves can then play in central midfield
    where he plays for Bayern, he's playing out of position at right back (and put
    Carrick back on the bench).\r\n\r\nRight, got that off my chest, I'm off for a
    spot of Robot Dancing!\r\n\r\nSi\r\n\r\nP.S. Sorry it's all got a bit off-topic,
    but World Cups are only once every 4 years (as I keep telling my 'world cup widow'
    fianc\xE9e!), my next post will be design-related, I promise!"

    all designed AFTER the official logo was announced, as a protest. So actually,
    Germany never could have really had these logos, at least in one sense\u2026 they
    were never options that were on the table."

  body: frankly, most of those are far worse than what they are using. the only one
    that comes remotely close to a level where it could actually have worked is the
    ninth design, though i can't really understand what they mean by the splatter.

  body: I like the logo they chose. Its not for design reasons but world political
    reasons. It makes world cup look like fun for the fans and not like American Football
    (War). In a world where fans can go crazy (English hooligans) and the potential
    for terriorism a whimisical logo isn't a bad idea.

  body: I agree with Dan Weaver too. Probably it's easier for the public to register
    a cliched 'smiley face' than some ink splatters. Furthermore spleatters might
    be associated with violence & blood spilling! But I like option 7#.
