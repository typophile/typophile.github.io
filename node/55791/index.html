		<div class="commentbody">A few quick comments:
1) That uppercase bold sans speaks pretty dam loud, but then it takes a long time to read. Maybe consider a mixed-case setting?
2) The color scheme says France to me, not Italy. I'd change the blue to green. If you need the blue for CI reasons, I wouldn't use it on the word "Italy".
3) The colosseum in the corner, while I like its graphical treatment, looks a bit like an excuse to squoosh in an image after all. You might try making it more prominent and exploring ways the type can interact with the image.
4) On the detail level, there's some kerning to work out ("AIRW A YS").</div>

Try something a little less primary and a bit more sophisticated.

I chose caps because in lowercase it seems to feel off, ill post it lowercase when i get back home.

		<div class="commentbody">Maybe choose a bit more of an airy color scheme? Something that suggests air-travel and freedom. Light blues. Maybe some dark blues, suggesting ocean. And if you pair it with a nice, clean sans-serif - upper and lower case as you want people to read it and not feel they were yelled at - you may be able to convince people that these flights are economical which may be a key selling point in these economic times. Maybe also throw in a flat, silhouette illustration of something unique and easily recognizable to the destination being served - but be careful that the illustration item is not too cliché (I'm specifically thinking of kangaroos).</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I think before thinking about gradients and color, you should sort out your typography. I still agree with bemerx that "you want people to read it and not feel they were yelled at", which was also what I was trying to get at in my first reply to this. 
That said, your most recent mixed-case variation yells less, but looks a bit like you haven't spent a lot of time playing with different typefaces, font sizes, arrangements, with the leading and the line lengths, and the placement of the illustration (which might also benefit from a more refined treatment). 
You've got so many variables at your disposal &ndash; already in the "purely graphical" realm, i.e. before you reach color. Play with them! :-)</div>

Do the line-breaks make sense to you? 

Also, ask yourself where this should be on the classy vs. cheap axis. I know it's an ad for cheap flights, but it's still BA, not EasyJet… Defining this should help in the font selection process (and a lot of other decisions actually).</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Well the last image is the best yet but Nina's suggestions are spot-on. Think about what you're communicating and think of the "tone" and "feeling" that you want to communicate. Play with your typefaces and find a family (or two) that help capture that. Then use 1 or 2 fonts from those families in such a way that you capture that feeling while balancing it with the layout. 

Design is about problem solving with multiple variables all which need to be balanced successfully. It's challenging yet very fulfilling. Advertising is design but with a focus on wish fulfilling. What's the wish? How will BA fulfill it? And I think it's less about "cheap flights" and more about "good value and excellent service".

You might want to check out ads in say, National Geographic or in some traveling magazine, and see how other designers solve similar problems. Look at the type that they use and see if it helps invoke feelings appropriate to the message.

And finally, don't get frustrated. Stop and take a break by doing something completely unrelated to this project (or even design in general). Then come back to it later.</div>

You want someone to be able to read it quickly and with ease. I think the previous version does that more effectively. But it feels crammed - there isn't enough space around it. You want it the sentence to be comfortable in there. You wouldn't have to make too much room, it's just way too close to the edge as is.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">As it stands:
1. Move the second "with" back down to the bottom line. 
2. You don't need a comma at the end of a line.

Possibilities:
Maybe call more attention to "EXPLORE AMERICA" or "EXPLORE ITALY" and have some of the wording above and below. It would read better "there has never been a better time to EXPLORE AMERICA with huge discounts from British Airways" or "With huge discounts from British Airways, there has never been a better time to EXPLORE AMERICA". 

I like your previous left justified approach, unless this is going on a wine bottle. </div>

Now that I look at it again, I'm not sure the "British Airways" is needed in the above text when you have the BA logo at the bottom. </div>

My one and only comment is that nothing in that poster would look good italicized, as evidenced by one of the mockups you provided earlier.

Also, utilizing color schemes that are representative of the target Country's flag would be a nice touch.

		<div class="commentbody">Ok, I didn't comment after my last one cause I was getting confused..but this is what I ment ^^ 
I really liked the first one you posted for Italy, it would need some work, but I was thinking that each place would have a different poster...But if you are sticking with the same design for different places...a) it is getting quite plain. b) i would actually try something a little different for each..
I mean, Italy is a lot different then New York, you could give each poster a certain feel about it. 
I sound confusing don't I?
Ok. I would probably use the first idea for Italy..using the Italian colors...which even the color blind people would understand, becuase it is the color of their flag. And for somewhere like America, I would use ... http://typophile.com/files/heroes_3505.jpg 

Sorry if this makes little or no sense ... hahaha I feel like I am confusing myself now... but hopefully I said everything right. </div>

		<div class="commentbody">I like where you started with the very first poster. While it's not perfect, it has more interest than the watered down versions.

While the all caps does look like yelling, perhaps de-emphasizing some of the less important words would make it more readable. 

with our
HUGE DISCOUNTS
there has never been a
better TIME TO
EXPLORE ITALY
with BRITISH AIRWAYS

...or something like that. Needs work, but the idea is get the consumer to see a more direct message right away.

Also, I like the graphic of the colusseum and the opera house. It has a nice negative/positive space feel to it - it just needs to be worked into the design better.

hope that helps.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I think your typography has improved in the most recent post. 

All the copy doesn't need to be, and probably shouldn't be, the same size. 

You really need to make the colors you choose match the country on the poster (Italy-green/red, America-red/blue, etc.). 

I think the Colosseum and the Sydney Opera house silhouettes looked good, they just needed to be incorporated better with the type and color schemes. 

Try making "Explore Italy" the biggest type, add the Colosseum illo back in, put the supporting type in 1/2 or 1/3 the size of your "headline" and incorporate the green/white/red color scheme.</div>
