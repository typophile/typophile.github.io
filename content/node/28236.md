  body: "> elegant ... the top being slighty, to greatly smaller than the bottom.\r\n\r\nI
    agree, coupled with a sufficiently narrow width* (the two things being also related
    structurally, like in the \"B\"). But if the top is too small I think the glyph
    starts becoming less elegant (maybe because it becomes a caricature of an \"S\",
    and nobody wants to do the Waltz with a clown).\r\n\r\n* Narrowness/tallness being
    the prime attribute of \"elegance\" in my mind.\r\n\r\n> that was impossible,
    isn\u2019t it?\r\n\r\nI guess you mean the very small <cite>loopy</cite> top of
    the script \"s\". Maybe it can be possible if you loosened the topological requirements
    of what an \"s\" is, and put a strategic gap somewhere in the stroke of the loop?
    I'd have to flesh that out...\r\n\r\n> Weiss Initials look like the top is bigger
    than the bottom\r\n\r\nBut in the Weiss lc the top actually <cite>is</cite> larger,
    so I'd think the Titling probably has the same spirit (if not geometry) intentionally.\r\n\r\n--\r\n\r\nBTW,

  body: "On the top of the 'S' being smaller. Stanley Hess, in 'On the Modification
    of Letter Forms' says that as a general rule, any vertically divided letter tends
    to have the top half narrowed. \r\n\r\nThus the top half of the B and S are generally
    smaller, the top arm of the E shorter, the top arm of the a shorter, etc. I think
    the rule is more general. In furniture, the classic 'highboy' or 'chest on chest'
    of drawers has the top half narrowed. Otherwise the top looks 'overweighted'.
    Similarly often with buildings (not Bauhaus though). \r\n\r\nI suspect this optical
    effect is because the narrowed top in a physical object makes it more stabile.
    The roman letters, resting on a base line, we view to some extent as objects having
    weight. Perhaps with scripts, the 'marks on paper' aspect is more prominent and
    the illusion of an object with weight holds less. This might explain the reversal...
    \ \r\n\r\nOn the shape of the s curves, there is something complicated going on,
    which I don't understand, but we respond to the swan's neck etc as being 'right'
    and graceful.  \r\n\r\n   "

    historically before the advent of lowercase. But, if you excercise the issue visually,
    you can produce all caps with less difference between top and bottom that look
    better in that specific use, and normal caps with a difference tuned to the l.c.,
    i.e. a bigger difference than normal for a small x-ht, and a smaller difference
    for a big x-ht., and see that the best caps for all uses are somewhere in between
    those two versions. So, in effect, if you decide to compromise the S and s for
    low resolution, you are, in effect either incompetent, or led by someone of similar
    abilities, but you are in no way actually helping the user, much."
