		<div class="commentbody">Leslie Carbarga's other book, <i>The Logo, Font, and Lettering Bible,</i> (<a href="http://www.logofontandlettering.com/" target="_blank"><a href="http://www.logofontandlettering.com/">http://www.logofontandlettering.com/</a></a>) is a great intro about how to begin to draw and design letters and typefaces, and is less technically specific that <i>Learn FontLab Fast,</i> yet still offers some good tips. It is a fantastic book! <BR> <BR>In terms of advice, the only pieces that I can think of without hearing more about what you would like to do are these: <BR>1. Design (draw) entire words first, not single letters. Letters in a typeface don't exist in a vacuum, but rather in context with one another. <BR> <BR>2. Remember the negative spaces! The spaces inside the letters, and the spacing in between the letters is just as important as the letterforms themselves. Erik Spiekermann wrote that type designers don't design marks on a page, but rather the spaces around those marks (or something like that</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Rebecca, it probably won't surprise you that experimetal minimalism in type has been attempted by a number of people in the past. But that doesn't mean you shouldn't try your own hand it. In fact I would recommend that you specifically <i>avoid</i> looking at other past attempts at this! This is such an extreme thing that it's necessarily personal, and outside influences can stunt the critical early stage of the process. <BR> <BR>We could give more advice about specific &quot;tricks of the trade&quot; shall we say but it seems to me that's tangential right now. You're not planning on producing a mainstream text face, and trying to absorb too much of the craft too early might actually distract you from the whole point of your effort. I guess the one general thing I myself would recommend though is this: observe the alphabet, in all its incarnations, to try to get at its essence, and thereby the essence of its elements - remembering that the letters are only really themselves in the context of the whole system. <BR> <BR>So maybe do your own thing, in private, but then do please show us what you got! <BR> <BR>hhp</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I dont mean to hi-jack this thread: <BR> <BR>I have yet to start designing my own face as I am also new to type design, but I am starting to analyze letterforms as much as I can to get a good idea and figuring out how the strokes and such are designed and what style of letters I like most (like double bowl g and two story a') but soon enough I will eventually start my own. However one thing I know I need to work on and I know good type design execution relies on it, being able to master beziars curves. <BR> <BR>I have heard of some people taking existing typefaces and re drawing them, for instance I think I read on here somewhere that someone started out as a way to get practice was re drawing Gill Sans.
