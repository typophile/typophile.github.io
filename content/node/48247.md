  site offers two versions called:\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><a href=\"http://www.linotype.com/13723/itchighlanderbolditalic-font.html\">ITC
  Highlander\xAE Bold Italic</a></li>\r\n<li><a href=\"http://www.linotype.com/187757/itchighlanderbyitcbolditalic-font.html\">ITC
  Highlander\xAE by ITC Bold Italic</a></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\nI've been trying to understand
  the difference. I can't see any by just looking at the Linotype web site (PDF samples,
  create samples). But in the Linotype FontExplorer application, the fonts look distinct,
  as shown below.\r\n\r\nAny ideas what's going on?\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/highlander_vs_highlander_5633.png]"

  body: "Yes, big differences between the fonts as shown in the FontExplorer screenshot.\r\n\r\nBut
    on Linotype's web site (I provided links above) I can't see the differences. Both
    fonts look like the \"by ITC\" version in FontExplorer. I'm not sure what to trust."

  body: The second one seems to have better hinting. I don't think the jumpiness in
    the first one is intentional or part of the design.

  body: "This 'Q' is so different, when you have eyes so sensitive like me to nuances
    of types it gives me sharp pain in the eye. Agh! As is also lowercase 'o' and
    small serifs of feet of 'h', 'm', 'n', and 't'. Overall font ITC Highlander\xAE
    by ITC Bold Italic is squashed in vertical. Have you heard saying I am sharp like
    knife!"

  body: "Just to be clear: The dissimilarities between the two samples are most likely
    due to screen rendering, as affected by differences in hinting, not design differences.
    I would bet that if you output both versions on a high res device, the fonts would
    look virtually identical. \r\n\r\nHinting purposely distorts the letter shapes,
    usually to make the font appear more uniform at low resolution (squashed, unfortunately,
    in this particular case). But if it's done incorrectly, for instance if the alignment
    zones are set improperly, it can have the opposite effect and make the letter
    shapes appear more irregular than they actually are, which is what I think we
    are seeing in the top sample."

    This hinting at size show will not make such dramatic changes to this \"Q\". I
    pity you fool. Sharp"

  body: "Mark is right, the typefaces aren't different, it's the rasterizer. There
    are a number of different rasterizers used for type viewers. Look at some other
    typefaces you are familiar with, in various viewers, to see the different rasterizing
    styles. Some are very intelligent and some don't do a very good job. Look at the
    same products at a different website, for example. It may also have to do with
    the outline format; OT fonts can have PS or TT outlines. \r\n\r\nBut Mark, maybe
    you should take the bet, you could buy 3 coffees with that $9!"
