  some sort here in Seattle. I'm wanting to figure out if there are Seattle Typophiles
  I don't already know. Or for that matter that I know, but didn't realize lived in
  the Seattle area. Of course there's me, and Si. But I'm sure there must be more
  of you out there....\r\n\r\nNote: I would also welcome contact info for type geeks
  not on the list.\r\nOther typographic folks I know in the area include the rest
  of the Microsoft Typography team, a few typographic folks from Adobe Seattle, the
  gentlemen from Linguist's Software (international fonts), John D Berry (writer and
  typographer), Mamoun Sakkal (Arabic type designer), and Ole Sorenson (local designer
  and Meetup organizer). \r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\nT\r\n"

    wouldn't contribute anything that the rest of you don't already know.

    Mr Bogge, http://www.letterspace.com/ but is he still in town or in Italy? \r\n\r\nOf
    course there are lots of other type people and designers at the company that I

      John Berry, of those who are still (or again) in Seattle, I remember Andras
      Furesz (of Very Graphics, book dealer who was once one of the few sources of
      hard-to-get European type books) and Nick Nussbaum (now at Microsoft). There
      were others whose names I do not remember, but I bet John would know.\r\n\r\nJohn
      Cornicello is another ex-typesetter. Other Seattle type types (haven\u2019t
      heard from them in awhile, so don\u2019t know if they are still around) include
      Ben Bauermeister, typesetter Mike Arst, and Andy Taylor (Japan Pacific Publications)
