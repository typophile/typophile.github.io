body: "I've been asked to recreate a logo and I can't place the face...I know the
  \"script\" is Caflisch Script Web Pro and I thought the boldface was a Futura or
  Frutiger, but the G isn't consistent with Futura and the S and C isn't correct with
  Frutiger, but close. I can tell from the weight at the bottom of the U that it has
  been manually \"scrunched\" but need to nail the ID and no one else knows. So, I
  come to those more knowledgeable than I. Any help would be appreciated.\r\n\r\nrick\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Montgomery2_6209.jpg]"
