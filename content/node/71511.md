  a new blackletter type, called Germanica, based mainly on that of Fust and Sch\xF6ffer
  (c. 1457). The font includes a number of ligatures and scribal abbreviations. It\u2019s
  an Opentype font, and it can be downloaded (free of charge) from www.iol.ie/~sob/clonna.html.\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Ah! My mistake.\r\n\r\nThe \u201Cinverted breve\u201D dots on i and j are
    those of Fust and Sch\xF6ffer, which I was imitating. They were also quite conventional,
    if I\u2019m not mistaken, though of course there were other forms (including the
    one that resembles an acute accent). In this particular project, authenticity
    was my main aim, so I stuck fairly closely with F&S."

  body: "This is very nice and also it is very useful to have a textura with a good
    set of ligatures and abbreviations. The numerals look about a century out of place
    to me, and stylistically Roman rather than blackletter, though.\r\n\r\nThis discussion
    of the tittles inspired me to take a look for some scans of Fust & Sch\xF6ffer
    type, and it looks to me like the tittles and hyphens at least in their earlier
    works like the Mainz Psalter (and also in the 42-line Bible) were drawn in by
    hand at the rubrication stage. I hadn't realized that before. They may have changed
    this later; some of the \"acute accent\" tittles look like they might have been
    part of the type. Perhaps if it's true that punched matrices weren't developed
    until c. 1470, before that the tittles may have been considered too difficult
    to cast?"

  body: "The numerals are indeed different. Authentic usage with this type would have
    been roman numerals (lower case), but then I thought it might be preferable to
    have \u201Cnormal\u201D (Hindi-Arabic) numerals also. I found a very good sample
    of contemporary handwritten numerals, and I began to draw them; but when I printed
    them in conjunction with the blackletter I hated them and so I deleted them, and
    instead I just put in ordinary numerals, so that at least there would be something
    there.\r\n\r\nNow I\u2019m not so sure. I would hope that most people who would
    have a use for this font would not want numerals at all, or if they wanted super-authenticity
    they would use lower-case roman numerals. But it\u2019s quite a quandary. I can
    think of compelling reasons for and against every option!\r\n"

  body: "Good point about Roman numerals being the proper Fust & Sch\xF6ffer choice,
    but for the sake of having something in the Arabic numeral slots, what about numerals
    from one of their slightly later contemporaries of the 1470s or 1480s? There are
    good examples to choose from among other German printers. It would still be a
    mashup, but a much less jarring one.\r\n\r\n[[http://www.ndl.go.jp/incunabula/e/font/0479-t04.html]]\r\n[[http://www.ndl.go.jp/incunabula/e/font/0597-t04.html]]\r\n[[http://www.ndl.go.jp/incunabula/e/font/1002-t02.html]]"

  body: The Zainer numerals don't look like they were very well cut, at least to my
    eye, so if that's what's closest to your handwritten examples, I can understand
    why you weren't happy with them.

    these numerals, which are a slightly modernised and smoothed version of contemporary
    designs. I think they look pretty awful (especially in conjunction with the text),

  body: "They are a bit clunky. I think if you poke around a bit more among fifteenth-century
    designs you'll find nicer-looking numerals. Over the weekend I tried my hand at
    drawing a few based on some of Erhart Ratdolt's and found that the designs are
    better than the ink spread normally makes them look, but it's often quite hard
    to guess the exact shapes amidst the ink blobs.\r\n\r\nAnother thing that may
    be an issue here is choosing the proportions. Your lowercase is taken from the
    Mainz Psalter, I think? That type is very large - around 44pt, I'm guessing -
    and the letters are proportioned accordingly. The incunabula with Arabic numerals
    are generally printed with much smaller type, and of course 12pt type is proportioned
    very differently from 44pt type, so adjustments will be needed to make such numerals
    work with Mainz Psalter letters. In addition, your font is very small on the em,
    and your numerals will need to follow that. At the moment your numerals do not
    seem small enough on the em to fit with the letters. They should, in fact, be
    even smaller: Ratdolt's numerals seem to use a \"figure x-height\" that is around
    85% of the \"letter x-height\"."

    responding because I don\u2019t look here every day.)\r\n\r\nI\u2019ve redone
    the numerals, making them more rounded, and also narrower. (The height aligns
    with the lower case.) I also adjusted the width, especially of the 1, instead
    of forcing all numerals to be the same width, which is hardly a requirement of
    this design.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Numerals_4315.jpg]\r\nI\u2019m
    not sure that I\u2019ll do any more on this. I\u2019ve moved on to other things,
