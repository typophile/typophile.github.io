<div class="post-content e-content" itemprop=articleBody>Hello,
Here are some tests for my little company.
We mainly imports products (most of them from italy). We do not sell directly to the final customer.
As you can see, I'm not especially a master designer (far away from that, I'm web developer) but this is going to passionate me more everyday. So I certainly made evident big mistakes but I don't know them : every constructive critics are welcome !
So here is how I though:
- D L V letters can be the same character with 45° rotation if you delete the vertical bar from the 'D'.
- The 2.5D box made with these letters could represent the boxes we deal everyday with (not really inspired)
- The circle in the middle represent the company, which buy goods (vertical simple line) to supply its retailers (multiple dispersing lines)
- 1, 3 & 4 could represent an UP arrow, synonym of prosperity
The typo used is a classic Gill sans MS, at this stage I give priority to the logo itself.
Thanks in advance ;)

<div class=commentbody>Hi,
for a web developer your work looks pretty good. (Actually, I am web developer too!)
Maybe you are having too many thoughts about what the logo should represent. I think it's best to pick one of the ideas/bullet points above and then develop it further. At the moment, I like logo #1 the most. The other ones may not scale down well, due to the many thin white lines.
If you say, you are mostly selling Italian products you might also want to consider using a colour scheme that feels more Italian, e.g. terracotta or light brown.
Good luck!

<div class=commentbody>Thanx tintin for the comment.
I will consider your colour scheme idea, nice !
The main idea was the third bullet, so I maybe should try something else with that idea in mind. To be honest, I noticed the "UP arrow" thing when completed so it can be forgotten.
I got loslogos yesterday, I may find a revelation who knows :)

<div class=commentbody>Wow! I think it's awesome work! The only thing I'd change, in the first logo, make the inside of the box darker, rather than the left side of it. Maybe put one line to define the inner corner. But pretty good mate!</div>

<div class=commentbody>@TypoJunkie: Thanx, I didn't expected such comments on my work :) Tomorrow I'll give a try with browner colours and darker inside.
@Dan Weaver & others : Well the company imports mainly performance parts for 50cc/scooters/maxiscooters, motorcycle technical clothes, technical & leisure glasses.

<div class=commentbody>Yep,
Here is the today update.
So I rounded the corners with the special illustrator filter and tried variations on borders / tuscan colours / font(AvantGarde).
What do you think about that ?
I like the second "2", but the boss keeps on liking the split line idea (7).

<div class=commentbody>What's more italian than Ferrari Red? I see nothing wrong with the color (especially if it's related to speed/vehicles.) Red cars get pulled over most than any other color. Ducatti and Ferrari are both read. OK, enough about color.
Here's what I'd do :
[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Pic1_4478.jpg]
This way I think you get to keep the whole one line/three lines thing. Maybe play around with the white lines (thicker), so it works on small sizes and when printed on boxes.
About Gill Sans… not too sure. Maybe try an Italian typeface? One more dynamic?
That's my two cents.
Good luck!</div>

<div class=commentbody>I think TypoJunkie is right actually. Red may be a very "Italian" colour after all!
In fact I think your concept is so good that colour becomes a secondary issue here. Maybe you should carry on designing your logo in black and white and then add colour only at the very last stage. Sorry for confusing you in my first post :-)
My favourites are versions 1 and 3. Version 2 looks great too. Versions 4, 6 and 7 don't tell me anything. I can't see the letters D, L and V in there.
Good luck!

<div class=commentbody>TypoJunkie, you are not wrong. That red is quite dynamic and that's good for the company. The simple line instead of the confusing 3 lines is a good compromise too.
I just understood what you wanted to say by "inside of the box darker". In fact I don't see the cube as you do : for me it's a 3D cube standing on a peak. You seem to see it from the inside, right ?
By the way I have been accommodated to the last one (brown-yellow).
So now I'm facing a dilemma :
<ul>
<ol>background or two-colors letters without background</ol>
<ol>splitted "V" or not</ol>
</ul>
<a href="http://www.myfonts.com/browse/person/novarese/aldo/?page=3">Aldo Novarese</a> (italian font designer) has some interesting fonts but nothing that make me scream.
Here is a quick mock-up, no major changes.
Notice the bridge between to P & O : glasses & motorcycle related. Too much ?

<div class=commentbody>Don't play with the bridge ... that's too much. Typeface ... perhaps Eurostile extended? IMO it looks a little bit more Italian and reminds me to motorcyle.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/eurostile_extended_6518.jpg]</div>

<div class=commentbody>I think we just experienced a Q*Bert moment there!
I'd follow Nora's advice. Keep it simple. Although the bridge does reference to motorcycles, you now have too many ideas floating around. I'd lose the bridge and concentrate on the strong mark. You're almost there.

<div class=commentbody>Yes your are all right, "less is more". I went back to the third basic one.
I think too the work is almost done. I'm experiencing some other wide typos (e.g. Neuropol X) then I come back to you.
Thanks for the precious advices guys.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Hey,
Here is the last update. I had different critics about the typo :
1. eurostile & neuropol extended : "L" can be read as a "I"
2. microgramma : idem, weight too heavy
3. solaris : "V" can be read as a "U", I had to make the font a little bolder
What I think about that:
1. .. not sure, all letters are small case. But I'm not sure it's a good idea to mix 2 different fonts. Maybe play with letter-spacing, etc.
2. For me it's the more motorcycle related font of the three.
3. Not false, but there is something that I like in this font. "L" is readable.
I'm satisfied with all fonts but I needed to show it to non designer people, to hear what they see.
Your designer point of view interest me much. What do you think ?

<div class=commentbody>Hello, This logo is now official since augustus. I went with the second, with typography slightly modified (size, capital letters for DLV).
Hum. Here is what I just found on the web
[img:sites/default/files/old-images/joomla_logo_black_5396.jpg]

The guy was selling reproduction stickers for vintage motorcycles on eBay, just found it "by chance". I think he got the idea on this board because I didn't showed my work elsewhere. </div>

What would you do with a person like this? He took your design, changed colours and added pretty ugly type to it.
Do you have any email contact or anything to "remind" the guy he's a thief?
How did you come across it? Search? Or was it pure luck or something?
