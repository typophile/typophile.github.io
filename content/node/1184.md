body: Hi <BR> <BR>I&#39;ve been working on a logo for a charity event I am organising,
  Building Letters. <BR> <BR>The idea is to raise the cash to  build two orphanages
  in Africa by selling 1000 exclusive font CD&#39;s with designs by people like Neville
  Brody and Max Kisman. <BR> <BR>I want the logo to be good enough to stand next to
  these great designers,so...advice please <BR> <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/15580.gif"

  body: I like the concept. I think it would be much improved if you just made the
    &#39;l&#39;s regular weight. The suggestion of walls would still be there without
    disrupting the flow of reading. I would try a different font as well.

  body: I would consider both of the commentaries from Loren and Mike. Perhaps, rather
    than changing the color or weight of the &#34;L&#39;s&#34; you can just make sure
    that they are in the same style as the roof and foundation &#40;&#34;rough&#34;
    in your existing design&#41;. I apologize for not having the time to do even a
    quick search for you right now, but you might be able to find a font for the whole
    &#34;building letters&#34; title that would match &#40;i.e. same style&#41; the
    roof and foundation well. Good luck...I&#39;m anxious to see what you come up
    with. You have a good foundation &#40;no punn intended&#41; to start from. <BR>
    <BR>Aloha! <BR>Scott

  body: i agree.  it is a vast improvement.  but can the bottom line be moved up a
    little tiny bit?  or move the roof line up a little tiny bit.  the spacing between
    the red l&#39;s and the bottom and top red lines is a little off to me; uneven.  but
    i think it&#39;s great overall.  good work.

  body: Ahhh, yes! You&#39;ve definitely taken this to the next level. It may still
    need a little refinement &#40;i.e. Loren&#39;s comments&#41;, but you&#39;re heading
    in the right direction. <BR> <BR>An interesting observation is that the &#34;t&#39;s&#34;
    have a slant resembling a roof top. I&#39;m not sure if this is good &#40;perhaps
    another direction can be explored&#41; or bad &#40;it may be noticable to others
    and distracting&#41;. I don&#39;t know
