  body: "Looks similar to [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/comicraft/sign-language/|Sign
    Language]] from Comicraft, and also the [[http://www.houseind.com/fonts/signpainterfontkit/viewfonts|House
    Sign Painter collection]]'s House Brush and House Slant. This is definitely some
    sort of sign painter's font, even though none of those I mentioned is exactly
    the same, they are close.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

    absolutely no neccesity to raise your voice to get ahead of the pack. If people
    want to help, they will help. Have the decency to stay polite and the patience
    to wait. However 'urgent' your request may be. Thanks.\r\n\r\nAs for the typeface:
    I couldn't find an exact match, but [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/letraset/challenge-bold/plain/|Challenge]]
    is very close. There's tons of simular fonts about, also freefonts.\r\n\r\ngreetings
