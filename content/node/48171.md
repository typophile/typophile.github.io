body: "Hey all. I recently finished making a Blink 182 kinetic typography video based
  on the song \"Online Songs\". I believe this might appeal to a more adolescent audience
  and this site seems to have a rather more bohemian feel to it. Nonetheless, I hope
  a few of you out there will enjoy it:\r\n\r\n[[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0LIvrxf-R0|Blink
  182 Online Songs Typography]]\r\n\r\nI would appreciate some constructive criticism,
  but have in mind that this was my first typography video and I had to learn to use
  After Effects from scratch to do it. I am not an arts student nor professional.
  This was merely one hobbie which blew WAY out of proportion. I had to balance the
  time spent on this project with other college work. \r\n\r\nYou can grab a copy
  of the video in .MP4 format optimized for the ipod classic (for those \"on-the-go\"
  types) from [[http://www.filedropper.com/onlinesongs]]\r\n\r\nCheers!\r\nJerry"

    interesting. I'd put it up there with BoingBoing in terms of how well it keeps
    me glued to my screen. I'll probably frequent it just as much!\r\n\r\nJerry."
