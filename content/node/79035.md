  The book is basically pencil drawing collages interwoven with a narrative and various
  letters (see pictures below for examples) and I don't really know what font to pic
  for the text. I was thinking of a slightly geometric serif-font, something angular
  since that is also how I draw. \r\n\r\nAny suggestions would be very welcome, thank
  you.\r\n"

    might do well. A didone face, on the other hand, may somehow reflect the prominent
    role of black-and-white contrast in the pictures.\r\nAnyway, I would be *very*
    careful with trying out sketchy fonts, which may turn out  mocking the drawing
    rather than sensibly complementing it.\r\n\r\nNice drawings, b.t.w."

    the current featured face, Bullen, looks quite good with it.

    (per the designer) font with angularity on the inside of the letters. There is
    a downloadable PDF specimen and I think it might be right for a project like this.\r\nhttp://www.emilie-rigaud.com/index.php?/project/coline/"

    text, thanks for your suggestion.\r\n\r\nThanks for everyone's suggestions, I
    will give them a try."
