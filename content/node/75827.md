body: "Hi all,\r\nDoes anybody already saw this display bug in FontLab ?\r\nAll the
  texts you can type in FontLab like values or sample text in metrics window or somewhere
  else are not displayed in latin characters but in a kind of hebrew or something
  like that. A bit annoying to be precise !\r\nI already had this bug in iTunes, but
  this disapeared at the next update.\r\nI tried to reinstall FontLab totally but
  without succes.\r\nThanks by advance for the help.\r\n\r\nmr\r\n"
