  proportions of small caps might just be too much to be legiable, but Minion appears
  to have small caps in every weight.\r\n\r\nAny particular reason? I can't imagine
  it's got anything to do with the work involved, since I've seen this phenomenon
  in typefaces with otherwise massive, sprawling character sets."

  body: "There just aren't that many reasons to use small caps in bold (or italic,
    for that matter). Small caps aren't a simple reduction of cap size, so there is
    real development required, and every new glyph adds more time to the overall production
    effort (spacing, mastering, display). \r\n\r\nMost foundries believe that the
    most important glyph sets should be completed and released first, and if there
    is sufficient demand, the family can expand."

  body: I don't think it's so much the extra work as the fact that, traditionally,
    small caps were only included in the regular weight of a font. So, including them
    in the italic or bold styles simply doesn't have a lot of precedent. Personally,
    I don't see any reason not to include them, although they they don't get used
    much (yet).

  body: "I think the newer typefaces are more likely to include smallcaps in all the
    weights. Book faces dones in the last 5 years, mostly the OpenType fonts done
    in the past 4 years, are better candidates for full inclusion than older faces.\r\nThere
    is a good bit of work involved if you consider diacritics and kerning. The downside
    is that the time to market gets drawn out doing all the extra work and the profit
    difference is small.\r\nHere I sit doing smallcaps in bold, italic, and bold italic
    when I could be out on the town living the high life instead :-)\r\n\r\nChrisL"

  body: "I think it is the hard work. But Linotype used to cut them for a few fonts
    -- the comp shops always hoped customer didn't know about them -- they usually
    had to be inserted & distributed by hand; more hard work.\r\n\r\nActually, nowadays,
    with run-in citations as opposed to true footnotes, there is probably more of
    a need for them, for abbreviating titles.   "

  body: "The reason for setting something in small caps could also play a role in
    why only the regular/medium/book weight gets the treatment. It seems to me that
    Bringhurst has a bit to say about that, along the lines of Mark's comment about
    tradition. \r\n\r\nBefore italics were matched to roman, small caps were used
    for contrast in a text setting, right?"

  body: "Sometimes you like a typeface's roman weight, but aren't so hot on the italic.
    The small caps present a nice alternative for when emphasis is required. I often
    do this for the bibliography section of an academic article; the journal or book
    title is set in small caps instead of italics. For example, I always do this with
    Times, since I despise Times' italic weights.\r\n\r\nI can't think of much use
    for bolder weights of small caps other than the occasional titling application,
    and even then, I am more likely to use all-caps for titling.\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Why? Tradition.\r\nThe vast majority of classic typefaces (and especially
    [[family|families]] has been made for body text, often as in books.\r\nThis is
    related to <a href=\"http://www.typophile.com/node/38645\">this issue</a>, why
    certain faces don\u2019t have a bold and/or a bold italic.\r\n\r\nWhy don\u2019t
    Helvetica, AG etc. have small caps and osf? Because that would look totally out
    of place, in a historic sense. Same goes for those whimsical small caps in an
    already inherently odd extra bold garalde, and even the most traditional italic
    serif face, yet in regular weight, starts to scream \u2018pomo!\u2019 when set
    in small caps, imho.\r\n\r\nI don\u2019t say it\u2019s not nice to have them (i.e.
    black or italic sc) for <em>some </em> cases, but you don\u2019t need them very
    often, at least when you\u2019re doing rather traditional things like books or
    scientific publications."

  body: "I like to have a few faces around that carry italic smalls, even semibold
    italic smalls.\r\n\r\nEach year a couple of projects come along that require them,
    and I can start those projects knowing this need can be filled.\r\n\r\nMore of
    a trouble is the book that, in ms, seems not to need them, so is specified in
    a face that does not have them. Then at first page proofs, author or editor decides
    to make an edit that then requires italic smalls. Perhaps this is an addition
    that (had it been set all roman) would have used roman smalls, but because the
    entire addition is ital, requires maybe one word in italic smalls.\r\n\r\nFor
    most book faces in our repertoire, I find I can fiddle Minion or Miller italic
    smalls to get a fairly decent match. But it is a patch, and thus not fully satisfactory.\r\n\r\npowers"
