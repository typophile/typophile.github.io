  fonts, do you think the Gothics (News, Trade, ...) are \"pass\xE9\"? It's fascinating
  that even the corporate world is following the hype in an attempt to appear more
  accessible and humane, even when nothing in their culture changes. "

  body: "Faces like News Gothic and Franklin Gothic were basically the first sans-serif
    faces acceptable by modern standards. They are old-fashioned, about at a level
    with the geometric sans faces such as Kabel or Futura, or with Century Expanded.\r\n\r\nHowever,
    given the variety of sans-serif faces in use today, rather than the old monoculture
    of Univers and Helvetica, it may well be that they would now pass unnoticed in
    the shuffle and could potentially be due for a revival."

    you've just described about 85 per cent of marketing. Too many good creative professionals
    have to do this for a living."

  body: "I'm not sure that recent trends are responsible for the older Gothics becoming
    pass\xE9. I've been around for several decades now, and during that time they've
    never exactly been \"in.\"\r\n\r\nThose slightly awkward faces were long ago eclipsed
    by the more refined Univers, Frutigers and Helveticas of the world. The exception
    (at least for me) might be Franklin Gothic, which is still one of my <i>go-to</i>
    typefaces. Then again, who am I to say \u2014 I just recently started using Akzidenz-Grotesk
    on a few projects."

    so. It's a great font, Porsche still uses it in a clean and understated way for
    headlines. "
