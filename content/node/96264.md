  original is taken from some sort of military mapping tech. The closest matches I
  can find are pixel fonts, but I need something a bit smoother.\r\n\r\nThanks for
  your help.\r\n\r\nThanks\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/typeID_6147.jpg]"

    but maybe it's too wide for your needs.\r\nYou also could look for OCR fonts."
