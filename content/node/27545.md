  is anyone planning to tape this presentation? Would it violate anyone's copyrights
  to post it here as an MPG or MOV file?\r\n\r\nBill\r\n\r\nOn Friday, August 11th
  from 11:15 a.m. - 12:15 p.m., York will discuss font management in OS X by participating
  in a panel session titled \"Demystifying Font Management in OS X.\" The session
  will be moderated by well-known book designer and typographer Kent Lew; other panelists

  body: Hi Bill. Glad you're interested in the panel. We're looking at ways to tape
    the discussion. If it's possible, I'll do my best to publish it at TypeCon.com,
    Typographica, or elsewhere.

  body: "Hi guys:\r\n\r\nOh and while your at it, can someone please ask Apple if
    they are going to improve their OpenType implementation so that you can use all
    your \"layout features\" in any application. Not just Adobe and Quark products.
    \r\nIt seems these days that Microsoft is paying a whole lot more attention to
    typography that Apple. I think Apple needs to be aware that more and more designers
    are purchasing only OpenType-CFF collections these days and we ACTUALLY use smaller
    supporting applications. I just think the Apple AAT framework need to be more
    robust.\r\n\r\nMikey"

    more attention to typography that Apple</em>\r\n\r\nIn some ways, but Office still
    doesn't have much OT support yet."
