  body: 'Thank you. Glad you like Manticore; I don&#39;t anymore, but that&#39;s true
    of most of my typefaces from before 1998. I&#39;m probably going to retire them
    fairly soon, in large part because we don&#39;t want to support Type 1 fonts any
    longer but don&#39;t have time or much inclination to make OpenType versions of
    all our retail fonts. So that copy of Manticore may shortly be a rare item.  <BR>  <BR>Note
    that I only designed the digital version of Aeneas: it is based on lettering by
    the German calligrapher Werner Schneider. Werner and I have discussed making an
    OT version with an extended Cyrillic and Greek character set, but that&#39;s another
    project waiting for a few free weeks. I can&#39;t remember when I last had a few
    free weeks.'

  body: 'Jon, you could also pick up Ruari McLean&#39;s autobiography, which is the
    only other publication I&#39;ve ever seen set in Manticore. I was rather chuffed
    last year, though, to see Manticore Titling used on the dustjacket of a book by
    one of my favourite poets, Czeslaw Milosz. The biggest problem I find with the
    face, apart from some technical problems in the outlines and the hideously small
    counter of the lowercase &#60;I&#62;e&#60;/I&#62;, is the excessive weight in
    the bracketing of the serifs: I was going for the rugged blackness that you see
    in early printed books, but now I think I overdid it a bit. Ironically, while
    this feature was too heavy, I now think the overall stem weight was a touch too
    light.  <BR>  <BR>Back in 1997 &#40;probably the last time I had any free time
    for such things&#41; I started redrawing Manticore, but didn&#39;t get very far
    with it. Here are the original forms, on the left, contrasted with the revised
    forms on the right. Seriously, I doubt if I&#39;ll ever finish this. Perhaps it
    will be a nice project for my retirement.  <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/30/6514.gif"

    Opentype/Unicode. It&#39;s not such a recent and so widespread thing. I understand
    that for you, producing non-Latin and cutting-edge works in terms of technology
    also, Type1 may sould so old, but a huge amount of users and foundries will continue
    to use it. Personally I like the fact of having separate files for bitmaps, outlines
    and metric files. As I like having all in one with Opentype. I never liked so
    much Truetype for the additional points needed. I know they are way better for
    hinting, but not being into hinting &#40;for now at least&#41; I was pissed off
    when I needed to modify an existing truetype with the excess of points. Here,
    of course I&#39;m speaking just for Mac. It&#39;s clear that if you need multi-platform
    faces you are forced to truetype. But it&#39;s amazing there are so many people
    using PC Type1 fonts. As far as I know Type1 was never a real standard under Windows.I
    also understand the &#34;potential customer service nightmare Type1 might present
    as operating systems and applications stop supporting the format, but why Type
    1 represents a &#34;document encoding nightmare waiting to happen&#34;? Surely
    I&#39;m missing a lot here. ]'

    <BR>TT doesn&#39;t really need all the extra points Fog wlil show/generate - that&#39;s

    <BR> <BR>Let&#39;s say I want to use the full range of standard f-ligatures in
    a document. With my Type 1 fonts, I&#39;m getting the ligatures either from psuedo-standard
    Adobe expert set layout or from totally-non standard and widly diveregenbt hacked
    layouts used by different font foundries. Whichever layout I use, I am obliged
    to <i>change the text strings of the document</i> in order to display ligatures
    so that, for example the word &#39;office&#39; ends up being spelled &#39;oWce&#39;
    &#40;using the Adobe expert set layout&#41;. The document can no longer be spell-checked,
    sorted or published to the web; changing fonts will likely result in corruption
    even of the display. Effectively, I&#39;ve killed my document by typesetting it.
    <BR> <BR>In a couple of years, let&#39;s say the document is going to be revised,
    or even just looked at. In the meantime, my operating system has stopped supporting
    Type 1 fonts. That&#39;s okay though, because I&#39;ve updated all my favourite
    fonts to OpenType. I open the document and what do I get? &#39;oWce&#39; Every
    day users continue to employ Type 1 fonts is another day on which documents are
    broken and rendered unusable in the future. Simple documents without traditional
    quality typographic formatting will survive the transition because accurate semantic
    characters can be mapped between encodings. Documents with rich typographic formatting
    will not survive because, e.g. the ligature ffi has been encoded as the semantic
    character W.

    my fault, I did not know. Thank you! And, yes, I guessed you were referring to
    the very smart ligature and contextual alternates handling of Unicode/Opentype
    when you talked about the problems arising in the continued use of Type1. Anyway,
    this is a real problem as long as you&#39;re a custom typeface developer such
    as you with Tiro. If I buy a face from Emigre or ITC today, let&#39;s say, and
    it&#39;s a Type1, it will be my problem to buy Emigre and ITC Opentype versions
    of it as long as they will be released, paying for the upgrade. So, as long as
    we have only MrsEaves at Emigre and, I think, none at ITC, you are simply forced
    to stick to Type1. If the foundry decides it will drop a face and not upgrade
    it to Opentype I will necessary have to buy it in Type1. So I agree with you about
    the need to help things occur, but unfortunately you are unable to predict what
    foundries will do, and if you need a particular face now, you need to buy it in
    Type1 and maybe re-encode it in Opentype, if you are able to do so.]'
