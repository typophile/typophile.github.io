body: I&#39;m struggling with the amount of bullet points that are constantly in the
  texts I work with regularly. I personally despise bullet points, but I don&#39;t
  get to edit these texts. Any suggestions for formatting them to look their best?
  Currently, I have the bullet at the left margin edge, then a tab, with the rest
  of the text lining up to that tab &#40;most of the bulleted text I work with is
  multiple lines&#41;. There are no paragraph spaces between items, or between the
  list and the text. I haven&#39;t found any examples of bulleted text that I like,
  so I&#39;m not sure what else to try.

  body: IMO, bullets are usually about 30% too large in most  <BR>typefaces. If you&#39;re
    using Quark or InDesign you can set <BR>up a character style sheet to make them
    a smaller point  <BR>size. Just adjust the baseline to compensate. <BR> <BR>For
    alternate bullets try an underscore or a hyphen. They&#39;re <BR>more understated.
    <BR> <BR>Or question bullets entirely. People don&#39;t always need to  <BR>see
    a bullet to know they&#39;re reading a list. Achieve the same <BR>thing with line
    spacing.

    if at all.

    clean. It align with the rest of the text and create a better page layout &#40;at
    graphic design level&#41;. <BR> <BR>If necessary, you have also the middle point
    too. <BR> <BR>Each presentation, Adobe Type guys do, during ATypI, use a template
    or so for it and ALL their sentences star with this annoying bullet!  <BR> <BR>I
    really don&#39;t understand the function of this buuulllllet when you got them
    everwhere? <BR> <BR>--I have a question concerning the design of bullet: do you
    prefer a bullet who change when the weight of the typeface change or stay identical
    for all the family?'

    <BR> <BR>I think that&#39;s because the bullets are usually dimensioned proportionally
    to the typeface em-square &#40;iirc, most typefaces have a bullet which diameter=1/2em&#41;,
    and not to the typeface weight. <BR> <BR> <BR><i>&#62;I have a question concerning
    the design of bullet: do you prefer a bullet who change when the weight of the

    question. Most typefaces around have the same bullet for all weights. It seems
    a good solution, considering its conventional usage &#40;as marks for listed items&#41;.
    But I&#39;d like to listen to more experienced designers here too. <BR> <BR>'

  body: 'I really hate bullets and all they stand for: the inability to write coherent
    text, to express connection, or to organise a list into any order. I have a queasy
    suspicion that the very word &#34;bullet&#34; has coincidentally contributed to
    their grotesque popularity, with its connotations of deadly speed. A bullet point
    is not just a point: it is a killer, swift and sure and aimed at its target. <BR>
    <BR>I agree with those who suggest using either a midpoint or a reduced size of
    bullet. I would not succumb to the temptation to use some other symbol &#40;asterisks,
    or hyphens, or guillemets, or plus signs or whatever ...&#41; because each has
    its proper function, and appropriating symbols with common uses to do service
    in some other task causes momentary confusion. &#40;I suppose a pure ornament
    would not suffer from this, but it hardly solves the problem. Anyway, what has
    an ivy leaf got to do with anything: decorated bullets are worse.&#41; <BR> <BR>And
    I wouldn&#39;t dispense with the bullet altogether because I think the decision
    to use a bullet carries semantic weight for the writer: the writer wanted a &#34;set
    of bullet points&#34; &#40;that&#39;s how these people think&#41; not just a list,
    and if you give her/him a list you are in some sense altering the meaning of the
    text, subtly but perceptibly, in a way I think one normally shouldn&#39;t. At
    least, if you are going to do that you should go back to the writer and say &#34;These
    bullet points look bad, could we do ...&#34;'

  body: I get alot of text with bullets at work as well, and I&#39;ve become convinced
    that copywriter&#39;s facination with bullet points can be blamed entirely on
    PowerPoint. <BR>Generally, I find that removing bullets altogether is the best
    way to handle lists. They can be unsightly and clutter the text. Set a list the
    same way you&#39;d set the body, and add a little leading between points &#40;if
    the body is 10/12, then between points in the list, put a hard break of 14 or
    16&#41;. It&#39;s not great typography, but it&#39;s not great copy either.

  body: I am working on a long text right now &#40;that I should  <BR>have completed
    weeks ago!&#41; that has a number of very  <BR>necessary [originally bulleted]
    lists. I found that  <BR>aligning to the initial indent of the text provided  <BR>adequate
    emphasis without introducing an added  <BR>element. <BR> <BR>sometimes I find
    the need to use a white line between  <BR>list items, other times it&#39;s superfluous.
    but there are  <BR>occasions when a bullet helps to clarify. as others  <BR>mentioned,
    you simply have to make sure it&#39;s not too  <BR>heavy. some fonts work best
    using the midpoint, others  <BR>&#40;eg Myriad&#41; have well-proportioned bullets
    that need  <BR>little to no adjustment.

  body: I&#39;ll have to check Bringhurst&#39;s book again, for some reason I don&#39;t
    have it with me at work. Very poor form indeed. <BR> <BR>I think I&#39;m going
    to talk with my editor and see if we can just remove them entirely. I&#39;d much
    rather see a line space before and after a list to set it off from the text. Bullets
    are such a poor and ugly way to set off text.
