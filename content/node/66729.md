    simply call it \"a.smcp\" and substitute it in the small cap OT feature code?</cite>\r\n\r\nNo,
    don't do that. Lots of text winds up in PDF format. If you take text from a PDF,
    everything after the period drops out. So A.sc or A.smcp becomes \"A\". Equally,
    a.smcp or a.sc becomes \"a\".\r\n\r\nThere has been some discussion about using
    double periods; I believe there might be some issues -- though Adobe (again as
    I believe), drops everything after the first period. So one way would be to use
    A.sc and A.scalt. Easier to read would be A.sc and A.sc.alt, but there is the
    double period. You could also an underline to separate the alts. e.g., A.sc_alt,
    though that is the structure for a ligature.\r\n\r\nIn any case, you're going
    to have to write a feature or two, and I can't think of any reason why you can't
    substitute A.sc with A.scalt (done one way, as stylistic alternatives in either
    salt or as stylistic sets), or A.alt with A.scalt in the small cap feature --
    (or both, depending on how you write things)."

  body: "Yes, having more than one period feels dangerous!\r\n\r\nIt seems to be my
    preference (looking at my font) to have a single unit postfilx and to use underscore
    when compounding discriptions.\r\n\r\nso if I had two types of lowercase g:  [
    where   <code>' >' </code>  means 'becomes']\r\n<code>g  >  g.alt  </code>   to
    map to the alternative form\r\nand\r\n<code>g  >  g.sc</code>   to map to the
    smallcap form (this just changes the lowercase, but you can set up another OT
    class for Caps to point to the same small caps glyphs, controlled by grouping
    sets of glyphs in classes)\r\n\r\nThis is frowned upon by some and so I also am
    considering to use myself:\r\n\r\n<code>G  >  G.sc</code>\r\n\r\nYou would also
    need to add in your alternative form into your class but just map it to the same
    <code> g.sc</code>:\r\n[I have not done this yet so would need to be confirmed.]\r\n\r\n<code>g.alt
    \ >  g.sc</code>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLater you might want to do some alternative glyphs
    for Caps with dieresis...\r\n(The alternative is usually with the Caps version
    of A, U, O, W, so...\r\n\r\n<code>U  >  U.alt</code>\r\n\r\n<code>U.alt  >  U_alt.sc</code>
    \   (so I am keeping my single postfix:  <code>.sc </code> at the end)\r\n\r\n<code>u.alt
    </code>    shouldn't exist or isnt required under normal typographic circumstances.
    \r\n\r\nI think that the ligatures are pretty obvious ie <code>f_l_l</code> with
    underscores between single letters with no postfix so I see it as OK to use the
    underscore in also assigning compound postfixes.\r\n\r\nAnother point is to consider
    your source when digging around UNICODE and working out what to do and what to
    call stuff. Dont just look at 2 and have a fifty fifty chance on something, the
    more you dig around the better you will see the path.  =)\r\n\r\nFrom someone
    who used to put the period after eps! it helps me to have the postfix and class
    names to be named differently. This is my reson for sticking with .sc for the
    glyph and smcp for the class title (though like you my first attempt, I also wanted
    to name my glyphs <code>smcp</code>. .\r\n\r\nI think @Charles covered your question.\r\nbut
    be careful because what you suggested was wrong.\r\n\r\n<cite>So you're saying
    if I want to make an alternate for \"A.smcp\", I should simply call it \"a.smcp\"
    and substitute it in the small cap OT feature code?d</cite>\r\n\r\nEr, no.\r\n\r\nbecause
    what you are saying here is a substitution CAP(small cap) of a substitution lowercase(small
    cap). Code as I understand it will always start from the master glyph and map
    onto the substitute, in this case either an alternative glyph or small cap. I
    don't think substitution of a substitute is good practice. (This would need to
    be confirmed or denied by others).\r\n\r\nI hope this perspective helps."

  body: "Robby, \r\n\r\nThe glyph naming convention used in the upcoming Fontographer
    5 will be as follows: \r\n\r\nFor glyphs that are accessible through a certain
    OpenType Layout feature, use the same basename for source and target glyph, and
    as the suffix used for the target glyph, use the four-letter OpenType Layout feature
    tag. \r\n\r\nFor example, if you have a glyph that is the alternate of \"A\" accessible
    through the caps-to-small-caps feature (c2sc), use the glyphname \"A.c2sc\". If
    you have a glyph that is the alternate of \"a\" accessible through the small-caps
    feature (smcp), use the glyphname \"a.smcp\". So if you choose to create your
    fonts the Adobe way (i.e. provide two sets of small caps glyphs, one that map
    to uppercase letters and one that map to lowercase letters), use the glyphnames
    \"A.c2sc\" and \"a.smcp\". If you name your glyphs that way, Fontographer 5 will
    be able to generate the OpenType Layout features automatically for you. \r\n\r\nIf
    you want the same glyph to be used in two features at a time, you just concatenate
    the OpenType Layout feature tags directly. For example, if you name your glyph
    \"one.subssinf\" then Fontographer will generate mappings from \"one\" to that
    glyph in both the \"subs\" feature and the \"sinf\" feature. \r\n\r\nIf you want
    to generate a \"chain\" of substitutions, you can indeed concatenate the OpenTpe
    Layout tags using a period. So if Fontographer finds the name \"A.c2sc.salt\",
    it will attempt to generate the mapping from \"A.c2sc\" to \"A.c2sc.salt\" in
    the \"salt\" feature. \r\n\r\nWe will post a comprehensive guide for naming that
    will be compatible with our automatic OpenType Layout feature generation. \r\n\r\nOf
    course, for most common OpenType features, Fontographer will include a set of
    \"synonym suffixes\", so \".sc\" and \".small\" will be treated the same way as
    \".smcp\". \r\n\r\nMichael, \r\n\r\nthe glyphname \"U_alt.sc\" is interpreted
    by Acrobat as a ligature of \"U\" and \"alt\". Not a good idea. \r\n"

  body: "Ps, there is no danger in having more than one period. Anything after the
    first period is discarded by the Acrobat parser. Basically, the structure of a
    glyphname is the following: \r\n\r\nbasename (up to the first period, or if there
    is no period, the entire glyphname)\r\nsuffix (anything after the first period)\r\n\r\nThe
    basename should allow Acrobat to resolve the glyphname to a meaningful Unicode
    string. The suffix is fully up to the font developer. However, font tool developers
    such as FontLab may impose some conventions on the suffixes so that the automatic
    generation of OpenType Layout features can be facilitated. And this is what we're
    doing. \r\n\r\nBest,\r\nAdam"

    e.g. you just have one small-cap glyph that substitutes two different glyphs (\"A\"
    and \"a\"). This cannot be easily expressed in a glyphname, but we have some ideas
    regarding this. "
