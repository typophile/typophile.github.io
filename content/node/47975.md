body: I'm looking for a good font management software. One that will let me view installed
  fonts as well as font files yet to be installed. Using the standard mac software
  is so slow, clunky and tedious. I have a Mac OS X 10.4 Intel based machine. If any
  one has any recommendations for any software that's either free or relatively inexpensive,
  it would be much appreciated.

    is wonderful to work with and has excellent tools for deleting different cache
    files. "
