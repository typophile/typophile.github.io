  body: 'Thanks, Mark. Hearing Meeker on the project was interesting. What came across
    more than in the excellent NYT Magazine article was his passion for the project,
    and pride in being able to save lives. '

  body: "Don was interviewed by Studio 360 for a hour an forty minutes, and how long
    does the piece run? Six or so minutes! Take away all of those sound vignettes,
    and Don has a little more than four minutes of yapping. Its all just entertainment.\r\n\r\nJames"

  body: yeah, sure, it's all just entertainment, but it does make people aware of
