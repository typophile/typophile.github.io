  I have been doing product design for the last several years and I'm feeling a bit
  rusty. I was wondering what some of you thought about the designs he sent me. He
  was the manager of a team of product managers for computer accessories (mice, hubs,
  etc.)\r\n\r\nI sincerely appreciate any feedback you may provide.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/bc2007_mg2_4180.jpg]"

  body: "Lots of questions come to mind; some you may not want the beholder to have
    to ask. What is Michael Greco? Who is Michael Greco? Is Michael Greco a pair of
    last names that make a firm or company name? These questions come of the type
    in 'michael greco' looking too [kind of overbranded] to be a simple first and
    last name. \r\nHaving the luxury of seeing several different specimens, and looking
    up roadrunner.com to find that it's an internet service provider and most likely
    not Michael's employer, I get the feeling that Michael Greco is a consultant,
    marketer or strategist.\r\nMy advice would then be to add a word such as 'Consultant'
    to the design, just to fix the trouble with ambiguity.\r\nBeyond that, the type
    alignment in these designs is too predicable. I think the best direction to work
    in is D-E."

  body: "I agree with Bavid's main critique.\r\n\r\nBut I don't know what he means
    by \"the type alignment in these designs is too predicable\" because to me the
    alignment is too arbitrary -- quite the opposite of \"predicable\" (maybe he did
    want to say \"unpredictable\"?)."
