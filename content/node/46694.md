  Please rest assured that I've advised both parties concerning the typical limitations
  of free fonts, but I do know there are some gems out there, and this deal does serve
  a higher purpose, so I hope some good recommendation will be forthcoming. Thank
  you!\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    incredibly awful paper/press combination known to man.\r\n\r\nAnd while not free,
    Stone Sans and Stone Humanist Sans are only $59 a family from www.stonetypefoundry.com."
