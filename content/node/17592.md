  body: "Do you think that they just released them one at a time? I might guess that
    they released sets so that they could market a range to printers. Marketing was
    slower and more expensive then (in relative currency) so I would imagine producing
    a specimen book and other sales materials with enough faces to make the typesetter
    customer feel justified in purchasing the system and machinery.\r\n\r\nChrisL"

  body: "An interesting historic question that never occured to me... the first typeface
    <em>adapted</em> for the earliest Linotype typesetter. Not even the <a href=\"http://www.linotype.com/10-10-10-14022/1886.html?PHPSESSID=4fca5554419fd1628ef927a089d5f962\"
    target=\"new\">Linotype History</a> page on their site has a reference on it (that
    I could find).\r\n\r\nSome simple clues will probably lead us there:<ul><li>Whitelaw
    Reid of the New York Tribune was one of the key financial backers of Ottmar Mergenthaler.</li>\r\n<li>At
    an exhibition in Washington, D.C. in 1885, Mergenthaler was offered $300,000 for
    the rights to his prototype machine. For this sum, a group of publishers headed
    by Whiteclaw Reid bought controlling interest in the National Typographic Company
    which later was renamed the Mergenthaler Linotype Company. </li>\r\n<li>A more
    or less usable model was presented to the New York Tribune on July 3, 1886.</li></ul>\r\nA
    type detective would need to do the following:\r\n- Find out what metal fonts
    were used by the New York Tribune/Times just prior to July 1886.\r\n- Find out
    the actually date of publication of the first commercial use of Mergenthaler's
    <em>Blower</em> which it was called just prior to being called a <em>Linotype
    machine</em>. (The assumption is that the New York Tribune/Times was the first
    use, but that needs more research.)\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/NYTimes1881.png]\r\n<em>On
    a quick search, </em>The New York Times,<em> July 1881, was the closet paper I
    found prior to July 1886.</em>\r\n\r\nKey questions -- what would you consider
    the FIRST LINOTYPE typeface?\r\n- The earliest attempts while developing the prototype
    of the <em>Blower</em>?\r\n- The first typeface that could be set when the name
    <em>Linotype</em> was first used?\r\n- The first commercially available type matrice
    for the Linotype?\r\n\r\nCLUE -- It was Colonel Mustard, with the candlestick,
    in the Pantry."

    civer one done in the 20's (I think). This is a lovely piece of work, showing
    the faces in classical layour and colors, printing on a good weight bookstock.
    I had a cop once which I lent to someone, and that's the last I ever saw of it.
    This is really something worth having for the Linotype enthusiast, at least the
    person I lent mine to thought so.\r\n\r\nJim [img:sites/default/files/old-images/]"
