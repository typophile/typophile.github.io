<div class="post-content e-content" itemprop=articleBody>Hey everyone!
I am new to the site, but I have some friends that rave about it. I have been working on a personal identity mark the last few weeks. They suggested I put up a couple of my options and get some feedback. I am going for an organic, free flowing form. I want something that is not too serious looking and is delicate and beautiful. Thanks for your help.

<div class=commentbody>If you're looking for something delicate and free flowing, it should just be a few deliberate strokes. This ventures dangerously close to a wad of pubes. Definitely potential in these, though.</div>

Wow. That's the funniest thing I've ever read/seen on this forum. LOL! Not to be mean or anything (sorry) but after reading that I had to see for myself! Funny. Sorry. But seriously...I think it's beautiful in a doilyish way, which I also consider delicate. Nice work. How to improve it?...I concur: Simplify.

<div class=commentbody>That's looking clean but also a tad busy. The internal hollow swashes are the strongest part of your image but they're being severed by their stems. Perhaps moving the stems off to the sides of them could work? Doing with the third one might be your best bet. They're all looking good though.</div>

<div class=commentbody>It looks like less of a tangle now...a little less. I'm of the less-is-more camp.
A little of this depends upon how you want this to work. My first thought was, "Hmmm...neat idea. Is this part of some new the-artist-formerly-known-as-Prince-inspired trend out in California? Is it something an artist develops for him or herself, or is there a potential market for these sort of things among tragically wealthy and bored metrosexuals?" Either way, to simplify or not to simplify is all a matter of style.
On the other hand, if it's something you'd like to appear more like a typographical element, like a letter of the alphabet (which to me would be really cool and very difficult), then it's got a long way to go. It's far from Caslon or Helvetica!

<div class=commentbody>I think you should start pairing a few of these with your name. Your icon and name will need to work together. The font you ultimately select will help you determine what other refinements your mark may need.
You've made nice progress, keep it up.</div>

<div class=commentbody>At the risk of seeming like a pube-wad fangirl, I actually like one of the ones in the first image - on the second row, on the right. It had an open free-ness missing in the revised designs.
What did the image look like when you had your initials more referenced?</div>

<div class=commentbody>I have to agree with the pube-wad-loving Ms. Budwig inasmuchas the open freeness is missing...or, in other words, it has become less delicate. And I couldn't agree more with the suggestion to pair it with a typeface for comparison and refinements. You have simplified by making it heavier, and I don't think that's necessarily necessary.

My recklessness does not lend itself to giving a lot of thought to the ethics of discussion forums on the internet and repercussions of off-hand comments. I'm doing my best not to participate, but sometimes I just get so dang bored! Really, I mean no harm. Just trying to have some fun.

<div class=commentbody>coming in late to this one, but the mark has not really succeeded in the free flowing category for me. organic i get, systems in nature and the like, but free flowing? looks too contrived. even more so in the later versions with big blocks of fill and a heavy-handed geometry. the mark feels like you really know how to work illustrator very well. take a step back from the computer and see what happens when you use your hands. i think that will open a whole new world for this mark and help take you in a better direction for free flowing/organic
