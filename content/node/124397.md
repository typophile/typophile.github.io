    to read \"Hi.\" That's one more meaning than you need.\r\n\r\nThe left letters
    are narrower and pushed aside, making the whole group unbalanced and off-center.
    Maybe you haven't realized that you have a chair as well as a lamp. Give both
    equal space and importance.\r\n\r\nConsider a low crossbar on the \"A\" making
    a stripe trim on the lamp. Then see if it helps to copy the letter shapes into
    the logotype below."

  body: "I hate to rain on your parade but here's my feedback.\r\n\r\nI think the
    \"turning letters into a lamp\" thing is cute. But it's not what Laura Ashley
    would do. It's too contrived, too gimmicky. They are a mature, traditional, classic
    design company. Look at their existing branding; it's elegant, simply, almost
    minimalist, with the focus being on the products. \r\n\r\nIf \"LAHI\" is in fact
    an acronym that they have identified as one that they would use, then I would
    look for a more classic, understated treatment and leave the \"look at me I'm
    a clever visual trope\"  look behind. It just doesn't work with their brand, in
    my opinion.\r\n\r\nThis might work for some cheeky home decor startup, but I don't
    see it fitting with the Laura Ashley brand at all.\r\n\r\nAlso the whole trefoil
    stuff around the mark is gratuitous. It's ornament that does not do anything other
    than distract. You're trying to make it look elegant but that's because the logotype
    and the LAHI part is not strong enough, visually, to carry it off. It ends up
    just being busy fluff.\r\n\r\nAnd if I were going to go with it, I would lose
    the pull chain and find another way of signaling that the \"A\" is the shade of
    a lamp (which is forced to begin with as you have to turn into a \"not-a\". Like
    making bright marks or something."

  body: Lauren Ashley is probably not Laura Ashley. I would assume she already knows
    what she's getting into in terms of brand conflict.
