body: ok, One more font I need identified...for now, at least... <BR>Again, What teh
  f0ntz0rz didn&#39;t give any good results, so, lets see if anyone here can figure
  it out. <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/23381.gif" alt="">
  <BR>&#40;sorry for the poor quality, if needed, I can find a better quality picture&#41;.
  I know it&#39;s an old font, like, 1996 or earlier. Could be wrong, though.

  body: hmm, I never thought of stretching out Runic o_O Yeah, it does look like it,
    with some minor editing to make it a bit more &#34;roundish&#34; on the letters...
    It seems Runic is quite popular amongst Videogame logos &#40;Zelda, Final Fantasy,
    etc&#41;. Thanks.
