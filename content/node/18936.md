  couldnt find any substantial thread on this typeface with the search, so i thought
  i'd ask. what do you think of this typeface?\r\n\r\nsure, like avant garde, it somehow
  stands for a specific  time, it has a kind of retro-feeling to it. but i still like
  it as a corporate font. i dont really think it will work well in text, but couldnt
  try it. we have the whole BQ-collection here at work, so i'll be able to see how
  it looks hopefully later today.\r\ni miss some \"more regular\" alternatives for
  some of the more special letters (like Q), but you cant have everything :)\r\n\r\nany
  answers would of course be greatly appreciated."

    form of one or the other? If that character is part of the regular complement,
    the typeface is probably a poor choice because of this ambiguity."
