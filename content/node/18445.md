  body: A watered-down clone of Sophisto is [[Rui Abreu]]'s <a href="http://www.t26.com/fonts/display.php?f_id=855">Tirana</a>.
    I'm not too happy about that one -- it borders on plagiarism. :^/

    body: "I think you haven't seen Tirana carefully enough, it has a completly different
      feeling to it. I really don't see why you think that Tirana is a clone of Sophisto.
      You shoud be more careful before accusing others of plagiarism. T26 has a Typesetter
      http://www.t26.com/fonts/display.php?f_id=855 I think you should check it.\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Well, I must say that when I first saw the typeface announced in the T-26
    newsletter, I immediately noticed all the similarities, especially in the name
    Tirana which was displayed quite big.\r\n\r\nOf course this is an original font,
    but it borrows heavily on shapes, curves and design motifs as seen in Sophisto.
    This is not the first time this happens BTW -- <a href=\"http://www.sudtipos.com/fonts-kautiva.htm\">Kautiva</a>
    also suffers from this, albeit to a lesser extent."
