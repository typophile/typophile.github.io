body: This stone-carved blackletter type is on the front of the main administrative
  building of Virginia Tech's campus in Blacksburg, Virginia, USA. The building was
  completed in 1936, and I believe the relief carving is original with the construction.
  So far I have not been able to find a match (or anything really close for that matter),
  which leads me to believe it may have been designed or modified by the architects
  of the building. Please help me find the rest of the alphabet for this font.

  body: "I agree that the lettering for the building inscription is most likely a
    creation of Carmel Johnston & Wright Architects. It is a pastiche of English and
    German Black letter styles.\r\nA large number of Blackletter fonts have been digitized,
    with various degrees of quality.\r\nThe following are some good sources for Blackletter
    design revivals which may help to extend the alphabet. You may have to pick and
    choose from various fonts to find letters that harmonize with the 1936 inscription.\r\n\r\nFree:\r\nManfred

    I wonder if \"Virginia Tech\" was a science focused school. If it was, the choice
    of Black letter is somewhat unusual. In Germany Blackletter was for \"Klutur\"
    and Antiqua, i.e. Roman or Latin letters were for science. On the other hand,
    if the lettering inspiration was more English than German, then this makes some
    sense. But I'm only speculating here.\r\nDon\r\n"
