    paste into Glyph Window in Fontographer and Auto Trace ( Read section on this
    in Fontographer Manual).

  body: Yeah I read that, but is there no way of keeping the original images (and
    colours etc)? Or will I have to just place the originals one at a time into the
    InDesign document, rather than creating a whole font.

  body: Fonts do not do color - you can apply color to them in other programs - screened
    or dithered grayscale is as close as you can get to your images and they may have
    too many points when imported and traced to work as fonts. You can make a table
    of letter scans and then paste them into an InDesign document as you suggest.

    which will work in a few applications that are supported through FontLab''s plugins
    (Adobe CS apps), *and* you''ll be able to easily export an outline version to
    the VFB format, and then open it in Fontographer and turn it into an outline-based
    OpenType font which will be monochrome but will work in all systems and applications. '

    of the original features have been lost. In the PostScript 3 format it was absolutely
    possible what you want, but PS3 is obsolete, eg not working in the modern operating
    systems. Too bad\u2026 \r\n\r\nThe BitFonter option proposed bu Adam Twardoch
    is your best chance to get what you want\u2026"

  body: "Bert, \r\n\r\na small clarification: PostScript 3 is well-alive, it's the
    most recent (and quite likely, final) incarnation of the PostScript language.
    What you're referring to were the PostScript Type 3 fonts. They never actually
    really worked. Glyphs in Type 3 fonts could be constructed using any operators
    of the PostScript language -- so you could mix strokes, fills, patterns, colors,
    bitmaps etc. However, for this to work, one needed a full PostScript interpreter.
    \r\n\r\nExcept in NeXT (and some high-end Unix implementations), no major operating
    system implemented Display PostScript. So for example in Mac OS, the Type 3 fonts
    worked so that on screen, you only saw a crude bitmap preview supplied in the
    NFNT resources in the font suitcase, and only if you printed the job, the actual
    result appeared on the PostScript printer. If your printer did not have a PostScript
    interpreter, your results could vary as well. So there was no real guarantee that
    you'd get want you wanted. You could not even see what you were getting (WYSIWYG).
    \r\n\r\nThe PostScript Type 1 format (and its successor, CFF, which is part of
    the OpenType PS .otf format) only uses a very limited subset of the operators,
    which allows in to work in a variety of environments. Adobe Type Manager (ATM)
    was one software that could produce rasterized images on screen out of the real
    outline Type 1 fonts. But ATM, even though it was Adobe's, could not render Type
    3 fonts properly \u2014 because it would then had to include a complete PostScript
    interpreter. \r\n\r\nOf course, later operating systems incorporated the Type
    1 format natively, while they dropped the ability to install Type 3 fonts simply
    because, as I said, they never _really_ worked. \r\n\r\nActually, SVG Fonts are
    made very similarly to the Type 3 fonts. Their glyphs can be either \"simple\"
    (and then only use a small subset of outline drawing commands, comparable to Type
    1), or \"complex\" (and then they use the full repertoire of SVG drawing commands,
    which is comparable to Type 3: you can do strokes, colors, bitmaps, fills, gradients,
    transparency etc.). \r\n\r\nHowever, it seems that most web browsers only support
    the \"simple\" variant of SVG Fonts, and fail to render the \"complex\" variant.
    (And of course, SVG Fonts do not work outside of web browsers, although theoretically
    they could). \r\n\r\nSo same history again :)\r\n\r\nBest,\r\nAdam"
