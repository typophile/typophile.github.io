  big to even attach as a file and even saving the pictures i was going to use onto
  one page using Adobe wont work for me. i give up!!! I'll come back and post the
  pictures once I find someone smarter than me to help...until then, heres what I
  have to say about signs in New Orleans:\r\n\r\nThere were two things I really noticed
  about signs in New Orleans last weekend while walking down Magazine Street with
  Jessee...There are a lot of hand drawn and/or painted signs, and a lot of signs
  are in French or at least have some French feeling to them in some way.  I really
  like that there are a lot of hand done signs. It makes places stand out more, and
  it makes them more memorable. It also gives more of an artistic feel to the city
  which is so well known for artsy things.  When I go visit my family in Texas I don't
  see as many original, unique signs as I see in New Orleans.  I think its nice to
  see so many artistic displays around town.  It really makes things more interesting
  and beautiful, especially in an artist's view.\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/100_0496

  body: Lizzy, have you seen the <a href="http://www.typophile.com/node/18067">guidelines
    for posting images</a>? Or, maybe you just need to reduce the resolution of these
    particular images.

  body: hrant, the 'flood' of posts is because we are all taking Graphic Design and
    Typography at Loyola U and our teachers are grading us on our Typophile blogs.
    They give us assignments, we do them. This assignment was about NO signs.

    a great project and definitely encourage you to keep it up! \r\n\r\nThere have
    been a number of questions in relation to your blog posts, and I am hoping someone
    from your group might be able to post a summary of the project or project goals,
    so that we might have a bit of context to understand what this is all about.\r\n\r\n:)"
