body: "Just thought i'd post some concepts im working on for a report. nothing is
  nailed down just yet, so still working on the grid/typeface/idea.\r\nusing Adobe
  Jenson (Slimbach) OT, apart from Mrs Eaves on the cover. I have a mixture of white
  and reversed pages, but will need to work out how they work together as the transition
  is a little 'harsh' at the moment. Its a two colour job so some of the headings
  are pantone red.\r\nI have proportional old style on in Open Type to get the droped
  Numbers, will this do anything to the rest of the typeface? I can't see anything
  different than the numbers droping at the moment.\r\nUsing a really spacious A4
  page, thought about making it thinner or wider, but thinking about printing cost
  vs the layout that will be needed in the later sections with tables, they generally
  need alot more room.\r\nAlso went and took some photos, but will need to come up
  with a strong concept before re-doing the imagery. these are pretty much place holders
  at the moment, while i work on layout ideas.\r\n\r\nThere are several levels of
  heading im still working on, as well as a drop cap intro para (which needs kerning)."

  body: "Apart from the typography, it feels a little forbidding -- stark colors,
    and we're looking up at towering objects in the two photos you've shown (which
    I realize are placeholders).\r\n\r\nConsider whether such formal presentation
    is appropriate for a university. I love formal typography, but this feels a little
    authoritarian to me."

  body: As far as being a little authoritarian, I think that Mrs. Eaves lignatures
    are far from being cold and authorative, to me they can be very soft and feminine
    when used correctly. However, I'd have to second that discrentionary lignatures
    can look akward reduce legibility for body copy.

  body: "Depending on how many pages and the binding method your inner margins are
    too tight, perfect binding, for example, will lose quite a large area at the middle
    of the spread. The measure is right on the limit of width also what point size
    are you using; how do you see the tables working with the text, I think that the
    combination of tabular information with text is the critical point for Annual
    Reports.\r\nOn picture 2_24 the heading styles seems to go astray for Conclusion
    and on 4_3 The Reporting Entity doesn't have the red.\r\nTim"

  body: "These are all great comments, it is definity at the development stage and
    great to catch all these things, and take the other into consideration.\r\nUsing
    8pt/11.6pt leading on Adobe Jenson Pro, you think thats too small? it might seem
    smaller as the page A4. I could bump up the point size to 9/12, ill take a look
    after a print out. I think your right timd, I will change the margins.\r\n\r\nMarcox-
    yeah i can see what your talking about, damm its good to get a different perspective,
    ill be taking this into account when I do the photos."
