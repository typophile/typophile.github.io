    many of these critiques start with this question: Can you set some words in your
    font and post a sample? It really helps to see the letters in context to know
    how usable it is. <BR> <BR>jb '

  body: ' This is like another recent font shown in this forum: too many good ideas!
    It&#39;s a great start, but I think it needs to sober up to become usable. Like
    &#34;a&#34;-&#34;g&#34; is great &#40;although the &#34;f&#34; needs work&#41;,
    but the &#34;h&#34; -and then the &#34;n&#34;, &#34;u&#34;, et alia- introduce
    a new element, creating too much noise. Apply some &#34;discipline&#34;, and you&#39;re
    there! <BR> <BR>hhp '

    off the descenders &#60; not that it isn&#39;t a valid solution, but i feel that
    that would be a entirley different typface. I might try the no descender ascender
