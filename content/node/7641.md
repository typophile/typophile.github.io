  body: Haha... He&#39;s suggesting that it&#39;s probably a custom job. Where did
    this come from? I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if it were a font with alternate characters.
    On the other hand, it could indeed be &#34;custom.&#34;

  body: That&#39;s Lys Calligraph, aka Lysandria aka Lorrene. You can see it on <a
    href="http://bowfinprintworks.com/Script13Pg2.html" target="_blank">Mike&#39;s
    script ID guide</a> &#40;scroll down, it&#39;s on the bottom right of the page&#41;.
    It is not commercially available to my knowledge. It is available as freeware
    for PC only. This is funny, I was just looking for this font too. It&#39;s a beaut
    .

  body: as the name of the font is "Opti" and the site is "Opti" as well, and a previous
    post states it is available for free on PC, and the font does not seem to be locatable
    otherwise, i felt safe in adding the link. if there is evidence otherwise please
    let me know.

    could redistribute them, even if they are now defunct. Would you steal a car and

    owns the car. these fonts are (apparently) abandoned, and in this case appear
    to be archived here by the former owner or related party so they can be used.\r\n\r\nwould
    you prevent someone from reading what would otherwise be a lost book, if not for
    someone creating a copy?"

    and don\u2019t have the right to redistribute them. It\u2019s not clear whether
    Opti abandoned them and let someone redistribute them.\r\n\r\nAnd you would forget
    the fonts were designed by the original designers.\r\nOpti might have just stole
    them and might have not paid royalties, though.\r\nAnd, of course, there are some
    of the typefaces whose designers are missing or which are very old.\r\nBut, it
    is not good for you to redistribute them.\r\nYou need to contact original designers
    and recreate their fonts with their permission (without using outlines of Opti\u2019s
    fonts), if you would not like to let them lost.\r\n\r\nThe people that archive
    them there are at abfonts, I think.\r\nThey digitize lost typefaces and also steal
    recent designs, e. g. custom typeface for Puma by Paul Barnes."

  body: some days i'm ashamed to be part of this group. i posted a link with information
    about the sources for these fonts, and their history which is far more than any
    of the other possibilities offer. i'm sorry that i can't go back and ask Leonardo
    about who the Mona Lisa really was or why she smiled, but i'm sure as heck not
    going to tell people that they can't enjoy the painting.
