    lists for different scripts or for some other discreet subsets. For PS blue zones,
    FLS could combine alignment zones of different glyph lists where they overlap,
    but by separating the TTF alignment zone generation one could auto-create separate
    alignment zones for different different subsets, which is frequently useful in
    that whereas one might want to pop an alignment zone up a pixel for e.g. Latin
    caps at a particular size, one might want to pop some features of Thai at the
    same height down or leave them where they are.

    not all glyphs of an alignement zone, is any more useful that just taking the
    default alignments as the only cvt values in the TT font</em>\r\n\r\nWorking in
    VTT, we've often found it useful to define script-specific CVTs, not only for
    alignment zones but also for stems, because even when alignment zones or stem
    distances are very similar, we run into situations in which, at the crude pixel
    end of things, the best solution for e.g. the relationship of Latin x-height to
    ascender height isn't the best solution for the relationship of the Armenian x-height
    to ascender height, even though on the em the relationships may be identical.
    Or, elsewhere, at larger sizes, we might want the horizontals of one script to
    jump to two pixels at a different size than another script, typically because
    of the level of vertical density to be accommodated in a given height.\r\n\r\nQuite
    a few people I've talked to use the FontLab autohinter as a starting place, and
    then apply manual tweaks to improve the results at both global and glyph levels.
    Being able to slice a glyph set into chunks for the autohinter to process, would
    enable more options in such editing.\r\n\r\nKarsten: <em>Once you add that many
    variables, and per font, you might as well define alignment zones manually.</em>\r\n\r\nBut
    then you would also need to apply alignment zones manually, and I'm not even sure
    if FL currently allows one to have overlapping alignment zones. Let's say you
    want to have a Latin x-height alignment zone and an Armenian x-height alignment
    zone, and you want to be able to individually affect them at e.g. 10ppem, such
    that the Latin x-height ends up being a pixel taller at that size. That requires
    two things: separate definition of these alignment zones, and the ability to identify
    which should be applied to set an anchor for any given x-height feature.\r\n\r\nThis
    isn't particular to autohinting. But the discussion does suggest different views
    of what an autohinter is or should be. I get the impression that some people think
    an autohinter should be something like a PS rasteriser, trying to come up with
    the best rendering it can based on a minimal set of information. I prefer to think
    of an autohinter as a robotic replacement or assistant for a human hinter, and
    I want to be able to provide the autohinter with the same kind of information
    that I would provide to a human hinter, such as the ability to say \u2018I want
    the x-heights of these two scripts to differentiate at x ppem size(s)\u2019."

    Get back to the original task (in this case: rasterizing outlines at low resolution),
    analyze the task, from the analysis derive a method that does the job, and express
    this method as a program. Neither 'auto' nor 'hinting' are left to even talk about.
    Only 'rasterization' as a task and a program.\r\nThis roughly summarizes my view.
    An 'autohinter' does not exist there. So our views differ fundamentally indeed.

    ones.)"

    in http://typophile.com/node/83661 -- you'll see two x-direction TT \"stems\"
    (X: v 393 and X: w 330). They indicate a distance between two points in a diagonal
    glyph, which are not really a stem. \r\n\r\nSo, in short, in FontLab's TrueType
    hinting, a \"stem\" is actually just a distance. It can be any kind of distance:
    between two points forming a stem, or between two points located diagonally, or
    between two points forming a counter. In Type 1, this does not quite work exactly
    that way, although to some extent, Type 1 stems can also be used to control counters. "

  body: "Karsten, I've thought a lot about alternative rasterisation technologies
    too, and understand the merits of breaking away from hint-driven rasterisation.
    But hinting came into existence for a reason, and that reason is exactly the original
    task you describe: rasterising outlines at low resolution. There's a bit of a
    tendency now, because of the development costs of hinting, to view it as a problem
    or as something to get beyond \u2014 through increases in resolution or in new
    anti-aliasing techniques \u2014, forgetting that hinting was the <em>solution.</em>
    The other things that people tend to forget is that hinting is <em>design.</em>
    In bi-level bitmap rendering, it is specific design; in the variety of antialiasing
    techniques now available it is, or should be, conditional design. [An analogue
    would be the distinction between static print design and conditional Web design.]
    Beat Stamm's late work at Microsoft was focused on this conditional approach,
    although he expresses it in terms of hinting as programming, because he's looking
    at it from the code side rather than the 'How to I make this shape most legible
    in a given condition?', which is a design question.\r\n\r\nAnd it is in this context
    of hinting as design that I am most concerned about what I see happening in efforts
    to pursue new rasterisation techniques with the intent of making hinting unnecessary.
    Not because I like hinting or paying for hinting, but because I like design. That
    question, 'How do I make this shape most legible...?', is a question that I have
    yet to see answered for all shapes in all scripts, in the same set of conditions,
    without hinting playing a part. In other words, better rasterisation methods,
    antialiasing techniques and even current increases in screen resolution, don't
    seem able to produce the kind of legible results that I want in design for at
    least some glyphs in some writing systems. [Excepting the special case of glyph
    outlines fitted to a specific grid.] There remain situations in which I want to
    be able to tell the rasteriser that 'This stem needs to round down rather than
    up at this size' or that 'These two stems can be merged at this size'*. Those
    are design decisions, and reflect the fact that there is more to making text best
    legible on screen than rasterising outlines to their nearest clean fit and applying
    antialiasing.\r\n\r\nSo by all means come up with better ways to rasterise unhinted
    outlines, but don't take away the capability to make design decisions that modify
    or override the results. Even Apple found that there were situations, albeit rare
    ones under default settings, in which it was still desirable to apply hinting,
    even with their radical down-definition of what constitutes 'crude' conditions.\r\n\r\n*
    As a good example, compare Meiryo rendering with hint designed stroke reduction
    under ClearType with the undesigned grey blur in Safari."

    what in VTT would be considered a 'grey distance', i.e. one that covers both black
    and white areas of the glyph. So, for instance, you could link from the outside
    edge of one stem to the inside edge of another, across the counter, and control
    that distance, rather than the counter distance itself, while anchoring the leading
    edges of parallel stems to the grid."
