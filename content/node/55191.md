  library with some old books. Here are some photos to share...\r\nIn one picture
  you can see double apostrophe in the begin of the sentence. Anyone here knows the

  body: The double, baseline apostrophe is a style of quotation marks (still used
    today in Germany). What is interesting in this Portuguese typography is that the
    quotation mark is repeated at the beginning of every line, not just at the beginning
    of every paragraph within the quotation, which would be the modern norm.

  body: Wasn't the repeated quotation mark at the start of each line used in French
    books? I'm fairly certain I've seen French novels where this is used.

  body: "According to <a href=\"http://www.xraymag.com/articles/xray_v5n1_interpunct_02.html\">this
    article</a>, they were even used that way in early English books:\r\n\r\n<em>Quotation
    marks began to appear in printed works in 17th century England. However, there
    was no standardization for the use of these marks. In early works readers would
    find quotation marks, distractingly, at the beginning of each line of a long quote.
    Eventually this typesetting style was abandoned and the quote marks were removed,
    but not the space they occupied.</em>\r\n\r\nBeautiful pages, by the way. Thanks
    for posting them!"

    printings but i'm not sure... i'll try to find some examples, i'll also try to
    find out when they stoped being used like this, repeatedly in every line. I'm
    curious now, thanks Ant\xF3nio!"

  body: "Nice indeed.\r\n\r\nOne thing I found interesting was seeing the tilde placed
    over the 'o', as in the word \"cora\xE7a\xF5\" (first line of top sample). The
    current orthography is to place the tilde over the 'a', like \"cora\xE7\xE3o\".
    I could swear that in primary school we were taught to position the diacritic
    between the 'a' and the 'o'. This would actually make sense because '\xE3o' needs
    to be read as a nasalized diphthong, and having the tilde between the two letters
    would emphasize the fact that it's not just the 'a' that is accented/nasalized.
    I guess the diacritic gradually migrated West :^)\r\n\r\nSpeaking of old Portuguese
    books, some time ago I started a thread here on Typophile (which is impossible
    to find right now) about the [[http://purl.pt/index/geral/PT/index.html|Biblioteca
    Nacional Digital]]. It's a site that is definitely worth exploring, especially
    the [[http://purl.pt/index/monog/PT/index.html|Old Book (Livro Antigo) section]]."

    about the book, because in these old typography times sometimes you can't even
    find any mention of author, or printer, or editions, or even dates...\r\n\r\nAnt\xF3nio,
    I had no idea of such a place in Celorico :)\r\n"

  body: "\"(whose book designs tend to mirror that of Portugal)\" Guifa, actually,
    it's the other way round. For many decades, all that we had here in Portugal came
    from Spain, typographers, types, matrices... even the German ones were first established
    in Spain, before coming here... mainly from Salamanca I think.\r\n\r\nAbout the
    Biblioteca Virtual, I can't seem to find a way to download the books in pdf, do
    you know if this is possible?"

    \ \r\n\r\nThe books in CV at the moment have different formats depending on the
    rights and digitization method used.  For the facsimile editions, there is thankfully
    a pattern to the file names so I just write a script to download it and place
    into a PDF on my own.  Quality can vary but the more recent scans tend to be of
    higher quality (I've found a few that are black and white 1 bit scans of manuscripts
    -- impossible to read for me)\r\n\r\n<em>\xABEl futuro es una l\xEDnea tan fina

    and another slight upward diagonal.  This was necessary because it was placed
    over multiple letters at once:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/oldlongtilde_3777.png]\r\n\r\nOvertime,
    it began to just be used to represent a deleted n or m: capitane --> capit\xE3e
    (Sp. capit\xE1n).  In Spanish at least, there was no real rhyme or reason, it
    was just a space saver.  I'm not as current on Portuguese linguistics to know
    its history as marking nasality.  Also in Spanish you encounter a lot the q with
    a tilde, which abbreviates \"que\" (hence aunq~ = aunque).\r\n\r\nIt's because
    of this history that I prefer tildes that overall are flat or slightly rising.
    \ There are a lot of fonts that have it essentially dropping which I don't like
    and I'd consider personally improperly made, but I don't say that with any authority
    other than historical precedence :)  Things are changing of course.\r\n\r\n<em>\xABEl
