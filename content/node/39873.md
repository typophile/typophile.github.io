  of it in use. I think it works quite well, paired with Serifa. It's a non-profit

  forgive the terrible quality. It's due to low light, a lousy photographer and no
  scanner available."

    Only one weight was drawn--or supervised--by Morris Fuller Benton. The others
    were drawn by Ed Benguiat in the 60 for photo typesetting. "

    the pairing of Souvenir and Serifa.\r\n\r\nBtw Frode, that's a lovely avatar you've
    got there! What is it?    "
