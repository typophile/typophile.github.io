  the lowercase and uppercase very carefully.\r\nThen, I went ahead and made the accented
  characters, etc...\r\n\r\nI want to apply my kerning for certain existing (kerned)
  glyphs into a \"class.\"\r\n\r\nFor example, I have kerned the \"E\" and I'd like
  to make a new class and apply the kerning I've already done for the \"E\" to all
  of the other \"Egrave, Eacute...\" \r\n\r\nI'm pretty good about being a fast learner,
  but this has stumped me.\r\nI really hope there is a way to do this, otherwise,
  class kerning has to be done after ALL characters/glyphs are complete, which I think
  would be BS, being a software owner myself.\r\n\r\nAny help would be greatly appreciated.\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Perhaps Jhilgert is using FontLab Studio 5. If so, you need to add a kerning
    class in the Classes panel and define your kerned glyph as a key glyph. The class
    definition would look like: \r\n<code>_E: E' Eacute Egrave</code>\r\n(Remember
    to click on Apply in the Classes panel). Then, you need to define the context
    in which kerning should be applied using the checkboxes next to the class name
    in the classes list. \r\n\r\nThat's all. (Your Metrics Window needs to be in Class
    Kerning mode or Class Kerning with Exceptions mode.)\r\n\r\nThe kerning values
    for the dependant glyphs are always linked to those of the key glyph, unless you
    define an exception. So you don't need to create classes only after your kerning
    is finished. But the glyphs that you add to the class need to exist. "
