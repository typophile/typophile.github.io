    likely culprits on these lists, iOS ships Arial Unicode so there's a chance it
    came from there. Alternately you could ask Apple. :-)\r\n\r\nSi"

  body: "Given that on Mac OS X the only Armenian-capable preinstalled fonts are Michael
    Everson\u2019s Mshtakan and Arial Unicode, I think Simon is right. \r\nBut, since
    Arial Unicode only comes in Regular, it would be interesting to know how italics
    and bolds are rendered."

  body: "There could be a hidden font (but, usually, this kind of fonts too come only
    in regular. Heck, even Lucida Grande still lacks italic!).\r\nAnyway, for comparison,
    here\u2019s non-mobile Safari Armenian rendering:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/armenian_6680.png]"

  body: "When I want to know what font is used to render some text, I copy it and
    paste it in TextEdit. That seems to give reliable information. Here is what I
    get:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/mshtakan_5701.jpg]\r\n\r\nOn the
    other hand, if I paste the very same text in Pages (on OS X 10.5), the look remains
    the same, but Pages tells me the font is Helvetica. I thus guess that Pages on
    the iPad would not be more useful to learn the font."

  body: "There is only one font in iOS that provides Armenian glyphs. It's called
    .PhoneFallback:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/iphone-armenian_6668.png]\r\n\r\nThe
    description reads:\r\n\r\n\xBBThe .PhoneFallback font is used by the operating
    system to display Unicode data when the font requested does not have the capability
    to handle the requested Unicode. PhoneFallback is based upon the Open Source font
    Bitstream Vera and the public domain font Deja Vu. Bitstream Vera is a trademark
    of Bitstream, Inc., designed by Jim Lyles. See complete license details at http://dejavu-fonts.org/wiki/index.php?title=License\xAB\r\n\r\nIndeed
    the Armenian in .PhoneFallback is identical to that in DejaVu Sans."
