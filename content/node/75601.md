body: "Hi guys,\r\n\r\nIs the Kerning ok on this?\r\nHave I improved the \"R\" or
  have I destroyed it?\r\n\r\nI have just designed a logo need a nice bold extended
  font to go with it. The company is called fourmation and the font I have used in
  the attached picture is Microgramma Bold Extended. I like this font but to me the
  \"R\" looked a bit funny so I have played around with the \"R\" relating it to the
  \"F\", do any of these work?\r\n\r\nLook forward to your response,\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\nMichael\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/fourmation_4350.jpg]"

  body: "I am assuming the first example is the original. The second R definitely
    looks wrong.\r\n\r\nI think the final example works best, although you might want
    to try moving the end of the middle stroke slightly to the left. As it is it will
    work."

  body: Example 1 is the best; there is no need to match the position of the crossbars
    in F and R. The R in example 2 looks like bad, the F in example 3 looks bad. And
    maybe this is just because the image is poorly rendered, but buy a better version
    of Eurostile/Microgramma. The M, A, N, and T in this one appear awkwardly drawn;
    it looks much better with Linotype Eurostile.

  body: "I would be more concerned over the width of the letters.\r\nEach glyph in
    a typeface is something of a compromise, optimized to work with every other glyph,
    so any particular combination in a word may not be ideal.\r\nIn this word, the
    M is really wide, and the F quite narrow, drawing attention to the middle of the
    word, when really the initial letter is the most important.\r\nSo why not make
    the F a bit wider (and possibly the T), and the M narrower, and see if that improves
    the whole?\r\n\r\nBTW, please make images no wider than 588 pixels, to avoid scrolling."

  body: ">I actually like Forza\r\n\r\nMany people do, it's a fine face. My guess
    is, there will be more widths eventually, but when you scale it as you have, then
    are you using Forza anymore?\r\n\r\n "

  body: "Since it\u2019s a logo, why don\u2019t you just try drawing it in pencil
    first?\r\nYou may use Eurostile Extended or whatever, as a starting point, but
    then, again, you have the advantage of designing a logotype: i.e. the letters
    which need to work well together are \u2013 in your case \u2013 just nine, and
    not twenty-six.\r\nAfter you are satisfied, even if you are unpractical with bezier
    drawing, you can use your sketch as a basis, and the letters you need, as a starting
    point for your final, vector-based version."
