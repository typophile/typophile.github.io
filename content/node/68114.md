body: "It looks a lot like letterpress Fairfield, but with a couple of small differences.\r\n\r\nThe
  samples:\r\n\r\nhttp://img186.imageshack.us/g/img2081l.jpg/\r\n\r\nThey are from
  E.B. White's \"One Man's Meat\", published by Harper & Brothers, from 1938 to 1944.\r\n\r\nI'm
  comparing the samples with this:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.textism.com/textfaces/index.html?id=16\r\n\r\n-
  The italic f is different from the Fairfield in Textism.\r\n- The capital U is different
  from the Fairfield in Textism.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the old letterpress Fairfield is simply
  a bit different from Adobe's digital version shown in Textism. \r\n\r\nPerhaps it
  isn't Fairfield after all . . .\r\n\r\nI'd appreciate some help in identifying this
  lovely old type. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    we still, a year later, have no viable Fairfield revivals?"

  body: "For me it also looks like Fairfield. The only problem Linotype produced it
    after 1940 (or something is not told in my book).\r\nHere http://books.google.com/books?id=eTJ8khmZie0C&pg=PA202&lpg=PA202&dq=linotype+fairfield&source=bl&ots=g5Hm5VNtA_&sig=Zv8shjWcHUaLV4X58g8kUDoNcd8&hl=en&ei=SseSS9mUBqjJ_ga058zoDA&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=8&ved=0CCMQ6AEwBw#v=onepage&q=linotype%20fairfield&f=false
    is specimen of metal types. Digital version is based on 48 or 60 pt so it is much
    lighter than your text.\r\nHere http://www.abaa.org/books/274218562.html is \"Fairfield.
