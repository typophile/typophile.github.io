  Which do I use? \r\n\r\nI am on a mac, using Indesign if that makes a difference?\r\n\r\nThanks

  body: "AFAIK\r\n\r\nOTF uses Postscript Type 1 outlines, which use cubic beziers,
    while TTF uses TrueType outlines, which are quadratic beziers.\r\n\r\nThe latter
    is 'simpler' but requires more points to generate some of the same shapes. I think
    there are also some shapes that can't directly convert from Cubic to Quadratic.
    Because it requires more points, the filesize can be bigger (though in some cases,
    it can end up with less points if it's something that is more effectively written
    as quadratic beziers.)\r\n\r\nEDIT: To add, I'm not sure if it's the case for
    all, but sometimes I found difficulty with certain Mac ttf files and using them
    in Windows; I think they might have been an Apple true-type font file while the
    Windows ones I found transport to Mac fine. The .otf files have worked on both
    without problem, so I prefer those where possible, especially as I don't have
    to deal with two different files for, like with the old Postscript format.\r\n\r\nIf
    you scroll down to the circle approximation on the Wikipedia article, it should
    show visually the difference:\r\n\r\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B%C3%A9zier_spline"

  body: "<blockquote>OTF uses Postscript Type 1 outlines ..</blockquote>\r\nNo, OpenType
    allows either TrueType or Type 1 outlines.\r\n\r\nI suspect the font foundry just
    wanted to make sure to cover all bases -- there is still a good deal of legacy
    software around that cannot work with OpenType fonts. (I know of one pretty major
    graphing package that just refuses work with 'em.)\r\n\r\n<blockquote>.. difficulty
    with certain Mac ttf files and using them in Windows; I think they might have
    been an Apple true-type font file while the Windows ones I found transport to
    Mac fine ...</blockquote>\r\n\r\nThere used to be confusion because Apple used
    their own brand of TrueType, <em>also</em> called \"TTF\", and indeed 'twas the
    Tiny differences that made it incompatible with Windows.\r\n\r\nSince you have
    a choice: throw away the TTF and use the OTF."

  body: "The file extension doesn't determine what type of font it is. You can give
    a Type 1-flavored OpenType font a TTF extension and it will still work as usual.\r\n\r\n(I'm
    intentionally disregarding the weird Windows issue, where <em>some</em> OTF fonts
    under <em>some</em> circumstances get an OTF, and others a TTF icon, totally unrelated
    to its actual contents.)"

  body: "Ok, though would most vendors stick to the file conventions if they supply
    both?\r\n\r\nIs there any way of telling on Mac OS what outlines an OTF file has?
    (in windows the preview tells you what outlines are there, but I can't find anything
    similar on the Mac. InDesign seems to just have an 'o' icon next to both T1 and
    TT opentype fonts)"

    sure the free Font Explorer X do it).

  body: "On a Mac the easiest way to tell is by selecting the font and checking for
    information (File/Get Info or cmd+i).\r\n\r\n<li> OpenType fonts with Postscript
    outlines will show up as, \"Postscript\xAE OpenType\xAE font\". </li>\r\n<li>
    OpenType fonts with TrueType outlines, Windows TrueType, TrueType Collections
    and some Apple TrueType fonts come up as, \"TrueType Font\". </li>\r\n<li> Apple
    TrueType \".dfont\" fonts come up as, \"Data fork resource Font\". </li>\r\n\r\nIf
    you have an OpenType font with Postscript outlines and the file extension \".otf\"
    and change that extension to \".ttf\" the description will change to \"TrueType
    Font\" even though nothing else about the font has changed and it still retains
    Postscript outlines."
