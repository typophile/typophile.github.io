  fonts; could people state some of their favourites aside from the usual and much
  loved work-horse courier!?\r\n\r\nI shall begin by stating that my favourite is
  Pica 10 pitch! Look out for the lc 't'.\r\n\r\nI will try and post some pics at
  a later date\r\n\r\nthank you thank you\r\n\r\n"

  body: I quite like Luc de Groot's <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consolas>Consolas</a>
    in Windows Vista (what I'm using to type this in right now). His design makes
    it far easier for me to read than most monospaced fonts, but it doesn't pretend
    to be proportional like some monospaced fonts do nowadays.

    there are enough bad sci-fi writers to imagine a present with blogs <STRONG>and</STRONG>
    typewriters. Maybe some big-brotheresque ban on laser printers due to a requirement
    that all printed material be produced in triplicate on carbon paper, hence requiring
    impact printers.  "
