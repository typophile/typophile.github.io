  hyphenations above and under the line you\u2019re working on. Anybody working with
  books/magazines with experience on this? Maybe the solution is to have two different

  with paragraph comp?"

  body: "(Note: I'm a book compositor.)\r\n\r\nIt takes a while to get use to, and
    to trust, a paragraph optimization routine.\r\n\r\nFirst of all, the basic decision
    you as a typesetter have to make is whether hyphenation is most important to you,
    or the evenness of word spacing. With most programs, you have to pick one as *most
    important*. Then, depending of the sophistication of the text-handling portion
    of the program, you can shade towards \"equal emphasis.\" AFAIK, TeX has the most
    control over these compromises. InDesign has less, especially as manipulating
    the hyphenation dictionary is a problem (at least, in versions CS2 and CS3).\r\n\r\nAll
    right. If controlling hyphenation is most important to you, you are probably better
    off to use the single line composer. If controlling the evenness of word spacing
    is most important to you, use paragraph optimization routines (paragraph composer
    in InDesign).\r\n\r\nThe way to control hyphenation when using the paragraph composer
    is to make liberal use of the nobreak feature (not the nobreak space), and the
    discretionary hyphen (Shift+Control+-). Once you have told ID not to break somewhere,
    or that *here* (i.e., an explicit discretionary hyphen) is the only acceptable
    hyphenation point, it will honor that. But if in the end controlling hyphenation
    is most important to you, use the single line composer.\r\n\r\nAnother thing I
    have found is that for setting extended text with the paragraph composer, it is
    wise to take the time to run some tests with the min-ideal wordspace. For some
    fonts, and for some measures, 80-100-XXX is not ideal. There is also a slider
    in the *hyphenation* part of the paragraph style which offers some control over
    the compromise between spacing and hyphenation.\r\n\r\nGood luck."
