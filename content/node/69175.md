  \"A\" letter. It cost 250 euros to buy, so I'm hoping if I could find a similar
  font to Allumi PTF.\r\n\r\nhttp://cdn.ilovetypography.com/img/2010/01/allumi-ptf.png\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/allumi-ptf_4326.png]\r\n\r\nWould
  be great to hear from anyone who has recommendation for a similar curved \"A\" font
  that's free for download. \r\n\r\nThank you!\r\n\r\n "

    instead of asking for a free alternative. \r\n\r\nI think JFP would also appreciate
    that."

    You\u2019lll never get the quality type for free. Drawing fonts takes way to much
    time and energy."

  body: "(Thanks for your support Tomi! we agree.)\r\n\r\ncufflinks: The price start
    at 210 euros (not 250 euros) for 6 weights including very large glyph set, many
    OpenType features. Considering the fact that its quite a new family, it still
    not very widely used, its a valuable purchase for you and your client.\r\n\r\nPerhaps
    you can at least try the Dingbats font available here: http://allumi.typofonderie.com/free-dingbats-font\r\n\r\nIn
    a distance future (probably before the summer), we will publish the Std version,
    starting at 140 euros. I can't confirm anything yet, but if you have time\u2026\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nps.
    Perhaps we should suggest to don't paid you too, as you're \"really too expensive,\"
    or propose an online free resources for very nice graphic jobs instead? ;)"

  body: "JFP, if $210 is out of cufflink's budget, would he/she be able to purchase
    a single weight from you at a lower price? It may not be free, but could be a
    good compromise.\r\n\r\nOther than that, I can just repeat what the others have
    said. With fonts, if you want quality, you (generally) have to pay for it.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.fontsquirrel.com/
    seems to have free fonts that are higher quality than other free sites. Just make
    sure you check the licence on the font you're downloading to make sure it's free
    for your intended use.\r\n\r\n - Lex"

    weights will be available. Fonts are ready, so probably the summer we will launch
    them?\r\n\r\nWith the help of European economic troubles, Euro is lower now: http://www.typofonderie.com/gazette/hot_news/?id=446\r\n:)"

  body: "Jean Fran\xE7ois Porchez, if there is a free online resource for a very nice
    graphics job and it suits your needs then it would make sense to use it instead
    of paying Tomi.  Just like if there's a free font that suits Tomi's needs he would
    be a fool to pay you for your fonts. Your post is very bad PR and I know I'll
    do my best to steer clear of any fonts created by Jean Fran\xE7ois Porchez."
