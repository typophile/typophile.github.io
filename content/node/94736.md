    of the point of connection between these letters and adjacent forms minimising
    lifts of the pen. So, for instance, the f connects at the x-height, so the writer
    needs to move from the bottom of the descending stroke back to the x-height, hence
    the characteristic loop.  The r, conversely, connects from the bottom, so the
    pen needs to come down before rising to the next letter, creating the overall
    n-like construction (but not really like an n in the same script)."

    the work that is now being done that directly maps the phenomena of writing to
    those of linguistics, finding both obvious parallels and, in the process, uncovering
    less obvious one that expand our understanding of the ''grammar'' of writing.
    The key is that both language and writing are phenomenal: their is no uninstantiated
    text any more than there is uninstantiated speech. If you start going down the
    Platonist path with regard to ''ideas'' of letters, you may as well go all the
    way down the ''philosophical language'' rabbit hole, which is doubtless an entertaining
    journey but it doesn''t tell you anything about the phenomenal world. The shapes
    of our letters reflect the shapes that have been made at particular places and
    times by particular people using particular tools working within text cultures
    that encouraged particular conventions according to criteria of competence and
    performance.'

    Are they all ignorant too? Nobody has to agree with anybody completely (in fact
    that would be boring); but pretending somebody you disagree with on some things
    has absolutely nothing to contribute only makes you weaker. For example I'm quite
    unlikely to recommend Michael's fonts, but I would be quite unwise to ignore everything
    he says.\r\n\r\nJohn, since you're not an emotional spaz I have to think either
    I'm explaining my view poorly or you're being unduly and uncharacteristically
    intransigent. Or both! Let me try this: at their origins letters are made not
    by undirected movements of the hand, they come from a structure in the mind of
    the maker, a structure previously seen -or at least imagined- in the \"real world\".
    For example in Hangul the various elements are renderings of the mouth and tongue
    when making the given sound. And the ox that's supposed to be the origin of the
    Latin \"A\" was not made by a human hand! I'm not sure how anybody could logically
    limit the way letters look to a human's right hand (especially one holding a specific
    marking tool) instead of seeing the hand as simply one historically relevant factor
    in the end-result.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "Hrant, I do understand what you're getting at , but a) I think you are wrong
    and b) as you might remember the shorter and pithier you try to make your pronouncements
    the more likely I am to respond grumpily. When you take the time to express your
    thinking, we all do better.\r\n\r\nThe ox-to-A example you give seems to me a
    very good illustration of my point, which is that writing systems typically evolve
    in the phenomenon of writing (leaving aside 'conscripts', which are classified
    parallel to 'conlangs' and contra 'natural' or 'organic' scripts for good reason).
    There was no 'idea of an A as an ox' that gave shape to our letter. Rather, there
    was a drawing of an ox that symbolised an ox and later a phoneme associated with
    an ox, and which through being written many, many times, on particular substrates
    with particular tools, became the shape of our letter A. There is no process other
    than writing that explains the gradual rotation of the letter, or the gradual
    conventionalisation of its proportions and its modulation; indeed, the very gradualness
    of these evolutions is evidence of the lack of an 'idea' behind the shape. The
    idea of the ox is gone long before the letter A takes its conventional form, and
    there isn't any need to replace the ox with another idea because once writing
    is instantiated -- and there is no uninstantiated writing -- it is the thing itself.\r\n\r\nI've
    never sought to 'limit the way letters look to a human's right hand ... holding
    a specific marking tool', and I think type design even before the advent of digital
    outline formats had introduced a number of innovatory ways of both making letters
    and also thinking about letter shapes. <em>But</em> with few exceptions our writing
    systems are inherited, and they are inherited from writing, which is to say from
    an historical process that involves both invention and convention but that expresses
    both through an <em>act.</em>\r\n\r\nIf I had to summarise this disagreement,
    I would counter your statement that the shapes of letters begin as ideas by suggesting
    that letters are shapes to which ideas may be applied. As I think you know, I
    am a fan of a number of typeface designs of recent years that clearly involve
    the application of ideas to letter shapes -- Legato being only the most obvious;
    also several of Jeremy Tankard's designs (but not Fenland, which I take as evidence
    that the idea is not enough) --, but I think is it ahistorical to suggest that
    because we can approach letters in this way that this is how they evolved. The
    overwhelming evidence of palaeography is that writing systems evolve, unsurprisingly,
    through writing and are mostly shaped by tools, media and the practical considerations
    of text creation.\r\n\r\n___\r\n\r\nPS. I've never been wholly convinced by the
    relationship of Hangul shapes to the vocal system, nor do I think this rationalisation
    is either cognitively or graphically significant in terms of the evolution of
    the script. There are many cultures in which people believe their writing systems
    to be uniquely scientific or rational -- almost as many as believe their writing
    systems to have divine or magical origins --, whereas in my experience palaeography
    tells much the same story all over the world."

    of simple alphabetic scripts like the Latin, Greek, and Cyrillic can point out
    that Korean requires more complicated typewriters.\r\n\r\nBut since Alexander
    Graham Bell's \"Visible Speech\" shows it is possible to model letter shapes on
    the positions of the vocal organs, I see no reason to doubt the claim that this
    was also done consciously in the design of Hangul. I would have expected that
    if the forms don't have the claimed relationship, this would have been noticed,
    and the claim falsified."

  body: 'The relationship of Hangul jamo, and hence syllables, to the articulatory
    positions of the human mouth is detailed in the <em>Hunmin jeong-eum haerye</em>
    of 1446, which is certainly close enough to the date of the invention of Hangul
    for it to be taken seriously as something other than a post facto rationalisation.
    I said I wasn''t <em>wholly</em> convinced, but perhaps should clarify that I
    accept that there is a systematic relationship between classes of sign and classes
    of articulation; I''m not convinced that the actual shapes of the signs represent
    the shapes of the mouth or, at least, that the a different set of shapes wouldn''t
    provide at least as good or better representation. Indeed, if the latter wasn''t
    the case, Bell''s ''Visible Speech'' might look more like Hangul jamo than it
    does. And, again, I don''t think there is any cognitive or graphical benefit to
    such a system: it has nothing to do with the activities of either reading or writing.'
