  body: Found an old GarageFonts catalog, and I remember how much I love this family,
    despite its amateurish quirks. Now that he's matured, I hope Joshua remodels and
    reissues it. For posterity, those seeking Profundis should probably contact [[GarageFonts]]
    or [[Joshua Darden]] directly. If you're looking for alternates, there really
    isn't anything that comes close, but Barnbrook's <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/fontcase/super_families/priori/">Priori</a>,
    <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/fontcase/super_families/mason/">Mason</a>, and
    <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/virus_fonts/tourette/">Tourette</a>
    have similarities in their ornament. The Sans and Serif are based on classical
    models so faces in the <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/fontcase/alternatives/optima/">Optima</a>
    and <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/fontcase/alternatives/trajan/">Trajan</a>
    genres could work as replacements.

  body: "Profundis is a gorgeous concept. I have been waiting for years for Josh to
    finish the super black weights. I think it would seriously take off in popularity
    if it were ever spruced up and put back out for public consumption.\r\n\r\nI'm
    a fan of these Barnbrook faces, too, some beautifully modeled on unexpected architectural
    forms. But Profundis was my first Darden swoonfest and, as Stephen says, there's
    really nothing like it.\r\n\r\n*note to Stewf: my love for letterforms is strictly
    pure and innocent, I assure you!"
