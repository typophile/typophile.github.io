    a generic sans with serifs manually added. [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/itf-alanmeeks/astoria|Astoria]]

    matches almost everything but /N and /O are less extended (easy to fix for /O,
    less for /N). Some more similars (need customization rounding some corners, cutting
    some finials, extending some crossbars or redrawing some glyphs from others):
    [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/marksimonson/changeling-neo|Changelling Neo]] (bowlers
    off), [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/cheapprofonts/bitsumishi-pro-v2|Bitsumishi]]
    (best /O but rest is way off), [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/typodermic/neuropol-x|Neuropol
    X]] (/O off, cutting some finials), [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/typodermic/pirulen|Pirulen]]
    (nice base but needs many tweakings), [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/typodermic/good-times|Good
    Times]] (very close but /O off), [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/flat-it/stereo-gothic|Stereo
    Gothic]], [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/typodermic/sui-generis|Sui Generis]]'
