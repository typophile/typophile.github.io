  body: I just kern them all, it is easier than figuring out which ones to leave out.  I
    also make a narrower set of diacritics used only on the "i" glyphs. I make special
    kerning classes for crashable glyphs to minimize the job..

    that example, Brian. Looks like I won't need any f\xEF kerning at all, but then
    the f of this typeface is very modest.\r\n"

  body: "An analogous problem in Cyrillic: \"\u0457\u0457\" is a fairly common word
    in Ukrainian, and the combination \"\u0456\u0457\" also occurs frequently.\r\n\r\nIn
    French, conjugations of the verb \"faire\" include \"f\xEEt\", \"f\xEEmes\", and
    \"f\xEEtes\".\r\n\r\nPinyin for Mandarin with tone marks poses no problems, as
    the combination \"fi\" does not occur.\r\n\r\nEdited to add: If, as suggested
    in your image sample, you consider such diacritics next to <em>straight</em> ascenders
    to be potentially problematic, then to say that you have lots more problem pairs
    to look at would be an understatement. In French we have \"\xEEle\" and \"Tha\xEFlande\"
    just off the top of my head. I wouldn't normally consider them problem pairs,
    though."

    personally don't think such merging is a good idea, for Swedish at least, and

  body: "Jens, your observation is correct. Swedes generally don't use \"ae\" or \"oe\"
    when \"\xE4\" and \"\xF6\" are not available (\"Anja P\xE4rson\" being known internationally
    as \"Anja Paerson\" is a noteable exception, although there the motivation may
    have been to avoid the spelling \"Parson\"). Neither do they use \"aa\" when \"\xE5\"
    is not available, although I understand Danes might do so. Interestingly, Swedes
    may go pseudo-Norwegian and use \"e\" instead of \"\xE4\".\r\n\r\nMy interpretation
    is that the regular and systematic connection between \"a o u\" and \"\xE4 \xF6
    \xFC\" is very alive in the minds of German speakers, so that given technical
    limitations, they find it imperative to at least fall back to indicating them
    as digraphs \"ae oe ue\", where the added \"e\" takes place of the umlaut diacritic.
    But this sort of connection doesn't exist for Swedish speakers, for whom \"\xE5\",
    \"\xE4\" and \"\xF6\" are indivisible units. They will use a similar-looking or
    similar-sounding letter to replace each of these if necessary, but not a pair
    of letters as the Germans do.\r\n\r\nTechnical explanation about my assertion:\r\n\r\nUmlauting
    refers to a phenomenon affecting vowels in Germanic languages (including German,
    Swedish, and English) where vowels for certain forms are fronted. In English you
    have man/men, foot/feet, mouse/mice, etc. In German, the spelling uses the umlaut
    diacritic to make this linguistic phenomenon very visible. Hence you have Mann/M\xE4nner,
    Fu\xDF/F\xFC\xDFe, and Maus/M\xE4use; i.e. you have a systematic correspondence
    between the original and the umlauted vowel in German spelling.\r\n\r\nSwedish
    borrowed \"\xE4\" and \"\xF6\" from German, I believe, and in some instances the
    umlauting correspondence holds, e.g. man/m\xE4n, fot/f\xF6tter. But the Swedish
    variation of the linguistic phenomenon of umlauting being different from that
    of German, there are countless examples like mus/m\xF6ss, l\xE5ng/l\xE4ngre (long/longer),
    and falla/f\xF6ll (fall/fell) to demonstrate that there is no systematic correspondence
    in Swedish spelling as in German. So whatever connection the umlauted vowels had
    with the original counterparts in German, from which these letters were originally
    borrowed, is completely lost in the minds of Swedish speakers."

    are very much pronounced like their German counterparts in Swedish. \r\n\r\nThe
    examples just show that the vowel sometimes changes in words when going from singular
    to plural. In Danish, some of the examples would be mand/m\xE6nd, fod/f\xF8dder,
    lang/l\xE6ngere and I could add barn/b\xF8rn (child/children)."

  body: "Elias, of course the pronunciations are similar because the letters were
    borrowed for their sounds. That's not what I am talking about. By \"whatever connection
    the umlauted vowels had with the original counterparts in German\" I mean the
    connection between \"a\" and \"\xE4\", \"o\" and \"\xF6\", and \"u\" and \"\xFC\"
    in the minds of German speakers.\r\n\r\nIn German, there is a systematic correspondence
    between these pairs. But this relationship is not well preserved in Swedish, whose
    own <em>omljud</em> has developed rather differently. The past tense of \"falla\"
    is not *\"f\xE4ll\" but \"f\xF6ll\". In fact, \"\xF6\" can alternate with not
    just \"o\" but \"a\" (falla/f\xF6ll), \"u\" (ljuga/lj\xF6g), and \"y\" (bryta/br\xF6t),
    so Swedes are not likely to pair \"o\" and \"\xF6\" in their minds like Germans
    do.\r\n\r\nFor Danish, shouldn't the plural of \"barn\" be *\"b\xE6rn\" according
    to the strict German-style a/\xE6, o/\xF8 paradigm? Well, it isn't. This is my
    point: the linguistic phenomenon of Germanic umlauting and the orthographical
    representation of it using the umlaut diacritic matches up well only for German."

    pronounciation). I suppose you're right on that one, but maybe we can hear some
    Swedes/Germans about their opinion. Anyone?\r\n"

    <em>\xE4</em>, <em>\xF6</em> I think was more common back in the early days of
    computing and internet, when need sometimes arose to actually write rather long
    texts without the proper letters. In such cases I guess unambiguity takes precedence
    over aesthetics. Nowadays there is rarely any reed to resort to this except in
    shorter texts such as e-mail addresses. My Typophile user name is <em>Mans</em>,
    though I could probably just as well have used the correct <em>M\xE5ns</em>. :)"
