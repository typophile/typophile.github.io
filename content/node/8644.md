body: If we were to frame a Constitution for Typophile, what would it read?   <BR>   <BR>What
  truths do <i>you</i> hold self-evident?    <BR>   <BR>Which do <i>you</i> consider
  to be your inalienable rights?   <BR>   <BR>In essence, what should Typophile stand
  for, and what should be some basic guidelines for conduct? Do we even need such
  a thing?

  body: I don&#39;t want to impede any such clearly noble efforts, but I for one feel
    it&#39;s misguided. I don&#39;t want or need a constitution. I gladly relinquish
    all decisions concerning matters of state to our two benign kings, Jared Benson
    and Joseph Pemberton. This, in order to better concentrate on matters of <i>type</i>.
    If/when kings get overly abusive, they get overthrown - that <i>is</i> the least
    unfair system - and I will fight furiously for my freedom <i>from</i> choice,
    reserving only the right to self-determination. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>

    see the &#34;reason&#34; for your post. <BR> <BR>~Doh~ <BR> <BR>bj <BR> <BR>fwiw,
    the name Constitution...maybe Code of Conduct sounds less official and/or constraining.

  body: Again I find myself in the embarassing position of agreeing with Hrant. I
    must be spending too much time here. <BR> <BR>Jared and Joe <b>own</b> this thing.
    It&#39;s <b>theirs.</b> Those not satisfied with their policies should look elsewhere.
    Typophile is not a government. It does not levy taxes backed by the threat of
    force. Therefore what happened is, by definition, not &#34;censorship.&#34; Those
    who think it is don&#39;t know what real censorship is. <BR> <BR>Even Hrant agrees
    with the &#34;censorship&#34; he received. <BR> <BR>Removing the f-word from posts
    keeps this site accessible to kids in schools, where often there is filtering
    software that would otherwide make it inaccessible for linking to inappropriate
    content.  If you still feel unable to express your thoughts without obscenity,
    you should consider a prescription for Thorazine or Haloperidol. <BR> <BR>I consider
    it a privelage to be alllowed to post here, and with privelages come responsibilities.
    &#34;Rights&#34; don&#39;t figure in here, beyond the normal rights to credit
    card privacy and whatnot.

    could block this forum suposing is something similar to <a href="http://www.erowid.com"
    target="_blank">www.erowid.com</a>, haha. <BR> <BR>Anyway, In spite of I prefer
    unmoderated forums and, in my opinion, there should be a moderator for moderators;
    I like very much Typophile and my objections don&#39;t worth an argument.  '

    We are all adults, aren&#39;t we? But if necessary, I think it is a good idea.

  body: The ONLY times we&#39;ve ever had to consider a formal  <BR>constitution or
    code of conduct have been after a given  <BR>user&#39;s &#39;run-ins&#39; with
    usually anonymous people. This  <BR>latest episode is no different than the ones
    in the past.  <BR>&#40;Except this latest episode is tame by comparison.&#41;
    <BR> <BR>The bottom line is, it&#39;s okay to disagree. Hey, we  <BR>encourage
    it. It&#39;s what makes this place healthy.  <BR> <BR>Unfortunately, in the past,
    when we&#39;ve had to moderate  <BR>posts it has created the perception that we
    agree with  <BR>the user that happens to be registered. This has never  <BR>been
    our intent. All users, both registered and anony- <BR>mous, are subject to the
    same rules. We moderate the  <BR>post, not the user. <BR>
