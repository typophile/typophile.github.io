  body: Ahem. <BR>I&#39;m sorry, but I don&#39;t think Projekt is a match. <BR>It&#39;s
    hard to tell from a rotated sample, but I think I can see some differences &#40;weight,
    proportions, contrast&#41;... <BR>Of course, Projekt is a good suggestion indeed.

    in providing him with the service he expected. <BR>Now, if <i>you</i> want to

    I&#39;m looking for a different font, has anyone got another suggestion? <BR>
    <BR>thanks in advance

    target="_blank">Congress Sans</a>?  It may be a bit too square, but it is worth
    looking at, perhaps. <BR>

  body: Tgadiot &#40;?&#41;, if you only need those &#34;c&#34;s, why don&#39;t  <BR>you
    redraw them on Illustrator or something? <BR>If you really need the typeface,
    I presume you have  <BR>a better sample to show us, too? I mean, something  <BR>showing
    other letters...

    Cs don&#39;t match. Maybe another FF?

  body: I was way too hasty.  The angle on the top of the upright of the n is all
    wrong for Congress Sans.  Sorry!  &#40;Not ready to play with the big kids, yet!&#41;
