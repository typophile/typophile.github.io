  body: "I think those slight differences might be artifacts from the way this was
    scanned. To me they seem too consistent to be freehand lettering. Maybe that's
    just because I can't letter that consistently and be casual at the same time.\r\n\r\nDo
    the letters seem any more identical on the original card?\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
