body: "[img:sites/default/files/old-images/givry1_4667.jpg]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe b\xE2tarde
  flamande is a style of writing used predominantly in France and present-day Belgium
  in the 15th century. The style shares an ancestry with other writing styles traditionally
  grouped as blackletter\u2014fraktur, textura, rotunda, and schwabacher. It had evolved,
  however, into an \xE6sthetic far removed from its relatives.\r\n\r\nWhile high-contrast
  in nature, the b\xE2tarde flamande is more delicate and dynamic than the austere
  and condensed fraktur and textura. Quick curves lack the rigidity of the schwabacher
  and rotunda. Flair through swashes is thematic, as are the variations in letterforms.\r\n\r\nThe
  flowing rhythm, achieved through a letterform axis that is overall slightly rightward,
  is most noticable in the hallmark f and long s. Round forms are fused together for
  economy of space. It is a writing hand that, with its syncopation and fluidity,
  produces a vibrance uncharacteristic of other blackletters.\r\n\r\nWhile suitable
  as an elegant and energetic display face, Givry was conceived for setting continuous
  text. The result of many refinements and adjustments is the preservation of the
  style\u2019s irregular nature, as well as a consistency that continuous-text typography
  requires. Carefully researched and developed in OpenType format for a wealth of
  typographic features and support for more than forty languages, Givry is neither
  derivative nor experimental, but historically accurate. \r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/givry2_5549.jpg]\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/givry3_3766.jpg]\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/givry4_4623.jpg]\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/givry5_3510.jpg]\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/givry6_6520.jpg]\r\n"

  body: In terms of writing technique, how are the hairline strokes in the capitals
    created? I'm guessing, by looking at that D, that the pen is tilted so that only
    the corner of the nib is used. If so, this is a nice European example of the technique
    that is central to the nasta'liq style of Perso-Arabic script, which I think may
    constitute a 4th stroke construction model in a Noordzijan analysis.

    the loop), which is vertically crossing the D, but without a change of the width.\r\n\r\nGivry
    is really great. Pure beauty, but very legible. But according to the info on the

    is likewise impressive. Unfortunately on a very different price level. [Both typefaces
    are very different.])"

    created? I'm guessing, by looking at that D, that the pen is tilted so that only
    the corner of the nib is used.</em>\r\n\r\nYes, that's the technique, and one
    that is surprisingly common in European tradition. It can be seen in everything
    from 6th cen. rustics to gothics from 1000 years later. Some b\xE2tardes use it
    gloriously, and usually with a gradual thinning of stroke, which brings up:\r\n\r\n<em>Following
    on John Hudson's question, how does a pen come up with this shape?</em>\r\n\r\nIt
    is said that most b\xE2tardes were written with a very flexible pen (quill), and
    so the thinning of these strokes are due to a release of pressure. That's not
    always the case, as very fine b\xE2tardes can be written even with a stiffer broad
    pen. In those cases the thinning is typically due to a lifting of one side of
    the pen. It doesn't usually require a twisting technique, although that can be
    in the mix.\r\n\r\nThis lifting is particularly effective when writing fast strokes.
    B\xE2tarde, with all its mannerisms, is thought to have been written slowly. That's
    probably true of the more florid, formal examples, but as a cursive gothic it
    really developed with speed and practicality in mind. That meant less twisting,
    fewer strokes, more connections, etc. Here are two quick examples of strokes written
    at a relatively high speed with a very stiff pen and a constant pen angle - the
    first one shows lifting of the right side of the nib, whereas the second is done
    with a quick downward flick of the wrist, effectively lifting the <em>left</em>
    corner.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/thinning_4160.jpg]\r\n\r\nBTW
    - well done Tom!\r\n"
