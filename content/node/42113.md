  \r\n\r\n\r\nI'm so curious about how to make them. \r\n\r\nIn terms of Computer
  Graphics, is the 'Spiral Font' created in 3d environments??? \r\n\r\nlet me know
  please...\r\n\r\n\r\nIt's difficult to make a contact on the site for one reason
  or another. \r\nIn other words, every single answer here will be helpful to me.
  \r\n\r\n\r\n~^_____^~\r\n\r\n\r\nThank you for your favor about reading of my poor
  English~\r\n\r\n"

    this... \r\n\r\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spirograph \r\n\r\n...or a digital
    equivalent - alternately you can approximate it using the blend feature in vector
    drawing apps. "

    book once at the main public library over here focusing on 3-dimensional applications
    of fonts. The one I remember most was someone's interpretation of Univers where
    the characters had been revolved and manipulated in other three dimensional ways
    to produce some amazing forms. Perhaps someone else knows the book and can provide
    the name..?\r\n\r\n-Rafe"
