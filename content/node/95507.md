body: "I'm designing a display face in Fontlab, and I'm only creating uppercase letters.
  I planned on finishing the uppercase letters (metric and kerning included) and then
  just copy them to the lowercase letter spots so the same A shows up whether you
  type a or A.\r\n\r\nHowever, it doesn't seem like metric and kerning data gets included
  when I copy and paste letters. I don't know much about Fontlab, but I would've thought
  I could somehow copy this data. Any ideas?"

  body: "@HVB: I didn't even think about aV, av, and Av... that introduces a whole
    new problem...\r\n\r\n@John Hudson: Thanks, this worked! Using paste special and
    selecting left and right kerning option works beautifully.\r\n\r\n@Quadrat: I've
    never messed with OT features, and regardless I think this font is ultimately
    going to be a TTF. For some reason when I generate the font it looks very wrong
    when I export as an OpenType font, but fine when I choose TrueType. The characters
    are very complex so I'm sure I could just be doing something incorrect when generating
    the font, but for now it looks like I'll have to stick with TTF.\r\n\r\n@Theunis:
    Didn't even know you could do that! Seems a little complicated for me, but I'll
    look into it."

  body: For all-caps fonts, I find double-encoding the glyphs to be more convenient
    during development, even if I end up expanding them at the end. Since the "lowercase"
    is literally the same as the uppercase, it doesn't matter which one you edit/kern/etc.,
    and there's no need to worry about case when navigating or typing out test strings.
    Then if I'm feeling especially standards-compliant, before generating I can run
    a macro that creates properly-encoded lowercase copies and adds them to appropriate
    kerning classes.
