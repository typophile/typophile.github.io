body: 'What was supposed to be a once-off student magazine has received enough funding
  for a second issue... but the original designer has gone AWOL with all the InDesign
  files. The front cover title was done using this distorted font, which nobody still
  working on the mag can identify. Using something similar but different seems to
  be our only option, unless anyone can help us? '

    Illustrator effect applied to it. AI has filters you can use to make things look
    "scribbled". '
