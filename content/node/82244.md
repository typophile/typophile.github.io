    Modern</a> is a didone, but other than that, not much like Storm's Walbaum, which
    seems more like an old-style face, with its low contrast, heaviness, and simple
    terminals.\r\n\r\nBut the Scotch Modern does have a similar \"historically authentic\"
    quality to Storm's Walbaum, both being conceived as micro-detailed facsimiles
    of the letterpress impression (informed by press gain and other traces of the
    printing process), rather than as cleaned-up, reductive revivals.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    end up buying at least a couple of fonts, if only to complement my collection
    of beautiful typefaces.\r\n\r\nMaxim, I never intended to judge the quality of
    Walbaum, Cyrillic-typography-wise; this was merely a comment on its glyph coverage.
    Do you have any suggestions for a similarly extensive typeface with a more native
    feel?"
