body: Well, what would be some of your ideas on pairing Fedra Serif, with a script,
  or more decorative display face? Ideas? <BR> <BR>on a different note, how do you
  think Sabath would work used in a trade mark, and using Fedra as body text? <BR>

  body: 'Fedra is a bit idiosyncratic already - maybe a more docile display face would
    match it better? <BR>But something contemporary, not a grot - I guess a dark &#40;and
    maybe wide&#41; humanist sans. <BR> <BR>I think a logo in Sabbath &#40;Newlyn&#39;s,
    right?&#41; might work really well with Fedra. <BR> <BR>If you can get J&uuml;rgen
    Weltin&#39;s Yellow font &#40;attached&#41; for display, that would rule: it has
    some blackletter overtones, and a wonderful synthetic feel, just like Bilak&#39;s
    work. <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/4100/19926.gif"

  body: Hrant -- <BR> <BR>Sorry should have been more clear -- emigres Sabbath Black,
    that stylistic blackletter face. <BR>I&#39;m quite fond of that face. <BR> <BR>Your
    other titling suggestions are quite nice too.

  body: '&#62;or more decorative display face <BR>I don&#39;t know if it will work,
    but Sauna &#40;perhaps bold italic&#41; from Underware has a large x-height and
    fat serifs like Fedra Serif, so it is worth looking at if your project is suited
    to its jolly informality and wonderful balance.   '

  body: Tiffany -- Serif A, used for body text. <BR> <BR>William -- I do like Sauna,
    but for the very &#39;classic&#39; look I am trying to acheive, I don&#39;t think
    it ould be a good fit. <BR> <BR>I&#39;m really looking for something very decorative,
    so for Chapter titles &#40;even though this is not a book atmosphere&#41;. <BR>Really
    a script is what I have in mind, something like Bickham, but not. ;&#41; <BR>
