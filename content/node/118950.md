body: "I'm working on a typeface I've been working on for a year and I'm nearly done.
  Today I added a few more kerning classes and kerned hundreds of kerning pairs. I
  spent hours on it today and I was excited to be done and generate the font and I
  get an error stating I can't generate the font because some glyphs used in the feature
  file were not found in the font.\r\n\r\nNow, this seems an easy problem to fix.
  I just don't know how. Can someone tell me what I need to be looking at? Today I
  replaced a few characters and added some kerning classes in both Bold and Light
  and I get the same error in both versions so I'm quite sure the problem is in one
  of the kerning classes.\r\n\r\nAs far as I can remember these are the classes I
  added:\r\n_a.ss01: a' a.ss01 aacute.ss01 acircumflex.ss01 adieresis.ss01 agrave.ss01
  aring.ss01 atilde.ss01\r\n_i: i' iacute icircumflex idieresis igrave imacron iogonek
  iring dotlessi\r\n_y: y' yacute ycircumflex ydieresis ygrave\r\n_period: period'
  comma colon semicolon ellipsis\r\n_question: question' question.ss03\r\n_copy: copyright'
  registered\r\n\r\nIs there a typo somewhere or am I doing something wrong? How can
  I check which glyphs are supposedly missing from the font?"

  body: Check spelling in the feature file, especially of alternate characters you
    may have added. Also make absolutely sure that everything you may have added to
    the feature file really does exist in the font. That's what the error message
    is about, so it is either spelling or one or more glyphs really are missing.

  body: "Is there no way to let \"it\" tell me which glyphs it's missing? It seems
    ridiculous that I have to check all glyphs while it very well knows where things
    are going wrong. FontLab and their vague error messages...\r\n\r\nI know that
    when you add glyphs to OT while they're not actually in the font, FontLab will
    ask if you want to create these extra glyphs. Why can't it do that now?\r\n\r\nWhere
    can I get the feature file? I forgot."

  body: Thanks a lot. I found the mistake simply by compiling in the OpenType section
    and FontLab told me the iring (obviously) doesn't exist. I copied other strings
    of accented characters (in this case probably the u-accented characters) into
    the class for the i-accented characters and simply replaced the starting letter
    so I don't have to retype 'circumflex' and all that and forgot to remove the iring.
