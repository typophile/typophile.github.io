body: I've been making fonts for a while now and I'm starting to see them in the wild
  more often. I've bought books I'll never read, women's magazines, greetings cards,
  tshirts, and most recently, biscuits, solely because they use my fonts. This practice
  could get expensive! What have you bought just because it has your font on it?

    really nice and my font being on them was only a tiny nudge towards buying them.
    I'm getting better though - the novelty has worn off a little and I don't buy
    stuff when I don't think they've used my font properly ;)"

  body: "Wait! I am confused.\r\n\r\nAre people bragging about all the stupid ways
    that THEY PERSONALLY spent their hard-earned dough, or is this some kind of blanket
    condemnation of mindless consumer consumption?\r\n\r\nNot that it matters to me
    but, if someone is going to call<em> themselves</em> a moron in a public internet
    forum, I feel compelled\u2014<em>noblesse oblige</em>, and all\u2014to agree with
    them, in the most emphatic manner which is socially and politically correct. Because
    that's the kinda guy I am: the right tool for the right job. Kinda like Craigslist\u2014except
    everyone knows the rules upfront.\r\n\r\nIn fact, depending on the openly-offered
    evidence of their self-proclaimed and indubitably egregious stupidity, I might
    find myself\u2014without recourse and in good conscience\u2014FORCED to agree,
    AND in terms of such a superlative nature as to defy belief! Even if it means
    that I MUST declare a New World Champion!\r\n\r\nUnless I am mistaken about the
    premises\u2026which, IMHO, I am clearly not\u2026\r\n"

  body: "Mindless consumer consumption?\r\nI see it more like sticking your kid's
    drawing on the fridge door. Probably for you the novelty has worn off, but for
    someone like myself, just starting out, the first few times you see your font
    in the wild, that makes you proud. So buying the thing with the font on it is
    not some moronic act of mindless spending - it's acquiring yourself a keepsake,
    which in a way proves to you you're not wasting your time! And if it gives you
    an excuse to eat some nice biscuits, why not?\r\n"
