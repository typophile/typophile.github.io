body: I&#39;m fairily new to this site and have made a couple requests--one of them
  got a response that said &#34;again...&#34; meaning of course it&#39;s a very common
  request.  And I&#39;ve seen this a lot while clicking through other threads, i.e.,
  &#34;DIN, again...Eclat, again...&#34;   <BR> <BR>Obviously the board has a search
  feature, but I was wondering if there&#39;s a list somewhere with the &#34;most
  common&#34; requests.  Perhaps something for the FAQ, etc.?  Additionally, I&#39;d
  simply be curious to know what things get requested the most also. <BR> <BR>What
  a great board though.

  body: There are certain fonts and also specific items that get requested over and
    over again &#40;like the Bjork fonts or the Gucci logo&#41;. With the fonts, it
    is simply that they are popular or trendy. Or sometimes it&#39;s just a weird
    cluster. With the logos, it&#39;s people who don&#39;t bother to do a search before
    posting a request. Also the search feature isn&#39;t that good. <BR> <BR>It&#39;s
    been suggested before to make a greatest hits list  for people to check before
    they post a thread but who has the time???  <BR> <BR>Also, people who aren&#39;t
    in the design business don&#39;t necessarily know that a lot of corporate logos,
    magazine fonts, etc are custom or proprietary and therefore not available to us
    peons.

    always stay at the top? With a most-often requested thread in this place, I think
    it would help a lot.  <BR> <BR>I, too, would help in the creation of such a thread

    add Bookman swash to the list. <BR> <BR>I&#39;d also love to see a list of the
    IDs most requested &#40;like the Gucci logo&#41; - that might be particularly
    useful for first-time posters who don&#39;t know about the Advanced Search. In
    other words, &#34;Check here before you post your thread, the ID may already be
    on this list.&#34; Especially as regards proprietary or custom fonts.

    Isornorm, and Hellenic Wide.  If there was a list at the top of the board here

    many of us &#40;bookmarked foundry web sites, type specimen books, etc&#41;, not
    to mention the institutional memory of having worked with fonts for years or decades.
    I&#39;m sure some people won&#39;t want to wade through the list but they always
    have the option of just starting a thread. But I bet it will prevent some of the
    redundant requests.

    at how often we get the same &#39;what&#39;s this font?&#39; subject lines&#41;,
    I tend to agree with Franz, although an illustrated list would be much more accessible
    to even the most reluctant &#40;lazy&#41; font hunters.  <BR> <BR>You might say,
    &#39;They made some effort to get here, so maybe they would be willing to look
    through a list of common requests&#39;. My reply would be, &#39;Of course no one
    thinks their request is &#39;common&#39;, so who would look at it?&#39; &#40;You
    would probably have no way of knowing that you were requesting something commonly
    asked about.&#41; <BR> <BR>However, with so many people willing to collaborate
    in making the list, it&#39;s hard to argue against trying it.  <BR> <BR>I would
    add Neutraface to the list, and whatever everyone agrees is the best Boston Red
    Sox font these days.

    are thousands of them. Find something similar, and use it. <BR> <BR>This could
    be one a number of general notes on the Most Common Requests Page, with others

    Din, Eclat, etc. I imagined this as sort &#34;Check to see if your font is here&#34;
    thread more than a FAQ, which I think needs to be updated separately. I think
    both of these &#40;the FAQ and the image IDs&#41; threads should be permanently
    pinned at the top of the Type ID board. But that&#39;s just my opinion.

  body: Hmm. Your links go to the font sites portals, rather than straight to samples
    of the fonts in question. Most of these fonts are available at Myfonts and they
    allow you to make a link to the font family itself, easily, and to &#34;test drive&#34;  your
    font. Fontshop is a really cumbersome and slow site to navigate.  <BR> <BR>Same
    thing with the second section - I think the links should point to the logo in
    question &#40;or a previous typophile discussion on the subject&#41; rather than
    the designer&#39;s home page.  <BR> <BR>Under Sports logos I&#39;d add &#34;and
    Uniforms&#34;.  <BR> <BR>I&#39;m move Siemens to the second section.

  body: Patricia, I know that my links currently &#39;just&#39; refer to the vendors
    and not directly to the fonts themself, but some of these are available from various
    foundries.. &#40; And, Well, This may be just a &#39;beta&#39; version of this
    list, then.. <img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/plain.gif" border=0>

  body: I see your point about multiple foundries but the only way a list like this
    &#40;with links&#41; is useful is if it links to specific font showings.  <BR>
    <BR>That&#39;s my 2 cents anyway.

  body: One of the ideas yesterday was to put an image of each font on the page. That
    would avoid the issue of where to link, and make the list visual. If you don&#39;t
    know the name, how are you going to find your font on this list?  <BR> <BR>&#40;I
    vote for a full alphabet showing, not Hamburgefontsiv...&#41;

  body: Should we start making any images yet? I was about to but then I realized
    we haven&#39;t decided on what it should say &#40;which pangram to use or what
    size it should be&#41;. What about fonts that are hard to obtain like Avante Garde
    Alternates, would posting &#34;in use&#34; sample be enough? Would &#34;in use&#34;
    samples be more helpful than generated samples?

  body: Patricia - As far as I can tell, FontShop&#39;s site does everything <BR>you&#39;re
    suggesting, including linking directly to any font with <BR>a custom text sample.
    Can you describe more specifically your <BR>FontShop.com complaints? I&#39;ll
    happily crack the whip.

  body: With the Typophile relaunch looming in the very near future, let me simply
    say that we&#39;ve got something that can accommodate commonly requested/accessed
    information.  <BR> <BR>I&#39;d not recommend devising a new solution that is dependent
    on this message board... Things will be different-  <BR> <BR>jb

  body: James, In my opinion the &#34;in use&#34; samples should be used when a more
    uniform sample is not available.  <BR>I propose using the FontBook sample as a
    standard. This sample of Myriad was 30 points. I would suggest 550-600 pixel width
    as a sample size. I think smaller is not enough detail at .gif resolution. <BR><img

  body: Stephen - <BR> <BR>I stand corrected. It used to be a very difficult site
    to use &#40;in my opinion&#41; but I can see that it&#39;s been much improved.
    I hadn&#39;t been there in a while. <BR> <BR>No need for whip-cracking!

    border=0> <BR>I am really, really looking forward to that.. <BR> <BR>Mike, I also
    think that some kind of a visual font list, including samples and links to the
    related vendors would be an almost ideal solution.. &#40; At Typophile
