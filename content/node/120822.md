  body: "Compare to Jason Walcott's Cabernet [img:sites/default/files/old-images/CabernetJFAsPOWER_6593.jpg]\r\nClose,
    but not an exact match. Differences include larger serifs on _E_, no serif on
    lhs of leg on _K_,  spurs on top of _T_, more rounded counters in _B_ and _R_.
    I have not measured but letter width looks slightly wider.\r\nWorking link to
    purchase Cabernet http://marketplace.veer.com/font/Cabernet-Complete-JBT0001090\r\nDon"
