  body: How do people keep up with all these, even with RSS feeds I get overburdened.
    I pretty much stopped all my RSS feeds except a few that post news once every
    blue moon.

    I do have them in RSS. But I don't always read everything. Either I let posts
    built up for a while and go through them when I feel like it, or if I don't feel
    like it I just press 'mark all as read'. ;)"

  body: ">How do people keep up with all these, even with RSS feeds I get overburdened.\r\n\r\nI
    literally devote at least 30-45 min each day to look at sites. It is part of my
    daily work flow, mostly for trend monitoring, but when I see relevant articles,
    I will read them. After a while, you can scan sites quite quickly and pass on
    the stuff that doesn't interest/apply to what you are after."

  body: "I mainly use Twitter for all of my information gathering and feeds. Many
    sites now send their updates through it, and many individual designers that I
    follow also share links to really awesome stuff. I usually take 30 minutes to
    an hour a day just following links from my Twitter feed.\r\n\r\nBut besides that,
    I usually just check out http://www.formfiftyfive.com and... that's the only one
    I regularly check manually. Hm. Twitter has really spoiled me.\r\n\r\nI also highly
    recommend checking out the Featured Websites on Cargo Collective http://cargocollective.com/#/featured
    \u2014 amazing source of inspiration, all of the featured sites are the portfolios
    of designers, illustrators, photographers (et cetera) that are updated frequently
    when they finish new projects. There's also real nice finds like http://unurth.com/
    and http://elasticnovice.com/ in there, which are more or less art blogs."
