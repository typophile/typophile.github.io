body: 'Hi all, <BR> <BR>Background: company is a consultancy that works with rail
  operators to update,  <BR>redevelop and improve rail and bus interchanges in the
  UK. <BR> <BR>I&#39;m currently concepting for a new logo and brand for them. The
  company in question  <BR>&#40;Transport Interchange Consultants&#41; has a rather
  unwieldy name, and prefers to be  <BR>known by it&#39;s acronym, TIC, so this has
  to feature heavily in the design. <BR> <BR>I&#39;ve come up with a few ideas &#40;and
  variations on them&#41;, I&#39;ll post them all up, so any  <BR>opinions would be
  gratefully recieved on all ideas. The idea behind the mark was  <BR>to echo crossing
  tracks/roads. Apologies for the numerous files! <BR> <BR>[I can&#39;t get the image
  upload to work as the board &#39;crashes&#39; when I post, so I have  <BR>to link,
  if any mods can fix this and put the images inline I would be most grateful!&#41;

  body: I personally like 2A best. <BR>As an idea - have you tried to make the radia
    of the rounds grow from inside out? I think this could make it look more interesting...

  body: I also favour the 2 series. I prefer the full name underneath as in concept
    2 &#40;integrating it too tightly into the logo as it is on the right, may cause
    problems down the line&#41;, but it looks a little delicate, and could be risky
    in small applications &#40;assuming it will always be required&#41;. Maybe tighten
    back the tracking and increase the size? <BR> <BR>I think the balance between
    the type and the mark needs a good looking at. The mark is being overpowered,
    even by the lightest type weights. <BR> <BR>Andriy&#39;s idea might help solve
    another possible problem - that the mark may be perceived as a &#39;sparkle&#39;/lens
    flare, rather than a crossing of routes. Maybe you could give it some 3D skew
    to give the effect of it laying on the ground. Possibly not even flat - you could
    suggest a few hills. <BR> <BR> <BR>By the way, where in Manchester are you? I&#39;m
    down in Stockport right now.

  body: Thank you both for your comments. It&#39;s interesting &#40;to me anyway&#41;
    that my concept  <BR>2 is getting so much attention here; on another forum I&#39;ve
    asked for opinions on &#40;a design <BR>but non-type-specific one&#41;, concept
    3 received almost universal initial approval! It&#39;s also  <BR>interesting to
    note that the ultra black weight scored a total of zero votes, with the  <BR>designers
    preferring lighter, more balanced weights &#40;while I rather liked the ultra  <BR>black&#41;.  <BR>
    <BR>Maybe there&#39;s something about type focused people that draws us to different
    types of  <BR>design.... Anyway I digress. <BR> <BR>Andriy-- <BR>I agree that
    it would make it interesting, but I fear it would make it look like even  <BR>more
    of a &#39;starburst&#39; than it already does. If I am to lead with concept 2
    then the <BR>symbolism of the mark needs to be emphasised rather than diminished.
    Nice idea  <BR>though! <BR> <BR>Danny-- <BR>My only problem with the full name
    underneath is that the &#39;consultants&#39; bit gets a  <BR>little lost trailing
    off. The length of the name is a real pain when trying to set it  <BR>with such
    a short acronym! We all love a challenge though eh? <BR> <BR>The balance is something
    that&#39;s a serious issue with the 2 series, as the mark is so <BR>light. I love
    the idea of skewing it and making it look like it&#39;s running over terrain,  <BR>though
    to be honest, I wouldn&#39;t know where to start. I&#39;m not a &#39;3D&#39; guy!
    <BR> <BR>My personal preference is for the 3d/e designs, though maybe with the
    name under the <BR>design rather than integrated to the side. <BR> <BR>Jordan

  body: Concept 3 has a more memorable logo than 1 and 2.  It appears like it is doing
    more work.  I like it because it focuses on a single interchange. Remember, without
    the first connection the thousands of others would be irrelavant. Plus people
    will relate that style of mark to transportation due to it&#39;s simplicity. It
    is almost as if you are taking a generic railroad crossing sign and making it
    more efficient and aggressive in it&#39;s appearance. Anyway 3 is my favorite.
    1 and 2 are overkill.

    sector. Also, the black typeface give a nice contrast with the dots.  <BR> <BR>The
    concept number 3 could be cause some problem. It is too near of the Paramedic

    <BR>I realise the simplicity of 3 is what you like &#40;I do too&#41;; do you
    think the &#39;tracks&#39; ruin this simplicity too much? Or do they add further
    meaning in your opinion? I like them. <BR> <BR>Tom-- <BR>I agree with you about
    2a with respect to it&#39;s suitability for purpose. The spacing and balance of

  body: I like both the 2 series and 3D and 3E. <BR> <BR>The 2 series has a lighter,
    more high-tech feel, but 3D/E say railroad to me immmediately and the mark just
    has so much more punch. If you&#39;re trying to include buses, I&#39;m not sure
    such a rail-centric design would be good, so the 2&#39;s may be your best bet
    &#40;I prefer 2B&#41;. If that isn&#39;t a concern, I&#39;d go with 3D or 3E.
    <BR> <BR>3F-H are pretty busy and I don&#39;t think they hold together like the
    earlier versions. 3H creates a nice interchange/weaving path from the &#39;C&#39;
    to &#39;Transport&#39; and &#39;Consultants&#39;, however.

  body: I see the Red Hot Chili Peppers in the 3a-c series. I swear they used a graphic
    similar to that on the BloodSugarMagic tour.  <BR> <BR>I read the 2 series as
    interchange more than this latest version. However, the idea of lines moving toward
    one another in 3h ... something interesting but the little x--as it stands--needs
    finessing to read as flow more than stop.

  body: Think about positive interchange. <BR>The new logos are nice but they aren&#39;t
    as positive as the 3d and 3e in post 1. What if you incorporated a weave in the
    logo. Almost like fabric. The new posts have lines going in a contradictory direction
    to the natural grain of the x shape&#40;this makes them less positive in shape&#41;.
    What if the lines were going with the grain and then they would somehow weave
    themselves together in the center, like fabric. I could draw a small illustrator
    pic if you would like.

  body: I really like the last one...the C just needs a tad bit of tweaking to smoothly
    blend in with the x symbol. The others, while nice, have a problem of looking
    like &#39;hic&#39; which to me would evoke drunk engineers. ;o&#41;

    reminds me something in relation with health sector &#40;white cross&#41;. <BR>
    <BR>I suggest to continue the work with the orange x. More stretch, higher or
    something.

  body: I&#39;ve also see the 3a-c mark used by the Red Hot Chili Peppers and can
    easily see that drawn on punk rock kids with a sharpie marker. In that aspect,
    it&#39;s not exclusive enough for a logo. Although, it is the strongest graphic
    symbol of the group &#40;probably why people have see it used elsewhere&#41;.  <BR>
    <BR>If you had not given background on the project, I would have never thought
    of anything having to do with rail operators. The marks presented made me think
    of bandages, &#34;X marks the spot&#34;, celestial bodies, candy canes, striped
    suspenders, bows, ribbons...  <BR> <BR>I like the stacking of the name, the orange
    and the modern type. I think with an even a stronger typeface, you can do without
    a mark altogether.  The spacing of the words and the length of the words almost
    gives the impression of tracks. Instead of making an separate symbol for the logo,
    perhaps play with the type/color to create a subtle symbol in itself.

  body: Jordan, think of Modrian, off center your shapes, transportation isn&#39;t
    always in a straight line or evenly spaced for buses, cars or trains. My problem
    with &#34;C&#34; is TIC won&#39;t want to be associated with a X of any kind.
