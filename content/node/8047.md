  body: Inspite of the fact that the e&#39;s and r&#39;s are essentially itentical
    to one another &#40;usually a clue that it&#39;s a font&#41;, I don&#39;t think
    this is a font. Given the shapes of the other letters and the way they connect,
    this appears to be custom lettering &#40;with some cut-&#39;n&#39;-paste help
    from a graphics program&#41;.

  body: This is even more likely just by virtue of the fact that it&#39;s associated
    with an NFL team &#40;Tampa Bay Buccaneers&#41;. All major professional North
    American leagues &#40;NFL, MLB, NBA, NHL&#41; are very heavily marketing oriented,
    and I think have systematically customized nearly everything that can be used
    as part of an &#39;identity system&#39;, except in the cases where the logos are
    older than digital already. <BR> <BR>If you want it, they want you to buy it from
    them.
