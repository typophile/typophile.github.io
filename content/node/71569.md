  doesn't know the font they used in their own logo, so I've been tasked with tracking
  it down. It looks like they've tweaked the base font a bit to come up with this
  logo, but I think this is still a font at its core. \r\n\r\nI swear I've seen something
  a lot like this before, but all my attempts are striking out. Any ideas on identifying
  this (or even anything really similar) would be immensely helpful.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/font_recognition_6234.gif]\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nJordan"

  body: Oldnick - thanks for the help. That's definitely one of the closer matches
    I've found so far. Still looking for an exact match. Any other ideas out there?

    lean. Maybe it was modified."
