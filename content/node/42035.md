  speakers and microphones as a \"wireless headset\" for your cell phone.\r\n\r\nI
  just got mine set up, and it's pretty cool. I can open a panel and send a txt message
  without having to use AIM or any other tomfoolery like the keypad on my phone. That
  means I can copy and paste something from my mac, straight to a txt message. Pretty
  cool.\r\n\r\nMy roommate was annoyed as I was testing the voice capabilities. It's
  basically a speakerphone setup. You can initiate and end calls from the program,
  so you never really have to pick up your phone at all.\r\n\r\nI like, I like."
