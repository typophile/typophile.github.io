  called wallflower &#40;i think it&#39;s a she&#41; <BR> <BR>i designed her on screen
  &#40;and on paper of course&#41;, but in the further development i&#39;ll try to
  cut the letters from wood and make a set of wooden stencils at about 300pts.  <BR>i
  decided to use the shapes of a sans, based on a renaissance antiqua as an opposite
  to most stencil fonts i know, which have allways a very hard, brutal and often army
  look. for the same reason i only drew lowercase.  <BR> <BR>when painted on a wall
  it should look nice, not like vandalism, to let the message be heard. <BR> <BR>she&#39;s
  slightly slanted to give her the attitude of spoken word. <BR> <BR>perhaps she is
  in general to light, but i think at 300pts it could work. a huge problem is the
  spacing because in wood, there is no kerning. therefore i have to keep it quite
  loose.  <BR> <BR>well, those are my thoughts, please tell me yours! <BR>and if my
  english was too bad to explain the idea, just ask.  <BR> <BR> <BR><!--attachment:

  body: Very impressive! I especially liked the dismembering of the &#34;g&#34;&#39;s
    ear. <BR> <BR>A letter I think needs to be redone is your &#34;y&#34;. It looks
    too much like a &#34;v&#34; with a diagonal stroke pasted on it. <BR> <BR>I also
    liked the &#34;o&#34; but it still looks a bit &#34;wrong&#34; to me. Interesting
    application, though. <BR> <BR>Good luck with &#34;her&#34;.

  body: 'Lovely work, congratulations! I agree with Meir&#39;s comments. You could
    experiment with the gap in the o at the top, off center left or right, hinting
    at a cursive form. This cries out for a bold form, as well as caps, of course. '

    i like the y, even though meir is right about it&#39;s origin ... hehe. perhaps
    i&#39;ll redraw it by hand. <BR>if considering a bold version, would you recommend
    to redraw it as a whole by hand, or using the regular version and modify it? <BR>regards!

  body: Nice work. I especially like - g, o, p, v, w, y. <BR>critique- &#34;c&#34;
    seems to be leaning over, also it seems a hair to wide. I am not sure &#34;a&#34;
    works with rest of glyphs, it seems a bit  <BR>too disproportioned too small up
    top and a bit wide below. With all the playful character this font has horizontal
    on &#34;e&#34; is a bit too straight forward. Numerals have nice form but seem
    a bit disproportioned.&#34;b&#34;, &#34;d&#34; ,&#34;n&#34;, &#34;s&#39; should
    be a bit wider.Overall-Nice work.

    you widened it&#41; for its gentler sweep from curve to diagonal.  Maybe the diagonal
    should not extend quite so far giving the curves time to resolve themselves as

    can probably find a still better solution by playing with further variations -
    top of break bigger, bottom smaller, different &#39;cut&#39; angles, both small,
    both big, having the two ends not align, etc. I think the cap O may be the key
    test as this will be even more prominant...  <BR> <BR>I do think that what you
    can draw with a pen or felt tip, starting at the top and going clockwise, will
    be a guide to what the eye will accept as &#39;natural&#39; looking, so you might

    O. The forward slant of your breaks on the 8 go with the slant of the design,
    but on the O and o they contradict it. I like the zero also. I think the 4 needs
    some fixing. It looks narrow and frightened somehow. The g is fabulous.

    too tight. In small sizes that would be a problem. On the caps: Normally the cross
    bar of the E and H would be higher. I think it would look better here also. For
    me the bent joins in the MN don&#39;t go well with the rest of the caps. Check
    out the solution in Friz Quadrata, which puts the bent joins only at the bottom;
    that might give you some ideas.  <BR>The swash T goes well with the face, but
    I think the right terminal on the cross bar looks out of place. <BR> <BR>I waver
    on whether this is too much or too little  of the &#39;stencil&#39; effect, or
    just right. Have you tried it with breaking the branches of the hmnr from their
    stems, for a more &#39;stencil&#39; look? Or tried just forgetting about a consistent
    stencil look and having a closed oOQ? Maybe you could have alternative versions
    in the final. The design effect of the openning of the other letters than  oOQ
    is so nice that this would be viable as a display face, without being a full stencil.   <BR>
    <BR>Good luck with this; it has a nice, distinctive look.'

  body: "(Here's the disclaimer: I'm a 16-year-old guy and this is my first post ever
    on this website.)\r\n\r\nI love the uc De and Zhe. However, I think you might
    be overdoing the swash thing a little. For example, the pe's and ghe's might do
    better with a straight crossbar. Also, even though it is italic the lc de could
    stick with the uc design--I think it goes better with the spirit of the font.
    For the same reason I liked the old a and f better, and the o with the break at
    the top left strikes me as being the best one. So there's my opinion."

    reviewing some of your cyrrilic letters. As I stated earlier somewhere else in
    this forum, the Russian alphabet is not the original Cyrrilic alphabet. Russian
    character style dates back to the time of Peter The Great, who hired some French
    typographers to make first lead clichez, so he can publish books in Russian. \r\nA
    small group of Bulgarian typographers now tries to impose the Bulgarian character
    design as a European standard for Cyrrilic, since Bulgaria will be (hopefully)
    the first country in EU to use Cyrrilic. This is a tough deal, and it's not supported
    by our govt. I doubt that they will succeed in this, because Bulgarian are mere
    8 millions compared to whatever millions are Russians. But I think our style &
    design is better thatn Russian.\r\n\r\nAnd you may want to excuse me for my English.

  body: "Well...Hrant. I would love to, but unfortunately there are few (if any) resources
    that prove my opinion. Of course, many Russians won't agree with me, as they are
    already comfortable with current style, widely supported by Apple, Microsoft &
    Adobe. It's a matter of perception - but I definitely think that Bulgarian style
    is more....beautiful than Russian. As you can see for yourself, the lower Cyrrilic
    \"v\" (or \"b\") in Russian style is nothing but a scaled down version of the
    capital letter.\r\n\r\nAs I stated in some earlier posts, the only company that
    develops true Bulgarian Cyrrilic fonts is HermesSOFT. Take a look at their examples
    and you will understand what I mean.\r\n\r\nwww.hermessoft.com\r\n\r\nPS> Offtopic:

    think having differences between UC and lc is indeed good; as is having more extenders
    in the lc. On the other hand, the Bulgarian style is severely Latinized, and this
    is severely bad. And it doesn't make sense that Bulgarian is more Authentic Cyrillic
    than the Russian style, because it is <strong>farther</strong> from it. In fact,
    I think Peter The Great Diluter would have been envious of the Bulgarian style...\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    to kill and steal among superpowers.\r\n\r\nMy objection to the Bulgarian variant
    is in fact that it's not nationalistic <strong>enough</strong>; it panders to
    the West to a degree that Peter the Great would have salivated for. These days
    Russia is no longer the big scary neighbor Bulgaria needs to worry about. The
    threat now comes from the west, so it might actually be a good time to reform
    their script.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
