  body: Hi Peta, welcome to Typophile. Your thread title had me thinking of <a href="http://www.peta.org/">PETA</a>.
    Which also led me to assume it was spam. Heh. It's OK to promote yourself in your
    blog, but maybe share a little more information about yourself or how you came
    to find Typophile.

  body: "Hi, Typofile was recommended to me by a brilliant lettering artist I use,
    the lady who draw the 'design' in my logo (http://www.ruthrowland.co.uk/). As
    a pre-mac trained graphic designer I am always looking to incorporate good typography
    and bespoke lettering into my designs, so the concept of Typofile appealed to
    me. Perhaps I should change my username so people aren't confused, as you were.
    Bye for now\r\n"
