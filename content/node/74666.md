  fond memories of. However, yesterday I was asked to mimic the style of the star
  man for a compilation cover... The star man was easy, it's just the font I can't
  seem to find!\r\n\r\na quick google didn't do the job so I am once again at the
  mercy of those who's typographical expertise makes me think I should spend more
  time absorbing letroset catalogs...\r\n\r\nFor those who don't know the show, here's
  an image http://www.pogueslive.com/misc/ogwt.jpg\r\n\r\nThanks in advance :)"
