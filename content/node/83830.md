  client wants is the word \"HOPE\" with the letter \"O\" representing a small pictorial
  scene. I need a typeface that has a nearly-perfect circular \"O,\" but Futura doesn't
  exactly scream \"kid-friendly.\"\r\n\r\nDoes anyone have any suggestions for another
  typeface with an almost perfectly circular letter \"O\" that is a little more inviting
  than Futura?\r\n\r\nEDIT: And, please, for the love that is all good and holy, do
  not suggest Gotham. While a lovely typeface, it's been used to death, clearly."

    yea, what Aaron said. "
