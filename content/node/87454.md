  fonts and doing some light reading about fonts and I found this one font recently
  called Riven that I thought looked pretty nice, then I downloaded it from dafont
  and I've been using it in my web browser / a few english assignments etc. and I've
  found that it looks a bit like Georgia with the horizontal, straight serifs, the
  structure of the \"T\", \"H\" and \"I\". There are enough subtle little differences
  between the two that its clear that Riven isn't a BLATANT rip, especially with that
  annoying upper case V, but I'm curious if the similarities I'm seeing can just be
  chalked up to inexperience or if they are legitimately related fonts.\r\n\r\nAlso,
  could someone link me to some good, informative texts and articles about typography?
  I don't want a 700 page report on the history of typography, but the diverse selection
  of fonts fascinates me and I'd like to know a little bit about how fonts are derived,
  why there are so many, and how to tell a few big ones apart."

    like the logo of the game Riven. \r\n\r\nIf you like the style use the original
    Perpetua instead. "
