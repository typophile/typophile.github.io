  nice posters with a typographic and/or design theme. Nothing too pricey as she's
  on a tight budget (just out of college).\r\n\r\nI did a quick check of some online
  poster shops and found some vintage advertising art, some travel and movie posters
  with nice typography, etc., but most of them looked like posters you'd see for sale
  at stores everywhere; I think she's looking for something a little different or
  more sophisticated.\r\n\r\nAny suggestions?"

    if they are within budget, but there are so many good ones there she's likely
    to find at least something that strikes her fancy.

    some gems hidden throughout the site.
