  am <em>sick</em> to <em>death</em> of comparisons that arise every year as we enter
  conference season. Specifically, the comparison of ATypI to TypeCon. Yes, both conference
  happen to share the topic of type. But, why compare? Why not just love? I guess
  I sit in a tough place. I love both. Some might say ATypI is more academic. Others
  say TypeCon isn't serious enough. I hate to break it to you people, but both conferences
  have both qualities. Where TypeCon is less expensive, ATypI gives you the opportunity
  to mill around during lunch and watch your heroes eat. Where ATypI bends toward
  specific corners of typographic theory, TypeCon gets to move into Type use in Graphic
  Design. Even these are gross generalizations. ATypI has three tracks, argued to
  be a good thing because you get choice. TypeCon has one track allowing us to not
  pine and winge over the speakers we are missing. \r\n\r\nCompare for yourself. \r\n\r\n<a
  href=\"http://www.atypi.org/07_Helsinki/30_program/20_main_program\">ATypI</a> and
  <a href=\"http://www.typecon.com/speakers/\">TypeCon</a>\r\n\r\nBoth conferences
  have their share of high-brow talk and low-fi fun. Don't hate, participate!"

    same conclusion as you: both conferences are great! If the two conference were
    too similar <strong>then</strong> we'd be in trouble. Relish diversity.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "[devil's advocate]\r\n\r\nTiffany, it is unreasonable to expect that TypeCon
    & ATypI Conferences serve the same audiences (except perhaps in the one year out
    of four that ATypI comes to North America). Most designers, especially students,
    young designers, busy designers, or poor designers, cannot be expected to afford
    to attend both conferences. Those who can afford both get the reward of attending
    both ;-)\r\n\r\nThe rest have to make decisions. It does come down a bit to funding.
    Location & cost are a factor, and interest is another. It is not unreasonable
    to expect more graphic designers to attend TypeCon than ATypI. Font Technicians
    who can only make one conference should pick the ATypI. The conferences are not
    the same. If they were the same, then they could please eveyone by just happening
    once, not twice, right?\r\n\r\n[/devil's advocate]\r\n__\r\nwww.typeoff.de"

  body: "Dan, you little devil's advocate, ::wink:: I never said they serve the same
    audience. I only said they have many similarities and I did call to attention
    two places at which they diverge from one another. I also didn't say that students
    should attend both. My checkbook can attest to the fact that I couldn't attend
    both accept for a few lucky circustances this year. Location and cost are a total
    factor, I agree. I also agree that more graphic designers attend TypeCon. Hmm.
    Me thinks that I didn't write in English and wrote, instead, in Tiffanese. \r\n\r\nDan,
    I was attempting to start the conversation, which inevitably happens every year,
    off on a good note. \r\n\r\nYes. Cost is a factor. Yes. Location is a factor.
    Yes. If you are a student that lives on a pauper's budget you more than likely
    can't make it to both or either one for that matter. Yes. Yes. and. Yes.\r\n"

    out of the way for some of us struggling freelancers.

  body: Terry, I could also see that a TypeCon in NYC might make attendance by Europeans
    a lot more accessible. (Yves is coming!) The cost of flights from NYC to Europe
    sometimes rival flights from NYC to SF. I'm curious to see if there's a much stronger
    European contingent at this year's - I suspect there will be.

  body: "I do know several Europeans who are coming because it is New York. Somehow,
    everyone seems to know someone there. So even though the city is so expensive,
    it doesn't sway them because they are just going to end up crashing on friends'
    couches anyway.\r\n\r\nThis is probably a phenomenon that couldn't be the same
    in another city like Toronto, Minneapolis, or Chicago. Although it does seem to
    happen every year during TYPO Berlin. I guess that Berlin is one of those places,
    too.\r\n__\r\nwww.typeoff.de"
