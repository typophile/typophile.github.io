  <BR> <BR>Has anyone seen this, I am very interested in an opinion before I make
  the purchase.  Any other recommends on books dealing with similar subjects? '

    I hold in great admiration. I consider Tibetan as the most beautiful, but Arabic
    is glorious, in the true sense of the word. And the language has a euphony unrivaled.
    <BR> <BR>The book you&#39;ve pointed to has a good reputation, and I&#39;m actually
    waiting for UCLA to get the copy they recently ordered - I&#39;ll report back
    here. <BR> <BR>Last year I bought this other book &#40;from the wonderful &#34;Builders
    Bookstore&#34; in SF&#39;s chocorgiastic Ghirardelli Square&#41;, and it&#39;s
    &#42;wonderful&#42;: <BR> <BR><A HREF="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0789207109/qid=1018388660/sr=2-2/ref=sr_2_2/104-9962888-5644764"

    <BR> <BR>Also, you might be interested in visiting the acclaimed <A HREF="http://www.arabictypography.com"
    TARGET="_top">http://www.arabictypography.com</A> site. But note that it&#39;s
    part of a &#34;reformist&#34; platform - don&#39;t expect to find a view into
    Arabic&#39;s hallmark glory there. <BR> <BR>hhp'

  body: 'thank you hrant. i would love to actually learn the language as well.  <BR>
    <BR>for some reason, i just thought of the movie &#34;The Pillow Book&#34; about
    a young japanese girl that was obsessed with the written word ... just popped
    in there, call me random. <BR> <BR>heres a link: <BR><A HREF="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0767819772/qid%3D1018389411/ref%3Dsr%5F11%5F0%5F1/103-7803911-4528629"

  body: ' The Arabic language isn&#39;t as complex as the script - except for the
    fact that in some countries &#40;like Lebanon&#41; the spoken language is somewhat
    different than the &#34;formal&#34; stuff everybody learns/teaches.  <BR>The thing
    with Arabic is the repertoire of sounds: it&#39;s so different than Indo-European
    languages that it can be pretty discouraging to learn. You think it sounds funny
    when an Arab speaks English? You should hear it the other way around! :-&#41;  Even
    Armenians &#40;we have some of the same sounds, but notably not the really guttural
    ones&#41; have trouble with it. There used to be this stand-up comedian in Beirut,
    and his whole act for many successful years was talking Arabic like an Armenian.
    <BR> <BR>BTW, I&#39;ll be taking a Mandarin Chinese class one night a week, starting
    April 22 - it&#39;s just &#34;conversation&#34;, without getting into their daunting
    logography - but wish me luck anyway! <BR> <BR>&#62; The Pillow Book <BR> <BR>I
    &#42;still&#42; haven&#39;t managed to see that movie.  :-&#40; <BR>But I think
    I&#39;d vote for it anyway... <BR> <BR>hhp '
