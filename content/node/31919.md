body: Does anybody know of a font similar to Trump Medieval that might fix my predicament?
  Or maybe just offer a suggestion. I'm trying to squeeze this letters together really
  tight, and it's causing some unappealing results. I've circled the parts in the
  attachment that are bugging me. I can break it apart, and tweak it in Illustrator,
  but I have some other places where I'll be using the same typeface. I would like
  them to come together easily for a straight kind of "bridge" effect with the text,
  if you know what I mean. Thanks a bunch![img:sites/default/files/old-images/bridge_5349.gif]

  body: Very few serifs will do exactly what you want with spacing this tight. I'm
    afraid you'll have to go looser or edit outlines.

  body: That said, maybe <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=catalog.fontdetail&displayfontid=M.125938.0.1&attributes.sampleSize=48&sampleText=BRIDGE&sampleSize=72">Times</a>
    will play nice.

  body: Thanks for the quick reply. I tried Times per your suggestion, but I really
    like the bracketed serifs of Trump Medieval, and Times has curvy ones. Maybe that's
    what I need. Another typeface with bracketed serifs. If all else fails, I'll just
    keep it the way it is. I don't feel like changing all the R's.

    will do what you want:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Bridge_Whitman_5240.gif]\r\n\r\nBTW,
    your use of the term \"bracketed\" is opposite to how it is usually used. When
    the transition from the stem to the serif is \"curvy\" and gradual, then the serif
    is said to be <em>bracketed.</em> When the transition is abrupt, as in a design
    like Trump Mediaeval, then it is said to have <em>unbracketed</em> serifs.\r\n\r\n--

  body: "I think Trump Medieval is quite interesting. It's not the square serifs alone
    but also the proportions of the letterforms: narrow B E R against wide D G.\r\n\r\nCouldn't
    you just modify the R's end (lift it up) and cut off the G's bottom serif (or
    lift it a bit so it sits higher than the E's serif) in Illustrator?\r\n\r\nEven
    if you space versals tightly: BR is too close, and RI too wide. As to DG, I would
    overlap the curves completely. (I have no image at hand, but if you go <a href=\"http://www.kltf.de/kltf_litteratra.htm\"
    target=\"_blank\">here</a> and then click on \"glyph set\" in the top right menu,
    there are DO OC OG ligatures which may illustrate what I mean.)\r\n\r\nKarsten"
