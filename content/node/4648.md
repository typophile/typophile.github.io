body: 'Maybe some of you have the same problem: <BR>since I&#39;m working with CS
  I can&#39;t insert the <b>curly bracket</b> and the <b>vertical line</b> anymore
  with my keyboard. I have to use the glyph palette, which is a bit cumbersome...
  <BR> <BR>these are the shortcuts on an azerty-keyboard: <BR> <BR><b>&#123;</b> Unicode
  U&#43;007b <i>Shortcut: alt- &#41;</i> <BR><b>|</b> Unicode U&#43;007c <i>Shortcut:
  alt-shift L</i> <BR><b>&#125;</b> Unicode U&#43;007d <i>Shortcut: alt- &#40;</i>
  <BR> <BR> <BR>other alt shortcuts seem to work fine... <BR> <BR>Does anybody has
  a clue of what&#39;s causing this problem? <BR>'
