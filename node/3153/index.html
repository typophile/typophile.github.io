No direct or indirect associations or comparisons are meant to be applied by the following statement, but quite frankly, font names like <i>Infidel</i>, <i>Nixonscript</i> and <i>Shock &amp; Awe</i> might cause the same amount of gooseflesh as the phrase <i>Meinkampf</i> in some circles.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Strawberry Field (yes, singular like that) was a Salvation Army home in Woolton, Liverpool, and John used to go play there with his friends when he was a kid. <BR>Later, in 1966, he used his childhood memories of Strawberry Field and abstracted them for a song, which he called 'Strawberry Fields Forever'. <BR> <BR>Here's an excerpt from an interview Lennon gave to Rolling Stone in 1968: <BR> <BR>Q: &quot;What is Strawberry Fields?&quot; <BR> <BR>JOHN: &quot;It's a name, it's a nice name. When I was writing 'In My Life,' I was trying 'Penny Lane' at that time. We were trying to write about Liverpool, and I just listed all the nice-sounding names, just arbitrarily. Strawberry Fields was a place near us that happened to be a Salvation Army home. But Strawberry Fields&ndash; I mean, I have visions of Strawberry Fields. And there was Penny Lane, and the Cast Iron Shore, which I've just got in some song now, and they were just good names&ndash; just groovy names. Just good sounding. Because Strawberry Fields is anywhere you want to go.&quot;</div>

		<div class="commentbody">&gt; <i>Well its sold as a Lennon handwriting font&hellip;</i> <BR> <BR>What I meant was that it was not leveraged beyond the description that was supplied by the foundry (Letraset). Never was Goo Goo Gjoob referred to as attributable or inspired by Lennon in any of our marketing materials. The product description on the web site that mentions Lennon is a required bit of background information from the designer. We certainly could have emblazoned the cover or inside spreads of our catalogue with superfluous celebrity stroking, but we didn't. That was my original point.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Andrew, Lennon may be considered hypocritical, a millionaire advocating a world without money. But he supported many progressive social causes. The &quot;War is Over&quot; ad campaign he and Yoko did was brilliant. Part of the strength of his songs was their recognition of his imperfection, he was a jealous guy and not afraid to admit it. <BR> <BR>The text in the image file at the top of this thread was taken from an army recruitment ad (complete with missing apostrophe). Lennon may have been rich, but he never went to war or started one. I wanted to see how it would look. <BR> <BR>And it seems that typographic culture completely overwrites any graphological status (the personality or politics of the writer) that may reside in handwriting. In other words, even if you know Lennon's politics, you just see &quot;natural&quot; sloppy handwriting, in a sloppy font. And the context in which the type works, ie the layout and the images it works with, creates far more meaning than can ever be inferred from the script. <BR> <BR>It's like we've spent many centuries investing subtle differences in typeface with particular meanings (type as formalized writing?), but perhaps now what we're trying to do is figure out something similar for un-formalized scripts &ndash; that may be one reason why they're so popular as fonts.</div>

I started collecting them at one time, with the idea of maybe doing something with them, but I haven't saved any for a while. Maybe Jared &amp; Joe have them all stashed somewhere?</div>
