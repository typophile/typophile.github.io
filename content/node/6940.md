  place does not have their logo in any kind of high-res format, or vector format
  that I can use for anything. I am trying to avoid, what I already know is coming,
  trying to redraw it by hand. But, first what I am wondering, is that although this
  looks customized, what font would you say it most resembles, or actually may be
  based on? <BR> <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/50200.jpg"
