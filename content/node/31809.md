    Typography</a>, but I'm not sure whether they use Bodoni anywhere else but in
    there name. Also, <a href=http://www.vialetter.com/showmetheletters.htm>viaLetter</a>
    lets you give someone huge Bauer Bodoni letters as a gift.

    own version (Our Bodoni).\r\n\r\nhttp://vignelli.com/\r\n\r\nIt was a big deal
    back in the '90s when ITC released their version of Bodoni, \"one of the most
    carefully researched and accurate interpretations...ever attempted.\" Some big-name
    type designers (Stone, Parkinson) were involved in that project.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.itcfonts.com/Fonts/Classics/Bodoni.htm"

  body: Alessandro, you seem to be omitting your <a href=http://www.typeculture.com/academic_resource/articles_essays/pdfs/tc_article_42.pdf>biography
    of Giambattista Bodoni</a>. Maybe knowing the man will shed some light on the
    typeface.

  body: "There's Allan Haley's book \"Typographic Milestones\" which has bios of several
    historical type designers including Bodoni. Look around for Bodoni's Manuale Tipographico,
    the specimen book of 1818. There have been a few fascimile versions of it so you
    should be able to locate one you can see. There was also a digital version of
    the Manuale but I don' tknow if it's still available.\r\n\r\nIf you're near Chicago,
    the best collection of Bodoni material outside of Parma is at the Newberry Library
    including an unpublished MS on Bodoni by R. H. Middleton. \r\n\r\nGeorge \r\nI

    for the first time in 30 years, leaving more time to work on my portfolio... less
    time to research Bodoni.
