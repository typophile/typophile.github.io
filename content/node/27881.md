  Any suggestions?[img:sites/default/files/old-images/CreamPuffs_5756.jpg]

  body: I would rescan this page at a larger size to show more detail. It's tough
    to see at this size...

  body: "One thing in particular that seems different about this sans typeface is
    that there is no serif on the 'i'. I could find only one monospaced font at MyFonts
    with this characteristic. It was <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/ephemera/impersonal/\">Impersonal</a>,
    by Andrew Leman. It is not identical, as you can note from the 'y' and the '4',
    but it is quite close. I also looked at typewriter font sites and couldn't find
    any other sans without a serifed 'i'.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

    closest digital version I can think of is <a href=\"http://lineto.com/The+Fonts/Categories/Typewriter+Fonts/Superstudio/\">
    SuperStudio designed by Jon Hares for Lineto</a> based on Dual Gothic also used
    on IBM typewriters.\r\n\r\n"
