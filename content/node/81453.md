body: UXB the first release of astroluxtype, a division of astroluxdesign, brings
  a hard edge feel to the basic military style stencil design. These fonts work together
  or separate to create the look of a stencil cardboard cut out, that then gets a
  spraypaint treatment with the use of its companion font. The two part application
  can create more than a few cool effects for your next design emergency. UXB Stencil
  is the paneled cut-out street style font and UXB Spray is the interior component
  that has the appearance of being CREATED with the stencil cut out. UXB Stencil and
  Spray will lend a dynamic look to your graphic design projects that need a typographic
  solution with a rough urgency. Available and on sale now at http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/astrolux/uxb/
