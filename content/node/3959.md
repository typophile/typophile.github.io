  body: Checked some stuff here and there, but it&#39;s quite possible that these
    are custom drawn. The script is nice, love that hybrid shape on the lowercase
    &#34;s&#34;. The serif reminds me of a bit of <A HREF="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/bitstream/windsor/"
    TARGET="_blank"> Windsor</A>, but serifs at top <I>and</I> bottom of centre  strokes
    of the uppercase &#34;W&#34; are unusual.
