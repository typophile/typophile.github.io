body: Hi, I am creating a logo, which represents New Zealand, for a new company. I
  want to represent freedom and the relationship between the great outdoors and the
  cities. I have made the logo so average New Zealanders&#39; can understand it, therefore
  it has a friendly &#39;clip art&#39; feeling.<img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/50116.gif"

  body: Could you make it more Maori? <BR>Maybe instead of &#34;city &#43; nature&#34;
    you could represent &#34;West &#43; Maori&#34;. <BR> <BR>hhp

  body: I will take that on board thankyou, however I would like to try and represent
    our nation without relying on Maori designs as an increasing number of identity
    designs do.

    <BR>Obviously people do harness that aesthetic, but are there bad reactions in
    doing so? <BR> <BR>take care <BR>g

    find it difficult to make an &#39;overall&#39; lookign maori design.  <BR> <BR>Personally,
    I like the logo.  <BR> <BR>regards, <BR>---jacques

  body: It&#39;s nice, but, alas, seems almost too &#39;clip-arty&#39;.  <BR> <BR>I
    think it&#39;s just the subject matter. Mountains &#43; Cities could describe
    a thousand different places on this planet.

  body: I would have to agree that it needs refinement, I can&#39;t say exactly what
    the company is at this stage as it is not yet public, but it is going to have
    something to do with helping smaller companies and young entrepreneurs make it
    overseas.  <BR>Type will be part of the logo in the end but I would like to get
    the symbol working by itself first before I add another element.  <BR>I will do
    some research into Maori designs as this seems a popular suggestion. In doing
    this I wil have to take care as it is easy to put your foot in it when you don&#39;t
    have a solid understanding of a culture. Thankyou for all the great feedback.

    <BR> <BR>To me that changes things a lot. Like it probably makes the Maori angle
    dumb. <BR> <BR>hhp'

  body: many people have already touched on the concept so... <BR>visually, i think
    that it&#39;s unbalanced.  but more importantly, when i first saw it, i saw electricity
    or lightning or something, not mountains.  i had to read your description to get
    it.   <BR> <BR>i think you can establish a difference using the line weights or
    line styles of each half, and not have it look like lightning.

  body: Jill, does New Zealand have a distinct shape like, like when viewed on an
    Atlas like Australia? Maybe you could explore that area. Mountains and buildings
    could be the Manhattan &#40;NY&#41; skyline and the Palasades &#40;NJ&#41;. The
    Palasades the best kept secret of living in New York.

  body: Is this actually for Chris Gibson&#39;s final semester class?  <BR> <BR>If
    so, clever thinking to put it here. At this stage, it says little about New Zealand.
    Why would you make it so the &#34;average nzer can understand it&#34;? Has clip
    art become the default non-verbal language that kiwis understand? I don&#39;t
    really think that you should aim for the average. The average is a myth to me!
    <BR> <BR>Good luck with this, I will be interested to see what you come up with.

  body: I agree with kris. Clip Art isn&#39;t a style, and understanding comes with
    the clarity of the communication, not the style. <BR> <BR>You&#39;ve started an
    interesting approach, just push it around some more. <BR> <BR>Any type associated
    with the logo?
