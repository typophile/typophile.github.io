  body: Alexandre, I am not sure what email address or phone number  <BR>you used.
    The only notice we&#39;ve seen is the one from PayPal  <BR>requesting the refund.
    <BR> <BR>If you would still like to become a member Please email  <BR><a href="mailto:membership@typophile.com">membership@typophile.com</a>.
    If you would like to continue with  <BR>the PayPal refund you initiated simply
    do nothing and we&#39;ll  <BR>proceed with the refund. <BR> <BR>Due to the amount
    of spam we receive daily it&#39;s very possible  <BR>your emails never got past
    the spam filter. Very sorry you&#39;ve had <BR>a bad experience.

  body: Same here, except I&#39;ve only written three mails so far. I paid the money
    through PayPal on April 14th and I&#39;m still waiting. I did receive a reply
    on April 26th saying you guys were looking into it and would get back to me, but
    that was three weeks ago. <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/sad.gif"

  body: After hearing the same stuff last year at Typecon, I decided to stick with
    free membership status instead of wasting money. <BR> <BR>I really thing Joseph
    and the guys would like this to be a free service after all <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"

    in with some real money. It&#39;s a question of priorities.  <BR>I consider it
    more a donation to the community. <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"
