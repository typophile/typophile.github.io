body: "Hello,\r\nI am a huge fan of House Industries, having purchased the entire
  Neutraface family back in 2011. At that time, their webfont FAQ said webfonts were
  coming \"mid-2012\". Now it just reads \"sometime in the future. I totally get they
  want to put a quality product out and their are licensing issues and such so that
  people just don't rip the fonts from your web directory and the foundry and designer
  gets no compensation.\r\n\r\nThey do offer print fonts, but one is not licensed
  to use them in the new @font-face manner. It's OK to make a graphic of every title
  or whatever you want on your site and display it, but with today's technology, this
  becomes totally impractical and not really worth my time.\r\n\r\nThe two fonts I
  like from them are: Housebroken Rough: http://www.houseind.com/fonts/housebrokenrough/
  and Stanslope (http://www.photolettering.com/a/ji32fec0a). I purchased from Linotype
  the ITC Century package which is pretty similar to Stanslope but not quite the same.
  I suppose it will do, but it doesn't really have the flair I'm after.\r\n\r\nI need
  fonts that I can use for both print and web for my own business (single-use). I
  imagine if other clients saw and liked them there could be some option to add additional
  licenses, but right now, I'm just trying to locate something that approximates these
  two for both @font-face and print.\r\n\r\nIf anyone could give recommendations for
  where I might search or similar looking fonts, I would most appreciative. I don't
  mind paying, although free is always nice. I am just feeling overwhelmed by so many
  choices, none of which are quite what I'm looking for and I don't really know where
  to start. I do have an Adobe TypeKit license and now that I've purchased from Linotype
  I think I can upgrade my package if necessary.\r\n\r\nThank you so much for any
  feedback.\r\n\r\nBest,\r\nMarie\r\n"
