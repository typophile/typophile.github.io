  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>The issue of the correct pronunciation of names and terms has come up periodically on Typophile. Don&rsquo;t worry, this isn&rsquo;t going to be a rehash of those threads, I think.</p>
<p>Recently, I started work on a pet project of mine, <a href="pyogi.pbwiki.com">a website</a> (almost entirely in Korean for now) to help standardize the spelling of foreign names using the Korean alphabet, hangul. There are certain rules and guidelines to this process set by the National Institute of the Korean Language, but most Koreans are not familiar with them and find them difficult to follow. The website will be a database of sorts with numerous examples of properly applied hangul transcriptions of names.</p>
<p>Transcription of non-Korean names into hangul, a process I call hangulization, is based on the pronunciation of the names in the original language rather than the original spelling. For certain languages including Spanish, Dutch, and Czech, the pronunciation is fairly predictable from the spelling so there are rules for converting the original spelling into hangul. For English, French, and German names however, a knowledge of the original pronunciation is absolutely necessary.</p>
<p>For fun, I started a list of type designers there, culling names from Typophile and other sources. I kind of went overboard with the list, so it has several hundred names; it is also very Typophile-heavy and not very objective or balanced.</p>
<p>Anyway, I&rsquo;m confident about the correct hangulization for most of the names, and I e-mailed a couple of people to get the pronunciations of names I wasn&rsquo;t sure about. But there still are a lot of names whose pronunciations need to be verified, and that&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m asking for your help.</p>
<p>I would specifically like help with the pronunciation of any of the following names:
Marian Bantjes (Canada)
Gerald Giampa (Canada)
Patrick Giasson (Canada)
James Grieshaber (US) 
Mark Jamra (US)
Gerry Leonidas (Greece) - Is the &lsquo;g&rsquo; in &lsquo;Gerry&rsquo; hard or soft?
Gérard Mariscalchi (France/Canada)
James Montalbano (US)
Neil Summerour (US)
Kai Oetzbach (Germany)
Thomas Marecki (Germany) - Is it &lsquo;Marekki&rsquo; or &lsquo;Maretski&rsquo;?
Julien Janiszewski (France)
Gérard Mariscalchi (France/Canada)
Thierry Puyfoulhoux (France)
Magnus Rakeng (Norway) - Is the &lsquo;k&rsquo; pronounced &lsquo;k&rsquo; or &lsquo;kj&rsquo;?</p>
<p>Also, was I right to hangulize the following names according to the Catalan pronunciations?
Joan Barjau (Spain)
Laura Meseguer (Spain)
Josep Patau (Spain)</p>
<p>Israeli names are also confusing. Is it Yanek Iontef or Yontef? How is &lsquo;Henri Friedlaender&rsquo; pronounced in Hebrew?</p>
<p><a href="http://pyogi.pbwiki.com/%25EA%25B8%2580%25EA%25BC%25B4-%25EB%2594%2594%25EC%259E%2590%25EC%259D%25B4%25EB%2584%2588">The full list of type designers can be found here.</a> I included my own notation to show approximately what was transcribed into hangul for each of the names, so you can check if I&rsquo;m using the right pronunciations.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a huge list, so I&rsquo;m bound to have made a number of mistakes. Let me know if you spot any. Let me know also if you want additions to the list. It will be better if you supply the correct pronunciations as well. Don&rsquo;t be too shy to suggest your own name if you are a published type designer.</p>

<p>Well, I use the word  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transliteration">transliteration</a> in the narrow sense of a mapping from one writing system to another, as opposed to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcription_%28linguistics%29">transcription</a>, the mapping of the sounds of a language to the writing system of another language. Everyday usage conflates the two, but I want to maintain a distinction between the two terms since it&rsquo;s a somewhat specialist website.</p>
<p>The rendering into hangul that I describe is theoretically transcription, since it is meant to be based on the pronunciation, but in practice it&rsquo;s a mixture of transcription and transliteration. The words <em>romanization</em> and <em>cyrillization</em> refer to such broad mixtures of the different modes of rendering words into the Roman alphabet and the Cyrillic alphabet respectively, so I&rsquo;m using the analogous word <em>hangulization</em> to broadly describe any rendering of foreign words into hangul.</p>
<p><cite>Shouldn’t be a problem with Shinn :-)</cite></p>
<p>Indeed. &lsquo;Nick Shinn&rsquo; is rendered 닉 신 in Korean, and 신 is actually a Korean surname as well!</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I see the strict definitions of transcription and transliteration that you link to, but you are right they don&rsquo;t quite work, so maybe your word is indeed best. &ldquo;Transcription&rdquo; in English is normally from spoken to written, as when a court reporter takes down everything that is said for a court record.</p>
<p>I am familiar with Hebrew transliteration, which is rarely done as the article defines it, namely as a system which enables you to reconstruct the original spelling in the other language.</p>
<p>As [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romanization_of_Hebrew|this article on Romanization of Hebrew]] explains, the Romanization of Hebrew is basically a mess. There are so called &lsquo;scientific&rsquo; ways of doing it, systematically, in the strict definition of &lsquo;transliteration&rsquo;, but they are rarely followed. There are a lot of different ways that are practiced, so &lsquo;Iontef&rsquo; and &lsquo;Yontef&rsquo; are the same in Hebrew, and he himself might not romanize it the same way all the time. Basically people today tend to romanize Hebrew roughly as it sounds spoken in modern Hebrew, but &lsquo;roughly&rsquo; the operable word.</p>
<p>Henri Friedlaender was raised in Germany and left because of the Nazis. So his name would I guess be properly pronounced as in German.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>William, thanks for your explanation about the romanization of Hebrew being a mess. Koreans can&rsquo;t be depended on to romanize their own names consistently, either, and most do not follow any of the existing systems for transliteration. It would be good to know which spelling Iontef/Yontef himself uses though, if he does favour one over the other.</p>
<p>From what I can gather, Henri Friedlaender was born in France and lived in Germany and the Netherlands before going to Israel. He has a French given name and a German surname. I&rsquo;m going by the Hebrew spelling of his name (הנרי פרידלנדר), which seems to represent &lsquo;Hnri Fridlndr&rsquo; going by a chart of the Hebrew alphabet. I was hoping a typophile could supply the missing vowels in the most common pronunciation of his name in Hebrew. I&rsquo;m guessing &lsquo;Henri Fridlander&rsquo; or &lsquo;Henri Fridlender&rsquo;.</p>

<p>The only difference between Spanish and Catalan pronuncation when rendering these into the Korean system would be that the J would be ㅈ instead of ㅎ.  Laura Meseguer would be slightly different but would be more representative in the Korean phonetic system to use ㅅ for the intervocalic S.</p>
<p>I should add that, at least for Joan Miró, my modern art history professor (who was Korean) always used the Spanish version of his name, Juan.</p>

<p>Interesting. Maybe your professor just assumed that Joan was a Spanish name and pronounced it as such, so that it came out like Juan? How do non-Catalan-speaking Spaniards pronounce Catalan names in general?</p>
<p><cite>looks like polish names: [maretski] and [yanišeuski]</cite></p>
<p>English speakers with Polish names often pronounce them entirely unlike the original Polish pronunciations, so I would like to check if Marecki and Janiszewski use similarly Germanized and Gallicized pronunciations.</p>
<p>What about the names of English-speaking types designers? Could anyone help with Montalbano, Summerour, Giampa, Giasson, Jamra, and Greishaber?</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Thanks Szabolcs. I&rsquo;ve corrected the transcription for Marecki.</p>
<p>There are existing rules for hangulization of Polish, and Janiszewski comes out as /yanišefski/ as a matter of fact if taken as a Polish name. The transcription I&rsquo;m using is not IPA but my own notation that I&rsquo;m calling the <a href="http://pyogi.pbwiki.com/Hangulization-Auxiliary-Alphabet">Hangulization Auxiliary Alphabet</a> that shows the simplified pronunciation used for the hangul transcription.</p>
<p>I currently have /yaniševski/ for Janiszewski on the theory that the French pronunciation will closely respect the Polish one but stop short of following the Polish devoicing rules that converts the /v/ into [f] in actual pronunciation.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p><em>I currently have /yaniševski/ for Janiszewski on the theory that the French pronunciation will closely respect the Polish one but stop short of following the Polish devoicing rules that converts the /v/ into [f] in actual pronunciation.</em></p>
<p>The polish prononciation is exact. But time goes by and as my grand-grand parents were the ones to imigrate to France my name has been converted into a more french prononciation. Even I wasn&rsquo;t really aware of the exact polish pronociation until I spoke with polish people :/</p>
<p>So I usually pronounce it -janijevski- (sorry I don&rsquo;t know the phonetic alphabet…) and don&rsquo;t pronounce the -j- in the polish way as it is difficult enough for the french administration to deal with it :D</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>We really do take into account the original pronunciations at the phonetic level, including the devoicing rules, since Korean phonology is quite different from that of most European languages. Korean doesn&rsquo;t allow many consonant clusters, so epenthetic vowels (in most cases &lsquo;ㅡ&rsquo; IPA [ɯ]) are inserted, after which the devoicing issue is moot since they are no longer consonant clusters.</p>
<p>In addition, unlike most European languages, Korean consonant phonemes don&rsquo;t follow the voiced-devoiced distinctions but a three-tier distinction based on aspiration and tenseness. We don&rsquo;t have voiced consonants per se, but some consonants that are voiced in certain environments (and most Koreans won&rsquo;t hear the difference anyway). The idea that voiced and devoiced consonant pairs like &lsquo;v&rsquo; and &lsquo;f&rsquo; can be different realizations of the same underlying sounds is not at all obvious to Koreans.</p>
<p>[edited to add:]</p>
<p>Thank you Julien! It&rsquo;s great to hear from the man himself. The transcription has been corrected.</p>
<p>David, as a rule we don&rsquo;t write the r&rsquo;s in English that are not followed by a vowel, since those r sounds are not strong enough for Korean speakers to hear or are not pronounced anyway in many accents of English. We don&rsquo;t write the r&rsquo;s in the Swedish and Norwegian combinations &lsquo;rl&rsquo; either for related reasons.</p>

<p>But they are in American, which has a strong r, like Mandarin Chinese. So if you are taking care about how a German name in pronounced in Hebrew or a Polish one in French, then why not our American &lsquo;r&rsquo;?</p>
<p>Not that it matters :)</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Well, the r sound in Korean is rather different from that of English, and it can only be followed by a vowel (it can&rsquo;t come at the end of a word). So we usually transcribe r&rsquo;s in such positions only when they are trilled or gutteral. You might feel that the American r is strongly pronounced, but to us it just sounds like the preceding vowel is being modified rather than a separate consonant is being pronounced. The r in such Mandarin Chinese words as &lsquo;er&rsquo; is not transcribed as an r in Korean, either, but as an l (it just doesn&rsquo;t sound really much like the Korean r sound to us).</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t write the r&rsquo;s at the end of words in German either, if that makes you feel better.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><blockquote>
<p>to us it just sounds like</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That&rsquo;s the basic problem with doing proper names in a different language. In one language what is an essential difference is not even heard by the native speaker of another, and may not be representable in their orthography and sound system.</p>
<p>I have helped some Chinese speakers to communicate in American English. At first what they are saying sounds to them just like what they are hearing. But they are actually often incomprehensible to native speakers of English. Of course after training and practice they get the sounds right enough to communicate.</p>
<p>We Americans try generally harder than the English to get foreign names closer to their originals. But sometimes I think the English have it right: just anglicize it shamelessly and don&rsquo;t pretend to pronounce it like a native.</p>
