body: "I am looking for a fitting set of fonts to use for my thesis (on english book
  illustration between 1866 and 1907).\r\n\r\nI think I am going to use Andron for
  the main text, I love that it is dark and not too tall. However I would like to
  use a different sans serif font for the titles. Any suggestions on a font that would
  go well with Andron? If it had small caps, that would be a plus, though I haven't
  yet decided as to whether or not I am going to set the titles in SC.\r\n\r\nThank
  you so much in advance for your help and suggestions, it's really appreciated."

  body: "Should be a grotesque, to match the tone of the era.\r\nThe grots of that
    day were generally pretty gnarly, and Vicky sans faces (of which there have been
    quite a few recently), cleave to that quality in varying degrees -- the temptation
    being to clean things up and smooth them out. Julian Morey's <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/club21/sigma_ot/\">Sigma</a>
    is quite true to the originals. My own <a href=\"http://www.shinntype.com/figgins.html\">Figgins
    Sans</a> has similar proportions to Andron. Also Armitage, Knockout, Monotype
    Grotesque, National, and Ludwig (by Smeijers, offbeat, but interesting). \r\n\r\n**\r\n\r\nI
    note that you say illustration rather than illustrators. Do you have much about
    Edmund Evans?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Gill is an option, certainly. However, I can\u2019t resist now to point you
    at the sans I released just few weeks ago: [[http://typophile.com/node/71254|Lapidaria]].\r\nI
    designed it entirely independent from Andron and have actually not explored the
    pairing myself so far (which is funny enough). But it may be an option too.\r\n\r\nCheers
    to charming Edinburgh!"
