    strong coffee first ;-) My rise and run are calculated exactly from the given
    153-223-223 triangle. The sharp angle in the triangle is 2 x arc sin 76.5/223
    = 40.1255 degrees, thus the height of the triangle, when standing on its base
    is half the base 76.5 divided by the tangens of half that angle (tan 20.0628)
    = 209.4678\r\n\r\n<code>The top of the triangle rises in z-axis until, when viewed
    from above, the angle is 45 (360 divided in 8 parts). In the triangle viewed from
    above, the height is half of the base 76.5 divided by tan (0.5 x 45) = 184.6873,
    which is the run. With the triangle height of 209.4678 the rising angle must be
    arc cos 184.6873/209.4678 = 28.1521, and thus the cutting angle at the base is
    90 - 28.1521 = 61.8479 degrees, not 61.5, and the rise is tan 28.1521 multiplied
    with the run of 184.6873 = 98.8298 mm. Not 100.\r\n\r\n<code>If your imagination
    is stuck, please cut out two triangles roughly the given size, lift the points
    by 28 degrees, and look at where their long sides touch, to see that 10.40 degrees
    for the cut will definitely fit better than 61.85 or 61.5...\r\n\r\n<code>Prost!"
