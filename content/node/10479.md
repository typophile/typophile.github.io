  body: "Thanks! I have tried to make text faces before but they've always turned
    out to be more like display faces (I'm relatively new to this whole font business).
    This time I figured I'd learn from the experts and scoured almost every post on
    the serif board, reading the advice people gave to others  and applying it to
    this font (worthwhile, but quite time-consuming). I think it's worked out...\r\nReally,
    I'm looking to see if this is good, bad or ugly before I start working on the
    bold and other bits.\r\n\r\nAnd I still haven't thought of a name yet.\r\n\r\nBen."

  body: "Good work Ben. \r\n\r\nOverall looks good. I'm not an expert, but here is
    my critique:\r\n\r\nI will make thinner the arm of the 'r' (the part the joins
    to the stem) at the moment seems too thick. Make also the right serif a bit longer
    as well.\r\n\r\n'c' seems to narrow. The loop of 'g' as well.\r\n\r\nThe numerals
    need some work. For example the ranging 3 and 5 are too prominent.\r\n\r\nYou're
    getting in there."

    is friendly and graceful. I agree with the comment about the numbers 3 and 5 being
    too prominent, I wonder if there''s another solution for these. The lowercase

    that rub me the wrong way: the g and the j. The ear on the g just looks depressed.
    it looks like it's in pain. and that kinky tail needs to see a chiropracter. and
    the j stubbed it's toe, i'm afraid. it looks like the whole tail of the j was

  body: "Wow.\r\n\r\nI'd largely given up on this one (actually, more put on hold
    indefinitely). \r\n\r\nThank you for your comments, everyone.\r\n\r\nI completely
    agree that I need to work on the numerals and now you mention it, the 's' does
    seem to be too short (not sure how I missed that).\r\n\r\nI also agree with the
    B looking odd, I don't really know what I was thinking with that one (probably
    something along the lines of \"yeah, I'll carry the curve up into the upper counter
    but only a tiny little bit, that'll look good\").\r\n\r\nI was going to ask about
    the g (and that pretty much answers my question!)\r\nI do like it but it does
    look like it belongs in a different font. I'm thinking that making the bowl rounder
    and stiffening the ear will probably help it.\r\nAnd the j wasn't particularly
    well formed to begin with. Initially I didn't have the serif on the bottom but
    it just looked like it was missing a serif. I might try a few things like basing
    it on the top of the f or maybe just 'stretching it back out'.\r\n\r\nOh, and
    I still haven't thought of a decent name yet.\r\n\r\nBen"

  body: "First: It's nice to see somebody scouring old crits to learn stuff; that's
    the mark of a craftsman. Second: This is quite good for a first text face! Some
    of the glyphs (like the \"a\") have a lot of maturity. With some polish it'll
    be a winner.\r\n\r\nMacro stuff:\r\nSome of your corners seem confused, or indecisive.
    Like the bottom-left of the foot of the \"a\"/\"d\", and inside of the top serif
    of the \"c\". Considering how nice -I think- your general angularity is (like
    in the spur of the \"b\") I would just make those sharp too.\r\n\r\nMicro:\r\n-
    I'd thin out the top bowl-stem join of \"d\".\r\n- The top-right of \"e\" is too
    light.\r\n- The tail of the \"j\" needs to... morph!  :-/\r\n- In the \"k\", that
    join is too choppy.\r\n- \"s\": a bit wide, and top-heavy.\r\n- \"t\": the head
    is way too timid.\r\n- The tail of the \"y\" is out of character.\r\n\r\nCaps:
    Your proportions are nicely classical (although I'd make the \"L\" a bit narrower).
    And for some reason the tail of the \"J\" seems to work here, I think; so does
    that stub in the \"K\". But the disjoin in the \"P\" isn't working - although
    I think it is working in the \"R\". The \"Q\" though seems entirely too 19th century.
    I'd make the \"U\" a hair wider, and the \"W\" slightly wider. BTW, you're using
    my favorite form of \"B\"!\r\n\r\nNumerals: the head of the \"1\" is best for
    making the numerals fixed-width (which right now they aren't); and its base could
    be a lot stronger. The \"4\" and the \"7\" need more presence I think. The OS
    \"4\" isn't working.\r\n\r\nOthers: the Pound has an unusally strong top, but
    I think it's cool. The Florin should slant. The \"a\" in the At should be smaller.
    I'd remove the x-line tick in the Eszet.\r\n\r\nThe Italic is quite refreshing,
    and its distinction from the Roman balanced very delicately, very... 21st century
    - wonderful. There's something old about it, like in its long diagonal serifs,
    but also something new in its ampleness and gentle slant (which I like a lot).
    Interesting, the \"f\" with a partial descender; I'm glad you've left the flourish
    out. The \"k\" might need to be less Art Deco. The \"&\" is a flop.\r\n\r\nSpacing:
    assuming you keep the nice slight darkishness, I would tighten it all up a bit.\r\n\r\nOverall,
    quite encouraging!\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "More micro crit. Either the bottom bowl of the 'u' doesn't go far enough
    below the baseline, or the lower right tail goes too far, or maybe a little of
    both. At very large sizes, the curve of the left side of the 'e' doesn't seem
    to match up (try temporarily removing the crossbar to see what I mean). Righthand
    bowl of 'R' could probably be a bit darker.\r\n\r\nRighthand bowl of 'm' may join
    the middle vertical stroke too low, although maybe this is the effect you were
    looking for. To my eye, it's a bit asymmetrical.\r\n\r\nItalic 'agy' seem a bit
    wide. (btw, 'vwxy' are very nicely executed! I may have to steal ideas from those).
    I personally miss the lower left tail on the 'f', but again that's a matter of
    taste. The curve on the top arm of the 'k' stands out to me - you'll note it's
    backwards from the curve you usually see on a Greek kappa.\r\n\r\nMisc characters.
    The two-stroke '$' seems especially dark. Either going to a single stroke or pulling
    back on the darkness of the serifs would fix that. Braces aren't very curvy, a
    pet peeve of mine. See how I dealt with those in my <a href=\"http://levien.com/type/myfonts/pr-Century-Catalogue.pdf\">Century
    Catalogue</a>. The florin has a similar problem - the segment of the central stem
    which is perfectly straight should be shorter. The eszet seems topheavy, but I
    think that could be fixed by making it a bit narrower (especially the 's' part
    of the glyph).\r\n\r\nSpacing on the italic could use some adjustment. rbearing
    on 't' is too loose, on 'i' too tight. ge is too tight 's' seems a bit loose.
    I think you've overkerned the 'ke'.\r\n\r\nOverall, very nice!\r\n"

    must admit I'm still not 100% happy with the tail of the y, but I think it's going
    in the right direction (metaphorically speaking). The number of different approaches
    I've tried is quite astounding (second only to the ear on the g, which I have
    spent far, far, far too much time tweaking and changing). \r\n\r\nI think I've
    improved the tail of the j, as well as the tail on the Q, although I'm not totally

  body: "The \"f\" and \"y\" are rockin' now. The \"g\" though is starting to look
    more and more homey - it needs to be more elegant; try making its head smaller
    and its curves more rigid. The head of the \"t\" is out of character. The \"Q\"
    is... interesting. It might work, but I'm not sure.\r\n\r\nItalic: I'd give the
    leg of the \"k\" some pizzaz. That ampersand is novel, but I have to doubt it's
    good enough. The little Roman alternate is cool though. Italic spacing: a bit
    loose.\r\n\r\nYour blank space is too wide in both Roman and Italic.\r\n\r\nI

  body: "Congrats; this is very well done. I can hardly find anything to criticize.
    Here's what I personally think. These are extremely minor.\r\n-bowl of P too big\r\n-make
    the top of the q bowl rejoin the stem as a hairline (don't rethicken it)\r\n-maybe
    lighten lower bowl of g a tiny bit\r\n-make the t a bit more chiral at the bottom
    left; also maybe a bit less smooth up top (maybe)\r\n-x a little out of balance\r\n-perhaps
    s also a little out of balance\r\n-zero could be a bit more square\r\n-tail of
    the italic g seems out of harmony for some reason--maybe not\r\n-I can't shake
    the feeling that the italic f should come all the way down, or at least some farther.\r\n-italic
    a needs more chirality\r\n-rethink top italic k arm serif ?\r\n-black k too lo-fi
    at join\r\n-perhaps give black C,c a smidgen more underbite\r\n-you mistyped \"black
    italic\"\r\n-pi too narrow\r\n-Euro could use a little more underbite\r\n-maybe
    don't rethicken tail of eng (not sure what you would do about Eng in this case--perhaps
    treat it like y)\r\n-what'choo want an etc ligature for?\r\n\r\nMost of these
    are so minor I can't even definitively say if I'm actually seeing them or not.
    Overall I think it's very near to perfected. The vision is well captured. Where
