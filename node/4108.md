body: In the same vein as Hrant&#39;s &#34;Glyph-Love&#34;, I think it would be interesting
  to see your favorite logo. &#40;Preferably one that you have designed&#41; Or, if
  you haven&#39;t done any logos, one that you consider to be a well designed, solid
  mark. <BR> <BR>I am reading Leslie Carbargas&#39;s book now and was impressed with
  his logo selections!

    Hurricanes&#41; had the best logo in sports.  <BR> <BR><a href="http://whalers.hart.net/"

    Hurricanes logo is the worst of any sports team. <BR> <BR><a href="http://carolinahurricanes.com/"
