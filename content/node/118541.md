  italic small f of the original Sabon (I have been looking at it before I knew it
  was by Jan Tschichold).\r\n\r\nI remember there's a post here saying that \"the
  small italic f is the worst glyph ever made.\" What's wrong with it? Is it so because
  it is straight? (I guess what Akira Kobayashi has done was correct by changing it
  back to conventional curly form?)"

    Kobayashi, who reverted to the curly form of italic lower-case <cite>f</cite>
    for the Sabon Next version. Tschichold's original design for this particular glyph
    may have been dictated at the time by the limitations of the Linotype hot-metal
    typesetting system, which did not allow for kerning letters."

    over into the margin otherwise.\r\nI provided such /f\u2019s as alternates in
    the Modern Suite.\r\nFedra has them, of course."

    Sabon Next was not done by Kobayashi but by Jean-Francois Porchez.\r\nAre you
    saying that this sword-like f is not a stylistic choice, but a compromise for
    the technology at the time?\r\n\r\n<blockquote>When italic /f starts a line, it
    goes way over into the margin otherwise.</blockquote>\r\nGood idea! I guess I
    have just focused on the stylistic side other than the practical function.\r\nBut,
    are they stylistically bad because a straight end is not most italic small f's
    are hand-written (viz. not following what a serif glyph should conventionally
    behave)?"

    counter-clockwise a tad, but that looks more strange and obtrusive."

  body: "The whole Sabon project was indeed a matter of compromises : the brief Tschichold
    received asked for a Garamond-style text design suitable for handsetting, Monotype
    and Linotype hot-metal composition \u2014 three different systems with hugely
    varying technological constraints. \r\nIn my opinion, the fact that Tschichold
    managed to overcome all these limitations and to answer the brief in such a masterly
    fashion makes the original Sabon one of the greatest typographical masterworks
    of the twentieth century."

  body: "When the technical constraints that Sabon faced are mentioned, I am always
    reminded of the typefaces designed for the IBM Selectric Composer. All of them
    faced the same constraints as Sabon: as with Monotype, the widths of the characters
    were according to a unit system; as with Linotype, the italic and the normal (and
    also the bold) were the same width.\r\n\r\nFor comparison, here is Journal Roman,
    which I've thought of as the Garamond from the set of faces they had (although,
    looking at the bold, it also reminds me of Perpetua). This is from a scanned version
    of IBM's catalogue on the web, and the scan isn't the greatest, but it seems to
    be passable as long as one ignores the artifacts in the background.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Journal_6731.jpg]"
