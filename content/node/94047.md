    seeing any \xA9s anywhere.\r\n\r\nSo, what you're basically saying is that you
    reserve to behave like a jerk, because who's going to stop you?\r\n\r\nI don't
    know. Now that the U.S. Supreme Court has made it clear that lying is a Constitutionally-guaranteed
    right, they may bless extend the same protections to being a jerk, too."
