body: "Did a search first but seems as though no one's asked before. What font is
  that used in CR magazines? I don't have good quality scans or images, but I'd like
  to know the font used in their fairly new refreshed masthead and also the font used
  in the copy.\r\n\r\nNot a type expert, but I have a hunch the body copy, headings,
  and masthead are all of the same family?\r\n\r\nThanks for any help! Links to images
  are below. Cheers!\r\n\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.enchorial.com/HelmutKroneReviews/CreatRevImages/CRDatelineSq.gif\">Logo</a>\r\n\r\n<a

  body: News Gothic, maybe? It's a little more friendly with running text than Franklin.
    Franklin Gothic was intended for headlines, anyway.
