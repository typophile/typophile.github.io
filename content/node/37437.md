body: "Hello,\r\nDoes anyone know the origin and source for the font Tykewriter? It
  seems to be a free handwriting font that is widely used in childrens books, but
  the source is mystery. It comes in Regular and Bold Bobbing. There is a kids software
  product with the same name, but doesn't seem to be the source. Thanks for any suggestions.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Tykewriter_4614.jpg]"

  body: "Thanks for the input. It's a font that's been around publishing houses a
    long time, and is frequently requested or supplied to designers for producing
    kid's books. We use it a lot. However it's creator and original source is unknown.
    Perhaps it's a custom font that \"escaped\" from one of the publishers. It's definitely
    called Tykewriter. Here's a link to the myFont forum about it. Anyway, thanks
    again. Best.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/WhatTheFont/forum/viewthread.php?threadid=28372"
