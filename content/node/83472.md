body: "Hi all-\r\n\r\nIt's been a while! I hope someone can shed some light on this
  little doozy.\r\n\r\nThis type is seen on a prop edition of \"The Tales of Beedle
  the Bard\", used in the first part of the movie \"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows\".\r\n\r\nI've
  exhausted all the usual lines of enquiry, and found this particularly hard to classify:
  there are similar examples referred to variously as \"Slavic\", \"Anglo-Saxon\",
  \"Runic\", \"Medieval\", \"Decorative\", and even \"Blackletter\".\r\n\r\nIt may
  be that this is an entirely custom job, but judging from the second of the images
  below, the proportions and kerning appear to be lacking polish which leads me to
  wonder whether it might even be a freebie.\r\n\r\nThanks as always for your input.\r\n\r\n-Nick\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/beedle1_3656.jpg]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/beedle2_4840.jpg]"

  body: Whatever it is, it's based on the Book of Kells. I have an old project (started
    six years ago) that has a lot of the same letterforms gleaned from the same source,
    but a font of same hasn't reached the light of day yet...

  body: "Thanks Nick, I must admit I never made the Kells connection. I look forward
    to seeing yours when it finally comes together.\r\n\r\nAnd thanks Joerg; I must
    have skipped right past Kells Square. It looks to be the one, with some stroke
    enhancement and minor customisations. Great work!"
