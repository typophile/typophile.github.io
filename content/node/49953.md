  in Gouda, The Netherlands, in 1956, Petr van Blokland graduated Cum Laude from the
  graphic arts program at the Royal Academy of Fine Arts in the Hague. He has been
  a freelance designer since 1980. He specializes in systematic design \u2014 typically
  building directories, forms systems, corporate identity programs, etc. He has taught
  graphic design, typography, and type design for many years at the Royal Academy
  of Fine Arts in The Hague and at the Academy of Fine Arts, Arnhem. His first typeface
  is Proforma, a large series commissioned by Purup, Danish manufacturer of forms
  preparation systems, now released for general use by Font Bureau. His work brought
  him ATypI\u2019s coveted Charles Peignot Prize in 1988. His statements on typeface
  design are well-known: On Quality \u201CThe same bottomline that applies to typography
  also applies to typefaces: when no one notices, the aim has been accomplished.\u201D
  On Experience \u201CTo be accomplished in all aspects of the design process is the
  fundamental demand on the designer. Experience and talent counts, not the availability
  of equipment.\u201D On Digitization \u201CBy carrying out the digitization as an
  integral part of the design process, maximum control is exercised over the eventual
  reproducing of the typeface, thereby avoiding any errors of interpretation.\u201D
  On New Typefaces \u201CWhy design a new typeface? After all, there are so many.
  There is a misconception that typefaces are not designed. They are simply here.
  Yet new typefaces are designed and this need is increasingly present in view of
  the current technological advances.\u201D\r\n\r\n<strong>External Links</strong>\r\n<a
