  looking for some input from the period typeface experts. I need to make (aka have
  fabricated) some large wood cut lettering for a movie set to be historically accurate
  to the 1920s. I have been researching fonts from the time period with great results
  - however - it doesn't feel quite right to be using a font for this. I have a sample
  layout using Gill Sans Bold that looks quite good but I'm not sure if it's right.
  \r\n\r\nDoes anybody have some input regarding how a sign like this would be made?
  How would the letters have been laid out for cutting? Drawn by hand? Stenciled?"

  body: "In the 1920s, a \"font\" per se, would not have been used for the design
    of a sign. Excellent hand-lettering skills were the core of a signmaker's trade.
    The lettering would have been done by hand. The styles might have had some small
    influence from the trends in type, but just as often the influence went the other
    way. \r\n\r\nUnless your movie is set in London, the Gill Sans style is not going
    to be historically accurate. It was heavily influenced by the typeface designed
    for the London Underground by Gill's teacher, Edward Johnston, ca. 1916. Gill
    Sans, as a font, was not released until the very end of the 1920s and didn't have
    much impact in North America until a bit later. I don't know if any sign makers
    outside of London would have noticed for at least another decade.\r\n\r\nIf you
    want some historically accurate suggestions, you should contact Mark Simonson,
    or hope he stops by this thread. For insight into sign making practices from the
    period, you could try contacting John Downer, an excellent sign painter in the
    old tradition and something of a historian of the trade. \r\n\r\nBetter yet, get
    your production to hire one of them as a consultant.\r\n\r\n-- Kent."

    Gill Sans, I had a feeling this would be the case. Where might I find contact
    information for John or Mark?\r\n\r\n"
