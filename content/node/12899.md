  body: Well, I think you may have to differentiate between the type used on printed
    matters ( 'Myriad' ), and the one used as screen font for the iPod, which, <em>according
    to various samples on images.google.com</em>, seems to ( still ) be 'Chicago'..

  body: As far as I understood, Sam indeed needs the type on the actual iPod screen,
    not the type Apple uses for its ads and graphic identity. I haven't got one of
    those, so frankly I haven't got a clue, but <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/images/B000069KE0/ref=dp_product-image-only_0/104-0832224-3606309?%5Fencoding=UTF8&n=5174&s=music"
    target="new">Chicago</a> sounds plausible enough. ;-)

  body: "From the Wikipedia entry on <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_typography\">Apple
    Typography</a>:\r\n\r\n<cite>When released in 2001, Apple's iPod music player
    reused the bitmap Chicago font from the original Macintosh GUI. Later versions
    of the iPod drew from the larger character repertoire of the TrueType Chicago,
    adding a number of characters not present in the bitmap Chicago, such as Greek
    and Cyrillic. Even though the screen supports grayscale, the characters were not
    anti-aliased.</cite>\r\n\r\n<cite>The iPod mini, with a slightly smaller screen
    than the iPod, uses the typeface originally designed for the Newton, Espy Sans.
    In the iPod Photo, Apple Myriad has displaced Chicago as the user interface font,
    in part due to the higher resolution of the color screen sported.</cite>\r\n\r\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_typography#Fonts_used_in_other_products"
