  done. Uncial gets old, and I'm fed up with all the ugly attempts to Latinize it.
  So here's mine. I hope it's less ugly.\r\nSo, what do you think? The text shown
  is the Lord's Prayer, \"Atta unsar\" in Gothic. I think it contains all the Gothic
  letters except those used only as numbers or in Greek borrowings. I can post more
  examples if necessary.\r\nOnce I settle on the Gothic designs, I think I may extend
  this to Latin and Greek."

    very much like to see something in English too, once you have  extended it to
    Latin. And if you're going to extend it to Latin and Greek, throwing in Cyrillic
    will only require a few more characters.  \r\n\r\n-matt"

  body: "Okay, for some reason I still can't attach a PDF. So instead, here's a link
    to the one I tried to attach earlier: http://wurdbendur.googlepages.com/attaunsar.pdf\r\n\r\nAnd
    here's another with the full alphabet (minus the 900 letter that I haven't made
    yet) and a translated sample: http://wurdbendur.googlepages.com/gothicpreview.pdf\r\n\r\nYou'll
    see that the capitals and lowercase are each the same width. I designed the uppercase
    first and then the lowercase based on those, mostly just shortening and adjusting.
    I want them to look similar since Gothic doesn't usually have real capitals; one
    simply writes a large initial letter. But this causes some of the proportions
    to be weird. I think I should narrow the lowercase N, at least. Do you think I
    should adjust the capital too, or is it okay?"

  body: "I really like this.  As you mentioned, there's hardly any great examples
    of it, almost all are heavily Latinsed/Hellenised/Cyrilised, or else fascimile
    with the rough edges, et al.  Are the inward facing serifs on the Z / T / F considered
    standard for Gothic, or is this particular to your rendition? (I'm curious.)\r\n\r\nAs
    for the N, I agree the lowercase is a bit staunchy, but the capital looks great.
    \ The problem is that by forcing your capitals do be the same width as your lowercase,
    you're necessarily squashing them, which is less noticeable on letters like F,
    E, S, I, Y, etc, because most of their diagonals (if any) are more vertical, and
    any horizontals are fully horizontal.  The N is more noticeable I think because
    it seems to cross the 45\xBA line betwixt the cases.\r\n\r\nI think you'd be okay
    to vary the widths a little bit.  Since not all the letters have the same width,
    it won't be noticeable that the capital and lower versions are slightly different.
    \ \r\n\r\nOverall though great job.\r\n\r\n<em>\xABEl futuro es una l\xEDnea tan

    aren't many good examples (not that I would shell out the money for the fonts
    that do exist), but they're pretty much all uncial with downward or leftward pointing
    serifs, like so (from Code2001):\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/ztf_3594.png]\r\n\r\n[[http://www.omniglot.com/writing/gothic.htm|Omniglot]]

    real thing.\r\n\r\n[[http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/08/Wulfila_bibel.jpg|This

    comes from the Gospel of Luke (I think\u2014I'm not really sure which) from the
    Codex Argenteus."
