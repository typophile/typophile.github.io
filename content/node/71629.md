  it. I've been trying to do some research on Photina and it's designer, and really
  appreciated the article over at I Love Typography on Jose Mendoza de Almeida. But
  the one thing I haven't found yet are books or other printed matter set in Photina.
  Especially I would be interested in examples of combinations of Univers and Photina.
  Can anyone help me out?\r\n\r\nThanks\r\nJeffrey"

    using Photina:\r\nMethods of Book Design, by Hugh Williamson (Alden Press).\r\n\r\nAlso
    a mention that the Oxford University Press adopted Photina for their books.\r\nPhotina
    was launched in December 1971, so that should give you a start of that period\u2026\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\nBert"
