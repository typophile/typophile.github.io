  body: "It's close to Trajan, but the R is more compact. If this dates from the movie
    release time in the mid-50's, it is pre-digital artwork most likely. The lettering
    on Trajan's Column was used by Goudy and others, long before Carol Twombly did
    her version for Adobe.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
