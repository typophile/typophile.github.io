body: I have Comcast both at home and at work, so this might just be a Comcast problem,
  but I haven&#39;t been able to get to typographi.ca for days. Is anyone else seeing
  this?

    Typographica? A recent series of events involving a certain great white regulatory
    institution has caused the typographi.ca domain to be rather unceremoniously yanked
    off the air. While this situation is being resolved, Stephen Coles - proprietor
    of Typographica - would like to assure folks that he does indeed have a great
    aunt in Alberta so this misunderstanding should be cleared up shortly.&#34; <BR>
