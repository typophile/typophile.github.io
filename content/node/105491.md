body: "[img:sites/default/files/old-images/lionel_6021.jpg]\r\n\r\nI'm looking to
  identify this font.  I've scoured the internet, but have not had any luck.  It was
  found here:  http://www.mr-cup.com/blog/3.html , but I haven't been able to find
  a font that is similar to this one.  I'm wondering if the branding company did a
  one-off for this client?  If not, what are some similar fonts that you know of?
  \ Thanks for your help!!!  "

    At their site they provide the image of the typeface Lionel. So I think it is
    a custom job. \r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/lionel_3711.jpg]"

  body: "Totally agree with Renko, most probably a custom job. Plus, really don't
    know any Latin Tuscan Condensed such like this. As a sidenote, \"Lionel\" custom
    type and main woodmark differ also a bit: x-height, latin serif position (/L,
    /E, /N...). They surely share the same design backbone though, one derived from
    the other. They may have started creating main woodmark (possibly as described
    below) then extend this 5-letters job to an alphabet.\r\nIf I have to reproduce
    it, I'd probably start from one of these following condensed sans, adding latin
    (triangular) serifs and median spurs: [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/flat-it/dharma-gothic|Dharma

    (serifs need to be tweaked), <strong>[[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/flat-it/sheepman|Sheepman]]</strong>
    (possibly lacking a bit of height but latin serifs are already here, just needs
    to add median spurs), [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/woodentypefonts/teniers|Teniers]]
    (same work as House of Cards), [[http://www.letterheadfonts.com/fonts/prince.php|Prince]],

    fonts -- where the serifs are triangular -- were also popular.\r\nThis particular
    combination of Latin serifs and spurs is unusual.\r\nTo duplicate, I would follow
    the same procedure as Ryuk; choose a squared sans of similar weight and add Latin
    serifs and spurs. \r\nThe closest squared serif that I was able to dig out is

    you are not a font-maker, someone should be able to make it for you at a reasonable

    purchased and its permissions should allow modifications.\r\nDon\r\n"
