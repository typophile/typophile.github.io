  floatation tank relaxation company?\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/floatworks_4381.png]\r\n\r\nThe
  work was through a friend of mine, he's the web designer and wanted something 'floaty,
  but business-like' or thereabouts. I did originally try a 'fl' ligature but it didn't
  really work \u2013 it forced the curve of the top of the 'f' to be too wide. \r\n\r\nAny
  thoughts would be most welcome.\r\n\r\nThanks, \r\n\r\nGraham\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Nice!\r\n\r\nI think it works really well and looks friendly (I hope that's
    what you're going for\u2026). I do have a slight issue with the w (but can't put
    my finger on it) and the lower-right leg of the k looks a bit longer than the
    left one. Other than that, I love it.\r\n\r\nIs this based on an existing typeface?
    If not, you have the basis for a new display type; great work!"

  body: "One, what is a floatation tanks relaxation who-za-whats-it,\r\n\r\nTwo, I
    agree with TypoJunk, initially I saw cartoonish (only for like a 10th of a second),
    but when I read it, it settled down to be really appeasing, and professional.\r\n\r\nvery
    good. I would only say that may the bottoms of the 'r' left leg of the 'k' be
    treated like you would an 'o' and have them descend a little lower below the baseline.
    other that that, looks awesome!"

  body: "Thanks peeps, \r\n\r\nA floatation tank wotsit, is a space age looking bath
    with a lid with luke warm salty water that you can float in. Its dark in there
    and they play bad whale music at the beginning and end. You're supposed to relax
    and forget all your worries in a sensory deprivation kinda way. Homer and Lisa
    try them in the Simpsons one episode.\r\n\r\nyeah, the longer leg of the k was
    intentional \u2013 it seemed to sit better. I'm not sure the bottom of the r and
    k strokes need to go down as far as the o & w, but you're right they  could do
    with being a little lower.\r\n\r\nThanks for your thoughts.\r\n\r\nGraham"

  body: I like it. Maybe the top of F could be just a little bit shorter in order
    to widen the space between it and l (so to avoid any possible misread of Fl as
    A).

    as it was a a bit Cap A looking.\r\n\r\nThanks."

  body: "Nice. (Although you might want to switch the nice blue for black until you've
    got the shapes down.) The tension between calmness and interestingness in this
    seems quite fitting. If that makes any sense :-)\r\n\r\nYes, the \"f\" looks too
    big if it's supposed to be lowercase, or too round and too big if it's a cap.
    To me it looks like it wants to be a shower or something. I'd just make it, dunno,
    normal size. If you make the top-right less droopy (i.e. cut it earlier, before
    it curves down so much) it could maybe be quite a bit narrower too. (Although
    that may well have repercussions on the \"r\"\u2026)\r\n\r\nI'm not sure the concept
    of the terminals is entirely cogent yet, but it's going in a nice direction. To
    my eye there are some funny things with directions going on \u2013 the \"t\"'s
    arm (and very small foot) is pulling it quite strongly to the right, as are the
    \"w\"'s x-line terminals, whereas other glyphs are more static. I'd think static
    would make more sense in this context than pulling forward too much\u2026? So
    I might pull the \"t\" and \"w\" back if I was you.\r\nAlso: The \"a\" seems to
    look narrower than the \"o\" (which it probably isn't, but looks like).\r\n\r\n<cite>\"You're
    supposed to relax and forget all your worries in a sensory deprivation kinda way\"</cite>\r\nHave
    you been in one? They rock."

  body: "Thanks Nina, \r\n\r\nVery helpful comments. I get what you're saying about
    the right-aimingness of the t & w, though I'm not entirely sure how to remove
    it in the w so much. \r\n\r\nWill have a bash at the f as well, I see what you
    mean. \r\n\r\nWill probably post something in a week as I'm off on holiday without
    a lappy. \r\n\r\nThanks again for your thoughts. \r\n\r\nGraham"
