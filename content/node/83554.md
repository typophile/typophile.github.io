  I will be embarrassed for not knowing this one, but I don't seem to have anything
  on my PC to match it.\r\n\r\nIt's from a live-action Saturday morning television
  series called Jason of Star Command.\r\n\r\nIt's similar to College, but the \"J\"
  and other letters are different.\r\n\r\nAnyone out there in the great Internet-verse
  have an answer for me?!?\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\n\r\n- Mike"
