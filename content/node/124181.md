  of the Javanese script, one of Indonesia's traditional script, here's an image in
  case you never saw it\r\n\r\n [img:sites/default/files/old-images/jawa font wulang
  sampel1 perbandingan_5582.jpg]\r\n\r\nIt is a very marginal script, without official
  status anywhere and declining number of users despite it's long history. I was wondering
  if there are any other writing system with similar situations. I'd like to know
  how users of other marginal, non-latin script handle their typography. Though generally,
  I would like to know about the typography scene of other scripts other than Latin
  and Arab (since those two are the most prominent, is it?)\r\n\r\nThis is my first
  post in typophile, so apologies if I made any mistake :)"

  body: "Welcome, Aditya.\r\nIt\u2019s a very worthwhile undertaking to care for \u201Cmarginal\u201D
    scripts. I think many people do, actually. It belongs to our collective heritage
    and so it is all the way worth of being promoted.\r\nFor myself, I have done Irish
    and Coptic, Runes, Gothic, Greek, Old Albanian and perhaps a few more strange
    things. Because it interests me.\r\nI\u2019m not informed about the situation
    for Javanese. But, since there\u2019s a Unicode page for the script at hand, no
    one hinders you or anyone to make nice fonts for the script and to distribute
    it.\r\nI hope you keep us up-to-date!"

  body: "Thank you for the reply, Andreas\r\nI too find it very worthwhile, I work
    mainly with traditional Indonesian scripts, namely Javanese, Balinese, Batak,
    Bugis, Sunda, and a couple ancient ones like Kawi and Pallava. Your welcome to
    view some of my works in https://www.behance.net/Alteaven, opinions are greatly
    appreciated.\r\n\r\nBut the difficult thing about them is the technical rendering.
    These scripts have fairly complex rendering, with regular diacritic stacking and
    sorts. I guess it's no harder than other Indic scripts, but the number of people
    using it is so little that of lack technical support is expected and hindered
    the designing process. A handful of font that are able to do this script is still
    cumbersome and not supported by all system.\r\n\r\nAnd I also would like to know,
    in designing \"marginal\" scripts, how do you ask for opinions? For example, you
    know typography but you do not know the whole orthography for the script. Asking
    for opinion from the native users, they only comment on the incorrect orthographies
    (which is appreciated) but no constructive opinion for the typographic design.
    It's frustrating, because this is what happening to me, the market I'm targeting
    is not typographically conscious to be frank (squishing the fonts in photo editors,
    using psychedelic colors, gullible in calling every font good, and such). "

  body: "Your works on Behance look very good!\r\n\r\n> fairly complex rendering\r\nwhat
    do you mean by that?\r\n\r\n> how do you ask for opinions?\r\n\r\nI try to gather
    your problem. Well, either you find people able for giving helpful critique \u2013
    or you don\u2019t. In the latter case: YOU are the designer. YOU make things happen.
    In the extreme, everything depends on your own insights and judgement. There\u2019s
    no need to be afraid of that.\r\nIf there is a (pre-digital-era) typographic tradition
    for a script, this would be the starting point, naturally. If there is not, then
    the writing and lettering tradition/customs are the basis for your work. That
    is likely to be more difficult, but yet, more interesting as well. Ideally, you\u2019d
    become a prolific scribe of that script before you turn to fontograph it. As for
    the graphic and aesthetic aspect of a typeface, good handwriting or manuscript
    sources are valuable references.\r\nThis is a very demanding task: you need to
    comprehend the system of the script and also the (technical) system of font/text
    processing/input etc\xAA. Then you need to \u2018map\u2019 the script\u2019s system
    onto the technical system, in order to make a proper rendering work. In any event
    of occuring difficulties just be creative.\r\n\r\nWhen you work on minority scripts
    for which you can\u2019t find useful advice, then rely on yourself. Then you\u2019ll
    be the pioneer who is going to enable the community of that script to use it in
    a new way, maybe in the way they didn\u2019t even dare to dream of so far. \r\n\r\nIf
    you face encoding-related problems you may contact the people of the [[http://www.linguistics.berkeley.edu/sei/index.html|Script
    Encoding Initiative]], who helped a lot of \u2018marginals\u2019 in the recent
    past already."

  body: "Thank you, I'm glad you like it:) Out of curiosity, which script did you
    find the most interesting?\r\n\r\nYes, I did learn to write the script first before
    making any of my fonts, and yes I do think it is an interesting challenge to make
    fonts for a script that anyone barely knows. But... Like, sometimes a native user
    said \"the shape of this letters is not really legible\", while I think it's still
    legible and I have a typographic background for it. I guess it would be better
    for me to hear a third opinion from a native user that also understand typography.
    But your words are truly encouraging, thank you. I'm more confident in my designs
    now.\r\n\r\nAbout the 'fairly complex rendering'... Compared to latin, where characters
    are put side by side, indic fonts has conjuncts that are triggered with certain
    combination of characters, reordering of diacritics, stacking ligatures, etc.
    This is fairly common in other scripts like Devanagari and Thai, but they are
    far better supported because they have many users and thus, standard technical/input
    system in fonts. There are no standards in Javanese or Buginese, I can't release
    any of my fonts because they can't be used for typing, although I'm currently
    working with someone to address that issue. Hopefully it will be usable for public
    soon."
