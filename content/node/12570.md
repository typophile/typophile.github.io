body: "This post is cross-posted on General Discussion.\r\n\r\nI have a vague memory
  of a book that was available on line (and may still be) whose purpose was to help
  in identificaton of fonts. Each page was set up with a grid of maybe 30 squares
  and in each square was a letter in 60 point or thereabouts. Underneath the letter
  was the typeface name. Apparently this book had pages and pages of cap As, then
  cap Bs, and so on.\r\n\r\n\r\nI\u2019m not referring to <strong>Rookledge\u2019s
  International Typefinder</strong>. I have that book and find it useful. The book
  I\u2019m vaguely recalling did not have one-line specimens for each typeface, it
  simply had various incarnations of each letter of the alphabet grouped together.\r\n\r\n\r\nI
  never actually saw the book and have no idea if it would be helpful. However, one
  of our art directors is looking for info on the book and I seem to have misplaced
  the url or any information about it.\r\n\r\n\r\nSo can anyone help an old lady with
  her senior moment? What the heck was that book? Did anyone actually purchase it
  and/or find it useful?\r\n\r\n\r\nThanks!"

  body: "I'm sorry if I am about to repeat something from the other forum's comments*,
    but I had a look at those books, and the varieties are so limited that the book's
    value is also very limited. I think the number of fonts shown was something like
    300, or at least a relatively small number, which is not even 1% of available
    fonts. It's a nice concept, but too token a sampling to be very useful (in my
    opinion) for anyone but font newbies.\r\n\r\n*(I am on my sister's very slow dialup
    computer that can't handle Flash graphics, so I can only check a page at a time.)\r\n\r\n-
