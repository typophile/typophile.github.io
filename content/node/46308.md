body: "Hi Everyone,\r\n\r\nI found a few threads on this, but they seemed to be several
  years old and I'd guess that options have changed at least a bit since then; I'm
  looking to buy a printer with postscript, at least A3+ (or borderless A3 if that
  exists in lasers) and colour. It would also be a bonus if it could take heavier
  papers too.\r\n\r\nOn a budget :)\r\n\r\nAny suggestions? Tips on what to look out
  for?\r\n\r\nThanks heaps!\r\n\r\n-Rafe"
