    downloads section as a text file.... all the characters might not display...depends
    on your default font... <BR> <BR>bj <BR> <BR> <BR>!&#34;#$%&amp;&#39;&#40;&#41;&#42;&#43;,./0123456789:;?@

  body: ' Matt, you don&#39;t say what kind of computer you&#39;re using. The standard
    encoding of text is different between Mac and Windows, so a text file is platform-specific
    &#40;unless it&#39;s a Unicode text file, in which case, only a few applications
    can use it&#41;. <BR> <BR>Also, the standard character set included in a font
    is different between Mac and Windows, and depends on what language you&#39;re
    using. <BR> <BR>The character set above is missing some floating accents &#40;common
    to both MacRoman and WinANSI&#41;, as well as some mac-specific and Windows-specific
    characters. Or maybe some of them just aren&#39;t displaying on my computer....
    <BR> <BR>Incidentally, Adobe&#39;s new ISO-Adobe2 character set is a superset
    of the standard MacRoman and WinANSI character sets, plus the litre and estimated
    signs. <BR> <BR>Regards, <BR> <BR>T '
