body: You could use the shape from the bottom of the q to make the i and j have dots
  &#40;I would get rid of it from the q&#41;.  <BR> <BR>The y could be just like the
  g except having a vertical cut out of the top. <BR> <BR>The f is quite topheavy.
  For the k you could use vertical cuts next to the vertical stroke and one horizontal
  cut on the right side. <BR> <BR>Just a few ideas for ya.
