  body: it's for the graduation invitation + program for my college. I'm using bodoni
    for the big type but I'm looking for another face (or faces) to set the small
    information in. it has to be super legible for all the parents & grandparents.
    any ideas?

  body: What is your subject of studies? How much information is there? Would you
    consider your design classical or contemporary? Formal or casual?

  body: 'it''s for a fine art & design program. it has to be classic/formal/serious
    but also a little bit wacky since it''s an art school. there is a lot of information:
    lists of names, times of exhibitions, receptions, hotels, restaurants, etc. legibility
    is really important, which is why I don''t want to use bodoni for the small stuff...'

  body: "If Bodoni is your display type, and you are looking for a legible body type,
    consider a Neoclassical type like Baskerville, or a Scotch Roman like Georgia
    or Bell. These would also be very scholarly choices in terms of their appearance,
    and they are very readable as well.\r\n\r\nBulmer is another good choice that
    sort of straddles the boundary between the Neoclassical types like Baskerville
    and the Romantic types like Bodoni.\r\n\r\nI would steer clear of anything humanist
    (like Hoefler Text, any Garamond or Adobe Caslon) as they might clash with the
    high contrast and geometry of Bodoni.\r\n\r\nIf you want to use a Bodoni for the
    body copy, ITC Bodoni or Berthold Bodoni Old Face would be good choices.\r\n\r\nDavid

  body: "ITC Bodoni Six is my favorite typeface. It's totally funky, yet classical
    and elegant. It's a chunky typeface, optimized for small point sizes, but even
    at 12 pts it's still pretty cool. It totally fits the <cite>classic/formal/serious
    but also a little bit wacky</cite> requirement.\r\n\r\nAnd because it is an authentic
    Bodoni, no one can call your bluff if you use it with a display Bodoni."
