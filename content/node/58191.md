  to announce the release of its first commercial typeface and plans several more
  releases in the near future.\r\n\r\n<strong>Dez Squeeze Fat</strong> is a full-figured
  display face. It is generous enough in weight and width to make you a knockout!
  Heads will turn from ho-hum to hard-hitting with this face. Don\u2019t apologize
  for your size\u2014the ample look will speak volumes to your audience.\r\n\r\nWhen
  you don't want to speak softly, Squeeze can shout above the crowd. Say it loudly
  and proudly, this face does not have a weight problem.\r\nThe Dez Squeeze Family
  was developed as a clean OpenType display face with a super-bold weight\r\nDez Squeeze
  has 483 glyphs with uppercase, lowercase, proportional lining figures, unicase,
  stylistic sets, alternates, ordinals, and case specific punctuation. It has a full
  range of diacritics and covers all European languages using the Latin script.\r\n\r\nhttp://dezcom.com/typefaces/squeeze/\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/KO-kid_550_5795.jpg]\r\n\r\n\r\nChrisL\r\n"

    have already replaced :-) \r\nPlaceholder text is used just as a \"temporary\"
    filler in a Lorum ipsum sort of way. Now that my site is live, I will have to
    finish writing everything and replace it.\r\n\r\nI assume the typeface you are
    talking about is \"Dez Squeeze\". It is a very heavy weight and wide display face
    with quite narrow counters. It is intended for use in large size display situations
    where you want high impact and a very dark color. For now, only the widest width
    has been released but there will be 4 narrower widths to follow shortly.\r\n\r\nThank
    you for your interest,\r\n\r\nChrisL\r\n\r\nPS: Here is a sample of the 2 extreme
