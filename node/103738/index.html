  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>I&rsquo;ve always enjoyed both Bodoni and Scotch style faces. I wanted to introduce some ‘fashion sense’ into the ‘work horse’, and get something unique. I think there&rsquo;s some potential to make it into a text face, eventually expand it, but I wanted to get some feedback here first. I honestly have no idea what I&rsquo;m doing, folks. It just sounded like a worthwhile idea to entertain.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been looking at Monticello quite a bit, and referencing a generic Bodoni for logic and proportion. For what it&rsquo;s worth.</p>
<p>What do y&rsquo;all think of that |Q|? and
I realize the teardrop is missing from the |g|. Bear with me.
Thanks to raph for the [[http://typophile.com/node/14710#comment-84480|Monticello Specimens.]]</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Interesting how a cross between a Bodoni and a Scotch has a certain Baskerville aura!</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s a lot of wonkiness here - too much conflict.
Figure out what this needs to be, not [just] where it&rsquo;s coming from.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>A good start but needs refining. I have a bunch of nitpicks, please don&rsquo;t take them without a grain of salt.</p>
<p>&ndash;&gt; The |s| looks to me to be a little off compared to the |S|.
&ndash;&gt; I don&rsquo;t think the tail of the |Q| is quite working. Perhaps move it over to the center instead of having it drop off the left side?
&ndash;&gt; The caps overall seem condensed compared to the lc. Was that intended?
&ndash;&gt; The spacing, especially the lower case, seems a tad off. Maybe tighten it just a tad?
&ndash;&gt; I would consider making the word spaces a thinner.
&ndash;&gt; The right bottom serif of the |l| is shorter than the left, was that intended?
&ndash;&gt; The |j| seems spaced a little tight on the right side compared to the rest.
&ndash;&gt; The |r| has an especially large gap to it&rsquo;s right, maybe try something to fix that? You could: (a) condense it a little, (b) make the join a little lower, (c) lengthen the right bottom serif a tad. A combination of all three wouldn&rsquo;t hurt, depending on what you&rsquo;re going for.
&ndash;&gt; The lower loop of the |g| is a wee bit off. Maybe a little too much towards a Garamond look. You might try looking at interesting type samples from near that era. Does anyone have some enticing examples? :-)
&ndash;&gt; The tail of the |R| and the |g| missing an ear might be off.</p>
<p>It would be good to mention that every single part of each glyph can be manipulated to your benefit. Don&rsquo;t ever be afraid to think outside the box.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t give up! Love to see you continue with this.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>A good start! I would encourage you to work on the consistency of the hairlines and serifs and stroke endings.</p>
<p>For the hairlines (especially on a Didone) they must all be the same thickness. From the crossbar on the &ldquo;f&rdquo; to the legs of the &ldquo;N&rdquo; and the top and bottom of rounded characters like the &ldquo;O&rdquo;, go for a consistent thickness throughout.</p>
<p>The serifs and stroke endings should also be consistently rounded (like on the &ldquo;E&rdquo;) or have the chiseled, straight-edged appearance of the rest of the serifs. Also, make sure the serifs appear to be about the same thickness as the hairlines. Right now they&rsquo;re a lot thinner looking.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Thanks everyone for the great feedback. I&rsquo;ll get to work on refining this with all the critiques in one.</p>
<p>Hrant - I was amazed too about the Baskerville spirit hiding in the hybrid. It wasn&rsquo;t what I was expecting, but I&rsquo;m really happy that it creates something recognizable, but unexpected. I&rsquo;ll work on the wonkiness as things get ironed out.</p>
<p>Briän - Thanks for all the nit-picks. It&rsquo;s just what I needed. All the things you&rsquo;re talking about were unintended. The caps being condensed, the spacing overall (not nearly done and considered), and the everything else. The funny part is that it started as a slightly condensed design, but then I decided to normalize it. I guess it wasn&rsquo;t quite enough.</p>
<p>Joshua - Thanks for the insight on the Didone construction. That&rsquo;ll help decrease the wonkiness Hrant was mentioning.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m fairly new to this whole process, and I&rsquo;ll try anything that y&rsquo;all have said. I&rsquo;ll report back by the end of the week. Thanks to all three, so much.</p>
