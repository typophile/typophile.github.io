  deco font. I tried finding it but couldn't. Silhouette is the closest I got: http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/letterperfect/silhouette/silhouette/\r\n\r\nAny
  suggestions? Any fonts that look like this?\r\n\r\nThanks, \r\n\r\nTal"

    Vertical</a>.

  body: "Stephen, you nailed it! That's the one they're using in Centropolis. Thanks!\r\n\r\nCurious,
    if I were to search Fontshop for this font, what keywords would I use besides
    Deco?\r\n"

  body: There aren't too many other <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/creative_alliance/aldous_vertical/">keywords
    attached to Aldous</a> on fontshop.com, but if you had a [[FontBook]] you would
    have found it pretty quick as a See Also reference under Huxley and others. We
    want to get that cross-reference info on the site someday.
