body: "From a licensing perspective, at what point does it start to become more cost
  efficient for a large corporation to commission a proprietary brand typeface over
  licensing an existing one?  (Of course there are many variables\u2026 but any general
  rules around number of licenses, types of licenses, etc.?)\r\n\r\nAnd in going about
  doing so - if an agency wants to commission a new typeface based on an existing
  typeface, what is the correct way of doing so (to avoid situations like this: http://typophile.com/node/66761)?
  What should the design agency have done in this case (other than not claim the font
  was \"proprietary\") ?  I assume the etiquette is to reach out and discuss/work
  with the original typeface's designer first (if they are still working professionally),
  adjust the typeface enough so that it is truly unique and worthy of a distinct name/file,
  and give credit (and/or compensation?) to major influences? \r\n\r\nI've been finding
  some posts that hint at some of this, but nothing direct. Sorry if this is a repeat
  question."

  body: "The buy vs build calculation is pretty easy. How much is the license for
    the rights you need? How much will a custom font cost to develop? Factor in how
    much do you value exclusivity vs how soon you need the font. If these figures
    come out to be about the same you can use them to negotiate a better license price
    from the foundry.\r\n\r\nWith respect to the \"pay someone to make a clone font\"
    question, unless the original design is in the public domain, very few (if any)
    self respecting type designers will make a clone for you. \r\n\r\nSo don't show
    the type designer the \"original\", just write a brief that describes exactly
    what you want, perhaps with some examples of a range of common typefaces that
    share some of the characteristics your looking for, eg. we want it to have serifs
    like... Nine times out of ten the results will be a better fit than the original."

  body: "There are indeed many variables! So many that it's\r\nhard to imagine anybody
    offering a workable formula.\r\n\r\nThe math for the raw numbers is easy: for
    the cost of\r\nthe number of \"seats\" of the existing font(s) that you\r\nneed,
    can you get a quality custom solution instead?\r\nMuch harder is quantifying how
    much exclusivity* is\r\nworth to you. Concerning which you might consider the\r\nfollowing
    useful twist: you can limit your exclusivity to\r\na number of years. This nicely
    lowers the cost without\r\noverly damaging the brand since time dilutes the novelty\r\nof
    a brand anyway.\r\n\r\n* Which requires quite a bit of deviation from\r\nan original;
    it might be better to simply start\r\nfrom scratch, and only point out specific
    fonts\r\nas sources of inspiration.\r\n\r\nDo you already have type designers
    you like to work with?\r\nIf not, please do consider asking my foundry for a quote:\r\nhpapazian

  body: "Thanks this is very helpful. \r\n\r\nI know it is hard to say what a custom
    typeface might cost - so let me rephrase... what ballpark are we in where licensing
    and custom design start to become comparable? I have no sense of this... $50K?
    $150K? More? Less?\r\n\r\n(assuming custom design may be for fortune 500 size
    org, opentype, 10 year exclusivity, say 6 faces - light/reg/bold and obliques
    of each, kerning tables, hinting, etc.) Any thoughts?"

  body: "A big factor in the pricing will be the size of the glyph set. This is usually
    where we start from in working out a price, which also means that we tend to do
    a lot of work up front with a potential client, discussing their language support
    needs, typography layout feature sets, reading environments, etc.. This planning
    work helps us to provide detailed price quotes, so the client understands exactly
    what they are paying for.\r\n\r\n[For the <a href=\"http://www.brill.nl/news/brill-typeface\">Brill
    fonts</a> we spent almost two years gradually developing a plan with them before
    we got to the contract signing phase. It doesn't normally take that long, but
    their needs were very extensive and even before they came to use they'd spent
    a long time cataloguing all the typeforms in their publications. Each font ended
    up containing more than 5,000 glyphs.]"
