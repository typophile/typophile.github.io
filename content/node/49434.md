  body: Thanks for the reply Stephen, its the closest one i could find as well, but
    unfortunately its not a perfect match.  Take a close look at the a & b for example,
    also the horizontal 'serif parts'are slanted in foundry form serif, and are really
    horizontal in this sample.

    font manager (http://www.typedna.com), and based our database..this is a similar
    match (not the exact):\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/res_3722.jpg]\r\n\r\nLet
    me know if you need other fonts that are similar, as I can provide a list of further
    matches.  If you are interested in registering as a beta tester for our software
    please visit http://www.typedna.com, this will allow you to play around with our
    recognition software first-hand and see how font manager differs from those currently
    available."
