  on the negative aspects of it. But isn't learning through copying of great value?
  Isn't the appropriation of old design to create new an important part of cultural
  evolution? Surely it's how the understanding gained from copying is then used that
  issues of copyright can arise.\r\n\r\nI have been invited to run a workshop at my
  old university and want to base it on the use of copying as a learning tool. Can
  anyone suggest examples of appropriation being effectively used? Or any further
  reading on the positive aspects of copying? \r\n\r\nI have so far read http://typophile.com/node/33080

    claims, which is a sign that your claims are too broadly stated.\r\n\r\nIt would
    be more educational to advance a thesis about where, in a particular design discipline,
    the line between appropriate and inappropriate copying should be drawn.\r\n\r\nAlso,
    the issue of copying (as an activity) is distinct from copyright (as a legal construct)
    \u2014\_be wary of merging them."

    example, I know a few people (and I am one) who think that trying to digitize
    an existing font from printed samples is a useful way to learn some things about
    letterforms and digital fonts, before drawing one\u2019s own type from scratch.\r\n\r\nOn
    the other hand, simply downloading font files from a server is not very educational.\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\nT"

    telling, because it's more likely to be used to describe activities such as plagiarism
    or outright theft. \"Re-purposing\" or \"reviving\" might be better choices, because
    this is what font revivalists do; we do not \"appropriate\" old designs. We lovingly
    re-craft them to new media, and almost universally pay homage to the original
    creators. The process is not so much cultural evolution as it is cultural archaeology:
    \ re-introducing historical  cultural trends into the mainstream, in order to
    enrich our typographic vocabulary. "

  body: "First, the students need to be informed of the ramifications of <a href=\"http://infolit.library.dal.ca/tutorials/AcademicIntegrity/\"><strong>plagiarism</strong></a>
    (and copyright as I read what has been posted in the time it took me to compose
    this).\r\n\r\nI was once given an assignment to design a piece emulating the style
    of a specific designer of our choice. When presenting our work to the studio,
    we were required to give a brief biography of the designer and examples of their
    work to back up our solution. In doing so we learned some history, cultural context,
    politics &c. as well as search and presentation skills. All important aspects
    of the assignment. A simple \u201Cchange the font\u201D solution would obviously
    not deserve a mark. Think <a href=\"http://www.blanka.co.uk/supersize?product=821\">M\xFCller-Brockmann\u2019s
    Der Film</a> set in Garamond. Keep in mind this was only a single project in a
    four year program. Anyone who continued to practice this way would simply be removed
    from the program, or fail due to their own ineptitude.\r\n\r\nAs long as the class/project
    is framed in such a way as \u201Cthis is an exercise in developing search skills,
    learning about the history of design(ers), the cultural context that influenced
    their work, the history of design and presentation skills\u201D I think you\u2019re
    OK. But churning out a group of students who simply scour fffound is doing them
    a disservice.\r\n\r\nI often use the analogy of MDs taking advantage of constantly
    updated drug databases that contain information about the medicines side effects
    and their interactions in an effort to remove human error but if all they did
    was base their decisions upon previous research the practice of medicine would
    not advance due to a lack of original thought. I dub this dilemma as \u201Csearch
    versus solve.\u201D\r\n\r\nUltimately, I believe teaching students how to think
    for themselves is a no-brainer (pun intended)."

  body: "Thank you very much for your comments, they've been of great help. \r\n\r\nStarting
    from the top and working down:\r\n\r\nMatthew\r\nThe focus of the workshop will
    be editorial design. I agree it's important to distinguish the issue of copying
    from copyright - perhaps half the workshop will be on copying, half on copyright.\r\n\r\nThomas\r\nI
    mean copying to mean very much your first example - to digitise an existing font
    from print samples - although in my instance it will more likely be to digitise
    a layout.\r\n\r\nThere's nothing educational in downloading font files from a
    server.\r\n\r\nNick\r\nThank you for bring my attention to my choice of terms.
    'Appropriation' is not the right word for the message I wish to convey - 'reinterpreting'
    is perhaps closer. This extract from Susan Blackmore's book feels relevant to
    my thoughts: \r\n\r\n<cite>\u201CThe advent of imitation was, I suggest, the turning
    point in hominid evolution... All evolutionary processes depend on an accurate
    copying mechanism, and that mechanism tends to evolve towards higher and higher
    fidelity. Imitation may not have started as very accurate at all, but it was still
    the essential copying process without which cultural evolution could never have
    taken off. Only once human imitation was sufficiently accurate (and we do not
    yet know exactly how accurate that is) could memetic evolution begin. Once it
    began, increasing creativity was inevitable.\r\n\r\n<cite>Blackmore, Susan \u2018Memes
    minds and imagination\u2019 In Imaginative Minds (Proceedings of the British Academy
    2008) Ed by Ilona Roth. Oxford University Press\r\n\r\nChristopher (and Frank)\r\nI
    think we're running along the same lines! The exercise is not about cutting and
    pasting; it will be about deconstructing a piece of work to understand the process
    involved in creating it. On the whole the course is highly self-directed and free
    thinking which I feel could benefit from a one-off, old fashioned workshop. \r\n "

    monkey do\" is THE seminal moment in hominid evolution: certainly, political operatives
    and advertising execs depend on thoughtless imitative behavior to further their
    agendas, and would agree with the premise wholeheartedly. However, since it appears
    that no one can agree on precisely what memetic evolution is--or that it even
    exists--I doubt that much stock should be placed in Ms. Blackmore's observations..."

    the department\u2019s template and re-populated it with their own content, compared
    to someone who made an effort to come up with original thought and solutions based
    upon what they had learned from class. This is even more obvious when you ask

    my mind now. \r\n\r\n'Reverse engineering' seems far more appropriate a term than
    'copying'. I by no means want to encourage copy-culture - I just want to instill
    some basic principles and get students thinking about the structure behind design.
    Reverse engineering is something I have found very useful to further my knowledge
    - I don't think it is always the case of 'monkey see, monkey do'. I also feel
    it's something that - when used as learning tool and not as template - should
    be viewed in a positive light and not considered taboo. Having graduated from
    the same course several years ago I am very aware that some people completed the
    course without learning hardly any basic principles. It's a great course for encouraging
    creative thought but I think it could really benefit by being underpinned with
    a slightly old fashioned exercise. "
