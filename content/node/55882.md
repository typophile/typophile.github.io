  body: "I think the reason you haven't been able to find it is that it may be a customization
    of one or more fonts (or simply a custom font). I would say the 'a' is the hardest
    letter to find a match for, but the S, t and k (with part of the stem serif cut
    off) could have come from Memphis, the 'e' could be rotated and edited, from the
    same font. Leaving only the 'a' needing a source. It might even be borrowed from
    a sans face, with serifs added. Of course it could have been custom from the start,
    but for people who can't design fonts, like me, it could be cobbled together from
    other parts pretty simply.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
