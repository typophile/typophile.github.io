  mind as to which one I prefer.\r\n\r\nI was going for <strong>[[http://www.fonts.com/findfonts/detail.htm?productid=713961|Linotype/Adobe
  Janson Text]]</strong> when I stumbled upon the recently released <strong>[[http://www.fonts4ever.com/portrait_typeface.php?id=5|E+F
  Kis Antiqua Now]]</strong> ([[http://www.fonts4ever.com/download/goodies/Kis_Antiqua_Now_Schriftmuster.pdf|sample]],
  [[http://www.fonts4ever.com/download/goodies/Kis_Antiqua_Now_Schriftportrait.pdf|portrait]])
  which seems very nice. And then there's [[http://www.fonts.com/findfonts/detail.htm?productid=215876|Monotype
  Janson]].\r\n\r\nWhich Janson/Kis typeface is your favourite, and why?\r\nPlease
  share your thoughts, and feel free to suggest alternatives! ([[http://www.fonts.com/findfonts/detail.htm?productid=215276|Monotype
  Ehrhardt]]?)\r\n\r\nThank you for any comments - and for a wonderful site!"

  body: "Kis Antiqua Now is the most impressive to me and the character set is rather
    large in comparison to other versions. \r\n\r\nApart from Kis Antiqua Now, Janson
    Text (Adobe/Linotype) is probably the most common choice: http://www.textism.com/textfaces/index.html?id=14\r\n\r\nIt
    might depend as well on the language you want to use it for. The capitals in Janson
    Text are quite tall I find, not unusually, but Kis Antiqua Now is a bit more contemporary
    in this regard."

    I will mostly use the typeface for text in Danish and English. However, I will
    occasionally use it for German bodycopy as well, so you're right in pointing out
    the issue of the size and feel of capitals.\r\n\r\nIndra,\r\nI'm no lawyer, but
    thank you for the link. I will definitely have a look at Equity.\r\n\r\nKeep the
    comments coming!"

  body: "Oh, I don\u2019t think Equity is restricted to the use by lawyers at all.
    The intention was (I think) to make it suitable for long text, office printers
    and, to some extend, \u201Claymen proof\u201D i.e. easy to set well. But Matthew
    explains it better on his website.\r\nEspecially the distinct and well-spaced
    punctuation caught my attention, probably because I had to deal with some less
    attentively crafted typefaces recently (had the pleasure to test it for a while
    and it\u2019s bliss to set and read text in)."

    for Lawyers\u201D.\r\n\r\nInteresting observations about punctuation and legibility!
    Perhaps somebody has got similar experiences with the other Janson fonts \u2013
    ? I would like to hear something about the overall usefulness of the various Jansons,
    including the Kis Antiqua New, if anybody has had the opportunity to use it yet."

  body: "What I ment to say is, that you probably can't go wrong with something which
    is a relative of one the most used typefaces in the 20th century. \r\n\r\nStanley
    Morison called Janson \"an excellent letter\". \r\n\r\nIt is well received by
    Bringhurst:\r\n\r\n\u201CA number of typefaces designed for the Linotype were
    <strong>artis-\r\ntically successful</strong> in spite of these constraints. Hermann
    Zapf's\r\nAldus and Optima, Rudolf Ruzicka\u2019s Fairfield) Sem Hartz\u2019s
    Ju-\r\nliana, and W. A. Dwiggin\u2019s Electra, Caledonia and Falcon were\r\nall
    designed for the Linotype machine. <strong>Linotype Janson</strong>, adap-\r\nted
    by Zapf in 1952 from the seventeenth-century originals of\r\nMikles Kis, <strong>is
    another eminent success</strong>. Many Linotype faces\r\nhave nevertheless been
    modified in the of digitization,\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CLinotype\r\nJanson Text (1985)
    likewise seems to me the most successful\r\ndigital version. It was prepared under
    the supervision of Adrian\r\nFrutiger, based on Kis)s originals and on Zapf's
    excellent Lino-\r\ntype machine version.\u201D\r\n\r\nI think the two new Variants
    Kis Antiqua Now and Equity are finally doing it justice for the digital world. "

    will be available shortly. [[http://typo.la/equity|(PDF sample available now.)]]\r\n\r\nFor
    color and texture, I\u2019ve always liked Janson Text and Monotype Ehrhardt a
    lot. But I don\u2019t use them very much because I find some of the details distractingly
    quaint (the droopy ear on the lowercase g comes to mind). Also, digital Ehrhardt
    is a pale representation of the metal version.\r\n\r\nWith Equity, I took hot-metal
    Ehrhardt as a model and pushed it to be more contemporary and less quaint. Like
    my last font family, FB Alix, the project was inspired by my work with legal typography,
    but all are welcome.\r\n \r\n\r\nJanson fans should also be aware of David Berlow\u2019s
    excellent titling Janson, called [[http://www.fontbureau.com/fonts/KisFB/|Kis
