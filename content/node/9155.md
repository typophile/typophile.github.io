body: like many pixel font junkies, i&#39;m continually inspired by miguel hernandez.
  his fundamental typeface has been one of my favorites for years, and i have always
  wanted to try my hand at a character set that featured those fabulous peaks throughout
  the lowercase set. <BR> <BR>so, i finally committed an evening to doing something
  about it, and katie is the result. <BR> <BR>now, i know nothing of script typefaces.
  in fact, i have very little traditional type heritage knowledge. i just like creating
  the pixel letterforms. usually, not a problem. <BR> <BR>now, it&#39;s a big problem,
  because i have NO idea where to start with the upper case. <BR> <BR>i&#39;m thinking
  the uppers will be very subdued compared to the lowers. <BR> <BR>can anyone point
  me in a direction to follow? <BR> <BR>also, i&#39;m having trouble with the second
  half of the lc character set. they lean, where the rest are upright. i&#39;m not
  sure there&#39;s much i can do about it though. <BR> <BR>is the second version too
  &#34;scripty&#34; ? <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/64968.gif"

  body: This is quite lovely. &#40;I like your icon too!&#41; Can it be spaced a pixel
    tighter? The -x- in &#34;katie &#40;second&#41;&#34; seems to be leaning in the
    opposite direction of the others. I love the -g- in &#34;katie &#40;first&#41;&#34;.
    Nice overall.

    just slays me.'

  body: trying to marry the characters better. especially between the second half
    of the set and the first. <BR> <BR>since i can&#39;t think of a way to stand the
    second half upright, i&#39;ve tried to tilt the first half toward the second.
    <BR> <BR>flows a bit better this way, and besides, the a, b, c, d, e, g, o, p,
    and q all are made of the same bowl now. <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/64985.gif"

  body: well, the upper case set is functioning at least. i really don&#39;t know
    how much more i can tweak it, but i&#39;ll keep trying. <BR> <BR>i thought i might
    create a script uppercase, but that was a disaster. so i went with the more conservaative
    approach; essentially turning the font into an upright italics. <BR> <BR>sort
    of. <BR> <BR>the vertical nature of the set as a whole is rather hard for me to
    capture with the uppers while simultaneously giving them any sort of curvature.
    everything ends up looking angular. <BR> <BR>any critical eyeballing is most welcome.

  body: I think you may find it wise to eliminate the descender of the &#34;l&#34;.
    It reads like a &#34;long s&#34; to me.

  body: katie is very elegant, tyler - i like it. <BR> <BR>i agree with kevin that
    the long &#39;l&#39; is distracting. <BR> <BR>i think the uppercase fits well
    to the lowercase. maybe you could try to make the stem of the &#39;Y&#39; vertical?
    <BR> <BR>you can also try to extend it to bigger sizes &#40;15, 17, 19...&#41;
    - it will get even lighter and softer. <BR> <BR>i can imagine this font in a composition
    with a big capital, ornamented borders &#40;something like your icon&#41;... <BR>
    <BR>have fun, <BR>- g.

  body: after seeing how the first uppercase set forced me into an italic font rather
    than a script font, i decided to see what a non-italic version would look like.
    <BR> <BR>i&#39;m still trying to capture an elegant script uppercase set, but
    it&#39;s slow going. <BR> <BR>in the mean time, here&#39;s a few variations of
    katie so far. <BR> <BR>kevin and gustavo, thanks for your help. i&#39;ve noted
    your desire to see a baseline l. i haven&#39;t been able to make one i like yet,
    because it looks like it&#39;s leaning awkwardly without the long tail to balance
    it. <BR> <BR>i&#39;ll put something up soon. <BR> <BR>it&#39;s a pleasure to have
    your feedback stephen. thanks again for your time everyone. <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/65093.gif"

  body: getting crazy with the cheese-wiz here. <BR> <BR>many of these characters
    are either a&#41; place fillers until i can figure out better solutions, b&#41;
    satisfactory solutions for a script set, but not necessarily THIS script set,
    or c&#41; i don&#39;t know. i haven&#39;t figured out c yet. <BR> <BR>scripts
    are very complex! <BR> <BR>isn&#39;t it better if all the characters&#39; ascenders
    and descenders arc the same way? <BR> <BR>i&#39;ve done what i can to research
    existing sets on the web, but each one is so unique, it really doesn&#39;t do
    me much good as far as extrapolating a basic set of rules to follow. <BR> <BR>all
    i know is that these scripts aren&#39;t working yet. i&#39;ll keep tinkering.

    lower one.. <BR> <BR>One thing though, the scripty lower case &#39;r&#39; maybe
    looks to much like a &#39;n&#39;.. <BR><i>&#40; The sample for me currently reads
    &#39;The Quick Brown Fox Jumps Oven The Lazy Dog&#39;.. &#41;</i>

  body: Tyler this is getting better and better. I can see how the -l- could read
    as a -long-S- but I think context helps a lot. Hmm. Tough call. Either way I am
    really loving this. Lots of fun. Alternates can make or break a typeface, but
    you have offered so many it can ONLY be a good thing. &#40;It always sucks when
    a typeface says it has alternate characters and the reality is that two of the
    characters have alternates.&#41;
