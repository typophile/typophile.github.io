  and character when on their own, not in a word with other letters.\r\n\r\nDo we
  recognize their individual quality much more?\r\n\r\nwhen on their own do we study
  the form of the letters in more detail as we are not distracted by other letters?\r\n\r\nDo
  components such as Ascenders, Counter, eye, fillet, ear, loop, leg, stem etc give
  it a individual personality?\r\n\r\nDoes this allow us to make more assumptions
  and comments on what the letter form communicates to us?\r\n\r\nCan individual characters
  have more human character when on their own as we notice certain attributes when
  may not of seen when arranged with others?\r\n\r\nany comments?"

  body: For me it's the g. For some reason I'm really attracted to it and end up studying
    it more than other letters. But I guess when you just see one letter, you see
    it as a whole and so pay more attention to it. It has no context and so loses
    its meaning, becoming only a shape.

    doubt about that! But then the appreciation typefaces, especially text faces,
    goes much beyond the beauty of individual letter forms. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
