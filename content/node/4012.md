  body: My analysis isn&#39;t expert, but you asked for it. <BR> <BR>For me, the unique
    character of the serifs in Avance doesn&#39;t lie in their asymmetry, half serif
    designs have been around &#40;I can&#39;t name any, I&#39;m sure the veterans
    can help me out here&#41;, but rather the unique character lies in the flaring
    sides of the stem opposite the serif. This brings some of the feel of an italicized
    face to the type without giving it a measurable slant. <BR> <BR>Even though the
    stems of glyphs have no slant, some glyphs seem to express a slight slant of a
    few degrees. The outer outline of the <b>o</b> seems to have this slant, while
    the counter is nearly vertically upright. The <b>c</b> and <b>e</b> share a large
    part of their outer edge with the <b>o</b> glyph, with the same slant. The upper
    arm of the <b>c</b> even extends further right than the bottom arm, emphasizing
    the slant. The left side of the lower chamber of the <b>g</b> extends further
    to the left than the top chamber, drawing this slant. Unlike most fonts, the <b>s</b>
    doesn&#39;t retract its arms narrower than its loops in an effort to find balance,
    but instead adopts a slight lean. This effort to show slope extends to the upper
    case, in particular in the <b>G</b> and <b>B</b>, whose upper arm and loop respectively
    extend further right than conventionally. <BR> <BR>I have a problem with the <b>t</b>
    glyph. Its curved stem looks great when the glyph stands alone, but composed in
    text it feels like it&#39;s trying to squirm away. It doesn&#39;t share the same
    serif structure that the other stems do, but this doesn&#39;t mean it shouldn&#39;t
    march to the same rhythm. The <b>g</b> glyph is also too dark. It weighs down
    the words in which it participates. <BR> <BR>The size that the Daidala archives
    were set in works well on the screen &#40;though I suspect this is because the
    text is gray&#41;, but feels too large when printed. The contrast is so even that
    it feels heavy around 11pt. I found it much more pleasant to read at something
    like 8pt. Then again, I have young eyes. <BR> <BR>I like this font, especially
    for the shape of the upper case. The conventional design of the upper case serif
    alphabet has been so regularized that it looks identical in so many different
    fonts. Avance brings the upper case a fresh feel that takes advantage of our expanded
    tolerance for experimentation in this post-emigre era.

  body: 'Interesting analysis. <BR> <BR>&#62; half serif designs have been around
    <BR> <BR>Actually, it&#39;s surprising how few there are. Meier has a couple,
    but they&#39;re way too calligraphic, and don&#39;t have any &#34;counterweighting&#34;
    like Avance does, so they lean backwards - very distracting. The French seem to
    do it sometimes: Mandel has one, and it&#39;s pretty cool; JFP has Angie, and
    Thierry Puyfoulhoux has Cicero, but those two don&#39;t have enough serifs, they&#39;re
    more like a sans with instrokes. Then there&#39;s Rotis Semi-Serif, but it also
    has too few serifs. <BR> <BR>Avance, and Burke&#39;s recent Parable are the only
    two that I would personally use for text. Wait, I&#39;d also use my Harrier &#40;basically
    the Latin &#34;subordinate&#34; of my Nour&#41;, but I don&#39;t think anybody
    else would...  :-/ <BR> <BR>&#62; flaring sides <BR> <BR>I was fortunate to get
    to know Evert during the ATypI-Boston conference &#40;thanks Phan, wherever you
    are&#41;, and he showed me Avance &#40;called something else back then, I think&#41;,
    around a year before FontFont started selling it. As his explanation for Avance
    on the FF site might indicate, he needed to see the reason for serifs before incorporating
    them into his work, and at first he just put them plainly on the top-left and
    bottom-right ends of strokes/elements. But then he realized they were leaning
    backwards... and he started wrestling with the possible solutions. He decided
    to add those flares to balance things. As for myself, in Harrier, I wanted to
    avoid the soft femininity of flares, so instead I slanted the whole thing forward
    as gently as possible: 1/16 = ~3.58 degrees. Interestingly, some famous slanted
    fonts &#40;like Unger&#39;s Flora and Gill&#39;s Joanna Italic&#41; use an angle
    close to that. <BR> <BR>This makes your observations of slight slanting in some
    glyphs very relevant. How much of it was intentional, I wonder. <BR> <BR>&#62;
    The g glyph is also too dark <BR> <BR>Huh, I hadn&#39;t noticed that. But it&#39;s
    very slight. <BR>What might have helped is an open bottom. <BR> <BR>&#62; feels
    heavy around 11pt. <BR> <BR>Yes, Avance is a chunky friendly face - in fact a
    bit too cloying for my tastes&#42;. The huge x-height makes it work better at
    small sizes. This is most apparent in the book &#34;John Kelly&#34;, where Avance
    is used &#40;with no credit anywhere...&#41; for the titles, text and captions,
    and it&#39;s in this last usage where it shines the most. <BR> <BR>&#42; Which
    doesn&#39;t dampen my ideological admiration for it: I think it&#39;s a landmark
    work, the most significant entry in the FF library. <BR> <BR>&#62; Avance brings
    the upper case a fresh feel <BR> <BR>The Latin UC set is so paradoxical: it&#39;s
    so much better balanced than the lc set, but it&#39;s also less readable, and
    used for only about 5% of text. It&#39;s a very tricky decision what to do with
    it: make it conform to the lc&#42;, make it it&#39;s own thing, or something in
    the middle. Pragmatism dictates that the last option would be the best, but I
    personally haven&#39;t been able to pull that off yet &#40;and I actually don&#39;t
    think Avance does either - although maybe it doesn&#39;t even try&#41;, so I&#39;ve
    reverted to the second option. &#40;I&#39;m talking structurally - matching the
    finish is easy&#41;. <BR> <BR>&#42; BTW, I&#39;ve always thought Uncial caps are
    better. <BR> <BR>On to Sonoma... <BR>'

    <BR> <BR>The text accompanying this reads &#40;in part&#41;: <BR> <BR>&#34;The
    stems of Icone flare emphatically toward their terminals, and the flares are asymmetric,
    stronger at the upper left entrances and lower right exits of strokes, echoing
    the ductus of a carolingian or humanist hand. The only straight lines in the lower
    case are brief horizontal terminations of strokes at the baseline, ascender line,
    cap line, and x line, occasional crossbars, and brief vertical terminations of
    curves in letters like c and s. In the capitals, straights appear only in the
    horizontal arms and crossbars of letters like E and H, and in the middle of sections
    of vertical stems. Icone remains a challenge to digital technology, but today
    &#40;1988&#41; there are high resolution digital typesetters that can render it

  body: 'Thanks a lot for the Icone scan. I do remember seeing it, but in this context
    I&#39;m struck by the resemblance to Avance - even the cuddliness. A French type
    designer once told me that Bloemsma really admires Excoffon&#39;s work &#40;and
    by extension French type design in general?&#41;, but he didn&#39;t mean it in
    a nice way, and I reject that &#40;even though I admire the flying French playboy
    myself&#41;. But there&#39;s certainly some parallel evolution there - compare
    FF Balance to Olive. <BR> <BR>&#62; Hope you didn&#39;t choke on that &#34;ductus&#34;
    there. <BR> <BR>Yeah, it&#39;s a good thing I&#39;d already finished by chocolate
    donut... <BR> <BR>That&#39;s what&#39;s paradoxical about the semi-serif: even
    designers who are dedicated to chirographic type don&#39;t seem to implement them.
    And you know that Bloesma is strongly anti-chirographic - the type gods bless
    his soul. <BR> <BR>-- <BR> <BR>The Menhart, I didn&#39;t know about &#40;or at

    thanks! I&#39;d say that it has enough serifs to be a text font, and the vertical
    prorportions are very good for book work. I&#39;d love to see something set in
    it. And that UC &#34;U&#34; is masterful. <BR> <BR>So you&#39;re saying it&#39;s

  body: 'I know for a fact that Linotype have outlines for Icone, so there is no need
    to revive it: you just have to create a demand for it. There are probably lots
    of typefaces out there in digital limbo: halfway between photo or early computer
    typesetting and today&#39;s formats. Ikarus data probably exists for most of the
    typefaces developed in the late 1970s and early 1980s. Sometimes the Ikarus digitisation
    was done hurriedly, or a bad IK-&#62;PS conversion done, so the outlines would
    require a lot of clean-up and comparison to printed samples from earlier technology,
    which explains why some designs have not been released yet. <BR> <BR>Since Adrian
    Frutiger is still alive and Icone is owned by Linotype, &#39;reviving&#39; it
    would not be ethical. Of course, designing original new designs in the same genre
