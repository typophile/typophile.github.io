    body: Thanks defiantone. I wrote that passage on the site originally but I've
      had to question this character as it doesn't look like the others which all
      look quite historical.

  body: Looks like a bespoke monogram to me. For what it's worth, if I have to reproduce
    it, I'd start from any "[[http://www.myfonts.com/search/trajan|Trajan]]-like"
    of my choice, remove crossbar and add a custom one based on /~. Then, I'd contruct
    the corresponding counterless background "sans".

      too.\r\nMuch appreciated."

title: Is this logo from a typeface or a bespoke monogram?
