  body: 'Really sorry to be such a poor help on this one. The more I look at it the
    more I think it could be 2 different fonts. Have a look to /G, its outline shape
    is completely different from /C. Top one looks "[[http://www.myfonts.com/search/eurostile|Eurostile]]-ish"
    and bottom one rather (aforementioned) "Ethnocentric-ish". Try having a look to
    [[http://www.dafont.com/theme.php?cat=303|Techno > Sci-fi]], [[http://www.dafont.com/theme.php?cat=304|Techno
    > Various]] and [[http://www.dafont.com/theme.php?cat=501|Basic > Sans serif]]
    DaFont sections too, it could help. Some I came across with: [[http://www.dafont.com/orion-pax.font|Orion
    Pax]], [[http://www.dafont.com/jefferies.font|Jefferies]], [[http://www.dafont.com/4kstncl.font|4KSTNCL]]'
