  body: "Michel, your work is close to that of Ulrich and it's interesting. Based
    on his findings I collected [[https://www.dropbox.com/s/0k3uuodvksltjxq/Stiehl2007-color.pdf]]\r\nFor
    some ligatures like sla with Siddhanta you show 2 variants, but visually I can't
    find a difference. What do you mean by them? Or there was a difference in the
    books you quote, but none in Mihas font?\r\nHow did you tel TeX to show different
    ligatures of the same sounds? I'm not familiar with Unix-like Nagari fonts, is
    there an .ttf or .otf file which can be downloaded to reproduce the same on my
    PC? .pdf is good for looking, but bad for working with it further. I'm working
    on compiling a list for a Sanskrit Reader. I made a concordance based on 14 Sanskrit
    Grammar's and it shows more than 1046 yours and more than 807 Ulrich's. As Ulrich's
    algorithm is not open source, one will have to do it once again, to check his
    words."

    package <code>skt.sty</code> uses Type 1 PostScript fonts.\r\n<pre>\r\nskt8.pfb
    \    PS Type 1 font file for skt font at 8pt upright.\r\nskt9.pfb     PS Type
    1 font file for skt font at 9pt upright.\r\nskt10.pfb    PS Type 1 font file for
    skt font at 10pt upright.\r\nsktb10.pfb   PS Type 1 font file for skt font at
    10pt upright bold.\r\nsktf10.pfb   PS Type 1 font file for skt font at 10pt upright
    feint.\r\nskts10.pfb   PS Type 1 font file for skt font at 10pt slanted.\r\nsktbs10.pfb
    \ PS Type 1 font file for skt font at 10pt bold slanted.\r\nsktfs10.pfb  PS Type
    1 font file for skt font at 10pt feint slanted.\r\n</pre>\r\n(the list above is
    a copy-paste from the <a href=\"http://mirror.its.dal.ca/ctan/fonts/ps-type1/sanskrit/README\">README</a>
    file).\r\n\r\nFor instance the file <code>skt10.pfb</code>, Wikner Sanskrit 10pt
    Upright, contains 222 glyphs that, put together, can give a nice looking pdf output.
    To put those 222 pieces together in order to produce a final Sanskrit text from
    an ASCII input file, a preprocessor whose source is contained in the file <code>skt.c</code>
    (coming with the texlive 2012 distribution) needs to be used. "
