<div class="post-content e-content" itemprop=articleBody>The cast concrete plaque in the attached image is from an old overpass bridge over Highway 401 East of Toronto.
I'm curious to know if the name and numerals are from an actual typeface or is it lettering by the sculptor?
There Used to be a 4 plaques like this, showing the street name, the year and the motto (VT INCEPIT FIDELIS SIC PERMANET) on every bridge over a 400 series highway in Ontario, so it would seem to make sense for it to be from a typeface.
thanks,
russ</div>

<div class=commentbody>I'd guess it's custom by the sculptor. If it's molded in concrete, there could have been a standard set of dies made up for the letters and numerals, but my guess is that each one would have been hand-carved from what appears to be sandstone.

EDIT: Didn't read that it was concrete. I stand by my die hypothesis.</div>

<div class=commentbody>I think Lex's idea makes a lot of sense, although it also seems possible that the dies he suggested were based on an existing typeface. I notice the '7' is quite odd -- more like an upside-down 'L'. I can't think of a typeface with that feature. This date was 1947. Are all the bridges of a similar age, and were the plaques made when the bridges were built, or added on later?
Would you have any more samples of the lettering? For my purposes only the R and E in this sample are useful as key letters. I'd like to know what the C, G, J, K, M, U or W look like to have more to base an ID on.

<div class=commentbody>I've been looking through some fonts in the previous FontBook, and Joe Treacy's <a href=http://www.treacyfaces.com/050806_TFHabitat_2c5a.html>'Habitat'</a> seems like a pretty good match for the letters in 'LIVERPOOL'. That font was designed in 1985, but who knows if it was based on anything older. [Note: you need to use the site's 'TRY' feature to see the range of weights for the font.]

<div class=commentbody>Thanks.
I think you must be right about the use of dies.
That 7 sure is quirky.
