In each I'm using the same fonts (so far I have Frutiger I'm sure about) but in literature I use the serif in italic, in music the normal serif and in politics the small caps serif.  <BR> <BR>I'm hesitating between Minion MM or Bembo as a serif.

		<div class="commentbody">I have read that the digital version of Bembo, as opposed to the great original metal version, has problems. In the discussion on the Yale site for Matthew Carter's new face for Yale, influenced by the metal Bembo, he mentions the weakness of the digital version. <BR> <BR>I know the original Minion and Minion Pro, which is definitely better. I don't know the MM version, but I have read on these boards that the Pro version is improved from it.  <BR> <BR>Minion Pro is wonderfully serviceable because of its completeness: optical weights, and small caps in all sizes, as well as small caps semi-bold, bold, italic, swash characters, ornaments, etc. A bonus is also that you can use Poetica as a formal script companion to Minion, as its letterforms are similar to Minion italic.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I can only comment as a reader, not a professional. But &hellip; <BR> <BR>I'd avoid digital Bembo. It really is grey and dull. It's a terrible pity, because it was in its day such an exquisitely fine typeface: deep warm black type on cream paper. Now it's hardly ever any good. (The Tufte books are fine, but iirc he set in metal then printed from a proof). I think it should be sent to an honourable grave, or reworked a la the New Yale typeface. <BR> <BR>If you must use Bembo, please use ff, ffl and ffi ligatures and OS numbers. Bembo really needs them. <BR> <BR>I personally dislike Minion. You see much too much of it. It's too mannered and too polished. But far sooner Minion than Bembo. But on the whole I'm with the re-open nominations crowd. <BR> <BR>Dante, suggested above, is nice. The other possibility if you are looking for a classic &quot;academic but friendly&quot; look is some sort of Baskerville &ndash; alongside Bembo the type of choice for that sort of product in the mid-20th century. But they've been largely killed by digitization as well. I have seen one book (history) in Storm Baskerville, which I thought looked as it should, but I'm not sure about the figures. I don't know if anyone has experience of using it.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I don't want anyone to think that I disparage Minion; I can see its virtues, but I cannot love them. I guess it's a matter of taste. Minion seems to me slightly mannered, perhaps too polished, its elegance too studied. When it comes to tea, it spreads its napkin carefully, drops no crumbs, eats its cake with a fork and holds its cup ever-so-daintily. It avoids talking about sex, religion or politics. It leaves when it should and writes its thank-you note that evening. One's mother says, &quot;When are you having that nice Minion over, such a charming boy.&quot; I prefer something a little rougher, quirkier, more dangerous. <BR> <BR>And because it's such a pleasant guest, one does see it around a lot. Better, no doubt and by far, than some of the others one sees all the time. But unlikely to thrill.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">An understandable concern! But as long as the font is OpenType and has real small caps, the small caps formatting in InDesign will use those real small caps. Otherwise it will indeed synthesize fake small caps. <BR> <BR>Emilie, you might want to browse the OpenType User Guide. I put in a lot of info about exactly these sorts of concerns. See <a href="http://www.adobe.com/type/opentype" target="_blank"><a href="http://www.adobe.com/type/opentype">http://www.adobe.com/type/opentype</a></a> and look for the link on the right. <BR> <BR>Cheers, <BR> <BR>T</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Hi Thomas, <BR> <BR>That's going to be helpful as well. <BR> <BR>Is there a way to know when you have real small caps in a font or when they are being faked? (not just Minion but in general, in InDesign) <BR> <BR>Thanks! <BR> <BR>Em <BR></div>

		<div class="commentbody">Em, <BR> <BR>If you look at the comparison of fake and real small caps in the OpenType User Guide (linked previously), I think that it's pretty clear from just the weight differences. That is, fake small caps always look too light (using caps, lower-case or real small caps for comparison). <BR> <BR>If you want to tell &quot;is there a small cap feature in the font) you can use the Glyph Palette in Illustrator CS or InDesign. It allows you to filter by layout feature, so you can see what all the, say, swash glyphs look like. Or all the small caps. <BR> <BR>One can also go online to adobe.com and drill down to the page for the font, and see a bunch of turqoise blue (cyan) icons on the right that tell you what kinds of goodies are in the font. Or one can download the &quot;glyph complement&quot; PDF to see them. <BR> <BR>Regards, <BR> <BR>T</div>

It's a worthwhile list to read through in general. Apologies if this is old news for you, Em.</div>
