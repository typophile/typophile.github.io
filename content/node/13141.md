body: Recently, after learning of the roots of italic, I have been paying more attention
  to them and how it seems that majiscules in Italic sets never really seem to fit.
  The more I look at them, the uppercase is basically just angled. I realize they
  have been redrawn for the set, but does anyone else sense that disconnect between
  the upper and lowercase in Italic sets ?

    between lc and UC in basic Roman! A \"solution\" I myself have used in italic
    caps: semi-serifs (see Patria).\r\n\r\nBut deeper and more drastic solution would
    be to delve into uncials...\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: As I pondered my question after I posted today, would a Script-esque Uppercase,
    more condensed, obviously specifically drawn for the lc italics be a solution.
    I'm going to do some experiments.

    than the roman used for italic type and might give you at least a historic reference.\r\n\r\nSample

  body: Norbert, that sample is amazing. Has anyone attempted a digital interpretation
    of Arrighi's calligraphy? Looks like a prime candidate to me...

    Bello would be soooooooo nice. With that and Zapfino, pens are in for extinction!

  body: I believe [[James Grieshaber]] may be working on an OT version of <a href="http://www.p22.com/ihof/operinaset.html">Operina</a>.
    If it's anything like <a href="http://www.p22.com/products/cezannepro.html">Cezanne
    Pro</a>, then expect very cool OT features.
