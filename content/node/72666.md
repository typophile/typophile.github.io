    sad news from a post by a member on The Briar Press. I had not met Georg in person,
    however we had been communicating often in the past few months as he was helping
    me equip my letterpress workshop. We spoke less than a week before the operation.
    Georg was reflective. He said that he did not feel like a man of this time, but
    rather a man of the early twentieth century. I feel lucky that our paths did cross
    and to have known Georg even for this short time. I feel a sense of loss at all
    of the discussions on the printing craft that we will not have. His death is a
    great loss to the entire letterpress community.\r\n\r\nMy sincere condolences
    to his family and friends.\r\n\r\nGeorg, wir geben Sie zur\xFCck ins Blei. Gott
    gr\xFC\xDF die Kunst!\r\n\r\n- Pierre Ranger\r\nAtelier Locomotive"
