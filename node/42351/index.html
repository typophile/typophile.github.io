<p>Of course, I NEVER meant to say that these types are &lsquo;the same&rsquo; or to imply fraud etc. I love Gotham, I really do, and I understand they are two different typefaces. Though, they share a lot in the design, and considering their two very different influences (frutiger claimed being influenced only by Futura, and Frere-Jones claimed being influenced only by the vernacular inscriptions of New York buildings), it is a subject of curiosity for me, on which I wish to have your point of view - I hope that for some of you, it will be a little bit longer than a two letters word.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>On the caps your samples are significantly different. Gotham follows the 19th century pattern of relatively equal widths to the caps, whereas Avenir follows more the classical roman model, following being more influenced by Futura, which it is a an variation of. The lower cases of the two are more similar&ndash;and both are similar to Futura, though with shorter extenders in the case of Avenir, and much shorter in the case of Gotham. One of the points of Avenir vs Futura was to have the two story a, which Gotham also has.</p>
<p>I suspect that if  you look at the lower cases of all &lsquo;geometric&rsquo; sans, the differences are going to be even more subtle than is usually the case between typefaces.</p>

I am actually looking at a lot of geometric sans, and the differences are not that subtle: the lower case caracters of Kabel, Avant Garde, Futura&hellip; are really very different. the thing is, i can clearly see the influence of late 19th grotesques in gotham, but i tend to also see it in Avenir, especially in the caps, altogether with the obvious spirit of futura et al; if so, how come i can not find any reference about this in frutiger&rsquo;s interviews and books? or, ami i seeing something where there is nothing?</p>

<p>You say it yourself: both typefaces have a common inspiration: Futura — since the Art Deco-ish inscriptions of those buildings were direct derivations of Futura and the US-made rip-offs thereof. 
Futura IS off course one of the most influentual typefaces of the modern age.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>David, [[http://www.linotype.com/90672/avenirnext-family.html#|this summary from the paragraph]] on Avenir Next is pretty revealing. Evidently Frutiger&rsquo;s &lsquo;brief&rsquo; was to &ldquo;humanize&rdquo; Futura, which involved introducing a bit of contrast between horizontal and vertical, as well has the &ldquo;a&rdquo;.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Art Deco-ish inscriptions of those buildings were direct derivations of Futura</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Bert, this is not correct. Visually the NYC stuff that was the basis for Gotham is more 19th century (not Art Deco), having the equal width caps. IIRC, think there is little, if any of the early stuff on buildings with a lower case. Paul Shaw, in a tour of NYC lettering I went on, organized by the TDC, explained that there were architect&rsquo;s books with models for lettering on buildings, which were done by sign painters and stone carvers. That&rsquo;s why the similarity of lettering which became the basis of Gotham. But a lot of it pre-dates Futura.</p>
<p>Also Futura really has the wide (square) and narrow (half square) proportions of Trajan caps, so that can&rsquo;t be the model for Gotham caps.</p>
<p>Now looking again at the samples here, you can see that Gotham lower case follows the model more of Futura, as the vertical stems are thicker in comparison. The greater modulation may be why Patty sees Avenir working better in text, but Gotham as having more punch.</p>
<p>Edit. [[http://typography.com/fonts/font_history.php?historyItemID=1&amp;productLineID=100008|Here]] in the essay on the origins of Gotham, Frere-Jones says that there was traditionally no lower case. He says that his models only go back to the 30s. But in any case the even width style of Caps is 19th century, not Futura.</p>

Both families are very stylish and legible; the only problem with Avenir is its perverse refusal to go all the way on weights, whereas Gotham does cover the weight range properly. But if I had to choose just one to buy, it would be Avenir, the single most stylish and legible sans serif on the market.</div>

<p>Gill almost never worked in any kind of mechanistic idiom. Gotham overtly features mechanistic, industrial features. H+F-J acknowledge the &ldquo;Mathematical reasoning of the draftsman&rdquo; in their exclusively American models, rather than the sensibility of a calligrapher and stonecarver (which Gill was first and foremost). Gill&rsquo;s lettering has always held a very specifically British style, a tradition he learned from stonecarvers and calligraphers in the UK. His background and output were very regional, and continue to be very recognizable. Not sure how you can make a very clear connection between Gill and Gotham. I think you may have stumbled on the only commonality: The M.</p>
<p>One thing to point out about Avenir: Adrian Frutiger has a very recognizable tendency to draw a wide, flat-footed, cap A with a low crossbar. In all his sans and most of his serif designs this wide shape appears. Along with his also typical wide a, it can push Avenir stylistically away from the highly proportional style of Futura (its predecessor) towards more of the wide, square style of Gotham (and Proxima, and Slate, somewhat).</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I have to agree with Jan on that one: when Gotham is placed next to Avenir, in caps, it looks slightly better (the repartition of weights, the standard wider spacing which makes it look more classy, the little adjustments here and there&hellip;) - but i&rsquo;m wondering if it will still look better in, say, 5 or 8 years from now. Wide, sleek sans serifs are very much in these days fashion, especially in thin or light caps, it&rsquo;s a trend we tend to see everywhere (Gotham, Avenir, Verlag, Proxima Nova, to name but a few), and I have the feeling that Gotham, if not launched the trend, surely helped spreading it, but&hellip; is this gonna pass? I mean, look at Avenir, the design goes all the way back to 1988, and it was not widely used until recently. And when Linotype decided to redesign it, one thing they did was to add a light alternative to the package&hellip;</p>

		<div class="commentbody">David, take a look at extended text settings of Gotham and Avenir and I think you&rsquo;ll appreciate the differences in their lowercase letters. While superficially the same, Gotham&rsquo;s large x-height (verging on the Hrant-ian &ldquo;obese&rdquo;) really reduces its effectiveness in long copy. And this is coming from someone who prefers Gotham overall.</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I don&rsquo;t think H&amp;FJ should be singled out and criticized for what is a widespread practice, certainly not if they&rsquo;re following in Adrian Frutiger&rsquo;s footsteps!</p>
<p>A &ldquo;subtle distinction&rdquo;: Gotham&rsquo;s lower case, mining a well-worked vein from the 1920s (consider it public domain), is nowhere near an issue for a sleazy industry where blatant design plagiarism is widely condoned&ndash;and has been for centuries with little ethical progress&ndash; where the producer of a revival is called its designer, and where only the novice appropriator gets called to task&ndash;more for callow ineptitude than bad intent. If you&rsquo;re a big corporation or have something of a reputation, then your professional nuancing of other people&rsquo;s work, or stuff you developed that ended up looking a bit like someone else&rsquo;s work, won&rsquo;t raise much of an eyebrow.</p>
<p>The sameness is fostered by what the market asks for, which is retro, retro, and more of the same.
And typophiles who harp about how glyphs that &ldquo;draw attention to themselves&rdquo; will compromise readability.
And typophiles who like nothing better than to discuss good old Garamond and Helvetica, rather than anything, God forbid, designed in recent memory. (This thread an exception.)</p>
<p>**</p>
<p>Clients often give me the opportunity to be unethical.
That&rsquo;s not the same as asking me to do unethical things, of course.</p>
<p>Presently I&rsquo;m working on a commission for an agency that wants a unicase version of a well-known typeface for its client. The art director hasn&rsquo;t commissioned this kind of work before, and more power to him, but he needs advice on the legal technicalities, which is what I&rsquo;m here for, among other things. So I said he could check out the EULA, contact the foundry, and see if they could do the job, and that I could do it too &ndash; except that I would adapt one of my fonts to be &ldquo;similar to&rdquo;, because point piracy and a verbatim copy is illegal. But there wouldn&rsquo;t be a problem, as it&rsquo;s a pretty generic typeface anyway.</p>
<p>Of course, I would have preferred if the agency had contacted me upfront before they pitched their client, and said &ldquo;Nick, we need a unicase a bit like so-and-so&rdquo;, which would have given me more design space, but that would have invested too much in what was, no doubt, one of several different creative approaches they were presenting.</p>
<p>**</p>
<p>Even those foundries and publishers which produce a lot of new designs also publish some work that is straight-up derivative.</p>
<p>As well as criticize conservatism and plagiarism, it&rsquo;s good to big up the interesting new work &ndash; so props to Stephen Coles and his ongoing &ldquo;top new fonts&rdquo; projects at FontShop.com and Typographica.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Well, after a few days of chatting and arguing, it seems that the answer is not as clear as it sounds and the opinions are different. I wish I could have a word about this with Tobias Frere-Jones and Adrian Frutiger, maybe they would have the final word about this discussion.</p>
<p>As of myself, I think H&amp;FJ arrived to a fairly similar typeface using quite different ways, especially with the capitals, but I wouldn&rsquo;t think the same way about the lower case letters, they really share way too many characteristics. Anyway, both typefaces are brilliant and have enough singular characteristics not to be called &ldquo;rip-offs&rdquo; or something. I like them both, i&rsquo;d use them both. And I will write two separate articles about them in my upcoming book.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I see Futura, Avenir and Gotham as being something of a continuum of geometric sans design. The middle of that continuum (Avenir) is the sweet spot for being unobtrusive and the best of the three for text. Futura is more geometric and sterile-feeling, while Gotham is more humanistic but also more quirky.</p>
<p>In the same vein, Futura has lengthy ascenders/descenders while Gotham has really short ones.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Hi. New of the forum here.
Interesting discussion on this topic.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m in need of an info, though, that someone here might be able to answer very easily: I&rsquo;m looking for a character which looks almost exactly the same as Futura, as far a I can see by careful eye examination, but with a straightened capital M (very similar to the Avenir capital M). Capital T has as narrow orizontal bar as Futura, maybe even a tad more, and lower case a is round as it is in Futura (while in Avenir it presents the curly shape on top).
I&rsquo;ve been looking for it through all my collection but I cannot seem to find the right one.</p>
<p>Thanks in advance for any help provided.</p>

<p>It sounds to me that what you&rsquo;re looking for could be &ldquo;Avant Garde&rdquo; (<a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/itc/avant-garde-gothic/)">http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/itc/avant-garde-gothic/)</a>.</p>
<p>If necessary, use the &ldquo;sample text&rdquo; to look at the regular &ldquo;M&rdquo;, &ldquo;T&rdquo;, and &ldquo;a&rdquo;, not the stylistic alternates. (Avant Garde has a lot of those, with a slanted &ldquo;M&rdquo; alternative, for instance.)</p>
<p>In the realm of the non-typographically obsessed, Futura and Avant Garde get confused a lot.</p>
