		<div class="commentbody">Years ago, I worked for a large regional nonprofit theater, and we were about to premiere a new play by David Henry Hwang. A board member, who was very concerned that the company promote the show in a way that was completely respectful to the Asian-American community (she was Chinese-American herself), helped me procure a piece of art that we used for the poster. <BR> <BR>But the board member wasn't done yet, since I still had the show logo to design. She took me aside, made sure I was intently listening to her, and then she spoke these immortal words:  <BR> <BR>&quot;NO CHOP SUEY LETTERING!&quot; <BR> <BR>She didn't mention anything about Skia, however. But just to be on the safe side, I wouldn't use that either. <BR> <BR>More seriously: obviously, her intent was to make sure that I, as a white person, wouldn't inadvertently do something that was disrespectful. You, as an Asian or Asian-American, may feel differently than she did about such typefaces. For the record, however, I <i>never</i> even considered using one of them. They should only be used in kitschy contexts, and even so, probably not. <a href="http://www.blackapolis.com/news/images/abercrombie.jpg">Abercrombie</a>, anyone?</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Immerse yourself in your vision of Jade Design. Even if it's a fake company, create a little creative brief for yourself about the company and determine what you'd want the brand to say.  <BR>  <BR>Remember that you're not just creating a look for somebody, you're creating a brand that stands for what the company is about. Also, ask yourself if the fonts you've selected and the look you've created really addresses all these things you're tying to accomplish.  <BR>  <BR>Think about it this way, if you opened up the phone book and saw the Jade Design logo, would you hire them to design anything for you?  <BR>  <BR>If your answer is no, than you haven't fulfilled the purpose of a logo. In a consumer forum, a logo is to extend the brand visually and connect with the audience who would be inclined to use the product or service you're pitching to them.  <BR>  <BR>Good Luck and please post updated versions of the logo for us!  <BR>  <BR>Stuart :D</div>

		<div class="commentbody">OK, now I feel bad for being so flippant earlier. I agree with Stuart and HD's comments. <BR> <BR>So, to be a bit more constructive with my own opinions: as I noted elsewhere in this forum today, I think the best logos are entirely unique to the companies or individuals they represent. The difficulty you have with a company called &quot;Jade Design&quot; is that you have a few readily available directions you can go in, but many, many other people have gone those directions before, to the point where they have become cliches. <BR> <BR>You have a couple of options: <BR> <BR>1. Avoid the cliches altogether. Maybe your client (or you, if you're the client) picked the word Jade for an unusual reason. Dig into that inspiration for a compelling image. <BR> <BR>2. Explode one or more of the cliches, meaning that you knowingly subvert the cliche. I think Abercrombie thought they were doing that, but instead they played right into it. Here's more successful idea that breaks a different cliche: <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/30/7219.gif" alt="canada bread"> <BR> <BR>Here the Canadian maple leaf, a way-overdone image, is merely referenced in the happy coincidence that the company's initials could be used to sketch it. It also takes on a sort of wheat imagery as well. I'm not crazy about other aspects of this logo, but I think the approach was creative.</div>

I have recently seen the logo for the Olmpiade in Duesseldorf 2006, which consists of stripes of various colours in different widths. It wouldn not really work all that well in b/w (although I figure you could find a way, if you'd have to) but it depends strongly on the various colours and their graphic impact.  <BR>Generally, though, yes, one should consider that a logo also has to work in 1-bit :-D.  <BR></div>

An actual logo will eventually get silkscreened on pens and pencils, put on coffee mugs, copied and faxed, stitched on hats, printed in miniscule sizes on crummy paper in directories, embossed on tradeshow givaways.

		<div class="commentbody">It's a rule. It doesn't only happen to me. Maybe this is because many clients opt for the most tame, most superficial solution while you as the pro would have preferred the more radical or more pure or more stylized or more neosimplicistic version or whatever, the thing closer to your heart. When I go to a pitch that DEMANDS three designs, I mostly have my heart set on one of those three&hellip; mostly the quite different, daring, difficult approach. Many clients prefer the simple tun-of-the-mill , however. So whenever I can I opt to NOT give them a choice. After all, our job is to come up with a solution. Giving the client a choice is just shifting the difficulty of decisionmaking to him. I like to get loads of feedbacjk from the client, my briefing talks and eMails are long and go rather deep. When doing CD I speak to dozens of people from various positions in a company. And in the end I don't wanna see the thought and input of many people that culminates in a specific idea and look&amp;feel go down just because a CEO has a bad day or is suddenly afraid of change.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I'd like to talk about 3 things in this discussion: <BR>1. Cliches: I read once about a designer who said that in working on a logo, he first sat down and did all the cliche ideas to get them out of the way. THEN he started working on his client's logo. I've always found that advice helpful in my own work. It takes a look at where we've been with certain ideas (an historical perspective perhaps?) and allows you to take a fresh look at them and at your client. <BR>2. How many options to present: I have presented a client with as many as eight different options in order to get them thinking strategically and answering questions like what is my business strategy? what is my marketing strategy? who am I? what do I do? how do I do it? It's surprising how often clients don't relate those answers to an identity design. <BR>3. Logos should work in b&amp;w first: This was a basic rule when I went to art college too. Now (hopefully wiser ;-) I think that it relates not so much to application (variation in size and media) as to perception - it is a valuable way to make sure to get the overall shapes right. These are perceived first by the viewer and we often lose sight of that while working on it.</div>

We tried something along those lines (retro 50s and such stuff), but it always felt wrong, as a pistol for a crime book publisher is like an owl or a book for a book shop, or a pair of glasses for an optician, it's just too flat, even if you stylize it&hellip; it's just a one-dimensional, all too simple idea. What we came up with is a completely remodelled flammable-sign I once photographed from a NY gas tank. We completely redesigned the flame, and on the stationery and business cards it was to be foil stamped, and we felt that the danger/hot association was still quite close to the topic at hand, worked very well as a stand-alone sign (without the companies name) and it was nice to use a more or less simple everyday iso-sign in a completely different context and make it work instead of working with an obvious clich</div>

Take the new France Telecom logo. The use of the colour orange refers to the British company 'Orange' which is now a part of the FT group. Using a different colour for the letters 'com' also highlights their new internet services.

		<div class="commentbody">I think majuscle and minuscle letters are to be played with. For example, we had the stationery done in an all-lc typo in FFInfo for some time and then switched to FFDin in all-UC, just for the heck of it and because the Uppercase adds to the strangely ironic aspect of the oh-so-authorative DIN-Typeface.  <BR> <BR>I think in a logo you can work without or only with capitals, depending on the actual look of the letters in the logo and on the comapny you work for. If carefully done, it can work pretty well, as a slight break with what we expect to read can make a logo stand out more.  <BR> <BR>For a logogramm for a company like france telecom, however, this design all in all just tries too hard to look modern and dotcomish. I dunno how old it is, but it already looks a bit old because of it trying to look so modern. Less would have been more, here.</div>
