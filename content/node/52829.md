body: '. . . I wanted to wish all of you a very Merry Christmas and Hanukkah and Kwanzaa
  and (or _insert appropriate holiday_) Happy New Year. (I can''t believe another
  year has blown past so quickly!) We all might not share the same traditions, but
  this time of year represents a special renewal of spirit for all of us, I think.
  We can agree that it is good to share of ourselves and allow all positivity to thrive
  within us. I wish for all of you to feel of that spirit. '

    lurker here, I'm constantly impressed and amazed by how positive and well-behaved,
    on the whole, the Typophile community really is.
