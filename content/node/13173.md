body: I was looking at a sample of Adobe Garamond Premier Pro and drooling a little
  when I began to wonder, as I have about faces like Minion Pro, whether the Pro fonts
  are a team effort? I find it hard to imagine one person sitting and drawing a the
  complete character set not just once for each weight but then adjusting each weight
  to achieve the finely balanced "optical" fonts. I suppose they could be using multiple
  master technology to do some of the work, but no matter how much they automate there
  is far too much for one person to do by hand. Or is there? And if I'm right, who
  are these people and what other team efforts exist, and if I'm wrong, what team
  efforts exist?

    Asian font is almost certainly a team effort, simply on account of the size of
    the glyph set.\r\n\r\nI've collaborated with other designers on Thai typeface
    design, and of the non-design aspects of complex script font production are often
    team work."

  body: "Many production tasks are often done by individuals other than the designer.
    Hinting is very often done by others. Some large type family have even been kerned
    by others.\r\n\r\nOpenType feature programming is on other step which is often
    done by someone else.\r\n\r\nOf course, there are many designers who do all of
    these things on their own as well. It depends on the designer, if he works for
    someone, and who commissioned the fonts (if the fonts were commissioned in the
    first place). \r\n\r\n__\r\nwww.typeoff.de"

    premier pro\"</a>. Try the first result. It doesn't <em>look</em> like any other
    Garamond I've seen, so I assume it is a legit sample, though I haven't investigated
    the site that hosts it so I don't know for certain.\r\n<strong>edit</strong>\r\nHmmm,
    just took a look at the site hosting the file, and read the actual content of
    the file instead of looking at the pretty characters. This person is a bit of
    a looney, still, the sample seems real enough."

  body: "By the way, does anyone of you know about a Garamond Premier Pro release
    date? Or is it out already (I don't think so)? There's nothing on Adobe's site.\r\n\r\nJudging
    from the character set alone this typeface is a masterpiece! I'm seriously excited
    about it, lots of weights and optical sizes and a <strong>huge</strong> character
    palette (eg Greek small caps) Unfortunately, it may not be affordable for ordinary
    people."

  body: "I did a whole lot of font \"editing\" with the submissions I processed at
    T26, from constructing missing glyphs to overhauling or hand-tuning metrics.  Many
    of the releases after 2001 were collaborative to some extent, whether I applied
    a hands-on effort or verbal feedback for improvements.  Some designs were submitted
    as single weights which were then fleshed out into usable families through a collaborative
    process.  Some submissions were a team-effort before they came in, but the majority
    were solo endeavors.\r\n\r\nFont Bureau puts some team effort into their releases,
    from what they express in their submission/publishing terms.  http://fontbureau.com/submissions/"
