body: "I've been trying to make a perfect dotted line in [[Adobe Illustrator|Illustrator]],
  but nothing seems to work...\r\nI've made my own dotted brush, but it keeps deforming
  in corners... I've tried using a dashed line with round corners & short dashes,
  but the dots are not perfect circles... At the end I just used the line as a textpath,
  typed bullets & shifted the baseline negatively to center the bullets on the line.\r\nI've
  searched the internet on tutorials, but they only ever seem to be about expanding
  dashed lines (flatten transparency; for those interested). I refuse to believe Adobe
  still hasn't included some way to create a dotted line with perfect circles & an
  even spacing inbetween them.\r\nCan anyone help?"

    seems to be overcomplex or maybe what you and I are trying is too basic; the stroke
    method will produce circles as long as it isn't expanded using zero as the dash
    length, but it really seems too long a method to accurately produce a simple shape,
    when the text path trick works quicker and easier.\r\nTim"

  body: "I did make a pattern brush with circles, 100% spacing & checked the box \"add
    space to fit\" so it wouldn't deform the circles. It works well for straight lines,
    but in sharp corners it turns the circles into rounded triangles. I think the
    best solution is indeed either using the dashed line with round corners or using
    your line as a textpath & fill it with bullets.\r\nIt seems strange though that
    Adobe never picked up on this problem & I can't imagine I'm the only person who
    wants to make a dotted line in Illustrator. Then again, it amazes me just as much
    that you need to flatten transparancy to expand a dotted line (which doesn't seem
    to have anything to do with it).\r\nMaybe the best thing to do would be to adress
    this problem to Adobe & hope for the best when Illustrator CS3 comes out ;-)"

  body: It is actually quite simple to do this in Illustrator. Set your dash to zero,
    your ends to rounded and set your gap to the amount of space betwen each circle.
    You will always get perfect circles on your stroke, no matter how large your stroke
    is. All you have to do is adjust your gap. Have fun!

  body: "What drives me crazy are two things - one is that the spacing between the
    dots is kind of all over the place if you're making a shape with corners, such
    as a square. Quark on the other hand will always put a dot in each corner, although
    in Quark you can't adjust the spacing between the dots, only the thickness.\r\n\r\nMy
    other peeve is that if you go to \"outline stroke\" you get a solid rather than
    the dotted rule.\r\n\r\nI've resorted to both the bullet method (and then doing
    \"create outlines\" for the type) and also making a tiny circle, step and repeating
    it, and then redistributing the spacing using \"Align\"."

      that there seems to be no option to automatically have a dot (or corner dash)

      but it would be a useful option where precise dot or dash spacing is less important

    said...Set your dash to 0 and your gap to any desired number...If it doesnt work
    perfeclty then try setting the meter to the same number as your stroke weight...from
    there you can just increase or decrease stroke weight to make the perfect circle

  body: "I've been using Filip's method and it works great! However, I found that
    the circles/dots can become distorted if they are on an irregular path. This doesn't
    matter if your dots are only going to be a couple points wide, but it will matter
    if you want large dots.\r\n\r\nYou can fix this by creating the original dot with
    a Stroke INSTEAD of a Fill. Things to remember:\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>Make sure that
    the stroke fills the inside of the circle</li>\r\n<li>The Stroke options MUST
    be set to \"Round Join\" and \"Round Cap\" (these are in the Stroke Palette\")[img:sites/default/files/old-images/stroke_5381.jpg]</li>\r\n<li>The
    wider the stroke is in comparison to the width of the circle, the less possibility
    there is for distortion. A 1pt circle with a 25pt should be more than sufficient
    to keep the dots circular. If you want to be more certain that they stay circular,
    just raise the stroke width.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\nEnjoy!"

    have set for weight, line caps, and joins, you can create a stitched line, a skip
    line, or almost anything. You control the dash and gap (the space between each
    dash) by entering numbers into the Dash and Gap fields at the bottom of the stroke
    palette.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/stroke_5382_3467.jpg]\r\n\r\n\r\nIf
