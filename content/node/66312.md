body: "Hi,\r\n\r\nI ran into a problem today. Currently working on my first font in
  FontLab, I wondered if there is a method to add for instance all ISO-Latin-3 glyphs
  (just the empty glyph cells) to a font without generating hundreds of glyphs one
  by one. I searched the manual but found nothing. Fontlab.com FAQ reffers to a page
  taken down in 2008 for this problem.\r\n\r\nSorry for asking such a basic question.
  I hope someone can help me with this. :)\r\n\r\n\r\nThank you in advance.\r\n\r\nPS:
  I hope I put this into the right section of the forum. If not sorry for that."

  body: In the font window, click the codepages icon (on the right of the toolbar),
    then select Latin 3 from the drop down menu.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Latin3_5570.jpg].
    The glyph cells will then show Latin 3 glyphs. If you select all of these and
    generate all you should have what you need.
