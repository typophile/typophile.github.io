body: "Heya!\r\n\r\nA bit of an odd question, but what is the correct terminology
  for the exceptions in a typeface that contains no serifs at all, except for the
  problematic ones: <code>i,l,I,</code> and <code>1</code>.\r\n\r\nThis kind of typeface
  is normally found in screen-space areas (non-print). Most known example for this
  would be the Verdana family.\r\nThis would mean that Verdana is not a pure grotesque
  font, but neither is it a full grown serif font as well. What is this \"kind\" of
  typeface called? Are there special terms that these odd-ones-out are called?"

  body: If the only serifs are to distinguish the "lI1|" group, I'd still call it
    sans-serif. I've seen some faces referred to as "semi-serif" but never found a
    definition I thought adequate for that term.
