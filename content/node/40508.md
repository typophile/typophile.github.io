body: "Can anyone help me figure out how this graphic style is achieved?\r\n\r\nI've
  seen this used before a number of times, and I find it hard to believe that it's
  done by hand - it seems that would take forever. I imagine there's some sort of
  Illustrator plugin that automates the process and allows the user to control how
  the forms are filled. You'll notice that the 'fill shapes' are never sliced, but
  rather resized to accurately define the boundaries of the outer form.\r\n\r\nAny
  ideas? Suggestions?\r\n\r\nThanks so much,\r\nJim\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/C5-128-01_5732.jpg]"

    a pretty versatile Illustrator plug-in.

    isn''t the result of a filter or tool. The work of [[Marian Bantjes]] and [[Si

  body: I agree that the splatters/stray elements were probably done by hand, but
    what about the base fill of the numbers? It seems to be very consistent, and I
    imagine that there would be some way to script a fill like that??

  body: They were simply very careful with the size and placement of the circles.
    Through Gestalt our eyes are following the shape and that is how it appears to
    be so perfect.

    actually contain any hidden letters or numerals. (Don't laugh; it was one of those
    \"loose lips sink ships\"-type military operation security posters, and it was
    no work of genius.)\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/poster01_3610.gif]\r\n\r\nI
    also looked for ways to automate this, but in the end, it was all done by hand.
    This involved making hundreds of copies of circles of various sizes and similar
    hues and positioning each by hand. I think it took me no more than an hour."
