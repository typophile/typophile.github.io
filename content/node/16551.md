    they made the logo.\r\n\r\nI find their site so user-unfriendly, I wish they had
    regular font showings rather than random characters."

  body: "I agree, it is (or strongly based on) Bloc.\r\nI see a version by Para Type
    available from <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=catalog.fontdetail&displayfontid=PG.107306.0.3&attributes.sampleSize=60&sampleText=batiself&sampleSize=74\"
    target=\"new\">FontShop.com</a>, but the lowercase \"s\" is slightly different,
    or maybe they outlined the face to fatten it."
