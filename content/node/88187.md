body: "First of all, I'd like to apologize, since this topic has been maybe discussed
  over and over again :-)\r\n\r\nHowever my choice of fonts is limited, since my thesis
  contains lots of math - thus there is no other choice than Latex.\r\n\r\nI do not
  like the Computer-Modern fonts very much. Printed, they look acceptable, and their
  choice is maybe of personal taste. But for on-screen reading, CM is just not dark
  and heavy enough. Since most readers - if someone ever looks at it at all, except
  of course the thesis committee :-) - will probably download and read the pdf on-screen.
  Thus CM is an option, but my least-preferred one.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, alternatives
  are few. While using different fonts is not so much of a problem in Latex, fitting
  math-fonts are few. \r\nThe options I have seem to be either\r\n1.) New Century
  Schoolbook plus the Millennial Font-package for math\r\n2.) Palatino and the Mathpazo
  Font-package for math\r\n3.) just stick with Computer Modern.\r\n\r\nWhat would
  you choose? Is it acceptable to use NCS in a thesis? So far, I like option 1) most,
  but..."

  body: Minion definitely has a Latex math package. I think Utopia, and therefore
    the spin-off [[http://code.google.com/p/evristika/|Heuristica]] has a math set
    for Latex too.

  body: Have a look the CTAN <a href="http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/info/Free_Math_Font_Survey/"><strong>Free
    Math Font Survey</strong></a>. I personally use Utopia with the fourier math package,
    simply calling <code>\usepackage{fourier}</code>.  If you want something that
    looks more professional, without using XeLaTeX or installing otf fonts for LaTeX,
    you can buy <a href="https://store1.adobe.com/cfusion/store/html/index.cfm?store=OLS-US&event=displayFontPackage&code=105"><strong>Utopia
    Expert</strong></a> and call <code>\usepackage[expert]{fourier}</code> (all you
    need to do is to add the .pfb files where needed, all the rest is already installed).
    I have not tried that option, I have installed Utopia Standard instead,

  body: "Can you post a typical page of your thesis, compiled with the different options
    that you're considering?  Certain features of the content may make one choice
    better than another.  For instance, one of my students is currently writing his
    thesis and is using Palatino through mathpazo.  In certain sections, there are
    a lot of subscripted <em>i</em>s and <em>j</em>s, and I find these hard to disinguish
    since Palatino has very little curl in the <em>j</em>.\r\n\r\nIt is also true
    that Palatino is a lighter font, and New Century Schoolbook is heavier.  Requirements
    on margins and point size may also work better with one choice or the other.  Because
    NCS is so dark, I often find pages set to the full width in 12+ pt sizes to be
    too much.\r\n\r\nBest wishes, Stephen\r\n"

  body: "I wrote my thesis before TeX even existed.  I often use fourier to reformat
    papers on the arXiv before reading them on screen. My formats are thus far from
    those of a thesis. You can have a look at http://www.iro.umontreal.ca/%7Eboyer/griggs/\r\n\r\nAdded:
    Above I used \\usepackage[upright]{fourier} to get upright capitals and greek
    letters in equations. After that I called a second package to use the Utopia Std
    font I had installed."

  body: "Concerning indexed indices, I tend to avoid them because there is no appropriate
    \"opticals\" for small sizes. Also, the fourier package has very few options.
    If you don't have the expert fonts, I would say there is no option (the \"upright\"
    option being used for French math). Here is the ams testmath.tex file compiled
    with fourier, no frills added. \r\n\r\nhttp://www.iro.umontreal.ca/~boyer/typophile/testmath.pdf\r\n\r\nYou
    will see that <code>\\mathcal</code> looks like the <code>\\mathscr</code> of
    the <code>mathrsfs</code> package. If you want the cal font you are used to, you
    need to declare it yourself  (I call it <code>\\mathcalus</code>).\r\n\r\n"

    come with [[http://www.tug.org/mactex/2011/|<strong>MacTeX 2011</strong>]] too.
    So does the fourier package. There is no need to fetch.

  body: "In the end, I decided to go with Palatino/mathpazo. Thanks at sgh for pointing
    out that indeed NCS is very heavy. My guidelines require a 12pt font, and after
    looking at some pages, I decided it is just not acceptable. I still think it might
    be a good choice for e.g. a thesis in liberal arts.\r\nSmall indices are not really
    an issue. My thesis is more CS than math-related, and there are few pure calculations.
    Rather lot's of relational and set notation.\r\n\r\nIn fact this is also why I
    decided not to go with Utopia and fourier or mathdesign, or with Times and mathpmx
    or txfonts. I know that several famous journals in my field go with a times-look.
    But calligraphic math-symbols, such as \\mathcal{R} which I make heavy use of,
    just stand out way too much.\r\n\r\nThanks very much for your feedback everyone,
    especially pointing me towards the Math Font Survey.\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    stand out way too much.</cite>\r\n\r\nThose symbols come from separate fonts and
    can be changed by calling other packages. For instance (with MacTeX 2011 and I
    presume texlive 2011), there are at least two packages that do just that. You
    can use <code>\\usepackage{eucal}</code> or <code>\\usepackage[scaled=0.95]{esstixcal}</code>
    (with the scale you want). With Fourier, I sometimes just add the two lines (after
    calling fourier)\r\n<code>\r\n\\DeclareSymbolFont{cmsy}{OMS}{cmsy}{m}{n}\r\n\\DeclareSymbolFontAlphabet{\\mathcal}{cmsy}\r\n</code>
    \r\nwhich give the cal font you get by default with mathpazo. The blackboard and
    the frak fonts can also be changed with the packages <code>esstixbb</code> and\t<code>esstixfrak</code>.
    I like inconsolata as the mono font (<code>\\usepackage[scaled=0.95]{inconsolata}</code>).\r\n\r\n\r\n"
