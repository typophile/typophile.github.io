  1992, and I could swear I saw Industria, a font by Neville Brody in a newspaper
  headline.\r\n\r\nI had to go and check, and indeed Brody released Industria in 1989,
  so it might in fact have been used in the film.\r\n\r\nIf I was asked, that's just
  bad judgement from the art director; I've seen my Denim font used in a Harry Potter
  movie, but that font was specifically designed to mimic metal type on uneven paper,
  so in that sense it's appropriate, but Brody's fonts were the harbingers (or the
  very first ones) of new type design movement of the 1990's, so choosing Industria
  is just wrong.\r\n\r\nBut then again, it could be I saw something else\u2026"
