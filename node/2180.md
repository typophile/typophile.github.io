  body: I&#39;m not sure it&#39;s the kerning that makes it awkward still.  The U
    seems like such a departure from the character of the other letters.  It&#39;s
    making he space inside the U sort of swell the area it is taking up.  It&#39;s
    such an oddball I want to read it as an icon rather than a letterform, but no
    visual references come to mind. <BR> <BR>Is the U saying something different than
    the other letters?  If not, i&#39;d go ahead and straighten the sides...or bring
    some of the characteristics of the U you have into the D maybe &#40;might set
    up some nice rhythm&#41;. <BR> <BR>What&#39;s the connection you&#39;re working
    at between the logo you have and the nightclub?  Just wondering <BR> <BR>-JT

  body: 'Stephen, <BR>I was aiming to keep the horizontals as flat as possible.  The
    only curves are on the vertical part of the letterforms.   <BR> <BR>Randy, <BR>It
    is center.  What do you think, should the top whitespace of the s be like 60%
    and the bottom whitespace of the s be like %40?  Or is more of a 55/45 ratio?
    <BR> <BR>JT, <BR>I styled the S after the U and thought I had the D close enough
    to make it relavent to the other letters, but perhaps the D should not flatten
    out like it is....I will look into what you are suggesting. <BR> <BR>The U is
    styled after a glass, a thick bottem tumblers glass that the club will incoorporate
    into it&#39;s glassware.  The U will also be used as part of an icon set.  But
    the U will have an olive or a straw or some icecubes in it. <BR> <BR>I had the
    same feeling about the counterform of the U as well, but I think if I straighten
    up those curves this logotype will loose much of it&#39;s character. <BR> <BR>Thanks

  body: Hrant. Deja vu. That&#39;s what I said in the beginning. <BR> <BR>I understand
    your goal for the straight horizontals, Peter.  <BR>But in typography, it always
    helps to be consistent with <BR>your forms, this includes the ends of strokes,
    and in a <BR>monolinear, non-calligraphic design like this one, those <BR>terminals
    should be consistent, regardless of which  <BR>direction they are pointing. Otherwise
    glyphs will stand out, <BR>and if that&#39;s not your intention you end up with
    a &#39;U&#39; that <BR>distracts rather than contributes to the overall form.
