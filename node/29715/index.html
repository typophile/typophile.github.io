		<div class="commentbody">In general I think the curves are disagreeing with the straight lines here. It&rsquo;s especially evident in o, g, and f. For example, with the o, you have a standard sort of curve on the outside and the inside has the only corners. Both curves, inside and out, should have a <cite>blend</cite> (where appropriate) of curvy and linear. The m has really achieved this well. The one side of the line harmonizes really well with the other side. It also looks like you&rsquo;ve taken a bit too modular an approach, using the same template for similar letters. I think this design just screams for a bit of variety. Go ahead: make the inside of the o and the dot of the i a little asymmetrical! put one more corner on one bowl of the s than on the other! (These are just suggestions. You can do whatever things you feel like.) Use your imagination to jazz it up a bit. Oh, and when you do that work on the g, make sure you get rid of that awful ear. I&rsquo;m thinking Electra.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Also, I think I should mention that perfect circles are to be eschewed in &ldquo;serious&rdquo; (i.e. text) typography, because they inherently lack a quality I call chirality, which is a reflection of the way an actual hand draws a letter. It&rsquo;s more than a diagonal distribution of slope like on your o&ndash;you can&rsquo;t get it by simply rotating the counter, but rather you have to make the slope shallower on the NW and SE parts of the o, and more square on the NE and SW. For an example&ndash;and forgive me if this makes me look arrogant, but I can&rsquo;t think right now of another font that illustrates it so clearly&ndash;look at my <a href=http://typophile.com/salamander>Newt</a> (That&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;ve decided to call it now). Carry that from your o to other letters too: g, the pbdq quartet, c, e, and most of everything else. Shaping of the round is one of the most important things that defines the character of a font. A text face without it looks like it has backslant, and it also has zero character to it. (This is one reason Times looks so bland.) You obviously don&rsquo;t have to do it to the extreme that I did in Newt. That&rsquo;s just an illustration of what chirality is. I also want to stress that you shouldn&rsquo;t in your fracturing of the curves create little globs of stress, like in your o and f: there should only be the standard text face amount of thicks and thins, and your o for example has two extra vestigial thicks at the bottom and top. A fractured curve will obviously always result in a deviation of stress from the normal, but make it flow. Your m and n have that going to them: starting at the stem, the stroke gradually gets wider, for the most part not shrinking back to any thinner widths, crescendoing until it gets to maximum at the next vertical, and then it holds steady. On the glob-plagued letters, you&rsquo;re using chords that are perpendicular to the radius of your curves. Sloping it would help reduce the globs. Fracturing the curve more times would also help on some letters. Enclosed are some illustrative figures I made with MS Paint to help decipher my esoteric advice.<img src="/images/old-images/allpurposetemp_4097.PNG" alt=""></div>

A quick screenshot of the o from Patria reveals that your natural human tendencies have gotten the better of your rationalistic approaches, and given the letter a <cite>little</cite>&ndash;not much, but a <cite>little</cite>&ndash;chirality, combined with squaring of the round. But that&rsquo;s beside the point. My point is that very many successful fonts tend to have it, and, since of course correlation isn&rsquo;t causation, that I think this font could use it too. Some fonts (<a href=http://image.linotype.com/samples/hirespdf/12775.pdf>Caledonia</a>, for instance) don&rsquo;t have it. These fonts generally use squaring of the round instead, which (I&rsquo;m getting back on the topic of helping Moiz here) is where you make all four corners more toward the square, not only NE and SW. You can find a balance between chirality and squaring, using them both in conjunction. Personally, I think this font would do well with a little of both. Squaring is another essential design idea to know&ndash;not required for every font, any more than serifs are&ndash;but still essential to know and probably to be proficient with. Hrant is well-read, and will now tear into my comment using words such as &ldquo;parafoveal&rdquo; and &ldquo;bouma&rdquo;, but I base my learnings off of what I see in established designs and what I instinctively think looks better, so that&rsquo;s my angle.
P.S. I started writing this before Hrant responded to my other comment, which is why I don&rsquo;t refer to his.</p>

<p>There is a trend now to add sharp cuts in counters, and it came from somewhere, and there was a reason for it, but I don&rsquo;t think the reason generally exists now, and the reasoning isn&rsquo;t being observed anyway, so I&rsquo;m not a big fan of the sharp cuts unless they actually do something ( = have a functional purpose). Why are they there? &ldquo;I just like them&rdquo; is not the correct answer.  ; )</p>
<p>To discover more about what would be useful about sharp cuts, try making a typeface out of nothing but straight lines. That would push you to discover methods to make straight lines look like curves, and where to put the corners that would be less visually disruptive, which is more useful to know than &ldquo;I could break some curves&rdquo;.</p>
<p>A hint about how easy this challenge could be: Blackletter.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Hrant made Patria, which is why I used it in my comment responding to him. He also created the word &ldquo;bouma&rdquo;, so it&rsquo;s not in Dictionary.com. It just means &ldquo;word shape&rdquo;. He uses it to say that letter shapes ought to strengthen the shapes of the words they&rsquo;re used in, rather than just look good on their own. He also uses the (real) word &ldquo;parafoveal&rdquo;, because he&rsquo;s done some research on how we read&ndash;you can read about it on his site. Foveal is the stuff you&rsquo;re focusing on, and parafoveal is the stuff on the outside of that&ndash;the stuff you&rsquo;re seeing, but kind of fuzzily. (It&rsquo;s an adjective, by the way, but I used it like a noun.) Crossgrove has a good idea.</p>
<p>(Jason, is that avatar a picture of you or of Bane from <cite>The Matrix</cite>?)</p>

P.S. For some reason typophile puts their URL before the URLs I linked to. Just get rid of everything before &ldquo;en.wikipedia&rdquo;.</div>

<p>Probably would want to avoid &ldquo;Schist&rdquo;. It might confuse the less geologically inclined.</p>
<p>It would be a great name for a band, though.</p>
