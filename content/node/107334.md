  body: Animals are the part of our society and people like to keep them as pet animal.
    I think that so many animals are there but people knows very few animals. If the
    specimen of every animals would be available in any zoo then people can get the
    information regarding different types of animal. But you have to take the proper
    care of the animals food and health. <a href="http://www.drronsanimalhospitalsimivalley.com/preventative_health_care.html">chatsworth
