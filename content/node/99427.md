  change of weights. I'm interested in the theory and practice behind the design of
  a consistent set of different weights for a given font, unfortunately google has
  not helped me in this regard.\r\n\r\nThanks!"

  body: "Thanks for the links guys! Nonetheless I think I wasn't clear enough in explaining
    what I'm looking for... What I need is the way that bold strokes are extrapolated
    from, let's say, a light variant. Changing the stroke width in Illustrator is
    not enough as I've read, it may give equal widths on every stroke but typefaces
    hardly are so mathematically constructed as I have seen. For example, I took letter
    p from Myriad Regular, ran the Bold action in FL with a parameter of 40-40, and
    compared the outline to Myriad Black... needless to say, they are quite different!
    So, the designer somehow decides how every stroke will relate to the rest, keeping
    harmony between the shapes and the character of the letterform.\r\n\r\nIn this
    same subject, I believe the initial letterforms and interior spaces will dictate
    how much I can \"fatten\" a character. Maybe some of you had already seen my font
    Shket, it has elongated and narrow forms, and some characters like \"f\" have
    small curves. Is technically possible to make a bolder version from that letter?
    If so, How far could I go? Maybe an Extra Black is out of the equation.. but I
    don't know yet.\r\n\r\nThose are the kind of questions I need answers to. I haven't
    found resources or literature dealing with this technically complex stuff.\r\n\r\nRegards!"

    practice, I design the Regular weight \uFB01rst, then <strong>draw</strong> Extra
    Bold by fattening up the Regular with various FontLab tools (some global actions,
    some cut and paste, <strong>whatever it takes</strong>). Then I draw the Thin
    as a stroked monoline (over the Regular in the mask layer). Then I interpolate
    the other weights between these three instances, with a \uFB01nal manual clean
    up. Some people use the Superpolator app for interpolating, rather than Blend
    in FontLab."

    book. Any online resources that you are aware of dealing with the same topic?
    I cannot believe there's only one book dealing with the subject of letterfom modification."

    the Hess book offers a profound analysis, IMHO, and he made all his own glyphs
    to demonstrate his theory."

    one twist I apply to the techniques Nick kindly revealed is to dump (actually,
    use as a reference in the Mask) the original Regular in favor of the eventual
    interpolated one - although I do tweak the extremes to get an interpolated Regular
    as close as possible to the one I originally made. Doing so ensures that things
    are squeaky clean.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: Yes hrant, I understand the techniques revealed by Nick... but no interpolation
    technique will be good if my base forms are no correct. First I need to get technically
    correct bold shapes, and then begin thinking about interpolation! )

    the subject</a>, but sadly the images are gone. This place is falling apart.\r\n\r\nI
    like using a tool called Interpolation Nudge: For the x-direction I lock left
    edges and move right edges (uncheck \u201Cadjust sidebearings\u201D and move everything
    to the left half the distance you added to the stems). The tool interpolates curves
    and points between what you lock and what you move. For the y-direction, I lock
    whatever points I want to keep in place, and move the what I want to move, often
    over several steps. This all ensures that I take as \u201Cmuch\u201D from the
    white as I add to the black. In the end, the bold needs the same level of attention
    to design as the roman, but a method like this can help you see its relationship
    to the roman more clearly and function as a guideline for spacing and proportions."
