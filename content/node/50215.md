  fonts - headline font (Clarendon), bodycopy font (ITC Typewriter) and a tertiary
  font (custom face) used for highlighting. In this case the headline font Clarendon
  is the one for replacement.\r\n\r\nAttached are some headline fonts I'm considering.
  I'd love tips/feedback, thanks.\r\n\r\nLeft: Clarendon, Geometric Slabserif 703
  BT  Extra Bold, Goudy Heavyface\r\nRight: Oxtail Black, Ziggurat Black\r\nAdd'l
  note: Both secondary and tertiary fonts are fixed."

  body: "Since you're going with a slab serif for both the headline and body text,
    I'd recommend using ones with similar letterforms, but with contrasting weights.
    Ziggurat Black has a two storey 'a' and binocular 'g' like American Typewriter.
    It looks the best to me, although it's really up to you.\r\n\r\n - Lex"
