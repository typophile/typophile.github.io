  this look for my own visual identity, so any help naming the fonts seen above is
  appreciated.\r\nalso, i'd love suggestions if you think there's a font that might
  work better for my purposes--thanks!\r\noh: the idea is to create a stamp that inks
  the negative space, all lettering and graphics will show up as the color of the
  bare paper underneath, as in this concept sketch, if i used charcoal ink on light
  gray paper:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/newlamoorestamp_5451.JPG]"
