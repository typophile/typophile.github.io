body: "Hey everyone,\r\n\r\nI originally typeset a role-playing game (yeah, sort of
  like Dungeons and Dragons) 5 years ago that I wish to refresh with a new edition.
  I have considerably more knowledge about the ins and outs of typesetting and am
  pretty sure I can do a better job now. :)\r\n\r\nThe original book used Palatino,
  but I adjusted the width to 92.5%. I really love how Palatino reads, and it has
  a more playful vitality than most Serif alternatives.  However, it's a space hog,
  and this is how I dealt with it.\r\n\r\nI've tried Palatino's text companion, Aldus,
  but it just doesn't read as nicely to me. Is adjusting a font's width a real faux
  pas? Or is a certain amount justifiable, and if so, how much?"

  body: I've personally regarded it as a 'no-no' because I've seen it abused so many
    times. Depending on the application, often I'll adjust the tracking/kerning or
    simply re-size the font to a smaller (yet readable) size to accommodate more text.

  body: Some fonts withstand some squooshing. Most don't. Of course, your audience
    might not even notice it so you *could* get away with it. But then we'd track
    you down and torture you.
