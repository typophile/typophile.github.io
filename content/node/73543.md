body: "Hi all\r\n\r\nI know this has been recently discussed but I'm still really
  stuck and I can't find an answer in any posts - any help would be really appreciated\r\n\r\nHanna
  New is an opentype fonts with 8 weights - Light, Regular, Medium, Bold, Light Italic,
  Italic, Medium Italic and Bold Italic.\r\n\r\nI wanted the fonts too appear under
  one Font name in Opentype savvy apps.\r\n\r\nIn apps like Word (PC) I know this
  is'nt possible and I wanted them to appear as Hanna New Lt and Hanna New Rg and
  with the use of B (Bold) and I (Italic) to get the rest of the weights.\r\n\r\nTo
  name the fonts I used the method described by Adam Twardoch here.\r\n\r\nhttp://forum.fontlab.com/fontlab-studio-tips-and-tricks/font-family-naming-in-fontlab-studio-5-t313.0.html\r\n\r\n\r\nProblem\r\n------------------\r\n\r\nThe
  fonts work fine in OT savvy apps on the Mac, they appear in the correct order and
  work as expected.\r\n\r\nThe problem is Word on the PC - I'm testing in Microsoft
  Office Word 2007, Windows Vista. In Word the fonts appear as Hanna New Lt and Hanna
  New Rg in the menu, the problem I have is that Light and Medium are the same, I
  can't get Medium to work.\r\n\r\nThis problem DOES NOT happen when using Wordpad
  on Windows Vista. Do you know if this a bug in Word or I'm I doing something wrong
  with the naming.\r\n\r\nI have attached images here showing the Naming table and
  Font Info Windows\r\n\r\nwww.ttmt.org.uk/hanna\r\n"

  body: "In <a href=\"http://typophile.com/node/73501\">this thread</a> you wrote,
    that the weight class of your light light style is 300 and the class of the medium
    style is 500, but you cannot style link these classes. Medium must be between
    600 and 950, if it linked to 300.\r\n\r\nBy the way, I dislike it, if Light and
    Medium are style linked. If a typographic family contains more than two weights,
    I only would style link the uprights to the italics, but not the weights."

  body: "Arno\r\n\r\nI had changed the Medium weight class to 600 which has fixed
    the problem. Although it does work I was concerned this was wrong as Fontlab auto
    sets the weight class to 500 for Medium and this page http://www.microsoft.com/typography/otspec/os2.htm#wtc
    states that the Medium should be 500.\r\n\r\nYou say you dislike the Light and
    Medium being style linked, is that a personal preference or is it something that
    will cause me technical problems - the way I did it was following the instructions
    from Adam.\r\n\r\nCould you explain what you mean by \"I only would style link
    the uprights to the italics, but not the weights.\""

  body: If the typographic family contains four styles only, from which one is displayed
    in the font menu of word, there are no doubts, that the displayed style is style
    linked to bold. But if the typographic family contains more weights, the user
    has to think about, which weight is style linked to which weight. You have not
    to expect technical problems, but it is uncomfortable in my opinion. In many fonts
    medium is style linked to regular, but not to light, because the contrast between
    regular and bold would be too big in body text. I prefer, to clearly know, which
    weight I select. I want to be able to pick up the weights from the drop down menu,
    but not with the help of the bold-switcher. There is no duty, that your styling
    group contains exactly four styles (regular, bold, italic and bold italic). Four
    styles are the maximum only. You can build styling groups, that only consist of
    the upright and the italic style of the same weight.
