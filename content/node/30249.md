  page, list typographically significant events for that year. This would be an easy
  way to store all those little historical details that pop up in discussions, eg.
  [[1815]] would include \u201CEgyptian, believed to be the first sans-serif typeface,
  released by William Caslon IV.\u201D Perhaps later some sort of scraper could be
  used to create a timeline site or dump it all out to a book after it's had a few
  years of correcting and filling out. "

      extracurricular activity to list on your resume. No doubt you would certainly
      gain something from doing it. \r\n\r\nI have seen quite a few creation dates/designer
      backgrounds for various fonts on the major type vendors' sites. "
