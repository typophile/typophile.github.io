body: "I have a document that I'm designing which has normal auto page numbering in
  the bottom left corner.\r\n\r\nI also have a section in the middle of the document
  that is going to change order as we edit.\r\nI would like to find a way to have
  something like auto page numbering as well so that if I reorder these pages, they
  get auto-renumbered as well. Almost like having two sets of page numbers. \r\n\r\nHeres
  an example\r\n\r\npg. 1 TOC\r\npg. 2  Content\r\npg. 3  Content\r\npg. 4  1.1\r\npg.
  5  1.2\r\npg. 6  1.3\r\npg. 7  Index\r\n\r\nIn this example, if I swap pages four
  and 5, the auto page numbering in the left is still correct, but now 1.2 comes before
  1.1\r\n\r\nI hope this makes sense and would appreciate any help you can give.\r\n\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\n\r\n-Thomas"

  body: "I was a-lurking, hoping someone else would chime in with a brilliant solution
    and/or a valid reason why it can't work...\r\n\r\nTry these ideas for size (OTOH
    and such disclaimers):\r\n\r\nInDesign can't 'flatten' auto pagination to real
    numbers [*]. So if you use real page numbers, you cannot move pages around keeping
    the same numbers. That's #1. Besides, you mention you already are using those
    'real' numbers.\r\n\r\nHowever, moderately modern versions of CS (you don't mention
    a version number--hint) have <em>auto-numbering lists</em>. Now you <em>can</em>
    convert these to text. On the other hand, it's not necessary if you create linked
    text frames from each page to the next, containing a paragraph with an auto number
    (so each paragraph appears once on each page), you can move the pages around at
    will. The original link connections between the pages will still be there, so
    the original order of the numbering stays the same. That's #2.\r\n\r\nFor hard
    core InDesign questions, feel free to subscribe to [[http://www.adobeforums.com/webx/.3bbf275c/|Adobe's
    InDesign User to User Forums]]. The very best minds--as well as me--that work
    daily with ID hang out there, and occasionally an interesting question may attract
    actual Adobe employees. (Not endorsed by the firm--off the record, so to speak.)\r\n\r\n[*]
    If you feel it'd be a valued addition to the package, put it on [[http://www.adobe.com/cfusion/mmform/index.cfm?name=wishform|Adobe's
    InDesign Wish List]]. Pers'nally, I prefer to stick to the natural order Descartes
    proposed. :-)"

  body: "Maybe I'm missing something here, but I'd just put my auto page numbers in
    in another set of master pages. When done, or just before printing a version,
    \"apply master to pages . . .\"\r\n\r\nI believe you can also \"delete master
    from pages\" if you absolutely have to reorder after applying. If so, just delete,
    reorder, and re-apply."
