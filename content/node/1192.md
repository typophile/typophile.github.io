body: Thats my first attempt on grey pixel fonts. Compare here the two versions, with
  and without greys. I think that grey in such small sizes works great, more legible.  <BR>
  <BR>I am still experiment with greys on fog, waiting to test Flashfonter now. Your
  comments are wellcome. <BR> <BR>mh. <BR> <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/15624.gif"

  body: Nice work Miguel. Make sure to check white on black as well - there&#39;s
    a delicate balance to strike. <BR> <BR>Flashfonter doesn&#39;t support the greys
    you can get in fog/fontlab ... does it?  <BR> <BR>very glad I started this party
    :]

  body: sorry for dual post. slow net day. impatiently, I broke the form. <BR> <BR>While
    I&#39;m wasting space, Miguel, I challenge you to do a full character set. I put
    one in Halogen and it about broke me. x__X

  body: Shure! <BR> <BR>For me,the challenge is making a pro pack pixel fonts with
    grayscale, with complete figures for flash web designers, and NTT Docomo cellphones,
    pdas... <BR> <BR>Sugar will be available with full character set like all my bitmapys..

  body: Hi Miguel. <BR> <BR>It makes a big difference of what kind of monitor you&#39;re
    looking at it with. On a CRT the b/w version looks better crisper vs blurry. On
    a flatscreen the aliased version seems smoother not blurry or jaggy. Better include
    both! <BR> <BR>-Randy

    NIce work, Miguel, as per usual. I have often <BR>wondered whether looking at
    these little fella&#39;s on screen <BR>all the time hurts your eyes more than
    &#34;regular&#34; type design? <BR> <BR>kris.
