body: I've only just started studying graphic design and this immense world of typography
  seems quite imposing and impenetrable. Does anybody have any recommendations for
  inspiring books/designers/artwork etc that can help convert me into a true typophile?

    to get an understanding of history.

  body: I think the Bringhurst is a bit dense to use as an introduction to typography.
    I would start with Thinking With Type by Ellen Lupton, or the Felici that someone
    above mentioned.
