  from 1960 and I'm wondering if anyone here might know what they used to typeset
  the following:\r\n\r\n\u2013 the main headlines\r\n\u2013 the date & price etc in
  the masthead\r\n\u2013 subheadings\r\n\u2013 main body copy\r\n\r\nThank you for
  any advice! \r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/tmp1A156_3989.jpg]"

  body: "As for the nameplate -- the part that looks similar to Old English -- this
    was hand-drawn. http://www.typophile.com/node/19590 English Towne is a very rough

    text font. I don't know what it used before then.\r\nDon"

  body: "Thank you! Both very useful.\r\n\r\nDo you have any ideas about what the
    tall san-serif subhead font might be? I was thinking maybe Akzidenz, but it seems
    a bit rounder-edged or something? \r\n\r\nSorry for lack of technical terminology "
