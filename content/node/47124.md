  them to be useless for what ought to be a ridiculously simple question.  I have
  also briefly poked around the Adobe site in search of documentation.</em>\r\n\r\nWhat
  are the codepoints for ornaments in Adobe Caslon Pro?  For example, I am looking
  for the floral heart (\u201C\u2766\u201D), which ought to be <code>U+2766</code>,
  and for the border-drawing characters.  Such characters are displayed in the Adobe
  store\u2019s glyph complement PDFs for multiple family members, but are not to be
  found at the proper Unicode points; the PDFs in question are locked down, of course,
  preventing me from simply doing a plaintext copy into an editor that can tell me
  which bits are being used.  A quick glance through the PUA reveals nothing, although
  I really did not waste too much time eyeballing line after line of empty boxes in
  the chart.  I am not (yet) enough of an OT/PS savant to strip the files apart and
  search under the hood for what I need.\r\n\r\nI have peeked into several family
  members within Adobe Caslon Pro, OpenType version 2.015 (PostScript outlines), to
  no avail.\r\n\r\nBy the way, if there are any Adobe folks watching, what are the
  chances your Caslon family will see (carefully-extrapolated) additions of more internationalization
  glyphs?  If so, is there an upgrade path that does not involve repurchasing family
  members outright?  And dare I even dream of the font family being extended with
  titling caps at larger optical sizes, and larger or smaller optical sizes for text?\r\n\r\nThanks
  in advance to all who may render aid\u2014and my thanks to Carol Twombly for reducing
  Mr. Caslon\u2019s brilliant type to those mathematical imperatives more appropriate
  for modern usage.\r\n\r\nProse Eleven\r\n"

  body: "Prose, if you are using InDesign, the ornaments are accessible through the
    glyph pallet. By the way, most of these very nice ornaments did not originate
    with Caslon, according to historian James Mosley . \r\n\r\nAccording to what I
    have read, Carol Twombly stopped doing type design some years ago, so there are
    unlikely to be optical sizes. Originally there was some initial design of a display
    size, but this seems to have been never completed. \r\n\r\nThe text size of my
    new interpretation of Caslon will, I hope, soon be complete and out from Font
    Bureau. I have drawn other optical sizes, but completion is further in the future.
    I haven't planned on doing ornaments.   \r\n\r\nCurrently for normal book display
    sizes you have Caslon 540, a good type based on ATF's interpretation, and for
    very large sizes, you have Matthew Carter's superb Big Caslon."

    is Justin Howes's extremely well-intentioned ITC Founders Caslon, available in
    several sizes, and there must be additional sizes hanging around because Justin
    certainly sent me some when I asked for them. \r\n\r\nJustin hadn't got to the
    point of really knowing anything about fitting before his tragic early death,
    and ITC at that point had nobody it could afford to call on to help him (one reason
    ITC was so keen on the release was that it wasn't costing them anything upfront),
    so the worst problems were fixed by Ilene Stritzver (?) as I recall, with a lot
    of kerning, which is not the right way to do it. I advised Mark Batty not to release
    it in its then-form, and was surprised that the specimen book looked as good as
    it did - - a truly exceptional feat of typesetting.\r\n\r\nI understand that George
    Abrams's Caslon has not been released? George thought it was miles better than
    Carol Twombley's. I thought it was pretty uninspired, when I saw it. I expect
    George was the only one of us to possess his own copy of Caslon's famous specimen
    sheet. He offered to lend it to me. I wonder what he would have done if I had
    accepted? \r\n\r\nMy favourite Caslon is of course the Great Primer (?) -- the
    appx 18 point - - but that is the weight that owes least to Caslon . . . . this
    may have been revived by someone under the name 'Couna Caslon' or something like
    that ? "
