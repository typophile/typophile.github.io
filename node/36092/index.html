  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>I&rsquo;m a second-year undergraduate student in the electrical and computer engineering program at the tiny, young <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Olin College<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, and I&rsquo;ve been interested in studying typography for some time. I don&rsquo;t know if I&rsquo;ll ever end up working in the design world, but I&rsquo;d like to explore my options while an undergraduate &ndash; and since I have the opportunity to study away for a semester, I thought that that might be a good time to go study type intensively and see if it&rsquo;s a field I could eventually work in for a living.</p>
<p>My question, then, is whether there are any worthwhile undergraduate typography programs I should be looking at. Searching Typophile and the web turned up a lot of references to the University of Reading, though almost everything I&rsquo;ve found there is about the MA Type Design program. Can anyone offer some insight into their undergraduate typography courses? Are there other universities with undergraduate typography programs that I should know about?</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Are you referring to typography or type design? They are not the same thing. If you want to study undergraduate typography any school with a good design program will do, and  at worst many design schools offer basic typography classes via continuing education programs for working professionals.</p>
<p>Undergraduate type design courses are much harder to find. Karen Cheng teaches them regularly at the University of Washington, but in most undergrad programs they are offered sporadically or as individual guided study, if at all. I have heard about type design classes being taught in both the LA and Bay areas of California, but never nailed down the details, the local AIGA chapters might be able to help you with information there.</p>

		<div class="commentbody">Sorry, I didn&rsquo;t mean to conflate typography and type design, I should have been more clear: at this point typography is what I&rsquo;m looking into. I didn&rsquo;t know if there is anything in particular that the Typophile community recommends (I saw the list of schools in the wiki, but for the most part that seems to just be links to the schools' own sites). I suppose that&rsquo;s an overly broad question, though.</div>
