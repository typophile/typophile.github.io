  body: "Hey Chung,\r\n\r\nIt's probably a typeface they designed themselves, I'm
    study type design and typography in holland the Hague and the system used for
    this face is what's teached nowadays. The repetition of forms: if you look at
    the shape of the \"u\" this is simply a rotated \"n\" and the \"n\" is the left
    side of the \"m\". This system works in the beginning of type design but is not
    as sophisticated as typefaces that are constructed for the best optical effect.\r\n\r\nFor
    these reasons I think it's something done by this academy.\r\nI do think it's
    a nice typeface for headings though.\r\n\r\ngood luck,\r\nSidney"
