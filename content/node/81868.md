body: "Hi folks,\r\n\r\nI'm trying to figure out how I can get the GREP function to
  locate all hyphens in my document and change them to en dashes. In addition, I'd
  also like to add a space before and after the en dashes... a lot of the hyphens
  in my text document are sitting adjacent to the last letter in a word.\r\n\r\nAttached
  is a screen grab of what I'm hoping to achieve (top is bad, bottom is what I'd like
  to change to).\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Picture_6672.jpg]\r\n\r\nAny
  tips would be incredible helpful. Adobe forums have been useless!\r\n\r\nThx\r\n\r\nJ\r\n\r\n"

  body: No need to use grep. Just use the regular Find&Replace to replace hyphen with
    'space' en-dash 'space', then replace 'space' 'space' with 'space'.

  body: "With GREP, you could search for <code>\\s*-\\s*</code> and replace that by
    <code>_\u2013_</code> (use spaces instead of the underscores).\r\nThis will match
    any number of spaces (including zero) and any kind of spaces (including non-breaking
    and thin ones etc.), before and after the hyphen."

  body: "> then replace 'space' 'space' with 'space'\r\n\r\nOne of the built-in GREP
    searches is \"Multiple Spaces to Single Space\".  It's better than just searching
    for \"space space\", because it'll also take care of situations where there are
    more than 2 spaces.\r\n\r\nI use it routinely on documents to eliminate multiple
    spaces. "

    why I always run the replace more than once, until there are zero substitutions.\r\n\r\nBy
    the way, Joseph (jidoe), are you sure there are no legitimate hyphens in your
    text?"
