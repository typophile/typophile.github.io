    been having.

    help even more in addition.

    to work with in tracking down nodes based on uninformative titles like \"Help
    me!\" \r\nHope the revised system works well.\r\nDon"

  body: any hope of seeing the lovely "new post" indicators like on the old board?
    or response count? i really like those features. helps me sort who has been helped
    and who has not.

    otherwise I'm continually looking at threads to see what i've already read. You'll
    get it straightened out  :)

  body: "I agree that the \"new\" indicator is the most important element to add.\r\nSome
    more notes:\r\n\r\na) The last poster (which were shown in the old id forum) is
    also a convenient piece of info.\r\nExample 1: If a request has 1 reply and the
    last post is the original author the request is probably not yet solved (I know
    that this is supposed to be replaced by the \"solved\" flag, but I'm afraid this
    will not be updated until a request reach the 2nd page of requests)\r\nExample
    2: Even if a request is solved I'm personally interested in following and reading
    comments of specific posters.\r\n\r\nb) I notice that the messages I post by replying
    to an id request, do not show now in \"My Profile->My Posts\".\r\nAs there is
    no other method (email notification, etc) to know that a new message has been
    posted in a thread I participated, I used a refresh on \"\"My Profile->My Posts\"
    page to check if there any responses to my messages. \r\nIs there any alternative?\r\nIf
    not, is it possible to enable the posts to be shown in \"My Profile->My Posts\"?\r\n\r\nThanks
    for all the effort to make the font-id section better ;)\r\nFivos"

  body: "If the idea is to direct newbies to the proper forum, wouldn't it be better
    to link directly to the new forum on the Forums page? \r\n\r\nInstead we have
    a 3-step process where they 1) click a link labelled \"OLD\" in red (and I assume
    some see that and don't read the light gray type below it), then 2) click a link
    to read the \"forum has moved\" article, and then 3) click a link to go to the
    new forum.\r\n\r\nThis isn't a criticism, I know you're working to make things
    better, but it just seems like a direct link might be better for new folks.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/forum_3952.jpg]"
