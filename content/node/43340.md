  body: IMHO there are many geometric sans of higher quality than Century Gothic.
    You might show your client Futura, Chalet, Gotham, Avenir, or Avant Garde if that's
    the look he/she is going for.

  body: "You won\u2019t get a corporate font for free. In my understanding, a corporate
    font would at least include a couple of weights with italics, and a decent character
    set. Not the thing you\u2019ll find on Dafont & Co.\r\n\r\nIf all you\u2019re
    looking for is a cheap geometric sans, have a look at the <a href=\"http://www.ascendercorp.com/CreativityFontPack/fontlistings.html\">Ascender
    Creativity Font Pack</a>. 30 fonts for a mere $19.99; including two weights of
    an infrequently seen geo sans, Eagle.\r\n\r\nF"

  body: I would like to suggest not using a geometric sans if this is going to lead
    to a "corporate font". The geometrics are fine for display usages, but corporate
    fonts tend to get used for the body of memos and such. A humanist sans would be
    much more readable for longer works.
