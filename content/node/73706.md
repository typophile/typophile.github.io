  looking in the issue of Helvetica being overused in design. I had read about the
  post regarding the issues whether or not helvetica is great or not. \r\n\r\nI read
  about some of the reasons that popularize helvetica and why helvetica should not
  be use on just about everything. \r\n\r\nMy studio project aims to convince people
  (designers) that helvetica is way overused.\r\n\r\nI was wondering if it is viable
  doing so? \r\n\r\nIs it just me or are there many that agrees that helvetica is
  overuse?"

    alternative to Helvetica (if at all possible) because I find that it's overuse
    in especially wellness related magazines and packaging is troubling. Mind you,
    my design is not meant to replace Helvetica, but to offer designers a choice.\r\n\r\nSee

  body: "I continue to use Helvetica a lot because several of my corporate clients
    require it as part of their graphic standards. One reason that many companies
    use Helvetica is because they know that every employee and every vendor they use
    probably has either Helvetica or Arial on their computer already.\r\n\r\nOveruse
    is not a big issue to me as long as it's appropriate for the situation; after
    all, many of the classic fonts continue to be used a lot. But I worry sometimes
    that Helvetica can look a little dated, since it's strongly associated with the
    look of corporate pieces done a decade or two ago."

  body: "Jean the font looks awesome to me, clean and simple =)\r\n\r\nOne thing with
    Helvetica is that it is supposedly to be a neutral typeface right? So why is it
    that so many people are using it? \r\n\r\nIt doesn't communicates any ideology,
    emotion, etc.\r\n\r\nJamesM i agreed that sometimes it's the client's choice,
    designers have not much say since they are paying... ARGH!... \r\n\r\nThanks guys
    for the comments! I'm hoping to find a direction I can work with haha."

    alternatives and replacements popping up.
