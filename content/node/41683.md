  someone explain all these differences and why is there so many versions? BQ, BE,
  Next?\r\nAnd what is with AG Old face - is that Akzidenz Grotesk too, in info it
  says: \r\nThis design emphasizes the 19th Century hand-setting roots of the original
  Akzidenz-Grotesk.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the end what version is the best? I sure like
  BE because of that lowercase a in medium weight, especially because of how  Muller
  Brockmann used it. Others?\r\n\r\nThanks.\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: "The metal face Berthold published varied hugely from size to size.\r\nFor
    instance, if you look at the early 1950s specimen book, you'll see that some sizes
    have angled endings to the terminals on S while others have a flat ending, as
    the clone Helvetica would. Subsequently, AG has become associated with the angled
    terminal on that letter and c and e, diverging from Helvetica.\r\n\r\nTransferring
    to phototype, most notably with the Diatronic (what a great name) system, these
    size differences were standardized, because one master design was used for all
    sizes. So the redesigners had to choose which size to use as the model, or which
    combination of features from different sizes, to work best across a range of sizes.
    Of course, there were differing interpretations.\r\n\r\nI don't think any particular
    version is best. It depends on what you use it for, and why you like it. If one
    version gives you the Brockmann vibe, and that's something you can relate to,
    that's cool. \r\n\r\nI used to like AG, Helvetica, Univers and Folio etc., 25
    years ago, but have \"been there done that\" and am now more interested in newer
    ideas of what a sans serif can be, and also older ones!--like how the genre originated
    way back in the 19th century.\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: "More than a hundred years ago Berthold (a typecaster that had acquired quite
    a few other firms) consolidated several cuts of typefaces (from multiple sources)
    in the then extremely hip and desirable style of sans serif under the brand 'Akzidenz
    Grotesk'. \r\nThese fonts had no other relationship than a common style. But they
    were all the rage. Smart marketing. \r\n(In a way it is one of these cases where
    a common name turns into a brand. Akzidenz Grotesk is a very descriptive name,
    roughly translates to 'Jobbing sans type'.)\r\n\r\n . . .\r\nBert Vanderveen BNO"

  body: Berthold Akzidenz Grotesk BE is just the Berthold Akzidenz Grotesk BQ version
    that used to be licensed to Adobe. Berthold Akzidenz Grotesk Next is the new version
    that introduces more consistency regarding weights.
