body: We are currently making a book about typography in one of my classes. I was
  assigned to do 3 spreads on the font Bodoni. I&#39;m good for all the historical
  aspects of the font, what I&#39;m missing is mostly some uses for the font in our
  comtemporary society. I know a lot of magazines and products use it but I don&#39;t
  know which in particular. If some of you are aware of which company &#40;magazine,
  label, product, newspaper,etc.&#41; uses this font, I would really appreciate it
  if you could help me out. <BR> <BR>Thanks  <BR> <BR>

  body: Harper&#39;s Bazaar has always as I remember used Didot. I had a love for
    this magazine once upon a time. But since Liz Tilberis &#40;editor in chief&#41;
    passed away it has gone to the crapper. &#40;However I was warming to what Ms.
    Betts was doing before Glenda Bailey took over.&#41; It was Fabian Baron&#39;s
    brilliance &#40;creative director, demigod of design&#41; and photographer&#39;s
    such as Stephen Meisel, Patrick Demarchelier, Arthur Elgort, Herb Ritts and Peter
    Lindbergh who did wonders and set them on a path of beauty. Too bad it is not
    longer like that. The photography is still beautiful, but the magazine seems thin
    and totally lacking, anti-substantial. <BR> <BR>Anyway, look into the work of
    Fabian Baron. He&#39;s the maestro of Didot as far as I am concerned &#40;especially
    his work for Italian Vogue in the early 90s&#41;. And before Fabian there was
    Alexey Brodovitch &#40;Bazaar&#41; and Cipe Pineles &#40;Charm&#41;.

    <BR> <BR>Pentagram has done some magazine design. They seem to enjoy Bodoni.

    into Helvetica. I&#39;m just thinking off the top of my head now but didn&#39;t
    Bradbury Thompson and Paul Rand use a lot of Bodoni? Bauer used to have the best
    Bodoni and their Titling series is exquisite IMHO. In Rand&#39;s heyday with IBM,
    Bodoni was used almost exclusively for everything. '

  body: Tiffany -- I&#39;ll take the Bauer version over that WTC Bodoni any day. It
    looks too much like the Century Schoolbook of metal type days. The x height is
    wrong for a true Bodoni -- IMO.

    You will also  <BR>find Bodoni used in many logos in the fashion and cosmetic
    industries, such  <BR>as Elizabeth Arden, some of the product lines for Guerlain,
    Giorgio Armani,  <BR>and the CK logo for Calvin Klein. While many of these logos
    are custom drawn,  <BR>&#40; &#34;R&#34; in Armani&#41;, often these companies
    use Bodoni as a text or title face in  <BR>their promotional materials. Going
    back farther in time: as Paul mentioned, <BR>there were also many wonderful examples
    of Bodoni used by IBM. Karl Gerstner  <BR>designed a beautiful volume in 1984
