body: My employer (a law firm) has adopted Century or Century Schoolbook for most
  documents I produce. (This is a result of a combination of style and very restrictive
  court rules.) I'd like to use a true small caps in those documents, but I can't
  find anywhere to buy a set with small caps in either font. Any tips? Thanks.

  body: Josh, sorry I have no suggestion about small caps in Century. You may be confusing
    people with your reference to "system fonts". When I read that, I thought you
    wanted small caps for a UI (user interface) for some software. But from your post
    it seems that you're just making documents with Microsoft Word. What "system"
    are you talking about?

      about fonts that come built into software, which I've seen referred to as system
      fonts.\r\nSi_Daniels: I'm aware of Word's limitations on OpenType small caps.
      I'm looking for a separate font file that contains a Century version of small
      caps. Are you saying that the fonts that come packaged with Word 2010 have small
      caps, but Word doesn't have a way to access them, or are you saying that small
      caps is available for those fonts elsewhere?\r\nJens: Thanks. I'll look into
      that font and see how it works."

    Perhaps the Century style went out of fashion before any old typefaces had been
    digitized properly & completely.\r\n\r\nOne of the few digital Century versions
    that have small caps is <a href=\"http://www.houseind.com/fonts/eames\">Eames
    Century Modern</a>. But it may be too special for your court rules ;)"

    During the 90's they had the Linotype GX Core Set which had Century Schoolbook
    Small Caps. Have you tried contacting Linotype via email and asking about it?
    You may find that they do in fact have it, but you need to be able to buy it as
    a standalone font for use in Word.\r\n\r\nLinotype <i>does</i> sell Red Rooster's
    TC Century New Style Expert which has Small Caps but I haven't compared it to
    mainstream Century's.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.linotype.com/317346/TCCenturyNewStyle-family.html\r\n\r\nHTH\r\n\r\nGeorge"

    I'm surprised about the description on that page:\r\n<blockquote>New Century Schoolbook

  body: "Theunis: That's a helpful list of faces, but that page was last updated in
    July 1997. A Google search for \u201CNew Century Schoolbook Caps and Small Caps\u201D
    produces one result: the page you linked to. And I don\u2019t see a link to download
    any of those font files.\r\n\r\nThat set looks like it would more than meet my
    needs. New Century Schoolbook would also work, but it\u2019s less desirable because
    it doesn\u2019t come installed in Word for Windows. I\u2019d like to avoid compatibility
    issues. Searching for \u201CNew Century Schoolbook SC\u201D brings up several
    sites to download some free fonts. I\u2019m a little nervous about doing that,
    but it\u2019s the best option I\u2019ve seen so far.\r\n\r\nFor the curious, the
    law firm adopted Century/Century Schoolbook because it\u2019s/they\u2019re already
    installed on our computers and acceptable in almost any court we practice before.
    The U.S. Supreme Court requires a font in the Century family, which is also acceptable
    in any of our local federal courts, and Indiana appellate courts, which just have
    a list of acceptable fonts rather than a chosen family, require one of the following
    fonts:\r\nArial, Baskerville, Book Antigua, Bookman, Bookman Old Style, Century,
    Century Schoolbook, Courier, Courier New, CG Times, Garamond, Georgia, New Baskerville,
    New Century Schoolbook, Palatino or Times New Roman [[http://www.in.gov/judiciary/rules/appellate/index.html#_Toc313022210]].\r\n\r\nThe
    only overlap between the U.S. Supreme Court and Indiana appellate courts is with
    Century, Century Schoolbook, or New Century Schoolbook. Only the first two are
    included in the firm\u2019s software.\r\n\r\nThanks to all. This forum has been
    a real help.\r\n"
