  body: "<em>I'm under the impression that the Nick is simply a visual and tactile
    reference when working with type, and its size, shape and general orientation
    or height on the Belly are not specific?</em>\r\nFrom what I can tell, this is
    correct \u2013 in my (limited) experience, the nick differs between fonts in order
    to visually determine whether or not all the characters being composed in a line
    are indeed from the same family. An example I can cite is when I was typesetting
    last week and inadvertently mixed up a 12pt Bodoni with the 12pt Walbaum I was
    setting my lines in \u2013 a quick glance at the nicks plainly showed that one
    character in my line was not of the same font. It could very well be that there
    is some kind of system that determines where the nick is located, but I can't
    seem to find any from working with metal type. The only pattern I can discern
    is that it tends to be in the top half of the character.\r\n\r\n<em>As for the
    Groove, is there a contextual consistency held within each font, or are the ways
    of determining it's impression depth and orientation between the Feet?</em>\r\nLike
    the nick, it seems that the groove can differ between fonts, but within the same
    font it stays consistent.\r\n\r\n<em>Need measurements for the profile of a metal
    type body at 30pts</em>\r\nI can grab a photo of all the sides of a piece of 30pt
    next to a pica stick for you this weekend if you'd like. Get in touch and let
    me know if you'd like a specific face; I'll do my best to accomodate."

  body: That would be great, and would surely be appreciated. I'll send some additional
    details to your e-mail in case you can provide hi-res photos, otherwise, posting
    them here will likely be of benefit to someone down the road.

  body: "The nick is a result of the specific body mold used in casting the type.
    Type foundries commonly used differing nick positions and multiple nicks to indicate
    a specific face, thus distinguishing among multiple sizes of a face such as Copperplate
    Gothic or Engravers Roman which had several sizes of Caps on the same size body.
    The nick commonly also was specific for a specific face, so wrong font characters
    could be noticed easily while setting. Since it was the set-up of the mold that
    determined the nick arrangement, variations occured as various foundries changed
    their equipment and procedures. Also, the mold normally used in Monotype casting
    machines had only a single position for the nick, so different Monotype faces
    and multiple sizes such as Copperplate often cannot be distinguished or sorted
    by this mark.\r\n\r\nThe nick almost always indicates the bottom position of the
    typeface design, thus allowing a visual check as type is hand-set in the composing
    stick with the nick facing up (with the typeface upside down but reading left
    to right as it is set). The only exception to this is when a type might have been
    cast upside down on the body due to some peculiarity in the matrix or design -
    I have one font of Hebrew type, for example, which has the nick at the top side
    of the letterform, and a couple of European fonts, and a couple of 19th century
    oddities resulting from use of old matrices to fit on more recent body molds.\r\n\r\nThe
    groove on the foot of the type results from the spew where the metal flowed into
    the body mold, which must be broken off and trimmed. The Monotype caster cuts
    this jet off flat, so there is no groove on monotype though there may be air bubbles
    in the casting that leave a pattern where the groove would be. Most foundry type
    has a groove in the center between the feet. Type cast on a Thompson caster often
    has the groove closer to one edge on the foot, though that machine could be adjusted
    to cut the groove in the center to look like other foundry type. The depth and
    shape of the groove is immaterial although it would indicate a differing machine
    or plough was used to cut the foot of that type, thus suggesting it was cast at
    a different time.\r\n\r\nThese markings are useful indications that something
    may be amiss in setting type, but variations and contradictions occur. They are
    consequences of the various possible ways type may be cast, and are part of the
    compositor's awareness though not always reliable. "
