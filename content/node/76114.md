  body: Perpetua Titling is definitely useable in a pinch. Thanks very much for your
    help Stephen. I've got the rest of today to find a exact  match. I still wonder
    if there is anyone that may be able to pinpoint it.

  body: It looks like it could be a bad tracing job. The outlines are very simplified.
