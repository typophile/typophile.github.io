  is running an article about how web content creators are making money selling t-shirts</a>,
  partly because it\u2019s easier to sell a t-shirt promoting web content than it
  is to monetize the content itself.\r\n\r\nThis leads me to wonder: could this be
  applied to free web fonts? A big market for web fonts is about to open up\u2014all
  the major browsers are close to supporting some sort of web fonts, and designers
  are itching to use them. Unfortunately, there are a lot of annoying licensing, piracy
  and DRM issues in the way. Why not just give away fonts and make money selling merchandise?
  An entire foundry could be modeled after Threadless\u2014promote the foundry with
  the fonts, have contests to design merch using the fonts, sell the merch, the merch
  then promotes the site. \r\n\r\nOf course this doesn\u2019t work for all fonts\u2014Fontshop
  can\u2019t give away all 999 Meta/Meta Serif fonts and make the money back with
  merch. But this might be a viable business model for display type. \r\n\r\nThoughts?"

    hundreds of shirts, mugs, pens, a documentary, various books etc., but these have
    generated little direct revenue for Linotype. '

    wrong *often*. They're known for how often they get it wrong, too, and that's
    why I don't pay them. If I invented a new folding bicycle they would claim it
    will save the world, or some forgettable blather like that.\r\n\r\nThe problem
    is Red vs. Blue is a popular claymation series featuring appealing characters
    with human-like qualities and personality traits who get into a heap of trubble
    each week. Peeple love that. They love pretty fonts too, but do they get sufficiently
    enthusiastic about them to buy t-shirts and other merch featuring the fonts? \r\n\r\nYes,
    some type enthusiasts would go that far, but the numbers are too small to make
    it worthwhile. I estimate a scheme like that for a font would only generate sufficient
    revenue to meet the cost of having t-shirts and mugs printed. Would there be profit
    in it? Only for really trendy overwrought, overstylized, overblown commercial
    juggernauts like Bello script and Dolly.\r\n\r\nSii, I guess Linotype aren't benefiting
    from the revenue generated by Helv t-shirts, mugs, pens and such like because
    it's mainly third parties and after marketeers who are selling the merch.\r\n\r\nj
