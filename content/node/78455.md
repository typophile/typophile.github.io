  design company. I am trying to avoid VAG Rounded which seems to fit but I want something
  a bit less commercially used. I tried id'ing these fonts on the whatthefont site
  but the suggestions were off. Any help would be appreciated for any of these links:
  These seem to share some similarities with VAG rounded but are off in a nice way.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.robvanhoesel.nl/index.php?/identities/kop/\r\n\r\nhttp://www.robvanhoesel.nl/index.php?/identities/graphic-design-festival-breda/\r\n\r\nThanks
  for your help!\r\nAmrita"
