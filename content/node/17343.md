  it just be a long s + a short s? any authorities on the subject, please post.\r\noh,
  and another, related question: is it kosher to make a beta-looking eszett? i mean,
  is it okay for there to be a kink in the middle? or should that all be smooth through
  there?"

  body: Sorry, Andreas, I don't think I still have the book because I found it of
    limited value. The kind of cursive writing taught in Germany around the time that
    my mother's mother was a schoolgirl in Garmisch-Partenkirchen (just before the
    turn of the twentieth century) has several character shapes which are radically
    different (hence, pretty unreadable) from English or American takes on the same
    letters. This fact probably explains why, in the past, I have found a number of
    otherwise beautifully lettered old German posters almost impossible to read when
    the lettering was cursive or Italic. However, I did notice the rather unusual
    -- and, in terms of economy of design, rather clever -- double-s, and that's why
    it ended up in my swipe file.

    you know it's Berlin. These forms are rather peculiar to Berlin street signage
    and are still used in that context, but I'd be cautious in designing the glyphs
    as default in the situation. \r\n\r\nA.\r\n"

    don't show the double-s form I posted, they do show the components of that form.
    And, yes, that form is similar to a script Thorn: the primary difference is that
    the stroke terminates inside the loop on the thorn, and outside the loop (turning
    it into a counter) with the double-s.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/suetterlin.gif]"
