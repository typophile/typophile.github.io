  en dash (I prefer it to the em) followed by another punctuation mark?\r\n\r\nLike:\r\n\r\n1.
  (a) \"Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet \u2013 \" / (b) \"Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet \u2013\"\r\n2.
  (a) Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet \u2013 ! / (b) Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet \u2013!\r\n3.
  (a) \"Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet \u2013 !\" / (b) \"Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet \u2013!\"\r\n\r\nI've
  searched and searched and haven't found anything that's pointed me in the right
  direction. I vaguely remember seeing someone use the en but then switch to the em
  if it's at the end of a sentence/paragraph, but I don't find that particularly appealing.
  If I want to keep the en should I just keep the trailing space even if it's only
  followed by some punctuation mark(s) as opposed to the rest of a sentence?"

  body: "Chicago recommends the em dash as the general purpose \"dash\" punctuation
    character, with no space around it, but a whole lot of typographers don't like
    that. And there are plenty of situations in which this choice may be the designer's
    to make.\r\n\r\nI generally don't use en dashes this way (a contemporary British
    practice, mainly), but I do use spaced em dashes this way (a contemporary American
    practice, mainly) \u2014 though I often condense them 75% as a visual compromise.
    Here are the rules:\r\n\r\n1. Space the dash on both sides in running text: Lorem
    ipsum \u2014 dolor sit amet.\r\n2. Space the dash even when it denotes an interruption:
    Lorem ipsum \u2014\r\n3. Do not put a space between the dash and a quotation mark:
    \"Lorem ipsum \u2014\"\r\n4. The only time the dash is ever flush with a text
    character is if a sentence ends <em>mid-word</em>: \"Lorem ips\u2014\"\r\n\r\nI
    can't really think of any plausible construction in standard contemporary English
    that would put a dash next to another punctuation character, so I've never considered
    it. Your examples 2 and 3 look ungrammatical to me. It's either a dash or an exclamation
    point, you can't have both. If the person is interrupted, then leave off the exclamation
    point.\r\n\r\nOf course, dashes mixed with other punctuation were common in earlier
    forms of English, but then at that time they were always set as unspaced em dahes
    anyway, so there were no typographic choices to be made. Contemporary editorial
    practice doesn't generally allow dashes and other punctuation together, except
    quotes.\r\n\r\n<em>If</em> I were using spaced en dashes as my general purpose
    dash character, which I have occasionally done, the <em>only</em> time I would
    use an em dash instead is if a sentence broke off mid-word. Otherwise, the rules
    above are the same. But then again, if there are a lot of interruptions in the
    text, I would argue that using the en as the standard dash is an inappropriate
    design choice, because a text with many interruptions probably warrants a stronger
    visual interruption on the page."

    the editor to check). \r\n\r\nAnother option is to ask the writer/editor if the
    sentence can be rewritten, although if it's indicating an unfinished sentence
    you may be stuck with it."

  body: "The problem is that this question really deals with dialogue in fiction,
    and most style guides are not for fiction. Chicago is useless as a guide for editing,
    say, a novel. It's a handbook for scholarly publishing. I doubt it has a stance
    on sentences ending partway through, as this is unlikely to come up in scholarly
    nonfiction. And even if it does have a stance, it's probably irrelevant because
    Chicago assumes an entirely different context.\r\n\r\nThere might be a style guide
    that the editor is using that can give you valid advice. But this is more likely
    a \"house style\" thing, or a typographer's choice. Besides, style guides are
    for editors. This is not an editorial decision, it's a typographic one \u2014
    though if the editor doesn't like your decision, she will presumably disagree.\r\n\r\nIf
    you're looking for concrete guidance, it would be found not in an editorial style
    manual like Chicago or APA, but a typographic style manual like Bringhurst or
    Felici. Or an in-house typographic style manual, but these may very well be written
    per publication by the typographer who designs it \u2014 i.e., you."

    context. First person to be satisfied is the client, and their editors, if any.
    That's just so you can get hired (again).\r\n\r\nNext is the job you're hired
    for. That is almost never \"pleasing yourself\" (politicians should make note
    of this, too). There is always an audience. If you want to instruct that audience,
    write something. If nobody want's to buy it, you got one kind of answer on the
    value of your opinion.\r\n\r\nAn exception is if you can come up with something
    that pleases you, and no one else notices, esp. to the point of objection. \"Not
    notices\" is still best. Now as an aside, with dashes, we've found over a 25-year
    \"test\" that we can get away with setting a three-quarter em long dash centered
    in an em space. Go to a spaced en and you're going to get blowback -- as a number
    of well-known and accomplished designers from the U.K. learned when hey started
    working in the States. Or if you buy a book by an American author -- say Raymond
    Chandler -- published in the U.K., presuming a U.K audience, that stye will be
    used and some Americans will object. \r\n\r\nWhy the fuss over the small matter
    of punctuation? Two reasons: Typography is about communication, not art. And if
    that seems lacking to you, consider this: if you don't see the principle, someday
    you're choose an inappropriate typeface because it \"pleases you\" -- like the
    idiot who chose Perpetua to set <cite> Up in the Old Hotel</cite>.\r\n\r\n"
