body: Hi everybody ! This is my first post on typophile, and I would greatly appreciate
  to get some feedback on this design. I&#39;ve been working on it for a few weeks.
  It is my first serif typeface, although I think small text sizes won&#39;t work.
  thanks in advance for comments !<img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/20709.jpg"

  body: So far, I like it.  Not sure about the empty gap in the number four where
    the strokes cross.  Could you render out a few sentences with it that mix caps
    and lowercase so I can easily compare letterform heights/descenders, etc?

  body: Very elegant, beautiful, and distinctive. My only advice would be to raise
    the crossbar of the F to match that of the E.

  body: Whow, that is reactivity ! <BR>Well, about the strokes on the number four,
    these are just crossing paths which were not merged, as I wasn&#39;t sure of the
    overall design of this numeral so far. <BR>Here is a further sample of some lines...
    If you meant smaller text sizes and longer lines, I&#39;ll provide. <BR>I have
    doubts on the uppercase K and the Euro symbol...<img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/20722.jpg"
