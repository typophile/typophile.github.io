  in the Leisure and Recreation/Resort market. Do you have any suggestions for top
  typefaces that would work well throughout a resort-oriented environment? For example,
  families of classic type that would well in the lobby of a great destination hotel
  (non-mt. lodge type) as well as on wayfinding signage, dinner menus, golf course
  graphics -- pretty much the entire complex.\r\n\r\nPics of actual/conceptual samples
  would be appreciated for review only. Thanks very much."

  body: "That would depend on what kind of brand identity the client wants to convey.
    Is this a tropical resort or a ski resort? High-end Ritz Carlton-level or more
    mid-priced Marriot level? There is a lot of criteria that have to be addressed
    before typeface suggestions can be made.\r\n\r\nDavid"
