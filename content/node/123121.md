body: "I'm getting to the final stages of writing a book on economic philosophy. The
  central thesis: human societies have experienced only three basic \"fields\" of
  socio-economic behavior: agriculture/mining, mass production, and services; mass
  human labor is no longer needed in these three fields; a new fourth economy is necessary.\r\n\r\nI
  am attempting to set the format and type in InDesign, and would appreciate a critique
  (knowing full well there will be a wide variety of opinions). My interest is to
  put out the best, most readable design possible.\r\n\r\nIn InDesign, page dimensions:
  22.86 cm (9 in) x 15.24 cm (6 in)... basically, a somewhat standard book size.\r\nMargins
  are set to: 2.18 cm Top/Bottom and 1.12 cm Inside and 3.12 cm Outside (simple footnotes
  are in the outside margins, as well as page numbers).\r\n\r\nI've had a devil of
  a time choosing a typeface. I wanted to get away from the standard Garamond, Baskerville,
  etc. types, but still formal for a book subject as economic philosophy. I seem to
  be hovering over the new release of ITC New Veljovic... the spacing is very generous,
  making the complex subject of philosophy a bit easier on the eye. My second choice
  was Brioni (Typotheque), which has a larger x-height. Third and fourth choice was
  Malabar and Plantin. My technical safe fallback is Canada Type's Aragon ST (although
  I am a bit peeved at CT for other reasons). I really tried using Nick Shinn's wonderful
  Richler, but some folks thought it was just a little too colorful for the subject
  of philosophy. Using FF Clan for sans highlights and charts/graphs, etc.\r\n\r\nI
  attach 2 pdfs (a few selected pages), one with ITC New Veljovic Regular (11 pt /
  13.8 pt leading, Metric kerning) and the other with Brioni Light (10.5 / 13.8...
  and with Brioni, I've committed the dual sins of using 10pt tracking with optical
  kerning due to Brioni being so tightly spaced)... footnote numbers use opentype
  features of sups, rather than InDesign manually adjusting the font... the public
  book version is really an abridged version of the larger book, (the larger book
  uses more complex mathematical and quantum physics equations, which I've edited
  out of the abridged version for easier reading by the masses). So I need a typeface
  with really sophisticated capabilities with alpha-numeric sups/subs, etc... (hence
  the typeface choices).\r\n\r\nThe typeface used for the cover is Greta Display.\r\n\r\nHere
  a couple of mockups, and the 2 pdf files are below:\r\n\r\nhttp://s7.postimg.org/6ktty6mwr/WBNcover_v4_Mockup_Closeup.png\r\n\r\nhttp://s16.postimg.org/4z3pdxg51/WBNcover_v4_Mockup.png\r\n\r\nhttp://s22.postimg.org/ok40774pt/WBN_insidepages_titlepage.png\r\n\r\nhttp://s12.postimg.org/6a2v713cd/WBN_inside_veljovic.png\r\n\r\nPDF

  body: 'Thanks @GrubStreet for the observation. Indeed, the foundation of the book
    is to persistently make comparisons between the socio-economic paradigms existing
    in the 1800s versus the present. My first Ph.D. thesis (Hegelian Dialectics) was
    five years in the making. I took an unusual route. On the side, I studied Gestalt
    therapy. My oral argument, lasting 9 full hours, was "playing" in a Gestalt method:
    I as Adam Smith in one chair would have a dialogue with myself as Thomas Aquinas
    sitting in the facing chair. So yes, the title of Wealth Beyond Nations is an
    extremely specific choice.'

  body: "How is this being printed? Paperback or hardcover? Print on demand or offset
    or other? I see the picture looks hardcover.\r\n\r\nMARGINS\r\n\r\nThe thing that
    jumped out at me was your inner margin, less than half an inch. I do not have
    experience setting hardcover books, but this seems small. Look at similar books
    in the bookstore or library to be sure your text will not dip into the gutter.
    Have you consulted with the printer on this? Also, on my screen it seemed that
    your left and right pages have a different inner margin. If it's paperback, the
    inner margin is much too small.\r\n\r\nRe: the outer margin. How close is the
    text (footnotes) to the edge of the book? Is your printer okay with this?\r\n\r\nCOVER\r\n\r\nIf
    you are selling or marketing your book on the internet, the cover has to look
    good at internet sizes. Specifically this is postage stamp and a half size for
    Amazon. A similar size will be used by internet reviewers. Don't let this be a
    surprise. Check it out.\r\n\r\nI had difficulty telling that the graphic is a
    torch. Maybe this is because of the arty angled photo of the cover, but get some
    feedback on this.\r\n\r\nFONTS\r\n\r\nI much preferred the Brioni text. You called
    the spacing of the Veljovic \"generous\", but I just call it \"loose\". To my
    eyes and brain it is too loose.\r\n\r\nSince you have adjusted the spacing of
    the fonts, you should ask yourself whether it reads better without the ff and
    ffi ligatures. Remember, it's not an art contest; you just want to know if it
    reads better.\r\n\r\nYour title page looks great.\r\n\r\nIt is all just my opinion."

  body: "J. Tillman, thanks very much for the input...\r\n\r\n... I've made some fundamental
    changes:\r\n\r\n1. Changing the \"sidenotes\" to conventional footnotes... this
    frees up the seemingly impossible task to cramming everything to a 6 x 9 format,
    (effective margins, body text, and sidenotes)...\r\n\r\n2. Thus, inside and outside
    margins are equal at 2 cm. BTW, this \"abridged version\" is probably going to
    be about 75 - 80 pages. The full version will be about double this... so the new
    margins of 2 cm should be workable.\r\n\r\n3. Reverted to Brioni for the body
    text... 10.5 / 13.8 / 10 pt tracking / optical kerning / ligatures are off / hyphenation
    is 3 characters (after first / before last)\r\n\r\nSo, here are a couple sample
    pages of the changed format:\r\nhttp://ge.tt/5Nm4F0A2/v/0?c\r\n\r\nThis abridged
    version most likely to be printed paperback. Not sure, yet, about the full version
    of the book.\r\n\r\nWill focus more energy toward the cover (art) after I nail
    down the text... personally, I would like for the cover to be as simple as possible...
    will probably lose the torch... in its present design, I was initially envisioning
    a textured hardcover (hence, the textured tile look)... but a paperback format
    will probably force using simple flat colors...\r\n\r\nAgain, thanks for your
    observations... hope this comes closer to being readable...\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\nMichael"

    body: With fully justified text like this I'd be tempted to use ID's 'optical
      margin alignment'. I know it's not everyone's cup of tea but I think it does
      a reasonable job of 'squaring' up the text block (which presumably is the point
      of full justification).

  body: "I assume this is a self-published book. It looks like a debossed cover; be
    aware that this will raise printing costs. Also it looks like the bottom word
    (\"Nations\") has no color in it. I'd recommend putting at least a slight tint
    in it, otherwise it'll be difficult to read under some lighting conditions (particularly
    the first and last letters which don't have a background image behind them).\r\n\r\nIf
    it will be sold in bookstores, you might consider adding some color to the cover;
    a black-and-white cover may look a little dull compared to colorful covers next
    to it (but you can keep it subtle).\r\n\r\nAlso I'd try to pick a printer who'll
    allow you to be there during printing to inspect and sign off on the cover and
    at least some of the inside pages. You don't want to find out that you're unhappy
    with the printing after the job is all done. Also you'll want to inspect some
    of the books to make sure the pages are in the proper order; even a good printer
    can occasionally make mistakes."

  body: "Re: Brioni sample 2 ... I like it. This is off-track a little, but I think
    that the italic of Brioni is very appropriate for the way this book uses italic.\r\n\r\n
    I would say increase the inner margin a little bit, and decrease the outer margin
    by the same amount. I am saying this based on one blog post, which is specifically
    about print-on-demand books. \r\nhttp://www.thebookdesigner.com/2013/08/book-layouts-page-margins/\r\nJoel
    discusses the inner and outer margin toward the end of the post, and explains
    more in his comment with TLynn. You can see if you think it applies to your situation.\r\n\r\nI
    am curious. Does your book have subheadings?"

  body: "@J.Tillman... again, thanks for the suggestions and questions. Interesting
    question about subheadings... in the larger book, yes... will need subheadings
    (and occasionally, sub-subheadings) due to the various \"ingredients\" or tangents
    of an argument... but in the abridged version, I've tried to keep the argument
    \"flowing\" from one thought to another. Below, is a sample chapter from the abridged
    version (it focuses on our mis-understandings of how economics functions, such
    as the creation of money).\r\n\r\nOnce the text is nailed down, in InDesign, will
    create layers for additional formats, such as ebook, etc... I have a suspicion
    that I may use subheadings in an ebook version... (I need to read the EULA for
    Typotheque and FontFont types... I assume, though, I will either need a separate
    license or will have to use different types in the ebook version).\r\n\r\nCheers,
    and again, thanks for the input.\r\n\r\nSample chapter PDF\r\nhttp://ge.tt/69b10AA2/v/0?c"

  body: In your mock up you are using italic on the spine. But when a book stands
    upright on the shelf the eye does not easily read a downward sloping italic, although
    most publishers are blind to this. In France, for example, where the standard
    spine, unlike UK/US, reads bottom to top, italic is fine because the eye is reading
    upwards. Were I President of the Republic, spine text running top to bottom would
    be forbidden, along with such as instant coffee (insult to the coffee bean), white
    chocolate, cricket. Doubtless my head would soon be rolling. At least, in top
    to bottom running spine text, no italic. In addition, I also find loosely spaced
    italic, as on your front cover, undesirable. Loose spacing generally works best
    in caps and small caps.

  body: "Hello, Michael.\r\nI had a quick view on your files.\r\n1. The inner margins
    are very small indeed. I would almost double them. \r\n2. The pictures. You may
    try to set a rule. For example, all pictures will be at the bottom, or top of
    the page. Thus, you'll have a more uniform \"image\". If you think this is too
    difficult, or you don't like the idea, perhaps would help to divide the page into
    horizontal frames and try to set images within those frames/lines and you'll have
    the same height for most of images. \r\nAlso, fig. 1 seems like a neighbor who
    came without invitation. Since the place belongs to it, give it some more space
    from top.\r\n Regarding the fonts, will write tomorrow.\r\n\r\n"
