<div class="post-content e-content" itemprop=articleBody>Does anyone have any recommendations on what versions of Walbaum are the better ones? I'm looking to buy one, and am really enamored of Stormtype's. But I can't find pdf's of anyone else's, and so I was wondering whether they're all the same or if one is considered better. <br> <br>Also, does anyone think it's a bad idea to design a philosophy journal using this font? I really like it -- I was recently drooling over an old copy of Heidegger's <i>Nietzsche</i> that I'm pretty sure was set in it -- but then again I'm not very experienced. (The feedback you guys gave on the newspaper design 6 months ago was helpful so I'm trying again.)</div>

<div class=commentbody>OpenType basically works fine with older and low-end apps. However, you don't get access to the extra goodies, just the basic MacRoman (or WinANSI) character set. <br> <br>There are a couple of exceptions, which do include some older versions of Illustrator (just 6 and 7 I think). See the OpenType readme at <a href=http://www.adobe.com/type/opentype target=_blank>http://www.adobe.com/type/opentype</a> for details. <br> <br>Cheers, <br> <br>T</div>

<div class=commentbody>I think Storm's version is one of the only true text versions of Walbaum. Mr. Shinn's Walburn would complement it nicely as a display, as would the Berthold version (I prefer using the smaller foundries like ShinnType and Storm). If you contact Mr. Storm, he may be willing to supply you with a Type 1 version. <br> <br>-Addison</div>

<div class=commentbody>>Hm, I rather liked that 2 <br> <br>Me too, and it's authentic. However, it's a little strong for some: the Scotsman newspaper used my Walbaum for a while, but had me do them a custom version with the terminal on the 2 changed to a "ball" (similar to on the 6 and 9), and I ballsed up the 3 and 5 also. But they didn't mind the acutely-angled top part of the 3 -- which seems to find favor in the UK more so than elsewhere. </div>

<div class=commentbody>I once got in a heated debate with the art director at the <br><a href=http://www.amnh.org/ target=_blank>American Museum of Natural History</a> about why <br>Walbaum didn't go with <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=catalog.fontdisplay&displayfontid=FK.11103.0.0&packagefontid=0&view=package&searchID=0&searchby=keyword&searchletter=A&searchstr=the%20sans&totalrecords=422&startrow=1&records=20&currpage=1" target=_blank>TheSans</a>.

<div class=commentbody>Nick, do you already opened a book from that period? Mixtures are quite typical and generally wonderful.

<div class=commentbody><i>BTW, the big three of classic Didone/Modern fonts are Didot (French), Bodoni (Italian), and Walbaum (German). Why is there no comparably recognized British face? </i> <br> <br>As JFP notes, Bulmer is probably the closest that British types came to the full-blown Romantic types of the continent, yet it still remains closer to the neo-classical model of Baskerville, and is much less extreme than the Didot or Bodoni types. This isn't surprising, if you consider the cultural and political milieu of Britain at the time, and contrast it with the revolutionary circumstances of the continent. Romanticism in British art and literature never strayed very far from the lyric and retained strong neo-classical elements throughout the 19th century.</div>

<div class=commentbody>>Why is there no comparably recognized British face? <br> <br>It seems to me that there were a great many Didone faces cut in England and Scotland c.1800, that are "reading from the same page" as the well known Continental classics. Perhaps this is why no one in particular stood out. <br> <br>>British art and literature never strayed very far from the lyric <br> <br>Although the UK didn't have a revolution like France, it was on the brink in the early 19th C, and the culture at that time was no less extreme. The national cultures were not isolated, and artists and scientists were very interested in what was happening elsewhere. The Jacobin newspaper "Gazette.." was printed with Baskerville's type, for instance. British culture in the first half on the 19th century was considerably more modernist, and gothic, than it was neo-classical. <br> <br>>quite impossible to mix Fenice <br> <br>Probably, but it's the simplification of serifs (or possibly call it "old style" serifs), most notable on C and S, that connects Walbaum with Fenice, and, to my eye, makes it look so at odds with Bodoni or Didot typefaces. <br> <br></div>
