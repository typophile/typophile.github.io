  was one that I drew in my sketchbook whilst travelling. I wanted to explore what
  would happen if black and white shapes became somewhat disconnected. Counterforms
  are made of perpendicular straight lines while outer edges are wide superellipses.
  \r\n\r\nI wanted to try my hand at Thai glyphs, so added the main alphabetics \u2014
  a few vowels and tone marks are missing for the moment.\r\n\r\nThink there's already
  a font called Argon, so any name suggestions also welcome ;)\r\n\r\nThanks.\r\n\r\nEDIT,
  adding a nice pic![img:sites/default/files/old-images/Argon Colours 588px_4458.jpg]"

    made this!  :-)\r\n\r\nThe main \"global\" concern I think is the optical illusion
    of warping where straights meet rounds, most visible in the \"oh\": look how the
    counter seems to have bulging corners. Now, you might actually want this effect;
    but if you don't it might be tempting to pretend it's not there since it's a bit
    of work to fix, but of course that's weak.\r\n\r\nSpecifics:\r\n- The \"r\" and
    \"w\" are too wide.\r\n- The \"E\" and \"F\" seem too plain; I'd add a shear like
    in the \"f\".\r\n- The diagonal of the \"2\" tapers too much towards the bottom.\r\n\r\nI
    know little about Thai, but it seems nicely NON-Latinized to me. Except for that
    \"w\"-like shape; I wonder if it can be authentically \"twisted\" somehow, like
    you've done so nicely with the \"s\"-like shape.\r\n\r\nName? Retro-futuristic?

  body: "I wondered if you'd notice the changed '\u0E23', Hrant, but of course! Thanks
    for pushing me to reconsider :)\r\n\r\nHm, about the bulging...I can't fully see
    what you mean \u2014 I guess I've been getting used to the shapes so I don't see
    optical difficulties so much. Anyway, I guess either you're seeing the centre
    of each round corner being pulled outwards, or a bump where the straight meets
    the round?\r\n\r\nAgree on r; w I'm not sure for the moment but will see what
    can be done. Are the vertices too wide or the overall width do you think?\r\n\r\n2:
    thanks, I hadn't caught that. I'll take the right side of the join outwards and
    take a bite out of it too. I find 2 pretty much the hardest glyph, apart from
    the section mark.\r\n\r\nE&F: I was considering a Handel-style E and F, but really
    liked the squared forms better. Interesting idea to shear the crossbars, I'll
    try that.\r\n\r\nI'll see what other examples of \u0E1C, \u0E1D, \u0E1E and \u0E1F
    I can dig up from online research!\r\n\r\nGalactica, nice, I'm rather fond of
    that cap G!"

  body: "The bulging is a classic optical issue - like if you attach exact semi-circles
    to the ends of a rectangle it doesn't look smooth - you have to shift the joins.
    But if you like the way it looks as it stands then there's no problem; in fact
    it might give it a nice organic twist in contra to the pervasive rigidity. Just
    be prepared to say \"yeah, I meant to do that\" :-) when certain pesky type designers
    challenge you on it!\r\n\r\nw: I think you might make the center overlap more.\r\n\r\n\u0E1E
    and \u0E1F: Why not curl the left stem outward? Spacing trouble? It could be a
    small curl.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    I wondered if there was also something else at play here though. I'll do the 70:40
    thing and see if that fixes it. Won't be too much work (relative to building a
    whole font!)\r\n\r\nEDIT: Whoops, that was misremembered..."

    hard to tell from that image but the inner counters for the artist's name have
    been modified to a more square form. It creates a very technical impression. Designed
    by Gavillet & Rust.\r\n\r\nIn Frutiger's sans serifs the inner contours are a
    bit squarer than the outer contours.\r\n\r\nFor me your lower case is much more
    successful than the upper case. In the lower case the presence of curved outer
    contours is natural - less so in the capitals."
