    so. Fallback is unique to CSS. No equivalent in print. And the idea of subsetting
    when needed, rather than packing the font with everything under the sun, is sound
    thinking. And the CSS syntax you reference in your link to the W3C Recommendation
    is not simple to grasp. Changing the font-family to reference a special purpose
    font is conceptually much, much easier.\r\n\r\nFurther, if there is any evidence
    that, for even a significant percentage of web designers, small-caps and lining
    numerals are a high priority, I'm certainly open to seeing it.\r\nBut there is
    none that I can see. I don't think the average web designer knows what lining
    numerals are. (I didn't until recently. Of course, if you describe them - \"You
    know, the numbers that kind of go up and down instead of straight across\" - you'll
    probably get a nod of recognition. But the idea of  \"Small-Caps\" as opposed
    to just Caps but sized smaller, I don't think would bring a nod at all. \"You
    mean there's a difference?\" There is no awareness of the distinction.\r\nConsidering
    the other problems web designers face today - the really BIG problems - stuff
    like this is incredibly trivial.\r\n\r\nAs I've said elsewhere, there seems to
    be a meme making the rounds that assumes that, as typographical options become
    more available, web typography will \"grow up\" and begin to resemble typography
    in print.\r\nThis will not happen. In fact, the trend is noticeably the reverse
    - with typography in print more and more resembling web design.\r\n\r\nIn the
    new marketplace for text (even now 40% of fiction is being read on electronic
    devices), \"fine typography\" - meaning fine distinctions of value to an ever
    shrinking pool of cognescenti stripped of influence by the new economic realities
    - are an indulgence that few can afford and few will provide. They are anacronisms.\r\n\r\nThe
    history of the web for the first fifteen years of its existence is living proof
    of this. As is, more recently, the rise of devices like the Kindle, the Nook,
    and the iPad - all of which offer very poor typographic options. Yet demand has
    grown and grown.\r\n\r\nHowever, on the web, color is free. And that's really
    cool. :-)\r\n\r\nAnd why did you guys drop the blink tag? I loved that.\r\n\r\n

    that's already happened. Many web sites use Adobe Flash, or at least they lay
    out their pages with tables, so that the appearance of text is static and controllable,
    instead of reflowing whenever a user changes the width of his browser window and
    being displayed in the user's default typeface.\r\n\r\nIn other respects, yes,
    the flow of stylistic elements is from the medium percieved as \"new\" and \"innovative\"
    to the print medium.\r\n\r\nSo what's likely to happen is:\r\n\r\nAs web browsers
    gain the ability to do everything print can do, this will be made use of, and
    in ways that make use of the experience in the print medium.\r\n\r\nBut web sites
    will continue to be designed for likely computer screen sizes.\r\n\r\nAnd the
    web, as it's new territory, will be a hotbed of stylistic experimentation, and
    so in that area, the flow of ideas will be (to some extent, at least) from the
    web to print."

    Seahawks fan,\r\n\r\nThanks for the CSS3-fonts link. That's a ton of info to digest.
    All of these continual changes and new technology have me wishing at times that
    we could just go back to Rotring pens and Letraset letters. As Dickens said of
    revolution, \"It was the best of times. It was the worst of times...\""
