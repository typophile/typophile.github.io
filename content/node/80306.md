body: I am typesetting a thesis with Berthold Walbaum for the main text (and AkzidenzGrotesk
  for the titles). I need to add some greek and hebrew words in it. For the greek
  font, I noticed the output was not very good until I switched to some didone greek
  font (GFS-bodoni). Now I want to do the same thing with some hebrew words. I am
  aware that I can't really expect some didone-hebrew font, but maybe some very "stable"
  hebrew font would have some better look that some other. Any hint?
