body: "For some reason, every time I open FontExplorer X - or restart my computer
  - it takes me through the setup assistant all over again. Furthermore I no longer
  have my sets, which took me hours to set up. It also no longer starts up automatically,
  nor does it load my fonts when I open a file (I now have to do this manually).\r\n\r\nI
  tried re-downloading the software and re-installing it, but the problem persists.
  I've emailed Linotype but not heard back. Has anybody else had this problem? Or
  any suggestions? If this persists I may have to try another font management software,
  which is a shame because I really like FontExplorer."

    the ability to save your sets somehow. I finally have mine set up in a way that
    makes sense to me and I fear the day something happens to ruin it all.

  body: Like iTunes, which has a separate file containing your playlists. If you need
    to reinstall iTunes you can drag that file out and  replace it afterwards. I'm
    not looking forward to setting up the sets again, I have a lot of fonts and it
    took awhile last time.

    font installed you can make a back-up, albeit a little slow, by dragging the sets
    out onto the desktop. This makes .ZIP files which you can organize and save for
    later."

    managers do this now (they used to give you the option to NOT do it)... it's primarily
    for two reasons: \r\n\r\n1) Speed -- if they know where the fonts are and how
    they're organized, it's faster to find/load 'em\r\n\r\n2) Safety -- By making
    copies of fonts, they aren't going to corrupt your originals; every time your
    system cashes for some reason, there's a chance of corrupting any open font files."

    all my fonts into folders based on my stylistic designations. I then use FontExplorer's
    smart sets to create sets based on the path to the font. it has been working very
    well for me, and I have a nicely organized backup of all my fonts.\r\n\r\nas for
    Suitcase, I dumped it myself. I had nothing but trouble in both QXP and InD with
    it. the primary problem I've noticed was auto-activation, but even without it
    I experienced much more frequent crashes in InD. I prefer to manually activate
    things any way so I know what's going on when I open a doc."

    seems to have resolved itself. I'm sure Suitcase has improved over the years but
    I never liked it back in the day. And now that I know how to save my sets I won't
    have any problems with FEX.

    point.\r\n\r\nI installed FEX (WinXP Pro), decided it wasn't for me and resolved
    to remain with Suitcase despite a few issues I have with it. \r\n\r\nUninstalling
    FEX trashed the majority of older programs on the system (seemingly random fonts
    for apps making them all but unusable). After much hair tearing (and I don't have
    much anyway) and silence on Linotype's behalf, a last ditch attempt to rebuild
    this (system restore failed) was to change my visual theme. Reboot, then change
    it back to what it was. Amazingly this \"so obvious you'd miss it\" idea worked.\r\n\r\nMy
    personal experience of FEX - on XP at least - is that it doesn't seem to be quite
    ready yet. Maybe a reminder to try again in a few months or so.. ;)\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\nsimon\r\n\r\n"
