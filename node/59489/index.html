  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>Following [[http://blog.fontembedding.com/post/2009/06/29/Revised-Web-Fonts-Proposal.aspx|our proposal]] for a Web specific OpenType-based font format (which we named OTW), we received a lot of feedback from type designers, web designers and publishers. Most of the feedback was positive. People saw that differentiating web fonts from desktop fonts, and including licensing information in the font file was a step in the right direction.</p>
<p>Moving the plan forward, we felt that with the support of browser makers we could have OTW standardized within two years, and have the majority of installed browsers supporting it within five to six years, based on current browser upgrade rates.</p>
<p>However, web designers want to use commercial fonts today. They don’t want to wait five or six years. This is evident from the use of Flash-based solutions, and the interest in commercial services like TypeKit. So we took a step back and asked ourselves what can we do to accelerate the rate of adoption? With this in mind we decided to take another look at EOT.</p>
<p>Microsoft’s EOT format has a large installed base and is supported in every version of Internet Explorer since IE version 4. And as IE users are typically the slowest to upgrade, adding EOT support to other browsers would provide a quicker adoption of a single web font standard because the other browsers have much faster upgrade rates. However, we know that the other browser makers don’t like EOT because it includes URL binding, proprietary compression and gives Microsoft a head-start.</p>
<p>With this in mind we propose “EOT Lite”. Essentially EOT minus URL binding and compression, but with the addition of licensing information. The benefits are obvious, EOT Lite fonts will work with IE4 and above, can be easily supported in other browsers, and with their faster upgrade rates, we could see 90% of installed browsers supporting the format within a year. EOT Lite would still have the benefits of OTW: a font file that is differentiated from desktop fonts and containing license information.</p>
<p>In summary, and as a result of a significant dialogue with many stakeholders, we believe EOT Lite is the right solution for web fonts. We encourage everyone to support this solution with us.</p>

<p>Have the other browser makers already been heard about that? I mean, who (beyond Microsoft, of couse) is interested in implementing a support for this format in the next browser versions? Once again, I think it will be crucial for the success or fail of any format.</p>

<p>While I applaud &amp; dream of that kind of adoption rate. How open is the EOT format? Can Microsoft start making selfish changes that will hurt other adopters down the line, one adoption has reached critical mass? I feel that is really the question needing answered. I really don&rsquo;t feel Mozilla/Opera/Google will jump onto a standard Microsoft controls given the track record of the company in the past (regarding to standards).</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I&rsquo;m a little foggy on how previous versions of IE will, with seeming magic, ignore some of the restrictions built into EOT. If this is the case, and it has intrinsic advantages, why doesn&rsquo;t IE support this new lite format already?
And a lack of support for CFF fonts - as John Daggett points out - is so backwards-looking that I have trouble NOT seeing it as a deal-breaker.
I echo his concerns and questions.
I&rsquo;m not saying this is a fudge-job interim solution, but it kind of looks that way at first glance.
It also ignores compression, even as an optional feature.</p>
<p>I think there is patience (albeit limited) among designers and developers as long as it means a dependable, interoperable, long-term solution that isn&rsquo;t going to leave us with the need for yet another format five years down the road.
IMHO.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to hear more before giving any firm feedback.</p>

<p>The EOT <em>format</em> supports CFF OT just fine. But neither WEFT nor IE have yet done so. Unfortunately, nothing anyone does is going to magically get CFF support into old versions of IE. Standardizing on some stripped down EOT gives an option for folks who want to get web fonts working today, and certainly doesn&rsquo;t preclude supporting OT CFF as well.</p>

<p>That will depend on the font and operating system. Lighter weights of sans fonts work pretty well on Mac OS, but bold weights render poorly at small sizes. Hinting will be the next big stumbling block for web fonts: designers are going to go up in arms when they realize how bad the fonts look and blame font designers, but they won’t want to pay for well-hinted screen fonts because so few exist that there’s really no baseline for what they should cost. On the upside, I think many experienced web designers learned to think about legibility issues when nobody could read all those eight-pixel bitmap fonts that were hot in Flash sites a few years back, so hopefully we won’t have to live through two years of godawful unhinted serif faces.</p>

<p>On Mac OS using the system rasterizer, hinting is irrelevant or nearly so.</p>
<p>ClearType is capable of working very nicely with CFF OpenType, as demonstrated by the WPF rasterizer for CFF. But this is hardly mainstream, I guess.</p>
<p><cite>As web fonts take off, is it worth it to try and convince designers to make TTF-flavored OT, with delta hints?</cite></p>
<p>Delta hints are not of much interest for web fonts any more, because most are ignored by ClearType, and all are irgnored by the Mac OS rasterizer. At least, that&rsquo;s my impression. (With the possible exception in ClearType of deltas on Y-direction CVTs rather than directly on points, which could increase x-height at some key sizes or the like.)</p>
<p>I could be mistaken about the degree of uselessness of delta hints, and am open to being corrected.</p>
<p>Note also that regular GDI ClearType is turned on in IE 6 and higher, even when not on at the OS level.</p>

<p>Both Windows and Mac ignore x hints but not y. Delta instructions are ignored on the Mac. Windows only ignores them if they are &lsquo;out of line.&rsquo;  But since deltas can be used in the places other than glyph instructions and in ways other than to disturb the priceless rendering of ClearType, they are neither totally useless nor completely ignored.</p>
<p>Both of these OS have fallen qualitatively behind places like Pre and soon, some other vendors who use FreeType.</p>

<p>Wouldnt CFF fonts look like garbage on the web, since they lack TT hinting?
Most will. But the true garbage time comes when people start using fonts that are not as robust as the few they have now, i.e. hints wouldn&rsquo;t even help.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m still not getting it. At least not easily. And if I&rsquo;m not, then I&rsquo;m assuming a similar reaction from others like me who understand browsers, standards, but are not overly technical with regards to the subtleties and differences betweeen font formats.
What I&rsquo;m hearing is: &ldquo;EOT Lite will give us backward compatibility but yet in some ways it won&rsquo;t.&rdquo;

<p>Unlicensed use of fonts on the internet should be <em>far</em> easier to police than unlicensed use of fonts in printed publications as you can devise a bot to search for them.

<p>No reputable commercial site is going to use unlicensed fonts - and those are the people who will actually pay for fonts. Won&rsquo;t the increased licensing fees for use of fonts on these sites far outweigh decreased sales (if any) from increased piracy?</p>

<p>EOT, in the most simple case, is nothing but a wrapper around a TTF/OTF, more exactly a few header data which are followed by the actual TTF/OTF font data. (Font data <em>can</em> be compressed, or <em>can</em> be modestly obfuscated, but do not need to. Actually it would be easier especially for smaller foundries to do without these two options and just add the header.)
That certain browsers only support one flavor but not the other is hard to understand. If an issue, it is a browser issue rather than a font format issue. As simple as that.</p>
<p>Christopher Fynn &ndash; <cite>Haven’t we lost the plot?</cite></p>
<p>Yes.
Since @font-face is not heavily used yet (is it used at all), it is not too late to agree on supporting only EOT rather than also TTF/OTF. It is be a clean solution, and with information given in the EOT header, services like TypeKit were mostly superfluous.
Discussions &ndash; including on www-style and www-font list &ndash; do not make any sense to me. The funny thing is that my own position has changed thanks to said discussions. Before, I was all for plain TTF/OTF. But web guys' &ldquo;for free&rdquo; and &ldquo;-anti&rdquo; ideology and fabricated arguments showed me how they tick.
The point is that EOT&rsquo;s header info expressly states who may use the font (by URL info as well as by EOT &ldquo;format&rdquo; itself which tells a OS &ldquo;that&rsquo;s not for you&rdquo;) &ndash; which additional information prevents abuse in the first place. No need for policing which I am not particularly fond of.</p>
<p>In so far, I welcome the new proposal.</p>

<p>abattis —  <em>&ldquo;I don’t think so, no, and it seems almost no one does.&quot;</em></p>
<p>Since the advent of the <code>alt.fonts.binary</code> group on Usenet, and now with peer-to-peer file sharing, unlicensed copies of almost every digital font have been easy enough for people to obtain without paying for them. On the internet at least, substantial font piracy may be older than music piracy. It&rsquo;s hard to imagine how TTF / OTF embedding could make the situation substantially any worse.</p>
<p>People who now pay for commercial fonts will continue to pay for them. Those who don&rsquo;t want to pay for commercial fonts, and think they can get away using them without paying, will continue to do so - though using an unlicensed font on a web site would be pretty stupid since it is so likely you&rsquo;ll get found out. A few people will link/embed only FOSS fonts - and that number may grow if commercial vendors continue not to license fonts for web use, or if licensing fees are felt to be too high.</p>

Although I may be able to track unauthorized use online, what particularly concerns me is offline usage, which is presently the bulk of my market.</p>

<p>Well, I don&rsquo;t think we&rsquo;re going to be able to reinvent the web.</p>
<p>Alas, that&rsquo;s a basic functionality of the web. We download code, images, text, and then it&rsquo;s stored on our machine and presented to us in the browser.</p>
<p>I concede that there are ways to make files harder to re-use, but I&rsquo;m still not understanding why we think this is a concern, as the font files are already easily downloadable by those that want in completely unencumbered original formats.</p>
<p>Anyone that would be willing to spend the time fishing files out of their browser&rsquo;s cache would surely be the type of person that already knows how to find the original font files easily anyways, no?</p>

<p>Tool store B doesn&rsquo;t use price tags and they leave all the tools out on the sidewalk.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s fairly easy to steal from store A but only certain kinds of people would do that. They would use the tools with the full knowledge that they are stolen tools. In this example, the</p>

There&rsquo;s no price tag and they&rsquo;re just sitting there. They might assume that it&rsquo;s okay to use those tools since they&rsquo;re not stolen . . . they were sort of found. Some people would assume the unmarked sidewalk tools belong to a store, some wouldn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>The tools are fonts. The price tag is the EULA. I&rsquo;m not saying piracy and stealing are the same thing; they&rsquo;re not.

If someone spotted a drill on the sidewalk with no price tag and picked it up we wouldn&rsquo;t call them a shoplifter.</p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s not about how many paying customers are lost to piracy. That&rsquo;s not the issue. Piracy can&rsquo;t be stopped. If people want to pirate fonts, they can pirate fonts. If you bring that into it, you&rsquo;re clouding the real issue which is: the difference between Store A and Store B. It&rsquo;s not just about how easy it is to get at the fonts. It&rsquo;s about the difference between having to defeat security using a font ripper browser plugin or just straight downloading from a URL.</p>
<p>The EULA, to me is very important. Whatever embedding solutions people come up with, that&rsquo;s the most important factor to me. At the very least, I deserve to be protected by a liability disclaimer, no?</p>

<p>You&rsquo;ve got it about right.
Now, font-makers as a group need to swiftly move towards a consensus and begin to speak - at least publicly - with one voice on this issue.
Those who don&rsquo;t quite understand the technical barriers to unlicensed use need to defer to trusted colleagues who do.
Just as in a labor dispute - say, the Writers Guild of America strike a few years ago that stopped TV and Film production - fragmentation is enemy number one.</p>
<p>(Just my humble opinion. But an informed one.)</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>The Writers Guild is a union right? International screenwriters, like those who work in Britain, France, or Germany, aren&rsquo;t covered, I think. TV didn&rsquo;t stop over here in Europe when the Americans went on strike…</p>
<p>My point is that typeface designers, font developers, and font distributors are a diverse bunch, internationally scattered. Speaking for all of them would be difficult. There isn&rsquo;t a union, in the US or otherwise. The ATypI, which you might be able to call an international trade group, probably cannot speak authoritatively for all of the people who work with type worldwide, even if they would all be members (which is not the case, I suspect).</p>

Everything you say is true.
And I&rsquo;m not saying that everyone should unquestioningly start marching in lockstep.
But there is a common interest among all font-makers everywhere. And, if it is at all possible, from a &ldquo;political&rdquo; and &ldquo;public relations&rdquo; standpoint, a united front would be highly beneficial.
For one reason only: I think it will help bring a speedier resolution of the &ldquo;problem&rdquo; of web fonts to the satisfaction of most stakeholders.</p>
<p>Like I said, just my opinion, but it is based on a lot of hours looking at this issue unfold on a daily basis.</p>
<p>There is a symposium at TypeCon2009 on Sunday the 19th about web fonts. Perhaps some light will be shed there.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>&ldquo;the difference between Store A and Store B&rdquo;</p>
<p>B&amp;M analogies aren&rsquo;t always ideal, but yours is pretty good. However, if I may, I think to fully equate the analogy to web fonts, we need a C option:</p>
<p>store A) commercial tools, but easy to shoplift if one desires. It&rsquo;s also very easy to legitimately purchase quickly and efficiently for those that like to buy their products legitimately.</p>
<p>store B) commercial tools, but difficult to shoplift if one desires. It&rsquo;s also a bit of a pain to purchase products as there are long lines, crowded parking, and that really annoying person that insists that they look in your card and put a smiley face on the receipt before you can leave since they don&rsquo;t trust any of their customers.</p>
<p>free bin C) commercial tools that have been left in boxes out behind the abandoned warehouse for anyone to take that wants them.</p>
<p>I think those into getting software for free for the sake of getting it for free are fully aware of location C and use that most of the time (.ru sites, any number of newsgroups or bittorrent trackers, private file sharing groups, sendspace/yousendit/megadownload/etc). Some of these folks, if they can&rsquo;t find the tool they want at option C will go into store A and sneak it out in their coat.</p>
<p>Which leaves the question: What if Store A didn&rsquo;t exist? What would that group of people do if option C didn&rsquo;t have what they want? I see a few scenarios:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>They&rsquo;d decide that it&rsquo;s not worth the effort to steal from store B and do nothing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>They&rsquo;d be determined to get it anyways and do what it takes to lift it from store B.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>They&rsquo;d decide to pay money legitimately at store B.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>What percentage of people that rarely if ever pay for fonts would fit into each of those 3 groups? I don&rsquo;t know. Does getting rid of option A turn off some legitimate purchasers who no longer will bother as they don&rsquo;t want to deal with the hassle of store B? I don&rsquo;t know that either.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It’s about the difference between having to defeat security using a font ripper browser plugin or just straight downloading from a URL.&rdquo;</p>
<p>IMHO, I don&rsquo;t see a real difference there. In fact, I imagine the &lsquo;font ripper&rsquo; plugin would ultimately be easier to use (&lsquo;STEAL ANY FONTS ON THIS SITE&rsquo; one click vs. VIEW SOURCE -&gt; Find CSS URL -&gt; View CSS -&gt; find @font-face path -&gt; Download font).</p>
<p>Aside from all of that, I do agree that a consensus needs to be formed sooner than later. Something that the type community can present to the W3C as their own proposal as a group.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>James, the W3C is currently considering formalising a standard for a web font format &ndash; or multiple formats &ndash; that will be supported by all browsers. Whatever other solutions are eventually offered by online typesetting services, plug-ins, etc., and which will fare better or worse in the market, we&rsquo;re currently looking at a web font standard à la online graphics or audio formats. This isn&rsquo;t something to be ignored. A couple of days ago, FireFox 3.5 became the latest browser to unilaterally support linking of raw TTF and OTF font files, with nothing to prevent your fonts from being made downloadable from servers all over the net except your license agreement and your own diligence.</p>
<p>Again, I&rsquo;m not expecting anything to be resolved at TypeCon, but I am looking on it as an opportunity to discuss counter proposals for stronger formats, sort out some technical issues, etc. The panel is a chance to present some facts, air some opinions, and establish basic positions. I think the bar and drinks are going to be crucial to what comes next.</p>

<p>About as useful as supporting naked TTF/OTF linking in the other 50%.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m waiting for additional data on browser market share. The page you link to cites a single source for early data. Net Applications are still reviewing June figures.</p>
<hr>
<p>Re. both naked TTF/OTF and EOT Lite: if it ain&rsquo;t compressed, it ain&rsquo;t a real web font format.</p>
<p>Making TTF a web font standard makes as little sense as making TIFF a web graphics standard.</p>

<p>No. We have made clear our position not to license raw TTF and OTF fonts for use with @font-face in websites.</p>
<p>Again, we believe that EOT Lite provides a reasonable solution that addressed the concerns expressed by the other browser makers (by removing the patented font compression and URL binding parts of EOT).</p>
<p>We are offering web designers a solution that can be implemented today in IE, and hopefully in the not too distant future in the other browsers. We will do everything we can to encourage adoption of EOT Lite by other type designers/foundries, and by the browser makers.</p>
<p>As to John&rsquo;s comments about compression, as others have pointed out, there are ways to compress EOT fonts at the server.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I agree that EOT Lite successfully removes anything browser vendors might reasonably object to. But does it also remove something font vendors might reasonably insist on?</p>
<p>Mind you, if what one is selling is the EOT files themselves, the vendor can put real customer info or at least a customer-specific serial number right in the font. This is a bit different than the EOT model we were envisioning when I was at Adobe, which was that we&rsquo;d just let the customer do the EOT conversion themselves. But with EOT Lite the vendor might have more reason not to allow that.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s hard to comment much on Ascender&rsquo;s approach without knowing more about the license model / fee structure. Once that&rsquo;s public, there will be more to discuss.</p>

<p>&hellip;right you are! and in addition, this (licensing, we are not selling yet), can be done with the evil &ldquo;raw&rdquo; OT font&hellip; and in addition, the file name can be changed with no adverse effects. This is <em>not</em> a long-term replacement for the PERM, however, which must be implemented before &lsquo;client-unseen&rsquo; licensing can commence.</p>

<p>Which is great. But note that most web developers don&rsquo;t give much thought to IE in terms of going out of the way to enhance things. IE has become the &lsquo;weird cousin&rsquo; that you are still obligated to invite to all your birthday parties but do so reluctantly.</p>
<p>It does seem like we&rsquo;ve hit some apex of momentum with @font-face options and products and conversations, though. Nice to see. Hopefully some form of solution that most can agree upon will surface by end of year.</p>

<p>I have spoken to Kent Lew about this. If all are agreeable, I&rsquo;ve got a Sony Hi-Def camera and tri-pod with me at TypeCon
and will gladly volunteer to record the event, no strings attached, claiming no rights. But, of course, it&rsquo;s up to others to decide if this is appropriate and OK with them.</p>
<p>@billdavis</p>
<p>At TypeCon, hoping you&rsquo;ve got fairly firm answers on pricing, etc&hellip; 
And how about those who just want to continue to process, say, Cambria, out of the Windows Fonts folder using Weft?
Are you now looking for license money for this?
Will the same tools as are made available to font-makers be freely available to anybody?</p>

<p>I am quite sure I saw Håkon say that, and some folks agree. But the main question in my mind was whether John Daggett (Mozilla/Firefox) was in that camp. I don&rsquo;t recall seeing him say so. Do you have a reference or recollection?</p>

<p>We have been working hard on web fonts for a long time.</p>
<p>We respect Microsoft and certainly appreciate their unwavering support for the font community over many years; not just Ascender.</p>
<p>Any solution that requires Microsoft to switch from EOT will take three to four years to reach a critical mass of browser (yes IE) users and anything resembling cross-browser compatibility with therefore take that long. You are probably so busy doing other things that you were unaware of this.</p>
<p>Mozilla objected to two things about EOT, to our knowledge. We have merely suggested removing those two things from EOT (and still feel we have a reasonable solution). Not exactly an &lsquo;in bed with Microsoft&rsquo; approach.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Bill, anyone who would engage in typographic debate without occasional sarcasm would – what is the term? – steal sheep.</p>
<p>IE users aren’t the ones who are clamoring for Web fonts, if anyone is. They’re Macintosh supremacists. IE support will not matter in the slightest to the majority of early and mid-term adopters of Web fonts.</p>
<p>Now, while you were busy with other things, you probably failed to recognize that these designers have to get their sites up and running to their satisfaction <em>on their own machines</em> before they worry about anybody else’s. (We’ll exclude the tag-soup problem for a moment. Many Web-font proponents are leading standardistas.) Hence even if you contend, as I expect you would were you offered a day, just one little day, without an iota of sarcasm, that Macintosh-wielding Web designers are a tiny minority compared to the teeming mass of IE users, the fact remains that Web designers <em>are the market for Web fonts</em>. You have to satisfy their needs first. You may be accustomed to satisfying some other entity’s first.</p>

<p>Web pages are not made for web designers, Mac supremacists or not. Web pages are made for visitors, and if a company cares enough about the visual appearance of their web presence to want specific fonts on one browser they will care enough to want them on all browsers. This isn&rsquo;t about the computer platform being used by early adopters of served typography, it is about the web presence of their customers.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Bill: <em>&hellip;where do you think that leaves the other initiatives&hellip;</em></p>
<p>Very much on the table, especially .webfont and ZOT.</p>
<p>We didn&rsquo;t talk about ZOT during the TypeCon panel, but it is a serious contender for an interoperable web font format. It&rsquo;s probably the simplest of the options being considered, but isn&rsquo;t as flexible as .webfont because, like EOT, it is very OpenType-focused, whereas the wrapper model of .webfont could be applied to other kinds of font data in future.</p>
<p>ZOT applies compression to individual OpenType tables, rather than compressing the whole font as in .webfont. ZOT contains much less extra-font metadata than either .webfont or EOT/-Lite. ZOT was proposed by Jonathan Kew, who used to work for SIL where he developed the brilliant XeTeX page layout program, and who now works for Mozilla.</p>
<p>David&rsquo;s perm table idea, like FontLab&rsquo;s EEULAA table, is orthogonal to the web font format discussion: anything that resides in the font data itself will be included within any web font wrapper. Regardless of what wins out as the interoperable web font format, the idea of license permissions, serialisation and other kinds of customised metadata in the font seems to be an idea whose time has come; indeed, whose time came some time ago!</p>
<p>Peter Biľak&rsquo;s approach seems to me a hack and a short term solution in response to the current situation. I don&rsquo;t think it is a viable web font format for the long term, and I doubt if Peter thinks of it as such. It should be noted that he supports the .webfont proposal.</p>
<hr>
<p>Chris, John Daggett&rsquo;s opposition to anything EOT-related does seem pretty fixed. If he hasn&rsquo;t said &lsquo;No&rsquo; in so many words, he has certainly said it in as many other ways as possible. I don&rsquo;t take this to mean that it is impossible that Mozilla will support EOT Lite, only that if they do it will be grudgingly and probably only after a lot of fighting.</p>
<p>Interestingly, the people on the W3C list who are now putting most pressure on Mozilla and Opera to support EOT Lite are web developers who want a format that provides immediate support to millions of users via various versions of IE and which will be backwards compatible, and who don&rsquo;t want to wait for a new format to be standardised.</p>

<p>Acutally this is well in line with Mozilla&rsquo;s attempt to push ZOT. Mozilla/Opera argue that metadata could be placed in a normal font table, which is what both PERM and EEULAA are far as I understand.</p>
<p><cite>Peter Biľak’s approach seems to me a hack and a short term solution in response to the current situation.</cite></p>
<p>I would not call it a hack. It is a service, like WebKit is. It implies more than just the technical aspect of font linking, it also covers choosing and licensing fonts. I assume that if EOT Lite or .webfont or ZOT or whatever else someone will come up with has been implemented, these services will switch to the &ldquo;safer&rdquo; font formats &ndash; without loosing their service legitimation.</p>

<p>As far as Mozilla&rsquo;s opinion, I haven&rsquo;t seen a firm &ldquo;no&rdquo; regarding the new EOT.
Would they rather not do it? That certainly seems to be the case.
What I&rsquo;ve seen so far are preferences dressed up as arguments, and fairly exposed as such.
It&rsquo;s time to put the F back in WTF.
I&rsquo;m not so sure they&rsquo;re ready to deny the web developer/design community Web Fonts for at least an additional 5 years (if not forever), over a refusal to treat a file with an .EOT extension as if it had an .TTF extension, which is, essentially, all that is being asked of them.
Indeed, at least Robert Callahan has said he would like input from the web design community.
The new EOT, EOT Lite, has been in existence for less than fours weeks!</p>
<p>Cheers,</p>
<p>rich</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Karsten: <em>I would not call it a hack. It is a service, like WebKit is.</em></p>
<p>I was referring to what I understand to be the served format and the mechanism used to obfuscate the font and prevent it from being installed as a desktop font. As I understand it, this involves deliberately corrupting the name table, which is why I characterise it as a hack: something contrary to the font specification.</p>
<p>I agree that the Typotheque service is just that, a service à la Typekit and Kernest, and the served format is irrelevant to that and, hence, the service is orthogonal to the format debate.</p>

Perhaps, since in this context a font is not (supposed to be) installed on a local computer, these hacks are acceptable. Perhaps acceptable even within .webfont, .eot or .zot whose file suffixes signal that these are web fonts. Not acceptable though if these hacks were applied to .ttf or .otf &ldquo;web fonts&rdquo; delivered to customers since these miss a &ldquo;no desktop font&rdquo; flag.</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Richard: <em>The new EOT, EOT Lite, has been in existence for less than fours weeks!</em></p>
<p>And Firefox 3.5 has been out for less time than that, supporting naked font linking. If you could guarantee that the outcome of a longer process would be Mozilla support for EOT Lite and definitely <em>not</em> IE support for naked font linking, then I think font makers would be less of a rush to see something like .webfont or ZOT embraced as a single interoperable format.</p>
<p>If naked font linking is taken off the table as an interoperable format, I don&rsquo;t much care which other format wins out in the long run so long as it contains the minimal level of protection against casual misuse that the majority of font makers have indicated they would accept. EOT Lite isn&rsquo;t going to go away, and Ascender&rsquo;s strategy seems a good one: make EOT Lite a significant presence in the market with the benefit of backwards compatibility and major foundries licensing for and providing web fonts in the format. Frankly, I&rsquo;m not sure that Ascender would want EOT Lite to become the subject of a W3C working group, as they might get more mileage out of establishing it as a de facto standard rather than working to make it a de jure standard.</p>
<p>Back when this debate started with Opera&rsquo;s support for naked font linking, Håkon Lie had the idea of letting the market determine the format, thinking that naked font linking would win out because of the relative ease it offers to browsers and web authors. I think he badly underestimated both the resistance of the foundries and also of our bigger customers, who want a format that protects their own font IP. He also didn&rsquo;t anticipate EOT Lite, which &ndash; credit to Ascender &ndash; has completely changed the nature of the debate and put the non-IE browsers on the defensive. Now you, and I anticipate other web designers and publishers, are pressing that advantage and I think this is a good thing.</p>
<p>Today, if the market were allowed to determine the format, I strongly suspect that EOT Lite would be the eventual winner. What I&rsquo;m not willing to accept, though, is that we might end up with multiple interoperable formats <em>including naked font linking.</em> This is why a commitment from browser makers to a different interoperable format such as .webfont or ZOT, acceptable to everyone on both technical and political grounds, is attractive to me: the non-IE browsers get to duck out of supporting EOT Lite in return for accepting that naked font linking is dead-in-the-water.</p>
<p>I suppose much depends on how likely one considers it that the non-IE browsers, and Mozilla in particular, will cave and support EOT Lite <em>without any reciprocal agreement from MS to support naked font linking.</em> This is, I suspect, where the interests of font makers and the interests of web designers diverge: because while web designers might want EOT Lite on the basis of its backwards compatibility, they don&rsquo;t really care whether naked font linking also becomes interoperable, whereas font makers and some of our customers care very much indeed. If web designers and authors such as yourself want font makers to stick with you in demanding cross-browser support for EOT Lite, rather than letting the non-IE browsers opt for .webfont or ZOT instead, you need to make at least a strategic commitment to rejecting naked font linking. A quid pro quo alliance between font makers and web designers supporting EOT Lite is certainly possible.</p>
<hr>
<p>PS. I&rsquo;ve read Robert Callahan&rsquo;s contributions to the W3C list, but I don&rsquo;t know who he is or what his stake in this is. Can you enlighten me, Richard?</p>

<p>I’ve seen that as well on some machines running the latest FF 3.5 (not a beta). No idea!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Search previous threads on &lsquo;vertical metrics&rsquo; or &ldquo;chopped off&rdquo;.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>you could say that alignment zones and stem hints are fundamental to the digital graphic culture we now have&hellip;
Nick&hellip; I and other designers want to add the intra and inter glyph white-space to that fundamental list to make possible an end to typographic &ldquo;x abuse&rdquo; (we see a lot in this site). But the two main owners of TT/OT think the list is long enough at 2 things, alignment zones and &lsquo;page color&rsquo;. And though ISO, the web&rsquo;s users, and I &lsquo;want it&rsquo; otherwise, &ldquo;type scaling&rdquo; is set up that way by MS and Apple. Though all of the technology to handle readable web type exists, basically &ldquo;it&rsquo;s resolution&rsquo;s fault&rdquo;  that you can barely ever have optimal quality for your needs.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Then, One could say that this web site&rsquo;s apparent use of @font-face suffers from low resolution typographic x abuse the site developer has absolutely no control over with these or most outline fonts, now or ever.* And the site suffers @font-face abuse from the user&rsquo;s perspective. I.E. the definition of the top 3/4 of the page as 2 assets, for the foreseeable future, does the user absolutely no good in transmission speed, and may in fact end up with that lovely script text appearing as Verdana, likely doing the publisher of the website nearly no good. Render unto pixels, that which is their due.</p>
<p>That covers text and display type on this type. But the sub heads, they are very nice and I like the color scheme.</p>
<p>@Hudson&gt; This is, as Si Daniels put it, the ’elephant in the room’ that no one is talking about.</p>
<p>Thanks John for repeating a not entirely completely untrue statement. Since 2004 when the final hinting/fontformat/OS environment was being described for its eventual 2007 release from Longhorn into Vista, I and quite a few others have never called this issue an elephant in the room. ;)</p>
<p>Otherwise, &ldquo;web text readability&rdquo; has been a rather huge topic here and elsewhere. Search on that instead of &lsquo;elephant&rsquo; if anyone is interested. The fact that learned type people are supposing an emergency availability situation, and are supporting a new font format to utterly exacerbate the beast raw into a naked and raging elephant, is what surprises me.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The so-called ’web safe’ fonts like Verdana,</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&hellip;are, as John correctly points out, safe by availability and by contour design, and at 13ppx Verdana is particularly safe because it was drawn to fit that size, (delete the hints and it works about the same at 13, when anti-aliased). But mostly, web safe fonts are safe simply from their original selection as part of a class of published digital outlines to accompany everything; as Courier, Times and Helvetica (et al), are familiar enough for users to &ldquo;fill in the blur&rdquo; of the bad sizes, they  just barely work. While Verdana et al are by contour design, made to minimize the blur by maximizing critical font-wide type design features, also in familiar forms people are used to.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&hellip;I’m cooking something up to help web typographers with that&hellip;.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I call help, &lsquo;recommendations&rsquo;. When taken from groups of fonts, a data-base of recommendations will provide a web typographer with a &lsquo;ball park&rsquo; to start testing, or just go with the recommndation, for any particular use. I&rsquo;d love to see what you cook up but people think adding this meta data to the OT font specification is the quickest and only way to begin addressing web text readability education on the scale required.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&hellip;Microsoft needs to rethink how it helps type designers with designing fonts</p>
</blockquote>
<p>See what happened on this forum when I quested for a clear cleartype specification in &lsquo;05? Search on &ldquo;giant pile of excrement&rdquo;, as far as I recall.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I realize that there are some strong arguments in favor of manually-hinted TrueType fonts with deltas for different sizes&hellip;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You must mean Variations for different sizes. :) Deltas, they may be, that term has been demonized to an evil size-specific blot. Search on &ldquo;Superpolator&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cheers!</p>
<p>*Unless e.g. you set your OT/@FF-friendly browser&rsquo;s text size to medium, then go to: 
<a href="http://www.fontbureau.com/test/franky/">http://www.fontbureau.com/test/franky/</a>
&hellip;there you can futz with the site&rsquo;s typographic size and weight controls outside of the evil grip of everyone but me and some of my crazy ideas for &ldquo;elephant training.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Remember, set your OT/@FF-friendly browser&rsquo;s text size to medium, set your OT/@FF-friendly browser&rsquo;s text size to medium. Don&rsquo;t forget, set your OT/@FF-friendly browser&rsquo;s text size to medium.</p>
<p>Also: You can steal these fonts now if it suits you. Or you can wait, and steal better ones later. Or you can wait until the new font wrapper everyone is so hot for, is thoroughly undressed by time as it surely must be to be accepted, and then you can steal these fonts from that format. See!? Lots of choices! Sorry for the L.P.</p>

<p>This is a false choice, John. What is <strong>your</strong> approach guaranteeing? Nothing. None of us can guarantee any outcome at all on anything in these discussions. All you can do is approach things as smartly as you can.</p>
<p>Hakon Wium Lie would agree that the .fonts-from-the-moon proposal was fine with him as long as it moved the conversation past EOT. I don&rsquo;t say this to disrespect him, it&rsquo;s just in keeping with his previous statements on the subject and his own theatrical style. I can&rsquo;t help it if he goes about things as an actor playing a role, he just does.</p>
<p>Lie and, to a lessor extent, the guys from FireFox have made it clear they want to support linking to raw files and nothing more. What commitment have you gotten to make you think that&rsquo;s changed? Just because they&rsquo;ll kick around some alternatives with you in on online mailing list?</p>
<p>Look, if you&rsquo;re willing to punt this down the road an extra five years, what&rsquo;s the all-fired rush?</p>
<p>Whatever you feel you are, today, &ldquo;working out&rdquo; will be killed in the cradle. The nit-picking is already beginning in the .ZOT versus .webfonts proposal conversations.</p>
<p>Further, font-producers are not the only stakeholders here John.
Copyright is granted by the public, it&rsquo;s not a divine right.
You give a damn about protecting your fonts and I give a damn about being able to use them. I&rsquo;ll have my say, too, and so should the web development community at large.
Evaluation takes time.
I think you are also underestimating the amount of communication and influence that can be exerted behind the scenes by players to whom we are dwarfs.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s just how I see it.</p>

<p>No, I&rsquo;m asking for a commitment in the form of a W3C working group. John Daggett from Mozilla has suggested an informal, ad hoc group to work out the details. I&rsquo;m not satisfied with that, for the reasons you suggest. I want a formal W3C working group with a specific mandate.</p>
<p>In case I have not been clear: I think it is great that you are putting pressure on these browser makers, and if you can get more web authors and designers to do likewise, so much the better. Mozilla and Opera are being disingenuous about EOT Lite, and they deserve to be called on this, as you and Microsoft are doing. My name still isn&rsquo;t on the list of foundries supporting .webfont, and I still think EOT Lite is the stronger option. I&rsquo;m also aware, though, that a great many of my colleagues support .webfont and would might be willing to support ZOT, and as one of the more vocal participants I feel an obligation to fairly represent that perspective.</p>
<p>A little while ago, you were <em>urgently</em> encouraging font makers to organise and negotiate collectively. To a large extent, this is what is now happening, and you&rsquo;re suddenly asking us what is the rush.</p>

<p>Urgent to choose representatives and a strategy, NOT urgent to start entertaining any notion anybody seems like they want to talk about. (I&rsquo;m overstating, I know.) Glad to hear you are hanging tough on the Working Group. I don&rsquo;t know if that binds anybody to anything, but at least it&rsquo;s concrete.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s what I propose, along with my reasons:</p>
<p>The new EOT changed everything. I was taken totally by surprise when it first showed up. At first, I thought it was some kind of negotiating gimmick. (I really did.) It took me about a week to accept it as real and understand the ramifications.
It&rsquo;s huge. And Ascender and Monotype are already signed on. I assume Adobe will follow.</p>
<p>Organizing and lobbying collectively is the strongest way to go. A group of about three to four spokespeople  - two main reps and one to two alternates who have credibility and respect.
Otherwise the entire font community will get chopped apart. The font guy who expects the least will always be held up as the poster child.
&ldquo;Hey, it&rsquo;s OK with <strong>him</strong>&rdquo;, they&rsquo;ll say, &ldquo;Why not you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now, in fonts there&rsquo;s no central organization with legal authority along the lines of, say, the Writer&rsquo;s Guild.
But there is SOTA. There is AtypI. I think it&rsquo;s time for the top people at those organizations to get political.
If now isn&rsquo;t the time, when is?</p>
<p>There are membership lists aren&rsquo;t there? How long does it take to solicit nominations and take a final vote? A week? Two at the most. This is a highly special circumstance calling for special measures. While the final reps are being chosen, the presidents or boards of those organizations should, indeed, must appoint provisional reps.
(There&rsquo;s this thing called the Internet that can be most helpful with stuff like this. Crappy fonts, but for getting things done fast, it&rsquo;s the bees knees.)</p>
<p>A thread about the selection process  - for questions and comments - should be started right here on Typophile.</p>
<p>Who&rsquo;s running SOTA right now? I know there&rsquo;s a changing of the guard taking place soon but I&rsquo;m assuming the same folks from Atlanta are still in place. True? Not true? Tammy, Kent, are you there?</p>
<p>I know next to nothing about AtypI, who&rsquo;s running the show there?</p>
<p>John, so far, on the W3C mailing list, you&rsquo;ve been the de facto industry representative. Except for Karsten, I think you&rsquo;ve been the only professional font-producer talking. And I do give you credit for trying to take the bull by the horns. (And there has been a lot of bull, eh?)
But you can&rsquo;t, nor should you do it alone.
Obviously Tal and Erik have lobbied for their .webfont proposal which they feel strongly about and it&rsquo;s a serious proposal.
The problem is, EOT is working code on hundreds of millions of machines. Support for it would provide such profound benefits in such a short time that pushing it out front is a no brainer. Would Tal and Erik be willing to hold their fire for the greater good? (With the understanding that their proposal will be given the airing it is due once the status of the new EOT is decided?)
Don&rsquo;t know. I&rsquo;m sure they&rsquo;ll make their views known.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think the reps should be any of the &ldquo;big dogs&rdquo;. Adobe, Monotype, MSFT, can speak for themselves.</p>
<p>As a member of SOTA, (full, not the cheapie student membership) I nominate you, John, to be one of the representatives. Provisional and permanent. You have a command of the technical issues, the verbal chops, and, obviously, the motivation.</p>
<p>Also, as a member of SOTA, I&rsquo;m making a motion that no later than five days from now, all the recipients of the W3C Web Fonts mailing list, as well as any other concerned parties that may be identified, be formally notified of SOTA&rsquo;s intentions to present a group of representatives formally charged with representing the interests of SOTA&rsquo;s membership in dealings with browser makers and web-standards bodies.</p>
<p>Who seconds this?</p>
<p>(BTW - is there a place on SOTA&rsquo;s site for stuff like this, or should we just do a thread here?)</p>
<p>How does this sound to everybody? Anybody? Speak, please.</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>rich</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Richard, neither SoTA nor ATypI is an organisation representing professional font makers, and the fact that you, not a professional font maker, are able to become a full member of SoTA should make that fact obvious. These are organisations that put on conferences devoted to typographic design. It is not their mandate to represent font makers as you suggest, and I think you will find a lot of font makers objecting very strongly to your presumption.</p>
<p>These issues are being very actively discussed in the professional type design community. Large numbers of us are in daily contact, and I think the views of the community are being expressed. There isn&rsquo;t a uniform position, but there is a high level of understanding of the issues, and a responsiveness to the changing situation. A more formal representation is possible, and will likely happen in the case of a working group. What you might expect in that case is a list of font makers and vendors endorsing representatives and policies. The constitution of that list will be a better measure of the validity of the representation than the arbitrary membership of organisations such as SoTA and ATypI.</p>

<p><cite>Dagget didn’t say no explicitly, but he’s trying to reject anything that smells like Microsoft (as someone said here), giving nonsense excuses without analyzing it.</cite></p>
<p>Sorry if there&rsquo;s something I didn&rsquo;t explain with sufficient rigor.  What exactly are you referring to?</p>
<p>This is not simply me trying to malign anything coming from Microsoft, I just don&rsquo;t see EOT-Lite as a very good proposal, mainly because it&rsquo;s taking an  API from an existing product and using it to define the behavior for a standard. ZOT seems to me like it provides better obfuscation and is more efficient and the .webfont proposal makes the license details more evident to anyone poking around with the font file.</p>
<p>The advantage of EOT-Lite over new formats is that it gives some form of backwards compatibility with IE6, IE7 and IE8 which supported EOT-formatted TTF fonts, so authors would only need to use one version of a font to get some form of cross-browser support.  No version of IE loads EOT-formatted CFF fonts, so this isn&rsquo;t really an advantage for CFF-only font vendors like Adobe or Hoefler &amp; Frere-Jones.</p>
<p>In some sense it boils down to whether the advantages of having a better format outweigh the disadvantages of web authors having to support two font formats to fully support previous versions of IE (i.e. new format plus EOT).</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p><cite> &gt; Now, in fonts there’s no central organization with legal authority along the lines of, say, the Writer’s Guild. But there is SOTA. There is AtypI. I think it’s time for the top people at those organizations to get political.</cite></p>
<p>Rich &ndash; I have heard your frequent call for some kind of single representative voice for the type &ldquo;industry.&rdquo; And I don&rsquo;t necessarily disagree with the sentiments, instincts, or passion behind this call.</p>
<p>With all due respect, however: in directing your call toward SOTA, I&rsquo;m afraid you&rsquo;ve misunderstood the nature of the organization. As has been previously stated, SOTA is not, and does not purport to be, representative of the &ldquo;industry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I can understand why, because of recent visibility of SOTA and its annual conference, one might look to this organization as a potential for collective representation, but I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s a proper fit.</p>
<p>The SOTA board, which you can see at Christopher&rsquo;s link above, is currently composed of 12 part-time volunteers, seven of whom are basically self-employed individuals. Two are full-time educators. And three members happen to work for larger font-related companies (but none are on the board as representatives of these corporations). By my reckoning, only five members are published type designers (three of whom are ending their terms next month).</p>
<p>The membership of SOTA is essentially a club, not a professional organization. I think &ldquo;Typographic Aficionados&rdquo; says it all. The current membership numbers 38 non-student members. Of those, as near as I can tell, about 17 are type designers or otherwise directly involved in the font development business (and this number includes the board members cited above).</p>
<p>Speaking purely personally, I do not think SOTA is a position &ndash; organizationally, constitutionally, or resource-wise &ndash; to become a political voice for the industry. I think SOTA can and should campaign for and provide opportunities for public and community awareness. But I don&rsquo;t think that political representation or advocacy fall within its purview.</p>
<p>While SOTA enjoys good, close relations with, and widespread support from, much of the professional type community, I doubt any majority of that professional community would be willing to grant SOTA any political authority to advocate on its behalf.</p>
<p>To be clear: these are my personal views. I am not speaking for SOTA, and I am one of those whose board term is ending.</p>

<p>Without having as yet read any of the posts subsequent to my last suggestion, I have been advised by email that what I am suggesting will not bear fruit.
I am taking that advice. I tossed out an idea - a possible way of approaching the problem. Even if the consensus is that it&rsquo;s a dumb idea, I hope that it at least provides food for thought because the problem still remains.
I will continue to be a booster for the new EOT because it promises the most in the shortest amount of time.
Every profession has it&rsquo;s own internal dynamics, and not being a font-producer myself (although you never know!), I do not presume to tell anybody how to run their professional lives.</p>

<p>You can read about their purpose here: <a href="http://www.atypi.org/05_About_us">http://www.atypi.org/05_About_us</a></p>
<p>And you can also download a PDF of their current governing statutes, where I direct your attention to Article 2, (a)-(d). You&rsquo;ll also find that their membership is an actual voting body.</p>
<p>I think ATypI is more constitutionally disposed to the kind of unified, &ldquo;industry&rdquo; advocacy that you urge. Although, I suppose that they may face similar organizational and resource challenges.</p>
<p>I believe that Tom Phinney and Si Daniels are the two ATypI board members who participate on Typophile most frequently.</p>

<p>I understand that ZOT can be even more sofisticated and I apreciate Erik and Tal&rsquo;s efforts on the .webfont proposal. IMO, all that proposals look good for type designers/vendors. But tell me, what is the big deal in supporting multiple formats in the next FF versions? I mean, multiple formats was never a problem on www. You din&rsquo;t have any problem in supporting naked font linking on FF3.5 without any protection (and sorry, the type comunity did&rsquo;nt like that idea). Supporting EOT Lite AND ZOT can be a way to let foundries, web designers and authors chose what is the best for them.</p>

		<div class="commentbody">Kent, I don&rsquo;t think ATypI is any more representative of font makers than SoTA, despite its origins as an industrial cartel and its impressive looking statutes. Like SoTA, ATypI has an open membership policy, which means than anyone interested in type is permitted and encouraged to join the association: type designers, font makers and font vendors, yes, but also graphic designers, teachers, students, afficionados, etc. As a basic rule of thumb, I&rsquo;d say that an association cannot claim to represent a profession if its voting membership contains both members of that profession <em>and their customers.</em> It would be like saying that an association open to everyone who has teeth represents the dental profession.</div>

<p>Its not clear yet what Microsoft intend to do with regard to implementation problems that they have described as &lsquo;bugs&rsquo;. Knowing how MS tracks and addresses bugs, a hotfix is always an option for a critical bug. Of course, what makes a bug critical is the user base and the potential impact &ndash; both the negative impact of the bug <em>and the positive impact of fixing it</em> &ndash; and this means that a bug that wasn&rsquo;t critical for the past ten years might suddenly become critical today.</p>
<p>Personally, if I were MS, I would be doing everything possible to undermine your rejection of an EOT-derived solution, including hotfixing IE back to version 6.</p>
<p>A little over a week ago, I expressed to Ascender what I thought they would need to do to get other font makers to support and license fonts for EOT Lite . Our concerns about EOT &ndash; beyond the weakness of the protections it offered, which we now realise were stronger than anything else we&rsquo;re going to get the non-IE browsers to agree to &ndash; were mainly around poor tool support and the awkwardness of building .eot generation into our existing mastering and delivery workflows. Tal and Erik&rsquo;s .webfont format was specifically designed to avoid such problems, which is one of the reasons why it was so enthusiastically supported by font makers. As I told Ascender, if they wanted font makers to sign up to EOT Lite, they would need to address the tool issue in a way that makes .eot creation as easy for foundries as .webfont creation. Less than a week later, I&rsquo;m beta testing that tool, so I think the will to make EOT Lite a serious contender is definitely there.</p>
<p><em>In some sense it boils down to whether the advantages of having a better format outweigh the disadvantages of web authors having to support two font formats to fully support previous versions of IE (i.e. new format plus EOT).</em></p>
<p>I&rsquo;d agree with that, but obviously the analysis changes if EOT Lite becomes better. Which is why it is in Microsoft&rsquo;s interest to hotfix their bugs.</p>

<p>John, you&rsquo;re leaving out a big advantage of EOT Lite: It&rsquo;s already out there. I realize it was Ascender&rsquo;s gambit all along to push it out into the world as aggressively as they have, but it&rsquo;s there, nevertheless.</p>
<p>To describe is as &ldquo;taking an API from an existing product and using it to define the behavior for a standard&rdquo; might be a well-intentioned description on your part, but it seems contrived from my POV. We&rsquo;re talking about a fairly simple and open font wrapper. It&rsquo;s easily understood, anyone can create them, and it contains enough protection to satisfy most foundries (I think). I am just not getting why you see it as such a completely different animal from webfont or ZOT.</p>
<p>There are potential problems with it working with CFF, but Microsoft has motivation to address them. Obviously we&rsquo;re looking at that very carefully.</p>
<p>My point is not to tell you that we should end the debate right here and pick EOT Lite&hellip; I&rsquo;m just not convinced by your (and others') reasons for taking it off the table so quickly. It still looks like a reasonable contender to me.</p>

<p>We should notice that the .webfont proposal (by Erik and Tal) are also supported by very respected foundries around the globe and, despite the passions involved, I still think that it&rsquo;s not an either/or situation. Multiple solutions can live in peace together, bacause most of the type designers/vendors interests are not so different, I think. All of us want to find a way to protect our font IDs, so we can still provide high quality products, feed our families and pay our bills. ;)</p>

&ldquo;<em>No version of IE loads EOT-formatted CFF fonts, so this isn’t really an advantage for CFF-only font vendors like Adobe or Hoefler &amp; Frere-Jones.</em>&rdquo;</p>
<p>Just to key in on this part of your post:
First, the statement is incorrect. The set of fonts that Adobe markets for web use, <a href="http://store1.adobe.com/cfusion/store/html/index.cfm?store=OLS-US&event=displayFontPackage&code=1507">Web Fonts Pack</a> are TTF. (A bargain at $69.99! Although I can&rsquo;t, today, post them on a web server in raw form.) In other words, Adobe seems quite willing to adapt it&rsquo;s product line to the realities of the market. To characterize any font-producer as &ldquo;CFF-only&rdquo;, as if they are hand-cuffed and would not fall all over themselves to offer TTF or EOT versions of their fonts should a demand develop, is preposterous. OTF&rsquo;s are being converted to TTF&rsquo;s and EOT&rsquo;s for use on the web as I write. You know this.
Second, in what way, shape, or form is this an appopriate or even a wise criteria upon which to decide whether to support one file format or another? Browsers are conduits - everyone using that conduit must adapt to it, or back away.
Because of FireFox and Safari&rsquo;s raw-only support for font-linking, the problem we have today is that vendors ARE backing away.
And I must say, this is exactly the kind of argument I spoke of in my previous post. Now, Adobe and H&amp;FJ are being held up as the &ldquo;poster children&rdquo; whose interests you are out to protect. If you were to ask them, I&rsquo;m sure they&rsquo;d say their interests would be best protected by FireFox immediately issuing a patch that 1) disables raw font linking 2) enables EOT.
How about that? Is that going to happen?</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>rich</p>

<p>Why is this a problem? What harm or damage results? I don&rsquo;t know what went on in the early browser wars between Netscape and Internet Explorer, but I don&rsquo;t think Microsoft ever had any problems with adopting good ideas from others, to say the least. Here if a kernel of EOT&ndash;now modified&ndash;is a quick and satisfactory way to get fonts on the web, why not support it? Going forward, the code is not going to be proprietary to any company, I gather, so what&rsquo;s the issue?</p>
<p>Also a factor you don&rsquo;t discuss, is the speed at which all this can happen. This is important both to benefit internet users, and for the font business. I don&rsquo;t know the technical issues, but if a satisfactory solution can be implemented in a year, and a slightly better one will take five years, I think there&rsquo;s a good argument for going for the quick and satisfactory solution, and then upgrading it over the years.</p>
<p>Also if alternatives are compatible, then other better solutions can be implemented later.</p>
<p>Why not get this done now, if it can be done satisfactorily, and work on improvements and alternatives later?</p>

<p>Not that I am a friend of EOT (Lite) but: The fact that IE doesn&rsquo;t support CFF-OT-based EOTs is less of a problem than is the ugly rendering of CFF-OT fonts on the Windows platform, see <a href="http://www.typophile.com/node/60281" target="_blank">this discussion</a> and <a href="http://www.typophile.com/node/59798" target="_blank">this earlier one</a>.

<p>What you are saying is plain old common sense. But common sense hasn&rsquo;t cut it in this debate so far. Workin' on it, though.
To be clear: the benefits of the new EOT lite are not hypothetical.
Cross-browser implementation of EOT lite will do two things:</p>
<ol>
<li>It brings web fonts, as a reliable technique, roughly 5 years faster than a newly drafted specification. If time is a consideration, as I agree with you it should be, hundreds of millions of Internet users will benefit 5 years sooner.</li>
<li>It also, at the same time, and as the growing list of font-producers who will license for the new EOT suggests, solve the licensing problems that have so far denied web designers the use of retail fonts.</li>
</ol>
<p>Technically, support for EOT lite means having the browser treat a file with an .EOT extension as if it had a .TTF extension. There is little else to it of any technical consequence. In fact, those browser makers who have so far withheld their support, concede this.</p>
<p>I know you have a deep academic, research-oriented background. (We met in passing at TypeCon in the informal discussions after the panel on reading research. I was the guy with Wet Macular Degeneration, if you recall.) 
Interestingly, Bert Bos, who was the co-creator of Cascading Style Sheets along with the fellow who is now EOT lite&rsquo;s most arch opponent, Opera CTO Håkon Wium Lie, agrees strongly with your &ldquo;build on what exists&rdquo; philosophy.
Some years ago he wrote a paper about what constitutes a sound approach to drafting standards and the section entitled <a href="http://www.w3.org/People/Bos/DesignGuide/use-what-is-there.html">Use What Exists</a> lines up firmly in favor of what you suggest.
Bert is still at the World Wide Web Consortium and still weighs in occasionally on various things on the Web Fonts mailing list.</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>rich</p>

<p><cite>Personally, if I were MS, I would be doing everything possible to undermine your rejection of an EOT-derived solution, including hotfixing IE back to version 6.</cite></p>
<p>Which is precisely my point, MS could just as easily ship a hotfix to support a non-EOT format in IE versions back to IE6, the code to do this is no more or less complex.  Personally, I hope they ship hotfixes to fix CFF support because it holds <strong>all browsers</strong> back on Windows, not just IE.</p>
<p>All the &ldquo;protection mechanisms&rdquo; that have been proposed center on origin-restriction when linking and the obfuscation of font data.  EOT-Lite effectively allows cross-site linking in current versions of IE because it doesn&rsquo;t enforce same-origin restrictions and an EOT font with a null root string can be linked to from anywhere.  Would it be better for MS to implement a same-origin restriction on fonts with a new format?</p>
<p>John, you seem to want to always put things in terms of a grand war between Microsoft and the evil forces of direct font linking.  If it&rsquo;s really a war than like all wars we all lose in one sense.</p>
<p>Direct linking of TTF/OTF came about because it made linking to fonts easy, plain and simple. There will always be situations where direct linking to fonts is simpler and easier for authors, situations where the fonts are not intended to be restricted use or situations where the font designers are simply willing to use the legal system to enforce their copyrights instead of requiring garden fences built into the font file format.  Direct linking to TTF/OTF fonts does not mean those fonts can&rsquo;t be lightly obfuscated, for example by changing the contents of the name table to produce a font that&rsquo;s effectively unusable as a desktop font but is still completely valid and works as a web font.  The Typekit and Typotheque services illustrate this point.  Protection does not <strong>require</strong> a file-based obfuscated format.</p>
<p>@Richard Fink</p>
<p>Sure, point taken, Adobe does sell some TTF fonts.  But they are a predominantly CFF font shop, as are other font vendors. Switching to a TTF tool chain is not as simple as you imply.  Adobe stated this clearly in response to a similar
remark you made on the www-font mailing list.</p>
<p>As to your second point, all I&rsquo;m saying is that EOT-Lite does not guarantee backwards compatibility in IE for CFF fonts.  Pooh-pooh the point if you like but for some font vendors I would imagine that&rsquo;s an important consideration.</p>
<p>Note: Firefox is not written FireFox.</p>
<p>@William Berkson</p>
<p>In this case EOT is a documented format [1] but not a documented set of behaviors, separating how it works in IE now vs. how it should work in other browsers is not as simple as others imply.  Should non-IE implementations just view the EOT as a header of padding bytes prepended to the font data and simply load the font data?  Or do those fields, some of which are based on data in the font and some of which are not, affect usage? Are there implications of that defined behavior?  For example, the original EOT submission blurred the meaning of the OpenType embedding bits to imply behavior within the browser (i.e. with Print/Preview set the user agent must not allow editing with a font).  That sounds minor but a little thing like that has big implications for implementations, since browsers don&rsquo;t typically implement &ldquo;fallback when font is readonly&rdquo;.  Since my guess is the closest thing to a real spec is the source code of the t2embed library, figuring these things out takes time which in a way negates the &ldquo;get it done now&rdquo; aspect of EOT-Lite.</p>
<p>In many ways the first Ascender proposal was better, to simply obfuscate table tags.  It&rsquo;s simple to understand what the proposal is and what needs to be done to implement it.  EOT-Lite is a trickier thing to define.</p>
<p>I think any of these proposals could be in shipping implementations in less than a year.</p>
<p>@outrasfontes</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not a big deal to support multiple formats but not ones that aren&rsquo;t well-defined, like EOT-Lite.  Up until now the idea under discussion was to have one format that all browsers implemented.  That&rsquo;s easier to standardize than two formats, one now, one later.  And supporting a single format is less work for font vendors.</p>

<p>Just curious why five years?  Non-IE browsers are on 1-year replacement cycles, and IE8 is replacing IE7 at a similar rate.  IE6 is it&rsquo;s own, oh so very, very special case.</p>

<p>Well, thank you for answering and I hope that soon you can solve all your questions with the proposers of the new format.</p>
<p>BTW, I tried to organize a list of font vendors that seem to agree with the spirit of the EOT Lite format, as described by Ascender.

<p>I am encouraged that you don&rsquo;t see this on your part as an &ldquo;us vs them&rdquo; issue, and also that you think that any of these solutions can be implemented in a year.</p>
<p>As I said, I don&rsquo;t understand the technical issues, but I am getting the feeling that the problem is really getting the leading browsers, especially you at Mozilla Firefox and Microsoft Internet Explorer to agree on a technical solution that provides a similar &ldquo;garden fence,&rdquo; as you put well, it for web fonts.</p>
<p>I am guessing that most digital foundries will be content with any fence that provides a clear barrier and warning for the honest, even if it, like garden fences, is easy to breach. That&rsquo;s for the reason, as I wrote earlier, that only public use will be enforced by digital foundries. But if a foundry wants more protection or a site designer wants greater ease of use I guess the services like Typekit and Kernest will be there in any case.</p>
<p>I just think that the sooner some kind of garden fence is agreed on, the sooner digital foundries can write their EULAs, and they will have a sigh of relief, and the web will start looking a lot better and more diverse as far as typography.</p>
<p>So now I&rsquo;m thinking the main issue is not, what garden fence is best, but what can you and Microsoft agree on, as you two dominate the market. I hope you all can resolve this soon.</p>

There are genuine bugs, and these should be fixed. But as Sylvain has pointed out on the W3C list, this is Microsoft&rsquo;s problem not anyone else&rsquo;s.</p>

<p>How is adding support for EOT-formatted CFF fonts not adding a new feature?  Hotfixes are typically gated on risk, not on a definition of &ldquo;feature&rdquo;.  Adding support for a simpler font format is far lower risk than adding support for CFF.</p>
<p>These are indeed Microsoft&rsquo;s problems but the argument is being made that EOT-Lite is better because other formats can&rsquo;t be supported for &ldquo;years&rdquo;.</p>

<ol>
<li>As has been explained many times, one of the problems that font makers and vendors have with naked font linking is that it exposes all existing fonts to casual misuse in an environment in which the majority of users are unaware of the origins of the fonts on their systems, unaware that these fonts are licenses, and unaware of the terms of those licenses. The desire for a distinct web font format is to make a clear distinction, anticipating the web as the major typographic medium for the future, between what we now think of a ‘desktop fonts’ but which we may eventually think of as ‘legacy fonts’, and a new packaging of font data in which licensing, serialisation, customer linked data, etc. are consistently present and available to both the customer and the foundry.</li>
</ol>
<p>I know a lot about fonts, but I couldn&rsquo;t tell you off hand which of the fonts currently on my system might be legitimately uploaded to a web server under current licenses and which might not. It would take me a lot of time to find this out, and that despite the fact that, unlike most users, I know where to look or who to ask.</p>
<p>I consider this distinction between existing fonts and new web fonts to be of general benefit &ndash; it makes even free licenses more obvious to the user than they are now &ndash; especially when combined with other proposed features of web fonts such as format compression. [For the reasons already discussed on the W3C list, server-side compression is not sufficiently implemented or implementable by all web authors; by the same token, the lack of compression in EOT Lite should be one of your arguments against the format, although we know how to solve that: accept the Monotype offer to release the MTX compression under a suitable free license.] Yes, naked font linking is easy, plain and simple, and this is why it makes casual misuse of existing fonts easy, plain and simple.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Server-side obfuscation such as Typekit practices, like server-side compression, is not a sufficient answer, since it relies on third party services to implement. Format obfuscation provides a minimal level of protection against casual misuse that the majority of font makers can accept. This means that we can have a single interoperable format that is a suitable baseline for all manner of font licenses, rather than multiple formats that might be suitable to some licenses but not to others; additional server-side protections can be offered on top of this basic format obfuscation.</li>

		<div class="commentbody"><p><em>How is adding support for EOT-formatted CFF fonts not adding a new feature?</em></p>
<p>The EOT format is supposed to be flavour-neutral; ergo, failure to support CFF-flavour EOT is a bug. The fact that there is nothing in the system level support that would make support for CFF fonts untenable in IE, while contemporary MS apps support CFF fonts, indicates that this is specifically an IE bug.</p>
<p><em>&hellip;the argument is being made that EOT-Lite is better because other formats can’t be supported for “years”.</em></p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not an argument I&rsquo;ve made. I&rsquo;ve heard everything from one year to ten years cited as the time it will take to implement a new format across new versions of all major browsers. I&rsquo;m inclined to think it will be shorter rather than longer, for the reasons you identify.</p>
<p>I do think there are significant backwards compatibility benefits of EOT Lite even if one ignores the CFF font problem in IE. There are a lot of fonts in TTF format that are licensed for or ready to be licensed for EOT Lite. There are some foundries that are very PostScript-centric &ndash; not just Adobe, but others whose primary market is professional graphic designers &ndash;, on the other hand most serious web designers already understand that TrueType renders better, especially on Windows. It is this backwards compatibility that I believe is the best argument in favour of EOT Lite. That backwards compatibility is far from perfect, but it is real.</p>
<p>I think it is web authors and designers &ndash; not font developers &ndash; whom you will need to convince that this backwards compatibility is not worth embracing. I think most font makers will be happy with any format that isn&rsquo;t naked font linking and which offers the minimal levels of protection against misuse that we have asked for on the W3C list.</p>

<p>Oh, I can tell you, None you didn&rsquo;t make yourself and permit for such use, none you received from others are permitted for serving are they? That is how simple it is and what all of &lsquo;our side&rsquo; must enforce. You won&rsquo;t get web fonts e-mailed, you get urls. Sans new format and until a new format is released, and after it has been undressed by time, we will always have to enforce this. Fonts today, and will be forever, licensed for a number of cpus and a number of embedding permissions. Print happens, and it must go on with licensed IP. Nothing technical is going to stop &lsquo;a nobody&rsquo; from serving a cpu-licensed fonts contrary to print licensing agreements, but it is very legally prosecutable because locating and serving fonts from a server does not happen &lsquo;automatically&rsquo;, it&rsquo;s a human act. And as such, only &lsquo;nobodies&rsquo; will be able to do it, same as print, where &lsquo;nobodies&rsquo; copy and compose with unlicensed fonts. If they become somebody, we find &lsquo;em.</p>
<p>Until someone changes the rules or market and makes all the &ldquo;IP somebodies&rdquo; into &ldquo;IP nobodies&rdquo;, there had better be a table to tell the difference in detail, a font format distinction will only last so long for this purpose, and probably not nearly as long as OT&rsquo;s undressing took.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>Just curious why five years? Non-IE browsers are on 1-year replacement cycles, and IE8 is replacing IE7 at a similar rate. IE6 is it’s own, oh so very, very special case.</em>&rdquo;</p>
<p>Busted!
For days I&rsquo;ve wondered &ldquo;why hasn&rsquo;t anybody asked me to justify the &lsquo;5 year&rsquo; estimate yet?&rdquo; It had to be you, naturally.
As I think you suspect, it&rsquo;s because 5 years is a nice round number that, (I truly do believe), is close enough to the truth to convey the severity of NOT acting on EOT lite. LOL! But it could actually be <strong>longer</strong>, depending. I find your own quick analysis a little loose-goosey, too.
When the first Ascender proposal appeared, Chris Wilson (former Platform Architect for IE) wrote <a href="http://blog.fontembedding.com/post/2009/06/10/New-Web-Fonts-Proposal.aspx">this</a> on the Ascender blog:
&ldquo;<em>* do the math - figure it&rsquo;s 2 years until the next version of IE comes out given current track record, and it takes 18 months for IE to convert 50% of its users to a new version (see adoption data from marketshare.hitslink.com). Even if you presume IE continues to drop share at 10% a year, AND IE puts support for the new (as-yet-not-defined) format into their next release, you&rsquo;re looking at 3.5 years to get support and get it deployed to the bulk of IE&rsquo;s market. (This presumes, of course, that other browsers implement it and get it deployed to 100% of their market in that time - then overall support would be 2/3 to 3/4 of the entire public.)</em>&rdquo;</p>
<p>What Chris didn&rsquo;t go into is that getting that new format out to the remaining 1/3 or 1/4 of the remaining public would be a long, drawn-out affair taking several years. And his analysis is also predicated on a new font format making it into the next cycle of IE, which is wildly optimistic, I feel. You have to add another two years for each cycle missed.
Granted, a better guesstimate can and should be generated. I&rsquo;ll take it on as homework and report. I&rsquo;ll be happy to change the &ldquo;5&rdquo; to &ldquo;too damned many&rdquo; in the meantime, if you so demand it. ;)</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>rich</p>

<p>There’s more to it than that. These services would turn up anyway, because the web allows us to tip the scales of commerce a little more in favor of type designers. Until now digital type vendors have had little choice but to sell licenses that never expire and can be used for anything and had to rely on the honor system to ensure clients actually bought a license for every workstation. Web font services bring back a market in which type wears out, prolific users must buy more fonts, and for perhaps the first time, make catching pirates easy. After seeing what these new services plan to offer I’ve already decided that in the future I’ll be charging a premium for traditional licenses, allowing no web embedding, and require web use to be done via a service.</p>

<p>The browser makers don&rsquo;t <em>have</em> to agree on an interoperable format, but they want to, and so do lots of other people for whom maintaining support for multiple formats is an expense: font makers and vendors, web designers, served typography services like Typekit. An interoperable format benefits everyone.</p>
<p>The most recent discussion on the W3C list indicates that everyone is agreed that a format along the .webfont or ZOT lines is desirable and people are willing to work together on this as a format. The debate now is whether EOT Lite will be an interim interoperable format.</p>

<p>The catch is that the web font services are based on non-service technology. So they are merely a convenience&ndash;not a requirement&ndash;from a technical standpoint.</p>
<p>Your &lsquo;licenses that wear out&rsquo; comment is interesting though. I can certainly see the appeal from the foundry POV. But, alas, there is no inherent technical implementation at this time that would any way force the consumer to adopt that model.</p>
<p>&ldquo;and require web use to be done via a service.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ah! Now that&rsquo;s an interesting angle. It uses a EULA requirement rather than a technical one. I can see that being an interesting route to take. It might work.</p>
<p>I have to assume once the dust settles a bit MyFonts will implement such a system and we&rsquo;ll migrate back to that being the primary provider.</p>
<p>&ldquo;and the ones who are going to sign on to Web fonts aren’t using Internet Explorer for Windows&rdquo;</p>
<p>GRAPHIC designers are in the Mac-only club. We web designers are fairly platform agnostic. ;)</p>
<p>That said, it&rsquo;s often true that we really don&rsquo;t give a damn what a site does in IE6 anymore (at least, not until the client yells at us. ;o)</p>

<p>100% agreement.</p>
<p><em>&hellip;a font format distinction will only last so long for this purpose&hellip;</em></p>
<p>The font format distinction provides a minimal level of protection against <em>casual misuse;</em> it does not, and was never intended to, provide protection against deliberate cracking and intentional misuse, so your mantra about how easily it will be cracked is beside the point. The difference between naked font data on the web and wrapped font data is the difference between leaving a $20 bill on the hood of your car and leaving it on the driver seat with the window open. To a thief, there is no distinction, it&rsquo;s free money; to an honest person the status of the bill on the hood of the car may be in doubt, whereas they will understand that the money inside the vehicle belongs to someone else. The web font format wrapper is one way of removing the ambiguity about whether a font is licensed for use on the web. It is not the only way, nor will it always and and in all cases be a sufficient way, but it is part of an aggregate solution. I agree with you that font metadata is another necessary part of the solution. There are also optional things like server-side obfuscation such as Typekit offers that can play a role.</p>

This is the new “rallying point” for all other browsers to interface to EOTL as the web font standard.</em></p>
<p>No, David, this is not what is ‘being offered in EOTL by MS’. This is what <em>I</em> proposed to you, in the other thread, as a way of ensuring that EOTL doesn&rsquo;t carry ambiguous baggage around the OS/2 embedding bits, because you had identified this as a problem in EOT. I agreed that it was a problem, and that it is something that should be clarified in both OT and also EOTL because the latter, whether we like it or not, has a strong chance of being implemented by the major browsers on account of its backwards compatibility with IE6, 7 &amp; 8. I also pointed out that the ambiguity re. the embedding bits &ndash; do they indicate permission for web linking or only for document embedding? what does ‘document embedding’ mean given that MS used that term explicitly to refer to web linking in the EOT spec? &ndash;  is not in any way limited to EOTL, but is a general problem for any OT web implementation. Finally, it is an ambiguity that potentially gets in the way of your EPAR table by presenting duplicate and possibly contradictory permissions elsewhere in the font. So I was trying to find a way to help you by clarifying the status of embedding bits re. web linking so that they don&rsquo;t get in your way.</p>
<p>And now this proposal from me, for which I repeatedly asked your opinion in the other thread, has become in your mind ‘what is offered by MS in EOTL’? Must be strong stuff.</p>
<p><em>Could you, john, please define for us the life cycle of an “interim web font format”?</em></p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure there&rsquo;s some number of people out there with working Beta video players and recorders, so ‘life cycle’ doesn&rsquo;t seem a useful metaphor when talking about any technology: things don&rsquo;t die until a long time after they cease to be supported. The attractiveness of EOTL for web developers &ndash; its <em>only</em> attractiveness as far as I can tell &ndash; is that it is backwards compatible with more than 60% of all browsers currently in use. So the short end of ‘interim’ is IE9 with support for some other web font format, which is estimated at being between 18 months to two years. But of course not all users upgrade, so the long end of ‘interim’ is the slow decline in use of the older browsers and the gradually diminishing giving-a-fuсk our clients have in serving content to those legacy browser users.</p>

<p>And I&rsquo;m left, again, searching for the connection between what I say and what you hear.</p>
<p>What do you mean by ‘OpenType’ in this context? The font data in all the web linking font mechanisms under discussion is OpenType. What&rsquo;s under discussion is how to package that data for dynamic loading by web browsers. The majority of web browsers now in use can dynamically load a file format that is compatible with their handling of EOT, hence the viability of what is currently labelled EOTL as an interim web font format with interoperability potential (the non-IE browser makers don&rsquo;t like it, but they&rsquo;re also testing code for it). In contrast, serving straight OTF/TTF fonts works in a minority of browsers in use, and has little or no interoperability potential (MS won&rsquo;t touch it).</p>
<p>I suggested on the W3C list that EOTL be re-named &lsquo;Compatibility Web Type&rsquo; with the file extension .cwt, to distinguish it from EOT and also to make clear that it exists in order to serve a compatibility function with existing IE browsers. Ascender have indicated that they like the name, and no one has objected to it, so perhaps that will be it.</p>

<p>David, I don&rsquo;t think so. Rather we just need to clarify what you mean when you use the terms &ldquo;OT&rdquo; and &ldquo;OpenType&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Like others, I get easily confused.</p>
<p>OpenType is defined as a font format that can contain either TrueType outlines (.ttf fonts) or PostScript/CFF outlines (.otf fonts). [[http://www.microsoft.com/typography/otspec/otover.htm]]</p>
<p>So I find it best to refer to .ttf fonts or .otf fonts rather than the more generic &ldquo;OpenType&rdquo;.</p>

<p>Bill, OT is OT, TT is TT. There are two separate specs. I can point you to the two links if you are still confused.</p>
<p>What you need to tell people whilst going about your heckling, is that the only interoperable format acceptable today in all IE is EOT wrapped &lsquo;round TT 1.0. Or, show me an OT font wrapped in a EOT that&rsquo;s got an OT font in it and works everywhere.</p>

<p>CWT for “Compatible Web Type” sounds too flattering. And with no indication that it&rsquo;s been, in W3C parlance, &ldquo;deprecated&rdquo; right out of the starting gate.</p>
<p>How about <b>LWT</b> for “<strong>Legacy</strong> Web Type”. 
Variations:
<strong>LFF</strong> -  Legacy Font  File/Format/Face
<strong>LTT</strong> - Legacy TrueType
<strong>LWF</strong> – Legacy Web Font
<strong>LET</strong> – Legacy Embedded Type</p>
<p>I like the word “<strong>legacy</strong>” – it brands EOT as what it is: a hold-over from a previous era and slated, ultimately, for obsolescence. It helps indicate that preference should be given, going forward, to .webOTF or WOFF or whatever it&rsquo;s going to be named.</p>

<p>Good point, Rich. &ldquo;Comaptible Web Type&rdquo; could lead to a meaning that it is already compatible with most browsers, that is far to be be a truth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Legacy&rdquo; suggests that it can be developed for obsolescence, not for the future that is better represented in .webOTF/WOFF proposal.</p>

<p>That depends how you count browsers. The whole attraction of this format is that it is compatible with the majority of individual browsers in current use. If it were not, no one outside of MS would be remotely interested in it. It is a format that is compatible with IE6, IE7 and IE8, and hence with approx. 60% of browsers being used to view web content by users. That browser market share is declining (it used to be approx. 80%), but still constitutes ‘most browsers’ in the only sense that phrase is significant.</p>

<p>I know. Microsoft has a significant market that we just can&rsquo;t ignore if we wanna work serously on that for a big audience. By most browsers I mean the different browsers in the market that also have its usage that is significant enough not to be ignored. I think it strongly depends of the target audience of a web site. The readers of Rich&rsquo;s readableweb.com, for instance, is certainly not the same as the readers of bbc.com. :-) Just to give an exemple, in my foundry&rsquo;s site it&rsquo;s 57% Firefox, 21% IE, 9% Safari, 8% Chrome and 2% Opera.</p>

<p>Segregating IE users to a less appealing version of the internet is really not such a bad thing. Maybe if developers gave IE pariah treatment it deserves IE users would realize what how awful Microsoft’s browser is and start using good software.</p>

<p>Simple questions usually involve complex answers. ;)</p>
<p>For the future I think we have to look for what is the best we have now and improve it. <em>But</em>, in this case, I think some things are not only in our hands, but in browsers developers'. So, let&rsquo;s leave the browser wars for browser makers for a while.</p>
<p>Considering the type treatment, let&rsquo;s see the best we have in browsers and its rasterizers now. IMO, it&rsquo;s Mac OS Safari and Mac OS Firefox. But that conclusion is not enough to reach a big audience. In this case our clients are web designers and authors and they (the serious ones) always considered how their pages work under different browsers and OSs.</p>
<p>IE usage may be falling down in some cases (my site included), but it still strong enough not to be ignored also. Please, do not ask me to define &ldquo;enough&rdquo;, but &gt;5% would be OK (come on, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Long_Tail">long tail</a> thinking)</p>
<p>So I think we don&rsquo;t have to <em>wait</em> for Microsoft, but <em>consider</em> Microsoft and give its users the best they can get.</p>

<p>It is worth pointing out that the biggest use of EOT over the past ten years has been in non-Latin and complex script usage, i.e. in situations where reliance on a couple of ‘web safe’ fonts that could be presumed to be on almost every user&rsquo;s system was never an option. It&rsquo;s a big world out there, and a lot of people are using IE because it supported EOT font solutions for their scripts.

<blockquote>

<p>Good answer. I like that.</p>
<p>@all on the &ldquo;IE&rdquo; Question:</p>
<p>I run into this kind of debate all the time on web dev/design forums. I can&rsquo;t believe what I read sometimes. 
When someone says it&rsquo;s pefectly OK to tell 25% of your visitors to take a hike and get a real browser, I just don&rsquo;t know what to say. Something about the concept of &ldquo;respect&rdquo;, perhaps?
Certainly, there is no big commercially minded site that would dare to ignore IE. Or insult IE6 and 7 users with a truly crappy looking site. You lose money, it&rsquo;s that simple.
Are there significant inconveniences involved in accomodating IE6? Sure. But they&rsquo;re not that difficult to handle. Time and time alone will solve this. MSFT cannot shove upgrades down the throats of its corporate customers.
If tomorrow, by magic, every copy of Firefox on everybody&rsquo;s computer were to be disabled, it would cause a lot of inconvenience, yes.
But if tomorrow IE were to become disabled, many major financial and government instutions would have to shut down until the problem was fixed. That&rsquo;s the difference in the level of responsibility facing Mozilla and Microsoft.
There are those who feel Microsoft <b>could</b> be more agressive in forcing updates and upgrades. I don&rsquo;t buy it. If I was running MSFT (I suppose I <em>could</em> make myself available ;), I wouldn&rsquo;t handle it any differently.
Might as well complain about the weather.</p>

<p>John&gt;I’m thrilled for you folk who can ignore IE because most of the Latin script using, design savvy, funky people who visit your own websites use Firefox.</p>
<p>Safari actually. And I&rsquo;m still going with the simple majority rules because the IE decline you cite is not an accident, but rather it is a true indication, along with the growth in the number of browsers and OS&rsquo;s, of the public&rsquo;s will. MS has non-standardized too many important fundamental standards in technical and visual ways for a full service foundry to pay attention to their web clients.</p>
<p>John&gt;My clients have rather different needs.</p>
<p>What are those needs John? If you are talking about your custom extra-Latin-glyph-repertoire narrow-style-spectrum font clients? the type designer&rsquo;s whose work you publish? the users of these products? or a particular client[s]?</p>
<p>A thing I&rsquo;m noticing, is that EOT fans are not broad-based founders in a design sense, a technology sense, and a client sense. And, that &lsquo;and&rsquo; meant all those things&hellip; it should be this group for whom true standards are made, no?</p>
<p>John&gt;It is worth pointing out that the biggest use of EOT over the past ten years has been in non-Latin and complex script usage, i.e. in situations where reliance on a couple of ‘web safe’ fonts that could be presumed to be on almost every user’s system was never an option</p>
<p>It is worth pointing out, that web interoperability is a different problem than that which EOT users have adopted it for, or the EOT format was invented for, or that stripped naked version which it is being proposed, for all browsers and all web users — exclusive of all other formats, effectively forever.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[The fact that the biggest use of EOT was in cultures that don’t use italic and seldom use bold styled text probably also helps explain why the IE style linking bug has persisted so long.]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>thanks! &hellip;and that ain&rsquo;t all. The fact that no one has paid attention to this technology means that no one knows what happens when it&rsquo;s applied universally and exclusively to a different problem, until they do apply it.</p>
<p>Maybe you and many others should not only &lsquo;consider&rsquo;, but plod this &lsquo;web format&rsquo;s&rsquo; development, deployment and employment. Or do you just want to keep &lsquo;steering&rsquo; and never paddle oh great &lsquo;missionary&rsquo;?</p>
<p>In any case, if&rsquo;n ya ever steer to land, you&rsquo;ll meet potential converts on one side of the river who appear smaller and darker, and on the other side, the same converts appear taller and lighter. I hope you have some other relics that might be impressive to these natives.;)</p>
<p>Cheers!</p>

<p>In general, I have to agree with Richard Fink&rsquo;s position.</p>
<p>But not because I think that computer newbies who would not know they could install another browser besides Internet Explorer on their Windows machines deserve <em>respect</em>. That is a bit difficult for me to sincerely repeat.</p>
<p>Instead, I would argue in a more practical fashion.</p>
<p>Like it or not, some people are going to treat their computers as if they were iPads - as locked-up appliances. We may not respect their computer skills, but we can still respect them as human beings.</p>
<p>But even if we don&rsquo;t, we will still like the money they have in their pockets.</p>
<p>So if I&rsquo;m an on-line retailer, and some font vendor tries to sell me fonts that won&rsquo;t display on IE, I <em>will</em> find another font vendor, because expecting people to use a different browser is throwing away part of my target market, and hence is throwing away money.</p>
<p>If people can&rsquo;t understand <em>that</em>, they&rsquo;re in the wrong business.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Surely the re-appearance of this old chestnut of a thread must mean something, but if I could only figure out what!
(First of all - would the powers that be get rid of the bogus post that brought this thing back to the top of the queue.)</p>
<p>Anyway, for some reason the first thing that came to my mind was that Chrome has surpassed IE in browser share - a thing that, if someone had predicted it back when this thread was news, I would have said &ldquo;nuts&rdquo;.
AND it also popped unbidden into my head that Chrome in Windows still doesn&rsquo;t use DirectWrite, it uses GDI still.</p>
<p>A happy New Year to all.</p>
