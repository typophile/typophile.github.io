  -- and am still not very happy with one detail.\r\n\r\nI need two characters which
  feature a convincing <a href=\"http://desktoppub.about.com/cs/typeanatomy/g/beak.htm\">beak</a>
  -- <em>\"a type of decorative stroke at the end of the arm of a letter, usually
  more pronounced than a spur or serif\",</em> but you all knew that of course. ;^)\r\n\r\nRather
  than use ITC Fenice or ITC Tiffany or something obvious like that, can anybody suggest
  an interesting contemporary typeface with pronounced serifs that has such a glyph,
  and more importantly, send me those two characters in outline form? I <em>will</em>
  ask the designer of the typeface the proper permission to use them, don'tchaworry.\r\n\r\nTHX
  a bunch."
