body: "Is there a sans serif typeface that is similar to Mantinia?\r\n\r\nI'm looking
  for a sans serif typeface with distinctive ligatures, raised small capitals, and
  tall capitals; but NOT like Mason Sans (by Emigre) which is too medieval.\r\n\r\nAlthough
  Sevigne by Reserves has lots of ligatures and it doesn't contain raised small capitals
  and it's too thin.\r\n\r\nDoes anyone know?\r\n\r\n\r\nLinks:\r\nMantinia: http://www.fontbureau.com/fonts/Mantinia\r\nMason:
