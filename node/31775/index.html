		<div class="commentbody">The year of the recording is 1954.
The most likely of 1954's bestsellers for the young lady in the romantic setting to be reading is Daphne du Maurier's <em>Mary Anne,</em> the story of an ambitious woman set in the Regency era.
Of the tracks on the album, suitable ambience would be provided by the Waltz in C-Sharp Minor by Chopin. I haven't read the book, but there's probably a grand ball and a waltz in there somewhere.</div>

Call me a throwback, but I don't think there's anything wrong with a woman being pregnant and supported by her husband--and happy and perky. Women should have many options, including that one, IMHO.

		<div class="commentbody">The Melachrino Strings album brought to mind the whole elevator music schtich but now that I know James Montalbano, I can never get Montovani named right! 
I am a big classical music fan but that bland stuff Melachrino and the like layed down really sucks! They just neutered every piece they played, washing out dynamics and mushing the sound into library paste. I think they put all their musicians on Ludes or thorazine untill they were robots before they were allowed to record. They should be called the Melanoma Strings for devouring healthy music cells.

One reason I like Glass so much is that he's willing to make fun of himself in public: all the classical musicians I know are, um, fairly warped in the humour department, but not to the point where they'd put <a href="http://www.philipglass.com/html/pages/jokes.html">something</a> up on the web....</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Bill, I sure agree with you about the 12x12 format. I am fortunate enough to have a very good stereo (part of my work is in the audio industry) and many, many LPs. The pleasure of sitting and reading liner notes while listening is such a comfort, and I have learned so much about music while doing this. The sense of comfort and edification is so absent when one holds a little 5x5 CD booklet.

Paul, I still remember vividly the first time I heard <em>Terry Riley in C</em> when a friend lent me his record in 1970. Amazing how the music would have a certain mass and texture as all the musicians were momentarily making a certain set of notes, and then as soon as just one musician decided to go to the next figure, the entire personality of the music changed! Really fascinating and wonderful stuff.

(For those of you who don't know this piece, a small ensemble plays a series of figures [Is that what Riley called them? I think so.], really just a measure of notes. Each musician can start the figure whenever he/she wants, and plays it for as long as she/he feels like playing it. The rhythmic ins and outs and melodic echoes are fabulous. Probably not what you would put on to snuggle up to the Literary Lass on Nick's album cover, though, unless she's reading Ionesco or Apollinaire . . .)</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Terry Riley had studied Balinese Gamelan. That's where some of the idea came from. They often repeat figures for an entire piece. The brilliant move was the deviation from the accepted notion of time - like Proust or Joyce in literature.

Those are the other titles in the Melachrino series, so perhaps this wasn't, as seems to be the general impression with the lads here, make-out music. That, I'm guessing, would be "Music for Two People Alone".
The association of romantic music and romantic fiction was probably too cute for RCA to pass on.

If mellow music is reading music, then <em>this</em> album, of similar vintage to Melachrino, would work too, and for that other thing.

James/Jim mentions <em>Waltz for Debby</em> which happens to be my all-time favorite jazz record. And Bill Evans my favorite musician in any genre. Which leads me to this: I just ordered a copy of Stephen Anderson's <em>Remembering the Rain: The Music of Bill Evans</em> and it is superb. Gentle electric guitar (Gibson), very liquid-sounding, and wonderful. Very much in the same vein as Joe Diorio's <em>To Jobim with love</em> of a few years ago. The Anderson CD is available direct from the publisher (http://www.artofliferecords.com). Very, very nice for anyone who cares deeply about Bill Evans's music. 

I wish I could give you guys a link for the equally fabulous Diorio disk but it's on a very obscure Italian label (RAM RMCD4529, released 1995) and even when I was working as a music reviewer and thus had inside connections, it still took me months to actually buy and receive a copy. Maybe someone highly motivated could find it used.

Finally, for any fan of Jobim's music -- in my view, the George Gershwin of Brasil -- I think Morelenbaum2/Sakamoto's <em>Casa</em> is a must-have. It doesn't say this in the liner notes, but the album was recorded at Jobim's beach house, using the piano on which he composed all of his wonderful tunes. Core musicians are piano, cello and voice (female, alto) with other musicians in places on viola, percussion. Spare, swinging, open, dreamy, languid, transcendent! </div>

		<div class="commentbody">I just googled Melachrino out of curiousity. He seems to have been an English equivalent of the American Montavani--lush sentimental strings that people who actually listen to music can't take. Here is the beginning:

"Melachrino's "Moods in Music" series of albums for RCA Victor epitomize one of the most popular and influential movements in space age pop."

And the kicker: 

"Melachrino's "Moods" albums are better remembered today for their covers thn their contents."

Told you so!

terry's been a musical hero of mine since i was kid and heard "a rainbow in curved air".
28 years later i had the honor of meeting and studying music with him; a life changing experience. he asked me to design the packaging for a concept cd he had been working on for 4 years. our idea was to combine the look of indian miniatures with american comic books. the full package will be on my website soon. (build in progress).

i fully illustrated the six-panel fold-out cd, printed in 5 colors on unbleached card stock.
the 5 colors were white, custom red, cyan, yellow, & black. i drew it all by hand and then created my own color separations in photoshop. i was quark illiterate and our good 
typo-friend pattyfab helped me with the technical output. you can read more about it at

		<div class="commentbody">Yes, Chet fan indeed. Of the many albums of his that I own, my favorite is <em>Let's Get Lost,</em> (Novus label, 1989) from the very end of his life. It's the soundtrack for a Baker documentary made by Bruce Weber. What I adore about Baker is his vulnerability, hesitation, the charged spaces between the notes. Miles is always penetrating and questioning, but in a more confident and definite way. Baker leaves more room for me to enter the conversation and feel my way around in there, whereas Miles leaves me more on the sidelines watching. Does that make any sense? Evans does this, too, in spades.

The early recordings done by Baker and Mulligan out west in the early 50s are also most enjoyable. 

What a tragedy that drugs took such strangleholds on people like Baker, Bird, Anita O'Day, Evans. And yet ironically, many of the performances that we treasure were done while they were high as kites (O'Day's performance during <em>Jazz on a Summer's Day</em> for example).

I like that Baker manages to speak so often with a lighter touch, the way foundry Diotima sits very delicately but solidly on a page. (There, on topic!)  </div>

At least for the Athenaeum, he and Leo Wyatt seemed to do just lettering and various borders, cartouches, and such.</div>

There is something so 50s about the way the women are painted--radiating  sexuality, yet demure enough not to go over the line into vulgarity. Part of it is that they don't look at you directly as a pin-up would have. </div>

They were the 50s version of Yanny--Boredom in a box.

June Alyson typifies the 50s image of women you describe, wholesome, sweet, bring home to Mom types. Not the rip-your-pants-off seductress type you might see today.
