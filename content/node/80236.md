body: "An agency had created a logo for, I think, a Malaysian telecom company and
  presented it as custom lettering. It was blue and there were gradients extending
  to the left from a capital E. Someone was suspicious and asked here about it. Someone
  found it offered as a free font, and found another example of it being used on the
  packaging for a Wal-Mart product.\r\n\r\nI'm going crazy trying to find this discussion!
  Can anyone help me? Thanks."
