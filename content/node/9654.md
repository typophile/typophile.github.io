body: Hi again. been long time since last time. <BR> <BR>I&#39;ve been asked to create
  a logo for a new domotic company. The owner basically want an image of friendly,
  easy, kind, affable, to surmount the idea of domotic = complexity, difficult, unaccesible...etc
  <BR> <BR>I&#39;ve done few sketches in that way <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/66885.jpg"
  alt="domo1"> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/66886.gif"
  alt="d2"> <BR>The second is maybe more technological and less toy, more serious.
  <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/66887.gif" alt="d3"> <BR>More
  simple. <BR> <BR>Just wanted to try an alternative way, more conceptual of domotic
  as central access and management and interconection, intelligence,etc.. <BR>I know
  it&#39;s distant from what&#39;s asked for, but what do you think about showing
  also this? Doesn&#39;t it keep the idea of simplicity and cleaness? <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/66888.jpg"

  body: Personally, I&#39;m not sure that the Bauhaus-esque face you are using suggests
    the &#34;friendly, easy, kind, affable&#34; because of it&#39;s intensely rigid
    structure. Humanist typefaces are what this is about. <BR> <BR>THe typeface you
    have used for the top 3 ideas is simple and clean, but lacks a human touch. <BR>
    <BR>As far as a good typeface to use, i will have to have a think about that,
    and figure out what &#34;domotic&#34; means.

  body: Domotic is dom&#40;icile aut&#41;o&#40;ma&#41;tic, I believe. I think that
    anyone considering that would prefer to use a company that represents itself in
    a hi-tech manner, therefore the bauhaus/chalet is more appropriate. The icon is
    another matter, your first icon represents to me a broadcast, whereas your last
    posts are a bit martial arts, I like the network/molecular structure of your fourth
    icon you could develop it for a more user-friendly, human feel, alternatively
    you could use a hand-in-control icon &#40;whether as a click of the fingers or
    hand holding remote - heavily simplified&#41; or use type to illustrate, your
    third logo is approaching this if the L was using the O as a button, although
    the radiating curves need work. <BR>Tim

  body: 'thank you for your post, you have some good ideas. <BR> <BR>Domotic is a
    mix of Domestic and Robotic, a more succesful term than &#34;intelligent buldings&#34;.
    <BR> <BR>i found too the martial arts position and would be changed by a normal
    standing man. I consider it ok as showing man having control in an easy way.  <BR>My
    personal favourite is the network icon, althouh you&#39;re right: it lacks of
    human feel. i&#39;ll work on it. and, finally, it&#39;s a good idea the finger/hand
    holding remote for the third logo. will see what can i do.'

  body: 'I prefer the type in the first set, but just the type in &#39;domotica&#39;
    &#40;both types&#41;. The second set seems too soft and overly-humanistic to me.
    <BR> <BR>But more importantly, the images you&#39;re using don&#39;t seem related
    enough to domotics and their purpose/benefits. I can see the connections you&#39;re
    making, but without the explanation they don&#39;t read quickly for me. Perhaps
    you could use something like the <a href="http://www.aiwaz.net/Leonardo/vitruvianman/">Vitruvian
    man</a>. The idea of the human being central in a system, and having their abilities
    extended. Or perhaps you could emphasize the harmony between the person and their
    home &#40;enabled by domotics&#41;. That would lead towards icons representing
    home. <BR> <BR>Also, I think the image of a remote is a negative, unless the remote
    is very unique and recognizable. &#40;But maybe that&#39;s just me: I&#39;ve got
    about 7 remotes at home, I don&#39;t want another one.&#41;'

  body: I don&#39;t get what the company does. Is this a company that could use a
    quick tag line to clarify their business. Otherwise it could be a ISP, telephone
    service, etc
