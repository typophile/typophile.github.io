body: "Today I noticed Merriam Webster has had its website redesigned. The new site
  leans toward text-based design, which is in keeping with a certain trend, and seems
  to lean away from traditional, reference-publication design; to me, the geometric
  sans-serif now used for the entry words says, \"twee,\" more than it does, \"authoritative.\"
  I don't especially care about the brand identity MW's trying to foster, but I do
  think the visual hierarchy of the new site is hard to navigate. Below are images
  of an entry as of Jan 2014 and Feb 2015. Thoughts?\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/MW

  body: "\"text-based design\"\r\n\r\nMy guess is that dictionary companies are a
    lot less profitable these days. Why buy a dictionary when you can look it up on
    the web? Going with mostly text saves bandwidth and reduces cost. I like the old
    layout better, but the current trend is for lighter-weight fonts."

    is the most I-dont-give-a-shit-about-what-the-text-says approach I could imagine
    for a dictionary website."

  body: 'By "text-based design," I mean a design which, to display organization, relies
    less on lines, bars, shapes, images, etc. and more on the placement of text. Like
    what you see on Reddit. Any design strategy can be used poorly, though, and I
    agree: MW''s not wearing it well.'
