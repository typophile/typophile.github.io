<p>Matthieu, I assume that &ldquo;obvious&rdquo; meant you didn&rsquo;t like what I had done. Below are the new capitals that I have that I like. They still need a lot of refinement, but I think they are heading in a direction that I really like, and feel that they work well with the lowercase. I thought I would leave the original capitals as the default and place the new one under ss01, or maybe the other way.</p>
<p><img src="/images/old-images/ms-alt-caps_5626.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Here they are in use.</p>
<p><img src="/images/old-images/ms-alt-caps-sample_4219.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Nick, what is it about the &ldquo;a&rdquo; that you don&rsquo;t like? I can understand the &ldquo;d&rdquo;, I knew it was an odd shape but I like it for some reason. Here is a redesign of the &ldquo;a&rdquo; and &ldquo;d&rdquo;, they are much more traditional. For now I have moved the older letters into alternative characters.</p>
<p><img src="/images/old-images/ms-alt-a-and-d_3891.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Finally here is a [[http://typefetish.com/downloads/ModerneSchriften-catalog.pdf|.pdf]] to look at everything I have so far. The .pdf shows alternative characters and ligatures that are in the works. I still need to flush them out a bit and expand them to complete the character set.</p>

<p>I find the original quite charming, but your digital recreation feels somewhat off to me. Blackletter is all about consistency, but your letters point here and there — just look at your {e} and {a} next to each other in &ldquo;Breaking&rdquo;. Your {u} and {n} look like they&rsquo;re joined at the wrong end. The swashes in the capital letters are completely out of character — the font is made to look like glyphs carved into wood. The little geometric details like the &ldquo;thumbtack&rdquo; on the left side of the capitals feel at odds with the rough chunkiness of the font at large scales. The top of the {d} looks weird. The {D} of your first version of the capitals was illegible.</p>
<p>In general, the thickness and angles of the &ldquo;strokes&rdquo; that make up the glyphs look haphazard and often unnaturally spiky, whereas the original respects the &ldquo;pen logic&rdquo; of blackletter glyph architecture even though the glyphs are build from wedges and rhomboids rather than pen strokes.</p>

<p>I do agree with a lot of what you said. I had given myself a deadline to finish the typeface which let to some bad decisions and poor execution. The deadline has been cancelled. The swashes have been scraped, as I agree they really didn&rsquo;t fit with the rest of the letters. I can see where the &ldquo;n&rdquo; and &ldquo;u&rdquo; look like they are joined incorrectly, but I have to force myself to see it - that could be because I drew them and know what they are. I added a gap to help clarify the letter forms.</p>
<p><img src="/images/old-images/ms-nualt_5666.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Here are a few alternative &ldquo;D&quot;s I had laying around. The first one is the original, the middle two are based on the uncial form and the fourth is more of a standard roman.</p>
<p><img src="/images/old-images/ms-Dalt_5864.png" alt=""></p>
<p>I drew most of the lowercase on a 11x9 grid and I wanted all the points to end at intersections which caused the letters to lose some consistency in stroke width, but I thought that added some charm and character to a very gridded design.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll post again when I have more done.</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Hi Michael,</p>
<p>the gapped versions of {u} and {n} are certainly more legible. I don&rsquo;t think a gap is absolutely necessary, but the problem with your original version was that the contact on the &ldquo;open&rdquo; side of the glyphs looked heavier than on the closed side, misleading the eye. Even in your gapped versions, the bottom left foot of the {n} looks heavier than the top right shoulder. Imagine drawing that glyph with a broad-nib pen — you&rsquo;d have trouble recreating that join on the top right. Now look at the {n} in your source image&hellip; that join actually makes sense in &ldquo;pen logic&rdquo;; you&rsquo;d simply draw it as a short down-right diagonal stroke continuing straight downwards.</p>
<p>Now, clearly, the original lettering isn&rsquo;t made to look like penwork. It looks more like the glyphic kind of letters intended for cutting into wood or stone — but it still respects pen logic as far as possible in order for the shapes to make &ldquo;sense&rdquo; as blackletters. I also broke pen logic here and there in my geometric blackletter, <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/catharsis-fonts/gryffensee/">Gryffensee</a>, especially when it comes to those circular arcs.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s also why I found these thumbtack ornaments and concave circular serif bracings a bit jarring. They fit neither the pen nor the carver logic — if anything, they look wrought from metal. If the whole font was like that, no problem&hellip; but you mix it with those carved glyphs and the occasional pen stroke, and that&rsquo;s what feels off to me.</p>
<p>EDIT: Oh, and I like that third {D} best. It&rsquo;s just that the glyphic stroke on the top grates with the metallic ornamentation on the sides&hellip;</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>OK, I went through and corrected the &ldquo;pen logic&rdquo; in the lowercase. I added a new &ldquo;a&rdquo; and &ldquo;d&rdquo; design and reworking the &ldquo;f&rdquo; to be closer to the source &ldquo;f&rdquo;. Using the &ldquo;pen logic&rdquo; changed the design of the &ldquo;k&rdquo;, which is great because I didn&rsquo;t like the old version. I then lightened the connections of the &ldquo;m&rdquo; &ldquo;n&rdquo; and &ldquo;u&rdquo; at the open end and made the closed end heavier.
<img src="/images/old-images/ms-modern_4474.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>Here is the new design in a text sample
<img src="/images/old-images/ms-modern-sample_5866.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>While looking at the source image again I realized that I had removed some of the elements that originally attracted me to the letters. Some were removed to prevent it from looking like a rip off and some where removed as I went to a cleaner design. The ascenders and descenders have been redesigned to widen as they ascend or descend. I made the &ldquo;f&rdquo; and &ldquo;c&rdquo; closer to the originals and brought the bottom of the &ldquo;e&rdquo; and &ldquo;r&rdquo; back.

<p>Here is the new design in a text sample

<p>I really like both versions and plan on making one of them alternatives.</p>
<p>It is currently called Moderne Schriften, which I don&rsquo;t like. If any one has any name ideas I would love to hear them.</p>
