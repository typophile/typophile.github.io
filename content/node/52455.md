  body: "I assume that \u2018you\u2019 = \u2018I\u2019.\r\nThe way I understand it
    is that 386sky has pimped Albertus and enriched it with some ligatures that are
    not present even in the <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/singles/monotype/albertus_pro_roman/\">Pro
    version</a>. Correct?\r\n\r\nNow you, Tiffany, can drop in and tell him/her about
    the \u2018you can always allow you\u2019 part. If 386sky has started with the
    Albertus version from Adobe, such modifications are okay with the [[EULA]], aren\u2019t
    they? But sharing is a different story, of course.\r\nF"
