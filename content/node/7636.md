  body: I like it. It looks great. The W seems to get heavier at the bottom and the
    strokes wider, though. Was  <BR>that intentional? The S also looks like it&#39;s
    going to tip over onto the P. I think the upper half reaches  <BR>too far to the
    left.

  body: I think that the middle bar on the E extends too far out to the right. Also,
    the R&#39;s tail doesn&#39;t need to extend below the baseline. It is too distracting,
    as only the Q has a descender, too. Otherwise, I like it.
