body: "Hi,\r\nI have recently taken on a print design job for a high class directory
  of top top restaurants, hotels and golf courses. The directory in question is not
  a publication like a phone directory, more of a listing of participating high brow
  establishments that members who subscribe to the directory can get benefits from
  and therefore has more extensive body copy for each establishment that that of a
  directory such as a phone directory (I only mention as I think it is an important
  factor on the selection of font choice). \r\n\r\nAnyway, I was looking to use a
  nice serif font for these listings although the text size is restricted to that
  of 6pt and therefore not suitable for all serifed fonts due to loss of definition
  at smaller sizes. I was hoping though of some possible suggestions by posting my
  situation on this forum. The main qualities I am looking for from my font choice
  is that it works at 6pt, has a good variation between bold and book/light and have
  a high class look. Any suggestions would be much appreciated. Thankyou."

    it works fine.

    has cuts for 5 and 7 points.  It's beautiful, and Stone's prices have come down
    recently; Cycles is an absolute steal! Sadly, only available in Type 1 currently:
    the site says OpenType is \"not yet available\", which gives one hope.\r\n\r\nSee
    also<a href=\"http://www.stonetypefoundry.com/bodoni6specimen.html\"> Bodoni Six.</a>
    It's available in OpenType, but not from Stone himself. FontHaus has it a good
    price <a href=\"http://www.fonthaus.com/products/fonts/view.cfm/sku/MI-OPP613153.cfm\">here.</a>\r\n\r\n<a
    href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/singles/fontfont/ff_clifford_ot_6_regular/\">Clifford
    6</a> is great, and available in OpenType.\r\n\r\nYou might also pester Nick Shinn

  body: Check out ITC Charter. It's got chunky serifs, so it works well at small sizes,
    and there's good contrast between regular and bold. Although it's a lovely typeface,
    it may not meet your "high class" criteria.

  body: I'd say if you wanted class go with Matthew Carter's Charter (with a touch
    of hz scaling and a little extra tracking). And of course Cycles 5 is ideal --
    and as John points out, a steal. Too bad Lino has never released Carter's tiny
    size version of Optima.
