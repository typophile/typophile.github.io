<div class="post-content e-content" itemprop=articleBody>Alright this is a plea for help. I've had a terrible time in the past with my typography teacher and shes trying to fail me yet again.
Our project this semester is to produce a book on "survivalism". . .I have chosen Global Warming. I have attached the PDF of my work to point, with her comments.
Ive gotten everything together with a general layout, but need to break the "monotony" of the pages within the book.
I need to illustrate a visual and typographic "push" towards a green tommorrow. She want a book appearance but wants it to not look like a book. Fun huh. Im asking for some help here as Im in a rut, both emotionally with her, and with my creativeness regading the project.
Thanks in advance & Cheers.

<div class=commentbody>It's difficult to be creative if you're hung up on the prospect of failure.
I would say the main problem is that the book is boring to look at. It's three colors: black, white and green and not much else or anything in between. A good way to break up the monotony is to create 4 or 5 styles you like and divide the book into sections, using a different style in each section.
If you've ever seen a good coffee table book, they mix it up constantly. Every page is different and fun to look at. Also, I don't know how much work you've put into this project, but it doesn't look like very much. If I were your teacher I wouldn't be impressed. I'm not saying that to be mean, it's just that to get a good grade I think you need to at least make it *look* like you've put a lot of thought and effort into it.</div>

<div class=commentbody>not sure if this would be of any help but just came to mind when you said bout her wanting the appearence of a book but not actually look like a book
check out http://www.buro-gds.com/03/index-en.html#
its not to do with your concept but may inspire? go to "special project I AM YOU"
also i like your page 66 with the green bold lettering, it would be better if you had more of these throughout the book, also you could try having the lines running across the whole double spread rather than treating the spread as two separate pages like you have, another thing could be to have the type size a bit larger and have no margins so the type goes right to all edges of the page? can create more visual interest
another thing you could try to make the spreads a litte more interesting is find like a key point from the info on certain spreads and have it kinda like a sub title to draw people in...like on the first image.... (sorry image quality is poor as its just a scan of a photocopy)

<div class=commentbody>I've had a quick glance at the PDF and few things caught my eye:
First of all, the margins need some attention. The spine margin is too narrow and once bound it will be even worse. Decrease the head margin and increase the foot margin too. Also, I think the text block should be larger. After all wouldn't a 'green' book try to use less paper?
Although Gill would be impressed, I think the text should be justified especially if you continue to use such a small text area.
I agree with your teacher's feedback about the subheads.
Lastly, have a look at Bringhurst's <a href=http://www.amazon.com/Elements-Typographic-Style-Robert-Bringhurst/dp/0881791326>Elements of Typographic Style</a> for some good guidelines.
All is not lost; your overall direction is good. Stick with it and you will get a good outcome.</div>

<div class=commentbody>This thing needs life. Right now it looks like a boring academic science publication. Bring in <a href=http://www.jpad.biz/images/breur.pdf>big, crazy, full—bleed images</a>. If you can't bring in images, go with a modular grid and start tearing it apart. Use giant pull-quotes. But you have to do something to make this compelling, because right now it’s just a perfunctory collection of paragraphs slapped into a manuscript grid. Read the note your instructor left on page 85. Then go look at what she said about pages 120-121.
Your teacher is very right about those rags. And turn hyphenation OFF. This thing is huge; you have all you need to work with, there’s no need for hyphens all over the place.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Images, images. You've got so much space in the margins, why not add some there? How about serif bold for heads? Also, simple, but keep the lines across the pages even so at the bottom they are on the same level. Overall idea nice. Follow teacher's advice. Yes, turn off hyphenation. Find some images, even Google them, they'd be rough anyway. There must be zillions of them. Since the paper is about global warming show some images of the effects of it. Go for it.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Consistent en dashes are required, find and change hyphens with spaces either side. The running ‘heads’ are going to be subject to creep. The appendix could be rendered as an information graphic which would help the understanding and give an opportunity to flex that part of your brain, although the grid is rather nice keeping heading and paras together would be good. CO2 should have a subscript 2. Folio page 18 has footnote references in the text but no footnote to go with them. Be sure to spell check and to create a consistent style for the abbreviations of measurements etc.
Overall I would consider what your subject is about, printing contributes in so many ways to forest predation and global warming, should a book on the subject be prepared in a manner that uses the least amount of paper, ink and mechanical processes?

<div class=commentbody>Your teacher is right, unfortunately -- the project is on the bland side. But it is not at lost -- body copy typeface is fine -- it's clean and easy on the eyes to read (with the few corrections) but the headings -- hey it's okay to use a designy typeface - and breath some life into it.
She/he has given you excellent notes on how to improve your page styles and design.
Meanwhile, please do us a favor - move the page numbers on the running feet over the the outside margins - there is a very practical reason for this. Should it ever be printed and a reader wants to know what page the are on they can do a simple thumb-through.
May I make one suggestion before you proceed. Get thee to a library or a book store. Open Non-fiction books - pay attention to detail. It is okay to want to do something different - and that works well in fiction and coffee table books - but... when it is non-fiction, it's a different kind of reader. Actually, it is a reader -- and not a picture looker. There is a clarity to how things are placed on pages. Yes, it has to do with gutters and safeties... If you were an old time typist I'd say margins and tabs...
Then re-read the teacher's suggestions (neutrally) and get back to work. You can do...

<div class=commentbody>Images and/or some kind off graphic elements could really help to bring some life to the pages. Something to help the reader understand what they are reading about without actually having to read every word on the page.
Your treatment of pages 120-121 could be used in a way similar to the images in mel77's post throughout the book to highlight important quotes or titbits of information.
Lot's of luck. You can do it.</div>

<div class=commentbody>James, you should draw attention to any statistics or relevant facts that can be quickly read and understood. You should read each page yourself, and find the most important bits, and highlight those... You can do "pull quotes" bolder/larger/different type... etc. The ultimate job of good typography is to communicate (IMO). Page after page of a block of body copy will not inspire anyone enough to want to read it. Get away from a formatting/layout mindset, and get into a commication mindset. Hope that helps...</div>

<div class=card-body>
<div class=commentbody>The problems here (and there are plenty) begin and end with the first lines of your post: "Alright this is a plea for help. I’ve had a terrible time in the past with my typography teacher and shes trying to fail me yet again."
<em>Trying</em> to fail you? Come on...
Your instructor's comments are all on the mark, but, if anything, she's far too generous and forgiving. It seems to me you haven't asked the basic questions and so you're here looking for others to supply you with easy answers; in short, you're looking for someone else to do your work for you.
<em>That's</em> the problem. The rest is just lazy typography.
I don't mean to be a complete jerk here, but you seem to want the result without the process, and the process involves study, patience and a sense of exploration. Univers for an environmentally conscious document? Why? It's cold and hard and lifeless: how is that supposed to convey an environmentally conscious perspective? Nature's messy, lush, rich, diverse, yet the design here is the opposite: hard, cold, clean, rigid, narrow.
I don't know what your guidelines were: perhaps you had to use this font, perhaps only one font, but even in that case there's plenty of room to create a sense of growth and movement; you've done that well with the elements bleeding off the page, but it's not enough (and it's not done all that well -- the "H" on page 3 is bled proportionally far more than the larger "H" on page 5, etc...).
My point is simply that the design <em>looks</em> the way you say you <em>feel</em>, and how can anything work under those conditions?
Your content isn't just stuff to rigidly arrange on the page, it needs a <em>voice</em>, a personality, a sense of identity, yet at the moment it's just lines and curves nailed into place. Have some fun, take a few risks, but do so with a firm understanding of typographic rhythm and tone. And if you don't know what I mean by that you need to read Bringhurst 5 or 6 more times.</div>

<div class=commentbody>James, I'm glad to hear you took something useful from my post; I woke up this morning worried I'd come down a bit too hard -- by mid-term most of my students want to slash my tires, but by the end of term they're often quite impressed with what they've accomplished. My point is take your teacher's attitude as a challenge, not a deterant; see it as an opportunity to see what you're made of, which is often an anxiety-ridden experiment. In the end, though, the idea is that the grade in your class will be irrelevant, the important thing (for yourself) will be to know that you didn't back down or give up.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Maybe your teacher had just finished watching <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XttV2C6B8pU">The Great Global Warming Swindle</a>?
If the book is intended to persuade towards a greener tomorrow how about a layout and colour scheme that changes as you advance through the book?
The pages could start off dull with browns/ yellows/ greys, sloppy grid placement/ typography, etc. & as the book advances everything changes?
You could try a more suddle approach to this in a million different ways.
If you need inspiration on the design i would go look at the flyers or menus at any starbucks, roebucks, or jamba juice. Starbucks always has some enviro flyers about recycling or comminity or nutrition. Jamba and Roebucks have plenty of brochures on their nutrition benefits packed full of colours and images.</div>

i agree with jason. It just looks like uv been lazy.I dnt see why ur prof shouldnt threaten u with the possibility of kicking u out of class. Instead of cribbing abt how unfair he/she is, show him/her that u CAN do much better than this. Thats probably what shes expexting from you.

<div class=commentbody>Criticism is only useful when it's grounded in a sense of encouragement; that is, when the purpose is to motivate. The same goes for the ability to accept criticism: the recipient needs to focus only on those aspects which are useful (not that this is a simple thing to do). If either side of this equation goes even a bit screwy, it all becomes personal and pointless, and the first sign that it's gotten personal is when words like "bugger off" come into play. "Bugger off" just means "please refrain from being cruel," but it can quickly also mean "I give up." James, don't let it become the latter. Trust that any advice you get is meant to provide help: sometimes it's easy to see how it's helpful, sometimes it's difficult, but a large part of what all of us do is turn difficult tasks into meaningful solutions, or in this case, uncomfortable feedback into constructive purpose.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Ive gotten lots of great help and I cant thank you all enough, none from you Ricardo. . . Sayerhs that wasnt directed at you at all, and its my mistake for posting it directly after yours, of course you helped, and I appreciate your effort, I was referring to the waste of a post above you. Cheers mate.
Ive gotten plenty of harsh crits, and i love them and accept them , thats why I post my poor work up here in hopes to get even more crits and again, get my butt in gear. Sures theres nothing nice about being told your not very good, but Im a firm beleiver in taking it in stride, enjoying the finer things and life, and working harder to produce better work. Hence me sitting here on a Sunday working, instead of gettin out on the slopes.
Cheers All</div>

<div class=commentbody>Jason, you make some good points about making and taking criticism, which I will try to heed.
James, I was not trying to discourage you. Nor was I judging you or your work. I <strong>was</strong> reacting to your reply to Jesse. I <strong>was</strong> trying to make you think about something Jason said earlier about not looking for easy answers, about not looking for someone else to do your work for you. In short, I was trying to say "If you simply take someone else's idea and use it as your own, then you will not be learning anything."
It's one thing to show what you've done and get a crit, it's quite another to take an idea someone else offers you. Your statement about liking Jesse's idea prompted my comment.
If people offer you ideas rather than crits, they are not doing you a favor, in the long run.
Best of luck, and I hope all goes well.</div>

<div class=commentbody>One good thing about all of the posts here is that they will help you to prepare for the world of work, when you get there, because, believe me, there are some employers, or clients, who are not so friendly and nice, not so helpful, and that can be bitter medicine. So you have to learn to work with it all. Whatever you do, don't lose the focus on what your own qualities are. And those qualities will develop as you become more experienced, and learn more of your craft. At this time in your life in the academic world you can certainly take some risks which you might not be able to do in the work place unless you are fully confident in yourself. And of course a part of that confidence comes with an understanding of what criticism of your work means to you and how best to understand it. Best.</div>

<div class=commentbody>I love the fact that you're using Univers, which gives you a whole lot of room for experimenting with the different weights. I love your color palette, but if you do want to kick it up a notch you should go to http://kuler.adobe.com/ for some sweet color combos.
Your teacher is way too big on abbreviation, and her closing comment was kind of mean.
I agree with her on a few things, but only to an extent, but I also think that if she wanted something that breaks the rules of a traditional book that she shouldn't be talking about margins. Granted your margins are uneven in certain places but what if you were to make a bigger statement with them.
I love the huge type, and I agree that you should try to shorten the amount of pages, to imply that it is indeed eco-friendly. I assume that because it is a type class she doesn't want pictures, so maybe you could you use a *gasp* webding of the world or a symbol of choice to represent the world. It may be a terrible idea and I may be criticised for it, but it's worth a shot.
Just break up the space a bit by mixing all of your elements and take chances. My first typography teacher ever made us research experimental type and bring in samples and try to draw on them for inspiration. It helped for the most part, and sometimes it's even good for you to look at the current examples of global warming books, and upon seeing how terribly they address something so important, you'll do the exact opposite.
good luck!

<div class=commentbody>-Maybe there are some elements that morph over time (from page one to the end)
-different shades of green
-can it grow , I mean the acctual piece
-can it somehow convey a solution towards the end... right now it is too blah
-Can you hide little pieces here and there in the type
-Right now it is green, what if it is brown,black and crappy, to convey the need for change?
I am just firing away here, but you need to think freely. Go balls out, talk to your teacher about it, and then pull back in. I am sure your teacher would much rather see you go out of your element and into something a bit more experimental. You are in school, and this is where you can experiment.</div>
