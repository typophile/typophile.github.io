  in December of 2007, twenty5ive is a design blog for both students and professionals
  alike. Founded by myself, Jim Hargreaves - graphic designer and typophile, twenty5ive
  looks at design through an unaffiliated, unbiased, and unpretentious lens.\r\n\r\ntwentyfive\u2019s
  mission is to show how design can improve the world we live in, or in some cases,
  how it may be failing us. Offering observations, fresh perspectives, and straightforward
  commentary on every subject of graphic design (especially typography), twenty5ive
  examines work being done across the world, as well as some of my own projects.\r\n\r\n[[http://www.jimhargreaves.com/twenty5ive|twenty5ive]]\r\n\r\n\r\nFor
  more information on the founder, please visit www.jimhargreaves.com."

    your own experiences to develop a story that then goes on to make wider references.
    \r\n\r\nJust flagged twentfive to my del.icio.us. Hope to see lots more good stuff
    :) \r\n\r\n\r\n "
