  (which was the Polaroid face of choice since 1958).\r\n\r\nhttp://www.flickr.com/photos/darcliptor/2312565003/\r\n\r\nNot
  sure if a solid ID is possible based on this photo, but if anyone can make even
  a decent guess, it would be appreciated.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance."

    and it's not the greatest shot..."
