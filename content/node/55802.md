  body: It looks like an italic that has been "backslanted" to appear upright. Perhaps
    Palatino, the face that organization's name is set in.

  body: "The principle sounds right, but I don't think that's Palatino italic, even
    with backslanting. The serif on the n seems too straight and the Palatino italic
    c has much more of a pronounced serif. All bets are off if outline tweaking has
    also been used.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
