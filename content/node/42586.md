  a sans serif typeface to spell GENESIS (all caps). The letterforms right now are
  handmade, and I like the weight and height of them, but I need to replace them with
  a real font that complements Chaparral. Thanks for your help!"

    a technoid impression for a christian community/church? Really?\r\nAnd why you
    choose Chaparral Italic, if you're going \"that hard way\"?\r\nFourth, design
    a logo in 0/1 first, means black on white. Later on, you can do all Illustrator
    offers \u2026\r\n "

    looks a little like Chaparral Sans. It might be too similar, but give it a whirl. '

    you like the handmade, why not keep it? A LOT of professional logos are done by
    hand. Jim Parkinson does all of the newspaper/magazine logos by hand.\r\n\r\nOr
    is that not your choice?"

    for a slightly more organic feel.\r\n\r\nalthough i do agree with you, there are
    times when handmade is the only way to go.\r\n\r\nAuto is a great find, but I'm
    looking for something with a bit more contrast to Chaparral. something distinct,
    but complementary."

    perhaps?\r\n\r\nSame designer.\r\n\r\n\r\nEdit: I just realized you asked for
    a sans. Oops!"

  body: "Maverick, I wouldn't be too quick to disregard Pom's comment. He is suggesting
    a design process that has proven to be very effective by many designers. It will
    be most effective when you are combining the typefaces. I also agree that the
    \"techie\" style you have doesn't make much sense for a Christian audience. Unless
    we're missing something, it would be more useful for us to critique your work
    if we had more info on the brand.\r\n\r\nAs for type, here are a couple of combinations
    that I think can be useful (I don't think Chaparral is right for what you're aiming
    at): \r\n\r\n- Gotham and Sabon (small caps)\r\nhttp://www.typography.com/fonts/font_overview.php?productLineID=100008\r\nhttp://www.linotype.com/1436/sabon-family.html\r\n\r\n-
    Avenir and Baskerville\r\nhttp://www.linotype.com/72/avenir-family.html\r\nhttp://www.linotype.com/749/itcnewbaskerville-family.html\r\n\r\n-
    I also like Omnes (sans serif), but not sure what to pair it up with.\r\nhttp://vllg.com/JoshuaDarden/Omnes/mudTyper+Weights/\r\n\r\nGood
    luck.\r\n"

  body: "Thanks Patricio,\r\n\r\nAs far as the design process goes, I have always
    started in black and white and do find it very helpful. I've attach a black and
    white version incase the color and texture in the first preview are too distracting.\r\n\r\nI'm
    actually reviewing the logo as well as all the other design work with a separate
    group of people, so I'm not looking for a critique on this form. That's not to
    say that I can't appreciate some suggestions, but Pom's comments were hardly constructive.
    To compound matters, much of the work I'm doing won't be going public until the
    end of next month so I don't feel comfortable providing more information on the
    brand, except that we're going for organic, fresh and current.\r\n\r\nThanks for
    some of the font suggestions, I like the general direction and they all fit the
    bill of being contrasting yet complimentary. Do you mind explaining why you feel
    Chapparal isn't right?\r\n\r\n"
