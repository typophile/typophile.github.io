  body: Hi Stephen - I'm working on titles for a TV programme, the source supplied
    some graphics but only rendered type. Fairly certain it's a typeface, the way
    the bowl curves up into the 'R' is really familiar. I'll attach some more letters
    but they're pretty shabby quality...

    this one - the 'R' should be the key, I've not seen an R like it:\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/ROO2_5957.gif]"

  body: It's a lettering style that isn't completely unique. <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/singles/linotype/serlio_lt_std_ot/?sample_text=R&sample_size=144">Serlio</a>
    has one, for instance.

  body: Thanks Stephen - Serlio isn't actually a bad match, just a bit too floral
    ;-) Definitely in the right area though. I'm starting to think it might be an
    obscure, early Garamond. Here's the last tiny letters I can extract, the four-pronged
    W and U with a tail is useful I think.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/roo3_4123.jpg]
