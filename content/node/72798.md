body: "A friend and I are designing a website to be used for a software development
  company. The font chosen is in the attached image. My knowledge regarding fonts
  is pretty subpar but the font doesn't really strike me as suitable for a software
  development company.\r\n\r\nIf you guys have any ideas for fonts that could work
  here, it'll be great. I'm not looking for something overly techy persay (although
  I'm up for suggestions), just something that'll will work for a software firm.\r\n\r\nI'm
  not averse to paying for a font, however I would prefer something free or not too
  expensive (I'm happy to pay $30 but not much more at this point in time).\r\n\r\nSorry
  if I've been a bit vague. Any ideas will be much appreciated.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/logo_6423.png]"

  body: I don't have any new suggestions I'm sorry, but you're right about what you
    have now, It's very "vingate kitchen appliance". And nothing but the O and N actually
    join up which seems to defeat the purpose of having a script-style typeface.
