  body: "I discovered the inspiration for this piece of lettering years ago in one
    of those \"old engraving\" swipe books:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.marksimonson.com/menu-cut.gif\r\n\r\nIt's
    a standard cut (sort of like clip art) produced by the MacKellar, Smiths & Jordan
    Foundry of Philadelphia in the 1800s.\r\n\r\nI've also got a copy of the original
    Harvest LP. The designer is listed (Tom Wilkes) but no specific credit for the
    lettering. Could be the designer did it. It's skillfully done, whoever did it.
    It's very faithful to the design of the MacKellar cut."

    I visited your website and thoroughly appreciate your work. As to Sheepdogs, the
    bulimic-waisted 'S' - especially being the leading letter - grates a bit, but,
    overall, it's splendid.\r\n\r\nThanks to all. Especially, again, Mark - for the
    historical reference."

  body: The "Harvest" lettering has a similar mistake (or maybe it's intentional)
    with the thin vertical stroke on the "H". The original "Menu" cut, on the other
    hand, follows the rules for letter construction. I definitely think "Sheepdogs"
    would look better with proper stroke weights on the "S". 'Course, that probably
    means losing the dots in the middle (which could be why it was done wrong on the
    "Harvest" lettering).
