  magazine that will be produced. The design is being generated from the ground up
  with no prior style guides; as well as developing structure and layout, appropriate
  text and display faces must be selected.\r\n\r\nAm wondering of any suggestions
  you may have for classic or contemporary faces in an editorial setting that you're
  feeling at the moment. Or in fact strategies you may have in place for selecting
  typefaces in these cases that have worked for you.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance"

  body: "Hi all,\r\n\r\nThanks for responses. You caught me dropping in some holding
    text in development there Frank! It's more of a general question on practice/any
    recent observations really; it's always interesting to run through methods/procedures
    for mulling over typefaces for a print editorial setting.\r\n\r\nFrom a brief
    perspective, things really can be best described as 'general', as items may be
    on news to general interest for most of the public (all ages and backgrounds),
    so must form a solid base for generic content; variations within a type family
    where appropriate may add interest, but reinforce consistency. Currently considering
    a sans/serif compliment: possibly a geometric for display paired with a transitional
    serif for body. But it would be interesting to hear of any favourites in this
    setting/publications or typeface selections that have caught your eye.\r\n\r\nOne
    thing that stood out to me recently was the Economist's Intelligent Life magazine:
    beautiful typography that shares a high standard with the magazine's sister publication.\r\n"
