    add functionality. I changed the default number style from tabular proportional
    to tablular oldstyle for use with an older text editor, for preparing our invoices.
    Of course, it was a SIL OFL font,  but I can see the reasoning here, too.\r\n\r\nThe

    Word, namely that Open Type number styles cannot be applied to the footnote number
    reference. Whatever the default number style of the font is, that style will be
    used in Word for the footnote references. I would prefer to use tabular lining,
    but to do this, I have to make tabular lining the default number style in the
    font.\r\n\r\nNone of this is for commercial use (it is for papers in college),
    and it would not, in my humble opinion, add functionality to the font. It changes
    a default \"setting.\" It does not give the font more functionality."

  body: "You're not getting good advice here, I suggest you ask somewhere else. I
    tested two ways of doing what you wanted, checking the results in both OpenOffice
    and InDesign. I neither own nor use MS Word. \r\n\r\nBoth techniques worked to
    a degree -- addressed and solved the particular problem you mentioned --  and
    took less than a half an hour. The half hour includes limited testing. Both had
    compromises. One way, you loose all OpenType functionality with numbers (arbitrary
    fractions, true-cut superiors, any number style other than default, etc.). The
    scaling functions with numbers that MS Word uses should still work -- they did
    in InDesign. And why wouldn't they?\r\n\r\n The other way you retain these as
    OT features, (except for oldstyle proportional), at the expense of having the
    wrong kerning with the *default* numbers. The result is not perfect, but then
    neither are tabular lining numbers.\r\n\r\nTo do the job properly is, as has been
    said, a lot of work. Basically, portions of the features code has to be rewritten.
    That would include some work with the classes used in writing features.\r\n\r\nAs
    far as who controls the license, I imagine Brill commissioned the fonts from John,
    so Brill controls any and all license matters. I would ask them. You don't want
    to be in violation of either US or European law, right?\r\n\r\nI imagine these
    two techniques are obvious, but in any case, I personally am not going to list
    them unless Brill, & as a courtesy (not legal requirement) John, both say it's
    OK.\r\n\r\nEdit:\r\n\r\nBTW, I'm amazed that Word won't let you associate another
    font with note calls. That by itself would solve the problem you mentioned."

  body: "1. Yes, Brill own these fonts, they invested a lot of money in them, they're
    making them freely available for non-commercial use, and yes, they have the right
    to determine the license permissions under which that happens. That said, I believe
    the no-modifications clause exists mainly to prevent unauthorised messing with
    the design, and contra Hrant's comments about 'if you want them to keep an eye
    on you', I would suggest contacting Brill and explaining what you want and why.
    They are among the most reasonable and accommodating people I have ever dealt
    with.\r\n\r\n2. Technically, I'd say that the easiest way to get to where you
    want from where you're starting is to edit the cmap table. You could use TTX,
    which is free, to dump the cmap table to XML, edit it in a text editor to re-map
    the appropriate Unicode values to the tabular lining numerals, and then use TTX
    again to merge the edited cmap table back into the font. You will lose some functionality
    in OpenType Layout if you do this, because the GSUB lookups for numeral style
    presume that the default style is oldstyle proportional (which Brill wanted because
    that is the most common usage in their publications), so changing to other styles
    and arbitrary fraction support will break. However, it seems to me that for your
    purposes you could simple edit the font name table too (also using TTX), and simply
    make a separate font for use in Word footnote style."

    rather brutal but, of course, if you are stuck with a dumb text editor, that is
    the simplest thing to do.\r\n\r\nIt seems to me though that you can get a fully
    functional font by just swapping the strings \u201Czero\u201D and \u201Czero.LT\u201D
    etc everywhere in the ttx files except in the cmap and GSUB tables, and replacing
    \u201Clnum\u201D by \u201Cpnum\u201D and \u201Ctnum\u201D by \u201Conum\u201D
    in the GSUB table. That can be done quite simply with a stream editor, like sed
    (on one ttx file without GSUB and cmap tables, and another with just GSUB and
    cmap tables). Or am I missing something?"

    the ttx file as a text file instead of a structured xml file reminds indeed of
    another era. In this case though, all that is required is swapping strings representing
    glyph names;  where those names appear in the structure tree is irrelevant; treating
    them as text thus seems appropriate; for instance the GPOS table (or its \"dump\"
    if you will), whatever its complexity, remains correct after the swaps, without
    any effort. \r\n\r\nConcerning Charles' remark that there is no onum feature,
    there is a substitution table for \"lnum\" that takes text figures and replaces
    them by lining figures. Since the glyph names have been swapped, the effect of
    the table is to do just the opposite, and the feature needs to be renamed \"onum\"
    (this is in the case Proportional Lining is chosen as default).\r\n"
