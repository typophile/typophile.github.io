  face. i have just reached <BR>the point where one questions the validity of such
  <BR>a venture - apart from type for type&#39;s sake! <BR> <BR>&#40;a vision of goths

    the darkness would be more characteristic. <BR> <BR>hhp '

  body: I agree with you kris, there is something overtly delicate about the 1 pixel
    stems.  I would definitely keep going with both weights. <BR> <BR>my suggestion
    would be to keep the width between left and right stems a little more consistent
    - at 2 px instead of 1 - especially with e,n,u,v,y... they seem too thin when
    it&#39;s looked at as a whole <BR> <BR>also specifically I would work on the &#34;c&#34;
    more... I like the last variation you have, just in terms of legibility.  I would
    also work on the &#34;s&#34; more as it seems to sit uncomfortably above the baseline.
    <BR> <BR>but many of the letters I find to be exquisite... the &#34;i&#34;, the
    5th and 6th &#34;g&#34; sketches, the first four &#34;h&#34; sketches on the second
    row.  in all very fine work you are doing, can&#39;t wait to see more

  body: Pixel Fraktur is a nice typeface with the alternate characters, an artist
    can mix or match characters for different letter combinations. <BR> <BR>Does Pixel
    Fraktur have any capitals and any word on the release of this type face at Myfonts.com?

  body: Robert, to tell you the truth, I had actually forgotten about this! But now
    that I am living at the beach  with my all my time free to pretty much design
    type I may just get around to finishing it off. Except I don&#39;t quite know
    how to optimize pixels for screen use by using outlines.  <BR> <BR>kris

  body: You know what you can do, find a pixel font at the size you want, then open
    it in FL and see how it&#39;s put together. <BR> <BR>Maybe some settings from
    those links might carry over.  Sorry I couldn&#39;t find more.
