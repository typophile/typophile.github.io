body: Does anyone know how to get an automatic ligature into a font. I recently learned
  how to insert ligatures into the AFM file, but I don&#39;t know how to make the
  AFM usable.

  body: Automatic ligature replacement is either a function of the software being
    used &#40;that is, to recognize a specific sequence of characters and substitute
    the appropriate standard ligature&#41;, or a function programmed as a feature
    in an OpenType format font.  <BR> <BR>For a series of characters to be replaced
    by a ligature automatically, the font being used still needs to contain the ligature
    itself as a separate glyph. Inserting ligatures into the AFM file serves not purpose
    of the ligature itself does not exist as part of the character set in the font.

    but fonts from other foundries &#40;ie Emigre or Storm&#41; don&#39;t. I recently
    heard that by inserting code into the AFM file you can make ligature replacments
    happen, but my experiments have not yet yielded any results. <BR> <BR>Maybe the
    question could have been different: &#34;What is Adobe doing that no one else

  body: Hmm... I&#39;ve never heard of a technique where modifying the AFM would assist
    mapping of ligatures to individual characters. I was under the impression that
    no current applications refer to the AFM file in any way whatsoever &#40;except
    perhaps under Windows in order to produce a PFM file if one was missing&#41;.

  body: I assume that Robert is speaking of Quark&#39;s automatic ligature function,
    which automatically replaces fi and fl ligatures only. Unfortunately, it only
    does this with fonts that are encoded with Adobe Standard Encoding. Emigre, Storm,
    Font Bureau, Hoefler, and others do not always generate with Adobe Standard Encoding.
    <BR> <BR>The AFM trick doesn&#39;t do any good on the Mac platform. I saw that
    documented in the Type 1 spec, but never got it to work either. I think it may
    only apply to Windows systems. &#40;Note that the fi and fl ligatures themselves
    are not available from the Windows keyboard.&#41; <BR> <BR>The irony here is that
    fonts which have been made with the extra ff ligatures in some of the less frequently
    used character slots &#40;which is why they don&#39;t use Adobe encoding&#41;
    don&#39;t get the basic fi and fl ligs substituted, so it all has to be done manually.
    <BR> <BR>This is undoubtedly due to the Quark implementation of its substitution
    algorithm. Presumably is assumes that if a font isn&#39;t encoded with Adobe Standard
    Encoding, then it might not be an alphabetic font, and so it doesn&#39;t do any
    f-lig substitution. <BR> <BR>There is actually a workaround for this, which Cherie
    Cone applies to Carter &amp; Cone fonts. It involves modifying a resource in the
    suitcase. She uses a proprietary utility &#40;that only works on old Mac OSes,
    I think&#41;. I have info here somewhere, but I don&#39;t remember the details
    offhand. If I get a chance, I&#39;ll look it up. <BR> <BR>On the flip side, Thomas
    Phinney tells me that InDesign will automatically replace not only the fi and
    fl ligs from a regular PS Type 1 font, but also ff-ligs, if they are present and
    named in a certain way. The downside is that they aren&#39;t actually encoded,
    so there can&#39;t be any kern pairs for them. <BR> <BR>-- K. <BR>

    Although it could be ResEdit employing a customized editor template, which would
    facilitate modification of the font data. The default FOND and NFNT resource templates
    in ResEdit are sadly lacking in depth.'

  body: I&#39;m not sure what the purpose of the &#34;AFM trick&#34; ever was. Maybe
    it was used by TeX? I don&#39;t think it does anything for any mainstream Windows
    applications. <BR> <BR>As for ff-ligs in indesign, you can make them work for
    regular Type 1 fonts just by naming the glyphs ff, ffi and ffl. You can leave
    the glyphs unencoded. <BR> <BR>T

    <BR> <BR>I&#39;m not sure about the font environment, but most resources in  <BR>OS
    X are much more accessible. The Finder contextual menu of  <BR>any application
