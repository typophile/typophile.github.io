    is not a requirement (or even desirable) to have a logo based on an existing font.
    Sometimes it even goes the other way round. \r\n\r\nA chicken and egg thing? :-)\r\n\r\nChrisL"

  body: ">Yes, Larabie whose font you suggested was the basis for Chase.\r\n\r\nProbably
    not. It's a five-letter (constructed) logotype, probably drawn from scratch. Being
    a (poorly-served) Chase customer, I have spent a lot of time on queue looking
    at their new promotional materials, all of which use a handsome sans serif which
    reminds me a great deal of Jeremy Tankard's work. But the only thing vaguely like
    the new logo is the new logo. And I must say that I agree with that decision:
    your logo is your logo, and you shouldn't try to \"brand\" every word you utter
    in your logotypeface."
