  logos/posters/print work/etc. \r\n\r\nI really like Si Scott:  http://www.siscott.co.uk/\r\nand
  Hydro 74: http://www.hydro74.com/\r\n\r\nThose are probably the two best examples
  that I have. I am looking mainly for ideas for type treatments for a shirt I am
  making for the team that I coach. Any websites/images/books that have similar inspiration
  would be great. Thanks!\r\n-Jesse"

    or books devoted more to type than logos?\r\n\r\n@fontplayer:\r\nActually I think
    the type treatments on their home page are more of what I am looking for. Edit:
    ahh I see you have to go to script then click on the individual fonts to get the
    different treatments. Though these are a bit more basic treatments like the ones
    in The logo font and lettering bible. Basic drop shadows and gradients, etc.\r\n\r\nI
    think I need to look for illustrators who do type to find the more interesting
    type treatments. Thanks!"

    cool type specimen pages for each font. http://www.misprintedtype.com\r\n\r\nFour
    Minutes to Midnight (2356) has some great magazine spreads using different fonts
    and layouts to communicate the context of dialog printed. Not sure if thats the
    kind of treatment your after however. http://lokidesign.net/2356/\r\n\r\nFor more
    magazine spreads I dont think you can go past Peter Maybury, He has some beautiful
    typographic spreads, particularly his work on Code magazine is most impressive.

    have some interesting type treatments in their portfolio. be aware, at the top
    of each portfolio-section, you have small numbers to access more work. i like
