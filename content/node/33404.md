    Larabie's <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/larabie/deftone/stylus/\">Deftone
    Stylus</a>, <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/t26/zav-tone/\">Zav Tone</a>
    from T-26 and <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/fontfont/prater-script/\">FF

    similar, but I can't find an exact match (yet).\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: "Yes, all my samples are original lead letters.\r\nMy collection of prints
    of full character sets, classified by DIN 16 518 includes approx. 300 prints.
    \r\n\r\nBut! But!! Tomorrow, Wednesday, 2nd of May, my new Korrex is coming. And
    I already have three dozend of character sets I did'nt print yet :-)\r\n\r\nHave
    a look - this is my new beauty:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/1_5295.jpg]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/2_3745.jpg]\r\n\r\n1,200
    kg and a format of 530 mm x 700 mm\r\n\r\nBut I will need weeks until it works,
    I know that.\r\nBecause I am a typesetter - and for sure I've nothing to do with
    the print stuff - too dangerous for the fingers and too much ink everywhere on
    my body :-)\r\n\r\nGeorg\r\n"

  body: "Yesterday, Wednesday, she arrives (yes, its a \"she\" and not an \"it\").\r\nThey
    printed 4-colour-designs with it in the past. So there are 4 sets of rolls for
    yellow, cyan, magenta and black - all well prepared.\r\n\r\nThe printing bed can
    be moved up and down. So its possible to print several printing heights of lead
    or linol or whatever. And there is a vakuum plate of 40 cm x 40 cm which can be
    used optional. This makes it possible to print cliches without preparing it before.
    The vakuum plate holds it as long as it runs.\r\n\r\nI guess I'll need a week
    or two to understand all functions.\r\nI am not a good printer (too much ink and
    too dangerous for the fingers). I'm a typesetter. But I'll try to do my best.\r\n\r\nGeorg\r\n"
