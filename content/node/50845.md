  in GRAFIK magazine (couple of issues ago) and is used by Wired Magazine for section
  headings (starting with the last issue - Oct 2008)? \r\n\r\nI do not have the sample
  of the font, but the characters are created using conical gradients... \r\n\r\nThanks "

    house font is Avant Garde. It's a great mag in my opinion."

    was featured in their \"Typo Showcase\" section... \r\n\r\nI was hoping that someone
    who picked up the latest issue of Wired would be able to identify it... \r\n\r\nIf
    not, I will get a copy of Wired tomorrow and scan a sample..."

  body: It's a custom job made for the sections 'start', 'test' and 'play'. The creator
    was was introduced with some text and info in the magazine when they started using
    it a couple of issues ago. I can post info later, when I get home.
