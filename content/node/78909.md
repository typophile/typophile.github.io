body: "How can I match, on my Mac, the pseudo-italicized, pseudo-bolded Garamond text
  created on a PC?\r\n\r\nI was given the unfortunate project of recreating a book
  from scratch. All I have is the PDF. The original Framemaker files, created on a
  PC, were lost by my client due to a virus. The client wants the book recreated in
  Microsoft Word to make it easier for her translators. I have done that - all 306
  pages of it. Horrid job but it's done.\r\n\r\nOne problem remains, though.\r\n\r\nThe
  sub-subtitles were created by, I suspect, pseudo-italicizing a regular Garamond
  TrueType font. I need to match it on my Mac.\r\n\r\nThe client moved the deadline
  back 2 days and I didn't have enough time to research it plus I had been working
  20 hours straight trying to get it finished.\r\n\r\nI moved the Garamonds out of
  the system folder and installed a Garamond regular TrueType font in FontBook but
  even that didn't work. My brain is fairly addled after 300 pages of Microsoft Word
  style formatting so I'm probably not thinking straight.\r\n\r\nI've attached a screen
  snapshot of the offending font.\r\n\r\nAny advice will greatly be appreciated.\r\n\r\nThank
  you kindly!\r\n\r\nGale Leitch\r\n"

    I downloaded and installed using Font Book and it worked fine. The word spacing
    is pretty bad. I could probably find another version of this font but...\r\n\r\nThank
    you!"

  body: "From what I recall of these style-faking processes, first you have to skew
    or slant the type, usually 10\xB0 though it looks like more in your example, then
    overstrike it four times, that is copy and paste the same text over its self in
    the same place, offsetting by a small amount each time such that the strokes thicken
    without creating new voids among the intersections, if that makes any sense.\r\n\r\nThis
    of course is easier to do in a drawing program like Adobe Illustrator, but for
    a 300 page document it might be more practical to draw up your own custom derivative
    fonts (strictly speaking about getting the job done, not dealing with the messy
    font licensing hazards involved, or even considering your deadline. I do not envy
    your situation). \r\n\r\nSomebody please come up with better advice than mine?!"
