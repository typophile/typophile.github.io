  outlines in Illustrator CS3, I noticed that it's forms are made up of very many
  points. Especially the V looks like it could be made with a lot less.\r\n\r\nI'm
  not a font designer, but isn't there a point to using as few points as possible
  in the design of a font? \r\n\r\nAnd is this an example of using too many points,
  or is there a reason for doing it this way?\r\n\r\nI'm now assuming that converting
  the font to outlines in illustrator will give approximatley the same points as those
  in the original design. Please correct me on this if I'm mistaken. \r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/BEAU_crop_3901.gif]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Bilde27_4843.jpg]"

  body: When you convert a font to outlines in Illustrator, Illustrator gives the
    curves a new point placement, i.e., this is not the way the fonts actually look
    in FontLab. You can't use this feature in Illustrator as a way to judge font outline
    quality, sorry :(

    the V has over 9 points while the other has only two. Of course a few more points
    are needed to get a slight decrease in the width, but not this many."

  body: "Hi Jorg,\r\n\r\nI\u2019m sorry to inform you but this is a hacked ttf copy
    of PF Beau Sans. Let me explain to you. Shortly after our site went up a few months
    ago it was hacked and somehow they managed to get several of our fonts but only
    the ttf versions which are used specifically online for generating the samples
    in the font test driver section. We acted immediately and now everything is well
    hidden but the damage was done. I\u2019ve had a hard time managing illegal circulation
    of our fonts to a minimum. Our opentype fonts which are sold online including
    PF Beau Sans are optimized and each one of the characters is made up of just a
    few nodes (postscript bezier curves). On the other hand the ttf versions being
    truetype contain multiple nodes (as is the case with this one) which were generated
    when we converted the opentype into truetype simply for online testing. No hard
    feelings but I would appreciate you buying the font."

    that they change in Illustrator. I did a double check and all the fonts I tested
    had exact point placements as they have in FontLab. The only difference is the
    type of nodes (Illustrator cant show the three type of nodes FontLab has).\r\n\r\nAdobe

    copy of the font, as I believed it to be bought and licenced by my school. I'll
    make sure it's deleted, and have it properly purchased if anybody wants to use
    it.\r\n\r\nFor the sake of curiosity: If you (or anyone else) with the real version
    of the font could upload a screenshot of the curves of these letters (A and V),
    that would be very interesting. "

    describe the same shape of a glyph...\r\nThat\u2019s why I\u2019m asking...\r\n\r\n\r\nIt
    is important to be very clear in the definition of OpenType. There are too many
    myths around this format: OpenType is a transparent format that can hold both
    CFF outlines (compacted PostScript) and TrueType outlines. If the font file is
    labelled OTF, either outline can be present in the font. A font labelled .TTF
    is as much of an OT font as a font labelled .OTF. The reason Microsoft decided
    to stick with .TTF is to provide backward compatibility with older systems, way
    back to NT4 even. Of course, OT typographic features will not work in these environments.\r\n\r\nAgain,
    it is very important to understand that .TTF fonts *ARE* OpenType. They work on
    both Mac OSX and Win.\r\n\r\nMy two pennies worth - and yes, the extra points
    are placed when Illustrator converts a TTF outline.\r\n\r\nBruno Maag"

  body: How tremendous is this. Here we have a guy named Panos complaining about having
    his fonts hacked and imploring someone to buy his font when his own "Muse" is
    an obvious ripoff of a much nicer font called "Delicious," created by Jos Buivenga.
    Come on, Panos. Fess up. A few added "serifs" does not an original font make.
    That's pretty pathetic if you ask me, and for those who don't believe me, simply
    check out the pdf from parachute.gr. and compare with Delicious, which is free.
