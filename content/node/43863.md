  I've got to go on, sorry. \r\n\r\nI believe the 'A' has a small cusp on the upper
  left. The top and middle strokes on the 'E' appear to have serifs up and down. The
  ampersand seems not to match the rest of the font.\r\n\r\nIf it's any help, this
  was probably created in something like Microsoft Word Art a good decade ago, so
  it might have been something in common use back then.\r\n\r\nA bastardized version
  of Friz Quadrata?\r\n\r\nHelp! Thanks!"
