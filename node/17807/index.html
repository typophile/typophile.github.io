<p>i&rsquo;ll go ahead and assume that most of us are near a computer, but where? you could be sitting at a coffee shop with a laptop, or in the comfort of your own home. some of you might be the principle of your studio in the corner suite, others may be huddled in a cubicle, sneaking a peak at your recent posts.</p>
<p>is your spouse getting a little jelous or are you almost late for work?</p>
<p>the sun went down 30 minutes ago. my boss and co-workers are gone. it&rsquo;s nice and quiet in the studio. i&rsquo;m staying a little late, trying to get this project done, realizing that i&rsquo;ve just spent way too much time crafting this post. what about you?</p>

<p>Before that I was on the couch in our living room working on my laptop, listening to some <a href="http://www.lamb.tv/home.html">Lamb</a> and tinkering away at a suite of 3 co-ordinated logos till 2 am while my wife and kids were sound asleep upstairs.</p>
<p>Even before that I did a sweep of the Type ID Board and cleaned a whole bunch of threads. After I e-mailed the logos to the client I couldn&rsquo;t resist checking in on <a href="http://pvponline.com/">PVP</a>.</p>
<p>Right now I&rsquo;d better get busy giving the kids their breakfast. :^) Laters.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>It&rsquo;s 5pm now, here in Central Europe. I&rsquo;m at home drinking coffee. Saturdays give me time to work on what I want to work on… today I&rsquo;m working on two display typefaces, one bigger one for Linotype, and a smaller one that isn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>I usually have Typophile on at work, but try to keep my reading and posting time there to a minimum. I&rsquo;ll post links to Linotype faces, or answer questions. Otherwise, I should stay away from it :-D</p>
<p>At work, I always have Vienna on in the background to keep tabs on every other type site  (especially Jürgen Siebert&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.fontblog.de">Fontblog</a>) via their RSS-feeds, but that only shows me new the new Typophile threads, not the new posts :(</p>
<p>My girlfriend began working on her graduate thesis on Monday, so my weekends are now all working weekends, too. Hopefully, this&rsquo;ll be productive, and I&rsquo;ll be able to bring some things to market by the summer.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>My wife and daughter are taking a nap at the moment, so things are unusually quiet. It&rsquo;s two pm here in Seattle. I&rsquo;m sitting at the dining room table with my laptop, sitting in an Aeron chair, and occasionally glancing out one of the windows to admire the trees. We&rsquo;re just outside Seattle proper, so there are tons of tall trees. The room has a lot of eight-foot windows, and some skylights. I&rsquo;m sipping ice water from a huge acrylic tumbler that could hold one of those convenience store drinks. Next to me are: what&rsquo;s left of the pile of mail I just sorted through, a biography of the Beatles, and some just-arrived items: the book &ldquo;Real World InDesign CS2,&rdquo; and CDs by Biff Rose and Ry Cooder. Maybe I&rsquo;ll put one on to listen to.</p>
<p>We just got back into town late last night, and this morning I read an email that said a friend needed help moving. I called him up, but he now has plenty of help and suggested that I take it easy. So I am catching up on remaining email, and in a minute I will take a break from that and continue working - either on a typeface or on a DTP revival of an antique out-of-print board game.</p>
<p>Cheers,</p>
