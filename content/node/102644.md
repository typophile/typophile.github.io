body: "<strong>Hello</strong>, \r\nlong time no see.\r\n\r\nI am assembling a list
  of currently released books on typography. It is meant to be a shopping list as
  I intend to review them for a magazine on a quarterly basis. \r\n\r\nTypography
  is meant in a rather broad term here, it could be the basics (as <a href=\"http://insideparagraphs.com\">Inside
  paragraphs</a> by Cyrus Highsmith) or slightly more advanced (<a href=\"http://markbattypublisher.com/books/typography-monographs-volume-2-size-specific-adjustments-to-type-designs-an-investigation-of-the-principles-guiding-the-design-of-optical-sizes/\">Size-specific
  Adjustments to Type Designs: An Investigation of the Principles Guiding the Design
  of Optical Sizes</a> by Tim Ahrens) or biographies (Patricia Costs book about the
  <a href=\"http://ritpress.rit.edu/publications/books/bentons.html\">Bentons</a>
  springs to mind, or the books about Excoffon and Jos\xE9 Mendoza y Almeida from
  <a href=\"http://www.ypsilonediteur.com/typo.php\">Ypsilon \xE9diteur</a>).\r\nAlso
  Stephen Coles <a href=\"http://typeanatomy.com\">The Anatomy(/geometry) of Type</a>
  obviously, and maybe I can squeeze in the second edition of Fred Smeijers <a href=\"http://www.hyphenpress.co.uk/books/978-0-907259-42-8\">Counterpunch</a>
  ? \r\n\r\n\r\nI would like to ask you for more suggestions. It needs to be at least
  partly in English and preferably released in the last two or three years. Anything
  you consider should be in the home of a proper typographer. \r\n\r\nok, a happy
  Walpurgis Night to you all.\r\n\r\n\u0192."
