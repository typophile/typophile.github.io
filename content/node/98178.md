body: "Hey everyone,\r\n\r\nWhen I generate a font from FLS5 and view its information
  in suitcase fusion, the foundry and class fields are empty. PFA image.\r\nI have
  edited the vendors list in FLS5 by  adding a custom foundry name to  the vendor.dat
  file and I am using this foundry name as the default. But, upon generating font,
  the foundry information is not part of the metadata of the font. Any workarounds?\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nTypogruffer"

  body: "Two different things here:\r\n\r\n- whether the foundry and classification
    info shows up in Suitcase Fusion.\r\n- what metadata is in the font.\r\n\r\nSF
    uses internal databases to map from fonts to what it displays in its user interface.
    For foundry name, SF has a list of \"known\" foundries, and can't recognize any
    other foundries. For classification, SF has a database of known families, and
    has classifications for those.\r\n\r\nFor any family or font that SF is lacking
    pre-existing data, an end user may add classification or foundry name info, but
    this only works for their particular local copy of Suitcase Fusion.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\n\r\nT"

      do you check for it every time before updating Extensis software?'

    I hope to see this change in the future.
