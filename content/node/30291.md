  far. I'd really appreciate any critique or advice; or even feedback on the company

    Right now it looks like something I'd see on the cover of the menu at a very expensive
    restaurant. \r\n\r\nIt would definitely benefit from tighter spacing. Between
    the gaps and the wide counters this one looks so delicate that it could blow away
    in the wind. "

    are you going to align the word \"design\" with \"zenapse\"? The letterspacing
    might still work (problem pairs like s\u2013e do still exist, though), while the
    wordspace, definitely not."

    around too much. Thanks for noticing. I'll fix it.\r\n\r\njpad - Thanks for your
    thoughts; perhaps I should elaborate on the company.  I want to convey elegance
    and professionalism; not granola and tie dye.  Too many non-profits present an
    image of unrefined, sophmoric disorganization, this is not a service I intend
    to provide. I'm thinking yoga culture, not music festival card table marketing.

    that they target for fundraising, ideally. \r\n\r\nAlaskan"

    when the icon comes into the picture. \r\n\r\nFWIW, I don't think that the design

      a group of trees.  Perhaps I went too far on the abstraction, eh?  I agree the
      type needs some tweaking (especially the s-e) and now I think I'll rethink the
      icon altogether. I may just go with the logotype, sans icon.\r\n\r\nBTW, I'm
      ok with feminine - women are often the founders of non-profits  - and I'm glad

  body: "Nicely put 'Alaskan' (E). I can sympathize readily with your reading of what
    Dan was saying.  It is deplorable and not helpful of descriptive to say weak &
    femenine at the same time. It's an old trope that's hard to get rid of.\r\n\r\nBut
    I would rephrase what I am guessing Dan probably meant. Somewhere in there he
    has a point. Your prospective logo is fairly complicated - it pulls in several
    different stylistic directions with the roccoco text and the techy tree things.
    It isn't focused. Your cleints will want to see that you can offer focus. What
    with all the disorganization ( too right about that by the way - too right) of
    orgs this is not a small issue. This logo looks arty not organized. This logo
    looks individual not organizational. Looking at this design I would have thought
    that zenapse was a store that sold candles jewelry and so on. In other words neato-cool
    clutter. I would nver have guessed it was a design studio geared towards helping
    'little guys grow up' and develop a focused professional image and or message.
    \r\n\r\nAlso, the name is ideosyncratic and individual rather that accessable
    and results oriented. I don't think Alaskans or anybody else will recall this
    name nearly so quickly as even something utterly rediculous such as 'pink poodle
    design'. Of course my point isn't that you should name yourself 'pink poodle'
    per se. You should choose something easy to recall and which resonates in the
    *right* way. The question is as Bram asks <cite> what are you trying to convey
    with the design? </cite>.\r\n\r\nI hope this doesn't sound harsh. Re-reading the
    thread I see that my comments are similar in direction to what jpad & Bram were
    saying even if they were less direct or more polite. BTW I am an Alaskan too.
    Feel free to email me off Typophile to chat if you want."

      design\" has been hijacked by right-wing-evangelists, it's NEVER a phrase I
      could use. \r\n\r\nI think I need to go back to the drawing board - 'cause if
      you guys don't read what I'm writing, well, then I have a real problem.\r\n\r\nAlaskan"

  body: "Before you go back to the drawing board, make sure to define your problem
    and intent well enough. If done properly, the visual will not be very hard to
    execute.\r\n\r\nFor instance:\r\n<cite>I want to convey elegance and professionalism;
    not granola and tie dye.</cite>\r\nThere are many kinds of elegance and professionalism.
    Elegance as in a graceful, refined taste? Or as in a pleasingly ingenious, often
    humble solution? Professional in a business/corporate sense, or in a masterfully
    executed project that can be done by everyone?\r\n\r\n<cite>I\u2019m thinking
    yoga culture, not music festival card table marketing. I want to make the little
    guys look grown up \u2014 to appeal to the corporations that they target for fundraising,
    ideally.</cite>\r\nI love these statements because you moved from the generals
    (x kind of marketing) to the specifics (yoga culture, not music festival). See
    if you can find more answers to the question: \"Zenapse is x rather than y\".
    The more you have, the better, because it'll eventually help you to see the agency
    and visualize its identity and personality.\r\n\r\nOf course, if you can justify
    the current design for Zenapse, I'll have a listen. In my opinion, you got \"fashionable/elegance\"
    down. For \"non-profit\", though, you have to explain it visually to me :-)\r\n\r\nThanks!"

    a result of the tracking) and the g\u2019s ear is a little bit rigid.\r\nThe trees

    I'd designed the letters!  The font is called Londonderry; but it's a knock off
    of a font I can't afford right now called Canterbury Old Style - one of my favorite
    fonts. \r\n\r\nBram - As far as defending the non-profit angle, I guess my thoughts
    are that I want to APPEAL to them - not BE a non-profit.  I want the director
    of a women's shelter to visit the website and think \"wow, I never thought we
    could afford this design firm. I can't believe they offer a sliding scale.\"  I
    don't want to project religion, organic superiority, grassroot-iness, corporate
    slicksters or clip art hell.  So what I see is arty elegance; it's what can be
    done on a budget.  Black and white infrared photos on taupe fibery paper with
    reserved text, as opposed to leaf and handshake clipart on high gloss with bullets
    and comic sans.  Mostly, I don't want that kind of clientel; I want to offer professional
    design to nonprofits that know they'll benefit from it - not spend hours trying
    to convince some shmoe why NOT to use WordArt to warp their logo into a arch to
    fit in a rainbow.  I want the logo to say arty, I guess, because that's my target
    market.  I guess I want WordArt rainbow guy to think it's pretentious :)\r\n\r\nI

    approach in my mind, and when there is a made up word, it needs little else around
    it to make it distinct. There is probably some philosophical insight that can
    be read into using the 3 dots, one of which is natural to the 'i', but I can't
    quite come up with it. Overall, it looks light, in a goodness/uplifting way.\r\n\r\nIf
    you are using the Adobe apps, I would suggest playing with the inherent (metrics)
    and calculated (optical) settings, Tim has the right sense on the spacing. And
    with less graphic froo-froo, that becomes very important.\r\n\r\nLogo aside, about
    the face: Does anybody else here feel that the lower stroke of the 'g' should
    flow more smoothly from the bottom left of the circle? Or, that the end of that
    stroke should point more towards the center again? I haven't seen more of the
    face than this example, but it seems odd.\r\n\r\n<A HREF=\"http://www.chozcunningham.com\">Choz

    And that means that when they see your web page they are going to assume that
    you prefer that style to work in ALL the time. Which it sounds like you don''t.
    So I think it might behoove you to build your identity & web pages look around
    the graphic & editorial values you want to offer them. If it was an ad agency
    or some kind of other graphically saavy entity you wanted to communicate with
