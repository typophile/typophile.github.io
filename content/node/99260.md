    since the Isle of Gough is uninhabited...\r\n\r\nChiding aside, the Adobe license
    allows you to upgrade your Adobe-licensed fonts yourself. No cost. I only know
    the expensive way to do that -- Fontlab Studio. But my decision was made to allow

    FontLab Studio lets one do this while maintaining a general ignorance of computer

    you just want access to them again,  I'm pretty sure there are a couple of relatively
    inexpensive programs out there that will let you put the otf wrapper around an
    exiting Type 1 font, so they'll again be available for you to use.\r\n\r\nSomebody
    here probably knows where there is a $100 or so font tool that's quick & easy
    to use.\r\n\r\nNote this isn't permitted by many font publisher's licenses, including
    the Monotype conglomerate. \r\n\r\nAs there are now gazillions of fonts out there,
    one factor I use in deciding to buy a font family -- I look at it as an investment
    -- is what the license permits. This is true for most of my clients -- university
    presses --  too.\r\n\r\nAs an example, another thing to check is what the license
    permits in terms of using the fonts in digital publications, and what the fees
    are, if additional. Some font publishers require you to pay a not insignificant
    sum for each font, for each use. If you are part of a publishing a periodical,
    that can add up. I've seen scholarly journals published quarterly where <strong>each
    digital issue</strong> has an added cost of $250 -- $1,000 extra per year -- for
    font licensing."

    in the font industry, because that format change from Type1 to .OTF was or is
    a one time thing. I don't expect such a change anytime in the foreseeable future.\r\nSo
    for the future, if you stick to TTF/OTF you should be fine. All foundries should
    provide you with (usually free) upgrades for the same font type. So if you buy
    a license for SOMEFONT.otf with the version number 1.0, you will certainly get
    1.1 for free and also very likely 2.0 and so on. If anything, that's an advantage
    over \xBBregular software\xAB. \r\n\r\nConcerning TrueType fonts: You don't need
    to repurchase those! Just transfer them to the Mac!\r\nIf you mainly rely on Adobe
    layout software you can also continue to use your Windows Type1 fonts. Just put
    them in the Adobe font folders. \r\n\r\n<cite>You pay a lot to swing with the

    knows where there is a $100 or so font tool that's quick & easy to use.</cite>\r\n\r\nTranstype
    for example. A new version for Mac is currently a free Beta. \r\n\r\nStill: Even
    if the EULA allows it, it's often not a good suggesting for font users to mess
    with the font files. You decompile a software and compile it again. That's not
    like opening a TXT and saving it again! You will very likely break something,
    even if you don't change anything deliberately. For example, because the font
    editor you use, just can't decompile every detail of the font file properly and
    you will generate a new file that has new problems. \r\nDealing with these problems
    can be time-consuming and in the end, you will have probably spent more time (\u2192
    money) than when you would have bought the new versions in the first place. \r\n\r\n\r\n"

    much every Adobe font we have originated as a Type 1 font, and I've converted
    most of them to otf. Occasionally, as with Minion, I went back to the Type 1 multiple
    masters fonts instead of using the .otf supplied by Adobe.\r\n\r\nOK, not fair,
    I've been using font editing programs since Altsys Fontographer 1.something, and
    could be considered experienced. \r\n\r\nBut here's the deal. For display fonts,
    I don't do anything except open up the Type 1 font, click on the automatic .oft
    features in FontLab -- sometimes there are some, sometimes not -- and \"generate
    font\" as an otf. We view all display fonts as requiring handwork by the compositor;
    \"OT features\" don't save much time here.\r\n\r\nNumber of problems with Adobe
    fonts: 0 (zero). Occasionally there is a problem with a free .ttf font -- when
    the font wasn't prepared correctly in the first place.\r\n\r\nSo I'd say, as a
    user with about 500 fonts converted, you will almost never break anything. I have
    never had a problem, at least with an Adobe font, or other font from a professional
    foundry where I have permission to modify.\r\n\r\nBut I'd also say this: if you
    try to bring up a Type 1 font aimed at text, with the automatic features offered
    in the OpenType format, you will spend a fair bit of time. If you could bill that
    time, you'd make far more money buying the font & billing your time. What if you
    can't bill the time? Or what if you want to fix some of the inevitable mistakes
    in kerning, or add features (which, after all, are only time-savers)? The picture
    is less clear. \r\n\r\nStill, I find your answer both knee-jerk and wrong. Give
    me an example of something that went awry."

  body: Btw, several of my favorite fonts are not available in TTF/OTF yet. Merlo
    and Trinite are examples. Some upgrades are not for format changes. Adobe has
    modified kerning tables over time with some of its fonts to make them look better.
    Contrary to some of the opinions above, I have not had good luck with upgrading
    Adobe fonts. Some were delivered with older software and some as special "gifts"
    for purchase. Adobe generally lacks record that one even has these fonts. Upgrading
    Adobe Garamond Premiere Pro, for instance, was not something that was possible.

    I did get them to change the license for us a bit. Anyway, without such goodies,
    an OT version doesn't save you much time.\r\n\r\nMerlo is offered in a couple
    places, albeit they're slightly different versions. I believe the Village license
    is very accommodating. Ask, and make your own OT version.\r\n\r\nAs far as \"improved\"
    kerning, yeah, sure. Dunno about you, but I always do my own kerning. Goes back
    to the days before PostScrit, how do you think we worked?\r\n\r\nIf the type designers
    can get uppity about their skills, so can the rest of us. Nowadays, all the graphic
    designers think they can set type. OK, show me the work. If it's long, like a
    book, all the automation you can get helps a lot. But that automation should come
    from like-minded people. For example, kerning for display type is usually no good
    for text. Adobe has some howlers, too, just like everyone else. \r\n\r\nAnd remember
    that Adobe, indeed, all the font publishers, don't know who's going to be using
    the type, and what the output will be. They probably have to assume that people
    using MS Word and a laser printer are their biggest customer base. Can't blame
    them for that.\r\n\r\nJust for fun -- from the types you like, I'd guess that

  body: "Thank you everyone for the comments. I found the second web reference from
    Jens interesting that smaller foundries often would give upgrade paths. I realize
    there are several inexpensive or even free downloadable or web based font converters
    available, but I am not sure they preserve kerning tables or other features reliably
    (as some of you have commented above). I have had good luck with Commercial type
    foundry, Storm, etc. Some foundries are somewhat helpful (Bertholdt) and allow
    upgrades up to a year. Monotype and Adobe have been poor (Monotype being bad all
    the way back to the old CD unlocking system from a decade or so ago). Teff has
    a progressive upgrade price where basically one pays 25% of the upgrade for each
    year after original purchase (so one needs a repurchase after four years). I had
    good luck with Tiro, but they have pulled most of their older fonts. The points
    raised about additional fees for embedding, etc. are good, and that is something
    I also consider in a purchase.\r\n\r\nEven with opentype, some of the postscript
    opentype fonts will not be read by some programs (e.g.: Madcap Flare, which is
    only really reliable with true type fonts and some true type opentype fonts).
    Dutch type library had upgrade options for older postcript fonts to opentype,
    but Teff has some of its more expensive fonts (like trinite) only available in
    postscript Win or OSX formats. When one considers the variety of uses of fonts
    (print and web based, in 3D and video applications, CAD programs, etc), it is
    good to have options for upgrades or sidegrades for fonts in the interest of compatibility.
    The reason I use a MAC now is that I spent a small fortune in fixing Dell computers
    before buying from a more reliable computer manufacturer; and I do collaborative
    work in video where some of the files I get are from strictly Windows (Vegas)
    or Mac (Final Cut) sources and I maintain dual boot partitions on an Apple computer.
    I don't care about the \"crowd\".\r\n\r\nI believe that the creators of type deserve
    proper reimbursement for their time and artistic work. There are a few fonts that
    are significantly overpriced, that that is not the rule for most. However, the
    arguments made in the Jens links mirror my own. It sounds like the best options
    are to purchase from the smaller foundries directly rather than from redistribution
    sites (fonts.com, myfonts.com, etc.). Adobe has its own business practices outside
    of font resale, and it appears to be reducing tech support to save money. They
    are moving to a lease based system for software, with substantial penalties for
    holding out on upgrades for several versions and purchasing upgrades the old way.\r\n"

    you shouldn't let type be used at all, save perhaps by the type designer. \r\n\r\nMore
    importantly, why tell someone relatively new to leave certain things to other
    professions? E.g., aside from casting a kern, where do you think the bulk of kerning
    programs came from? From compositors, when photocomp came out. Photocomp fonts
    did not come with kerning. The compositors wrote the kerning programs, if they
    were used. We also were known to make up new glyphs in photocomp, at least, with
    the user-friendly systems such as the Linotype V-I-P.\r\n\r\nI confess haven't

    But the attitude you're espousing is that of a protective type designer, with

    discouraging people from learning about the use of type serves the community poorly.
    What is type for, if not to be used?\r\n\r\n& just BTW, what software do yo think

    font had errors apparently forgiven by most rips, but not by (my, anyway) font
    editing program. I would not expect to find such errors from a major publisher

    the early days of PostScript Type 1 fonts, where with Windows anyway, you added

    at all. Just run out your pairs, write your kerning table, and test the results
    by running the pairs out again. Refine kerning as needed. This is how we had to
    work with the Linotype 202 (or the equivalent Monotype) fonts BTW, you couldn't

    that I think that Isle of Gough is correct that we shouldn't think of fonts as
    a buy-it-and-forget-it item any more. Even if OTF/TTF are the end of the line
    for another decade or more, people live longer than that, and moreover the more
    complex fonts become, the more they have bugs that need fixing.\r\n\r\nI remember
    back when I started at Adobe in the waning days of PostScript Type 1 fonts (1997),
    our objective at ship time was pretty much to ship a font that was literally bug
    free. We hoped to never need to update the font file after it went out the door.
    Although difficult, one could actually strive for that, and achieve it or get
    close.\r\n\r\nToday, the vastly more complex systems and fonts we have in OpenType
    make such a goal absurd. Even if there are no known bugs in a font going out the
    door, any high end font *will* have bugs. If somehow magically it does not, changing
    ideas of best practices or new enhancements to specs will make updates desirable.
    It could be \"Hey, now we can add names to those stylistic sets!\" or \"Hey, we
    need to rebuild this because the OpenType sanitizer rejects it!\" or \"We need
    to change the vertical metrics for Web fonts vs desktop fonts!\"\r\n\r\nSo, high
    end fonts will need fairly regular updates these days. That's life."

    not a black art, successful only with the appropriate chants and the addition
    of an eye of newt.\r\n\r\nActually... it pretty much is. At least, that's my conclusion
    from the evidence. I have found bugs in EVERY tool I have ever used in the last
    few years to attempt to \"round trip\" fonts from compiled form to change something
    isolated and then recompile the font, whether it is FontLab, OTMaster, or ttx.
    FontLab does not even try to do clean round-tripping, and nobody should expect
    it. The other tools do, and usually succeed\u2014but not always.\r\n\r\nAdditionally,
    at both Adobe and Extensis, I have regularly seen problems created by botched
    third-party conversions of fonts. Not as common as problems simply created by
    poorly-made fonts, but not all that unusual, either.\r\n\r\n> That's interesting,
    too. Though I wouldn't take adding an otf wrapper around a Type 1 font as a *conversion.*
    Nor can I remember any issues with \"converting\" a Type 1 PostScript font from
    Mac to PC format, or vice versa.\r\n\r\nIn all these cases there is data that
    must be invented from whole cloth. The conversion tool has to guess at reasonable
    values for this data. It won't necessarily get the same or compatible results
    as what the foundry would have made. It is platform-specific data that would be
    preserved in a creation/conversion process run by an intelligent foundry (as at
    Adobe), but simply won't be present in a single-platform font from the \"other\"
    platform.\r\n\r\nFor example, the Windows Type 1 fonts are generally likely to
    be style-linked, so they will not have Mac-like or OpenType-savvy menu names.
    The user must hope that other non-critical name fields are well-formed, or add
    the other menu names manually.\r\n\r\nKerning is a problem because the kerning
    in the original platform-specific fonts is restricted to the standard character
    set for that platform. So even though your Windows Type 1 font may have fi and
    fl ligatures (Adobe's all did), they will not be kerned in the Windows version,
    nor in any font derived from it by usual processes.\r\n\r\nFor older fonts, they
    are also likely to be missing some useful characters, such as the euro. Newer
    foundry fonts will have at least that added. (In converting their library to OpenType,
    Adobe also added 14 font-specific symbol characters to each font that were simply
    not present in the Type 1 versions.)\r\n\r\nThat's just off the top of my head.
    If I think about it for a while I could come up with more examples of issues.
    But suffice it to say that I am thoroughly in agreement with Ralf. Despite not
    even being in the desktop font biz any more, either (no \"revenue stream to protect\").\r\n\r\nOh,
    and besides which, ad hominem arguments suck. Even if somebody is arguing a point
    that happens to be in their best interests, that doesn't make them wrong."

    are far more focused -- But that's what IsleofGough is, a user.\r\n\r\nCiao \r\n\r\n(BTW,
    I used what I called \"database\" fonts in the 8-bit days, long before OpenType
    was a gleam in someone's eye. As we used TeX, we'd just write an encoding vector
    for whatever 256 characters we wanted. But, for example all the roman glyphs &
    all the kerning was in one roman font. When Adobe came out with the OT Pro series,
    I just wrote an OT wrapper around my \"data base\" type 1 fonts. Reason? Frequently,
    I still had more glyphs than were in the OT pro font, and I preferred my kerning.
    I bring this up to point out this isn't an idea that just occurred to me, I've
    been doing it for almost 20 years now.)\r\n\r\nBYW II: Adobe Jenson's kerning,
    as published, is <strong>still</strong> gefuched, just look at the string\r\n\r\nf_space_quotedblleft_(anything)\r\n\r\ne.g.,
    all throughout Ambrose (fils)'s book <cite>The Pacific</cite>. Sadly, the word
    \"of\" followed by a word in quote marks is pretty common... I'd call that an
    unfixed bug, and I did mention it to the young Mr. Slye awhile back..."

  body: "With all due respect Jens, these don't indicate the black art of type design,
    or really, making an Opentype font. They're simply questions of someone very new
    to writing OT features.\r\n\r\nWhat bothers me about the the notions in this thread
    is the model seems to be that everything can be segmented, that each person can
    do one task and that's all that's needed from them. The author writes the text.
    The editor edits it. The book designer gives specifications, and the typesetter
    sets up styles -- fills out a chart according to the book designers specifications
    -- then simply flows in the text.\r\n\r\nMaybe that's typesetting, but it isn't
    composition. Easy examples. There is an eng in the text, but no eng in the font.
    What to do? Set it in Ariel? By the way, proof is due in 1 week. It isn't that
    hard to make up an eng from an n and a piece of the j, or the f, depending. Or
    a schwa needed. Just double flip the e & reset the sidebearings. In the font,
    so it can be properly coded, so the text <strong>file</strong> is right.\r\n\r\n\"Oh,\"
    the type designer says. \"I could have made better ones.\" But in fact, even if
    the could have, they didn't make any at all. Mine are better than mixing Times
    Roman or Ariel in with with the fonts used for the text.\r\n\r\nGood editors have
    to know about (text) design, and a bit about type and composition. Good designers
    have to know about editorial styles and composition. And good compositors have
    to be able to work with type, have to understand both editorial and (text) design
    compromises. Been going on since the 1450s. I can come up with lots of examples,
    from hand-set foundry type, from Monotype, Photocomp, PostScript, and now OpenType,
    but I think this has gone on long enough. It is sheer arrogance for type designers
    to think \"only they\" can do the job. More than arrogance, because they're wrong,
    often enough, doubly wrong."

    we can tell from our experience that font modifications will likely cause problems
    for many users, and we can also easily explain why this happens from a technological

    you, like my business partner (who does have programming skills), would look at

    which can waste A LOT of time. 30-some years ago, we spent 4 hours arguing over

    regardless of how old your font is, if you have a bug, I suggest you just contact
    DSType directly, describe the issue, and ask if the most recent version of the
    font fixes it, or if they can fix the problem with a new update. (As for how to
    check date/version, are you on Mac, or Windows? Do you have a font management
    app, or a font editor, or are you reliant on the OS for font info?)"

  body: "Trinite is a lovely font, but not a general workhouse font like Documenta,
    Minion, Dante, Dolly, Vertigris, Lyon Text, Collis, Elzevir, Albertina, or Baskerville
    10. It is quirky, like Quadraat, but prettier. It is probably overpriced, but
    many of the Dutch types are pretty expensive. (and yes, it does not have ligatures,
    but would benefit from an open type version such as was developed for Lexicon
    for old style figures, small caps, foreign language options etc.) I have found
    several instances where trinite is the perfect font. Many of the Adobe (and HF&J)
    fonts are very good, but I end up seldom using them because there is something
    else a little better. The ones I use (like Jenson, Bickham script) are not general
    use fonts.\r\nTrinite:\r\n<a href=\"http://s1297.beta.photobucket.com/user/IsleofGough/media/TriniteExample_zpse23321f9.jpg.html\"

    border=\"0\" alt=\"Trinite Example photo TriniteExample_zpse23321f9.jpg\"/></a>\r\nI
    am not convinced that TTF/OTF format is a lifetime investment. I remember when
    bitmap fonts came out that were \"high quality\", followed by postscript fonts,
    then multimaster fonts (which were \"the thing\" if printers could figure out
    how to use them), then truetype (initially inferior, because cheap fonts came
    out in that format while the quality fonts were still postscript), then now opentype
    with optical variants and display and web options, etc. As of January 2013, there
    are still programs which work much better with standard true type, postscript,
    or open type. Not all use is with InDesign or Illustrator. There is AutoCAD, help
    based systems, Maya, Softimage, Media Composer, etc. - and each have their favorite
    formats. If one wants to convert fonts to outlines and create distortions, the
    old style postscript fonts are still great. The bottom line, is that it would
    be good to have upgrade options and reasonable regulations for use (embedded fonts
    in pdf, etc.) for whatever the next generation of use. I would not be surprised
    if changes may be developed in font specifications for better epub options in
    the future.\r\n\r\nBTW: here is a response from Underware.nl that is good: \"We
    don't double charge our clients for an OT update. The money previously invested
    in PS T1 / TTF fonts, will be refunded on the OT fonts. Repurchasing sucks. Never
    pay twice for the same thing, no?\"\r\n\r\nA bad response from Fontfont: \"Since
    OpenType is a completely new, different format, the fonts have been revised and
    the new packages don't really match the old ones, we do not offer an upgrade path\""
