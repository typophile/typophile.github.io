  good at 20, 14, and 10pts on page that has huge Clarendon. This is for a photographer's
  website, not a print piece, by the way.\r\n\r\nEDIT\r\nI don't normally use images
  as text when I make websites, this time I'm making an image heavy rather than a
  copy heavy site and feel the look is more important, so I'll be using image text."

    photographer's portfolio, times and arial don't meet my needs.

  body: I've always thought that Helvetica looked reasonably good with Clarendon.
    They share a similar underlying structure.

  body: "Are you setting the text as html or as an image? \r\n\r\nI think Avenir and
    Gotham both would go nicely with Clarendon's roundness but not for html."

  body: I'll be using images everywhere except the "about" page, which will be the
    only copy heavy page, anyway. I'm only looking to set about twelve words in this
    font, so using a picture is fine.

  body: "Image texts are really annoying on a website, especially when you want to
    copy some informations so what you can do is to use css code which says that if
    someone hasn't the first typography it swaps to the following one, for exemple
    : \r\n\r\n{font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif}\r\n\r\nThis way users that
    has a mac and those who bought Helvetica can see it and the others will see Arial."
