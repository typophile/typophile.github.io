body: "Hi this is my first post\r\n\r\nIm a visual Communication Student based in
  Dublin, Ireland. Currently working on an album for an Irish band SACCADE. Having
  trouble trying to convince the band to use my choice of type for the front cover
  (Trade Gothic|Baskerville). I love the arrangement and contrast of the two fonts
  and I see so much potential for the two typefaces when it comes to composition and
  layout of the booklet(lyics/thanks yous/personnel).\r\n\r\nCan anyone give me an
  honest opinion on what they prefer and why between these different arrangements,
  I wanna use the bands name in Trade Gothic/ & album title in italicised Garamond.
  The band want to use a straightforward Trade Gothic|Trade Gothic. I think it looks
  bland and dead and im sorry I gave this choice at all.\r\n\r\nThey have their hearts
  set on the purely Trade Gothic 'logotype' and i really do not wanna use it. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPlease
  give honest opinions what you think, its good/bad or complete rubbish! Anything
  will be of help.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/3_3804.jpg]\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/2_6076.jpg]\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/1_5197.jpg]\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/FRONTDECISION_3935.jpg]\r\n"

    appropriate advice.\r\nI think Baskerville plays along better than Garamond in
    this case.\r\nBut, have you tried to get rid of the \u201C|\u201D?"

  body: "Agree with Riccardo. Drop the vertical bar. It doesn't work with an italic
    'f'. Your spacing is also too tight (unless the type is bigger \u2014 but I assume
    this is a CD not vinyl)."

  body: The uppercase vs lowercase vertical alignment might work better if the lc
    is centered on the uc. Normally small caps or even x-caps would make more sense
    with lowercase, but then you'd loose the narrow Trade Gothic appearence.
