    be sure: 3/4 numerals are lining but smaller than caps and bigger than x-height?

    Just watch how you use \"lining\"... :-/ Damn number thingies.\r\n\r\n> And hybrid
    numerals have ascenders and descenders that overshoot only a little bit,\r\n>
    not as much as the ascenders and descenders of the lowercase characters?\r\n\r\nSounds
    good. And they're [normally] shorter than the UC and/or ascenders overall.\r\nAnother
    way is to say they're oldstyle numerals with \"bodies\" larger than the lc x-height.\r\n\r\nNow
    let me tell you about poodlemix numerals... Or maybe some other day.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    I had it explained to me. Mea Culpa.
