  There are so many blogs and such that it's hard to keep track, but I would love
  some \"go-to's\".\r\n\r\nI found this amazing page by Ralf Hermann that links to
  many scanned PDF's of vintage type specimen books...\r\n[[http://typography.guru/forums/topic/44-type-specimens-online/]]\r\n\r\nthanks
  for the references!\r\nJames"

    though. Lettering, typography, fonts & their ads/catalogues \u2014 those are all
    different categories. "

    days), Typographica, Ilovetypography, Typedrawers, Facebook.\r\nIdeas, not history
    mining.\r\n\r\nBut I do have a collection of old specimen books etc., it\u2019s
    just that I\u2019ve spent a lot of time studying type history the past 30 years,
    and have pretty much exhausted my interest in it. Paid my dues in the mines. Also,
    for new ideas, I have a backlog accumulated, waiting to be developed."
