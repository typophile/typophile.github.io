  body: ahh i just noticed the cork nibs with ink! Very cool. Do you use cork often
    for designing or specifically because you are designing a wine label?

  body: "it depends on what typeface you want to create . . .\r\nfor example - you
    can't create copperplate with cork nibs:-))) cork nib has far different characteristics
    from oblique nibs...\r\n\r\nlook here \r\nhttp://www.typophile.com/node/46988\r\nanother
    cork project:-)"

  body: very cool! I love the gradient in the stroke and the cork lines. I wonder
    how hard it would be to duplicate a similar effect in illustrator...
