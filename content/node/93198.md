body: "Hello;\r\n\r\nThe title of this topic is the title of a research that I am
  making about typefaces and typedesigners that, for some reasons, were lost in the
  history. Because of their designs or not, some typefaces are called UGLY by graphic
  designers (and other people), because they not follow the common  shapes of regularity.
  Texts like <a href=\"https://www.typotheque.com/articles/cult_of_the_ugly\">\"Cult
  of the ugly\"</a> are descriptions about the bad taste of this non-commercial flavor.
  \r\n\r\nWhen I listen the word \"non-commercial\" I always think in beautiful works;
  things like Zuzana Licko typefaces, Ed Fella, Jeffery Keedy and others alike. My
  search led me to things like <a href=\"https://www.typotheque.com/images/articles/conceptual/italian.jpg\">Calson

  but I love them,  and this experiences with type fill me with ideias that I want
  to put in my research.\r\n\r\nWhat I need [now] is that you fill this topic with
  this kind of experiences in type that I miss. I know that exist a lot of experiences
  in history of type design, but I need your help to find them all :). [Past Present
  and Future (if possible)]\r\n\r\nBest Regards\r\nF\xE1bio Santos\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    #28. \r\n<em>Interview to Barbara Glauber. <a href=\"http://www.emigre.com/ImagesLG/E28LG.JPG\">Broadcast
    issue</a></em>\r\n\r\n\"E: Heller writes that he thinks a lot of current works
    is \"driven by instinct and obscured by theory, with ugliness its foremost byproduct.\"
    He names Keedy and Fella as examples of this.I wonder if at the heart of this
    whole hubbub about \"ugliness\" is that it's difficult to understand that some
    designers sometimes want to reach a smaller audience instead of a larger, more
    homogenized audience. Or that we might want to push design to the \"edge\" and
    hopefully, move the whole practice along?\r\n\r\nBG: I know. A lot of people just
    completely miss the point that there actually can be joy in doing design, pushing
    the boundaries and exploring visual culture.\r\nNew things have to happen somehow
    and somewhere: otherwise what's the point of going on? If new desing is based
    in what was considered \"good\" in the past, what's the point? The models for
    \"goodness\" are inevitably going challenged and I'm not saying that this may
    be for everyone or to everyone's taste. Isn's this\u2014and I think this is something
    you were asking me\u2014about opening up your realm of influences and inspiration
    to other sources? I like to draw in my personal history, like comics and Letraset.
    I've had experiences common to a lot of other people, but not everyone is going
    to respond to the same things or the same way I do. My work often gets labeled
    as \"cute\", but can't work be a playful or funny? To be considered serious does
    it need to be stripped down, severe and universal? Everything would be so homogeneous.\r\nI
    love to take \"official\" language and turn it upside down. Tehre's an expectation
    inherent in official language. It's not very interesting to look at and it's meant
    to be read quickly. But say you take an icon has was designed to be read internationally
    as a symbol for a restaurant, turn it into a bleeding plate and use it as an icon
    to mark where someone was murdered in a restaurant\u2014now that's interesting
    to me. I were making stop signs, for instance, I'd do my job, and of course I'd
    make stop signs that could be read quickly. But I'm not making stop signs. We
    all know the difference between a stop sign and a poetry book, and we wouldn't
    design them is the same way. There's  an audience and a function for different
    things. You can't  have different interpretations with a stop sign, you must have
    an instant understanding. But a poetry book you understand within its context.\r\nHeller
    speaks on behalf of a large chunk of design community who don't want a loose interpretation
    of design. The meaning doesn't have to be right there, so obvious, it can be open
    to many interpretations. But they're afraid we want all of design to look like
    that and it doesn't and it never will. It wouldn't be appropriate to its message.\r\nYou
    know  that essay by Joseph Giovanni, \"Zero Degree of Graphics\" in walker Art
    Center's <em><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Graphic-Design-America-Language-History/dp/0810910365\">Graphic
    Design in America: A visual Language History?</a></em> The difference between
    the function and audiences of <em>Harper's</em> magazine and <em>Metropolis</em>
    is never acknowledged. Sometimes you look and read, sometimes you just read. Sometimes
    looks what the \"look\" says is as important to me as what it says.\r\nDesign
    doesn't have to be so freaking uptight.\r\nPolite design I rail against this stuff;
    it's so digestible, so slick, so pretty. But Gail, I'm really all talk about all
    that polite design stuff because there is a polish I myself can't give up. Ed
    has a name for making work less slick; he calls it \"degreasing the wheels of
    design.\" I try to not grease my design and at least structurally, I\xB4m working
    to corrode. I don't want my work to be like those coated pills you swallow\u2014I
    want to start sticking in people's throats. (cough)\""

    I remember it he called it a visual tourettes syndrome, design that says \"f**k
    you\" without really meaning it. \r\n\r\nWhen I co-anchored an AIGA event with
    Ed in New Orleans I found him to be out-of-touch, ignorant of contemporary talent
    and self-absorbed in his own little world of rebellion.\r\n\r\nDesign does not
    have to be Xanax, but his brand of letter/design concept is beyond my tastes,
    and devoid of reality. More like puking paint on a canvas.\r\n\r\nPrior to the
    lectures he made the statement at the dinner table that all fonts should be free.
    I almost cold cocked him and several in the restaurant knew and agreed that this
    was ignorance on parade.\r\n\r\nP.S. It is ugliness! But I guess that is in-your-face

  body: Design for communication is just that. It does not require the added universal
    beauty to make it communicate.  If you look at enlargements small text meant for
    tough situations like phone books, you will see designed ugliness in the inktraps
    and cuts needed to make the type work for it's intended purpose. If you look at
    Grunge types, you will see batterings and beatings that reduce legibility of reading
    but may increase communication of the intended message if used properly.  If you
    have an ugly message, just maybe, the type might reflect that.

  body: "Fabiouser \u2013 it almost seems like divine intervention that I came across
    this topic today (as I just registered this morning). I am excited for the discussion
    your post will promote!\r\n\r\n\"Cult of the Ugly\" was one of the defining texts
    that inspired me to study at Cranbrook, where I am currently a second year student
    under the tutelage of Elliott Earls. Though much different than the McCoy-era
    Cranbrook of the 1980's (Keedy/Fella), the spirit of the academy is much the same
    in that the work we produce tries to challenge the conventions of contemporary
    design discourse and explore visual culture. That being said, with the disciplinary
    fragmentation caused by the internet, it has become increasingly difficult to
    create something \"ugly,\" as most design seems generally accepted without much
    discussion or opposition.*\r\n\r\nGiven the examples in your initial post, I believe
    that our taste and interest in type design is similar \u2013 an interest that
    has led me to enroll in the Summer Program in Type Design at Cooper Union with
    Jean Fran\xE7ois Porchez. \r\n\r\nIf you haven't already, you should check out
    Elliott Earls' more recent [[http://www.theapolloprogram.com/workCranbrookPosters.html|posters]].
    Though his early typographic works through Emigre have been immortalized in the
    canon of graphic design history, I think this work demonstrates a contemporary
    execution of the concepts you seem to be alluding to/are interested in.\r\n\r\n*Earlier
    this year I had the opportunity to meet and dine with Damon Murray of Fuel (UK).
    We spoke at great length about how design culture has slowly diminished as a result
    of most designers unwillingness to openly critique the work of their peers. Though
    seemingly obvious, that particular discussion has resonated with me for a while
    now; we need more \"Cult of the Ugly,\" and conversely, need more challenging
    dialogue (see: Andrew Blauvelt's response to Heller, \"The Cult(ivation) of Discrimination\"
    in Emigre 31)."

    to an original work of art ... whatever ... without the process. It is the process
    that is what's most critical ... not the end product.\r\n\r\nOriginality doesn't
    just happened on command. Originality is part of a process ... part of a progression.
    Without which there ain't nothing happening. I'm talking about solid originality.
    Originality is a one off. And when it taps into the common psyche it's there obvious
    and bold and strong forever and ever. You can copy a one off - you can also bet
    your life that you'll never produce a 'one off' ...an original. I got a glimpse
    of creating an original work ... a 'one off' that set the world on edge when I
    created colored bacon. And no, I'm not going to talk about it. But I will discuss
    'the process' as NOT being the end product.\r\n\r\nLife is a journey - not a destination.

  body: I'm mostly with Ryan on this one, which is why for the most part I don't read
    'artist statements' in galleries. What matters is the thing itself, and the intent,
    the ideas involved in the making, matter only insofar as they are reflected or
    captured in the thing made, and even then may be irrelevant to the impact of the
    thing, i.e. what people end up appreciating most about a particular work might
    be independent of and even contrary to the intentions of the artist. And, of course,
    the very fact that we can appreciate as art things from other cultures, about
    whose intentions, meanings and even processes we are hugely ignorant, is evidence
    that this appreciation begins with the thing itself. This is not to say, obviously,
    that knowledge of intention and processes cannot <em>deepen</em> our appreciation
    -- it can, and we should seek it out --, only that it isn't a necessary condition
    of experiencing art.

  body: As the term implies, hermeneutic tradition comes into play as soon as interpretation
    is involved. I have a friend -- a retired professor of aesthetics, in fact --
    who loves abstract expressionism precisely because it defies interpretation and,
    hence, his aesthetic experience of it remains at the level of 'buzz', excitement
    in contemplation of the thing itself. In the case of something like the African
    mask, despite my lack of knowledge about the intentions of the maker, its role
    in its culture of origin, etc., I am not completely without context for interpretation.
    The mask, though stylised, is representational and anthropomorphic, so is interpretable
    in those terms and within traditions of understanding representational art, most
    likely of ritual objects too, and ideas about face and mask, about pretending
    or transformation.
