  body: "Well, this one is stumping me. I have just scanned through about 1700 serif
    font samples at MyFonts looking for this t and c, and for something with nearly
    horizontal serifs, and if they had it I missed it.\r\n\r\nThe most similar fonts
    I found were [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/fontfont/atma-serif/bold-roman/|FF
    Atma Serif Bold]],  George Ryan's [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/galapagos/kennedy/|Kennedy]],
    and Oldrich Menhart's [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/letraset/figural/bold/|Figural
    Bold]], revived by Michael Gills.\r\n\r\nThe 'c' seems like the best character
    for ID purposes, but I couldn't find anything that seemed exactly right, especially
    with the other characteristics in this sample. It's amazing how much you are forced
    to see when you have a limited number of letters as samples.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: I'm stumped as well. I looked at European type foundries - Dutch Type Library,
    Our Type, Porchez Type Foundry, since this looks like it may be from a French
    publisher? I looked through all the Garalde type styles on MyFonts, looked through
    Font Bureau (Elmhurst is close), but no luck.

  body: "I was the one plugging Bulmer. There are Bulmers and there are Bulmers. MT
    \ Bulmer is quite close, whereas BT Bulmer is not. I think Mike is right: Character
    by character, given the versions we have available, the shapes are not quite there\u2014though
    it is hard to make out the letterforms from the small jpeg. But the sample is
    definitely wider than the MT Bulmer.\r\n\r\nThere\u2019s basically thee ways to
    identify a font. One: You know it right off by its overall feel or look, like
    a car going down the street. That\u2019s a Chevy or a Ford, or that\u2019s Helvetica
    or that\u2019s Univers. Two: Character by character, which may miss the forest
    for the trees, given the number of different cuts of faces that are available
    and were available pre-digitally. (I hate to admit it, but I\u2019m a very pre-digital
    typographer.) And the third method: go with your first impressions then eliminate
    possibilities character by character. Bulmer is, afterall, an older \u201Ctransitional\u201D
    face. Bulmer is the closest transitional face, or any face, for that matter, that
    I could come up with. My best guess, for what it\u2019s worth, is that it\u2019s
    a Bulmer that is a close relative to an older Bulmer shown in the sample.\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Thanks for all your interest in this one. I cannot see the relation with
    bulmer to be honest. This typeface does not strike me at all as a nything towards
    baskerville, (low xheight, tall ascenders) nor any schotch/modern typeface (tall
    xheight, low ascenders). It seems to be much better balanced than that, even more
    like times roman. Or plantin.  [[http://http://www.identifont.com/show?3Q5|News
    plantin]]. \r\n\r\nBut what i think is characteristic about this one, is the stroke
    width and angles that resembles the one you get from writing calligraphy. "
