  problem with the number 9 is that it looks just like the number 6. I'm putting this
  on my inner forearm, right before the elbow. If I'm sitting at the computer, elbows
  bent, the bottom of the 9 will face the desk. I'll be looking at it upside down
  so it will probably look like a 6 to me.\r\n\r\nWondering if there is any font that
  is clearly a 9 vs. a 6. I'd like something a little rockabilly-ish looking, but
  not a 9-ball or something like that. Just a 9, plain and simple. \r\n\r\nI also
  like the way Garamond has a break between the ball and stem of the 9. \r\n\r\nThanks
  for any feedback. "

    can do so it doesn''t look like a 6 when it''s meant to be a 9. I''d also make
    sure to go to one that does lettering as a speciality. '

  body: Well, there's the handwritten way of putting a corner in the upper right of
    9. Some script fonts have this. Upside down, it will look like b, but at least
    b isn't a decimal number.

    and nines were followed by a dot to clarify the number... So, perhaps you can
    go for a nine plus dot?

    of spelling out a \"Nine,\" but Eva Longoria and her hubby Tony Parker have that
    on their arm. Not that it would ever matter, not like anyone would know that.
    But I would know it, and it would bug me. \r\n\r\nI kinda like the idea of a plain
    9 as well. Here's a couple 9's I'm digging:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/9blazed_3569.jpg][img:sites/default/files/old-images/9HomeRemedy_4120.jpg]"

    numerals: ix\r\n\r\n2. Combine the numeral and the name (Eva and Tony don't have
    that). You could use a larger number with the word nine spelled out below and
    surrounded by a box to make it look like a flash card, or if you used rounded
    corners on the box you could make it look like a playing card -- if that appeals
    to you. Or you could curve the word around the top of the number.\r\n\r\nPlease
    take to heart the earlier advice of others to choose your tattoo artist carefully.\r\n\r\nWhatever
    you decide, please post a photo of the final result for us to see."

    it (but obviously not in that font) with a loop at the top and a vertical leg
    straight down from the right. Upside down it's hard to mistake for a six but still
    a pretty clear nine.\r\n\r\nCan't think of any typefaces that have a 9 like that
    but I'm sure you and your tattoo artist could draw one that would do the job."

  body: "\"Wondering if there is any font that is clearly a 9 vs. a 6\"\r\n\r\nThink
    you are going to struggle to find a typeface that will achieve this. The problem
    is that the elements that make a '9' be a nine are the same factors that are used
    to make a '6' be a six. Thus changing any of the elements i.e changing the straightness
    of the leg on the '9' will only ultimately change the 6 in the same way. Saying
    that I do think that it is possible to make the mark more like a 9 instead of
    a six, but not enough to use on its own.\r\n\r\nFrom what others have suggested
    I think possibly having a dot after the number will work best. At first I thought
    the roman numeral idea might work, but then realised that in fact IX(9) upside
    down is actually XI(which is 11), so might no do the job unfortunately. \r\n\r\nGood
    luck. Let us all know what you decide to do."

    numerals will not do the job, since upside down they would read as 11. That's
    why I originally suggested lower-case roman numerals (ix) which do not read as
    anything upside down."

    from Clint-Anglin, might be worth checking whether lower case numerals can be
    used though. If so, this could be a good solution.\r\n\r\nAlternatively, you could
    always create the '9' using 9 objects, i.e circles or blobs.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/9a_3793.jpg]\r\n\r\n"

    enough in general, however if it's a type tat you want there's artists that specialize
    in that, and it'd be my obvious direction if i were getting numerals or lettering.
    FWIW there's also a fair number of oddly weighted A's in typefaces as well, having
    it done in tattooing is most likely due to not flipping the stencil beforehand."

    my son and I were born on the same exact day, December 9th. Pretty cool, and kind
    of unique. My son is half Mexican (my wife) and half white guy (me). She suggested
    I get the nine written out in Spanish.\r\n\r\nnueve\r\n\r\nI like that idea. \r\n\r\nNow
    I just have to find the right font. I'm tempted to go all Mission San Francisco
    Latino gangster and swirl it up, but as an average white guy, that's not really
    my style. I can't seem to find a Latino font that looks like anything but a Chevy's
    restaurant menu item. So sad.  \r\n\r\nShould I just go Helvetica?\r\n\r\n"
