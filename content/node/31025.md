  \ amusing (to me) to catch amateurs ripping pros (and eachother) off.\r\n\r\nThat
  said, I need some help.  Where have I see this logo/design type before?  I know
  for certain that I have but I'm having trouble placing it and it's driving me nuts.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.sitepoint.com/marketplace/contestentrant/741/161942?#entry32525\r\n\r\nI
  hope some of you eagle eyes can help out.  Thanks!"
