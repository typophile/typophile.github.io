  much Garamond Premier Pro but want something a bit more unique.\r\n\r\nCurrently
  have our eyes on Tyfa by StormType, but not totally in love with it.\r\n\r\nAny
  suggestions?  We are looking something that shares the same mood and structure as
  Garamond Premier / Tyfa.\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\nPeter"
