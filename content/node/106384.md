body: "This is probably more of a Mac System question rather than a font question,
  but this is driving me crazy and I thought perhaps someone here would know what's
  going on.\r\n\r\nBACKGROUND:\r\n\r\nI'm working with a rather ancient computer which
  uses MacOS 10.5.8 and Linotype FontExplorer 1.2.3 (i.e. the free version which I
  think is now discontinued).\r\n\r\nI try to keep the number of fonts installed on
  my system to the absolute bare minimum and then use FEX to activate others as needed.
  The ONLY fonts actually installed are as follows (listing families only rather than
  individual fonts):\r\n\r\n/System/Library/Fonts/: Aqua Kana, Geneva, Helvetica/Helvetica
  MM, Helvetica Neue, Keyboard, Last Resort, Lucida Grande, Monaco, Symbol, Times/Times
  MM\r\n\r\n/Library/Fonts/: Courier, Courier New, Geeza Pro, Hiragino Kaku Gothic,
  Arno Pro\r\n\r\nCurrently NOTHING else is activated.\r\n\r\nTHE ODDITY:\r\n\r\nI
  noticed while visiting wikipedia's list of pangrams that many of the non-roman examples
  given were displayed as missing-character boxes. Given my minimalist set of installed
  fonts, this is to be expected. What I was surprised by, though, was the fact that
  the Dzongkha example is being displayed in well-rendered tibetan characters. None
  of the fonts listed above include tibetan. If I copy and paste the text into TextEdit
  it is displayed as LastResort, so it appears that TextEdit is aware of the fact
  that I have no tibetan fonts installed, whereas safari is not. \r\n\r\nSo where
  is this font actually coming from? I've checked every font folder I know of (i.e.
  System/Library/Fonts, /Library/Fonts, ~/Library/Fonts, as well as the adobe font
  folders in Application Support (not that Safari should have access to those anyway)
  using <code>ls -a</code> and confirmed that I have no hidden font files. I've used
  EasyFind to search the entire drive including package contents and hidden system
  folders for either \"kailasa\" or \"kokonor\" (the only tibetan fonts included with
  Leopard AFAIK) and the only copies I have are those in my folder of removed system
  fonts, which should all be inactive. I've ran <code>atsutil databases -remove</code>
  to get rid of the system font caches; I've deleted safari's caches; I've deleted
  my FontExplorer preferences; all to no avail --  Safari remains convinced that I
  have a Tibetan font installed (it *looks* like Kailasa, though I can't swear to
  this).\r\n\r\nNow, I have no objection to having a computer which can speak (or
  at least render) Dzhongka, but it's driving me nuts that I can't figure out where
  this font is coming from. Are there any other locations not mentioned above where
  OS X and/or Safari and/or FontExplorer might look for fonts?\r\n\r\nMystified,\r\nAndr\xE9"

  body: "If you inspect the markup for the Dzongkha example, you\u2019ll see that
    there is a <code>span</code> tag that has the following attribute: <code>style=\"font-family:
    Jomolhari, sans-serif;\"</code>\r\n\r\nPerhaps that <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jomolhari_%28typeface%29\">Jomolhari
    font</a> is being served up somehow through one of their many scripts."

  body: "Thanks, Kent,\r\n\r\nI think you must be correct since I notice that there
    is also a Tibetan example on that page which <em>doesn't</em> display on my system.
    If I install Kailasa on my system, the Tibetan example does display but is clearly
    not in the same font as Dzongkha.\r\n\r\nI was under the impression that web font
    support wasn't available in Leopard, but I must be wrong on that count.\r\n\r\nThanks
    for solving this and letting me keep what little remaining hair I have left.\r\n\r\nAndr\xE9"

  body: To know what font is actually used in Safari, you can always save as pdf (using
    print) and look at "properties &gt; fonts" with Acrobat Reader or use Acrobat
    Professional to know the font of individual characters in the pdf that is generated.
