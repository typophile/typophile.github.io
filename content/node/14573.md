    but, it is where my grandma lays and my grandpa lives. it is where you can find
    unicahome. you can also find the coolest signage graveyard in the world. latenight
    cheesecake with chocolate truffle sauce. twilight swimming. count the stars (if
    you are far enough away from the strip) with nary a cloud in the sky. \r\n\r\nhouse
    industries and font diner are the perfect suggestions."
