  body: "It depends on the application you are using.\r\nThe best way is to work with
    an illustration package such as Corel Draw or Adobe Illustrator but I think you
    can also do it in Photoshop.\r\nThe general idea is to set a gray color to letters
    outline, set the fill color to white (or transparent) and apply an appropriate
    shadow effect."
