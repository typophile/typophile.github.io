<div class="post-content e-content" itemprop=articleBody>Gang, <br> <br>Way back as a junior lackey, I was taught to typeset trademark symbols (hereafter referred to as TM) at the end of a sentence thusly: <br> <br>"...so make your voice heard: call Acme.TM" (then kern the TM close to the period, rather than: <br> <br>"...so make your voice heard: call AcmeTM." <br> <br>Was I duped? Comments? Is there a reference guide that may discuss this vexing issue? <br> <br>Thanks in advance. <br> <br>CP <br></div>
<div class="comment card m-3">
<div class=card-body>
<div class=commentbody>The best reference is your own eye. What looks best? Which <br>method conveys meaning without distraction? I usually <br>kern the period so the "TM" is above the period and still <br>close to the "Acme". Crazy dedicated typographers do the <br>same with quotes over periods.</div>

<div class=commentbody>The logical rule would be to never break the symbol from the item for which it is the trademark. So perhaps my previous statement shows me as a designer and not a communicator. Hmm. So perhaps I'll modify that last statement. Otherwise, it might look as if the period is part of that which is trademarked. <br></div>

<div class=commentbody>I think it is incorrect to separate the &#153; from the <br>Acme with a period intervening. No matter what. The <br>implication in your approach (both 1 and 3 in your <br>example) is that the entire sentence (or at least the <br>clause "call Acme") is the trademark. <br> <br>I would set the sentence order as Acme&#153;., then <br>kern the period under the &#153;, but not so far as <br>your #3 example. This way, also, your text is not <br>"broken" when repurposed into an environment <br>without kerning. <br> <br>That's my opinion as a designer, typographer, and editor. <br> <br><i>>Crazy dedicated typographers do the <br>same with quotes over periods.</i> <br> <br>Crazy dedicated typographers who use well crafted <br>fonts shouldn't have to, as the quote-period kern pair <br>should be present in a good font. I also include kerns <br>for period-quote in my fonts. I have not, however, <br>heretofore built a kern pair for trademark-period. <br>But perhaps I will include it from here on out. (And, <br>I suppose, period-trademark as well, just in case.) <br> <br>-- K. <br></div>

<div class=commentbody>Oh good, glad to hear this discussion. The topic came up for me just Monday of last week. KL, your comment makes me think of web environments, and you were probably even thinking the same thing. <br>.</div>

<div class=commentbody>I am much less concerned with implying that a period or an entire sentence is part of the trademark than I am with that lonely period floating off by itself! <br> <br>In general, I would pull the TM much closer to the word Acme than you have in any of the examples shown, CP. Then I would tuck the period in so that it would match any other e. combination. <br> <br>I'm more concerned with the flow of the sentence as it is read. The TM is going to be ignored by the reader, so I try to make it as inconspicuous as possible while still meeting the legal requirements of the corporation. <br> <br>JMHO <br> <br> <br> <br> <br></div>

<div class=commentbody><i>>Bravo Kent. I hope we've created a new type design <br>standard here in this very conversation.</i> <br> <br>Hmm. I recognize now that my idea of building this into <br>the font is problematic. Such an extreme kern of the <br>period under the &#153; will pull the following spaceband <br>and subsequent letters up tight. This won't work. <br>(Except maybe with an OT contextual table or something.) <br> <br>I must admit that from a practical standpoint, setting <br>the period first is more effective. I still don't like the <br>idea of breaking the underlying text. <br> <br>And I agree with Kristin, I'd like to see the &#153; at <br>least as close to the preceding word as the period, so <br>that, if anything, they seem to occupy the same space, <br>with neither character before or after the other. <br> <br>My revised opinion. <br> <br>-- K. <br></div>
