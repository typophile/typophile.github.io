body: "I work for a small publishing company, and we would like to hire someone to
  add 20 characters to Adobe Garamond Premier Pro (6 faces). All of them involve simply
  adding an underdot or an overdot to an existing letter.\r\n\r\nThe letters are d,
  D, h, H, l, L, m, M, n, N, r, R, s, S, t, T for dotunder, and m, M, n, N for dotover.\r\n\r\nThe
  face is used in several of our series, and we don't have a Unicode compliant version
  of it that can produce these characters, which we use often.\r\n\r\nMany thanks,\r\nDavid"

  body: Design-wise that's not a hard job as you say, but creating versions where
    it's actually still easy to enter those characters with a keyboard (without stripping
    out other characters you might need later) is a little more difficult. Simple
    if you want to create a separate version (ie called 'GaramondOverdot') that you
    use alongside the original, but less so if you want to include all these characters
    in the existing cut of the font. Can you expand a bit on the needs/reason for
    the typeface edits so it's clearer what would be a good way ahead?

    body: "I thought the whole point of Unicode fonts was that there was a slot for
      every known character--a unique coding for each one, which expressly does not
      strip out other characters in the process. \r\n\r\nWe already have a postscript
      version of this font that does as you say--supplants some of the existing 256
      ascii characters with the diacritical characters that we need. We need an Adobe
      Garamond with these same characters, but in an Opentype Unicode format.\r\n\r\nThanks\r\nDavid"

  body: "David,\r\nAs long as there is actually an opentype codepoint for each of
    the glyphs you see, you are correct. Premier Pro is a huge character set, hard
    to imagine some are missing. What language do these glyphs appear in?\r\n\r\nChrisL"

      is Buddhism, so we do this a lot. The Premier Pro has many of the ones we need
      already, but not the underdots, at least not for the characters we want. Its
      \"floating accents\" include an underdot, but it only seems to work with certain
      characters.\r\n\r\nThe glyphs are definitely part of the Unicode mapping--I
      can produce them easily with other Unicode fonts.\r\n\r\nDavid"

  body: "Garamond Premier pro does have UC & lc o with dot underneath. But no h or
    d with dot underneath it. I just checked to be sure. \r\n\r\nI could build a font
    like that ( I just built a custom financial font yesterday for a firm in Chicago)
    or you could ask someone else here or evebn ask Adobe.\r\n\r\n<cite> simply adding
    an underdot or an overdot to an existing letter. </cite>\r\n\r\nI would like to
    suggest that the size & placement of the dot aught to be made in the thouful &
    careful way - ideally speaking.\r\n\r\nThe main question unanswered in the thread
    is do you know how to access the Unicode Glyph in your OS? I can explain how to
    do it in OSX on the Mac. I am not sure how to do it on Windows boxes - but I could
    figure it out. Probably by searching here on Typophile.\r\n\r\nOr maybe the texts
    come to you in Unicode & you just have to be able to set them.\r\n\r\nIs that
    it?\r\n\r\nWhat language is being set?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

      the metrics are somewhat tricky and can be more or less elegantly implemented.
      But for this kind of job, I think it should be relatively straightforward.\r\n\r\nI
      have no problem entering the Unicode characters on a Mac. Most of the manuscripts
      come in with the diacritics already entered, and the cross-platform convenience
      of a Unicode font will help our workflow greatly.\r\n\r\nDavid"

    relatively straightforward </cite>\r\n\r\nThat's a characterization I could beter
    agree with. Since it's going into print I just thought some degree of care, craft,
    and knowledge of typographic precedent was probably called for."

  body: "It is relatively easy to add the characters. Including them in the features
    & class files takes a little more time -- you should probably also have them in
    small capitals as well, and include all in the kerning work; this font does use
    class-based kerning.\r\n\r\nI have done the underdots in Adobe Garamond Pro (not
    Premier) for roman & italic; as I remember, it took me a couple of hours each
    font. Getting everything up to snuff for six fonts would likely take a day or
    so. BTW, I'm not offering to do the work -- we are a typesetting firm & don't
    do font work for anyone else -- just offering some personal experience.\r\n\r\nIt
    isn't hard, just involved.\r\n\r\n"
