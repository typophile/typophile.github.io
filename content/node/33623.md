body: "I am beginning to embark on my senior design thesis research. My school is
  shifting to a new journaling and process based approach to thesis development, so
  I neither have nor am allowed to have a concrete idea about where I want to go with
  this, just a loose focus. That focus is the connection between dreams, the imagination,
  the collective cultural wealth of world mythology, and how that ties into creativity
  and design. At the moment I am starting to consider with notions from Alan Fletcher,
  Neil Gaiman and Joseph Campbell. Along the way I also want to look at <em>The Golden
  Bough</em>, <em>Grimm\u2019s Fairy Tales</em>, and various incarnations of the <em>Arabian
  Nights Entertainments</em>. \r\n\r\nMy professors have already supplied me with
  a (huge) list of general materials that they want us to look at, but most of those
  are tied into modernism, something I am pretty sick of researching at this point
  as my school will keep beating the modernism horse until even the teeth have ground
  into powder. What suggestions do you have for books that might be helpful in researching
  dreams, myth, and design? Obscurity is not a problem\u2014I have access to the Library
  of Congress, several large universities, and a few other large public and private
  libraries here in Washington. Please limit the books to stuff in English, though,
  as it is shamefully the only language I can read in."

    Abecedarium\" by R A Firmage. And the spooky \"Sign & Design, The Psychogenetic
    Source of The Alphabet\" by A Kallir (which is hard to find). All three have given
    me a taste of/for the mysterious in type.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "This is a great subject to go for. \r\n\r\nI think the best link between
    \"the imagination, the collective cultural wealth of world mythology\" and design
    might be image schemas - the mind's skeleton maps of, in this context, imagined
    worlds, scenes or stories - their layout and their changes or movement through
    time. The importance in Romance of image schemas, both in the large (plots) and
    the small (verbal style that requires spatial processing*) are my big literary-theoretical
    interest, and Romance is of course as close as literature gets to myth. If you
    like, I could dredge up some papers - Michael Kimmel's stuff is probably closest
    to what you want - but you should read Mark Turner's reasonably good book 'The
    Literary Mind' first. It's not perfect, but it's the best one-volume synthesis
    there is right now.\r\n\r\nThree different structuralist approaches to All Stories,
    all hoary ancients but in at least two cases disappointingly not superseded, are
    Thompson's 'The Folktale', Propp's 'Morphology of the Folktale', and Frye's 'Anatomy
    of Criticism'. Of these, Thompson is an irreproachable collector of story motifs,
    and I don't know whether there's a more recent equivalent. Propp was a kind of
    better Campbell; though he's endlessly gestured at by academics, he's never been
    torn apart and rewritten despite some obvious flaws. For my money the Anatomy
    remains the most inspiring single book on literature, and half of it is a grand
    breakdown of all mythoi that cries out for reconstitution in image schematic terms.
    Again, Frye acknowledges that his account is preliminary, but in his case no one
    had the courage to fine-tune it before he went completely out of fashion. \r\n\r\n*http://cogprints.org/3239/01/Aspects%5Fof%5FCognitive%5FPoeti.html
    is an introduction to his own work by Reuven Tsur, who specialises in the effects
    and affects not of whole stories but of specific phrases and passages requiring
    spatial imagination. I think he's wonderful; does that kind of thing interest
    you too? If so, his 'Toward a Theory of Cognitive Poetics' is crucial: it's much
    cheaper ordered from his website."

  body: "I think there is a danger here of focusing too much on narrative, and getting
    lost in literary theory or philosophy. Stefan Sagmeister argues <a href=\"http://www.sagmeister.com/students3.html\">here</a>,
    that graphic design generally doesn't tell a story. It provides an image that
    has certain emotional connotations. Sagmeister says on his site somewhere that
    he thinks that novels and movies can be richer emotionally because of it, and
    that's a limitation of graphic design. \r\n\r\nThere are evocative images related
    to all religions and traditions of course, but that is a different matter. The
    iconic images are also related to more basic human experience, such as our it
    seems innate ability to recognize parts of the human body, such as faces. Frutiger's
    book 'Signs and Symbols' explores this. \r\n\r\nOne of the most important things
    in developing your ideas is to move from a general focus to a specific problem
    or question. Reading will help this, if you take finding a specific question as
    your goal. An example would be, 'Do proportions of the human body influence design?
    How?' 'Are archetypal shapes derived from nature or innate to the mind?' 'Does
    religion inspire creativity or inhibit it?' \r\n\r\nI'm not saying these are great
    or what you would be interested in. Just that seeking a specific question or problem
    will give you a sharper focus, and you then will be able to better learn from
    your research. And, not less important, finish it in a timely manner. "

    getting lost in literary theory or philosophy.</cite>\r\n\r\nI have the same concern,
    but I would rather risk losing my way than just churn out another cookie-cutter
    thesis about modernism. I see stuff bubbling under the surface of design\u2014primal
    ideas, creativity that\u2019s the stuff of dreams, stuff that transcends just
    making a personal mantra out of \u201Cless is more.\u201D I think this is rooted
    in my objection to the notion that design starts with modernism; this is all part
    of my exploration of the notion that designers have more in common with Michaelangelo
    than most people realize. And when I really start poking around I see it all going
    back a lot farther than the Renaissance, at the least to the days when <strong>A</strong>
    meant cow.\r\n\r\nMaybe we aren\u2019t always telling stories, but we\u2019re
    still communicating big ideas, and those ideas start out as a dreams in somebodys
    head. And there\u2019s a lot more to creativity than ideas randomly springing
    to life\u2014inspiration assumes the presence of something inspiring, thus a new
    idea is a synthesis of old ones.\r\n\r\nFortunately I have a lot of time to get
    this ball rolling and stop it somewhere solid. And if it lands somewhere too weird,
    well, by the time I get graded on it it will not affect my financial aid anymore."

  body: ">another cookie-cutter thesis about modernism\r\n\r\nOh, I see where you
    are coming from now. As far as I am concerned, modernism is just another style.
    Those who make it into politics or religion--which it was for some of its founders--are
    just way off base. The key thing about taking it too seriously is that is dogmatic,
    and says that that is the only way to solve visual problems. \r\n\r\nThe idea
    of making graphic design functional was already there. Also outside type and graphic
    design I think modernism is pretty much a disaster. Within graphic design--because
    it naturally needs the grid--it worked much better, and brought sans to the fore
    in a new way. \r\n\r\nBut the theory of creativity is a thing in itself, and is
    basically the theory of problem-solving. \r\n\r\nI would suggest you look at the
    wonderful recent work of <a href=\"http://bantjes.com/\">Marian Bantjes</a>, who
    is blowing the doors off modernist prejudice against ornament by doing it so freshly
    and delightfully. And why don't you ask her what moved her to leap out of the
    modernist straight jacket? And what she'd suggest. I bet she'll have some great
    ideas. "
