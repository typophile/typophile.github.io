body: "Hello! I've been looking for a digital version of AI Corporate/Corporate Image
  for a long time and it seems I've long missed my window with Roc Mitchell's official
  digitizations Logotext and Logostyle since his website no longer exists and the
  phone numbers I've found associated with his company's Texas address don't work.\r\n\r\nI
  know there exists an Opti version, Limited View, based on Dan X. Solo's collection,
  and AV Perth made a pretty close digitization as well, AV05 Logotype, but I'd like
  to improve mine (New Era Software). I'm unable to find a copy of Alphabet Innovations
  Collection vol.4 (1971/1972), which AV Perth cites as demonstrating both Corporate
  and Corporate Image. Would anyone here know where I may obtain either a decent quality
  copy of this book and/or the phototype itself and/or Mitchell's digitizations in
  2017?"

    able to get in contact with him. Unfortunately, hardcopies seem to have been lost
    in a shuffle during moving about a decade ago and locations of digital copies
    are unknown.\r\n\r\nRe \"Corporate-Normal\" - currently that seems to be Corporate
    URW++, but that's not the variant I'm searching for."

    selecting "Spam" sometimes hides the post from view, but AFAICT there is no further
    action taken and the spam reappears just the same next time I log in! Is that
    button really supposed to do 'nothing'?)

    body: I have noticed the spam problem you describe. It seems to be useless to
      report it because from what I can see no one is paying attention.

  body: Agreed on the spam issue. I'm a little concerned because I'm getting ready
    to release a font soon and want to make a couple threads, but don't want legit
    posts to be buried by said spam.

  body: "Hi there Alex,\r\n\r\nI also attempted to contact Roc way back when I first
    posted about his Corporate/Logos typeface on the DaFont forums. Glad to see you
    got a reply but also sad to hear that there is still no way to purchase his 1999
    digitization. My experiment on FontStruct was merely to see if it were possible
    to reconstruct that style of typeface within the limitations of the block/grid
    system. It is in no way an accurate replication of his original type as I was
    unable to properly reproduce the letterforms. It took a lot of FontStruct hair-pulling
    trickery just to get it as close as I did.\r\n\r\nI'd also like to mention that
    Quad Typographers, Inc. (New York) seem to have copied or licensed Alphabet Innovations
    typefaces around 1974. Their versions of Corporate and Corp Image were titled
    Limited and Limited View - which may explain the naming of Dan X. Solo's Solotype
    Catalog sample. I've still no definite answer on who originated the stencilled
    version known as Preview (later digitized as Airlock by Computer Safari). Unfortunately,
    I don't have any Alphabet Innovations catalogs but would also love to see scans
    of Vol. 4 if possible. The California Historical Society displayed some of Vol.
