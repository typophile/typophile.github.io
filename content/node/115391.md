body: "Hello everyone!\r\n\r\nI have the following text layout problem in InDesign
  CS6 and CC for Mac. Text is typed with Times New Roman. Some vowels have stresses
  placed with the symbol Combining Acute Accent (Unicode 0301). This is the common
  character for the stress in Cyrillic texts. When I choose to automatically hyphenate
  text the hyphen shifts down if it appears after the stressed letter. This happens
  when you select the Hunspell hyphenation dictionary and text is marked as Russian.
  Everything works perfect with English text.\r\nSo the question is: What is the cause
  of the problem, is it in the Adobe software or in the font? What could be changed
  in TNR to make it work properly?\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\n<img>http://typophile.com/files/2zfr728.jpg</img>"

  body: Yes, of course. Other fonts work properly but they do not have 'mark' and
    'mkmk' OT features. I suspect these features might be the cause but I am not sure.

  body: "It would be the mis-use of the features if they are causing a problem. I
    can't think how to test this, since the discretionary hyphen is inserted automatically.
    \r\n\r\nExcept maybe... You could do this: put in a hair space following the letter
    that you want the hyphen appearing, and put in, by hand, a discretionary hyphen
    after the hair space, then force the work to break there by adding text in front,
    so the word has to break. If that works OK, then you know some silly sod has made
    a mistake with mark or mkmk in the font."

  body: "Charles, thanks but your suggestion doesn't help much. Here is what happens.\r\n1.
    Inserting hair space before Combining Acute Accent gives stressed space (both
    English and Cyrillic). The stress is shifted up and right in this case:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Hyphen_1_3503.jpg]\r\n\r\n2.
    Inserting hair space after Combining Acute Accent doesn't allow to hyphenate the
    word:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Hyphen_2_4925.jpg]\r\n\r\n3. Inserting
    discretional hyphen right after Combining Acute Accent manually makes the trick
    but we need autohyphenation.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Hyphen_3_3947.jpg]\r\n"

  body: "<blockquote>2. Inserting hair space after Combining Acute Accent doesn't
    allow to hyphenate the word:</blockquote>\r\n\r\nAs Frode said, perhaps... \r\n\r\nI
    was suggesting this as a way to debug, to see if mark or even mkmk was somehow
    attached to the discretionary hyphen. Adding the thin space blocks the character
    sequence with the U+0301 accent, putting in a manual discretionary hyphen (in
    InDesign) should allow the word to break there -- within InDesign, of course.
    But it seems InDesign will not break after white space, in spite of the discretionary
    hyphen.\r\n\r\nBut this is the build forum, and you maybe have a font editor?
    \ If so, debug as you would anything -- my way is to add one instruction at a
    time until you find the problem. "
