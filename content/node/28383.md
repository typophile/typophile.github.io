  opinion, it would be nice to have it at the top of the thread, too.  "

    visited place and it's annoying to wait all the attached pictures load and finally
    page stays still.\r\n\r\nMarc I think it's natural to read from top to bottom
    rather than the opposite. It would be really annoying if I had to start reading
    new thread from the last page.\r\n\r\n___________\r\nAL\r\nwww.lenart.pl"

  body: "Typophile.com's homepage shows new threads only, next to \"hottest\" and
    \"handpicked\". It would be useful to have a quick overview of the most recent
    posts on all of the forums, as well, even the older ones. Furthermore, I second
    the suggestions made above.\r\n\r\nThe website is quite often hanging: is this
    only temporarily? Are you preparing for a server upgrade?\r\n\r\nAnyhow, congratulations
    to the designers and builders of this website. I never participated in online
    forums before, just sticking to good-old mailing lists, because most of the time
    they injure my typographic feelings. Typophile.com is however, beautifully designed
    and it's a pleasure to read and navigate through it."

    I'd like to be taken to the second page of posts rather than the first. That's
    my biggest pet peeve, but as Willy Wonka might say to me, "Well, you're just happy
    to be here!"

    the "go to new" feature only works for a one-page thread. As soon as it has overflowed

    the way it works for me (Windows/Opera). '

    the point in having the first post of the thread plus various other things appearing
    under the editing box. Also a little disorientating.
