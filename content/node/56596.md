    I need something softer.'

  body: "Well I'd say that Goudy Old Style is rather soft than spiky...\r\nAnd you
    do have a hard time choosing serifs here since this particular R is a bit serify...\r\n\r\nI'd
    check [[http://www.josbuivenga.demon.nl/fertigo.html|Fertigo Pro]] even if it's
    not a serif font. It does have a lot of serif details and stroke. They may go
    together well. And I think it's also soft enough. ;)\r\n___________\r\n<em>Robert
