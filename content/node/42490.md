  its automatic ascent and descent values in addition to the worse job it does plugging
  in the additional values for OS2 and HHEA values . . .\r\n\r\nTo add insult to injury
  I continue to get the Ascent/Descent output error that John Hudson wrote about extensively
  . . .\r\n\r\nSo, the question remains, is this a FLAB5 problem that they will resolve
  in future builds or has somebody create a sweet sweet Python Script that can do
  a competent job of this work?\r\n\r\nKindly advise fellow builders . . .\r\nStuart

  body: "It should be fairly easy to script this. But one might actually want a couple
    of different scripts depending on the approach one intended to take to the linespacing
    issue:\r\n\r\n\r\nMETHOD 1 (in which all vertical metrics sum to equivalent values)\r\n\r\nThe
    WinAscent value and WinDescent values can be set to the actual vertical bounding
    box height and depth (this is, by the way, Adobe' recommendation). I have a script
    that Adam wrote for me that finds the tallest and deepest glyphs in a font, and
    it strikes me that it would be easy to then write these values to the relevant
    metrics fields.\r\n\r\nFor the additional OS/2 and hhea values, you would first
    want to set the Ascender and Descender values in the Key Dimensions font info
    dialogue correctly. For a Latin font, these can be calculated from the ascent
    of the d and descent of the p. In a non-Latin font without Latin codepage support,
    these values would need to be manually set.\r\n\r\nThe TypoAscender and TypoDescender
    values can be calculated by first summing the key dimension ascender and descender
    values--<em>treating all values as positive</em>--and subtracting this value from
    the UPM value. The difference should then be equally split and added to the key
    dimension Ascender and Descender values to come up with the OS/2 TypoAscender
    and TypoDescender values, i.e. the latter should sum to the UPM.\r\n\r\nThe TypeLineGap
    value can then be calculated by summing the WinAscent and WinDescent values and
    subtracting the UPM value.\r\n\r\nThe hhea values can me set in one of two ways,
    and it would probably be best to have an option dialogue or a separate script.
    They can either match the OS/2 Typo values, or the hhea Ascender and Descender
    settings can match the OS/2 WinAscent and WinDescent with the hhea LineGap value
    set to 0 (zero).\r\n\r\n\r\nMETHOD 2 (presuming setting of OS/2 version 4 fsSelection
    bit7, i.e. with idependent Typo and Win values)\r\n\r\nOS/2 WinAscent and WinDescent
    values and the OS/2 TypoAscender and TypoDescender values are determined in the
    same way as in Method 1. The OS/2 TypoLineGap value is then set to a discretionary
    value to determine desirable linespacing in apps that respect the fsSelection
    bit 7 setting. As a default value, a script could set this value to 20% of the
    UPM, thereby implying 2pts of leading for 10pt text.\r\n\r\nIn Method 2 it would
    be typical for the hhea values to mirror the OS/2 Typo values.\r\n\r\n\r\nSince
    FontLab is not currently able to set any of the OS/2 version 4 bits, requiring
    post production table hacking with e.g. TTX, a Method 1 script would probably
    serve the majority of FontLab users for the time being.\r\n\r\n"
