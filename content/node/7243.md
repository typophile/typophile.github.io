  were interested in reviving the Deberny #16/17/18, and we were considering working
  on it together. Well, thanks to Gerald Lange I have now found a pretty decent sample
  of the full alphanumerics, and some text. Please let me know if you&#39;re still
  interested in co-reviving this fabulous face. I think it&#39;s pretty unique &#40;especially
  the italic, which to me is the best slanted-Roman ever made&#41; and it would fill
  a nice void in the typographic spectrum. <BR> <BR>-- <BR> <BR>If Chris doesn&#39;t
  get in touch with me about this by the end of the year, I would like to open the
  door to anybody else who might want to work on this instead. <BR> <BR>hhp'

  body: Yum. I&#39;m certainly interested in tracking the progress, if nothing else.
    <BR> <BR>You mentioned Bodoni and Baskerville in the thread, but I also see traces
    of Walbaum, especially in designs such as the &#39;a&#39; and to a lesser extent
    the &#39;e&#39;.

    year ago now. <BR> <BR>Yes, I&#39;m still interested.

  body: 'Cool. Let&#39;s do it. <BR>I just sent an email to Amelia Hugill-Fontanel
    &#40;see other thread&#41; to see if she can help. <BR> <BR>Did you get my email?
    I sent it to the address in your Typophile profile. Assuming that&#39;s still
    working, we now have each other&#39;s email, so we can continue in private&#42;.
    We need to figure out what sales channel&#42;&#42; &#40;if any&#41; the font will
    end up in, who&#39;s going to do what, etc. <BR> <BR>&#42; Otherwise here&#39;s
    my email: hrant_thatsymbol_inverselogic_dot_corn <BR> <BR>&#42;&#42; Hey Veer,
    game?  :-&#41; <BR> <BR>On the other hand, it might be useful to ask something
    of Typophilers: <BR>How literal versus &#34;modernized&#34; do you think this
    revival should be? <BR> <BR>Raph: <BR>We&#39;ll keep you posted, for sure. <BR>

  body: Yeah, I got the email, that&#39;s what lead me here.  I haven&#39;t checked
    the boards in a couple months.  For some reason I keep saying I&#39;ll check later
    and never wind up doing it, even though the bookmark is right there with all my
    other frequently viewed sites. <BR> <BR>I know, I&#39;m bad like that. <BR> <BR>As
    far as sales, I personally would prefer to release it for free as there is a dearth
    of good free text fonts out there, but that&#39;s just me.  If not, Veer would
    be fine, or Emigre if they would take it. <BR> <BR>For a first time digital revision
    of an old face I&#39;d say to keep it as close as possible to the original

  body: I wish I could justify releasing free fonts! :-/ <BR>But once we&#39;re far
    enough ahead we can shop it around then choose a channel together. <BR> <BR>&#62;
    keep it as close as possible to the original <BR> <BR>Sounds right to me. I would
    like to fix some small strangenesses though - things that harm it technically
    more than help it aesthetically. <BR> <BR>OK, I&#39;ll email you in private real
    soon... <BR> <BR>hhp
