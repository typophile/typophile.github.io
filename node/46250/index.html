<div class="post-content e-content" itemprop=articleBody>So I have done a 15 min Google and Forum search on what is the Best Practices on sharing fonts. Nada. Generally I don't do share font files, period. I usually have partners and vendors purchase their own license. But i would like some further insight and opinions and maybe a definitive answer or two.
here is the scenario.
Acme™ purchased a Full license of Typeface A
AoR purchased a Full license of Typeface A
Media Partner of AoR and Acme needs fonts to simply EDIT a legacy Rich Media placement on a high profile website.
Media Partner request Font Files from AoR for Rich Media production developer. Both AoR and Media Partner are actually owned by the same Global Holding company.
confused yet? i would bet this is a fairly common occurrence.
It seems a waste of $100-$500 to buy a license for something that will be used for 5 mins, and published for 4-5 days. And and of which two other entities have already purchased font licenses for the same original document. All that will happen is Website will invoice Media, Media will Invoice Acme™, and Acme™ ends up paying twice for the same license, and if this happens 2-3 a month, it could be 20-30 times a year they pay for the same license over and over.

<div class=commentbody>I think this is likely a common scenario. I can imagine something like this might have happened when Apple used those fake quotes in a Flash ad’ a <a href=http://www.typophile.com/node/41043>while back</a> - with an angry client breathing down your neck you want to get the problem fixed quickly, and keep your job.
Basic EULA answer is that fonts are rarely licensed corporation-wide, and most licenses restrict font use to a single company at a single site - so unless these entities are all in the same building then loaning a license is going to be outside the terms of the EULA.
In the real world however there are probably three options…
1. media partner licenses the fonts.
2. media partner uses unlicensed versions of the fonts and then deletes them (no one would ever know).
3. media partner uses unlicensed versions of the fonts and keeps them.
As for the same people licensing the same fonts again and again – that’s really how the font business has always worked, isn’t it?
What might be more sensible long-term is for the holding company to use a central group for font licensing, where special rights and permissions can be negotiated from font vendors to accommodate this type of scenario legally.

<div class=commentbody><em>to simply EDIT</em>
What you're describing is not editing, but typography.
You can't do typography without fonts.
Therefore you should use licensed fonts.
If these corporations choose to weave a complex web of ownership, they should be able to figure out how to license the fonts they use in an efficient manner!
I don't mean to pick on large corporations, for they are generally straight shooters and good clients when it comes to font licensing.
They do however, get a lot of breaks from foundries, in particular reduced per-terminal licence fees for multiple terminals.

<div class=commentbody>sii -
There is always option 4 - give the file back to the original designer and have them make the changes. BTW - outside designers becoming typography houses could probably charge a minimal fee for an editorial change...
And sii - as a typographer - we would buy a font from the manufacturer of our equipment - if it was a royalty font - we'd pay an additional 30 bucks for each weight in royalty fees - then it was ours to do what we wanted with. But please note, it was only good for our equipment... and that's the way it use to work.</div>

Updating an online file is not, of course, the same as changing a print piece.
However, the expectation that text changes can be made "sight unseen" without adverse consequences may not always work out.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Yep 4. would have been the obvious answer - assumed there was some kind of blocker there.
Back to the original question...
>EDIT a legacy Rich Media placement
If the source files for the “Rich Media placement”, let’s say it’s an animated .GIF, supported embedded fonts then theoretically the font files could be legally included with the sources to allow for future editing and re-generation of the .GIF. However, most fonts are set to “print & preview embedding” - so it wouldn't have been helpful without a license upgrade.
That comes back to Nick's point - editing is functionality that should be paid for.
