  to be similar to Futura but it also needs to be softer than Futura.\r\n\r\nWhat
  are the differences in feel between Futura, [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/dtptypes/graphicus-dt/regular/charmap.html|Graphicus
  DT Regular]], and [[http://www.bvfonts.com/fonts/details.php?id=45|Print Clearly
  Bold]]?\r\n\r\n\r\nI really appreciate your help! Thanks in advance!!\r\n"

  body: Graphicus DT appears very similar to Futura; it seems to be a tad wider and
    the A,M,W are flattened on the top and bottom whereas in Futura they have points.  Also,
    the j has a slight curve at the bottom instead of just a straight line, and the
    descender on the g is less harshly geometric and more open.  Print Clearly is
    narrower than Futura and appears to have a rounded stroke.  Also, the I, J, and
    1 have serifs to make them more distinguishable.  I'm not an expert, but I hope
    that helps.
