  typography, so this is quite new for me and i would love to get another opinion
  on this.\r\n\r\nthis is a photographer that deals with photojounalism on one side,
  and artistic nude and foot fetish photography on the other side. \r\nthe key words
  were \"bold, lacks inhibition, but also sophisticated, sexy, and sensous\"\r\ntherefor
  i searched for bold and italic fonts like \r\n\"bauer bodoni black italic\" which
  really gave me that kind of feeling.\r\n\r\ni showed the client a type test with
  some 50 fonts related to that style, and we agreed on the bauer bodoni combined
  with the \"F\" letter of \"Benguiat\" font.\r\nalong the way i noticed seceral problems
  like \"il\" letters and the \"fi\" ligature, so i tried to work it out.\r\n\r\ni
  would like to get a critique for a logotype, especially concerning kerning and typo
  :)\r\ni can't change the font because of tight schedule, but i would like to hear
  your opinion on my font choice.\r\n\r\nthanks alot,\r\nYaronimus\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/logo

  body: "Of your options the bottom one is working best \u2013 it definitely needs
    a ligature, although the word space is a touch wide and the Ye could be a touch
    tighter.\r\n\r\nIf you wanted to push it further Stilla might be an option, the
    E+F cut has an fi ligature\r\n\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/ef/stilla/\r\n\r\nTim"

    the option just above. Nice work with the fi.\r\n\r\nPdub"

  body: "thank you very much tim and Pdub.\r\n\r\ntim -  when you say \"word space\"
    which word do you meen exactly? \r\nstilla is cool, but a bit too funky for my
    client. \r\n\r\nPdub - that's funny, well, maybe because english is my second
    laguage i feel that the Il looks like LL which is confusing. doesn't an IL ligature
    in this type affect legibility? isn't this a problem in english?\r\n\r\nanother
    question - isn't the logo a bit too long?\r\nmaybe a sub line with something like
    \"art & press photography\" would be better for the logo?\r\n\r\nthanks!"

  body: "Yaron, \r\nI meant the space between Ilia and Yefimovich, my feeling is that
    given the tight kerning of the names that space is just too wide.\r\n\r\nAs for
    the logo being too long, it might present a problem \u2013 at a small size you
    might need to look at a more spaced version at the smaller (business card) sizes.
    I think adding a strap line would give you a hefty block which could be clumsy
    to work with in a layout. \r\n\r\nTim"
