    having a custom font designed: nobody else can use it. <BR>Can&#39;t be helped.'

  body: Uh-uh, that&#39;s probably a misunderstanding from Lars. <BR>This typeface
    has never been made available to the  <BR>general public. If a preview image is
    all you need to  <BR>make, use <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/metro-2/"
    target="_blank"> Metro</a> | <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/bitstream/geometric-415/"
    target="_blank"> Geometric 415</a> for now.
