  deleted a thread created by <a href=\"http://www.typophile.com/user/17243\">Jan</a>.
  Sorry!\r\n\r\nCan I take this opportunity to ask that you don't post snarky remarks
  and/or images of spam to denote spam being posted. It just creates more work for
  the moderators. Thank you."

    the <em>obscene</em> amount of spam that hit Typophile today? I'm betting it took
    the entire team of moderators to wipe 'em all.\r\n\r\n.. Hey, wait, are you volunteering
    to screen new members? Now there's a worthwhile suggestion!"

  body: "It was a post to inform the mods/admins of a spammer who had posted loads
    all over Typohile within hours. I had the impression that immediate action was
    necessary. Deleted? No prob. But I wasn\u2019t snarky at all (and didn\u2019t
    post any images of spam either). How this creates any more work for the moderators
    I can\u2019t understand. But I won\u2019t do it again if you wish."

    someone else. Not you, not at all. I actually meant to post in the thread that
    I removed all the spam. '

    an email address gets checked, and such? That would help, I think.\r\n\r\nAnd
    to Mr Clark: I did some moderating work in the days when this was not yet called
    the Internet and that makes me very much respect the work the gals and guys here
    do. (And if they need someone to pitch in, I am in the CET-time zone and willing
    to do some cleaning).\r\n\r\n. . .\r\nBert Vanderveen BNO"
