  body: Ya, Its just the capitals that don't match up... and the D. I agree that it
    probably custom. I love the shape of the R and that doesn't seem to match the
    two suggestions at all. I wonder where that came from. Hmmmmm. thanks for the
    response.

  body: I've always heard the logo is based on old tool company logos. That's probably
    where the inpiration came from, a custom logotype, not a contemporary font.

    You could ask them but I'm pretty sure it's custom.
