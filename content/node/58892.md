  body: "Hi,\r\n\r\nthis is based on Caslon Black Swash. Digital revivals that come
    to mind are Jason Walcott's <em>Cabernet Swash</em> (available at Veer) and Nick
    Curtis's <em>Emfatick</em> (available at Myfonts), none of which seems to be a
    <em>perfect</em> match to your sample, though (compare the crossbar on the T or
    the stems of the E and R, for example), but they might serve as a starting point
    for further search.\r\n\r\nJens"
