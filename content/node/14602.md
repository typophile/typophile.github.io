    topic over in General Discussions, where I figured more people would see it: http://typophile.com/node/14606\r\n\r\nSi,
    when you say the ISO version will cover everything in 1.4, does that include the
    appendices. I've never been very clear about whether the appendices, including
    the layout feature tags and descriptions, were considered normative or informative.
    Some seem obviously informative, e.g. the WGL4 character set and the 'TrueType
    fundamentals' appendix. But others seem at least quasi-normative unless one takes
    the view that OpenType Layout is an implementation of the spec rather than part
    of the format (which seems a legitimate view: I'm just not sure how MS and Adobe
    view OTL)."
