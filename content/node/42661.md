  body: "<a href=\"http://typographica.org/000931.php\">Yes,  it is.</a>\r\n\r\nMy
    guess as to why Jan and Yves don't love it: there are scores of typefaces in this
    genre that are better, especially in print. That said, I'm happy to see it replace
    the old \"typeface\" on U.S. highway signs."

  body: Isn't Clearview the new typeface they're starting to use on the road signs
    on highways? it's supposed to be visible from 20% further away. I think I've seen
    in in connecticut...

  body: "> ClearviewText and ClearviewHwy are NOT the same.\r\n\r\nThat's true. But
    the design idea was born as a solution to a particular problem, highway signage.
    And it does that very well. It's a decent sans serif for print. I just prefer
    a few others in this style.\r\n\r\n> Such as?\r\n\r\n[[FF Meta]]\r\nMyriad\r\n[[FF

  body: It looks a bit clunky; the overall proportions and shape relations all seem
    slightly out of balance. I really like clunky typefaces though -- this is just
    not the right kind of clunkiness.
