body: I posted a query to the InDesign <a href="http://www.adobeforums.com/cgi-bin/webx/.3bc20e3d"
  target="_blank">forum</a> but to no concrete avail. Anyone know an easy way to add
  vertical (left/right) rules to a paragraph? Stuffing the copy into a table with
  a left/right stroke doesn't work if the text is more than a page long (InD can't
  "flow" a table cell across 2 frames), and I'd like to avoid simply adding rules
  manually as text-flow isn't finalized and thus things are going to move around a
  bit. Seems that it shouldn't be much more complicated than horizontal rules, but...

  body: "It actually is <em>a lot</em> more complicated than horizontal rules.\r\n\r\nI'm
    an avid user of paragraph rules, and though I've managed to come up with some
    pretty unorthodox stuff before (see my <em>Paragraph Rules</em> tutorials soon
    on <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.be/\">Unzipped</a> and <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/fontfeed/\">The
    FontFeed</a>) there is to my knowledge <em>no way</em> to achieve  vertical rules
    that match the height of paragraphs.\r\n\r\nThe easiest way to make a vertical
    rule is to define a very short, very heavy rule: a 1pt wide 24pt thick horizontal
    rule is -- indeed -- a vertical 1pt rule that is 24pt long. To make the rule only
    1pt wide, specify an indent from right that is 1pt less than the column width.
    Elementary my dear Watson.\r\n\r\nNow the main problem is that <em>Paragraph Rules</em>
    are attached to the <em>paragraphs</em> -- you can position one in relation to
    the first line of the paragraph and one in relation to the last line. How many
    lines the paragraph counts has no effect at all. So even so it's possible to specify
    vertical rules next to both the first and the last line in the paragraph, it's
    impossible to specify a vertical rule next to all the other lines. The only way
    to do so would be to convert every line of text to a single paragraph by using
    hard returns, but this completely negates what you want to achieve, as you explained
    text flow isn't finalised.\r\n\r\nSo I'm really sorry, but to my knowledge what
    you want to do is impossible. :^/"

  body: "Hi Jason\r\n\r\nYour question puzzled me so I had a look. I think it might
    help to reverse the relationship of the para attributes and do this in two parts;
    \r\n\r\n1. Make your 'side' rules on the master page as continuous vertical lines
    top to bottom at either side of your text column area. This would mean they are
    behind your text and para attributes.\r\n\r\n2. Use paragraph rules in the text
    flow \u2013 but heavy white ones to <em> mask </em> the background vertical rules.
    The white para rules can occupy as much vertical space as your inter-para spacing,
    and be made to extend beyond the column width by being set with negative integers
    on the indent.\r\n\r\nOf course this method assumes a white paper colour and/or
    absence of background tint/colour/imagery. Here's a screen grab to explain better.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/white-rules-mask_5235.jpg]"

  body: "Hey Ben (& Yves),\r\n\r\nYour solution makes sense and won't be too hard
    to implement. Of course, I have a bunch of headings, subheads, etc., to deal with,
    all of which I'll want to mask the rules you suggested, but that's a small matter.
    I suppose, as Yves mentioned, the trick will be to make sure that my \"mask\"
    rules are exactly the height of the styles they're added to, so that I don't have
    tiny bits of vertical rule showing through. I'll also likely move the vertical
    rules slightly inside the text frame, as I've had vector objects shift ever so
    slightly during RIP at the printer.\r\n\r\nThanks for the suggestion, and hopefully
    a simpler method will be introduced in future InDesign releases..."

  body: "Thankyou Yves!\r\n\r\nAh yes I didn't allow for headings and subheads. \r\n\r\nIt
    occurs to me that these could be dealt with on a separate layer, perhaps with
    white text box backgrounds for the masking or as a massively baseline-shifted
    part of the first line of the paragraph style if you want to keep everything on
    one layer.. ie. if your leading is 15pt and the white para rule is masking 45pts
    of inter-para spacing (three lines), then a subhead can be baseline shifted another
    lines' worth, 15pt upwards from the first line of para to appear in front of that
    masked 45pts of space.\r\n\r\nYou'll need to experiment with this..."

  body: "I have another thought. I haven't played with it extensively, so it might
    not be practical over long texts, but it will certainly stick with the paragraph.\r\n\r\nTry
    using the anchored object. Create a line with the line tool (draw it vertically
    obviously) and then create an anchored object box and attach it to the first letter
    of your paragraph. Paste the line into the anchored box. If you align the top
    of the abchored frame to the Cap height, the line should start at the right spot,
    and then you can adjust the length of it.\r\n\r\nI'll try and post my screen shot.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/anchorobject
    copy_5491.jpg]\r\n\r\nI believe it's possible to simply copy and paste that basic
    anchored object at the beginning of every paragraph where you want a vertical
    side rule so that the box width and the settings remain the same each time. You
    will most likely have to adjust the length of the rule, though.\r\n\r\nK.\r\n"

    and masking it out with Paragraph Rules\r\n\r\nExcellent workaround, but I found
    that using the Underscore Option in Paragraph Styles worked even better because
    - once the weight and offset were set effectively - it applied to paragraphs of
    any number of lines."
