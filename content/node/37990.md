  body: "well hm of course an image, this would certain help\r\ni am paranoid about
    this\r\ni dont want to show it before i am ready\r\ni am afraid its silly\r\nthis
    boxer guy is more kind of an oldfashioned heavy italo hero \r\nwith very long
    shorts and extrem strong hands\r\na nice guy with a black eye \r\nafter the 12th
    round \r\ni think he won\r\nits abstract but children have to recognize him instantly\r\n\r\nknockout
