body: "Hi Everyone,\r\nGreetings from Indonesia... I'm a newbie here!! i've  found
  \"typofile\" website not so long ago...and i'm very excited to meet and learn from
  everyone here...\r\nI am currently doing a branding for my new small business...and
  it's a coffeeshop. I've been using a font called Engravers MT for the main logo,
  and apparently i've struggled to find another font to support my coffeeshop branding
  ( to be used as a header / body text in business card, etc) \r\nCould anyone suggest
  me what font would be suitable for Engravers MT's companion? \r\n\r\n\r\nThanks
  a bunch!! xx\r\n<!--break-->\r\n"
