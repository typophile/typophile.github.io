  don't need the specific one) \u2013 a bold headline face that has swash versions

    and [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/dstype/leitura-sans/grot-4/characters.html|Leitura]]
    have a few terminal swashes.\r\n\r\nVista Sans has some much more modest swashes

    Tankard's <a href=\"http://www.typography.net/type/font/aspect\">Aspect</a> might
    just be the most crazily swashed sans ever. It's more playful overall though.\r\nAlso,
    JFP's <a href=\"http://www.typofonderie.com/alphabets/view/ParisinePlusPTF\">Parisine
    has a \"Plus\" variant</a> with some nice swashes and ligatures."
