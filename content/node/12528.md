    body: Thanks but that's not right. For example, the S on my sample has no serifs
      on the ends, but Baskerville does.

  body: "<a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/berling/\">Berling</a> is
    also close but not exact, especially the lower serifs on L and E, there is the
    strong possibility that the signage is based on a \"font\" that is specific to
    the medium, I assume there are limits to which metal can be created in three-dimensions
    and that a letterform would be designed to cope with the material and production.
    However, I've been wrong in the past.\r\nTim"

  body: Furthermore, signage lettering is often not based exactly on a specific font,
    or at least not one that is commercially available.
