  and hi to all.  <BR> <BR>I&#39;m creating a traditional Christmas Card this year.
  And i want a beautiful Script font but I don&#39;t want it to be your average everyday
  Script font. Does that make sense? Any recommendations? <BR> <BR>Thankies, <BR>tammi '

    TARGET="_top">Salmiak</A> looked lovely on our cards last year. <BR> <BR>We made
    a rubber stamp and hit scraps of leftover <BR>paper found about the office for
    cheap cards. <BR> <BR>Now I&#39;m reading that you are doing something &#34;traditional&#34;,
    <BR>so maybe I&#39;m not helping at all. But enjoy Salmiak, nonetheless.

  body: coles is showing off again. an interesting script, though somewhat cumbersome,
    is aquiline. the kerning is terrible. also, um, unique, is @$$wipe. but maybe
    not what you&#39;re looking for. <BR><IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/30/3181.jpg"
