  a bunch of old (handwritten) letters and poems from my grandfather to my grandmother,
  along with pictures of them throughout the years. My inspiration behind this design
  is this album cover: http://www.fixtstore.com/img/graphics/tyronewells/TyroneWells_MetalandWood.jpg\r\n\r\nLet
  me know if you like it or think it could work..."

    I think that the period and your grandfather\u2019s own handwriting should be
    your first inspiration."

  body: from the 40's to the 90's roughly. The book is also going to include handwritten
    stuff by me...

  body: in other words there isn't one period or style throughout the whole book,
    even with his writing

  body: I think it's working. One thing that bothers me is the way the tail of the
    first e goes way up higher than the crossbar of the t.

  body: It's hard to say without knowing more about your concept for the book, or
    seeing the material; I too think it looks nice in itself, but it does feel quite
    contemporary, which may or may not work with the older material.

  body: Thanks guys, I appreciate your feedback. They are a little quirky since they
    are all quick sketches, but I wanted to make sure I wasn't crazy in thinking they
    sort of worked.
