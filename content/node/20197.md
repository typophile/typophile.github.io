  body: 'very cool. i love this kind of thing. auto ligs should work with PostScript
    fonts if named properly. (I''m not sure if this is just standard ligatures or
    any ligatures that are named using the x_x syntax, does anyone know?) If you are
    generating OpenType fonts, you will need to do the OT programming to get ligatures
    to form automatically. '

      and now Chester from thirst is helping me out getting them to work. Keep you
      posted - maybe you can help me test it- & feeedback after you put it to use.

  body: "I like it but there is something optically wrong with the lower case s.\r\nI
    know it suits and mimicks the upper case s and has the curl of q etc. \r\nBut
    as is the only letter that has carry on linkage, it leaves it inconsistant \r\nwith
    the other letters."

    body: "The lowercase s is very odd indeed, but thats what I think gives the face
      it's unique character - and attracted me in the first place - it is not academic,
      optically sound & logical... but it conveys a sense of the street vernacular
      I am getting more interesting in, and I think it's important to bring this sensibility
      to type design. Perhaps I could do another version with a more predicatable
      s, something that designers like yourself may feel more comfortable with. Thanks
      for the feedback!\r\n\r\n--\r\nRD Granados\r\nStereo Type Haus"

  body: i love the s, it and the q have the most personality in the lower case. perhaps
    some more flamboyant characters or alternates would make this face more cohesive.
    if you need help with anything, feel free to contact me as well, but you're in
    good hands with chester.

  body: 'Both Q and q rock. If anything I wonder if the S isn''t upside down? The
    s is great, I agree,  but is a little wide. The arm on the r seems thin and the
    t seems lopsided. The h seems a little narrow. Overall this is A LOT of fun. '

  body: "There is something about the S getting narrow in your photo example that
    seems to work better than the slow slope you are using. It's wacky looking to
    do what they do in the photo- in a way - but also strangely orthodox too. It seems
    to read more smoothly. It's hard to say way I feel this way but I do.\r\n\r\nBTW
    I don't mean copy what they did - but maybe riff on it."
