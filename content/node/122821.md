  identity type system. However the word spacing is a bit wider than I would like.
  From experience would anyone recommend trying to adjust the word spacing in a program
  such a glyphs and saving out a new version? If that is too much of an undertaking
  them I will contact the type designer directly to see if something could be worked
  out.\r\n\r\nThanks,"

  body: Because of licensing issues contacting the designer is your best option. The
    space character is about the easiest adjustment possible so they shouldn't charge
    you much if they are willing to do so. Also, I'm not very familiar with the workings
    of InDesign, but I think it offers space options that override that of the font.

    Justification settings. Then apply that style to the text. Also works for text
    that's flush left, etc.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/spacing_5958.jpg]"

  body: "Thanks Guys!\r\n\r\nWe considered the ability change the word spacing in
    InDesign and Illustrator but seeing as someone in the company might use the typeface
    is MS Word, Powerpoint, etc. we were hoping to find an option that wouldn't require
    any adjustments on the users end.\r\n\r\nI will give the type designer a shout
    and see if we can an adjusted version.\r\n\r\nThanks again for the help!"

  body: With PowerPoint you could makes slides in InDesign, then export them as JPEGs
    and place the JPEGs in the PPT. But obviously that won't work for staff that doesn't
    know InDesign.

  body: "I think the OP is right to modify the font to work out of the box, rather
    than hope that most (any?) users will follow guidelines, use stylesheets, or care
    even one whit about wordspacing. In fact, you could argue that it's the duty of
    the branding designer to anticipate and remove as many of those responsibilities
    from the end user as possible.\r\n\r\n(Letterspacing can be adjusted in PowerPoint
    and Word, and the space character is adjusted along with it, but I'm not aware
    of any way to adjust wordspacing independently.)"
