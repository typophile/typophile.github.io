  only the first letter as a capital (God) or with no capitals (god)?, why does it
  have to be GOD? is it so his/her/it\u2019s name can tower above all other words?
  in that case is it rude to set it in small caps? and what if the typographer or
  author doesn\u2019t believe in GOD can it then just be \u2018god\u2019? \r\nI prefer
  \u2018god\u2019 since their are quite a few of them. \r\n\r\nI'm not talking about

  there was a GOD sticking out every couple of sentences."

    God, and \"god\" when referring to pagan deities. There may be a tradition in
    which GOD is written, but I am not familiar with it.\r\n\r\nIn certain translations
    of the Bible, the word LORD is written in all capitals, or with a capital L, and
    the rest in small capitals, when it is being substituted for the Divine Name (the
    Tetragrammaton, Yod-He-Vau-He).\r\n\r\nI am primarily aware of Roman Catholic
    usage in this matter. The word \"God\" is capitalized when referring to God, as
    are any other nouns that refer to Him (i.e., the Creator, the Trinity) or personal
    pronouns referring to Him, or any of the Persons of the Trinity (i.e., the Holy
    Spirit, God the Father).\r\n\r\nIncidentally, note that Jesus Christ is not a
    proper name as popularly believed. It is derived from the Greek Iesous Khristos,
    and thus literally means Joshua the Anointed. Thus, capitalizing Christ is an
    example of capitalizing a common noun, as opposed to a proper name, when it refers
    to a Person of the Trinity.\r\n\r\nAs far as I am aware, some Protestant denominations
    follow Catholic usage, and others have their own rules which do not require capitalization
    to the same extent."

    making every proper name follow the same rule is fair, clear, and easy.  I believe
    that many people throughout history have believed in various gods as is their
    personal choice. I am not interested in all the arguments among religious zealots
    of all faiths.  From what I have seen, the only thing that comes out of it is
    that people end up getting killed or \"Cleansed\" or whatever euphemism they choose.
    From the sheer stupidity of the Crusades, and the Spanish Inquisition to Northern
    Ireland, Bosnia, Iraq, Iran, India and Pakistan, American KKK, Hitler, and soon
    to be Darfar, people murder each other more in the name of their own god than
    any other reason.  The funny thing is that no religion tells us to go out and
    kill.  Humans just make that all up to excuse their own violent nature and feed

  body: "The reason for only capitalizing extra words referring to the Christian God
    is if the author <em>is</em> a Christian, or at least writing for an audience
    of Christians. In that case, one is both signalling that a pronoun refers to a
    particular god, and that one believes, or is acknowledging a belief, that the
    particular god being referred to is the One Real God, all others being imitations.\r\n\r\nBecause
    of that, some texts will instead be produced according to a neutral style guide
    instead of a traditional Christian style guide, just as Jehovah's Witnesses, Jews,
    and some atheists will use the abbreviation for \"Common Era\" instead of that
    for \"Anno Domini\". Given that the Western world has been overwhelmingly Christian
    in the past, and the traditional style was deeply ingrained, however, many people
    find the neutral style offensive, or at least jarring, which is why it is not
    universal even in this age of political correctness.\r\n\r\nAs to the issue raised
    by Chris Lozos (Dezcom), I hope the following comments of mine will not be too
    intensely polarizing, but will instead promote clarification:\r\n\r\nDoes religion
    produce nothing except people fighting over sectarian differences? Sometimes it
    may seem that way. One could certainly claim that revealed religion, as opposed
    to natural religion, is not <em>required</em> for any of the good things that
    are said to come of religion; one can be an atheist and still care about one's
    fellow man. But \"A is not required for B\" is not the same statement as \"A does
    not promote B\".\r\n\r\nThe idea that God appeared to humans in one particular
    time and place, with one genuine, accurate, and trustworthy revelation - and one
    official priesthood that requires your support, respect, and obedience - certainly
    makes religious conflict possible. But it also makes religion <em>easier to understand</em>,
    and, at least for some people, easier to accept, than would be the case if religion
    remained on a more abstract or philosophical plane.\r\n\r\nThus, while the kind
    of religious belief that carries with it the potential for religious conflict
    is <em>not required</em> for non-violence or charity, it would be unfair not to
    give traditional revealed religion the credit it is due for further promoting
    these things than something less intelligible to, and less zealously instilled
    in, young children would do."

    responsibility.\"\r\n\r\nOrganized religion is neither a requirement or even a
    needed participant for charitable work. There are many members of organized religions
    that do charitable work.  I would imagine that the percentage of devout Christians
    in the USA who do charitable work is about the same as it is among the rest of
    the population of the country, including atheists and agnostics. If you are doing
    helpful things for other people just because you fear an afterlife in hell, then
    you are far less a good person than if you give of yourself for others simply
    because you just \"know\" it is the right thing to do. People had compassion and
    concern for others long before there was an organized religion to relieve them
    of the responsibility of just deciding right and wrong on their own.\r\nI am not
    saying religion is necessarily bad, I am saying it does not absolve us of our
    personal responsibility to decide to do the right thing.  You can believe your
    reward will be in heaven.  I believe your \"reward\" is simply in the hearts of
    the people that you help right here on earth. When I die, I will simply decompose
    and become organic matter for rejuvenation of the soil. Whatever I do, I must
    do here on earth because there is no second chance afterward.  Be charitable NOW
    for the sake of charity alone. If you do it out of fear for your soul, reward
    in an afterlife, or to impress others, you are still being selfish while taking
    what appears to be a selfless action.\r\n\r\nWith that, I close my sermon and
    promise not to bother you any more with my views on organized religion."

    France, Britain, Belgium; or the names of languages: English, French, Mandarin,
    Putonghua, Guo-yu, Cantonese, Southern Min, Frisian, Basque; or of language families:
    Hamitic, Semitic, Indo-European.\r\n\r\nAll of these, after all, are arguably
    proper nouns, since they are the names of unique things.\r\n\r\nWords derived
    from names or other proper nouns are also capitalized in English. Thus, words
    naming ethnicities are almost always capitalized: Caucasian, Polynesian, Jewish,
    Negro, Asian, Oriental, East Indian, Native American. However, \"white\", \"black\",
    and so on are not capitalized, even when used to refer to people of Caucasian
    or African origin.\r\n\r\nOne specific exception to this is that officially SI
    units derived from proper names are not to be capitalized, contrary to normal
    English usage. This official ruling is still often ignored in the English-speaking
    world as it is contrary to long-established habit - thus, one will still tend
    to see references to A above middle C as having a frequency of 440 Hertz; on the
    other hand, while Siemens is likely to be capitalized, Ohm usually isn't, from
    familiarity with it as a unit. But Joule, Newton, Faraday, and Pascal still tend
    to be capitalized even when used as units, since that is what people are used
    to from older textbooks.\r\n\r\nPeople who studied science and engineering, that

    of quantities (Pascal rather than pounds per square inch, Hertz rather than cycles
    per second) other than length, mass, area and volume would not have so appeared."
