  body: As stated in the title, it's a logo(work). Don't know any font that could
    match it. Doesn't look to hard to reproduce though. You could start with any generic
    sans of your choice, add an outline stroke, vectorize lettering and remove all
    terminal bars to recreate this "gas pipe" treatment. [[http://www.myfonts.com/search/Avenir|Avenir]]
    or even the ubiquitous [[http://www.myfonts.com/search/Helvetica|Helvetica]] (Neue)
    would do the job quite nicely.
