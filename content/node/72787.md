body: "okey,\r\ni wanted to make my own font for my own albums\r\nand since i moved
  to snow leopard and only had fontlab available\r\nso i installed it\r\n\r\nbut it
  was slightly more difficult when it came to dealing with nodes (points)\r\n\r\nfor
  example\r\n\r\n1 when i want to re-connect two individual points with a line, in
  fontographer i was able to do it simply with pentool but in fontlab this pentool
  method seem to work very rarely.. \r\n\r\n2 when i want to get rid of the line that
  connects two dots, in fontographer, i was able to do it simply slicing the line,
  creating an additional dot in between and delete that, and the two points become
  disconnected.. but in fontlab when i do that nothing happens or if i erase a point
  :-0 it turns into a weird curve connecting previous dots :-0 i can't even cut the
  line simply!\r\n\r\n3 to merge points in font lab, i witnessed that i have to draw
  a dot somewhere else and then drag it on top of a desired point.. :-0 this was far
  too laborious for a lazy-ass herniated disc condition suffering turtle like me...\r\n\r\n4
  there wasnt a shortcut for aligning the dots :-0 grr!\r\n\r\n5 it froze too often
  :-0 especially when doing metrics test thingy.. maybe rosetta issue..\r\n\r\nbut
  there were pros too\r\n\r\n1 i liked the exact point parametres / properties so
  that i can be more mathematically accurate when it comes to refninng the geometrics
  of the whole thing..\r\n\r\n2 i liked not bothering to have tangent or different
  types of curve points (although this might be a downer when it comes to refining
  the lines though)\r\n\r\nbut overall.. i felt that i have to go through a lot of
  complex process to do really simple things.. and i got a bit of headache and lost
  that momentary impulses which i find is important.. i guess i still have to get
  used to it but i was wondering... what's your view on this situation?\r\n\r\ni'm
  really hoping that there could be a tool that can have the intuitive drawing capability
  of both fontographer and illustrator at once have numeric precision and control
  that fontlab provides\r\nso that i could minimise the useless process figuring something
  out for hours just to connect two simple lines the right way :-0 but focus more
  on just the composition, proportions of things..\r\n\r\nso far the processes and
  tools that i am aware of are-\r\n\r\nusing head!\r\npencil and paper! sketch!\r\nillustrator\r\nfontographer\r\ntypetool?\r\nfontlab\r\n\r\nhave
  a nice day\r\nhun"

    (or SHIFT+CLICK) the node: the Contextual Menu has an option to BREAK CONTOUR.\r\n\r\n3.
    No, you don't.\r\n\r\n4. Select nodes, RIGHT CLICK and select ALIGN NODES"

    your preferences - there may be some settings you can adjust IIRC."
