  Flora</a>, a Gerard Unger's design.\r\n\r\nI find a copy on a Australian trader,
  but they wont supply European traders. Does anybody knows here can I find one copy
  of it?\r\n\r\nThanks\r\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\r\nF\xE1bio

    \u2014 IIRC, your original link (which you\u2019ve now deleted, it appears) used
    the shortcut method, but without an \u201Chttp://\u201D protocol expressly included.
    Without that, the shortcut algorithm assumes it\u2019s an internal link. And when
    it doesn\u2019t find anything, it appends the string to a generic Wiki address.\r\n\r\nBy
    giving the address as plain text in your second post, the system picks up on the
    \u201Cwww\u201D and automatically converts this to an external link, adding the
    protocol as needed.\r\n\r\nHTH."
