I come from a Navy family. My father was a Corpsman for 20 years. My grandfather was in the SeaBees at the end of WWII.

I'm guessing you did a tour or two in Vietnam. Is that correct? I was part of the Army Corps of Engineers and I know they were very active in operation Cedar Falls. However, how involved were the SeaBees in Vietnam?</div>

Yes, I was in Nam in 1967-68. I was in MCB6. Our home base was in Chu Lai in the I core. We worked on highway 1 from Quang Nai to Quang Tri but I spent most of my time in Quang Tin. The SeaBees were very involved in Viet Nam, mostly supporting the Marines. During my last few months in Nam, including the Tet offensive of 1968, the Marines 3rd MAF moved further north to Que San and were replaced by the Army's Americal Division. The Mi Lai massacre happened nearby during my tour.

Here is a picure of me there in 1968:

		<div class="commentbody">Nope I print Unit markings for Military vehicles and a client is looking for the SeaBee Logo, I was able to reproduce the logo but can not reproduce the type.  Scanned looks awful.  It is a Vietnam era Seabee Logo.  The image below was taken from a Brass Stencil we are trying to match

I am sure you won't find a typeface that matches. It was probably drawn in the 1940s by a CB draftsman using old fashioned hand tools like pen and brush in the true "Can Do" spirit :-)

		<div class="commentbody">My dad was there roughly during the same time period. I remember him telling me that he was in the areas described in Full Metal Jacket, when the reporter asks the John Wayne-esque platoon leader for some directions. He was with the 5th Marines. He was also aboard ship during the Cuban missile blockade.

That's a great photo, man! I bet it brings back a flood of memories. You build. You fight. Thank you very much for your service.

Erik,

When I was at MacWorld San Francisco, there was a vendor there that sold military clip art. Some of them were only available to those in the corresponding departments. I seem to recall seeing a few versions of the SEABEES logo. However, I was just doing a search and can not for the life of me, remember who it was.</div>
