  body: It's all in how you use the companion serif. If Netto is used mainly for display
    purposes, then just about any well-behaved serif would work for body copy. If
    the two are going to share headline duties, then I would consider something sturdy
    and relatively low contrast (something Dutch, perhaps?), or go for the vertical
    axis of a Bodoni/Didone.
