  The prime mark seems to be lacking, but can this really be correct?\r\n\r\nI have
  also tried to set the prime mark in Times New Roman, using Unicode U+2032 and then
  change the font to Garamond, but this does not work since the glyph is missing.\r\n\r\nAny
  help would be appreciated. If it really is missing, I would really appreciate suggestions
  of how to replace it from some suitable typeface.\r\n\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\n\r\nViktor

    add a prime from a font that does have one, and don't switch the font."

  body: "Viktor, you don't mention which software and version you are using.\r\n\r\nFor
    Adobe InDesign CS4 (and newer), this\r\n\r\n<cite>I have also tried to set the
    prime mark in Times New Roman, using Unicode U+2032 and then change the font to
    Garamond, but this does not work since the glyph is missing.</cite>\r\n\r\ncan
    be solved by this:\r\n\r\n1. Create a character style that applies only a font;
    select a font that supports U+2032 -- if you have a choice, select one that matches
    your mathematical font. (Although I suppose for \"just a prime\", Symbol would
    suffice.)\r\n\r\n2. Create a GREP style in the paragraph style you are using for
    math. Have it apply the character style you just created to this text:\r\n\r\n\\x{2032}\r\n\r\n3.
    There is no point 3! The character style will automatically be applied to every
    occurrence of the prime character in that paragraph style.\r\n\r\nSince GREP styles
    cascade down the \"Based on\" hierarchy of paragraph styles, you could define
    the GREP style in your main text style, and it'll be active in every derived one
    as well."

  body: "Thanks for your advice! I am using InDesign CS4 and will definitely try the
    GREP method you describe. However, since I have to manually set each math part
    (from jpg:s\u2026) I think it will also work by just inserting an italized asterisk
    as described in the InDesign help document linked above.\r\n\r\nAgain, thanks
    for your help."
