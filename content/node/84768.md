  type nerd who finds \u201Cmotion typography\u201D sequences profoundly irritating?
  I think it started with those Dennis Leary voiceover commercials for Ford pickup
  trucks. I actually don\u2019t usually mind Dennis Leary, and I tolerate Ford pickup
  trucks enough to own one. It became very popular very fast, and now it\u2019s all
  over the place. But fading, thank God."

  body: Conceptually interesting but once the style entered pop culture, it rapidly
    lost it's experimental flavor and became "just another fad". I don't necessarily
    find them irritating, but I do find them less interesting now. Too many copycats
    and not enough questions being asked.

    caps, that sort of thing.\r\nThen in the early days of DTP along came dimensionalization,
    gradients, dropshadows, textures.\r\nThen animation, and now integration via composited
    space mimicking shot space.\r\nIt's all typography.\r\n\r\nThere is a typographic
    tradition of motion graphics, primarily in film title sequences.\r\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jIlqatMQSgI\r\n\r\nBut
    I know what you're talking about John, and I think the genre to which you refer
    is an unimaginative, literal interpretation of advertising copy, a heavy-handed
    attempt to drill the message into the viewers skull, power point on acid. But
    perhaps this approach is perfect for the product and the target market.\r\n\r\n**\r\n\r\nI
    was in a new F-150 recently, and when it started up, a message appeared on the
    screen, \"Built Ford Tough\". \r\nNasty.\r\n"

  body: "As an industry fad I generally like it because it's done by creative professionals.
    As a popular internet fad \u2014 which started with a wave of AfterEffects student
    assignments uploaded to YouTube, notably the famous Pulp Fiction scene \u2014
    it is played out. Hundreds of \"typography videos\", none of which actually incorporate
    the practice of <em>typography,</em> dutifully pop each word onto the screen one
    at a time in a random rectilinear orientation, often in some uninspired choice
    of font like Arial or Impact, unkerned and riddled with spelling mistakes, and
    culminating in a rare reflection of the content at one or two key points. It only
    irritates me because I would love to watch them if they were any good."

  body: Motion typography is another recent fad for fluffing up portfolios, just like
    snowboards, t-shirts, retro book covers, retro movie posters, and the current
    fluffing fad, information graphics that take longer to comprehend than a paragraph
    of good copy. These fads do become tiresome, but they seem to be a reflection
    of design's collective unconscious, if not design's living consciousness. And
    they give students a nice break from creating imaginary corporations to develop
    high-concept brand standards for. I focus on enjoying all the great things that
    churn up and try not to pay attention to the rest. Well, except for the pointless
    infographic fad, but that's because I would rather read an article than look at
    a conceptual infographic.

  body: "The real reason for using it in TV ads is to try to get their message past
    the mute button. It is a practical necessity in a struggling medium. And anyone
    watching who can't read is not likely to be in the market for a new truck. Illiteracy
    comes of being born into poverty and having insufficient help from a crippled
    education system to escape it.\r\n\r\nThe whole \"TV made everyone illiterate\"
    idea is a few generations out of date anyway. Now people grow up with the internet,
    which for all its extra features is still composed almost entirely of the written
    word. Any young people who still watch TV now go to the internet to discuss the
    shows they watch and write fanfic about them. Reading and writing has begun to
    overtake speech as the main form of communication. If kids today, having portable
    telephones to carry with them everywhere they go, were illiterate, then you would
    think they'd all be <em>talking</em> on them, but increasingly they prefer to
    <em>text</em> each other on them instead."

    as possible.\r\n\r\nYou get one 160-character block per SMS. And, yes, text messages
    over a GSM mobile using the Small Message Service are called SMS's up here. A
    phone like my aging Nokia 3510 gives you ca. 20 characters per line. You type
    the message using the number keys. Believe me, this is not an environment to go
