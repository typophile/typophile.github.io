  done using this font but I really can't buy a font for these since I'm donating
  them. Everyone said it doesn't have to be this exact font but it would be great
  if it was close. Any recommendations for a \"really close\" font?\r\n\r\nThanks
  again!!!\r\n"

    that does seem fair but if I can find something they like for free it's a win

  body: "Sorry wannab1, it came up with nothing free and convincing. I'm also convinced
    it'd be very hard to find a free and legal alternative to it, the design is really
    too specific and I'm afraid you'll find only illegal copies or rip-offs. Talking
    about illegality, if you finally decide to go with some freebie, come back here
    again and post your choice, we'll try to find out if it could be used safely.\r\nHere
