  You were all there once so try to sympathize lol. So if you can just look at this

  you think I should reverse the information to the opposite typeface. serf- sans
  sans - serif \r\n\r\nalso do you think my hierarchy is right? I did it by whats

    use it! Check out <a href=\"http://www.aisleone.net/2009/design/myths-misconceptions-about-grid-systems/\"

    can be seen <a href=\"http://www.singstatistics.co.uk/\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>.\r\n\r\nMake
    invisible boxes that fit together with even spacing for all your words and use
    things like tracking and size (and condensed or bold or extended fonts) to fill
    those boxes. Not exactly like the image below, but you kind of get the idea..\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/grid2_6591.gif]\r\n\r\nDon't
    be afraid to break your grid! That is a great way to create interest or focal

    are meant to be followed. If they would be meant to be broken, the break would
    belong to the rules and resistance would be an illusion. The resistance is part
    of one or more other rules. Everything follows rules. As harder the amount and
    the core of rules are to define, as easier they can be confused with chaos. Chaos
    is the chorus of all rules. If you are in unison with the chaos, the chaos permits
    you to recognize and emphasize one or more rules. The order condenses in the selection
    of rules. Not tooooooo bad for two hours of sleep."

  body: "Lol thanks... The project is for my type class and my type professor is a
    self proclaimed type guru (she has the credentials to justify it). However the
    entire semester has been nothing other then critiques. which is informative but
    not as instructive as one would hope for. The whole purpose of this project was
    to design an invite based on the text provided. There is text for the invite itself
    as well as text for the rsvp card. The entire project needs to fit within standard
    size envelopes to reduce cost to the \"client\"as well as show typographic hierarchy.
    I came up with going for a playing card theme because i was in Vegas at the time
    for the LIA Judging session( like Cann but cooler because i work for them lol).
    Since I came up with that concept i have evolved from using the backs of the playing
    cards as my \"visual\" element, to using the glyphs on the cards, and finally
    landed on a black and white drawing of the king and queen of hearts (vectorized)
    that I'm quite happy about. The only thing now is taking by black and white \"visual\"
    element and using it to work with my text. I thought i could do it by keeping
    all the words compiled in a box like I've shown you but ill admit I've never attempted
    a composition like that before ( and never really taught about using a grid)\r\n\r\n\r\nhope
    this helps"

    as you should be aiming for a complete, cohesive piece that integrates everything
    together. \r\n\r\nVisual research could be very helpful. Take a look at playing
    cards- different sets, different cards within a set etc. (There have been some
    interesting custom sets by designers.) Analyze the graphic language and decide
    what you want to try to translate to your own design.\r\n\r\nThen show us again!\r\n\r\nbest,\r\njarrod\r\n"

  body: "I still feel it's not coherent enough and the composition as a whole is too
    patchy. I think there is a lack of real focus points in the design. It is not
    clear which information is the most important, and has to be read first. \r\n\r\nI
    think you've made it pretty hard for yourself working with different typefaces,
    weights, directions etc. It lacks focus and a clear idea in my opinion.\r\n\r\nWhat
    can be done to make this work? I think you have to make a pretty radical change.
    You are working with at least four different typefaces at the moment, which don't
    really work together IMO. They all have very different characteristics, so this
    makes it hard to create coherence. I would cut down the amount of typefaces to
    a maximum of two. Find two that complement each other, rather than bite eachother.
    You can still work with different weights, but I would try working with different
    weights from the same family. \r\n\r\nNow you've combined very light with very
    fat weights, this could be interesting, but looks messy and slightly arbitrary
    at the moment. You could give different weights to different kinds of information,
    but be more consistent, and try to find a balance between fat and light.\r\n\r\nTo
    make your life a lot easier I would throw out the direction changes, it overcomplicates
    the design and is hard to read. Also, limit the amount of information on the strictly
    neccesary, I think there is too much going on right now. Find out which information
    has 1st priority, which 2nd, 3rd etc. and build you design up accordingly.\r\n\r\nGrids
    are nice things, but they only will help you find solutions, in helping you organise
    and balance your content. The hard work still has to be done by you though.\r\n\r\nKeep
    us informed on your progress. good luck!\r\n\r\ngreetings Jeffrey\r\n[[http://www.infraordinaire.com/wordpress|infraordinaire]]"

    advice Jeffrey... i think. It's only two typefaces other then the ampersand. I
    went through everything again and tried to pick out the important information,
    and I also made it so its all one orientation. I think its working well now as
    separate pieces of information but i think i need to get it to work better as
    a cohesive group. Any suggestions."

  body: "Yeah, it still has a lot of problems, one being the pinball issue. I think
    you're still doing too much, with sizes and weights and overall composition. It
    just looks messy, and unless that's what you we're going for, you really have
    to change quite a lot. It still needs to be simplified a LOT. It's very difficult
    too pull off a composition that works in this way, so make your life easier and
    the piece better by doing less. This may sound odd and boring, but I feel it's
    the only way forward. As this is a piece of communication, you want it to communicate,
    clear and simple. \r\n\r\nI would start with an empty document, as working on
    the same document all the time can lead to a kind of blindness. Start afresh and
    start putting in one element at the time, starting with the most important parts.
    Try to get one element to the point that it looks and feels good, then start adding
    other elements. I would keep the secondary information simple in their design,
    without fancy type, size and weight changes. \r\n\r\nAs for the typefaces, I would
    really advise you to pick a different combination, as these two don't work together.
    If you want to work with the lighter geometric typeface, I would put another geometric
    typeface next to it, like futura, avant garde, serif gothic. Or if you want to
    go for contrast I would advise you to work with Bodoni. If, on the other hand,
    you want to work with the Helvetica you've used, I would just make everything
    helvetica, so throw out the geometrical typeface. \r\n\r\nI hope this helps.\r\n\r\ngreetings
