  what the name of this font is or where to start looking to find something similar

  body: "Some of the swashes (particularly at the top of the 'S' were a manual alteration
    to whatever the original typeface was. But I can't find anything that matches
    even the basic letters. Some current fonts from the Victorian era with a possibly
    similar feel include:\r\n\r\nZinco (Solo) = Zinc Italian (Spiece Graphics) = Sevilla
    (Gophmann)\r\n\r\nHasta La Pasta NF (Nick Curtis) = Gramophone ITC = Sturbridge
    Twisted (Intecsas)\r\n\r\nCardinal (Steffmann) = Wedlock (Solo)\r\n\r\nFilibuster
    (Nick Curtis)\r\n\r\nAcadian (Scriptorium)\r\n\r\nRaphael (Adobe)\r\n\r\nHoughton
    (Many sources) = Edisson = Edison  = Edison Swirl = Potsdam\r\n\r\nKoster,  Nymphic,
    \ Templar (Solo)\r\n\r\nand more \r\n\r\n - Herb\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    gone through some of your font suggestions to see if I can find a match. But I'm
    now wondering if the logo was hand drawn or maybe a combination of a standard
    font with hand drawing on top.\r\n\r\nMy investigations will continue.\r\n\r\nThank
    you,\r\n\r\nBill"
