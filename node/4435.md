body: I grew up in Thailand and spent more than half of my reading time on  <BR>Thai
  &amp; Thai translated version of Japanese comics. <BR>Now I&#39;ve been in London
  for several months and have begun to <BR>enjoy reading western comics very much.
  <BR> <BR>In western &#40;DC, Marvel&#41; handwriting-like all caps are so common.
  <BR>I think this is an attempt to preserve the look &amp; feel of hand lettering.
  <BR> <BR>But in Japanese comics &#40;Manga&#41; they often use formal, serif-like
  typefaces. <BR>I don&#39;t understand the reason behind this but when I see  <BR>English
  translated version of manga with western comic style typefaces, <BR>I can feel some
  contradiction there. <BR> <BR>Just wanna hear some opinions on this issue.

  body: 'Comics were originally handlettered because it was cheaper. Now that look
    is just tradition. Some comics &#40;EC for instance, making classic horror comics&#41;
    didn&#39;t use this handlettering, though.  <BR>I think a reason for sticking
    with the handwritten look is that the texts in comics mostly represent speech.
    Lettereres &#40;if you can still call them that&#41; also use different styles/balloons/colours
    and whatever for different characters. Look at Neil Gaiman&#39;s &#39;Sandman&#39;
    for instance. &#40;Embarrasing that I don&#39;t know the name of the letterer.&#41;
    <BR>A funny thing is that comics usually are lettered in all caps, except when
    representing small sounds like &#39;Oh&#39; and &#39;Uck&#39;. there are also
    two types of &#39;I&#39; in comic book typography, one with serifs, only used
    for first person stuff like &#39;I&#39;m going down to the pub to get legless&#39;
    and one without serifs for everything else. '

  body: '&#62;English translated version of manga with western comic style typefaces,  <BR>
    <BR>A version for the true manga-phile wouldn&#39;t &#149;&#149;&#149;&#149; with
    the totality of the original: it would retain the original lettering and provide
    accompanying &#34;subtitles&#34; -- like an art-house foreign movie.  <BR> <BR>Or,
    like an English-language version of an Italian fashion magazine, have a text-only
    translation inserted, on a different stock.  <BR> <BR>But if you&#39;re the kind
    of hardcorist who is bothered by the poor &#34;translation&#34;, you can get both
    the original and the Western version -- and teach yourself Japanese in the process.'

    Handletters look way better, and quite more logic in most circumstances. '

  body: Yes, Todd Klein! <BR>Thanks John. <BR> <BR>Nick, adding a sheet or insert
    with an english translation would ruin the sequential nature of comics, it would
    be like having the subtitles of a foreign film on another screen. <BR>If you&#39;re
    reading comics for the typography i agree that you should buy two copies. Or just
    the one you couldn&#39;t actually read. <BR>

  body: I think another reason for lettering comics with that handwriting style is
    that comics are almost entirely hand drawn. To me, a formal serif typeface looks
    pretty weird with all that drawing around it! <BR>I like Todd Klein! <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"

  body: EC comics is an interesting case. Their horror comics were lettered using
    lettering templates, which is what gives them their distinctive look.  <BR> <BR>The
    Comics Code, which came down hard on EC, had an interesting effect on EC&#39;s
    <i>Mad</i>. They changed the format early on calling it a magazine instead of
    a comic book, thereby exempting themselves from the Comic Code. To make it look
    less like a comic book, all the word balloons were typeset &#40;in News Gothic&#41;.

    in the early fifties by the comic publishing industry to &#34;clean up&#34; comics
    which many at the time thought were too violent or vulgar. EC was the main target
    because they published the most popular horror comics.

  body: 'Comic books are an interesting case because legibility is always prime in
    the lettering: the different roles of inker, letterer, etc keep personality down
    to a comfortable minimum. Contrast comic book lettering with comic strip lettering
    and one thing is readily apparent: personality of the strip is very present in
    the lettering &#40;until it is turned into a font, though this statement is very
    open to debate&#41;. Imagine Winsor McKay lettering in Comic Sans or the EC template...
    <BR> <BR>Plus, did you ever notice that American strips printed overseas oftentimes
    mimic the English handlettering? I seem to recall some Calvin &amp; Hobbes in
    French that were this way...'
