  body: I'm not sure of the proper classification, but this style has been in use
    in the UK since at least the fifteenth century, primarily as used here...for memorial
    inscriptions.

  body: "It could be described as an alphabet based on versals. They are built-up
    letter shapes rather than calligraphic. Also, it is an 1870 take on the style
    as medieval versals usually use rounder, uncial forms of E, N and M etc. \r\n\r\nGothic
    revival versals perhaps. Would 1870 be early Arts & Crafts?"
