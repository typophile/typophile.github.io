  for a logo. (See attached)\r\n\r\nGiven the thickness and the size and frequency
  of the rings, \r\nthey seem to pixellate when reduced to a smaller size on screen.\r\n\r\nI
  wondered if anybody may have any advice with regard to hinting the rings to\r\nsmooth
  them?\r\n\r\nOutside of this, obviously enlarging/thinning them v.slightly may be
  the only solution.\r\n\r\nMany thanks \r\nP\r\n\r\n"

    it look less \"pixelated\". Hinting, in my understanding, only effects where the

    vertically or horizontally."

    true. I was assuming that we were worried about the gray pixels along the curves,
    not at the extremes. \r\n\r\nAnd when I mentioned eliminating circles, I only
    meant at very small sizes, where there's physically not enough pixels to make
    the right number of black circles separated by white pixels. If you don't eliminate
    one of the black rings at those small sizes, the rings will crash into each other
    and fill in. \r\n\r\nJason C "

    (like I've done with that teardrop). The number of shades to use, the exact shades
    to use, and precedents of expectation all come from experience. If you don't have
    the time to learn the nitty-gritty, and your client has a budget for this, please
