  examples of custom typefaces used by car companies? Citro\xEBn\u2019s looks custom
  to me, but I haven't found any information on that one yet.\r\n\r\nConversely does
  anyone know of car brands that use commercially available typefaces to great effect?
  I saw a car brand consistently use Klavika not so long ago but can't seem to remember
  which one it was. And I thought Ford used Trade Gothic Extended, but either I'm
  wrong or they switched to Helvetica Extended."

    Does anybody have contacts in Landor?"

  body: "The Daimler-Benz corporate typeface is called Corporate A\xB7S\xB7E. It was
    designed by Kurt Weidemann in close collaboration with URW. A stands for Antiqua
    (roman serif), S for Serifenlos (sans serif) and E stands for Egyptienne (slab
    serif). The slab serif is rarely (if at all) used. Corporate A\xB7S\xB7E started
    as an exclusive corporate typeface, but a part of the deal with URW was that this
    restriction would only last several years. That\u2019s why it is generally available
    for licensing."
