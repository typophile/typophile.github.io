    Gothic</a>, except for the J, is practically a match.

    target="_blank">here</a> <BR> <BR>I had a quick look at the file in Illustrator,
    and it appears to be very cleanly drawn, it certainly  isn&#39;t an auto traced
    job.

  body: agreeing with Chesh. <BR>fwiw, Doyald Young was responsible for the previous
    mark <BR>and he discussed it on p. 156 of his book, Fonts and Logos.  <BR>&#40;it
    was modified Franklin Gothic wide&#41;. <BR> <BR>Here is a small article about

  body: The John Deere logo was probably based on <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/trade-gothic/lh-bold-extended/testdrive.html?s=JOHN%20DEERE&amp;p=36"
    target="_blank"> Trade Gothic Extended</a>.  <BR>All the characters match, but
    of course you can tell it&#39;s adapted because  <BR>of the heavier weight and
    small caps.
