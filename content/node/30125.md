body: "i have attached a PDF containing the introduction for a book i am designing.
  i'm not too thrilled with my present layout and i could really use some suggestions
  on how to make improvements.\r\n\r\nthe main body of the book consists solely of
  illustrations from pulp paperback covers along with their corresponding captions.
  i don't know if the intro needs to be more visually dynamic and sensationalistic
  to reflect the content of the book's imagery, and if so, what i could do to achieve
  this. it seems pretty stale and boring right now.\r\n\r\nany suggestions and comments
  are greatly appreciated.\r\n\r\nthanks\r\n\r\ngregg"

  body: "Lose the fake italics in the title! It's really obvious, and with a font
    as trendy as Badhouse, even non-designers will notice something is wrong. I'd
    consider entirely different typefaces; Badhouse is just very trendy in movies
    and TV right now, so it looks out of place in a print article about old Mexican
    books. Franklin Gothic doesn't fit much either, it's just too neutral. Why not
    go with an appropriate serif that would have been used in the period? Caslon or
    ITC Garamond would probably work.\r\n\r\nDitch the yellow background, it's just
    too puissant. It could work for a spread here and there throughout a book, but
    five pages of type on yellow is going to fry the reader's eyeballs, and a yellow
    that intense sucks the impact out of everything else. It might be cool to leave
    a couple sheets of newsprint in the sun for a few days to yellow like old pulp,
    then scan them up and use them as the background.\r\n\r\nTry just punching things
    up by starting with a spread that combines the title, the author's name, an image,
    and only the first two paragraphs. I'd either lay the title right over a full-bleed
    version of the intro illustration and then put the author's name facing, or move
    the UFO illustration up front and have all of the text on the facing page. "

  body: "Indeed, the yellow is frightfull for people actually wanting to read the
    intro. \r\n\r\nWhat you've done here is trying to match the sensationalism of
    the pulp-covers in the surrounding design. This could work, but it is not easy.
    It is hard to match two loudly screaming voices. Maybe you are better off creating
    a bit of contrast in visual voices. I'd try making the design of the book itself
    rather restrained, and typographically 'quiet'. This has two advantages - it makes
    the covers themselves stand out more, and it creates an atmosphere of taking the
    subject more serious.\r\n\r\nI know this suggestion differs totally from what
    you have now, but then design is often redesign."
