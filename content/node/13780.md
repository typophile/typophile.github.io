  looking girl against the door of an Astin Martin, quietly holding a gun. Think gangsters,
  elegant, British...\r\n\r\nWhat I am looking for are typefaces that would be evocative
  of this\u2014work in this period. Of course, the 1930\u2019s Bonnie & Clyde visual
  comes to mind, but I am looking for something more late 60\u2019s.\r\n\r\nAny ideas
  or suggestions?"

    pastiche, rather than distinct style\r\n\r\nRight Chris, I don't recall Brit gangsters
    being a media thing in the 60s, apart from the Krays, who were too close for comfort.
    Speaking of whom, David Bailey, another East End lad, had photographed them in
    the mid 60s. He also shot the Stones, so that gives me a mod, Compacta/Impact
    vibe. The Krays were hardcore psycopaths, and once the full nature of their crimes
    became apparent in court (eg slicing off people's faces), their glamour disappeared
    (for 20 years, at least). Get Carter is an awesome film, but after the 60s. There
    is a definite fault line there, somewhere around the Beatles breaking up.  I think
    the Get Carter typeface in its poster is Gill Kayo.\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Nick,\r\nYou are right about the Get Carter typeface on the original poster
    (I was looking at a video cover which used Eurostile which at least is of the
    period and stylish). But I don't think anyone would expect a gangster to be equipped
    with an Aston Martin or Bardot, while Carter had a Jag and Britt in 1971 not that
    far from 68. A more obvious reference would be the Italian Job (attractive cars
    and women) which was made before the need for an identity was regarded as a necessary
    marketing tool to a movie \u2013 the original British poster was a blocky almost
    constructivist sans, while another British one was almost Brody-esque and the
    American one looks like a Didone.\r\nBTW Avant Garde was produced in the early
    1970s wasn't it?\r\nTim"
