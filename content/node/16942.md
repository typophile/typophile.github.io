  development of otf tables is concerned, \r\nviz., support for features needed by
  Arabic, etc? Studio5 is not there yet, nor is FontMaster (as far as I know; maybe
  that is changing?)\r\n\r\nRelated: Is there a way to design the tables not supported
  by Studio5 or FM in text files without using VOLT? Do OT features map to a scripting
  language that can be converted? \r\n\r\nStill green here, lots and lots to learn-)\r\n\r\nHappy

    it is really good, and MS are about to launch a new version that is even better
    (I'm beta testing it now).\r\n\r\nThe only other options I can think of are:\r\n\r\na)
    use TTOASM, but it's also an MS product and is nowhere near as easy to use as
    VOLT. This is the pre-VOLT text-based tool, and really you don't want to use this.
    Trust me.\r\n\r\nb) code the tables by hand using TTX's xml syntax and then fuse
    them into the font. I can't really say whether this might be easier or harder
    than using TTOASM."

      in any case...\r\n\r\nAs for TTOASM, I will take your word for it-)\r\n\r\nAfter
      sending the original message I discovered the  Adobe Font Development Kit for
      OpenType (AFDKO). Are they of any use to me (does not support ttf but I am working
      on a cff/post-script flavored otf)?\r\n\r\nI will check out TTX as well. In
      TeX (using the bidi Aleph format) I write the equivalent of layout tables using
      straight text files (which are then compiled into binary filters), so I might
      like that approach...\r\n\r\nThnx as always\r\nIdris"

  body: "Adobe's FDK code is also the basis of the OpenType support in FontLab (and
    FL Studio) and FontMaster. Currently, the FDK and the applications that use its
    source code do not support mark attachment required for Arabic and many other
    complex scripts.\r\n\r\nIf things proceed on schedule, Adobe hopes to release
    AFDKO 2.0 around February, and then have an AFDKO 2.x release around the end of
    the summer. That latter release will support mark attachment (and all OpenType
    lookup types), at which point FontLab and FontMaster will have the source code
    to do the same.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\n\r\nT"

  body: "Idris, if you like I can send you TTX dumps of a fairly basic Arabic OT font,
    so you can take a look at the structure. I don't think it would be too difficult
    to munge from various kinds of information that can be extracted from FontLab.
    Actually, you could do most of your GSUB stuff, kerning, etc. -- as much as possible
    given the FDK code limitations -- and then dump the resulting tables from a halfway
    font and edit the TTX files to add the additional stuff that you can't do in FontLab.\r\n\r\nBut
    seriously, give VOLT a go: you might like it. Yes, Microsoft is a monopolising
    behemoth, but a lot of very nice and helpful people work in their internationalisation
    and typography groups, who are doing very good work supporting complex scripts
    and layout.\r\n\r\nAnd at least Microsoft didn't send me a Happy Holidays card
    with no postage on it, costing me $1.07 to find out who the envelope was from,
    unlike the typography group of a certain other large computer company. Ahem!"

    body: "<em>It\u2019s a phobia: get over it.</em>\r\n\r\nHmm, I think there is
      some misunderstanding. I don't mind using VOLT; I just don't want to be <em>tied</em>
      to VOLT, as in <em>absolute dependence</em>. For advanced Arabic- (or other
      complex-) script development to have to depend on a single product from a single
      company, particulary a monopoly, is not a healthy situation.  \r\n\r\nOTOH I
      would still be happy to participate in their beta-testing program. I don't think
      that looking for alternatives is being not nice to MS;-) And my hat is off to
      all the hard-working people in the internationalisation and typography groups
      working for them. \r\n\r\nThnx to all for your pointers. I especially look forward
      to Adobe's AFDKO 2.x release.\r\n\r\nThnx for your patience, and\r\nAll the
      best, "
