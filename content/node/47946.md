  body: "I think the bottom left is an S? Or a seashell? No idea what the top left
    is.\r\n\r\nI certainly don't understand how the creativity/composition concept
    is visually represented.\r\n\r\nI've done so many jobs for this type of client
    - its so much more difficult than you initially think. You need to do some competitor
    analysis - look at what others are doing in this sector. I suspect you'll find
    Its dull variations of sameness. That could be a basis for communicating creativity
    - stand out. Is there likely to be a marketing budget/strategy? \r\n\r\nAlso -
    'Creativity' is not a comfortable word for the software services industry, they
    find it messy - You need to be looking at 'innovation' (but it MUST have tangible
    results)."

  body: "fair comment i dont know what the fuck im doing either.\r\n\r\nThe symbols
    as david rightly said are supposed to be the letter s, i was working with the
    idea of composition of shapes.\r\n\r\nthanks for the advice though david, competitor
    exploration may yield some inspiration.\r\n\r\nIm finding this difficult I must
    admit, if anyone else can help out it would be appreciated\r\n\r\nDan"

  body: "Only the bottom right design connotes programming but it's almost the first
    solution comes to someone's mind so I'm sure there are many similar out there.
    Why not just write \"Scribendum.com\"? No need for two lines. Better to write
    \"Scribendum\" on its own.\r\n\r\nBeware of so called \"competitor exploration\".
    Many books and people recommend it for inspiration which leads to look-alike solutions
    everywhere. Try to do this in reversed order. Explore your  subject well, write
    down some concepts and then explore competitors. Throw away the concepts already
    realized and focus on the rest. Programming is a relatively new profession and
    I'm sure you can find unique ideas."

    really connect with the name.\r\nIf you 'insist' on using the '.com' as part of
    the name, you need to work on its placement.\r\n\r\nLooking forward to the next
    version. \r\n\r\n"

    to drop it though.\r\n\r\nThe spine of the book is aligned with the edge of the
    u.\r\n\r\nWhere do you think might be a better placement.\r\n\r\ncheers\r\n\r\nDan"

    .com needs to be range left to balance the logo, also if it is on the same side
    as the book the whole thing looks weight to one side\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Idea3_4058.jpg]"

    The mark works better too, well done.\r\n\r\n"

  body: "To me it looks more of a book publisher.\r\n\r\nHowever, I do like the cleaniness
    of it all. And the color. Very strong.\r\n\r\nThe stacking of / and { are meaningless
    to me. It looks a bit chaotic.\r\nI would concentrate on one of them.\r\n\r\nBut
    again, it looks like a publishing company.\r\n\r\nI could be because of the used
    font.\r\nPerhaps a sans like the one in your first example would fit the profile
    better.\r\nThe serif you used is a very nice font though. But not sure if it fits
    here."

    2008.

    turn those two into a ligature quite easily.

  body: "Agree with Arcturus, the kerning here is really bad. That typeface was not
    meant for display or to be spaced that tightly. Compare the density of bendu with
    crib. Much darker. You're going to have to draw the letters to get decent lockup.\r\n\r\nDitch
    the com if possible. "
