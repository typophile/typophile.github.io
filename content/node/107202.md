  found a reply on this board from a few years ago that suggested Bookman Bold Swash.
  Is there a closer match out there? I'm trying to get it as exact as possible.\r\n\r\nTHANK
  YOU!"

    work done on it along with some design modification.

    swashes, I strongly recommend [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/marksimonson/bookmania|Bookmania]]
