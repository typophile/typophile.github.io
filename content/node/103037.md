  body: "This is for text composition software that toggles bold and italic on and
    off. If the user highlights a word of Times and clicks the \"<em>I</em>\" button
    to italicize it, the font is replaced by Times Italic. The \"Font is Italic\"
    indicator should be marked in Times Italic so that the program knows that clicking
    the \"<em>I</em>\" button can only switch italics off again by replacing Times
    Italic with Times. If that marker were missing in Times Italic, its place in the
    family would be broken, and italicizing it would make the program artificially
    oblique it further.\r\n\r\nThis system was not designed with families of more
    than two weights in mind. Some people group them into sets, but best practice
    is to mark \"Font is Bold\" for Bold only (and both for Bold Italic, of course),
    and leave all other weights to be selected by the user directly."
