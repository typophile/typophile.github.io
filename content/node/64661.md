    in my opinion, in the context of the various avant-garde movements of the start
    of the XX century."

    It was a time when mechanization, electricity, automation, and motor vehicles
    changed life dramatically. There never was a period where there was so drastic
    a change so quickly come about.  The arts replied with various attempts at trying
    to either follow or lead the transformation of an agrarian society that had done
    everything by hand to the world of mass production, consumerism, and much more
    leisure time.\r\nIt was an exciting time and a confusing time. People interpreted
    it in various ways, one being Futurism. The concepts of time and motion were rethought
    and given some attempt at form. Remember that this time period also gave birth
    to the Theory of Relativity, Quantum theory, two world wars with the Great Depression
    sandwiched between and ultimately, nuclear weapons.\r\n\r\nChrisL"

    The profilo continuo del duce inspires me in a  big way. Is that actually futurist?
    I don't think that one's actually futurist but its totally rad in any case.\r\n\r\nChris,
    that was a lovely contextualization of the movement but I am looking specifically
    for information on the way the movement influenced type. Did it? Are there any
    typefaces that could be called futurist?\r\n\r\nI want a typeface with speed and

  body: "Joe,\r\nThere were no Futurist typefaces that I know of. Most of the movements
    of the time did not generate an actual typeface. Making typefaces in those years
    involved time, money, technical knowledge and therefore a connection to an established
    foundry. Young avante garde arty folks rarely could put that combination together
    then.  Even the Constructivists did mostly hand lettering or linocuts. Bayer's
    work waited years before someone else made type of it.  Renner spent years at
    it and required working with a foundry to finish the real work. The Futurists
    never made the cut though.\r\n\r\nChrisL"

    were all fascists\"\r\n\r\nPainting every futurist as Mussolini's servant is too
    simplicistic; Italy's cultural history is much more complex. For example, one
    of the most famous futurist book, a \"latta\" by F T Marinetti published in the
    30's, was designed by Bruno Munari, one of the greatest XX century designer, a
    man whose democratic feelings can't be denied by anyone. The same can be said
    of many of the greatest designers belonging of the \"futurist\" era - the 20's
    and 30's decades - like Bertieri, Frassinelli, Mardersteig, Butti, Tallone, whose
    work cannot be related, in any way, to a totalitarian attitude. (As a sidenote,
    I guess that Futurism was much more an aesthetic than a political movement, but
    this is another matter; not that they hadn't political issues, anyway).\r\n\r\nRegarding
    futurist typography, in a sense, Marinetti's aim was to create a visual complement
    to the \"new century\" milieu - something that could express the dizzy flush of
    trains, cities, machines, metal, industry, and so on. Most of all, it was a reaction
    against the old world of late XIX century bourgeoisie. Graphically, it was an
    experimental (and perhapes necessary) approach which, after the first enthusiastic
    times, soon lead to a more clean and traditional typography, towards the end of
    the '30's. I'm no expert in the matter, but it's difficult to find \"typographic
    principles\" in futurism, in a traditional sense; it was much more a matter of
    \"us against them\". Somehow, their approach (not different from other early century
    avant garde movements) resembles what happened in graphic design in the 80's with
    people like Neville Brody, David Carson, Rudy VanderLans.\r\n\r\nIt was also a
    great time for typefaces - besides more traditional stuff, in 1930 Italian typography
    spawned its response to Futura, Nebiolo's foundry \"Semplicita\":\r\n \r\nhttp://www.flickr.com/photos/fountaineer/278176955/in/set-72157594342848887/\r\n\r\n"

    but we musn't forget that although not all italian futurists were fascists, the
    sympathies of many lay with them, this does not invalidate the quality of the
    work and although Dada an Futurism shared certain aesthetics Dada was often absolutely
    critical and Futurism (at least in being instrumental to the creation of a fascist
    aesthetic modern an traditional at the same time was in that sense totally different).
    Let us not forget Russian Futurism, little did Mayakovsky, Malevich, Goncharova
    or El Lissitsky to name just a few to do with Marinetti, or Balla who allthough
    they shared with the Russians a love of modernity, machinery an dynamism weren't
    a bunch of italian neo-pagan counts who loved dressing sharp, driving fast Bugattis,
    betaing up anarchists and communists, instead considering themselves revolutionaries
    interested in world revolution and an international revolutionary art (a term
    open to interpretation in those days here are two points from the futurist manifesto
    which may make you look deeper into your \"interest for futurism\" which seems
    merely aesthetic. Heres a few pearls from their manifesto:\r\n\r\n9. We want to
    glorify war \u2014 the only cure for the world \u2014 militarism, patriotism,
    the destructive gesture of the anarchists, the beautiful ideas which kill, and
    contempt for woman.\r\n!0. We want to demolish museums and libraries, fight morality,
    feminism and all opportunist and utilitarian cowardice.\r\n\r\nHere you can read

    Mecano is a great typography, I have not seen it used in fascist propaganda some
    is incredibly avant garde even by todays (poor standards) miles away from the
    \"ancienne regime\" style of other totalitarianisms including Stalin, miles ahead,
    and there's the sublime Bruno Munari...  as in Spain where I'm writing from in
    the thirties the graphic arts were instrumental to political communication and
    many designers and typographers took sides. If you are still interested in Futurism
    there is a great book in Italian \"L'arte de la Publicitt\xE0 Il manifesto italiano
    e la avaguardie 1920-1940\"...."
