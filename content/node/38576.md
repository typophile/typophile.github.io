  body: Most license plates are not made with any typeface that is available as a
    digital font. You might like <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/search/?q=letter%20gothic&sample_text=SC3810&sample_size=36">Letter
    Gothic</a> or <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/search/?q=pennsylvania&sample_text=SC3810&sample_size=36">Pennsylvania</a>.

    entry on Unzipped</a>.\r\n\r\nIncidentally, [[Tomas Brousil]]'s <a href=\"http://www.suitcasetype.com/page.php?lmut=en&section=font&font=katarine\">Katarine</a>
    is a gorgeous sans family that is perfect to invoke the feeling of letters stamped
    in metal."
