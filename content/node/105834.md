  Life. It doesn't seem to be hand lettered, repeating letters are an exact match
  (though it could be...)\r\n\r\nAny ideas?"

  body: "I suspect that this is a Photolettering or Filmotype font that has not yet
    been digitized. In a recent discussion, http://www.typophile.com/node/104488,
    we found a very similar font, Fiedler Gothic, for a 1963 book cover.\r\nA check
    of the Photolettering \"Alphabet Thesaurus\" might find the match. Unfortunately,
    I don't have a copy but perhaps one of the other Typophiles has.\r\nDon"

  body: "Found it! Checked a copy of the Photolettering \"Alphabet Thesaurus\" when
    I visited a university library earlier today. It's _Sill \"TV\" Square Gothic_
    designed by G. Reed Sill Jr.  The \"TV\" obviously refers to the O which has a
    squared letterform that is bowed out, just like the shape of TV screens in the
    pre-digital era.\r\nDon"

    a sample.
