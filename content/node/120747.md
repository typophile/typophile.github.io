  the pleasure to announce the release of [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/andreas-stotzner/fehlian/|FEHLIAN]],
  a caps-only titling font. It owes much to my former Arthur and Lindau releases.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/schild_Fehlian_8T_4041.png]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/schild_Fehlian_2T_5545.png]"

  body: I didn't realize this was a new design, but earlier today I went through all
    your typefaces on MyFonts and saved each picture to my computer. Your designs
    are very impressive. I was surprised to see this much decoration and sophistication
    thereof inside the letters of Fehlian. Generally these decorations tend to be
    uninspired.

  body: "thank you Martin.\r\nI have a special affinity to ornaments, always had it.
    And to 1930ies, 40ies, 50ies embellishment styles in particular. Therefore I return
    to this kind of work from time to time. Though doing ornated letters of this kind
    is a bit cumbersome to execute \u2026"

  body: Nice! The fine piping somehow feels more natural here than in Arthur. Maybe
    because it tapers?

  body: "thanks gentlemen.\r\nCompared to Arthur, this has certainly more dynamic,
    strength and juicyness, maybe a more natural appeal. Arthur Sans is just utterly
    decadent. ;)"
