  body: I think &#34;IV&#34; was something bad to some people for a while. Some clocks
    use &#34;IIII&#34; for 4. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>

    that tells me you are right.

  body: 'What is the real reason for that? A lot of classic watches and clocks have
    that &#34;IIII&#34; instead of IV, this is something I have wonder many times
    and nobody  could give me an answer, so I made up a reason for myself: <BR>Could
    it be an aesthetic &amp; balance matter? I have just seen this &#34;IIII&#34;
    in clocks, so we have 12 numbers divided in 3 groups of 4 numbers, the first group
    of 4 is made with &#34;I&#34; &#40;I, II, III and IIII&#41;, the second group
    of 4 is made with &#34;V&#34; &#40;V, VI, VII and VIII&#41; and the third group
    of 4 is made with &#34;X&#34; &#40;IX, X, XI and XII&#41;. <BR>What do you think?
    Maybe I am the one who is out of balance... <BR> <BR>'

  body: 'The clock question has lots of answers, and no definitive one. Google &#34;clocks
    IIII IV&#34; and you&#39;ll see that a lot has been written on the subject. The
    most favored is that the IIII visually balances the VIII opposite it. Another
    has to do with the supposed practicality of casting an even quantity of each glyph.
    Others venture into urban legend territory, such as the idea that &#34;IV&#34;
    was considered too close to blaspheming Jupiter &#40;Ivpiter&#41;. An important
    thing to keep in mind is that subtractive notation was never used consistently
    by the Romans. '
