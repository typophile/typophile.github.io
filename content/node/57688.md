  I'm getting mad doing this! I have just 3 weights. I checked http://forum.fontlab.com/fontlab-studio-tips-and-tricks/font-family-naming-in-fontlab-studio-5-t313.0.html
  but seems to be a bit tricky too. Any other ways to get it right?\r\n\r\nThanks
  a lot!"

    next tricky thing to figure out is assigning numbers to the weight, but with only
    3 you should be fine. "
