  body: For something as high profile as the Prada logo, try using the the advanced
    search beforehand as it&#39;s likely to have come up before. Nonetheless, try
    <a href="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/33697.html?1082223963" target="_blank">here</a>
    and <a href="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/4100/2997.html?1086294556"
    target="_blank">here</a> for suggestions as the logo is almost certainly custom-drawn.
    I hope this helps. Welcome to the board!

  body: Berfin <BR> <BR>It would help a lot if you would post or link to some logos
    for us to try to help you identify rather than asking the members of this forum
    to do your research. We&#39;re all busy working stiffs &#40;at least some of us&#41;.
    <BR> <BR>Del Monte has been around a long time so their logo was probably done
    by hand but if you go to myfonts.com and do a search for &#34;blackletter&#34;
    or even &#34;uncial&#34; you might find something similar.

  body: Yes and again it would save everybody a lot of time if you could do some work
    and find images of these logos to post on the site. Speaking for myself I don&#39;t
    feel like hunting around on the internet to help you ID 10 logos!
