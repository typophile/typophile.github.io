  body: Cordia New is a Thai font that happens to include Arial characters in it to
    support Latin. The more likely answer is that it's Arial.

  body: "You are right Mark, it's more likely an Arial ;)\r\n\r\nThe only difference
    I can see is that:\r\na. Cordia New's Latin characters look much thinner than
    Arial at the same weight (e.g. Normal) and\r\nb. you need to specify a point-size
    of 20 to Cordia New to match the height of a 14 pts Arial\r\n"
