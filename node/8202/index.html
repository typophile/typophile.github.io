Think about how often we get new threads repeating old questions about the technology. <BR> <BR>I'd take a stab and guess that House Industries has had a huge influence on the sway away from the total grunge. If you look at there library's timeline you can see that they have been moving toward cleaner, more perfect, letterforms. Maybe they are unique, but I think that is also why they are ahead of the curve. Of course this is talking display and so maybe not answering your question.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">&gt; House Industries has had a huge influence on the sway away from the total grunge. <BR> <BR>I don't see that at all. <BR>My impression is that during the &quot;transition&quot; all they did was basically abandon ship. It's only since then that their work has become notable, although as Paul Shaw remarked in his superb review of House in Print magazine something seems to have been lost as well - although it can always be regained, and with some of the stuff we saw this year maybe it already has. <BR> <BR>Matthew, I think mainly what happened at first was a natural ignorant over-enthusiasm with the so-called &quot;democratization&quot; of type design. Then some of the well-meaning hooligans left and some others got serious, coupling their creativity with good craft. I think it's become really quite a promising time right now in type design. <BR> <BR>hhp</div>

But of course now that we know you're here I hope you also feel compelled to participate outright.  :-&gt; <BR> <BR>BTW, does anybody really think House is washed up? The worst thing I for one would say is that you're just less innocent now - part of growing up (typographically speaking). And the fonts are certainly way better now. <BR> <BR>Oh, and I totally agree about the Size Matters complex of late. To me there's something unhealthy in the &quot;never use the same glyph twice&quot; mentality for example. The stuff of yours that you showed at TypeCon is much more to my own liking, although still maybe a touch too mechanical/predictable to fully compete with the &quot;real thing&quot;. The question is, at what point of complexity do you cross over into &quot;worth faking&quot;? House may have already crossed that line, although the closer you [try to] come to handwriting (as opposed to lettering) the farther the line escapes. <BR> <BR>hhp</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Tal, sorry for rounding down to such a small number. Ed Interlock is indeed wicked cool, and certainly qualifies as being tricked-out. And I also think that the just-released Bello counts, too, if we are counting tricked-out latin fonts. So, at the moment we have between five and ten. I suspect that by this time next year, we will probably have closer to 100. So, instead of this being the end of an era, maybe it is the beginning of a new one. What do you think about that, Matt? Do you miss the grunge-era's style? Or do you think that our new era will be too technically oriented?</div>

I didn't know whether you were remarking that Dan was describing something that you consider 'typical', or that you thought his comment was 'typical' of some attitude of his own, or if your terse response was to something that someone else had said. Not every inference, touch of irony, or allusion needs to be spelled out, but complete sentences containing whole thoughts are appreciated.</div>

I think that type design is headed in a good direction. I don't have any issues with having to be part programmer and part designer as long as the end product is an improvement on previous designs.</div>
