  Studio 5.1 for Mac Public Preview 4 (build 4311)</a></strong> is now available as
  a free update for all registered users of FontLab Studio 5. \r\n\r\nThis build fixes
  many problems with FLS 5.1 crashing on Mac OS X 10.7 and 10.6, improves OpenType
  .otf and .ttf font generation, improves the decompilation of OpenType Layout features
  into FEA 2.5 syntax (e.g. automatically includes the \"languagesystem\" statements
  required by the AFDKO 2.5 library), and includes many stability fixes and small
  UI improvements. \r\n\r\nFontLab Studio 5.1 is a 32-bit Mac Intel application that
  runs on Mac OS X 10.5, 10.6 and 10.7. \r\n\r\nRegards,\r\nAdam\r\n"

    which means that the Win and Mac versions will now be incompatible.

  body: "John, \r\n\r\nas I'm sure you remember, that's always been the case. We never
    released FontLab 3 or 4 or FontLab Studio 5 for both platforms at the same time.
    We just don't have the resources to do that under the current codebase (fortunately,
    this will likely change with the new codebase that we're developing). \r\n\r\nBest,\r\nAdam\r\n"

  body: "Adam, I was responding to James' comment, which seemed to suggest that an
    update to the Windows version wasn't necessary, since it is already Intel-native.
    I was pointing out that the updates in the Mac version involve more than just
    making it Intel-native. Yes, the Windows and Mac versions have always been incompatible
    in various, mostly small ways, but I think changing the ADKFO code base is a different
    order of incompatibility, because it makes .vfb sources with .fea code in them
    non-cross-platform compatible.\r\n\r\nNot an issue for me, of course, since I
    still use VOLT for all OTL work. :)"

  body: "I think the main advantage of the Mac version (to compare with the Win one)
    is that it doesn't have 6 400 glyphs limit anymore. This discriminates users of
    the Win version even more.\r\n\r\nJohnych "

  body: "It all depends on your needs. I almost never need more than 6,400 glyphs.
    But I always have a need to kern triplets, or come up with work-arounds. We now
    run a text-processing routine on incoming manuscripts to kern triplets, using
    a hard kern in InDesign. Couple examples: f + space + J/(plus any letter with
    an ascender on the left) period/comma + space + a/c/d/e/etc.\r\n\r\nEtc. Could
    well use some of the other ADKFO 2.5 tools as well. As far as supporting ADKFO
    2.5 goes, AFAIK & IIRC, FL promised it for Windows by December 2010."

    now, it is a script run in the text file, so it isn't in the font. We really just
    have two: one for fonts with a swoopy \"f\", one for fonts without. Just generalized
    kern vaules, will be much better when we can get it in the fonts. We also take
    care of some roman/italic \"interchanges\" with the script, and forbid line breaks
    for numerous constructions (8:00 P.M., F. M. Murphy, etc. etc.)."
