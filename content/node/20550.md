  using an opentype font I'm working on. I've read up on the fontlab group and on
  here to see if I could get some more info, but it feels like I've tried everything.\r\n\r\nI'm
  working on a Mac and with Fontlab Studio 5.\r\n\r\nI created a font that contains
  a kern opentype feature and have converted it to a flat table also.\r\n\r\nIt's
  got around 150 kerning pairs and I'm not using class based kerning.\r\n\r\nI'd like
  this font to be as compatible as possible with old and new apps.\r\n\r\nAny ideas?"

  body: "Matthew, is your font OpenType PS (.otf extension)? If so, the generated
    font shouldn't have ANY flat kerning. The kerning in OT PS fonts should all be
    handled in the 'kern' feature. So, you should use class-based kerning. In addition,
    go to FontLab's preferences and under Generating OpenType...->Kerning, deactivate
    the option Export old-style non-Opentype... and tick the box at the bottom that
    reads Generate OpenType 'kern' feature...\r\n\r\nAlso, <a href=\"http://groups.msn.com/FontLab/tipsandtricks.msnw?action=get_message&mview=0&ID_Message=1109\">some
    more stuff to fry your brain</a> :)"

      don't even bother to show up who you are, where you live, and from where your
      bitterness comes.\r\n\r\nFinally I think Adam went straight to the point: I
      have no idea on what actually lay behind a Type 1 font, I just learned enough
      to work without unacceptable flaws.\r\nOn the other hand: it's right: you shouldn't
      sell a badly manufactured thing."

  body: Matthew, I believe if the only feature in your font is kern then the kerning
    might not show up -- add a quick ligature feature or something and see what happens.

    fontlab to generate fonts that actually work is a freaking maze that changes every
    time I use it.

    have to understand all of a font format. Ten yearsa ago, many people were building
    Type 1 fonts with Fontographer, and I doubt the majority of them were able to
    explain the difference between a public dictionary and a private dictionary inside
    of the Type 1 font. It is, of course, an advantage, to understand the technical
    aspects of the font, but it's not a prerequisite to understand all of that. \r\n\r\nA.\r\n"

  body: "Matthew, \r\n\r\n1. Does your font has any GSUB features? Note that InDesign
    won't recognize kerning if a font only has GPOS features, so you need at least
    one substitution (e.g. a \"liga\" feature). \r\n\r\n2. Did you activate kerning
    in MS Word? :> \r\n\r\nA."

    one does not imply the other. You may have GPOS \"kern\" feature kerning and not
    use classes at all, i.e. only use pair positioning. For example, all Microsoft
    ClearType collection fonts (which are in OpenType TT format rather than OpenType
    PS, but that's secondary), use GPOS \"kern\" feature kerning but do not use classes.
