  it's based on another font, like arial/helvetica. Happy for all suggestions. Mainly
  it's the italic version look alike that I'm looking for.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/georgia_5613.jpg]"

    on a Scotch Roman. Then he showed us what became Georgia. So Miller was what he
    came out with next so they are related. Or from the same inspiration. \r\n\r\n"

  body: "Thank you all for suggestions and info.\r\n\r\nMarcox, sorry about that,
    I gave it some thought but made the wrong decission.\r\n\r\nSii, Georgia doesn't
    work for me because when you use Georgia on a website, different browsers display
    different versions of Georgia and most of the browsers doesn't display the right
    version with the beautiful italic f for example. Also some browsers (ie f.e.)
    doesn't render Georgia that good, very pixly. Chrome on the other hand renders
    it nicely I think.\r\nWe have tried to force browsers/computers to use the right
    version but it's not 100% and the rendering is still a problem.\r\nSo I would
    like to try Typekit with a simmilar font and see how that works.\r\n\r\n\r\nVinceconnare,
    interesting, when was this?"

  body: "Tjena Petter. It sounds like the issues you\u2019re experiencing are most
    likely just the product of font rendering with different engines. Browsers and
    OS\u2019s vary wildly and the only way to really get the same result across all
    platforms is using images. The font\u2019s appearance is also effected by something
    called hints, clues that help the rendering engine turn curves into pixels. You\u2019ll
    probably never again come across a typeface as well hinted as Georgia:  Even with
    Windows\u2019s latest rendering most of the fonts on Typekit doesn\u2019t hold
    up, and if you happen to use older versions I\u2019m not sure if there is anything
    readable left. Tom Rickner and Matthew Carter spent years perfecting Georgia for
    this task. My point is: If Georgia\u2019s rendering is your problem, Typekit is
    not going to offer any better solutions."

    I agree with you - to the extent that screen rendering is ahhh.. <em>fitful</em>
    and <em>uneven</em>, to say the least.\r\nBut: people are using them anyway and
    that's the lesson.\r\nMany people just don't care, obviously. Or they are working
    on Macs and don't test on Windows. (Which is not to say I like Mac rendering -
    it will depend on the font but I mostly don't.) There's a lesson there, too.\r\n\r\nIt's
    just a kneejerk reaction to the same old, same old. And if there's a few warts,
    so what? Or that seems to be the attitude, at least.\r\n\r\nINFG - It's Not F-cking
    Georgia.\r\n\r\nAll of which doesn't solve plojel's problem. But I didn't realize
    at first that he was looking for a web font to replace Georgia.\r\n\r\n@plojel\r\nI
    don't think you're going to find a Georgia knock-off with a web font license that
    you're going to find acceptable. It depends what your priorities are.\r\n\r\nrich"
