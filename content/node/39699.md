body: "Okay, I'm a total newbie, even to vector-illustration software, so maybe I'm
  asking dumb questions. I'm just gonna start:\r\n1. What do these yellow squares
  mean that you can drag around without being attached to a certain line?\r\n2. What
  is the the proper way to join two parts of a new glyph?\r\n3. How can I control
  the thickness of a line?\r\n\r\nThere's still two other questions: Is it possible
  to activate hinting of the X11 fonts (I mean the fonts actually used for the menus
  etc) or is it not?\r\nThe font I'm trying to will derive from \"Mg Open Modata\"
  (an open-sourced copycat of \"VAG Round\") and the way I want it to look afterwards
  is much like the corporate font of the Tate Museums (which is a more elegant variation
  of \"VAG Round\"). If I don't do everything similar, will I be legally vulnerable,
  though?"
