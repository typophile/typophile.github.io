  for the label is, and I'm having a really hard time figuring it out. They thought
  it was Garamond, but it clearly isn't (as far as I know). \r\n\r\nThey gave me the
  print file, but all the text was outlined, and it didn't have any font references
  anywhere.\r\n\r\nThe \"U\" is really throwing me off. \r\n\r\nAny leads?\r\n\r\nThanks
  in advance!"
