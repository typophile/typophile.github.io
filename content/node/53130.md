body: "Not strictly an ID request, but kind of:\r\n\r\nDid I dream that there are
  certain (renaissance?) serif fonts that have a sort of swash attached to the middle
  of the e, as quickly sketched (and badly photographed) below? Can't find anything
  like this for the life of me, but could have sworn I've seen it a bunch of times.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/swashee_tp_4378.jpg]\r\n\r\nIf
  anyone can point me to a couple of digital faces that have such a \"swashy\" e (the
  rest of the face virtually doesn't matter, as I only need such an e for a logo),
  that would be most appreciated. Actually, the more ornate, the better.\r\n\r\nCheers!"

    by the same designer. His Garamonds (Adobe and Premier) only feature a swash \u2018e\u2019
    with the prolonged lower outstroke."

  body: It is common in calligraphy. It comes from an older way of writing e with
    two strokes. The first is a downward curve like a c. Then the pen goes back to
    the top to do the loop a bit like a smaller reversed c and the swash is the connector
    to the next letter. Various script and calligraphy fonts have it but I presume
    you want something looking like metal type.

  body: "Ah! Interesting, Justin. I was wondering about that.\r\n\r\nActually, I wasn't
    thinking in terms of script/calligraphy fonts, but if you have a nice suggestion,
    feel free to throw'er over. (As long the swashy bit does not just work/look like
    a connector, though: I need the e to work as a 'stand-alone' character.)"

    even has a capital \u2018E\u2019 that looks like that. FontShop has compiled a
    whole <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/fontcase/genres/renaissance_script/\">truckload

    in most of them. Among those fonts is the beautiful <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/singles/creative_alliance/poetica_lowercase_ending_1/\">Poetica</a>,
    where the above mentioned Slimbach really let his hair down."
