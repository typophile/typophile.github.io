  body: Jim, my font prucahses are pretty modest as I rely on my employer for most
    everything but I was thinking to myself just the other day that there seems to
    be a lot of homogeniety in the type vendor web space.  <BR> <BR>I was just thinking
    that it would be very useful to have an on-screen comparison tool, where I could
    look at details in a font and compare them with 3&#40;?&#41; others <b>all in
    the same screen</b>. That way I can make a choice between, or find contrasting
    or complementary types quickly and easily. I imagine a screen divided into quadrants
    kind of like a Photoshop &#39;Save for web...&#39; dialogue box. <BR> <BR>Another
    idea is to provide users with a bookmarking or specimin utility. I am thinking
    of the light box concept at <a href="http://www.istockphoto.com">istockphoto</a>
    where as a user I can collect photos and refer to them quickly and easily at a
    later date &#40;a page with thumbnails that point to the actual catalogue entry&#41;.
    Or at least come <BR>back and pine for the day I need them or can afford them.
    <BR> <BR>I&#39;d love features like these and would head there first if I needed
    to find something.
