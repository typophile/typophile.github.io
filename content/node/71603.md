body: "I have been designing on macs since college and most of my design career.\r\nI
  have recently started at a firm that uses both mac and pc for design and production.
  The worst thing about this is that they haven't heard of font management. I have
  used Font Explorer for mac without fail for all of my other jobs and having tried
  Extensis with bug after bug and crash after crash I was wondering if there were
  any experts or just experienced typophiles out there that have used anything better
  or more reliable than Extensis for the pc! If only there was a FontExplorer for
  pc!"

  body: "I use two together with no problems so far (on my Windows 7 64-bit and 32-bit
    PCs) - \r\n\r\nExtensis Suitcase Fusion 2 \r\n\r\nfor general font management
    - the plugins for InDesign and Illustrator work well and are especially useful
    for when you open up a file from a third party - as the file\_loads you will get
    a 'missing fonts' alert for any fonts required by the file but not installed on
    your system, & \r\n\r\nPrinter's Apprentice, \r\n\r\nwhich is superior for viewing/comparing
    fonts and is tops for printing out catalogues and/or sample sheets - by far the
    most customizable and useful utility for those tasks that I've come across (and
    I've trialled loads of font managers for Windows).\r\n\r\nBTW Suitcase Fusion
    2 (v13.2.0.37) is the most stable offering from Extensis yet. It hasn't crashed
    once on me.\r\n\r\n-Typo46"

  body: "Suitcase Fusion 2 is at least as stable on Mac as on Windows.\r\n\r\nSuitcase
    11 was pretty flaky. Suitcase Fusion 1 (which was Mac only) was considerably better.
    Suitcase Fusion 2 is better still, and has feature parity across Mac and WIndows.\r\n\r\nDisclaimer:
    I'm the product manager for this stuff at Extensis.  :)\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\nT"

  body: I'm a fan of Suitcase Fusion 2 as well. Took forever to come out, but it's
    a great piece of software.
