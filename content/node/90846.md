  magazine and a logo for it, and I would really be grateful if someone can point
  me in right direction.\r\n\r\nAs you can see, I'm not an expert in this field. I
  do apologize to other graphic designers who are in business for ages, and hope that
  my work won't be offensive to anybody.\r\n\r\nWhat do you think about the logo typography,
  if you have in mind that it will be highly commercial magazine, that contains almost
  none articles, but only \"product placement\" stuff, adds, some style and trend
  directions etc. It aims women between 18-35 years old.\r\nBasicly, it is catalog
  wrapped as a magazine.\r\n\r\nSorry for such a bad font page, I didn't have time
  to make anything nicer.\r\n\r\nThank you in advance!\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/jpg

  body: "Didot was my first choice, but I thought it would look more \"editorial\"
    and not commercial  if I can say it that way... but after your reply, I tried
    it and it looks much better.\r\nThe only thing is that the clients are considering
    about adding the county above, and I'm freaking out cos it already looks that
    to much going on!\r\nI appreciate your reply, sorry for my English...\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/jpg

  body: "That's not a mock-up of the full cover.\r\nYou should experiment to see how
    the nameplate performs with different permutations of layout that include a picture
    and other text elements.\r\nWorry about too little going on\u2014a busy layout
    for a magazine cover is intriguing for readers.\r\nWithout multiple text elements,
    your publication will look more like a book or catalogue."
