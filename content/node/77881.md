  to getting some feedback.\r\n\r\nI used the customized swash in order to emphasize
  y personal passion for windsurfing.\r\nI know it\"s not so easy to understand, but
  the swash should look like a flag / sail blowing in the wind.\r\n\r\nThanks for
  your help. "

    high- maybe lower it or extend the l? \r\nAlso the 'swash' does not flow smoothly
    at the top right corner as other characters do; my diagram shows this (as well
    as a lowered h stroke):\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://img814.imageshack.us/img814/5492/swash.jpg\">\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Thanks for your helpful comment. the h swash is higher because I tried to
    express the sail / wind. But maybe it's too much.\r\nBut for sure I will fix the
    top right corner. Good point."

  body: "Raphael seems to be sitting a smudge too low. I would try and placing it
    on a baseline of immediately above \"Raphael Kroencke\". \r\n\r\nRaphael might
    also be a bit too large IMO, that's unless you are going to letterpress these
    cards. Its size looks OK on the screen, but on the paper it may be come out over
    dominating.\r\n\r\nLast comment is that I would consider eliminating separate
    line for a web address. It's a pet peeve of mine, have a look at [[http://typophile.com/node/75579|this
    thread]] for the rationale. Alternatively, consider moving the www line elsewhere
    - either under Visual Communications, or even setting it on its own below the
    phone number. At the very least try and have email and www addresses farther apart
    so not to create this blotch of duplicated letters."
