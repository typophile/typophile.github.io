body: "This is the logo I'm working on for my final project this semester, and it's
  for a fashion designer friend of mine as well.\r\nProto-Pop Art originally preceded
  Pop Art back in the 1950s, so my friend chose that as the name since his style isn't
  classical, it's a bit experimental and consists on using many objects from popular
  culture in his dresses and creations.\r\n\r\nI first began with some sketches, and
  came out with the idea of using common sewing materials to create the logo since
  that's basically what Proto-Pop Art was about. Below is one of the final sketches:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Sketch_6236.jpg]\r\n\r\nAfter
  the sketches, I tried tracing it digitally but was very unhappy with the results,
  even after experimenting with one letter for the logo or the whole word, like:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/protopop1213_5593.jpg]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/charbelsaaaaaad_6707.jpg]
  [img:sites/default/files/old-images/charbelsaaaaaaaaaaaad_5576.jpg]\r\n\r\nthen
  I created using wool and glue, the word \"protopop\", since I felt it would be best
  to trace over something that's done manually:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/wool_4930.jpg]\r\n\r\nI
  scanned it and traced it digitally, and was able to get to the final logo here:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/jqehfjnsjnfjsndada_6015.jpg]\r\n\r\nBut
  I still find it kinda off and unbalanced, and a bit too complex for a logo, which
  is why I created a second option.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/omgomgomgomg_3599.jpg]\r\n\r\nFinally,
  what I need is informative critique by other people on how I can fix the first final
  logo, or maybe join the two or just any constructive feedback, because I already
  like the concept I begun with."

  body: "The second to last is cute. I like it. The needle is thicker than your literal
    needle so perhaps the thread could be beefed up a bit too.\r\n\r\nThat said, while
    I really like the logo, I get a very retro 50's vibe to it, which is perhaps OK.
    But if you're aiming for high fashion, I'd consider going some other routes that
    are less literal."

  body: "I love the 2nd to last logo as well: great colours, cute buttons, playful
    concept & an overall good execution.\r\n\r\nJust a few remarks:\r\n\r\n- I'm not
    sure about the wavy beginning & end strokes, I'd try keeping those curvy as the
    ascenders (just smaller & open)\r\n\r\n- The t is kind of lost on me as the crossbar
    doesn't really come across well. You might want to try making the space between
    them equal to the thickness of the needle and perhaps making them slightly thicker
    (they seem a tad bit thinner than the thread & needle outlines) so that it'll
    look more like a whole alltogether.\r\n\r\n- This could raise problems for labels
    depending on what kind your friend is planning to use. You could try placing pop
    underneath connecting the thread by the o & last p so that the end stroke on the
    first p of pop can be the same as the proto-p.\r\n\r\nAs for Aluminum's concerns
    about it not being very high fashion, I have to agree, but with a name like proto-pop
    I'm guessing the emphasis will be on fun, colourfull fashion...\r\nGreat job so
    far & thanks for posting the different steps in your progress. It's always nice
    to see how something evolves from sketch to finished product (assuming we'll get
    to see that too later) ;-)"

  body: I like the shapes you got with the thread alone glued onto the paper. Can
    you forget the buttons and needle? Those seem to be what's tripping me up about
    the digitized versions.

  body: "This is a great concept! Loved seeing your process and the evolution of this
    design!\r\n\r\nI agree with ill sans about the wavy beginning & end strokes as
    well as the \"t\" being hard to read. I also agree with penn&ink, you need to
    do a version without the buttons and needle. The buttons make the letter forms
    seem geometric...and they shouldn't be in my opinion, they should look more 'natural'
    like it was made with real thread, exactly like you did. Maybe have the needle
    at the end of the last \"p\". The colorful buttons are playful and definitely
    say pop art but not high end fashion. Maybe finding a middle ground between playful
    and serious will help you balance out the look and feel your going for and will
    simplify the logos readability and practicality in regards to production for labels
    and such.\r\n\r\nHope to see the next steps. Great work!"

  body: I like the second last one, but for me the buttons look like a bit like a
    face...and unfortunately the way you've got the thread, it looks like a sad mouth.
    Is there a way to make the face smile?

    each other. I keep reading it as Proto-Poop :-|

  body: "These are a lot of fun!\r\n\r\n3rd from the top: because it reminds me something
    you'd find in some mid-century magazine. Does your friend's fashion feel retro
    or vintage?\r\n\r\n2nd from the bottom: because it really is lovely. The way the
    string ends is perfectly fine from where I'm viewing this. It makes sense and
    I'd not change it. But this feels a little more pop culture and less fashion for
    me.\r\n\r\n4th from the top: more fun. for some reason the use of the sans makes
    me think of something you'd find out of those crazy fashion/shopping districts
    in Japan."

    once you start adding everything it becomes way too kitschy. No need for multiple
    buttons and a needle. '

  body: "Thanks a lot everyone for your very helpful comments :) I eventually went
    with second one from the bottom, tweaked it a bit, and the professor loved it,
    even though I didn't find it that great. I also forgot to mention that the logo
    is for my friend's university project (he's majoring in Fashion Design) so the
    label isn't real. Now that I'm done with the project, I won't fix the logo anymore
    because I believe no matter how much I work more on it, it wouldn't be perfect
    in my eyes, so I'm just gonna let it be and move on.\r\n\r\nI really appreciate
    the helpful comments though, I'm loving this community a lot, very professional!"

    The second to last option is my favorite, too. Care to post your final version?

  body: I know you have decided on the final logo, but did you ever try using the
    handmade lettering, scanning it and trying to extract the piece of thread to use
    as the logo. I think the real thing looks lovely, for me it looses some of its
    personality when traced and rendered digitally.
