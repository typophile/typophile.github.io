  for to invest in a new font family. I have used Kozuka Pro that came with Quark
  7... but it does some very strange things, especially in Illustrator (unusable!).\r\nIt
  is similar to Frutiger - a typeface I already like - but Linotype suggested the
  XSF fonts would be better for screen work.\r\nWe have an ever growing website -
  but the full family costs an eyewatering \xA3588 !!!\r\n\r\nDoes anybody have any
  experience of XSF fonts - are they worth nearly double the price of ordinary fonts??
  \r\n"

  body: 'These fonts would be "hinted" for better on-screen display, but many applications
    and operating systems largely ignore these hints. Before laying down any hard
    cash on hinted fonts you''ll want to ask Linotype for a waterfall screen grab
    of the font in use in your app/OS combination/s and judge for yourself if it''s
    worth the extra money. '

  body: "I don't have Quark 7, but for the past several versions Adobe has bundled
    InDesign with a bunch of Kozuka Pro fonts for Japanese.  Given the size of East
    Asian fonts, and the complications flowing therefrom, I'd be wary of using the
    Japanese fonts for alphabetic text.\r\n\r\nGood luck!\r\nDavid"

  body: "The XSF hinting is primarily beneficial for corporate/office use, i.e., Microsoft
    Word on a PC. In a big bank or financial institution, there is a lot of reading
    going on in just this environment. I'd say that XSF's intended audience is people
    like this. \r\n\r\nIf you fit a different group, non-XSF might be your bag. Check
    to make sure that\u2014if you do go with other fonts\u2014that you pick a format
    that has the character set support you need (especially if you are are working
    with Eastern European languages, etc)."

  body: "I'm not at all convinced that the XSF fonts would look significantly any
    better in:\r\n- major Adobe graphics applications on any platform (Illustrator,
    InDesign, Photoshop)\r\n- Any other OS X applications\r\n- Windows applications
    when ClearType is enabled\r\n\r\nIn other words, that extra hinting is mainly
    useful for Office applications running on Windows XP and earlier, with ClearType
    off.\r\n\r\nDon't get me wrong, btw. Where it matters, it can make a very big
    difference. It's just that there are an increasing number of environments where
    it may not matter very much.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\n\r\nT"

    when used in web applications - particularly pdf files that are accessed via a
    company website? \r\n"

  body: You could come at this from the other angle and maybe take a look at Adobe
    originals - these are most likely to render best in PDF viewers and would have
    had the most testing in that scenario.
