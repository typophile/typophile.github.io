body: "I'm looking for reference photos and type faces that reflect on 40's-50's broadway
  or movie theatre signs over the top of the building entrances. The ones that had
  the uppercase black letters and flashing bulbs around the edge. Any reference to
  web sites or fonts that reflect this would be great.\r\n\r\nps.what's the name of
  those signs anyways ? Matinee signs? I don't know but I'd like to.\r\n\r\nthanks\r\n"

  body: Marquee signs is the term I usually associate with them. There are, I recall,
    at least a couple of excellent books on movie palaces of the 30s and 40s out there...

  body: It's a little different than what you're looking for but the cover of today's
    New York Times Magazine is all neon, nicely done. There's also a neon font inside,
    not sure if it's custom or commercial.
