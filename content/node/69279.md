  get this... WTF didn't work, due to some weird artifacting in the letters. The G
  is the main trouble maker that eliminates a lot of the \"usual suspects\" that I
  could think of.\r\n\r\nThanks!!!\r\n\r\njohn"

  body: Yup, looks like they were strangely compressed - maybe turned into an EMF
    or something? Tis the best I've got though.

  body: "I mean that the details of the letters look inconsistent, as if this was
    lettering done by an amateur. The base leg of the E is wider than the others;
    the C has irregularities in it's outlines; the O looks off-center; the G shape
    doesn't mirror the C (which is usual). I think I am convincing myself that this
    is either hand-lettering or a very poorly executed font.\r\n\r\n(I checked Dafont
    for Sans fonts and this wasn't there, but there are many other places where amateur
    fonts could show up.)\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: "Thanks Mike,\r\nI don't think this is an amateur font... I think it was a
    pro font, but was somehow converted (maybe traced in illustrator, which oftentimes
    makes those weird artifacts?).\r\nHmph!\r\njohn"

  body: "Well, that would explain it, I guess. If you try using my [[http://www.bowfinprintworks.com/SansGuide/sanssearch.php|Sans
    Serif Font ID Guide]], you will find the G and M lead you to 95 font choices.
    There are also the letters R, S, W, J and C (which your sample has too) in the
    samples, in case you have any more letters for comparison.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
