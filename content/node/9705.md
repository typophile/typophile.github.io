  body: We&#39;ve discussed this before. Please, Yves, don&#39;t punish me.  <BR>
    <BR>Opti fonts seem to be available from Castcraft, however their site looks like
    something from the stoneages and nothing is really searchable. As for Opti Excelsior
    Script, a very close match would be Commercial Script available at MyFonts. <BR>
    <BR>ehehe.

  body: If it&#39;s the same Excelsior Script that appears in the Solotype <BR>Catalog,
    then I believe that Scangraphic&#39;s <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/search?search%5Btext%5D=artscript"
    target="_blank"> Artscript</a> is pretty <BR>much a match as is RoosterTypes&#39;
    <a href="http://www.roostertypes.com/view_fullfont.asp?catalogid=23595&amp;issingle=yes"
    target="_blank"> Classic Script</a>.

  body: We have all of the OPTI fonts at work. I wonder if they&#39;re legit copies?
    Maybe there are some 5.25&#34; disks somewhere... or punch cards, or whatever
    they had back then.

  body: Thanks Mike.  <BR> <BR>Haha. Can anyone even read 5.25&#34; disks now? I have
    to tell my clients I can&#39;t even read their newer floppies.

    from the pre-FontShop days,  <BR>when a client sent a 5.25&#34; font disk with
    a card that read: &#34;Could  <BR>you check what&#39;s wrong with the font files

    disk! <BR> <BR>We found what&#39;s wrong with your disk: there&#39;s a card stapled  <BR>into
