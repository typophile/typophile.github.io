  front label for a micro winery (my own) that produces wines from concentrates.\r\n\r\nI
  wanted to keep the label's vibe crude street level and have it play off several

    but it's an interesting mark. Definitely crude, but not offensive nor clumsy.
    \r\n\r\nOnly nitpick would be the places where 3 lines meat such as the first
    E and A. Maybe make that one stroke going from the E into the A."

  body: There was a Fool's day news bit of some winery starting to produce "condensed
    port". A small flask would be a gooey essence and one would mix it with vodka
    to reconstitute the original. I think that was an awesome idea :-)

  body: "I like it, but I wouldn't call it \"crude street level\". It looks very neat
    and tidy and legible. Maybe a bolder stroke and varying some of the baselines
    would help. But I don't know exactly what level of casualness you're going for.\r\n\r\nIf
    that's a period at the end, I'd suggest deleting it."

    and try a reverse with a burgundy background and white type. I agree with James
    on the thicker stroke. Perhaps vary the density of the stroke to emulate spray-paint
    as opposed to marker, or, change the stroke to emulate the giant grease markers
    taggers use when they go bombing.\r\n\r\nFor a great watch, check out <a href=\"http://www.bombit-themovie.com/\">the

    theme.

    trip <em>to</em> the liquor store or <em>back</em> from it?

    The feet (and parts of the lower legs),form the shape of an N (for the first letter
    of my first name etc. up from there) and the head is in the 'shape' of a C (for
    the first letter of my surname etc. down from there), still a work in progress.
    I should focus some serious time on it but I don't know, it ain't perfect and
    neither am I.\r\n\r\nI always - well not always always - try to incorporate that
    signature/tag/squiggle/stick figure thing into my more important stuff. Few other
    examples I've posted <a href=\"http://typophile.com/node/89277\">here</a> ...
    and <a href=\"http://typophile.com/node/42386\">here</a> on Typophile.\r\n\r\nIt
    all started when DONDI, Haring and SAMO did theirs ... I just had to get one up
    of my very own.\r\n\r\n :)"

  body: Now that you mention it, it does sort of look like a gun. I like the figure
    but it's so abstract that it's like a rorschach test. When I first looked at it
    the head it reminded me of the Westinghouse logo.

    his direction is fine.
