  body: I thought Olympics as well, mostly because of the colors or the "ribbons,"
    which are, if not identical, very similar to ones in the Olympic rings. People
    can't really give a very good critique unless they have more context, like what
    is this logo for? Where will it be used? Also, I think you'll find a lot of resistance
    here for no other reason than this is for a design contest. The vast majority
    of users here (myself included) do not approve of commercial design contests.
    Troll a bit and you're sure to find several threads which will explain that position
    more fully.

  body: Haven't had my caffeine yet, I thought it was for a band contest like American
    Idol. Although the weaving bands made me think it was for a race. I'm curious
    what is a "latin america brand"? Brand of or for what? Is the product a contest
    or are you submitting to a contest?

  body: "It's really hard to critique a logo without context. Is this a business?
    An event? An organization? What are the objectives? Granted, if this is a contest,
    those things are usually missing and, as such, are one of many reasons why contests
    are usually a bad idea. \r\n\r\nAt the moment, we can only judge aesthetics. \r\n\r\nLooking
    at the letter forms, I'm seeing inconsistency in stroke weight. Compare your strokes
    in the 't' with the 'a'. \r\n\r\n"

    Argentina.  The main thing is to criticize the construction of the logo and not
    the rest.\r\n\r\ni think maybe the logotype can work alone and not with the isotype.\r\nexcuse
    me the English, this is not my native language.\r\n"

  body: "<em>You believe a logo can be criticized without context?</em>\r\n\r\nOh,
    please. At the very least, as aluminum said, its overall composition and balance
    \ can be commented on and it is pretty darn easy to describe what feelings and
    associations it evokes. Tell me it's not a useful critique to have."

  body: To me this looks like a close relative of the [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_(typeface)|Chicago
    typeface]] of Mac OS fame. Too computer-ish and perhaps scifi-ish.

    in LatinAmerica. the colors represent the variety of races and cultures. the \"logotype\"
    i dont know how to explain but i was inspired by the graphics of many Folkloric
    Bands in Chile like \"Quilapayun\" and \"inti Illimani\".\r\n\r\n\r\nhttp://www.quilapayun.com/index2.html"

    not sure how much of it comes through in what you have posted! I agree with the
    others that the aesthetic seems more like Chicago.\r\n\r\nYou may have seen this
    <a href=\"http://typophile.com/node/59082\" >post</a> which might point you in
    the direction of some more influences, Lance Wyman perhaps.\r\n"
