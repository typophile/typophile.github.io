  body: "Wow, kinda blurry sample, there! It\u2019ll work, though :-)\r\n\r\nLooks
    to be [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/berthold/michelangelo-bq/|Michelangelo BQ]],
    specifically the Alternate set, with that <em>S</em> messed about for a more serpentine
    affect.\r\n\r\nAnd, er, you\u2019ve been posting to Typophile longer than myself
    \u2013 so no disrespect intended \u2013 but please post a more descriptive heading
    for font id requests, like <em>Help ID Classic Roman Serif Font.</em>\r\n\r\nPeace,\r\nWilliam
    Leverette"

    one.\r\nYou're right, looks like Michelangelo BQ Alternate.\r\n\r\nThanks for
    your help.\r\nCesar."
