body: "I'm exploring using Neufville Digital's Futura as body text in a student workbook
  for learning a medical-software programming language. The text is broken into short
  one- or two-paragraph frames accompanied by Q&A and hands-on programming exercises.
  These short frames are designed to be read only one at a time, followed by breaks
  to program or answer questions. The text is set with plenty of interline spacing,
  12/18, to help clarify Futura's less sturdy measures, and it's set ragged right
  to protect the word and character spacing. My hope is that these choices will help
  protect the color and texture of the page.\r\n\r\nThe code samples are set in Deja
  Vu Sans Mono, since we always program in a monospaced face, and the usual choice
  of Courier, well, . . . Since this a programming language that tends to be written
  in all caps, and since Deja Vu Sans Mono is darker and larger, I've set it 10/18,
  which brings it close to Futura Book's weight; I used the same inter-line spacing
  as the regular text to help protect the rhythm of the weave. The code samples are
  set off from the regular text by a hairline text box with healthy internal border
  spacing to help distinguish it from the text and to keep the regular text on its
  grid; the box is flush with the regular text paragraphs to help protect the integrity
  of the measure.\r\n\r\nWithin the simple structure of short frames, the text is
  difficult to set. It contains a mix of regular text, acronyms, titles of works,
  titles that include acronyms, code to look at, code to type, code quoted within
  the text itself (including alpha-numeric variable names), the names of keys off
  a keyboard (including escape and control sequences), formal terms from the system
  model, answers to be covered up until the questions have been solved, answers that
  include code, and so on. For such a complex text, my possibly misguided instinct
  is that slowing the reader down by emphasizing legibility over readability is the
  right way to go, with simpler, easier-to-decipher letterforms, figures, and punctuation.
  In programming, mistaking even a single character can cause the software to fail.\r\n\r\nNevertheless,
  I take seriously the frequently expressed opinions of Hrant and others that Futura
  is problematic for extended text. Therefore, I have two questions for this community
  for experts.\r\n\r\nFirst, because this text is broken into short frames, and because
  it is intended to be studied and pondered rather than read briskly, does that exempt
  this text from the rule about Futura being unsuitable for extended text? If not,
  I'm certainly open to rethinking the book design; it's still in manuscript form
  and set in styles to make it relatively easy to change. I'm not looking for validation
  for what I've done so far. However, by the same token neither am I looking for a
  knee-jerk reaction against it. I'm searching for a way to make a difficult subject
  consumable in small bites and looking for the typography that best supports that.\r\n\r\nSecond,
  if we do stick with Futura I want to set it as well as I can, so can anyone point
  me to successful examples of Futura used for extended body text? For example, Bringhurst
  argues that Futura can be used as body text, but from my experience with it so far
  I'd concur with earlier posters who argue that it is challenging enough that perhaps
  it takes a master typographer to set well. Does anyone know of examples of Bringhurst
  himself (or anyone comparable) setting extended text in Futura?"

  body: "You have made a thoughtful if theoretical argument. I suspect that most people
    are not used to reading Futura. And that lack of familiarity will make it harder
    for them not take in what is being written or reduce their speed in a meaningful
    way - their ability to make use of it will be probably be less.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.apa.org/monitor/2010/11/read-onscreen.aspx\r\n\r\nStill,
    it might be worth posting the kind of layout you intend. I can imagine this sort
    of thing up to a point but seeing it is likely to encourage a more substantial
    and more detailed response.\r\n\r\nBut leaving all of this aside the thing that
    strikes me about your task is that you need an unusual amount of visual distinction
    to be do this well. I would describe this as a need for semantic or role distinction
    within the text. I get this idea from the paragraph below.\r\n\r\n\" Within the
    simple structure of short frames, the text is difficult to set. It contains a
    mix of regular text, acronyms, titles of works, titles that include acronyms,
    code to look at, code to type, code quoted within the text itself (including alpha-numeric
    variable names), the names of keys off a keyboard (including escape and control
    sequences), formal terms from the system model, answers to be covered up until
    the questions have been solved, answers that include code, and so on.\"\r\n\r\nGiven
    that this is the case the question seems to me - what combination of layout and
    font style options will give you sufficient support for all these distinctions?
    If that is the primary question I don't think Futura is a defendable option. I
    don't think It will give you enough distinctive styles.\r\n"

    reading it on a plane coming back from Indonesia - just to say that there were
    some objective obstacles. And you know what? I had no problems in reading it at
    all; as far as I remember the text could have been set a little bigger, but I

  body: "I agree that Futura <em>is</em> problematic for body text. But that doesn't
    mean that one should exaggerate the extent of the problem. I would rate it as
    only slightly worse than, say, Helvetica. (Univers is significantly better, although
    still only by a small amount, but a small but <em>definite</em> amount, than Helvetica
    for body text, although to my eyes it is a less attractive face.)\r\n\r\nEven
    an inferior typeface based on Futura for use with crude proportional-spacing typewriters,
    Mid-Century, was used for many manuals for Xerox and Digitial Equipment Corporation
    computers (instead of a more conventional serif Roman like Documentary).\r\n\r\nIf
    you want the highest possible readability, therefore, I would not recommend Futura.
    But the degree to which readability is compromised is so slight in practice that
    if Futura suits the look or the mood you wish to create, I see no reason not to
    go for it. I would even say the same about Kabel.\r\n\r\n"

    posits, I'd hope this is the kind of project for which it would work - it's computer
    science, medical software, neutral, techie, engineering, and intended to be read
    in short bites - so I'd like to wrestle with it publicly a bit to see what we
    can do with it.\r\n\r\nIf, in the end, we can't make it work, I'll switch to something
    else. I'm researching my backup options now in case we have to abandon Futura
    for this project."

  body: "When picking a typeface for a text, it is often wise to stop a minute and
    look at your motives. Are you picking this typeface because it is the best way
    to present the text? Or are other motives involved \"See, I can do it,\" or \"No
    one has ever done this before.\" Sometimes motives are more pedestrian, as with
    \"I'm so tired of the typeface that would be best for this text.\"\r\n\r\nMost
    of us with any spirit fall prey to this from time to time. I've heard any number
    of designers give elaborate theoretical arguments why their choice was perfect
    for the piece. Except in rare instances, they've been wrong. (And truth to tell,
    I've done this too.)\r\n\r\nSo the question comes up, are you posting here to
    get a bit of validation? That would seem to indicate you've got some doubts.\r\n\r\nI'd
    turn the question around. Can Futura be made to work? Probably. Could another
    typeface be chosen that would work as well with less effort by both the typesetter
    (letterfit, kerning, spacing) and the reader? If so, at least you know your motives.
    Would another typeface work better? Now that makes it hard -- your motives are
    in conflict with the best interests of project. \r\n\r\nIf either of the last
    two are true, the typeface that is chosen is the result of who has final say,
    rather than the text and the reader. Happens all the time."
