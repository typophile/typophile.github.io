  body: This may not be an actual typeface, then.. It rather looks like a custom raw
    / rough / grunge / remixed / filtered version, because none of the &#39;O&#39;s,
    for example, looks the same.. <BR><i>&#40; Maybe you could use, and abuse, a ultra
    condensed version of &#39;<a href="http://www.linotype.com/1560/univers-family.html"
    target="_blank">Univers</a>&#39; or a compressed version of &#39;<a href="http://www.linotype.com/526/helvetica-family.html"
    target="_blank">Helvetica</a>&#39; with various filters to imitate this kind of
    &#39;style&#39;.. &#41;</i>
