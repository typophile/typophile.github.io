  I unlock them all the time, but the next glyph I open they are locked again. I have
  taken over the project from someone else, and its bugging me.\r\n\r\nBug or feature?"

    experience, the source of this kind of problem is often someone else's bizarre
    work habits. Generate a font with what you have, open the font in FontLab, and
    re-save it as a .vfb file...this OUGHT to get rid of the voodoo the previous artist
    put into the file."
