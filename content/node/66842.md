  willing to give some logo-making advice: I'd like to take a shot at making a logo
  for a research group at a Scottish university, consisting essentially only of a
  few letters (probably \"E-CoS\" or \"E-CS\"). Are there any typefaces typical of
  Scotland or of Britain of the Edwardian era that would go nicely as a logotype?\r\n\r\nThanks!"

    I'm personally a bit intimidated by its high contrast.\r\n\r\nCan you think of
    anything Georgian by chance (other than Baskerville)?"

    be more significant than the fact that they're Scottish. For one thing, the people
    doing the research are probably not all Scottish, and the results of their research
    surely benefit more than just Scotland!\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: 'hrant: That''s right, of course. It''s mathematical research into data processing.
    They''re certainly not all Scottish, but it''d be nice to give the logo some local
    flavour and a traditional look -- there are far too many generic-looking moderny-kind
    of logos out there already :-)'
