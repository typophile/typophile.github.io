  to set beautifully (=kerned) no matter how the user choose to write text with it.\r\nOn
  the other hand the whole InterCaps debate is a touchy typographic subject, and it
  IS a bit of extra work (and results in quite a lot of extra kernpairs - even with
  class kerning).\r\n\r\nFor some fonts I have kerned for InterCaps but for others
  not - taking into account what I imagine they will be used for ;)\r\n\r\nSo I'm
  curious to know: what is your \"modus operandi\"? And your reasons for doing so?"

  body: I don't kern for InterCaps, because there are too many sequences of "lc-CAP-lc"
    where the first space is much smaller than the second, which results in the intercap
    looking like it is attached to and part of the first word, whereas it should be
    obviously part of the second.

  body: "Good point about the mixed uc/lc sequences. Another issue is that space may
    need adjustment if next to all-caps words spaced/kerned for all-caps setting.
    This can get tricky especially if one wants to deal with one-letter-words, but
    it is doable.\r\n\r\nSo far I <em>did</em> care for all-caps setting -- not by
    kerning but by adjusting caps' sidebearings contextually in all-caps context.
    However, re-thinking my production workflow right now, I wonder if this was too
    much work for an effect that obviously nobody would even notice: Looking around,
    I see all-caps logos and headlines, typeset in typefaces that obviously are not
    prepared for this, and lacking any manual intervention by the designer/typographer.
    Speaking of respected foundries and respected design agencies here. Since there
    are no outcries by otherwise over-critical fellows (on design forums and blogs)
    my conclusion is that there is no need for this level of quality."

  body: The most annoying part if you don't kern for InterCaps is when you write promotion
    text for your font IN your font - and use the words OpenType and TrueType. Those
    InterCaps Ts can look really horrible if they are not kerned... Wouldn't it then
    be a bit "dishonest" to manually kern those instances in your font promotion?

  body: Sorry, I understood inter-caps to mean all-caps. However, yes, doing inter-caps
    kerning too, it is not <em>that</em> much extra work.

    about kerning and tracking and assume that a type specimen has had some applied
    to get good showings at different sizes. "
