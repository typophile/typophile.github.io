  body: "What I am looking to get, at this point, is a sense of what opportunities
    involvement in any group might bring. It appears that ATypI is a professional
    group and SOTA is an enthusiast's, to probably oversimplify. The other groups
    Tiffany mentioned I am not familiar with.  I am curious what people have to say
    about each, particularly since I am not connected to \"the type scene\" of my
    area. If there is one.\r\n\r\nSome things I am curious about are the future of
    type and such things as emerging computer typography, DRM and its place in type,
    as well as various things such as independent foundry culture, online collaboration
    tech, and communicating the value of type as media itself. Or just networking.
    I imagine I might learn more at this point by just gathering people's impressions,
    rather than saying, \"I feel so-and-so, who shall I hang with?\"\r\n\r\nI'll have
    to say, in some industries, it was worth the price of memebership, and no other
    commitment, to get the magazine. :)\r\n\r\n<A HREF=\"http://www.chozcunningham.com\">Choz

  body: "Choz, apologies for my entirely too vague comment from last night. (I really
    shouldn't post late at night.)\r\n\r\nOn the surface, yes, ATypI and SOTA, are
    too different orgs. You <em>could</em> separate them as the former being for the
    business and the latter for the enthusiast. But, if you delve under the surface
    you will find many similarities. Both focus on the educational, historical, and
    technical sides as well. You will find more graphic designers at a SOTA conference
    (TypeCon) than you will at ATypI, but both conferences garner support from practicing
    type designers and foundries. As well, both are equally good for networking. Many
    people who attend TypeCon also attend ATypI. \r\n\r\nTypeCon is held once a year
    somewhere in the U.S., this year in Seattle, whereas ATypI travels between continents.
    TypeCon's workshops have a broader interest in the book arts, letterpress, and
    graphic design, but all from a type enthusiasts point of view; as well as having
    workshops on the technical side of type creation. ATypI has the TypeTech forum
    which focuses on type and its creation and use, much more technical and generally
    not for the beginner. Both organizations are determinedly involved with education.
    \r\n\r\nFor instance, if you do want to hear about DRM, all you have to do is
    put a bug in the ear of a board member, me for instance, and we can try to get
    something put together at TypeCon. (The same could be said for ATypI.) Last year,
    Frank Martinez led a discussion about the legal side of things, most specifically
    the EULA and copyright I believe at TypeCon. However, the BEST way to get a talk
    on DRM is to volunteer to speak on it. ;^) Or, to find someone more qualified
    and tell them to volunteer. Volunteering is what keeps both organizations going.
    It is to the volunteers and those that attend and participate that make these
    conferences work and keep the organizations going.\r\n\r\nSimon gave you a very
    good question and I'll have to second that. You will get out of the group what
    you put into it. "

    technology newb, the workshops sound much more appealing than offering lectures
    myself.  I like to 'know-it-all' before offering my opinion in any but the most
    casual circumstances. And public speaking is about as appealing to me as most
    people. Hmm, perhaps I could give a sermon on why the snark is so vital to the
    evolution of communications.~\r\n\r\nIt looks like my budget will be determined
    directly by sales, so I'm not really sure what things will be like, yet. Not sure
    what % must be redirected back to marketing, either. I don't think I will have
    the commercial side of things together until 07. Does anyone have any idea of
    when SOTA's membership restructuring will be online?\r\n\r\n\r\n<A HREF=\"http://www.chozcunningham.com\">Choz
