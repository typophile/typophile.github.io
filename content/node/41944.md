body: "I've been having the most dreary day at work, dreaming about life outside and
  especially type design education. Beyond a fruitless series of Googling another
  thread pointed towards the Typophile Wiki and the following page, but it's a bit
  lost and muddled. That list has no structure and most institutions on there seem
  only to offer graphic design courses with (possibly) a typographic or type based
  element.\r\n\r\nhttp://typophile.com/node/12011\r\n\r\nI'm looking for something
  a bit more specific I suppose. I'm based in London, but that shouldn't be a limiting
  factor. I'd be interested in everything type design related from evening courses
  (like the Experimental Typography at LCP) or big and serious (like the Reading MA).\r\n\r\nA
  list of criteria would be:\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Specifically includes type design
  (i.e. glyph drawing onwards) rather than typesetting, layout or graphic design.
  (I'm already a graphic designer)</li>\r\n<li>Can be mixed though (say with letterpress)</li>\r\n<li>Can
  be just for interest or weighty and serious</li>\r\n<li>Can be anywhere</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\nAny
  ideas much appreciated."

    a visit? I'm sure you'd find lots of people to talk to. As per other options,
    I'm sure that Typophile regulars will chime in\u2026"

    be more about typographic design than type design from [[http://www.werkplaatstypografie.org/wt_informations.pdf|this
