  to pick people's brains on the translation of type to sound. My background is in
  interaction and visual communication design and I'm doing research on designing
  for the blind, specifically via physical interfaces using Arduino and Processing.\r\n\r\nMy
  goal is to create an audible alphabet, if you will, translating type to sound. Is
  anyone aware of previous research in this area?\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\nCallie Neylan"

  body: Helvetica is a sine wave that, depending on the setting, can blend in perfectly
    with the background noise, could have a slightly higher amplitude than the background
    noise, or mutates into an awful saw wave because of negligent attention to crafting
    the appropriate use of the sine wave.

  body: "I love the teacher on Peanuts! Actually, in all seriousness, I need it to
    be very systematic so I can program it in Processing. I've started mapping type
    characteristics to musical notation. Because there need to be subtle sound differences
    between Helvetica Neue Ultra-Light Italic and Helvetica Neue Bold Condensed. How
    to do that?\r\n\r\nThus, scratching my itch to learn more about music theory at
    the same time. Plus, that system already exists, it's universal, versatile, and
    brilliant.\r\n\r\nGenius steals, right? Yeah, we'll see...."

  body: "This is a very, very difficult question. It\u2019s difficult for me to think
    about \u2014 difficult even to begin to know <em>how</em> to think about it. Intuitively
    I sense that you might start to find answers, or hints of answers, or directions,
    by digging deeper into <strong>legibility</strong>. I think that I might start
    there. What makes something legible? Why and how does legibility fail? How might
    those questions be translated to the realm of sound?\r\n\r\nPerhaps looking at
    the work of, or speaking with, someone like, say, <a href=\"http://www.cfa.harvard.edu/dyslexia/LVL/People/Matt.html\">Matthew
    Schneps</a> on <a href=\"http://www.fontbureau.com/blog/minds-for-typography/\">dyslexia</a>
    would be a fruitful starting point? "
