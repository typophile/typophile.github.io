    buy fonts from, saying that they agree to this. THAT would be news.\r\n\r\nUntil
    a reputable independent type foundry announces that they're embracing one of these
    technologies, you can conclude it is not secure enough to be worth the risk."

  body: "Screen fonts are the red-headed stepchild of the font industry. Still.\r\nYou
    cannot even view an accurate sample of so-called \"screen fonts\" online even
    though Internet Explorer for many years has had the capacity via EOT and @font-face
    to do so without, at the same time, also handing over the entire font file in
    the process. (Bitmaps are horribly inaccurate for determining how a browser will
    actually render a font at different sizes.)\r\nI'll be interested when Ascender/Microsoft,
    Adobe, and Monotype sign on to provide fonts for this.\r\nUntil then, it's smoke.
    And IMHO - they'll fail big time. They'll find out it's not just about obtaining
    license agreements and transplanting fonts designed (whether consciously or not)
    with print in mind and slapping them up onscreen.\r\n"

    But that doesn't mean that it is going to happen :(\r\n\r\nThere are so many \"solutions\"
    to the problems of font embedding on the web. But none of them solve the actual
    problem. Fonts in webpages is an IP issue, not a tech one. Designers\u2014and
    the people who pay designers, as well as the people who manage and distribute
    their work\u2014have to want a specific solution(s) to work. Then we can play
    ball."
