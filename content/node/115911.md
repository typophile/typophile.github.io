  to the figure labels that could be seen on some old patents, such as the examples
  provided here. The closest I've found is [[http://www.fonts101.com/fonts/view/Brandname/15468/Regork|Regork]],
  but I was hoping to find other choices, as well. Thanks in advance for any suggestions![img:sites/default/files/old-images/fig2_6594.png][img:sites/default/files/old-images/fig14_6651.png]"
