  body: The M and G don&#39;t look like Futura to me. Not sure what it is, though.

  body: At first I thought it was Gill Sans, but now I&#39;m not so sure. It&#39;s
    kind of small and blurry. <BR> <BR> - Lex

  body: I think it&#39;s <a href="http://www.fontbureau.com/fonts/Nobel" target="_blank">Nobel</a>
    which looks like Gill Sans but with some Futura mixed in. <BR> <BR> - Lex

  body: Of the geometric-sans faces, I think <a href="http://www.identifont.com/show?61G">Erbar</a>
    comes closest. Note the central vee of the M, which is lower than Nobel&#39;s.
