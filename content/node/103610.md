body: "I'm about to buy the Plume Advertising font from Dalton Maag for a project.
  It is just a slab serif as voluptuous and playful as I need, but I'm with a little
  doubt. \r\n\r\nConsidering the specific composition of words below, what do you
  people think is the best version of \"R\"? The upper version is the original one,
  and below is the one I effed up with.\r\n\r\nI just can't come to a conclusion on
  which version better balances the quirky details and the color (disconsidering the
  shitty kerning used here). Isn't \"ALEGRE\" looking to much excentric in comparison
  to \"PORTO\" in my version?\r\n\r\nHope you can help me! :)\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/ecb2f65de761c71aee101238bd7070b_6234.jpg]"

    is too dense in comparison to PORTO, perhaps take the serif off \u201CG\u201D
    and shorten its right stem a bit? You might also try moving the leg of \u201CR\u201D
    (or the whole right side) a little to the right, if the tight counter is an issue."
