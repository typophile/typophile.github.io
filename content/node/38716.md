  body: 'After a brief search online for Richard Gans types (a real eye-opener, BTW,
    as I had never heard of him), it looks like Intellecta has for some reason departed
    from doing a straight piece of history mining, and nuanced its revival with some
    Densmore stylings. '

  body: "One more thing: I occasionally use the blend tool in FontLab to blend fonts.
    For example: Chinese Rocks + Tank = Croteau. I have a handy back catalogue of
    a few hundred families to use as blend fodder. I once experimented blending some
    OPFs* in FontLab - just for kicks, not to create fonts to sell or give away. Didn't
    save 'em. Just playing. Mkay?\r\n\r\nThe most troublesome letter in blends is
    lowercase g. The structure is often different (monocular vs. binocular) and results
    in a mangled mess or a failed \"red\" glyph. A lazy solution is to suture a j
    to a q to produce a single storey g.\r\n\r\nWhat I'm getting at is: nothing. I'm
    just saying what what? Blend OPFs and then look at Intellecta fonts. Then look
    at your blended OPFs. Then look at Intellecta fonts again. Repeat until drowsy.\r\n\r\nBack
    to Densmore. Check out the rest of the character set. Even the little blade screwdriver
    head on the exclamation point.\r\n\r\n\"Intellactual Property\" would have been
    a better topic heading now that I think about it.\r\n\r\n* other people's fonts"

  body: "<a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/nicksfonts/faerie-queen-nf/\" target=\"_blank\">This
    font</a> is a reasonably faithful rendering of Gans Titania, in which the lowercase
    letters bear no resemblance whatsoever to the Intellecta version. I'd say Ray
    has a good case for concluding that his outlines were hijacked, which wouldn't
    be the first time.\r\n\r\nAt the present time, Jupiter Images is selling access
    to a font repository that contains a large number of freeware fonts (Ray's, mine
    and a lot of other folks') that were pirated by an outfit called Art I Need five
    or so years ago. It appears that their standard MO was to open freeware fonts
    in Fontographer, rename them, claim copyright ownership, and then peddle them.
    For reasons which may or may not have anything to do with this underhanded practice,
    the company went out of business a few years back, but not before selling a number
    of the pirated fonts to Jupiter Images. Bummer..."
