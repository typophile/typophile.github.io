  with Rodrigo Fuenzalida. And we are doing it 'In the open', posting all the betas
  as we make progress, and encouraging public participation and feedback.\r\n\r\nI
  started this back in November 2011, and then put it to sleep because of the lack
  of high quality sources.\r\n\r\nBut something awesome happened:\r\nA very generous
  and humble Benedictine monk, that have the original metal cut, printed a specimen
  just for us and sent a high-quality scan. And we like to share it with the world.\r\n\r\nNow
  the project is back to life! We are currently on Beta21.\r\nAnd, as usual, it will
  be released under the SIL Open font license.\r\n\r\nThere is a little system in
  place, for easy sharing of comments and source files.\r\nHere you will find the
  latest betas and source files (and the high-res scanned specimen):\r\nhttp://www.impallari.com/projects/overview/jan-van-krimpen-cancelleresca-bastarda-revival\r\n\r\nWe
  will like to invite everyone to check it out, and participate! \r\nYou can make
  any edit to the sources you see fit, and post it back in the project comments.\r\n\r\nBeta21

  body: "<P>Before we begin thinking the GHD IV Styler is following the same trend
    as video & DVD players, lets take just show just a few major differences. Firstly,
    the GHD IV Styler has almost nothing realistic competition. The GHD IV styler
    is widely regarded for a consumer and high end (hairdressers) while the number
    1 hair styling tool.Secondly, as techniology developes the money necessary production
    reduces thus retail prices reduce. Well my answer suggestions that GHD haven\u2019t
    handed over, any reduction in production costs with the retailer (salon owners).
    In fact cost prices have gone up resulting from <a href=\"http://www.louisvuittonpursebag.com/\"><strong>louis
    vuitton bags</strong></a>  a surge in the RRP. Here we are at in the event the
    GHD MK1 to <a href=\"http://www.coachfactoryoutleti.org/\"><strong>coach factory
    outlet</strong></a>  Mk3 were discounted one of the a RRP of ??99, the actual
    MK4 GHD styler provides a RRP of ??119.</P><P></P><P>Exactly what continues to
    be lowering the retail prices? The result we have found simple. Online competition,
    with online retailer endeavoring to out do eath other ghd hair straightener for
    being the lowest priced website for GHD IV Styler . I personally, work at a hairdressing
    salon <a href=\"http://www.coachoutletonlinepicke.com/\"><strong>coach outlet
    online</strong></a>  and i know which price range of GHD IV Styler. Despite that
    these web based stores receive massive discounts on there products, they could
    still merely be making between <a href=\"http://www.coachoutletonline-bag.com/\"><strong>coach
    outlet online</strong></a>  ??6-8 a hard and fast and perhaps any loss. I possed
    this with a senior GHD worker from a GHD event in the year. Her response, was
    which she believed, people were with their company as loss leaders to operate
    individuals to there sites. In the hope they retain the prospect for <a href=\"http://www.buyscoachoutletonline.net/\"><strong>coach
    outlet online</strong></a>  future purchases of hair & bath and body goods.I cannot
    really buy into this theory.Lots of individuals will for sure invest in a straightners
    without additional shampoos and styling products. So, i\u2019m not really really
    sure the way this works, in the form of long-term business strategy. The very
    first thing for several though, would be that the consumer might be gaining from
    these reduced prices. </P><P></P><P>In order <a href=\"http://www.coachpurseoutletss.net/\"><strong>cheap
    coach purses</strong></a>  to find out about GHD and locate the ideal price on
    GHD hair straighteners, <a href=\"http://www.cheapcoachbagusas.com/\"><strong>cheap

    about Britney Spears and her hair disasters are not uncommon, but was damage to
    britney\u2019s hair just before the infamous shaving incident caused buy faulty,
    broken or damaged ghd hair straighteners? Faulty ghd\u2019s usually are not all
    that uncommon and so they can on occasions over-heat and cause terminal damage
    to curly hair. Maybe Britney must have used a ghd repair service, there are a
    couple companies these days which can participate in a ghd repair shop with regard
    to ??19.95 likely the biggest ghd repair company in england and wales is Ion Originals
    Ltd. they run websites that include www.ghdrepair.co.uk It is advisable to get
    those ghd\u2019s inspected they were eradicated or become faulty.Common ghd faults
    include: sparking, buzzing, intermittent power, cable faults & over-heating. </P><P></P>"

  body: "Hi Jens, thanks! \r\n\r\nThose and the Kris's flickr photo were the best
    we could get. \r\nWe will love to have access to even better sources, like photos
    of the metal punches or original drawings, but sadly we don't so we have to guess
    a lot of the details.\r\n\r\nIt's not just me. Rodrigo is also doing a lot of
    work.\r\nHe does the first round during the day and I iterate and refine during
    the night, and we chat over Skpye to discuss ideas.\r\n\r\nI'm also studying \"Three
    Classic of Italian Calligraphy\" by Oscar Ogg (facsimile reproductions of Arrighi,
    Tagliente and Palatino), and \"Penmanship of the XVI, XVII & XVIIIth centuries\"
    witch can be read online here: http://www.archive.org/stream/penmanshipofxvix00dayluoft#page/n7/mode/2up\r\n\r\nAlso,
    playing and writing with a variety of nib pens to try to get a better sense of
    the flow and the contrast.\r\n\r\nWe sincerely hope that this can be good revival,
    and we are putting all our effort to make it as good as possible. But we can't
    do it alone, we need all the help and feedback from everyone. That's the only
    way we can improve it.\r\n\r\nWe also have the previous digital CB revival by
    Richard Beatty, called Romus (the entire romus family) but it's not of any help,
    because it lacks all the details we are trying to include in our version, and
    it's also pretty different from the specimens. In fact, one of the reasons for
    doing this new revival, was that I was not happy with the one from Richard.\r\n\r\nWe
    still have a lot to improve (the spacing in particular) but we are making progress
    every day.\r\n\r\n"

    the original spacing. However the process\r\nWilliam describes seems too iterative;
    I'd use math,\r\nand start with an \"nn\" you might hopefully find.\r\n\r\nBut
    that's assuming you like the original's spacing...\r\nA revival can be faithful
    in various flavors; since CR\r\nwas a metal type, adhering to the original spacing
    can\r\npotentially be seen as a bit <em>too</em> faithful. You might study\r\nJFP's
    revival of Sabon (they once produced a highly\r\nrevealing booklet about it) to
    see ways of figuring out\r\nwhat compromises were originally made and why, in\r\norder
    to decide what original decisions to over-ride.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
