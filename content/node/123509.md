  body: "Looks nice but light bulbs are used in thousands of logos. I have 2 clients
    with light bulb logos. So it's hard to come up with anything unique.\r\n\r\nA
    quick Google for \"Light Bulb Logo\" produces some that are similar, but I didn't
    see an exact match. But it's probably out there somewhere.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/bulb_6080.jpg]"

  body: "Yes, there are thousands of light bulb logos, but I think your symbol has
    enough potential to outshine  \u2013 no pun intended \u2013 most of them. The
    brush stroke feels natural and pulls it away from <a href=\"https://www.google.no/search?q=lightbulb+logo&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ei=-KjwVNHkDcGEPNSJgNAO&ved=0CAcQ_AUoAQ&biw=1408&bih=762\">other
    competitors</a>. If anything, have another look at the weight distribution in
    the bulb. \r\n\r\nSometimes an excellent execution is all it takes. "
