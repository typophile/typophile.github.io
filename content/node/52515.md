  body: "If it's a matter of changing the color of them to another, then add the new
    color to your swatches and then delete the old color (it'll ask for a replacement
    swatch to change the old color to a new color, i.e. the new swatch you just added.)
    \r\n\r\nAs for a group selection, I don't believe you can select an object based
    on color. "
