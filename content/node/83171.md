  first attached file is from my high school, and I knew it once before but I can't
  seem to recall it. It is most noticably displayed on the R with the split leg and
  segments\r\n\r\nThe second font is really generic and seemingly just italic, but
  rather then just get close to a font that matches, if someone could notice something
  I didn't, it would be much appreciated.\r\n\r\nThank you again"

    looks like Colonna. The 'generic' font is the italic for Berkeley Old Style by
    Frederic Goudy.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
