  Unicode page)?\r\n\r\nCould anyone tell me if it is possible (theoretically or actually)
  through Opentype programming to have access in Indesign to 3 or more types of character
  sets such as:\r\n\r\n1. TypefaceNameContemporaryStyle\r\n2. TypefaceNameOldStyle\r\n3.
  TypefaceNameArchaicStyle\r\n\r\nAnd all the above to be included in a single Opentype
  font (without resolving to alternates and such) ? Is it possible and if it is, how
  could it be done?\r\n\r\n"

    such a scheme would be by using Stylistic Sets 0 through 20. The downside of this
    is that you can't give the sets names, and support is fairly limited. At present,
    the only apps I know of that support Stylistic Sets are Adobe InDesign and Mac
    OS X Cocoa-based apps. \r\n\r\nHowever, unless you foresee the three different
    styles as likely being used together in the same word (i.e., with the three styles
    kerning with each other), you would be better off making them separate fonts."

    TTC file is just a single file that functions as multiple truetype files. In fact
    the user will see all components of the TTC as if they were separately installed
    fonts. But, that's a limitation, they're going to have to switch between styles
    just as if they were separate fonts.\r\nFor that reason, I don't think this will
    help you much. \r\n\r\nIf you don't mind reading spcs, there's info about it about
    1/2way down this page:\r\n[[http://www.microsoft.com/typography/otspec/otff.htm]]"
