body: "I am hoping that someone on this list might be able to assist me in identifying
  a specific font.  However, the unidentified font is not from a printed work, but
  rather on an Irish copper token from the 1790's.  In the standard production of
  coinage dies, letter punches were created to punch the various legends into the
  obverse and reverse of the dies used to create tokens or coins.\r\n\r\nI am working
  on a book related to these specific tokens, and if it all possible, I would like
  to identify the typeface used on these tokens.  I have created a very minimal webpage
  that includes images of the obverse and reverse of the token, as well as close-ups
  of the individual letters.  The webpage is available at:\r\n\r\n    http://copland.udel.edu/~gregg/camac.htm\r\n\r\n\r\nAny
  assistance or suggestions would be greatly appreciated and would of course be acknowledged
  in any publications.\r\n\r\nThank you very much!\r\n\r\n  -- Gregg A. Silvis\r\n"

  body: Do you know who was the founder of these coins? You mention Irish, but do
    you have a name? I doubt it will be a typeface, but it is an interesting question
    from a historic point of view.

  body: "Gregg,\r\n\r\nHaving had a more than passing interest in numismatics at one
    point in my life, I think I can state with some certainty that the lettering on
    this coin is not a specific typeface, but rather an amalgam or workable letters
    in the punch-cutter's bag of tricks. Also, stylistically the letters and numbers
    really don't belong together.\r\n\r\nIf you're looking for something close to
    these letters, your might consider Letteror's <a href=\"http://www.letterror.com/catalog/fed/index.html\"
    target=\"_blank\">Federal Series</a>; the numbers are another story -- their design
    reminds me of early sixteenth-century stuff. You might check out <a href=\"http://www.fontcraft.com/csa/fontcraft.php\"
