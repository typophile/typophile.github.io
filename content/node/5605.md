body: 'Looking for folks using Master Juggler. I bought it and was using it happily
  for a few weeks. Then I tried to install a Mac TrueType file and funkiness ensued.
  As I&#39;m importing, it checks for errors &#40;which is nice&#41;. But for every
  TrueType font, I get &#34;The PostScript outline file is missing.&#34; And subsequently,
  can&#39;t install these fonts. Anyone else run across this?  <BR> <BR>Secondly,
  life is fairly SLOW as you scroll through the &#39;Samples&#39;. I get mad about
  this.  <BR> <BR>These are my issues. If I can move beyond these, I can still be
  happy about buying Master Juggler. Something tells me the slowness in the &#39;Samples&#39;
  is something I need to get over, and just live with. '

    its unicode-ness. Handles OpenType and TrueType just fine for me. <BR>

  body: Jon, you have hit on the two major knocks on MasterJuggler. <BR> <BR>MJs error
    checking can and should be disabled in prefs. It is so out of date, and really
    gives false &#39;problem&#39; answers that majority of the time &#40;as do most
    font checkers of this sort&#41;. While many of the reported &#39;errors&#39; are
    possible in a certain set of circumstances, very few of these occur anymore. Including
    this &#39;feature&#39; is an error that Alsoft has not rectified &#40;by simply
    getting rid of&#41;. <BR> <BR>The sample scrolling is simply too slow to be useful
    as you have discovered, and can be easily accomplished through other shareware
    programs. The good news is that MJ happily works at the same time as other font
    apps are activated &#40;and this is as true in OS 9 as in OS X&#41;. <BR> <BR>Those
    two items are the major downside, the upside is that it is a great and rock solid
    font activation/deactivation tool that doesn&#39;t mess around with the OS or
    your programs - and consequently does not need updated all the time as many others
    do.

  body: 'thanks for the feedback. yesterday, i dove in and realized that while reporting
    errors, TrueType fonts do indeed work just fine in MJ. And I found the option
    in the preferences where you can turn that stuff off. they should definitely change
    that though... that could REALLY confuse folks that have purchased TrueType fonts.  <BR>
    <BR>i&#39;m hoping they improve the speed. it&#39;s annoying. not only that, it
    will sometimes taken a million years to open the application. it stalls here and
    there.  <BR> <BR>like i said, i really like Master Juggler. It&#39;s just these
    bumps that get me all frazzled...  <BR> <BR>michael, what shareware programs are
    you using for type samples? '
