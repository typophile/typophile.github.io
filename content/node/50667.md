  or something along those lines, does anyone know what font they use? I know very
  little about all this, so it may well simply be Times New Roman and I just can't
  tell.\r\n\r\nAlso, how does everyone feel about papyrus? I feel like it's the most
  horrendous thing available, but I see it everywhere, even on professionally designed
  things like major motion pictures and packaging. Am I wrong, or are there a lot
  of bad designers out there?\r\n\r\nThanks."

    text faces outside of the big guns, most of the time. But out of 4 older novels
    from the 40s to 70s lying nearby (2 Bantam, 1 Ballantine and 1 Lancer) 3 appear
    to be Baskerville and one (the Ballantine) is definitely Bembo."

  body: "I apologize. I'm not a very professional designer. In fact, I'm not one at
    all. But that wasn't a very helpful response, aside from reprimanding me.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nuppercaseH,
    thank you very much. I suppose I should take a picture of a specific book and
    ask in the font ID forum."
