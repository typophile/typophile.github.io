  for almost every job you work on (for a while)? Same with colours etc.\r\n\r\nI
  do. Most recent is compressed sans serif for identities.\r\n\r\nAtleast I'm aware
  of it occuring, so will open up a whole new world through the awareness.\r\n\r\n"

    if something worked really well last time, it would be natural to tend towards
    using it again (or at least trying it..)\r\n\r\nself awareness is a good thing.
    \ mine unfortunately tends to be ironic, where i see myself doing it but am seemingly
    powerless to change the behaviour.."

    body: "I work with other designers and different design firms and I've noticed
      this myself--but it varies from firm to firm (and city to city) and it might
      have something to do with experience. \r\n\r\nWhen I was at Chermayeff & Geismar
      (47 years in the design business), it hardly ever happened--those guys knew
      what they wanted and were never afraid to experiment--one project would be Garamond,
      another in DIN, while we're were doing a CI in Charlotte. One designer there
      did go through an Interstate phase, though.\r\n\r\nBut at newer firms with younger
      designers, or outside NYC, I've noticed that not only will a designer stick
      with a typestyle over several projects, but everyone else in the studio will
      start using it (or similiar), too. Actually makes my job easier.:)"

    same CD's, watching the same kind of movies, using the same kind of fonts and
    colours for a few weeks and then graduately shift into a new phase again.\r\nRight
    now, I have a Placebo / the Rakes / the Dead 60's, black & white (with a hint
    of red & lightblue here & there), Mest  (http://surfstation.lu/07/mest.htm) phase."

  body: Yeah, I bleed a font to death then shelve it for awhile. Luckily I have a
    wide range of clients so they don't know I'm repeating myself. But when I get
    a crush on a font, it's hard to beat the addiction.

  body: "It's difficult to get away from repeating yourself when it comes to sign
    design. I have to fight the urge to lapse back to just using Frutiger for a lot
    of things.\r\n\r\nLots of sign designers, unfortunately, just grab the first sans
    they see in the font menu: Arial. They load it and then distort it to fit the
    space. Ugh."

  body: "Agreed.   I find myself doing this and as Michelemiller suggests, im my case
    its to do with experience.  \r\n\r\nI mostly typeset lightweight trade ads for
    newsprint (so i guess it doesnt matter!) and find myself relying on a fairly solid
    set of 2-plate process colours, and more often than not i'll set body copy in
    gill or officina sans with Univers or Gill Compressed, or maybe DIN for headings
    and Chaparral Italic for leadlines and accents. \r\n\r\nI'm sure this will change
    over time, as I become exposed to more styles and experiment more.  But for the
    meantime I think its okay so long as I'm aware.\r\n\r\nMaybe good typefaces are
    like like good wine, in that you dont start to appreciate the finer points of
    its characteristics until you've had the same (good) one a few times?\r\n "

  body: "I think typefaces are a bit like clothing.\r\n\r\nSome kinds of clothing,
    like jeans, go with a lot of stuff. You can wear tennis shoes, loafers, boots,
    sandals or just go barefoot while wearing jeans. Pleated slacks aren't quite so
    versatile. The same kind of thing occurs with typefaces. Some faces can be safely
    used with many other kinds of fonts without drawing reactions like, \"dude, what
    were you thinking that day?\" It's just like that clothing comment, \"you're not
    going to wear that shirt with those slacks, are you?\"\r\n\r\nI think playing
    it safe is the biggest source of one repeating himself. Of course, one may just
    fall in love with a particular typeface and just have to use on all sorts of stuff.\r\n\r\n"
