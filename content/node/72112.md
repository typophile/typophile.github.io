  body: "I agree about the handwritten comment. At first I thought maybe this lettering
    was on fabric, but I don't think that's the reason that the same letters look
    different. I think if you want informal handwriting styles you can find many,
    but I don't think you can find an exact match for this (I just looked at almost
    1000 fonts, before i decided it was hand-written). Search for 'informal handwriting'
    at MyFonts, or else go to Dafaont or Abstract Fonts and look at handwriting fonts.\r\n\r\n-

  body: "Thank you guys! Just so you know, this is a jpeg of a t-shirt. That's why
    you may have had same letters that look different. Now knowing this, do you think
    you may be able to identify the font?\r\n\r\nThanks again... "

  body: "I'm afraid not. As I mentioned I searched quite a bit first, with that assumption.
    The problem is that this font is a hand-printed style, and as we say in the FAQ
    this kind of font can be made by anyone for very little money. They only need
    to be able to draw letters inside a template form and they can create a font.
    (I've done it, so I know how little skill it takes.)\r\n\r\nFor this reason it
    is rarely worth the time it would take to search. Just find something with a similar
    feel and go with that. There are too many fonts to hope to see them all.\r\n\r\n-
