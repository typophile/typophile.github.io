  body: ' I am well familiar with her work and was properly one of the first designers
    to purchase her fonts. I got Envision back in 94&#39; when it was $125 in Beta
    &#40;unkerned, missing characters&#41;, when I later tried to get the finished
    version &#40;which I was told would be a free upgrade&#41; I was told that Envision
    had never been sold, strange. I wonder if someone in the studio released it without
    permission? <BR>Anyway, I suspect this specimen is not done by Margo Chase, it
    seens too structured and her work is generally not so. I also find more wit and
    humor in her work. This one is too clean and well behaved to be a MC job. '
