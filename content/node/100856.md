body: "Hello!\r\n\r\nI'm studying graphic design in Norway (seccond year),  currently
  \ I'm designing a magazine about Caf\xE9 Racers, both the history and present.  I'm
  going for a stripped down, fast look.\r\n\r\nI've attached a few sample pages with
  typography and I would very much like to get some feedback on the typography. Does
  the font's fit the type of magazine, is size, spacing, kerning good? etc\u2026 \r\n\r\nOpinions
  on layout is also welcomed :)\r\n\r\n- Even Dragsten\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Okay, mostly negatives to look at but that is usually the way of critiquing
    \u2013 doesn't mean it is all bad!\r\n\r\nNot sure about using Gridnik along with
    the other typeface. Your usage of it looks good, but doesn't go with the serif
    (I guess it is too old fashioned, a more modern serif would work).\r\nBody text
    seems fine in terms of spacing, your standfirst (article intro) is a bit too tight
    in terms of leading. Not sure about starting paragraphs bold and bigger, one too
    many things, try either/or (and take out completely). Not sure about it being
    fully justified either, again it is old fashioned and can look really clumsy (eg
    page 8).\r\nUse apostrophes (\u2019), not feet marks (') (page 21 headline, between
    'n' and 's').\r\n\r\nAfraid that is all I have time for, good luck!"

  body: If you can find a better body face, pref. one with larger x-height, slightly
    sharper contrast (i.e. Swift, Tiempos), that would be awesome. Amazing layout!
    :D
