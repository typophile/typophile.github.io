body: "I am working on a typeface and not looking forward to the idea of redesigning
  each glyph for every single [[weight]], so I'm very interested in generating some
  of the weights using [[multiple master|multiple masters]] in FontLab.\r\n\r\nHow
  does this generally work? I read the chapter in the FL manual and it seems that
  the best way to do it is:\r\n\r\n1) Create a regular weight\r\n2) Create \"extremes\",
  for instance, \"Ultra Thin\" and \"Ultra Black\".\r\n3) Interpolate the intermediate
  forms, like Thin, Light, Bold, Black, etc.\r\n\r\nIs this how it's generally done?
  Are most typeface families created from these three weights? Also, are the results
  acceptable if you're interpolating something across a wide range, such as an interpolation
  between a regular weight and an \"Ultra Black\" weight? Or should the extremes be
  closer together?\r\n\r\nLastly, I want at least three weights-- light, regular and
  bold. I'd imagine that in this case, MM can't help me, as I would need at least
  these three weights before I could do any interpolation anyway. The only other way
  would be using extrapolation, but I don't trust the results of that particular technique
  for my font weights."

  body: "Yes, the Thin--Regular--Ultra system works for me.\r\nExtrapolation is marginally
    useful.\r\nOther than that--experiment! You don't need a whole font, just make
    a few letters and see what happens.\r\nIf you want three weights, it makes sense
    to have Hairline and Ultra as the extremes, rather than Light and Bold, because
    you will then be able to make those anyway, and interpolation is far better than
    extrapolation. And for a sans, Hairline is quite easy--just draw a path (using
    your Regular in the mask layer as a guide) and give it a stroke value of 20."

  body: "This is a real world example:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/p_extra_5569.gif]\r\n
    \r\n \r\nThis is assuming a manually designed extralight (XL), regular (REG) and
    extrabold (XB) exist, otherwise my system cannot be applied.\r\nIf we want to
    generate a semibold (SB) we can do so by extrapolating from XL 'across' REG, as
    seen on the left. However, the horizontal bar is too heavy for this weight since
    it is (almost) proportional in both the source weights. \r\nIn the XB the bar
    is tweaked very much, which finds its way into the interpolated SB, as seen on
    the right: the horizontal is too heavy, and also the overall weight.\r\nWhat we
    want is something in between: part extrapolation and part interpolation. This
    can be achieved by adjusting the weights in our cocktail that gives the semibold.
    I typically put the three weights into an MM font (which means, unfortunately,
    that two masters are identical) and then calculate the required MM positions to
    give the desired resulting weight, and amount of extra- vs interpolation. Note
    that in the above example the fact that there is exactly 100% REG is random, it
    could be more or less than that.\r\n\r\nThis may all seem complicated and the
    improvements are not drastic. However, it amost does not cause any additional
    work \u2013 all you have to do is to combine your weights a bit differently when
    you generate the weights you do not design manually. It is my experience that
    the time you save for correcting the semibold outweighs (ha ha) the effort to
    set up the MM font.\r\n"

  body: "The LucasFont idea is this: all the formulas boil down to saying that b,
    the width of the \"medial\" stem, is the square root of the product of a by c,
    where a is the smallest and c the largest stem. This means that the width of the
    medium stem is the geometric mean of the widths of the smallest and largest stems.
    This is equivalent to saying that the logarithm of b is exactly the arithmetic
    mean of the logarithm of a and that of c. This is logarithmic interpolation and
    this looks interesting. My feeling is that Tim's interpolation uses a quadratic
    fit (whence the parabola). Am I wrong? Tim, would it make any sense to mix the
    two approaches (i.e. take a log, use a quadratic fit, and then exponentiate)?
    \r\n\r\nMichel\r\n\r\n[edit 1] Maybe the method should rather be called \"exponential
    interpolation\". I can find no reference for the moment.\r\n[edit 2] Yes, it should

  body: 'As someone pointed out in another thread, a simple way of stating Lucas''s
    idea is that the weights should be a geometric progression: the ratio of each
    term (weight) to the previous one is the same. For example, if you have three
    successively heavy weights, A,B,C, then algebraically A/B = B/C. Rearranging you
    get Lucas''s formula: AC = B^2 . In a talk I saw him give, he explained a more
    complex version that takes into account double and triple horizontal strokes,
    but I don''t remember it.'

  body: "<cite>My feeling is that Tim\u2019s interpolation uses a quadratic fit.</cite>\r\n\r\nNote
    that my diagrams are in different spaces than Lucas's. My approach does not say
    anything about the weight of the individual instances, it considers only the interpolation.
    By choosing the amounts of the three ingredients (which means two degrees of freedom)
    you can create any graph you want. All I am saying is that it should not have
    kinks. A pure interpolation with a kink is a special case in my approach.\r\n\r\n<cite>Yes,
    it should be called exponential interpolation</cite>\r\n\r\nNo, it should be called
    geometric sequence or progression (see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometric_sequence).
    This is precisely what it is, nothing more and nothing less. You can transform
    that into complicated formulas if you want, of course, but they will not say anything
    else.\r\n\r\nLucas's concept is about the individual weights \u2013 despite the
    name it does not say anything about interpolation, actually.\r\n"

    However, if the smallest stem is a, the largest is c, and if you have 5 weights
    between a and c, then according to Lucas the stem of weights k=1 to 5 is a*(c/a)**(k/6.0)
    using Python code. The explanation in terms of geometric progression is nice but
    does not give Python code.\r\n\r\n[edit] I meant according to the formula y(x)
    = y0*(y1/y0)**x; here y0 = a, y1 = c; x is k/6 where k=0 for stem a and k=6 for
    stem c and k from 1 to 5 gives those in between. "
