  body: Can't find closer than [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/agfa/amasis/|Amasis]]
    for the first one (but don't think it is...). Second looks like [[http://www.dafont.com/fr/sansumi.font|Sansumi]].

  body: "For the first one, also similar, and also not it:\r\nhttp://new.myfonts.com/fonts/daltonmaag/lexia-da-ma/\r\nOn
    the site they use Museo Slab and Museo Sans as webfonts.\r\n\r\nThat said, I think
    that, if you donate something, they will be more than happy to tell you which
    fonts they used ;-)"

  body: Thanks for your help, Ryuk & Riccard0. I think first one is custom font based
    on 'lexia-da-ma' that Riccard0 identified. Thanks! Thanks!
