body: "A feeling of excitement abounds in the world of type \u2014 and for good reason.
  Consumers have never been more conscious of type as they are now, and more and more
  people are taking graphic design into their own hands. I believe the digital type
  industry is nearing a tipping point much like the music industry did nearly a decade
  ago, which is why I created [[http://fontslice.com|FontSlice]]. In the year 2000,
  a typical music purchase was around $15.00 \u2014 the average price of a CD. That
  all changed in 2003 when Apple launched the iTunes Store. In six short years, the
  music industry nearly doubled in size, going from 800 million dollars to nearly
  1.6 <em>billion</em> dollars in sales.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/music
  sales_4589.JPG]\r\n\r\nBy significantly reducing the average transaction cost, the
  barrier to consumption was lowered, which caused the actual size of the market to
  expand. At a recent TypeCon, Roger Black suggested that the type industry might
  evolve in a similar fashion; his last slide read <strong>99 Cents</strong>, though
  few designers would place such a low value on the tremendous effort that goes into
  creating a new typeface. Amazingly, the iTunes revolution was accomplished without
  fundamentally changing the dollar value of the music itself, since the cost of a
  digital album was about the same as that of its physical equivalent. The music industry
  followed the path of least resistance; artists would continue to produce music the
  way they always had \u2014 in albums \u2014 while Apple worried about the details
  of dividing and distributing the content to consumers.\r\n\r\nFontSlice serves a
  similar purpose to the type industry. Consumers are able to purchase only the glyphs
  they need for a particular project, whether it be a few letters or an entire character
  range. This allows consumers to incrementally purchase fonts via multiple transactions,
  paying for each glyph individually according to a nonlinear pricing model; the first
  glyph might be $1.00, the second $0.95, the third $0.90, and so on. After each transaction,
  the user is able to download an abridged version of the font containing only the
  glyphs they've purchased. If the user eventually purchases every glyph in the font,
  the total amount paid will simply equal the retail price of the font. This pricing
  model encourages consumers to make repeated purchases until a font is complete,
  much like iTunes users have incentive to complete an album after purchasing several
  tracks. Using this system, type designers can continue producing fonts the way they
  always have \u2014 in standard font files \u2014 while FontSlice worries about the
  details of dividing and distributing the font to consumers.\r\n\r\nFontSlice has
  come a long way in the past few months \u2014 the patent application is filed, the
  website is developed, and the support system is in place. In fact, there's only
  one thing missing \u2014 fonts. We'd like to see every font available on FontSlice,
  and we're ready to listen to the type community to make sure that happens. Let us
  know what you think about FontSlice in the comments below. We'd love to hear your
  feedback. If you'd like to learn more about FontSlice or if you're interested in
  a distribution agreement, email me at [[mailto:david@fontslice.com|david@fontslice.com]].\r\n\r\n<strong>Let
  typographic evolution begin.</strong>"

    this <em>was</em> a massive task. It took months of careful programming to create
    the algorithm that produces abridged font files. In a nutshell, the algorithm
    analyzes each line of the original font file and determines what type of information
    it contains. The algorithm won't even consider altering the line unless it contains
    spline data, which is the only data within a font file that is absolutely necessary
    to reproduce the shape of a particular glyph. If a user has rights to a certain
    glyph, then the spline data is left untouched. If a user doesn't have rights to
    a certain glyph, then the spline data is removed. All other information (including
    kerning and OpenType data) is left untouched. As long as the user has rights to
    the necessary glyphs, all OpenType functionality will remain intact.\r\n\r\n<blockquote><strong>daverowland:</strong>

    not by purchasing glyphs to put into a font, but by purchasing a word or sentence,
    to be delivered as an EPS or suchlike. This business model is already covered

    point about display type; FontSlice will certainly be the distributor of choice
    when users are typesetting display copy, which often only comprises a few words.
    However, assuming the user is able to predict which character ranges would be
    required for a particular application, there's no reason why FontSlice wouldn't
    be used in applications involving larger amounts of text. The abridged fonts produced
    by the FontSlice algorithm are identical in every way to the original file, save
    the missing spline data for unlicensed glyphs. Like any font file, they can be
    installed on your operating system and used in any software application; there's
    no need for EPS files."

    the graphics world, we frequently have just a few minutes to make client changes
    and provide new proofs. So if we have a headline which the client has changed
    the wording on but we don't have the necessary glyph(s) to make the change, do
    you intend to offer virtually instantaneous service to enable us to provide the
    same level of service our customers are used to?\r\n\r\nSometimes the client is
    sitting in the office waiting on the changed proof because the timing is so critical
    to them. No one wants to tell a client they will have to wait; it's not good for
    business.\r\n\r\nGiven just this one issue, I don't believe I would take advantage
    of this service. I would continue to buy the complete font or family.\r\n\r\nOverall
    I'm not sure this is a good idea; it's not tunes one is buying for personal use,
    it's a necessary product for businesses to provide their service with.\r\n"

    connection, it should only take about 15 seconds to find and download an upgraded
    version of an abridged font. When you enter the new headline, FontSlice will automatically
    determine which glyphs you've already purchased and which glyphs you haven't.
    The system will also allow you to maintain an account balance, so you won't have
    to pull out your credit card every time you purchase or upgrade an abridged font.
    When you install the upgraded version, it will immediately overwrite the previous
    version and you'll be ready to go."

      Thomas. In our testing, we've never run into a problem with font caching. We've
      mostly tested Adobe and Microsoft applications on Mac and Windows platforms,
      though. It seems that a few people are concerned about this issue, so we will
      definitely be doing more thorough testing before we launch. Thanks for the insight!"
