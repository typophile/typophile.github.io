body: "This is a followup to an earlier post about selecting type for a city in Armenia
  that I am doing a logo/branding for.  The logo will be on a map, brochures, web
  site and signage.  It will also end up as the logo for the information center (with
  information center added).  Target audience is primarily tourists, and the brochure
  will be in English/French/Armenian.  \r\n\r\nBiggest challenge for me is that I
  don't know Armenian at all, and am just working with letterforms.  I originally
  did it in lower case, but that was rejected as apparently towns are written in all
  caps for ease of readability (see old version for a clear example of why!).\r\n\r\nThis
  version is Trajan Pro, small caps with larger capital.  The Armenian letters are
  modified to fit in with Trajan from another face.  The graphic is an iconic mountain
  of the area with a sun, all in the colors of the Armenian flag.  The lettering is
  in green to help evoke an impression of naturalness (they have more trees than most
  of Armenia apparently).\r\n\r\nAny and all comments welcome![img:sites/default/files/old-images/stepanavan_5759.png]\r\n\r\nThe
  old version for reference[img:sites/default/files/old-images/stepanavan_old_3608.png]"

  body: "Definitely an improvement, but I think there's still room to do better.\r\n\r\nAVA
    is kerned too tight. Even AN could probably be loosened a bit (and should certainly
    be more consistent with NA spacing).\r\n\r\nI don't know Armenian letterforms
    well enough to comment expertly either, but there are a few things that bother
    me. For one, the cap U (s sound) has a very different weight distribution than
    the small-cap u-with tail (a sound). There are other color issues. For example,
    the last letter (n sound) is light, and the phi-letter (p sound) is dark.\r\n\r\nThe
    thin black rule between the two language versions doesn't give me a warm, fuzzy
    feeling either. Since you now have a graphic, maybe you could integrate that in
    so that it separates the two text slugs."

  body: "Thanks for the comments.  Interesting that you point out that the 'U' and
    lower case u with tail are of odd weight, because they are based on Trajan (just
    added the tail to the small cap version)...\r\n\r\nI'm not in love with the horizontal
    rule either...  Not too sure what to do there yet."
