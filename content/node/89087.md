  featured the ability to automatically\r\ngenerated optically-scaled designed based
  on one master\r\ndesign (that had some special information embedded,\r\nsomewhat
  like hinting) and that: \"Considering that the\r\ntechnology worked on the basis
  of single master fonts,\r\nthe results are of remarkable quality, which, under the\r\naspect
  of optical scaling, is still unmatched today.\"\r\n\r\nI had only head of this Ikarus
  feature once or twice,\r\nand never in these glowing terms. Could anybody\r\nelaborate,
  and -if it's that good- possibly explain\r\nwhy it hasn't been reimplemented?\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
