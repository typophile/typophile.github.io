  body: "Many of them (like some of these) are heritage typefaces. So they exist or
    have existed since before digital type design and have a lineage of sensible progression
    and considered execution.  (exclude Zara \u2014 strange choice of source material\u2014definitely
    not luxury?!). \r\n\r\nMaybe for you to really plumb the depths or incite some
    interesting research, you could look at Chanel, Loewe, Dior [Lanvin is good]).
    I have worked within high-end luxury fashion \u2014  specifically logo mark development,
    and I would say that your best bet would be to look at original heritage logotypes,
    as they will have a more interesting and documented history.\r\n"

  body: "Hey Alphapeta,\r\nThanks for the advice, but I am interested in these particular
    letterforms. Zara and Balmian were redone within the last couple years. I am interested
    in the new versions\u2014not the heritage versions."
