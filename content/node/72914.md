  body: "So much depends on the name.\r\nSome names look harsh, merely through the
    accident of letter forms (or through being short), while others are naturally
    soft -- and there is also the sound and meaning of the name to consider -- you
    may want to counteract or enhance these qualities, at the least they should be
    negotiated. Get designing, for goodness sake!\r\n\r\nClearface (U&lc) is very
    friendly, IMO, and compact, which is useful for making the name big in signage.
    \r\nChoice of serif or sans."

    was hip: I merely stated what it was perceived to convey by a non-type professional.
    And I would agree with the other Nick on Clearface..."

    the competition is using, to avoid a too-similar look.

    Cooper might stand out quite well. Personally, I like Cooper. I don't get the
    chance to use it very often anymore."

    in Europe. I even ended up using it recently in a magazine advert.
