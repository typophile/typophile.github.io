body: We launched Spaces magazine last July on a wing &amp; a prayer and very little
  knowledge of typography. We&#39;re at the stage now where we really need to focus
  on getting the design &amp; typography to work together to give the mag a clearer
  identity. It&#39;s a contemporary interiors and design mag, with a slightly quirky
  streak, for people who are passionate about their homes. <BR> <BR>We currently use
  Adrenalin for the title, FF DIN Light for text, DIN Regular, Medium &amp; Bold for
  captions etc, and OcrA for subheads and quotes. Helvetica neue and American Typewriter
  for heads. <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/41042.jpg"
  alt="spaces-pages"> <BR> <BR>I don&#39;t know much about typography, but I&#39;m
  not 100% convinced by the combination &amp; I&#39;m desperately looking for some
  advice on alternatives - any ideas?

  body: Well, I did say we had a quirky side! <BR> <BR>Our designer chose the basic
    fonts when we started and American Typewriter got adopted recently almost by accident
    when I said I liked Vogue&#39;s new look. You think I should have kept quiet?

  body: 'i was just giving you a hard time before. i think everyone who could best
    answer your questions is away at Typecon this week... so you might hafta wait
    a while until they can get back from San Fran. <BR>What is it about your current
    shemata that isn&#39;t working for you? what kind of look are you wanting to zero
    in on better? Everything depends on how YOU want your magazine to look and without
    more information about what you want, i dunno if anyone here can properly guide
    you where you want to go. So far I&#39;ve got contemporary and quirky... anything
    else someone making suggestions should know about? <BR> <BR>One thing I would
    change is that I wouldn&#39;t use a san serif for long blocks of text, ie articles. '

  body: It looks to me like you did hire a designer. <BR>Other than &#34;...not 100%
    convinced by the combination,&#34; what do you specifically object to?  The type
    is too small to see very well so I can&#39;t comment on the interaction of fonts.
    <BR>Personally, I rather like what I can see of it.  It is modern and eccentric
    &#40;much like my own tastes&#41;.  <BR>For me, it is not so important what you
    or I think but what your target audience thinks.  Why don&#39;t you do a letter
    from the editor asking your subscribers what they think of the design of your
    publication? Don&#39;t ask them about type faces or try to skew their thinking,
    just ask them to comment on the design.  If most comments hate your type, that
    is one story.  My guess is most won&#39;t even mention type face combinations.  Remember,
    it is not your magazine, it is your subscribers&#39;. <BR> <BR>IMHO, leave it
    as it is for at least a couple of years. It is hard enough to create an identity
    without changing it every few months.  If you do change it, have a good reason.  A
    good reason is NOT, &#34;I am not sure about this anymore.&#34; <BR> <BR>ChrisL

  body: Since we are taking type here, I would suggest focusing on adapting font families
    that are extensive with wide range in weights, sans and serif versions as well
    as multiple numeral systems and ligatures. If you find your competitors use similar
    choices I would suggest not using the same. A custom face would be ideal but perhaps
    funding and time constraints does not allow for such. <BR>

  body: I think the layout looks nice and clean and appropriate to its subject matter.
    I like the small gutters between images &#40;reminds me a little of <a href="http://www.selfservicemagazine.com"
    target="_blank">Self Service</a>&#41;. <BR> <BR>The type that&#39;s been chosen
    is a little over-familiar -- you might want to think about, for each typeface,
    choosing something similar but less common; similar enough to keep the feel &#40;I
    agree with Chris L about not messing too much with the overall ID right at the
    start&#41; but different enough to make it your own. <BR> <BR>I&#39;m sure you
    could find good alternates by poking about the board a little -- I&#39;m on my
    first coffee and have to go to work in 5 mins so can&#39;t think right now. <BR>

  body: 'OK - here are my concerns: <BR> <BR>DIN for body copy looks a bit &#39;lightweight&#39;
    to me &amp; is not easy to read. We&#39;ve played with serifs but they change
    the feel too much. <BR> <BR>Helvetica neue - we started using Thin Extended for
    a couple of big headlines etc. but I&#39;d really like to see something which
    is less cliched before we get stuck on using it regularly. We&#39;d also use for
    big coverlines. <BR> <BR>American Typewriter - as I said, we started using rather
    thoughtlessly. Should we be checking out some other typewriter fonts? <BR> <BR>I&#39;d
    really like to choose a serif display font for some heads &amp; subheads to add
    a little &#39;colour&#39; where appropriate. <BR> <BR>OCRA is a bit painful at
    times, but I like it! The mag is contemporary but not particularly aloof - we
    like a touch of trashy too! <BR> <BR>Most of the feedback we get suggests that
    we are seen as standing out from the crowd &#40;Elle Decoration &amp; LivingEtc&#41;.
    Because the mag content is percieved as being innovative, I think it&#39;s very
    important to gently refine/evolve the design &amp; typography to keep our readers
    hooked.'

    <BR>They say sans are more legible, while serifed faces are more readable. This
    is why most reading material you see is in a serifed font with sans headings.
    <BR>They say one&#39;s eyes tire after reading a large block of text in a san
    serif face, and I&#39;d have to agree. <BR>These are two reasons i suggested switching
    to a serifed face. <BR>A third reason is more personal, i guess: if i were to
    pick up a magazine and see all the articles were in a sans face, i would get the
    impression that the articles were more for filler than the actual meat of the
    publication. i&#39;d view such text as big captions for the pictures... but that&#39;s
    just me. '

  body: There isn&#39;t that much text to tire from in your layouts.  Sans is more
    befitting your audience.   <BR>If FF Din light is too light, use medium.  Also
    look at Info, Klievit, Signa, or Dax. <BR> <BR>ChrisL

    earlier in the post there should be a matching serif version to really put it
