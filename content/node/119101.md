  is a number badge/plate for a old GMAM Garratt steam train from South Africa. I
  need to replace the numbers on the badge with another Garratt's number. Any ideas
  what the font might be - just for the numbers really.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance!"

  body: Good call, Fivos! <strong>FF Good</strong> family is large with 6 width variations
    (from Compressed to Extended). You could cover the complete sign with one single
    family. The only small adjustment you'd need would probably to remove spur on
    /G.
