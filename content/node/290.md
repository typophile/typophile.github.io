  On The Veranda"> <BR> <BR>I had the idea of an overweighted typeface, where the
  lower part were thinner than the higher part of the letters. Give me some feedback
  about it. i&#39;ve still got some special letters left to buid at least.

    the monostroke version, but try doing this different stroke weight distribution.
    <BR>And, BTW, what&#39;s that under 5? Looks like a half-smiley... :- &#41; <BR>'
