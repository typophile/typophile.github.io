    really is enough.

  body: "\"Service\" is not a product, the forum postings and similarly utilities
    you have at your  apartments, homes and offices etc are also a \"Service.\" Thus
    if I have used another \"room\" at the forums for posting a message that some
    users use frequently and perhaps they are not using all the rooms, then I am also
    posting a message for them. \r\n\r\nThe posting message is relevant for those
    \"rooms\" where I posted because you could have font designer using a sub-forum
    at \"Critique\" forum using font software and interested in pro bono work.  There
    is not any \"room\" on this forum for hiring a designer and thus the posting was
    at the most frequented \"rooms\" where there were more messages.  Some messages
    posted get a nil response and even at a \"room\" where based on the forum name
    you expect responses.  Those postings thus should not have been deleted by the
    moderators based on the postings as a \"Service\" point.\r\n\r\nHow can anyone
    post the idea that a non-profit project / pro bono project is either (i) illegal
    (ii) illegal if new and not yet incorporated as an organisation (iii) illegal
    if abroad (iv) illegal if an organisation abroad and has different incorporation
    method not same as the system you have in the United States? (v) illegal if it
    is said that a project is a non-profit project / pro bono project? \r\n\r\n<strong>Responding

    everybody does, you know. But 501(c)3 status is a specifically American thing.
    Many of the non-profit organizations in the world don't have that status, because
    they are based outside the USA.\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\nT"
