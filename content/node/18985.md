  the website, it was a great pleasure to even learn its existence some time ago,
  not to mention the precious info/feedback one can come across over here. \r\n\r\nTo
  the point; Morpheus is a font that was originally designed some ten years ago by
  Eric Oehler. It was published on the net as shareware and I've liked it from the
  beginning. I'm currently designing (with the agreement of the original creator)
  a Greek version. I've prepared a little preview image file to show for demonstration
  of the Greek character set. I haven't included the latin character set on the image
  file, this can be checked out by downloading the original font from http://www.dafont.com/morpheus.font
  \r\n\r\nI would be gratefully welcoming your critique/comments/ideas regarding either
  the aesthetics or the readability of the font. \r\n\r\nhttp://utopia.duth.gr/~vkarageo/morpheus-new.jpg"

    \r\nIt seems to me that your Greek work better than Mason Greek. However, I find
    it extremely difficult to make a font like this to work well in Greek. May be
    the lack of history that annoys the eye, or I miss the conceptual link. Like making
    a Greek Gothic font. But to be honest, I m not a big fan of mason Greek either.
    Call it personal taste.\r\nI don't want to sound discouraging at all though. By
    all means, keep on going. All the experiments are very useful; we may go through
    hardship and development to find ways to express new typographic qualities. Especially
    with our difficult (but interesting) alphabet.\r\n"

  body: "Dear Spyros (i'm gonna write english like you did, simply politeness :))
    thank you for your nice words. The truth is that i can obviously see your and
    Tiffany's point: it does resemble the general aisthetics of the pre-existing Mason.
    However, this font exists for like 10 years? and in the last 8 years that i know
    it i haven't come across any legal issues regarding it. If anyone has any knowledge
    i might, unwillingly, ignore would be welcomed to inform me. \r\n\r\nI'm definitely
    not an experienced typeface designer (it's only my third attempt and the first
    to be \"accomplished\" to such an extent), and i've not checked the character
    set of the greek mason version, i'm gonna do so though, in the first chance. \r\n\r\nAs
    about the \"gothic greek\", yeah you're perfectly right about that, it doesn't
    look such a natural combination. However i can think of a couple of potential
    uses of such a font in the greek language: (RPG, dark/epic/historical logos/titles
    etc. I've actually already had a couple of emails with people that showed some
    interest in using it, i hope i'll soon have the chance to look at what they did).
    \r\n\r\nLast but not least, Spyros it's been a pleasure to come across you: i
    had the chance to check your page and your typefaces. I really liked starbeat
    ;) "
