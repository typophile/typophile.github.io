body: This is a logo and magazine masthead for an organization I work for. It was
  created a long time ago and the organization no longer has contact with the creator.
  It's possible it is lettering, but the rough edges seem computerized which makes
  me wonder if it is a font. However, I have tried Identifont and WhatTheFont with
  no luck.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Screen-Shot-2014-03-04-at-10_6289.08.07-AM.jpg]
