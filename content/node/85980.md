body: "I was recently asked for advice about book design by a university student.
  He was asked to design a book about language (specifically about english words that
  have originated from the arabic language), the writing style is personal(lots of
  stories about the authors childhood and family), casual, quite humorous and very
  readable.\r\n\r\nNow I am not the most experienced designer so I wasn't much help
  to him. \r\n\r\nHis typography skills were exceptional. he set the text in Arnhem
  (only,, & cant remember seeing more than one pt size for everything), flush left,
  ragged right, folios and header wer aligned left with the text. the layout and quality
  looked like something that could have been done by Hyphen Press (he did have a copy
  of ''what is a designer'' by norman potter on his shelf and may have tried to copy
  that style). But it just seemed wrong for the specific book he was designing. it
  seemed weird to read those words in such a serious layout.\r\n\r\nI didn't really
  know what to tell him, the book was beautifully designed and basically did its job
  very well ... it just felt wrong to me, in the same way drinking beer from a wine
  glass seems wrong.\r\n\r\nany opinions?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    Matters of taste cannot be disputed.\r\n\r\nSome would argue that ragged right
    is, indeed, casual; it is justified text which has no sense of humor. And what
    is \"humor'? Slapstick? Self-deprecation? Sarcasm? Irony? Are the intended readers
    so dense that, unless the style is obviously humorous, they will have no idea
    at all that the content is meant to be?\r\n\r\nIn other words: don't overthink
    it, dude. If it looks good as it stands, then go with it. Or, simply change the
    font to Comic Sans: even people whose sole intellectual achievement is typing
    LOL in some social media space will get it, Oh: this is supposed to be funny!
    Umm. Wait a minute: where are the cat videos?\r\n\r\nOkay: maybe they<strong>
    won't</strong> get it. But you get it, don't you?"

  body: "I agree with oldnick; I don't think a humor book needs to scream \"funny\"
    to its readers via typography. But if your friend's book was looking too business-like,
    perhaps a more casual or quirky headline font might help. You could also make
    use of photos, illustrations, pulled quotes, etc.\r\n\r\nYou might want to check
    out the humor section at your bookstore for examples. For example, here's a page
    from a best-selling humor book by Steve Martin.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/steve-martin_4320.jpg]"

  body: Unless the chapters are so short it would become intrusive and gimmicky, perhaps
    give some thought to opening each chapter with an Arabic drop cap?
