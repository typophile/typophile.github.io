  a font?\r\nShould unicase fonts include accented characters?"

  body: "Hi Nick,\r\nplease define (your) [[unicase]]. Really just one form (\u2018uniformed\u2019)
    of each character?\r\nWhat has unicase to do with reducing the character count?
    In a \u2018normal\u2019 font, you\u2019d have both \xC4 and \xE4, both \xC0 and
    \xE0. Why would you want to drop the accents when unifying these two cases?\r\n\r\nI\u2019ve
    been told that it once was okay to omit the accents on capitalized French text.
    But that had technical reasons (the typewriter?) and shouldn\u2019t be done anymore.
    Maybe a Frenchman/-woman can enlighten us \u2026"

  body: "I'm thinking <a href=\"http://www.pbtweb.com/alpha26/index.html\">Alphabet
    26</a> unicase, which seems to be something of a norm. (Caps, with lower case
    a, e, m, and n--we'll get into Greek and Cyrillic later...)\r\n\r\nUnicase reduces
    the characters in a font.\r\nThe Alphabet 26 model also reduces the form of the
    typeface to a single height, by removing extenders.\r\nContinuing with this paring
    down, the next step is to remove accents, which upset the clean line.\r\nThe Greek
    all cap setting is generally done without accents.\r\n\r\nPerhaps linguistic practice
    can be organized into categories:\r\n\r\n1. Languages without accents--English,
    Dutch/Afrikaans, Welsh, Uzbek, Filipino, Indonesian, Javanese, Malay, Hausa, Malagasay,
    Oromiffa, Zulu, etc. (Did I get that right?!)\r\n\r\n2. Languages with lowercase
    and titlecase accents, where it's the norm to do without accents on all cap settings.\r\n\r\n3.
    Languages with lowercase and titlecase accents, where it's acceptable to omit
    accents on all cap settings in certain circumstances such as display typography--for
    which unicase is generally intended.\r\n\r\n4. Languages where accents are indispensible
    in all settings.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Okay, I see.\r\nAs your aim is to avoid anything that upsets the clean line,
    I assume German umlauts count here as \u2018accents\u2019 too.\r\nHaving no umlauts
    would make such a font unusable in German language (I can only speak for that
    one), even in display typography only \u2013\_thus group 4. Why that?\r\nThere
    are a lot of words that \u2013\_sometimes completely \u2013 change their meaning
    without the dots. Here just a few:\r\n<ul><li>absp\xFClen [to do the dishes] \u2014
    abspulen [to wind (off)]</li>\r\n<li>\xE4chten [to proscribe; outlaw] \u2014 achten
    [to respect; esteem]</li>\r\n<li>dr\xFCcken [to press] \u2014 drucken [to print]</li>\r\n<li>f\xF6rdern
    [to promote, further] \u2014 fordern [to demand]</li>\r\n<li>H\xE4ndel [quarrel]
    \u2014 Handel [trade]</li>\r\n<li>sp\xFCren [to feel; sense] \u2014 spuren [to
    obey]</li>\r\n<li>st\xFCtzen [to support] \u2014 stutzen [to hesitate; trim]</li>\r\n<li>t\xE4uschen
    [to deceive] \u2014 tauschen [to change; swap]</li>\r\n<li>z\xE4hlen [to count]
    \u2014 zahlen [to pay]</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\nRight, one can substitute any umlaut
    by <em>vowel</em>+e \u2013 but only in obsolescent e-mail \u2018typography\u2019.
    If you want to broaden your language support, you could try to integrate the dots.
    Could be an interesting challenge. URW once did ultrabold display versions of
    a couple of classics, like Gill Sans, Antique Olive and Broadway.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/accent-integration_6506.png]\r\nOh
    yes, there is room for improvement. ;\xB0)\r\nF "

  body: "In general, my philosophy is, would a user reasonably expect these things
    to work, or at least be happily pleased if they do? If so, it should be in the
    typeface.\r\n\r\nSo for my part, when I did unicase alternate small caps for Hypatia
    Sans, I included every accented variant available with the regular letters. So
    for example the typeface supports unicase Vietnamese.\r\n\r\nThe unicase alternates
    also interact with some of the stylistic sets, so for example the alternate \"e\"
    with the slanted crossbar has a unicase version, as does the simpler form of the
    \"a.\" Both of those need to get all their accented versions, too.\r\n\r\nI did
    however draw the line at polytonic Greek unicase. The Greek unicase is only monotonic.
    \ :)\r\n\r\nThis sort of stuff is a good example of how glyph counts can rapidly
    spiral out of hand, mind you. Although I think adding these kinds of extras is
    \"good\" or makes a \"better\" typeface, I can totally sympathize with people
    who choose to draw the line some time earlier.\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\nT"

  body: "If you make a face with lower case x-height and small caps the same height
    and same weight, you don't need to create any new glyphs, just make a couple of
    new OT classes that recombine lc and sc.\r\n\r\nAn easier way might be to write
    a unic feature that:\r\n1. Repeats the c2sc lookup\r\n2. Repeats the smcp lookup\r\n(Those
    two turn any keyed character into a small cap)\r\n3. Substitutes lower case a,
    e, m and n, along with their accented versions\r\n\r\nIMO, small caps should be
    substantially larger than lower-case x-height for text work, but that isn't a
    priority for display--which is where unicase is more likely to be used anyway.\r\n\r\n**\r\n\r\nThomas,
    how is the Hypatia Greek unicase appointed? Please show!\r\n\r\n"
