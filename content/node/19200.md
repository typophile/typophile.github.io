body: "Help!\r\n\r\nI have (at least) a couple of issues I need help with, regarding
  the use of Chinese fonts, and Adobe software.\r\n\r\n1. I am having a hell of a
  time simply getting Chinese fonts to display in both/either Traditional and simplified,
  and once I get them, keeping them displayed.\r\n\r\n2. While I am typesetting these
  fonts in Illustrator, My Mac eventually wants to stop letting me use keyboard shortcuts
  - in any Adobe software that Ii have running at the time. I can't get the use of
  them back until I quit and re-start the software, assuming I'm not re-opening a
  file with that particular Chinese font in it.\r\n\r\nAny help is greatly appreciated.\r\n\r\n-Breck\r\n\r\np.s.
  for the record, I don't speak or read the language."

    using.\r\n\r\nAre you sure the version you're using supports Chinese typesetting?\r\nFor
    example, there's a special InDesign version for Japanese."

  body: "It would be helpful to know also which fonts are you using \u2013 font files,
    not typeface design \u2013 because the problem could be the compatibility with
    the application.\r\nThere's also a different encoding problem. Traditional Chinese
    is mainly using a BIG5 encoding while simplified characters use the GB2312, but
    there are some font sets available in GB2312 that include also traditional character.
    Using those might be simpler because you can switch between the two just selecting
    a different font.\r\n\r\nInDesign is more problematic because it works very well
    only with few fonts otherwise you need a plug-in (InChinese \u2013 http://www.inchinese.com/eng/index.html)
    and there still problems in pre-press. Keep in mind that most of mainland China
    still stuck on OS9 and Pagemaker 6.5 Chinese version."

  body: "Right. That would help I guess.\r\n\r\nI am using Adobe Illustrator CS2;
    OSX version 10.4.6\r\n\r\nI am using two versions of the same font, called \"AR
    GuyinGB Bold\" and \"AR GuYinB5 Bold\" - One of course is the simplified version,
    the other is the traditional. They are made by Arphic, I believe.\r\n\r\nI need
    to do two versions of the same text, one in each (traditional and Simplified...)\r\n\r\nIt
    seems like I have to switch my blocks of text to the other. It comes up with question
    marks (?), and then I need to convert it to simplified, or traditional - depending
    on what it was to begin with, using the \"Convert to\" option under my language
    input setting (flag at the top of your Mac screen), BUT... it seems like I can
    only switch, say, from traditional to simplified, if my input language is set
    to Pinyin, but can only switch TO Traditional FROM Simplified if my imput language
    setting is set to ITABC.\r\n\r\nI think this solves my problem, or at least has
    worked for the last day or so, but I still don't understand WHY this is. If any
    of you can clarify, I would be very grateful.\r\n\r\n-b"

  body: "It looks like the problem is the different encoding, being the traditional
    a BIG5 and the simplified a GB. I don't really know the technical process of Illustrator
    conversion, I'll try to find out but tech question in this country can lead to
    amusing answers.\r\n\r\nA possible solution could be to use Agfa Monotype fonts
    \u2013 when Agfa got the Hong Kong Monotype inherited the whole type design team,
    unfortunately they're more concentrated on custom lettering than complete set
    \u2013 their GB collection includes also traditional characters and the price
    for the whole thing was around $250 when I got it few years ago."

  body: "Interesting. Thanks.\r\n\r\nActually, part of the problem is also that I've
    found a specific, stylized font that best suits the job, and marries well stylistically
    and historically with the latin alphabet I have chosen. The job is setting film
    title credits, the key being that they have to be both in Chinese AND english.\r\n\r\nSo,
    basically, I'm trying to make a \"less-than-ideally-functional\" font function,
    for the sake of the style that we found, and sold the client on. It looks great.
    Hopefully I can make it work. It looks like we may have to create a few select
    characters from scratch. No big deal. I just have learn some Chinese.\r\n\r\nAttached
    are the Arphic samples and a sample of how I'm marrying the two languages. Let
    me know what you think.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/credits_font.png]"

    work you're doing. Matching roman characters with asian ideograms is always a
    challenge, especially when it comes to Chinese since compared to what we're used
    for western language, there's an absolute lack of type design (I know I often
    cry about this, but it can be really frustrating).\r\nAnd if to be uselessly picky
    historically the two design are separated by at least a thousand years, for sure
    there's a interesting link since the Chinese design you're using seems to recall
    the old bone scripts, used to cast oracles and write prophecies..."

  body: "Thanks for the crit. Historical accuracy is tough business for sure. The
    story takes place in Tenth century China, so the trick was to find a balance,
    keeping a general primitive, archaic feel. I designed a custom-lettered wordmark
    first, the selection of the english font followed, and then came the selection
    of the Chinese.\r\n\r\nThere is certainly an obvious lack of selection for Chinese
    design. Anyone care to rectify this? What's a few thousand characters compared
    to 26?\r\n\r\n-b"

  body: "It's tough. Even to chinese speaker, chinese character seems to have a lot
    of repeating elements. But when implementing into a font, they all display small
    differences. And it's hard to go over thousands of glyph and audit it one by one,
    leave alone hint them. It seems all chinese/kanji fonts are concentrated only
    on variations of a few existing styles. And those style to me, dont do justice
    to a language belongs to the inventor of the printing press. I guess they just
    lack the willingness to venture to new styles.\r\nP.S. The font you have chosen
    is a typeface originated in Japan."

    AD to 11th Century AD. It's a script design to emulate the ancient Chinese seal

    was designed to emulate ancient Chinese seal script. AND more convinced it was
    a decent choice for the job.\r\n\r\nOn another note, can anyone point me towards
    any reference on the web for typesetting Chinese characters? (preferebly in english.)
    Any advice on suitable ways to marry english with Chinese, in different situations
    would also be helpful. For instance, ways to handle small grouped settings, as
    I have above, compared to large blocks of text. I may be faced with creating an
    end credit scroll for this movie, where both english and Chinese need to be seen
    simultaneously. (Potentially a big challenge, with hundreds of names...)"
