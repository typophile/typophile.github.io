  have become overwhelmed by browsing the web ...\r\n\r\nI'm a student and currently
  redesigning a medical magazine run by a non-profit student organization.\r\n\r\nI'm
  looking for a sans serif for headings (it will also appear on posters) and a serif
  for long texts (2 columns). \r\nKeywords: economical, legible, modern\r\n\r\nI like
  Garamond Premier Pro and Minion Pro because they are very economical and legible
  but I have problem with paring them with a nice sans serif. I really don't like
  how humanist Gills Sans or Syntax look as headings. They have great amount of glyphs
  (which is also important to me) and they are a classic option but maybe I prefer
  something more fresh and modern. I really like FF Tisa but again I have the same
  problem as I don't know what goes well together with it.\r\n\r\nI really like Klavika
  for the headings and I think it would look great on posters. I have read it matches
  well with Adelle, The Serif and Unit Slab Pro. I think this is a more modern option
  but I'm concerned its not appropriate for long text - or is it? I like DIN Next
  Pro too but I think its more for way finding?\r\n\r\nI'm totally confused ... Please,
  help me find my pairing :) I'm also open to something totally different from fonts
  stated above.\r\n\r\nThank you for your answers!"

    musn\u2019t appear that one is condensed or extended relative to the other.\r\nNext,
    focus on a typical setting, to get the x-height right.\r\nUsually, Bold sans subhead
    with same size Regular serif body text.\r\n(So the sans x-height might be quite
    large.)\r\nOnce you get those proportions matched, you can be sure the layout
    will be functional, so trust your judgement and taste the rest of the way."
