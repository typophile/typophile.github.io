body: "Hello, this is the second typeface I've designed so far (I'm a graphic design
  student). I set out to create a contemporary grotesk. Initially I added much more
  characteristics, like angled strokes (as in the lowercase e), etc. I've kept the
  extreme x-height. But now I've stripped it down, added more contrast and so on.
  It is not based on any specific typeface, except on personal preferences.\r\n\r\nI
  would like some overall feedback, and especially on:\r\n<ul><li>Is it original?
  If you don't think so, please point me to similar types...</li><li>Legibility</li><li>Contrast
  & harmony</li><li>Numerals & punctuation</li><li>Style</li><li>I find a, e, s, g
  the most difficult, what do you think about those?</li></ul>\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Kyniker-Bold_4532.jpg]\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\n/Marius"

    canvas\" \u2014 it almost feels like these are pushed and pulled and prodded vector
    characters from a very common existing typeface..."

    or just any common existing typeface?"

  body: "I like it. And I think it has charakter enough that it doesn\u2019t need
    the \u201Cadded\u201D charakteristics. The angled strokes are rather distracting
    for my taste, especially on the \u2018G\u2019. I don\u2019t like the \u2018K\u2019
    and the \u2018T\u2019 is too narrow. The horizontal stroke on the \u2018t\u2019
    looks like it needs to lean more to the right."
