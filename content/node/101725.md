  and poster variants?

  body: "It depends how authentic you want to be.\r\n\r\nMore importantly, I think
    you need a fresh idea \uFB01rst.\r\nWhen ITC Bodoni was created, the ideas were
    optical scaling and facsimile, not cleaning up.\r\nRecently, Karloff adresses
    \u201CBodoni\u201D and Italian as Jekyll and Hyde.\r\nWhen I did Bodoni Egyptian,
    that was steampunk.\r\nYo is arguably the last word in \u201CBodoni\u201D horizontal
    proportioning.\r\n\r\nWhat\u2019s your idea?"

  body: "Well, a nice Bodoni Book would be welcome. Here's how you start: don't look
    at any drawings. Instead, go find some books printed letterpress, set in 10 to
    12 point, that you think good. You know, where the lower-case \"o\" isn't just
    a pair of tiny parentheses with a maybe mistaken hairline joining them?\r\n\r\nNow,
    make it look like that, at least in terms of stroke contrast, when printed offset
    on uncoated stock (try Glatfelter's Natures Natural), where the plate was made
    directly from the typesetting file.\r\n\r\nIn fact, a very useful Bodoni Book
    project would be a roman and italic, one for coated papers, one for uncoated.
    The stroke contrast is just that important with Bodoni. Far as I'm concerned,
    they could share a semibold, if you feel that necessary.\r\n\r\nOtherwise, I'm
    with HVB -- the 40 or 50 Bodoni's we already have are good enough, condensed or
    otherwise.\r\n\r\n"

    original idea. I don\u2019t mean to be harsh by saying \u201CWhat\u2019s your
    idea?\u201D\u2014it may be that by just doodling and drawing something good will
    emerge. Looking at the didone in Karloff, it\u2019s very nicely and quietly drawn,
    quite apart from its relationship with its ugly twin."

  body: "With regard to Charles' Bodoni Book idea, I've also thought that this would
    be a useful thing to have. I admire ITC Bodoni as a kind of archaeological exercise,
    but think it captures too much of the artefacts of a particular technology (printing
    from metal types). I'd like to see similar attention to the weights and proportions
    of Bodoni's original types but translated into cleaner forms representative of
    and suited to today's technologies.\r\n\r\nAs Charles says, the hairline contrast
    in Bodoni really recommends differing fonts for different output/paper conditions,
    or something like 'grades' as used in newspaper typography."

  body: "Nick, Mary Mendell (now retired & making rather nice etchings) & I tried
    to get Berthold Bodoni (Antiqua) to work for a number of projects. It was always
    \"not quite\" -- the contrast is not correct for the way these books are printed.
    (2400 dpi / direct to plate / offset press)\r\n\r\n[Shameless plug for Mary] http://mmartwork.squarespace.com/galleries
    \r\n\r\nI actually made up a Bodoni Book starting from a Linotype roman & Monotype
    italic digital version (yes Hrant, all purchased under the old, old Adobe license).
    It was useful, and a couple of those books did wind up in book shows, but I never
    felt it was really any good. A case of \"Well, that's better than anything we
    have\" rather than \"That's good.\" \r\n\r\nAnd that's not good. It would be tough,
    but do-able, I think. Question is whether or not there would be a market. As a
    typesetter who sells services, I figured designers would just use something else,
    which is why I never took it any farther."

    The \"fresh idea\" that Nick speaks of is the only thing that can make it the
    former (hence much more marketable) but it necessarily makes it not the latter.\r\n\r\nBTW
    Charles, I've never doubted your ethics.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    this kind of project.\r\nhrant, the contemporary aspect was geared towards what
    charles is saying about modern printing methods. I think you can be authentic
    to the original concept of Bodoni's contrast while being contemporary with the
    technology we have today."

    talking about with the numerals in looking at ITC Bodoni 72, the 5 and 7 horizontal
    strokes are thick while the verticals are thin, which logically I think is backwards.
    Is this what you mean? \r\nthank you, these are perfect elements to include.\r\n\r\nj."

    face in a somewhat bold version.\r\nThe \u201CBook\u201D version was a reaction
    to that.\r\nIf so many people were satis\uFB01ed with that bold body text look,
    it must have had some merit worth investigating and understanding from our present
    day perspective."

  body: "One thing that's been rolling around in my head for a while now is that the
    non-alphabetics of Didone fonts often don't work well. This might be because people
    have had trouble properly detaching them from chirography (the virtual \"painting\"
    of letterforms via the hand using an imaginary marking tool). For example look
    at the circumflex -and the discussion surrounding it- here: http://www.flickr.com/photos/martinmajoor/8224390209/\r\n\r\nMore
    significantly, numerals in Didone fonts often don't follow the logic (with Didones
    being essentially about logic, even if, yes, you can still write them with certain
    marking tools manipulated a certain way) of the alphabetics. And I personally
    think straight quote marks work better than \"correct\" curly ones in such designs.\r\n\r\nSo
    maybe your design can stand out by treating the non-alphabetics in a newer (specifically
    more ideologically robust) way. That would be contemporary. Or at least not archaic.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "Jason, that thin-thick circumflex could indeed be seen as beautiful of its
    own, but my contention is actually that it doesn't fit the Didone ideology. One
    that's symmetrical, with a thick join and thinning ends (or maybe even the other
    way around) makes more sense to me.\r\n\r\nConcerning the numerals: they have
    \"funny\" contrast because they come from Eastern writing systems. On some level
    making them feel different than the alphabetics can make sense, but -again- in
    a Didone that doesn't click for me. I would prefer to see \"rationalist\" numerals
    where the stroke thickness matches that of the alphabetics. There are surprisingly
    few people who do this: Catich, Harvey, Bouwsma... and yours truly. :-)  BTW see
    this thread: http://typophile.com/node/99144\r\n\r\nAlso concerning numerals,
    when it comes to old-styles ones (that extend above/below a horizontal band) there's
    a nice old French twist (which I actually find more functional, since it causes
    numeral strings to sit vertically more in-line with the alphabetics) where the
    \"3\" and \"5\" sit high, not low. See just past the half-way point here: http://fontfeed.com/archives/figuring-out-numerals-the-sequel/\r\n\r\nBTW,
    if you're liking this line of development take a long, close look at the Romain
    du Roi.\r\n\r\nNick, I agree that that sort of thing deserves investigation, but
    to me popularity isn't necessarily conducive to functionality.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    i get the circumflex now. And the examples of the 5's are exactly what i had in
    mind, I agree they would make more sense.\r\nthank you guys these are a lot of
    useful areas to explore. Part of my reasoning for this project is to learn, and
    I feel even if I don't actually create a Bodoni inspired face, I will have a broader
    base of knowledge for future projects. thanks again.\r\n\r\nj."
