  body: "The following behavior refers to Adobe InDesign, which I consider the benchmark
    for sophisticated OpenType feature support:\r\n\r\nWhichever glyphs are include
    in the \u2018cpsp\u2019 feature, they will be spaced accordingly (whether or not
    they are capitals), when the \u2018All Caps\u2019 feature is applied, or with
    \u2018caps lock\u2019 depressed when typing.\r\n\r\nHowever, if small cap glyphs
    are included in the cpsp feature, their spacing won\u2019t be affected when smcp
    or c2sc is applied. \r\n\r\nThere is no \u2018scsp\u2019 feature.\r\n\r\nTherefore,
    if small caps are to be spaced out, it has to be done by giving them wider sidebearings.\r\n\r\nThe
    trick is to have the spacing of the small caps match the spacing of the all-cap
    setting with cpsp applied.\r\n\r\n**\r\n\r\nBut how many fonts have this \u2018extra
    sidebearing\u2019 spacing for small caps, tuned to the amount of extra spacing
    in the \u2018c2sc\u2019 feature?\r\n\r\n**\r\n\r\nAs an aside, I very rarely include
    the cpsp feature in my types.\r\nI think the base setting for an all cap setting
    should be the sidebearings of the glyphs; then the typographer may track in or
    out from this benchmark according to the demands of the layout, without having
    an arbitrary value implemented which is unrelated to that."

    is, quite simply, selling your products to typographers who actually know what
    they're doing. Very old school. Rah."

    are a couple of \u201Ccpsp\u201D fonts, Adobe Caslon and Linotype Palatino.\r\n(The
