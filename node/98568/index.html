  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p><em>*title &amp; post edited by moderator due to claims of falsified information and defamation</em></p>
<p>Last week Latinotype removed Bon Appetit from sale at Myfonts citing that &lsquo;After discussion with Alejandro Paul of Sudtipos it was deemed to be too similar to Lady Rene.&rsquo; It&rsquo;s become apparent that Ale Paul, who has a long history of bullying small designers and design firms with legal action over distantly similar type designs due to personal insecurity, had threatened them into removing the typeface.</p>
<p>On Latinotype&rsquo;s facebook page, certain posters who voiced opposition to the removal had received threatening private messages by Ale Paul demanding that they clean up their post. This removal is an insult to Coto Mendez and is essentially an accusation of plagiarism. Take a look at this image which compares both fonts. Its clear to see that the differences between these two typefaces is greater than the differences between Arial and Helvetica. Arial has been established as &lsquo;legally&rsquo; original because there are enough differences in comparison. By those standards Bon Appetit is miles apart from Lady Rene.</p>
<p><a href="http://i.imgur.com/4cgKG.jpg">http://i.imgur.com/4cgKG.jpg</a></p>
<p>I implore the community to support Coto Mendez and to send letters of support to Latinotype to place the font back up for sale.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Ale Paul also contacted me after I released my <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/nicksfonts/glengary-nf/" target="_blank">Glengary NF</a>, which was based on a 1932 Stephenson Blake typeface, originally named Glenmoy, as was his <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/sudtipos/mousse-script/" target="_blank">Mousse Script</a>. Mr Paul politely requested that I pull my version, and I politely demurred, primarily because I had chosen to sharpen the corners in my version (whereas his version, more faithful to the original, had rounded corners), and because I took exception to the designs of the /p/ and /x/ in the original, and that&rsquo;s where we left it.</p>
<p>In any event, in this instance Mr Paul presented his case directly to me, unlike Stuart Sandler, who bellyached to MyFonts.com that my Mellisande NF infringed on his copyright to Honey Script, a claim which I find questionable, given the age of the original. Nonetheless, MyFonts prefers to err on the side of caution in such instances and gives the complaining party the benefit of the doubt, whether or not the complaint has merit.</p>
<p>Mr Paul is unquestionably talented, and I frankly envy a great many of his scripts: I wish that I had the patience, the discipline and the resources that he has. If what you say is true, it is indeed unfortunate that Mr Paul would resort to such tactics.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>The problem is that because third-party sites that host content often make only a few pennies in ad revenue per user, no one user account is valuable enough to be worth getting involved in litigation over.</p>
<p>Thus, as long as someone falsely accused of copyright infringement has to hire a lawyer and appear in court despite the accusation being false - instead of being able to safely ignore a false accusation without danger of becoming liable for statutory damages, or at least to respond to it in a way that involves minimal cost and effort - unless false accusations of this nature bring severe penalties, this problem will continue.</p>
<p>If, for example, companies like YouTube would be able to use false accusers as a source of revenue, thanks to laws providing for punitive damages from false copyright violation accusations, then it would be worth their time to check out if accusations are valid.</p>

<p>quadibloc: Legal action costs money. An actual legal filing of copyright infringement costs the filer as well as the defender. Plus, in the USA, copyright infringement on a font is only possible if somebody actually rips off your outlines, which is pretty heinous and can&rsquo;t generally happen by coincidence.</p>
<p>(NOTE: I actually favor more copyright protection for fonts than exists in the USA, I&rsquo;m just commenting on the present state of affairs. Then again, I also favor significantly shorter period of protection for copyright than the US status quo.)</p>

		<div class="commentbody">In terms of the typefaces in question, I agree with Tom that it would be best to see samples of the same text in both. But with regard to what we&rsquo;ve seen so far, I&rsquo;m inclined to think that this is not a matter of plagiarism but of entry into a similar market of a product in the same category. There is a long, long history of this in the type business: sometimes coincidental, sometimes a deliberate attempt to capitalise on the success of an existing product. The narrower the genre, i.e. the fewer designs that exist in a style, the more likely a new release is to cause annoyance to whoever got there first.</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Several years back, BertholdType chose to sue me because I used the words Boulevard and City in some of my typeface names. Had they simply made I polite request, I would have happily complied. Instead, a game of legal gotcha ensued, which generated several reams of paper, with rebuttals and amended complaints and amended rebuttals, and so on.</p>
<p>However, a lot of legal work is research, and BertholdType&ndash;rather foolishly&ndash;chose to sue an English major with an IQ that places him in the top .001% of the population (okay: I&rsquo;m too smart for my own good). When the second rebuttal essentially nailed Berthold&rsquo;s lawyers for fifteen counts of Fraud by Omission under the U.S. Code, the charm offensive&ndash;a.k.a., Melissa Hunt&ndash;suggested that we settle the matter amicably&ndash;in other words, in precisely the same manner as we would have if they had made a polite request in the first place.

On Myfonts.com, type in the letters shown for Bon Appetit in Lady Rene, and there still is not enough similarity for a valid complaint. In addition, Lady Rene is an all-caps face, where Bon Appetit has a lowercase.</p>

Annoyance, to be sure; no one likes competition in this business, but annoyance is not a valid reason to demand a takedown.</p>
<p>More examples of Bon Appetit can be found here:

All legal action costs money, but DMCA notices and cease and desist letters come cheap - and they&rsquo;re sufficient to deny innocent individuals access to free hosting services, with effective remedies not being similarly cheap, which is why there&rsquo;s a problem.</p>
<p>Can this be remedied without vitiating copyright protection? That isn&rsquo;t an easy question to answer, and the problem in the legal system may go beyond copyright.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>This thread saddens me tremendously. Some of Latinotype&rsquo;s founders are fine designers whose good work was first brought to the public eye as part of Sudtipos.</p>
<p>Laura Varsky is a well-known and admired graphic designer in Latin America. She entrusted Sudtipos with her work on Lady René, so please understand that I consider it my duty and obligation to defend her work and original ideas when necessary. I developed the Lady René font from Ms. Varsky&rsquo;s drawings so I personally know every little detail of her work and the ideas behind it.</p>
<p>There recently was a massive advertising campaign by an Argentine company called Monoblock. It made quite a lot of use of Lady René. The name of the product advertised in this campaign is Bon Appétit. This was a very illustration-heavy campaign which became quite popular with graphic designers in Argentina and Chile. A simple web search will lead you to it.</p>
<p>When Latinotype published their font, also called Bon Appetit, I found several similarities with Lady René. I asked some friends and acquaintances in the industry about this, and almost everyone&rsquo;s advice was to resolve it via private dialogue. So I contacted Latinotype privately and asked for some changes to be made to their font so that the similarities wouldn&rsquo;t be so obvious. Coto Mendoza sent to me, via Latinotype, some notes on her process. The images and references she sent had nothing to do with the final published product, which, the Latinotype guys agreed, had many similarities with Lady René.</p>
<p>I certainly never asked Latinotype to remove their font from distribution. All I asked for was the modification of some details that make it similar to Lady René. And they in fact agreed to my request. I was never forceful, impolite or threatening about it. Ultimately, it was their decision to actually remove the font from circulation.</p>
<p>I could have just as easily deposited the whole debate into the chaotic court of public opinion, and turned it into an outright argument like this thread does. I personally elected not to go that route because I thought that as graphic designers and type designers who have previously collaborated to a good degree of success, the Latinotype guys and I would see eye to eye — at the very least on obvious aesthetic similarities and idea derivation. Also, this is an issue I have previously run into on many occasions, and always managed to resolve privately and amicably, so never felt the need to put private laundry on a public clothesline.</p>
<p>This is all I have to say publicly about this issue. I would really appreciate it if people participating in this thread would not rush to judgment based on a one-sided post about an issue mostly managed in private.</p>
