  body: I guess I&#39;ll be the one to say it. I don&#39;t think this is a font. Notice
    that the two l&#39;s are not identical.  So next I ask myself, what if I had to
    try to re-create it? I looked for a font that had similar joining and looping
    characteristics, and hopefully a similar S &#40;Helinda Rook was the first one
    I found, and not necessarily the best&#41;. Then I played a bit with it in Illustrator.  I
    compressed and rotated the S and I pulled some outline points on the t, added
    a leading tail to it, as well as some shear and stretch on the lower case letters
    to produce a somewhat similar look with about 20 minutes of inexpert manipulation.

  body: I thought this was the entire thread. I&#39;m glad you told us now, but it
    would have been nicer to tell us sooner, so that some of us wouldn&#39;t still
    be searching &#40;or disagreeing whether it is a font or not&#41;.
