  and I was shooting for something reminiscent of beer, the wheat harvest, with some
  feeling of history and handcrafted but orderly. I iterated a bunch in ink on paper,
  and then chose the one I liked best, and have been trying to work out the details
  on the computer. I would love your feedback on shapes, counters, terminals, letter-spacing,
  etc. Thanks in advance,\r\n\r\nPeter[img:sites/default/files/old-images/HeidelfestLogo_2012_04_5676.png]"
