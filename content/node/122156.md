  [[http://www.pi-news.net/wp/uploads/2011/05/M%C3%BCnchner-Merkur.jpg|current name
  plate]] is not this one, and quite uninspiring.\r\n\r\nDigging further back I found
  examples that are close and look like a condense Galliard, but are definitely not
  the same as the photo I took:\r\n<img src=\"http://www.subsidiumev.de/upload_images/muenchner-merkur.jpg\">\r\nNotice
  especially the way the r hooks around in a brush-like or talon like manner in the
  photo.\r\n\r\nAny help is appreciated!"

    I suspect it is custom for the newspaper.\r\n\r\nPerhaps by Typofonderie?:\r\nhttp://typofonderie.com/about/bespoke-typefaces/"
