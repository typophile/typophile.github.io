  body: "Morris Fuller Benton's Othello was released by American Type Founders after
    the 1934 cataog was issued. The design was popularized  in 1967 by the cover of
    Andy Warhol's The Velvet Underground album. In additions to the two versions mentioned
    by Ryuk there is  an outline version in <a href=\"\r\nhttp://web1.doverpublications.com/cgi-bin/toc.pl/0486995038\">24
    Outline Display Fonts CD-ROM & Book by Dover/Dan Solo</a>. Somewhat similar <a
    href=\"http://www.fonts.com/font/monotype-imaging/pl-fiorello/condensed\">PL Fiorello
    Condensed</a> by  Photolettering. For a similar font decorated with spikes see
    <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/search/macbeth/fonts/\">Macbeth</a>.\r\nDon\r\nEDIT:
    Corrected ATF release date which Jaspert stated as 1896."
