body: I need to output a book, that is partially set in Adobe Jenson MM on a Linotype
  Hell ripping device. Unfortunately, the rip does not like the MM or open type format,  so
  I try to convert the original font in fontlab v.4. to a type 1 font. I have a hard
  time adding more than one font to a suitcase. Any suggestions? <BR>Thanks a lot!

    used to download both postscript files and fonts to our rips. I know for a fact
    that I used it to download MM fonts that wouldn&#39;t otherwise work. I can&#39;t
    find it here, but perhaps someone else could point it out to you. '

  body: Found it. It is from Adobe. Of course. I seem to remember it coming with ATM
    and Type Reunion. It is one of their type utilities. Don&#39;t know where you&#39;ll
    find it now unless you have some of those discs lying around. Good luck!

  body: hi im having exactly the same problem. we have a copy of Myriad which we need
    to use on OSX too.  <BR> <BR>I have tried using the downloader to download the
    fonts to various printers but it still sometimes defaults to courier.  <BR> <BR>I
    am now in the midst of converting the font to type1 using fontographer. I have
    output the files to type 1 and having lots of problems outputting them. sometimes
    they default to courier sometimes they dont. OSX seems to recognise some of the
    fonts but not all of them. im pulling my hair out.

    TransType currently does not support OpenType PS &#40;.otf&#41;. We plan to release
    a version of TransType later this year that will handle that, but at the moment,
    our only product that can convert OpenType PS &#40;.otf&#41; fonts to Type 1 fonts
    is FontLab 4.6.  <BR> <BR>Regards,  <BR>Adam Twardoch <BR>Fontlab Ltd. '

  body: 'I&#39;m sure most of these folks are long gone, but most and perhaps all
    of these kinds of problems are generally due to incorrect system software configurations
    &#40;ATM version, driver version, etc.&#41; and are not intrinsic in the fonts
    themselves. <BR> <BR>People having these sorts of problems should first consult
    the OpenType readme, at <a href="http://www.adobe.com/type/opentype" target="_blank">http://www.adobe.com/type/opentype</a>.
    <BR> <BR>On the off chance these folks are still around, I will pose some specific
    questions.... <BR> <BR>Peter: <BR> <BR>More information please. As far as we are
    aware, there are no known printing compatibility issues involving normal RIPs
    and OpenType. What model of RIP, and most importantly what level of PostScript?
    What error message or problems occur? What driver version are you using? What
    OS version? What app and version? <BR> <BR>The only RIP I have ever seen that
    simply could not handle OpenType also couldn&#39;t print TrueType. They were part
    of a specialized newspaper system that required AFM files and Type 1 fonts only.
    However, it&#39;s possible there is some component in the workflow that creates
    a problem with OpenType. <BR> <BR>David: <BR> <BR>Again, more information would
    be helpful. What app are you printing from? Have you tried the OpenType version
    of Myriad, or just the MM version? What version of OS X? <BR> <BR>Brenda: <BR>
    <BR>Generally speaking, OpenType fonts work just fine with QuarkXPress 4.11. What
    specific problem are you having? What OS are you on, what version of ATM are you
    running, what kind of printer, and what printer driver? <BR> <BR>Regards, <BR>

  body: In the MM version, there are numerous separate supplemental fonts that add
    those &#34;swooshes&#34;; some of them are separate bits that attach to the ends
    of letters, others are more &#34;swash&#34; versions of the letters themselves,
    and others are completely independent ornaments. <BR> <BR>T

  body: Thomas, the RIP our newspaper&#39;s printer uses can&#39;t handle OTF or TT
    fonts; we have to use Type 1 with custom encoding only, no CID. Not sure if it&#39;s
    customized or not

  body: Sorry to hear that your newspaper&#39;s printer can&#39;t handle mid-90s technologies.
    Bummer. <BR> <BR>Just to elaborate on that, I&#39;ve been told of a newspaper
    production system that requires that the Type 1 fonts and matching AFM files be
    actually loaded onto the RIP. Not much to be done about that one. But for anything
    less extreme, remember that once a PostScript flavored OpenType font is in a print
    stream, it literally is a Type 1 font. Same for it being in a PDF. <BR> <BR>What
    types of files does this newspaper printer accept, exactly? PDF? <BR> <BR>Cheers,
