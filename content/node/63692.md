  Gothic but with closer inspection, it clearly isn't, it\u2019s not Blair or Gotham
  either. Any help would be really appreciated!\r\n\r\nNB. This looks very similar
  to the font that Chanel uses[img:sites/default/files/old-images/palmspringstyle_4278.jpg]"

    A and M vertices aren't right.

    (or substituted), but to me the rest matches Gotham as far as I can tell. That
    G, S and R seem spot on, although my eyes are not as calibrated as some here.
    What do you think Jan?\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

    this week:\r\nhttp://typophile.com/node/63563\r\n\r\nI went to the Commonwealth
    Utilities website and saw that they used a similar \r\nfont in their nav. I downloaded
    the flash .swf and tried to open it and was told by \r\nflash that there was a
    missing font: Chanel Gras c21 et Plus. I searched for a\r\nfont by that name but
    came up with nothing in Google. Maybe that was an error\r\nin the Flash application.
    It does look like the typeface used by Chanel on their website. \r\n\r\n\r\n"

    but the Commonwealth Utilities and the typefaces above look very similar. \r\nWeird
    that flash pulled up the name Chanel Gras c21 et Plus - they could be owned by
    the same company?\r\n\r\nI'm pretty sure now it's an actual font and as eliason
    said it is a small-caps variant."

  body: The nav in Commonwealth's swf uses an actual font, the system had changed
    it to Arial when I opened it. Flash told me the Chanel font was missing. I agree
    that it doesn't make sense that this book and Commonwealth Utilities would be
    using Chanel's proprietary font. I was just reporting what I found as I looked
    into this. Maybe that type error is concidental and it's not the Chanel font.

    find it really strange that searching for Chanel Gras C21 Et Plus pulls nothing

    shared it with a small number of people rather than putting it for sale?"

  body: I did a quick google search and didn't come up with any information that said
    Commonwealth is related to Chanel. It's possible that this wasn't shared, but
    that someone who may have worked at Chanel borrowed it (took it with them when
    they left, or freelanced on a Chanel project etc.). I have a couple of proprietary
    corporate typefaces that were custom made for client projects (like the GE font).
    There is a similar thread between these projects/samples in that these are all
    related to style/fashion.
