  body: 'Noah, there are a number of challenges facing lefties when it comes to writing,
    some practical and some cultural. Practically, you have the problem that most
    writing tools work best when pulled, rather than pushed, which means, for someone
    working with a left-to-right script, one needs to start on the right edge of most
    letters. This means, of course, that you need to be a very good judge of the proportions
    of letters. This isn&#39;t by any means an insurmountable challenge, indeed, this,
    reversed, is the normal way of writing Hebrew: a right-to-left script usually
    written starting at the left side of the letter. Arabic writers tend to push the
    pen much more frequently than either Latin or Hebrew writers -- hence the prevelance
    of the flexible reed pen in Arabic calligraphy --, but they also tend to rotate
    the page, writing from top to bottom, as seen in the short film at the <a href="http://www.arabictypography.com/flash.html">Arabic
    Typography</a> website &#40;click on the dark square moving across the screen
    to see the movie; other squares take you to different content&#41;. <BR> <BR>The
    cultural challenges are more difficult. In my talk at ATypI in Prague, I discussed
    the role of ductus in letter identity, and as an illustration wrote the Latin
    letter <i>a</i> with the typical ducti of three different scripts that have assumed
    their most common forms written with broad writing instruments: Latin, Hebrew
    and Devanagari. <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/30/56243.gif"
    alt="Getting one&#39;s ducti in a row..."> <BR> <BR>[By the way, I usually write
    Hebrew letters with what are sold by calligraphy suppliers as lefty nibs: they&#39;re
    not perfect for the task -- they should be cut on even more of an angle -- but
    they are more convenient than reed pens for quick jottings.] <BR> <BR>The red
    line indicates that, structurally, the three letters are almost identical -- so
    far as the tool will permit --, which is why I don&#39;t think a purely structural
    understanding of letter identity is <i>sufficient.</i> Ductus is part of our conventional
    identification of letters, and as such is culturally conservative. <BR> <BR>The
    good news is that ductus is not a fixed thing in most scripts, and certainly not
    in the Latin script. Over the centuries, a wide variety of ducti have been accepted
    by readers, although almost always as a result of changes in writing implement.
    The most dramatic evolution in the accepted ductus of the Latin script accompanied
    the introduction of the split, spencerian nib. <BR> <BR>Other scripts have embraced
    not only different ducti in different styles of lettering, but also varying ducti
    within a style. The illustration below, also from my Prague talk, shows the range
    of ducti in the Byzantine Greek style. <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/30/56244.gif"
    alt="The influence of ouzo on ductus..."> <BR> <BR> <BR>In my experience of trying
    to write Latin letters with atypical ducti, I found that it is actually very difficult.
    Perhaps it will be easier for you, as a lefty? What I found was not simply that
    the axis of contrast is reversed but that the angle makes it awkward to render
    the normal structure of the letters &#40;see the dip in the bold of &#39;Devanagari&#39;
    <i>a</i>&#41;. What you will find -- and I encourage you to try it -- is that
    attempting to render humanist letterforms with a lefty ductus will produce wild
    and wonderful results, but they won&#39;t look like traditional humanist letters.
    Why not? Because the identity of the latter is not merely structural but determined
    by their ductus. Also, you will have a much easier time with a narrower nib than
    I used: I was going to high contrast to make a point.'

  body: I almost never use the term &#39;proof&#39; outside of the context of logic
    or mathematics. But I do, as you know, ask for evidence. In contrasting an understanding
    of letter identity that <i>includes</i> ductus with a commonly held structural,
    or skeletal, understanding, I refer to the illustration below. A purely structural
    understanding of letter identity cannot explain why the shape on the right falls
    outside the range of our conventional identification of a letter A. Note that
    I am not claiming that the shape is unidentifiable as an A, and certainly not
    that it could be confused for any other letter, only that it does not belong in
    the conventionally determined set of forms that, taken together, constitute the
    identity of that letter. If you remember the discussion of letter identity on
    the ATypI list a few months ago, I avoid a Platonist notion of letter identity
    -- I don&#39;t think there is any ideal, abstract letter A of which all letter
    A&#39;s are imperfect shadows. <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/30/56247.gif"

    <BR>2&#41; Allow me -and others who have the fortune of being unencumbered by
    an unhealthy infatuation with a certain human body part- to believe what simply
    makes sense: that <i>stroke contrast</i> is indeed helpful, but the sort you describe
    and defend is an arbitrary and circumstantial subset of that. Another thing that
    makes sense is this: that the separation of structure and ductus is artificial.
    Structure is a chimera used by chirographers to justify their dogma; and it goes
    against notan. <BR> <BR>In the case of your righthand &#34;A&#34;, I would say

    elaboration of sound reasoning. I&#39;ve never heard anything even close. <BR>2&#41;
    I would much rather compare two &#34;A&#34;s where one has the conventional stroke
    contrast while the other has two symmetrical strokes that taper thin towards the
    top, and have a thin bar. I have reason to believe that the latter form would
    actually be &#34;better&#34;, arguably both functionally and aesthetically &#40;although
    of course the latter is highly subjective, even though JF for one has pointed

  body: I don&#39;t see any inconsistency in the two concepts. Ductus works on the

    forms. Unless I&#39;m misinterpreting you, Hrant, your idea is that the variation
    among letters when combined into words creates recognizable forms on a macro level.
    Clearly then, familiarity with individual letter forms would enhance familiarity
    with word forms. Ductus, then, is hardly incompatible with boumas. Unless I&#39;m

    be the humanist hand, because the ductus is part of what makes that style what

    <BR> <BR>Thinking about this thread some more, it strikes me that talking about
    ductus <i>per se</i> in the context of letter identity is potentially misleading.
    It happens, as I mention, that our writing systems originated as marks of an surface
    with a tool, and ductus is simply the visible artifact of that. So I&#39;ve been
    speaking about ductus because I&#39;ve been speaking about the historical development
    of scripts &#40;and because Noah asked about a specific historical style, with
    a particular ductus resulting from a particular tool&#41;. But it may help you
    to understand that we&#39;re at least partly on the same wavelength if, instead,
    I talk about <i>notan</i> in the context of letter identity. As the discussion
    on the ATypI list showed, people do tend to think about letter identity in structuralist
    or abstract, Platonist terms. You and I both disagree with this -- if I have understood
    you correctly --, and agree that letter identity involves the total image of the
    letter. As it happens, that image, in the historical development of our writing
    systems, is almost always determined by one kind of ductus or another. The particular
    ductus is part of the definition of specific historical styles. So when I&#39;m
    talking about history, I&#39;m going to talk about ductus. I think the role of
    ductus in contemporary type design is something we should all be thinking about

    <BR>It is not impossible for the standard shapes of the letters to be formed well
    by lefthanders. It is equally not possible for all righthanders to form the letters
    well; as with the lefthander, some skill and, dare-to-say, talent &#40;a combination
    of sight, judgement, kinesthetics, control, allowance for the tool and materials,
    and more; desire and an unprejudiced mind, and a pleasure in the making&#41; are
    necessary. <BR> <BR>Noah asked about the &#40;Humanist&#41; ductus -- to me, that
    is the path and order of the stroke, primarily. Pen-angle or bias is secondary.
    In John&#39;s lovely example, the a&#39;s paths are identical; the bias of the
    tool is different. To truly have a different ductus, the  &#39;a&#39;  would need
    to have a different structure.  <BR>For example, the &#39;a&#39; of blackletter
    is angular; the turns are quicker and tighter; the course of the tool, more direct
    and straighter. In Antiqua, the paths are made rounder and softer; the turns,
    slower and more open.  <BR>Each share &#40;save the hairline that often closes
    the upper bowl of the two-storey blackletter  &#39;a&#39;&#41; an underlying structure
    of an arcade and a lower-left bowl, but the shape of the path along which the
    tool is con-ducted &#40;from L. ducere, to lead&#41; varies enough that we see
    them as very different styles. This is enough to distinguish the ducti of the
    two hands. <BR>A radically different ductus for  a  might be more like that of
    the Egyptian heiratic A &#40;the sign for the bird, kite&#41; where the path is
    singular, made with no lifting of the tool from the surface. The belly of the
    bird is the bowl of &#39;a&#39;; the beak and head make the arcade. The terminating
    tail is the spur at the lower left of &#39;a&#39;. The effect is that of an &#39;a&#39;
    with an opening at the right side of the bowl. You will see this ocassionally
    in some handwriting; the effect is an affectation, but tolerable. <BR> <BR>For
    the lefthander who is frustrated by the edged pen, there is the flexible pen,
    used for copperplate engravers&#39; script. Quite a market, if done well. As the
    pen angle is reversed in most strokes from that in edged pen work, and thush tending
    heavy from upper right to lower left, it is more difficult for a righthander to
    make; the pen or paper must be held in reverse, or with the nib in a special canted
    holder. Conversely, a lefthander is naturally positioned to move the pen &#40;always
    towards, never away, as the sharp nib will bite in&#41; easily and without strain.
    <BR> <BR>if I have a chance, I will find texts by the LH calligraphers, but semester
    is over and students do wander off to home. <BR> <BR>Solsticial greetings to all,
    <BR> <BR>G.'

  body: 'Hector, <BR>There was a book, several years ago, that addressed this issue;
    one of Margaret Shepherd&#39;s series, I believe. A series of hands used the reversed
    &#40;rotated would be a more accurate description&#41; pen angle, as I recall.
    The reversed stress effect is, to my taste, not altogether pleasant; it is as
    if the sun had risen in the west &#40;-:  <BR> <BR>The Latin script doesn&#39;t
    adapt well to the reversed placement of stress; counters close up, terminals become
    heavy and thick, and serifs are as prominent than stems.   <BR> <BR>As close as
    one might find to a reversed axis hand are the Rustic and Beneventian or, more
    contemporarily, the draftsman&#39;s hand, as codified in Tekton etc. by Siegel.
    For famous lefthanders, there&#39;s Leonardo da Vinci; though his writing is simply
    mirrored, and definitely handwriting not calligraphy &#40;that is, it does not
    aspire to a particular beauty in execution of the writing and in effect on reading
    by any other than the writer&#41;. It is somewhat germane in that he used a lefthander&#39;s
    natural angle for his edged pen. There is an exotic beauty to a page of his, of
    course. <BR> <BR>You will notice in John&#39;s example too the Devanagari, which
    requires this reversed angle for much of its effect; look instead for examples
    of this script. Or copperplate; it is quite lovely and as I wrote before a natural
    fit to the lefthander&#39;s peculiar situation.  <BR> <BR>Then, there are hands
    such as Insular half uncial that use a flatter pen angle and a rounder ductus;
    these are somewhat simpler for a lefthander to accomplish, as well as for righthanders.
    World-wise, there are the Ethiopic syllabary, Armenian, Coptic &#40;I&#39;m sure
    there&#39;s one or two missing here&#41; that also use a flat angle &#40;oh; Slavonic
    etc.&#41; with very strong verticals -- rather Bodoni, eh? -- that lefthanders
    might try. Or a different tool, such as a brush or flexible nib. There are options
    and stretegies for most any condition that allow a route to making letters by
    hand, and making them well. There is, though, no Royal Road; not for lefthanders
    or for righthanders. Hey; use Illustrator and apply an angled brush. It&#39;s
    a Princely Path.'

    references baseball teams with high percentages of lefties, and statistical studies

  body: Beauty is a complex concept, the subject of a huge amount of philosophical
    literature. The word calligraphy, obviously, has an explicit etymological link
    to the beautiful, and the majority of calligraphy tends to involve a deliberate
    attempt to create something beautiful. Even challenging modern calligraphic works
    that use non-traditional forms that might be fractured, distressed or otherwise
    evoke a contemporary ugliness, tend to do so within formally constructed arrangements,
    and so fall well within the circumfrence of the aesthetic as considered by the
    philosophers. <BR> <BR>If we need to distinguish between handwriting and calligraphy,
    it must be as activities rather than as products, since there is nothing to prevent
    handwriting from being beautiful &#40;I only wish mine were&#41;. I believe the
    distinction has to do with the intent of putting down a text entirely for the
    sake of its content &#40;handwriting&#41;, and putting down a text in a manner
    that gives prominence to its form and arrangement. It isn&#39;t actually necessary
    for anyone to agree on whether a particular thing is beautiful for its consideration
    to fall within the realm of aesthetics. Beauty is not one thing, but many things,
    and appreciation of different modes of beauty is both cultural and individual,
    and develops as we are exposed to and assimilate new experiences of the beatiful.

  body: 'John,  <BR>The complexity of the philosophical implications of meanings of
    beauty is one reason I&#39;d rather not go into it; perhaps at typotechnica.  <BR>I
    agree that there are differences in the purpose of the text that affect its perception
    -- as with Leonardo, to record; or, as with Zapf, to present -- which differences
    seem to fall at their most extreme at four quadrants, controlled by the interactions
    of several polarities : personal/interpersonal and attention/disregard; attention
    to text, detail, and overall design, or disregard of the same. In those quadrants
    there&#39;s an infinite field through which a  rendering of a text might pass
    and indeed be found beautiful, or ugly, or valuable, or worthless by a viewer
    or a culture.  <BR> <BR>Your mention of calligraphic is important, as there is
    much work that is non-textual, but that might be considered to partake of some
    of the qualities that make calligraphy &#40;and there are many, most of which
    I&#39;ve yet to fully master: ars longa&#41; worthy of being considered beautiful.  <BR>
    <BR>Hrant, <BR>Unfortunately I also have failed to convince you of the value of
    knowing the cause of much of shapings that make up the letters we deal with in
    type. Without that understanding I fear that wheels will be reinvented, or worse,
    simply imitated, should there be not a base for asking truly pertinent questions
    about the sources of letter features.   <BR>It is not good, generally, to take
    anything for granted. If the maker would work against a thing, then the maker
    would best know something about that thing. How best to achieve an effect, how
    best to avoid an effect? What has gone before, and how did that all work out?
    Why did it work then, but not now, in this medium?  <BR>Assimilate the lessons
    of the pen and then move on beyond; let the pen-made shape inform the work, using
    judgement to choose the best shape for the work; reject, adapt, or accept? These
    are design decisions that must be available to anyone working in letters. These
    all will ground the work in solid foundations or create an airy fantasy, each
    fit to its purpose. <BR> <BR>As you know, I don&#39;t at all advocate strictly
    edged-pen-like type; the pen is, like a computer, another tool for making. But
    the things I make -- letters -- happen to have a long history, both calligraphic
    and typographic; that history is something worth the time spent investigating
    and considering when making them.  <BR> <BR>have a lovely,'
