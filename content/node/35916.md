  typeface I just saw on on tv? It was was for commercial for \"Fox Movies\" on the
  Fox channel. I tried going to their website, but no luck. It flashes really quick
  during the commercial so it's hard to get a good look at it, but it has similar
  features to \"ALLOY\" FROM http://youworkforthem.com/product.php?sku=T0027\r\n\r\nThank
  you!"
