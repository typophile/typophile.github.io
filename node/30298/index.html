  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>Hi all,</p>
<p>Just received my login details for Typophile, so now I can finally post a question that' s been burning my lips for some time now&hellip;</p>
<p>I found this typeface in a novel ( Con Sordino by Knut Hamsun, translated into Dutch ) in my father' s attic.
Since I loved it instantly ( the typeface that is ) I started looking for it everywhere, but couldn' t find anything similar at first.
The printers - Zuid-Hollandse Boek en Handelsdrukkerij - seems to be out of business, so no luck there.</p>
<p>However, a search on certain designers of that period - I assumed it was a late 19th- early 20th century Typeface - came up with a pretty similar type, namely Helga Antiqua in a pdf file about the Stempel Foundry ( downloadable here: <a href="http://www.schriftenservice-d-stempel.de/ChronikStempel.pdf">http://www.schriftenservice-d-stempel.de/ChronikStempel.pdf</a> , see page 5 )
In the ( pdf- ) text, it says &quot; 1911 - Von Professor F. W. Kleukens wird die Helga-Antiqua herausgegeben&hellip; &quot; and the name &quot; Helga-Antiqua &quot; is printed alongside.
To me, it seems to be a very close match &hellip;</p>
<p>Now here' s my question(s) :</p>
<ul>
<li>IS it indeed Helga Antiqua ?</li>
<li>Who designed it ? Was it Kleuskens or is it an older typeface that he &quot; revived &quot; - maybe with a new name ?</li>
<li>Who owns the design today ?</li>
<li>I couldn' t find any digital version of it . Does any of you know about one ?</li>
</ul>
<p>As it is a nice and very readable Typeface, I am thinking of creating something similar in digital form.
What about the legal issues ?</p>
<p>Thanks to all for looking into this,
Regards,</p>
<p>Peter</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I think you have identified it correctly. The Jaspert &lsquo;Encyclopaedia of Type Faces&rsquo; shows Helga and says it is also known as Olga. It credits F. W. Kleukens as the designer, and gives &lsquo;Stempel, 1912&rsquo; as the original foundry, but also lists Enschedé, which is Dutch.</p>
<p>Unfortunately the type sample in the book is not the complete typeface, but it does match the letters in your sample.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Mike and Stefan, thanks to both of you for the replies ( haven' t been in front of my computer again today until now &hellip; )</p>
<p>I stumbled upon this book last year and had been looking for the Typeface using different sources, but only found the pdf- file about Stempel last week and that showed ( what looked to me- ) the best match so far.
As a matter of fact, I started digitizing it last year and finished the lowercase letters so far ( didn' t have time to do the uppercase yet + I wanted more info on the designer and of course its whereabouts )</p>
<p>It all merely started as an exercise. 
I learned drawing letterforms in my artschool-days ( seventies ) using a proper pencil and paper, but wanted to try something digital now. I bought FontLab' s TypeTool and ScanFont to do so and I' ve been using vector drawing applications for many years ( I' m a freelance illustrator &hellip; )</p>
<p>As said before, I am thinking of creating a font based on some of its characteristics.
I particularly like the shapes of the lowercase &ldquo;a&rdquo; and &ldquo;g&rdquo; and also the short descenders.
If I can go on with it, I' d like to create a complete family with Italics etc.</p>
<p>Atached here are the lowercase characters I finished.</p>

<p>The &ldquo;k&rdquo; is similar as in the original print, so maybe it isn' t Helga Antiqua then after all ?
Here' s a sample with the original print on top and the one I created below ( don' t mind the kerning, &lsquo;cause I didn&rsquo; t fine-tune that yet )</p>

It&rsquo;s possible the print quality or type size might be different, and so the details may be slightly different too. In metal types there are often point size differences in letterform details.</p>

<p>I still believe the legs of the &lsquo;k&rsquo; are joined farther from the stem in that sample than in your letter, but it could be an attribute of a larger point size than your book showed.</p>

In some ways Helga Antiqua resembles what might have happened if one decided to use Ehmke as the basis for a text typeface. The &lsquo;g&rsquo; is the most glaring difference that jumps out.</p>
<p>Another comparison is another face designed by Kleukens for Bauer, around 1900-1908, originally known as Kleukens Antiqua, but digitized by Scangraphic as <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/efscangraphic/trieste-sb/">Trieste</a>. Notice it&rsquo;s similarities with Helga, including the G and g resemblances.</p>

<p>Before I found the pdf with the words &quot; Helga Antiqua &ldquo;, I was almost sure it was an Ehmcke ' designed typeface, because I knew about some of his other designs</p>
<p>Trieste has lots of differences to me though, especially the uppercase P, R, W are very different than the ones in the novel&hellip;</p>

Allthough Trieste is somehow close, I think you should finish your own design, which is warmer and &ldquo;rounder&rdquo; and therefor more appealing. Good luck.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Very interesting the idea to digitalize Helga from Stempel.
If you are interested in I can ask if the matrizes are still existing. I am dealer of Schriften-Service GmbH. Helga is not part of the actuell list of types we offer - but e.g. we sold Koch Antiqua, 48 p some weeks ago (its not officially listed, too.)</p>
<p>The 1926 specimen shows some examples of Helga, by the way.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Stefan, thank you for spending some time looking things up.
I wonder if it was a commonly used typeface - even back in the early twentieth century &hellip;</p>
<p>As Mike says, I am working on a new design - loosely based on some of Helga' s features - but I didn' t have that much time lately, so it is only early days to show some sample.
However, I will try to pick it up again as soon as I can.
The example below is just an impression of what is to come. Some of the glyphs need some reshaping, but I hope you can see where it' s going.</p>
<p>Mike, thanks again for your help. I' ll try to mail you later today.</p>
<p>Georg, that could be interesting indeed. Maybe finally a complete sample could show up :)</p>
