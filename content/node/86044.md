body: What would you call a "Didone" (high thick/thin contrast) sans-serif? There
  doesn't appear to be a class that I am aware of.

  body: The story goes that first sans serif types were based on didone proportions.
    So I am guessing that a sans serif didone would be one of those.

  body: "This is because the classification doesn\u2019t consider this element. A
    sans with high contrast between thin and thick could be a geometric, like my Noir.
    Or it could be a humanist like Optima. Or a grotesque, like Giorgio. *\r\n\r\nEven
    in a serif, the contrast isn\u2019t really that big a part of the classification.
    It\u2019s more about the shift in skeletal form and writing tool, and this again
    plays out in the rythm and contrast and the details.\r\n\r\n* Of course, very
    few faces are spot on. Many geometric designs incorporate grotesque or humanist
    traits, for example."

  body: Contrast is just one characteristic of a typeface. Didones have high contrast,
    but by most definitions they also have a specific type of unbracketed serif. So,
    too, would a sans with high contrast have other traits. It could be "<a href="http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/linotype/optima_std_complete_pack/?affid=99346">high
    contrast humanist sans</a>" or "<a href="http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/urw/britannic/?refby=typographica">high
    contrast Grotesque</a>". They are also sometimes called "stressed sans".

  body: Thanks for the comments. Although "Stressed Sans" and "high contrast Grotesque"
    are correct, they aren't very marketable as font names. ala XYZFont Stressed Sans,
    etc.

  body: I didn't know you were seeking a name for your typeface. Frode's right. Don't
    force it.
