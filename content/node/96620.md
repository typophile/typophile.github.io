body: "Hello! I have a somewhat technical font question and I was told this website
  would be a good place to ask. I've just begun to work with my university's student
  run TV station.\r\n\r\nI got an email from the graphics team leader with a <em>supposedly</em>
  all-encompassing list of the fonts available on the titling machine ( this list
  provided below). I noticed quickly that most of these are foreign fonts- arabic,
  thai, han, hebrew, etc. Only a few were roman character fonts. I responded telling
  her that most of those fonts aren't actually fit for our use, and was surprised
  at the discussion over which fonts people like more, Aharoni  or David.\r\n\r\nIt
  seems to me that typing English sentences under one of these fonts will result in
  the use of a generic font, since trying that out in many of these got me thin, non-smoothed,
  ugly fonts. I was confused though, by the fact that they all did look slightly different,
  and that the Hebrew fonts, in word, didn't work (trying to format normal text as
  Arabic just reverted back to the default Word font).\r\n\r\nCould someone explain
  exactly whether or not these fonts contain English character sets, and whether or
  not they're actually improper to use for English writing? I tried to do some research
  of my own but didn't find anything besides endless websites advertising foreign
  font downloads without explanation of their inner-workings.\r\n\r\nThis is the list:\r\nCordia
  New, Cordia UPC, DilleniaUPC, Dotum, Dotum Che, EucrosiaUPC, FressiaUPC, Gulim,
  Gulim Che, Gungsuh, GungsuhChe, IrisUPC, JasmineUPC, KodchiangUPC, LilyUPC, MS Gothic,
  MS Mincho, MS PGothic, MS PMincho, MS UI Gothic, Microsoft Sans Serif, MingLiU,
  NSimSun, P Ming Liu, SimHei, SimSun, Simplified arabic, Simplified Arabic Fixed,
  Tahoma, Traditional Arabic, Verdana"

    Except for \"official\" ones (like the ones that come with Windows) which are
    however usually very generic, hence do not match the non-Latin in style (and are
    rarely highly usable just for Latin anyway).\r\n\r\nIt sounds like you need some
    real (and non-OS) fonts. But do you do a fair amount of non-Latin as well?\r\n\r\nBTW
    make sure laymen don't get to choose which fonts to use - that's what designers
    are for.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "Hebrew is much easier than Arabic in the non-Latin group. Matching Hebrew
    to Latin is much easier than Arabic. But Arabic is not impossible hrant can you
    post or point to some examples.\r\n\r\nThere is a forum discussion already on
    how to best match a Latin design, like those that you mention, to Hebrew. See
    baruchgorkin.com for examples.\r\n\r\nI started doing this at Font World in the
    early nineties. It is much easier to create a Hebrew font design from scratch
    that matches a Latin font design that to create a Latin font design from scratch
    that matches a Hebrew font design. "
