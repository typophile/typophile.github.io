body: Is there a list anywhere on this site (typowiki?) of which active typophiles
  are also type designers - and their web sites? It would be good to know both as
  a reference point and in order to patronize their sites and buy their fonts.

  body: "Thanks Paul. Yeah, I went to the Designers page of the Wiki but there was
    no distinction btw typophiles and, say, Herb Lubalin. I don't know anything about
    Wiki but if I find a free minute maybe I'll try to set this up. I'm assuming I
    (or someone else) could add to it as we go along. \r\n\r\nI've also seen Magnus
    Rakeng here, and (if I'm not mistaken) Jonathan Hoefler. And I know Dav(id) Hubner
    has designed some fonts.\r\n\r\nMy problem is I'm completely hopeless at the html
    as anybody who's seen my lazy ID posts would know. "

    Do we just include regulars like Mark, or do we include everyone who's ever posted
    even if only once or twice? do we only list prolific type designers (like i did
    above) or do we include the dabblers?"

  body: "I originated this post following a very nice email exchange with Stefan Hattenbach
    during which I realized I had no idea he had designed some beautiful fonts. I
    guess my motivation was for my own information - to know who among the people
    who frequent this site are actually type designers and what they've done. I'm
    a graphic designer and do buy fonts for jobs and would like to patronize Typophiles
    when appropriate. This is a 'community' after all, and reading another thread
    (http://typophile.com/node/19846) in which Rory expresses frustration trying to
    communicate with foundries it occurred to me he might find a more supportive group
    here - and perhaps end up buying a font. \r\n\r\nIt also gives some perspective
    on their contributions to the threads. I think the wiki when complete might stimulate
    some sales - at least from me.\r\n\r\nBut that said, I don't think the criteria
    need to be too rigid. Let's hope nobody dies any time soon..."
