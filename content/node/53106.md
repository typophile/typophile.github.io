body: "hey people.\r\ni made a small movie clip,\r\ncalling for a moment of silence,
  \r\ndedicated to the dual casualties of the \r\ncurrent war between israel and palestine.\r\n\r\ni
  created the calligraphy based on the \"wilhelm klingspor gotisch\" font, \r\nwith
  my own hebrewed version to it, adding slight hebrew serifs called \"Okatsim\". \r\ni
  used a red calligraphy ink (\"Winsor & Newton\") on a smooth surface paper (although
  the movie has low quality, so the nuances are lost).\r\n\r\ni would be glad to show
  better resolution scans of the calligraphy if you want to.\r\n\r\nlink: \t<b><a

  body: "Very touching, and well done. \r\n\r\nI don't know how Israel could tolerate
    being bombed, but I am very fearful that nothing good will come out of this war.
    I hope I'm wrong. "

  body: "Fabulous calligraphy (I particularly like \"sorroW\")\r\nAnd brave of you
    to speak out for non-violence.\r\n\r\nI don't like blackletter. If there is one
    adjective to describe it, I would say \"oppressive\".\r\nBut for your purpose,
    it is certainly engaging."
