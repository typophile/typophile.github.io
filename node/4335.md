  body: How about having someone &#40;me, for example&#41; make an image in whatever
    size you need and send it to you in PDF ? I have DeVinne, but I do not trade fonts,
    as licenses don&#39;t allow that. You can e-mail me if you are interested, and
    for this one time I will not charge you for this service.

  body: Thanks Mike <BR> <BR>I went ahead and spent the $20 on the font.  I&#39;ll
    NEVER use it again... personally I don&#39;t like it but it was a necessary expense.
    <BR> <BR>I know better than to ask but it kills me to spend the $$ for 5 letters
    <BR> <BR>Thanks again........ <BR> <BR>Becca

  body: Ah, was I too slow in replying to your post? I have already set up the letters
    in 240 pt type and saved it as PDF.  No matter. <BR> <BR>However, you really did
    the right thing, and it&#39;s a classic typeface.
