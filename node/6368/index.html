  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">So the other day I bought this monolithic pine chest with a 3x3 arrangement of hefty drawers for $10, sanded off the [disgustingly thick] varnish and stain (man, was that a chore, even with a belt sander), and now I have a blank canvas so to speak. I've bought a nice reddish wood stain (and a matte varnish) for it, but I'd like to do something more than just restain it all one color. But I don't want to make it a freaky piece that can only be appreciated by a&hellip; freak. Any ideas? FYI, the dimensions in feet are about 3H x 6W x 2D, and it has a nice paneled top (like old wooden floors had). It was built on June 16, 1978, which is two days before I turned 10. <BR> <BR>hhp</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Hrant, straining pine nicely actually has pretty demanding preparation.  <BR> <BR>If you just slap the stain on it will be splotchy and have an unnatural looking 'zebra' effect as well. Really quite ugly and very disappointing. To get a nice result you need to hand sand down with progressively finer sand paper, to avoid the splotchiness. Then you need to first put on a pre-treatment - do they call it 'conditioner' - that soaks in an prevents the stain from being too different on the summer and winter wood and getting the zebra effect. Then when you stain it will get a lovely natural look with the glow of the deeper color. <BR> <BR>Get a book on it for the details. <BR> <BR>This is enough bother and the result lovely enough that you may not want to do more.</div>

For example I didn't like Alias's Sydney - she was always &quot;oh, poor me&quot;. And Xena was a little bit too dumb. But Nikita was special - and the &quot;bad&quot; women in that series always ruled. I like Buffy too, although I prefer Kristy Swanson in the original movie - Gellar is a bit too homey.

		<div class="commentbody">Hey Hrant, I remember I used to take a cinder block and roll it all arount the piece of furniture to it give scratches and dents for character. Then after staining and applying the finish I would rub black bee's wax with a cloth all-over, this would fill in all the &quot;inperfections&quot; with the wax and make it look aged. Than after a while just buff the surface so it will get an nice sheen. I was also told shoe polish is a good substitute. <BR> <BR>Sometimes I like to use crackling medium on furniture. Once dry, you can apply black wax to fill in the gaps then wipe the excess off with a clean rag. <BR> <BR>IM</div>

		<div class="commentbody">You can always paint over it, as long as you use the compatible paint - oil or water based, as the case may be. I don't remember about oil vs. water based stains. The main thing is that the varnish will have to be compatible with the undercoat. The conditioner thing (if I remember the name right) is specifically for pine. As it is a soft wood, pine really sponges up the stain, which is why it is tricky to stain. The conditioner pre-soaks it somewhat, so you don't get such a stark contrast.  <BR> <BR>If you do decide to go the stain route, try the process first on a raw wood pine board, so you will have an idea about the result, and whether you like it. Once you stain if you don't like it you can only paint it over or resand. The staining and varnishing is really simple - the headache is preparation   <BR> <BR>I took the trouble to look into this stuff when I stained some window frames and a door, as I knew I'd have to live with it for a long time. Doing it right really did make a huge difference. Now when I see pine stained wrong -blotchy, streaked - it screams out at me.</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><i>Do I use some kind of watery glue?</i> <BR> <BR>Never having done decoupage, I'm no expert. But for gluing paper, I always recommend YES! glue. Good stuff that doesn't wrinkle paper like Elmer's typically does. <BR> <BR><i>If I want to apply a translucent color on top, do I just use watered-down [water-based] paint?</i> <BR> <BR>I wouldn't water it down. In my art school hay-days, I used to make my own acrylic paint with Rhoplex AC33 acrylic emulsion. You could add a small amount of store-bought acrylic paint into a base of AC33 for a translucent color. Or you can add raw pigment into AC33. <BR> <BR>This sort of thing can be done with matte medium or whatever, but I found AC33 to be a much better solution. <BR> <BR><i>So I tried the stain on part of it, and it came out as complete mierda &hellip; I don't want to bother with a conditioner</i> <BR> <BR>Have you ever used sanding sealer? With some [softer] woods, it can help to give you a more even finish. This may be akin to what William refers to as a conditioner.  <BR> <BR>A side note: there are 2 additives that improve the brushability of paint. Floetrol for water-based (latex) and Penetrol for oil-based. I've never used them in anything other than house-painting, but they may improve your surface somewhat. In house-painting they make a rolled surface looked professionally sprayed, and a brushed surfaced look rolled. They may well make a finger-painted surface looked brushed, but I've never tried.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">William, I thought you said you weren't sure about the conditioner business? Anyway, I went to the store again and saw the conditioner/primer/sanding_sealer/whatever, and it sounds like it would help a lot. But the guy there said I should try something easier first*: stain <i>gel</i>. Apparently it's something that sits on the surface more than being absorbed a lot, so the guy thought it's worth a shot. Anyway, I tried it a short while ago, and it certainly looks better than the regular stain I tried before, but I don't know if it's good enough. The conditioner might need to be called in after all. This is such a pain - it's making me nostalgic for the simple pleasures of power sanding&hellip; <BR> <BR>* Because I don't think the conditioner would take &quot;two minutes&quot;, William. <BR> <BR>BTW, Nathan just gave me an idea: <BR>If I take like a reddish-brown paint, dilute it down and just paint that on, wouldn't it give color to the wood while still letting the grain show through? Some sort of faux stain thing? Maybe that's what that gel stuff is doing&hellip; <BR> <BR>One other thing: it would be really good if somebody found a typographic angle to this woodshop stuff - I feel pretty guilty!  :-/ <BR> <BR>hhp</div>

I just wasn't certain about the name - but my memory was correct. And yes, the pre-stain conditioner just takes minutes, because it just soaks in and that's it. There's no finess required. All the sanding takes time and care, but not this. The staining doesn't take that much time either. The sanding and then the final finishing take the time - if you want to do a classic type of finish.</div>

That said however, I'm not sure I'd try this: <BR> <BR><i>If I take like a reddish-brown paint, dilute it down and just paint that on</i> <BR> <BR>I'm pretty sure that the pigments in stain are different than the pigments in paint &ndash; perhaps more importantly, I believe the suspension of the pigments in solution is of a different nature. And it collects in the grain of the wood quite differently. Stain brings out the wood grain,while paint obscures it. <BR> <BR>That said, if you want to use paint, make sure you use <i>transparent</i> red.
