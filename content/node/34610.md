    \"Hmmm\" was as brilliant as I could come up with at the moment :-)\r\n\r\nChrisL"

    way to save the entire encoding, so including the new, grey glpyhs?\r\n\r\nPieter"

  body: If you switch the Font Window to Glyph mode, you should be able to save the
    whole set as an encoding, but that presumes that the glyph order in the font corresponds
    to the imported character set. I think it should, but if not you might need to
    drag the glyphs around in glyph mode to get them in the order you want.

  body: Yes. It used to be called Glyph mode in earlier versions of FontLab, and is
    stuck in my brain as that. This mode exposes the raw Glyph Index order of the
    font, i.e. the actual order in which the glyphs are stored, independent of encoding.
