body: "A Wiki idea - please comment\r\n\r\nI was thinking that it might be a good
  idea to add a section to the Typophile wiki - probably under 'how-to' that could
  include hints and advice about common mistakes sorted by by Unicode number. \r\n\r\nI
  should also note this doesn't have to exist here. For instance 'Decode Unicode'
  has a Wiki ability to take comments. But there are not too many comments. So ...
  maybe it wold be good to have it 'locally' as it were. \r\n\r\nI thought of this
  while using these two sites to get a grip on some of the Unicode glyphs that were
  novel to me and thinking - it would be great if there was some context for use and
  some hints like Adam Twardoch's about the Ogonek for this...\r\n\r\nHere are some
  links and an example glyph\r\n\r\nhttp://www.decodeunicode.org\r\nhttp://www.decodeunicode.org/u+00c1\r\n\r\nhttp://www.fileformat.info/info/unicode/\r\nhttp://www.fileformat.info/info/unicode/char/00c1/fontsupport.htm\r\n\r\nAnyway
  - what do you think? Would you use it? Would you comment?\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: 'eben, i''ve started a category of [[characters]], maybe this could fall there?
    it might be easier to list some common characters by name and then have unicode
    redirects to their respective pages? '

  body: "I thought I might be reinventing the wheel... That's really great. \r\n\r\nI
    like the idea of redirects pretty well but I think we should list the unicode
    after the name on the page 'redirected to' to reduce confusion. Also, it is worth
    noting that not all Unicode glyphs have names. 2588 does, it's 'Block', but 256C
    does not. \r\n\r\nSo to reiterate what we are saying is that we would have two
    pages, and the one which is just the unicode redirects for each glyph we list
    - unless there is no name. Yes?\r\n\r\nTo be honest I would feel better about
    this if I had a chat with Christian.\r\n\r\nAlso, one of things that I would ideally
    like to see is advice listed directly on the page - eg not just a link to a <strong>Discussion</strong>.\r\n\r\nThat's
    asking a lot I know. \r\n\r\nAnd I am mindful of the power source/context. So
    I think if we do list advice on the page we should sign it. Or summarize and then
    sign & give attribution. Or if we quote directly we should get permission first.\r\n\r\nWhat
    do you think?"

  body: with something so in depth, i think i might actually rather be able to find
    it on the decode unicode wiki, but that's just me.

  body: Maybe we should concentrate out efforts there - I had thought about that too.
    It is more tailor made to the task. I don't expect that every glyph will get a
    comment but what thought was - if there was a place for it to go then Typophile
    Mods might put content there.  Let's see what the others say.
