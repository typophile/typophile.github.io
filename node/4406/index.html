		<div class="commentbody">Magnus <BR> <BR>Well, should you not be getting &quot;a whole long list of file&quot;? Those four as opposed to the normal two with a Mac (plus the optional AFM)? <BR> <BR>You do have to be a bit careful with batch conversion, especially if you are converting from format to format rather than just platform to platform. Font &quot;families&quot; are treated a bit differently in the differing formats/platforms and can get botched if generated within the orginal folder. PC fonts have a number restriction (as I recall, four). I usually generate from PCTT to Mac PS1 and I will generally configure PCTT multiple fonts separately, rather than run them in batch mode, because of this problem. Doubt this makes much sense. <BR> <BR>If you have the software program Font Doctor, that can often help you resolve conflicts. <BR> <BR>Gerald</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Thanks, Gerald but as you said yourself. It doesn't make too much sense to me. <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif" ALT=":-&#41;" BORDER=0> A little maybe. <BR> <BR>Should I convert each weight separately? <BR>I don't know. But I have found that if I put the all the files into the windows/fonts folder instead of using ATM, it actually works. ?!?!?!?! Crazy. If it was just one fontfamily that did this I guess I could live with it but I see it happening to others as well. It's a real drag with that windows/font folder. It very easily becomes a huge mess of font files.  <BR> <BR>BTW:  <BR>Gerald&gt;&gt;&gt; &quot;Well, should you not be getting &quot;a whole long list of file&quot;? Those four as opposed to the normal two with a Mac (plus the optional AFM)?&quot; <BR> <BR>Yes I know. For instance: I have 1 font I convert it, I get 4 files. Yup that's right. <BR> <BR>The font I'm trying to convert is Berthold Akzidenz Grotesk and as you probably know it has a lot of weights. And that's 4 files for each weight in windows. The problem is that ATM doesn't &quot;recognize&quot; all of these files as being fonts or pehaps more likely it assumes that a lot of them are the same. Because it only shows four weights. This has been bugging me for quite some time now. Frustrating. <BR> <BR>I will try and see what this Font Doctor is about  if I can get my hands on a demo or something. <BR> <BR>thanks <BR> <BR>Magnus</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Magnus <BR> <BR>A bit clearer to me now. Yes, you are correct regarding the weights. A problem is that the name of either the printer font or screen font could be replicated in the conversion process and hence deleted. Or it is assigning the same name. I think you are only allowed the regular, italic, bold, bold italic unless you create separate fonts/folders.  <BR> <BR>If you are trying to generate the various weights you many need to rename the primary font, or some of the weights, to avoid this. Or this could be a FOND ID problem. One of the great things about FontDoctor (maybe the only really great thing) is that it will change the ID for you and assign unique numbers. Your system may be recognizing a duplicated ID number, and consequently ignoring the second or third instance of it. <BR> <BR>I'm not a PC guy (well, not since about 1990) so I'm just making some assumptions here. <BR> <BR>Gerald</div>
