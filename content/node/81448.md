  I am wondering if anyone knows/can tell if it is an actual typeface or if it a modified
  version of one. If you think it is a modified one, I'd love to hear what you think
  is similar!\r\n\r\nThanks"

  body: "I think that this is custom, as  is almost every pro sports  logo. The reason
    is simple -- marketing. If any of us could duplicate it how could they sell us
    all those branded products? You will notice there is usually some wording that
    claims the logos are property of the league and/or the team involved.\r\n\r\n-
