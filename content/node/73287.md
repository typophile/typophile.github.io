  of amazing logo sketches. Of course, there's finished logos too, but it's the sketches
  that are most memorable. The book is packed with freehand scripts.\r\n\r\nBut I
  can't remember the name of the book or, more importantly, the designer. Help!\r\n\r\nI
  know the guy lives in the Los Angeles area because a friend of mine actually met
  him. And yet I can't remember his name.\r\n\r\nI'm sure someone here knows who this
  is. He's gotta be top 5 logo designer.\r\n"
