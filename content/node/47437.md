  body: I completely agree.  Of course, I have to reproduce it, and no one has the
    vector file.  And what's up with that kerning?  The C has eaten the h!

  body: "Lex,\r\n\r\nOnce you mentioned it, ITC Tiffany made perfect sense.  After
    doing some digging, I've discovered that swash alternates once existed, but I
    dont think they were ever digitized.\r\n\r\n:(\r\n\r\nGiven that this logo dates
    from the seventies, I think I'm out of luck.  Perhaps I can convince them to update
    the logo sans swashes."
