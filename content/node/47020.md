  lot of you other designers, they're complete crap.\r\n\r\nSo, I ask of you, in designing
  a type specimen, what is the minimum necessary information, what are helpful options
  to include, and how does one make such a pamphlet truly artful?"

  body: "I'm starting on this of type i still didnt make a good font but i think there
    are two things very important.\r\nOne: knowing the letters\r\nYou should know
    how a letter acts, know what is the \"lines\" of the letter, like a lady! How
    is the breast of the letter B ? :P why don't you select a good font for you and
    try to draw it? For that you should read some books about how it started and why
    are the serif the way they are. I would recommend you a serif font, i started
    there as i'm telling you and i think i developed myself a lot.\r\n\r\nTwo: Books,
    i love you\r\nTry to get some books, some really good books with nice fonts. The
    love for the books will make you dissecate each letter and learn something about
    it.\r\n\r\nYou can buy a lot of books, even about type there are a lot of books.
    For example, I'm asking on another node for calligraphy books.\r\nThat's what
    i think, as i said, i'm still a newbie.\r\n\r\nJoel Santos // youremin\r\nsound
