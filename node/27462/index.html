		<div class="commentbody">Analog or digital originated, I still like Industria. It may be dated now for its overuse during the early 1990s. Still an interesting typeface nonetheless.

Being a movie tech-head nut, a number of us movie going techie fans are debating the whole 35mm film versus HDTV quality 2000 pixel wide "digital" projection subject. The mention of Industria and its rather ironic analog beginnings make me think of that sort of thing.

Some analog methods are still far superior to their digital counterparts. When it comes to movies, IMAX and its 15-perf 70mm analog film format is still the high water mark for anything related to motion. Digital video is crap next to it. Digital does not always equal perfect. I think the term "digital" is a pretty useless term for marketing anymore anyway.

To this day many people designing type and type-oriented graphics often start with "analog" tools. A brush dipped in India ink. A pencil. A ballpoint pen. Mashing your paint stained fingers on some paper. Scan the results and then digitize them with the pen tool in Photoshop or do some other stuff in Illustrator, Freehand or CorelDRAW. Either way, it is quite a bit easier to draw for real in analog than it is to draw "digitally" using a brick and string (mouse) or something slightly easier (like a Wacom tablet).

"I need your little help."

www.researchstudios.com is his web home you should write him there with a set of questions and maybe he'll be able to answer. There are three or four books he's published, and probably more by others. I don't think you'll see any rare artwork here though. and telling you whatever I know about him would be a mistake ;)

All the best.</div>

I should point out that I don't know Neville Brody personally, and my take on the circumstances of Industria's design are, shall we say, critical insight along the lines of "yes I was there too, and you know what they say, and some of it was true", as Joe Strummer put it.

Like Paul Rand, or for that matter anyone who gets the opportunity, Brody has controlled his own myth by the books he's published about his work. And why not, rather then have someone else get it all wrong? But of course, all rationalization of creative work is after the fact, so if you're studying someone's work, it's probably best to take what they say about themselves with a grain of salt, and form your opinions from a variety of sources. Best is to study the original artefacts themselves. Send me your address and I'll mail you a Face.</div>
