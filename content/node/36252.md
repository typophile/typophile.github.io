  logo is. Perhaps while you're at it, you could help me out with the Kraft logo itself?
  Cheers.\r\n\r\n[[http://www.brandsoftheworld.com/brands/0014/3673/brand.gif]]"

  body: The "Philadelphia" remind me of ITC Franklin Gothic Demi Extra Compressed.
    But if I remember right, the P and the A are different.

  body: "My vote, if I were trying to replicate it, would be Font Bureau's <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/fontbureau/agenda/\">Agenda
    Bold Ultra Condensed</a>, but these are such 'neutral' letters that I suspect
    many sans serif families could work. The counter on the P is about the only earmark
    of note in this lettering. If you get close, and have the right color blue, it
    would be hard to tell the difference.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
