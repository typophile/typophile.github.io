    Although a mountain is clich\xE9 for climbing I wonder what other images might
    be more evocative and keep some of the mystery of the legend whole. Tracks are
    also a bit clich\xE9 but I wonder about other visual elements.\r\n\r\nI also wonder
    about Nepalese flavor, as you see in the Sherpa brand.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.sherpaadventuregear.com/"

    a different typeface, its appropriate, but is used a lot and theres more then
    one freeware lookalikes. Perhaps try drawing a stylized backpack for the border,
    you might need to draw the top of the yetis shoulders, but I think that would
    work good.\r\n\r\nJeo."

  body: "Jupiterboy \r\n\r\nI agree that the approach might be quiet direct, but i
    wanted to give kinda a hardcore fun side to the climbing, rather then an old style
    serious one. All the climbing brands I have looked are mainly badly done or too
    serious, unlike skate boarding and snowboarding brands who have a really fun universe
    around them.  For the Nepalese flavor, its a climbing group in Belgium... and
    I don't think they even know that the yeti is a legend from Nepal. I will keep
    your advice in mind and try to think about maybe a softer visual element.\r\n\r\nThank
    you so much for comment.\r\n\r\nJeo324\r\nI'm definitely going to try out what
    you said. The backpack idea is really great. Thanks !"

    removing those from my choice. Thanks\r\n\r\n@jupiterboy:  I agree (if i understood
    correctly) that there might be too much detail on the yeti for a logo.. but when
    i put it in small the details are less seen but its still understood that its
    a yeti (i think).  I did think about what it would look like on clothes and in
    packaging and thats why i went in this direction too, i thought i might be able
    to have more fun with it .. Skate style but i might be wrong. Thanks again for
    your advice and your little trial :) \r\n\r\n@evanbron: Hey thanks for your comment
    number three might be the right way to go. And for the borders I'm trying out
    some things at the moment. I'll post them later it would be great if you could
    let me know what you think about them once they are up! \r\n\r\n@altaira:  This
    is a project for my final year jury. So its not actually going to be done unless
    the company wants to buy it off me. The group that created this brand are 4 quite
    young flemish guys that are all about the outdoor. They actually kinda look like
    the yeti :) same attitude at least. Also with the \"mean\" yeti I'm trying to
    pass the idea of toughness. The group do events as well... like climbing the Mont
    Blanc.. its not for anybody. The age group is between 17 till late 30's and older
    if your still fit enough.  \r\nI tired a few things with a yeti foot. But it was
    even more literal that doing a yeti... and gave off less attitude.  The foot prints
    from Tintin are to cartoon like I find, but I am working on a yeti version more
    like the yeti in that comic. Thanks for the comments! \r\n\r\n\r\n"

    too serious or evil looking. Get some "fun" mixed with "rugged" and "durable"
    in there! The folks running the company might be serious but you got to appeal
    to the market! And I think an angry looking hairy hominid-like creature logo just
    doesn''t do that. Maybe a bit more Pixar-like "yeti" - a fun guy who knows how
    to survive alone on the wintery slopes of the Himalayas. '

  body: "One problem with rendering a Yeti is that no one has seen one, or at least
    the general publics\u2019 impression is the backside of a lumbering ape creature.
    What you have has an infant like proportion (baby head), like a young orangutan
    that has an angry or maybe pouting expression.\r\n\r\nThere is also the issue
    of what is required to survive at high altitudes, which isn\u2019t so much toughness
    or anger as good decision making skills under extreme stress. I still believe
    there is a self-reliance angle that is being missed.\r\n\r\nMost productive logo
    crit threads start out with four or five distinct ideas. You have versions of
    the same idea with minor changes."

    this isn't an illustration forum, it's a type forum, so let's talk about type.
    The cameo around the Yeti dictates a centered layout, but when the type is mechanically
    centered, <strong>OUTDOOR</strong> looks wrong because of the shape of the. <strong>Y</strong>,
    so you ended up moving <strong>OUTDOOR</strong> to the right.\r\nMaybe you could
    replace the cameo with a border around the whole logo? \r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/YETI_5598.jpg]\r\nThe

    \ The bouldering scene (one form of climbing) leans towards the skate style, and
    sport climbing is getting there, traditional climbing is a little more/over serious.
    \ I guess I am trying to say that there are 3 major divisions in climbing and
    they are each marketed very differently.  Ive also noticed a difference between
    companies that make gear (hardware) and companies that make colthes (software).\r\n\r\nI
