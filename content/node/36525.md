body: "I've searched high and low for this font that appeared on the AA Publications
  book \"Morphogenesis of Flux Structure\" book by Mutsuro Sasaki.\r\n\r\nIt's similar
  to Chunkfeeder or United faces, but particularly different \"G\" and \"R.\" It may
  or may not be monospaced.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can see the whole specimen here:\r\nhttp://www.aaschool.info/publications/images/sasaki_book_cover.jpg\r\n\r\nBut
  here's a snippet of it:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/sasaki_book_cover_4925.jpg]\r\n\r\nAny
  ideas?\r\n\r\nThanks in advance."

  body: It's called <a href="http://aalog.net/?p=2302">CAD Beta</a>. I couldn't find
    it anywhere else so it's probably a custom design for the AA.
