body: "Hello,\r\n\r\nIs there a limit for lookup numbers in a font?\r\nI am currently
  working on an Arabic Font in MS VOLT. My font consists of more than 4000 glyphs.
  Now a days I am working on the kerning of pairs. The number of Lookups in my font
  project has reached to 275 and now when I add another Lookup to this project then
  the compilation fails in VOLT. What could be its reason? The options to Use extension
  lookups and to Use Pair Position Format 2 are turned on in the VOLT.\r\n\r\nIf I
  add new kerning pairs to the present lookups even then the compilation fails. Till
  yet I have made a very large number of kerning pairs but as compared to the remaining
  pairs it is very little (I think more than three quarters of kerning is still remaining
  and also I have to add quite a number of lookups to finish the project. So what
  should I do to solve the issue?\r\n\r\n"

  body: Try rearranging the lookup order. Perhaps try placing all the kern lookups
    at the beginning of the GPOS.

  body: "The problem is solved as I worked out to refine the complete MS VOLT project
    of my font and removed some positioning data from the lookups. \r\n\r\nIt appears
    that there is no limit for lookup numbers as there are more than 425 lookups in
    my font at present and VOLT is compiling it correctly but certainly there is a
    limit for positioning data in MS VOLT and when this limit is reached then the
    compilation starts failing in MS VOLT. "

  body: We have fonts that contain many hundreds of GPOS Lookups in VOLT and providing
    they are organised properly and 'Extension Lookups' is turned on they compile
    ok.

  body: "That is why I have used the word positioning data, not Positioning lookups.
    These many hundreds of of GPOS lookups may contain small amount of data as compared
    to my font. As the positioning lookups are properly arranged in my font in kern,
    curs, mark, mkmk order and also the Extention lookups is turned on.\r\n\r\nThis
    limit is also mentioned by Sergey Malkin here\r\n\r\n[[http://forum.fontlab.com/archive-old-microsoft-volt-group/lookup-quantity-limit-t6901.0.html]]\r\n\r\n\r\n"
