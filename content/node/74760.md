  body: Looks like a mix of [[http://new.myfonts.com/search/handel/fonts/|Handel Gothic]]
    (/p, /u, /r, /l and /a) and [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/urw/eurostile/|Eurostile]]
    (/e, /t and /c) with some tweakings (/e's bottom left terminal flattened, /a's
    top left terminal shortened, /t's top left horizontal bar removed...).
