  a product label that has to adhere to a BSI standard. I need something quite tall
  yet narrow/condensed. I am currently using Gill sans MT Condensed but would be grateful
  if someone had a better option.\r\n\r\nmany thanks,\r\n\r\nPaul"

    another thread in the forum where the topic was food labelling and the general
    consensus seemed to be the use of Helvetica (prob condensed version).\r\n\r\n\"The
    FDA in no uncertain terms recommends and strongly encourages Helvetica (or Franklin
    Gothic), and uses them in their examples.\"\r\n\r\nhttp://typophile.com/node/12618\r\n\r\nPaul"
