  body: "In the case of Meola Bookman, my opinion is that it took an unattractive
    text face, and actually gave it a useful reason for existing as a fancy display
    face.\r\n\r\nGiving Times Roman the same treatment wouldn't \"destroy\" the typeface,
    because people would still be free to ignore the modifications, and use the original.
    If one wants a decorative face with lots of swashes, and there are places where
    such a thing could be used tastefully, why not start from a good typeface as a
    basis?"

    and reputation of the typeface than it is about the design.\r\n\"This typeface
    is very popular, but not very decorative. Why not add swashes?\"\r\n\r\nMaking
    a new typeface or adding swashes to a lesser known typeface requires more work
    in marketing. I don't think anyone is adding swashes to any typeface to improve
    the design, but rather to ride on the success of its name. Why else would Helvetica
    Flair exist? Certainly not because it's exactly what we were looking for or because
    it has so much potential."

  body: "I would have called it Endowed Iones - that <em>particular</em> swash J variant,
    as far as I'm concerned, is closer to a swash I - and not very good at that either.
    However, I don't have objections to the <em>rest</em> of the font.\r\n\r\nOK,
    the swash G, the swash Q, and the second swash L (for the same reason as the J)
    are not that great either.  But after eliminating or replacing these <em>four</em>
    lousy glyphs, it wouldn't be too bad."

  body: "I agree it's not awful, but definitely not great. But my point is that my
    expectations for the outcome for these practices are very low. I don't consider
    it to be a good practice to attach swashes to typefaces that weren't intended
    to have swashes. If this typeface was intended to have swashes, I think it would
    have been planned for the swashes better. \r\n\r\nBut also, I think the swashes
    itself in this case are often just not well designed. I find the swash on /y to
    be horrible, and I would love to modify the swashes in /a and /e as well. I feel
    the swashes are very much an afterthought, rather than part of the design of the
    typeface."

  body: "The fact remains, whatever its merits or flaws, Endowed Jones never gained
    traction with graphic designers. I don't think I ever saw in actual use. It was
    an attempt to exploit the popularity of Bookman Swash. In that it was not unique.*
    But it flopped in the marketplace, never made it to digital, and only old type
    geeks like me have even heard of it.\r\n\r\n*You might find this old Typophile
    discussion of interest: http://www.typophile.com/node/2833 Unfortunately, most
    of the image links are broken. Or fortunately, depending on your point of view.\r\n\r\nAlso:
    I think the swashes in Endowed Jones look like stretched-out chewing gum. Ugh."
