  body: What kind of pixel font do you mean? An outline font &#40;i.e., PostScript
    or TrueType&#41; that looks like a bitmap font, or an actual bitmap font &#40;like
    the kind that were first used for computer or video game displays, etc.&#41;?

  body: Early CRTs used vector-based character displays. This would be in the 1960s.
    In the 1970s, raster displays were introduced. The characters on these displays
    could be considered the first bitmap fonts, but they were not fonts in the sense
    that we mean now. The patterns for each character were stored permanently in the
    computer memory and would be called something like &#34;resident character set&#34;
    or &#34;character set display map&#34;. The size of the characters on the display
    was also fixed and every character was the same width, so video dispays were typically
    specified by how many characters they could display &#40;e.g., 80 x 25&#41;. These
    early character sets did not have names that I know of. <BR> <BR>The idea of a
    &#34;bitmap font&#34; &#40;as opposed to a resident character set&#41; as a discrete
    system resource of interchangeable sizes and styles for a computer display, probably
    started at Xerox PARC in the 1970s. I don&#39;t know what they called them, but
    they generally appear to be modeled on Helvetica, Times, and Courier. &#40;This
    is not too surprising since the founders of Adobe, who chose these same fonts
    as the basic PostScript set, came from Xerox PARC.&#41;
