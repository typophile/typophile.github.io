  I have no idea where to find places that still make letterpress printing.\r\n\r\nhelp?\r\n\r\nThanks

    Santa Maria del Mar.\r\nI think it's calle D'Espaseria.\r\n(http://www.bcn.cat/cgi-guia/guiamap4/cgi-guia/?actives=&scl=6&cnt=31726.84%2C81830.97&plt=31726.84%2C81830.97&plant=capes4c&txt1=&txt2=C.+d%27Espaseria%2C+10&idioma=0&grayscl=0&escala.x=360&escala.y=21)\r\n\r\nThere's
    another up in Gracia that I think may do more specialized stuff.\r\nCalle Doctor
    Rizal.\r\n(http://www.bcn.cat/cgi-guia/guiamap4/cgi-guia/?actives=&scl=5&cnt=29538.50%2C83440.10&plt=29538.50%2C83440.10&plant=capes4c&txt1=&txt2=C.+del+Doctor+Rizal%2C+12&idioma=0&grayscl=0&escala.x=300&escala.y=25)\r\n\r\nI
    haven't yet have the opportunity to try either, so I can't recommend.\r\n\r\nHope
    this helps,\r\nFredrik\r\n"

  body: "\"What makes you think so?\"\r\n\r\nI think they wouldn't do that. Why get
    rid of good letterpress machines. I don't know how letterpress is used over there,
    but there are still semi retired individuals still printing business hand set
    cards, or invites. I worked in a little letterpress shop over there for about
    a year or so, and I interviewed with local printers and actually was given to
    see the presses, and I visited a lot of them. Anyway, if you want to print letterpress,
    just tell the printer you want it that way. I guess you will find letterpress
    (tipografia)  printing if you ask for.\r\n\r\nGeorg gave you good info about Bauer
    in Barcelona. Actually they still have for sale some lead type with antique finished
    wood boxes.\r\n-\r\n\r\n\"AGL, thing is... almost every place has a letterpress
    machine, but they only use them for engravings or for numerations, they don\u2019t

    to print letterpress, just tell the printer you want it that way. I guess you
    will find letterpress (tipografia)  printing if you ask for. Just tell the printer,
    I want it 'tipogr\xE1fico', you give them some negatives, they make the plates
    (which these days are fotopolymer).\r\nI actually i don't know for sure if there
    is actually lots of letterpress shops over there, but you can just walk and find
    a printshop, go in and ask. Most printers like the refer others and guide you
    on finding one.\r\nHope this help. Thanks."

    you'll get in Barcelona ;)\r\n\r\nAbout the print shops I mentioned. The one in
    Borne (as far as I have seen) makes business cards and smaller jobs like that.
    Both type and engraving.\r\nIn the one in Gracia, I was shown some very beautiful
    and meticulous work. And they have _a lot_ of type there.\r\n\r\nGood luck. If
    you get something done, I'd be interested in seeing the result.\r\n\r\nF."

    had already contacted Bauer, and it was a big finding for me to know that with
    them there is even the possibility to forge our own set of types. For now I have
    some places to visit, lets see if we can make this project come to life. Hope
    so :) and be sure I'll post the result.\r\n\r\nPS: I believe you Fredrik, in fact
