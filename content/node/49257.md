  of something like the type used in the ttitle of the new Quantum of Solace bond
  film stuff...\r\n\r\nit's pointy like Futura or Century, but retains its points
  in heavy weights, and has distinctive details like a low crossbar on the A and vertical
  stems on the M...  the Q's a bit nice as well...\r\n\r\nif anyone has the answer,
  i'd be very grateful!"
