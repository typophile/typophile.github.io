  body: How many pixels high are you working? You could use the TM from a system font,
    say Lucida Grande or Trebuchet. If it's small enough the design won't matter much
    on screen.

  body: Unfortunately when you embed a font in flash you are already modifying, translating,
    reverse engineering, decompiling, disassembling and altering the software. The
    same is true when you convert curves to outlines. I've never liked this kind of
    EULA.

  body: "This kind of EULA should get a public flogging.\r\nFLOG, FLOG, FLOG.\r\n\r\nHere's
    an idea, if you really want to respect the EULA: do a convert-to-oulines on the
    TM in illustrator and put the result in a new dummy font with just that glyph
    in it, enlarged. If they say a convert-to-outlines is illegal, then you know to
    really ignore them.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: FontFont's EULA didn't always contain this clause, so the answer may depend
    on when you licensed the font. Do you have a record of the EULA that you agreed
    to?

  body: "Thanks for all your responses.  I'm not the one who bought the font, so I
    don't have a copy of EULA.\r\n\r\nWith dynamic text fields in Flash, you can only
    specify one font and one size per text string.  That's why those workarounds you
    mentioned won't work.\r\n\r\nI can't believe it violates the license to embed
    the font into Flash...?  That's crazy, for what are we supposed to use these fonts?
    \ And to convert it to outlines violates it as well..?  It sounds like they make
    everything against the rules to cover themselves.\r\n\r\n"

    Some EULAs, when read carefully,\r\nseem to imply that, but it's hard to imagine
