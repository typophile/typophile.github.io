  feature when anyone answered back\r\nwhile I was still looking. Will answers show
  up when you log back on?\r\n\r\nAlso what does a red asterisk mean next to a topic?
  I've seen that\r\na couple times."

    not. At the moment I can see it with one subject, that I've read before and not
    with another one.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/forumview.gif]

    don't think so, as there are threads I've never read that don't have the asterisk

  body: "Pattyfab:\r\nDo you recommend Firefox over Safari? If so, why?\r\n\r\nThere
    was some security scare about Safari, so I decided to change. Also, not all websites
    worked with Safari.\r\nI've been told that Safari is faster with things like browsing
    for pictures in picture banks, but I don't think there's much in it. On the negative
    point with the Firefox, occasionally I can't see letters \xE4 and \xF6 on some
    websites. And since they are in Finnish, it's rather annoying.\r\nFirefox remembers,
    when allowed, passwords etc, which I find quite useful in an one-person office."

    it will auto-fill in your name, address, etc.\r\n\r\nI think I'm going to make
    this a question in the General Discussions forum. I've been using Safari since
    it came with the computer, like it fine, and wonder if there's any reason I should
    switch to Firefox."
