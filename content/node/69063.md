  advantage \u2013 to put a dotlessi.sc into a font, that contains small caps? I mean,
  Minion does not contain a Dotlessi. It would be only consequent to double not the
  i.sc only, but also the I."

  body: Arno Pro also contains a dotlessi.sc (with the Unicode as name and an extension).
    When I searched Typophile for dotlessi, I found a comment by Adam Twardoch, that
    the dotlessi should be replaced by the i.sc in the small caps feature. Did I misunderstood
    him, that the dotlessi.sc is useless, if an i.sc is present?

  body: "@ Michel\r\n\r\nOkay. Imagine a font, that contains I, i.sc and i. It also
    contains Idotaccent, idotaccent.sc and idotaccent. But why should it contain additionally
    Dotlessi and dotlessi.sc? (The yellow marked letter is a small dotlessi. I mean
    the capital and small capital versions of that letter. Not letter, but character.
    I am talking about characters.)\r\n\r\nI found Adam\u2019s comment:\r\nhttp://typophile.com/node/29469/168548\r\n\r\nHe
    says: \"Of course \"dotlessi\" should be replaced by \"I.smcp\" as well.\"\r\n\r\nI.smcp
    is i.sc in my example, because that\u2019s the way I name small capitals. "

  body: "@ Arno\r\n\r\nOk, I see. The glyphs dotlessi.sc and i.sc should indeed look
    the same. Now, if an otf file (or a bunch of otf files) is generated by a script
    (and I think that's the way people from Adobe work), maybe it is less trouble
    to handle the .sc feature in a systematic way and have two characters with the
    same glyph. Just a guess..."

  body: "Yes, but then a font, that contains an additional (to the i.sc/I.smcp) dotlessi.sc,
    should also contain an additional (to the I) Dotlessi, shouldn\u2019t it? I mean,
    the scenario could be, that someone types in an i.sc from the glyph panel. In
    Indesign this automatically activates the sc feature, as far as I know. And when
    the user manually deactivates the sc feature, the application replaces i.sc by
    i, but not dotlessi. But the same problem would appear, when the user types in
    the capital I. The I is replaced by the i, but not by the dotlessi, when the user
    converts capital letters to small ones. So, either a font should contain both,
    dotlessi.sc and Dotlessi or none of them. At least this sounds consequent and
    logical to me.\r\n\r\nAnd if a font contains I, Dotlessi, i.sc and dotlessi.sc,
    there is the danger, that the user messes both up, if he selects one of the characters
    from the glyph panel.\r\n\r\nYesterday I removed the dotlessi.sc from a font and
    now I don\u2019t know, if I shall undo that step."

    step and add the character (!) Dotlessi (which is even more than Adobe does).
    But first I would like to here more opinions."

    by \"smcp4\") in the smcp feature, but dotlessi.sc is not present in the c2sc
    feature. It neither is present in any class substituted in the c2sc feature nor
    it is directly listed in a substitution rule of the c2sc feature. This is what
    I had expected, because it would not make sense to substitute I by dotlessi.sc,
    maybe except from Turkish.\r\n\r\nAnd I just see (in the Minion feature file,
    that Adobe provides along with the AFDKO), that Minion contains two different
    sc classes, a small letter sc class and a capital letter sc class, but a.sc is
    the same as A.sc for example. I don\u2019t understand that. Isn\u2019t that totally
    overdone?"

  body: "Arno, \r\n\r\n1. Minion Pro has been revised several times. It's best to
    look at more recent versions, e.g. Minion Pro version 2.0. \r\n\r\n2. We at Fontlab
    Ltd. also think that it's a good idea to duplicate the small cap glyphs, though
    we recommend naming the glyphs \"A.c2sc\" and \"a.smcp\", which makes clear what
    their purpose is. Since PDF applications often need to parsing glyphnames to recreate
    the original text string (when searching or copy-pasting), keeping separate glyphname
    prefixes for glyphs that semantically represent uppercase or lowercase letters
    allows better text accessibility. \r\n\r\n3. Currently, the recommended way to
    deal with Turkish letters is to duplicate \"i\" as \"i.TRK\" and place the substitution
    into the \"locl\" feature: \r\n<code>feature locl { \r\nlanguage TRK;\r\nsub i
    by i.TRK;\r\n} locl;</code>\r\n\r\nThen you have five glyphs for Unicode characters:
    I, Idotaccent, i, i.TRK, dotlessi. And you have five smallcap glyphs: I.c2sc,
    i.smcp and dotlessi.smcp (all identical, without a dot), as well as Idotaccent.c2sc
    and i.TRK.smcp (identical, with a dot). \r\n\r\nIn \"c2sc\", you use the substitutions:
    \r\n<code>feature c2sc { \r\nsub I by I.c2sc;\r\nsub Idotaccent by Idotaccent.smcp;\r\n}
    c2sc;</code>\r\n\r\nIn \"smcp\", you have the substitutions: \r\n<code>feature
    smcp { \r\nsub i by i.smcp;\r\nsub i.TRK by i.TRK.smcp;\r\nsub dotlessi by dotlessi.smcp;\r\n}
    smcp;</code>\r\n\r\nAdam"

  body: "@ Adam\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\nBut seriously, with regard to the suffix I totally
    loose the overview, if dotted letters \"i\" are called i (no suffix), Idotaccent
    (suffix: dotaccent) and i.TRK (suffix: .TRK).\r\n\r\nAnd while I can understand,
    that it is necessarily to have an additional dotted i in the font, I don\u2019t
    understand, why there are Idotaccent.smcp and (!) i.TRK.smcp. Where is the disadvantage
    in the following code?:\r\n\r\nfeature locl {\r\nlanguage TRK;\r\nsub i by <strong>idotaccent</strong>;\r\n}
    locl;\r\n\r\nfeature c2sc {\r\nsub I by <strong>i.smcp</strong>;\r\nsub Idotaccent
    by <strong>i</strong>dotaccent.smcp;\r\n<strong>sub Dotlessi by dotlessi.smcp;
    #*****Additional line (and additional character)!*****</strong>\r\n} c2sc;\r\n\r\nfeature
    smcp {\r\nsub i by i.smcp;\r\nsub <strong>idotaccent by idotaccent.smcp;</strong>\r\nsub
    dotlessi by dotlessi.smcp;\r\n} smcp;\r\n\r\n<strong>Or alternatively this, without
    dotlessi.smcp and Dotlessi:</strong>\r\n\r\nfeature locl {\r\nlanguage TRK;\r\nsub
    i by <strong>idotaccent</strong>;\r\n} locl;\r\n\r\nfeature c2sc {\r\nsub I by
    <strong>i.smcp</strong>;\r\nsub Idotaccent by <strong>i</strong>dotaccent.smcp;\r\n}
    c2sc;\r\n\r\nfeature smcp {\r\nsub i by i.smcp;\r\nsub <strong>idotaccent by idotaccent.smcp;</strong>\r\nsub
    dotlessi by <strong>i.smcp</strong>\r\n} smcp;\r\n\r\nI mean, isn\u2019t Adobe\u2019s
    actual way a half baked thing with regard to the symmetry of dotlessi?\r\n\r\nAnd
    why is there a need for doubling the whole alphabet ([a.smcp-z.smcp] and {!} [A.c2sc-Z.c2sc]),
    if the glyphs are the same?"
