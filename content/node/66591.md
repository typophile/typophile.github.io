  body: "While it is true that anyone can go to blogger and publish a blog, Typophile
    offers the opportunity to infrequently post bloggish content without the regular
    posting that an official blog requires to have any readership at all.\r\n\r\nIf
    you want to create type blog with many posts per week, you may want to establish
    your own site. If you just want to talk about the type related things you are
    working on / thinking about without the intent of starting a discussion thread,
    Typophile blogs might just be your thing.\r\n\r\nLastly, if you don't like the
    blogs here, don't read them. You certainly don't have to read them to participate
    in the forums."

  body: "Hey,\r\n\r\nmaybe this is the right thread to ask some questions about blog
    in general.\r\nMaybe it\u2019s because I am 42 years old ;-) : I have to admit
    that In never completely understood what blog thing is about.\r\nI understand
    that is a kind of personal website frequently updated in the way of lets say a
    personal \u201Enewspaper\u201C.\r\nBut where is the difference to a website?\r\nHow
    is anyone (for example also here in my blog at typophile) guided to get there
    and see/read the things you put in there?\r\nWhat do I have to do to put it into
    life?\r\n\r\nthanks so far\r\nStefan"

  body: "Stefan\r\n\r\nI'm 55, so you are a youngster to me. A blog (from web log)
    is for quick and dirty commenting on ... well, on anything. Many of them are quite
    boring, but some draw readerships in the thousands. John Nack of Adobe is one
    I often visit. (Also I seldom missed Thom Phinney when he was there). \r\n\r\nA
    web page is a bit more work to get something posted. A blog takes the technical
    work out of it, and you only have to worry about content.\r\n\r\nMostly, you gain
    attention to your blog through providing good content, getting some buzz, and
    hopefully some people posting links to it.\r\n\r\nDon"

  body: "OK, then, Christian, explain to me why it\u2019s desirable for a <em>discussion
    forum</em> with an ill-defined ownership structure to host <em>technically limited</em>
    blogs that are hidden deep down in a directory structure.\r\n\r\nIndeed anyone
    can set up a blog. And anyone who wants a blog should do that \u2013 somewhere
    that blogs are meant to be set up, like your own server or an existing hosting
    service. Then at least the rest of the Web will know they\u2019re there and can
    subscribe via RSS, and ownership won\u2019t be at issue. (At the very least, you
    can wade through the endless terms of use of hosting sites, or just host your
    own. Where are the terms of use for blog hosting at Typophile? Found those yet,
    Christian?)"
