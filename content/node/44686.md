  body: Some of the stroke weights seem not right. Also the g and y do not go together.
    Bottom of u not good. This typeface reminds me a little bit of Benguiat. It is
    too strange to use for a lot of text, but is interesting for a small amount. But
    does not really look like display typeface either.
