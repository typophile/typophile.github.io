  body: well sorry guys but i can spell the words... & i am not even using any mobile
    phone.... well according to me i am like an open book, i usualy dont make friends
    but if made they become a strong part of my life, i love my relations n afraid
    too of loosing them... i have enjoyed last 3 yrs of my life a lot with my college
    friends, i love music specially slow n harmonic, instrumental, n sometimes rock,
    jazz, pop, i love photography its 1 of my passions, also my hobbies are playing
    chess, billiards, writing articles n poems (well they are not for publications)...
    so these were some of my interests... basically i am interested to launch a personal
    website which will contain my intro, my life experience till now, information
    about my academics, my snaps, my achievemets, something like from which my friends
    n people can easily know me what am i

    got the G5. I was put through a rigamarole - and the person on the other end would
    say in the poorest English I've ever heard, something about two arrows on the
    screen. Well, there weren't two arrows on the screen and I could hear her brain
    fizz out. The next day I called back and had a very helpful customer service person
    who understood that there was a defect in the computer.\r\n\r\nAnd I'm sorry timd
