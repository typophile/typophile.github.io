<div class="post-content e-content" itemprop=articleBody>On the main forum page, the 'critique' forum mentions that it's a place to critique typefaces. It'd be nice if that description was a bit detailed and included the fact that logos and layouts are also critiqued in there.
Once in there, it'd be nice to have a reminder for folks how to best label their thread. Here's a quick sample of many of the current logo thread titles:
- Logo Design Advice/Critique Please
- Need advice on word mark
- Advice for logo
- Personal Logo... and Type
- need opinion please
- Help
- Personal Logo
- Need Feedback on "logo"
It'd be nice to remind people to use a descriptive title so we can follow the individual discussions a bit better.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Thank you for that post.
I was actually just thinking about that issue when I titled my post "Logo Design Advice/Critique Please." My two concerns were:
1. Judging by the way other posts are named, perhaps it is not good to put the name of the company in the label. In retrospect, that does not really make much sense.
2. At times it can be difficult to keep a label concise and still desccriptive.
On the other hand. This very issue created a problem for me recently because I read a posting one day and then I could not find it again a few days later.
Again, thanks for bring up this concern. I for one will make sure to label my future posts more carefully.

<div class=commentbody>Thanks for this post Darrel. One of my roles is technically to moderate the Critique forum and make sure that exactly this level of clarity that you're looking for is there. I've been quite lax in this over the last months. Sorry for the confusion :(
Duncan brings up a good point,too. I think that typefaces are easier to label that logos. Even print or web projects are easier to describe with limited words. Isn't everyone who uploads a logo basically asking, "hey guys, how could I make this logo for Company X better?"
Back in the day, the typeface sections were more populated that the logos and other design sections. I think that it is sort of a pity that this is not the case anymore. But all traffic and critique is good, even if it isn't specially type design related.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Perhaps we need to move all the critique stuff up one level and cut the subcategories. This would allow the showing of recent posts in the "Forums" window. Cut the categories down to three 1. Typeface critique, 2. Logo critique, 3. Type layout critique. This would put sans, serif, display, etc., in the same forum.

<div class=commentbody>I should have clarified. It's not the that title has to be overly descriptive...just that they have to be unique enough to tell one thread apart from the other when trying to keep up on the ones that were of interest to a reader.
As such, I'd suggest folks do put the name of the product/company they are creating the logo for in the title.
I'd also agree with Chris...the critiques are a bit buried which is a bit cumbersome and is also inconsistent with the rest of the forum areas. In addition, I would agree that the various types of type critiques don't necessarily need to be subdivided like that.</div>
