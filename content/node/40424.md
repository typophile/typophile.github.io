body: "I would love some input on this logo i've been working on for our organization...
  I can't seem to get anything more than \"It's great\" or \"I like it\" out of my
  co-workers (none of them are designers).\r\n\r\nHere is the scenario:\r\nWe are
  America's largest high school assembly program and we speak to millions of people
  every year. They have not had a designer until they brought me on in july of 2007.
  You can see the design mess I inherited here: [[http://www.rachelschallenge.com|Rachel's
  Challenge]]. I am currently working on changing things, most of the work I've done
  is marketing collateral, and I am trying to convince them of the need for them to
  have a unified brand, to update the logo and website. The problem is that they aren't
  buying it. Any talking points that would be helpful to convince them would be greatly
  appreciated.\r\n\r\nThis is the logo for a new program they are launching:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/legacy_4322.jpg]\r\n\r\nI
  wanted it to be very simple and appealing... It needs to be kind of trendy while
  still appealing to educators :) It comes in two parts. the actual name, and then
  the \"Power of One\" graphic. These are actually normally not together as they are
  here, the \"power of one\" is probably going to be used more frequently.\r\n\r\nThe
  type is Avant Garde. \r\n\r\nThoughts? \r\n\r\nThank You all in advance!\r\n"

  body: "Here is what I think as a design graphic student ;)\r\n\r\nAvant Garde is
    a very-seen typo. And, alone (without \"The Power Of One\"), maybe the \"Rachel's
    legacy\" may be not as stronger as it could be!\r\n\r\nI think the written part
    of the logo, The Power Of One, is quite powerful and efficient. It even may be
    too powerful for logo part \"Rachel's Legacy\" shown here.\r\n\r\nThe graphic
    part of the logo (the shape next to the word LEGACY) is confuse for me. I'm not
    convinced what exactly it is when I see it, even if I look with some attention.
    Is it a feather?\r\n\r\nIf I understand, Rachel's Legacy is an organization named
    after the first victim of the crime at Columbine High School on April 20, 1999.
    I would care about not using icons of violence and weapons. Maybe the O of \"ONE\"
    with a star in it may refer to some roundel or a target. I would even think about
    that some people may think that the feather-like shape next to the word LEGACY
    is a blood stain... :S\r\n\r\nBut I don't know, I'm not a designer yet, I'm just
    a student... :(\r\n\r\n-----------------:\r\nJean Chouinard"

  body: "Thanks for the responses! They help a lot...\r\n\r\nI was worried that is
    was a little... harsh. Now that I think about it, I have no idea why I chose RED
    of all colors :) I think that if I changed the color to a green or blue that would
    soften it up alot... I also have some other devices that can go in the \"O\"--for
    lack of a better term, the star does look somewhat...communist. \r\n\r\nAs far
    as the \"feather\" thing goes... I don't have a great reason for it to be there...
    It is an allusion to heraldry, something older (legacy). It is also there to soften
    up the look a bit, because Avant Garde is a bit hard.\r\n\r\nI have to walk a
    fine line, making it appeal to educators who actually bring the program into schools,
    and still making it appeal to students across a wide range of school cliques...
    \r\n\r\nThe powers that be in our organization haven't told me outright, but I
    have a sneaking suspicion that they would like me to use Comic Sans... ahhhh.\r\n\r\nI
    will repost when I've made revisions..."

    is all the emphasis on Rachel.\r\n\r\nMaybe put Rachel's Legacy as a tagline rather
    then the star of the show."

  body: "Ok. I'd ask what's the logo and what is the punch line? Because it looks
    like you can't really decide what is the mark. Is it Rachel's Legacy or is it
    The power of one?\r\n\r\nI don't like double stars and duality of texts...\r\n\r\nBut
    I welcome colour change."

  body: I agree with the colour change suggestion discussed previously, but I find
    there is still something very militant about it, even with the colour change(green,
    i think is not a good choice if you want to avoid military) The star graphic and
    the choice of type I think need more thought. I agree with Robert about the logo
    and tagline too.
