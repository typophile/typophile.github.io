    selection of signs. But perhaps the nobilitation of that random set by an own
    Unicode page \u2013 is even more stupid than the font itself. \r\nWell, the horse
    has left the barn long since, so what the heck \u2026"

  body: "\u2026 in my opinion it would be more interesting to battle for the design
    of (e.g.) a phone, a pen, a scissor, a car \u2026 to fit the style of a particular
    chosen typeface. \r\nFor instance, how would such characters look like when getting
    moulded in the style of a blackletter or formal script face? :\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/1f68_5720.png]\r\n\r\nAnyway,
    I don\u2019t mean to spoil the game. just my 2 \xA2s."
