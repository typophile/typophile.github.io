body: Does anybody know the name of this transitional(?) typeface used in a norwegian
  book from 1956? Notice the t and the italic d. Is there a digital version available?[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Sande_4280.jpg]

  body: "Very nice Italic and also the rest is quite handsome.\r\nThe Italic stroke
    has something that reminds me of Fournier but obviously the type is from a later
    epoche.\r\nThe g, yet, is very different from Cochin feeling (which is good I
    think)\r\n\r\nStefan\r\n\r\nSorry for not knowing anything about it ;-)"
