  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>Greetings! I&rsquo;m a real newbie here.
I&rsquo;ve got a homegrown font (which I didn&rsquo;t make), but need to modify. It was developed before unicode and UTF-8 allowed the millions of character possibilities for foreign languages. Specifically, Lithuanian. The Lithuanian letters were placed in un-needed places, like certain mathematical symbols, currency symbols, etc.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s easy enough to take the letters and put them in their correct unicode places. HOWEVER, there are no unicode-defined characters for the Lithuanian letters with accents. How does one go about making this happen? I know it&rsquo;s possible because there are other fonts that can do it. If someone can help, I can explain why using these other fonts aren&rsquo;t a good option.</p>
<p>If anyone&rsquo;s confused, here&rsquo;s an example of something we need to do. There is the &ldquo;normal&rdquo; ligature OE for French and Latin. It&rsquo;s a great example, because there is no unicode definition for an accented OE. For the AE ligature, there is!! How do you go about adding an accent mark such as     ´ to an oe ligature? Getting the keyboard to display it another thing. But that part I can handle. I just don&rsquo;t know how to make a font produce the needed glyph.</p>
<p>Any chance of getting some help? Would be MOST MOST appreciated.
Thanks!</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Probably, since Lituanian uses free accents, if one were starting with a fresh sheet, the best way to handle the accents would be to use the <strong>mark</strong> and <strong>mkmk</strong> features of OpenType. You can read the OpenType spec or do a Google search for the specifics of the technique. This strategy implements a feature of OpenType, the only aspect affected by Unicode is that the accents need to be in the font, properly encoded as combining diacritics (most of which are found in the 0300 to 036F range).</p>
<p>see <a href="http://www.unicode.org/charts/PDF/U0300.pdf">http://www.unicode.org/charts/PDF/U0300.pdf</a></p>
<p>The positioning of the accents is left to mark and mkmk.</p>
<p>But mark and mkmk do not take advantage of precomposed characters, that is, a glyph that already exists in a font. What you&rsquo;re describing in the old font seems to be exactly that, one where the accented characters are already &ldquo;built.&rdquo; With this approach, you use the ccmp feature of OpenType. Once again, the accents need to exist in the font as proper combining diacritics, but they are &ldquo;positioned,&rdquo; if you want, by having a character already composed. This character will have a <em>name</em>, but no Unicode number. However, it&rsquo;s <em>name</em> will specify the Unicode-character components.</p>
<p>For example: an m with a tilde will have, as its name, 
uni006D0303</p>
<p>The components have meaning: &ldquo;uni&rdquo; indicates that a Unicode number is being used for the name, 006D is the Unicode number for the Latin lowercase m, and 0303 is the Unicode number for  the tilde combining diacritic. When encountered in a text stream, any Unicode-savvy program or application knows exactly what is going on, namely, there is an m with a tilde accent over it.</p>
<p>To point to the characters, you need a ccmp feature &ndash; again, you can look this up in the OpenType spec. The particular ccmp statement that will cause this precomposed character to be used with any application program that supports OpenType would be</p>
<p>sub m tildecomb by uni006D0303;</p>
<p>and with the feature statement</p>
<p>feature ccmp { # Glyph Composition/Decomposition</p>
<h1 id="default">DEFAULT</h1>
<p>&hellip;;
&hellip;;
sub m tildecomb by uni006D0303;
&hellip;;
&hellip;;
} ccmp;</p>
<p>It all sounds harder than it actually is, primarily, I suppose, because one has to get into OpenType and OT features.</p>
<p>To use the such characters from a keyboard, however, is dirt simple. In either case (whether a mark or a ccmp strategy has been used), you simply type in the characters in sequence, the &ldquo;font&rdquo; does the rest. And Unicode preserves syntactic meaning for any future use of the text file.</p>
<p>Do bear in mind that the combining diacritic tildecomb at U+0303 is a <strong>different character</strong> from the (now) spacing modifier tilde found in so many old PostScript Type 1 fonts. That one, which has width, maps in Unicode to 02DC &ndash; a different character.</p>
<p>Hope this helps&hellip;</p>

<p>From the Lithuanian keyboard I have on my Mac, I guess there are other useful code points (there is for instance a dead key for a grave accent).</p>
<p>Hmm. I just checked and the dead key simply seems to serve to enter digits that don&rsquo;t figure where we would expect.

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Michel, the real question would be the need to encode for the diphthongs. Unless every occurrence of a letterpair is the diphthong in a language &ndash; as far as I can tell, OpenType doesn&rsquo;t provide for a way to substitute &ldquo;just some.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lithuanian_language#Diphthongs">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lithuanian_language#Diphthongs</a></p>
<p>As for new accents over Latin letters goes, I believe Unicode is on record as saying &ldquo;no more.&rdquo; That the font publishers do not populate the combining diacritics is not Unicode&rsquo;s fault; they have provided a mechanism within the Standard where syntactic meaning can be easily and always be preserved. The &ldquo;accenting&rdquo; mechanism itself can be done in several ways &ndash; in the font, or à la TeX, etc. Not Unicode&rsquo;s responsibility.</p>
<p>In fact, I now think Unicode has gone too far. People have come to expect new codepoints just to provide for accented Latin letters. I use to be one of them until I began working with Native American languages. One begins to realize just how many new characters would have to be added, if each accented or multiple accented vowel was given it&rsquo;s own codepoint.</p>
<p>For example, I&rsquo;ve been working on Kiowa lately. There would need to be over 100 new codepoints if all the accented vowels for just Kiowa (McKenzie orthography) were added as single characters&hellip;</p>
<p>If you think on it, fully half of Latin Extended Additional isn&rsquo;t needed. Pretty much all of Latin Extended A, except for &ldquo;legacy&rdquo; reasons.</p>

Michel, this isn&rsquo;t Unicode&rsquo;s problem. That there are application programs that will not correctly render characters is the problem of those programs, not Unicode. It would be different if NO program could properly render them. Unicode, in the end, is a standard, just like ASCII was.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll allow there may be some confusion with the i. Maybe the answer is there, &amp; I&rsquo;ve missed it. Suppose you have an &ldquo;i&rdquo; with a macron below, a macron above, and an acute above that. Should the tittle (dot) show? (And isn&rsquo;t that a function of the language, not the Standard?) But given that, should the name used to deconstruct the glyph use, for its base character, the dotless i or the basic i? Or should it vary, depending on what you want the deconstructed text stream to represent? (I&rsquo;ve put in spaces to make reading clearer, No spaces in the name when actually used, of course).</p>
<p>That is, be named 
uni0069 0331 0304 0301, or 
uni0131 0331 0304 0301</p>
<p>Or if the tittle is wanted, should it need to be explicit, i.e., 
uni 0069 0331 0307 0304 0301 or maybe?
uni 0131 0331 0307 0304 0301, where uni 0131 (whatever) 0307 is somehow further deconstructed to uni0069?</p>
<p>Anyway, that&rsquo;s the kind of thing the Standard is responsible for, and for all I know, it is there &amp; I just missed it.</p>
<p>Nor, for that matter, does Unicode proscribe preconstructed glyphs &ndash; just giving them a code point.</p>
<p>Finally, even if they were given a codepoint, wouldn&rsquo;t the browser folk then complain about a different problem &ndash; all the glyphs they now have to support, and the attending file size of each font?</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>And concerning the character oe with an acute, that does not exist in unicode, that glyph cannot be found in the font Gentium either. That does not prevent Gentium to render decently the glyph oe followed by the character acutecomb (the combining diacritic). Here is how it works; the grabs are  of Gentium Basic Bold seen through the eyes of FontForge; the text behind with the 35 &ldquo;missing&rdquo; characters is simply from TextEdit with the regular font:
<img src="/images/old-images/oeacute_4846.png" alt="">
On top of the character oe there is a mark, here denoted <code>Anchor-0</code>. For the glyph acutecomb, there is also a corresponding anchor. When the acutecomb follows the oe, the acutecomb is positioned on the oe so that the anchors be on top of each other.</p>
<p>Those anchors can be moved, copied and pasted in FontForge so as to take care of diacritics for which you do not intend to make precomposed characters.</p>

The problem is that in order to have a fully working version of FontForge, you need to be able to compile it. If you just want to fix anchors, there is a binary for the mac that can be installed quite rapidly. I don&rsquo;t know for windows. I personally need more than that: I need the FontForge python class and Python scripting.</div>

Where the components are:
0131    latin small letter dotless i
0237    latin small letter dotless j

0303    combining tilde
0307    combining dot above

<p>The other decompositions (for idotacute, idotgrave, idottilde) still work fine.</p>
<p>I also checked that those are NFD and NFKD decompositions. That implies, I think, that they should pose no problem when transmitted on the internet. If I copy the &ldquo;composite characters&rdquo; above from the typophile page and paste them in MorxTester, I get back the string of characters. Making a keyboard for the Macintosh that outputs those strings of characters when you hit a key can easily be done with Ukelele.</p>
<p>I am far from being convinced (that is a euphemism)  that giving &ldquo;0069 0301&rdquo; i.e. &ldquo;i acutecomb&rdquo; as decomposition for iacute (etc) in <a href="ftp://ftp.unicode.org/Public/UNIDATA/UnicodeData.txt">UnicodeData.txt</a> was a good idea; in terms of components (and that is what is relevant with decompositions), iacute  should have been  given the decomposition &ldquo;0131 0301&rdquo; i.e. dotless i acutecomb&quot; etc.</p>

<p>Is there anyone on this planet of ours that types an i followed by an acutecomb to get the character iacute? So far as I know, there is always a keyboard layout available such that, after keying the right combination, the character iacute is input and displayed; the input is a single character, not two, even if there were two strokes on the keyboard to get it. The decomposition has nothing to do with it. Kids need only learn to use the keyboard. Why should the decomposition in the file UnicodeData.txt be of any concern for kids in Africa? That decomposition is used, so far as I know, only by software people and font designers, and I think it is giving them troubles; to prove me wrong, please don&rsquo;t use an argument of authority.</p>
<p>By the way in TeX (and consequently LaTeX etc) \i is dotless i and to get an idieresis  (i tréma, ï) we (used to) type <code>&quot;\i</code> which asks for a dieresis on a dotless i. Similarly for i circumflex. That was one of the first things we had to learn so as to be able to type text in French with TeX (and I know at least one colleague that still codes her input latex files that way, without using the package inputenc that allows for latin1 or utf-8 input).</p>

Right-click or control-click on it, and select &ldquo;delete&rdquo; from the pop-up menu.</p>
<p>Michel (&amp; Charles): Perhaps Michel is right that Unicode could or should have made the canonical comp/decomp use the dotless forms of the letters i and j. But they didn’t, and there is no changing it now. In which case, it is incumbent upon Unicode-processing systems (fonts and system-level support) to deal with the problem. Basically, for combining marks on i and j that do not have precomposed forms, some part of the machinery needs to strip the dot.</p>
<p>I would not be surprised if the responsibility was already understood to lie in one court or the other between the fonts and the engines, but I don’t happen to know which.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>And back to the topic of the thread&hellip; or maybe a secondary topic:</p>
<p>A Standard should preseve syntactic integrity of a file for all users. It doesn&rsquo;t matter if it is a kid on the African plains using a free, basic computer (or China or anywhere, but they don&rsquo;t use the Latin alphabet), or the most sophisticated New York Advertising Agency with high-dollar hardware and software.</p>
<p>And practical things get in the way. The dotless i is in Latin extended A, and for ASCII, was surely <strong>not</strong> in the fixed portion 0-127. What was in the 8th bit was always up for grabs.</p>
<p>So the point is, an &ldquo;i&rdquo; with a tittle is better than no i at all. Whether or not the Unicode Consortium should assume the dotless i in all operating systems and type formats, I don&rsquo;t know. AFAIK, the only language that uses it is Turkish, for all the other, it is just assumed that should any accent appear over an i, the tittle is not used. So, getting back to the kid in Africa with the hand-out computer, what&rsquo;s important, in terms of the standard, is that he/she knows it is an &ldquo;i&rdquo; being used, not that it is rendered beautifully.</p>
<p>The beautiful rendering, as had been suggested, is the work of the various application programs and browsers. When there is a fault, it is there. However, before the people who write those programs can do their work, they do need to know what the standard is, and I&rsquo;m not sure the Unicode Consortium has made that clear. Anyone know that information?</p>

I just had a look at how Gentium Plus processes the "i combining-dot-above" sequence: it simply puts the combining dot on top of the existing dot which then hides behind the combining dot and is thus saved from being stripped! Same thing with iogonek. Nice and simple.</div>

After the post http://www.typophile.com/node/115342  I had indeed  realized that with Inkscape (on a Mac, but that probably makes no difference) non merged overlapping contours in .otf characters were not rendered correctly. After your comment, I thought that Inkscape might indeed erase the dots; I just modified Heuristica .otf to check and with different glyphs, there appears to be no problem. What follows is a grab from Inkscape 0.48.2  (on OS X 10.9.3)
![](/images/old-images/overlappingdots_3734.png)
Anyway, should it not be the case that a rendering that erases the intersection of two different characters is faulty? </div>

I guess you can save yourself lots of work with a contextual substitution that puts in the context all characters in your font that have <a href="http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr44/tr44-4.html#Property_Values">combining canonical class 230</a> (distinct marks directly above); if you have ffPython installed (the python that comes with the latest mac binaries for fontforge), you can find them   and output the class in the format needed for Fontlab with just a few lines of Python. With that solution, you however remove the dot of these four for which Gentium Plus does not:
![](/images/old-images/combiningdouble_6017.png)
I see no property in the unicode data that distinguishes them from the others.</div>
