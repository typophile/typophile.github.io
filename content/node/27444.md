body: "Actually, the problem is with alignment zones, as I haven't specifically applied
  any hinting to the font. (Unless there is some output setting that does hinting
  automatically that I'm not aware of.)\r\n\r\nHere's the offending item. It's printed
  on newsprint, 14 pt. The font is \".otf\", output to PDF from InDesign:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/options_4437.png]\r\n\r\n\r\nA
  Type 1 version of a very similar font (with almost the same alignment zones and
  standard stems) came out as intended.\r\nThis is on coated stock, again at 14 pt:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/intos_6715.png]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe
  main reason I give the fonts alignment zones is so that they are neat on screen:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/ionsBMP_4235.png]\r\n\r\n\r\nHere
  is what the FontLab file looks like (a composite of screen grabs, actually):\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/ionsFL_6170.png]\r\n\r\n\r\nCan
  anybody shed some light on my difficulty?"

  body: "Nick,\r\nAre these family alignment zones? \r\n\r\nAlso, at 14 point, I can't
    see why there should be that much of a difference. The cup in your terminal does
    not seem that severe--wierd.\r\n\r\nChrisL"

    workshop in NYC that the x height and baseline should be at the middle of ''cupped''
    terminals, not the extremes, for ''flex hinting'' to work properly. I don''t really
    understand it, but I believe it relates to the blue zones also. Hopefully he can
    clear it up for you. Me too! '

  body: "<em>Are these family alignment zones?</em>\r\n\r\nI used the same alignment
    zones for the four base weights of the family, but I didn't use the \"family zone\"
    feature, as I was uneasy with/didn't understand the interface for it. This is
    in Fontlab Studio BTW."
