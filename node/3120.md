body: attached is an image that I&#39;d love to have as a font, but was told that
  it was calligraphy, and turning this into a font was a rather monumental project.
  <BR> <BR>Now, I&#39;m just curious about the translation process and I&#39;m wondering
  if anyone here has calligraphy experience and can explain how this would hypothetically
  work.  <BR> <BR>Also, I was shown Zapfino, but can anyone recommend some calligrahpic
  script sets that are similar in any way to the attached picture. <BR> <BR>Thanks-

  body: Kent <BR> <BR>I am a left-handed calligrapher, so I am not really a calligrapher
    atall, but I think the sample you show would make a font with some effort. <BR>
    <BR>I seems to me that the flourish on the ascender of the d could be a separate
    character &#40;in fact, there could be a partial &#34;extra&#34; sorts font of
    flourishes&#41; that could be place by baseline shifting and tracking into position,
    or  just straight finialled letters like the k. <BR> <BR>It&#39;s also likely
    that there should be flourishes below the baseline as well. Aditionally there
    could be starting and finishing swashes that could be places without looking like
    they&#39;d been paste-potted in. <BR> <BR>It would be a real challenge, but I
    think very possible. If you take a second look at how separate the flourish really
    is from the lowercase d. <BR> <BR>If the caps were drawn intentionally large as
    the sample, there would be little need top scale up or down more than few%, so
    that there would be no obvious variance in weight. <BR> <BR>You would need to
    work closely with somebody who has a good calligraphic wrist. Are you on speaking
    terms with Julian Waters? <BR> <BR>Jim Rimmer

  body: It might be possible to create a font that looks similar to this in certain
    ways, but part of the charm of lettering like this is the fact that each character
    is unique, created for and taking advantage of the specific location it occupies
    in the whole.  <BR> <BR>You can approach it somewhat &#40;as with Zapfino&#41;,
    but it is something that is ultimately beyond the limits of typography as it exists.
    Characters in fonts need to be created in such a way that they will work acceptably
    in a practically unlimited number of unknowable combinations. Characters in lettering
    like this only have to work in one specific known combination. It&#39;s a big
    difference and the one that really defines the line between lettering and typography.

    as that piece of calligraphy, any more than Kenny G is going to be mistaken for
    a man playing jazz. <BR> <BR>Jim <BR> <BR>

    <BR>This gives an idea of the problems encountered by creating a calligraphic
    set, however, as Mark says there is no substitute for doing each project as a
    specific item. You would need to consider 2 or 3 different versions of each character,
    plus all the varieties of swash beginning, ending, up, down plus a selection of
    flourishes. It is something I&#39;ve been considering &amp; rejecting for some
    years. I don&#39;t mean to be discouraging, but there is a mountain of work to
    achieve something that, eventually is &#40;possibly&#41; self-defeating. <BR>Tim

  body: 'I think Poetica, handled well, can be extremely effective, but of course
    it is not the same as lettering. It succeeds by being formal and typographic -
    a swash italic with some calligraphic alternatives to be used very sparingly.
    I suspect that it was inspired by Van Krimpen&#39;s similar concept Cancelleresca
    Bastarda, which  I don&#39;t think has been digitized.  <BR> <BR>I admit that
    things you would use Poetica for could always be better done by an excellent calligrapher.
    However, this is usually not a practical option both because of cost and because
    the calligrapher would have to be good indeed. The showing at the beginning of
    this thread has precisely the freedom and variation that you couldn&#39;t do in
    type, as Mark Simonson - who is awesome at this sort of thing - points out.  '

  body: 'On the one hand, it&#39;s certainly true that digital type can&#39;t yet
    come anywhere near the level of calligraphic sophistication shown at the beginning
    of this thread. <BR> <BR>On the other, it&#39;s also the case that given an intelligent
    font format such as AAT or OpenType, it is possible to do some pretty amazing
    calligraphic stuff in a &#40;single&#41; font, and have it all work intelligently.
    Yes, the amount of work is excessive. There are 12 different forms of the lowercase
    &#34;p&#34; in Caflisch Script Pro, and it doesn&#39;t even have extra-swashy
    variants of that letter. Then there&#39;s all the work to set up the contextual
    behaviors.... <BR> <BR>Today, we have only two fonts that do this in full, Zapfino
    and Caflisch Script Pro. There are a couple more that go fairly far down the path:
    Poetica Std and Bickham Script Std. I believe that such fonts will continue to
    be few and far between, basically existing only as a showcase for the typographic
    and design prowess of an individual or a company. <BR> <BR>But then again, it&#39;s
    probably a minority of today&#39;s type design that has appropriate recompense,
    anyway. <BR> <BR>Cheers, <BR> <BR>T'

  body: Kent, making a font that can convincingly render something like your setting
    is doable, but it&#39;s indeed a herculean task. The good news is that you only
    really have to &#34;fool&#34; laymen, not font geeks like us!  :-&#41; <BR> <BR>hhp

  body: thanks so much for all the info. <BR>I know zilch about calligraphy, but it&#39;s
    great to hear all these points, which I didn&#39;t know or had not thought about.
    <BR> <BR>I think I may be able to use Scriptina along w/ my own graphic elements
    and pull something off. <BR> <BR>Thanks again-
