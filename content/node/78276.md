  body: 'I''m concerned about some micro stuff: At the bottom, where it says "staged
    reading of Mike", the italic "f" really gets too close to the "Mike". Add some
    space. Also, for a three-line ragged-right poster paragraph, the hyphenated "Thea-tre"
    at the end of a line-broken sentence is quite awkward. The bottom right of the
    poster is a bit empty; it''s a little unbalanced. Why does ''Glee'' get single
    quotes and not ''Diverting Devotion'' at the bottom? Be consistent. Grammar-wise,
    the parenthetical note about Mike O''Malley following "Mike O''Malley''s" with
    the genitive apostrophe-S is a little weird.'
