  body: "James, those fonts look very much like what is in my book but the set is
    not complete. The fonts only go through the GW monogram right now so I guess yours
    are to come.\r\n\r\nI have a JR but no JD although I have two DJ monograms; no
    stand-alone D though. Also, while the shapes are the same as your sample, in my
    book one letter is filled in so they differ in that respect. If you like I can
    scan them and post them here.\r\n\r\nThe book I have is also available on abe.com
    for $170.00. It dates to the latter half of the 19th century, probably somewhere
    along in the 1880-90 range.\r\n\r\nGeorge"
