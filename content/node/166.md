body: 'I&#39;m trying to design the letters of my name and when I export those letters
  as a truetype font from fontlab and then I use this font in photoshop 7.0.1, it
  seems that the precise letter spacing I had in fontlab 4.5 is not so precise in
  photoshop anymore. <BR> <BR>and when I&#39;m finish designing those letters should
  I keep the same numbers of anchors point I use like in this myriad example or should
  I increase the number of anchors point like in this didot example? <BR> <BR>thanks
  for the answer... <BR> <BR><!--attachment: oo-10885.pdf*mime_pdf.gif*application/pdf*6.0**oo%2epdf
