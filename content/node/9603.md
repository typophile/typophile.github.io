  body: Sorry, Mike, but the bitmapping is too rough - there&#39;s no way  <BR>we
    can distinguish serif shapes. Heck, it&#39;s even hard to make  <BR>out the overall
    shapes of the characters. We&#39;ll need a much better  <BR>sample if you want
    us to ID this.

  body: That was my first thought when I saw the original sample, but I ruled it out
    at that time because the p is all wrong.

  body: You&#39;re right. The 2004 is so baskerville-ish I jumped too quickly to eaves.
    It could be custom, or perhaps a different baskerville derivative?
