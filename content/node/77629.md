body: "I drew a font in Fontlab with several alternatve glyphs for each charakter
  and with some ligatures. When I enter the names of the alternative glyphs in the
  class panel in order to classkern them, they just don\xB4t appear (while the \"normal\"
  glyphs like a,b,c...) work alright.\r\nMaybe I named the alternative glyphs wrong?\r\nthey
  are called a.alt, a.alt2, and so on.\r\nI have the same problem with the ligatures
  and with the german Umlauts like \xD6,\xC4,\xDC (Odieresis, Adieresis, Udieresis,).
  \r\n\r\n\r\nThanks for ideas, also for advices where i can learn more about the
  subject myself.\r\n\r\njul"
