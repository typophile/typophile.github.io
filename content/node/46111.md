body: "Hello. \r\nI purchased ITC Avant Garde Gothic from Adobe a few years ago. I'd
  love to have the alternates to use with it. Does anyone know of a version of the
  alternates I can buy that is compatible/drawn to match? Is the Elsner+Flake Avant
  Garde Gothic Alternates compatible with the Adobe/ITC version, or would I need to
  buy the entire E+F Avant Garde family?\r\n(I did do a search of past Typophile  posts
  about this, but they didn't seem entirely clear to me)\r\n\r\nThanks for any help
  you can offer me..."

  body: "Unfortunately you're going to get a slightly different height and weight
    from the two versions. You need to buy the whole family from one foundry or the
    other.\r\n\r\nFor those who want ease of use, I recommend <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/itc/itc_avant_garde_gothic_pro_virtual/\">ITC
    Avant Garde Gothic Pro</a> which has the alternates and ligatures built into a
    single OpenType font for each weight. For those who want the alts but value <a
    href=\"http://typographica.org/001029.php\">true italics</a>, the only choice
    is the <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/search/?q=elsner+flake%20avant%20garde\">E+F
    digitization</a>."
