body: "I am setting an e-book using InDesign that will be distributed online. The
  target audience is people who are about to undergo eye surgery (retinal surgery,
  cataracts, etc.).\r\n\r\nI'm trying to decide which fonts might be have the best
  readability for this audience. I would appreciate any suggestions.\r\n\r\nI am considering
  Leitura News and Leitura Sans. Both come in four weights, and the the no. 2 weight
  of each is somewhere between a regular roman and a semibold, which strikes me as
  ideal, bigger than the usual body text, but not screamingly big.\r\n\r\nI also am
  considering Warnock Pro, but it is a bit delicate looking for my purposes.\r\n\r\nAny
  suggestions from you experts?"

    embedding.\r\nThen make sure to set it in a not too small size with proper leading."

    \r\n\r\n\"Typography and the Aging Eye: Typeface Legibility for Older Viewers
    with Vision Problems\"\r\nhttp://www.aiga.org/content.cfm/typography-and-the-aging-eye\r\n\r\nThe
    article recommends using fonts that have:\r\n\u2022\_Consistent stroke widths\r\n\u2022\_Open
    counterforms\r\n\u2022 Pronounced ascenders and descenders\r\n\u2022 Wider horizontal
    proportions\r\n\u2022\_More distinct forms for each character (such as tails on
    the lowercase letters \u201Ct\u201D and \u201Cj\u201D)\r\n\u2022 Extended horizontal
    strokes for certain letterforms (such as the arm of the lowercase letter \u201Cr\u201D
    or the crossbar of the lowercase letter \u201Ct\u201D)"

  body: "As I understand it, it is OK to embed all Adobe fonts. Is this correct?\r\n\r\nAlso,
    I checked the EULA for DS Type, which licenses Leitura, and it reads as follows:\r\n-----\r\nEmbedding\r\nThe
    User may embed the font software in a secure electronic document for Previewing
    and Printing use only. The font software may NOT be used to create or distribute
    any electronic document in which the font software, or any part thereof, is embedded
    in a format that permits editing, alterations, enhancements, or modifications
    by the recipient of such document without obtaining a License Extension from DSTYPE
    Unipessoal LDA, authorizing you to do so.\r\n-----\r\n\r\nI think PDF files fulfill
    this requirement since, short of hacking in, the fonts in PDF files can't be accessed
    by users. \r\n\r\nAnd thanks to JamesM for the extremely helpful article on legibility
    for older viewers.\r\n\r\n"

    Commercial Use rather than a Business Use. Most EULAs I'm familiar with make this
    distinction, and require an additional license fee.\r\n\r\nOn another note, I
    had double cataract surgery two years ago, and in the year or so prior, when my
    vision was the poorest, I did not find any difference in reading different type
    styles. They were all difficult."

  body: I would say go with Leitura news. The small caps, ligatures, alternates and
    swashes improve visibility and make it ideal for an online ebook

    EULA you quoted was also forbidding use of that font in an interactive PDF (for
    example a survey form in PDF format with blank fields that the user fills in on
    their computer before returning the PDF to the survey company). You should be
    safe because it sounds like your PDF will be read-only."

    monitor, Georgia is designed for that purpose. \r\n\r\nOf the four faces that
    come with the ibook app on my ipod touch, Georgia is the easiest to read.\r\n\r\nOr
    try Interstate. Highly legible, several weights."

  body: "I agree with SBieber, When I was setting a PDF eBook last year I couldn't
    justify not using a font like Georgia or Verdana. I ended up using Verdana for
    the body, and set the headings in Lucida Grande because it reads almost as good
    as Verdana on screen but Lucida has more elegant caps \u2014 which is what I was
    setting the headings in."

  body: "If your readers are blind, I recommend Braille. \r\n\r\nIf they're about
    to undergo eye surgery its probably because they can't read anymore. I had a grandma
    with a cataract once. She had 10% vision left in that eye. We ended up having
    to put her down. But that's besides the point. I think you should get a typeface
    that capitalizes on a 10% reading and recognition level. A big slab serif, like
    Morgan, Jubilat,or Neutraface. Would work well at 172 pts. Because even when slabs
    are blurry, like being drunk or almost blind, the definitions of which letters
    they are still end up being legible. I really think Jubilat looks great in pdfs.
    Its like the unofficial defacto pdf typeface. If you must go sans, I would stick
    with blacks. Like they say once you go black... You'll never go ultra lol. Joke.
    But seriously, ultras tend to get condensed on the details, like on S especially.
    And bold may not be as impacting as you need, depending on the typeface. Akagi
    black is good. So is Alright black. Gotham, may be one of those blacks that just
    look too thin and open. However, using Gotham ultra retains details better than
    Akagi black I think. Design the ebook first, worry about EULAS latter."
