  business. He's a good friend so I agreed to do the design. After a quick look in
  my arsenal, I realized - What the heck kind of San-serif face to use for this sort
  of identity?\r\n\r\n"

    taints almost every aspect of life worldwide, so unless your friend is part of
    some tiny sect that has a very distinct identity already it will be hard to express
    the religion with letters."

  body: "\"I have a client with a Christian-based business.\"\r\n\r\nThat can mean
    one of two things, IMHO:\r\n\r\na) they are a business related to the church industry
    (pews, bibles, hymnals, choir robes, etc.)\r\n\r\nb) they are a business completely
    unrelated to the church but think that saying they are christian will attract
    other christian's to hire them.\r\n\r\nwith a), obviously, you can go nuts with
    religious iconography and fonts that are in the spirit of it. \r\n\r\nwith b),
    though, unless they are wanting to be EXCLUSIVELY targetting other christians,
    I'd say you want to stay away from anthing too literal to avoid annoying those
    that aren't looking for 'christian based' companies.\r\n\r\nI also have to smile
    after visiting Nick's link, and also would agree that Beorcana is quite nice. "

    if there was any hotstamping involved.
