body: Sorry about the tiny tiny images, but still someone might have an idea.. It
  might be custom, but I'm looking for a font that at least resembles this... [img:sites/default/files/old-images/Bild33_4980.jpg][img:sites/default/files/old-images/Bild34_5728.jpg][img:sites/default/files/old-images/Bild35_6296.jpg]

  body: "However, I have searched quite a bit without finding the same lettering.
    The angular S ought to be easy enough to spot. I even thought it looked familiar,
    but so far I have not spotted it. The other letters seem close to an old Oldstyle/Image
    Club font called Cartoon that has been slanted and condensed, but not that S.\r\n\r\n-

    it might be close in feel, at least.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: "Another idea is [[http://www.dafont.com/orange-fizz.font?nb_ppp=50&text=PLANKSTEKG|Orange
    Fizz]] by Blambot, a freebie. The italic might feel pretty similar to your sample.\r\n\r\n-
