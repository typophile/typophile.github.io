  and something pointed out by Queneau: <em>Why do you need to classify typefaces?</em>\r\n\r\nDo
  we really need to classify them? Do we actually use them? Where do the new and ever
  evolving fonts which technological advances allow fit? - anyone with a computer
  can design a typeface (Shakespeare, monkeys and typewritters spring to mind...)
  Are the old historical classification models (Vox, British Standard etc) too narrow
  to satisfactorily accomodate 550 years of practice appropriately? Are the 'online'
  models, like Fontshops, enough?"

    \u201Cthat look kind of like Griffo drew them\u201D."

    that categorization and classification are used.\r\n\r\n1. Foundries supply keywords
    with their fonts.\r\n2. Site users can tag fonts.\r\n3. Site users can search
    by keyword.\r\n4. Or by the more visual \"More fonts like this\" app.\r\n"
