  and I was curious as to what would be a good compliment to Blur?\r\n\r\nHere is
  what it looks like for those who don't know exactly if that helps:\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://bonfx.com/custom/100-best-fonts/images/61_blur.png\">\r\n\r\n\r\nI
  obviously want a good contrast to the typeface and ideally would like it to be serif.
  The blur type on the page is used for header obviously. Thanks in advance!"

  body: "Hi Alex, I'd suggest you not to use Blur at all. Your potential employer
    might get the wrong impression; as if you are trying too hard. I would stick to
    using one font by applying different weights, styles and sizes. You could use
    [[http://scalafont.com/specimen/|Scala]] for body and Scala Sans(Bold) for headings.
    In case if you go on using Blur, then Times is a good choice. \r\n\r\n\r\nSB"

  body: "Thanks for the suggestions. Hmm, I guess I didn't think about it like that,
    and it wasn't more or less me trying too hard but me wanting to have fun designing
    my resume - I'm still sticking to a grid layout. I have the Scala family so I
    may do two separate resumes and get my teachers to compare the two. They're all
    close to AIGA so they're opinion should be valid as well. Thanks! :)\r\n\r\nPS
    I actually usually stick to the more traditional typefaces which is why I had
    an interest in blur."
