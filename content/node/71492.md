  on this logo. I always have trouble kerning capital letter. My main issue is with
  anly letter with a diagonal line in i, so the 'A's, 'V' and 'W'.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/final_logo_6235.png]\r\n\r\nThank
  you very much in advance. \r\n\r\nEmily"

    moved to the right a bit a TEENY bit further from the \"L\" and closer to the
    \"W\". The second \"A\" of CANVAS could be kerned a little closer to the \"V\"
    maybe.\r\n\r\nOther than that, it looks fine."

    mood, so feel free to ignore my observations....but...the logo and logotype don't
    seem at all connected. IMHO, this is a much larger problem than the kerning. The
    two styles conflict and there is no relationship between them - they compete with
    each other. Some of the conflict is scale and placement, but I wouldn't bother
    fixing that until the styles are harmonious.  \r\n\r\nThe logo? Could be for a
    TV station. The logotype? A cabinetmaker. Who/what is this logo for?"

  body: "Hi Alaskan,\r\n\r\nThank you for your input. I do appreciate it. I agree
    with what you're saying actually. The client chose this type for the logo from
    about 5 while looking at it on an iPhone so the type looked a lot cleaner. I'd
    forgotten this font had a weird texture to until I put it up here. (TBH I was
    starting to think I need to go back and find another font)\r\n\r\nLet me tell
    you a bit about Thom; he used to be a graffiti artist until a few years ago he
    stopped. He's now working as a voluntary Special constable but on the side he
    does portraits on canvases for people. Keeping with his graffiti root's he does
    them in a stencil/Banksy style. He needed a logo and brand. \r\n\r\nThom wanted
    a marque that could become recognisable without text. We spent quite a while coming
    up with different ideas. Eventually we landed on what you see above. We where
    steering away from the obvious stencil/graffiti connotations. What you see above
    is a more clean cut sticker graffiti vibe. It can be used as a nice clean vector
    or can be stenciled on the back of his canvases. \r\n\r\nI've been trying to find
    the perfect font for over a week now. As you can see the marque is BOLD and I
    need a font that will sit comfortably with that. Do you have any suggestions?
    I was using Gotham Ultra.\r\n\r\nE\r\n\r\nP.S. I laughed out loud when you suggested
    cabinetmaker!"

    have had a reason for that. :)\r\n\r\nI'd say just make your own outlines of the
    current type, and draw your own version of each letter in illustrator. This way
    you can have the same letterforms but get rid of the texture."

    as it has a really similar letterform to the font I used above but with a MUCH
