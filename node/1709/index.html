It's interesting the way our cultural memory of the 1950s is changing. Presently, I would say that most people ignore the modernism of the 1950s, and think of it as a very retro, scripty era, or perhaps wonky (that's for you, Tom) and beat-mod, as in the &quot;Saul Bass&quot; lettering style (done for him by lettering artists such as Art Goodman). Fontesque is usually described as &quot;fifties style&quot;, which really pisses me off &ndash; I guess I'll have to wait a while for it to be called &quot;90s style&quot;. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt;Eurostile looks modern <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->There is definitely something very space-age and futuristic about the CRT-derived &quot;supercurve&quot; (Zapf's term?) that characterizes Novarese's Eurostile &ndash; making it a favorite for data displays and signage in sci-fi movies. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Sans serif typefaces have been described as &quot;modern&quot; since the 1840s, so it's a pretty meaningless term &ndash; particularly when one considers that the Didone class of types is also called &quot;modern&quot;! <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->However, Richard is right. We should encourage designers to not just fudge things by using typefaces that are merely &quot;modern&quot; in appearance, but to specify ones that are actually of the present day. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->If not something more hard-core techno, Foundry Monoline or Paralucent should certainly be preferred over Eurostile, which has been used as the corporate style of a gazillion engineering firms over the past 40 years.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->If EDF wants to position itself as a conservative, run-of-the-mill engineering company, Eurostile may be a good choice, but this is not the rationale proferred in the style guide. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --></div>

Or if it does, it's all about a bland, generic, world dominated by corporations that have no use for local idiosyncracies. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->As David Jury wrote in Eye, Summer 2001, &quot;Total, independent control of typography has been dropped in the lap of every graphic designer, yet the same technology sits on desks in every business and commercial organisation. The question will be asked more and more: &quot;Should I employ a graphic designer, or 'design' it myself?&quot; Put another way; if the finer points of typography are not addressed, then what will be the difference between a graphic designer and an administratvie assistant, paid perhaps ten times as less for doing the same job just as badly?&quot; <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I would say that carefully choosing a contemporary typeface, and working with it (learning how to &quot;play&quot; it), is one of those finer points that needs to be addressed. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->And if a UK company accepts Eurostile (Italy, 1960s) for its typestyle, rather than the local, contemporary Paralucent or Foundry Monoline, that's not representing for its own people, that's an insult to the culture of its customers. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->And with bland, generic design such as an ID that's a big off-the-shelf &quot;e&quot; + Eurostile, used by a major corporation, hey, the message is clear, Who needs a designer, anybody can do that crap.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">If that's the case, I trust that you never use any fonts older than, oh, say 10 years? <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->This particular usage of Eurostile is bland, I'll grant you that, but that does not change the fact that Eurostile has a unique feel to it.  One that would be far more appropriate in some instances than any other font, and one that, though it is getting on in years, is still quite relevant aesthetically. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I look at Foundry Monoline and see a typeface that imitates what Eurostyle was designed for.  Paralucent has a unique look to it, but again, to me it looks like an imitation. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->If a 50 year old font works for a specific project, use it.  Just because it is getting on in years does not mean that it is not still useful.  Especially considering that it is impossible to make a font today that does not have a &quot;feeling&quot; of a font from yesterday.  Consider this Paralucent which says it was inspired by Univers Helvetica, fonts just as old as Monostyle. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Eurostyle is still a completely valid font despite it's age.  Using it does not mean the person who does so is a lazy or cheap designer.  And when you consider that that logo is for a large corporation, you should take into account the fact that large corporations work through committee.  Chances are the &quot;designer&quot; had barely any say in the final decision anyway.</div>

It reeks of <!-- raw HTML omitted -->complacency and a lack of knowledge as to what else <!-- raw HTML omitted -->is 'out there'. This runs parallel with my opinion of  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->music. A friend asked me whether I was going to see <!-- raw HTML omitted -->metallica in concert. I said no, explaining that for every  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->metallica there are plenty of musicians who are making <!-- raw HTML omitted -->music that is just as good, if not better, but do not have <!-- raw HTML omitted -->the luxury of mass exposure. When I discover a gem <!-- raw HTML omitted -->'unknown' album it is far more rewarding. Metallica, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->like the old typographic stalwarts, are indeed genre <!-- raw HTML omitted -->defining. But I imagine they (band &amp; type) were much <!-- raw HTML omitted -->more exciting and relevant in their heyday. Unlike wine, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->they do not get better with age. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --></div>

		<div class="commentbody">I don't see using old typefaces as a problem at all, frankly. There are many new typefaces coming out all the time, and some of them are absolutely wonderful, but that doesn't mean that they made older designs obsolete. I think that this discussion boils down to the associative connotations a typeface might have. For example, to me, the use of Didot immediately takes me back to french class, reading Moliere. But that is a subjective judgement.  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Typefaces only have connotations if they have somehow entered the public consciousness. For example, Eurostile, despite what adobe might say or whoever else for that matter, to most people just means FCUK.  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->In other words, if a typeface gives an appropriate look and is used properly, it'll work regardless of when it was produced.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->H</div>

This kind of work isn't worth much, and will soon be replaced by expensive software operated by low-paid drones. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Erik Spiekermann commented on the use of DIN for highway signage in South Africa.
