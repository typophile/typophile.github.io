  a type I started making for the identity of a study program \r\nthe students in
  there learn to be nurses for old people at home (yes there is an english word for
  that, i just dont know it)\r\n\r\nSo the first idea was to make the type out of
  crosses (as in red cross), it turned out to have a sort stitching look to it, which
  was also fine for the target group of old ladies.\r\n\r\nthe client chose for another
  proposal because this ' wasnt readable' (its meant to be read ny the young students
  mind you, not the patients)\r\n\r\ni sort of like the weirdness of it, and I'd like
  to give it a last push because i feel its not quite there yet\r\n\r\noh and yeah
  i like the system of ornaments, theyre broken down to small elements so you can
  combine them as you wish\r\n\r\nany suggestions ??[img:sites/default/files/old-images/stip_4256.gif]"

  body: I only have a brief moment to comment, but one thing that struck me is that
    the a looks like a d ("ornaments" read at first like "orndments"). Also, I know
    that I've seen a font made out of crosses before (which is in no way to suggest
    that you shouldn't pursue yours). Maybe from a fellow typophile...?

    you a hard time send him/her this:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/crossstitch_6704.jpg]\r\nSorry,
    just kidding. I won't comment on technical aspects because I'm not qualified but
    I think the concept is lovely.\r\n"

  body: I kind of like this type with its boldness and wackyness. But as <em>auricfuzz</em>
    already mentioned there are some similarities with other cross based typefaces
    (like <a href="http://www.processtypefoundry.com/typefaces/fig/index.html">Fig</a>
    for example) but those goofy looking characters still makes this face unique.
    I think it needs some more work though before it could be more commonly used...

  body: lol! Yes, and in my spare time I knit logos too. Kidding of course, I have
    no idea where the image comes from, just found it in the internet ages ago.

  body: "thanks for the feedback everyone !\r\n\r\nI had the idea that having this
    sort of uneven conecting principle instead of a grid would also give the letters
    their own identity instead of looking like existing stuff ...\r\n\r\nof course
    it still needs to be worked out in a better way\r\n\r\nI'll post as soon as I've
    made changes"
