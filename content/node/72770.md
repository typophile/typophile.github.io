  body: "Overall looks really good, but from the start, your acute and grave accents
    look too horisontal; I was thaught that they should fly off the tangent of 'o',
    but yours seem to hover over them. And your standard 4 looks wider than other
    numerals. And I would go with vertical stems with \xC6 and \u0152; Scandinavians
    like that sort of things.\r\n\r\nReadability and leigibility are very good, so
    good stuff!"

    it's how we use them on spanish, but, I could do both! It's not a bad idea.\r\n\r\nAbout
    the \xC6 and \u0152, tell me more! \r\nThe ones i've made are not very accepted?\r\n\r\nBest
    regards."

    mainly used today in Scandinavia, so they know the best practice, as you can see

    much.

    the \"f\"?\r\n\r\nRegards"

  body: "Hola Fernando. Well, it seems that sans projects always receive much more
    contributions than serif ones. My two cents:\r\n\r\n<strong>01</strong>: about
    acute, what I told about F\xE9nix applies here too. But I must add that Libertad
    acute has a wonderful shape, really handsome.\r\n\r\n<strong>02</strong>: I like
    your f descender, but I believe it needs the same bottom cut as thorn descender.\r\n\r\n<strong>03</strong>:
    your alternates for a and k are insightful and welcome, especially the 5th k and
    the 4th a. I don't like alternate s because its curves seem to be irregular \u2013and
    so it does not fit to font overall regularity.\r\n\r\n<strong>04</strong>: very
    nice numbers! I guess oldstyle 6 and 9 will work better with a somewhat bigger
    \"o\" to compensate the area \"lost\" due to out-of-lining arcs. Some test besides
    other oldstyle numbers would confirm or not my impression. Anyway, I don't like
    5 vertical stem. It makes the glyph appear a bit inclined towards left. Maybe
    a small inclination in the stem solves this.\r\n\r\n<strong>05</strong>: W could
    be a bit narrowed.\r\n\r\n<strong>06</strong>: as it's intended to small sizes,
    comma and apostrophe may benefit with a stronger tail.\r\n\r\n<strong>07</strong>:
    I second Thomas opinion about r.\r\n\r\nI like very much general text effect.
    Very clear, regular and legible. Glyphs d, p, q, h, m, n and g are perfect. I
    surely would use it with alternate a #4.\r\n\r\nKeep the great work."
