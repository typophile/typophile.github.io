  looking for a very complete text face for a multilingual (european) project. Now
  I`m in the situation that I have to decide between \"Gentium\" or \"Andron\". (it's
  not a question of cost)\r\n\r\nAny tip would be appreciated.\r\n\r\nVertex\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Dear Carl, how should I assess your comment?\r\n\r\nMy question was serious.
    I\u2019m part of a team which is preparing an expert\u2019s report on Financing
    Models of FTTH Open Access Networks in the EU. Besides the content we are looking
    for a typeface that covers all European languages as well as technical and mathematical
    symbols in a unique and consistent form. \r\n"

  body: Well, if it were a question of cost, there's no question Gentium is cheaper.
    Will you be needing boldface? I think Gentium's only regular and italic at this
    point.

  body: "As I mentioned it\u2019s not a question of cost. My question is if somebody
    knows if Andron \u201Cholds its promises\u201D. I didn\u2019t consider that Gentium
    has no bold weight \u2013 a reason to exclude it.  \r\n\r\nSince now you can imagine
    my requirements you may even propose an alternative.\r\n"

    Latin?

  body: "Sorry, Arno,\r\n\r\nI had not seen Andron before and I'm impressed. Also,
    nobody had replied, and I didn't want the thread to get lost. \r\n\r\nI have not
    used Andron, but there are many who have; could you contact any of the publishers
    of other publications, named on the Andron website? One or another of them could
    provide you with samples for evaluation. "

  body: "Double WOW! I have never seen that font before ever. Very beautiful.\r\n\r\nGentium
    has just been undated (BETA) to include a bold weight. There are so specialized
    book weights.\r\n\r\nhttp://scripts.sil.org/cms/scripts/page.php?site_id=nrsi&item_id=Gentium_basic\r\n\r\nAndron
    is pretty but as mentioned you need PDF's for evaluation, it could in fact be
    too delicate for your situation. Gentium is very sturdy.\r\n\r\nMikey :-)"

    assuming you must have already ruled Minion out for one reason or another.
