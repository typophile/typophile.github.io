body: 'okay so i&#39;m trying to get family font-naming down and I&#39;m following
  &#40;or at least trying to follow&#41; Adam Twardoch&#39;s &#34;Font Family Naming
  in FontLab&#34; but I&#39;m having some problems. <BR>First of all Adam&#39;s font
  naming scheme is working wonderfully for TTF fonts, but i&#39;m having the following
  problems with PS versions: <BR>Let&#39;s say the font family name is &#34;XYZ Fontname&#34;
  <BR>In Indesign separate styles are being split up in the menu, ie. small caps,
  light version, etc. <BR>Also the Regular versions are showing up in the the menu
  as &#34;XYZ Fontname&#34; and then in the style menu as &#34;Fontname Regular,&#34;
  &#34;Fontname Italic,&#34; etc. I just want the &#34;Regular&#34; and &#34;Italic&#34;
  to show up. If anyone can help me out, I&#39;d appreciate it. Thnx.'

  body: A couple of extra suggestions/comments. <BR> <BR>- make sure that the PostScript
    FullName includes the style, even for the &#34;regular&#34; face. <BR> <BR>- Make
    sure the PostScript FontName uses a dash between the family and the style. The
    family part should be the same as the family part of the FullName, with spaces
    omitted. <BR>   If you had the dash after XYZ and before Fontname I could imagine
    that might have the effect you mention. <BR> <BR>Regards, <BR> <BR>T

  body: hmmm <BR>that&#39;s how i&#39;ve had things set up with the FullName and FontName
    fields and there&#39;se no dash after XYZ and before Fontname. I&#39;m trying
    to figue out where InD is pulling font names from because what it&#39;s displaying
    isn&#39;t in any of the naming fields at all... strange.

  body: It&#39;s hard to say without having a look, but don&#39;t forget to <BR>run
    Font Cache Cleaner when you&#39;re testing font names. <BR>OSX caches the names
    and then tortures you with them later. <BR>That is, if you&#39;re using said OS.

  body: 'One extra suggestion: <BR> <BR>Avoid to start the family name with multiple
    capital letters in FontLab 4.x/Mac &#40;like &#34;XYZFontname&#34;&#41; . This
    may result in improper ps file names. And surely the safer way to prepare all
    names is to click on the &#34;Build Names&#34; button. <BR> <BR>Johnych'
