  body: "Hrant, you clearly don\u2019t read Typophile on many different devices, otherwise
    you would notice that inserting line breaks by hand to make your paragraphs nicer
    do not always reflow well on different settings, making your efforts not only
    pointless, but counterproductive. Not picking-on here, just saying."

  body: "Grzegorz, that's actually what I'm trying to resolve:\r\nhttp://typophile.com/node/88503#comment-488380\r\n\r\nHowever
    I do think your conclusion is simplistic. To\r\nme the point of a block of text
    isn't to look nice, it's to\r\nbe read. So I have to wonder what's worse: a paragraph\r\nthat's
    hard to read on most devices (because the lines\r\nare way too long) or one that
    looks funny on some? Sure\r\nfunny lines aren't great, but missing the line return\r\nevery
    single time (or in practice, having to do the line\r\nreturn very slowly in order
    to avoid missing the landing)\r\nis worse. Most long posts (i.e. posts that contain
    long\r\nparagraphs) on Typophile are quite daunting to read\r\nbecause they look
    like that slab from Space Odyssey.\r\n\r\nHence the question I pose here. So if
    enough people view\r\nTypophile on small screens what I should ideally do is go\r\neven
    narrower on my measure. More work for me (because\r\nit gets harder to have a
    non-distracting rag), but hey, that's\r\nwhat Design is about.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    I am now on a Mini with a Flatron LG screen. Other times I am on a MacBook Pro
    and I can also be on a mini with a 25'' Mac screen. The log does not tell that.
    I can also be on an iPad, during the week end. '
