  Dominicanen shop in Maastricht - The Netherlands. This store is located in a 13-th
  century church and is generally considered one of the most beautiful book stores
  in the world. You can read about the visit and see additional pictures [[http://www.prepressure.com/blog/photography/selexyz-dominicanen-bookstore|here]].\r\n\r\n<a
