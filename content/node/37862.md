  Florence, via Rome, in early January. Ideally I'd like to drag her to as many typographic
  points of interest as possible during this trip. \r\n\r\nThere's already a lot of
  info here on what's available in Rome and Florence, but I've also got my eye on
  the Bodoni Museum in Parma. Looking at the maps, it would seem possible to get to
  Parma from Florence by rail, but I'm going to assume it will take a bunch of money
  and time. My question is, to any who have visited this museum, is it worth the trip?
  Thanks-"

    if you want to visit the Museo Bodoniano.\r\nAn alternative could be a cozy room
    in one of the <a href=\"http://www.cinqueterre.it/en/ct1.html\">Five Lands</a>."

  body: "I\u2019d say it is worth a detour. Parma is a small city, it is not too touristic
    and very beautiful\u2013like most of the medieval north italian cities. \r\n\r\nThe
    museum is situated in the ducal palace which is dominating the center. You can
    still feel the atmosphere of the times when Bodoni was working there as the king
    of typographers. Bodoni\u2019s elegant books, his tools, punches and characters
    together with the exhibition regarding the history of the book is worth a visit.\r\n\r\nThe
    museum is open in the morning from 9 am to 1 pm, but you should make an appointment!!!!
    Tel. 00390521/220411, Fax 00390521/235662, E-mail:mubodoni@unipr.it Maybe someone
    who speaks english can show you around (some of the students who are working at
    the library in the palace? \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    a friend of mine was telling me about a hiking trip he took that sounds a lot
    like the Five Lands. I don't know how long we'll be in Italy yet, but we'll consider
    anything at this point."

    locations..." and "honeymoon" too closely. Unless, of course, she is a type geek,
    then it might actually enhance the honeymoon. ;^)
