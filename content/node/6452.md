body: I put this together and immediately had some sort of ethereal recolection but
  I can&#39;t place the icon with a name of a company. Do you know if this icon already
  exists in a logo and if so what company it belongs to?<img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/47905.gif"

  body: Adam did you try a Google search? Also It might only be a registered name
    in one country.

  body: '<i>Adam did you try a Google search?</i> <BR> <BR>Daniel, how do you do a
    Google search for an icon? That would indeed be a killer feature: paste in a picture,
    and we&#39;ll do pattern matching to find images similar to it. <BR> <BR>I don&#39;t
    think they have it yet, though.'

  body: Of course, I realize that. But what if the logo was for a real estate company,
    or a construction firm &#40;since it does look like a house&#41;? It gets much
    harder the more abstract the logo gets.  <BR> <BR>Darrel, you aren&#39;t really
    searching for the images, but rather the <i>name</i> of the image. I think there
    ought to be some rought pattern matching ability out there that would allow a
    next-generation Google to offer what I described.  <BR> <BR>And it&#39;s not just
    images. Imagine a search engine that would allow you to match &#34;That song that
    goes, dun-dun-dun-dah...&#34; Right now, you have to know the artist, or &#40;part
    of&#41; the title, or understand the lyrics enough to search for those. <BR> <BR>Sorry,
    I&#39;m drifting off topic <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"

    have not been able to find anything similar.

    matching for you. You&#39;d call in on your cell phone and hum a few bars and
    it&#39;d find the song for you.  <BR> <BR>This, of course, was during the dot-com
    boom where ideas like this were actually thought to make money. ;o&#41;'

    flipping through my business card folder, and I came across a card I have from
    someone with the VEA group. Their logo looks like this: <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/49542.jpg"

    it- I just found it. <BR> <BR>&#40;Though, a meek part of me has to admit I&#39;m
    currently designing a logo for a client who insisted on a swoop being integrated...
