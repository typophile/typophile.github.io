body: "Please can somebody help me for the Melissa font set. Ulrich Stiehl told me
  that he has already checked that neither Linotype/Monotype/FontShop nor www.fonts.com
  nor www.myfonts.com supply this font, but perhaps a small typefoundry has digitized
  the font Melissa and sells it under another name.\r\nI\u2019m looking for a special
  occassion to the \u201CMelissa Inline von Letragraphica LG2320\u201D from 1977 designed
  by Douglas Sheldrake \r\n\r\nPlease look to the inserted image for the right Melissa
  font.\r\nMaybe there are other fonts with the same name \u201CMelissa\u201D, because
  there are also other completely different fonts also called \u201CMelissa\u201D.
  For example, Compugraphic called its forgery of Zapf\u2019s Melior as \u201CMelissa\u201D.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/melissa_4809.jpg]\r\n\r\nIts
  no problem to buy the fontset. Please let me know if somebody can help me.\r\n\r\nThanks
  for your concerns.\r\n\r\nBest Regards,\r\n\r\nLouis van der Veer\r\nNetherlands\r\n\r\n\r\n"
