  body: "The f definitely looks like a custom edit...looks like it's been edited to
    make it into an 8, or infinity symbol. The dots on the i's* might be custom edited
    too.\r\n\r\nAs for font, I dunno. It's too slanted to be Book Antiqua, although
    that makes a close approximation otherwise. Close, almost certainly not exact.
    I'll leave this for the experts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n* Note: the only case in English
    where you're allowed to pluralize with an apostrophe\r\n\r\nPeace,\r\nJT"

  body: okay, I scanned through my system fonts again and have come to the conclusion
    that it's Lucida Calligraphy....though obviously not the "f".
