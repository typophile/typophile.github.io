  with <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/fontfont/ff_avance/\">Avance</a>?
  Seems to me like they should compliment each other well; I'd be curious to hear
  some experiences/opinions.\r\n\r\nAlso, would it be considered sacrilegious to use
  Legato (presumably the Regular) for a large (~96pt) poster headline? I've used it
  for text (and in a logo) so far, but it seems like a great fit here \u2013 especially
  since the headline should feel a bit \"uncomfortable\", or \"unusual\" (although
  very \"quietly\" so), rather than \"pretty\".\r\n\r\nSo if I go with Legato in the
  headline, I'm wondering if I should use a heavier weight of Legato for the smaller
  text, but I've been wondering if Avance might not be the perfect companion to Legato
  here; this is science/education-related, so I have a vague feeling that not having
  all text in a sans face might appeal to the client more. Plus, I admit I'm sorta
  in love with both of them!"

    he didn't like it very much. On the other hand it's pretty safe to ignore the
    wishes of type designers when it come to actually <em>using</em> fonts!  :-)\r\n\r\nI
    personally still like Avance, and I think it can work for longish text just as
    good as Legato, thanks to its [half] serifs*. I've seen Legato used in two books,
    one of them only for titles (and that was intended as an \"unsettling\" book too)
    the other for titles and text. I think Legato looks quite nice large, so I think
    you should try using it exclusively for this project - it should be able to carry
    the whole weight by itself. The only problem is if the project is supposed to
    be serious (in addition to unsettling) in which case Legato might be too friendly;
    except that would disqualify Avance even more. If that's the case, and you want
    to stick with Bloemsma, try out Balance (preferably remove the trapping though).\r\n\r\n*
    A serif incarnation of Legato, now <em>that</em>\r\nwould be the highest peak
    in the craft.\r\n\r\nBTW, can I get a copy of the booklet too?\r\nPlease? Pretty
    please with diacritics on it?\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "<em>\"I think the two are too similar to work together well. Legato almost
    seems like a sans serif version of Avance, which it isn\u2019t at closer inspection.\"</em>\r\nJan,
    I've been wondering about this exact question. I'm just not sure if they really
    are *too* similar; I'm thinking it may work well if I pull them apart somewhat
    (literally/distance-wise as well as in terms of size contrast, and maybe weight
    contrast)\u2026\r\nI'm never sure about pairing fonts \u2013 I've found I tend
    to pick out different combinations than other designers I know. I think some designs
    can benefit from the fonts being just a tiny bit bitchy with one another. And
    sometimes you want total harmony. But to be honest, I often think that ends up
    being more boring than it'd need to be.\r\nLast night I tried pairing Patria with
    Avance (not at poster sizes though!). That felt highly volatile. But quite interesting.
    Although I can't help but feel any \"proper\" (established) designer would probably
    whack me in the head for that.\r\n\r\nHrant, do you know why Bloemsma ended up
    disliking Avance? Is it because it's more \"traditional\" than Legato? I'd love
    to read more on that.\r\n\r\n<em>\"The only problem is if the project is supposed
    to be serious (in addition to unsettling) in which case Legato might be too friendly\"</em>\r\nExactly!
    I tried using Legato for the whole thing, and it started looking a weird mixture
    of slightly off-beat and strange, and quite amiable. And the poster is for a multi-disciplinary
    university conference on symbolism and aesthetics of sacrificial rituals (maybe
    I'm overstating the strangeness of that, but it doesn't feel like Legato in text
    to me).\r\nFF Balance looks quite interesting too! And it does seem to look a
    bit less \"friendly\" \u2013 although also more \"normal\" (= less strange). And
    I think I'm not a big fan of the \"g\" (see I'm rationalizing not being able to
    licence another font right away :-] ).\r\n\r\n<em>\"BTW, can I get a copy of the
    booklet too?\"</em>\r\nYes you can, Hrant. This is the one with Sangue on the
    cover (and a thank-you to Typophile in the colophon btw). But it's still going
    to take a few weeks until I get them."

  body: "> do you know why Bloemsma ended up disliking Avance?\r\n\r\nI don't remember
    if he said anything specific. It was probably the case of a highly intellectual
    designer becoming dissatisfied with a previous design philosophy, especially since
    he was making large ideological strides.\r\n\r\nI remember when he cagily showed
    me previews of Avance in 1999, he said that he didn't like stroke contrast - he
    couldn't understand why it was helpful. But in Legato it's central. He was the
    sort of designer who needed to rationalize his choice, not merely mimic precedent
    - a Designer with a capital D.\r\n\r\n> I\u2019m not a big fan of the \u201Cg\u201D\r\n\r\nFix
