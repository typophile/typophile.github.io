  needs this logo in vector for an exhibition, but all they have is this .png.\r\nIt
  would be easy to make, as long as I could identify the font.\r\nAnyone who can help
  me out?"

  body: If all you need is a vector image place the .png into Adobe Illustrator and
    autotrace it. With a little clean-up afterwords you would probably be done in
    an hour or so. The image included while flawed was done in less than 5 minutes
    which included starting Illustrator. [img:sites/default/files/old-images/OriginalResopal_4807.png]

  body: "Agreed, but since I have to expand a small .png to a 3 mtrs wide board, I'm
    afraid little tracing flaws will be visible. Was kinda hoping it would be a handwritten
    font.\r\nAlas, I seem to have no other option... ;-("
