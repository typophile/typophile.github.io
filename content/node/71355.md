    two versions of the face, one for text, one for display.\r\n\r\n"

  body: "yes, it is Haptic, or what Haptic used to be. Their lead agency DDB Melbourne
    and atf.com.au modified it without my consent, even though the EULA states that
    this is not allowed. I contacted them about it, but neiter DDB nor ATF have answered
    my mails. I am quite unsure what I can actually do about it, since they are ignoring
    me. They changed some design features (cut off the italic f and the bottom bar
    of the regular one ...) and the name and I don't know how they are distributing
    the new font around. Any ideas what I could do?\r\n\r\nThanks \r\nHenning"

  body: "Henning, I concur with Stephen.\r\n \r\nSome agencies take liberties with
    fonts, because they don't know any better. But they should, if they are playing
    in the big league, with blue-chip clients who are paying them big bucks and expecting
    them to be copacetic with regards to intellectual property.\r\n\r\n(I have had
    agency art directors approach me on several occasions, asking if I would adapt
    a third-party font for a client of theirs, and have had to explain the legalities
    involved.)"
