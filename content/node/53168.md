  arch in a circle (as opposed to oval).  We got it looking nice with a san serif
  face, but want to present either an italic serif or a script.\r\n\r\nMy gut says
  this is a fruitless endeavor but I am wondering if you have seen logos/examples
  where it has been done successfully?\r\n\r\nThanks in advance.\r\n\r\nBest,\r\nPeter.\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: 'I wouldn''t (necessarily) put script, something like Bickham for instance,
    on a curve. But you could probably get away with something like Coquette which
    is upright. I also wouldn''t (necessarily) put an italic on a curve. Same problem.
    You''ve already got the angle happening and then you put it on a curve and it
    starts to look twisted. '
