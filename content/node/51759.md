body: "Hi there! I\u2019m currently working on this typeface, named Lanita (in old
  bulgarian - \"cheek\"). So, here is my attempt for: regular letters (capital and
  small), old style numbers, latin ligatures and plucky try for cyrillic ligatures.
  I really want to know your opinion about them. Also, and for this typeface at all.
  Each comment will be valuable!\r\n\r\n[[http://ipopov.net/vector/wip_lanita_1.jpg|Lanita

  body: First glance - looks pretty good and usable. I'll have to look at it over
    a longer period of time before I can add anything else. I guess that means there's
    nothing bad standing out yet to me. :-) Hopefully you'll get some others to comment
    soon.
