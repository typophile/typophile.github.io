body: "Hello! For my first post, I'd like to introduce you to the work of a group
  of designers I teach.\r\n\r\nThe first project this semester in <a href=\"http://tannerwoodford.com/syllabus/2010s\">Advanced
  Media</a>, a course in the <a href=\"http://design.asu.edu/sdi/\">School of Design
  Innovation</a> at <a href=\"http://www.asu.edu\">Arizona State University</a>, was
  to create a 30-60 second typographic film, with copyright-free audio, based on a
  quote received on the first day of class. The first half of the four-week project
  was spent collaborating with a group of 7-8 peers to make and refine typography-inspired
  concepts. After this process, the students chose the best of three concepts, then
  spent two weeks executing it as a group. A well-rounded concept was emphasized.
  \r\n\r\nFollowing is the work that has been created thus far.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://typophile.com/node/68263\">Lemon

    we talked about inviting his students to post their videos for critique. Please
    take a moment and check them out, and let's give them some feedback!

    and a class in the preceding semester.

  body: I only watched one film and didn't comment (following the "if you don't have
    anything nice to say" rule...which I'm clearly now breaking) but in response to
    Tomi...students need to experiment in/with various mediums in order to find their
    passion. Sure, it's not the best I've seen but there are a few of my own student
    projects I shake my head at today.

  body: "I have to agree with Jennifer - school is exactly the right time to be experimenting
    with techniques and mediums. \r\n\r\nIn regard to critiquing the work, I find
    it very difficult to comment on purely subjective terms. Your assignment [based
    on what I read] is to produce a piece of self expression by making a short movie
    based off of a quote. Based on that criteria, they've all succeeded.\r\n\r\nTo
    be brutally honest, I think you've been too precious with the brief. Two weeks
    to come up with a concept is luxury they will probably never experience again.
    I would have liked to see what they could have accomplished given less time and
    more to do. Maybe they would have been more experimental since they wouldn't be
    as concerned with absolutely nailing it. I have discovered that over the course
    of my career, a vast majority of my best work has been created 'under the gun'.
    When given the time and the numbers involved, you get a committee.\r\n\r\nThat
    would be my critique of the work, they feel born of a committee. I would have
    liked to see something where they tried something ambitious and failed, or succeeded
    spectacularly. Either way is correct for this point in their education."

  body: "Yeah, two weeks for the concepts seem way too long.\r\n\r\n1-2 days for a
    rough concept, with the students presenting their basic idea in rough sketches,
    maybe another 2 days to refine it. Then the rest of the time for execution. Maybe
    you could even cut down the whole thing to 3 weeks.\r\nThat would condense the
    work and I\u2019m quite sure it would rather be a gain than a loss for the project.\r\n\r\nEdit:
    Oh, and I don\u2019t think that a student project has to be perfect in terms of
    concept or execution. It\u2019s about the process of creating something in a predefined
    frame of time and context. This is so much more relevant than creating bling-bling
    award winning student films, entirely edited and dictated by professionals in
    order to make it look more professional, with the students putting their names
    on it in order to plug their school."

    because critique here is both honest and informed. I've had my ass chewed here,
    but that has been for a reason. This community is about typography and type design,
    and most of us are professionals in those fields. It is not fair to put student
    work for critique here."

    you) I couldn't think of ANYTHING positive to say. But I think we should be welcoming
    to students. \r\n\r\nStudents should consider themselves lucky to be critiqued
    by award winning professionals in the fields they wish to compete in. It's completely
    fair to critique student work. As the professionals I think we should encourage
    exploration.\r\n\r\nPerhaps I misunderstood your statement but it appeared as
    though you suggested they shouldn't explore a medium they hadn't mastered and
    that seems to go against the spirit of learning that is encouraged here. "

  body: "Hello! \r\n\r\nFirst of all, thank you for taking the time to watch our videos;
    I very much appreciate it! I am Angie Copolillo of the \"Typographic Video\" team.
    I'm excited to have our work here, and excited for the opportunity to learn and
    grow as a designer. \r\n\r\nI've been following this thread closely, and I wonder
    if the problem is that we won't be welcome to any criticism. I know that, at least
    for me, this isn't the case. You've said that you have a hard time finding things
    to compliment...well, that's all right. We're not looking for pats on the back.
    :-)  \r\n\r\nCan you tell us what might need to be improved? Essays aren't required,
    of course, but simply saying, \"It ALL needs work\" isn't quite helpful, even
    if it's how you feel. \r\n\r\nIt might be good to pick one thing you saw and give
    us tips on how to improve it. As you can probably tell, I know that I am still
    VERY MUCH a beginner to Flash, AfterEffects, and editing in general! So even the
    most basic of suggestions would be perfect.\r\n\r\nThank you again for your time!
    It's great to have you as a resource. :-)\r\n\r\nSincerely, \r\nAngie Copolillo\r\nGraphic

  body: "I'll try to make it simple Ton,\r\n\r\nWhat I was trying to get across with
    my murky sentence was basically this: The verbal meanings of the quotations didn't
    seem to relate heavily to the visual choices made in some of the videos, and nor
    did the stories / scenarios / narrative arcs. \r\n\r\nThis is not a problem for
    a piece of art (where folks often won't even agree on criteria for evaluation).
    I think it can be a problem for design, however.\r\n\r\nDesign (in the sense of
    visual communications) is judged on how well the designer's choices reenforce
    the communicative intent (the core thing the design is trying to get across).
    Choices in, for example, typography, color, scale, repetition, space, sequence,
    tempo, rhythm, transition, speed, duration, sound, et cetera, all build toward
    a coherent vision, or they don't. They all work together to establish a certain
    sensibility / tone / mood / aura, or they don't. (I keep thinking of great film
    title designs and how they communicate a concept, or a tone that introduces and
    reenforces the theme of a film\u2014The dizzy twists of \"Vertigo,\" or the slow,
    foreboding typographic architecture of \"Panic Room\" for example). I'll say it
    again, though: The videos look like fun, experimental student work.\r\n"

  body: "Hello to everyone, \r\n\r\nWe are young designers, very well still learning,
    and helpful feedback allows us to grow. \r\n\r\nOn the comments that 'two weeks
    may seem a long time for concept development', in actuality it is only 4 classes
    (we meet twice a week). Our class consists of a very diverse group of designers,
    so when asked to have 8 designers agree on one idea, it was a bit challenging
    for us. Each member came up with multiple concepts. After that, the group members
    combined multiple ideas or voted on which concept to move forward with. \r\n\r\nAs
    I have seen some comments stating 'you can not comment on these videos', is neither
    helpful nor justified. We are open and welcome to hear the positive/negative comments,
    yet criticism should entail explanations so we can understand that point-of-view.
    We are honored to have criticism by professionals in the design field. Yet, I
    think a true professional would give constructive criticism with justification,
    especially to students who are trying to learn.\r\n\r\nThank you to those who
    have taken the time out of their day to give our video's constructive criticism,
    it will help us in the editing process.\r\n\r\nErin"
