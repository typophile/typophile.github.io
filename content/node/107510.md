  body: "I suspect the sign is lettering not a font as such.  But I would be happy
    to learn of a matching font.\r\nThe lettering looks like something like _John
    Hancock_ -- Keystone Type Foundry, circa 1903, and condensed version  by Lanston
    Monotype, circa 1917, digitized by Claude Pelletier http://www.dafont.com/john-hancock-cp.font
    -- meets early 20th century lettering for the _ g_. Here is one variation by Speedball
    with a bottom heavy _g_.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Speedball17_21WashingtonSM_6692.jpg]\r\nWhat
    is the relationship between the sign and Harper's Weekly?\r\nAnother bottom heavy
    _g_, from a 1921 Motor Tours book:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/MotorTours1921_5266.jpg]\r\nDon"

  body: "Hi Don\r\n\r\nThank you so much for your input.\r\nIf memory serves, it was
    taken from an add for Williamsons(?) shaving soap, circa 1915 or so I would guess.\r\nAs
    the font is not entirely regular, I thought it may have been hand rendered but
    your leads for similar are very helpful. Apart from the 'g' it was the truncated
    't' that grabbed me. :)\r\n"

  body: "Hi Steve. This was a golden age of lettering, with impressionist variations
    in letterforms. Check out the bottom heavy_g_ in these specimens designed cira
    1915. \r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/LiteraryDigestFunk&Wagnals1915caSM_4595.jpg][img:sites/default/files/old-images/GoodHousekeeping1914SM_6711.jpg][img:sites/default/files/old-images/GoodHousekeeping1914bSM_5051.jpg]\r\nFor
    the second Good Housekeeping the bottom heavy _g_ is in the author's name.\r\nFinding
    fonts to do justice to your sample, or these letters is a real challenge. They
    are all opportunities to ambitious font makers.\r\nDon"
