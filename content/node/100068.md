body: "Hello Typophiles, its been a while since I have posted on here.\r\n\r\nThis
  is the first time I have seriously tried to design a font, I'm 20 and a student,
  previously I have flirted half-heartedly or edited existing faces. So I would really
  appreciate some feedback (please be gentle, this is my first time at the rodeo).\r\n\r\nThe
  working title for this font is Lombard, but I have a feeling I am going to change
  it. I was inspired by a pair of unique street signs in my home town of Wellington,
  but through further development I found myself looking at the type used in the Tintin
  magazines of my childhood. I can also definitively say Colophone's incredible [[http://www.colophon-foundry.org/fonts/raisonne/about-font|Raisonne]]
  and [[http://www.grillitype.com|Grilli Type's entire catalogue]] were guiding hands
  as to the boundaries between feature and distraction.\r\n\r\nI am placing this post
  in the Display section, for obvious reasons. I position this as an interesting alternative
  to the many condensed slabs that people use perhaps a little too often these days.\r\n\r\nOverall
  I'm quite happy with the result, but I know that there is a fair amount of work
  left to do; small caps, a lighter weight and perhaps an outlined version is in order
  I think.\r\n\r\nPlease let me know what you think, dying to hear.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/lombard_12_6170.gif]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/lombard_11_4857.gif]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/lombard-head_3427.gif]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/lombard-head2_3848.gif]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/lombard_8_3942.gif]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/lombard_7_5020.gif]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/lombard_6_4818.gif]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/lombard_5_4222.gif]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/lombard_4_4456.gif]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/lombard_3_4724.gif]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/lombard_2_5538.gif]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/lombard_1_3451.gif]"

  body: "I'm not sure if you are still looking for a critique, but here is mine. \r\n\r\nAt
    first glance the font didn't  impress me, but the more I looked at it the more
    I liked it. I like that the K is so much wider than the R and P, and that the
    bottom of the R sticks out further than the top. I think that is what gives it
    it's quiet and simple charm. My only problem is the W, every time I read through
    your samples it stops me, it just seems to heavy. I don't know how to solve it,
    lucky for me that is the designers job.\r\n\r\nI wish my first font would have
    turned out this nice. I would really love to see the finished version."

  body: I like the playfulness of this. For some reason the 'A' stands out to me as
    not quite fitting. Not that there is any problem with the 'A', just that it does
    not have the same character as the other letters.
