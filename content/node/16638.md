  speak/read? \r\n\r\nSupposing you want to test your font with a \u0151, or \u014A,
  or \u0127. How do you like to test these? I have started using google to find pages
  that use glyphs I am unfamilar with and I found this:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.websters-online-dictionary.org/definition/Maltese-english/\r\n\r\nWhich
  showed me \u0127amster ( hampster in english).\r\n\r\nBut even if I do this for
  each glyph that is unfamiliar to me I suspect that I may miss atypical or challenging
  combinations of glyphs that I might know about if I spoke or read the langauge.
  And/or I may favor typical use in one language over the other. \r\n\r\nThis site
  is a great references but it don't supply very much insight into context & use of
  glyphs\r\nhttp://www.eki.ee/letter/\r\n\r\nHappily there is some terrific help from
  these two sites where Icelandic & Polish is concerned: \r\n\r\nhttp://briem.ismennt.is/\r\n\r\nhttp://www.twardoch.com/download/polishhowto/intro.html\r\n\r\nBut
  are there other sites? Does anybody have a stock of strategies, test words/phrases
  they might be willing to talk about & or share?\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\n  "

  body: "Resurrecting this thread only to mention and bring up new discussion perhaps
    on unicode.org's availability of the UDHR <em>as text</em> for the oodles of languages
    for which it has been translated.  Since most of the versions also have a PDF
    version available, you can test a font with the text version to compare with the
    \"actual version\" to test look for display issues, which might be more important
    for connected scripts (Arabic) or those who are not stored in the same order they
    are displayed (Indic).  \r\n\r\nBut, of course, it gives all of the text, but
    with slightly more assurances on proper encoding, since it is done by the Unicode
    Consortium.\r\n\r\n<em>\xABEl futuro es una l\xEDnea tan fina que apenas nos damos
