  that not a single movie title was set in Trajan.\r\nIMO this is part of a general
  trend to more and better typography. I have my theories on that, but right now I'm
  wondering, are there any particular reasons, structural or cultural, for Hollywood's
  sudden typographic sophistication?"

    Black caps, in red, sometimes with a yellow outline. They seem to have moved away
    from that too in recent months.

    box-office take against trends around Trajan poster use.  \r\n\r\nAlso perhaps
    Trajan's Wall Street associations are hurting it. "

    found out and so all the designers dumped them before they got caught. And since
    there is a recession, spending has been cut off  and they cannot afford to buy
    legal copies : )\r\n\r\nMichael"

    old typefaces and trajan 'em in.
