  most part). I am going in for an interview sometime this week, and they want to
  see a business card designed in their style. They sent me a a couple posters for
  examples of their style. \r\n\r\nPoster 1\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/shriverposter_4872.jpg]\r\n\r\nPoster
  2\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/cityscape3c_5615.jpg]\r\n\r\nMy Business
  Cards\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/shrivercenter_card_5802.jpg]\r\n\r\nI
  am just looking for any suggestions for improvements. I am looking for things such
  as:\r\n\r\nDoes the style match the posters?\r\nIs the imformation easily readable?\r\n\r\nPlease
  feel free to be picky, I can take criticism. Constructive Criticism."

  body: "\"mirroring\" seems to be some \"common line\" in their style.\r\nyou could
    try to integrate that more in your cards.\r\n\r\nAnd: they never have information
    side by side, always top to bottom and hierarchically structured (the more to
    the bottom, the less important).\r\n\r\nConsidered to create a card in portrait
    orientation?\r\n\r\n\r\nTry to explain your analysis and thoughts when presenting
    them. Say what you saw, and explain how this results in your cards. It's at least
    as important to show your ideas and thoughts as the cards themselves."

  body: "A business card isn't a poster! It's really important to remember that when
    you want to design something that works. Remember to communicate the information
    first and foremost.\r\n\r\nMost important\u2026 Keep it simple! Trying to cram
    images on doesn't work. I would suggest name (logo) on one side and details on
    the other. If you insist on putting an image on it, try keep it only on one side
    maybe with the logo.\r\n\r\n<em>Mirroring</em> on a business card? It probably
    won't come out! As a good friend once said to me. <em>Lets not jump up on the
    apple band wagon!!</em>"

  body: "I would go in there and tell them that their visual identity is hopelessly
    confused and dreary. They yearn to appear credible and authoritative but at the
    same time approachable and modern. The cliches have been chucked together with
    no real or deep thought as to what an identity is. This kind of thing depresses
    me.  \r\n\r\nhaving said that, your cards are neither here nor there. If you are
    attempting to replicate their style you should center the logo. You should use
    the correct colours. Use a gradient rather than flat. look at the space you have
    created - the middle one is crammed in the left and empty in the right.  The vertical
    spacing on the other two needs a lot of work - the name on the third one is in
    danger of being guillotined and the first isn't much better. And I agree with
    the others about the use of imagery. \r\n\r\nIf you are trying to show them something
    new, well, you should depart much much further from where you are at the moment.\r\n\r\nI
    don't want to sound like an arsehole but they need a lot of work - Learn to use
    white space, love white space, have white space's babies and breast-feed them
    till they're 17."

  body: Although what they have is pretty bad, going in there and telling them so
    won't score you any points. I would take the best element from that poster, which
    IMO is the blue bar with the type, and use only that on the cards. Drop the clip
    art people and skyline photo. Keep the information clean and easy to read. Also,
    whatever you show them, make sure the colors match what they have now. You might
    also try using that blue all over the card as another option, and reverse the
    type. I would also suggest you take a look at some good business card designs
    to get an idea of layout and arrangement of type. Good luck.

    a department that lacks style and asks interns to do spec work to get hired.

  body: "Thank you all for your advice! And yes, I agree with all of you that say
    this isn't exactly design agency professional work. BUT this is sadly the design
    style that curses many business' based in Microsoft word. Everyone has their own
    style. At the end of the day...the client is always right...what they like is
    what they want you to do...unless they ask for something different.\r\n\r\nIn
    this case, they specifically picked out 2 files to send me to show me their style.
    I could only imagine that they are not looking to change, and that they are happy.\r\n\r\nChris
    Keegan: Thanks a lot for your critique. I agree fully. That's the direction I
    was originally going to go...getting rid of the all the \"graphics\" and just
    use the logo and gradient reverse. I think they graphics are awful...but I was
    looking around campus, and at least these graphics are consistent, so they do
    serve as a sort of identity...sadly. I am a born minimalist...If I could get away
    with telling an entire story with 3 words...I would :D\r\n\r\nAluminum: I don't
    need this internship to learn about design, I've been an ad designer for over
    2 years now. To me, it's more for the experience to work in different places doing
    different things before I graduate in December. As for the business card...I don't
    think they are actually going to use it. I don't think they can. I think they
    have to use the \"UMBC BUSINESS CARD\" and just have their department name on
    a specific part. So that's what leads me to believe this is more about seeing
    if they can find someone to match their style...business card being the smallest,
    but most powerful way to see that, considering that it shows how you organize
    your information and how well you do with matching fonts/styles/colors.\r\n\r\nBut
    enough talk, I will be going back to my computer tonight to rethink this. haha.
    I should be going in for the interview sometime this week, so we'll see.\r\n\r\nThanks
    again!\r\ncourtney"

  body: "Here are three versions. I used the the same type of information layout in
    the three.\r\n\r\nThe first vertical: I think this one mimics their style more
    so...but it's my least favorite of the three.\r\n\r\nThe second vertical: A bit
    more playful. Out of all of them, this would be my favorite. It sort of takes
    their style and uses it in a bit more elegant way, rather than making it look
    like it was done in Word.\r\n\r\nThe horizontal: The safest. It gets the job done,
    it get across the information and uses their \"logo\". Next to the posters, you'd
    be able to tell they are related. But it's too safe for my taste...almost too
    obvious of a solution. But who know, this might be the best out of them all.\r\n\r\nI'd
    love to hear everyone's critiques on these cards. Suggestions are always welcome
    as well. Please constructive criticism.\r\n\r\n\r\ncourtney\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/businesscards_1_4647.jpg]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/businesscard_2_5003.jpg]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/businesscards_3_5173.jpg]"

    to hear. The client isn't always right! It is your job as a designer to show them
    that they are going in the wrong direction.\r\n\r\nThe best designers know how
    to communicate. They are willing to tell the client that they are wrong every
    so often. If the client doesn't want to listen it's their problem but at least
    voice your honest opinion; if you have one.\r\n\r\nAs for the business cards they
    are not the worst I have ever seen. Are they only going to be one sided?\r\n\r\nI
    don't think you'll have any problem getting the job. The cards match the style
    exactly! Good luck!"

    clip art (in most forms) so number 1 is definitely out for me. Number 3 isn't
    bad, but as you say, it's rather an easy solution.\r\n\r\nI like Bobby's idea
    of doing a couple \"their\" way and then maybe doing one or two other variations
    how <em>you</em> would do it. After all, I think that's what they want to get
    out of this anyway (<em>your</em> design sense).\r\n\r\npenn"

  body: "My first freelance job was redesigning a cookie label on cellophane for a
    Turkish importer (to the US) of food products. The company that makes the cookies
    attempted to make the label in English too, but It was a lot like reading the
    packaging at a Chinese grocery store in the US. (\"Horse Bean Snack Keep You Joyful
    Best!\") His idea was that it needed to be \"really classy\".\r\n\r\nFor a hundred
    dollars, I probably spent 6 weeks going back and forth debating on what the cookie
    label should look like. In the end it was probably a lot better than if he had
    simply said \"perfect\" from the start. \r\n\r\nIf it is an internship, while
    you shouldn't fight your way around, they clearly aren't buying your silence.
    If they want unpaid help from someone who is studying design, they should be willing
    to hear your ideas in between runs for coffee at the good coffee place.\r\n\r\nThe
    new ideas are better... but what happened to the navy?\r\n"

    I will also be designing an identity for some organization outside of the university,
    which is always good. And I will be designing all the materials for special events
    on campus. Oh and post-it notes, they specifically said they wanted post-it notes.
