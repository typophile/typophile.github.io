body: I was told the font used for &#34;carried away cuisine &amp; catering&#34; was
  called Handwriting Regular. But in searching for that name, I cannot find it anywhere.
  Any ideas?<img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/50052.jpg" alt="Cucina

  body: Aha ... it&#39;s a <a href="http://www.graphic-design.com/Type/Fonts-Fonts/scripts/handwrite.html"
    target="_blank"> Sam Wang font</a>. He was one of the very <BR>early shareware
    font makers &#40;like Rakowski&#41;. <BR> <BR>I wouldn&#39;t  be surprised if
    it only exists in Mac format.

  body: Yeah, I remember buying a floppy disk from him with some of his fonts in the
    early 90&#39;s. His fonts were mostly shareware, and if you registered by sending
    the fee, he sent you a disk with more fonts on it.
