<div class=commentbody>One reason is we're passionate about type.
Another is that the impersonality of written communication
causes our repressed negativism to be channeled through it.
My hope is that I -and others- can assimilate and leverage
whatever is thrown around, instead of adopting unnatural
behavior... whatever the hell that means.
And now I really need to get horizontal...

<div class=card-body>
<div class=commentbody>I don't think there is a problem with discourse and dialogue which promotes healthy exchange of differing ideas. The problem is that some people revert to personal attacks rather than just presenting more evidence supporting their own opinion. The evidence is what convinces and what spreads knowledge to others. The personal attacks just kill whatever respect people might have had for the attacker and don't win supporters of that person's point of view. Opinions and passions are fine but when they escalate to insults, nobody wins or learns.

<div class=commentbody>It’s a free group therapy session. ;^)
<strong>Typoholics Anonymous</strong> <em>in Room 101</em>
Recovering typoholics tell harrowing tales of how type ruined their lives. How their wives accused them of seeing women like [[PMN Caecilia|Caecilia]], [[ITC Tiffany|Tiffany]] and [[Mrs Eaves]] from down the road <em>or</em> whose husbands accused them of whoring about with the likes of [[Arnold Boeklin]] and the [[Duc de Berry]].
<strong>Typophile Rehabilitation</strong> <em>in Room 102</em>
The state has released these typophiles after progressively worsening and repeated type offences in the hope that some heavy handed group therapy will sort them out. Each one’s story similar to the next. How it all started with a harmless affair with a small [[Dolly]].</div>

say anything nice about you - which I do, as warranted).
But I would never ask you to not have them, or even not
express them, and I certainly wouldn't ask a moderator

body feels the need to do those things I need to tolerate
that (which is not the same thing as shutting up about it).

I have. The antidote to rage is the <a href=http://www.compassionpower.com/>power of compassion</a> and acceptance of the dignity of all, including Hrant--who deserves to be treated with respect just as do you and I.
I don't know how best to foster that spirit of compassion in Typophile discussions, but I do know that returning insults is not going to help. The best way to moderate discussions is by a moderator, but these are voluntary and have limited time. </div>

<div class=card-body>
<div class=commentbody>Typophile embodies three crafts - type design, graphic design and typography - and treats two subjects - text type and display type. Given this range, and to a lesser extent the cultural and philosophical range of the people using the site, there's a lot of fundamental disagreement.
There are two possible responses for the moderators. The liberal response is to run the site as if beliefs held by users were no more than preferences, not to be arbitrated between from above. The Aristotelian response would have it that all crafts have inherent in them a set of virtues which must be agreed upon for them to be virtues at all; that disputes concerning them should therefore normally be arbitrated as if the differing opinions held were either true or false; that crafts should be separately embodied where the virtues inherent to them clash, as they clearly do with graphic design and text design; and that in each embodiment, some kind of guild-like hierarchy of authority is required to legitimate arbitration.
Though Typophile has a formally designated ruling class, they've taken the liberal path. What follows is disagreement without the possibility of settlement, and this we see endlessly. Typophile is less valuable than it could be for the same reason in miniature that Western government is less valuable than it could be: within its field, it embodies no conception of the good.
Perhaps you didn't want quite that much detail, Patty :-)</div>

<div class=commentbody><em>returning insults is not going to help</em>
It works for me. I feel better to be dishing it out rather than enduring constant "needling", as you put it. Also, I've found that after I bite back, he eases up on me for a while. Do you really believe the victim should show compassion for his/her tormentor?
I've asked him to lay off the personal remarks (for which I am mocked for being a whiny artiste), so have moderators, but he keeps right on. You can talk about this problem in general terms, but it's rather obvious that the top dog here (200+ posts) sets the tone Patti decries, instigating most of the pissing contests and scaring away those who want to avoid them. </div>

<div class=commentbody>Nick, I know you don't expect to be criticized,
and that it hurts, but do try to pay attention
to what others are saying. I am [trying to].
> I feel better
Well, of itself that's a good reason.
But what makes a given person feel better isn't necessarily good for his society,
and a responsible "citizen" (which I'm not claiming I am, btw) minds that.
> after I bite back, he eases up on me
I don't think that's true, but if it is, that's my
weakness - I'll try to have more self-discipline.
I hope that when I ease off (again, from attacking
your ideas, if in the context of you - but not you)
it's generally because I'm bored.
> 200+ posts
I think there's an important elaboration due here: most of my posts are very short these days. If you count the number of bytes or something, I'm sure I'm not at the top. Just look at some of those big juicy threads with mega-posts, that I'm not even properly participating in. I need to take a vacation just to catch up with you guys!
Also: I'm sure you agree that I don't need to post a lot to be offensive
to you. You complain about me even when I'm not on the prolific list.

Absolutely: let's not underestimate the satisfaction of replying to aggression with aggression. In a liberal environment, it's all one's got. Long term, I really do think there should be two General Discussions fora, one for text and absolute truth, the other for graphic design and cultural difference. Posting in either should entail at least a good tourist's respect for the local world-view.</div>

Having compassion and being a patsy are two different things. I am not saying that you shouldn't respond, but I am saying that returning insults doesn't help.
You say it works for you, but I don't see the evidence. Hrant has not let up, and as you can see it doesn't work for the rest of us, who don't enjoy running across this stuff in otherwise interesting threads.
Just to be clear, even though I disagree with both you and Hrant half the time, I find you always well informed and often quite interesting. I often find Hrant interesting when he is not in a rage. </div>

George, that is one kind of relativist, soft-headed liberalism, which is unfortunately too common. But a belief in fostering a diversity of views within discussion is a traditional liberal belief that is consistent with strong values and decisions to enforce them. Among these strong values are beliefs in tolerance, civility within discussion, and non-violent ways of settling disputes. These are a part of the great liberal tradition in England and America, and I treasure them. </div>

<div class=commentbody>Bill, the values you mention are not virtues teleological to any substantive conception of the good within any practice (except that of governing an irreparably fractious society); they are, as it were, negative rather than positive values (with the exception of civility). You need more than tolerance: you need things to defend.
On the other hand, most people here actually do have a similar enough set of opinions. Where I disagree strongly I end up a contributor to some of the fights, so I doubt I'm a force for good. I'll post less in future, but Typophile is wonderful, and I'm very grateful for what I've learnt from it. Thanks everyone!</div>

<div class=commentbody>>not virtues teleological to any substantive conception of the good
First of all the virtue ethics of Aristotle is weak because it is too focused on the person. But this would take us too far afield.
In any case the values I mention do absolutely serve to promote a dynamic society in which there is social improvement and the growth of knowledge. They have done so and will continue to do so. Tolerance is not a negative value because it requires a positive structure to support free exchange of ideas. Settling disputes by non-violent means is a positive value in fostering a whole variety of democratic institutions, including elections and court of law.</div>

"Childish Pride Parade" coming soon to a city near you:
I don't know Latin so I can't come up with the phobia name for people who don't like "men who are acting like children", but if tolerance is what is being preached, why not men who act childish?
You could call this a childish idea, but whatever you say can simply be countered with the accusation that you suffer from the fear of men who act childish (this is where the Latin would come in handy), and your intolerance harkens back to burning witches at the stake, or some other ludicrous red-herring.
And if there is one thing I can't tolerate, it is people who are intolerant.

Dennis, please refrain from any further statements of this nature in the future. Such personal preferences and/or behavior have nothing to do with type design or typography and are irrelevant to the discussion at hand, or your arguments.
Many readers of these forums find off-hand statements on personality traits or lifestyles offensive.

<div class=commentbody>Patty, I personally find what I take to be Hrant's support of autocracy even more offensive than Dennis's offensive remarks about gays, as so much poverty and suffering and injustice have come from autocracies, and still do today around the world.
Frankly, I think neither should drag in their political views at every chance, but have a little mercy on the rest of us, who are not going to be swayed, and just find the repetition of these views tiresome and ugly.
However, when they do, they should not be censored. Ideally they should be ignored, but I admit that too often I've been unable to resist the temptation to respond to Hrant in particular. (Dennis is new, and I've been able to resist--so far!)
With the enlightenment of your comments, I will now just try to respond 'please leave your ugly politics outside the discussion', and leave it at that. Perhaps a hint like that now and then from a moderator might reduce the serial political ax grinding, but I don't think it should be censored.
Personal attacks, however, should be censored, because they are directly destructive of good discussion. Both Dennis's and Hrant's politics are offensive to me, but only when they turn personal should they be censored, in my view. </div>

You make a good distinction, it's true, between ugly politics and personal attacks.

<div class=commentbody>For the record, I find apologism of fascism offensive - so much of the troubles of the world <cite>today</cite> come from such attitudes. It's one of the few disgusting things on Typophile to me. I also wish that people didn't take every opportunity to slip in their religion into discussions; that's also offensive to me, although less so.
If all this seems strange, it just goes to show: we each find different things offensive, and there are demographic lines that can be drawn in this. Do we want to formally cast Typophile as being the tool and mouthpiece of a certain demographic?
Even with all the serious, fundamental things I find wrong with some members, it
would be unintelligent, unwise and dishonoroble for me to ask for their censure.

You can't claim to know such a disheartening thing.
In fact I know for sure that you're wrong.

<div class=commentbody>While my last comment came explicitly from me as a moderator, what follows is just my personal opinion…
<em>Ideally they should be ignored</em>
I think that, because too many personal insults have gone ignored recently, certain individuals may have left.
It is one thing for obscenity to be rebutted and put in its place. But when it sits uncommented upon, those directly affected are actually insulted twice… first by the insultor, and second by those who didn't step in to stop the insulting.</div>

<div class=commentbody>alright, now we're slipping into the problems we're just discussing. please don't attach politics to individuals. Hrat, William, reel it in. If you have a problem with autocracy, say so. If you have a problem with apologism of facism offensive, say so. But don't pin these ideas to people. If you have a problem with homosexuality, say you don't agree with the practice, but don't make slurs against those who are homosexuals. This is what i find offensive: when politics become personal attacks on people or groups of people. these, i think, <em>should</em> be censored. am i right or am i wrong in this line of thinking?</div>

<div class=commentbody>>And if a valubale contributor decides that the best way to ignore such comments is to leave Typophile, is that acceptable? I think not. What say ye?
Paul, that is a bitter pill, particularly because I agree about the offensiveness of the comments and the value of the contributor. But frankly I don't think you can control who is offended by what kind of statement and decides not to participate. And it is not, I think, a sufficient reason to censor political opinions.
First, politics does sometimes get mixed up with movements in type design and typography, so politics and type can't be completely segregated. Second, I think it is an important principle not to censor political views we personally find offensive--including Hrant's and Dennis's (and mine or yours for that matter).
I do think it is a reason to post on your guidelines:
"This forum is not a forum for political proselytizing; please grind politicals axes elsewhere and focus on type and typography."
What bothers me is not the occasional whacky or ugly view, but the tiresome grind, grind, grind. </div>

Just to clarify, I was just being silly (I was tired from traveling), and if you read my post you'll see the word I wanted was the equivelant word for "the fear of men who act childish".
I'll bet whatever it is would sound funny.
Anyway, the title of this thread has nothing to do with type, so just like the Kung-Foo fighting reference, I was just having some fun.
<em>Prehaps you could take this a bit more to heart.</em>
Huh? Again I was having some fun with words (I can't tolerate intolerance...get it?). I am pretty tolerent, so I haven't a clue what you are talking about. Lighten up dude.

Hrant, if you are reading my posts you will see that I do not advocate censoring your political views.
In response to Paul's suggesion, I have revised my post above to read "what I take to be Hrant's advocacy of autocracy" instead of "Hrant's advocacy of autrocacy." Though I note that Hrant did not object to that formulation. I would appreciate if you would also say "what I take to be William's apology for Fascism."

Okay, i don't really advocate censoring, but we need to figure out something that will work. As it is, I feel that Typophile <em>IS</em> dying a slow death with all this bitterness being slung about freely. That's why i'm so anxious as a moderator to find some sort of protocol that will work for creating a pleasant experience for everyone. i guess we need to agree on a couple things:
1) what is/isn't appropriate for typophile?
2) what actions should be taken when content that is inappropriate is posted?
This all feels like a rehash of <a href=http://typophile.com/node/13353>Forum Decorum</a>, but obviously, those lessons didn't stick...</div>

<div class=commentbody><em> what is/isn’t appropriate for typophile?</em>
I have found that politics and religion are things that have wildly opposing, and sometimes irreconcilable views, and if I was a moderator, I would be firm about keeping those out of here. Hopefully the moderator would be even-handed, and not allow a dig at something he agrees with to sit there unchallenged.
It wouldn't be censorship as much as an out-of-bounds for this forum.
If you can remove a link to a questionable font site, which is censorship of a type I understand, why not material that can cause hard feelings? I guess it would require skills in defusing a situation while keeping it upbeat, and not taking sides, but reinforcing the positive direction for the discussion.

Dan, you make a really good point, which highlights the dilemma of those who are offended by a personal attack on an individual, or, as Paul notes, a group. (Note, Paul, it isn't offensive in itself to ascribe political views to a person--eg to call someone a democrat if they say they are.)
The dilemma is that if they respond, they really risk being dragged into a mud-slinging match. If they don't respond, they may be encouraging it, as Dan says. This is why only a moderator can really solve the problem by intervening and cutting out the personal attack on an individual or censuring and warning on the group attack.
The individual can perhaps best respond: cut out the personal attacks, this is not acceptable on Typophile. But it is way better if a moderator does it.

<div class=commentbody>If you're a moderator, you have the right to edit, delete, etc. posts that contain comments that are slanderous, or demeaning to any group or individual. If someone doesn't like it they can start their own forum. I think in certain cases it may be the only way to keep this place on the right track. So Paul, go for it. On a personal note, I used to visit a certain graphic design blog daily, but had to stop due to all the Christian/conservative bashing that was going on. One of the things I have always loved about this form is the fact that, for the most part, religion and politics have been kept out. There are plenty of things we could all disagree about, but the reason we're here is what we agree on, a love of type and typography. I'm here to learn, and have learned a lot, so thanks.</div>

If something were to be removed, it would then give an indication of how much is too far. It is good for people to know what the limits are. Even though we know the speed limit is 65, most people will go with the speed they think they can get away with.

I don't know Latin so I can't come up with the phobia name for people who don't like "men who are acting like children", but if tolerance is what is being preached, why not tolerance for men who act childish?

I stand by my view that politics should be avoided. People feel too strongly...feelings get hurt...has nothing to do with fonts...scares away newcomers that could be new blood.

<div class=commentbody>Could we create a "Boxing Ring" Forum? That way, anyone who likes this sort of reciprocal podiatric mutual urination can go there and relieve themselves on each other. This would leave the rest of us, who are sick of it, to discuss and even debate issues of typography without fear that a thread would be hijacked and killed by a piszing contest.
This would also create a place to move posts that stray out of the realm of substantive discussion. What I mean is, instead of censorship and removal of a post, it could be moved to the "Boxing Ring" where the combatants, if they so desired, could go and continue their pugilistic tirades. This would be then the online version of a parent saying to a child, "Go to your room and come back when you are ready to behave with respect for others."

<div class=commentbody>Hrant, I think your weakest arguements are political. They don't seem to hold any sort of water whatever. I wait to be enlightened. I find Stephen Fry to be the most thoughful as of last week. I'll send you a link if you want. (Of course your ideas about type are altogether different. Long may you continue to think!)
As far as rants & fights & insults. I have to agree that keeping it within core topic seems best to me in general. But we are going to stray outside and for good reason. Type is connected to world. Which is great or type would be irrelevant. Which it isn't ( or we don't think so or we wouldn't be here).
As far as Patty's concerns. Yes Patty... the water is dirtier on typophile that would be ideal - BUT - don't be silly & let that put you off. It's still by far the best place to be if you are thinking about type or want to learn more from your type brother & sisters.

And my thanks to everybody here for making it that kind of place.
I have been in Toronto & Buffalo NY ( Montreal now ) meeting really wonderful type people - something that I doubt would have happened without Typophile.

I am happy you agree with me about the "ring idea".
What I see is that we all agree that there is a "problem". We seem to agree that we don't like censorship. Some of us agree that, or at least Chris does about the "ring" idea. This should make everyone happy. Although still, as in a boxing match, "rules of engagement should still apply. For instance, "no hitting below the belt".

Paul, that's pretty elegant - I hadn't thought of it.
Although insinuation can't be totally avoided, I think
this might strike a great balance. (I've edited my post.)

I'm pretty sure Paul wanted the "Hrant" (and my "William", which is now
gone) out of there. But I don't think he should try to force you to remove it.

I think there's a limit to that line of logic.
Anybody reading something like that is a factor.
Also, William: You should class religion with politics. Can you handle that?

While I think that is clearly one thing that must not be encouraged.
Same with religion.

I don't think so, and I think to some extent you're over-reacting. That one person shouldn't have left (as I told him). Also, you should assume that there were more reasons than just the Typophile insult that he left. I'm basing these opinions on 8+ years of mixing it up bigtime in online type discussion fora.
If there is any real ill health, it's in the area of [lack of] type crits.
I'd worry more about how to fix that.

<div class=commentbody>Slander, or would that be "Libel".
Typophile is a form of publishing. Censorship in automatic in that lawsuits are possible.
A forum however has the advantage that one is able to "somewhat counter attacks directly", which I suspect would limit some liability. In fact leagally it is one's obligation to limit liability which means helping the person who is speaking against you.
Legally speaking, determination of damages is always the question.
Slander is somewhat more insideous at times, it often happens behind ones back, not to mention harder to prove, as it is "heresay" evidence only.
I am against censorship. It is the price of freedom. That does not mean I agree with what people say, or how they say it. In that sense, I do not tolerate, intolerance.
Maybe there is better way of saying that?

<div class=commentbody><em>I am against censorship. It is the price of freedom.</em>
In my mind, censorship is when just one side of an argument is excluded to promote the other side. This is essentially what is really feared by most people, I think.
But in a sense, we continually censor all kinds of things in life by rules or penalties to protect some environment. Like censoring speeding in residential areas.
Please keep in mind, most people who stick around any online forum over time have fairly thick skin. But many are scared away, or at least refrain from participating because they fear some unpleasant attack.
Often things are said online that wouldn't be said face-to-face. And I think that most of us could sit down in a restaurant and have a good time in person. I don't think there is anything wrong in cultivating a family atmosphere in a place meant for growth and development in an artistic pursuit.
As fonts relate to communication, I think discussion of all kinds of things may apply, but there is nothing wrong in making a place where the fallout from the potentially explosive topics be contained.</div>

I have another suggestion. You have "Preview comment", "Post Comment". Maybe after you hit the post comment you could have a warning come up that reads, are you sure you want to say that, "Cancel", "Continue" options.

You're right, my mistake. It is precisely because stuff can stay around a long time that malicious stuff against individuals should be cut out of the record. I don't think and certainly hope that no lawsuits will ever happen because of a Typophile discussion. But the principle of not letting injurious stuff stay in the public record is a good one anyway, in my view.
>William: You should class religion with politics. Can you handle that?
Sure, they should be treated the same. Tiresome axe-grinding should be warned against by moderators, and name-calling stopped. But discussion on both should be allowed when relevant.
Incidentally, it is months since I have mentioned religion on Typophile, I think, and I don't accept your characterization that I drag it in constantly. I just yesterday had an interesting dialogue on the ID board with a fellow who is interested in what Jewish law and ethics has to say about protection of intellectual property rights, in particular fonts. I think it was a perfectly appropriate discussion for Typophile. </div>

Making good fonts is no guarantee of any other attribute, really.

Some years ago I was accused -as I periodically am, although that time it was quite incisive and eloquent- of causing valuable contributors to stay away from public discussion, in that case involving the venerable (and now apparently doddering) Typo-L. Due partly* to that, I decided to unsubscribe, and urged people to tell those who were staying away that the coast is clear. But they did not come. Also, nobody left because I did AFAIK. For a few months some people urged me to come back (and originaly I was actually planning to do that <cite>if</cite> those who were allegedly staying away never showed up) but I figured it was actually a good thing: it was a fruitful social experiment, I proved a point, and now I waste less time online! :-/

Actually, I haven't been in Cincy for over two months. I moved back to Washington, DC and now work in Maryland.
I guess I'm both a little amused and a little disappointed that a thread started to address fighting, has contained nearly EXACTLY the same level of bickering that the post was intended to address. While it makes complete sense that certain topics will spawn other issues (religion, ethics, etc.). Discussing political ideologies often seem to get us nowhere.
Unfortunately, by picking whatever a person's chosen form of ethics (philospher's, religion, the U.S. Constitution) a declaration has already been made as to "this is best." Then this gets into how many books, so and so has read on the subject, how Lenin ultimately paved the way for Stalin, and a bunch of other things that prove just who is intellectually superior to the other.
The point is, we're all adults here and we know what's right and wrong...And I for second am not foolish enough to believe that before we all hit the "Post comment" button that we're not in some way aware that what was typed could be deemed offensive. Our mothers shouldn't have to slap our hands anymore to let us know the stove is hot.</div>

<div class=card-body>
<div class=commentbody>Every forum has rules about civility and relevance. Civility means mutual respect regardless of race, ethnicity, religion, gender and, in my view, sexual orientation. Relevance means relevance to the subject matter of the forum. While debates about artistic and design ideology are in my view relevant to typography, debates about political policy that have nothing to do with typography, such as the Iraq war or local concerns about immigration, are not. Some fora have an off-topic sub-forum where people can pursue political issues if they desire. Personally, I'm not keen on this, but it does provide an outlet for those who can't make it to Hyde Park.
The rules of a forum, regardless of whether they have been created by the owner of the site or by consensus of the participants, need to be enforced if the forum is going to flourish. It seems to me that censorship is the wrong word to describe doing what is necessary to ensure adherence to the rules.
My experience is that most people are prepared to adhere. However, there are people who simply won't unless they are reined in. Also, many people, if not most, have their "moments". The question is, how are the rules going to be enforced in such instances?
I believe that the existence of a moderator, who is prepared to step in, is essential. Self-control does not work when self-control has broken down.
My belief is based on long-term experience with three discussion groups that have minimal problems with the kinds of issues discussed in this thread. The common denominator of these groups is the existence of a moderator (in one case two moderators) who is active in the discussions, who is prepared to step in when things start to get out of hand, who has a talent for doing so in a diplomatic manner and who has the respect of the participants. In each case, the moderator is prepared, when he or she deems it appropriate, to delete a post or lock a thread. The result is that everybody understands the rules, and eggregious behaviour, together with the need to step in, is relatively rare. People who prefer anarchy, or who don't like the rules, are at liberty to start their own forum.
A successful discussion group, like any meeting, requires a hands-on chair/moderator. I realize that this places a burden on moderators that they may not want to bear. To be blunt, that is beside the point. Successful discussion groups must have a person or persons who have both the time and the inclination to play this role.
The alternative is the same as what happens at a rudderless meeting. A small group of people highjack the meeting, the discussion deteriorates (and frequently becomes highly repetitive), and everyone else exits via the nearest door.
Some of the participants in this thread have suggested that the solution is to ignore individuals or posts that don't play by the rules. I have tried that on this forum. As someone else pointed out, it doesn't work. Without getting into detail about why, what happens is that the thread becomes impossible to follow.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Redge, I agree with some of what you say, but one thing I must counter is your desire to separate politics and type. As Eben I think it was said, that's not possible; I would add that it's not even desirable. For example, there are facets to the Iraq war (such as the looting of their museum by what many people believe were western entities) that are quite strongly cultural, and hence in some way (sometimes in quite a strong way) related to type. Fonts are not just pretty shapes. My Nour & Patria system for one was motivated directly by politics.
> I have tried that on this forum.

Maybe you haven't tried hard enough? Or you're not capable of it?
Honestly I'm not trying to strike you down here - each of us is
good and bad at different things - and our differences should be
not only tolerated, but celebrated. But my point is, the fact that
it failed for you doesn't mean it must be bad. In fact as some others
have attested, for them it works fine. And it could still work for you.

<div class=commentbody>Hrant,
Two of the discussion groups to which I referred are for people who make motion pictures. One of those groups is specifically for people who make documentary films. Many documentary filmmakers express their political and social views in their work. Recently, one of the participants won an important award for a film that he made about Iraq. The discussion within the group was about his film as a film, including the views that it expressed. Despite the fact that the people in the group come from the right, the centre and the left, he was not attacked or mocked for his views, and the discussion did not degenerate into a debate about the war generally.
I don't have a problem if someone wants to argue that a political ideology is reflected in a particular type face or if someone wants to talk about his or her attempts to embody an ideology in a type face. That is what I was trying to capture, however imperfectly, when I referred to "artistic and design ideology", concepts that can include, but are broader than, social and political views.
I do have a problem when the discussion becomes principally about the politics or if someone is berrated for having allegedly expressed a particular ideology in his or her work.
On your other point, I can only say that I have found that I cannot follow some of the threads on this forum through selective reading and still make sense of the thread (see the word highjacked in my earlier post). In other words, I am indeed incapable of doing it, and I am not planning to spend time trying to acquire the skill.

I cannot blame you. It's not clear that the effort (even if

<div class=commentbody>I have been part of this site for a long time, since the new typophile site, however my old handle no longer worked for some reason. Before a short while ago, i did not post, I only lurked in the background. Now, as I have become somewhat of a participant, I do think that personal opinions are relevant to any discussion; especially one that hits upon a sore spot within the creative community as a whole.
Additionally, I do tend to not post much here, as I have not been [accepted] per say; not to mention that in real life I am a difficult person to get along with. Most find me abrasive, caustic, and too much of a realist; so they chose to not speak with me. However, there are those that come and speak with me specifically for these traits. I won't martyr myself here, as I am likely flawed in more ways than most others, but my recent attitude cannot be excused. Furthermore, I do not feel that it should need to be, as the responses I posted, and edited, were pertinent to the discussion topic, and merely clarified my position on a specific topic. If they were interpreted as anything else, than i beg you to forgive this, as I may have not worded them in a clear and concise manner.
More often than not, especially in the thread that I am referencing above, I find that there is a lot of "elitists" here, and that the banter is extremely stilted; often times to the point that it is above my comprehension. If there is one thing that bothers me most about this collective, it would be this characteristic style of cryptically concealing information inside a verbose series of statements that are understood by few, however, viewed by many. I wish I were of the caliber of writer, and reader to be able to comprehend a lot the material here, but it seems that I just don't measure up. A majority of the content, aside from any critique or technical discussion, is where I find myself aloof amongst the moderators and other prolific members.
Recently, I have tried to be a more compliant member, and help others with questions they have posted, as most have acted kindly to me in the past. Looking ahead, I wish to continue doing so, but I will not refrain from expressing my opinions when they are relative to a threads content. Communication is nothing more than the expression of ideas and opinions, even that which is stated as factual knowledge was and is based on a series of subjective observations of this world. Moderating the content of this forum, and the statements of its members is a little too Orwellian for me to tolerate, and I would hope that things would never come down to this. I, and everyone else, are responsible for what we communicate, whether it is understood partially, entirely, or not at all.
Few choices are left to me, as the mood of typophile either settles or continues to become irritated; for any disturbance that can be solely attributed to my doing was unintentional.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Hrant, a quick question.
About 25-35 years ago, a well-known writer for The New Yorker published a book about his discovery of his Armenian heritage and his investigation of the genocide.
I read the book a few years ago (it had a significant impact on me and was very well-written), but I can't remember the name of the writer and I can't readily find it through google, amazon, etc. I got it at a second-hand bookstore, and lost my copy during a move. There is a high probability that it is out of print.
This has been bugging me for the last week, entirely your fault. Do you happen to know the name of the writer or the name of the book?
One other question. My father, who is a writer, introduced me as a kid to Saroyan senior. Is he still read in the Armenian community, or is he considered too sentimental/ passe (sorry, but I don't know how to do accents on this site)?</div>

<div class=commentbody>Therapy for message board prolific posters:
---Listen to understand rather than criticize
---Share ideas and thoughts that enlighten, spark new ideas, or deeper thought
---Ask Questions with as much detail as possible so those who can help are providing the best answers and help.
---Put the comments into an imaginary sorting box and look at them when you can be objective. Value and implement the good. Toss out the bad.
---If a response or statement appears to be a personal attack- rather than a critique--- let it land at your feet... then step forward, crushing the words quietly beneath your feet, as you respond with dignity and grace.
---If boredom, loneliness or depression is the motivator for meanness, nasty attacks, and constant criticism...You are considered a message baord troll...and you need therapy, not this forum.
One final question:
If your words and deeds were compared to typeface and fonts--- what typeface or font fits you?
---and is that 'type face' / font how you want to present your 'face' to the world?
If not, make a change.

<div class=commentbody>Beirut during Hrant's childhood was a scary thought.
I have seen children of war in Viet Nam in 1968. They never had a childhood. They could never feel that their parents could keep them safe. They never could feel they had a future beyond the moment. Trying to find some semblance of order and normalcy is impossible for an adult--for a child it is devastating. When horror becomes the norm for a child, peace within one's self is not possible. The scars never leave, the anxiety never fades. Cheating death another day becomes a pastime but buries its seed deep to bloom later in uncontrolled ways.

<div class=commentbody>Chris,
Your post, if it is directed at Hrant, as it appears to be, is exactly the kind of post that the moderators should come down on.
If this is what this site tolerates, I'm not long for it.
If I want to spend my time on a newsnet newsgroup, I know where to find one.
Your previous expression of pity was bad enough, but you have now gone way over the line.
There really is a point where the people who run this forum have to decide whether they are running a professional operation or the equivalent of a discussion between 18 year olds in a pub who have had too much to drink. </div>

<div class=commentbody>It isn't just shock, it is outrageous.
Between bizarre attempts to turn Patty Fabricant's question into a debate about Aristotle, and Chris's (and others') fundamentally astounding remarks, I think that I am in a very unpleasant version of Wonderland or, to use the current vernacular, a really bad version of The Matrix.
From my point of view, this is a bad scene, and that is an understatement.
Not that I matter. I have particular reasons for following this site at the moment, and I can do it temporarily, and then drop out.
You know what really surprises me? There are some really interesting topics outstanding, and they are being ignored.

<div class=commentbody>Paul,
No, I am in a position to say what I think, and I am going to do so.
Chris's last couple of posts leave me stunned, and I can't believe that a legitimate forum would let them stand.
Secondly, the attempts to turn Patty's complaint about lack of civility into an intellectual debate about Greek philosophers is one of the most bizarre things that I have ever witnessed.
This business about Aristotle makes about as much sense as Hrant's comments, in an earlier thread, about what he perceives to be my Anglo background.
I believe that this debate would make great fodder for a skit for Monty Python or Kids in the Hall (or to be more contemporary, Ricky Gervais, preferably paired with Scott Thompson, just to amuse the anti-gay participants).
Whether the people who run this site want outsiders like myself, who may stick around if they think that they are dealing with adults, to do so, is entirely up to them.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Chris, your depiction of a "war child" contains a lot of truth - I'm happy to see you're aware of this stuff. As you might suspect of a war child, I'm not shocked at all. Shocking was seeing a head on a bench in a public park. But of course every war child is different! Although it's true that I don't remember feeling like a child after about age 6, and I do have trouble planning for the future, I actually think my parents did fine, and most of all, I don't remember being afraid (except for a certain 5 minutes where I came quite close to being executed) and I never cried (not even when my uncle was assassinated). I'm not sure why. Maybe I was eased into it, maybe it's my genes, or maybe I was lucky to start the war at an insensitive age, and got a foothold that way. For example, my brother, who is 4.5 years older, is a lot like me in this way (although he's a gentler soul) but my sister, who is 8.5 years older, cried a lot. When the lighted anti-aircraft bullets would streak up at nights, she'd hide in her room - my brother and I went to the balcony.
Yes, it's quite strange living in a society that seems at peace. But part of the reason it's strange is because I think most people around me are peons who don't realize that there never is total peace - and that's actually a good thing. It's not healthy living a society secluded from the "real world" outside your borders. It causes you to adore your SUV, to vote for war criminals for president, to not see that the Founding Fathers were just good businessmen, etc. I don't think these people are "normal", and I don't think I'm "abnormal". War (conflict) is in all of us, it's in every aspect of life. I remember telling a group of Dutchies during a dinner after a type conference about my war-time upbringing. Thomas Milo (who has served as a UN peacekeeper in Lebanon) was the only one who "got it", smiling sadly - there is a great sadness to missing war.* Evert Bloemsma couldn't relate, but his powerful intellect and wisdom allowed him to listen with fascination, and learn things from the discussion. Then there was this young lady whose jaw dropped open and stayed that way, and at one point exclaimed: "All I've seen is neat rows of tulips!" Was I supposed to feel envy? I felt pity. Remembering my favorite Heraclitus quote, it makes me feel that she's had only one parent.
* BTW, I highly recommend the book "The Adventurist".
I related to that author like I've never related to
almost anybody in my life - certainly no author.
Life is sort of a long anti-climax, after surviving a war. Once in a blue moon it actually makes me cry, but most of the time it makes me very proud. I think it's what's given me my ability to doubt convention, to persevere, to be tolerant, and to see aspects of life that I'm sure must be invisible to the peons. And what makes me most proud is that some years ago I realized all this, and have come to terms with it, have learned to embrace the dark half of life (which everybody has, just to different degrees). This makes me feel like I can generally be happy living with this aspect of my being, or at least know its effects on me, and what types of things can make me happy.
But most of all: I'm not just a war child, I'm Armenian. I am -quite literally- the grandchild of the unrecognized genocide. This you are unlikely to ever fathom. Maybe for that I am envious of you.
--
As for whether Chris is going too far, as far as I'm concerned, no.
But he does go too far when he (or his friend) complains about posts
like this that I make. Really Chris, that's not fair. And I think it's
a manifestation of the "darkness" you have in you yourself too.
----
You guys know what's really interesting? We seem to make fonts
based on beliefs like this. It seems to me that the difference
between thinking that war is Evil and that everything must be
in balance is parallel to the difference between display fonts
and text fonts; the difference between the black and notan; and
a bunch of other things, like perhaps the West and the East.

<div class=commentbody>I don't see what is wrong with Chris honestly discussing his experiences in Vietnam, or Hrant discussing his experiences growing up in Beirut. These posts show real human emotion, and additionally, wisdom. Cheap shots are another matter altogether. I don't understand the calls for the last few Hrant or Chris posts to be reigned in at all, sorry.

<div class=commentbody>Democracy is the right to freedom of speech and opinions, in a manner of speaking, as long as that right does not impinge upon what legally we now call racial, personal and political vilification. To generalise, mankind has based his whole civilisation, his advancement within the animal kingdom, and his personal place within the pecking order by demeaning those who either oppose him, or look like being able to challenge him. It is the nature of our beast. We can not help ourselves. The civility that is requested is just a veneer over our base instincts for mental and physical attacks, our beastiality.
Everyone who appears on this board are not neccessarily from a democracy, as such, and we should also respect their views as we expect them to respect ours.
It would be nice to see the attacks reined in or watered down, as it does affect those with a gentler view of life, but occasionally we just plain can't help ourselves. there are a few here who I can see posting remarks asking for the 'language' to be toned down, the bile and garbage to be kept in check, but unfortunately I have seen these same people shout some rather nasty statements themselves, one in particuar directed at me.
It is futile.
And in regard to Hrant. I personally feel his satirical acerbic nature makes him the man he is and it would be a loss to cotton candy this down. Yes, it feels pretty crappy when you are in his firing line, and I feel sorry for those people, but just think, at least he doen't live next door to you* !
*This is a joke for those who don't see the obvious.

Hrant, I knew you would be the one who would understand my post. I was just trying to understand you and perhaps give others here a chance to understand you as well. I guess I failed badly at that. I did not mean to shock anyone. I meant my post to reach out for healing in all of us who know pain. I know I have the darkness too. I am sorry to have caused you any discomfort.
At least I was 23 years old and supposedly not a child in war. I quickly lost whatever innocence remained in me when I saw the "accidental" fate of children of war. You were a child and never had a chance. Crying can be a healthy thing. Maybe you should have a long talk with your sister. Maybe we all should have a long talk with your sister.

<div class=commentbody>The dark ones may not be as doomed as you imagine Chris.
In a tribal sense they have a huge role, which is to predict danger. Optimism helps the group move forward, sometimes with false hope. The darkness finds danger before it is upon us and warns us with enough time to act.
Our fate is to be somewhat disregarded and disliked until we prove ourselves useful.
Shock is not always defacto bad. It is uselful and should be in the arsenal of any artist. I'm delighted when I'm truly shocked, because It can be hard to believe possible.</div>

Please express that view when Nick (or anybody of course) complains about being
"psychoanalysed". Yes, some people -unlike me- mind it, sometimes a lot. But the
discussion of personal context helps more people more. You could say it's the price
of being public.

Chris, I wasn't sure if you were attacking me (indirectly) or not.
Essentially, you were being candid - and you know what I think
about that. But most of all I wanted to use it as an opportunity to
expose my personal context. So thanks! And most of all, I need to
keep having long talks (or even just gut-level short bursts) with
everybody.

<div class=commentbody>I'm sure there are important truths to be learned in the extreme stress of war. But there are also some things 'learned' that are quite dysfunctional in peace time. Irving Janis, who started his long career studying how stress negatively affected fighter pilots, gave us great insights into this.
He called this dysfunctional state that extreme risk can induce 'hypervigilance'. One of its features is that you oversimplify and think in extremes only, in 'black-and-white'. It also shortens your time horizon, and narrows your thinking to looking at everything for its impact on you only.
The impact of this on people is that it can make them not so functional in the arts of peace: in being productive in work, in building cooperative relationships, in sustaining love.
So yes, I'm sure there are truths to be learned in war. But personally I thank my lucky stars that I was raised in one of the most peaceful times and places--the US midwest in the 1950s--by loving parents, with no physical threats other than polio and the far off Russian bear. </div>

<div class=commentbody>William, that's certainly true. Although I don't think I exhibit most of those effects. For one thing, I'm extremely gray. Also, I'm a good negotiator, including between others (see the Comic Sans thread on SnogBlog). Maybe a <cite>civil</cite> war teaches you that. But yes, I do have quite a bit of dysfunction too. For one thing, you should hear how much I've paid the various traffic courts over the years! :-/
The thing is, not seeing any conflict causes dysfunction as well. It causes you to be insensitive in another way, and essentially live under an illusion, caring more for seals than Palestinians for example. Most people I know here (and I don't mean LA - this city is actually very "real" in many ways) are extremely shallow.
So I in turn thank my lucky stars that I grew up between
the Eagle and the Bear. And between the Eagle and the Panda!
Especially when you're a minority, it's the best place to grow.

<div class=commentbody>Well, Hrant, my perception, which may or may not be my own craziness, is that in your discussions on Typophile you regularly divide the world into extreme categories of good guys and bad guys. The West is bad, developing countries good. Devotion to 'bouma' and 'notan' good. 'Modernists,' 'chirographers,' 'constructivists,' and 'artistes' bad.
Because of these extreme categories, anyone who has the temerity to disagree with your views and criticise them becomes 'bad'. Am I way wrong in my perception?</div>

<div class=commentbody>Well, you could indeed say that I'm a Taoist, in that I see things existing always between two pure extreme concepts.

<div class=commentbody>Maybe Hrant sees you as out of balance. That experience and integration of "other" involves presenting "other" as equally valid and functional.
If someone sees only blue sky, it would be odd to try and convince them that the sky was actually more blue than what they think. You would logically point out a storm cloud or two. The opposite would be just as true.

<div class=commentbody>As another moderator:
I've been guilty of not doing my job here ... perhaps.
If you find a topic boring, you don't need to say so. For instance, if Hrant starts going off about chirography I 've heard it before so I tune out. Because I personally think he is wrong but don't have daring to debate it with him.
I think some people are always waiting to be insulted or shocked or offended. However, there IS another side to this coin. Some people cannot turn their volume down from 11 and do offend, shock and insult. Some people may have elephant skin, but other's do not. The human thing to do is keep this in mind and bridle your words before a moderator has to bridle them for you.
There are a few people that I will e-mail off-list as I do feel I need to say a few words to them, but I don't feel I should do this on-list. I do wish more people would do this.
Some of the political discussions really have bothered me. But, I want other people to be able to share their viewpoints. Sharing and discussing can be educational. However, when it becomes one person shoving their way down my throat I find my gag reflex kicks in and I have to leave.
I wasn't shocked by Chris's comments. I heard his <em>voice</em>. I try desperately to hear what other's are saying too. This mode of communication leaves out so much of communication it is dangerous. Sure we have emoticons and can <strong>emphasize</strong> OUR <em>words</em> in a few different ways, but in the end it won't work unless you try to hear the humanity in the other person. I do understand that some of us actually know each other well enough to know if we like or dislike the person. BUT unless you've met the person face-to-face and had a conversation with them you WILL NEVER know if you like them or not 100% for sure. (If you get my meaning.)
As a moderator I need you to know I am completely against insulting others' politics, religion, sexual orientations ... etc. If you wish to explain where you stand and why, without being dogmatic and boring, this is something educational. But the second you start insulting someone else it has become personal, even if no name is used and there is insinuating! Personal attacks (names used or not) aren't to be tolerated.
We have lost a valuable contributor. It was his right to leave. What was allowed to be posted will never happen again.
In the movie <em>You've Got Mail</em>, Meg Ryan's character wishes she could zing. In the moment she has the ability she regrets it. She realizes that have zinging Tom Hank's character, she hurts him. She saw him as this unfeeling monster. But, after she zinged him she saw his humanity. I wish more of us could do that.
Life is too short. I'm here once and I want to make the most of it. I love Typophile and I hate that this discussion even has to take place.
Next time you see an opening for a clever remark, think twice. Are you zinging someone? Is it necessary? If you think it is necessary, are you sure? Why? Even if you think you are sure and have a good reason, will it hurt someone? Think twice, edit thrice. Then post. Please don't make the moderator's have to censor you.</div>

<div class=commentbody><em>In the movie You’ve Got Mail, Meg Ryan’s character wishes she could zing.</em>
I used to wish I had a bazooka mounted on my car, but then I realized if that was allowed the streets would be empty.
This reference is too old for for many but there was a line from Fiddler on the Roof that stood out for me after decades:
Somebody says "An eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth!"
And some grandfatherly character says something like "If we did that the whole world would be blind and toothless."
In a perfect world I imagine heated disagreements would be settled with a Dance-Off. I'd sure like to watch that. I bet we'd all be better dancers.

Indeed.
Somewhere William recently tried to explain the difference
between reality and opinion, and I don't think I ever replied
to that: yes, reality exists, it's just that we can never really
grasp it - so everything does revert to opinion.
Think of the Gorgias three.
> Do you happen to know the name of the writer or the name of the book?
I don't know of it myself, but I can
find out (if you ask again, since it
seems you're gone now).
Saroyan: I don't think he's generally considered "too sentimental",
but he is given short shrift by some because he only wrote in English.
Not a very good reason, I know. But in effect his popularity is mostly
restricted to American-Armenians. On the other hand, he does have
a very famous quote about how Armenians are survivors, and that
you will find used very heavily all over the world.
"I should like to see any power of the world destroy this race, this small tribe of unimportant people, whose wars have all been fought and lost, whose structures have crumbled, literature is unread, music is unheard, and prayers are no more answered. Go ahead, destroy Armenia. See if you can do it. Send them into the desert without bread and water. Burn their homes and churches. Then see if they will not laugh, sing and pray again. For when two of them meet anywhere in the world, see if they will not create a new Armenia."
> So we are talking 1915? Anything current?
Well, it's still current because it hasn't been recognized yet (by Turkey, or its suggardaddy the US), and no reparations have been made. It's certainly more "current" (in the impotant way) than the Holocaust. Out of 8 million of us 5 million live outside Armenia (which today is a small morcel of our ancestral lands - I'm talking about 3 millennias worth) so you bet it's current. But it hasn't really stopped either: Turkey has a long-standing blockade of Armenia, in 1990 there were extensive pogroms in Baku, etc. And stuff like this happens:

I call opinion agreed upon reality.
Every once in a while someone makes a microcosmic observation beyond the veil of agreed upon reality. Then if they have the ability to expound on that observation a new little universe is created. That's where great discoveries come from.
We can't see the big picture. But if we take out the microscope…

Ok, all you who don't like to read philosophy stop here.
These are long standing arguments in philosophy. Here is my take on it, which follows my late teacher Karl Popper--you can read his 'Three views concerning human knowledge' in the book 'Conjectures and Refutations' if you are interested.
We cannot fully grasp reality, nor be sure where we have gone wrong. However we do indeed partially grasp reality, and that is a critically important fact. If we did not partly grasp reality we would have been eliminated by Darwinian selection--we would eat poison instead of nutritious food, walk off cliffs, etc.
Furthermore, we can not only partly grasp reality, we can extend out knowledge of it, which is what science attempts to do, and it has given us immensely greater power over nature than we had before. Plentiful food and superior medicine are but two indications of this, which are blessings to all of us.
Incidentally, like Einstein, Popper viewed science as a great spiritual adventure, and I agree. This is why I reject the anti-scientific and anti-technology statements of some on this forum.
But equally important in the field of politics, 'the death of reason gives birth to monsters'. The idea that we have a partial grip on reality, and we should try to make the political system responsive to it, is critical. It stands behind freedom of the press--surpressed by practically all absolute rulers, and behind debate leading up to elections, which enable us to remove bad leaders without violence. Though this system works only poorly, it has proven far superior economically and morally to all autocratic systems. That we can sometimes grasp reality is the key premise of all liberal government. </div>

I think it depends on the kind of newspapers/sites you consume. There has been "much" talk about the new film being produced by the brothers Taviani about the Armenian genocide. I don't remember exactly where I read about it, probably the Corriere della Sera but maybe you could try to check out non-corporate media, www.fair.org, www.cursor.org, www.motherjones.com...just a suggestion. </div>

<div class=commentbody>> freedom of the press—surpressed by practically all absolute rulers
Yes, they can be pretty dumb. Much smarter is what's done in the West: have freedom of the press, but control the press. That way people don't realized they're being manipulated, sometimes even oppressed. The only opinions that reach the masses are the ones sanctioned (very carefully and cleverly) by the system. My views for example will <cite>never</cite> reach enough people - just you guys. Also, you're much less likely to take <cite>action</cite> when you can complain, even if you don't realize that almost nobody can hear you; you vent, then you go back to your pizza and football.
In the end, freedom of the press is just another tool of the system. It's actually worse than not having it! Because those who don't have it have a better chance of thinking independetly, seeing the real problems and changing their system in a <cite>meaningful</cite> way, as opposed to simply swapping out the puppet at the top of the stage.
For example, the reason that Fontplayer has heard far less about
the Armenian Genocide than Lore is due directly to the fact that
the US and Turkey are long-standing and strong geopolitical allies.
In the same way that you won't hear much coverage of the Holocaust
on Iranian TV (unlike over here where you basically can't escape it)
you hear barely a squeak about the Armenian Genocide in the US.
Freedom of the Press? More like Freedom of the Brainwashing.
And virtually every aspect of this society is rigged in this way.
Compulsory public education for example is basically a way to:
free up both parents to work (read: become cogs)*; and start the
brainwashing as early as possible!
* In fact this was stated explicitly as justification for the cost to the state when the idea was first introduced in the UK. The Brits once had a self-righteous brashness that they've now lost, for better or worse - probably due to becoming a henchman for the US.
The thing is, you can only make freedom of the press, public education, etc. work to make the system more stable if the system is at a certain stage, with a fully controlled media, etc. This is why despots fail so often: they're impatient.

This should not be an excuse. People have now access to all kind of sources of information and should be able to search information, compare opinions, read between the lines and learn to interpret articles. If you think that an issue is not being covered appropriately by the corporate media there are a number of organizations you can write to ( yes, in the US too) and give your support. I wrote my little letter days ago and asked for the armenian issue to get more coverage. That was after I read the article about the Taviani brothers and the issue of Turkey having to recogize the genocide in order to be a member of the EU and all that this implies.You cannot afford to be a passive news consumer anymore, you need to get involved and participate. If there is a problem with corporate media , part of the problem is the way people consume the news. A philosopher was telling the other day he heard someone saying "I'll be late because I am stuck in a car jam" instead he should have said "I'll be late because I am busy producing a car jam"...I thought it was a good example. I've heard people talking about democracy here but there is a difference between representative democracy and participative democracy.
I can't tell Dennis what he should read, I can only recommend some of the sources but then he will have to compare them and come to his own conclusion and learn how to dissect and deconstruct an article.

So certain kinds of coverage reach <cite>them</cite> - much easier than

Yes, via the ANCA*, which conducts email campaigns and fundraising,
I try more than most (although frankly still not enough) and I'm
happy to report it does have an effect. But it's so tough to crack the
stangle-hold on public coverage. Also, there are rich and powerful
forces at play, such as the Turkish lobby in the US government, so
it's not at all an open field that we can just run with the ball.

That's highly appreciated.
And the "entertainment" field can certainly play a huge role.
In the US, System of a Down does more than virtually anybody else.

Ah, the old 'repressive tolerance' argument of Marcuse. I'm sorry but I have just despised that argument every since I heard it in the '60s. I think it is cheap, arrogant and phoney. Arrogant as it gives one who advocates it the excuse to dismiss anyone who disagrees with them with the broad brush that they are 'brainwashed'. Cheap and lazy because one never needs to look at inconvenient facts that seem to contradict one's own view. The person advocating the argument is also then permitted to spout woolly generalities and invective, like Marcuse.
The argument is phoney because it is flatly contracticted by the facts. Nowadays information is more available than ever, both on cable TV and the internet, as well as traditional sources, which compete with one another. The Nation and Fox News don't exactly report the same things. And on my cable TV, we receive news from all over the world, uncensored, in both the native languages and English. And my wife and I view many of them. And like many Americans living in the DC area we--especially she--has vast international experience, regularly talking with people from literally every corner of the world, often on topics of politics and economics.
On top of this long and diverse experience, I do read your views here, Hrant. I agree with about half of your views on typography, and almost none of your political views. Your view that my disagreements and those of many others here of all political stripes--is grounded in all of us being brainwashed, is insulting and lame.
I am an American, and I am very well aware of the horrible and tragic slaughter of Armenians, not least because one of my oldest friends is of Armenian descent, and her family was tragically shattered by that slaughter, and is still affected today. And she is American also.
Americans are an extremely diverse group, with about 10% of the current population from abroad (including one hpp), and with a huge range of knowlege of the world, from very ignorant to deep and broad knowledge. Of all nations painting Americans today with a broad brush just doesn't work. </div>

I am worried about both, but far more about their black-and-white perception, which I am convinced led to the election of Bush (the first time he wasn't elected). But is not a matter of being brainwashed, in my view. In my view is a matter of dysfunctional thinking in response to threat--exactly as Irving Janis described. </div>

Dennis says he prefers spending time being creative, which is cool, a part from the fact that if you make a living out of "being creative" you should also be interested in economics and you can't really separate economics from politics... in my opinion. Moreover, to do this job you need to be savvy. You need to know what goes on around you. Your work affects and influences people so you should be very careful how you use it. Nothing new here.

<div class=commentbody>"And they don’t exactly have the same number of viewers either.

It just occurred me that in order to have more productive discussions (on all subjects) maybe we should start introducing the healthy habit of citing sources or evidences. For instance Hrant should credit the source when he makes a statement. Just an example, ok? This will help keep our speculations and assumptions to a minimum and avoid misunderstandings. Don't need to exagerate but just give enough information so we can check the credibility of the source. Author, URL, date should be enough. If citing statistics (lies, damned lies and statistics) please mention who is behind those.
What do you children think about it? Could this help improve the quality of our discussions?
"But is not a matter of being brainwashed, in my view"
Totally agree with William.
Chris, it's fine, I know I can post start a new topic but maybe there are already too many general discussions going on...maybe later.

BTW Lore, how much time have you spent in the US?
Brazil and Italy (and even the UK) are very different.
Italians for example should be admired for realizing

<div class=commentbody>Of course I haven't been following Typophile much recently largely because of the issue raised here. Maybe Hrant should start his own political blog, website or whatever, dealing with political issues only. It is relatively easy to find on-line publications of virtually every political persuasion, espousing a bewildering variety of points of view. How much of this topic here is really about type? Yes, type and design can and do often touch on many different kinds of issues, mostly economic, i.e., open type as a format to promote the fortunes of big companies.
I love type, but I don't enjoy personal insults and I won't respond to them.

<div class=commentbody>Mike: "For an alternative perspective go here blogs.msdn.com/fontblog/
where absolute morons argue with each other about fonts and other stuff"
This may be entirely true, but some of those morons are us. And, we are talking about MS type, so we're MS type morons, thank you. If you read "Where does 96 DPI come from in Windows?", e.g. and all of the responses, you could also say, "what morons are sticking to a 20 year-old response to Early Video Card and Display issues, rather than implementing a transparent, and scaleable 21st c. GUI?"
We spoke of this issue in 2001-2 (Greg and I), and I begged for future MS OS to go straight on this issue, or at LEAST, offer the option of doing so. By straight, I mean report the pixels of the display and translate that into dpi based on the size of the screen. From there, maintain the 1 pt. = 1/72nd of an inch ratio, and let the user choose the point size they need from a range including tenths of a point. Does it matter if the user chooses a 12 pt that's 12 points? Yes.
Why? A. The approximate lengths of arms and distances from screens varies. B. the precise text size required by a user is a critical element in reading. C. "Actual Size" is important in some applications. D. if you'd done this from the first MS OS with TT, you'd have a fully scalable GUI by now, and would no longer have to worry about any of this.
Seems reasonable, but NO WAY.
Now, we have a situation, just on this little tiny "Cornerstone Topic", that's like a mirror saying "objects may be larger or smaller than a reality without quantification, sorry, go figure it out for yourself", and Users are saying "how come ______ ?" So, passions are rising, even outside of this forum.
Type designers, on the other hand, have it easy. A 72 dpi monitor reports in at 95.999 dpi? so if a 10 pt is needed the font is 13.333 pixels? we round it to 13 and it becomes the 9.75! pt all users get when they ask for 10 pt. on windows? How big that actually is on the user's screen? we'll never know! but as long as the next larger and smaller sizes don't work as well as the default, well, we've done our job!? :)</div>

<div class=commentbody>Wowie, look what happens when you're off the internet for a few days...
For the record what compelled me to start this thread was not the political discussions but the personal vendettas that seemed to be leaping from thread to thread. I'm not in favor of censorship, even of views I find offensive, but I was finding it hard to get to the content of some of the threads without wading through cheap potshots.
My ex-boyfriend and I had a system that worked for us for awhile. We had a code-word we used when one of us thought the other was getting nasty or inappropriate. Basically it was a way to keep our conversations on track and civil. I think it kept us from killing each other. Ideally it should be something silly, like "sprocket" or "wombat", that makes you smile even if your dander is up. Could of course be something typographic but I'm drawing a blank. I'm only throwing this out there as an idea because it would be something anyone could interject, not just a moderator.</div>

yep. And if you think about it, Cleartype was the "perfect" screen font solution, FontLab was the "premier" design tool for the professional, and ATypI was "the place to go" learn about it all. 12 moons later, however...CT turns out to be the perfect wysiwyg font solution, FontLab is unchanged, (shucks;) and ATypI is looking for its soul through the continued haze of misponsorship... so what's to argue about. :-)</div>

<div class=commentbody>Bless you, PattyFab for resurrecting this. I thought it was just me with this issue. I'll will post more later, but in the meantime, IMHO, some of the answers lie in the exasperating hubris, the humor police, the one-size-fits-all know-it-alls, those who post to see their name in a thread without saying anything, and those who start threads-within-a-thread without answering a poster's query.
These, for the time being:
=====
How many forum members does it takes to change a light bulb?
1 to change the light bulb and to post that the light bulb has been changed
14 to share similar experiences of changing light bulbs and how the light bulb could have been changed differently
7 to caution about the dangers of changing light bulbs
1 to move it to the Lighting section
2 to argue then move it to the Electricals section
7 to point out spelling/grammar errors in posts about changing light bulbs
5 to flame the spell checkers
3 to correct spelling/grammar flames
6 to argue over whether it's "lightbulb" or "light bulb" ... another 6 to condemn those 6 as stupid
2 industry professionals to inform the group that the proper term is "lamp"
15 know-it-alls who claim they were in the industry, and that "light bulb" is perfectly correct
19 to post that this forum is not about light bulbs and to please take this discussion to a lightbulb forum
11 to defend the posting to this forum saying that we all use light bulbs and therefore the posts are relevant to this forum
36 to debate which method of changing light bulbs is superior, where to buy the best light bulbs, what brand of light bulbs work best for this technique and what brands are faulty
7 to post URL's where one can see examples of different light bulbs
4 to post that the URL's were posted incorrectly and then post the corrected URL's
3 to post about links they found from the URL's that are relevant to this group which makes light bulbs relevant to this group
13 to link all posts to date, quote them in their entirety including all headers and signatures, and add "Me too"
5 to post to the group that they will no longer post because they cannot handle the light bulb controversy
4 to say "didn't we go through this already a short time ago?"
13 to say "do a Google search on light bulbs before posting questions about light bulbs"
1 forum lurker to respond to the original post 6 months from now and start it all over again.

There was a kid who left the farm to go to a big city university. When he came back on spring break, he exclaimed "I invented the universal solvent!" Whereupon the parents responded in unison "What do you keep it in?"
=====
A scorpion and a frog were at the bank of a river. The scorpion asked the frog to carry it across. The frog refused, saying "I will not, for you will sting me and I will die! The scorpion replied " I will not, for if I did we would both be swept away and perish". After considering this logic the frog agreed and the scorpion climbed on to the frogs back. As they approached the center of the river the scorpion stung the frog again, and again. As they began to sink the frog asked the scorpion "why, oh why did you sting me, now we both will perish!!?". The scorpion replied "It's just my nature". </div>

That's an excellent question. The difficulty I have is a conflict that I haven't figured out the best way to resolve.
On one side of the difficulty is that I don't want to let false and defamatory statements go without being contradicted, at least here where I am a participant or a target. This 'answering' is the only check and balance there is on the internet, or at least on Typophile.
The other conflicting side of the difficulty is that some people like quarreling, or at least can't help themselves. If you respond in any detail to such people, they will just 'escalate', piling on more personal attacks, defamation, rubbish and irrelevant arguments, etc. And there is no end to it.
Perhaps the best thing is just to contradict the defamatory statement, and leave it at that without going into detail, since any detail is fuel for the quarrelsome. At any rate, I'll try that in the future.
A great thing about internet forums, or at least this one, is that they are the most democratic institutions we have at present. Miss Giggles and Jonathan Hoeffler have the same status--open to all.
But it comes with problems. One problem is a lot of posts that you may feel are a waste of time. That is easy to deal with--just don't post. But defamation is a more difficult problem, and it is a major one on the internet. It may be wisest just to let it fly, but I doubt it. </div>

Untrue.
That's a very literal, formalist, Western view.
> they are the most democratic institutions we have at present.
Although technically not incorrect, this is a confusing use of the term
"democratic". In terms of governance (the usual association of the term)
Typophile is run by a self-appointed few. And that's why it works against
the odds (referring to our heterogenous mix) and is so useful.

<div class=commentbody>Trying to elaborate on what I wrote this morning, I've come to the view that the ideal member of Typophile is somebody who cares more about type than himself. But that being inhuman, the diluted version might be that a good member of Typophile is somebody who cares more about what people say about type than what they say about him. In trying to be like that, I honestly don't get very worked up when somebody calls me an anti-Semite or a clueless idiot; but as a rule I do very much get worked up when somebody says that a darker weight doesn't have to be tighter to work [as] well, or that Latinization is actually a good thing, or even something as esoteric as confounding the difference between display and text type. Ergo, try to care about things that other people care about: not you, but type.
