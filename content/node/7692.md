  body: <i>Lovely..</i> <BR> <BR>I may as well like it a lot <img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/bigsmile.gif"
    border=0>, even if I am not too sure about the &#39;x&#39;; the character between
    &#39;u&#39; and &#39;x&#39;; the &#39;s&#39;, it seems a tad too bold / too clumsy
    in the middle; and the top of the &#39;f&#39;; of &#39;Dilfana&#39;.. <BR><i>But,
    I love the &#39;a&#39;..</i>

  body: Impressive in that it is a strong, distinctive design idea carried through
    consistently. I like the art deco look also. Once you have solved the mwz to your
    satisfaction, I think it would be worth experimenting with different widths of
    counters, stems and spacing, to see if you can improve legibility without losing
    the &#39;look&#39;.  <BR> <BR>Since this will obviously be used only for short
    names and titles, such as the name of a restaurant, legibility is not the main
    thing, but still is always a consideration.  <BR> <BR>I think the v solution is
    clever, but you might try making it a bit wider. I agree with Dav on the need
    to polish the x and s. The top of the f I think is the only solution so far that
    needs to be changed. The notch at the top is distracting as it doesn&#39;t read
    &#39;f&#39; right away.

    don&#39;t think its classification should be a &#34;Sans-Serif&#34; - more like
