body: "Hello, \r\n\r\nI have posted previously a thread about my amateur attempts
  to make screen font display more crisp on LCD screens, while still preserving font
  shape. I would like to get some expert advice/opinion about the potential of the
  method described bellow to display screen fonts.\r\n\r\nIn my previous post (Help
  with font Rendering), Twardoch suggested the use of the \"Antigrain geometry\" library
  and Hrant reccomended Mana pixel font (which indeed looks as crisp as possible and
  very attractive). Thank you both.\r\n\r\nHowever, my goal is to have a method applicable
  to any font. I was aware of the Antigrain site, but since I am a beginner I chose
  a much simpler approach based on the algorithm invented by Kim Oyhus: SubLCD (http://www.oyhus.no/SubLCD.html).
  SubLCD is claimed to allow a 2x compression on the horizontal axis essentially without
  loss of information.\r\n\r\nThe obvious thing to do was to generate output text/fonts
  (as bitmap, DIB) at 2X higher horizontal resolution than requested, then resize
  it to the final dimension. \r\n\r\nI used Ghostscript (GS) to obtain the bitmap
  of a pdf page (antialiased fonts) (Image 1) then resized it (result: Image 2). Compare
  with Image 4) - GS output without any modification; The method produces some color
  artifacts that on some LCDs can be annoying.\r\n\r\nTo me, it seems that font appearance
  is more consistently preserved in Img 2 vs Adobe (img 3) and still readable at small
  sizes, but the color artifacts make this method still not very successful.\r\n\r\n\r\nPlease
  let me know what do you think about the results shown bellow:\r\n\r\n1. Ghostscript
  image: Original bitmap used to render the text: 2X size (180% zoom)\r\n2. Ghostscript
  image: Final text obtained by resizing 1) to 1X (90% zoom).\r\n3. Adobe image: The
  same text as in 2) rendered in Adobe Acrobat reader 94. \r\n4. Ghostscript image:
  Text at 1X (90% zoom) without modifications.\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/T3_All2_4481.PNG]\r\n\r\nThanks
  in advance for any comments\r\n"

    very simple. It has the defect of having much worse color-fringing artifacts than
    the approaches used by Microsoft and Adobe, and being less flexible in its use

  body: "Thanks for your input Thomas.\r\n\r\n From your comment and from the lack
    of responses I get that the only positive thing about this subpixel rendering
    approach is its simplicity. \r\n\r\n As you did not comment at all on the result
    obtained (img 2) I suspect that for a typographer's eye the fonts look really
    bad. \r\n\r\n I am certainly aware of the color fringing problem. I can also see
    myself that img2 has a lot of other problems, e.g. distortion on the Y axis (due
    to a very elementary resizing algorithm on this axis).\r\n\r\n I am currently
    trying to find a way to get read of the color fringing. \r\nFirst,however, I wanted
    to find out if this is really worth the effort.\r\n\r\n The main reason I started
    the thread is that I would like to find out if in addition to color fringing,
    for a typographer's eye font rendered using this approach have some other major
    flaws that I cannot see.\r\n\r\n <em>In other words, let's assume that I can get
    rid of the color problem (without losing sharpness): do you still see other major
    problems with this approach? Also take into account that the overall result depends
    on the quality of the input 2X-sized font. As you can see some stem do not have
    equal widths, but I think this can be improved.</em>  \r\n\r\nIn addition, I would
    not compare yet this crude SubLCD implementation with the optimized Cleartype
    or Cooltype. Both Cleartype and Cooltype are optimized to avoid color fringing.
    This however, it seems to me it is done at the expense of font shape and crispness.
    \r\n\r\nI have tried to apply a Cleartype-like algorithm for correcting color
    fringes, as described by Steve Gibson in his subpixel rendering page, on top of
    SubLCD, however, this obviously results in loss of sharpness.\r\n\r\nIn any case
    thanks again for the comment.\r\n\r\nP.S. I assumed that I would get more feedback
    from a typography site. As it did not happen (I cannot exclude that this is due
    to low quality  of the approach compared to the professional standards...), I
    would be curious if you know about other possible groups where I could get more
    feedback on this kind of problems.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    fact is your work is little better or worse than what Apple did fairly quickly
    and with little fanfare, or what MS did very slowly and with much chest pounding
    and self-back slapping ballyhoo. In low resolutions, there is no solution that
    'works for every font' without either destroying the letters, or the reader. Except
    for careful hinting, which was never tested, and which is not allowed in OS's,
    there are no good solutions, except, not to play. Apple strips most of the hints,
    and MS... some (try finding out which), leaving the traditional access between
    type designer and user, denied. We've discussed this for several years, and are
    not exactly freshly leaping to the topic any longer, for very good reason.\r\n\r\nCheers!\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: "As I understand it, any LCD-optimized imaging method is going to have a trade-off
    between color fringing and sharpness. There are schemes to try to optimize this,
    which I suspect are mostly highly proprietary - as David alludes to - so it will
    be tough to get people to tell you about them in detail. (In fact, I've just said
    about as much as I can comfortably say on the subject.)\r\n\r\nNote that Microsoft
    has sponsored research showing that there is considerable individual variation
    in perception/sensitivity to color fringing. So you can't necessarily assume that
    your own perception is typical in this area. MS's findings were that something
    like 10-15% (IIRC) of people were extra-sensitive. The percentage was higher among
    computer geeks.\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\nT"

    many complaints around blurriness.  The lack of fanfare shouldn't have been a
    surprise, given the  fact that their implementation of the technology followed
    Microsoft\u2019s \u201Cdiscovery\u201D and announcement of the technique. \r\n"

    black type. :)\r\n\r\nSimon: \"...there were initially many complaints around

    You'd have to  redefine \"technology\", \u201Cdiscovery\u201D, \"announcement\"
    and \"technique\", as you are using them here.\r\n\r\nAnd, here's a quiz just
    for Simon:  Which came first, World War II, or World War I? \r\n\r\nCheers!\r\n\r\n\r\n"
