  for Alice's Stick Cookies. The cookies are great but the design on the packaging
  sucks (at least according to the Instructor).\r\nhttp://www.magnificentgifts.com/members/821963/uploaded/ASC-8.jpg\r\n\r\n\r\nCan
  you guys recommend a typeface for the company name \"Alice's Stick cookies\" and
  maybe another face to go with the (miscellaneous) text on the box?\r\nI'm going
  for something that looks contemporary, yet organic, and something that feels a bit
  sophisticated but not 'elitist' since these are gourmet cookies afterall. Also,
  the typeface must be available in Font Folio.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe cookies are shaped-like
  biscotti if that helps in any way. \r\n\r\nIf you also have any other ideas on how
  to approach this, please feel free to chime in.\r\n\r\n\r\nThanks!"

    are appropriate given your choices?\"\r\n\r\nYou might consider Cronos. \r\n\r\nBut
    really the choice of packaging might be a better start. If you start with the
    box/container it might lead you to the right direction."

    Sans. It's trying to figure out a typeface's connoted meanings/symbolism(s) that
    I'm having a bit of a problem with. \r\nI'm still learning on what makes a typeface
    'contemporary', 'elegant', friendly', 'neutral', etc.- those connoted meanings.\r\n\r\nAs
    for the Font Folio stuff, it's the only source I have right now for typefaces.
    \ I'm a student which means I don't have much money to spend on fonts. I have
    to make do with what I have."

  body: "Mirko, you will never learn connoted meanings if you don't try and think,
    feel and see them for yourself.\r\n\r\nSure, people ask for font recommendations
    at Typophile all the time, and that's reasonable, because there are tens of thousands
    of them that could be \"out there\" at hundreds of obscure foundries. However,
    you have a manageable number to choose from and you know where they are, so knuckle
    down and plough through the Font Folio, and build a short list."

  body: 'A lot of trial and error is a good place to start as a student. Hopefully
    you are not expected to show up to class with the final project in hand. Sounds
    like you are in the beginning stages of the project. If you were to find your
    packaging and mock that up then come back with samples using typeface choices
    of your own we can then help you fine tune those decisions. '

  body: "Trial and error, right. You have to use your imagination as you're looking
    through a selection of candidate faces, asking yourself not only \"Does this suit
    the criteria?\" but more importantly, \"How could I make this suit the criteria?\"
    \r\n\r\nTypefaces certainly have connotations which typographers and graphic designers
    are aware of, but the reader is unaware of these. For the reader, the meaning
    derives from the page as a whole. Consider blackletter: what vibe does the reader
    pick up from such a style, Christmas or Fascism? (To name but two.) The designer
    decides.\r\n\r\nWhether a typeface will be perceived as \u2019contemporary\u2019,
    \u2019elegant\u2019, friendly\u2019, or \u2019neutral\u2019 depends on how you
    use it. Choice of style (weight, slant, horizontal scale), size, color, tracking--these
    are decisive.\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Miss Tiffany,\r\nWe're supposed to come up with roughs/mock-ups this week.
    Next week is the final week of class. I showed my Instructor what I've came up
    with yesterday and she liked the last one the best(which I also liked the best
    too) then the fifth one out of 10 roughs. I'm still playing around with roughs
    and layouts. I narrowed it down to Cronos and Optima for my logotype.\r\n\r\nHere
    are links of the original piece to be re-designed and my roughs\r\n\r\nOriginal\r\nhttp://img185.imageshack.us/img185/8761/originalid5.jpg\r\n\r\nFirst
    Choice (Cronos)\r\nhttp://img135.imageshack.us/img135/4033/firstchoicenm1.jpg\r\n\r\nFirst

    Type too heavy, too light, inappropriate, it sucks, John McCain, etc.? \r\nThanks."

  body: "Mirko,\r\n\r\nA few first view thoughts of \"firstchoicenm1\":\r\n\r\n- If
    the photo is full-color, why not have more color everywhere?\r\n- Are the cookies
    beautiful enough to merit a die-cut? If they are, what color are they? You'll
    want the color of the cookies to be harmonious with everything else you choose.\r\n-
    Could the lemons be used more dramatically? Does it have to be a photo? \r\n\r\nI'll
    add that at this point the type isn't necessarily bad. I like Cronos. Again, once
    the packaging takes on more direction you'll know more of how/where to use the
    type."
