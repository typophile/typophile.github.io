		<div class="commentbody">Nick, letterspacing in German is not different or new: it is a technique inherited from the fraktur days in which letterspacing was used for emphasis in the absence of italics. Letterspacing is a bad idea, especially in text, because it degrades word recognition; this isn't an 'Anglo aesthetic', it's functional. <BR> <BR>I think the appeal to Goudy's famous comment is misplaced: one shouldn't avoid letterspacing lowercase letters because Goudy said it was a bad thing, you should avoid it because it <i>is</i> a bad thing, and demonstrably so. <BR> <BR> <BR>This reminds me of an amusing point made during the keynote address at the ATypI conference in Copenhagen. The speaker was talking about the typesetting of various editions of the works of Kierkegaard (this was more interesting than you might imagine, as Kierkegaard had taken a keen interest in the typography of his books). In one book, Kierkegaard likens psycho-spiritual anxiety to being l e t t e r s p a c e d, a typographic metaphor that captures perfectly the sense of fragmentation. Of course, the early Danish editions of Kierkegaard were set in fraktur type, so the metaphor worked because letterspacing was the method used for emphasis. In a later edition, set in roman type, the typography was changed so that emphasis was indicated with italics; the editors took it upon themselves to change Kierkegaard's text to liken anxiety to being <i>italicised</i>.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">For display setting (like in that page 17), I think it simply reeks. But the case with immersive reading is different: slowing down reading for an emphasized snippet is actually a good idea I think - and letterspacing does that well, exactly because it disrupts boumas! Unfortunately, strong color variance does something really bad many lines before its positive effect could kick in: it causes an errant fixation. And this is why a Bold is typically too strong, and people just use Italic. A carefully-chosen Demi weight though (in an equally carefully controlled output environment however) works great, without the skew in the voice than an italic can cause. Italics are the safer choice though - a bit brutal and superficial, requiring less thought. <BR> <BR>&gt; The letterspacing of lowercase characters has <BR>&gt; an excellent precedent in older German culture <BR>&gt; &ndash; it was done for emphasis with the Fraktur <BR>&gt; types, because there was no bold or italic. <BR> <BR>Precedent, yes. Excellent, no way. That's like saying every neighborhood should have a horseshoe maker because in the past we didn't have cars. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR></div>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Fraktur, used for the printing of German for many years, often used letterspacing for emphasis. Was this a good idea, though?</p>
<p>Perhaps it would have been better to use Roman for emphasis. Perhaps it would be better, today, to use Fraktur for emphasis than to letterspace lowercase Roman.</p>
<p>It may be, though, that letterspacing is not all that bad. Excessive letterspacing slows down reading and word recognition. But a modest amount of letterspacing would not be harmful in that way. So, all that is needed is a tasteful control of the amount of letterspacing, right? Of course, the answer is no - because the amount of letterspacing that is slight enough not to be harmful&hellip; is also slight enough not to be unambiguously visible, and, thus, the intended emphasis would not be noted.</p>
<p>I think that perhaps the two issues need to be separated. On the one hand, letterspacing lower case is unambiguously a bad thing. But it may be that the Anglo esthetic of using italics (and then bold) for emphasis <em>is</em> foreign to German reading habits.</p>
<p>If so, it is not unreasonable to search for a reasonable alternative.</p>
<p>Use a demibold with slight letterspacing. Or use Roman and sans-serif with one as the emphasis type.</p>
<p>If the italic of Roman types is simply unfamiliar to German eyes, almost as much as Fraktur is to ours, then use instead the sloped italic of a sans-serif type for emphasis, even though the regular text is in a Roman type.</p>
<p>So, while we can criticize letterspacing of lower case as a poor choice for emphasis, if Germans wish to use a means of emphasis that happens to differ from the usual convention in other countries, they may have legitimate reasons - and so the search for a more suitable alternative is what is needed.</p>

<p>Aside: This book is the earliest I have seen a grottesque in use. Resembles News Gothic, btw. And, yes, it too was spaced for emphasis.</p>

		<div class="commentbody">Yes, there are a number of examples I have seen of this. I am specifically asking where I can see examples in Kierkegaard&rsquo;s early printed books (see John Hudson&rsquo;s post above about the ATypI conference in Copenhagen). If there are any specific references (bibliographic, scholarly, etc) other than photographic reproductions, I&rsquo;d be interested as well.</div>
