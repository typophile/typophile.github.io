body: I have come up with a flyer for my friend's street art, art show that includes
  a collective of street artists and photographers. I can't figure out what I should
  do to make it complete. I would like a second opinion on the colors, eyes, and any
  other input you might have. Thanks!!

    bomb is readable to the average person, but that's also it's downfall, I feel.
    \ It's not an overtly compelling piece that would draw different levels of artists
    and non-artists.  The eyes are a fine concept, but thinking about the action after
    someone says, \"Made you look!\" ... it's the quick look away like, \"No you didn't...\"
    .  That guilty snap away.  These eyes look down right bored, not surprised or
    amused or \"caught\".  Just some thoughts.\r\n\r\nbest regards,\r\ndaniel"

    if it's graffiti art, the \xABtype\xBB you used isn't suitable. \r\n\r\nAlso,
    maybe the concept should go further, like Platypus said before. You say \xABmade
    you look\xBB and the first thing you come up with is a bunch of eyes. Something
    a little more researched *excuse my bad english* might be more appealing.\r\n\r\nMaybe
    if you play on the curiosity of people. I mean the name of the expo is quite mysterious,
    so you could suggest \xABwhat\xBB made you look. Then again, don't show, suggest.\r\n\r\nHope
    this helps you,\r\nIsabelle"
