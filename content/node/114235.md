body: "Hi all,\r\nI'm working on a farm to table restaurant design. But it will be
  more than a restaurant, with packaging and food products down the line.\r\nI'm looking
  for a slab serif that has some light, somewhat feminine qualities. The brand I'm
  working on has a light feel to it, and I don't want to use a thick slab to move
  in on that.\r\n\r\nI know lots of designers deride archer as overused, but it's
  still stands up.\r\n\r\nJust wondering if anyone knows of a slab serif that has
  multiple weights that could have similar qualities.\r\n\r\n"

  body: Ernestine seems to be a fantastic choice. Further away from Archer but in
    case you want something warmer, I would recommend [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/hoftype/cassia/|Cassia]]
