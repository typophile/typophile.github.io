  thread in the wrong section of the forums, but I can't exactly determine where it
  should be posted (or even if posts of this type are even allowed here). Type ID
  seems like the wrong place as I already know of the typeface and its name. What
  I have to say here boils down to more of a request than anything else, so General
  Discussion seems the most appropriate of all the options available. Also, please
  look kindly on my possible transgression if indeed posts of this kind are not permitted
  due to moral or legal considerations.\r\nOkay, now with that out of the way, down
  to business! A couple of years ago, I came across [[http://typophile.com/node/31682|a
  thread on Typophile]] about the \"Spice Girls font\", a typeface I've been intrigued
  by ever since I first saw it in 1998. As many, MANY people will concur, this font
  has been searched for but never found. The thread I mentioned did, however, yield
  a possible lead: the pre-digital typeface called Tempor. (Thanks, Mike F!) According
  to my (admittedly limited) research, a specimen of sorts was published in <em>The
  Solotype Catalog of 4,147 Display Typefaces</em> (on page 157 according to Solopedia
  -- though I might be wildly off there). Unfortunately I am unable to obtain a copy
  of this book at the moment, so I ask: if any of you could please be so kind to upload
  a scan of this specimen of Tempor, I would sincerely appreciate it. It's a mystery
  I would <em>love</em> to help solve.\r\nOh, also, if anyone has <em>any</em> information
  on it, such as the name/s of its designer/s, foundry, known digitizations, I will
  love you forever!\r\nThanks for reading. :)"
