body: This is from an old printed sample. The font should not be distressed. The CAP
  "W" and the l.c. "g" scream Goudy to me but the swashed CAP "L" is illusive.  I
  have been searching foundries on line to no avail. The letraset Bookman bold from
  the mid 1980s has many similar l.c. swashed letters but no swashed CAP "L."
