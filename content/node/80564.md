  for my ignorance , i know very little about all this, I was hoping this was a font
  that is bent in photoshop or whatever but im not so sure, maybe the person designed
  it as a picture themselves, or played around with another font.\r\nAny help would
  be great...\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/gonutsfont_4283.jpg]"
