<p>This one confuses me.</p>
<p>I do not think the Trajan models and geometry have much to do with each other, other than the square. And I think contemporary sans faces, for the most part, pay even less allegiance, only a passing nod, to the Trajan models. IMHO</p>
<p>In your eg. above there is definitely little semblance to the Trajan. Well, the &ldquo;I&rdquo; is spot on.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Hi Michael</p>
<p>I neglected to include a reference to my [[http://typophile.com/node/49471|earlier blog post]] which explained the context a little more - this was an experiment following the geometry of the boundaries of those classical letters as measured by Tom Perkins in the article I mentioned there. As an example, he&rsquo;s convinced that one of the main geometries determining classical letter widths is the root five rectangle, (1:sqrt(5)). The B fits into one, the C into two, etc. So I created some guides along those lines and then drew a basic sans letter within them.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Interesting. I think it can be seen that the Trajan &amp; Appian inscriptions were freely brushed onto the stone before carving which would result in some accidentals and that the carving would add other accidentals to the letter shapes and proportions. However it is also clear that some form of detailed panning and marking out would have/did take place. Sign writers and letter carvers today who remain true to their craft do likewise and mark out their layouts using chalk or pencil to establish guides as to letter widths and spacing before freely brushing the letter forms. Some variants in letter shape and proportion must occur.
My thoughts tend to favour that these inspriptions were carried out my competent craftsmen who were well versed in the tools, history and disciplines of their trade. A competent letterer does not need or use geometry in application for the intrinsic characteristics of shape and proportion are ingrained and felt rather than measured.</p>
<p>Having said this I do think that the proportions of classic roman letters can be shown to have some reference to mathematics &amp; geometry. However I don&rsquo;t think that the inscriptions sited above were drawn with geometry before carving, these are letters constructed by craftsmen and not by mathematicians.
I for one would be interested in the detail of your study into the geometry of these inscriptions because classical roman letter forms remain very much a passion of mine.</p>
<p>I agree with Michael the sample shown has little semblance to the Trajan or the Appian inscription, but it is too small to really tell.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>&ldquo;Hey Graham, who is Arnheim, &quot;</p>
<p>He was a professor of phycology as you probably have found out by now, who was into the arts and the creative thinking process. Perkins makes reference to his essay titled &ldquo;A Review of Proportion&rdquo; in which he agues that proportion is relevant and appears in the things that display or show it. He identifies the proportions that make an ideal oak leaf which are not exemplified in any single oak leaf but every oak leaf contains elements of the ideal. I believe Perkins is saying that although it is widely accepted that the Trajan and Appian Way inscriptions represent the &ldquo;ideal&rdquo; roman letter the ideal proportions are nor exemplified in a single inscription nor in a single example, but rather demonstrated and contained in a variety of examples. Trajan and Appian show broad ranging changes to the &ldquo;ideal&rdquo; within themselves and you can see these changes as you look carefully at each line of text. Subtle and not so subtle changes appear in each line and from left to right as the craftsman makes changes to shape and proportions to fit the letters into the inscription. 
My thoughts are that the ideal proportion of the letter forms in these inscriptions were not demonstrated in any geometric drawing but rather are the result of knowledge gained from familiarity and knowledge acquired through doing and making. A simple example much loved by philosophers is the smell of coffee. The only way one gets to know what coffee smells like is to smell it. No amount of description or scientific mathematics can give someone and understanding of what it is to experience the smell of roast coffee. Similarly the only way to gain the knowledge of what is ideal proportion for lettering is to make letters in a practical application. 
Any references to the underlying geometrical proportion of the ideal form are long forgotten by the skilled letterer as they become ingrained as a part of the process of making good letters and arranging them well.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Thanks for sending the PDF Graham. I will read it today. And for the heads up on Arnheim.</p>
<p>Craig&hellip; I think one reason the P and R looked odd is that the interior of the bowl should align with the edge of the grid. Instead in the work above the whole bowl falls inside making the letters too narrow. There are several other characters that need to be nuanced width wise. You will notice in Tom&rsquo;s eg. the M violates the width by almost a whole stroke width&hellip; etc.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>You&rsquo;re right about the P and R bowl - thanks for pointing me to that mistake.</p>
<p>Thanks to both of you for the comments, too.</p>
<p>By the way, I maybe should repeat that this is just an exercise I see as a starting point for thinking about cap proportions. It has already been useful for me in realizing the variation of those classical cap widths. But I&rsquo;m not under the impression that those exact geometric rules (whether or not you believe in their determination of the old inscribed examples) will have a special rightness for a monoline sans letter anyway.</p>
<p>I got the Perkins article, by the way, from the book entitled <em>Font</em> featuring Sumner Stone and published by the Ditchling Museum in 2000. It&rsquo;s the same as the pdf that google turns up, but there&rsquo;s an additional page that shows two letters of a typeface under development based on the Appian letters and the geometry traced in the article. And it ends like this:</p>
<p>&ldquo;One last curious fact. Catich gives the size of the piece of marble on which the Trajan inscription is incised as 4 feet 5 3/4 inches high by 10 feet wide. This turns out to be a root five rectangle. Can this be purely coincidental?&rdquo;</p>
