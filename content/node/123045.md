    \r\nThe font is a digital version of Information Extra Bold Wide (Breitfett) which
    was designed by Friedrich Karl Sallwey in 1958 as an addition to the Information
    family. It is probably best known today from its use in Pablo Ferro\u2019s title

    the outfield. To attempt to duplicate the letters using an existing font could
    be more than a trivial amount of work, depending on how close a match was desired.\r\nEDITED
    TO REMOVE GUESSWORK:\r\nAs for the question of whether this was a photo-lettering
    era creation rather than hand lettering, about all I can say is that the letters
    work well together and could make an effective font.\r\n\r\nDon\r\n"

    although it does make some sense to think it was customised. Luckily it is more
    of an inspiration point than a reproduction so this has been very informative
    and helpful, thank you both!"
