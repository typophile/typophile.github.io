  a case and/or contextual alternates feature)?\r\n\r\nI know that there are typefaces

  body: I remember at least one thread where different caps styles for all-caps vs.
    mixed case were discussed. But it was about size and colour ("normal" caps looking
    too big/dark compared to lowercase, especially in context where the former are
    abundant, like in German). And the design was a (neo) grotesque. But maybe it
    could be useful for evaluating the right OT feature.

    set of caps to one another differently in the wider setting than in the narrower.
    I've never explored that possibility. \r\n\r\nCraig, yes I just used the 'case'
    feature to turn on the alternative A, like the alternative dashes, Spanish exclamation
    points, etc. I did a lot of stuff with CALT, but here I thought there were so
    many possibilities of how to mix the alternates that I figured just a simple 'on'
    or 'off' for all caps was best. Then if the typesetter wanted to get more fancy
    they could use the glyph pallet. "

  body: "Yes, the issue with {case} and {cpsp} is that, in current implementations,
    they both rely on users applying an All-caps styling.\r\n\r\nIn practical reality
    (in my sphere, anyway), many times all-caps text comes already set in capitals
    in manuscript; and most designers don\u2019t think/care to go through and apply
    a redundant All-caps styling to them. So both {case} and {cpsp} features have
    no effect on those settings.\r\n\r\nTo this extent, other approaches \u2014 like
    additional kern classes instead of {cpsp}, or {calt} rules instead of {case} \u2014
    are more robust solutions. But these are not fool-proof either. And figuring reasonable
    contextual rules for case-sensitive punctuation (many of which come in pairs \u2014
    e.g., parens, braces, brackets, guillemets) can be quite complex."

  body: ">If kerning is not turned, any method will look bad ... If they don't [have
    enough knowledge], there is nothing I can do to help them.\r\n\r\nWell, there
    is something you can do to help, and note that the problem is often with the software,
    like older Word and some publication programs that don't even allow kerning, especially
    if I've got it right, open type class kerning, to be turned on.  \r\n\r\nAlso
    are significantly different degrees of badness, so I still think there are trade-offs.
    \ \r\n\r\nTo analyze the trade-offs, let me call the one method \"space caps first\"
    and the other \"positive caps kern.\"\r\n\r\nFirst, notice that neither method
    is a \"pure\" method. At least the way I did it, I first had the right side bearings
    of the caps work decently with the n, o, and l. Then I adjusted the left side
    bearings of the caps to each other. And then I kerned the caps to one another,
    as well as of course caps to lower case. This results in a decently smooth spacing,
    with kerning off, and better with kerning on, but tighter than ideal for all caps.
    \r\n\r\nThe way you did the 'positive kern' method, you basically started the
    same way, but relied on kerning to make all the caps with visually even, wider
    spacing to each other. I'm not clear what you did about the right side bearings
    of the caps-were they all wider, to work with caps, or just the TVWY?\r\n     \r\nWithout
    kerning you are either way going to have noticeable problems with T, V, W, Y to
    lower case, but with your approach, since you've given them wider right side bearings
    to start with, they are going to be maybe still worse.     \r\n\r\nBut with the
    'space caps first' method you are going to get the same kind of spacing you had
    in the metal type days. And that I think is going to look acceptable to most people,
    and better than the method you followed, if kerning is off. \r\n\r\nThe drawback
    of 'caps first' is that without the \"all caps\" turned on, the caps will be a
    little too tight. But note that if the person is really knowledgeable, and knows
    to use 'all caps', they will probably get as good a result as  your method. Or
    they may not know about 'all caps' but will apply tracking to all caps words,
    and get the same result. So the drawback of 'caps first' is that the user will
    have to do an extra key stroke to get the wide spacing. \r\n\r\nThe drawback of
    the 'positive kern' method is that if the kerning is off, whether because the
    user doesn't know to turn it on or because of software, it will look worse. Also
    note that if they want to space out the caps in titles, they will lose all your
    kerning, and have more work custom kerning to get them right. So for that case
    the knowledgeable user will have more work with 'positive kern' method.\r\n\r\nAnother
    question is whether the tighter spacing plus tracking will be as good a result
    as kerning to the wider spacing. Kindersley thought so, but it may be that he's
    wrong and you can get a better default result the 'positive kern way.'\r\n\r\nWhat
    do you think?\r\n\r\nSo, summing up the pluses and minuses: \r\n\r\nSpace caps
    first, user turns on 'all caps' or tracks caps: \r\n+ without kerning you get
    'metal' spacing, which is acceptable to most readers \r\n+ with a knowledgeable
    user you get the same or nearly the same result as positive caps kerning\r\n-
    the knowledgeable user has to do an extra key stroke for all caps.\r\n\r\nPositively
    kern caps:\r\n+ default caps setting looks good without extra key strokes for
    all caps or tracking. \u2014Possibly better than space caps first method.\r\n-
    if kerning is off all caps looks bad\r\n- if caps are letter spaced, extra work
    kerning for knowledgeable user. \r\n\r\nSo I think there are significant drawbacks
    to either method. I was inclined to use the positively kern caps method, as you
    have, but a certain individual I will call the 'Vineyard Yoda' declared that if
    you don't space caps first you will never get them right. And being Yoda, I figured
    he knew about a few more pluses and minuses.   \r\n  \r\nAfter all this analysis,
    it occurs to me that you could combine both methods: space caps to each other
    at the tighter intervals dictated by caps-to-lower case, but then use kerning
    to space out all the caps. Would this be the best? \r\n\r\nI still don't see a
    conclusive case for one approach.\r\n "
