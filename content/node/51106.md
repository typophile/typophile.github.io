body: "I'm looking for a script font for a wedding invitation design I'm working on.
  The pattern I have created that will be featured prominently in the set has a slightly
  retro sixties feel, but I don't want the font to feel dated - I want it to come
  off elegant and high-style. I'm thinking less Brady Bunch, more Jonathan Adler.
  I'm thinking handwritten? Any suggestions? I gots designer's block.\r\nPattern attached
  below."

  body: "Here are the correct links for the last two fonts listed above:\r\n\r\n[[http://www.veer.com/products/typedetail.aspx?image=UMT0000329|Memoir]]\r\n[[http://www.veer.com/search/results.aspx?keyword=Dear%20Sarah&producttype=TYP&pricemodel=RM%2CRF|Dear
    Sarah]]\r\n\r\nOf the four fonts listed, Montague works the best for me, but there
    are many scripts that other might suggest that would work at least as well. \r\n\r\nI
    trust the pattern will be printed in a very light color, or on a vellum overlay
    -- otherwise any overprinted type will be almost impossible to read against the
    pattern."

  body: "It's not actually going to be printed on top of the pattern. The invitation
    has several printed pieces to it, and the pattern and the invitation itself will
    be on different pieces. I think that of the four, Montague was also my favorite,
    but maybe a little cutesy? \r\nTake a look at what I have so far for the invitation
    itself (attached). I like the way the roundness and uniformity of the Helvetica
    Neue is working with the pattern I think, but am torn for the script for the names.\r\n\r\n[[http://www.veer.com/products/typedetail.aspx?image=JBT0000078|Marmalade]]\r\n[[http://www.veer.com/products/typedetail.aspx?image=UMT0000111|Mr.

  body: "I was trying to avoid recommending a specific font for this project, since
    I have never been very fond of most mid-20th Century casual scripts. I thought
    it might be best to let others who enjoy those fonts make suggestions, but having
    now seen more of your proposed design, I want to remind you of what you said in
    your original post:\r\n\r\n\"...I don\u2019t want the font to feel dated - I want
    it to come off elegant and high-style.\"\r\n\r\nI do feel that all of the fonts
    you've been considering come across as being dated to some extent -- they're too
    clearly late 50's-early 60's in feeling. \r\n\r\nWould you consider a slightly
    more formal font such as [[http://www.linotype.com/62286/itcisadoraroman-font.html|ITC
    Isadora Std Roman]]? To my eye this font meets your stated criteria and also would
    blend well with your pattern and the Helvetica Neue.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Isadora

  body: I think you're right, some of the other ones are too retro. The Isadora is
    good suggestion. I will try it.
