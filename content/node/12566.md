  body: Keep it simply is my advise. I like the rough looks and feel of the typo,
    but I simply can't read it. Don't try to hard finding a gimmick or trick, by repeating
    the 3 first letters.

  body: I managed to find a <a href="http://www.ambigram.net/images/countimage.php?uri=images/temp-v.gif">solution
    to the V-V combination</a> when drawing an ambigram with this in.  Not an easy
    one to do at all!  Hope that this helps.
