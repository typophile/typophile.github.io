  body: "Bitstream Font Navigator 5.0 that comes with Corel Draw 12. It's a maginificent,
    super-fast font manager. I have about 70,000 fonts in my database and Font Navigator
    takes 8 seconds to start. Extensis Suitcase took 5 minutes (!) to start with that
    database on the same machine. \r\n\r\nBut when Linotype releases FontExplorer
    X for Windows, I'll migrate. \r\n\r\nAdam\r\n"

  body: I think you will find using <a href="http://www.versiontracker.com/windows/">Version
    Tracker</a> to be very useful. I don't know why no one has responded. I'm a Mac
    user, but a quick search there gave returned <a href="http://www.versiontracker.com/php/search.php?PHPSESSID=981ba9cfcba12bf1e7ad90d39aa25e05&mode=basic&action=search&str=font+management&plt%5B%5D=windows&x=0&y=0">these</a>
    choices.

  body: While my library certainly isn't as enormous as Adam's I've been quite happy
    with Suitcase 9.0 for the last couple of years. I tried 9.2, but went back to
    9.0 as it allows for temporary activation. The only downside to Suitcase (for
    me, at least) is no auto-activation, which Linotype's FEX is supposed to address,
    although I've heard that auto-activation is more or less impossible in the Windows
    environment. We'll see.
