  typeface from an original logo design.\r\n\r\nI've designed a logo for a client
  in which I designed every character of the the logo.\r\nI'd now like to create an
  entire typeface from those letters for my own use and to potentially sell to the
  public.\r\nThis typeface will not be available for my client.\r\n\r\nDoes anybody
  know the legal ramifications around designing a typeface in this way?\r\n\r\nIs
  it possible to do so or does the client retain ownership of the original typographic
  forms restricting you from creating the typeface?\r\n\r\nOr are you free to develop
  the typeface on the basis that you created the original forms?\r\n\r\nAny knowledge
  on the subject would be greatly appreciated.\r\n\r\nThanks."

  body: "I think it all depends on what you have agreed on with the customer. When
    you told the customer that you made him something special and exclusive, I think
    he\u2019d be surprised at least as soon as he sees headlines in the very same
    style that were made using your typeface. Just imagine someone using it for a
    similar trade or product \u2026 So when you are still on good terms with that
    customer I would not take the risk in spoiling the relationship.\r\nNo matter
    wether you have sold the customer exclusive rights to use that logo or not, when
    your customer and his lawyer are willing to see that you have been unfair or enabled
    others to mimick \u2018his\u2019 logo or whatever, you will be likely to spend
    money on a lawyer as well. In many countries, design protection is not precisely
    or properly (if at all) regulated or governed by law, so it usually all depends
    on how such a case is handled, defended etc \u2026 I think, this is not necessarily
    the kind of things designers like to occupy themselves with, let alone paying
    someone else to take care of that.\r\nSo when you sell something as a designer,
    not only make shure that you are getting paid reasonably for the job, also make
    clear agreements on which rights on your work you are selling to the customer. "

  body: "Is the logo just their name set in type, or is there also a graphic symbol?
    \r\n\r\nWhether it's legal or not probably depends on your contract with the client.
    Since many logos incorporate pre-existing fonts, your contract probably doesn't
    guarantees font exclusivity, does it? But if the logo is just type, or if the
    font was very distinctive, it would likely piss off your client if you make it
    into a font that anyone (even competitors) can use, since that greatly reduces
    the uniqueness of their logo.  And a pissed off client might sue you and/or start
    saying bad things about you."

  body: "Something else to consider: the chance that the original glyphs remain the
    same during the process of adding to them to obtain a full set is rather slim.
    You will probably change most of them because they won\u2019t fit the newer ones,
    or you change your mind about certain design decisions.\r\n\r\nSo why bother so
    much about something that is not a \u2018real\u2019 problem?"
