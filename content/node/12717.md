    find them useful.\r\n\r\nUsability Expert Jakob Nielsen's website:\r\nhttp://www.useit.com/\r\n\r\nUsability
    Expert Bruce Tognazzini's website:\r\nhttp://www.asktog.com/\r\n\r\nOutdated but
    nevertheless comprehensive database of some very useful websites on user interface
    design and information architecture:\r\nhttp://www.usableweb.com/\r\n\r\nAn association
    for Usability professionals worldwide. You'll need membership but I say its worth
    it.\r\nhttp://www.upassoc.org/\r\n\r\nResource for techniques on usability testing
    and heuristic evaluation:\r\nhttp://jthom.best.vwh.net/usability/\r\n\r\nAn HCI
