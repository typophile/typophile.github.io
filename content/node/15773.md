    admirer. From what my feeble memory tells me, Olde English was derived from blackletter
    manuscript. I don't know if there was a particular manuscript or just the genre.
    Dan will know though.\r\n\r\nChrisL"

  body: Each country in Europe had its own distinctive scripts, including its own
    blackletter, before type was invented. Typefaces grew out of these as typefounding
    arose in each country. Monotype Old English was probably based generally on Caslon's
    blackletter types.

    a generic design / revivial this cut will be credited to the Monotype Drawing

    start with the UK office. \r\n\r\nCheers, Si "

    states, though. Have you tried contacting Monotype directly? My bet is that it
    is an old Stephenson Blake, Caslon, or some other English foundry type.\r\n\r\n\"Old
    English\" is English Textura. Its roots go back to Wynken de Worde. Most of the
    fonts that we think of as \"Old English\" though are are ca. 1820s American lettering
    designs, or ca. 1890 English, late/Victorian historicist creations. I don't always
    consider them \"real\" blackletters\u2026 but that is just my opinion!"

  body: "I don't know about the relationship between Monotype Old English and Cloister
    Black.\r\n\r\nI do know that Cloister Black was a 1904 ATF design variously credited
    to Morris Fuller Bention or Joseph W. Phinney (though sources for the latter are
    stronger). It is a very similar but arguably inferior adaptation of Caslon Text
    (which I will not presume was necessarily a true Caslon face - c.f. Caslon Antique,
    a Caslon in name only for sales purposes).\r\n\r\nI also see that Mac McGrew shows
    that there was a Monotype metal version of Cloister Black. This confuses me, because
    AFAIK cross-licensing was not normally done back then between ATF and the automation
    companies (Mono, Lino).\r\n\r\nBrief geneological note: Both Joseph W. Phinney
    (1848-1934) and I are descended from John Phinney (1638-1718?) whose father John
    Finney arrived in America around 1638-39, along with his mother. John Jr married
    Mary Rogers, whose family had come over on the Mayflower. The patrinomial lineage
    can only be traced back to the 1500s, in Lenton, Nottinghamshire, England (a small
    village just outside Nottingham).\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\nT"
