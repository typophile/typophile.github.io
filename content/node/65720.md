  body: The sans is <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/fontlist/super_families/ff_scala/">FF
    Scala Sans</a>; the serif frankly is too small to allow for a conclusive identification,
    but it might be Georgia.

  body: Looks like the grey serif face is different from the bold italic, most probably
    a Garamond.

  body: I'm pretty sure it's <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/fontlist/genres/garamond/">Stempel
    Garamond</a>, but I'll need a larger sample of that grey serif face.

  body: Thanks a million. I actually own Scala Sans and somehow missed it when looking
    through my font library. I too thought Georgia and hadn't considered that the
    bold italic and regular italic were different fonts. Many thanks for your help.
