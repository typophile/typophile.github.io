  our body copy from a serif to a sans serif. We've been trying out some fonts, however
  are trying to find a font that has not been used by any mainstream magazines in
  the USA. We're drawn to fonts like Akzidenz Grotesk, Meta, and Whitney for their
  legibility and readability. However we would rather find something more independent
  with a unique personality. Readability is highest on the priority list. Next would
  be memorable ligatures and subtleties to the characters that could make the font
  unique to us.\r\n\r\nAny input or suggestions would be greatly appreciated!\r\n"

    one with a 'unique personality'. Why must it be a sans?

    are many others similar to Meta and Whitney, such as <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=verity.search&font_categories_search=font_name_search&searchstr=zwo&image.x=0&image.y=0\">Zwo</a>,

  body: My problem with sans serifs in editorial settings is that the base weight
    is just a shade too dark and becomes tiresome to the reader. Linotype Syntax with
    oldstyle figures has a base weight which I find simply perfect for text. It offers
    the perfect trade-off between delicacy and strength, and is always clear. Lots
    of weights make it very adaptable. Try it!

    Design, that's Art. For one thing, when you state \"Readability is highest on
    the priority list\" it simply doesn't jibe... Don't get me wrong, it's very possible
    that a sans would be your best choice, but I just want to caution against closing
    your mind based on preferences that don't actually benefit your readers/users.
    Once your basis is sound, then you can find a good solution. Another way I think
    you should put your readers first is by telling us more about your magazine and
    its demographic, instead of focusing too much on the context-less formal attributes
    of your \"ideal\" type choice.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
