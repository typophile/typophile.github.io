body: "First, I apologize if my questions have been already addressed. I did some
  minor searching, to no avail.\r\n\r\nI've recently decided to start a blog about,
  among other things, film and filmmaking. Particularly, I'm interested in writing
  in-depth reviews and analysis of films I've seen, both from the perspective of an
  audience member and as a would-be filmmaker.\r\n\r\nI suppose the first issue is
  the viability of using web fonts in the first place. How much testing should I really
  do? I don't have easy access to a Windows machine at the moment.... If I do use
  web fonts, I'd like to use @font-face.\r\n\r\nI've found a font I like for the body
  text\u2014[[http://www.fontspring.com/fonts/miller-type-foundry/mr-jones|Mr. Jones]].
  I don't want to break the bank, so I'll likely just use the Book and Medium weights.
  That leaves the question of what to use for headings and \"post metadata\" (date,
  category, etc). I was considering using [[http://www.fontspring.com/fonts/gatf/haymer|Haymer]]
  for this\u2014all caps, Black or Bold for the headings, and Light for the metadata.\r\n\r\nI'm
  not super fond of Haymer's lowercase, but I think the uppercase is quite nice. I
  was also considering the gorgeous [[http://www.fontspring.com/fonts/hvd-fonts/brandon-grotesque|Brandon
  Grotesque]], but it is significantly more costly (to me, anyway).\r\n\r\nMy amateur
  eye tells me that Mr. Jones and a nice geometric sans would be sufficiently different
  in personality that I could use them together. I think that Mr. Jones feels somewhat
  serious and corporate; stylish, but not so much so as to sacrifice readability or
  credibility, whereas Haymer or Brandon feel more playful, but still classy. That
  is, of course, according to my amateur eye.... \r\n\r\nNaturally, I am open to alternative
  ideas/suggestions. Thanks!"
