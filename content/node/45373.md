  webfonts are not just about replacing Verdana with a fancy freeware font.\r\nHere
  is an example where a certain text phrase is automatically replaced with a scalable
  vector glyph from a downloadable font. The underlying text stays untouched, so indexing
  and copy&paste work like a charm. \r\n\r\nSee the full article here: http://opentype.info/blog/2008/05/14/exploring-webfont-possibilities/\r\n\r\n\r\nEdit:
  changed \"graphic\" to \"glyph\""
