  \"Guilloche A\". I  am trying to create a guilloche pattern with it, and realize
  that I have no idea how to do it. Has anyone here used this font and do you have
  any tips for me? i.e. Suggestions for characters to repeat and layer?\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\nCarey"

    on MyFonts</a>?\r\n\r\n<cite>Under the keys A-U and a-u you find joining pieces.
    Under the keys V-Z and v-z I placed start- and endpieces. 0-4 are different lenght
    straight extensions and 5-9 are not quite so straight extensions. All other keys
    are corner pieces that can be used as stand-alones or put in rows to make for
    superb decoration.</cite>\r\n<cite>With a little bit of experimentation and maybe
    colored overlays you can achieve super-phantastic designs.</cite> \u2014 Gert
