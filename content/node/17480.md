  body: "Not sure what you mean by the first question. \r\n\r\nFor the second one
    VOLT can't currently convert OpenType Layout tables (GSUB, GPOS etc.,) into its
    own source format so it removes them when you open a font. \r\n\r\nYou could use
    a tool like FLAB to export a font + VOLT source tables - although in our experience
    this gives mixed results. "

  body: "David, \r\n\r\nThe *whole point* of \"Ship Font\" in VOLT is to strip the
    private VOLT tables from the font. If you don't want to do that, just use Save.
    \r\n\r\nVOLT strips existing OTL tables from a font when opening it because the
    purpose of VOLT is to create new OTL tables from the private VOLT data that the
    user edits. \r\n\r\nPerhaps I'll ask: \r\n\r\n1. Why do you want to use \"Ship
    Font\" while retaining the private VOLT tables? \r\n\r\n2. Why do you want to
    keep existing OTL tables when opening a font in VOLT? \r\n\r\nRegards, \r\nAdam\r\n"

  body: "I suppose we don't do a good job of explaining that one of the cool things
    about SFNT is that the font file is made up of tables, and you can define and
    add your own \"private table\" to contain useful information such as high-level
    hinting source code, or OpenType Layout source code, or comments, that can be
    used by a font development tool. That way you don\u2019t need to keep multiple
    files hanging around, all of your 'source' can be contained in a font file.\r\n\r\nIn
    most cases, you'll want to remove (strip) these sources prior to distributing
    a font to a customer, mainly because they add additional file size to the font.
    In other cases, say you're making an open-source font, you might decide to keep
    them in.  \r\n"
