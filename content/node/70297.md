  body: "In your examples the thing I find most distracting is the lightness of the
    numbers compared with the e-mail and website type.\r\nThat said, unless it's carefully
    placed inside the overall design, I find it's mostly distracting.\r\nAs an alternative,
    you could align the text right."

  body: "If the phone number is the crucial information and if you pushed the plus
    sign even a little further and gave it a colour maybe.\r\nBut I think a plus sign
    has a soul and should be treated like a letter. I say that because unlike an apostrophe
    or a hyphen it actually consumes almost as much ink as a lowercase o. If you want
    to optically adjust it you may want to align the vertical to the beginning of
    the line, but even that may look odd. \r\n\r\nE is too far from the O, HS is too
    close together compared to the surrounding P and O."

  body: I'm with oldnick, I usually opt for hanging punctuation. It's a sign of the
    careful, detail-oriented typographer.

  body: "Perhaps it is a little too bold of a move. Maybe it works best with just
    a slight overshoot like in the first one below. Much further and it starts to
    get wonky. \r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/hangingplus2_3846.png]\r\n\r\n<em>the
    thing I find most distracting is the lightness of the numbers</em>\r\nAgreed,
    the numbers seemed gigantic, so I shrunk them a point, but the difference in weight
    is a bit much. \r\n\r\n<em>E is too far from the O, HS is too close together compared
    to the surrounding P and O.</em>\r\nYeah I haven\u2019t done any kerning on this,
    as I didn\u2019t want to give out the client\u2019s real name and contact info.\r\n\r\n"

    accident. I say go for it. Be bold.\r\n\r\n<em>No a plus sign is not punctuation
    hahaha, like I said it has a soul!</em>\r\n\r\nIt's more punctuation than letter.
    It's not really used in sentences... usually only comes up when numerals are involved.
    Either way, I wasn't necessarily calling it punctuation, it's just easier to call
    it \"hanging punctuation\" (as that's what it's called) as opposed to \"hanging
    plus.\" Also, what you're saying is that punctuation doesn't have soul, which
    is also completely incorrect. :)"

  body: "'In a business card setting, is it ok/preferrable to hang the plus? I've
    never seen it done before'\r\n\r\nYou won't, because the plus sign imparts important
    information: it means 'substitute your national code for dialling foreign telephone
    numbers here'. It's not a punctuation mark, and it mustn't be overlooked. "

  body: "Glad you posted this.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the above comments, I would suggest
    not altering the size of the \u201C@\u201D symbol. Here, it looks disproportionate
    to the rest of the text. However, if you plan on adjusting for stroke thickness
    then by all means give it a try\u2014print samples to test reader cognition. \r\n\r\nAlso,
    if you intend to have the telephone number larger than the web and email addresses,
    I would enlarge it more so that it looks like you intended to be larger, as opposed
    to have enlarging it with point sizes too subtly to each other and the reader
    (or casual glancer) may not get the impression the the telephone is being emphasized
    over the web addresses. \r\n\r\nLet us know what you come up with.\r\n\r\nMike

  body: "Michael Rowley expressed my idea about 'why the plus sign here is more significant
    than punctuation' more seriously.\r\nBut also said \"I've never seen it done before\"
    well that's not a bad thing necessarily.\r\nI still think it's editorially wrong
    to hang it but who cares.\r\n\r\n3/4 numerals make more sense than cap height
    ones. Like fabulous said don't hesitate to add a tiny bit of stroke to compensate
    the change of weight. If your working in InDesign you can set a Character Style
    that scales type 75% and then adds a 0.05pt stroke. And then add a GREP in your
    Paragraph Style that applies you Character Style to \"Digits\".\r\n\r\nRegarding
    the @ symbol it is totally replaceable, as long as you find one from another font
    that matches your typeface."

    going to go with the non-hanging one. The more I look at it, the less it makes
    sense to hang it. Perhaps a bit too much of a sacrifice just for the flow of the
    column."

  body: Normally, the plus sign would not hang off the margins. In the case of its
    use in telephone numbers in some countries, however, the way in which it is used
    may give it a meaning that makes it appropriate to treat it as hanging punctuation.
