  body: It looks a tad heavier, but Elsner+Flake's digitisation of <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=catalog.fontdetail&displayfontid=EF.503.0.3&attributes.sampleSize=48&sampleText=SEARCH&sampleSize=24"
    target="new">Digi Grotesk N Condensed Semi Bold</a> comes reasonably close.
