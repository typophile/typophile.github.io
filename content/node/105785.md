  body: "I would greatly appreciate if anyone could point me in the right direction.
    I was asked to put together a logo with a similar font to the one used by king.com
    (creators of the Candy Crush saga app/game). The \"loading\" text seems to be
    Candice font, but what I truly need is the \"King\" text's font.\r\n\r\nThank
    you!"
