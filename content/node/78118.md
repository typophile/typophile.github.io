  experience of setting the \u02DAC and \u02DAF characters? I'm using old style numerals/small
  caps etc and I think the uppercase C & F look harsh but I'm not sure that small
  caps is correct either.\r\n\r\nAny ideas?\r\n\r\nThanks"

  body: I'd use small caps I think. Watch the kern between the /degree/ and the /C/.
    Have you tried putting the Fahrenheit and Gas Mark in parentheses? The slashes
    look a bit confusing.

  body: Looks like you could need a small cap degree sign as well.

  body: "Are you absolutely certain that you\u2019re using a /degree/ symbol there?
    It looks to me like it could possibly be the /ringaccent/ (as in \xE5) \u2014
    based on the not-really-circular shape and the wide fitting.\r\n\r\nDegree symbol
    (\xB0) = shift-option-8 (on Mac)\r\nRingaccent (\u02DA) = option-k (on Mac)\r\n\r\n(It
    looks to me like you typed the /ringaccent/ character in your post also. And the
    \u201C02DA\u201D that appears in the sIFR thread title is unicode for the ring
    accent.)\r\n\r\nIf I\u2019m right, see if changing it to a proper degree symbol
    doesn\u2019t improve the spacing between numbers, symbol, and units abbreviation.
    The caps might look less distracting when they aren\u2019t hanging out there on
    their own.\r\n\r\n"

  body: "As Ben says, the slash is confusing.\r\nEven with the correct degree character,
    \"C/350\" will still look like a semantic unit.\r\nTry putting some space either
    side of the slash.\r\nOr this:\r\n180\xB0C (350\xB0F)  Gas 4\r\nor\r\n180\xB0C,
    350\xB0F, Gas 4"

    was a Ringaccent - delighted to have got this correct now.\r\n\r\nHere's some
    options based on the suggestions - anyone care to give me a second opinion?\r\n\r\nCheers

  body: I think the first one looks best. But perhaps lower the degree sign to align
    with the top of the numerals.

    anyone has any help?\r\n\r\nhttp://tinypic.com/r/2n7dv91/7\r\n\r\nHave a look
    at the above - units such as cm and ml and kg have follow the number directly
    however lb and fl oz etc have a space.\r\n\r\nTo me this is inconsistent but I'm
    not sure what is the correct convention? Anyone know?\r\n\r\nMany thanks.\r\n\r\nS"
