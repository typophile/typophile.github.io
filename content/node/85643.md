body: "Hi. I\u2019m currently dealing with a licensing problem regarding an old PS1
  version of typeface Britannic (see image below) I got from a new client. As I decided
  to stick to the font, I of course tried to find out where I can get a license for
  me (and as well for the client!) and maybe an updated otf version of this particular
  font.\r\nThe file name BritaBQReg as well as the file info tell, it\u2019s a Berthold
  font from 1992. Berthold \u2013 as it seems \u2013 doesn\u2019t offer Britannic
  anymore. I found three versions of Britannic on myfonts by [[http://new.myfonts.com/search/britannic/fonts/|Linotype,
  URW++ and Elsner+Flake]]. \r\nBut none of those alternate fonts contain a regular
  weight. The medium weight is the most similar to it. But the really important thing
  about the particular font I\u2019m looking for, is the higher contrast and the more
  distinct endings like in the C or S. \r\nI\u2019d be happy if anyone had an idea
  where to look or ask. Thanks in advance!\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/britannicBQ_4782.png]"

    & I love the \"j\"! I'll be curious what you find."

    check mine because I'm not at the office.

  body: "I\u2019ve sent an e-mail to Berthold Direct Corp. what seems to be the legal
    successor of the H. Berthold AG. Also I asked if they have any information on
    it or if I could license the font directly through them while using a copy of
    the old ps1 version. We\u2019ll see."

  body: "As nobody answered to my mail over there at Berthold Direct, I started to
    research a bit more on the legal successor thing. Actually, there doesn\u2019t
    seem to be any real legal successor. H.Berthold AG was completely liquidated in
    1993. So, what about the font? Is it free to use now? Opinions?"
