Typography is a technology for the reproduction of text. Since a tombstone is a unique production, both in terms of being a singular material object and containing text that is relevant only to the individual there interred, typography strikes me as an inappropriately generic and industrial technology.

Alaskan: <em>You be surprised at how strict graveyards are about tombstone design.</em>

This is certainly true in large urban and suburban cemeteries. In North America, many places allow only flat, cast memorial plaques on concrete bases, so as to make it easier to cut the grass.

Thankfully, my local cemetery isn't like that.

		<div class="commentbody">Correction: They’re called monuments or memorials. It’s only a tombstone if it is on a tomb, which is a large vault, which is different from a grave. Also, the correct word is “cemetery,” not “graveyard.”

I may be an enthusiastic computer nerd amateur in the world of typography and design, but I was a professional in the world of monuments. I spent four summers of my youth working at my family’s funeral home, installing them in cemeteries (along with many other kinds of chores that you probably don’t want to read about here). And my brother is a regional manager for a major Canadian memorials company. And I live half a block from one of the biggest cemeteries in Calgary.

My brother used to have his own firm, before he (happily) sold it to the company he now works for. He used software called “MonuCAD” for the designs. Letters are (generally) sandblasted into the rock, not carved. Monument production is quite, quite industrial.

Could you have guessed that I’m a member of the Facebook group “You know you grew up in a Funeral Home if....”?

		<div class="commentbody">I make my living entirely from commissioned lettering and calligraphic work in Wales, UK and in recent years the request for hand carved headstones has increased enormously. The reason is that more and more people are getting fed up with the cold typographical approach of most monumental masons and they want to have something more personal and unique.
I can carve any typeface but type faces for 2D rarely work on stone due the influence and direction of light on the v-cut incision and most are not sympathetic to the chisel, wrist movement nor to the stone.
Letters suitable for carving are usually too heavy for typefaces as the horizontal lines in particular need to be heavier as the shadow reduces their weight. The weight of the letters will depend on which direction the stone faces and how much light falls on them and if there are any trees or buildings around that would prevent enough light to come through.
Every headstone I design and carve is individually considered for the needs of the family and its location and often I need to  personalize the letters and working with typefaces would restrict creativity and individuality.

stick letters - a popular theme

Cast Iron letters mounted on a wrought iron gate.

A complete and utter mystery. 

[img:sites/default/files/old-images/necropolis-mcmxx_4054.png]
CCC ligature!
These letters are cast lead inlaid into the stone. there are quite few tombstone from the same era around here with similar cast lead inscriptions, which possibly suggests that monument makers of the day could order them out of a catalog, which in a way makes it type.

 [img:sites/default/files/old-images/Necropolis-cathering_4448.png]
More lead 'type' from the same stone. I like the TH ligature.


[img:sites/default/files/old-images/necropolis_mona_4236.png]
This one, from an older stone shows some mounting details.

> at my family’s funeral home

My brother is a minister and has heard some interesting anecdotes from his funeral director friends. Like the time one of the funeral directors was listening to a ball game on the radio while driving the hearse to the cemetery, and was so distracted that he drove 5 miles past the cemetery, with a long procession of mourners following dutifully in their cars. 

When he realized his error he turned the hearse around in a parking lot, with all the mourners following him, and headed back to the cemetery. He expected the family to chew him out later, but they never said a word.</div>

I did a search on "monumental lettering", hoping to find the correct term, but it seems that there is no single word, and that phrase is often what is used for what the people who carved the Trajan column did.

So there you have it.

hrant, I've heard of some burial societies that will bury folks just wrapped in a sheet. But I don't think that's widely available due to burial rules. 

Some burial rules are actually cemetery regulations, not laws. For example, many cemeteries require that caskets be enclosed in a burial vault (typically a concrete box with a lid) in order to prevent the grave from sinking when the casket decomposes. 

Cemeteries don't want sunken graves because its unsightly and families complain. It can also cause headstones to tip.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Having taken another look at this thread, I will say that typography involves type.

I'm easy - I'll accept a typewriter (after all, it could be a Selectric Composer) or Letraset.

But <em>calligraphy</em> is not typography. And so the <em>typical</em> or at least traditional case of headstone preparation, where letters are carved by hand isn't typography either. And, even if you were referring to the cases which are typography, I was referring to that other case.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">No, it isn't. But it's certainly strongly <em>related</em> to typography. Calligraphy, or other lettering arts where care and attention is applied to the form of letters, are the fundamental sources on which type design draws. (Yes, I recognized the Trajan column there.)

Of course, in calligraphy - or inscription engraving - one doesn't just apply care and attention to forming the letters, one also places them on the surface. So calligraphy embodies <em>both</em> the same basic creative processes as type design <em>and</em> typography.

Since calligraphy and similar arts resemble type design and typography both, and not just typography alone, the distinction between them and typography is one important to retain.</div>

That is true of calligraphy <em>as usually practiced</em>, since most of the time established writing styles are followed. But in principle, since the calligrapher forms his or her own letters, calligraphy can include a portion of what type design involves.

And, indeed, many type designers <em>were</em> also calligraphers, and used this skill in the beginning stages of designing typefaces. Of course, they then had to involve themselves in certain explicit processes alien to calligraphy, such as allocating the space between pairs of letters to the individual letters on each side... I am willing to split any hairs that are needful to split, but before the need is discovered, I will not delve too deeply.</div>

The calligrapher is always concerned with letters that are suitable to the text, forever concerned with spacing and interlinear spacing, knowledge of layout and placement, the ability to intermix styles effectively, etc. ad nauseam. Absolutely no relation to typography :-)

There's definitely overlap between any two activities concerning the visual representation of language. But the things that make type design <em>worth having invented</em> are not things present in calligraphy (or even lettering). Otherwise why invent it? Unless you -like Noordzij- believe that printing was a "fall from grace"... In fact now that calligraphers are largely useless for the rendering of highly-readable text* I believe calligraphy is most valuable when it doesn't worry about legibility, even color, etc.

* Something that's been true for centuries, so it's not like it happened after anybody currently alive made their career choice.

		<div class="commentbody">Hrant: <em>But the things that make type design worth having invented are not things present in calligraphy (or even lettering). Otherwise why invent it?</em>

Um, speed of production? Setting pre-cast moveable type massively speeds up the production of texts, not only is it more massively more efficient than writing by hand each individual copy of a text, but also faster than other printing methods such as block printing, and the metal type is more durable than other printing materials so can be re-used again and again. Even if typography had never progressed beyond Gutenberg's carefully emulation of the formal manuscripts of his text culture, it would have been worth inventing for those reasons alone.

The secondary breakthrough was the realisation by Aldus and others that type could consistently produce smaller text than scribes habitually wrote -- which is not to say that a good scribe couldn't write at those sizes, only that they tended not to --, and that this was still readable. This is where type becomes interesting in its own right, independent of writing, because small sizes require optical adjustments in order to obtain good legibility. The Elzeviers got a bit carried away with this idea: I have one of their small format books set in pretty excruciatingly small type.

So, speed of text production and copying is the primary reason for inventing type, and later other benefits are identified. And <em>then</em> some important distancing from chirography starts to occur, as a cultural and technical response to the capabilities of type: these developments were not intrinsic to or even evident in the original invention.

And for most of the history of typography, it exists alongside a vibrant and important scribal culture. A lot of people imagine that Gutenberg killed off scribal culture, but it simply moved out of book production and into secretarial work, from whence it continued to influence text culture and typography. Scribal culture didn't die until the typewriter. So we've had a very short period of history, a little over a hundred years, in which our text culture has been predominantly typographic, rather than a mix of type and writing, preceded by almost 500 years of mutual development, and a much longer history in which writing was the only game in town. I'm frankly not surprised that type is only recently easing itself out of its long relationship to writing. And I think it is noteworthy that 'script' fonts are perhaps even more popular today than ever before.</div>

OK, I can grant you that - although the invention of printing did nonetheless make scribes much less important. But anyway that's still before anybody currently alive had to make a career choice. Ergo: no excuses about confusing the contemporary [ir]relevance of calligraphy.

As for the modern popularity of script fonts: part of it is that we now have the technology to do it justice (the magic that Excoffon pulled off with Mistral is now ho-hum); and people value what they no longer have, even if it's pretend.

I will thow in a analogy -- please show me where I take a wrong turn.

There used to be a time when, if you wanted to have your portrait done, hiring a painter was the obvious solution. Then photography was invented, and since then you had a choice. Over time, photography proved to offer many great features. It became more affordable than painting, reproduction became easier, you name it. For some time it may have offered fewer creative or expressive possibilities then painting, but that changed too, and today's software enables the photographer to almost work like a painter. Likewise, painting has borrowed a thing or two from photography. 

I think no one would claim that painting has become irrelevant.

Now, substitute calligraphy for painting, typesetting for photography and text for portrait, and -- at least to me -- all of the above still makes sense. What am I missing?

Actually, I think a very strong case can be made that the opposite is true. Print publishing contributed the growth and spread of the renaissance, of new kinds of texts, and the age of European exploration, all of which resulted in a huge increase in written materials. By the 18th Century, the call for professional clerks was such that entire orphanages in London were dedicated to training their charges in the twin skills of writing and accountancy.

It is only in the specific field of book publishing that scribes ceased to play as important a role as they had prior to Gutenberg's invention; in every other field their role increased in importance.</div>

But here are some thoughts that tie the two subjects together. As some of you know, I've been doing research over the past couple of years on what might be termed the 'pre-history' of Baskerville's types. I've got a pretty well documented narrative now for the development of what I call the 'English Roman' in writing and engraving from 1690 onwards, showing how, by the time Baskerville asked John Handy to cut it in type, the style was a standard part of the repertoire of any writing master. I'm now looking at the expression of the style in stone cutting, some of it also pre-dating the type but, alluringly, possibly involving Baskerville himself. And just last week I was startled to find an example of a French pen written and engraved roman that predates my earliest English example; it is distinct in style, but important at least as a parallel development.

Anyway, here are some fine -- slightly later -- examples of the style cut in stone, all from a single graveyard in the English midlands:

I think it is entirely likely, considering the way in which engraved designs of similar style were produced, that the layout of these stones was first produced by writing (at reduced scale of course).</div>

I too am eager to hear more about your research, John. Thanks for posting the pictures. The Dawkins looks a bit like proto-ITC design! 

One thing I notice about most of these: the outstroke (or whatever you'd call that "tail" at the lower right) of /a/ is substantial in size and is given generous spacing. It's far closer to to the analogous part of a /t/ than that of a /d/.</div>

<em>Actually, I think a very strong case can be made that the opposite is true.</em>

And you would be, of course, gravely mistaken. What movable type actually did was to vastly expand the base of literacy, since manuscripts of all kinds could be mass-produced. It took the invention of the typewriter, several hundred years later, to transmogrify the process of personal correspondence, as well. Duh.</div>

Totally true, I did create another thread (which you have already participated in), and I’ll still make the same point. Tangential conversations that tank a thread are a deterrent to new users. They see it as meandering in-fighting and perceive the site as having less value because of it.

I trust you have noticed its always the same 6 guys, and that ~80% of the site has turned to "whats this font?" by users with accounts that are <24h old.

Obviously its self-defeating to try to control others behaviour in a public forum, but its just something people might want to be mindful of.</div>

Sad, but true. Plus, is there really a point in trying to control's Nick Shinn's “behaviour”? He’s just going to flip you the bird when he runs out of trite shit to say…not unlike Ryan, but with British spelling, don’t you know.</div>
