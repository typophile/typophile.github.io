  body: Bespoke. You'd probably get a name [[http://www.creativereview.co.uk/cr-blog/2014/june/wired-redesign|here]].
    All new typefaces have been designed by [[http://www.a2-type.co.uk|A2 Type]].

  body: Ha ha, completely wrong! Don't even remember previous asking :D Next time
    I'll try to check types before speaking. Funny to read that all fonts are claimed
    bespoke and designed by A2 on this CR article and finally one happens to be commercial
    available. The way it has been written let me thinking it could have been based
    on Beckett A2... But I probably missed something.
