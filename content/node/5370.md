  body: ' Thanks for the encouragement. <BR> <BR>Can I point your attention to the
    &#34;construct 11 pt&#34; versus the &#34;construct 12 pt.&#34; Notice the UC
    B and E, <BR>how the 11 pt has one pixel cross bars and the 12 pt has two pixel
    cross bars... <BR> <BR>I like the one pixel version because it is reminiscent
    of extra black wood type and seems  <BR>somehow appropriate and forgivable given
    the scale. However, is this awkward or somehow  <BR>historically inaccurate? What
    do you think? <BR> <BR>I&#39;m hoping to get this thing ready before bukva:raz.
    I think I better finesse my Russian  <BR>for the proofs though. Lorem ipsum doesn&#39;t

    <BR>me in these forums. I can take it. =&#41; <BR> <BR>Tanya, I have to agree.
    Looking at this again after  <BR>several months, the inline is much truer to the  <BR>constructivist
    inspiration than the outline. <BR> <BR>By the way, while we&#39;re talking about
    Cryrillic  <BR>alphabets, check out House Industry&#39;s latest <BR><A HREF="http://www.houseind.com/samples/chaletfamily/sampl_cyr_fonts.html?cart=311528552347396"
    TARGET="_blank">Cyrillic addition</A> to their Chalet Comprim&eacute; family.
    <BR>Well done. In my opinion, the alternates &#40;see <BR>the Kiev 80 and St.
    Petersburg 80 weights&#41; are <BR>truer to Cryillic heritage with the flared
    K, etc. <BR> <BR>But do yourself a favor and request the new <BR>catalogue, their
    site doesn&#39;t show the versatility <BR>of this family very well &#40;i.e. inline!&#41;

    my &#42;latin&#42; chair. I do have a couple of comments, but don&#39;t know the

    Slavonic. Now we call it just 'y'. It's a variation for '\u0438' ('i') in fact.
    And when '\u0438' comes after soft consonants, '\u044B' is after hard ones.\r\n\r\nTo
    understand the difference you can substitute it with \u042A and \u042C \u2014
    hard and soft signs:\r\n\_\_\_\_'\u0440\u044B\u0431\u0430' \u2014 ryba [r\u044Aiba]
