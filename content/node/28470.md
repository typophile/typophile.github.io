  now, I'm a bit of a noob, but I've read some books on typography and can't remember
  ever encountering the term 'volume' in reference to a typeface. \r\n\r\nAnyone here
  able to point me to some references or offer a definition?"

  body: House Industries has a whole lot of stuff that can connote volume. Latin volume,
    spooky volume, jazzy volume, skanky volume, they've got it.
