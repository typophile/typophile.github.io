body: "hey members and professionals,\r\n\r\ni have a general question regarding ligatures.
  i know ligatures from books, usually used when it's long text. for ME ligatures
  have an old-style look and feel. nice, but i wouldn't use it in business letters
  etc.\r\n\r\nwe purchased the font kievit to use as corporate font.\r\nnow my client
  wanted to know how to use the ligature. i proposed not to use the ligatures, because
  of what i've already written.\r\nmy clients opinion is that it gives a sophisticated
  feeling.\r\nwe both asked ourself, is it just a matter of personal and subjective
  feeling? and why not use it everywhere? \r\n\r\nsorry i am still a design student...\r\n\r\nWHEN
  DO YOU USE ligautres? would you use them for a company which does marketing, design
  and communications?\r\n\r\nopinions greatly appreciated :-)\r\n\r\na."

    if the ligatures are too noticable, the addition of them could come off looking
    strange in places like faxes and letters.\r\n\r\nIn general, I would say inclusion
    depends on the face and instance. For example, Kennerly \"fi\" ligature would
    be fine -- maybe even preferable to none, but \"st\" (overhand swoop connection)
    would be a bit strange.\r\n\r\nHrm... if your client needs help with using specialized
    characters, maybe they should steer clear anyway."

    you are a persuasive person.

  body: "I'd generally agree with the two above.  While \"fi\" \"ff\" etc might be
    subtle enough to not be noticable, something pronounced and unexpected might be
    completely distracting.  One might spend time pondering the ligature and miss
    the point of the text completely..\r\n\r\nor maybe that's just me. hm\r\n"

  body: "Considering that the standard <cite>f</cite> ligatures are meant to improve
    legibility, I see no problem with using them. In most good fonts, the reader will
    not even notice a standard ligature, which are meant to be quiet and unassuming.
    To me, <cite>not</cite> using the <cite>fi</cite> usually adds unnecessary weight
    and offsets the color balance of the page.\r\n\r\nOf course, I would stay away
    from the discretionary (ct, st, etc.) ligatures in almost every business setting."

    all depends on how much they're paying you! I find few things more pleasurable
    than firing a cheap client who doesn't trust my judgement. ;-)"

  body: "With almost any font, the standard f-ligatures should always be used, if
    present and usable automatically in the software the client is using. If the f-ligatures
    are ungainly and stand out, that design is arguably defective and shouldn't have
    been chosen in the first place.\r\n\r\nArchaic ligatures such as ct and st are
    a different matter, of course, and have no place in typical business usage.\r\n"
