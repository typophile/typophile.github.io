  body: 'Back in school, I saw Tufte speak &#40;on the school&#39;s dime&#41;, and
    admission included his 3 books. For those who haven&#39;t seen or read him, it&#39;s
    quite fun and informative. He essentially walks through his books, which is good
    or bad depending on your expectations. I think he&#39;s a necessary component
    of any info designer&#39;s education. However, like any source of wisdom,&#42;
    I found it was best to read it, revel in it, then rebel against it. Tufte-esque
    infographics became the new Swiss modernism for some people: &#34;this work is
    good because it looks like X.&#34; <BR> <BR>Everyone who reads that should read
    Nigel Holmes&#39; <a href="http://search.barnesandnoble.com/booksearch/isbnInquiry.asp?userid=AQv1v3Mqi6&amp;isbn=0823013383&amp;itm=5">Designer&#39;s
    Guide to Creating Charts and Diagrams</a>. He helped define <i>Time</i>&#39;s
    info-graphic style for a period, and Tufte can&#39;t stand him. I mostly can&#39;t
    stand him either, but he occasionally alights on some great ideas. At the very
    least it&#39;s good for a contrasting perspective. He represents, in many ways,
    the info-graphics philosophy that Tufte called for a break from: the idea that
    info-graphics are inherently boring and need to be spiced up and dressed up as
    illustrations. <BR> <BR> <BR>&#42;up for debate'

  body: Chris makes a good point. <BR> <BR>Tufte&#39;s courses are basically &#40;convincing&#41;
    sales-pitches for better information design. He&#39;s also a fun speaker with
    actual compelling case studies. <BR>

    ALT=":-&#41;" BORDER=0> <BR> <BR>personally tufte leaves me with mixed opinions.
    i applaud his approach of getting information design out to the masses, and his
    books are beautifully produced &#40;i have them all&#41;.  <BR> <BR>but his methods
    and opinions often leave my jaw dragging on the floor! i was very excited in atypi
    99 in boston to see him give the keynote, as i had never had the opportunity before.
    it &#42;was&#42; interesting, but i felt i was expected to stand up and shout
    &#39;right on&#39; and punch the air after every point he made. <BR> <BR>god,
    i&#39;m such a cynic...

  body: Matt, best of luck getting lift. As for Tufte, I feel <i>exactly</i> the same
    way as you. And I&#39;ve heard that only the first book &#40;which I own&#41;
    is really good. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>
