  is the highest form of printmaking known, some of the shapes in letterforms today
  originated with the restrictions and idiosyncrasies of engraved lines.  The contemporary
  font \"Burin\" is based on engraver's lettering styles.\r\n\r\nBut what has become
  of this noble art, now relegated to museums, art history books and sometimes, wedding
  invitations.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Presses_5492.1.jpg]\r\n\r\nThis
  is the story of a 5-year journey in search of an engraving proofing press.  These
  presses have not been made since before the 1950s.  Once ubiquitous as the many
  small print shops in any decent-size town, these little presses proofed engraving
  dies or were used for deep impressions in blind embossing work.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Presses_6659.embossing.jpg]\r\n\r\n(For
  the complete story, download the .pdf file attached to this article.) \r\n\r\nIn
  a nutshell, two presses were finally located in New Haven, CT.  Grant funding was
  secured but between the time the grant was written and the funds were awarded, gas
  prices had sky-rocketed, making the trucking charges exceed the grants.  Also, by
  the time we were ready to ship, the original trucker had closed operations in Louisiana,
  which is where the presses were to go.  The presses were trucked from New Haven
  to Conway, AR where we went to pick them up in our truck.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Presses_6380.4.jpg]\r\n\r\nThey
  were delivered on a busted palette which was loaded to the bed of our vehicle.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Presses_4373.6.jpg]\r\n\r\nTogether
  the presses weigh about 500 pounds.  Individually the components consist of the
  press containing the \"force\" which is like a big screw and a cross bar with two
  heavy metal balls, one on each end.  Through the sadly mangled shrink-wrap, the
  manufacturer was almost readable.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Presses_4758.5.jpg]\r\n\r\nIt
  is 400 miles from Conway, AR to where we live in south Louisiana.  The presses were
  moved from the truck bed to our garage by a 2-ton shop crane.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Presses_4654.7.jpg]\r\n\r\nHere
  the presses are assembled, the tall one is 28 inches in height and the cross bar
  is 34 inches wide.  Each ball is approximately 5 inches diameter.  Most of the presses
  are steel but the fitting on the top of the force is brass.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Presses_6248.8.jpg]\r\n\r\n[[http://nancysharoncollinsstationer.wordpress.com/]]"
