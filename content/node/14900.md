body: "Since I'm a layman in typography, I'm puzzled by a passage in \"Letter Froms\"
  by Stanley Morison.\r\n\r\n\"The present Corpus will make possible, for the first
  time, close comparison of body sizes and will establish the mathematical relation,
  for example, of the French, German, English and Dutch \"Cicero\". It was an economic
  disadvantage to the printer when, as in the instance of such a frequently used body
  as \"Cicero\", the German body was larger than the French.\"\r\n\r\nWhat dose the
  \"Corpus\" in the first line mean? \r\nDoes Stanley Morison want to say that due
  to different difinition of Cicero, the German body was larger than the French in
  the same amount of Cicero?\r\n\r\nThanks for all the replys that helps.\r\n\r\np.s.
  Sorry, Rugen, I failed to post pic in my last post.\r\n\r\n"

  body: "According to <a href=\"http://cgm.cs.mcgill.ca/~luc/measurements.html\" target=\"_blank\">Luc
    Devroye</a>, the difference is:\r\n\r\nFrench system, after  Fournier: 1 Cicero
    = 0.1648 inch\r\nGerman system: 1 Cicero = 12 Didot-Punkte = 4.404 mm = 0.1733858
    inch\r\n\r\nWithout knowing the context of the quote, I would suggest that \"corpus\"
    refers to the body (cast metal slugs) of some typeface, since corpus is the Latin
    word for body, from which we get <em>corpus delecti, habeas corpus</em>, corporal,
    corpulent and corpse."

  body: "The way he's using \"corpus\", and the way it's used in some fields like
    linguistic analysis, it seems to mean a collection of data, generally intended
    for numerical analysis.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "A corpus is a collection of texts \u2013 especially the complete works of
    an author or a body of writing on a particular subject. I believe that he is referring
    to different sizes used in different nations, as printing developed alongside
    measurement systems the sizes would be based on a fraction of a national or local
    standard.\r\nTim"

  body: "since Stanley Morison used uppercased \"Corpus\", now I'm wondering if he
    is refferring to some specific book or collection of texts.\r\n\r\nAnyway, I'm
    very appreciated of all your replys."
