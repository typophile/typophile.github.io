body: "This might seem like a stupid post, but I'd like to hear your opinions on this
  grid I've created for a brochure (76 pages).\r\n\r\nI've given extra space to the
  inside margins, set up my column gutters to 12pt, which matches the baseline grid
  leading. I've also set my column height to be divisible by the 12pt baseline, so
  I've got 61 lines fitting snug.\r\n\r\nAre there any fine details I'm missing? I
  know it's hard to comment on a grid without knowing the content that will populate
  it, but I'm trying to get more detailed oriented with my grid structure, and thought
  I might be able to get some good tips here."

    figure out if it works for your project. This is pointless."

  body: "Hard to evaluate a grid by itself. Put in some dummy heads and text and see
    how it works.\r\n\r\nAnd will the pages have headers or footers? Page numbers?
    \ Those need to be in the grid too."

  body: Back in my former life as a magazine designer, I found that odd numbered column
    grids are much more flexible. 7, 9, 11, 13 will give you much more freedom than
    the 6 column grid you show.

    spine.\r\nHowever, for the \"proper\" margins of a book, consult Bringhurst."
