  body: Everytime they renovate the library at my college, the area for books gets
    smaller and more PCs are added. I would say that about 15% of the space is for
    books now. (They recently eliminated the LP record collection, and stacked them
    up on the staff lounge table, free for the taking. Someone more industrious than
    me could probably clear a grand or more selling those things on Ebay.)

    pretty clear signal you're talking crap.\r\nhyperbole and sarcasm are great friends;
    they vacation together.\r\n\r\nand \"nearly all\" is yet another clear signal.
    \ judging by the numbers\r\nfor internet-exploder-6-and-7, many of our computer
    screens now\r\n(even in the first world) are hooked up to aging p.c. machines
    which\r\nmight not even have (working) printers attached to them any more...\r\nand
    inkjet printers (and dot-matrix?) aren't exactly known for quality,\r\nespecially

    enabled only or primarily to preview print on computer screens, \r\n>   print
    will never die! ;)\r\n\r\nagain, the word \"only\" here is an _obvious_ tipoff
    that this is sarcasm,\r\nand \"primarily\" right behind it just means that it's
    not purely sarcastic.\r\n\r\nthe notion that any significant number of people
    print out their e-mail\r\nto read it was buried -- along with those oldsters --
    in the last century.\r\n\r\nand i've never heard -- not even once, not even in
    jest, mind you -- that\r\npeople print out their twitterstream to read it.  (but
    it'd be a good joke!)\r\n\r\nnor do we hear about blog posts being printed, or
    facebook pages,\r\nor myspace pages, or wikipedia articles, or live-journal pages,
    or...\r\n\r\nand if you're gonna print out stuff from a news-site, you might as
    well\r\nhave bought the newspaper, and we all know how newspapers are doing.\r\n\r\nso
    the only way your sentence makes any sense is to turn it on its head:\r\nthe only
    reason people still use print is to proofread stuff for the screen.\r\n\r\nand
    given the apparent absence of proofreading out there in the world,\r\ni'd say
    there isn't even much of _that_ type of printing going on...\r\n\r\ncory said
    it years ago, and it only becomes more true as time passes by:\r\nmore and more
    we are reading less from paper, and more from the screen.\r\n\r\n\r\n>   people
    will need to print from the screen to read it, or buy books\r\n\r\nwell, there
    you go!  bookstores!  tomorrow's growth industry!  for sure!\r\n\r\n-bowerbird\r\n"
