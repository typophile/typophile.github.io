body: "Hello,\r\n\r\nI have posted before regarding needing help with writing syntax
  for \u201Cmark\u201D and mark to mark\u201D features for a syriac language but I
  am still having problems. I work on a mac 10.5.9.\r\n\r\nI have found how to write
  the correct syntax (from help here and also reading the long OpenType Feature File
  Specification article from Adobe\u2019s website) and I believe I have the syntax
  correct but not sure where the problem is. I am processing the feature file by accessing
  it through the full version of Fontographer 5.  I have broken the steps down to
  just testing one \u201Cmark\u201D feature and am testing in a Latin font first.
  I am more a designer than technical person but I am determined and do want to learn
  and understand how this process works.\r\n\r\nBelow is my syntax \u2013 I have used
  Unicode numbers instead of the names (uni005E=asciiciricum and uni0061=a)\r\n\r\nfeature
  mark {\r\n  markClass uni005E <anchor 181 0> @TOP_MARKS;\r\n  position base uni0061
  <anchor 240 531> mark @TOP_MARKS;\r\n  } mark;\r\n\r\nI also added the mark feature
  to the aalt feature as well:\r\nfeature aalt {\r\n  feature mark;\r\n  } aalt;\r\n\r\nAfter
  I have accessed the feature file (in FOG5) when I go to generate the font I get
  the message \u201COpenType font cannot be generated due to error in feature-definition
  file.\u201D\r\n\r\nObviously something is missing. Can anyone give me some (more)
  insight please?\r\n\r\nThank you all so much,\r\n\r\nFrances\r\n"

  body: "Frances, \r\n\r\nwhat if you generate an OpenType .otf font with no features,
    and then run the commandline makeotf tool from the AFDKO package, pointing to
    the feature file? That might give you more meaningful error messages. \r\n\r\nBest,\r\nAdam\r\n"

    generates the mark feature from the anchor positions in the glyph window. It supports
    basic RTL shaping and mark preview.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/marks_preview_3422.png]\r\n\r\nIf
    you have any question feel free to ask me directly.\r\n\r\nBest,\r\nGeorg\r\n"

  body: "I have been trying to install AFDKO v2.5 (command-line and macros) on my
    mac 10.5.9. I have read the instructions in the \u201CReadMe\u201D and got the
    command-line to install and work correctly. \r\n\r\nInstalling the macros file
    is giving me problems. When I try and install the macros I have gotten the \u201C(...)
    IOError: [Errno 13] Permission denied: (...)\" message which the ReadMe file explains:
    \u201Cit's because the AFDKO FontLab macros were previously installed, and are
    write-protected. To install them again you will need to first remove the old files.\u201D
    I can\u2019t find any other AFDKO FontLab macros (are they meaning FDK v1.6?)
    and I have searched for the FDK v1.6 by looking for \u201C.cshrc\" file and couldn\u2019t
    find that either. Now I do have both FL4.6 and FLS5 (5.0.4) and FOG5 loaded on
    the same computer \u2013 could that be the problem? \r\n\r\nAlso in the instructions
    (prior to installing the macros) it says to download the AFDKO archive file and
    decompress it which I had just done prior to installing command-line. Do I do
    this download and decompress again (which seems silly to me) or just use the files
    from the existing AFDKO file?\r\n\r\nThanks again,\r\n\r\n--Frances\r\n"
