    Santos does have a <a href=http://vanarchiv.com/fonts_in_use_flint.html>\"fonts
    in use\"</a> section on his site. The bottom examples use Lisboa.\r\n\r\nAs an
    aside, I'm very excited for the (hopefully impending) release of Lisboa Slab and
    Swash."

  body: <a href="http://www.socialtext.com/">Socialtext</a> used to use Lisboa for
    all their stuff, now it's limited to their logo. The new typeface is a downgrade,
    I think.
