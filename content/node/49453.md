body: "Is it possible to remove kerning pairs from a font with Robofab based on a
  condition.\r\n\r\nI want to remove all the kerning apart from those that are applied
  to the smallcaps.\r\n\r\nI was thinking something like :\r\n<code>\r\nfrom robofab.world
  import CurrentFont\r\nf = CurrentFont()\r\nkerning = f.kerning\r\n\r\nif(kerning
  != .small)\r\nremove\r\n\r\n</code>\r\n\r\nI don't know how to write conditional
  statements for Robofab so I know this syntax is completely wrong"

    target=\"_blank\">http://robofab.com/objects/kerning.html</a>:\r\n<code>\r\nfrom
    robofab.world import CurrentFont\r\nf = CurrentFont()\r\n# create a list of smallcap
    glyphnames which you\r\n# identify by the \".small\" suffix:\r\nsmallcaps = [g.name
    for g in f if \".small\" in g.name]\r\n# eliminate kerning involving a smallcap:\r\nf.kerning.eliminate(
    leftGlyphsToEliminate=smallcaps, \\\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;rightGlyphsToEliminate=smallcaps

  body: "I guess you could also do a copy of your font, delete all kerning in this
    font. Then copy the small caps key-glyphs from the old font and hit \"paste special\"
    only on the small caps of the new font.\r\n"

  body: "Yeah, why make things harder than they are :)\r\n\r\nThe Paste Special command
    is one of my favourites, it allows you to do so many things, such as paste only
    kerning, or only one sidebearing etc. Great tool!"
