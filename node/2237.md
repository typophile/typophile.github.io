  body: The face is actually called Too Much from the Visual Graphics library. I have
    a couple of specimen books that contain showings at home, but not here at the
    office. I&#39;ll see if I can get a scan posted later today. By the way, <a href="http://www.imageclub.com/">Image
    Club</a> digitized three variations of Too Much in 1989, but they didn&#39;t make
    the cut when we migrated the library over as part of Adobe in 1994. If you can
    find an old Image Club LetterPress CD kicking around somewhere, you&#39;ll find
    it on that disc.

  body: Grant... I would never scoff, not at you anyway. I seem to remember having
    one of those. Are you offering? <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"
    ALT=":-&#41;" BORDER=0> So it&#39;s birthdate is 1989, or is that only it&#39;s
    digital birth? Don&#39;t you think it looks like Milton Glaser&#39;s work? I&#39;m
    going to find a sample of babyfat. I&#39;m going to dig through my U/lc and see
    if I can&#39;t find one. I&#39;m probably entirely wrong. But at least you were
    summoned with the correct answer. <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"
