  I can tell is that it's san serif, possible condensed. The \"R\" have straight tail,
  the \"G\" has spur, and the bottom arm of \"F\" is a bit shorter than the top arm.\r\n\r\nThe
  fonts that are close enough are Gnuolane, Arial Narrow, and Avenir Next Condensed.
  \r\n\r\nPlease let me know what is this font is. Thanks! "
