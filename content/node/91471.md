  tried to understand it but could not figure out it as the images included in the
  discussion were deleted. I would appreciate if anybody could help me to solve the
  situation for the following three styles of a font with images, how should I name
  the \r\n\r\nRegular\r\nBold\r\nLight\r\n\r\nstyles of a font in Fontlab 5.\r\n\r\nThanks"

  body: "The problem with font naming is this:\r\n\r\n1. You want three weights --
    Light, Regular, Bold.\r\n2. You want these under the same <em>family name</em>
    in applications that supports this (e.g., such as InDesign does).\r\n3. You also
    want the Bold attribute to make either \"Light' into \"Regular\", or \"Regular\"
    into \"Bold\". <strong>Note: you can only choose one of these.</strong>\r\n\r\nCristobal's
    bottom image shows the 'defaults' for naming your font for software that only
    support 'regular' and 'bold' styles (and 'italic' and 'bold italic' as well).
    At the top you enter the name that should appear as general \"Font name\"; at
    the bottom, the style name. With the checkboxes at the right you can indicate
    the sub-type, so you can <em>name</em> your font 'Semibold' but have it <em>act</em>
    as if it were \"Bold\" for your regular style.\r\n\r\nWith this naming scheme
    you can only make a 'family' of two weights, Regular and Bold. It doesn't matter
    if the <em>style name</em> is \"Light\" for one and \"Regular\" for the other,
    or \"Condensed Bold\" for one and \"Condensed Black\" for the other -- all you
    do here is indicate which one is 'regular' and which one is the corresponding
    'bold'.\r\n\r\nBut if you can only define two weights, where do you tell you also
    have a third one? Suppose you are using this screen to define your \"Regular\"
    and \"Bold\". You cannot use <strong>the same family name</strong> for \"Light\"
    because you cannot indicate 'this is neither the Regular nor the Bold version'.
    You <em>have</em> to change the family name for your Light to something else --
    you cannot re-use just \"YourFont\", with a <em>style</em> \"Light\". You <strong>must</strong>
    use something like \"YourFont Light\", and then set the style to \"Regular\".\r\n\r\nFortunately,
    you can fill in the correct family and style names in the <em>other</em> screen
    Cristobal shows, the one at the top. Here you should enter \"YourFont\" as a family
    name for all three styles, and \"Light\", \"Regular\", and \"Bold\" for each of
    your styles. \r\n\r\nIn software such as Word you will find \"YourFont Light\",
    without a Bold, and \"YourFont\", with both \"Regular\" and \"Bold\". In other,
    less brain-damaged software, you will see one \"YourFont\", with all three style
    options. In both cases, only when in Regular, pressing the hot key for 'bold'
    will give you your \"Bold\" font.\r\n\r\n(Disclaimer: typed all of the above off
    the top of my head!)"
