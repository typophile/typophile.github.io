The font must be supplied on non-returnable standard media (CD preferred) and must be a bold weight. No "grunge" fonts will be accepted.

Hey, I still think it's up to everyone personally to decide whether or not they feel the movie is an important work of art or not.

Personally, I think this movie is a <em>very</em> important work of art in a larger socio-political context, another step forward in the acceptance of homosexuality by the audience at large in the otherwise frighteningly reactionary US of A. Don't you diss Ang Lee, dude. ;^)</div>

It might speak to his knowledge of cowboy culture. That's my take anyway. There's nothing sacred anymore. And you guys wonder why people pirate fonts. Just another part of the breakdown of society and its morals.</div>

i think the problem in a lot of cases with piracy is <em>ignorance</em> and not a break-down of moral values. but that's just my own take on it. Being a native Arizonan who grew up on a ranch, I think i know what cowboy culture is and I thought that for good and evil, the movie in question portrayed it pretty close to the truth. did you even see this film?</div>

No I resented that they didn't come out and say what it was. If they had been open about it, I would cut more slack, but they were trying to trick people into seeing it, so let'er rip.

There are certain things I have no interest in seeing. I'm sure someone could make a touching and artistic film about incest, or even bestiality (hey, it's natural; Sam the Beagle does it every time I come over)

>Hardly a day goes by that we aren’t called to complicitly accept things far more ludicrous here in CA.

My rating was based on my perception of the hoax and the general level of gullibility I perceive in the US population. It's a generalization but my guess is that CA is no more gullible than the rest of the country. Who did they vote for again? 

This hoax in general may be more believable outside the US, where customization of license plates is common, and often the subject of crack-downs (recent <A HREF="http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/articleshow/1062734.cms">news reports from India</A>). Also outside the US people may believe that what their governments perceive as a problem may be seen as a money making opportunity by local governments in the US.

An here I was thinking this might be a tough crowd. I know I got one person to check the DMV site.
: )

I'd like to mention that I'm not 'homophobic'- I hang with gays almost every day. To generalize I find them to be good conversationalists, and there are some I would trust to have my back. I am not the kind of person that would point fingers and have you believe I'm not screwed up myself (Surprise!). Although getting far from the topic of fonts, I'll mention that my role model was always being accused of hanging out with people who did meet the standards of the finger pointers.

> So, Asian filmmakers making gay cowboy movies = people stealing fonts? 
> I don’t get it.

I won't hold that against you.

> You probably didn’t like Spaghetti Westerns either ;-)

You just reminded me that an Ennio Morricone CD would fit nicely in my collection. I have to admit to curiousity about what Clint would think of Broke back, because I care what Clint thinks, I think. Then again, now that I think about the way Hollyweird is going, he will probably direct the sequel.

		<div class="commentbody">It is pertinent and ironic that Akira Kurosawa helped to spawn the Spaghetti Western period with a few of his classics. Notably, A Fistful of Dollars was Yojimbo (which was based on a Dashiell Hammett book, and related to previous "westerns") remade in Italy, and The Seven Samurai was remade as The Magnificent Seven.

Even the original Star Wars trilogy, considered such a western staple, is heavily based on Kurosawa's work. Point is, it's all very blurry.</div>

Reminds me of what Bill Maher said at the end of his show last week...

"So, don't get me wrong. I love idiots. I just don't think they should be in charge. And I'll tell you why. Because the majority of Americans are not idiots. Assholes, yes. But, idiots, no."

		<div class="commentbody">Fine English speaking American Hollywood directors have been making westerns for ever.  How many have been either works of art or factual depictions (check out how the american Indian has been portrayed) of cowboy life? Of course other fine English speaking American Hollywood directors have made films about Africa and Asia without being close to accurate or being works of art (see any of the old Tarzan or Jungle Jim films).  
Regarding Ang Lee--the man made a film. He didn't force anyone to call it a work of art. See it or don't see it, it's up to you. 
I hope that there is still enough freedom left in this troubled country to allow people to make a film of their choice without having to pass a language test.

Uhhhh, who tried to trick who into seeing Brokeback Mountain? I mean come on you'd have to live in a cave not to know what it was about. They didn't try to conceal the subject matter from the public the least bit.

Also fyi it's not Ang Lee's first western, he made Ride with the Devil years ago. He also made Sense & Sensibility, beautifully I might add. You on his case about that too cuz he didn't grow up in 19th century England? How about the american dude who made Memoirs of a Geisha, based on a book by another american dude. Starring, strangely, chinese actresses.

And I still don't see what any of this has to do with pirated fonts.

If we're going to talk about America's gullibility let's talk about something important like how the Bush admin took us to war in Iraq based on lies and false insinuations and much of America, including a lot of democrats, bought it hook line and sinker.

Bob Baker has trained many locals from the Echo Park neighborhood to be puppeteers. He's been there since 1961 and it isn't going to last forever. I have friends who have childhood memories of birthday parties there. It makes me feel like I'm 6 - so wonderful to find some naivete and wonderment so close to home.

I don't how many tangents we're allowed per thread, but it sounds like you might have live around these parts long enough to remember the Helm's Bakery Trucks? Someone mentioned designing something for a Bakery truck and I had some deep waves of nostalgia remembering the sound of the whistle and the smell when they pulled open those drawers. We didn't know how good we had it back then. Simple times. Sandy Koufax, Maurey Wills, Vin Sculley and the rest...

On another note:

Most of the "important" things you may be referring to, I have given up hope on. I have done the math. Man minus a base point for morality equals a big friggin' mess. As I see it our only hope is for an omniscient, all-powerful benevolent dictator to check in.</div>
