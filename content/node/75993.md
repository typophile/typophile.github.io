  2 weights) and i like its quirks, was just wondering what everyone else thinks really...i
  don't see it used around that much so was just thinking maybe its just me....\r\nis
  there any knowledgeable typophiles out there who have any views on it?\r\n\r\nthis
  is what wikipedia says:\r\nNeuzeit S is a sans-serif typeface designed by C.W. Pischiner
  in 1928 for the Stempel type foundry. The German name translates to English as \"new
  time.\" The face combines characteristics of both geometric and realist (neo-grotesque)
  sans-serif classifications. In 1959 additional weights were added by the Linotype
  foundry's version. A related but different face, DIN Neuzeit, is rounder and more
  purely a geometric sans-serif.\r\nNeuzeit S is distinct for its contrast of wide
  circular characters o, O, p, q, and Q with the more compact characters h, n, u,
  and t.\r\n\r\nview/buy it here:\r\nhttp://new.myfonts.com/fonts/agfa/neuzeit-s/\r\n\r\n"

  body: Absolutely one of my favorite sans serifs.  It occupies this wonderful area
    between a neo-grotesk and a geometric 'face, and I'm always a sucker for round
    tittles.  It has just enough personality to distinguish itself, and can be a really
    nice touch when you're wary of using Akzidenz, Helvetica or Futura.  It's got
    quite a nice set of numerals, to boot.
