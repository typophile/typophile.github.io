OK, it has a name just because I need to call the file something. I think it could do with a better one.
So, here's my attempt at a kinda-sorta semiserif font.
All the cahracters I have so far are inthe PDF. Trying to do it all with off-brand software is taking some getting used to, but it's all I can afford right now.


-EDIT- OK, there's a revised PDF also attached, but the original is still there for comparison.

-EDIT- Upon further reflection, this is hardly a semi-serif at all anymore. I might generate a sans version eventually, then I'll have something to work between.</div>

Interesting. The serifs and shape of some of the bowls have a very Art Deco / Jugendstil feeling. Personally, I am trying to link design elements like serifs, contrast, stress etc. with how letters where drawn with pen or brush etc. With that perspective, some of the letters feel a bit off (v/w: bottom serifs, o/g: contrast, s: no serif etc.). 

Note that this is just one way of looking at it, which is probably a bit too restrictive. But in general, I think letters of a font should form a cohesive set linked by a common design language. 

What about for instance use the same contrast / stress for all the letters?

So here I've swapped out for the alternate "g" and clipped the lower serifs from the lc "v" and "w", and placed a ball terminal on the "y".

Also I did up some of the ligatures that weren't there before and expanded the numbers. They felt too narrow before, but some still don't work for me. The "2" is much improved, but I don't know about the rest...


not sure what I did here... can't upload a PDF to a reply comment, I guess. I'll try editing the first one.</div>

I like this g and v better. Why did you put inktraps in the v, w etc? 

The numerals seem a bit flat, besides the 1, they lack serifs and /or other common design elements. 

The fi ligature is funny. It is sort of a non-ligature as the dot of the i is still interfering with the arc of the f!

		<div class="commentbody">Aww, and I had to make the "i" on "ﬁ" so short to make the dot fit like that. I prefer to think of it engaging the arc of the "f" in a deep sensuous kiss than interfering with it.

The inktraps felt like a good idea at the time. With or without serifs, the angle joint of the "v" and "w", etc., get too thick for my eyes. This might not be the best solution as I've implemented. I'm open to suggestions for a better one.

I had hoped the nearly consistent line weight would be enough to provide "binding unity" as you put it. The crossbars and the long, inconsistently applied serifs do throw that off a bit. I'm not convinced serifs would work on the "s" at all, and I'm debating whether to remove the one from the "c".

But, y'know, it's all an experiment until it goes to market, if it ever does. I wanted to do a monoweight font with long serifs and this is how it's coming out.

I made some pretty significant revisions in this version, most notably in totally redesigning most of the numerals and the "g" again. Tell me if you can spot the rest of the changes. Vector PDF up at the top again. I know the space glyphs got too wide somehow this time around. That, I will fix.</div>

Here it is again (and in PDF #5 up top) this time with the serif'd "S"s, an new "G" and "Q", more universally applied ink traps and some other miscellaneous changes. I have a bigger view here of the numerals. I'm trying to keep them monospaced, which could explain why they're still a little wonky, but much better than what I started with.

I'm still taking suggestions on the name, and anything else that might improve this.</div>

I don't think whining helps. Sometimes it takes a while before you get a reaction. Also note that a lot of the experts in this forum make a living as designer and they just have to balance their time. 

Anyway, I am not an expert but followed your updates lately. Here some observations.

-Still not sure about the razor blade ink traps. They seem distracting and if they are an integral part of the design, you may want to consider widening whilst shortening them so they are visible. Right now I feel they are off-scale. Also, why are they not in the Y, K, 7, 9 etc. as well?

-Crossbar of F and H is a bit low

-nr 1 a bit too narrow

-upper part of bowls c, d and e a bit too wide (seem top heavy)

-where arc of h becomes right vertical stem: kink

-Spine of S is bulging up at lower right


I hope you find this usefull.

Sebastian

As it has progressed, especially through this most recent iteration, I see it more as a potential replacement for or text-sized complement to the likes of Copperplate, for those times when you're feeling locked into using Copperplate, but would really like to try something different.

Here's the latest update: version 15, thanks to a bunch of software crashes corrupting the intervening iterations.
I think it's greatly improved. A bunch of letters have been added or corrected to bring the character set up to Adobe Latin 2 plus some ornamental extras.

The ascenders have all been stretched a bit and the upper LC serifs have been unified with a clipped wedge shape with a bracketed underside. Circle based letters have been made more, but not perfectly, circular, with the overshoots brought down a notch. Many of the letters that had a butt stroke end now have a tapered terminal, giving the impression of bent railroad spikes. The eszet and Sterling are totally new. A very tiny bit of contrast has been added overall, just -5 ems vertical and +5 ems horizontal, maybe getting just a little thicker on some of the curves. The numbers have been given a bit of extra spacing and other improvements, but are still tabular.

The image sample above is just a Q&D from the same template I used for the earlier ones. A more complete PDF sample is coming soon.</div>

I have the stubby base serifs clipped off the v and w. To do the same to the corresponding caps would be a bit much. Would big ink traps do the job? Also, I am trying angled serifs on the Z.

For the l perhaps pull it down just a bit.  It feels a little too floaty.

I don't think you need to worry too much about the capitals.  The lc z with the diagonal and the uc without it looks good.  Especially for letters like cC mM nN sS vV wW xX and zZ the more distinction that can be made the better, since the x-height is so close to the cap height.  Would would a C with a straight serif look like?

Also your super3 is a noticeable bit larger than the super1 and super2.  This is really starting to mature.

The tapered hook base of the lc L already descends slightly. I'm afraid pulling it more will start looking like a weird elongated backwards j. I could go back to a flat serif base like on the i, but that would mean redoing all that spacing and kerning, which needs to be redone anyway.

		<div class="commentbody">Hi Jason :) Here are my observations, please feel free not to pay too much attention to them as I'm only a beginner too.
This is an unusual design and I'm not sure I understand it. To my eye, there isn't enough unity between the different letters. I'm not sure there is a consistent pattern to the stress, the serifs, and the amount of 'weirdness'. I think some of the weirder ideas are wonderful! Look at your curly r and k and alternative C, they're great.
Some of the bits I don't understand...
n has foot serifs only on the outside. H has all serifs. u has a normal serif pattern. m is somewhere in between. 
The curves in geoqs are quite relaxed and soft, and wide. abdp are quite sharp and strong shapes. m and w are narrow.
The ovwx seem to be monoline, but the stress is very pronounced in egrs.
I quite like the oddness of all these things, so I wouldn't try to make everything conventional, but the overall feeling is a bit complicated and disorienting.
I think the lc diacritics could have a lot more space below. I don't find vwxy work very well. g and p could do with more space on the right. I think h and n look too wide because the inner serifs are missing and there's a lot of counterspace. The quotes and comma don't fit.
Yes, I think the t and f should have the same crossbar, or at least the same general shape. 
Keep going with this, it's very curious!</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I thought I'd pounded most of the quirks out of it by now.

At the beginning, there was no stress or contrast in Palormak, it was a relatively simple mostly monoline semi-serif. That origin is probably where the remaining quirks reside. Any hint of stress or contrast was added later as I learned things from other projects. The serifs took a new shape and the tapered terminals were introduced on many letters. The tapered terminals give the appearance of ductus but for different reasons than the usual causes. It all makes sense to my eyes and way of thinking about it, except where I'm still struggling, where it doesn't.
The serifs of "vwxy" are notably troublesome.

As I made various changes through the process, I recognized a kind of "rail spike" motif. It doesn't literally apply to every letter form, but the spike shaped directional arrows I included reinforce it in a way, if at least as a reminder.

Significant changes are underway, but you'll recognize it.</div>

There are a lot of changes between this and 17, many of which were already discussed, and I didn't document them well otherwise. Taking notes is something I never developed a knack for.

		<div class="commentbody">On a technical side, this font rides... how does one put it... low in the em? It looks really short for whatever point size it's set at, which isn't readily apparent in the samples since I didn't note the sizes.

If I reduce the size of the em square will that fix this problem? If I do that, would I then have to rescale the em square back to 1000 and risk distortions due to rounding or is an arbitrary em square OK? Is there a different setting that would correct the problem?</div>

		<div class="commentbody">You type face is pretty interesting. I'd make some comments on the design. I find the bar on some letters too big (compare the E with the ŁÐ), the punctuation seems too big also. The oblique bar of the Ø could be longer. I like what you've done with the l but I wonder if this kind of  terminal suited well on the q. To my eyes this q seems to be an a with a long tail. The “curve” in the r r should be less large at the junction with his stem. The connection of the a with the e in the æ could be lower may be at the same height of the bar of the e. The ampersand is nice, but it would have more punch if you increase the lower bowl and reduce the upper one. Hoping that will be helpful.  Keep going.</div>

But isn't that what a "q" is supposed to look like? Notwithstanding that it doesn't look at all like the "a" in this font. Better this than just a reversed "p", which is why I made the "q" without the serif at first.

The punctuation is a bit bold, but I did that on purpose to prevent it washing out at text sizes.


The "r" has been exceedingly tricky to get while maintaining the rail spike paradigm that has evolved. I'll keep changing it til I get it right.</div>

- You need to get right all those overshoots. That /4/ is flying next to /3/ and /5/. /3/ looks short next to /2/.
- Also, make the thins consistent. /8/ is almost monowidth.
- The crossbar of /4/ is may be too low.

Regarding the oldstyle figures:
- I don't know if that /4/ works. Take the lining /4/ as a reference.
- Nice /8/ and /3/!
- /1/ may work, but right now <em>all</em> serifs are too short.
