body: When a typeface comes in regular, medium, and bold weights, what is the typical
  use of the medium weight? Is it for text or headings? To give a concrete example,
  Dante comes in these three weights, and I am unsure how to use the medium weight.

    it's usually for setting smaller sizes (although you might have\r\nto track it
    looser). But I might also try to use a Demi for emphasis\r\ninstead of Italic,
    depending.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
