  wondered if anyone could advise on the best way to construct a gd ligature with
  Adobe Caslon. \r\n\r\nDoes anyone know of this being done before, regardless of
  the typeface?\r\n\r\nThanks, \r\n\r\nGraham"

  body: Maybe you could merge the top bowl of the g and the bowl of the d. You'd have
    to figure out how to elegantly reconcile their sizes, positions, and stresses,
    though.
