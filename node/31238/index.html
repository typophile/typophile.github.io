There must be some special way to indicate it in pronounciation keys. It isn't a natural American English sound, so I wouldn't expect to find it in American dictionaries, but what about Spanish dictionaries?</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I finally found this again -- I was fascinated to find that some Latin American type designers have taken it upon themselves to create ch, rr, and ll ligatures to reflect the fact that these are considered separate letters in Spanish (although, to my understanding, ch is now two letters according to the RAE). Cristian Gonzalez's Origen uses all of these, plus a ck ligature (image from a "seleccion_typecon" PDF I have on my computer, maybe from the Letras Latinas website). I'd find it difficult to read the rr ligature in text, but maybe this is a mildly common thing in Spanish writing to do. Just thought this was a cool thing to bring up -- I don't have much to say about phonetics.

Thanks for the correction. It's been a long while since my Spanish classes. Those were the days. I simplified my name to Raja and got called everything but that: "Raha, Haja" and sadly even, "Haha"

auricfuzz,
Thanks for the posting that image, I was thinking that a stacked "rr" would be the best way to represent it.


biddy,
I like prefer and like to go by "Raja" but some people feel that they can go ahead and call me "Raj" — which I can't stand — when I've already done them enough of a favor.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I came across this thread from Eben's link on another thread.  The LL ligature is something I've seen a little more often, but haven't really seen anything standard for the ll.  Ch and ch seems to be getting a little more usage in Spanish typography.  The rr ligature I've never seen before, and certainly isn't used in handwriting (but then again, neither is the Ch or ll).  

The symbol commonly used in American dictionaries for a alveolar trill is either r-acute or r-macron, depending on style.  In IPA, an alveolar trill is a standard r, whilst an alveolar flap is an r without a full termination on the loop.

Also, rojo is pronounced with a full alveolar trill.  All <em>r</em>'s at the beginning or end of a word, or following certain phonemes are realised as trills.  Incidentally, with the exception of Indian or Scottish English, an phonetic transcription of English would never have either types of r (words like, well, <em>word</em> actually have a an alveolar or retroflex approximates, which are represented by an r-turned or an r-turned-hooked.  

And cuttlefish, in some dialects of Spanish (Rioplatense) it can be realised as a uvular trill (just as in some Caribbean or Mexican dialects it can be realised as in English).  But the so-called "standard Spanish" it's an alveolar trill.
