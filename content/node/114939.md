  It must feel friendly, warm and simple. And maybe more important it has to be very
  legible and work in small sizes.\r\n\r\nI've found Tomboy from Letterperfect http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/letterperfect/tomboy/
  that I find pretty suitable. However, I think it's a bit too masculine and harsh.
  I guess it's because it's a signage/marker typeface rather than a script. \r\n\r\nAny
  ideas on similar but with a  friendlier appearance?\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\n"
