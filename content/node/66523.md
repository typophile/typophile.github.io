  here :(\r\n\r\nI've wanted to quote a image someone posted without just having to
  repost the image. Right now there is no way to quote a post and have it link back
  to the original post, unless it was the 1st message. I could browse the sourcecode
  and do it, but that is too clunky I think.\r\n\r\nMaybe this could be added in the
  next upgrade of the forums."

    on here\r\n\r\nI tend to highlight the text I want to quote, and then copy. Paste
    into the comment box.\r\n\r\nOh, you wanted something simpler?\r\n\r\nI prefer
    this system, as the easier ways result in over-quoting. People will tend to just
    quote the bits that are relevant. Worst case systems automatically quote everything,
    and after five or six messages you wind up with 100s of line of quotes message,
    and then get down to a one line answer."

  body: "I like to enclose quoted passages within cite tags\r\n\r\n<cite>which results
    in text like this</cite>\r\n\r\nbut isn't precisely clear as to its purpose, nor
    does it refer to the original poster. It's as good as we have right now.\r\n\r\nThere
    are pros and cons to a more automated, feature rich quotation system as already
    noted. I'm hesitant to go around requesting new features after the madness of
    the last upgrade (which has thankfully died down). I am partial to the way Fark.com
    handles the situation, though it requires vigilance on the part of the writer
    to keep it from getting muddled."
