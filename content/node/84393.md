  body: "I assume you're exaggerating wildly, but if a client requests an excessive
    number of concepts it can indicate that 1) they aren't used to dealing with a
    professional designer, and 2) they don't trust your judgement. \r\n\r\nMake sure
    that they understand that your charges are based on your time. In your estimate
    you could say that you'll provide 5 (or whatever) concepts for $X, and each additional
    concept will cost an additional $X.\r\n\r\nIf they literally asked for thousands,
    I'd wish them luck and say goodbye."

  body: "How much is a good idea worth? $500? Are they willing to spend 25 million
    dollars? If they are, then design away.\r\n\r\nJoking aside, it's possible they
    want a campaign consisting of numerous ads, each with its own unique look. They
    still need a unifying idea, or they're spending a lot of money without building
    their brand. And if each ad has its own unique look, they will spend a lot of
    money, depend on it.\r\n\r\nIf, on the other hand, they plan to look at 50,000
    ideas and decide that 49,999 of them suck and they'll pay for the one they like,
    then run, don't walk, to the nearest exit. "

  body: "This is an issue I've addressed with the Sense and Sensibility super family,
    which comprises \"Modern\" and \"Oldstyle\" sans styles with identical weights
    and vertical metrics, and almost identical copy fitting. Therefore, the tone of
    a layout may be changed by switching from one to the other without altering the
    layout\u2014enabling a clear comparison of which option best suits the brand parameters.\r\n\r\nThis
    kind of design process may be pursued with any superfamily.\r\n\r\nIt can also
    be applied with types that have variants of \"a\" and \"g\".\r\n\r\nAdmittedly,
    this is not painting in broad strokes, but it can be quite useful in determining
    whether a particular typographic execution meets strategy; it's surprisingly clear
    when one compares two layouts with such a difference, which one better embodies
    typical keywords like \"friendly\" or \"authoritative\".\r\n\r\nHowever, although
    I priced the complete S&S package very attractively, most sales have been of either
    the Sense or the Sensibility sub family, so I must conclude that this design strategy
    is not the way that designers generally work \u2014 unless they are able to do
    it with quite different types, e.g. Futura and Helvetica, or even serif vs. sans."

  body: Shouldn't be that big of a deal. Just contract out to 50,000 contractors.
    Maybe ask them to devote 2 hours each to some ideas. A $100 or so per hour, that's
    $200 * 50,000. That's only 10 million. Certainly a budget concern, but hey, if
    they're willing to pay...
