  body: NEVER MIND is <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/urw/grotesque-no-9/?PREFS_SET%5BRenderSize%5D=36&amp;PREFS_SET%5BRenderString%5D=NEVER+MIND"
    target="_blank">Grotesque 9</a> or similar. <BR> <BR>THE BOLLOCKS is close to
    <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/new-century-schoolbook/?PREFS_SET%5BRenderSize%5D=36&amp;PREFS_SET%5BRenderString%5D=THE+BOLLOCKS"
    target="_blank">Century Schoolbook Bold</a>, but narrower. <BR> <BR>All of the
    type here looks like wood type, maybe clipped from posters. There were wood type
    versions of many common faces &#40;like Century Schoolbook&#41; which looked noticeably
    different that what they were supposed to be.

  body: Oh, and HERE&#39;S THE is probably <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/agfa/placard-mt/?PREFS_SET%5BRenderSize%5D=36&amp;PREFS_SET%5BRenderString%5D=HERE%27S+THE"
    target="_blank">Placard Bold Condensed</a>. If you go to the character map on
    MyFonts for that, you&#39;ll see that the apostrophe matches.
