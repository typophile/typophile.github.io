body: "Hello everyone,\r\n\r\nUpcoming days, I'll be working on the design of a dissertation.
  A friend of mine is becoming a real doctor. In these collection of scientific articles,
  which, all together, form the body of the dissertation, lots & lots of abbrevations
  are used, in various kinds. For example:\r\n\r\nprotein S, protein A, type III,
  PS antigen, VTE, ATE, acronyms like 'DESCARTES'.\r\n\r\nFor me, it's all mambojambo,
  but I wanted to be clear and straightforward and set all these abbrevations in (spaced)
  small caps.\r\nThat's quite a tough job of typographic handwork but I think it's
  necessary, or at least the best solution.\r\n\r\nAm I right with this?"

    in small caps."

    the beauty and usefulness of small caps. NOT to use small caps in the cases I
    listed in my first post, would be just a decision because of professional conventions,
    not aesthetics.\r\n\r\n>> <cite>The only one of your examples that really cries

    another point. My view on typography can be rather black&white. That is to say:
    if I set the S of \"protein S\" in regular capital, hence I do the same with the
    C in \"protein C\". Off course. But then, why would I use small caps in any case?
    Setting, for example, DESCARTES in small caps and leaving the roman numerals for
    what they are, isn't that just an unmotivated, arbitrary choice?\r\n\r\nShouldn't
    I better skip the whole concept of small caps, in order to be consistent and logical?

    the purpose they serve is not \"obeying a rule,\" or \"banishing ugliness.\"\r\n\r\nI'm
    afraid book interior design is really a trade, not an art. It can occasionally
    be a craft, but those who forget the use of a book interior; the requirement of
    service to author and reader, are not doing their job. "

    accepted standard style manual for conventions governing all the issues you are

  body: "> Why does everyone hate caps so much?\r\n\r\nThe problem with full cap acronyms
    is that they alter the visual color of the page. Like bold type, or lining numerals,
    they make little blobs of heavy ink usage on the page. These can impede reading
    ... the eye is drawn to the heavy area, breaking away from where it was, and then
    must fight its way back. \r\n\r\nThat is the real reason why typographers use
    small cap acronyms, old style figures, and italic instead of bold for emphasis,
    with the exception of books designed to make the eye jump to certain locations
    (dictionaries and key words in a textbook, as examples).\r\n\r\nSome people say
    they use them because they like the look of them, or that they are different.
    For me that isn't enough.\r\n\r\nA single letter in full caps is not a problem,
    except that of consistency. I always had problems with US when dealing in small
    caps, as it looks like the word us went set in SC. I always tried to get editor's

    aren't the only solution and not always the most appropriate. As I suggested,
    adding some extra air can also be effective. I think we can agree that even color
    is the common goal. \r\n\r\nI have no objection to small caps in general. Hell,
    I use them all the time myself. What I'm [over] reacting to is an unexamined notion

  body: "<cite>In phototype setting times (no small caps available) it was common
    to set full cap acronyms half a point smaller.</cite>\r\n\r\nInteresting observation.
    My experience (back to 1980 anyway) runs the other way, in phototype setting times,
    designer's dealing with extended text would choose a font that had small caps
    available. Sort of an extension of the thinking from hot metal; most type shops
    would have four or five or even six type families appropriate for setting extended
    text, and the designer would choose from those.\r\n\r\nI suppose advertising design
    and composition might have been different.\r\n\r\nWhich maybe points up the range
    of responses in this thread. Type designers tend to think in theoretical terms,
    where the only theory at play is typographic theory.\r\n\r\nType users split into
    at least two groups. One is broadly termed ephemeral printing, where the display
    type may be most important and chosen first. Usually the amount of text is so
    small that manipulation of characters or their setting is not a problem. Another
    group would be book typography, which has different expectations about a reader
    (including how many hours he/she has to spend with the text). I suppose today
    another would be the use of type on the web, and for all I know, that breaks into
    multiple uses as well.\r\n\r\nSounding my overused trumpet yet again, The purpose
    of almost all type is for communication, usually in the form of reading, not hanging
    on a museum wall. Once you agree on that point, how you view an audience becomes
    a key concept. And how the (graphic) designer treats that audience is equally
    key; rarely is it correct for the designer to further their agenda. To do so moves
    you back toward \"audience\" in an artistic context; a work hanging on a museum
    wall."
