    you may have to contact them to arrange for the changes you need.\r\n\r\n<well,
    check and see if [[ParaType]] has a cyrillic version, if not they're the best
    at doing customizations.\r\nIf they're not available, I'd have to recommend considering
    P22 to do a custom job for you. :^D>"

    of News Gothic on their site. (Linotype's Trade Gothic was based pretty closely
    on ATF's News Gothic.)\r\n\r\n(I would provide a direct link, but the site's use
    of frames makes it impossible.)"
