  I've missed it), but according to Mark Porter <a href=http://www.markporter.com/notebook/?p=65>Guardian
  Egyptian is now available for licensing</a>.\r\n\r\nNothing's changed on <a href=http://christianschwartz.com/>Christian
  Schwartz's</a> site (nor on <a href=http://moderntypography.com/>Paul Barnes'</a>),

  body: I think Porter jumped the gun a little bit because he saw an early edition
    licensed to the Dagbladet. The Guardian family will be available from <a href="http://www.commercialtype.com">Commercial
    Type</a> (Schwartz's and Barnes' foundry) sometime this year.
