body: I&#39;ve been looking for a Clarendon-style font that has text/oldstyle figures.
  The closest I&#39;ve been able to come is Caslon &#40;which has no ball terminals,
  is too elegant&#41;, a slab serif like Joanna &#40;not really close at all&#41;,
  and New Caledonia &#40;not &#42;too&#42; bad&#41; but I&#39;d like a real one. &#40;ps

    comes semi-close, except for how it&#39;s more of a mono-width font than a &#34;true&#34;
    egyptian like Clarendon. Aside from that, I think you&#39;re out of luck. Most
    of the Egyptian revivals appear to be based on woodcut types &#40;and so are digitized
    without too many extras&#41;, with the exception of Clarendon, and all of the
    versions / knockoffs of Clarendon I was able to find have lining figures. <BR>
    <BR>Maybe you could borrow old-style figures from a similarly weighted serif typeface
    like Cheltenham? <BR> <BR>&#40;<a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/storm/farao/">Farao</a>
    doesn&#39;t answer your question, as it has contemporary figures, but it sure
    is cute, so I thought I&#39;d throw it in anyway. I love Storm!&#41;

  body: Forrest, <BR> <BR>Thanks for the Farao tip--it has some interesting quirks.
    Unfortunately, I don&#39;t know of any Cheltenhams &#40;I have ITC and Bitstream&#41;
    that have OSF. Even New Century Schoolbook Fractions &#40;logically&#41; has no
    OSF. New Caledonia comes closest &#40;It has teardrop terminals instead of ball
    terminals and an arabic 1.&#41; I guess I&#39;ll just have to use Century in a
    historically appropriate manner. SIgh, . . .

  body: "So after ten years since the original post, I am wondering if there is a
    version of Clarendon (or a design similar to it) with Oldstyle figures now? I
    love Clarendon so much, but I simply can not do the lining numbers, it hurts in
    a paragraph. Please help and tell me there is a recent design I am missing on.\r\n\r\nThank
    you in advance!\r\n\r\n "
