  needs for printing flyers or small catalogs (<=A3) in small quantities (<100 pieces)?\r\nWould
  you suggest a laser or an inkjet printer?\r\n\r\n(If you feel that it will be bad
  to advertise particular brands or particular model numbers on the forum, it would
  be great if you could just send me an email with these informations)\r\n\r\nThanks
  in advance for any suggestions."

    -- at least above the entry-level models -- can also duplex automatically. And
    don''t buy: lease.'

    DocuColor</a> (not sure of the exact model) which performs pretty well and may
    suit your needs.

  body: "What they all said. Laser will be cheaper and faster than inkjet, although
    quality won't be as good for images. It will still be good enough for most purposes,
    unless the business is, say, photography.\r\n\r\nI'm very happy with my Xerox
    Phaser 7300 DN, for instance, though I recall hearing that Hoefler/Frere-Jones
    have had some problems with theirs.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\n\r\nT"

  body: "I would like mention a service that I've used before which saved me from
    buying the wrong printer, therefore saving me not only a lot of money but a huge
    amount of frustration and unhappiness. The service doesn't cost much and could
    save you a bundle too.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.printershowcase.com/testdrive.asp\r\n\r\nFirst,
    you should know that there is no requirement that you buy your printer from them;
    this is merely a service they offer. While they have very good pricing on the
    printers they sell, if you buy a large printer the shipping costs may eat up your
    savings quickly. Besides that, if you buy from your local dealer you'll have better
    service if you have problems.\r\n\r\nLook at the specs of all the printers they
    have in stock -- they have a good variety of name brands and models available
    and they have all the specs online. Narrow your choice down to three, then send
    them your test file(s) and instructions with payment ($29.95).\r\n\r\nYou may
    be surprised at what you get back -- I was. In my test, the printer which I expected
    would have the best quality (a popular internationally-known brand which I strongly
    favored) was the worst by a long shot.\r\n\r\nI ended up buying a printer brand
    I had never had any experience with because of those tests. If not for those tests,
    I would never have had an opportunity to compare the brands. It's really a useful
    service these folks are offering to the buying public.\r\n\r\nGeorge"

  body: "It depends on your budget. An inkjet printer may seem cheap to purchase -
    but start adding up all the ink cartridges and it becomes very expensive. Also,
    most 8.5 x 11 inkjets only pring 8 x 10 - or really 9.5, only way to fool them
    - buy legal paper and a good trimmer.\r\n\r\nLaser is also expensive - but prices
    have come down. I own an Okidata (and by the way, was much cheaper to own it outright
    than lease it. Also, maintenance is easy, and if I have a problem, I can call
    \"AMERICANS\" who talk me through the problem - and it works!) My problem with
    Okidata is it is not as intelligent as a Hewlett Packard - it complains if the
    wrong size paper is in a tray, belly aches when it says it needs a new drum (Okidata
    needs 4 drums and 4 toner cartridges - but it does give a lot of impressions and
    almost perfect color matching to our printer's final products.) \r\n\r\nOur fun
    laser printer is a HP. 8.5x11. Does a nice job - pretty pictures. However, it
    has no drums (yahooo) but it does have 4 cartridges, each one is about 100 bucks.
    I did a small 8.5 x 11 job for a friend, and spent $1,000 on cartridges. \r\n\r\nFor
    what the manufacturers charge for cartridges they really could be more like Gilette
    of the 1950s, and give the machine away for free.\r\n\r\nBTW - my first color
    printer 11x17 was a Hewlett Packard. It was used, I got it on Ebay. It was a workhorse.
    When I decided it was time for a clean, color printer - I sold it on Ebay to a
    guy in Texas. He loved it. It was in great shape, and it's still going strong.\r\n\r\nIf
    you know how to take care of your equipment it can last a very long time. \r\n\r\nSo
    all you have to figure out is what your budget is to buy, and... how much toner
    and drums cost. You may also want to consider accessories -- though so many companies
    now make the duplexer right into the machine these days. \r\n\r\nI wish I had
    the money and space for a large machine that could staple and collate -- hey we
    all have dreams.\r\n\r\nGood luck - and please, share your decision with us. We'd
    love to hear about it."
