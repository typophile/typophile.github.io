    that sounds like a cool EULA clause: \"You many not contact Hermetic Fonts, LLC
    with questions or comments concerning the software product by any means, electronic
    or physical. Furthermore, contacting Hermetic Fonts, LLC to request an exception
    to this clause is a violation of the EULA punishable to the full extent of the
    law.\"\r\n\r\nNo, seriously: thank you Yanone, and Dave for convincing him.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
