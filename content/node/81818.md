  and the company that designed it has gone under. There are no records as to which
  font is used.\r\nPlease see the logo and the font in question in the [[http://leadwithit.com/|top
  left corner]]. Key characteristics are the pointed serifs, or tips, and the slanted
  e.\r\nAny help would be greatly appreciated.\r\n\r\n"
