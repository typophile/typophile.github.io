body: "Hello all dear and great typographers.\r\n\r\nI have designed some new Latin
  typefaces and converted them into OTF format using FontLab and installed them in
  the \\Windows\\Fonts folder as usual. I am using a Windows XP SP3 and Adobe Photoshop
  CS and CS2 products. When I tried to use and select my fonts to be used with Photoshop
  CS/CS2, I had many error messages informing me that there are errors in the program,
  the RAM is not enough, the text engine cannot be initialized, and other weird messages.
  (I will attach some photos of the Photoshop messages).\r\n\r\nI noticed also that
  the icon located beside me new OTF fonts in the list of fonts shown by Photoshop
  CS2 is for TTF fonts not for OTF fonts that I have designed and copied to the Fonts
  folder.\r\n\r\nThe original designed typefaces are in TTF and I used the FontLab
  to convert them into OTF format. I do not have this problem at all when I copy the
  original TTF fonts to the Fonts folder. Also, When I use Photoshop CS4, I also do
  not have this problem at all.\r\n\r\nWhat could be the possible reasons for such
  errors in Photoshop CS and CS2? How could I convert my TTF to OTF using FontLab
  software without having such errors in the Photoshop CS and CS2?\r\n\r\nI hope that
  you can tell me more about the solutions for these painful problems.\r\n\r\nThank
  you for your time.\r\n\r\nAsh O.\r\nOsaka .."

    add OpenType features, there is no reason to convert to an OpenType format. And
    even if you add OpenType features, there is no need to switch from TrueType outlines
    to PostScript outlines. (Which is suggested by using the .otf suffix). \r\n\r\nSee

  body: "Dear Ralf H.\r\n\r\nI do thank you for your contribution regarding the myths
    about Opentype Fonts. The same problem is also encountered with Truetype fonts
    when using Adobe Photoshop. It is not a problem of the font type.\r\n\r\nI have
    found through reading in the Internet some facts about opentype fonts. I have
    read that \"Opentype should be far better at handling fonts that contain variant
    glyphs of the same characters, particularly Hindu fonts where individual letters
    often combine into complex ligatures. Various high-end features in these fonts
    currently only work in high-end desktop publishing software.\"\r\n\r\nYou can
    find more about the benefits of Opentype/CFF over Truetype:\r\nhttp://blogs.adobe.com/typblography/2010/12/the-benefits-of-opentypecff-over-truetype.html\r\n\r\n"

    slap on the OT features you want plus a dummy DSIG (Digital SIGnature) for the
    WinXP users, and you're sitting on the top of the world."

    options available, what counts is which features are defined in the font to begin
    with.\r\n\r\n(But leaving his mistaken expectations for what they are: the one
    thing that's missing from this discussion so far is an explanation for why his
    attempt to simply convert from one type to another failed.\r\nIt might be as simple
    as that he left the original fonts installed as well -- invalidating all font
    caches etc.)"

    is not really a proper conversion. I would expect a lot of problems with such

    directly generate a PostScript-based OTF font from that. Those are different formats
    and you need to take care of converting TT to PS outlines, correct path directions,
    convert the hinting and so on. And as we have said before: there is not even a
    reason to do all this. "

    or TT-flavoured OpenType fonts, they are FUBAR. Period.\r\n\r\nIn short, do not
    convert between TT and CFF unless you must. There are just too many pits, traps

    be difficult (and in this case rather pointless) to diagnose. If the errors do
    persist, you can try clearing the font caches by searching your system for \u201Cadobefnt*.lst\u201D
