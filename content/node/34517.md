body: "Just curious if this MSN User Group is dead. I signed-up to it last week per
  Jim Gallagher's recommendation toward Font Validator, and have yet to receive a
  notification.\r\n\r\nIt appears this is the only way one can download the program
  - understandable, coming from MS.\r\n\r\nUnless anyone is aware of another validation
  tool? I use TTX.exe quite a bit, as well as TTFDUMP.exe, but to me these tools are
  not quite giving me the kind of feedback I'm interested in.\r\n\r\nAnd suggestions
  would be greatly appreciated.\r\n"
