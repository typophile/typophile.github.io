  that elaborates this aspect of typography.\r\n\r\nIt's not clear to me exactly when
  the kitsch phenomena started to influence typography (was it in art-nouveau period?).\r\n\r\nWhat
  books would you guys suggest I read?"

    on America</a> has a few essays but mostly poloroids of vernacular types along
    with some pages of his own lettering style. \r\n\r\nKitch type probably wasn't
    really explored until the dadaist movement but the cubists also incoporated lettering
    into thier work (though not as kitchy as the dadaists). "

      are the basic differences between a kitsch and a vernacular type. Just to clarify
      my thoughts."

    reflects a more \"lowbrow taste\". That said ,  I certainly don't think the lowbrow
    nature of kitsch always equates to low-quality.  A professor I had in college
    likened kitsch to pink plastic flamingos in peoples' lawns.\r\n\r\nAmy provided
    good examples of quality kitsch typefaces in Veer and House Industries. House
    Industries has published a book on their own work. Check it out at http://www.houseind.com/index.php?page=showfont&id=143\r\n\r\nVernacular
    is more difficult for me to define. I would classify the Los Feliz sample I recommended
    earlier as vernacular, as well as Ed Fella's book."

  body: "Kitsch is my schtick so I'm surprised not to have been mentioned in this
    thread . . . visit fontdiner.com\r\n\r\nGenerally speaking, your original question
    really never was answered . . . Kitsch typography originated shortly after 1942
    when America went to war and GIs were returning home. It was a prosperous era
    for many Americans who had more leisuretime and surplus income.\r\n\r\nThe demand
    for entertainment, dining and consumer products was being fed by a hungry audience
    and so the demand was handily met by companies and advertisers. As a reflection
    of this time of prosperity and optimism, the typography followed suit.\r\n\r\nPart
    of what enhanced the expressiveness of the letterforms was the stark contrast
    to the environment the type sat with. There were plenty of 'simple' packaging
    solutions that called greatly to the type as well as inventive architecture and
    signage. At this time in history, generally speaking, type was still highly functional
    in that it needed to serve its purpose as 'directional' or 'informational' but
    since it was the focus, it had the opportunity to influence the reader by interjecting
    aspects of personality.\r\n\r\nThat's my version of Kitsch type in a nutshell
    . . .\r\n\r\nStuart :D"

  body: "To follow up more on your original question about its influence on digital
    typography, I'd be inclined to say it probably started with the first digitization
    of late 40s style photo lettered type. It's hard to say what that font would have
    been but I suspect a font like Parade or Contrmporary Brush bold which was bundled
    with Windows 95 would have been among the first.\r\n\r\nYou'd almost have to find
    foundry specimen books from 1984 to 1990 to see when digital Kitsch came back
    . . . Then if you follow the indie fonts boom of the early 1990s you can see when
    it came more mainstream into the font world through today when we're seeing a
    resugence of ephemeral influenced typefaces that are being created from original
    specimens.\r\n\r\nStuart :D"

    does I think Americans would normally call <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retro\">retro</a>
    or nostalgia.\r\n\r\nKitsch is a German word and concept that to some extent has
    migrated to English. <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kitsch\">Here</a>
    is a discussion of its original meaning, which is really negative. \r\n\r\nI'm
    sure others can give more information on how these terms have changed, but to
    me 'kitch' implies bad taste, and not just nostalgia. "

  body: "IMHO kitsch lettering is often very ornate (eg snowcapped caps, type constructed
    out of pieces of stylized wood, ornamented stuff) and that kind of artwork is
    hard to adapt to a working digital typeface. The PostScript 3 format was often
    used for that (I think PS3 even supported grayscale), but even then you'd run
    into errors when trying to output to film (too many linepaths and so on). So maybe
    there is a reason why not much of the kitsch stuff made it to digital\u2026\r\n\r\n(Sorry
    if this makes no sense, I' m just a graphic designer)."

  body: "According to Abraham Moles in his book about understanding the Kitsch phenomena,
    <i>art nouveau</i> is to be considered an example of Kitsch in its germinal form.
    Later, after WWII, Kitsch became what Moles called Neokitsch. That was when the
    Gadget Era began.\r\n\r\nThere are some more contemporary studies that believe
    Kitsch's third form came to be through the 90s Digital Boom. Umberto Eco used
    to say that Kitsch is nothing more than the excess of ways to meet one end. That's
    exactly what we see happening on this popularization of graphic softwares - so
    many tools to make a single flyer.\r\n\r\nI think that labeling Kitsch just as
    \"bad taste\" is not to fully realise the size and importance this phenomena has
    on our everyday lives. Kitsch is much more than just an adjective; it's how one
    relates to an object or to some graphic elements, like typefaces. What I'm trying
    to do on my studies is to understand how this digital typography boom from the
    90s effectively brought back the Kitsch culture from the beginning of the XX century."
