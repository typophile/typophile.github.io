  body: LuLu is OK, but their colour isn't necessarily spot on. I've been reasonably
    pleased with the work I've done with them in the past.

  body: "You may be interested in this book, published via LuLu, which is a series
    of tests on their quality: http://www.lulu.com/content/2709735\r\n\r\nIf you google
    the book title, there's plenty of discussion of it elsewhere.\r\n\r\nI just got
    a sample copy of a color book from LuLu, and I'm generally pretty happy with it.
    The cut and glue job is the best I've seen from them, and the color passed in
    the opinions of some non-designers I put the book in front of. Still waiting on
    a sample of one of their hardcovers, though."
