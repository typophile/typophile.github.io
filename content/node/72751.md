  bloody hard to come up with something I like. I've finally settled on something
  and would like your opinion if that's alright. I'm no type designer/typographer
  but I do have a passion for it and always interested in learning more.\r\n\r\nI've
  gone for a superfat Bodoni here. I'm Italian and the name of the website is too.
  I just chose something shorter and easier to spell than my own name. It's two words
  really (from the film partly of the same name) but I've shoved them together.\r\n\r\nWhat
  I liked about the word I found so hard to design for is the continuity and symmetry
  of the letters u-o-n-o in a serifed italic. I morphed the Bodoni U and N into one
  character to fit this and turned it upside down. I also made a bit of a ligature
  out of the L and the B.\r\n\r\nIt's not an important logo specifically it just needs
  to reside on my portfolio website and possible the business card if I decide to
  print one.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/ilb-1_4949.png]"

  body: It looks like a really nice logomark and has a nice rhythm to it. Without
    a comparison, I can't visualize the difference in what you did with the 'u' and
    'n' but it works well. If I did anything to this myself I would just want to look
    at versions with a disconnect at the top of the 'lb' ligature as well just to
    see how it feels to let the eye not be blocked up top there which might create
    a bit more continuity to the overall undulation between all the characters, but
    that's just my subjective take on it all. Nice work.

  body: "I like it a lot. Seemingly simple yet clean and timeless. I half agree with
    Mike J on the disconnect between the 'L' & 'B', but on the other hand I think
    that sort of defines it's character too, setting it off slightly.\r\n\r\nGreat
    stuff.\r\n\r\nJH"

    with me, but  the closest on MyFonts shows what the original was like.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/bodoni_4571.png]"
