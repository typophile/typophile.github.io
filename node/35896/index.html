  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>hi everybody,</p>
<p>i have a client that is asking that i create a logo using the same font as the &ldquo;roberto cavalli&rdquo; logo. i am doing my own research now (and did a search on here to see if this already came up), but i know we have some real geniuses on this board, so i would appreciate any help or tips!</p>
<p>thanks in advance, you guys are the best!</p>
<p>sincerely,
c</p>
<p>p.s. i imagine it is most likely a custom-drawn logo, but it is probably based on an existing font, right? or how could i approximate it as best as possible? that cool lower-case narrow, rounded r, for example,or the e, with the diagonal bar. i am looking through compressed, gothic fonts, maybe with a slight art-deco styling to them?</p>

<p>You’d get the rounded ‘r’ and the diagonal ‘e’ with “roberto” in ChaletComprimé CologneSixty or MilanSixty  and and “cavalli” CologneSeventy or MilanSeventy from House Industries.

Still a long way away, though.

		<div class="commentbody"><p>hey thanks sihep this is excellent!!!</p>
<p>i think this is very very close, at least for my purposes.</p>
<p>i guess the biggest difference that i can see is just the rounded/smooth corners of the original logo, that organic quality it has.</p>
<p>(what is that called btw? when the edges and corners are soft and worn in, like old, real type, vs. the hard geometric edges of vector-drawn fonts &ndash;  like that organic font used a lot now in new york magazine)</p>
<p>also, the &ldquo;t&rdquo; is a bit different, the terminal and the crossbar, and the cavalli logo is more oval/oblong, whereas this one is taller and sharper, but it is FANTASTIC!</p>
<p>i can also work with the ascenders and make the shorter, and that will help the x-height look more similar.</p>
<p>and you know what, i actually like that thin version much better than the real logo!</p>
<p>and, just to show you how great it is, let me show you where i was &ndash; i was way back with bodega sans light! yikes!</p>
<p>thanks again!!![img:sites/default/files/old-images/cavalli_bodega_5748.jpg]</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Unfortunately it’s compressed and what you’re after is condensed. Glad that was helpful, though. There’s also Dax Condensed Medium from FontShop with a similar ‘r’ and ‘e’ but it doesn’t have the same retro look.</p>
<p>&ldquo;i guess the biggest difference that i can see is just the rounded/smooth corners of the original logo, that organic quality it has&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Had a quick look at <a href="http://www.robertocavalli.com">www.robertocavalli.com</a> and think the type has hard geometric edges – those might just be pixels.</p>
<p>&ldquo;what is that called btw? when the edges and corners are soft and worn in, like old, real type, vs. the hard geometric edges of vector-drawn fonts — like that organic font used a lot now in new york magazine)&rdquo;</p>
<p>Don’t know, unfortunately. I’ve seen a few of those with ‘Antique’ after the name

<p>Have also heard ‘distressed’ used but think this refers to mid-1990s CalArts/Cranbrook font-mangling rather than just including irregularities from letterpress or a typewriter. You should post the question and get a proper answer from someone who designs typefaces.</p>
