  body: "Subset them.\r\n\r\nI'm assuming this is for a specimen. If you turn the
    fonts to outlines you are not showing the fonts in action. People will not be
    getting to see the actual fonts. Also, turning them to outlines gives anyone access
    to the outlines who wants them. "

  body: "Hey Tiffany, just so I'm clear, what do you mean by \"..you are not showing
    the fonts in action\"?  Also, just so I know for future reference, how does turning
    them to outlines give anyone access to them, assuming you lock the pdf in the
    first place?  I'm genuinely asking - not being argumentative.\r\n\r\nJH"

  body: "I just mean that turning them to outlines renders them as vector artwork
    and not font software with hinting intact. \r\n\r\nAlso, there are programs out
    there that can crack a PDF. "

    he's really saying is there is no way to stop someone ripping your font.  If they
    really want to get it, they'll figure one way or another of getting in.\r\n\r\nUnhelpful
    comment if it's not going to be qualified by an explanation though, I grant you.\r\n\r\nJH"
