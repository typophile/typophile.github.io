  body: "I agree with Patty, although I would have said Chalet New York 60 & 70 would
    provide the right mix of letters.\r\n\r\nNorbert, maybe you are thinking of Blippo
    Bold, which had many alternates in its film type version. See the image in my
    <a href=\"http://bowfinprintworks.com/BauhausFaces1.html\" target=\"new\">Bauhaus-style
    Font ID Guide</a>, which was taken from the old Phil's Photo book.\r\n\r\n- Mike

  body: Yup, Mike. I originally looked for Blippo specimens with alternates, your
    sample gave me "flashbacks" of old acid trips. I also recall a similar version
    called Bubble from VGC.

    to get the J, and futzing with sizes to achieve the x-height. Oliver's people
    have the money, I'm sure.\r\n\r\nOr it could be another face altogether."

  body: "Oooooh, Chalet New York 60 & 70 are very close aren't they. Thanks for the
    prompts Patty and Mike. \r\n\r\nI'm sure I've seen it used for other logo's...
    hmmmmm. I'll zapp Jamies site designers and see if they'll cough up details, before
    I drop the \xA3... $... \u20AC... and a couple of hours in Illustrator. heh.\r\n\r\nG"
