  font pack. After doing some research on this forum I came across two particular
  options that seems to fit what I need\r\n\r\nAdobe FontFolio Education Essentials,\r\n\r\nor\r\n\r\nthe
  1000 fonts from bitstream that are stored with CorelDraw Graphic Suite X5\r\n\r\nnow
  my question is which would be better for someone in my position?\r\n\r\nShould I
  stick with the Adobe collection because of the versatility of it's collection, or
  get the CorelDraw fonts because of the vast immensity in the scale of what it offers?
  Which of the two would offer me a better ground as far as building up my skills,
  and collection from?\r\n\r\nExcuse this post if it's in the wrong section, and if
  this has been posted before feel free to close it and redirect me towards the thread.\r\n\r\nHere
  are links to the mentioned packs\r\n\r\nCorelDraw list\r\nhttp://graphics-unleashed.unleash.com/2010/02/coreldraw-x5-font-list-posted.asp\r\n\r\nAdobe
  Font Folio Education Essentials\r\nhttp://www.adobe.com/education/products/fontfolioeducationessentials/\r\n\r\nThank
  you in advanced for any guidance in the matter.\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    Corel one... In my opinion, you don't need that many typefaces. Specially not
    those."

  body: "I am also a student, and I bought the adobe package and am happy with it.
    A lot of the fonts are \"Pro\" fonts with lots of opentype features, extended
    glyph sets, large families with different weights, optical sizes...\r\n\r\nThe
    PDF adobe provides is very long and hard to read - they used to have another PDF
    on this page: http://blogs.adobe.com/typblography/2008/03/ffee.html\r\n\r\nbut
    the link is dead now. I have the one-page PDF with a summary of the families that
    that page used to link to - how can I attach a PDF?.\r\n\r\nSome of the non-Adobe-created
    families only have a few fonts, so they're kind of a teaser (DIN, Futura, Baskerville,
    Officina, etc.), but it's still great to have a legal copy of at least some of
    the weights of those great families.\r\n\r\nThere is a bunch of overlap with the
    fonts that come with Creative Suite, but I found it worth the price to get the
    additional fonts.\r\n\r\nThere's also this: http://www.adobe.com/education/products/typeclassics.html
    - slightly cheaper but not as good.\r\n\r\nI keep meaning to do a chart showing
    the differences between the CS5, the FFEE, and the TypeClassics font lists. That
    would be useful...\r\n"

    Adobe Font Folio Education Essentials and the fonts that come with CS5:\r\n\r\n--Rosewood
    Std: both have 2 fonts\r\n--Trajan Pro: both have 2 fonts\r\n--Caslon Pro: both
    have 6 fonts\r\n--Chaparral Pro: CS5 has 6 fonts, FFEE has 32\r\n--Myriad Pro:
    CS5 has 12 fonts, FFEE has 40\r\n--Adobe Garamond: CS5 has 4 fonts of Garamond

    may.\r\n\r\nMyFonts currently lists [[http://new.myfonts.com/search/tag%3Afree/fonts/|about
    600 free fonts]]. Much crap, ok, but if you look into it you\u2019ll find some
    very decent offerings adding to your basic starter set: e.g. Museo, Secca or Novel.
    In any case, check with the glyph contents of freefonts, it tends to be limited.
    \r\n\r\nAnd, of course, you\u2019re welcome to give [[http://www.signographie.de/cms/front_content.php?idart=194|Andron]]
    and [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/andreas-stotzner/lapidaria/medior-light/|Lapidaria]]
    a try as well  ;-)"

    which is well represented by Adobe.\r\nBut typography is a practical discipline,
    and your education will be limited and limiting if you develop work habits in
    such a straight groove.\r\n\r\nI wrote about this issue <a href=\"http://www.shinntype.com/Writing/PerfcSet.pdf\">here</a>;
    that was ten years ago (before OpenType), so the examples are out of date\u2014but

    package (along with some fabulous folks from AIGA), I would say... why not get
    both?\r\n\r\nYeah, if you can only get one, get the Adobe package. But if you
    can afford both, get them both.\r\n\r\nThat being said, the Adobe package by itself
    will give you plenty to work with and explore for a while.\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\nT"

  body: "Thank you all for the responses.\r\n\r\nMugford - Very helpful, yeah the
    overlap isn't necessarily that much and it seems like it still is a quality package
    at a ridiculous price, so I think I will be purchasing the education essentials
    to get started off. Thanks for taking the time to compile the links and the actual
    details of the adobe collection super helpful.\r\n\r\nAndreas - Thanks for the
    suggestion, your right it is a bit novel to think that I need that many faces,
    I would spend hours looking at all the various fonts packages with the corel product,
    that I probably wouldn't get anything done design wise as I ogle through the list
    haha. Very nice suggestions though. Thank you.\r\n\r\nNick - Thanks for that link,
    that really put something in perspective for myself in regards to how I view the
    practice of typography, it was critically informative. Thank you.\r\n\r\nThomas
    - Your right, although I would need much restraint, purchasing the corel pack
    doesn't automatically mean I have to let myself drown in a sea of fonts, well
    taken advice. Thank you.\r\n\r\nAluminum - Yeah that was the page which actually
    led me to post this question as I wanted to deepen my knowledge of whats effective
    and not, thanks, that page is an invaluable source.\r\n\r\nI guess one lesson
    that I came across is that even though this is a big start for myself, it is only
    a small step in my life long journey of type education it appears."
