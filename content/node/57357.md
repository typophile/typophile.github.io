  typeface in particular, I notice that close proximity nodes can make hinky little
  curve kinks when complying with the little red arrow beastie and inserting the requested
  node. The curves look better without it on screen and on laser prints so what the
  hell is the point? I understand in upright fonts where nodes align nicely for hinting

  body: Chris, FWIW, I had an oblique font fail at the test stage (at least I think
    that was the reason) because I had the same problem and tried to ignore it. FontBook
    would not validate the font and would not display all characters. This setting
    in preferences makes correcting easier without too many distortions, but still
    requires lots of manual fiddling:[img:sites/default/files/old-images/simpl_5709.png]

  body: "I think the points at extrema are desirable because of hinting. \r\n\r\nBut
    I don't think it's as important in italic, extrema aren't going to define widths
    as clearly. I see the same thing you do and I'm just going my merry with all those
    red arrows, whenever putting an extremum makes stuff look worse. \r\n\r\nHopefully
    a hinting maven can enlighten us. I was encouraged by hearing Matthew Carter say
    he breaks the \"rules\" regularly. "

  body: "I've heard Matthew say the same, Bill, but I assume he knows better than
    I which red arrow to forget.  Perhaps I should look at some italic fonts I own
    and see if any other type designers think the red arrows are pisssahs.\r\n\r\nYes,
    Bill, I also think hinting in italics is a whole nother thang than upright fonts.\r\n\r\nChrisL"
