  found it! I&acute;m a graphic design student and i&acute;ve been a bit of a font
  freak lately. So I tried making one of my own &#40;i know it&acute;s not highly
  original, but anyhow&#41;. If the font turns out ok, it&acute;ll probably be used
  as a font for a national media arts students&acute; festival here in Finland. Here
  is a sample of the outcome so far:  <BR> <BR><A HREF="http://www.kyamk.fi/~vi9gvisa/testi.gif"

  think of it? Any feedback is highly appreciated!'

  body: ' Nice work! <BR> <BR>I like the curved diagonals on the upper case. I&#39;d
    like to see it applied to the uc &#34;K&#34; as well. <BR> <BR>I also really like
    the numerals, especially &#34;2&#34; and &#34;5&#34;. <BR> <BR>Both uc &#34;Z&#34;
    and lc &#34;z&#34; look a bit top-right-heavy. Try extending the lower stroke
    just a bit to balance them. <BR> <BR>David '

  body: ' Thanks! Good points, one and all, David. I will certainly take these suggestions
    into consideration.  <BR> <BR>Here&acute;s an list of Characters I also think
    I need to work with &#40;let&acute;s see if you guys agree with me&#41;: <BR>
    <BR>UC: <BR> <BR>J needs to be condensed a bit <BR>Yes, K, &#40;I hurried a bit
    on that one&#41;, needs a whole new form... something in style of the R.  <BR>Q&acute;s
    tail needs to be extended a bit <BR> <BR>LC: <BR> <BR>Definitely the &acute;f&acute;.
    It Seems to create too much negative space. On the right.   <BR> <BR>NUMERALS:
    <BR> <BR>All numerals should maybe have a same kind of twist as that of number
    5&acute;s. Or should they? <BR>8&acute;s lower part should maybe be heavier than
    the upper part. <BR> <BR>So what do you think? '
