body: "I'm looking for a version of the Times New Roman font, but it's a little difficult
  to explain. Basically a few of the lower case letters have similar qualities to
  the capital case letters, such as the  A and E and H and I and R, in such a way
  that they'd be just as tall and wide as the capitals, but would still be in lower
  case format.\r\nThe alphabet might look a little like this:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/obscure
  times new roman type face_6394.PNG]\r\nNow obviously this isn't it, I just took
  the basic Times New Roman font and attempted to make it look like the one I'm looking
  for. But you get the basic idea (I hope).\r\nI know this typeface has been used
  on a few book covers, I just can't get to thinking of which ones. Young Adult Fiction
  I'm sure, I can't quite put a finger on it though.\r\nAnyways, if you could help
  me out, that'd be fantastic."
