  its letter \"n\".\r\nI know it may be a typeface, so I'm wondering if anybody know
  of it or something very similar.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/nh-hotels_5867.jpg]\r\n\r\nThank
  you."

  body: For /nH, I would probably start with [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/agfa/rotis-semi-serif/|Rotis
    Semi Serif]], only need to tweak the /n top serif into a slab one.

  body: "Yes possibly, and I believe the n and H are not the same font (one is serif,
    the other not).\r\nEven I assume the H is not even a font, but made up from rectangels
    in the width-size of the n legs.\r\nBut still waiting if anybody know something
    similar."
