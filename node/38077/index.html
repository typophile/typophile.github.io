<div class="post-content e-content" itemprop=articleBody>I’m working on a Logo for marketing services company: Energy Communicates. Mostly to devise and establish annual event, and sponsorship plans, as well as public relations and conference organisers. Most of their clients are corporate sector.
The client wanted a logo with cingularesque look, like abstract views of a meeting or people communicating. They also wanted an appealing and charismatic shape.
The logo: The clients wanted a personality / human feel, not just another marketing firm or a brand management not as they exist on data sheets but in peoples minds. The two shapes an ascending joined piece, meeting or people communicating...facing each other on positive right direction, only to show ascension, growth, positivity, forward etc.
I'd appreciate suggestions on how can I tighten it up the logo so it holds together as a unified form? I feel something is missing or how can I infuse it with a bit more energy? </div>

<div class=commentbody>Oh I see it makes sense now...I didn't realise Bahamas logo with the shapes I've in mind. I'll drop the colours then and I've updated with amended concepts. I still feel something is missing or how can I infuse it with a bit more energy without looking like Bahamas Logo?

<div class=commentbody>Moen? Never heard of it...I've google it and I see www.moen.com
They're Kitchen, Bathroom and Showers decors in US/Canada. I'm on the other side of the Atlantic pond so I'll bear that in mind. Interesting logo though....water droplets, hot/cold...that is the way I see it.
I've talked to my client about changing the approach of the logo...they're sticking to their cingularesque look, like abstract views of a meeting or people communicating. I'll try and play around and I'll see what I'll come up with.
Thank you DOGG for pointing out Moen.</div>

It isn’t a unique shape, although it is rarer than a regular polygon, it is will turn up now and again – the treatment is the key. Rather than point out similarities (I don’t think Moen really counts) the type will benefit from better kerning, ‘ener’ and ‘communicates’ are very tight and in the case of ‘communicates’ too small. It is crucial to test logos at the sizes that they will be used at – start with a business card up to the side of a van or exhibition panel. The g and y are currently a bit wide and light compared to the density of ‘ener’, whether they should be adapted or the ‘ener’ altered is up to you. I enjoy the two storey g versions although both the characters are facing in the same direction, perhaps the bottom storey could be reflected.

<div class=commentbody>Thanks a million Timid...your comments is much appreciated. As I'm aware the letter g is still wide and I've reduced the width of Y. I'm aware the ‘ener’ and ‘communicates’ are very tight and in the case of ‘communicates’ is too small.
For now I just want to focus the logo itself and get it right of abstract views of a meeting or people communicating.
- the the two storey g versions
- reflected the two storey g versions.
- four shapes all in the same direction except the green one to give the impression of public relations and conference.
I'd appreciate your thoughts on modified concepts and which one work the best?
The logo wil never be on a van or on a TV!!! Most definity on printed stationery, website, company literate, promotions, ads, pull up stands & t-shirts.

<div class=commentbody>Alma,
I don't think you are ever going to see "energy" in these current iterations. Everything here is very static and sedate. If you want energy, look at size relationships and interactions between the elements in the logo and/or the type. The lowercase 'g' could be revised so the point in the counter points up to the right, then maybe you could have some of your other elements extend from that, almost like it was sparking or something. It'll require a bit of work to get there, though. And while color can be part of the equation here, it shouldn't be the only one. The form itself should give off enough energy and dynamism that a lack of color won't undo it.
Also, "communicates" is still way too small to be readable on a business card. Your original lockup is better, albeit still too-tightly letterspaced.</div>

<div class=commentbody>I think something powerful could get out of your work! Although, something seems to be missing... But what?!
Hope this little lexical field will inspire you ;) !
ENERGY: 1. A fundamental constituent of matter (e=mc 2 ). 2. The capacity to do work 3. Kinetic energy (mechanical), potential energy (gravitational), electrical energy, chemical energy (molecular, nuclear), radiant energy (light, electromagnetic radiation) and heat energy. 4. The capacity to cause change in a system; origin of processes, system dynamics. 5. Energy sources: oil, coal, natural gas, ethanol, wind, water, biomass, chemistry, geothermal, nuclear, and the primary energy source for living systems on Earth, the sun. 6. Energy utilization and technologies: e.g. nuclear fission/fusion, renewable energy technologies, alternative/soft energy, energy efficiency. (See MOMENTUM, ENTROPY, WORK, MATTER, PROCESS, HEATING, ELECTROMAGNETIC RADIATION, SOFT ENERGY, RENEWABLE ENERGY TECHNOLOGIES) (MP)
(en·er·gy) (en´ər-je) [Gr. energeia] the capacity to operate or work; the capacity to produce motion, to overcome resistance, and to effect physical changes. Symbol E.
communication.
The movement of data from one part of a system to another. Local communication is the movement of data between the processor and memory; global communication is the movement of data from one node to another. The exchange of information between two points.

<div class=commentbody>It doesn't really achieve the personal / human touch you wanted to go for. Try a less geometric typeface, something warmer and friendlier. Also the difference in type size between "energy" and "communicates" is too great - meaning the smaller text isn't legible when the logo is printed small.</div>

<div class=commentbody>I think "energy" is best symbolized by some kind of flow. The current concept looks OK by itself, but it appears too static for the word "energy".</div>
