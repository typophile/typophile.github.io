  or Formula TS ExtraBold.  I have looked at daFont and Font Squirrel and so far have
  had no luck.  I was hopping someone here might be able to point me in the direction
  or better yet introduce me to a substitute.  \r\n\r\nThanks\r\n\r\n"

  body: 'Cause it is not my call.  My Boss told me to find a FREE font that mimicked
    those listed above.  For some background info, I get where you guys are coming
    from being one of 2 designers at a .net web design company which is staffed mostly
    by developers and run by people who think like developers.  Developers don''t
    value fonts and graphics and don''t see why they should pay for them when they
    THINK they can get quality ones for free.  They would rather send me out on a
    wild goose chase rather than pay for the font and save me the time.  I don''t
    even have a type as basic as Helvetic on my computer because the cost is extra.   I
    came here because I was told you guys know type.  I am not trying to rub anyone
    the wrong way or spark any debates.  I am simply trying to get a job done and
    maximize my time.   So if you guys could help me with that I would really appreciate
    it. If you guys do not every provide anyone with this kind of assistance I hope
    someone will just take the time to flat out say that.  And if that is the case
    I am sorry for the bother and I will take my problem somewhere else. '

  body: "Just ask him if $18 is too much for the real thing. Otherwise, considering
    your explanation, maybe you can just use Arial Black and they won't notice/care?\r\n\r\nPlease
    be mindful of the fact that Typophile is good because we value type.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
