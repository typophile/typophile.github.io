body: "I am designing a business card that needs to include an email address, which
  leads me to the dreaded @ symbol. I despise this symbol, and have been toying with
  a substitution,\r\n(AT ligatures) especially since designing in faces such as Garamond,
  Hoefler etc. \r\nDo not go with such a modern symbol. What are your thoughts on
  this? "

  body: "You can certainly replace it with the word 'at'. Of course, then, to avoid
    any inconsistency, you have to treat the dot sign the same way. Yourname at hotmail
    dot com, for instance.\r\n\r\nMy question is, do you have a good reason to do
    it?\r\n\r\nI, for one, wouldn't break the rule at the expense of clarity."

  body: "It's not as if the \"@\" is anything new. It has been around at least almost
    as long as there have been typewriters, if not longer. Only the usage is modern,
    and even that goes back to the late \u201970s. I read some report on the history
    of the thing a while back. I wish I could recall the link.\r\n\r\nAnyway, if you
    don't like the way the character fits in with the typeface, redesign it, but make
    sure it will still be understood as what it is."

  body: "In my designs, I've used a vertical 'at' ligature, as well as a lot of other
    ideas. One im nearly done with has a very low tail, extended-right tail extending
    into the next letter, another looks like an underlined 'a', a (c) or an (r) symbol.
    Since none of these have had any negative feedback whatsoever, I'd say theres
    a ton of freedom in what you want it to look like. The places were an @ is used
    are pretty well understood, and not normally inside of words, so you can get away
    with more.\r\n\r\nChoz Cunningham\r\n!Exclamachine Type Foundry\r\nhttp://www.exclamachine.com"

  body: I designed a business card using {at} instead of the @ symbol for what sounds
    like similar reasons. It is all hypothetical until you actually try it. Maybe
    show us what you are considering?

  body: From a design functionality standpoint, the @ serves a rather important role...it
    makes it easily to quickly identify the email address. I'd think hard before replacing
    it with anything else.

  body: ">important role\u2026\r\n\r\nI think this is right on point. I think that
    with the symbols in general--# % + \xA9 and so on, the point of them is partly
    to *not* look like the other letters, so they stand out as markers of the text
    as different in the way indicated by the marker. When they are well designed they
    harmonize, but are different enough to be noticed as markers.   "
