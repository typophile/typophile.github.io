    out of stock; the Barnes and Noble in Glendale only has the March issue. Maybe
    we have to be patient. Have you found it anywhere else?

    both carry the magazine, but neither had it in stock, and of course they had no
    clue when they&#39;d get a shipment. I was worried that the April issue had already
    come and sold out&#42;, so I called the grand-daddy of magazine stands in LA:
    Bungalow News in Pasadena, where they keep track of everything - real pros. They
    had the March/#56 in stock, and said the April should arrive by the end of next
    week. The big dumb chains will probably get it around then too. <BR> <BR>&#42;
    Although since the magazine is an import that seemed unlikely. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>'

  body: How odd - although I wrote an article for this mag back in fall 2002 for their
    2003 typography ish, I did not knowingly contribute to the current issue. Are
    they recycling material, or have I just lost my mind? <BR> <BR>Jim, what&#39;s
    the title of the article I am quoted in or whatever? The piece I did for them
    in 2002 featured typographic tips and tricks from a number of other designers,
    including Nick, Rich, and Stuart, as well as Allan Haley, Brian Sooy, etc. <BR>
    <BR>I&#39;d love to get my hands on a copy if you could send me one. I&#39;ll
    buy you cocktails at TypeCon in exchange for you purchasing and mailing it to

    <BR> <BR>Jim, that sounds like the exact piece I did for them in 2002, except
    it sounds like they&#39;ve switched the order of the tips and tricks around. Some
    of the other content sounds like stuff from the same issue &#40;#39, on stands
    in late Nov. 2002&#41;. Weird.

  body: 'I pick up this magazine sometimes and I&#39;ve noticed that they have two
    types of editions: the normal Computer Arts issue and the Computer Arts Special
    issue. The Special issues are always anthologies of previously published articles
    from the regular Computer Arts issues on a particular topic &#40;type, Photoshop,
    Flash, whatever&#41;. <BR> <BR>By the way, why is the type in Computer Arts so
    darned tiny? This is especially true in their how-to articles. The explanatory
    text is sometimes set in about 5-point type. You need a magnifying glass to see
    the screen shots.'

    specific issue, and they never mentioned re-publishing in future issues, nor did
    they contact me about it.

    <BR> <BR>The first line, definitely, but there&#39;s probably an unwritten &#40;and
    maybe even written - somewhere, in small print&#41; agreement that they can re-use
    anything a writer submits. I think that&#39;s standard practice for a magazine,
    even when you simply submit a letter, let alone an article they pay you &#40;or
    barter&#41; for. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>'

    backup offer- Jim&#41;, and it&#39;s not cheap, but man is it a keeper! Nearly
    a hundred pages of pure font action, covering a huge spectrum, and largely competently
    too. Most <i>books</i> about type don&#39;t have this much content. <BR> <BR>hhp
