body: "This sample comes from the marquee of a restored theatre. The building was
  built in 1927 and restored in the late 1980s. When it was new, the theatre showed
  movies and the marquee displayed information about current attraction(s). I do not
  know whether this static type replaced the customizable marquee before or during
  the restoration, but it was not original to the building, which is listed on the
  National Register of Historic Places.\r\n\r\nAside from the W, the closest thing
  I can find with these earmarks is Serlio. Since this is signage, not print, it's
  possible the W was simplified to make it easier to construct, but I'd love to find
  out if this specific character set rings a bell here.\r\n\r\nI have run this through
  WhatTheFont (using a version with the perspective corrected) and have looked through
  Rookledge's International Typefinder, both to no avail.\r\n\r\nMy thanks in advance
  for any assistance.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/MWTC_3528.jpg]"
