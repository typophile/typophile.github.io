  decided to put up my random little typographic thoughts<br>\r\ninto a visual journal.
  Please let me know what you think. \r\n<br><a href=\"http://www.salsen.com\">http://www.salsen.com</a><br>\r\nAlso,
  I recently decided to combine my love of type with<br>\r\noptical illusions to create
  some interesting effects, so<br>\r\nexpect more of that in the future!"

  body: AS, I'm surprised you liked the stereogram best considering the fact that
    you can't see it. I put the black X marks there to indicate the amount of unfocusing
    you should attempt- merge the two Xs into one, and it'll work. Thanks for the
    comments.

    is actually a big pleasure to read the beauty throught different angles,\r\nand
    since beauty is a language, luckily it is not only written.\r\nI tried to overlap
    the two parts but the position of the X marks is not precise.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\nAS"
