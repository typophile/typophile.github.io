body: "greetings all!\r\nI post here with hopes of any and all feedback, critiques,
  suggestions, etc. regarding the visual identity for my one-woman company, Lamoore
  Designs (Based in NOVA Scotia, canada.)\r\ni'm a full-time artist and product designer/maker.\r\ni
  am *not* a graphic designer, but have hired one to completely overhaul my branding/visual
  identity.\r\nmy preferences are for \"old fashioned\" looking typefaces and layouts,
  and i'm looking for both a mark and a type that will be my new look.\r\nmy avatar
  shows the logo i've been using for the last 4 years.\r\nthe new proposed design
  is here in this post.\r\n\r\nAll of my creative work features found objects, \r\nmy
  line of jewelry is called \"Finders Keepers\", \r\nand my tagline is \"Redefining
  Precious.\" (not \"precious redefined\" as seen in the file)\r\n\r\ni have played
  with the idea of having my biz card printed on actual cereal boxes  or some other
  \"found\" sort of material, but i am open to simply having a design that \"feels\"
  old.\r\nthe design will be used in everything, including:\r\nstorefront signage/hwy
  signage\r\npackaging and promotional\r\nbiz cards and letterhead, etc.\r\nwebsite\r\nlabels\r\n\r\nsome
  key words that define my work would be:\r\nretro/vintage, repurpose/reclaim, eco,
  environmentally responsible, handmade, original...the opposite of commercial, mass-produced,
  common, hi-tech.\r\n\r\nthanks to anyone who wants to jump in here.\r\n\r\n"

    idea. It will set you apart in a way that is appropriate, specific, and poetic.\r\n\r\n\r\nI
    am getting \"old\" from the design you posted, but I'm also getting \"Western\"
    and \"silent film.\" If that's okay, then you are golden."

    counts! \r\ni was prepared for and expecting some harsh criticisms from these
    forms--anyone want to do some \"roasting\"?\r\nyes, most people i show it to comment
    on its \"western-ness\"--i'm more okay with \"silent film\", but i definitely
    don't want my company to be perceived as a dealer of western/cowboy themed goods!"

  body: "* not sure about the bottom font. It really betrays the silent film or western
    feel because it seems to be Bank Gothic (1930s) that has a baseline manipulated
    in photoshop. It feels kinda forced and faux rather than old and authentic.\r\n\r\n*
    sharpening the blurry areas might help with authenticity. The blur to me suggests
    a computer.\r\n\r\n* the DESIGNS might work better in a different font?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/newlogo_0_5790.JPG]"

  body: "I agree about the Western/Silent Film thing, although I think it works.\r\n\r\nBeejay
    mentioned that the fading isn't authentic. It also isn't consistent -- \"Designs\"
    is way more faded than \"LaMoore,\" which makes it seem like it didn't encounter
    a century worth of dust, wind, and rain. The same goes for the little leafy doodad
    above it.\r\n\r\nMaybe if they run the whole design through the same Fade filter,
    it would work better, no?\r\n\r\nOtherwise, I think the cereal box thing is really
    awesome! Let us know how that turns out!\r\n\r\n\r\n-Andrew Welfle"

  body: "thanks everyone, for the feedback on the design, as well as the cereal box
    idea--i'm going ahead with the cereal boxes and will try to remember to post a
    pic when they're finished.\r\nthe idea is not my own. i first came across it when
    i found a letterpress printer offering cereal boxes as a standard choice, and
    now the latest issue of Craft magazine has it as a featured project.\r\nas for
    the design, i found inspiration in a post here in the forums--i've put the pics
    up on the \"type ID\" board. Thanks for the help!"
