  logo for my freelance website and I would really like your input on the details
  like the forms, kerning, and the overall feel. I would like it to communicate \u201Cclean,
  simple, and custom.\u201D\r\n\r\n It is long overdue but my hope is that with your
  help, I will be able to finally push this out. Thank you for your time.\r\n\r\nBtw,
  the green and black is just to make it easier on the eyes and not the scheme I will
  eventually have...\r\n\r\nAce"

  body: "I love the yp ligature, particularly the way the tail of the y curves to
    the right and makes sort of a triangle with curved corners in the negative space.\r\n\r\nThe
    kerning around the o seems too loose, especially on the po side (and maybe a little
    bit on the os side).\r\n\r\nThe sa combination is interesting. They almost look
    like they want to be mirrors of each other, but that's thrown off by the top of
    the a's being a little bit lower (and with a slightly smaller serif) than the
    top of the s has.\r\n\r\nThe only character I don't like is the e... it looks
    like it's grinning with an underbite."

  body: The e is bothersome to me as well. It looks like it got smacked with a frying
    pan.
