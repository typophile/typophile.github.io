    interest periodicals that don't start at square one when it comes to type, that
    assume there is a prosumer reader with some background knowledge.\r\nYou'd think
    no-one had ever written an intro-to-fonts book, that there wasn't a large population
    of typographers in the workforce.\r\nWhat if every movie article featured a history
    of film and name-checked Eisenstein, The Jazz Singer, Monroe and Avatar?\r\n\r\nSo
    the next challenge for Mr Garfield, once his book has educated a few Guardian
    readers on the basics, is to take journalistic type writing to the next level."

    and name-checked Eisenstein, The Jazz Singer, Monroe and Avatar?</cite>\r\n\r\nUnfortunately,
    most members of the general public <em>are</em> <strong>completely</strong> ignorant
    of typography. Unless someone, say as a child, had enough of an interest in printing
    to pick up a book on the subject - or remembers stuff from junior high shop class
    - there's nothing much in popular culture to create an awareness of type.\r\n\r\nThat
    is, of course, until Windows 3.1 came along, though, I have to admit. (The Mac
    used funny names for all of its typefaces in the beginning.)\r\n\r\nHere's just
    one example. Remember the book <em>The Rule of Four</em>, that came out shortly
    after <em>The DaVinci Code</em>? The author was able to go on an interview, and
    go on about how the <em>Hypnerotomachia Poliphilii</em> was this incredibly obscure
    book that he discovered in his research. When, of course, most introductory books
    on typography include photographs of a page or two of the first edition of that
    book, because it illustrates Jenson's roman type. (The French edition is also
    often used to illustrate Garamond.)\r\n\r\nThese days, most people can tell you
    what Times Roman is, because they've seen it in the drop-down menu on Microsoft
    Word. And they may even know that there are 72 points in an inch.\r\n\r\nBut,
    no, they don't have a clue who Frederic W. Goudy was, or Morris Fuller Benton,
    or even Hermann Zapf. Never mind Sumner Stone. And they're not likely to any time
    soon."

  body: "John, you haven't addressed my two main points.\r\n\r\n\"Most\" people don't
    read every article in every periodical.\r\n\r\nThe constituency of those who know
    a bit about type is not solely the professional hard core of graphic designers
    and their ilk.\r\nIt also includes \"graphic artists\" as Pamela Pfiffner terms
    them in her Adobe book, numbering the increase in their ranks wrought by Adobe
    graphics software as 25-fold.\r\nAs well as those who may use type in their professional
    work with more than a passing interest, there are those who use it recreationally,
    and amateurs.\r\nThere is a mixed bag at Typophile. You describe yourself as a
    computer programmer, for instance.\r\n\r\nSecondly to such users, there is the
    general reader of inquiring mind. Such readers can piece together a story from
    bits of information -- I'm rather like that when I read the business section of
    the paper: I don't invest or follows stocks or have a great knowledge of management
    theory and business personalities, but I have a general sense of what's happening
    in the business world. It's not like every article in the business section needs
    to explain what the prime rate is -- although they do go on a lot about Keynes
    (the Bodoni of economics, I assume).\r\n\r\n"

  body: "It's true that an article about type in a general-interest periodical is
    more likely to be read by someone with a knowledge or interest in type.\r\n\r\nWhat
    I am claiming, though, is that the writers of articles like the one under discussion
    are probably correct in assuming that the accessibility of an article would be
    too limited if even the most basic background of knowledge about type were to
    be assumed.\r\n\r\nThe basic background that an introductory book on the subject
    would supply - like the distinction between \"oldstyle\", \"transitional\", and
    \"modern\" serif faces - isn't something people need to know to use Microsoft
    Word.\r\n\r\nAnd, on top of that, because typography is a specialized topic of
    limited interest, a general-interest magazine has to assume that an article on
    that subject might be the first one many of its readers have seen. With the stock
    market - well, the business section of the paper is designed for businessmen.
    And the ups and downs of the stock market affect most people's jobs. So they can
    assume that people have heard of mercantilism and Adam Smith and John Maynard
    Keynes - in fact, they probably learned about mercantilism versus Adam Smith in
    school, when they were being taught about the causes of the American Revolution.\r\n\r\nWe
    live in a world ruled by money and not by art.\r\n\r\nAnd Adam Smith might well
    be the Bodoni - or the Steinitz - of economics; Keynes would be its Nimzovitch
    (its Zapf?)."

    go on about f-stops, depth of field and cutting techniques.\r\nBook reviews don't
    deconstruct the grammatical devices of authors.\r\nInterviews with celebrities
    are about them and how they deal with their work, not the work per se.\r\n\r\nMost
    general media coverage concerns the meta-world of the subject, leaving the technicalities
    to trade media.\r\n\r\n90% of the stroies in the arts section of a periodical
    could be rewritten with a typographer as subject, without changing the format.\r\n\r\nTake
    the <a href=\"http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/arts/movies/psycho-the-mother-of-all-horror-movies/article1776820/\">piece</a>
    in today's <em>Globe</em> about a new release of Psycho, with a \"newly reconstituted
    soundtrack\".\r\nOf course, the article doesn't tell you a damn thing about how
    the sound has been reconstituted! (That would indeed be mere technicality!)\r\nIt's
    just a plot spoiler, with a few Hitchcock tidbits and comments from name critics.\r\nThis
    kind of press-release coverage could be easily written about a type revival.\r\n\r\nEvery
    time one accesses a memory, one changes it, an act of subtle refreshment which
    explains the function of such articles in reaffirming the the cultural canon.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    Felicia Day doesn't have paparazzi following her. Should some latter-day Beatrice
    Warde succumb to the charms of a seducer, it's unlikely to make the gossip columns.
    I know, this sort of thing isn't what you meant. Yes, they can do human interest
    stories about Joe Typographer and the years he spent on a design and the music
    he likes. I can think of the Neutraface music video as something that made it
    to the radar screen in this way. And, of course, there's that Helvetica movie.
    Or the fact that a Papyrus joke made it to xkcd.\r\n\r\nGood luck, but like fish
    don't notice water, readers can't see the crystal goblet sitting in front of them...
    the perception, I fear, is that not enough people care about type to spend much
    time reading about type designers. It may be changing, but progress will be slow."
