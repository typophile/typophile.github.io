  a font\", and I know, that it's not a handmade font. \r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Sk\xE6rmbillede

    Try asking him, he may answer...

    be shocked ;) Kidding :) But you may be right. Thing is you posted this one twice
    and nobody identified it. Even Fivos' fantastic software '[[http://www.findmyfont.com|Find
    my Font]]' was defeated.\r\n<blockquote>Isn't Quaint made by James Lewis, by the

    are both credited on this font (check 'owners', top of the [[http://www.behance.net/gallery/Quaint/15535095|page]]).
    Both work for 'The Ligature Collective'."
