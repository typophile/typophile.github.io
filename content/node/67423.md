  body: "This is really fantastic. I particularly like the A, the R, and the Q.\r\n\r\nThe
    asymmetric curve on the D, R, 2 and 5 is great. Have you considered working that
    same curve into the tail on the 6, 9, the parentheses, and the ampersand? I think
    it would work in those characters.\r\n\r\nIt might be the small point size, but
    the top of the D doesn't look like it gets completely horizontal, unlike the R,
    2, or 5. \r\n\r\nThe middle of the S is too horizontal... it should be diagonal.\r\n\r\nI
    don't like the thin horizontals on the G and the J. The G could have an extra
    vertical going straight down in the lower right, or maybe just a square corner
    in the lower right. The J probably doesn't need a horizontal at all. \r\n\r\nThe
    W looks squished. Not sure how to fix that. \r\n\r\nOverall I think it's great.
    It's got a stencil, constructivist feel while being refreshing and different. "
