  body: RSS is a system that scans all the websites in a list you compile, and notifies
    you of new threads. You need an RSS reader, or MacOSX Tiger. Idon't know any more
    details, I just started using it with Typophile version 2. The downside is that
    for now it only warns of new threads, not additions in already existing threads,
    which is why my performance as a moderator/administrator is way down.
