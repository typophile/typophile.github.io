  anyone has this font could you send me a file containing a few letters, or an outline

  it so i can compare it to Sabon and Garamond fonts to analyse the few differences...\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe

    That includes Sabon, Sabon Next, and six different Garamonds (including ITC Garamond\u2026).\r\n\r\nYou
    can make the sample text any size you like. You can drag and drop the generated
    images (or left click \"Export Image\") to your desktop: they can be save in any
    image-based media format (bmp, jpeg, gif, etc.). You can't get at the outlines
    through the program, though.\r\n\r\nThe string will be wider than what appears
    in your preview window if the type is that big\u2026 so no matter what, you should
    get your whole string that way."

    on part of the forum at TypeCon this year.

  body: The typefaces. According to rumor you will be buying/licensing these new typefaces
    in a similar fashion to how it was done pre-desktop publishing -- ergo, by the
    letter/word -- and so I am assuming the license will stipulate that you cannot
    even share one glyph. I'm excited to see how they do it actually. It will surely
    shake things up in the display typeface world.

    using [[letterror]]'s [[lettersetter]] technology (i believe). These will be more

    several fonts. an interesting aside, i just put http://photolettering.com/ into

    what he is: a friend. For example it might say \"please let me know if you'd like
    modify the font\", or \"if you give the font to a service bureau to print your
    files, please ask them to delete it afterwards\". I know it sounds strange, but
    it makes more <cite>human</cite> sense than any form of EULA ever can.\r\n\r\nBut
    you don't just not have a EULA, because you need it to keep nasties (usually large
    corporations) at bay (even though the bigger lawyer army still wins). However,
    you also don't try to make it \"kind\" - that's hopeless. Conclusion? You make
    a second document, and one that simply <cite>communicates</cite>.\r\n\r\nI just
