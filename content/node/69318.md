body: I'm working on a custom script font in FL Studio and noticed that some of my
  lowercase composite characters had shifted in position slightly. Aren't these supposed
  to change their metrics whenever the parent character changes? I'm wondering if
  there is something I've accidentally done that caused this shift. Any ideas?

    the window. I took the regular e and moved the left sidebearing further away from
    the e in metrics mode. The sidebearings of \xE8 did not move, but when I did command
    z (mac) the sidebearing of \xE8 snapped in the same distance that my command z
    had undone. That's just weird! "

  body: I have a habit of checking the sidebearings of composite glyphs before finishing
    a font. Sometimes metrics changes to the parent glyph affect the composites and
    sometimes not. There's probably a pattern to it, but I haven't figured it out.

  body: "Just been trying some things out with it to try to see what works and what
    doesn't. \r\n\r\n- You need to be very careful about undoing after changing the
    left side metrics of a glyph that is used elsewhere as a composite. This is true
    in both the Metrics window and the Glyph window. If, say, you have \"O\" and \"Oacute\"
    and you change the \"O\" and then undo, the \"O\" part of the \"Oacute\" shifts,
    but the \"acute\" part doesn't. Consequently, if you go and fix the sidebearings
    of the \"Oacute\" the coordinates of the \"acute\" will be wrong.\r\n\r\n- If
    you do need to change the left sidebearings of a glyph used in composites, it's
    better to move the glyph in the Glyph window. That will move all the composites
    by the same amount.\r\n\r\n- A possible workaround: Write a Python script to reset
    the x coordinate of all child composites of a specified glyph to zero. Assuming
    this is possible, it should fix any composite shift errors caused by this undo
    bug. It seems like the \"Copy to composites\" pop-up below the glyph in the Metrics
    window is meant to do this (in part), but as James notes it seems to have its
    own problems. And, in fact, using that command has the same effect I described
    in the first note above, i.e., it shifts all composites, including ones that were
    okay where they were, such as accents."

  body: "Exactly what I saw in the metrics window, Mark. \r\n\r\nWhen I shifted the
    left sidebearing of the original nothing happened to the composite, but when I
    did an undo, the composite's left sidebearing shifted the same amount to the right
    even though it had not shifted the first time."

  body: what function are you using to build composites? if you're using the 'create
    glyphs if empty' feature or double-clicking on cells to get this function then
    yes, the aliases.dat file formatting is what controls the order of components
    of composite glyphs. however, if you're using a different method to derive composites,
    i cannot tell you what determines the component order.

  body: Copy to composites isn't reliable enough to be useful. Before kerning I generate
    rough composites. Then I delete all composites and generate them again just to
    make sure nothing went wrong.

  body: p.s. generating composites using the alias.dat file together with positioning
    anchors is fairly effective, especially if your character set is relatively small.
    Just make sure all the 'recipes' for composites are in the alias.dat file, set
    your anchors, and then use the 'create glyphs if empty' feature to generate composites.
    if your sidebearings become corrupted, it's not too hard to just trash your composite
    characters and regenerate them. unless you've moved on to kerning, you probably
    don't want to use this method to fix composite characters if you've already kerned
    them. in that case, use the 'copy [metrics] to composites' feature. that or use
    some fancy python scripting to refresh your glyphs.
