    thick & thin fonts at my fonts http://www.myfonts.com/search/tag%3A%22Thick+%26+Thin%22/fonts/\r\nMight
    be a match from a foundry that does not use Myfonts.\r\nBritannic is the closest
    so far \r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/BritannicMediumInUse_4486.gif]\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/britannic-lt/\r\nDon"

  body: I think URW PelionD Med might be close, the center bar on the E is too long
    but a logo might require messing.

  body: Right, Dick! Another one to credit to this "Times Sans Serif", latin counter-part
    of some non-latin fonts for foreign languages. Makes sense to see it often now
    you told some come bundled with iOS.
