  Paris \r\n(A group of French and non-French artists working in Paris in the first
  half of the 20th century). I want to use as a basic sans serif font. But the classic
  French \u201Cnational\u201D sans, that I know - Antique Olive, created later and
  I have doubts about the propriety of its use. On the other hand confuses me too
  \u201CGerman\u201D origin of the majority of old sans-serif fonts."

    inspired by the best of newspapers needs, renews taste for simple and tense shapes.
    Ardoise PTF and its 45 series could be considered as an homage to Antique Olive,
    but unexpectedly, result of longstanding admiration of the author devotes to Roger
    Excoffon. Ardoise, indeed, share purity and dynamics on its design that give it
    a unique elegance while showing excellent readability\"\r\n\r\n\r\nAnt\xF3nio\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    If you want that <em>\xC9cole de Paris</em> feel Cassandre is your friend. Think

  body: "Colleagues, thank you for your comments. It was very helpful to me.\r\nApparently
    French typography was partly outside the context of European modernism.\r\nClarify.
    My book is relevant to the theme of \"livre d'artiste\" (from Bonnard to Buffet),
    which focuses on bibliophilic tradition of the 19th century, as well as English
    and German \"private press\" of the early 20th century.\r\nIn contrast, I would
    like to give a real historical background of this era (the revolutionary unrest
    in Europe and two world wars!).\r\nI understand the idea of Nick Shinn.\r\nMany
    thanks to Maxim Zhukov. Your links and pictures to help me in finding a solution.\r\nNow.
    I am inspired by the work of 30-50's, which made for museums Max Bill for the
    Kunsthalle Basel (and other) and Willem Sandberg for Stedelijk Museum. They were
    contemporaries and friends many French artists. And they've done a lot of printed
    works for the exhibitions of these artists.\r\n\r\nP.S.\r\nI apologize for my
    English. I rarely write in this language"
