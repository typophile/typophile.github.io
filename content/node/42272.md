  MS as the main font. In both the Firefox and Windows browsers (in fact all we've
  tested) the bold version looks pretty bad. They don't give you a true bold font
  so you have to achieve it using the \"Bold\" style setting in Dreamweaver.\r\n\r\nAnyone
  out there have experience with this?\r\n\r\nI'm also trying to figure a way to set
  the font at a variable width but no luck.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance :)\r\n\r\n\r\nmolly"

    bold. Larger question, why Arial Unicode? It comes with Office (and Mac OS Leopard?)
    but not any version of Windows, and on top of that both Windows and Mac come with
    far better language-specific fonts in regular and bold. '

  body: 'Thanks for getting back to me about arial unicode--I like the way the regular
    unicode looks especially when there''s lots of text. I first saw it on the youtube
    site--it''s the text font they use and I thought it was pretty much available
    across all browsers. I don''t like verdana , geneva or myriad--can you suggest
    one you think is closer to unicode but a better screen font with a bold option?
    Thanks again for all your help--Molly   '

  body: I guess I'm very picky-I can see a difference between arial and arial unicode--The
    unicode has a more sophisticated look to it(except for the fake bold issue). I
    gues what I'll end up doing is setting most of my text in unicode and the bold
    text in arial bold--not perfect but I think as close as i'll get to it.

  body: "Interesting, the fonts are basically the same outlines for the western characters,
    but Arial has \u201Cbetter\u201D hinting. As you say, there's nothing to stop
    you specifying \"Arial Unicode MS, Arial\" in your code and specifying \"Arial
    Bold\" for any bold text "
