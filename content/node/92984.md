  biography however.  I really dont care where he was born or what his father did
  for a living.\r\n\r\nThanks all.\r\n\r\n"

  body: "You're in luck. Two books came out recently, both bilingual:\r\n- \"Roger
    Excoffon et la fonderie Olive\" by Chamaret, Gineste and Morlighem.\r\n- \"Roger
    Excoffon - Le gentleman de la typographie\" by David Rault (plus various contributors).\r\n\r\nThe
    second one (translated by moi) is more personal, so if you <em>have</em> to choose
    only one (why not get both?) I guess in your case go for the first. That said,
    the personal dimension is never really separable from the end-results; if one
    wants to find out what made Excoffon tick, and his work click, then it's useful
    to know things like how he treated his friends, the effects of his military service,
    and everything else.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    Masters thesis'.  Must be somebody who did one on Excoffon."
