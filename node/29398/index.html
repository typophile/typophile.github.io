  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Hey guys,

I know this has probably been posted a bunch on this site, but I'm needing a refresher and maybe I can give you a few new type [[foundries]] to look at as well.

I am looking for those small, nitche market type foundries that have that charm and excellence. Everyone knows about the following:

http://www.typography.com

http://www.myfonts.com

http://www.fonts.com

http://www.linotype.com

http://www.fontshop.com

But I'm looking for more sites like this:

http://www.typetrust.com

http://www.processtypefoundry.com

and

http://www.ascendercorp.com/portfolio_commercial.html

If you guys have any type foundries you know of or just those one off fonts that someone has created and is selling, but is a high-quality font, I'd love to archive it. Thanks for all the help.</div>

I am still looking for those places where you have a one-off font that is being sold but it is absolutely beautiful. The larger "companies" that sell the fonts are good too, but I'm looking for those gems. I'll be scrolling through the list on here and trying to find a few. 

Thanks again for all the comments so far.</div>

Beware; it's a 'clever' horizontal-scrolling thing. 

Keep in mind there's no standard way type gets sold. Some foundries sell only direct, some use one, or all distributors, some are collectives only, and most prolific type designers have work available from different sources. See Josh Darden and Christian Schwartz; both have fonts available at Village, but not the same ones as on their own sites... My stuff is all available at fonts.com but only because of reseller arrangements. Each design is from a different foundry. It's complicated. 

A better idea might be to catalog the gems themselves, and put the availability information second. I agree, there are some gems that don't get as much press as they should. </div>

the Prada of type houses is Hoefler-FJ:

the best free fonts are from Nick Curtis at

Make sure you check out the Dutch founderies, whose work is always impressive, if expensive: Lucasfonts, Gerard Unger, TEFF, DutchTypeLibrary, Typotheque, Ourfonts. 

Oh and don't overlook Jeremy Tankards wonderful stuff (http://www.Typography.net).

		<div class="commentbody">Sorry if this takes the thread off-topic somewhat, but I'm also looking around for foundries, to help me release a font I have in the queue. I had a nice email discussion with James Montalbano of <a href="http://terminaldesign.com">terminaldesign</a>, and he recommended setting up shop for myself, but I'm still thinking that I need an outfit that's set up to handle the commerce and deal with the routine day-to-day interactions with customers.

The font I'm hoping to release is a highly faithful digitization of an metal face from the first half of the 20th century. In keeping with the exclusive spirit of the original face, I have decided to price it very high (say $500), so to my mind that rules out options like myfonts. Of course I don't expect to sell many licenses at that price, but that's ok. The goal is to make the face available to those who are passionate about using it.

The foundry from the list above that seems to fit my needs most closely is <a href="http://vllg.com/">vllg</a>, but I sent in a query on their webform and it hasn't been returned. I don't know why not, but that's certainly not the experience I want customers to have.

I'm not sure whether I need a foundry per se, or more of a shop. I haven't tried to get in touch with the people from Veer or FontShop, but perhaps that would be a way to take care of the customer service side of things while maintaining my own brand (I like the "despotype" suggestion of Hrant, and may indeed take that up).

If you are the foundry I seek, feel free to get in touch. Any other ideas and suggestions are welcome.</div>

But apart from that, you need to incorporate, set up a website if only to show your work, and then join as many dealers as possible, starting with FontShop and MyFonts, where everybody surfs. But not if you insist on pricing that high--nobody will take you on, and why should they?

		<div class="commentbody">The cost of typeface licensing is meant to fund both the development of that typeface and the development of future typefaces. Like novels or albums, typefaces take months or years to create, and there is no guarantee that a typeface will sell enough to subsidise its creation. But a successful typeface will fund the design of other types, as well as (hopefully) paying rent, and in our case, server hosting, merchant bank fees, advertising, promotion...

Some foundries and distributors believe in quantity over quality: release enough stuff and some of it is bound to sell. Others, including Village, believe that quality is more important than quantity, and we know that our clientele continues to visit us due to the quality of the offerings from our small group.

With many apologies for the blatant self-promotion.

I would also add that while the bestselling books (Potter, Da Vinci Code) are recent works, the best selling fonts are old. Peyton Place, a work of similar vintage to Helvetica, ain't read much no more. If users stopped buying the old stuff, and if certain parties stopped bundling free fonts, then perhaps there would be a mass market for new fonts which would enable indie foundries to sell in sufficient quantity to lower their prices.

So, enjoy your classics and your bundled beauties, but please don't winge about font prices.

Anyway, the price of most bestselling fonts at Myfonts is $12 - $25, which is actually quite comparable to paperbacks.</div>

mondoB: I own many paperback books (although not as many as I used to - I donated about a thousand science fiction paperbacks to the library when I moved), and a select few prized, rare editions. If what you're trying to say is that all books should be cheap paperback editions because that suffices to get the words across, then allow me to respectfully disagree.

I think when you see the font and the history behind it, you will understand the logic behind my thinking. Perhaps nobody will take me up on it, but I suspect that there will be a few people who will appreciate what the font means and will pay for the privilege of being able to use it themselves.

		<div class="commentbody">My other concern about setting your initial price that high is that you will remain unknown and your fonts unused--is that the best payoff for your development efforts? Perfect example: Rialto, a three-font family that represents the finest Renaissance interpretation on the market today, comes from European designers with no website yet, and costs 580 euros via snail mail, so of course its progress in the marketplace is obstructed and slowed. With lower prices and better consumer access, they can compete with, say, Josh Darden, who offers Corundum, 12 fonts for $189, a really distinguished effort, among others on his site.

Regular half price sales, like DSType is now offering, are a great boon to us freelancers who work in, say, nonprofit, and need the sort of break that companies and agencies don't need.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Thanks for your concern, but I think it all depends on the font. Some of my designs I'm <a href="http://levien.com/type/myfonts/ofl.html">giving away</a> because of their value to the free software community, others I'll very likely sell at paperback prices, and this particular one strongly wishes to preserve its exclusivity.

In any case, I would imagine that a discount would be offered for nonprofits, as is common for less corporate foundries. If someone has a really, really good reason for using the type, then a way will be found to make that possible.

I encourage you to do this on your own, no reseller will understand your high-price strategy, and that font does deserve to be a luxury item. 

I'll say it again, it is up to all type designers to be fundamentally involved in managing their intellectual property. It is your future, and part of your retirement. Handing over that management to a long list of resellers begins the long slide to losing it all. 

Hell, the business side of type design is the really interesting part. After you sell a couple of enterprise licenses for some real money that you keep for yourself, you'll see how enjoyable it can really be.</div>

How can you be so sure? And what about DTL?

Plus James, I'm sure you can understand that some people:
1) are not good at selling.
2) find typeface design (especially at the forefront of text faces) much more interesting than selling type.

Yes, having and spending money is nominally great, but different people derive pleasure from a different complement of things. And one specific indication here is that Raph makes fonts to give away while you don't. We're all different, and that's the single best thing (it's not DTP or the Mac) about the current type business: you're not inescapably locked in with some large corporation - you can (hopefully) choose the scheme that suits your character.

		<div class="commentbody">James: thanks for jumping into this thread, as well as the deeper email discussion.

If it is true that no reseller will understand the pricing strategy, then that problem solves itself. However, I want to at least explore the possibilities. If there is a reseller that understands quality, and is not too greedy about ownership of the copyright, then I can imagine that being a good match for me. If not, then I will most likely follow your example, and no doubt be in touch with you to compare notes on what mistakes to avoid, etc.

James: why is it that you don't work through Veer and FontShop? Is it simply because you feel that you can do the marketing just as well and don't want to give up that cut of the total revenue, or is it a deeper issue?

I feel that the issue of giving away fonts is far from the original thread. I'm happy to have that discussion, but let's start a new thread for it, ok? One thing I will say briefly here is that the free font movement, such as it exists, is not about designers making charitable contributions of their work, but about participating in something new. For me, that new thing has as much to do with mathematics software (see <a href="http://ghilbert.org/">Ghilbert</a>) as graphics design.

Chester: I still haven't gotten an email from you. I don't mean to bug you, but could you send just a ping?

The best thing you could do for the Open Source Fonts effort would be to price your commercial offerings as high as possible (per your original post). What hampers the OSS community in this area is that the participants are considered a bunch of amateurs. By not selling your commercial stuff on the cheap you're working against that perception.

There are fonts of uniformly high quality with varying levels of complexity in both design and production. So there ought to be a range of prices in retail offerings. But I do agree with your point about pricing and the perception of open source fonts.

I prefer not to use resellers for many reasons, part economic, part historical, part emotional. Myfonts has the most modern royalty agreeemnt out there, the rest are stuck in an old manufacturing/publishing model. I don't care to participate in any of them at the present time. I do feel that the royalty rates that most distributors pay has contributed to the decline in font revenues for most type designers over the last 10 years.</div>

But not if you self publish. And the last 10 years have been Internet years, which has made that possible. Of course, there has been no survey of type designer income -- perhaps that's sopmething the TDC should do. Looking at the proliferation of online foundries, I would say that more and more people are making a living from retail font sales, and many of us are doing better than we were. I would also say that the typical 50/50 manufacturer retailer split is traditional for all kinds of retail businesses, pre-dating the Internet.
