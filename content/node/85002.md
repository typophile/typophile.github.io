  body: On second thought, it's not Cyclone. Looks like Alternate Gothic manually
    outlined.

  body: Don't think it's Alternate Gothic, the /R doesn't match at all. Even if it
    doesn't seems to be Cyclone (also because of the /R and outline effect is totally
    different, looks manual here), looks closer to me. I thought it could have [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/typetrust/heroic-condensed/|Heroic
    Condensed]], [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/canadatype/trump-gothic/|Trump Gothic]]
    or [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/mvbfonts/solano-gothic-mvb/|Solano Gothic]],
    they all have a closer /R but their /S look off to me...

  body: yes they lookalike but the S is still different not with a smooth flow as
    the MTV one.
