I updated via the program, so I can't give any direct advice about the normal installation process yet. If you delete the files and the program preferences in the library, and then reinstall, you might be clean.

		<div class="commentbody">Earlier this afternoon, I ran what I think was the most recent beta version (it's gone now, so I don't know exactly) and I got an announcement message saying that 1.0 was out and would I like to install it. Never had a problem with the live install before, so I clicked okay. After it downloaded and installed 1.0, it launched 1.0 and the rest is as I've described. 

It is possible it's something specific to my system. I was having some strange disk behavior which I fixed (or at least I think I fixed) this morning. It's possible it is related to that. But the previous version (whatever it was) was running fine after the disk repairs as far as I can tell. In other words, I did the upgrade after after having done the disk repairs.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Andreas, there is no FontExplorer X version for Windows yet. It will be available in a few more months.

The link of the right-hand side of the <a href="http://www.linotype.com/fontexplorerX">page</a> for "FontExplorer 2.1" is to the old <strong>FontExplorer</strong> (notice the lack of the "X" in the name) stand-alone database application that sorted through Linotype's fonts based on subjective criteria. That is still available for PC and OS 9, but it IS NOT <strong>FontExplorer X</strong>! <strong>FontExplorer X</strong> is the new free font manager from Linotype.

To repeat, FontExplorer X for Windows in coming soon. Just a few more months.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Deleting fonts from FontExplorerX deletes them from your hard drive?

I have been struggling along with Suitcase and am considering changing our computers at work over to FontX. I've done some experiments at home and am not totally satisfied (is there anything satisfying about OSX font management?) but am really tiring of Suitcase.

If the answer to the first question is yes, there's an obvious workaround that won't stop me, but I need to know in order to set it up correctly.

“coming soon on PC” info on the Linotype website was there for more than few months and now Dan is saying “a few more months”. I find it really misleading…I’d rather Linotype kept it secret that Windows version will be available or just say “expected to be released in 2007” or something like this….

Sorry I had to vent my frustration, I hate the elusive “soon” wording many companies use.

		<div class="commentbody">I was running FontExplorer during the Beta versions and gave it up because it took forever to render my fonts. Is this still a problem with the new X version for Mac. It really bothered me that when I just wanted to scroll through all my fonts one by one using the arrow keys, that sometimes with the larger families there would be a huge lag of time in between switching while it was rendering the face on screen. Maybe I will switch back if someone has some good news about that issue on this thread, otherwise its a no go for me.</div>

Fellas I tried updating mine too and had the same error, but when the mac asked me if I wanted to report the error - I did - and wrote my e-mail - and only 4 hours later I got an e from linotype ind germany - with a fix-it file... Jesus what a superservice - and for a free program too...

LOVE IT! SERVICE IS THE WAY TO SUCCES

		<div class="commentbody">I had the same database problem that Mark reported and was sent the same fix. 

Since there are a few people now reporting that issue, wouldn't it make sense for Linotype incorporate the database fixer into the installer? Or even better, have the installer just automatically do whatever the database fix is on installation?

Still, I love the program.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">This is a bit of a ressurection, but I'm having issues with FEX and the InDesign CS2 plug-in. It's causing random files to crash INDD upon launch. I believed that they were corrupt files somehow, but was informed by a friend that the auto activation plug-in prevented him from opening any files. This solved my problem. Who should I report this to? Is there anyone on the board that might lend an ear?</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I have the same issue with fex and indcs2. I tried contacting linotype support about it and they just gave me a new version of the plug-in, it didn't solve the problem. Turning off auto-activation didn't help. I've been working around this by closing fex whenever i open an indesign file. It's a huge pain. Lately, Indesign has been forcing fex to launch when I open one of the buggy files. I'm hoping to have our IT department do a clean install of indesign, fex, and my type library but I'd love to know if there's a real solution to this. </div>

That is a serious issue if you can't have your fonts working with InD and FEX. How else do you activate them when you are working on a file jackson if you have FEX closed?</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Two thoughts that might not help at all:

1) When was the last time you used the 'Tools' pull-down menu? There are some maintenance tools that could help. (Read the instructions first.)

2) When was the last time you deleted the font cache off of your machine? I recommend <a href="http://www.versiontracker.com/dyn/moreinfo/macosx/22795">Font Finagler</a>.

Maintaining the font collection is really important. You'd be surprised how easily it can become full of gunk. </div>

		<div class="commentbody">I would activate all my neccessary fonts before closing fex and opening the file. The scan for fonts feature is really nice. 

I usually keep on top of my font caches once a week. 

It turns out the problem was most likely indesign. We did a clean install this morning and everything runs fine now. 

Thanks everyone.</div>
