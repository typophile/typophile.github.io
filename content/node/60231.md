  body: "I agree about the \u2018T\u2019 but overall it looks more like Bembo than
    any Garamond. (If you say Garamond you should specify which one you mean exactly.
    There are so many.)"

  body: "I just looked at [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/adobe/bembo/|Bembo]] and
    I agree with Jan. I think the small white on black image loses something, but
    I think the T is right.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
