  body: I want to say some weight of Myriad, but I don&#39;t think that the B fits.  ITC
    Stone Sans is close too.

  body: Myriad BoldItalic is very close for the green part &#40;needs a few degrees
    of slanting&#41;.  <BR>And since Ryan made me think we&#39;re talking TWO fonts
    here -- the first part could well be Neue Helvetica BoldItalic, so I guess we&#39;re
    done now &#40;or someone might have more to say about this...&#41;. Cheers!

    transition.'

  body: The first part could be some weight of Arial... perhaps <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/agfa/arial/sfmt-bold-italic/testdrive.html?s=Urbal&amp;p=48"
    target="_blank">Arial Bold Italic</a>?  The B looks to be dead on.

  body: NAH. The illustration shows Arial BoldItalic for the first 3 letters and Myriad
    for the last 2 &#40;all in black outlines&#41;. No fit, yet.<img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/62953.gif"

  body: Wonderful, Adriano. Spot on, I think. A very typical and drastic difference
    between the &#34;original&#34; Frutiger BoldItalic and this one.
