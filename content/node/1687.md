  alt="Madeleine &#40;Mecanorma&#41;"> <BR>Found this in a Mecanorma catalog from
  1975. I&#39;ve seen it used &#40;The Donnas logo most recently&#41;, so it must
  exist as a font, but haven&#39;t found it. Tried using WhattaFont too, but no luck.
  <BR> <BR>Help much appreciated - love you guys!'

    target="_blank">http://www.thedonnas.com/htm/site.htm</a>&#41; and your sample
    aren&#39;t quite the same font.  The Donnas&#39; logo looks like an obliqued and
    bolded version of Octopuss:  <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/octopuss/octopuss/testdrive.html?s=the%2BDonnas&amp;p=72"
    target="_blank">http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/octopuss/octopuss/testdrive.html?s=the&#43;Donnas&amp;p=72</a>.  However,
    unfortunately, Octopuss is not the font of your sample &#40;see:  <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/octopuss/octopuss/testdrive.html?s=Madeleine&amp;p=72"
    target="_blank">http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/octopuss/octopuss/testdrive.html?s=Madeleine&amp;p=72</a>&#41;.  I
    was excited, because, at first, I thought Madeleine would be found with the Donnas
    and Octopuss  ... but she seems to be  somewhere else.'

  body: Octopuss does come very close. It did fool me in the Donnas logo at least
    <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif" ALT=":-&#41;" BORDER=0>
    But still, how I wish she could be found... Madeleine, with her more evenly weighted
    contours is a bit more to my own liking than the slightly rubbery &#34;quirkyness&#34;
    of an Octopuss. <BR> <BR>Seems strange to me that WhattaFont didn&#39;t even list
    Octopuss among the many suggestions it gave me. Well, you know what they say:&#34;The
    best font ID technologies can&#39;t match the eye of a typophile&#34;! <BR> <BR>Thanks
    for the help!

    copy, anyone? <BR> <BR>I believe this should be renamed ITC Overbite.
