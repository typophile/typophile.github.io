  Here</a>\r\n\r\n\r\n<strong>P</strong>erhaps I can elucidate...\r\n\r\n<strong>Sentence
  Capitals:</strong>\r\n\r\nBTW Forgive me if I am going over old ground - but would
  be interested if anyone else has investigated this (intentionally).\r\n\r\nWhen
  looking at set type, I quite often find, that the capital letter that starts the
  sentence in relation to the rest of a word is bold in appearance. Because I am not
  convinced this is necessary for set text I am investigating the idea of specially
  optically-balancing the capital letters to the weight of the following lowercase
  glyphs. \r\n\r\n<strong>History:</strong>\r\nThere is a precedent in having bolder
  capitals. This is clearly seen in Scotch Roman. Also - there might be (a remote
  chance) that there is some element of legacy suggesting this 'style' where capitals
  from an existing face were used with a slightly lighter lowercase set?\r\n\r\n<strong>Optical
  Consideration:</strong>\r\nI am aware that due to the nature of a capital letter
  having both a less complicated structure (they are more open due to their relative
  size to l/c) and elongated stroke-lengths naturally lightens its form which needs
  to be compensated. I would still expect Capital strokes to be thicker than lowercase
  however to a lesser degree than what is currently considered <em>'normal'</em>\r\n\r\n<strong>Process:</strong>\r\nCapitals
  tend to be designed with other capitals so the design ecosystem is not the same
  as real world use. i.e. I suggest that more consideration is given to how the capital
  'exists' with the lowercase rather than its CAPITAL glyph relatives.\r\n\r\n<strong>Problem:</strong>\r\nHowever
  - What seems to happen is that these lighter capitals that have been designed to
  work as an initial capital in a word don't look so good when set ALL CAPS.\r\n\r\n<strong>Natural
  compromise:</strong>\r\nSo what we see in fonts for the most part (but not Scotch
  Roman) is that a compromise has been allowed for so that the caps looks great when
  set ALL caps and OK when set with lowercase.\r\n\r\nMy thinking is that this balance
  can be readdressed so that the Capital letter designed to compliment with lowercase
  gets the priority styling consideration and that if necessary a secondary set of
  capitals for ALL CAPS can be supplied.\r\n\r\n  \r\nI hope soon to supply some 'proof
  of concept' but would welcome points of view and other examples by those who care
  to give this some consideration...\r\n\r\n/michael"

  body: "All caps: that would be in the OpenType \"titling\" feature. It's the original
    definition of the feature, and Adobe Garamond was the first digital face to implement
    it, c.1990. I don't know of any other faces that have separate titling capitals,
    offhand.\r\n\r\nBTW, Goudy's Kennerley (1911) was designed because he found the
    text colour of Caslon (IIRC) too spotty, due to its prominent capitals, or so
    he says in his book.\r\n\r\nI don't think it would be a good idea for the letter
    glyphs to change from normal caps when \"all caps\" is applied, that's not what
    people expect to happen.\r\nI mainly use that feature for changing to a set of
    figures that harmonizes with capitals, and raised punctuation.\r\n\r\n"

    I agree with Nick that a huge change would be disturbing.\r\n\r\nTitling may or
    may not be all caps, but is always intended for larger sizes. It's more of an
    optical size feature than an uppercase feature.\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\nT"

    Uniform \u2013 Medium with unadjusted Capital U\r\nBelow: Uniform \u2013 Medium
    with adjusted Capital U to compliment the lowercase.\r\n\r\n<strong>Opentype Implementation</strong>\r\n\r\nYes,
    I think what I am suggesting would be implemented by 'case' feature.\r\n\r\nFrom
    the user perspective this is best done with the 'case' feature accessed [InDesign]
    by 'Character' palette chosing 'All Caps' from the drop-down menu.\r\n\r\nThe
    result would change all the capitals to a slightly darker design where all the
    capitals work well together OR if the weight of the caps is fine just swapping
    out Capitals that were modified to get the harmonious result with the lowercase.\r\n\r\n<strong>In
    more detail the mechanics of the relationship of Capitals to lowercase and why
    I think Capitals become darker in the design process:</strong>\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/In_On_Sentance_Case_4602.png]\r\n\r\nAbove:
    Uniform \u2013 Light with unadjusted Capital I and O.\r\nBelow: Uniform \u2013
    Light with adjusted Capital I and O to compliment the lowercase.\r\n\r\nFrom my
    study and experimentation - I see that the 'capital O' has a different relationship
    to a string of lowercase letters than a 'Capital I'. If after adjusting (independently)
    the the weights of the O and I in relation to a lowercase string of letters I
    then  comparing them side by side again - it is seen that the I is lighter than
    the O. (See below)\r\n\r\n[Note for illustration below: I actually see that the
    I is lighter (more than I would expect) than the O in the original so I will have
    to repeat this with another font design to confirm my idea.]\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/UIO-Caps_6386.png]\r\n\r\nAbove:
    Uniform \u2013 Light with unadjusted Capital U, I and O.\r\nBelow: Uniform \u2013
    Light with adjusted Capital U, I and O to compliment the lowercase. Brought back
    together I expect to see irregularities in weighting across the Capital set of
    Glyphs.\r\n\r\nAs a designer - this doesn't seem logical and so the natural tendency
    is to darken up the I and then even perhaps further darken all the capitals so
    that they all look darker (and not just the straight ones). This is certainly
    a trap if your original intention is to have an even look to your set text.\r\n\r\nThis
    therefore suggests that a set of capitals exist within the font file that are
    presented when the user selects 'All Caps'.  The point being that if the user
    sets a title using the Shift key - the Title wont be either be optimised typographically
    (as is the normal use for 'All Caps'/'case' feature - as Nick mentioned) or aesthetically
    correct (my theory), as the letters presented by a Shift key action are in fact
    an extension of the lowercase and not true capitals...  but <strong>Sentence Capitals</strong>.\r\n\r\n"

    advantage of them.\r\n\r\nWe would all be interested in seeing figures or a breakdown
    in OpenType usage in sectors of publishing output. This is not something I personally
    see any benefit in doing and would be happy to work on my two assumptions above.\r\n\r\nRegarding
    an obscure feature not instantly understood even by OpenType guidelines - there
    maybe some users who would perhaps want to achieve such a typographic effect,
    but this as you allude to would at the cost of knowing to do something beyond
    what is usual practice and actually understanding the benefit of doing it.\r\n\r\nI
    am fully aware there might only be a user group of one that might demand such
    sensitivity, but that is all I would need to continue considering this. Though
    I am concerning myself with what is a very small avenue of innovation - it is
    an innovation nonetheless, and I see this along with other small innovations or
    ideas as the reason for my working on any font. I find it unnatural to accept
    the status quo over working though a concept or innovation.\r\n\r\nPerhaps after
    working out though investigation as to if there *is* any benefit of Sentance Capitals
    (as a concept) would I then work on the practicality (from a user perspective)
    if it generally might be accepted or used. Perhaps even to devising a strategy
    by which the user is rewarded by their extra effort?\r\n\r\nI really don't want
    to get bogged down in OpenType functionality or user scenarios though discussion
    so far has been enlightening and shown me what I was originally considering (Titling
    Alternatives) to be incorrect. [Thanks]\r\n\r\nIn this case, as you can see, the
    font itself does not lend itself to drop caps or All Caps anyhow. I see the default
    being Caps that work with  the lowercase. Another design/model - Different story.\r\n"

    of book design' alludes to the light weight nature of the capitals of Juliana
    (1958). Knowing that Juliana is firstly a book face I think that Sem Hartz had
    the sensitivity to look at the capitals as an extension of the lowercase and not
    a bolt-on necessity which so easily is the case when getting a typeface to market.
    \r\n\r\nAlso, the capitals in Juliana adopt appropriate width. Each letter seems
    to have a sense of them-selves. This is clearly seen with the capital letters
    E, F L and P.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Juliana_5691.png]\r\n\r\nLinotype

    With the Roman alphabet, the uppercase letters came first, and the lowercase letters
    became a bolt-on <em>convenience</em>. You have developed an elegant theory which
    solves a problem which doesn't seem to exist anywhere else but in <em>your</em>
    mind, and\u2014as Nick Shinn suggested with his question \"Have you researched

  body: "As I understand it, the history is somewhat different. The Roman caps came
    first, but the usual written caps for Latin don't seem to have been the Roman
    Imperial caps that we know from inscriptions, which are now held to have been
    first painted with a brush, then incised. They are broad and upright, whereas
    the Rustica hand is more slanted, with a different stress. The various Roman hands
    evolved through scribal use into something like our lower case, known as the Carolingian
    Minuscule. The Carolingian Minuscule was only married to the Imperial caps in
    the 15th century, at the time type came into being. Then the Carolingian Minuscule
    was made more upright and retrofitted with more symmetrical serifs, to match the
    Imperial caps more. \r\n\r\nIt is a perennial question how bold to make Caps.
    Historically, Jenson had taller caps and Griffo (as in Bembo) made them shorter
    to harmonize better with the lower case. But still remaining bolder. To maintain
    even color (apparent same density of black) with their larger size and different
    structure, the caps need to be bolder. So contrary to Michael, I don't think that
    there is a decisive argument for lighter caps to match the lower case. \r\n\r\nBut
    you can do it however you want, and if it works visually with a given design,
    it works. \r\n\r\nFor myself, I think that you never really overcome the fact
    that the Caps and lower case were originally different hands, and have quite different
    structures, except for a few letters. And the difference is used to mark the beginning
    of sentences and also proper names. In German also nouns. So my philosophy is
    not to try to minimize the differences between lower and upper case, but to use
    the contrast for the different purpose of the caps in relation to lower case.
    \r\n\r\nHowever, I recognize that there are lots of legitimate ways to deal with
    the issue. \r\n\r\nAs far as the design of the Caps, I think I remember reading
    Jonathan Hoefler arguing that more evenly wide caps work best to match the lower
    case, whereas varied width\u2014eg. Trajan works best in all caps. So that would
    argue for different designs for all caps. But this again seems to be more of a
    choice than a decisive argument. \r\n\r\nThe thing that does seem to be a stronger
    argument, in my view anyway, is that tighter spacing of Caps works best for harmony
    with lower case, and in all caps wider spacing looks best as a rule. This was
    traditionally taken care of in metal by spacing out all caps, and now by tracking
    out all caps in digital. It can also be done automatically through the \"cpsp\"
    feature in open type. However, it seems that in titles custom kerning is generally
    needed. There maybe you could do more to make the default better, but it seems
    that even size variation affects kerning, and that custom kerning is needed anyway
    for best looking titles.    \r\n\r\n       \r\n\r\n   "
