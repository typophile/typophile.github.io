  body: 'Fun! Here are some suggestions: <BR> <BR>- Darker drop shadow on the &#34;Reach...&#34;
    headline, so that the white type reads more easily against the lighter colors
    of the rainbow <BR> <BR>- Make &#34;Reach&#34; and &#34;Rainbow&#34; bigger, and
    tighten the leading of the headline. Consider using a dotless i in &#34;Rainbow.&#34;
    <BR> <BR>- At the bottom, I&#39;m not crazy about the relationship between the
    uppercase letters &#40;PRIL, P.M.&#41; and the old-style numbers. <BR> <BR>- Tie
    the top and bottom together by putting a yellow background behind the date/time
    info.'

  body: 'thanks Mark! <BR>for your suggestions: you&#39;re right, you&#39;re right,
    you&#39;re right and i dunno... <BR>I made all the changes you suggested, the
    only one i&#39;m unsure about is the yellow band at the bottom. This was my idea
    for the poster, but I didn&#39;t have a clear idea where i wanted the date, time,
    place info to go... i kinda toyed with the idea of putting some white clouds behind
    the arms at the bottom and placing blue text in the spaces in between the arms...
    but i didn&#39;t get that to work either... any other suggestions? <BR> <BR>here&#39;s

  body: 'I don&#39;t mind the yellow, but I see what you mean: the long straight border
    between yellow and the rest of the poster is kind of severe. What if you made
    the yellow/blue intersection more hand-drawn, in the same way that the arcs of
    rainbow aren&#39;t perfect?'

  body: 'I think that the main issue is the composition. too static.  You can try
    2 things - in order to tell a story with your poster: <BR>1. play with the angle
    of the rainbow - or <BR>2. play with the angle of the hands <BR> <BR>then and
    after that deal with the type'

  body: Paul my problem is every element has the same priority. If the hands are the
    most important visual element, try making the rainbow pastel to allow the hands
    to stand out.

  body: 'okay... i tried to take your &#40;collective&#41; advice to heart and so
    i made the hands smaller to give them less prominence and tried messing with the
    angles a bit. this gave me some space to put the info text in a better position
    &#40;i hope&#41;. what do you think of it now? <BR> <BR><!--attachment: ReachLTR2-67394.pdf*mime_pdf.gif*application/pdf*88.5*third+time%26%2339%3bs+a+charm%2e%2e%2e+%26%2340%3bi+hope%26%2341%3b*ReachLTR2%2epdf

  body: Much improved. The clouds make a nice holding area for the date/time info,
    and changing the angle/size of the hands makes the whole thing look more organic.
