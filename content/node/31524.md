body: "Long time listener, first time caller...\r\n\r\nI'm currently designing a travel
  guide for a small American city. When picking fonts, I needed faces that set nicely
  at smaller sizes in narrow columns. (The book is to be a trade paperback with two
  columns per page.)\r\n\r\nAt first, I was using Minion Pro (for body text) and various
  weights and widths of Myriad Pro (for headings, place names, addresses, operating
  hours, etc.). Minion is Minion: it gets the job done. Myriad was the surprise to
  me. Though I've rarely used it in the past, its condensed faces looked just right
  for a travel guide with the feel I was going for.\r\n\r\nA couple days in, I realized
  why it looked so \"right\": Lonely Planet uses Myriad everywhere. Duh.\r\n\r\nSo
  now I'm looking for a good workhorse, OpenType sans family with condensed and regular
  widths. Right now, I don't have a huge library that fits the bill. It'd be nice
  to expand my roster beyond the Myriads, Frutigers, Futuras, and Franklin Gothics.\r\n\r\nMy
  initial thoughts were to go for Verlag or Proxima Nova--probably because I'm looking
  for excuses to buy them, anyway--but I'd love to hear what you folks recommend.
  (And if, by chance, you have a favorite text serif with which to pair the sans,
  I'm all ears... er, eyes.)\r\n\r\nAlso, I'd welcome info on any Pi fonts useful
  in travel guides (e.g., map markings, symbols to signify that a hotel has a pool,
  etc.). Carta and Transit Pict seem like good places to start, but are there more
  out there?\r\n\r\nThanks so much in advance."

    only has a single (semi-condensed equiv.) width.\r\nBell Centennial is great if
    you have to go really very very small, as you might in marking minor streets and
    streams on a map."

  body: "Thanks, cuttlefish! I agree. Officina would be a good pick up, if it had
    multiple widths.\r\n\r\nBell Centennial is a great suggestion, especially--as
    you mention--for the extremely small sizes on maps. That's propbably a handy one
    to have around, whether I use it on this particular project or not."

  body: Thanks, Paul. You're right. It may not be right for this project (it's probably
    too playful for the content), but that's a very nice font. The  Pedestria Pict
    font cracks me up. If only I could find an excuse to put gigantic, man-eating
    butterflies in the travel guide...

    (And I have a feeling I'll be returning to <a href=\"http://www.nicksfonts.com/\">your
    site</a> when I'm in the market for some art deco faces. Great stuff.)\r\n\r\nThanks
