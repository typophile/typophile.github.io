body: "Our award-winning 'Tomate' is one of our best sellers and we have always felt
  it deserved to be expanded into a real type family.\r\n\r\nIn its 2 years of existence
  'Tomate' has been the typeface of choice in a large variety of packaging designs,
  where its friendly and joyful character plays an important role in making products
  attractive and sellable.\r\n\r\nToday we are introducing the 'Tomate family'; 4
  weights ranging from Light to Black, with improved contours and expanded kerning,
  plus and alternative 'g'.\r\n\r\nLast but not least, the price of individual weights
  has been lowered from $55 to $45. Enjoy!  \r\n\r\nThe Tomate type family can be
  purchased at www.re-type.com\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/tomatenewsletter5_4793.jpg]"
