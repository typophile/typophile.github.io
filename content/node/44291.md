  I love the variety of suggestions I get and it helps me to think out of the box.
  So ... I've been asked to help with an Interiors/Homes magazine redesign and we
  are looking for a font for the masthead as well as the headlines inside. The magazine
  is called Insite. Currently the masthead is set in OPTI aqueduct but it's now looking
  a bit dated and tired and heavy. We want something more timeless, elegant, contemporary
  and strong.  Headline and masthead fonts don't necessarily have to be the same.\r\n\r\nThanks
  in advance!!"
