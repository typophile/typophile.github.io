<p>the most memorable one were Gotham (around 300). Spend 15 minutes weighing the pro and con. Eventually (2 years later) friends pitch in and bought it for my birthday.</p>

I would never personally buy that font, but if it was appropriate to a job that was costing over $100,000 in print charges, etc., then perhaps a chargeback of that extent would be sensible.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d really have to be convinced that the $1000 package would be sufficiently more effective than a $200 alternative before making that decision, though.</p>

Because initially it was released for $1,500, but that was just a humorous promotion; it&rsquo;s now a reasonable <a href=http://www.houseind.com/fonts/luxuryfonts>$249</a>.</p>
<p>I have definitely been deterred by the high prices at <a href=http://www.dutchtypelibrary.nl/>DTL</a> and <a href=http://www.teff.nl/index-type.html>TEFF</a>. They definitely have some great typefaces, but there really isn&rsquo;t any way I could justify buying a single font for the same price (or more) as a <a href=http://vllg.com/KLIM/National/mudTyper+Weights/>full family</a>.</p>

<p>Oh yes, I really, really want [[http://www.teff.nl/fonts/renard/index.html|Enschedé&rsquo;s beautiful, fat Renard]], but €562 ($765 or £489.85) for a single variant is close to ridiculous. You can buy foundry type for that kind of money. I wish I too had friends.</p>

		<div class="commentbody">heh :) it&rsquo;s an unspoken rule within circle of designer friends. Every year we would group purchase fonts for birthdays and holidays. Every five years it&rsquo;s an adobe master package.
It takes out of lots of work on present guessing, and the receiver is always happy.</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Hi There:</p>
<p>Yes, of course! There are so many excellent typefaces and founderies that are currently out of my reach.</p>
<p>OurType, DTL, Font Bureau Studio Library, Teff and probably Typonine.</p>
<p>But I always try to cross-shop at different foundries to see who has the best quality and the best value for the genre/style I’m looking for. So I guess I really don’t have uninformed impulsive buys. I’m so tired of buying really cheap fonts that have lousy character sets and metrics!</p>
<p>Text faces for books is one category that seems to be growing exponentially each year. There is so much choice because there is so much competition. So if I have to save for it, it will a long time before I buy it.</p>
<p>Sometimes there’s a face with no satisfying analogues. Big Caslon Italic is one of those fonts. There’s nothing like it in the world. It’s a $100 a style. I’ve bought a few. If it was something else—no way!</p>
<p><img src="/images/old-images/Value_3976.png" alt=""></p>
<p>There is a recent thread on the University of Reading graduates in which I was planning on making a few comments on, but I will make them here. If you thought the concept of the “house style” died or only applies to oil and canvas then you would be wrong. Take a look at much of the output from University of Reading and KABK. Variations on themes (for Reading it seams to be the extremely syncopated and faceted text faces) and undeclared “homages” to their typographic heros (Veronika Burian and Underware must be annoyed)</p>
<p>But its not all bad tho&hellip; this gives us graphic designers options—options at different price points. I use this for instance.</p>
<p>Take a look at Greta:
<a href="http://www.typotheque.com/fonts/greta_text">http://www.typotheque.com/fonts/greta_text</a></p>
<p>Then take a look at Acon:
<a href="http://www.mysterywesterntheory.com/holger/index.php?/project/acon/">http://www.mysterywesterntheory.com/holger/index.php?/project/acon/</a></p>
<p>They just might (hopefully) be at different price points too (Acon, I assume is still in development). So if you need a Greta for books Acon maybe for you.</p>
<p>Price is isn’t the only thing that holds me back from the spur of the moment purchase—it’s licensing too:
