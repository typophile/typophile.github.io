body: "Hello typophiles,\r\nsince I'm new to these forums I'll start off with a little
  about me:\r\nI'm a Dutch Graphic Designer (recently Graduated) who's also into programming.\r\n\r\nRecently
  I've been working on a script font for display sizes, the working title of the font
  is 'Lasagna' (that was the first word I wrote in it). It's my first ever attempt
  at a complete font, so any help/critique is welcome to improve it.\r\nAt this point
  it's just shapes in Illustrator, but I like the way it's coming along and might
  ask someone to help me make it into a working font.\r\n\r\nAnyway, without further
  ado...\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/lasagna1_6478.gif]\r\n\r\nBecause
  of the lettershapes I had a large number of overlaps, wich meant a need for ligatures:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/lasagna2_4036.gif]\r\n\r\n\r\nthanks!"

  body: i really like this. its just the t letter can seem out of place at time like
    in didn't. you could get around this with ligatures of alternate characters once
    you make it a working font.

  body: "Thanks for looking.\r\n\r\nYes, I kinda have a love/hate relationship with
    that 't'. I feel like it's essential to the character of the font, but it also
    makes it a lot harder to get nice word-shapes. I'm dreading what will happen when
    I have to start making ligatures for vowels with diacritics followed by a 't'
    (\xE9t, \xEFt, etc.).\r\n\r\nThe seperate glyphs and ligatures thusfar.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/lasagna3_5815.gif]"

  body: "That \"s\" is unique, but it's also a major attention getter... look at me,
    I'm a random \"s\". It would be over kill for a word like assassin. Are you planning
    to do a more subtle alternative \"s\"? I think the \"f\" and \"z\" is also in
    a similar boats.\r\n\r\nAlso, the overall look reminds me more of a marker than
    a brush or nib. Is this intended, or did you not save the preview with anti-aliasing
    on. "

  body: "<em>the 's'</em> - yes, it's an attention grabber, although I think it works
    within most words, indeed a word like 'assassin' would be too much. I had already
    played around with a more 'normal' s-shape, but nothing definitive as of yet.\r\nI'm
    not really sure what you mean with it being a <em>random s</em>. It's random because
    it's a break from the norm? My idea behind it was a mix between a 'cursive s'
    and a 'long s' (that's why it sticks out above an below of the x-height).\r\n\r\nhere's
    an example of your 'assasin' in both the regular as wel as an alternate/normalized
    's':\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/lasagna_assasin_4341.gif]\r\n\r\n<em>more
    of a marker than a brush</em> - yes this was intentional, I didn't want to have
    too much contrast, so I opted for a oval brush, wich basicly gives the same effect
    as a marker. Although a marker would have even less contrast (imho)."

  body: "What I meant by random was that it was a random \"s\" in the flow of the
    word, whether it was at the beginning, middle or end of the word it would still
    be very pronounced, effectively blurring the word as a whole.\r\n\r\nIt's really
    all in how your eye scans a line of text. Most people rarely read entire words
    (that's why people can usually read this without problems: <a href=\"http://www.funny-potato.com/read-this.html\">
    Can You Read This? </a>)\r\n\r\nWith a unique \"s\" like yours it breaks up the
    flow of the eye as it tracks alone the text. It can be confusing to the reader,
    either appearing as if the word was actually several words smashed together, or
    it just slows the eyes down making reading laborious. \r\n\r\nDoes that make sense?\r\n\r\nI
    would recommend creating a more standard \"s\" shape that doesn't bring as much
    attention to itself and using the long \"s\" as your alternative, or in a display/swash
    version of your font. \r\n\r\nIt's a very unique character and I'm not dissuading
    you from using it, I just think a more suitable \"s\" would better, more effective
    and expected."
