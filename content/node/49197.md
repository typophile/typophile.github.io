body: "FDK\u2019s CompareFamily is blaming me for using underscores in glyphname extensions
  like in <code>zero.onum_pnum</code>. It interprets the glyphs as ligatures like
  a <code>f_l</code> glyph and it searches for the pnum glyph without any luck. Is
  it just FDK that is a little bit too sensitive here or does this affect decomposition
  behavior in Acrobat as well?\r\n\r\n"

  body: <code>zero.onum_pnum</code> is a fine name. Some CompareFamily tests may be
    too tailored to the glyph names we use at Adobe. Would be good to know exactly
    what's the message you're getting and which test is generating it, so that we
    can improve the algorithm to account for such glyph names. Thanks.

  body: "Thanks Miguel.\r\n\r\nThe warning is in the <code>Single Face Test 26: Glyph
    name checks</code> part and says:\r\n\r\n<code>Warning. Glyph name 'pnum' in ligature
    name 'zero.onum_pnum' is neither in the AGD, nor a 'uni' name, and can't be mapped
    to a Unicode value.</code>\r\n\r\nThe same message follows for all the other glyphs
    with the same kind of name extension. \r\n\r\nI'm running a rather verbose report
    with the following command:\r\n\r\n<code>comparefamily -rm -rn -rp -hint -l ../log/compareFamily.log</code>\r\n\r\n"

  body: This is a bug in CompareFamily - it shouldn't be applying the ligature checking
    logic to the glyph suffix. This fixed now in my version, fix will be available
    in the next AFDKO release, =do in a few weeks.
