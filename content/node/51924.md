  this one -- was planning on using it in a project of mine -- so any help will be
  much appreciated. Thanks in advance!"

    for similar fonts? That's the next best thing, I guess!

  body: "OK, I guess I'm done. I have searched the Script Font ID Guide, MyFonts and
    Veer, and I cannot find a match for this. To me, this seems obviously the work
    of a professional, and it is clearly a font, so the next supposition is that it
    may be a custom font. I think my two suggestions were the closest I could find
    stylistically.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
