  a challenge of my own:\u2002Can folks find examples of \"bad fonts\" (defined however
  you will) used effectively?\u2002Or beaten-to-death fonts used in new and interesting
  ways?\r\n\u2003And just to get them out of the way, I already know about [[http://bancomicsans.com/home.html|ban
  comic sans]] and [[http://www.iheartpapyrus.com|I \u2665 Papyrus]].\u2002I'm not
  looking for irony but for actual effective uses of these beasts.\r\n\r\n\u2014Joel"

    from MS here on the boards at all. It is only natural for him to remind us of
    how Comic Sans came about, and why. Vinny's brief certainly wasn't \"create a
    new typeface that will destroy western typography and civilization as we know
    it.\" Yet, sometime we treat it like that was exactly what some old guys in big
    suits around a table must have been thinking.\r\n\r\nSomeone needs to open up
    a reality check on the truth of the matter. Sii might be the one to do this over
    and over again. But only because someone else invariable feels like devoting a
    thread to the evils of Comic Sans every six months. or six weeks ;-)\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    way Vince defends himself, \"everyone talks about my type so it's the best in
    the world\", \"i dare you, i double dare you\"... reminds me of samuel jackson
    in pulp fiction. i mean, we are getting close to ridiculous on this one.\r\n\r\nI
    dont see, in Vince's comments, anything which support our field. telling every
    typographer here that comic sans is superior to everything they might create because
    people will talk about it for centuries is quite an insult, according to me- \"quantity
    wins over quality\". and that's exactly what he said, in another topic - by the
    way, i'm answering posts here, but i know it is not really the right thread to
    do so: i'm sorry.\r\n\r\ncheers,\r\ndr"

    It is casual and gives the feel of a written note but is much easier to read than
    my writing! I used it to indicate Pantone color specs, creep bleeds, or varnish
    KOs. It separated itself from the text of the piece enough to be clear that it
    was not part of the printed piece. The beauty is that everyone on earth has it
    so you know it will show up. It has its uses for others but can also be abused
    by those who wouldn't be able to do a decent job with any type either. It has
    been bashed so many times that you wonder why some people just can't let it go.
    Of course I bash Bush all the time without mercy so maybe I am just as guilty
    so I will shut up before I start in on him again.\r\n\r\nChrisL"
