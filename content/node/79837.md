body: "Im trying to complete the opentype features of one of my fonts and when I  compile
  the error message...\r\n\r\n\r\n[FATAL] <fontname_0_wt> invalid token (text was
  \"\u0192\") [/Users/myname/Library/Application Support/FontLab/Studio 5/Features/fontlab.fea
  36]\r\n\r\n... comes up. For the past couple of hours I have tried to fix it but
  to no avail. And of course, if I cant compile my opentype features, but font is
  pretty much useless. I might not be able to figure it out just be because I'm a
  beginner at opentype font coding and scripting but any help would be great! \r\n\r\nThanks."

    the name of the character (probably florin)?

  body: "I went to it (through the directions the error message gave me) and didn't
    really find anything. \r\n\r\nBut then I went into the feature file and found
    the character \u0192 and replaced it with \"Florin\" (the name of the character).
    Is there a way to save the file as a .fea now though? I opened it in Textedit
    on my Mac. I cant figure out a way to save the changes I did to the .fea file
    outside of Fontlab and I cant find the error string in Fontlab, so I'm a bit confused
    on what to do now. \r\n\r\n"

  body: "In the OpenType panel, you can \"Open features\" and \"Save features\" .fea
    files using the little flyout menu in the corner of the OpenType panel of FontLab
    Studio. Also, if you place a .fea file such as <code>MyFont.fea</code> in <code>/Users/myname/Library/Application
    Support/FontLab/Studio 5/Features/</code> , then in the lower-part of the OpenType
    panel you can write just one line: \r\n\r\n<code>include(MyFont.fea);</code>\r\n\r\n(with
    the rest of the OpenType panel, and perhaps also the Classes panel empty). \r\n\r\nThis
    will link the OpenType panel to the external .fea file. This way, you do not need
    to edit the feature definitions in the OpenType panel, but instead, you can use
    the external file. This may have the advantage that you can use one and the same
    .fea file for multiple fonts. \r\n\r\nNote that in this case, it's best not to
    include the \"kern\" feature in this external file. Instead, you should have the
    kerning defined in the Metrics Window, and have the Preference option \"Generate
    OpenType & TrueType / Kerning / Generate OpenType 'kern' feature if it is undefined
    or outdated\" enabled. \r\n\r\nBest,\r\nAdam\r\n"

    with a .fea extension, then read it in via the FL > OenType panel.\r\n\r\nI have
    a separate features file for every font, and it (eventually) includes kerning.
    Edit it as you need, and save it. On the same flyout panel, there is also something
    like \"Import Features,\" or \"Open Features.\" That will let you read in the
    external features file you've created with the text editor. Then compile.\r\n\r\nI
    do have a \"basic\" features file I start with, created with a text editor. But
    different fonts have different details, so I don't put it in the library, or use
    a link to an external file -- I read it in through that OT panel flyout."
