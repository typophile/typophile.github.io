  body: "Hello, JanekZ!\r\n\r\nBe careful with consistency in managing the paragraphs.
    Use either indented paragraphs, or split all paragraphs with a line space. On
    your page you have three different paragraphs: indented, separated by a line space,
    and that final \"Enjoy...\", not indented and not separated.\r\n\r\nAlso try centering
    the \"Preface\" and the folio on the text box, not on the page - it might look
    better.\r\n\r\nOtherwise the justification looks quite good. Try showing us a
    page spread."

  body: "Thanks Sebastian!\r\nI begun this book in QuarkXPress 3.1, and some elements
    are more than 10 years old (and untouched...). I'll change title and pagina, you
    are right.\r\nI'm curious if you like this Sans? \r\nJanek"

  body: The text seems really heavy, dark, and probably too big. Try printing this
    out and comparing it to another book. I think the letters are just huge (it's
    hard to tell on screen) and when you print it, it will look really funny to have
    such huge copy.

  body: "I agree that the text seem heavy, dark, and even a bit awkward. Maybe cosmos
    isn't so good for books. I wonder if the average reader would get distracted by
    the design of the typeface? \r\n\r\nThe text box is OK although it seems like
    the top and bottom margins are nearly equal and the right margin could be a bit
    more generous. \r\n\r\nThat grey bar at the top is sort of clunky. Really, you
    have 3 important elements on a page like this -- the text box, the header and
    the folio. You can work these 3 elements to make something quite nice. The grey
    bar is superfluous. As it is, I see something rather default, ie: folio goes in
    the centre at the bottom. You could try something else.\r\n\r\nAs a guide book
    I imagine the other pages are a lot more complex and will require fine attention
    to the typographic details. Have you worked on the hardest pages of the book yet?\r\n\r\nI
    love climbing, mountaineering and wilderness guide books. Unfortunately they are
    almost all quite horrible to read. So please make a nice one!\r\n\r\nMore on Cosmos:
    I looked again and I don't think its up for the task. Does it have small caps,
    and non-lining numerals?\r\n\r\nAt the very least you've made me want to visit
    Kazalnica."

    > \"That grey bar at the top is sort of clunky.\" I need something distinct as
