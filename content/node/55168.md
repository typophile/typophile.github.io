  etc., I assume they are positioned to work best with figures and figure height--hence
  I position them to align with numerators. But what of the ords? are they positioned
  vertically in the same place or with the superior figures?\r\n\r\nChrisL"

    <a href=\"http://blogs.adobe.com/typblography/2006/07/confused_by_a_a.html\">Confused
    by \"a\" and \"o\" ordinals?</a> and I am still confused.\r\nI understand that
    the ords are used in Spanish and Portuguese in a similar manner as English ordinals
    but I still have questions about the vertical positioning.\r\n\r\nChrisL"

  body: "Just use something that looks okay visually in your font.  This is like asking
    if the acute accents should be more vertical or horizontal or if the dot of the
    umlaut should be in line with the i.  The answer is Yes and No at the same time
    :)\r\n\r\nSpanish also uses -er and, much less commonly, -os and -as.  There was
    a thread back a while ago asking if there was a way to automagically figure this
    out and the result was that for some languages like Russian it's impossible because
    of declensions.\r\n\r\nIn my current text font I'm placing all ordinals the same,
    but with a slight underline.  In Spanish this is quite common and (almost) expected.
    \ In English and other languages it's not a bother.  There's another set of superiors
    ('script') to go with the math set.  But that's just one solution among many.\r\n\r\n<em>\xABEl

  body: "Nick, that's a good question.  In all caps situations, roman numerals are
    generally used which avoids the question, and in dates ordinals aren't used at
    all.\r\n\r\nIn older times in such situations, I see it put in all (small raised)
    caps or with a large tilde with small caps.  I think if someone abbreviated Mar\xEDa
    as M.A with a small cap A with tilde (which is hypothetical, I've never seen it
    that way), they'd be quite confused, ditto for HRMNOS with a (single long) tilde
    over the small capped (baseline) rmnos.\r\n\r\nIn modern day applications I generally
    it's not uncommon to see the lowercase used if another avoidance technique isn't
    used.  If perchance your small cap and numerators have a similar or same height
    / weight, that might be a good option.\r\n\r\n<em>\xABEl futuro es una l\xEDnea

  body: "Well, once I say it's not going to be used too much I'm of course going to
    find examples.\r\n\r\nI found one today at a restaurant, a printed announcement
    from 1777.  It had a few typographic niceties that I'll post later in the general
    forum, but of interest here, the abbreviations for an all caps line were done
    also in all caps, raised to match caps-line.  They  appeared to be either small
    caps or the next size down caps for the type face.  In any case, that probably
    will work best.  Take your small caps and instead of aligning them to the baseline,
    pop them up to align their caps height with that of your normal caps.  Will post
    the picture when i get it (friend had the higher quality camera so gotta wait
    for him to e-mail it to me)\r\n\r\n<em>\xABEl futuro es una l\xEDnea tan fina
