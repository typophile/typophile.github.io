  body: "The band <a href=\"http://www.cakemusic.com/\">Cake</a> uses Copperplate
    Gothic Bold in all caps.\r\n\r\nWhereas I would bet lots of logos do make use
    of Copperplate, I'm not sure who would use Curlz for their logo. Hairdressers?\r\n\r\nI'm
    curious about the juxtaposition of Copperplate and Curlz in a single question.
    Is it just because they are both widely available bundled fonts that start with
    C, or is there more to this?"
