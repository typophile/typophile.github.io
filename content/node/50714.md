  is a non profit organization with the main goal to publish a web portal which would
  gather health/medical bloggers from all over the world and do some research.\r\n\r\nI
  tried a lot of things and then I settle for three things.\r\n\r\n1. Health - cross\r\n2.
  observatory - binoculars\r\n3. web portal - computer, arcade type font\r\n\r\nIs
  this worth anything? Does anything show potential? \r\nI am not a professional designer,
  so I would really appreciate your advice.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/logo_3559.png]"

    a 'arcade/computer' style face.\r\n\r\nAs for the mark - I would try to work this
    concept out on paper first and stay away from the computer until you are ready
    to implement."

  body: "I understand your thinking behind this. There are two problems for me. Firstly
    I think the red and white and the cross symbol represent first aid rather than
    a wide range of medicine and health. Also the \"computer, arcade type font\" is
    from a much earlier age of computers than blogging, and its fuzzy edges don't
    help. Look for something bolder, clearer and more up-to-date.\r\nI would get rid
    of the cross but keep the binocular form. Try a warm, vibrant green or orange
    rather than red to look healthy and lively, and make it smaller if you are going
    to keep it to the side of the lettering.\r\n\r\n"

  body: "In my opinion, you're approaching this design way too literally. The concept
    for the blog isn't visually congruent and to try and create a visual image to
    go along with the blog is honestly, out of your skill range. Not to offend.\r\n\r\nI
    think you'd have better luck creating a clean logotype and matching it with health
    related images (stock photography perhaps) in the banner of the site.\r\n\r\nAlso,
    to reiterate what Jay said earlier, avoid the \"computer/arcade\" type. It's a
    poor concept to assume that if you're creating a logotype for a website it has
    to look \"techy or futuristic\". Personally, I'd use a friendly slab serif typeface
    like Soho, Archer, Zine Serif or Officina Serif. Any of these fonts would bring
    a confident look without seeming too cold or tiresome. "

    such a logo and not pay a fortune?<strong>\r\nThis is a non profit organization,

    you have been so very helpful I would like to ask you one more thing. I was looking
    a little bit on the net about logo design and prices. The first sites that come
    up in Google are these firms that offer logo design for like 150-300 dollars.
    Most of them have pretty ugly websites and portfolios, but this one doesn't look
    bad > http://www.logoworks.com/\r\n\r\nDo you think this is worth it? Is there
    any better solution for this price range? \r\nOr is it just plain stupid to expect
    any quality for such small amount of money? \r\n\r\nThanks again."

    sites. They might be great, they might not.\r\n\r\nI will say, if you're expecting
    this website to be accepted globally, I would assume you have a pretty talented
    web designer. One that would design a site that's both easy to use, navigate,
    translate multi-culturally and still be appealing aesthetically. Why not have
    them create the logo for the site as well? If you don't have a web designer, then
    I'd say you'll need to revisit your priorities, because a logo comes much later
    in the process."

    turned them back again and we can continue this game forever.\r\n\r\nHow much
    is a logo worth for me? 10 000 dollars? Which I don't have.\r\nThere are other
    things to take in consideration apart from the clients opinion of how much something
    is worth. There is of course the designer, his work, how good he is. There is
    also the market, the competition, other designers. \r\nI am not stupid. I do realize
    that a job like this could cost from 100 to 100 000 dollars.\r\nI saw this logo
    factories online offering work from 100 to 1000 dollars. This is what I liked
    about them, that they had some prices out there so I had some idea. OK they maybe
    bad, but still they are transparent. \r\n\r\nThat is why I asked you if it would
    be better to spend 300 dollars on these guys or if for this money I could find
    a better solution. Yes or NO, simple answer, no hard feelings.\r\n\r\nThese games
    with hiding prices and all the mystery remind me of the markets in Turkey and
    Tunis. Nobody has a prices on anything and they ask the same questions. So they
    sell you something for 10 dollars, then the same thing for 100 dollars to somebody
    else. \r\n\r\nI would like to know the price, or at least some price range, so
    I can see what I can afford and also so I don't offend anybody by approaching
    and saying dude here is a 100 bucks. \r\n\r\nFor example Paul tell me how much
    would you ask to design a logo (only a logo) for the project I described. \r\n

    relative factors for legitimate NFPs or NGOs.\r\n\r\nAnd continuing about relativity...
    - i.e, how much value is placed on the project, it's an image and identity - a
    face - for the organisation.\r\nThen you need to factor in things like; research
    (there always should be if the project is of any value to the business - the designer
    needs to get up to speed with the company, service/s, structure, audience & visual
    language, and competition etc. to understand it.) then ... project timing; specific

    for the creative's/designer's time as a creative/visual thinker and designer -
    if you think that time is worth $100 you'll get a $100 result - because you will
    get A result. No doubt about it. Having said that, if you value a designers time
    at $100 ... you won't have any choice but to be happy with whatever the results
    are. Clipart with a font might work ... who knows.\r\n\r\nI'll refer you to the

  body: "I believe the reason logo prices vary so dramatically is about process and
    measuring outcomes.\r\n\r\nSome designers spend quite a bit of time doing visual
    research, sketching, research on the company, competitors, etc. to get a good
    idea of what the business is before trying to portray it visually. This is how
    major corporations do things.\r\n\r\nMost often, a logo is not enough. You need
    business papers (letterhead, business card), and a style guide on how to implement
    the new look on other materials. Otherwise, you have a nice logo implemented badly,
    making the whole process moot.\r\nSo, its hard to just quote for a logo.\r\n\r\nOther
    designers just draw whatever they think might work on the computer, and it takes
    an hour.\r\nThere are no restrictions to who calls themselves a designer, or what
    the process of designing a logo entails.\r\n\r\nAnother issue is very few designers
    try to measure the outcome of their success, so you can't tell if it is successful.\r\n\r\n"

    An Observatory is a place where you go to observe or look. How do we look/see?
    With our eyes. \r\n\r\nI believe that the cross/plus sign is a good representation
    of health.\r\n\r\nAs others have shared I think that your attention to the online
    nature of this company to dictate your typeface choice was incorrect. This company
    may start out as a blog, but evolve into an organization that may need printed
    collateral so the typeface should be universal, legible and still clearly state
    the name of the organization.\r\n\r\nI would steer clear of the websites that
    offer cheap logo solutions. They often have a vast library where they just pull
    a medical related logo and type and then turn it back to you. Your friends company
    may end up with an identical logo for some other organization that they do not
    want to associated with.\r\n\r\nSince your client is pro-bono and I am a student,

    Or perhaps you use constellation / star chart in your supporting elements, and
    keep the logo typographic. \r\n\r\nLogo Cost:\r\n\r\nConsider two types of logo
    clients I've encountered: one will love whatever I do and sign off on the first
    concept, others want 20 versions and then want to build a logo blending them all.
    If you are client one and agree to pay hourly, you might be in for a cheap(er)
    logo. The other, not so much. For a fixed-price estimate I will split the difference
    and include an hour maximum to save me from client #2. For a small/new business

    questions. Kind of like a survey of health bloggers by helath bloggers. We would
    also follow news about health blogs and any research related to them and post
    them on our blog.\r\nFinally, we want to start the best and most comprehensive
    directory of health blogs from across the globe.\r\n\r\nBasically, we want to
    help in the better utilization of blogs for the enhancement of teaching and learning

    we are sure health bloggers will be very supportive of this initiative and I expect
