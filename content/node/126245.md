body: "Hello All!\r\nI'm looking for some suggestions for typefaces for a hotel project
  I'm working on. It is an Austrian inspired \"Chalet\" style hotel in Jackson Hole,
  Wyoming. \r\nI was looking for quality blackletter fonts, that were friendly as
  opposed to \"black\" -- Something like the lettering used for the Disneyland logo.\r\nI'm
  also trying to avoid a kitschy feel and want it to be classic and refined. A body
  text I was eyeballing was Warnock Pro by Adobe.\r\n\r\nI would love any insight
  into typographic inspiration for the \"chalet style\" --- i.e. \"Swiss Miss,\" Cuckoo
  Clocks, Sound of Music, Etc... without being, as I mentioned, Kitschy...\r\n\r\nThanks
  for any advice!\r\n"

    but it is supposed to be that way. A typical way to do signage would be to use
    a soldering iron on wood, which gives technical constraints that even high-class
    alps resorts somehow appreciate. \r\nGood luck from Austria! "
