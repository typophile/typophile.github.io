body: "When searching the web for information about U+01FA, I have found here a topic
  where John Hudson explained that [[Aringacute]] is a Danish character and thus should
  be normally present in a well-designed Western font despite of the problems with
  vertical spacing it causes.\r\n\r\nNow the question: so, how should I design this
  character, if increasing vertical font metrics is heavily undesired? Would it be
  possible, for example, to put the acute next to the ring rather than above it? Also,
  does anybody know, what this letter might look like in the traditional Danish typography?"

    my neighbour-country. My believe is that it is an old standard (but could of course
    be wrong).\r\nAnyway, I did it like this and have seen similar solutions. In this
    case I made the acute alittle bit smaller trying to avoid that the diacritic gets
    to heavy. When I look at it now, it seems as if the acute maybe needs to be placed
    a little bit higher up...\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/aruingacute_3581.png]"

  body: "As I understand it, the acute accented A ring may occur in grammars, dictionaries
    and other linguistic texts, perhaps also in some poetry. Any Danish vowel can
    be marked for stress with the acute accent, and since the A ring is an independent
    vowel it can take the acute.\r\n\r\nThis is what I have gathered from past discussions
    on this topic: The acute should always be above the ring, not beside it. Above
    the uppercase A, the ring can be lowered slightly, but it is preferred if it does
    not merge with the top of the letter. Both accents can be made slightly smaller
    and more vertically compressed than their normal forms, but not so as to look
    squashed. In the lowercase, the ring may be lowered slightly, but since there
    is usually enough vertical space for both marks they should not be otherwise modified.\r\n\r\nGenerally
    speaking, merging diacritic marks is a bad idea, because this creates new forms
    that interrupt reading while we decipher them. It is better for the marks to be
    distinct and with enough space between them for both to be clearly identifiable.
    This is a general rule for pretty much all writing systems, especially those that
    use a heavy number of diacritic marks and combinations of marks (e.g. Biblical
    Hebrew or Qur'anic Arabic)."

    check things like that (and it gets worst at 16pts -- and with fonts with an acute
    that raises much above the ascent line)...  There are people that use Word, but
    maybe none that will ever use a Aringacute, hard to know.  I did not check with
    inDesign, I don't have it; if I had, I would have checked from 10 to 48 points,
    just to see. With TeXShop the editor shows everything ok, and I will not add \"of
    course\"."

  body: "It's not just Word. A lot of the Mac apps do similar things with clipping,
    which I observed when testing Inconsolata.\r\n\r\nI think the answer is that you
    can set the height metrics so that ascender + descender + line gap define an expanded
    bounding box greater than the usual 1000 em units (I've seen 1200 bandied about,
    but a typical line gap is 90, or at least that's the default in FontForge, so
    1090 might be the target to shoot for).\r\n\r\nThing is, I don't know exactly
    _how_ to specify these in OpenType values so that apps recognize them. The rules
    seem to have changed, especially since the days of Type1. I would like to get
    to the bottom of it, but don't have time to do a research project of trying various
    height metrics settings with lots of apps.\r\n"

  body: "When it comes to this type of thing, and for text fonts in particular, what's
    worse, clipping on screen (should print fine) or crashing of the marks and base
    character together, which looks bad on screen and in print? In general I'd vote
    for clipping.\r\n\r\nFot a UI font, where on screen legibility is the most important
    aspect of the design, crashing may be the best option, or as I've seen done on
    mobile devices the base character is shorter to accomodate the two marks (these
    tend to be one-off precomposed characters).\r\n\r\nIn Word increasing the leading
    should solve the problem on-screen."

    only if you use 'exact' leading values. If you use a multiple of the default linespacing,
    e.g. 1.5, you may still get clipping at some type sizes.\r\n\r\nThe Word clipping
    issue is related to their interpretation of VDMX table data, which means that
    there isn't an obvious way to correct it in font metrics: the clipping may occur
    at some sizes even if the OS/2 table win metrics are sufficiently large to clear
    the tallest glyphs in the font."

  body: "Aringacute is not used in Danish. You can not stress an \xC5 with an extra
    accent in Danish. The \xC5 an \xE5 characters are themselves a rather new invention
    in Danish spelling. They were implemented in a post WWII reform of Danish spelling
    in 1948, in part to distance Danish from German influences as Germany, Germans
    and German was very much out of vogue. So Hudson's claim that it's an archaic
    \ Danish form is not correct."
