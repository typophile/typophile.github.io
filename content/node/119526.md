  body: But a look at fonts used in Acrobat shows they used Garamond and Monotype
    Grotesque for the flyer - we have had the ink saving discussion here before and
    with most text fonts the toner use is pretty uniform.

    even rumored that he didn't change toner cartridges a single time during his entire
    lifetime), but everyone knows that Jannon didn't share this attitude since he
    got kickbacks from the manufacturers. I declare the plan a failure.\r\n\r\nAndr\xE9"

  body: And to really save toner do not use, rules, bars, logos, line art, halftones,
    or any graphic elements. The GSA announcement has a square logo with GSA rerversed
    out = that more than offsets any saving from font selection. The idea that you
    can save with just proper font selection is silly. On the onther hand cutting
    color printing and duplexing will save money and paper.

    Fonts Can Save Millions</a> (March 8, 2013) is still working and according to
    it those fonts can save up to 30 percent over Arial.  One of the three GSA approved
    fonts is Century Gothic. And  in the  Wiki article on <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Century_Gothic\">Century
    Gothic</a>, it is written that the University of Wisconsin-Green Bay has found
    that Century Gothic uses about 30% less ink than Arial, but that the font uses
    more paper so that the savings are offset by increase in paper costs. The reference
    is a newspaper clip. I could find no serious reference and no quantitative analysis
    whatsoever.\r\n\r\nPS Here are Arial and Garamond at the same point size. And
    when you are told to use Word  at 11 points, you do so, even in the academic world.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/arial-garamond_4492.png]\r\n\r\nThe

  body: Yes. GSA prescribes those three fonts to be set in 11 points. Pretty ridiculous.
    Saving to the extend of being obsessive would be using circled bullets instead
    of black dot bullets ...

    point size (since that value is to be 11 points), and without condensing the font,
    there are two obvious parameters left: x-height, and contrast.\r\n\r\nObviously,
    a sans with low contrast wastes more ink than a contrasted font where  strokes
    are thinned here and there. Less obviously for the layman, but probably more significant,
    is the effect of the x-height. Here are Arial (large x-height, low contrast),
    Times New Roman (medium x-height, medium contrast) and Mona Lisa Solid ITC (small
    x height, high contrast) all at the same point size.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"/files/parameters_4796.png\"

    the right objective function (the thing you want to optimize); that can't just
    be the amount of ink.\r\n\r\nAnd I did not even consider an additional parameter:
    hinting. Is it not possible to make a truetype font that is good to read on screen
    and that saves ink when printed (especially if all the reports end in drawers
    anyway).\r\n"
