body: Hi! Can anyone help me identify this one? It looks so very familiar, but I can't
  put a name on it (it isn't Bello). The sample isn't great, but if you can see the
  rest of the typefaces, I wouldn't mind having them identified too. Thanks!

    \r\n\r\nBTW, don\u2019t forget <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/alan_meeks/kestrel_script_ot/?&fg=000000&bg=ffffff&sample_size=48&sample_text=Fixed%20Barcelona&ft=liga\">Kestrel

  body: "hhp: \"Ballpark Weiner is almost certainly an illegal clone of Falkner Pro\"...\r\n\r\nCertainly
    NOT.  Of Ballpark Weiner and Falkner Pro, the most recent is Falkner Pro. \r\n\r\nRalph
    Unger says that Falkner pro is based on Alan Meeks' Kestrel, and has a release
    date of 2011. Ballpark Weiner was around before 2005 that I know of. Mickey Rossi
    said that he used an original Letraset rub-on sheet (or maybe a catalog) to work
    from.\r\n\r\nIn fact, your reference to Rossi's \"Satans Minions\" (pre 2005)
    \ and Nick Curtis' \"Shiver Me Timbers\" (Version 1, 2006) fails the same antedating
    test. These two fonts are completely different.\r\n\r\n - Herb"

  body: I guess the one on which Ballpark Weiner and Falkner Pro were based is just
    a pre-digital version of Kestrel. So Kestrel is original. I think Ballpark Weiner
    and Falkner Pro are knock-offs.

    Akira that it isn\u2019t crafted very well, though."

    I'm not so sure about Satans Minions, since MyFonts dates aren't always reliable.
    Also, saying they're completely different is certainly very peculiar.\r\n\r\nBUT:
    Please don't recommend an inferior free font nonetheless.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    too. \r\n\r\nI seem to see some tiny differences in the bottom stroke of the /x/,
    which makes me think the original is set in Kestrel. Yet, all the id's were to
    the point, thank you all!"
