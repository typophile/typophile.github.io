  to be a lot of variation in the amount of kerning pairs per font. A font like Frutiger
  LT Std 55 Roman (251 characters) by Linotype has 441 kerning pairs. URW's version
  of Frutiger, Frutus (Regular 243 characters), has 979 kerning pairs, and Cartogothic
  Std (349 characters), A free Frutiger version (ripoff?) by FontSite has 4726 kerning
  pairs. What does this tell me about the quality of these fonts, if anything? \r\n\r\nOf
  course it all comes down to the quality of the kerning itself, but still, would
  one spot the difference in a normal text setting to have 4000 instead of 400 kerning
  pairs?\r\n\r\nSome fonts like Jos Buivenga's Calluna have more than 50000 kerning
  pairs, but does this make them any better than fonts that only have a couple hundred
  pairs? What would you consider to be the minimal amount of kerning pairs for proper
  text setting? "

    Some designs just require a lot less kerning than others. A narrow sans design
    requires very few. A serif with wide capitals that are kerned to the lowercase
    requires a lot more. Small caps add even more. And how kerning classes are configured
    can have a pretty dramatic impact on the number of kerns in a font. A poorly spaced
    font will have many more kerning pairs than one that was spaced well to begin
    with. Accurate revivals of metal type require lots of kerning pairs to work with
    the tighter spacing and kerning used today. \r\n\r\nThere are some type designers
    out there who, in need of something good to say about their font, can\u2019t think
    of anything better to do than tout a large number of kerning pairs. I can\u2019t
    say that I\u2019ve ever been impressed by those statements."

  body: "I feel that \"kerning\" is somewhat overdone in many fonts.\r\n\r\nYes, it
    depends on the overall design, but if the type designer has set up the progression
    of weights properly based on the key control characters (H, O, n, o, 0), then
    there should be a standard functional set of kerning (approx. 400-600 pairs).\r\n\r\nThe
    \"functional set\" consists of several cap to lower case combinations like cap
    \"T\" to several lower case like \"a\", \"o\", etc., which obviously need some
    help with general spacing issues.\r\n\r\nHowever, that being said, it also depends
    on range of glyphs incorporated into a font.\r\n\r\nIf the designer includes all
    the \"Eastern European\" accented glyphs for example, the \"kerning\" sets can
    grow exponentially.\r\n\r\nThere is also a \"size\" limit to how many \"kerning
    pairs\" a font can have before it breaks. Somewhere around \"10,000 pairs\".\r\n\r\nSo,
    great care should be taken to minimize the \"functional set\" of kerning pairs
    in any font.\r\n\r\nHowever, just because a font has a lot of kerning pairs does
    not necessarily make it a bad font.\r\n\r\nIf you like the font you are using,
    why worry about how many 'kerns' are in a font anyway?\r\n\r\nAnd, in conclusion,
    this whole process of kerning is purely subjective, anyway.\r\n\r\nNo matter what
    a type designer incorporates into the fonts, someone else will probably have a
    different opinion anyway.\r\n\r\nI hope this helps and sheds some light on the
    subject for you."

  body: "<cite>The better the fitting is, the less kerning it requires.</cite>\r\n\r\nThis
    seems to be holy writ in the type design world. \r\n\r\nIt is true that with the
    Linotype linecaster anyway, there was no kerning. Monotype could cast a kern,
    so \"what's appropriate\" in a revival is a little cloudier than one might think.\r\n\r\nIf
    you ask \"how much kerning\" to those who use type, you're apt to get a different
    answer. Even if you ignore the pride and craft of the compositor, a few \"P.E.\"s
    from editors will make you sit up and take notice.\r\n\r\nWhen we get in a new
    font for setting text, I sit down and look at every letter pair, lowercase to
    lowercase, and cap to lowercase, and numbers. Included in this is the fit with
    the most frequent punctuation -- period, comma, hyphen, quotes, slash, and usually
    colon and semicolon. A lot of kerning comes about with the fit of punctuation.\r\n\r\nNow
    is this the fault of the type designer? I'd say no. The designer cannot tell what
    size the type will be used at. If you are trying for the best presentation of
    a type, the value of the sidebearings, as well as the kerning, depends on the
    setting size. \r\n\r\nAnother difference from metal, where every size could have
    its own design.\r\n\r\nSo from my perspective, the \"holy writ\" is trivially
    correct, because it is only the end user who can make the final decisions.\r\n\r\nAs
    a side note: I began setting type when \"tracking\" was available in increments
    of 1/18th of an em -- 18 units in the 1,000-unit em of today. Never used tracking
    much, it was just too big. All of a sudden I discovered (late, because of habits
    formed) that with InDesign anyway, tracking is incremented in 1/1000 of an em.
    That's useful. Now by in large, if you minus track, say one unit, to set 12-point
    type that you kerned for, say, setting at 10 points, most of the kerning holds
    up quite well. The same if you plus track the same type at an 8 point setting.
    The key word here is \"most.\"\r\n\r\nDo I rekern for these? No, it's just an
    observation. Not quite that compulsive -- or I'm too lazy, take your pick.\r\n\r\nOne
    final observation: I find often enough that with letters having similar shapes
    and similar sidebearings, I'll still use slightly different kerning values. For
    example, even though c, d, e, o, and q share a common left sidebearing and appearance,
    when I kern them, I'll wind up with slightly different values. So I don't much
    care for class kerning. If you want to call that whim, fine, I disagree. I also
    don't think it is the type designers responsibility.\r\n\r\n* * *\r\n\r\nEvery
    once in a while, a book (interior) designer winds up choosing a display font for
    setting the text. Sometimes it is a good choice for the book, but it is a lot
    of work. I'm currently working on such a font, a sans-light, where I'm sure the
    font designer assumed a 30-point or larger setting. It looks pretty good at that
    size, but looks just dreadful with a 10-point setting. The book designer noticed
    that, and tracked the font 20 units. Guess what, the ligatures broke, as they
    should. I've gone into the font and added 9 units to the left and right sidebearings,
    which solves the tracking/ligature issue. But the fit of the letters changes with
    such a drastic size change, and once again, I can see first hand that spacing
    values that work quite well at 30 points are too tight when set at 10 points,
    even with the extra space from increasing the sidebearings. \r\n\r\nNone of this
    work is brought about by a poor job by the font designer -- but I did have to
    point that out to the book designer."

    a related note; I recently rediscovered Kernus on my URW Typeworks collection.
    Unfortunately I did not as yet get it to function (it runs on mac OS classic,

    tables, I've read the manual, but it did not bring me much further; any help here

    suppose it should be no surprise -- Matthew Carter's fonts always seem well kerned
    to me -- that is, the values chosen are very good. I add kerning pairs, but rarely

    was Miller, which I got from Carter & Cone. I don't know whether Font Bureau has

    my opinion).\r\n\r\n<cite>That\u2019s exactly why I like class kerning. Finely

    perfect sense to me. \r\n\r\nJust remember that within the EULA, you allow this.
    It has always seemed a terrible notion to me to prohibit things that can be done,
    albeit with  more effort, with the layout program. Of course, those \"modifications\"
    by the layout program can't be prohibited.\r\n\r\nWhat is key for the designer/owner
    is that all copies of the font are paid for. You can let somebody modify it, but
    if they have a license for only one copy of the font, that just became their one
    copy. If they want to keep a copy with the original values, say for setting display,
    they should pay for a license that lets them have two copies.\r\n\r\nI suppose
    it's your business if you feel that your font is perfect as is, and want to prohibit
    all modifications. From my perspective, even if you're right, it just became like
    a metal font -- a one-size design. Well, sort of. Actually, metal fonts got modified.\r\n"

  body: Yes, Chris, of course you are right here. The problem is that I (A graphic
    designer) unfortunately was never given any proper education in stuff like kerning
    and spacing. I guess my education was more focused on expression and concept.
    I thought myself quite a lot afterwards, but still I sometimes get the feeling
    I need to know more to be able to judge the spacing, kerning, fitting etc. of
    a font. As I buy my fonts almost exclusivily via online retailers like MyFonts,
    or via a foundry itself, one mostly has to be able to judge the typeface on screen.
    Printed specimen help, but one needs a very good printer to get the proper quality
    required to judge the fonts. So any objective values or criteria are always welcome
    :-)

    the type is to be read, the smooth, uninterrupted flow of the letters is the proper
    \"kerning and spacing.\" Yes, letterfit will interact with word spacing, leading,
    size, and likely line measure. But so what? Do we need training in what looks
    good when we read? Elite Reading 101?\r\n\r\nWith that in mind, you can argue

    You'd have the likes of Jan Tschichold on your side of that argument.\r\n\r\nAs
    soon as graphic design becomes an important element in the work, \"proper spacing

    that you get the desired end result is not at all obvious. For starters, you have
    to have more than two letters present to do it, otherwise you can under- or over-kern
