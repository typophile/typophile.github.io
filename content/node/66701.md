  is behind the 'medium' weight, but now I forgot. \r\n\r\nSo what I'd like to learn
  is:\r\n\r\n(1)What's the purpose of the medium weight, sitting between standard
  and semi-bold? What do people generally use it for?\r\n\r\n(2)I want to set a letter
  in Minion Pro. Should I use the standard or the medium weight, or can I opt for
  either one?\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\nJurriaan"

  body: "1. One use for the medium weight is setting negative text (white on black,
    or some other dark colour. Not sure about the correct English nomenclature.) That
    will look quite similar to regular set black on white, while regular looks too
    light. Another use is when printing on cheap paper.\r\n\r\n2. I'd use regular.
    But there are no rules. Try both, and see what's most pleasing and readable."
