  very rough by now, but I kinda like where this is going.\r\n\r\nEmiliano Amadei"

  body: Just a little advice, (though unsolicited). Don't attach your actual files
    to critique. People come on this site all the time looking for free fonts. You
    just gave it out for free. I would detach it ASAP.

  body: "I'm not going to comment on the letterforms, because I know nothing about
    how to write graffiti properly.\r\n\r\nIt seems as though your pen nib has no
    thickness whatsoever. I'm not sure how you made this font, or how to fix this
    issue, but I'd suggest thinking of the pen nib as a rectangle rather than a line.\r\n\r\n
