body: I use font Linotype font explorer and Veenix font tools to manage my fonts.
  But still it takes forever to go through everything.  I have tons of fonts and wanted
  some suggestions on how others tend to search through their libraries to choose
  fonts. The best thing i can think of is to manually go through each font and tag
  meta data for searching. but that would take forever. why aren't tags built into
  fonts to make it easier?

    like MyFonts.com and then check in your computer if you have what you need.

  body: "Indeed... i find myself going to MyFonts more often than ever just to do
    a quick search for something like \"chalkboard\" -- when the results come up,
    I can almost immediately recognize some font(s) I have, then go into Font Agent
    and activate it/them.\r\n\r\nAt present, I've got my library organized mostly
    by foundry... Adobe in one set, Bitstream another, etc, etc. Of course, I had
    to break my \"Web\" fonts into multiple sets, and they're still too huge. And
    I find myself creating job-specific font sets more often than I used to, and keeping
    them longer -- I keep re-using the \"pirate\" set I built two years ago.\r\n\r\nOrganizing
    by style is one of my laundry-list things-to-do, but I fear I'll never get around
    to it; my biggest complaint/problem is that you can't permanently (or semi-permanently)
    tag fonts by style - sets you create in FontAgent/Suitcase/FontExplorer/etc are
    only good until you trash your system or upgrade... then you've gotta start all
    over again. The only way I can see to keep style sets organized thru catastrophes
    is to organize them in the Finder (by folder) in my master sets, but then I lose
    my foundry organization. And with 10,000+ fonts, I'm loathe to have multiple \"master\"
    sets (no pun intended).\r\n\r\n"

  body: "You CAN save your Font Explorer sets - go to Configure -> Load and save the
    file on a backup hard drive. Then when you upgrade or crash you can import it.
    Could have saved myself a ton of work recently had I known that.\r\n\r\nOrganizing
    by foundry generally is less useful for me, as that is rarely my jumping off point
    when I'm choosing a font for a job. I don't say to myself \"I think I'll use something
    from Emigre\" it's more like \"what's a good sans I haven't used recently?\" or
    \"what's an elegant serif that has an expert set\". If I already know which font
    I want I just type to it. And I don't need job-specific sets anymore with self-activation
    (altho that isn't working for me in Quark right now). I also tend to leave fonts
    for current jobs open for the duration of the job."

    actually contain that parameter, I mean PANOSE system codes, and there are font
    managers that can filter and sort lists using that codes as criteria. Unfortunately,
    foundries are not consistent in setting that PANOSE parameter."

  body: My sets also correspond to purpose, so they are Text sans, Text serif, Headline,
    Display - decorative, Display with effects (striped, outlined etc.), Display -
    distorted, Machine (typewriter, LCD and other device imitations), Script, Non-Latin
    and Pi fonts. And yes, there are subsets like Neutral, Elegant, Retro, Techno
    for Text serif, etc. Perhaps it's best to classify every new font acquired, to
    avoid organizing hundreds at once.

  body: I use the Explorer for that plus a normal font viewer. I create folders and
    sub-folders with my own classification system, so it's really easy for me to navigate
    to the desired category and then use the normal font viewer to preview the fonts.
