  language used to promote the movie <em>The Dictator</em>. Click on the top right
  icon \"Wadiyan\" to see the script and top left for the English. I will not comment
  on the movie or website as such, but have some technical questions about the font
  and how was it implemented. I saw \"ManchuRegular used as a font family in the html
  code. Is this a web font? I understand that Manchu is one of those languages faced
  with extinction - who made this font? Thanks Tom Milo for this reference.\r\n[[http://http://www.republicofwadiya.com/|The

    and change font, you will see that they\u2019re just english words rendered with
    a faux arabic font."

  body: 'The actual font name is Manchu Regular. Switching to Manchu is simply a change
    of font; the English text is left unchanged. "ManchuRegular" is defined in http://www.republicofwadiya.com/css/stylesheet.css
    with @font-face. The font files manch-webfont.woff, manch-webfont.ttf etc were  generated
    with the Squirrel <a href="http://www.fontsquirrel.com/fontface/generator"><strong>Font-Face
    Generator</strong></a>. (Note: the font is left to right, one glyph per latin
    letter).'

  body: Thank you Michel for the full explanation - it is a chance for me to learn
    about webfonts. Interestingly the Manchu language (which is threatened with extinction)
    uses the[[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchu_alphabet|Manchu script]]written
    vertically.

    avoid an allusion to Manchu.\r\n\r\n> I will not comment on the movie\r\n\r\nThere
    could never be an exact antidote to something\r\nlike this (people don't bite

    I did.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
