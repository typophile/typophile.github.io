		<div class="commentbody">&#62;Yes, a logo working for ceramics is probably harder to do. But i&#39;m not sure letters are more difficult to do than a mosaic thing. It&#39;s an interesting way to go, but despite the name, the school teaches also plate decoration &amp; things like that, so if the ceramics motto is a thing to explore, i guess i don&#39;t have to be to precise about it, if you see what i mean. About the ADEF &#40;this is it&#41; logo, i don&#39;t think i can do anything. They don&#39;t have even a designer &#40;there&#39;s maybe someone who&#39;s in charge of it, being a secretary or so, and they don&#39;t care all all.

		<div class="commentbody">&#34;Chris, thank you, but JFP and others were sadly right on one point : the big E doesn&#39;t mean anything. And i don&#39;t want so much a meanless design, even if it&#39;s aesthetically nice.&#34; <BR> <BR>That&#39;s the crux of the matter though. <BR> <BR>If people recognise what you&#39;re trying to say, even if the design is meaningless through a design standpoint, you&#39;ve done your job as a designer. <BR> <BR>You can have perfectly good design, playing by the rules and all that, that can be aestheticly pleasing, yet more often than not, it&#39;s the breaking of the rules that actually makes a design aesthetically pleasing. <BR> <BR>When I see your first logo, I see right away what it says, and I look at the way you emphasize the E and think it&#39;s a novel away of dealing with the situation. <BR> <BR>Then I look at your updated design, and see the same type of process going on, but say to myself &#34;how boring&#34;. <BR> <BR>Before you decide, do this:  Take both of your designs and show them to laypersons and see which design they like the best.  That is the design you should stick with. <BR> <BR>You&#39;re not designing your logo for designers, you&#39;re designing it for the common person, and they want something that looks nice.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Guillaume. There is something nice about this latest version. The hand shows through. Similar to ceramics, you can often see the hand in the work. However, I think the silhouette of the vase is too tricky. I wouldn&#39;t use that.  Can you unify the weights? The widths on the strokes and interior lines change too much. <BR> <BR>As for the first version. Having the E large as you do, completely confuses the hierarchy of legibility. And as JFP pointed out you have too much going on. <BR> <BR>I would say Tyfa is of the crunchy variety. Not creamy. On the other hand, Biblon is super creamy.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Guillaume, <BR> <BR>I have to agree with Tiffany. The vase shape seemed too contrived before. Now that it&#39;s also the C and the accent, it feels even more so. <BR> <BR>I like the handlettered feel of ECP2. Take out the vase and work to make the weight even as Tiffany suggested &#40;Draw a real cap for the C and P rather than enlarging one&#41;. I like the horizontal rules in the type though. It subtly suggested a coil pot to me. This can look very elegant too if you want.

		<div class="commentbody">I really think that you stick too much to this single concept. Maybe you should try something completely else &#40;I don&#39;t know how you are used to do that, but I would take a sketchbook and go to the coast or mountains somewhere...&#41;. Actually I would read this last version as &#34;eramique&#34; instead of &#34;Ceramique&#34;, if I would not have seen the earlier posts. Personally I even can&#39;t see a possibility to make a vase out of a serifed C letter without loosing the legibility completely. <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR></div>

		<div class="commentbody">Yes, it seems that this C is not easely readable as a C, as some other people tell me. It&#39;s a pity because i liked both the idea and the look. I&#39;m going to the south, very soon, so i guess i&#39;ll have to think about it around the seaS&#60;caron&#62; My father himself is a drawer, and a talented one, so i&#39;ll try to work with him on other ideas.</div>
