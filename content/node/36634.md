  body: I'm not sure, but I believe this is a font by [[http://www.bionic-systems.com|bionic
    systems]], a design studio here in duesseldorf. I think they also did the corporate
    design for Prehm & Arendt and seem to use this font in various projects, e.g.
    the [[http://www.open-source-festival.de|open source festival]]. I don't know
    if this font is for sale.
