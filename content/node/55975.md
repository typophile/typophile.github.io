  body: "(Pssst: I have a companion text version in early beta - a real roman {w/o
    all the weird stuff}, book weight only - on my drawing board. I'm using it soon
    for an album design, making tweaks up until the album goes to press. Not totally
    usable though at this point, no italics or bolds yet.) ;)\r\n\r\nI'd love to see
    some suggestions, I've been so sucked in to drawing this thing, I'm not sure exactly
    what I'd pair the display versions with.\r\n\r\nWhat are you designing (what's
    the genre?) - that may lead to a solution.\r\n\r\n(Thanks for purchasing/using!)\r\n\r\ns\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Hello, and thank you for the response!  It is truly a beautiful font, in
    all weights and styles.  I am designing a directory for a high-end jewelry designer's
    trade show, and Jeanne Moderno will most likely be the headline and possibly the
    page numbers.\r\n\r\nI wish your companion text was out already (selfishly) and
    I can't wait to see it.  However, I am sure that there is a suitable companion
    out there.  Many decision makers in this studio dont care for serif fonts for
    text (arg, see previous threads) so I am trying to find a nice sans that complements
    it.\r\n"

  body: "Thank you again ... And, well ... I wanna finish the text version(s) because
    I want to (selfishly) use them too. But I am trying not to rush it. ;)\r\n\r\n(psst:
    the album it will be on will be for this artist: http://www.myspace.com/ivellora
    - Chelsea (i Vellora) was actually one of my muses for the drawing of Jeanne;
    my other muse is her regular band, theSTART - and - most important muse of all
    - Jeanne is named after my wife) :)\r\n\r\nYour ears should be burning, I was
    just talking about you in an IM chat with my friend Tri; and here's some companion
    sans we came up with:\r\n\r\nFenwick\r\nNobel\r\nFutura ND (book, light)\r\nand\r\nAkzidenz
    (just as a workhorse whim)\r\n\r\nI seem to fall back on a Futura thing, just
    because it's sort of from the same era I was shooting for with Jeanne Moderno.
    \r\n\r\nAnd I was asking, 'What is a Futura that's not a Futura,' and we ended
    up looking at Nobel.\r\n\r\nBut it will come down to how you use them. My old
    standby used to be a light weight of Myriad, which could work. Maybe.\r\n\r\nHope
    this helps. :)\r\n"
