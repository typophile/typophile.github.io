  body: "<blockquote>Where does everyone get their display typefaces?</blockquote>\r\nUsually
    from freefonts sites.\r\n\r\nThat said, Veer used to have a curated collection
    (used in the sense that they stopped adding new fonts to it).\r\nYou Work for
    Them has some of varying interestingness.\r\nYou could want to check independent
    font sites for news about last releases. Some examples:\r\nhttp://typographica.org/\r\nhttp://ilovetypography.com/\r\nhttp://typedia.com/blog/category/only/type-news/\r\n\r\nSome
    further ruminations: http://typophile.com/node/88657\r\n"

  body: "\u201CSmaller\u201D foundries licence their fonts either directly or through
    a reseller, or both.\r\nThe big resellers are MyFonts, Fonts.com, Veer, and FontShop.\r\nSo
    you can find plenty of uniqueness there.\r\nLikewise with T-26 and Village, which
    could be considered smaller resellers.\r\nThe \u201Csmall\u201D foundries that
    only sell their own work direct from their site are quite few, e.g. H&FJ and Terminal.\r\n\r\nTo
    learn more, consult these books:\r\nhttp://shop.gestalten.com/type-navigator.html\r\nhttp://www.p22.com/indiefonts/indie3.html\r\n(Also
    vols. 1 & 2)\r\n\r\nType Navigator explains very well how the industry works."

  body: 'Nick, thanks for mentioning Terminal Design. Being a one-person operation
    I am indeed a "small" foundry. I''d have to argue with classifying H&FJ a "small"
    foundry. They have quite a few employees and are probably one of the "larger"
    operations out there. '

  body: "I almost always start with [[http://www.myfonts.com|MyFonts]] and then also
    try to search out designers and foundries directly. Of course, many of them do
    sell through MyFonts, so I frequently end up back there. [[http://http://typographica.org/|Typographica]]
    is a good way to keep up with new font releases and locate some designers/foundries.\r\n\r\nTim"
