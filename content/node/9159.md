  to the avantguard fonts of the 1910-20s. <BR>The subject is the influence of avantgaurde
  &#40;expecially abstract&#41; art on the acidental fonts. <BR>I&#39;m situated in

  body: Probably the best single-volume reference to the typographical avantgarde
    is Herbert Spencer&#39;s &#34;Pioneers of Modern Typography&#34;, which has a
    lot of material on the Futurists, El Lissitzky, Rodchenko, Kurt Schwitters and
    his &#34;solid poetry&#34;, and the like. <BR> <BR><a href="http://youworkforthem.com/product.php?sku=P0351"

    you don&#39;t have one of the permutations of Lewis Blackwell&#39;s &#34;20th
    Century Type&#34;, that&#39;s a pretty good overview of modernism in the West,
    but as it&#39;s a survey that covers an entire century, its coverage is short.
    <BR> <BR>I think most of the really interesting stuff back then happened in Central
    and Eastern Europe anyway. I don&#39;t know how easy it is to find contemporary
    histories in Russian on that stuff &#40;although given how heavily the Soviets
    coopted Futurist style, it might not be that tough&#41;, but I think you&#39;re
    in a great place.

    modernism, with his condensed sans &#40;1922&#41;: <BR> <BR><a href="http://www.linotype.com/7-380-7/jakoberbar.html"
    target="_blank">http://www.linotype.com/7-380-7/jakoberbar.html</a> <BR> <BR>His
    Koloss &#40;1923&#41; is quite modern, with a little bit of art deco, but not
    as much as Morris Benton&#39;s Broadway &#40;1925&#41;. <BR> <BR><a href="http://www.linotype.com/188/broadway-family.html"

    these types preceded the definitive modernist type, Futura, which was released
    in 1928 &#40;although first proofed as early as 1926&#41;, Bernhard Gothic &#40;1929&#41;,
    Nobel &#40;1929&#41;, and Kabel &#40;1928&#41;. <BR> <BR>There are other ways
    of defining avant garde, rather than following this &#34;modernism&#34; thread.
    <BR> <BR>In the first two decades of the 20th Century, Art Nouveau and Arts &amp;
    Crafts were two art movements which were precursors of Modernism, and which produced
    radical typefaces which were avant garde in the sense of challenging the status
    quo. However, their advances weren&#39;t followed into the mainstream, as were
    those of modernism.'

    lettering &#40;from c. 1912?&#41; was not made into a typeface until the digital
