  body: They both look like [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/mti/arial|Arial]], horizontally
    stretched for 'LOIC' and vertically stretched and slanted for 'SPORT'.

  body: "Arial Bold widened 120% for LOIC, and Arial Bold Italic narrowed to 70% (with
    75% word spacing) for SPORT actually does it. \r\n\r\nWhat The Font doesn't accommodate
    for scale and spacing manipulation, so it tried to match them literally. Of course,
    it doesn't help that the O and R in SPORT are rotated (the R a little, the O a
    lot)."
