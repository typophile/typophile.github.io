  the header style, labels on/off, color chooser.\r\n\r\nI'm not quite done but you
  can fork my version here: https://github.com/andreaslarsen/Font-Testing-Page (it's
  the theme-chooser branch) and run it in localhost with \"cd\" to the folder and
  then \"php -S localhost:8000\" in terminal.\r\n\r\nI'm afraid I need to rewrite
  a lot of the styling to make it perfect (currently grey + dark background doesn't
  look good when saved as pdf) but let me know what you think and it me with other
  ideas/suggestions.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/1_3760.png]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/2_4156.png]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/3_5307.png]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/4_6606.png]"
