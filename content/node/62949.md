  how others keep up to date with the latest released fonts. What is your habit? Is
  there a few must visit websites you visit each week that does a round up of the
  week/months releases etc?\r\n\r\nI'd love to be able to go to one or two website
  each week, or be email once or twice a week with the latest releases without having
  to go and visit every font designers website etc.\r\n\r\nAny help would be great"

    <a href=\"http://typographica.org\">Typographica</a> and I'll be posting more
    frequent reviews soon.\r\n\r\nJames, I think Raptor was using the word \"shop\"
    figuratively. He's looking for a news source, not necessarily a store.  Still,
    one of the many services resellers provide is exactly this, introducing buyers
    to goods they wouldn't otherwise find. "
