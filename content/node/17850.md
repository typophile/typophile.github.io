body: "This a very basic question and I'm almost embarassed to ask, but anyway...\r\nIt's
  easy to define the stress (angle) of round shapes such as o, p, b, etc, but how
  about in other shapes? \r\nFor example, in the sample below the only stress I can
  easily find are in the letters o, d, and the bowl of the P. Even for the n (which
  should be an easy one, shouldn't it?) I can't really figure it out. I feel I am
  still <em>looking</em> but not yet <em>seeing</em>. Heeelp!\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/fournier_detalhes.png]"

    how letters in a typeface are related to each other. \r\n\r\nBodonis have vertical
    stress, and yet their \"M\"s have the same weight distribution of your sample.\r\n\r\n--

    over the entire alphabets. In some faces the stress angle varies a lot, but the
    final effect is a collective one. '

  body: "Thank for your answers. I agree with both of you. Maybe I'm \"looking too
    hard\"?\r\nAnd by the way, if anyone cares, those characters are from a (reproduction
    of) Fournier page. My difficulty was that I wanted to indicate the stress angle
    over the characters to show it; but while Renaissance characters were no problem,
    I got kind of stuck here.\r\n\r\nI suppose it's because since earlier typeforms
    are more calligraphic, the stress is more apparent and consistant trough various
    characters. As typeforms turn less \"written\" and more \"sculpted\" those rules
    don't apply as much."

    out. it has to do with the calligraphic origins of letterforms. you might find
    it interesting if you already haven't seen it...\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n---------\r\nnc"
