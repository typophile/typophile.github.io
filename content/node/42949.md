body: "Hi everyone,\r\n\r\nI have a question regarding a typography quiz that I recently
  took for my class:  \r\n\r\n5) A type family is the complete range of variations
  of a typeface design, including roman, italic and bold. A type family is also used
  to describe the 5 basic font families (sans serif, serif, cursive, monospace, and
  fantasy) that are used to define fonts on the Web.\r\n\r\nI answered this as false,
  but the professor says it's actually true.  Can someone please explain this to me?
  \ I'm a bit confused with this one...\r\n\r\nMany thanks in advance,\r\nPG"

    CSS Specification does include a \"<a href=\"http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-CSS2/fonts.html#generic-font-families\">font-family</a>\"
    property with generic values of serif, sans-serif, cursive, fantasy and monospace.
    But font-family and type family (aka. typeface family or font family) are not
    nearly the same and has little to do with typography.\r\n\r\nAnd I've never seen
    anyone use the cursive or fantasy values."

  body: "This is the response that she wrote to me in her email reply, when I asked
    her why she believed the answer to the question was true:  \r\n\r\n\"A type family
    doesn't just include the typeface (ie Times) but also includes the type style
    within that typeface (ie Times italics, Times bold etc). A type family can also
    be classified as a san serif type family (ie. Arial, Verdana etc) or a serif type
    family (ie. Times, Georgia etc). They are groupings of some commonality, depending
    on its criteria.\" \r\n\r\nI don't understand how her email reply proves that
    the answer to the question is \"true\".  :0/\r\n\r\n\r\nHELP!  :0("

  body: 'Though relatively uncommon, type families occasionally include complementing
    sans and serif faces. Sounds to me like your teacher was hoping to throw everyone
    off by including words such as cursive and fantasy. The trouble is the wording:
    <cite>A type family is also used to describe...</cite> It''s not commonly used
    to describe collections of cohesive yet widely varying typefaces, much less groupings
    of serif faces such as Times and Georgia.'

    her area of expertise. Nor is language.

  body: "In her response to your e-mail, she throws in classification, which doesn't
    have much to do with what constitutes a family. Apples and oranges. And as you
    suspect, she's not really answering your question.\r\n\r\nEven her first sentence,
    in which she does try to address your question (<em>A type family doesn\u2019t
    just include the typeface (ie Times) but also includes the type style within that
    typeface (ie Times italics, Times bold etc)</em>) is worded in a confusing way.\r\n\r\nThe
    thing about the test question is that it's a little tricky -- if you answer \"False\"
    to the second part of the question, you are also saying that the first part is
    false! But you aren't allowed to explain that difference in your answer..."

  body: "I emailed her again to ask for further clarification, and she sent me the
    following in an email reply:  \r\n\r\n\"Font family is the different styles within
    one font (ie. Times italics, Times bold etc). Type family really depends on how
    you want to group the type. For example, I want to have a group (or family) of
    san serif type, so that can be Georgia, Verdana and Arial. Type family has a larger
    definition.\"\r\n\r\nI also researched this before writing to her, and every publication
    I came across says the correct answer is false.  It sucks because I lose ten points
    now, on my quiz as a result of this question...but I don't want her to feel as
    if I'm somehow being pushy (even though I should be, as this is not the grade
    that I deserve).  \r\n\r\nI'll just make a mental note of what the correct answer
    really is.  Although, I'm pretty sure I'll never forget this one...  Thanks everyone.

  body: "Ken has it exactly. The second sentence of your prof's question is regarding
    web fonts, and is an accurate definition of the CSS property \"font-family\" which
    is NOT the same as type family.\r\n\r\nSo your response, \"false,\" is correct.\r\n\r\n(And
    I could reasonably be cited as an expert on font terminology in general and web
    fonts in particular.)"
