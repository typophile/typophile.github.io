  body: Thanks Jan. I'm looking for Marriage and Families. The 'a' on Families makes
    it tricky.

  body: "The \"Marriage\" type is Stettler, an old VGC film font from the sixties.
    It hasn't been digitized, as far as I know.\r\n\r\nPhoto-Lettering had a face
    called Franklin Graphic that might have been the basis for the \"Families\" logo,
    with some tweaking. (It seems to have been the forerunner for ITC Franklin Gothic,
    too.)"
