  body: This looks like hot metal embossing to me. It may be a vintage metal sort
    that hasn&#39;t been digitized.  <BR> <BR>You could look at <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/search?search%5Btext%5D=arabesque"

  body: It is a Monotype set of ornaments, used by Jan Tschichold and others. I have
    done a digital version included into the Ornament font of the Sabon Next family
    that I designed for Linotype on 2002.
