  to justify right. I have changed the justification settings in indesign and i have
  got it nearly perfect, but i turned on the H&J violation on in indesign because
  some lines didn't look right. Can anyone give me some hints on fixing these odd
  bits of text as i have been working on it for 4 days now and i am starting to get
  annoyed with it. I have tried adjusting the scales of the sentence but it doesn't
  seem to help, as once i have fixed one line the other lines get highlighted and
  look wrong.\r\n\r\nI did originally pick to do a typography project because i would
  like to gain more experience in the field so any tips would really be useful\r\n\r\n<a

  body: "Hi Sarah,\r\n\r\nSetting justified type can be very challenging as you're
    learning with this exercise. When done with care and precision, the blocks of
    text can create an elegant, even gray color. \r\n\r\nThe first thing I noticed
    was that your text lacks a single hyphen. Have you set up paragraph styles for
    your text? If not, you should do so because adjustments to the type will be simpler
    going forward. If you have, go into your paragraph style and turn on hyphenation.
    Next, you will need to adjust the rules for hyphenation and justification. Everyone
    has their preferences and what you select depends a great deal on they typeface
    with which you are working. The goal is to achieve the most even word and character
    spacing as possible. Large gaps in word spacing slow the eye.\r\n\r\nBelow is
    a sample set of H&J rules. What you select depends a great deal on the character
    of typeface you're setting as well as the proportions of the page (margins, body
    width, etc.)\r\n\r\n<strong>Hyphenation</strong>\r\nWords with at least: 6 letters\r\nAfter
    First: 3 letters (min. # of letters allowed to break at end of line)\r\nBefore
    Last: 3 letters (min. # of letters allowed to break to next line)\r\nHyphen Limit:
    2 hyphens (number of consecutive hyphens allowed)\r\nHyphenation Zone: (Make adjustments
    with preview on and see how changes affect spacing)\r\nHyphenate Capitalized Words:
    Uncheck\r\nHyphenate Last Word: Uncheck\r\nHyphenate Across Column: Uncheck\r\n\r\n<strong>Justification</strong>\r\nYou'll
    get more opinions about proper justification settings than you will about hyphenation.
    \r\n\r\nWord Spacing: The default is a bit extreme, in my opinion. Better sets
    of numbers tend to be much closer in range. (Min: 90%, Desired: 98%, Max: 105%).
    Remember, the ideal is to have all word spaces match completely, so the wider
    the range here, the more you are allowing word spaces to differ.\r\n\r\nLetter
    Spacing: Be cautious when adjusting letter spacing. There's a reason the default
    is 0. I'd only alter this by 1% in any given direction, if at all. Sometimes,
    you want to globally adjust the tracking of the entire text. You could set your
    desired letter spacing to -1%, for example. But a better way to do this would
    be to just set the tracking to a specific point size. \r\n\r\nGlyph scaling can
    be contentious. Some folks will tell you to never scale glyphs to any degree.
    Others, for the sake of achieving even word spacing, will allow glyphs to scale
    down to, say, 98% and up to maybe 102%. \r\n\r\n\r\nDo you have Robert Bringhurst's
    \"The Elements of Typographic Style\"? It's a must for designers and typographers.\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    the text look perfect now. I don't have The Elements of Typographic Style, i will
    get it though, The books my lecturers seems to tell me to get don't really help,
    as i was told type and typography by John Baines wasn;t really helpful.\r\n\r\nBtw
    an non justified question, but doe anyone know if you should start a new line
    when someone talks, cos i have bought one of the original copies of alice in wonderland
    and it doesn't. "

  body: "<cite> > Word Spacing: The default is a bit extreme, in my opinion. Better
    sets of numbers tend to be much closer in range. (Min: 90%, Desired: 98%, Max:
    105%)</cite>\r\n\r\nThis is misleading, I think. The \u201Cbetter sets of numbers\u201D
    statement really depends upon the application and justification engine being used.\r\n\r\nThe
    truth of the matter is that the setting for Maximum word spacing will not limit
    the maximum allowable word spacing. \r\n\r\nFirst, the three sets of numbers are
    utilized internally by the justification algorithm to assess penalties for the
    various possibilities of any given line (or sets of lines, if multi-line calculations
    are being done). \r\n\r\nSecond, the Max setting is how wide a word space must
    become before the engine will then apply any additional letter spacing.\r\n\r\nBut
    at the end of the entire process, if the engine is unable to come up with a satisfactory
    setting for a given line, then it will give up and throw all the extra space into
    the word spaces to justify the line. So it is entirely possible (maybe even likely)
    to wind up with instances of wide word spacing even if you set Max to something
    very constrained like 105%.\r\n\r\nIn InDesign, with the multi-line composer enabled,
    you are actually better off giving the engine as much latitude as is actually
    acceptable. If you really cannot abide any space tighter than 90%, then by all
    means, set your Min to 90%. But if you would accept 80% in the most difficult
    situations in order to solve a problem, then you are better off setting the Min
    to 80%, so that the algorithm has all the potential it can get to work with. The
    InDesign algorith will only use that 80% if it really must (i.e., it has a higher
    penalty) in order to get the best overall setting.\r\n\r\nOf course, if the Max
    setting is limited too severely, then the algorithm will probably have to resort
    to the tighter setting more often.\r\n\r\nLimiting the Min too conservatively
    just ties the algorithms hands, and limiting the Max doesn\u2019t really have
    the desired affect of limiting the widest word spaces.\r\n\r\nIn Quark, on the
    other hand, the engine is a single-line composer. In this case, Quark will tend
    to use the tightest spacing allowed more frequently to fit a line. So, here, you
    may be better off holding back a little on your Min and leaving some room to solve
    any especially intractable problems manually. (The same holds for the Min letter
    spacing.)\r\n\r\nIn Quark, too, the Max setting will only determine how wide a
    space before resorting to letter spacing, after which it will just throw any leftover
    space into word spaces anyway, if it can\u2019t find a better way.\r\n\r\nWith
    InDesign\u2019s multi-line composer, any problem areas will be distributed as
    best it can. In Quark, what you\u2019ll find is that the lines at the beginning
    of a paragraph are better fitted and hew closer to the desired settings; but as
    Quark runs out of good possibilities, you\u2019ll end up with a preponderance
    of loose lines toward the end of a paragraph.\r\n\r\nThe actual numbers to use
    may well depend upon the width of the nominal word space in the font being used.\r\n\r\nFor
    many contemporary digital fonts, the word space is on the order of 250 units,
    which equates to a quarter of an em. This is often cited in typography manuals
    as a good general space value. Those same manuals will cite a fifth of an em as
    a good minimum. This would then equate to 80% of a 250-unit nominal word space.
    That\u2019s where Adobe's default comes from. I disagree with Roy (seventy7);
    I think this is generally a fine Min setting.\r\n\r\nHowever, there are plenty
    of fonts with smaller nominal word spaces, where the default settings may indeed
    yield results too tight (or not: it really depends on how well suited the nominal
    word space is to the design of the typeface \u2014 as well as the typographer\u2019s
    tastes and the particular text setting).\r\n\r\nAnd there are plenty of fonts
    (generally older Monotype faces, I\u2019ve found), where the nominal word space
    value is excessive, on the order of 278 units, where one might want a Min of closer
    to 70% and an Optimal of 90% or so.\r\n\r\nAt the end of the day, there is no
    hard and fast solution. One must learn the ins and outs, how justification (and
    hyphenation) works, and train one\u2019s eyes to gauge the results.\r\n\r\nSorry
    for the lengthy sermon."

  body: 'If I can add a personal (and completely amateurish) touch to Kent''s excellent
    explanation: paragraph and single lines justification and word spacing also depends
    on the specific type you''re using. Usually, I set texts in books with the default
    ID settings, then I manually adjust every single paragraph - or single text lines
    within a paragraph - whenever I find them looking weird (disharmonic). How do
    I do that? It depends. Maybe a different hypenation is needed, or a line must
    break with a different word. But, althought ID is an excellent program, you can''t
    completely depend on how the software sets the page for you. And looking at the
    pages printed also helps you finding what''s wrong with them.'

  body: "It has been said before, but I'll say it again. Setting justified always
    involves compromises. Unless you can rewrite the text, you will have to accept
    this.\r\n\r\nTo set the spaceband values: Start by setting ragged right. In the
    Justification portion of the paragraph style, set the \"ideal\" value to 100 (percent)
    Then go down in 2 percent increments -- 100, 98, 96, 94, 92, 90. Print each out
    as you make the change, and write the value you used on the back of the paper.
    One of them will look better -- the wordspacing will fit well with the character
    spacing, and it will not be a chore to determine word boundaries. Do not try to
    judge from the screen. Print out a page worth of each setting.\r\n\r\nThat will
    eventually become you \"ideal\" value. While still in the ragged mode, change
    the center \"Ideal\" value the same way, starting with 80, then going down, 78,
    76, 74, etc. When it becomes a chore -- not hard, but a chore WHILE READING --
    to determine the word boundaries, you have your \"minimum\" value. Set the maximum
    value to whatever you want -- it doesn't affect much, because you're going to
    set the tracking and scaling values to something like 0.5% Why so small? Because
    eventually, you're going to have to make/save a line to make up a page, and they
    will come in handy for that. I like to save tracking and scaling to use by hand.\r\n\r\nWhen
    you start setting the type justified with the values you've just determined, you
    might find that you want to go down a percent or so for the ideal value. Things
    sometimes work out that way. For a ragged setting, use what you determined to
    be \"perfect.\"\r\n\r\nI set the minimum number of letters before hyphenation
    to two. The hyphen makes up the third character. This lets words like \"become\",
    because\", etc, hyphenate. The minimum for letters taken down should be three
    -- though people who follow Dowding should note he'll take down only two letters
    if that is the only way to avoid a loose line. Since this is a final project with,
    I suppose, a grade, you might try and find out what your professor feels the correct
    numbers are. Every rule that prohibits the breaking of a line -- don't do this,
    don't do that -- comes directly out of the evenness of the word spacing. Where
    else could it come from?\r\n\r\nRemember, no widows. Some say no orphans. At least
    two lines of an extract at the head or foot of a page. At least two lines of text
    before or after a subhead at the head or foot of a page. Some say 3 lines. It
    can be done, but you wind up running more pages shorter or longer. It's all compromise,
    all the rules do is constrain you.\r\n\r\nEdit: By the way. Why is your running
    head closer to the trim that to the text? What does it belong to? I'd say it belongs
    to the text, so it should be closer. As a starting point, I'd keep the number
    of text lines the same, but move the text block up, closer to the RH. This will
    also give you a larger foot margin, which is traditional. Etc. Take a gander at
    some award-winning books -- not picture books, but books with mainly text. That
    would be a good a starting point."
