body: 'I&#39;ve been toying around with the new illustrator CS and its Opentype capabilities.  <BR>
  <BR>Works very, very nice with Adobe Pro fonts, but Illustrator doesn&#39;t recognize
  the OT features of the .dfonts, that came with Panther, like Big Caslon. Only if
  you insert manually with the Glyph Palette. But I can hardy call that &#34;user-friendly&#34;.
  <BR> <BR>Example: if you specify Small Caps in Illustrator with Big Caslon, it gives
  you scaled capitals &#40;aaaaaargh&#41;. It works in TextEdit tough. But on the
  other hand, TextEdit can&#39;t cope with the Adobe Pro-fonts... <BR> <BR>I tought
  that Opentype would end all this misery ?'

    actual font data in the data fork instead of in the resource fork?

  body: .dfonts are Apple-style Truetype fonts with the resource data moved to the
    data fork. They are slightly different in structure than .ttf fonts, though both
    are data fork Truetype. .dfonts can but generally don&#39;t contain OpenType tables.
    Apple built the format purely out of necessity, because the Mac OS X build process
    requires files with all data accessible on a Unix filesystem, which doesn&#39;t
    have resource forks. <BR> <BR>Resource forks are an ideological issue among programmers.
    Personally I think they&#39;re dumb and Steve did good to make OS X work on filesystems
    without them, whether or not he wanted to. <BR> <BR>Big Caslon, Skia, Apple Chancery
    and some other Apple system fonts are AAT &#40;Apple Advanced Typography&#41;
    fonts. AAT used to be called GX. The only way you can use their features is in
    AAT-savvy apps, which includes TextEdit and Keynote on Panther systems, and WorldText
    on pre-Panther systems. To get those features in InDesign, do the text in TextEdit,
    export it as a PDF, and import the PDF into InDesign or Illustrator or whatever.
    Awkward, ja? It&#39;s generally only useful for headlines.

    a ridiculous idea, especially in a world where only one computer system uses them.  Whoever
