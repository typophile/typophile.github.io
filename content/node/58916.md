  upon this one font. It was listed among fonts like Avant Garde Gothic, Futura, etc
  for house numbering. All other fonts seemed real and this one was listed as \"Ribbon\".
  Does anyone know of the existence of this font or what it may really be called?"

    G and R. Another font with a similar structure is [[http://www.foundrytypes.co.uk/foundry_sterling/sterling_book.html|Foundry
    Sterling]]. Only the numerals are an obvious mismatch, although details of the
    font are not exact either, on closer inspection.\r\n\r\nI think in past discussions
    we had noted that there are times when an 'unimaginative' (to be polite) foundry
    has altered a few letters from a familiar design, thereby creating a 'new' typeface.
    In my opinion, \"Ribbon\" began life as Futura and had a few of its letters replaced.\r\n\r\n-

  body: "Actually...Remember that you were browsing sign making fonts\u2014characters
    that exist in three dimensions. While it <em>is</em> a bastardization of Futura,
    it's one that goes back to the 50s. Dimensional letters exist in, well, three
    dimensions\u2014not in pixels or on paper\u2014and so there is the X and the Y
    that graphic designers are used to, but there's also a Z. Most letters are relatively
    thin compared to the width of the stroke, but Ribbon is a thin stroke, so the
    <em>depth</em> is actually greater than the width. The letter O is actually a
    cylinder, and the letter S looks like, well, a ribbon. This is exaggerated by
    the \"alternate\" of Deep Ribbon, where the width of the stroke may be .5\", but
    the depth may be 2\", vs. maybe 1.25\" in in regular Ribbon. These letters are
    produced by Gemini Signs & Letters, and were particularly popular with architects
    in the Mad Men days of yore."
