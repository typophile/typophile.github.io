  was to create an identity for a homemade cookie company with emphasis on the homemade
  and traditional elements of the brand.\r\nI've taken the logo in a different direction
  from my original ideas.\r\n\r\nThis logo was my original idea that I wanted to use.
  \r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/logo_1_4204.png]\r\n\r\nThis is the different
  direction that I took it. This logo would be applied by rubber stamp to all the
  stationary and packaging.\r\nBecause this is quite a small-time company this is
  commercially viable. I hand drew the lettering and then traced them. Advice on the
  type would be really appreciated as I have never really done it before.\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/logo_2_4658.png]\r\n\r\nThanks

  body: I would say you've done something very nice. It is legible. I would mention
    that my eye goes to that ball terminal in the ampersand, probably because of the
    power of the target/sun glyph. You might turn the volume down on that bit and
    then the L & E will lead the eye.

  body: More balanced. It keeps my eye moving. I'm not stopping on the ampersand.
    I suspect you could work with the curves and the harmony of shapes forever. This,
    to me, is a much improved direction.

  body: I think that could look very nice rubber stamped. Check [[http://www.flickr.com/photos/luxuryluke/510533727/|this
    flickr page]] for that kind of rubber stamp aesthetic.

    labels like that with thread to tie up small canvas bags for the packaging. '

  body: "I like what you've done. The L form could use a bit of work. The stroke feels
    a bit stiff at the transition points at the top loop and the bottom. The little
    hook on the E that meets the j feels like it could use a little work. Something
    about where it transitions from thin to thick doesn't quite sit right with me.
    Also the bottom left curve of the ampersand feels like it has a slight kink in
    it near the dot in the i, that flattens the bottom bowl a bit.\r\n\r\nAs jupiterboy
    said, you could tweak this thing forever. Overall, it's looking very good. Hopefully
    you've been tweaking this thing for a few days now."

  body: Wouldn't it be good (or would it?) if the exit strok on the ampersand and
    the y crossed in some way?

  body: "I really like the first & second ones - I'd perhaps want something between
    them, in terms of weight of the ampersand.   The third one feels far stiffer to
    me - the \"E\" and \"L\" seem deprived of some of their fluidity.  I disagree
    about crossing the ampersand & the \"y\" - those exit strokes balance the L/E
    strokes on the left very well right now (or at least in 1 & 2).\r\n\r\nLovely
    work!"

  body: "Speed it up a little, so that it looks a bit like you write this message
    on every product as a signature of approval. The anger over the revaluation that
    Rumsfeld stamped his signature shows how much people value these little touches.\r\nThis
    means that you should have a slightly inconsistent x-height, drop the bottom of
    the v, bring the e up so the bottom of the curl is closer to the level of the
    top of the v, line up the start of the ampersand stroke with the end of the e,
    link the n w/ the E, draw up the end of the n more sharply, draw the bottom of
    the j out more horizontally, and not curl back and just let it go."

  body: Nice concept. Your curves are getting better. Look at some old issues of U&Lc.
    Tom Carnase once said to me that while drawing curves on a letterform one should
    imagine flying a small plane with a cup of coffee on the dashboard and trying
    not to curve in such a way as to spill it.
