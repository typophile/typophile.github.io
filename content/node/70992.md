    for OpenType).\r\n\r\nCommand \"fontplot -h\" and \"fontplot -help_params\". Fontplot
    stores the character map as PDF. I am not sure, if there is an option for putting
    the index numbers into the boxes, but if not, maybe someone is willing to modify
    the Python script.\r\n\r\nI did not try it, but you also could redirect the output
    of the print commands of FontLab and convert the Postscript file to PDF.\r\n\r\nBut
    I think, there are more comfortable ways."

    Windows it is more comfortable to write the command in this way:\r\ntx -pdf -a
    fontFileName.extension\r\n\r\nThe -a-option arranges the name of the output by
    taking the fontFileName as filename and the mode-option (in this case pdf) as
    extension. (Have you tried the -bc-mode-option? ASCII-art.)\r\n\r\nAnd -A instead
    of -a takes the internal fontname instead of the name of the input file.\r\n\r\nBut
    I need a bit help with the options -dd and -sd. I get an error there: file error
    <No such file or directory> [NameOfInputDirectory/-]"

  body: "Redirection is not required. What you suggest also works on the mac.  I use
    Unix pipes a lot (with sed, grep and awk), and the last thing I do is to redirect;
    with programs whose output is the standard output, it is the thing to do.  I was
    in fact not aware of the -a or -A options. I just tried the dd option. I was in
    /library/fonts and, after creating the folder $HOME/Arno typed\r\n\r\n<code>tx
    -pdf -a -dd $HOME/Arno Arno*otf</code>\r\n\r\nwhich took as input all the files
    Arno*otf, applied tx -pdf on them, named the result with a pdf extension and put
    them in the folder $HOME/Arno. \r\n\r\nThat is something I would have done with
    the line command\r\n\r\n<code>for i in Arno*.otf; do tx -pdf $i > $HOME/Arno/${i%.otf}.pdf;
    done<code>\r\n\r\nIt is faster to type than to read the output of <code>tx -u</code>
    but that is probably not the kind of text for a typophile thread. It is just to
    explain why I often miss many options in programs.\r\n\r\nMichel\r\n\r\n"

    my needs.
