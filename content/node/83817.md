  body: "There is a connection, although doubt anyone at News Corp. remembers it.
    When Rupert Murdoch bought New York magazine in the late '70s, the text was set
    in Life. Coming in as art director in '79, I remember thinking, \"Hell is this?\"
    \r\n\r\nI thought it was just a Times Roman clone, like \"Press Roman\" from IBM
    or the hideous English Times\u2014artifacts of the era when fonts were not interchangeable
    on different machines and the manufacturers refused to license them in order to
    sell more machines. It probably was a clone. I am not sure when Linotype started
    releasing Times, although the London newspaper evidently was set on Linotype machines,
    \ but it was not until after the war. And Monotype did not license the design
    to anyone else, at least where we could get it in the U.S. \r\n\r\nFrancesco Simoncini
    is remembered as a type designer, but his matrix factory made good fonts for the
    Linotype machine, and I have to think they must have been cheaper in Europe, or
    he wouldn't have been so successful. LIke earlier Italian foundries such as Nebiolo,
    Simoncini's versions of classic styles were often as good as or better than anyone
    else's. Garamond comes to mind. \r\n\r\nAnd as Life is an interesting version
    of Times, these foundries made interesting versions of styles that were in demand\u2014and
    designs not available license. Of course there was rampant metal type piracy using
    electrotypes, but if you had any volume you thought about making punches, once
    you start making a punch, you might as well design your own. Simoncini needed
    to make hard matrices not just foundry type, and he had real design talent.\r\n\r\nIn
    the late 70s New York magazine was set on a Mergenthaler VIP, not a Linotype machine,
    although the magazine must have been set in hot metal when MIlton Glaser and Walter
    Bernard designed it. \r\n\r\nAfter moving to the magazine a few years after Murdoch
    had swept away Clay Felker, Milton and Walter (a Glaser crony, J. C. Suares, had
    kept Life as the body type in the interim) I got to see it's quirky personality.
    Love that \"r\". And I appreciated that Life stod a little away from Times, which
    had already become over-familiar. I started using it for headlines as well. Seem
    to remember that VGC had photo display version.  \r\n\r\nSo when I saw Rupert's
    apology ad, the font seemed to fit perfectly.\r\n\r\n*     *     *\r\n\r\nAll
    of this makes me think about how much type design we've lost with the successive
    technology changes during my working lifetime. Francesco Simoncini died in the
    mid-70s, but the company was still offering matrices at Drupa in 1979. (Which
    you could buy and install on an East German Neotype typesetting machine, which
    was being sold in another exhibit hall.) Simoncini had absorbed Alder Traldi,
    which did its own quirky versions of classic styles. Few were ever digitized.
    \r\n\r\nThere are dozens of foundries whose designs are lost. Adler & Traldi was
    absorbed by Simoncini, and disappeared as well. And don't get me started on Nebiolo.
    Ludwig & Mayer, which had a partnership with Simoncini, persisted longer than
    most, and its library went to Neufville, but only some of the fonts have been
    digitized. Of course there are plenty of others in Europe and the U.S., whose
    legacy exists only in our memories.\r\n\r\nViva Simoncini!\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Roger, I\u2019ve been researching the history of 20th century typefaces in
    Italy for several years now and I did my Reading MATD dissertation on three designs
    by the Officine Simoncini. While it is true as you say that most of their catalogue
    was reissuing typefaces in the style of other established designs, Francesco Simoncini
    also made two very original contributions to the field of typeface design. The
    typefaces Delia & Selene, the former designed for classified ads and telephone
    directories, and the latter a news face, are very experimental and I would say
    even unprecedented. I\u2019m not sure a direct revival of these designs would
    be necessarily useful, because they were tied to the printing technologies of
    their time, but they can teach us a trick or two on designing typefaces for today
    and tomorrow\u2019s needs. \r\n\r\nAnd the influence of Simoncini Garamond and
    of the \u201CEinaudi house style\u201D in the typographic landscape of present-day
    Italy shouldn't be underestimated. I did an informal study and at least 1/3 of
    the best-selling books in Italy as of about a year ago were still set in Simoncini
    Garamond. It is the face we are most used to read in Italy.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately
    my research had to take the back burner due to my work relocation to California
    and other priorities, but I do hope to get back to it and finally publish my dissertation
    one day. It needs a lot of cleaning up work and some further wrapping up of a
    couple of loose ends but i hope it\u2019ll make for an interesting read once it\u2019s
    out. Oh and I also need to close some minor details like finding a publisher ;-)"

  body: "Adler Traldi (no \u201C&\u201D in the middle, I believe) was indeed acquired
    by Simoncini, but I still haven\u2019t found a good catalogue of the Traldi typefaces
    nor an inventory of exactly what got bought. Unfortunately a lot of the institutional
    knowledge about the Officine Simoncini died with Francesco. I am in touch two
    former employees and managed to interview them and put together some pieces of
    the puzzle, but it hasn'\u2019t been easy. Another thing that should be done is
    for someone to study the Officine from an industrial point of view. For example,
    they built all the machines to make the Linotype matrices and later on the photocomposition
    equipment by themselves, from scratch. Simoncini studied as an engineer at Ducati
    and started his career there, and then after the war decided to take over his
    father\u2019s Linotype repairing business & thus the Officine were born. Unfortunately
    my expertise is in typefaces and not in mechanics, but I\u2019m sure there are
    many more interesting stories to come out the Simoncini history. \r\n\r\nOh, and
    I almost forgot: viva Simoncini, indeed!"

  body: "<cite>LIke earlier Italian foundries such as Nebiolo, Simoncini's versions
    of classic styles were often as good as or better than anyone else's.</cite>\r\n\r\nAfter
    past discussions we had, I have come to agree with Antonio that the specific value
    of Simoncini and Nebiolo contributions to our cultural heritage have been differently
    focused. Like you say, Simoncini typefaces were qualitatively excellent, and they
    focused on booksetting-aimed types. Nebiolo started earlier, but they concentrate
    more on \"commercial\" types, not in a deprecable sense, they just privileged
    types for commercial printing and the production of booksetting types was more
    limited, and of course we were in different times.\r\nNebiolo arrived quite late
    with original designs, compared to Germany, probably other european countries,
    or the United States, and this was mostly thanks to Raffaello Bertieri, which
    promoted the setting up of the internal studio, supported by the passion of the
    then-young Alessandro Butti.\r\nBefore 1924 the Nebiolo types were in their majority
    copies of german or american designs. Butti and Bertieri changed that.\r\nBertieri
    promoted also the expansion of the Inkunabula family, often used for art books,
    which was designed by Nebiolo initially in 1911, for the Turin International Exposition.
    Back then, only a size was cut, but then, as the studio was being set up, Butti
    under the direction of Bertieri added the other size masters, an Italic and a
    decorative incised version.\r\n\r\nWhile Antonio has been concentrating on Simoncini,
    I tended to focus more and more on this period of Nebiolo. My research is occasional,
    and I see this reflects my different interest in type production, which is more
    cultural than industrial, but of course we may see the industrialization as part
    of the cultural change around the turn of the century.\r\n\r\nLet's say I'm in
    the 1920s, while Antonio is in the 1950s and 1960s.\r\nThis kind of research is
    not easy, anyway, even if you are in Italy\u2026 :)"

  body: "This is great insight into the Italian scene, and I am a big fan. Sorry about
    the Adler typo. I actually have an Adler Traldi specimen pamphlet (also from Drupa
    1986), and will look for it in what could be politely called my archives. My memory
    is that it included a few  Simoncini designs available for hand-setting.\r\n\r\nDid
    not mean to indicate that Francesco Simoncini's legacy was merely a interpreter
    of popular styles, as was the case with Life. But there was a lot of that work
    to be done at every foundry in the era before licensing, and as Matthew Carter
    showed at Bitstream, that can take a lot of your time, but if you do it right
    you can often improve on the originals. This was clearly the case with Simoncini,
    and seems to be the Italian way.\r\n\r\nNebiolo falls into three eras. The early
    semi-generic library, including Egiziano, the font that led me to Nebiolo in the
    first place. I started using a Phototypositor settings of that typeface from the
    the Ryder type house in Chicago in 1970. Ryder told me that VGC had released Egiziano
    font, but it was not the same. I wrote a letter to them asking what was going
    on, and got a memorable, huffy reply stating that their font was licensed from
    Nebiolo and made from \"inkless conversions.\" A letter to Nebiolo was answered
    promptly, but they could not provide any information on the history of the typeface.
    They imagined it was inspired by an American style, but their records were lost
    \"due to war events.\"\r\n\r\nAlso from that pre-1924 era were a multitude of
    sans serifs in different widths and weights, and an impressive array of engraver-quality
    called, I seem to remember,  \"Fretti, Fili e Filetti.\"\r\n\r\nThe second I think
    of as the Raffaello era, and then of course is the Aldo Novarese era. \r\n\r\nSo
    far very view of the great designs from Torino have been digitized. We're still
    missing fonts from Inkunabula and Rafaello (I don't know if that font is by Bertieri)
    to Recta and Simplicit\xE1. And on to Forma and Datillo, which are vastly better
    than any sans or slab of the last 20 years, but are lost to the digital world.

  body: "@Roger: I think the simple division you make may be pratical somehow, but
    does not reflect the rich and complex transitions of Nebiolo along the years.\r\nBertieri\u2019s
    contribution has been unvaluable, not just because he promoted the setup of the
    internal studio, but for all that he did as a publisher and more.\r\n\r\nIt was
    my desire to start a filological digital version of Inkunabula in my spare time,
    but in the end I opted for other things, which otherwise would be very unlikely
    to see the light.\r\n\r\nIn my opinion, there are no digital versions satisfying
    me, as of now, respecting the lead sizes masters. But I think this goes for the
    majority of the most important lead types of the 19th and 20th century.\r\nI don\u2019t
    like at all the way people tend to approach \"revivals\"."
