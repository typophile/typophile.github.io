body: "I'm working on a web project where I need/want to use a monospace as the primary
  typeface. This isn't a design question per se, but in general, what can be done
  to set text in a monospace in a way that makes it easier to read? And if there are
  specific suggestions to one of the primary monospace web fonts, that would be great
  too.\r\n\r\nSo far, what I am thinking is that leading should be greater than normal,
  since the extreme vertical orientation of the type creates a pattern that breaks
  up the left to right flow essential to ease of reading. But going too far is almost
  too easy since the x-height is so extreme.\r\n\r\nIf you were forced to use a monospace,
  what would you do?\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    this: <em>font-family: Consolas, Lucida Console, Monaco, monospace;</em>, or this:
    <em>font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;</em>\r\n\r\nhttp://unitinteractive.com/blog/2008/06/26/better-css-font-stacks/"

  body: "Note that Courier New has a really narrow stroke-width. In Windows it gets
    beefed up under ClearType rendering. That \"fix\" isn't in the iPhone or Mac OS,
    AFAIK, so might want to specify Courier before Courier New - or at least verify
    the site on Mac, Windows and iPhone.\r\n\r\nCheers, Si  "

  body: "I think you will need real large leading (line-height), because of the huge
    word-spacing of the monospaced font, say 12px/20px, even for relatively narrow
    colums. You could try to reduce word spacing a bit, say -0.1em also \u2026\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Courier, as Bud intended it, can only be acceptable when metal ball hits
    ribbon producing imprint on typewriter grade paper. You can digitize the image
    on the ball (as Monotype did) and produce an anemic hairline font. Or you can
    digitize the image on the paper, producing what amounts to a clich\xE9. Or you
    can try for something in between. \r\n\r\nWhat's missing is that they was not
    designed or intended for the screen, or for regular printing processes. \r\n"

  body: "\"...in general, what can be done to set text in a monospace in a way that
    makes it easier to read..\"\r\nSome monospaced fonts were digitized from an actual
    point size. Using a font digitized from a size and at that size, is the best you
    can do. So e.g., if a monospaced font says 10 pitch, use is usually best at 12
    point. Bitstream's Courier 10 Pitch is based on the daisywheel plus a little if
    you are looking for accuracy to an original size/pitch for print... but you are
    doing a web project, so you're screwed in two dimensions \u2014 if the monospacing
    alone does not harm the type  the rendering certainly will. The one way to make
    the rendering better on the web is to enlarge, and poke-in-de-eye! it's monospaced.
    I'd refuse on the grounds of \"You hired me!\", or at least distance myself from
    all and any credit. Hope this helps.\r\n\r\nCheers!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
