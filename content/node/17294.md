    An alternate may be '<a href=\"http://www.typodermic.com/fonts/16.html\" target=\"_blank\">Zekton</a>',
    a typeface that originally started out as a free font by Ray Larabie; <a href=\"http://image2.myfonts.com/textimage/c0/c003d5163e29f93e9ea25a57da55a1c2.png\"
    target=\"_blank\">Just cut the angles of 'C', 'S' and 'E', leave the 'H' and 'connect'
    the 'A'</a>  )</em>\r\n\r\n<em>( It may sound rude, But, That '<a href=\"http://www.whitestone.ac/clients/2006/typeface.htm\"
    target=\"_blank\">Welcome / 2006 FIFA World Cup Germany</a>' type has to be one
    of the 'oddest', Ive seen in a while, Sorry, That just looks like one of those
    'trendy' free fonts )</em>\r\n\r\nDav"

  body: Chase used to use Eurostile as it's logotype, and I think this is in some
    ways an update of that.

    'Zekton' :)\r\n<em>( Look at the 'S' and the 'E' for example, they are slightly
    'top heavy', like 'Zekton' )</em>\r\n\r\nDav"
