  to design a business card to attract a bit more attention but i've been working
  on it for the last 3-4 hours and still have a absolutely nothing.\r\n\r\nI've only
  recently got into typography in the last 2-3 months and have been reading up and
  study alot of articles & books.\r\n\r\nI know what I want it to look like but it's
  hard to actually get it down because all the fonts i've had i've tried and i have
  no money at the minutes so I can't buy anymore at the minute.\r\n\r\nI seem to work
  my best when i'm overly tired and my minds wandering because i come up with some
  crazy ideas and find it easier to put down but I can't do that now.\r\n\r\nSo i'm
  basically asking is there anything specific needed when you design in terms of conditions
  etc.\r\n\r\nI was thinking of doing a wordsearch on the front of the business card
  and then on the back my details as words to find but after some research i've found
  it's been done before and i want to try something unique.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance.\r\n\r\nI'm
  only a young 'un so take it easy on me :)"

    myself but haven't had much work so would like to get noticed more.

  body: "I would really consider the materials. Second, consider the fundamentals
    of design rather than trends and flash. I would guess that something clean and
    well constructed would be more likely to attract good attention.\r\n\r\nAre you
    doing letterhead and envelope as well?"

  body: "\"I know what I want it to look like\" - What's the problem then? :)\r\n\r\nIf
    you haven't done so, try getting away from the computer.\r\n\r\nBring a sketchbook
    with you to the park or some other place you can relax and let your mind run.\r\n\r\n<em>\"If
    you hit a wrong note, it\u2019s the next note that you play that makes it good
