  ideas concerning a  font, that I could use as a logo, for the game. I'd like the
  font to be, easy to read,  energetic, and to have a smidgeon of quirkiness. I don't
  mind paying, for the right font, as long as the price isn't too excessive. \r\n\r\nThanks\r\nDon"

    much energy - can't even look at it some days...\r\nAnd though Letraset sells
    fonts at $39.95 -- Linotype always seems to re-release it at $24.00\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/shatter/\r\n\r\nBut
    I think we should all keep on looking - looking beyond that written description...."

  body: "Hi,\r\n\r\n   Thanks for the advice everyone. I really appreciate it\r\n
    \ Jackie, Shatter is a bit too energetic for my liking.\r\n  Stephen, Wubble doesn't,
    IMHO, have enough energy.    \r\n  Spire, your suggestions are pretty spot on.
    Comicraft has a lot of suitable fonts and I really like Zoinks, and, at this stage,
    is probably the one I'm going to purchase.    \r\n   However before I do, can
    anyone suggest any other font sites similar to comicraft. Who knows the perfect
    font could be just one click away....\r\n\r\nThanks once again \r\nDon"

  body: "How about starting with the idea of animated typography, ie type that physically
    moves.\r\nYou would need a type with variants, such as Reliq, with Active/Calm
    axis.\r\nYou could have animated gifs online, for the logo and/or headlines.\r\nDont'
    suggest movement, show it."
