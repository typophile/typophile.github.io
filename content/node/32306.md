body: "Would appreciate some Scandinavian expertise. How thick is the slash on an
  oslash (in a regular weight)? Is it just a matter of personal taste or is there
  a 'right' thickness?\r\n\r\n(Secondly, how do you get the search function on the
  home page to work? I've tried entering in my search term and pressing return and
  nothing happens.)"

  body: "I've seen everything from a hairline stroke to stem-width. I don't think
    there's any \"right\" thickness, but I usually find it looks best if the slash
    in the \xF8 is slightly less than stem-width. If nothing else, you can argue that
    \xF8 quickly gets far to \"dark\". "

  body: Firstly it depends on the pen metaphor used in the face in question, secondly
    it depends on the optical correction needed to keep the counters open and such.

  body: "so have I, on a very condensed sans-serif. But generally I don't think the
    slash should extend above the x-height like that. (Claus is of course right about
    pen metaphor, and that might dictate otherwise).\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/lucidagrande_3643.jpg]"

  body: "Nicks example is in general not recommended. It is frowned upon by the users
    of \xF8. The slash really has to go all the way through. Exceptions (like Futura
    XB) can be found, but these cuts are very rarely used in real life."
