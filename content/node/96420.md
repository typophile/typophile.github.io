  \"best\" font pirates out there.\r\n\r\nMost of the time, I send a DCMA, but since
  this site is accepting money, it's a bit different. Fortunately, there is no honor
  among thieves: it doesn't seem that this guy's strategy of posting fonts for profit
  is working out all that well.\r\n\r\nAny suggestions on how to proceed? I doubt
  this guy is going to care about a DCMA notice.\r\n\r\nJDooley"

    no longer supporting Turkish. I kid you not.

  body: "Simon: funny.\r\n\r\nJeremy, the strategy of not supporting (or better: charging
    extra for) languages where piracy is rampant is interesting, and not without merit.
    Speaking of Latin-using languages, most of them don't have unique letters/diacritics
    (making the idea unworkable -or at least more intractable- for those) but Turkish
    does have some unique characters.\r\n\r\nIt's interesting to consider why there's
    a high degree of [font] piracy among Turks (assuming that's actually true) and
    the role that Atat\xFCrk inadvertently played in the lives of designers of Latin
    type!\r\n\r\nI confess that being Armenian I have long thought of doing something
    \"special\" with respect to Turkish support in fonts... But I would need to make
    sure it comes across as a political statement, not an ethnic bias. On the flip-side,
    I have to think it's actually politically advantageous for an Armenian to produce
    fonts that are used a lot (paid or not) by Turks* so it might be better for an
    Armenian to make sure his fonts support Turkish very well... Dunno.\r\n\r\n* In
    the same way that I was more than happy to give a talk at ISType.\r\nhttp://www.istype.com/?p=776\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "I am somewhat confusticated: do the \u201Coriginal\u201D fonts support Turkish
    or not? If so, then a knock-off is a knock-off; if not, then there is at least
    a presenting cause for the piracy. Not that pirates need a good rationalization,
    but\u2026\r\n\r\nI must admit that I overlooked the Turkish character set for
    many years, until Hasbro Toys commissioned a special version of Boyz R Gross NF,
    which included Turkish and Greek. Needless to say, the Turkish characters were
    a breeze, compared to my first foray into Greek characters. Fortunately for me,
    the good folks at Hasbro were patient: my first Greek alphabet was simply too
    narrow\u2014who knew?\u2014and they supplied me with the words which needed kerning
    pairs. Anyhow, it all worked out: I got an impromptu kid Seal of Approval the
    other day at Wal-mart.\r\n\r\nHrant, waddaya gonna do with the  Turks? They have
    been around for a long time\u2014http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turanians\u2014and
    their sphere of influence is growing progressively smaller. When the Ottomans
    captured Constantinople in 1492 (sound familiar?), they broke the two-millennium
    hold of the Greeks on the Hellespont, and shaped world history\u2014for better
    or for worse\u2014for almost five hundred years after. World War I put paid to
    most of the divine-right monarchies, and the thoroughly screwed up British political
    subdivisions of the Ottoman Empire has been having negative effects on geopolitics
    for almost a hundred years. An independent Kurdistan\u2014the sooner, the better\u2014will
    leave Turkey with very little of their former turf, which will be a tough nut
    for the Turks to swallow.\r\n\r\nSorry: I tend to digress...all my fonts support
    Turkish now, so I think I may be okay."

  body: It's a difficult thing because it's beneficial for type designers to know
    the websites involved when their work is pirated. But I guess it shouldn't be
    public too. Hopefully <a href="http://www.typophile.com/node/95431">TypeSnitch</a>
    will help with this sort of thing.

    not going to pursue the state dept route, but it's a good thought. They are probably
    a bit busy bracing for a firebombing right now as Turkey is trending further and
    further away from Ataturk secularism. Interestingly, my father is an expert in
    international law has actually done treaty negotiations and large labor contracts
    in Turkey for the US government, so the irony is that if I wanted to go that route
    I'd have some names at State to start with :). Thank you all for your suggestions."

    though Typophile is the best place to talk type, there are simply too many people
    here who like fonts... as long as they're free. Just check out the type-ID action.
    Or Typophile could start a subscription-based \"people who really care about fonts\"
    subforum where nasty sites can be exposed with little worry about promoting piracy.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
