body: "The unicode codecharts specifically state that the sample glyphs shown are
  not intended to be normative, but I'm wondering how much leeway is actually intended.
  I'm specifically interested in symbol/picture characters rather than characters
  from actual scripts.\r\n\r\nAs a concrete example, both Linotype Astrology Pi No.
  1 and Linotype Astrology Pi No. 2 include glyphs in the range U+2648 through U+2653
  (i.e. zodiacal symbols). The glyphs in LAP#1 closely match the symbolic representations
  shown in the standard whereas those in LAP#2 contain pictorial representations of
  these signs which bear no resemblance to the glyphs shown in the standard. This
  seems legitimate, though, since each set of glyphs match the <em>descriptions</em>
  given in the standard (aries, taurus, etc.)\r\n\r\nHowever, I'm wondering about
  cases where the description given in the standard describes an actual _shape_.\r\n\r\nFor
  example, in the standard U+26E8 is described as BLACK CROSS ON SHIELD (=hospital).
  Would it be inappropriate to encode a glyph in this slot such as the hospital glyph
  from Adobe Carta (encoded in the private use area at U+E02D) despite the fact that
  it is actually a white cross on a black circle?\r\n\r\nNote that the above is just
  an example. I'm just trying to get a feel for whether the graphic description takes
  priority or whether a graphic or semantic match is sufficient (or near-match for
  that matter - with pictorial symbols in some cases the semantics are a bit fuzzy).\r\n\r\nn.b.
  I'm pretty sure Adobe Carta was released before this codepoint had been defined,
  so their decision to use a PUA codepoint is not revealing of their take on the matter.\r\n\r\nAndr\xE9"

  body: "Generally speaking, this has to be determined by criteria external to the
    Unicode Standard. Such criteria have to take into account user expectations, and
    must reflect the degree to which a certain shape is normative in a particular
    usage. The zodiac symbols are a good example, because users employ both symbolic
    and graphical representations; hence the Linotype Astrology font approach makes
    good sense in supporting both usages.\r\n\r\nWhere a Unicode character name does
    specify something like particular colour arrangement -- e.g. black on white --
    then that can usually be expected to form user expectation, such that someone
    may legitimately complain if this character is represented in white on black.
    If U+26E8 were simply named CROSS ON SHIELD, then I think reversing the colours
    would be legitimate and while some users might not like it they would have no
    grounds to complain.\r\n\r\nNote that some mathematical symbols in Unicode have
    recognised variant forms that are meant to be displayable using Variation Selector
    code. This is supported in OpenType using a format 14 cmap table, which maps combinations
    of character code and VS codes to glyph variants."

  body: "Thanks for the reply. Your position on U+26E8 makes sense.\r\n\r\nMore generally,
    what I'm trying to decide is, when encoding a pi font, whether it's better to
    assign non-PUA unicode values to symbols only when an exact match can be found,
    or whether a 'close' match is sufficient.\r\n\r\nI'd prefer to avoid PUA codepoints
    where a more appropriate assignment exists. The big problem here, though, is figuring
    out exactly what constitutes a close match. The standard doesn't always specify
    why certain symbols were encoded in the first place, which makes it difficult
    to figure out whether a precise shape might be expected in some technical contexts.\r\n\r\nAndr\xE9"

    ScriptSource community have been adding Unicode Status pages for various scripts
    just because the background information for characters is, as you've found, difficult
    to find.  I'm glad you have found the info helpful, but please understand that
    this is a work-in-progress -- and we invite anyone with relevant knowledge to
    contribute to the project.\r\n\r\nI would point out that for characters that have
    been in Unicode for a long time documentation is both harder to find and, in a
    practical sense, generally less important to developers. For that reason ScriptSource
    contributors have focused on characters added more recently.\r\n\r\nCase in pont:
    the zodiac characters you mention (U+2648, U+2653) are very old -- dating back
    to Unicode 1.1."
