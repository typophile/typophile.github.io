  body: "This just looks like a confused mish-mash of Lexicon, Sylfaen and I don't
    know what else. It will take a lot of \"retrofitting\" to be worthwhile. The other
    one is not a text face like this one, and it might not be entirely original, but
    to me it looks closer to something people would want to use.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "My main impression is a certain inconsistency in weight distribution: The
    thin parts of letters don't have the same optical thinness from one letter to
    the next; the same is true of the thick parts; serifs and terminals vary in size
    and weight from one letter to the next; that sort of thing. Up close, there are
    also some issues with detailing (rare but exaggerated ink traps, coarse curves)
    and proportions (e.g., the /c is too wide compared with the /e).\r\n\r\nDon't
    despair: This reminds me a lot of my first typeface on Typophile... it was an
    attempt at a text face, too, and it had much more serious problems than yours.
    Like you, I had a second project for a modern-style display face going. People
    recommended I concentrate on display fonts for a while, and that was very helpful.
    Display fonts are less harsh in terms of requirements and they have more room
    for \"quirkiness\", so they're a good place to refine one's skills while still
    having fun and being productive. After more than a year of display faces, I am
    now back to my original text face, and it's going much better now. :) Hang in
    there!"

      the first time I tried a text face and it\xB4s more kind of research ..."
