  mentions that it \"takes a lot of work\" to use Dante. Would someone please tell
  me why?\r\n\r\nI've got a license for it  (that is, Dante MT Pro) and I plan on
  using it with the following:\r\n\r\nTrue 1200dpi laser printer\r\nPages (iWork)
  + InDesign\r\n24lb 8 1/2 x 11 linen (a nice creamy colour)\r\n\r\nTypographic details:\r\n\r\nMargins:
  1.57\" left and right, 1\" top/bottom\r\nFont size/leading: 12.5/14.5\r\nAvg. 10-12
  words per line \r\n\r\nI've just printed off a paragraph and it looks gorgeous.
  Textism says that \"Of the widely-used book typefaces of the North American mid-20th
  century . . . Giovanni Mardersteig\u2019s Dante is, to my eye, the only one to have
  had a successful translation to digital from metal.\"\r\n\r\nIt certainly isn't
  as spindly and anemic as the others, but it isn't a heavy face either, like Dolly
  or Feijoa. I find it extremely easy to read. This OpenType version seems quite handy.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\n\r\nChristian."

  body: "Hi Christian. I'm trying to remember everything about Dante that made it
    high-effort, but I'm pretty sure the uneven spacing/kerning was one thing. It's
    also been several years since I used it and that may have been fixed in the most
    recent Pro version.\r\n\r\nDean Allen is right that Dante survived the digital
    transition very well, but <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/fontfont/ff_clifford_pro/\">FF
    Clifford</a> has replaced Dante as my favorite traditional text face."

  body: "Many thanks, Stephen.\r\n\r\nDante looks fine in this \"Pro\" version. Then
    again I'm not as experienced as you are so I might be missing something. In any
    case, it's still nice to have Dante in one's collection. In light of the tragedy
    that is digital Fairfield and Electra, I think we got lucky with Dante. \r\n\r\nFF
    Clifford. Nice and meaty. It reminds me of the paperbacks I used to love reading,
    with all that dark, sturdy type. These days I usually look to Dutch type when
    in need of a text face, say, Arnhem or Dolly. Feijoa is high on my lis as well,
    though it isn't really Dutch. Kiwi humanist maybe? \r\n\r\nC"
