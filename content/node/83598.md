  typefaces? I always thought it's not possible to patent a design based on the alphabet,
  but it is possible and George Bruce did it in 1842: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_patent
  \  (look under 'Notabale design patents').\r\nI want to be up to date before I give
  out a statement, and it seems that my thoughts on this topic were not accurate.\r\n\r\nAny
  thoughts on this?"

    of patent. The same steps, costs, etc...\r\nIn the case of typefaces, there is
    so much prior art that your typeface is bound to be similar to in some ways that
    I can't imagine attempting it without professional (and expensive) legal help.\r\nMind
    if I ask what the purpose is? In other words, what do you hope to gain?\r\n\r\nrich"

    my graphic design studio and this is one of the topics out there. Someone pointed
    out that it's possible to patent a font, so I want to do some research and update
    my article.\r\n\r\n@Nick: Will do! I did a search before, but didn't find anything
    usefull though. I'll click a bit deeper in the search results.  ;-)"
