  books (not talking about World's Classics), particularly books published in the
  '60s and was wondering\r\nif anyone here is familiar with them. It's a font I've
  seen in most of their books from that period, it is perhaps a version of garamond
  or janson.\r\nI'll try and post some photos tomorrow if no one is familiar with
  the topic offhand.\r\nCheers."

    by Matthew Carter, based on a design by Berthold Wolpe. You can see a sample from
    the Serif Font ID Guide <a href=\"http://bowfinprintworks.com/SerifGuide/serifsamples/serif_op/pegasus_full.gif\">here</a>.
    Is that the typeface you were interested in? (As far as I know it is not available
    to the general public)\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

    1937 Wolpe design was done in 1982, so if you really mean the 1960's, then I guess
    we'll need to see your sample to ID it.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

    and to my eyes, more conspicuosly antique.\r\nI'll try to take some samples tomorrow.\r\n(Many
    of the books I'm thinking of, are part of OUP's Oxford English Texts series.\r\n\r\n\r\n "

  body: "Here are the samples. I'm pretty sure it is a version of garamond (could
    be wrong), but I'd like to know which precisely. That numeral 5 is slightly odd,
    and I think I've seen it in a font somewhere.\r\nThe book is Jonathan Swift's
    'A Tale of a Tub', a 1973 reprint of a 1958 edition.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Billede

  body: "I think <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/bitstream/caslon-old-face/\">Caslon
    Old Face</a> looks very close. Notice the top of the A, and certain other earmarks,
    such as the Roman and italic 'g'. There is a Lanston version called Oldstyle 337,
    which may be closer, looking at the FontBook sample, but I couldn't immediately
    find it online. There is likely to be a disconnect between existing digital type
    and the metal type that was probably used for printing the books, but that is
    my pick so far, as the closest version of Caslon.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

    easier, such as C, Q, y, M, K, R and W. You could try using the <a href=\"http://bowfinprintworks.com/SerifGuide/serifsearch.php\">Serif
    Font ID Guide</a>, if you have some of those letters, since they are shown in
    the key samples. You can select 'close' ones and compare them further against
    each other, including the italics for many of the fonts.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

      didn't see that. Probably because I don't have a great liking for Adobe's Caslon.\r\n"

    (see link below, I'm not grasping the HTML instructions below) suggests that the
    font may be a variant of Caslon called \"Imprint,\" designed in 1913 by Ernest
    Jackson and Edward Johnston; it \"later became the favorite typeface of Oxford
    University Press.\" The capital \"J\" in my book resembles Imprint more than it
