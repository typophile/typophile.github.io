  body: I'd also like to know  because with some fonts I find that italic does not
    stand out enough (for transparencies) and bold (or even semibold) is too agressive
    and the corresponding italic looks more pleasant. My intent is not double insistance.
    In a mathematical definition, the term that is being defined is normally put in
    italic.

    you mean a typeface bold in appearance or a typeface with (also a) bold style?\r\nThe
    first were used as a mean of emphasis and differentiation before the invention
    of the latter."

    Was it already there during the French Renaissance?\r\n\r\n\xB6 In the XIX th

  body: "> Bold italic implies a double emphasis. Why?\r\n\r\nThere are situations
    where the copywriter will specify italic (titles of books, plays or albums, to
    emphasize a word in a sentence, etc). If that sentence is already in bold, you
    need bold italic."

  body: Pretty much what JamesM said. If you need to italicise a word in a bolded
    paragraph, you need bold italic. Bold is occasionally used in text for "darker
    spot on the page that you see immediately" emphasis (I do it myself in emails
    to make them easier to parse, or when a new key term is introduced in an academic
    paper) but more often in serious typographic settings for entire sections, for
    instance in newspaper ledes. (And of course for headings, display type, in tables
    etc.)
