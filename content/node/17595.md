body: "Dear forum members,\r\n\r\ni was asking myself whether it is necessary to keep
  the overall width of the single caracters, when they are combined to a ligature.
  So, if \"f\" has x width, and \"i\" y width, does the width of the fi-ligature have
  to be x+y or can it be narrower?\r\n\r\nPro same width: character combinations can
  be replaced by ligs without reflowing the text\r\nContra same width: ligs appear
  to be too wide sometimes\r\n\r\nAdobe seems to go the way to make ligs narrower
  than single chars. What about other foundries?\r\n\r\nThanks for your answers\r\nSebilar"

  body: 'It seems like it would depend almost completely on the face. For instance
    the color and the line weight, would affect the way the spacing of the ligatures
    would look and fit in. And if you did want a universal rule, ligatures should
    be a little narrower, because they were created to compensate for the extra space
    the single letters left, in lead. '

  body: The more enclosed a white space, the larger it appears to be, so ligatures
    should be actually narrower for optical equality (if that's what you want, which
    you probably should if you're representing two or more characters, rather than
    joining two or more glyphs to represent one character). Van Krimpen sometimes
    went further, to no very good end.

  body: "As Julianene said, the norm is that ligs take up less space than the single
    letters. This may also have been a function of fitting characters on a line in
    setting lead type. Today, we have no hard boundaries with digital type and kerning
    and contextual alts have made the job easier for typesetting pros. Perhaps then
    today, the width of ligs is more about better matching of letter spaces than fitting
    to a line. I don't know what value there would be in an exact match to the separated
    glyphs, what reads best and then looks best seems more important.\r\n\r\nChrisL"

  body: "Typically, the ligatures take up less space. One of the things that might
    be a goal in the design of the ligatures is to maintain the visual rhythm of vertical
    stems in text. Once you've finished spacing the typeface, come back to the ligatures
    and see how they look in text. Also check what the spacing is of the lowercase
    el or i. One possible rule of thumb is that the space between the two stems in
    the fi or fl ligature should be equivalent to the space between two els or two
    i's.\r\n\r\nOf course, the eye is the ultimate arbiter. That rule of thumb is
    most likely to lead one astray in the heaviest weights of a monoline sans serif....\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\n\r\nT"

    right. The counter of the fi is the same or slightly less than the counter of
    the n. The less the result of a more square (open) counter that can be slightly
    compressed to attain the same visual impact of n. fl then'd be slightly less in
    counter, slightly more right side bearing, and etc."

  body: "I'm throwing my lot in with the \"depends\" crowd. \r\n\r\nI have made fonts
    where ligatures were desirable or simply sexy, and I have also made fonts where
    the design not only doesn't require the fi and fl ligatures, but they look odd,
    so I simply make glyphs which are the two glyphs side-by-side, and therefor the
    same width as the two glyphs together.\r\n\r\nThere are two kinds of ligatures
    in the digital era: necessary and discretionary. The first are a solution to a
    problem posed by the design of the glyphs; a long-teardrop-terminal \"f\" for
    example. The latter are ligatures created by the designer to amuse themselves,
    recreate a historical effect, answer a request, etc."

  body: "Have you had the chance to take a look at the Bram de Does Trinit\xE9? Digital
    type (also)has this kind of characteristic: It can be drawn to overlap letters.
    In the specific case of Trinit\xE9, the 'f' has been drawn promiscously, in relation
    to pairs. of letters. The 'i' tip becomes the ending of the 'f', and they work
    as an assembly. This can give another perspective of the problem. On the other
    hand, there are typefaces drawn with the 'lead boundaries', so the 'f' cannot
    enter the space of other letters. That achieves the question: spacing or merely
    aestetics? Instead of two pieces of lead, we can have only one. Though, the spacing
    subject remains.\r\nPerhaps I'm radical, but I no longer think of the group 'fi'
    as two letters, but as one solo graphic symbol. With the use and abuse of the
    negative tracking, this leaves an issue to consider, doesn't it?"

    I think only the quest for the perfect column brings up issues like that. I hate
    to change the rhythm of text an I believe text should only be justified if the
    length of the line is superior to 20picas? Otherwise, as a good latin text composer,
    i would ragg right ;) Computers brought the negative leading, but sometimes I
    think a virus should be created, in order to make programs like Quark or InDesign,
    but Word at most respect the \"laws of the lead\". Perhaps it would improve something?
