  body: "The only font I can think of with an R and A like this is [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/castletype/xavier/|Xavier]],
    but Xavier is either sans or serif, and neither matches very well with your sample.
    In particular the N in your sample has a flat vertex at the basline, not a pointed
    one.\r\n\r\nPenumbra and Columna are flareserif faces, but they also have the
    pointed N.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: "I found another term -- spur serif. And this is used in the Phil's Photo
    book \"Homage to the Alphabet\" which shows a typeface called Solon Antiqua which
    happens to have the same A and R, as well as the flat N. This book was published
    in 1985, and I do not know of a digital version of Solon Antiqua. I think it's
    the answer to your font ID. \r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
