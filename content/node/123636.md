    [Heavy]\r\n\r\nThe look of the type at the top and bottom of the poster could
    also be replicated using Rama Gothic Condensed Bold, Champion Flyweight, or one
    of the following:\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/itc/roswell/ [Standard Three]\r\nhttp://www.typography.com/fonts/knockout/styles/
    [46 Flyweight]"

  body: "England 1908 -- the _1D_ means one pence and confirms the location. \r\nThis
    would have been a large scale font, perhaps wooden, inspired by the model of the
    Grotesque types that had been in use since Thorowgood's Grotesque of 1832. Stephenson
    Blake's various Grotesque font's may have been the source.  Grotesque No. 9 http://www.identifont.com/show?62O
    \ is similar to the main heading, but is slightly too wide.\r\nThe original specimens
    of the grotesques released by Stephenson Blake were used by David Berlow and others
    to produce a series for Font Bureau called Bureau Grot. http://www.identifont.com/find?font=Bureau+Grot&q=Go\r\nBut
    none of these is an exact match.\r\nFor the light weight condensed type you might
    consider the rather similar, but slightly too wide, DTD Silvertone Woodtype \r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/DTDSilvertoneWoodtypeAsVOTES_6699.gif][img:sites/default/files/old-images/DTDSilvertoneWoodtypeAsMRS_6526.gif]\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/thometz/silvertone-woodtype/
    \r\nwhich is based on Ludlow 6-EC Gothic Extra Condensed woodtype.\r\nSorren Bold,
    a neo-grotesque from 2012, is surprisingly close and would be my recommendation
    as a substitute [img:sites/default/files/old-images/SorenBoldAsVotes_4995.gif][img:sites/default/files/old-images/SorenBoldAsMRS_4960.gif]\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/reserves/sorren/\r\nStill
    looking for a closer match to _WELCOME CHRISTABEL PANKHURST_.\r\nDon"

    M is closer etc.

    composition typefaces \r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/ReformaGroteskBoldAsWELCOME_4683.gif][img:sites/default/files/old-images/ReformaGroteskBoldAsCHRISTABEL_5698.gif][img:sites/default/files/old-images/ReformaGroteskBoldAsPANKHURST_3791.gif]
    \r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/paratype/reforma-grotesk-bold-e/ is a very good
    match for the letterforms.\r\nEDITED:\r\nBut it is too light.\r\nDon"

    Reforma Bold it has generally matching letterforms. Rama Gothic Heavy is closer
    to the weight than Reforma Bold but is narrower.\r\nStill no perfect match.\r\nDon\r\n"

    as I did in this little exercise\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/PankAsWELCOME_SM_3958.jpg]\r\nTinkering
    with some of the suggested fonts might also work, but in my opinion the result
    it would perhaps be a poorer match than designing new letters.\r\nDon\r\n"
