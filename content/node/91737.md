  day of passing is widely observed in Russia, not only by the Orthodox faithful.
  \r\n\r\nVladimir Venediktovich Yefimov, the pre-eminent Russian type designer and
  typographic expert, known to his friends as Volodya, or <em>Jeff</em>, died on the
  23rd of February, at the age of 62.\r\n\r\nVladimir was born in Moscow on May 6,
  1949. He graduated from Moscow Printing Institute in 1973 with a major in graphic
  art and design. Vladimir began his career as a staff designer at the Type Design
  Department of the National Printing Research Institute (NIIPoligrafmash). His professional
  development was influenced by his senior fellow colleagues Mikhail Rovensky, Isay
  Slutsker, Lyubov\u2019 Kuznetsova, and Nikolay Kudryashov, all outstanding design
  professionals. From 1992 to 1998 Vladimir worked as a senior designer at ParaGraph
  International; in April 1998 he became one of the founders, and the art director,
  of ParaType, Inc. \r\n\r\nSince then Vladimir designed more than 60 type families
  (more than 200 type styles), of which many are now well known, without exaggeration,
  to any Cyrillic user. Among them are Pragmatica, Adver Gothic (1989), Newton (1990),
  Petersburg, Didona (1992), Octava (1966), ITC Charter Cyrillic and Kis Cyrillic
  (1999).\r\n\r\nVladimir\u2019s typefaces are widely recognized in the professional
  community world-wide for their superb quality. They won awards at many exhibitions
  and competitions, including the Certificate of Merit of the Academy of Graphic Design;
  the Grand Prix of the Golden Bee, Moscow International Biennial of Graphic Design;
  the Certificate of Design Excellence of the Type Directors Club, and others.\r\n\r\nVladimir
  taught a course in the history of type design at a number of Moscow-based design
  schools: Stroganov State University of Industrial Art; Higher Academical School
  of Graphic Design, British Higher School of Art and Design. \r\n\r\nHe authored,
  edited, and contributed to, many books on type design and typography, including
  a series \u2018Great typefaces\u2019 (Book 1: <em>The Beginnings</em>. Moscow: ParaType,
  2006; Book 2: <em>The Serifs</em>. Moscow: ParaType, 2007); <em>Language Culture
  Type: International Type Design in the Age of Unicode</em>, John D. Berry, ed. (New
  York: Graphis, 2002); Russian editions of Peter Karow\u2019s <em>Font Technology:
  Description and Tools</em> (Moscow, Mir Publishers, 2001), Erik Spiekermann\u2019s
  <em>\xDCber Schrift</em> (Moscow: ParaType, 2005), Robert Bringhurst\u2019s <em>The
  Elements of Typographic Style</em> (Moscow: D. Aronov, Publisher, 2008), Jan Tschichold\u2019s
  <em>The Form of the Book</em> (Moscow: Art. Lebedev Studio, 2008).\r\n\r\nVladimir\u2019s
  mastery of design, his talks at the international typographic fora, and his multiple,
  productive contacts with foreign colleagues, his profound and multi-faceted erudition,
  his irresistible charm and charisma\u2014have secured the international recognition
  of the achievements of the Russian type design school. It is not least due to his
  efforts that the type design and production in Russia has been revived, and has
  caught up with the current international level.\r\n\r\nVladimir was a full member
  of the Academy of Graphic Design (since 1995), and its Vice-President (since 2012),
  a member of the Association Typographique Internationale (since 1996), and a member
  of the Moscow Artist Union (since 1997).\r\n\r\nVladimir\u2019s typefaces, his books,
  his gentle charm and his lovely smile will remain with us forever. \r\n\r\n<em>Memory
  eternal</em>."

    dearly love to have a catalogue raison\xE9e of Vladimir's type design, i.e. a
    specimen gathering all his designs together, preferably in chronological order.
    It would be a splendid tribute as well as a useful resource."
