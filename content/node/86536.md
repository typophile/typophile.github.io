  can license the typeface but google turns up very little.\r\n\r\nIs it proprietary?\r\n\r\n<strong>Edit:</strong>\r\n\r\nSo
  as soon as I created this topic I found [[http://typophile.com/node/34023#comment-204547|this]]
  post, \r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\nFenway is NOT exclusive to publication designers...
  It can be licensed though Carter and Cone.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.carterandcone.com\r\n</blockquote>"

    not released in the Retail library yet, so it\u2019s not shown on the website;
    but I\u2019m pretty sure they do license it to publications through the Studio
    library. In addition to the original styles, work was done on Display and Banner
    versions."
