  body: "Michael,\r\nThank you for your effort...\r\nBefore I asked here I made a
    very good search online. The regular sites, amazon, and of course Google. And
    in fact I got the page that you refer. If you did not notice, that page refers
    to other sites (the page it self dont sell, its just a \"Media References and
    collectibles of all sorts\". In my case the \"DVD Systematisch Slordig\" goes
    to this [[http:www.nijhoflee.nl|site]] that aparently \"...has moved and is now
    part of the website of the \u2018Bijzondere Collecties\u2019 Library of the University
    of Amsterdam\". I did followed the link and came up to a [[https://bijzonderecollecties.hexspoorwms.nl/EN/webshop/nijhof-en-lee|another
    site]] and after a search I got result=0.\r\nThats why I asked help to my dear
    friends from typophile :)\r\n\r\nAnt\xF3nio\r\n"

  body: "As said above, Nijhof & Lee once had it, but the store has moved to the \u2018Bijzondere
    Collecties\u2019, during which most of the stock has been sold off.\r\n\r\nI believe
    it will be extremely tricky to get a copy of it, I know some of them are around,
    but all are in personal collections. And don't expect the TROS (The TV station
    which originally published it) to do a repress.\r\n\r\nGuess you'll have to lucky
    to run into one."
