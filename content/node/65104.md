  this font is? Or anything that is similar to it. It was used on this year's RCA
  journal.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/arc_3650.jpg]\r\n\r\nMany thanks!"

  body: Yes it looks very modified, how the strokes in the A and the R are overlapping
    and joining. So nice!

  body: Yes I agree with everyone here, it's absolutely stunning, so would greatly
    appreciate it if anyone does know what this font is! You'll be making a lot of
    typophiles happy :-)

  body: Argh. There must be someone who can identify it - even in its original format
    (if it was modified) Perhaps it is custom made from begining to end?

  body: "Because of the geometric nature of the lettering it seems quite possible
    to me that this was drawn the way a draftsman would have done it many years ago.
    Lex's suggestion sounds like a good way to approximate it, but perhaps start from
    a different sans than Johnston,something geometric, like one of the Neuzeit sans
    faces. They might have the serif on the J too.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
