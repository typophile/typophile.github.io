  Gotham and I'd like some ideas about which font would be nicely paired with it.\r\n\r\n-
  For copy text, should we use Gotham just for headlines and then a serif for the
  body text?\r\n\r\n- If so, what would you recommend that would look tasteful with
  Gotham.\r\n\r\nI am always humbled by the wealth of knowledge in these forums -
  thank you in advance.\r\n  \r\nSean"

    typeface, Gotham.

  body: H&FJ just wants you to buy more of their fonts. Gotham goes well with a lot.
    It's great as the strapline on a lot of logos. But I don't have any particular
    recommendations for pairings. If you find a font you like, we can tell you whether
    we think it goes well with Gotham, though.
