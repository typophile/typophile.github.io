  is there any way to scale font fallback to fit my design? Something other than designing
  Latin letters"

  body: "The apparent size and position of the letters at a certain point size (or
    pixel size), is determined by the size of the letters \u2013 for Latin fonts,
    the lowercase letters in particular \u2013 in relation to the units per em (UPM)
    and the vertical metrics in the font. The apparent size of Latin fonts also vary
    quite a bit though. Something that looks as big as Georgia, will look to big next
    to Garamond.\r\n\r\ntl;dr: it depends on how big the letters are relative to the
    size of the \xABem\xBB."

  body: "Hello\r\nYou have to redesign the Latins, but it is not too difficult. In
    Fontlab open a full-height Latin glyph like H, go to  Tools/Action/Contour/Scale
    tool to make a Latin outline smaller until it matches the required height and
    width you like to match the non-Latin. OK.  Command Z to redo and try another
    number.  Experiment with various vertical and horizontal percentages until you
    find a suitable scale.  You can apply the same scaling to all selected Latin glyphs.
    \r\n\r\nIf the resulting Latin outline is too thin, try the Tools/Action/Effects/Bold
    (and check the \"keep glyph dimensions\" box) and again experiment with how many
    points you want the stroke width and height to be increased by, to approximate
    the non-Latin. (Use negative numbers to make a font outline thinner).\r\nGood
    luck.  It will not be a perfect Latin, but at least it will not look too strange
    next to the non-Latin.  Can you post an example of the two scripts together?"

    hard and long time solution \r\n\r\nI just checked some non-Latin fonts like Google
    Droid Arabic, it doesn't has Latin letters but the font fallback is very scaled
    to arabic! \r\nhttp://www.google.com/fonts/earlyaccess\r\n\r\nThis is why I am
    looking for solution instead of designing Latin letters!\r\n\r\n"
