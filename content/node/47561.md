  I would like to hear Your sugggestions in this topic.\r\n\r\nI am in a process to
  redesign a lifestyle/fashion magazine in Arabic language, which is supposed to be
  very stylish and classy. I would like to hear some Arabic typefaces suggestions.
  I need 2 typefaces one for titles/display purposes, and one for reading (and this
  one is the pretty hard to find). Do I hear any suggestions?\r\n\r\nA."

  body: "hey,\r\n\r\nwell from my old notes here, arabic types are 2 types>> koufic
    (geometric) or Cursive.\r\n\r\nin Cursive we have the following kinds (which have
    under it many fonts):\r\nRiqaa: narrow short letter (newspapers - adertizing and
    headlines)\r\nFarisi: elegant impression\r\nthuluth: complicated for decorative
    and announcement caligraphic compositions\r\nnaqsh: daily writings\r\n\r\nfor
    body type check AXT Gihan AXT marwan\r\nAxt manal \r\n\r\nand Rhotes Sans\r\n\r\nim
    sure by now there are many new fonts out there, Boutros is one type foundary that
    are professional check their website! provides links. yaqout, and grapheast are
    other places that have professional fonts as well ....\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Hi!\r\n\r\nB: \r\n\r\nThank You, I know most of that, they wouldn't work
    for a fashion/life style magazine. AXT fonts have poor design and poor development
    too. Boutros may be the most nice typeface among them I know but I am not sure
    it has been designed to appeal for a fashion/ life style magazine. \r\n\r\nWhat
    I don't know is: \r\nI want to know how to find: Rhotes sans, Yaqout, grapheast.
    \r\n\r\n\r\nSii:\r\nI think Your suggestion makes a lot of sense to me, only I
    have 2 problems:the sheen doesn't look elegant. Another problem I find in most
    arabic font and annoies me is: the black is not enough in small sizes such as
    10/12 size. \r\n\r\nA."
