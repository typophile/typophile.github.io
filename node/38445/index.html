<div class=commentbody>Have you looked at the MUTCD? (Manual of Uniform Traffic Control Devices) its a mega tomb and not very modern but it does describe what is currently in place on the Federal Roadscape. Don Meeker, my partner in the Clearview project has developed a proportional grid design system he is currently trying to get the Feds to adopt. I know the system is very modular and basically sends a good portion of the MUTCD to the waste bin.
There may be some useful information on our Clearview web site:

<div class=commentbody>Thanks for all the replys.
To be more specific, I'm looking at :
-the history of the road sign-where the designs came from,
-the road signs in Ireland-European and Irish rules and regulations regarding the road sign,
-Readability and legibility of the signs-how they're affected by speed, size, positioning, colours, etc.
-Problems for road users
-Technological developments that coould help to communicate with the road user
Thanks again for all the replys. I'll have to get to reading them all now. If anyone has anything else to offer throw it in.</div>

Have a root around for Jock Kinnear & The Worboys committee for information on the implementation of British Road signs. I'm at work at the moment so can't help you much more but there are some articles in my bibliography that may help you.

<div class=commentbody>On a somewhat related topic, is anyone aware of <em>objective</em> published research that supports the idea that letters with tall x-heights, large counters and wide apertures are easier to read than smaller counters? I’m looking for articles other than the articles about Clearview, and for writing that is specific to type, as opposed to articles about psychology/cognition that can be interpreted for type.
This is an important part of my thesis, which I will post more about this weekend. Anyway, one of the judges I presented to today pointed out that these features, which typographers today have a tendency to treat as established fact, might very well be just a bunch of BS, in the same way that the notion of Helvetica and Univers being neutral didn’t really hold up after Swiss design dissipated. </div>

Not I. But the statement you make is but a subset of "the idea", dangerously cartooned in my opinion, in a way that can easily lead to brain freeze. The size of everything matters relative to the expected use of a type design for a given tone of voice...the typographic world around you should seem at least locally objective "published" proof...no?
"...might very well be just a bunch of BS..."

But that’s the problem—just looking around us and drawing conclusions provides us with anecdotal support, there’s a big difference between that and the way the Clearview team produced signs, tested them on a track, and published the results. The audience for my thesis work is organizational leaders—the sort of people who would be a lot more receptive to a designer’s anecdotes if they’re backed up by “science.”
<cite>You planning to print anything for this judge? ah kin halp ;-)</cite>
Oh, the things I am planning to do for this project… I’ll put up a big post about my thesis work soon, because I need better feedback than the suggestions I got. I’m pretty sure the Typophile crowd can do better than ”What about drawing some italics” or ”Get Matthew Carter to mentor you!”</div>

<div class=commentbody>James, my impression is that the state of research on what fonts are most readable is very shaky, However, the research done on Clearview seems to be some of the best, in that it is solid and not BS.
It is limited in applicability, though. The tests were for maximizing legibility for a certain number of words on certain sizes of sign. And the emphasis was on what works at night, with lights shining on the words, which are reflective, with cars speeding toward the signs. And they were comparing existing fonts to specifically proposed new ones. From what I read, their results seem pretty solid for their limited brief.
Generalizing beyond this to what is readable in text on paper or on screen is problematic, but I don't think the researchers attempted any such generalization or made any claims about it.
There are a lot of problems with research in this area, but you can be too cynical too. </div>

<div class=commentbody>"From what I read, their results seem pretty solid for their limited brief."
You are joking right? "cars speeding toward the signs" where? The tests I read only included truckers and trucks.:)
"comparing existing fonts to specifically proposed new ones" where? the test I read only included old sign vs. new sign. :)
"Have you looked at the MUTCD?" did you James, study this document thoroughly before making the CV fonts?
"...my partner in the Clearview project has developed a proportional grid design system he is currently trying to get the Feds to adopt."
This was done first in the Highway Gothic development, as a thinking typeman would expect. ;)
"...the system is very modular and basically sends a good portion of the MUTCD to the waste bin."
lol, What I think James is trying to say, is that the MUTCD included important guides for the modular use of Highway Gothic. Lacking such a document, Clearview can hardly live up to its name. The next interesting question, is "will having such a document beg changes to the fonts"...:)
Cheers!

<div class=commentbody>David, you have a good point that they were testing specific signs, and if the spacing is messed up enough on others, it might affect the results.
What I found convincing is their conclusion that Clearview, with its medium weight and larger, more open counters is more legible under night conditions--with halation--than the heavier weight and more closed counters of the original highway gothic series E modified that they were comparing it to. </div>

<div class=commentbody>"...their conclusion that Clearview, with its [agate proportions] is more legible under night conditions..."
Yes, I see that. Once you (they) have led this Push-Me-Pull-You 100 yards down the road, has it really traveled 100 yards? ;)
Cheers!

<div class=commentbody>"I’m looking for articles other than the articles about Clearview, and for writing that is specific to type, as opposed to articles about psychology/cognition that can be interpreted for type."
Hi James, what is the difference between studies about type and studies about psychology? The authors of the Clearview research were psychologists.

<div class=commentbody><cite>Hi James, what is the difference between studies about type and studies about psychology?</cite>
Writings that aren’t specific to type but can apply to type would end up requiring too much explanation within the context of my work. I am working on an undergraduate thesis with a very limited written component, so I need to keep things unambiguous, short, direct and not open myself up to arguments along the lines of “…you’re a design student, what the hell do you know about applying cognitive psychology research to letters?”</div>

You take 10 people (10), put their chins in a cup, slam them into a 147 dpi screen and ask them to identify typefaces that have not been evened out to present the same size l.c. ...I think you get sqaut. Can Commerce be an answer?

<div class=commentbody>The signage on the moterway etc are in a certain font. In the UK, they are in (is it Helvetica or Gillsans?) They are in that certain typeface for a reason. Clarity and no fuss. So when you are speeding past,t he information is taken in our brains at such a speed, we are able to decode it and read it. We would not be able to if it was in a script font. Alot of angry drivers on the roads i would assume. Also look at connotations and colour connotations. Red means love, passion but also blood, agression and many other things. So colour psychology is required too to decode a message i.e. a symbol or sign.</div>

<div class=commentbody>I'm mainly looking at motorway signage. Transport or Transport Heavy is used in the UK, is it not? According to the article by Phil Baines in Eye that James pointed out to me, the choice of colour for the motorway signage was 'In part an aesthetic choice, in part it was suggested by the use of reflective materials and their costs...The blue chosen was the American Standard Interstate Blue Colour, which stood out from the countryside as well as giving good contrast to the whiter type.'</div>

<div class=commentbody>Would I be correct in saying that the following are used in each country;
Germany DIN 1451
Switzerland Frutiger
United Kingdoom Transport
Ireland Transport

Anyone have info on other countries? Is Transport used in Australia, New Zealand and other places?
