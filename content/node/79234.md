  body: Preservation Hall is some kind of Western or Tuscan wood type. Jazz Band is
    a traditional thick-thin-sans. I can't think of any fonts that have such a hand-lettered
    look, but as a starting point for Jazz Band try [[http://new.myfonts.com/search/magnesium+mvb/fonts/|Magnesium]]
    or Letterhead Fonts [[http://www.letterheadfonts.com/fonts/thickandthin.php|Thick
    and Thin Sans]].
