  except I want to write \"2008\" on the lawn.\r\n\r\nDoes anyone have any recommendations
  of what font to use?  It should be be a font that is still very readable even if
  the lines get sloppy in case the grass grows unevenly or the fertilizer isn't applied
  perfectly.  Also, I imagine that it'll be easier to make straight lines than curves."

  body: Agency seems a lot easier than machine.  I still need to learn a lot about
    applying fertilizer before I can make a final decision.

  body: I've been working on a book cover using a felt sheet and needle-felting bits
    of wool to it for the title (um, you probably have to see it to understand!).  Was
    very grateful that none of the letters had any curves on them, and ended up using
    Helvetica Bold, although I would defy anyone to identify the face from photographs.  ;-)

  body: "The dimensions of the lawn are about 160' by 360', and I really like Agency
    because it looks much easier to write than Machine.  Does anyone have any suggestions
    about which weight to use?\r\n\r\nDepending on the weight, the font size should
    be around 43200pt to 56766pt, assuming I only use half the school.  Should I change
    any of the proportions or spacings when I enlarge it?\r\n\r\nI have someone determining
    what type of fertilizer we should use, and I'll give him that suggestion about
    time-released fertilizer."
