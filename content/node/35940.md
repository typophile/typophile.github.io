  body: "It's a slab serif like <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/urw/stymie/\">Stymie</a>,
    maybe with some squooshing. Stymie has the same A, E, R and an M whose crotch
    doesn't quite reach the baseline, like your samples. I think the outlining has
    eaten up all the inside letter space, but I think Stymie would be quite close,
    especially the URW DC Medium version on the page I linked (and attached). The
    Condensed versions don't have the middle E serif. You would just have to graphically
    narrow this.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega[img:sites/default/files/old-images/StymieDCRegVietnam_4247.gif]"
