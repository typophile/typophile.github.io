  commonly used in the mid 80''s. This does not seems like the easiest thing to find
  out, though, and I was wondering if anyone might have some information on the subject? '

    move on to books about advertising in the 80s, and from there to microfilm catalogs
    of 80s magazines and newspapers.

    Check out old issues of <em>U&lc</em>.\r\n\r\n"

    seem to be solid choices.

  body: "ITC Garamond and ITC Berkeley especially have the fine details for display.\r\nMake
    sure to set them reeeeeeeal tight.\r\nIn fact, that style of setting is more significant
    as a marker of the era than the choice of typeface.\r\nThis from Typsettra:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/BarB2_4527_5030.jpg]\r\n\r\nBut
    that tight look for headlines, which began in the 1960s, was pass\xE9 by mid decade,
    replaced by heads that were tracked out.\r\n\r\nThat was for mainstream.\r\nAlternatively,
    Punk was the look 1977-1984, with collaged heads where many fonts were mashed
    up in the same sentence.\r\nAgain, mid-decade, that changed. Neville Brody introduced
    Industria in the London scene magazine <em>The Face</em> in 1984, heralding a
    structured look.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/the-face-nov-1984_4420.jpg]\r\n\r\nSo
    there you have it, four \"eighties\" type looks, depending whether you go straight
    or alternative, early decade or late."

  body: '"Caslon Graphique" also seems to be a popular headline font of that period.
    Not sure why I didn''t mention it the first time, it''s actually one of my favorite
    display typefaces.'

    and Light a popular seller. Faces like Blippo Bold, Yagi Double (CNN logo) were
    also popular. Some of the basic display fonts had added swash characters. Alphabet
    Innovations had some very popular franchised fonts. '
