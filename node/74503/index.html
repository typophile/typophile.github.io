  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>First off hello to everybody.</p>
<p>I want to write my bachelor paper (graphic design) on 3D Typography. Recently I have been searching for books, where I could get more information about the history of dimensional typography, and there is very little I can find. I am able to find many examples, many pictures and projects, and they are all very inspiring, but i need TEXT so that i can write a paper and back up my observations on a few specific projects that I will choose to analyze.</p>
<p>I am looking for interviews, articles, books that will answer questions like:</p>
<p>//what is the effect of type when it is actually 3d or when it appears 3d (like for logos, posters and such)
//why do people design 3d type?
//when did 3d type first appear?
(on this, i have seen wonderful example of lettering and illumination, which are stunning 2d illustrations of type that looks 3d, of course there are many engravings and such dating from very early times)
//is there one influential artist or a group that first introduced 3d letters?</p>
<p>I am trying to stay away form the topic of architecture, since this would complicate things for me.</p>
<p>I hope you guys can help a little with suggestions. Anything goes for now, since I am still in the brainstorming phase. 
Thank you!!
Diana</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Contact sign painter/type designer John Downer. He has put together a good presentation about these techniques in painted signage; the Type Director’s Club might have a video of him giving the presentation earlier this year. He has also studied sign painting techniques in great detail and should be able to suggest some manuals that you might be able to find in libraries. It would be worth your while to do some research into his work and interview him about it.</p>
<p>Abbott Miller did some experimentation with 3D fonts. And nobody does 3D type like Hollywood; there’s got to be a wealth of juicy stuff in the minds of the people doing high-end movie branding and film titles like 2009’s <em>Sherlock Holmes</em>. Back issues of <em>Cinefex</em> might cover some of that.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p><em>/why do people design 3d type?</em></p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve designed one 3D font, as part of the Bodoni Egyptian family, in 1999.
I did it because I was interested in the tools that Fontographer provided to create that sort of effect, also because I thought it would be appropriate for a design based on a type from an era, c.1800, where the genre first appeared, and because I was interested in the effect of &ldquo;outline and fill&rdquo; that could be achieved in Quark XPress by layering.</p>
<p>I was particularly interested in the way that a proper 3D typeface is not a mere mechanical offset, but has adjustments to make the dropshadow appear more uniform in thickness.</p>
<p>Actually, I had earlier (1980) created a 3D version of a Headliners face (Gryphon) &ndash; again because I was interested in the way that technique (at that time, photo-modification) could be used to create such effects.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>hey.
thanks you all for the tips.</p>
<p>upon talking to my teacher, i have decided to go with 2d type that has a 3d feel.
like posters where typography is used to create the illusion of space, either because they are block letters, due to perspective, or other renderings that make it look 3d.</p>
<p>one example is the benhur poster, which i will be analyzing.</p>
<p>i think i have found some literature to help me. luckily there is a little more in this direction. my initial plan was to look at actual 3d letters, but there is too little to write a thesis on that, unfortunately.</p>
