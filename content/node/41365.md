  body: "Is there something about the instructions that requires speed reading? Conventional
    typefaces like Times, Minion, Garamond, Charter, Georgia, Dante, Clifford, Hoefler
    Text, Constantia, Galliard, Electra, Goudy Oldstyle, etc. are all adequate for
    instructions, tests, forms,  etc. as long as they aren't mangled (negative tracking,
    inadequate linespacing, light inking, artificially condensed). There are better
    ones and of course much worse ones (Helvetica, Bodoni, display typefaces), but
    is there some critical reason the typefaces have to have some legibility rating?
    What kind of texts are you preparing? \r\n\r\nI ask because there is no such standard
    test; it's a huge bugaboo in the type and typography world, and unfortunately
    it's all decided ad hoc. your best bet right now is actually to make a \"safe\"
    or conventional choice and not mess with the type too much; set it well. If you
    want assistance in choosing highly legible typefaces, be prepared either for a
    cacophonous disagreement, or else very subjective choices from whoever you ask.
    \r\n\r\nYou may have to design the test yourself, if this information is required.

    of typefaces or page layouts, doesn't work like that. Typography is design. Glyphs
    are drawn by hand.\r\n\r\nLinotype was the Borg of the newspaper industry in the

    role in making newspaper typography the stagnant backwater of the graphic design
    world, until the advent of DTP.\r\n\r\n**\r\n\r\nThere's scientific research,
    which should test how people read. And there's product development, which tests
    how products perform. The efficacy of a design cannot be determined before it
    is marketed, and in many cases it creates its own demand (hence innovation and
    progress).\r\n\r\nAbout a century ago, some clever people began applying scientific
    principles to advertising (Daniel Starch, for instance, and Claude Hopkins). But
    the furthest they have ever gotten down that road (apart from the subliminal detour)

  body: "Nick I think you make some great points about the culture of type and business.\r\n\r\nDespite
    that I think it would be great if really useful thorough research was done. It
    could be useful for Scientists, useful for Users, and useful for font makers.
    I think all of that & more could definitely be done if there was funds and a will.
    But I am not holding my breath! I am happy and in a way grateful that there is
    position at MS for Kevin! Were that there were more!\r\n\r\nBut the reality is
    that doing this research isn't a big priority in our Civ. We are very rich civilization
    and we could be doing much much much more. But we don't. This is party because
    we already seem to have an embarrassment of riches when it comes to fonts - and
    it's snowballing! And partly because the purpose of one font vs. the other is,
    so much of the time that of sensibility & tone served with the usual portion of
    utility; rather than sheer utility or with utility coming as a first or dominant
    priority. And because of that I think that the Nick Shinns of the world need not
    fear too much. Maybe this is a mistaken impression. Maybe there is more pressure
    as regards utility than I know. Feel free to correct me. \r\n\r\n<cite> The efficacy
    of a design cannot be determined before it is marketed </cite>\r\n\r\nThis seems
    mistaken to me. You can learn things ahead of release of a font about it's utility.
    What you can't know is how well a face is going to sell. Which thing are you getting
    at here?\r\n\r\n<cite> Some however may resist such platitudes, etc...</cite>\r\n\r\nI
    agree that being assimilated into \"group thought\" would be a bad plan. But that
    isn't science. The conflation of Marketing & Science isn't helpful, even if one
    thing may trail on shortly after the other. Once Kevin's work published is in
    a peer reviewed scientific journal it is cooperative. And when MS decides that
    Kevin is allowed publish MS funded research then; to that extent, they are genuinely
    cooperating and contributing to the common good. The key word being extent.\r\n\r\nAlso
    in fairness to Kevin you can't expect his boss' priorities to be the general welfare
    of western civ or civ in general much as they might like to spin it that way \u2013
    and have. If it can't be used for competitive advantage then it might not be worth
    it for them. They need to justify what they do in service to MS. Maybe there can
    be a bit of overlap as regards the world but that has to be secondary. By the
    same token you can't expect Nick to point to a competitor's typeface on Typophile.
    Obviously sheer scale means that it isn't the same. But I think it's the same
    kind of thing.\r\n\r\nI also think there is also always going to be a cultural/experiential
    overlay to the results despite even an ideal testing process*. Data collected
    in OH might be different from NYC might be different from Germany & so on. So
    it may (or may not be) that you can get solid usable results but the practical
    application is questionable. \r\n\r\nI feel am not contradicting myself here.
    Or shading things grey. I am just attempting to parcel things out.\r\n\r\n<cite>
    For actually coming up with creative... </cite>\r\n\r\nI think \"Creative\" isn't
    for the purposes of this discussion one thing. It is at least two. It is sensibility
    & tone rather and utility.** Obviously you are right when it comes to selecting
    for sensibility & tone. But utility is a different animal. It is true that if
    you can know the purpose a font will be put to, LCD screens or Newsprint or whatever
    you can use your eyes and go with your educated impression. And that works very
    well. If it didn't we wouldn't see the advances we have. What I reject in the
    abstract is the idea that Science can't be effectively added to the team as it
    were. The \"unfair\" advantage is simply that MS can afford the services of a
    scientist. But compared to dropping fonts into the market for free I suspect this
    is a minor advantage.\r\n\r\n<cite> hyping of such type products with scientific
    or statistical terminology </cite>\r\n\r\nHere I agree. Anybody can come up with
    a list of the most readable fonts ( or a best font) & then drop a white paper
    that is supposed to prove it. Okay not anybody. But is done in many industries
    and constantly. You have to be skeptical. And people are, more & more. But being
    critical <strong>is</strong> science. What sucks is when they decide that it's
    a good plan to pitch science along with it's superficial trappings. Don't conflate
    scientific process & hype. Hype doesn't have to attend Science. And when it does
    they can be separated. It isn't fun, but it can be done.\r\n\r\nAlso from what
    I can tell people have been less & less inclined to accept hype with re: to fonts.
    I don't think that the reception given to ClearType has been rapturous. It wasn't
    as bad as the din about Vista but still... \r\n\r\n<cite> I agree that it reduces
    too much, too simplistically, but it would sometimes be handy to be able to point
    to something easy for non-specialists to understand. </cite>\r\n\r\nScience is
    complicated and grey much of the time. It is really really rare and wonderful
    when real science can be presented as something easy to understand. Like \"you
    need enough vitamin C to avoid Scurvey so get this citrus in your diet\". I don't
    have much hope that this \"something\" will be produced for use with clients.
    And I am even less ceratin that they would make good use of it. I am much more
    hopeful that many small somethings might be available to type designers*** to
    make use of. And that we could be more effective at marketing.\r\n\r\n<cite>And
    yet this happens anyway</cite>\r\n\r\n\"There is one born every Minute\" comes
    to mind. This is why Marketing exists. I agree with Carl. I think you have to
    shrug it off basically. His \"what to do\" is certainly more pithy!\r\n \r\n*
    Assuming such a thing could exist which it cannot.\r\n** Maybe you don't mean
    to include utility but given the context of your use of it it seemed like you
    did.\r\n*** Or type making companies\r\n\r\nFor those of you that made it this
    far - sorry about this overly long post."

    with testing typefaces in use: reading speed, comprehension, comfort over long
    reading times, eye fatigue. It doesn't presuppose dissecting or destroying anything,
    and it isn't necessarily divorced from what typographers \"know\" about type.
    The trick is to get typographers involved in designing tests. That's what Kevin
    is on to. One of the most frustrating flaws in research to date is wretchedly
    bad typeface selection. Courier, Curlz, Arial Condensed, Helveeta, etc. are not

    science has anything to offer just because I don't stand to benefit from the admission.
    Or maybe I will... depending on what researchers and their employers ( or universities)
    decide to do.\r\n\r\nI have faith that the best ideas for improving type will
    come from type makers be they indie or otherwise, and with or without research
    to inspire or gird their results. Maybe in that sense I agree with you. And maybe
    if people (type makers and scientists alike) notice useful stuff they will share
    that useful stuff. I plan to. You have. ( Thanks BTW! ) I think it's very promising.\r\n\r\nAnd

    it is possible to study what happens when people are in love and compare heart
    rates and variety of other data. It is also possible to see what reactions lead
    to the perception of \"sweet\". If you look at the studies and see how the scientists
    couch their work I doubt that the scientists were claiming to be able to in any
    way encompass love or to be equivalent to experiencing \"sweet\" for yourself.
    So the two are not synonymous exactly. What the scientist would say is that they
    are making falling in love the subject of their study - as a expedient way of
    putting it. Or making a study of how we perceive the taste \"sweet\". And doing
    so in a specific a specific, probably narrow, and hopefully repeatable way. \r\n\r\nI
    suggest that we could learn things; maybe interesting or important things; or
    even just useful things, from studies of readability. And I think I can say this

    come to think of affordance as a curve with an initial steep climb, than a wide
    plateau and eventually a gradual decline. Proposing that affordance is a curve
    with a distinct shape is more useful than thinking of readability as a simple
    equation of more versus less. And it is a perspective that has it's source in
    science.\r\n\r\nWhere, in terms of type-size the climb begins or the plateau sits;
    how wide the plateau is are issues involving thresholds and ranges and vary from
    type to type. I suspect an analysis of variance will show that, for most standard
    text fonts the thresholds and ranges don't vary dramatically under normal conditions
    of use or covary linearly. In other words, a change that affects a threshold positively
    might have a negative effect on where the plateau sits. Perhaps the styles of
    termination, or types of contrast can be an example. But thresholds and ranges
    do nevertheless, I think we'll find, interact with the traditional typographical
    parameters. And I suspect they do so in demonstrably more complicated ways than
    we have seen codified so far.\r\n\r\nSimple affordance has to be balanced with
    issues of comfort in large texts, with concerns about heirarchical transparency,
    surveyability and navigability in instructional manuals, and with the cultural-historical
    positioning or affiliation statements a document has to make. Comfort in large
    texts, positioning, and the demands for heirarchical transparency, surveyability
    and navigability can exert countervailing pressures on the choice of type. This
    makes a decontextualized descision based soley on simple or generic affordance
    micro-advantages short-sighted. \r\n\r\nMany clients groups are aware of these

    it all can get to be a bit like those blind sages trying to describe an elephant
    (It's like a tree. No, it's like a snake...) (Why didn't they just ask the mahout?)\r\n\r\nIt
    might be difficult to design a font that is completely illegible and still include
    identifiable letters, and it's true, the most legible font in the world can be
    mangled by bad typography. The fact there is bad typography though, suggests that
    starting with a highly legible typeface should mitigate the awfulness somewhat.
    But, what's a legible typeface 'sposed to look like? \r\n\r\nThe rules of what
    make a legible typeface are in my opinion are quite simple and straightforward
    and allow for a great deal of flexibility. I don't think is is even possible to
    design a definitively \"most legible\" typeface. I think in any fare test of comparable
    fonts, you'll find that differences in performance can be so slight as not to
    matter.  \r\n\r\nI really don't think legibility standards need to be anything
    to get knickers in a twist about. It's mostly common sense to anyone with some
    expertise in typography. I think where that kind of standardization would apply
    would be on wayfinding signage, medicine bottles, captioning on TV, operating
    instructions that come with power tools and the TV guide in the newspaper. (OK
    that last one is personal, but Really! Would it be possible to make it worse?)
    and things like government and public transit websites and other printed materials,
    where accessibility is a right that these organization should make honest efforts
    to honour. \r\n\r\nThis sort of graphic work seldom actually gets designed in
    any real way. The objective in producing a set of instructions may turn out to
    be \"How many tiny black words can I fit onto this tiny piece of paper that will
    be packaged with these potentially deadly drugs\" instead of what percentage of
    people who should read these instructions will not be able to?\". Even if the
    designer conscientiously designed this sheet to be as readable as possible, he
    or she would have no way of telling you what percent of people could read it.
    That should be something that could be determined. At the very least, there should
    be some set of guidelines that can be referred to, that are a bit more sophisticated
    than, \"use Arial and make it big\" (the real purpose of such a spec is to keep
    people who know less than the spec writer from using some crazy Spenserian script,
    and Arial is a font they can name.)\r\n\r\nTaking the example of Erik Spiekermann's
    work for the Financial times, where he improved the legibility of their typeface
    by cleaning up the shapes somewhat, increasing tracking and leading and (counter
    intuitively to most) slightly decreasing the font size. \r\n\r\nI think that the
    form such \"standards\" might take need not be unreasonably restricting at all
    and would have no impact on what the vast majority of designers do. \r\n\r\nHellbox,
    email me (russ.mcg at gmail.com), and I'll tell some of what I've done to test
    legibility. It was for signage, but some of it might apply to what you are doing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n-=\xAE=-"

    the foundry.\r\nDon't you recall the thread here last year on the definition of
    the em square?!\r\n\r\nA typeface does not have size.\r\nA scientific parallel
    would be fractals, as in \"how long is the perimeter of the Jenson \"a\"?\r\nIt
    would depend on which particular \"a\" one chose to measure, the resolution of
    the medium in which it's set, and the resolution of the measuring device.\r\n\r\nOf
    course, it's possible to take a particular setting of a particular typeface, vary
    its size, and see how the variations perform with different age groups.\r\n\r\nWhatever
    knowledge this reveals, as Peter says, \"a decontextualized descision based soley
    on simple or generic affordance micro-advantages [is] short-sighted.\"\r\n\r\nConsider
    these specimens from <em>The Designer's Guide to Text Type</em> (King and Esposito,
    Van Nostrand Rheinhold).\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Janson_4018.jpg]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Kennerley_4280.jpg]\r\nI
    put it to you that the readability of Janson and Kennerley will vary against one
    another according to leading, amongst other factors.\r\nAlso consider paper stock
    and, of course, tracking (this book was published in 1980, and man, is that 8
    pt. type tight!) \r\nThen there is line length and paragraph length. And might
    not one type perform better for rag right setting, the other for justified? And
    how would they fare when one varies the Flesch index? Would Janson's readability
    index be better for longer words?\r\n\r\nAll in all, for an index of typeface
    readability to be meaningful and useful, a standards manual would have to be published
    in the form of a type specimen, showing the exact setting which had been tested.
    For online use, the monitor and operating system would have to be specified, as
    well as pixel-height and application or file format (hinting varies).\r\n\r\nHowever,
    AFAIK, reading tests in laboratories are not conducted using \"real\" text. For
    instance, the Moving Window technique restricts the amount of text that is visible
    to a certain number of letter around a fixation point, and replaces all of the
    other letters on the page with the letter x. \r\n\r\nI don't believe there would
    be anything particularly scientific about indexing the readability of typefaces.
    It would be a simple form of market research. Investigating how reading works
    is one thing, and of course I support it, but applying readability standards to

    irrelevant and detached scientific processes in the discussion, which was originally
    about assessing the legibility of a typeface or some typefaces, and not, as you
    say above, about applying readability standards to typefaces, or measuring random
    micro features of letters, or isolating single words in artificial reading scenarios,
    or giving all typefaces ratings or rankings of some kind. Seeing all that as inevitable,
    as you seem to, is what I'm calling paranoid. You seem to be saying that the testing
    done to date proves that there is nothing useful to be learned by additional testing,
    because it also seems that you're saying that there is no possibility that there
    will ever be tests that account for the variables that we've all identified......
    Even though we're here virtually designing just such tests."

    you can measure something or you can't, so 'describing something imperfectly'
    isn't really science, although it may be anecdotally useful (and the plural of
    anecdote is data). I think legibility is probably an inherent quality of a typeface,
    determined by the legibility of individual glyphs, as individual forms and as
    distinct from each other. But readability is a measure of a document: we read
    typesetting, not typefaces. Choice of typeface is one variable in the readability
    of a document. If one were able to isolate and make equivalent all the other variables,
    then perhaps one could measure the degree to which the typeface contributes to
    the overall readability of the document. But this would still be something other
    than a readability index for the typeface, because I'm pretty sure that if the
    other variables were different, even though equal for the purposes of comparison,
    the contribution of the typeface to readability would also vary. For example,
    typeface X might be determined to be more readable than typeface Y in a document
    set in 12pt, but typeface Y might be determined to be more readable than typeface
    X in a document set at 8pt. Isolating the other variables in a single document
    only indicates which typeface is more readable in the context of those variables,
    not which typeface is inherently more readable."

    Absolutely. But, what if you do a wide range of tests? You could see trends. Or

    it would be the shape of those trends across a wide enough range of variables

    you doubt that data you would get back could be meaningfully interpreted. Is that

    I don't think I every said that. What I'm saying is that this gradually built,
    imperfect, incomplete picture, insofar as it is useful in making decisions about
    type design, has to be made up of a lot more than what specifically scientific
    methodologies provide. This is what I mean when I say that <em>at the point of
    usefulness</em> scientific data and other kinds of information are basically at
    par, i.e. I think it would be a mistake to privilege new scientific data in the
    context of a humanistic craft with a developed wisdom of several hundred years.
    Instead, one would need to interpret that data within a hermeneutic of continuity
    with that wisdom, which means putting the scientific data and anecdotal data and
    experience and inspiration -- and everything else that makes up typographic wisdom
    -- into the same bucket and giving it a good stir to see what floats to the top.\r\n\r\n<em>We

    are? I'm not big on speculation, so I'd rather look at where we are now and consider
    what might be likely, not what might be only possible. Of course, I'm always ready
    to revise my analysis....\r\n\r\nThe way I see it now: reading science is providing
    some good insight into how we read, but I'm looking for a lot more, especially
    with regard to readerability, i.e. insight into why we're so darned good at reading
    such a diversity of systems, styles, etc. and what the tolerances or limits are.
    I don't yet see a complete description of how we read, and that makes me very
    wary about trying to draw practical conclusions in terms of 'doing things differently'
    in type design, which is what we're all concerned about isn't it? If the science
    ends up confirming everything that we're already doing, that's interesting and
    reassuring, but it doesn't have a positive impact on the development of new type
    design. The tantalising notion is that the science might one day give us a clue
    how to make type better, and that's what makes it sexy or scary depending on one's
    proclivities. At the moment, I don't see anything in the science that is being
    done that suggests I should be doing anything different. Put another way, if you
    put today's science into the bucket with accumulated typographic wisdom it just
    gets absorbed: it isn't significant enough to contribute to the mix.\r\n\r\nThere
    are narrowly defined areas in which scientific study is presently useful, e.g.
    reading at low resolution, but the same limitations that make scientific study
    useful make type design correspondingly less significant. The science is more
    useful for rendering engine developers, screen manufacturers and document creators
    than for type designers."

    In my reading I encounter terms like \u201Csalience,\u201D \u201Cresponse bias,\u201D
    and \u201Ccue value,\u201D and because I am unhappy with the cognitive processing
    connotations of the term \u201Cword recognition\u201D I propose \u201Cvisual wordform
    resolution\u201D to describe the perceptual processing component in reading.\r\n\r\nMy
    aim in doing this is to give type designers new and useful ways of seeing what
    they are doing when they manipulate proportions, contrast, weight and construction.
    That is, I want to expand the repertoire of constructs by which we channel our
    actions, or according to which we make our assessments. What I think we are doing
    (when we say we are improving legibility or enhancing readability) is manipulating
    cue-values, strengthening response bias, managing salience, improving perceptual
    discrimination affordances in such a way that the ease and automaticity of visual
    wordform resolution is enhanced. I want to expand \u2014 or diversify beyond the
    conventional, rather contentious ones we use \u2014 the repertoire of personal
    constructs we use to channel are actions or make our assessments. Metanoia\r\n\r\n(I
    am also interest in \u201Ccrowding\u201D and \u201Cinterfacilitation\u201D because
    they seem to hold a key, but that\u2019s anther story.)\r\n\r\nI think of type
    design as both a fine art and an exact science. It is an exact science because,
    beyond the simple requirement of making a recognizable letter \u201Dm,\u201D manipulating
    salience and cue values is a game of tiny incremental adjustments in conformity
    with the laws of gestalt vision. The fine art is in knowing where to make the
    adjustments."

    Yes, one can write unreadable prose, but we are talking about the contribution
    of type. Good experimentation separates the influence of different variables.
    The idea you seem to be assuming--that in principle the influence of different
    variables can't be separated--is just wrong. It isn't easy, but it it is done
    all the time in science. If you couldn't separate the influence of different variables
    there would be no successful scientific research, which is clearly not the case.
    \r\n\r\n>while comprehension and retention of anything other than simple grammar
    and facts is the preserve of the humanities, is it not?\r\n\r\nNo, it's not, in
    so far as typography is also an influence. You can have a text book on a difficult
    subject, and a good typeface and good typography can help make it more readable.
    Of course, how well the writer writes is critical. \r\n\r\nEben's analogy to the
    influence of science on cooking is superb: science helps the cook, but isn't going
    to make a mediocre home cook a great chef. It can help both, though. For example,
    Julia Child turned to food scientist [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shirley_Corriher|Shirley
    Corriher]]. And I  cook a little better because of her science-based advice also.

    you to make the distinction between studying reading, and studying readability.\r\nCertainly,
    the variables can be limited in tests that are designed to address particular
    aspects of the reading process.\r\nHowever, the putative study of typeface readability
    is impossible, because there are too many extraneous factors which skew the results.
    \r\n\r\nOK, here comes an analogy: manners.\r\nScience can study manners--anthropology
    or sociology --but it's not its job to offer etiquette tips.\r\nReadability is
    like manners, typographers use certain types and \"style sheets\" for different
    kinds of publication.\r\nIf the wrong typespec is used, readability will tank.\r\nHow
    can science assign a particular typeface a readability quotient when it is good
    manners to use it in one kind of periodical, but a faux pas in another? Sure,
    you isolate the variable and say, THIS quotient IF these circumstances. And so
    on, as you take account of all the variables--the reader's education and eyesight,
    where they're reading, what the writing is, and so on, not to mention the typographic
    variables of size, leading, line length, and paper stock. Do you really believe

    For example, the book [[http://www.amazon.com/Questions-Politeness-Strtgs-Cambridge-Anthropology/dp/0521292506/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1202150325&sr=8-1|Questions
    and Politeness]] points out that there is a conflict between being clear, as is
    a priority in debate for the growth of knowledge, and politeness. The goal in
    politeness is avoid embarrassment to anybody in the conversation. For that reason
    vague, open-ended questions, such as 'How do you do', are standard polite questions.
    Pointed, personal, close-ended questions, like \"How much money did you make last
    month?\" and \"When did you have last have sex with your wife?\" are rude. \r\n\r\nI
    think the lessons for etiquette tips are pretty obvious. As is the challenge of
    trying to have a debate for the sake of better understanding--such as this one--while
    maintaining politeness.\r\n\r\nAs Kant said \"There is nothing so practical as
    a good theory.\" A good theory is true, and therefore has practical applications.
    I have no doubt the same would be true for advances in the scientific study of

    the danger, in the case of readability, of turning a value into a number, and
    in the case of legibility, af creating a reliance on threshold statistics (in
    the domain of perceptual discrimination affordance) for relevant information about
    functionality at a plateau (in the domain of visual wordform resolution). \r\n\r\nThat
    being said, I'm all for constructing legibility quotients and readability profiles.
    I'm just sensitive to how they are constructed and used. If concerns for readability
    and legibility are included in the brief, these shouldn't be a threat. And they
    shouldn't be all there is to consider."

    between test type and user: first the dreamer gave his ideas, then the scientist
    gave his scientifically studied presentation, then the type designer showed how
    simple it was going to be to make fonts, and then the typographer showed beautiful
    stuff a bit too far away to see. Kevin, before he was Kevlar, gave the scientific
    explaination for reading, which he still believes and which still inspires this
    CT effort, I think. It revolves around letters, not sylables, words, or lines
    \u2014 people read letters. I got close to him at Typecon, not just because I
    like him, but also to make sure he would say it three times while I was right
    there. \"Chinese?\" \"No,\" \"the word 'a'?\", \"NO,\" \"youth vs expertise?\"
    \"Noooooo, people read letters one saccade at a time!\r\n\r\nSo, unless 'Ready
    Rendering Skills' lead science to bad reading science, and influenced type design
    decisions, an unthinkable thing, then Science did it. ;)  By, ready rendering
    skills, in this case I mean the ability, for better or for worse, to cleave the
    resolution into components, not triple the resolution, as is so often claimed.
    Read the MS 'white paper' on anti-aliasing type, which 'scientifically' led this
    off. It measures, prods and pokes around the solution without ever mentioning
    type, or typography. This last study, if Sheedy only lets MS change the filter,
    (and not the oil or driver;), it is not going to change the fundamentally saccade-hiccupic
    nature in low resolution text across the Windows universe. This is not my fault,

    non-sentient e-world objects. But, who, or what, are these scientific studies
    of CT done for, if not for the engineering staff(s) who render rendering engines?
    Kevlar just said, 5 filterings were tested in their scientific study, and 2 filterings
    were released to the developing public. Maybe he knows then? Is what the rendering

    would be scientific progress in understanding readability. \r\n\r\nYour options
    are so primitive that you must think scientists are required to be stupid, which

    lenses because there are so many different ways we can see badly, and so many
    causes of bad vision. But they do measure these many variables, and prescribe
    successfully.  \r\n\r\nAs any one who studies typography at all knows, the different
    factors of type face, leading, spacing etc. interact to produce a product which
    is more or less readable. \r\n\r\nScientists can test for a combinations of these
    variables, or for other variables which they might be able to isolate. \r\n\r\nFor
    example Bill Hill of Microsoft mentioned at TypeCon that the reason for the 65
    character line width of a single book column being ideal, and more than 75 a problem
    is that at normal reading distances we have to turn our heads, and not just our
    eyes for longer measures. I believe the argument was that we are less efficient
    at moving along the line or to the next line, This is a kind of thing you can
    actually check by seeing how the readers' eyes move, and their change in reading
    speed. \r\n\r\nI don't know whether this has been tested, but according to you

    is a human activity carried out every day by millions of people who speak and
    think in many hundreds of languages and who read and write in dozens of different
    writing systems. This suggests to me that any understanding of the mechanics of

    is not really an understanding of reading per se, it is only an understanding
    of reading a particular script (and most likely a particular language written
    in that script, given the limitations of most studies). So what I would like to
    see is studies that are designed to produce comparable data for reading in multiple
    writing systems.\r\n\r\nI have an hypothesis, which is that word or phrase recognition
    is built up from recognition of the base distinct 'atoms' of any given writing
    system, with the latter recognition involving sub-atomic role architecture and/or
    molecular (multi-atom) compounds <em>as needed by the individual reader encountering
    a given text</em>.\r\n\r\nThe interesting aspects of this hypothesis, I think,
    is that for some writing systems I don't think we know yet what constitutes an
    atom. For the typical typographic Latin script I'm pretty sure the atom is the
    letter, and studies seem to confirm this. But what is the atom in Chinese? The
    ideograph or the radical? What is the atom in Hindi? The letter or the syllable?
    What is the atom in Arabic? The letter or the segment? And, for that matter, does
    the atom of the Latin script change depending on whether one is reading disconnected
    typographic letters or connected script?\r\n\r\nI have another, contradictory

    multiple factors are involved in readability, I would not expect a single index
    that applies to all situations. But I would expect an indication of what is more
    readable in specific conditions when other variables are controlled.\r\n\r\nFor
    example, I would not expect differences to show between headlines of a few words
    in serif vs sans serif, when there is similar x-height, stem weight, width and
    spacing. However, a common view is that sans work less well for extended reading
    at text sizes, and specifically they require more leading to work decently. So
    if you control for x height and weight, I expect that serif type will be more
    readable at normal text sizes with tight leading. When we have good measures of
    readability this kind of difference will be detectable. One simple test will be
    whether the eye loses the line more often with tight leading in a sans that is
    otherwise similar to a serif. Also I have already suggested that testing the decline
    of comprehension of extended text, with time, might be another way to get at it.
    Another is to test for people's ability to catch errors in proof reading. \r\n\r\nAlso
    legibility is one factor in readability. I think that the tests of Clearview did
    show that they were more legible and more readable at distances under night conditions,
    particularly for older drivers. It doesn't mean they will be more readable in
    extended text at small sizes. \r\n\r\n>What\u2019s your point, Bill? \r\nMy point
    is that scientists will control for some variables to test others. In your post,
    you seemed to overlook that this possibility, a standard thing to do in scientific
    testing. The ability to control for some and detect others requires creativity.
    You assume or assert that scientific method is helpless in such situations, and

    generalized and analogized, and stated that scientists would use creative test-building.
    That's wishful thinking.\r\n\r\nLet's return to Eben's example of making a study
    serif-oriented, and my rebutal. I do not consider it possible to isolate the variable
    of \"serifness\" from that of \"typeface\". \r\n\r\nIt would be possible to vary
    the serif of a typeface (Penumbra comes to mind) and test that, but testing, for
    instance, the \"readability\" of slab serifs versus bracketed serifs by testing
    Clarendon against Times makes no sense, as the test may be measuring the performance
    of angle of stress, or degree of stroke contrast, or something else, or combination
    thereof.\r\n\r\nI doubt that a definition of slab serif is even possible, as may
    be infered from looking at the FontBook.\r\n\r\nAnother variable that effects
    the quality of serifness is inking/gain/raster mode. So for instance, you decide
    to test serifness against ink gain, varying Didot serif thickness (or length?)
    at 9 pt, on a particular stock, printed on a particular press, varying gain. With
    a certain class of readers, and a certain kind of text content.  Let's assume
    you do this by modifying Bauer Bodoni. Well, I doubt the result would even hold
    for Berthold Bodoni. And what use would such information be to a designer, when
    all the variables of a particular job are different from those that weren't varied
    in the test scenario? Isn't there a scientific principle related to the \"isolatability\"
    of multi-variant phenomena? What do meteorological theorists call it? The science
    is getting soft, so rather than hard outcomes, probabilities.\r\n\r\nI suspect
    that if the massive task of testing all the variables of reading against one another,
    for individual typefaces, were done, the best that may be said would be that there
    is a 30% probability that ITC Garamond is more readable than Adobe Garamond. \r\n\r\n

    at, and also unsurprised by your ability to imagine testing scenarios - which
    is great. There is something to the idea that you could as both a scientist and
    a typographer talk about types in a soft way or perhaps in an informed manner
    ( informed differently ) rather than a stiff, absolute, list oriented manner.
    If the reality is complex this is the only accurate way to talk about them. This
    doesn't preclude having meaningful things to say. It's just that these things
    will be rich/complex. This, as opposed to, and in a sense as a substitute for
    what hellbox was originally after.\r\n\r\nIt may be that you have acquired a 3rd
    bugbear. If 2, why not 3? I am with you for all 3 as far as I can see. I just
    don't stamp my foot as hard, and in the case of the most recent one I have a substitute
    in mind. It is starting to look as if you might too.\r\n\r\nPeter, Thanks. I agree
    that \"a table of comparative measures can\u2019t be where we end up\" is right.
    For one thing that simply isn't how the science would be done. Each experiment
    will have multiple ways in which it is out of sync with others. But what you can
    say is that if a variety of scientists run a variety of tests geared to a given
    hypothesis what you would be looking for is for the series to begin to accumulate
    support for or begin to undermine that hypothesis. This is a simple scenario.
    More complicated ones exist! You would be hoping to be able to say this hypothesis
    seems to hold some water or it doesn't. Sometime the hypothesis itself or the
    methodology was ill conceived and you don't get to say either thing. And there
    is room to disagree about these things. So the reason you cannot have a list is
    that Science ( and most fields of inquiry)  is more complicated than a list or
    matrix can describe. Peter, Kevin, is this sort of fair so far?\r\n\r\nBut if
    you have successful experiments for a given question and you go on to do another
    series and another after a long building on those experiments that seem to actually
    show something useful you can begin to have a picture emerge of what seems to
    be going on. Do enough of this and a theory can start to look pretty solid. A
    theory like evolution for instance.\r\n\r\nIt will be a very very long time before
    all the variables of reading have hypothesis' and have been tested out meaningfully.
    And before you can attempt that you have to have a theory about what those might
    be etc. So at our current rate of burn the mere possibility of doing a meaningful
    ITC Garamond vs. Adobe Garamond \"readability\" test must be 1000s of years away.
    It's an awful lot of work for a pretty banal question. That's why I think that
    targeted testing of what seems like an interesting or useful variable that is
    hard to crack by other humanistic means has to be where it's at.\r\n\r\nThat is
    why I would agree that isolating the variable of \u201Cserifness\u201D is probably
    not that interesting or useful. On the other hand I do think it would be interesting
    to craft experiments towards a better understanding of what is going on with serifs
    and different serif designs and so on. There are many ways of looking at that.\r\n\r\nJohn,
    I think Robert is probably correct. "

    information about how sustainability of immersion with comprehension is modulated

    specific. What I think it tells me is that type-related parametric change has
    a \u201Cperceptual processing in reading\u201D effect.\r\n\r\nMy question than
    is: what, in perceptual processing terms, do serifs really do. Saying they make
    a thing more readable doesn\u2019t tell me about what I think I want to know.
    Do they increase the distinctive cue-value of the features they are part of? Do
    they make counters and the spaces between letters more tractible and riveting
    for the eye by encapsulating them more fully so that they acquire a cue value
    of their own? Do they blur the letter-assignments of individual letter parts so
    that the bouma-integrity of the word as a whole asserts itself more strongly than
    each letter by itself? Do they mask variations in interletter spacing so that
    these variations don't become disruptive to the kind of perceptual processing
    that needs to happen?\r\n\r\nI think this kind of progressive and highly instructive
    interrogation is pre-empted by moving quickly to the conclusion that one thing
    is more readable than the other, and that this can be known by applying your test,
    meanwhile leaving behind a more specific awareness of what we have come to know.

    to generalize this into a statement about the broad experintial reality we've

    the things I've found. All I'd really want to say is: serifs, depending on their
    prominence and extent can have a very beneficially value, and without them, the
    pressure on interline and interletter spacing for acheiving satisfactory perceptual
    processing results is greater.\r\n\r\nStated this way, does my resistance to the

    come across anything further about this. It certainly looks like an easy to read

    has Garamond; both were favorites of Theodore Giesel (Dr. Seuss).\r\n\r\nLintotype's
    \"Legibility\" news fonts of the 1920s and 30s were concerned with opening up
    the counters: certainly the results produced a cleaner image, and the mantra has
    since always been in favour of open counters--but there is no scientific evidence
    that this actually improves reading! As John has suggested, let's consider non-latin
    scripts, and in Chinese and Japanese there are closed counters galore. \r\n\r\nI
    think that closed counters may improve readability. For instance, consider the
    sequence \"i_n\", which may be confused with \"m\".\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/inmin_5726.jpg]\r\n\r\nSaccadic
    scanning has been common knowledge since the 1940s -- there were <em>Life</em>
    magazine articles with call-outs on a photograph, showing \"where men and women
    looked subconsciously\" -- all very Freudian. I'm not sure whether that knowledge
    has ever informed a typeface design.\r\n\r\nClaude Hopkins' work in the 1920s
    (he wrote <em>Scientific Advertising</em>, and developed split-run direct marketing
    as a means of testing the relative merit of different copy and layouts, measured
    in sales) was a great influence on David Ogilvy, who disseminated some of the
    successful readability principles in several of his How-To books. But not really
    much hardcore science there, more market research using statistical techniques.\r\n\r\nCyril
    Burt's <em> A Psychological Study of Typography</em> (with foreword by Stanley
    Morison) was noted in its time, but all Sir Cyril's oeuvre has been tarnished
    by his reputation for falsifying.\r\n\r\nIt's not as if scientific knowledge about
    how we read hasn't been available in the past. But has this been any use to the
    designers of the most-read faces, other than giving them a lever to create something

  body: "<cite> I guess I misunderstood you then. </cite> Maybe. Go back & look at
    what Peter wrote about Readability. I thought it was very helpful. \r\n\r\nAnd
    here is an analogy while I am at it. Peter, Kevin, feel free to ding this up if
    you like... \r\n\r\nSuppose you wanted to study Cuteness scientifically. You can't
    say scientifically what Cute is right off the bat so how do you study it? Are
    you blocked forever? No way! What can yo do? \r\n\r\nYou could create an objective
    set of criteria describing perhaps not even the thing that was meant to be cute
    or not cute but the reactions you thought were indicative of a person coming into
    contact with the \"Cute\". Get the right reactions ( whatever you have decided
    they are ) and you know what is cute. Bring subject & target together and report
    what you get. What is you are looking at? Reactions. \r\n\r\nOr you could expose
    people to stimuli designed by you and ask them to report what was cute and so
    test hypotheses about what is needed for say a human face, or dog, or cartoon
    to be cute. Now it's reported reactions.\r\n\r\nOr you could track eye movements.
    Whatever.\r\n\r\nNo matter how much you test you will not describe the whole phenomena!
    But you could start to figure out things about the impact of eye to mouth & eye
    to nose ratios ( or whatever objective phenomena you choose) on what people are
    willing or not willing to report as cute. Not too bad really.\r\n\r\nDoing this
    you yourself could report that in a rough and casual manner \"I am studying cute\".
    You wouldn't be lying exactly. On the other hand you wouldn't be completely accurate
    either. You would be fudging because on some deeper level it is the atomized stand-ins
    for cuteness, the objective* phenomena to gauge that are being studied.\r\n\r\nBut
    back to Readability. If comfort, speed and comprehension are your standards for
    \"Readability\" then you face some problems. You have to define comfort. You have
    to define how you calculate speed. You have to define how you gauge comprehension.
    This is atomizing**. It's not common sense. But then it isn't meant to be. It's
    meant to be a reproducible scientific test. \r\n\r\nThis is what I mean by indirect.
    This is what I man by \"contribute to\". It isn't that there cannot be a relationship.
    It's that it has to be a certain kind of relationship. Not a bad kind. Just a
    different kind. \r\n\r\nSo this not lying thing is tricky. Nick wants to spin
    things one way so he says simply \" You cannot study readability with Science\".
    It's sort of true. In a specific way. But he is leaving out some important stuff
    in a statement like that. You can say \"You can study readability with Science\"
    and you are doing the same thing. Leaving out something.\r\n\r\nObviously we can't
    get into infinite detail all day so we fudge like this about lots of stuff. And
    most of the time it's okay. But on a thread like this it makes for a very long
    thread and talk about hobby horses.\r\n\r\nSo it isn't so much that what you described
    before was unscientific perhaps; but that it was under-scientific. \r\n\r\nAlso,
    I & Nick ( I think...) are not saying these is no such thing as Readability. (Or
    if Nick is he may be the only one.) \r\n\r\nI hope this is helpful.\r\n\r\n* As
    objective as you can imperfectly make them. \r\n** Atomizing sounds a bit like
    all the life has gone out of it but I don't think thats accurate either."

  body: "Bill, here is my reaction to your talk of factors, and to your question about
    whether your proposal tests readibility:\r\n\r\nSuppose we agree readability simply
    means it can be read. That that which can be read, can be read with comfort, speed
    and understanding, indicates that comfort speed and understanding are affordance-related,
    but not affordance-constitutive. Specifically, your proposed test tests \"how
    the sustainability of immersion with comprehension is modulated (if at all) in
    tightly line-spaced settings by the presence or abscence of serifs of a certain
    dimension at the terminations of strokes.\u201D That, literally, is what it tests.
    The readability is assumed. It doesn't anymore require testing, but the experience
    of reading can be enhanced. In this sense there is more to readibility than just
    that it can be read. But let's be pointed and specific about what it tests\r\n\r\nThe
    results of your test will tell us about exactly the same thing: how the sustainability
    of immersion with comprehension is modulated (if at all) in tightly line-spaced
    settings by the presence or abscence of serifs of a certain dimension at the terminations
    of strokes. This tells us about how affordances can presumably be enhanced.\r\n\r\nIf
    we want to know why, we will have to entertain hypothesis about how perceptual
    processing in reading works, and part of the reason why, might very well be that
    there is more to perceptual processing in reading than simple recognition of individual
    letters.\r\n\r\nUnlike comfort, speed and understanding, criterial cue-values
    and proper salience of role architectural parts and their evoked forms <em>are</em>
    affordance-constitutive. Criterial cue-values and proper salience are the very
    things that make it possible to make out the identity of the letters. \r\n\r\nI
    guess we are all trying here to find a language that is comfortable for us all.
    I'm not sure though that we are advancing in leaps and bounds. A way of speaking
    about or in a certain domain is in part a social contract. Maybe I've ridden my
    own little pony long enough. "

    It\u2019s not common sense. But then it isn\u2019t meant to be. It\u2019s meant
    to be a reproducible scientific test.\r\n\r\nEben, I don't understand what is
    bothering you about 'atomizing'. When you have subcategories of a general category,
    the general category doesn't vanish. Because people can be 'atomized' into male
    and female do human beings become impossible to study scientifically? You can't
    study feet scientifically because there are male feet and female feet? No, you
    study both, the similarities and differences. But they're still feet, and you
    can study them with observation and experiment. \r\n\r\nSimilarly, because you
    can distinguish different aspects of readability, and characteristics of type
    that are more readable in different circumstances, it doesn't invalidate the concept
    of readability or make it only possible to study 'humanistically'. You just study
    the different aspects.  \r\n\r\nComfort, speed, and comprehension can and have
    been already be measured scientifically. \r\n\r\nI would get at \"comfort\" first
    of all by self-report. In Kevin's report at ATypi I believe he said Sheedy had
    a number of questions, such as complaints of eyes burning, blurring, etc. as discomfort.
    Then he has identifies physiological analogues he can measure that correlate with
    these. I would be looking more at mental fatigue, but there have been reports
    like that also--that people are tired of reading and don't want to go on, etc.
    Any study of perception and cognition is going to have to start with self-report,
    but that doesn't make it invalid.  \r\n\r\nAny such study is a process of refining,
    but it doesn't erase the concept of comfort, it just makes it more clear and precise
    for testing. Again, I don't see that problem. Comfort is not gone, and the whole
    thing is conceptually pretty straight forward. Finding good questions and good
    measures requires creativity, but scientists, including Kevin and his colleagues,
    have already started. And the tests are all described in a way that they can be
    reproduced. No impossibility. \r\n\r\nOn reading speed, this is words per minute.
    What is your problem about this? How do words per minute become only 'humanistic'?
    Doyouthinkicantmaketextthatslowsyoudown? Or speeds you up? Is that not objective
    and repeatable?\r\n\r\nOn comprehension, there are oodles of standardized tests
    of comprehension. Conceptually, they you just ask questions about the content,
    and how many answers are right or wrong. People will do better and worse, and
    under different conditions. Standardizing the difficulty of tests is tricky, but
    it's been done including in SAT reading tests. \r\n\r\nSo comfort, speed and comprehension
    can all be measured by objective, reproducible tests. The test I proposed is scientific--how
    good it is is another question. \r\n\r\nPeter, you are saying that 'affordance'
    is a better focus for research. I would say that 'affordance' is a concept to
    help explain better and worse readability--and other aspects of reading. And it
    may be a very useful concept, in which case we should use it. \r\n\r\nBut readability
    shouldn't then become a taboo word. You design text that is more rather than less
    readable as one of your goals, I'm sure. And I am trying to do the same for a
    typeface. \r\n\r\nScience attempts to explain the world as we experience it. In
    the process it refines the concepts, but it doesn't vanish our experience. Because
    Newton distinguished weight and mass doesn't mean that we no longer experience
    gravity. The refinements in terminology can help, but they are no reason to say
    that we can't use ordinary English concepts, or to say that gravity or readability
    can only be studied 'humanistically'. So I don't think there is any need to avoid
    the word 'readability', and *only* use technical terms like 'affordance'. \r\n\r\nBut
    in any case, I think we are in agreement that greater and lesser ease of reading
    is something that scientific research can shed light on. "

    we can recognise letters from partial information doesn't mean that we use such
    partial information during reading, and if we do -- as seems likely to me* --
    is it a direct contribution to word recognition or indirect via letter recognition.
    Being able to recognise a pair of letters from two halves and the space in between
    them doesn't mean that the basic unit of reading is not, still, the letters. Being
    able to recognise fragments of letters in sequence doesn't imply that we build
    up to word recognition through recognising half letter + space + half letter sequences;
    it implies only that we can recognise more than one letter at a time in a fixation,
    which everyone knows and no one contests.\r\n\r\n* You skipped a key aspect of
    my (first) hypothesis, which is that while the letter may be the atom, we make
    free use of both subatomic particles and molecules as we need during reading.
    But the atom sits in the middle and is what is built up to and built up from.
    I think the letter plays that role in typical typographic Latin text.\r\n\r\nBut
    I don't think we should generalise from such text. If I consider all the other
    writing systems I know about, it seems to me that the atom is what we make it,
    when we write or set type or create text in any other way. There are too many
    writing systems in which the individual identity of the letter is subsumed into
    a graphical molecule for the letter to be considered always the atomic unit. I
    think we make it the atomic unit by disconnecting it from adjacent letters and

    sensitivity, when reading road signs at night, while increasing legibility and

  body: "Peter, you wrote, \"What is being resisted is an explanation of the form:
    'x or y is actually objectively more readable because reading using x or y is
    faster or less tiring.'\" \r\n\r\nThat's not an explanation, that's a definition,
    the meaning of readability. Highly readable *means* that people can read it with
    relatively good speed, comfort and comprehension. Less readable *means* people
    can read it with less comfort, speed and comprehension.  \r\n\r\nSpeed and comprehension
    can be objectively measured, though comfort is more dicey as of yet. So what a
    scientific theory of readability should be looking for is theories that would
    explain why some texts are more readable than others. Part of the challenge of
    that development and testing is to objectively distinguish the more and less readable
    texts. So you are going to need objective measures that will reflect the fact
    that, eg. people prefer to read extended text in print rather than on screen.
    Of course there will be individual variation, and this needs to be taken into
    account in the measures--eg that over 45 are generally going to have more problems
    handling small type. \r\n\r\nThen the theory is going to have to explain why those
    measures turn up the way they do. The theory may be about the reading process
    in general, and not specifically readability, but it will need to have logical
    consequences that predict the differences in the objective measures of readability.
    \r\n\r\nIn principle, so far as I can see there nothing scientifically objectionable
    in the testing I described. It would only need to be better specified to carry
    out the tests. The theory of reading would need to explain whatever the results
    are.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    an <em>inferential judgement</em> of the form: : \u2018x or y is actually objectively
    more readible <em>since</em> reading using x or y is faster [more accurate], or
    less tiring.\u2019\u201D\r\n\r\nWhether it is or not depends on the definition,
    and a definition is a social contract. What you propose is, it seems to me, a
    proto-scientific formalization which I think confuses <em>what something is a
    function of</em> with <em>ways in which it manifests itself</em>. Science needs
    formalizations to get its investigations going. Ole Lund in his Reading PhD dissertation
    on legibility research rasied issues of \u2018construct validity\u2019 and characterized
    the kind of formalization you propose as \u2018easy operationalism.\u2019\r\n\r\nThe
    definition I might propose defines readible text as text in which rapid automatic
    visual word-form resolution is not obstructed, but actively afforded. (This presupposes
    of course that something denominatable as \u2018visual wordform resolution\u2019
    in fact exists.) I think that when type designers talk about readability, this
    way of tying it down for investigative cross-examination is more representative
    of what they're after and more cognitive-scientifically sound. That it is closer
    to the intentions of typographical practioners is reflected by the orientation
    to making optico-grammatically integral words rather than simply nice letters.\r\n\r\nIn
    any case science shouldn't be making the kinds of inferential judgements I described
    until it has a relatively accurate idea of what in actual functional terms is
    going on.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/][img:sites/default/files/old-images/]"

  body: "Nick, the Oxford concise gives two definitions: \"1. Able to read; legible.
    2. interesting or pleasant to read.\"\r\n\r\nThe first definition clearly refers
    to the visual aspect of reading. The second has to do with the quality of the
    writing. Of course \"there is more to it,\" as the reader's overall experience
    will involve both. But with a little cleverness we should be able to study the
    typographical dimension on its own. \r\n\r\nWithin typography a sophisticated
    but still pre-scientific definition of readability I quoted earlier: \"the ease
    with which the eye can absorb the message and move along the line.\"  \r\n\r\n\"Absorbing
    the message\" clearly refers to comprehension, to understanding meaning. And 'ease'
    is some kind of comfort, or lack of resistance. Since we can decipher nearly illegible
    writing by slowing down, I think an idea that we can have some speed along with
    comprehenseion is implied or understood.  \r\n\r\nYes, there's more to it, but
    the first, narrower typographic meaning is worthy of scientific study in my opinion.
    \r\n\r\nPeter, I don't see that I am making much of any inference here about the
    underlying mechanisms of reading--of how we go from the printed page or screen
    to understanding. The only thing I pointed out is that two aspects have been operationalized:
    speed and comprehension. The third, comfort, has not been operationalized successfully
    yet. I suggested two possible measurable correlates of the subjective experience
    of discomfort or difficulty with the visual aspect of reading: reduction in comprehension
    with time and decline in proof-reading accuracy. One would have to test to see
    whether either of these is any good. I have proposed no short-cut or 'easy operationalization'
    here. It's difficult, but if achieved would be enlightening. \r\n\r\nThen once
    you have such measures, you have the challenge of explaining their behavior in
    different circumstance. But at least you have something measurable, beyond the
    general self-report of comfort or discomfort. That I think would be a plus for
    further research. \r\n\r\nAs you know, I think that technical terms should be
    introduced only when necessary, and then with clear definitions. When you write
    your definition of readability as \"readable text as text in which rapid automatic
    visual word-form resolution is not obstructed, but actively afforded,\" your technical
    terms smuggle in assumptions that may not be correct. \r\n\r\n1. It may be that
    part of good readability, is having short words, such as \r\na, an, the, that
    have sufficient markers that the brain is able to skip and never read them. The
    meaning may be derived from a sub-set of words in many sentences.\r\n\r\n2. Secondly,
    it might be that we can go directly from letters to meanings of whole phrases--the
    'bouma' extends over multiple words. I don't think this is true, but your terminology
    assumes it rather than investigating it.\r\n\r\n3. Finally when you nominalize
    and use the term 'affordance' you are creating something that seems to be a single
    variable that may turn out to have a number of independent processes going on,
    and the single term is not useful. I greatly respect your insights into the reading
    process, as you know, but I do think that introducing technical terms quickly
    is a serious obstacle to communication and may even muddy the waters conceptually
    . \r\n\r\nYou may object that 'readability' also implies a single variable, but
    that's not the case, because it is not being used as a technical term. As a general
    rule, terms that emerge out of peoples' experience represent something real, and
    that's why science would do well to respect them as a starting point, and only
    replace them with a very good reason.  "

    and insight.   \r\n\r\n>Besides, a lovely lucidly explained mistaken theory is

    heart of the matter. \r\n\r\nA lucidly explained mistaken theory is just as false
    as an obscurely explained mistaken theory. There is, however, an all-important
    difference: the flaws in the lucidly explained are much easier to detect and correct.
    \r\n\r\nIn Popper's view the power of scientific method results from scientific
    theories being formulated in a testable way--they can be checked against observation
    and experiment. The result is that errors are detected and corrected, and knowledge
    grows by creative dialog and research informing that dialog. \r\n\r\nMore generally,
    any kind of critical discussion, including of politics and art, is furthered by
    clarity. Clarity enables people to correct and build upon the ideas developed
    by others. That's why clarity is a fundamental virtue in the critical tradition,
    a tradition that began with the ancient Greeks. \r\n\r\nPopper rarely, and maybe
    never in print, discussed those he regarded as obscurantists, such as Heidegger.
    The reason is that he thought they had abandoned the critical tradition--a fundamental
    betrayal of science and of liberty in his view. He so despised them for the betrayal
    that he wouldn't honor them by criticizing them, or even mentioning them. I don't
    think his policy was wise, but I do think he was right about the importance of
    clarity to the growth of knowledge.   \r\n\r\nOften obscurity is a shield against
    criticism, and sometimes it's even a way to bamboozle people into thinking that
    your ideas are much deeper than they are. --That's what Popper thought about Heidegger.
    But even in the most innocent case, obscurity deters criticism. And that is not
    a merit but a liability for the growth of knowledge and the further enlightenment
    of humanity.   \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n "

    is supposedly a critique--as the comments point out, the scroll he is measuring
    comes from his own head, not nature. Yet the initial impression is Heroic, with
    the great strength and intelligence of the figure. I'd like to know more about
    Blake's view of it...\r\n\r\nThe most important anti-scientific Romantic was Goethe
    in his early years. He not only criticized the 'grey world of Newton', but tried
    to develop an alternative romantic way of doing science. And in particular he
    had a new and different theory of color. This in turn inspired the German Naturphilosophen,
    Fichte, Hegel and Schelling. The most interesting fact about this effort is that
    it was an abject failure, a failure of romanticism to produce an alternative version
    of science that actually could have predictive power in observation and experiment.
    This story, if I remember correctly, is in Emil Meyerson's book De l'Explication
    dans les Sciences.  \r\n\r\nIn the next generation, the great Helmholtz made important
    discoveries in the physiology and psychology of vision, including color. Inspired
    by the discoveries that shadows are actually colored and that the eye sees sharply
    only at the center of vision, the Impressionists developed their new style of
    painting. \r\n\r\nThis kind of healthy interaction between science and art, exemplified
    by Helmholtz on one side, and Renoir and Degas, and so on on the other, is I think
    the right model. I expect the same kind of fruitful interaction between advances
    in the science of reading and type design and graphic design. \r\n\r\n\r\n"

    readability is something which science is unable to address -- \"that's not even
    a question\".\r\nWe're talking about the readability of a holistic design--a page
    at the least--and seeing if we can pre-determine its readability based on data
    about its components. Or vice versa--seeing if we can predict the readability
    of a type design independent of the layout, or of the layout independent of the
    type design. Science can't do that, there are too many inter-related variables
    that will interfer with the predictable readability of anything but the most standard,
    clich\xE9d formats. \r\nIt would be like trying to determine the liveability of
    a building or the driveability of a car, just from knowledge of the components.
    \r\n\r\nSo agnosticism would be the correct approach, not blind faith that the
    behavioralist method can be applied to any kind of human activity with favorable
    results.\r\n\r\nTypes and layouts evolve, which is why periodicals redesign. The
    readability quotient needs an upgrade. \r\n\r\n<em>Since you seem so hung up on

    be reduced to a formula.\r\n\r\nYes, that's design, but its not science. Both
    can be wonderful in their own way. I think this gap between our views is because
    you are applying standards of art to science, and so finding science wanting--for
    the wrong reasons. \r\n\r\nAs Peter says, there is a core of truth in what you
    are thinking, but my view is that your application of that truth is misdirected.\r\n\r\nArt
    is interested in the whole experience. If a novel reads like a clinical study
    of a mental problem, it is a failure. The goal of literary works is to convey
    a whole way of looking at experience, not to analyze particular problems in a
    way you can act on. Science, by contrast, is focused on specific truths. If these
    truths cover a wider range of phenomena, all the better, but it's not necessary.
    The main thing is that you can measure and test empirically whatever you assert.
    \ \r\n\r\nSimilarly to art, a good design needs to work holistically, and it's
    not important to identify or even understand all the ingredients that go into
    that experience. Much of the creative process is unconscious and intuitive, as
    you say--and almost all of the reader's. The important thing is the whole experience
    of the reader. And I agree that it is not a realistic goal for science to understand
    that whole experience, at least for a very long time to come. \r\n\r\nIt is not
    that either the artistic or the scientific approach is flawed, but rather that
    each has its strengths and limitations. And as I said, they can learn from each
    other. I already gave the example of Helmholtz and the Impressionists. But it
    also goes the other way around. Dostoevsky's novels portrayed emotionally distressed
    people as thinking in black and white: I am a hero, or no, maybe a villain. I
    am magnificant, or no, maybe a worm. You are my best friend, or no, my worst enemy.
    This pattern was picked up by psychologists Freud and Adler, and it seems to have
    survived into today's cognitive clinical psychology as a marker of distressed
    thinking. \r\n\r\nSo we can honor and learn from both approaches without seeing
    one as a threat to the other. Yes Newton analyzed gravity, but that doesn't stop
    people from dancing.  "

    in the typeface must also vary for optimum what-ever-it-is-you-want-to-measure.
    So these must be altered too: the size of the aperture to the lower counter, and
    the relative size of the capitals and their counters, and even the genre of the
    type, for a large upper counter on an e is not good for an oldstyle. The size
    of the e's counter is not a measurement, it's a style.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Pes_5198.jpg]"

    \r\n\r\nWhat I think I get from your descriptions is that, in your way of thinking,

    readibility has to do with the total picture, or rather, specifically with all

    distinguished from legibility, because these writers thought that there was more
    to making a text block easy to read than having the letters clear and distinguishable
    from one another. This specialized meaning evolved by the 1960s, but I wouldn\u2019t
    be surprised if it were much earlier.</em>\r\n\r\nFor what it's worth, Dwiggins
    in 1947 does not seem to be making that distinction:\r\n\r\n<em>A type face is
    good if it is easy to read. No concession that interferes with ease of reading
    may be made either to beauty of appearance or to mechanical felicity. Legibility
    is the basic law, the sine qua non.</em>\r\n"

  body: "There are several ways. We could ask a person to read something then answer
    some questions about the text and look at how quickly they read. We could look
    at how often they confuse character, as was done in a test looking at the relative
    legibility of Constantia, Cambria, and TNR. The only problem is that  it would
    take a large study size to get a satisfyingly low p-value.\r\nBy characteristic
    associating, I mean that fonts w/ open counters usually have long descenders (hypothetical,
    you could probably name real examples of something like this), thereby confounding
    any findings on either."

    information about? Its perceptual processing component? And by that should we
    mean only what occurs inside the visual cortex? What about the other dimensions
    of readability that typographers are convinced exist?\r\n\r\nVariables associating
    is exactly Nick\u2019s point. He regards the confounding effect as insurmountable
    when it comes to isolating factors in any useful way. An disassociating them for
    the purpose of our tests creates bad type."
