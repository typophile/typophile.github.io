  an example of the E without the ornamentation for a cleaner reference.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Screenshot

  body: "LP Released in 1958. The ornamented E is in an 19th century style, originated
    by Joseph Gill\xE9 circa 1820,  in which the bottom half is ornamented and the
    top plain. This is usually done with the bottom half in a \"Tuscan\" style, i.e.
    with the bottom terminal split into two or three flaring lobes. Lots of digital
    versions  in that style. See for example the Font Mesa offerings. Unfortunately,
    I do not recall offhand a digital version of this precise design.\r\nThere may
    have been a photolettering era font, or this might have been created from an old
    image of the letter.\r\nDon"
