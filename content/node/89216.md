  /> \r\n\r\nWinco family can be labelled a humanist sans-serif, but in spirit it
  is more closely related to that rather rare typeface category called glyphic or
  incise. \r\nGlyphic faces occupy a place roughly half-way between seriffed renaissance
  book faces and sans-serifs. The classic examples are Optima (Hermann Zapf) and Albertus
  (Berthold Wolpe), with Pascal (Jos\xE9 Mendoza) sometimes mentioned as a more calligraphically
  inspired cousin to Optima. Instead of serifs, these types have flared strokes, or,
  analysed the other way around, are tapered in the middle \u2014 they are characterized
  by what the Germans and Dutch call \u2018Verj\xFCngung/verjonging\u2019, literally:
  rejuvenation. \r\nThis characteristic is generally seen as a reference to letters
  carved into stone or, in the case of Albertus, bronze \u2014 hence the names glyphic
  and incise. The proportions are generally humanist, i.e., closer related to those
  of oldstyle and renaissance book type than to the more mechanic construction of
  the industrial and geometric sans-serifs made popular by modernist graphic design.

  /> \r\n\r\nWhile occupying a class of their own in most type categorizations, \u2018incises\u2019
  seem an underrepresented genre when looking exclusively at printing types. Even
  in stone carving they can hardly be called the norm \u2014 straight-lined roman
  capitals and geometric solutions are at least as common. However, the balance is
  somewhat readjusted when taking into account the project-specific hand-lettering
  of the mid-20th century. Of the many individualist alphabets drawn for book covers
  and posters roughly between 1950 and 1965, a great many of them were calligraphically
  inspired letterforms with lively, tapered strokes, that could be labelled as \u2018incises\u2019.
  Their designers were based in Germany, the Netherlands, Britain and elsewhere; but
  their pedigree is essentially German and Austrian. In Holland and England a tradition
  of rather rigid, constructed lettershapes was loosened up and humanized by input
  from the German-speaking world. For instance, both Dutchman Boudewijn Ietswaart
  and British lettering artist Michael Harvey have stated that the post-1945 book
  jackets by Dutch-based German designer Helmut Salden were a crucial influence on
  their approach to lettering. \r\nWhile conceiving Winco, Ramiro Espinoza studied
  the work of these masters of postwar book cover design. He also looked into German
  tradition of expressive printing types that had such a strong presence in the earliest
  decades of the 20th century \u2014 Espinoza mentions Arpke Antiqua and Globus Cursive
  as indirect influences on his new type family.\r\n\r\n<img src='http://www.re-type.com/newsletter/retype/images/schetsen.png'
  /> \r\n\r\nHaving established a stylistic framework, Espinoza designed the typeface
  from scratch, independently from any existing piece of lettering. This allowed him
  to create an original, typographically consistent and versatile family in five weights,
  from Light to Ultra Black. Instead of taking cues from the details of any specific
  original, Espinoza worked with more abstract guidelines in mind: rhythm, angularity
  and calligraphic origin. This is specially noticeable In the italics, which are
  strongly calligraphic in nature. The step-by-step process has resulted in a typeface
  that successfully combines the high legibility and seriousness of a text face with
  the expressiveness, dynamism and subtle irreverence of the original hand-rendered
  alphabets. \r\n\r\nWinco is a versatile family whose extreme weights \u2014 Light,
  Black and Ultra Black \u2014 make for striking headlines, while the middle weights
  work well in both display and text settings. Produced as CFF OpenType fonts, all
  weights come with small caps and multiple numeral sets, including superscript, subscript
  and fractions, alternate glyphs, and ligatures, making Winco a typographically sophisticated
  family suitable for a wide range of editorial and corporate work.\r\n\r\nWinco family

    Winco edge.\r\nAnd the \u201Csome serifs\u201D on c and s give it a distinctive
    personality.\r\nWinco compares well with recent glyphic releases Carter Sans and
    Ideal Sans.\r\nI haven\u2019t seen any commercial use of either of those well-publicized
    faces, so I hope Ramiro\u2019s does better.\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Hi there,\r\nI've been thinking on the 'incise' genre. When you take a look
    to the most relevant examples of this category (Optima, Pascal, etc.) one thing
    is evident: they have roman faces's contrast (high). I think, in a way, they are
    unfair to their sans nature, or maybe too ambiguous. After all, when you choose
    a sans is mostly because you need robustness and a modern look. \r\nWhen I designed
    Winco I avoided high contrast. I just wanted a sans with attitude and quirkiness,
    and exploring expressionism and forgotten book jacket alphabets was a way find
    the creative framework.\r\nIn my opinion Winco leans more toward some humanist
    sans with modulated strokes like, for example, FB Productus. "
