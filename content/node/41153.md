  different publications, particularly those published by the Smithsonian. A large
  number of the anthropology and linguistics books I read from the 1910s through to
  the 1970s were published in this typeface. I have no idea what it is, but I\u2019ve
  been curious for a long time.\r\n\r\nAttached is a scan from a book printed in 1972
  by the US GPO for the Smithsonian. I apologize for the poor quality of the scan,
  but it\u2019s the only thing that I happen to have and I don\u2019t have a working
  scanner at the moment.\r\n\r\nCan anyone identify this typeface? I can try to get
  a better scan in a couple of days if necessary."

    McGrew's book on metal typefaces. (Image from my Serif Guide doesn't show SC face,

  body: "Looking at an old (1930's) Linotype metal type catalog, I find that Century
    Expanded had a small caps face, not surprisingly.\r\n\r\nJan is probably right
    about the typeface, which had SC versions in metal, if not digital form.\r\n\r\n-

  body: "I had wondered if it was Century, but was suspicious because the digital
    versions looked much more flimsy. I guess that\u2019s the difference between digital
    type and real metal type pressed into paper.\r\n\r\nDid Century Expanded have
    Greek too? The stuff I read is full of IPA-ish and Greek characters in both upright
    and italic/oblique forms. If not then the GPO must have had a special set cut
    for them, at least in the 12 point used for body text. Some of the works I\u2019ve
    read include lots of different diacritics too, so I\u2019d guess that these were
    custom additions to the font.\r\n\r\nThe reason I\u2019m curious is that I have
    a dream of someday reprinting/republishing some of the old texts I work with,
    helped by the fact that many are either out of copyright or never were copyrighted
    being government works. I\u2019ve seen photostatic reprints, but these make for
    absolutely horrible reading with the degrading, turds and hair, and lacunae. The
    books and articles are getting very hard to find, and were never printed in large
    numbers to begin with."

  body: "Regarding De Vinne, myfonts.com says \u201CThis revival of the Bruce Foundry\u2019s
    No. 11 is typical of the nineteenth century types derived from the work of Didot
    and Bodoni; the face remains popular with lawyers and government printers. In
    fact, Theodore Low De Vinne opposed this kind of design as hard to print and read;
    he had Century designed to replace it.\u201D\r\n\r\nI can\u2019t tell whether
    the books I\u2019ve got are set in De Vinne or Century, they\u2019re so similar.
    I\u2019ll look to see if they\u2019ve got the very curly ? or the less curly one.
    That should be enough to distinguish the two, yes?"
