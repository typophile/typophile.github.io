  body: "As the <a href=\"http://www.cubancouncil.com\" target=\"_blank\">Cuban Council</a>
    is '<em>a small interactive agency which specializes in creating simply superb
    solutions for web and print and such</em>' Id say this may as well be a 'custom'
    made logotype, which obviously wouldnt be too hard to do..\r\n\r\n<em>( But, as
    Marc stated, '<a href=\"http://www.houseind.com/index.php?page=showfont&id=4&subpage=viewfonts\"
    target=\"_blank\">Chalet '70</a>' with an added, rounded outline, would be a nice
    alternate, if you are looking for an existing type instead.. )</em>"
