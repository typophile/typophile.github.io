  body: Very similar to Avenir which is based on Futura and Erbar. Although none of
    the samples I've seen quite fit the bill.

  body: This is an old metal Futura-like face called Vogue. Vanity Fair magazine's
    typeface is based on it, but that's proprietary and I don't know of any other
    digital versions.

  body: "Hi\r\nThanks for your answers, it sure looks like vanity fair's font face,
    but look at the \"a\", it's not the same shape as futura's.\r\nBut the caps are
    really look alike.\r\nI looked after the Vogue typeface on myfonts.com, and it
    doesn't look the same, maybe it's not the version you talked about ?"

  body: You could also look at Bernhard Gothic, not a match but definitely a similar
    feel.

    is the same. Here is an earlier discussion about the original:\r\n\r\nhttp://typophile.com/node/730\r\n\r\n"

    body: Thanks a lot, it's exactly the same, though I wasn't sure cause of the weight.
      Do you have any further information on it ? I'm actually digitalizing it, the
      only things I have at the moment is a French book composed with it in two weights
      and sizes, and now, thanks to you, the name. I'm gonna try to find old typefaces
      books too...

  body: "Yea! After searching for Vogue for several years, I happened upon \u201CAm
    Sans\u201D at daFont yesterday. Volker Busse digitized the font (using a few characters
    from Futura). I\u2019m really pleased since I was beginning to think this font
    had been lost forever. Volker\u2019s font used a few of the special no. 2 characters
    and, unfortunately, a Futura question mark. I\u2019m really pleased to find this
    gem! Here\u2019s the link at daFont: http://www.dafont.com/am-sans.font\r\n\r\nBill\r\n"

  body: William that isn't Vogue and even if it were it isn't a very refined representation
    of a font. It might suit some uses, but in most cases it is not useful.
