body: "Hi!\r\nI need to design one of those \"this pack free\" yellow and red horrors
  and it has to fit in a space that's 16,5cm x 6cm. I've tried with different weights
  of helvetica but obviously there's a lot of space left. And they want me to do it
  vertical... Any ideas of what can I do? I've thought of splitting the words in couples
  of two letters but they don't seem to like it.\r\n\r\nThanks a lot!"

  body: If you're not comfortable drawing type yourself, why not hire a type designer?
    You're bound to need some customization to get this right and it might be easier
    to start from scratch.

    a day if it were up to me!\r\n\r\nI think I'll try to convince them to leave some
    empty space. Stretching the type would give me serious nightmares. Placard looks
    awesome though.\r\n\r\nThank you so much!"

  body: My pleasure, Alexandra. I just now (honestly) did remember Knock-Out and Champion
    by Hoefler. They are very wood type. But might have worked for you. But there
    you go.
