  font. I know I've seen it somewhere before, but I can't seem to put my finger on
  it.\r\n\r\nhttp://img.photobucket.com/albums/v150/unmei_shinpai/g2lof-phoenix-wright.png\r\n(Trying
  to identify the font in 'Ace Attorney')\r\n\r\nAny help would be appreciated. I
  also cropped it down and put it through whatthefont as well as a few other font
  recognition websites with no luck. I have no idea how those work, so it could possibly
  be the large stroke around the lettering cause it to give me funny results. Who
  knows."
