body: "I normally wouldn't ask for help with something like this since I am a control
  freak and generally knowledgeable but I am redesigning a magazine in a hurry and
  was looking for input since you guys and gals know your stuff. I am looking for
  a good legible sans serif with a modern touch but without the goofy flourishes that
  many of the modern humanist faces have \u2013 basically I'm looking for a Trade
  Gothic but with an edge. It needs to have a big family (condensed, three or four
  weights and italics a must). The Bold faces need to be cover-line solid and because
  the magazine has a humorous tone, it needs to be able to carry that tone as well.
  Trade Gothic was great for Vice Magazine when I was there because it had this exact
  quality but it's too visibly dated for this magazine, which is trying to be more
  modern to go with the rebranding of the company.\r\n\r\nI'd say the closest I've
  gotten is FF Bau, which is nice and classy with a potential for humour but its heavier
  faces are just a touch clunky and Kabel-ish for my taste.\r\n\r\nAny help appreciated
  - even just suggesting foundries to check out (Font Bureau is good - I bought our
  slab serif font \u2013 Dispatch \u2013 there). I've got FontFont's book of fonts
  being delivered as well so hopefully that will turn up some things. \r\n\r\nthanks\r\n\r\nedit:
  I should note that currently the magazine is using Myriad Pro and while it's fine
  for a women's health magazine or Punch Bowl Monthly, it is killing me with it it's
  complete lack of sleekness. \r\n\r\nwww.3eige.com  |  www.arstechnica.com"

  body: have you tried looking at anything from Village (http://www.vllg.com) or Process
    Type Foundry (http://www.processtypefoundry.com/)? Both offer some nice contemporary
    sans serif faces, though I am unsure as to what you mean by 'goofy flourishes'.

  body: I don't toot my horn here too much, but I might suggest my own <a href="http://www.ms-studio.com/FontSales/proximanova.html">Proxima
    Nova</a>... sounds like it might be the kind of thing you are looking for.

  body: Proxima Nova is really nice but I find the eye (or is it the bowl?) of the
    a to be a little less sleek and more towards the too fun for a copy font.

  body: "So I think I'm going to go with FB Antenna. I bought a few variants last
    night (the whole collection is $1500!) and it's great for cover lines and since
    we're only running shorter sidebar copy and decks in the sans-serif, it is perfect.
    \r\n\r\nI'm a bit of a hyprocrite though - it's got a foot on the l, but it's
    less extreme than others I've seen. \r\n\r\nNow to find a serif font... \r\n\r\nAny
    suggestions? We're using Utopia now but I would like something with a bit more
    to it to go with the Dispatch/Antenna combination. "

    body: it's a lovely font for sure but I think it's a bit too bookish for the mag.
      We're somewhere between Esquire and Radar magazine.
