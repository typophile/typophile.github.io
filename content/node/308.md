  body: I feel that &#34;a&#34; is stronger because it is bolder, which is something
    I think would help in print work. I don&#39;t like one of the letters touching
    and the rest not touching. I would like to see more touching or none touching.  <BR>

  body: Thank you, Tom, i think i understand your thoughts.. <BR> <BR>I also like
    your slightly changed version.. <BR>&#40; But, the &#39;f&#39; now somehow seems
    more like a &#39;t&#39; to me.. &#41;

  body: David - I was just at your site the other day and admired <BR>the logo. No
    need to change it. Tom&#39;s revision works well. <BR>I still see the &#39;f&#39;.
    <BR> <BR>And Happy Birthday!

  body: I agree with Tom that I would prefer to see <BR>all the types &#34;untouched&#34;
    or if touched,  <BR>at least one more combination. <BR>But as it concerns serif
    or sans serif <BR>I would recommend to give more boldness <BR>to the serif version
    before you judge which. <BR>I think that you will have a very intersting <BR>result
    if you make the contrast a lot more, <BR>plus I would see it in a more condensed
    version <BR>and more tight spacing. <BR> <BR>As for the &#34;f&#34; Tom suggets,
    I think is legible. <BR> <BR>christos <BR> <BR>PS. Happy Birthday David!

    some kind of &#39;medium <BR>weight&#39; for the serif version.. Maybe i will
    <BR>try and play some more with it and post the <BR>results later on.. <BR> <BR>&#40;

  body: David, <BR> <BR>The &#40;r&#41; and the &#40;m&#41; seem too large/wide in
    comparison with the other characters. I&#39;m sure it is a spacing issue. The
    open areas of those letters are larger than what you&#39;ve left for the &#40;s&#41;.
    The &#40;o&#41; seems to work in comparison to the &#40;r&#41; and the &#40;m&#41;,
    but still the &#40;f&#41; and the &#40;s&#41; ... As Tom demonstrated, the &#40;f&#41;
    and &#40;o&#41; should perhaps not touch. and then add space in between the &#40;sos&#41;.
    The arm of the &#40;r&#41; seems too large. The &#40;f&#41; seems too low, it
    is crowding the &#40;o&#41;, and now that I notice this, maybe the &#40;s&#41;
    is crowding the &#40;m&#41;? <BR> <BR>Two more thoughts. &#40;1&#41; What if the
    serifs were more slab like? &#40;2&#41; What if you add more contrast? <BR> <BR>I
    think I do prefer the sans, but I can see potential in the serif.

  body: '<b>hi all,</b> <BR> <BR>i&#39;m happy to have found this really fine discussion
    board! i hopy my english is good enough to express myself on a typo forum - i
    don&#39;t know most of the numerous technical terms, i&#39;m afraid. <BR> <BR>on
    the topic i&#39;d like to say: <BR> <BR><b>1.</b> like Tom Cannon &#40;et. al.&#41;,
    i find the serif version too light for a logo and a bit to &#34;sweet&#34; &#40;but,
    like Tiffany, i think there may be room for improvements&#41;. <BR> <BR><b>1.1.</b>
    while the spacing in the first serif version seems a bit to loose around the &#34;rm&#34;...
    <BR> <BR><b>1.2.</b> ...the second serif version looks a bit to narrow around
    the &#34;ml&#34; to me. <BR> <BR><b>2.</b> like HD Schellnack, i find the sans
    serif version a bit too playful. the sort of diagonally crossed out &#34;o&#34;,
    the angled lower ends of the stems of the &#34;r&#34; and &#34;m&#34; and the
    peaks at the upper left side of the &#34;r&#34; and &#34;m&#34; &#40;i don&#39;t
    know a better word&#41; are too much and, in parts, not at all necessary, IMO.
    that&#39;s why i played around with tho logo for some minutes and came up with
    this &#34;cleaned up&#34; version, which i think i like better: <BR> <BR><img
    src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/11947.gif" alt=""> <BR> <BR><b>what
    i&#39;ve done:</b> <BR> <BR><b>a.</b> i cut off the stems of the &#34;r&#34; and
    &#34;m&#34; both on their lower and upper end <BR><b>b.</b> i took over Tom Cannon&#39;s
    &#34;f&#34; &#40;which is easily recognized as an &#34;f&#34;, IMO, but has more
    room too breathe&#41; <BR><b>c.</b> i changed the spacing a bit &#40;narrower
    around the &#34;orml&#34;&#41; <BR> <BR><b>additional thoughts:</b> <BR> <BR><b>d.</b>
    the letters should be heavier &#40;i haven&#39;t changed that&#41; <BR><b>f.</b>
    if you decide to keep the crossed out &#34;o&#34; for reasons of originality,
    i&#39;d rather cross it vertically instead of diagonally &#40;i tried that&#41;.
    either way, the &#34;o&#34; would become too light, i guess. <BR> <BR>regards
    <BR>peter'
