  this is the Intel CEO saying \"When Eric asked me if I had any sacred cows, I said
  no. He asked, what around the dropped \"e\"? And I said if it makes sense, it's
  time to do it. He was given pretty free rein to change. \r\n\r\nAnd when I saw [the
  new logo], it just jumped out at me. It reflected that change, where we want to
  go. There's a feeling of movement around [the new logo], and the tag line \"Leap
  Ahead\" certainly reiterates that.\"\r\n\r\nhttp://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/06_02/b3966009.htm\r\n\r\nAnd
  there you have over 30 years of brand equity and recognition swooped away."

    a little disconcerting that this somehow is part of a new corporate trend in homogeneous
    branding via \"marketingspeak\". Sort of reminds me of the explosion of high-tech
    engingeering firms of the '80s when EVERY logo was either in Helvetica or Eurostile/Microgramma."

  body: '''Leap ahead'' seems to me a most unfortunate tag line. ''Ahead'' suggests
    a highway warning of some kind, that one is going to encounter something ahead
    if one keeps going. And what is one going to encounter? A leap. What kind of leap?
    A leap over something? Alarming, but presumably survivable. Or a leap into something?
    An abyss perhaps.'

  body: "I like the notion of making one logo combining the feeling of the old but
    ugly \"Intel Inside\" mark withe the basic intel logo to create one brand.  I
    actually like the new type except for the \"e\" which looks like straight AG and
    does not marry well with the rest.  I do miss the dropped positioning of the e
    but wonder if it would work in that new configuration.\r\nThe big thing is that,
    branding speak aside, I don't think it shows any \"change in direction\" or any
    of the tired old \"feeling of movement\".\r\nIt seems like in today's world, you
    \"rebrand\" every 30 days whether you need it or not--kinda makes the Vice President
    for Marketing feel very important.\r\n\r\nChrisL"

    their asses and start opening their minds to the kinds of things that innovative
    design consultants have to offer these days. there is so much talent in the design
    community and some of the biggest, most influential companies are letting their
    indentities go down the toilet with these tired, overused design clich\xE9s. i
    am totally blown away and left with a feeling of great disappointment.\r\n\r\ni
    recently reviewed the threads here and on Speak Up regarding the AT&T (or at&t)
    rebrand and although <em>that</em> was controversial, this brings us to a new
    low. i'm sorry, but the fact that a company like this will go for something this
    bad is bad for us all.\r\n\r\nChris\u2013 i agree about the fact that ego plays
    a huge role in most of these re-brands. i just hope that some of these corporate
    big wigs start to realize that good strategy and good business are more important
    things to take pride in.\r\n\r\n------------\r\nnc"

  body: My problem with rebranding isn't with the look(s) but with the implementation.
    You have to change packaging, signs, stationary etc. Its a huge task and needs
    to be planned because it takes time and a lot of money. Look at UPS it took them
    a couple of years to just get their trucks converted to the new logo. So change
    for change sake is a huge mistake.

    if that change is intended to be the harbinger of the future. Indeed if this IS
    the harbinger of the future, then buy AMD stock now.\r\n\r\nNick: I think you
    are bang on about PR and Graphic Design being a formidable combination.\r\n\r\nWhile
    I never really like the 'Intel Inside' logo and swoop, I always thought the 'intel'
