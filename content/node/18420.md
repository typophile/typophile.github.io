      about ordering it, because the website states it has a European DVD country
      code. (I'm in the US.)\r\nDoes anybody know if it is available from a US vendor
      (country code 1)?\r\n"

  body: "\"A wonderful 45-minutes documentary created by Frutiger\u2019s nephew Christoph
    Frutiger who is a professional camera operator. The film is beautifully shot and
    very thoughtful\"\r\n\r\nFor once I'd like to disagree with you Adam. ;)\r\nI
    purchased the film with great expectations, and yes, maybe Christoph is a professional
    camera operator and did very poethic shots, but he does not care much about typography
    or type design. I found that there is an enourmous amount of personal information
    about Frutiger's life that I would have easily omitted. I was quite frustrated,
    as not much from the art of Mr. Frutiger was extracted and too much drama was
    added. \r\n\r\nThis is just my opinion, but I felt like if a great opportunity
    was lost... a well meritted homage to one of the greatest type designer and a
    great contribution to type history.\r\n\r\nI'll have to see it again for the third
    or fourth time, and see if my opinion changes, but I was indeed disapointed...\r\n\r\n\r\nno
    one take it personal!\r\ncheers,\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Gjubert, \r\n\r\nactually, what I liked about the film was that it showed
    Frutiger as somebody who is much more than \"just a type designer\". I think showing
    typography on film just won't work and I'm grateful that Christoph did not attempt
    that. For that, we have Frutiger's books. But the film beautifully puts together
    some of Frutiger's creation in context of the Swiss surroundings, nature and Frutiger's
    philosophy. I had hoped that it won't be a just another \"tell me the Frutiger
    facts that I didn't know\" production because -- well, I know quite a few *facts*
    so I wasn't looking for them. \r\n\r\nSufficient to say that I was supposed to
    do a 1.5-hour lecture on Frutiger's work for a small group of students in Warsaw
    two weeks ago. On the train, on my way to Warsaw, I watched the film -- it has
    been lying around on my shelf for half a year or so but I only decided to see
    it in the last moment, so to say. After I watched the film, I immediately decided
    that I'll cut my own content of the lecture by half and will show the film to
    the students. Within one day -- when I was already there -- I translated and --
    heh heh -- dubbed myself all the commentary into Polish and home-produced a Polish
    version. It took me about 7 hours, credit to the wonderful Apple GarageBand 3,
    and it was the first time in my life that I did such a thing :) \r\n\r\nThe students
    loved the film as a complement to my 45 minutes of \"Frutiger facts\". I'd like
    to get the film published in Poland (with my Polish translation) :) \r\n\r\nAnother
    great video that I can recommend is the Golgonooza video (http://www.manifoldmedia.com/
    ). It is a documentation of Dan Carr's punchutting work made by Gahlord Dewald.
    I liked it as well. \r\n\r\nA.\r\n"

  body: "In Spain there is a say that says \"rectificar es de sabios\"...\r\nSomething
    like, \"it is never to late to change an opinion\"...\r\n\r\nAs said I have revisited
    Adrian's Frutiger DVD, \r\n\"The man of black and white\" and would like to\r\nretract
    and extend about my comments.\r\n\r\nI did enjoy the very well done documentary\r\nabout
    this Master's life and i think it is a very complete piece,\r\nvery carefuly documented
    and put together,\r\nin a short development of a time line,\r\nand with lots of
    love and care for subject.\r\n\r\nThe work of Frutiger is treated with beautiful
    respect,\r\nand his comments are extremly inteligent and deep.\r\nAll toghether
    a very recomended view to anyone who\r\ncares about subject and has the same fascination
    about \r\nletterforms, symbols, type and design as we all here share,\r\nand to
    whom we all owe to Mr. Frutiger.\r\n\r\nI think my previous posting had more to
    do regarding style.\r\nI think it doesnt help being a designer myself (not a type
    designer), \r\nengaged to a documentarist cinematographer,\r\nand also being young
    and pasionate....\r\n\r\nWhat I intended to say in my previous posting,\r\nand
    which opinion the third viewing of the film didnt alter,\r\nis that i have certain
    stylistics dislikes with how some images,\r\nthe music and the off-voice is treated.
    \r\n\r\nI even switched a couple of times in between the english version\r\nand
    the french one too. in order to check my thinking, but\r\nfor me too many zoom
    in and zoom out effects, \r\nextreme orchestation in music, overacted translations,\r\nwould
    be the remarks...\r\n\r\nBut again, those are just stylistic considerations,\r\nthat
    should not rest any value to a great work about a great Master,\r\ndone with lots
    of respect and love. \r\n\r\nFor that I'd like to congratulate Christoph.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBtw.
    I ordered my copy from Linotype\r\nand seems to be multiregion, or at least work
    in the US region code.\r\n\r\n\r\nOh. Adam,\r\nif you wish I could traslate the
    content to Spanish,\r\nso you could add an extra language to the polish new version.\r\nI
    would not mind doing it, but you should have to dubbe it for me. ;)\r\nAnyhow
    I'll see you in NYC and we can talk more about it.\r\n\r\nBUY THIS DVD. IS WORTH
    EVERY PENNY!\r\n\r\nGiovanni Jubert.\r\n"
