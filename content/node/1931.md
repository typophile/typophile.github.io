body: Hi everyone- <BR>I have a project here &#40;I am a student&#41; that I am hoping
  to get some feedback on. <BR> <BR>The assignment &#40;given by Keith Tam&#41; is
  to take a raw text screenplay and typographically design it so that it would be
  suitable for publishing in book form. Any and all comments, suggestions, remarks,
  gripes, moans and even praises are gladly welcomed! I really appreciate it. <BR>
  <BR>Included is one spread &#40;sorry so small&#41; and two details. <BR> <BR><img

  body: 1&#41; An upright snippet in a body of italics is problematic. <BR>I think
    fake-slanting the smallcaps might be less bad. <BR>2&#41; In all-caps setting
    Tarzana&#39;s &#34;Y&#34; is ruinous. Make a <BR>custom non-descending version.

    the smallcaps, it feels quite off to me.  <BR>Perhaps I will try just a bold italic?

  body: The sometimes random-seeming allcaps in the stage directions of screenplays
    is something I would want to downplay as much as possible. On the typed script,
    the format carries through to the character names preceding each line of dialogue,
    and generally is meant to help the cast members find every instance of their part.
    In a book treatment, it doesn&#39;t make a lot of sense. <BR> <BR>If you must
    have some indication of which words in the original script were in allcaps, I
    think smallcaps is the answer. Bold, I think, would be worse, calling too much
    attention. The thing is, I don&#39;t see these as smallcaps. They appear to be
    the same size as regular caps, or maybe a point smaller. They should be running
    with the x-height, or at least close to it. <BR> <BR>I am curious as to why Mr
    Helpmann&#39;s name is italicized in the interviewer&#39;s first line.

  body: 'Ok, here&#39;s some stuff about the logic of the standard screenplay format,
    which has to be strictly followed by authors to even get read. Then comments on
    your redesign. <BR> <BR>The standard screenplay format is probably one of the
    most exacting and worked out formats of any medium. There are whole books on it.  <BR>
    <BR>Screenplays must be submitted in Courier 12pt on letter size paper and the
    standard formatting, because when this is done, each page is about one minute
    of screen time. Thus it is a guide first for the author and then for the prospective
    buyer, then for the director, etc. Any movie that runs longer than 2 hrs. is not
    likely to get made. And there are audience expectations, such as how much time
    you have to set up the plot &#40;10-15 minutes = pages&#41;. <BR> <BR>A lot of
    the conventions are production oriented. CAPS are generally directions to the
    film makers. The first mention of a character is in Caps, so the casting people
    can go through the script and note everybody easily. The actor can see where he
    first comes on screen also. <BR> <BR>The standard format has four indents: 1.
    Dialogue, which is set in a narrow column in the center. 2. Character&#39;s name,
    left aligned, roughly centered above the dialogue. 3. Dialogue direction, indented
    between the dialogue and character indents. 4. Editors directions &amp; &#39;continued&#39;,
    right aligned. 5. There is also left aligned and full width slug lines, in caps,
    and the narrative, in regular text.  <BR> <BR>You would naturally think that the
    production directed stuff is not important to be distinguished as such for the
    reader who is not a production person. Wrong. <BR> <BR>As a very experienced production
    person and script editor explained to me, those who read scripts all day don&#39;t
    actually notice the words. THEY SEE THE MOVIE. If something is wrong in the formatting,
    it is as if the reel &#39;breaks&#39; and the whole magic for the reader is gone.
    <BR> <BR>This same effect works for any reader in a well written script in the
    standard format. That is why you mess with it at your peril. And almost all published
    scripts follow the four indent and caps convention. Keith Tam has actually given
    you an incredibly tricky assignment. &#40;You devil you - hehe&#41; <BR> <BR>The
    main thing in the movie is what you see and what you hear: the narrative and dialogue.
    Your redesign puts the slug lines and Characters as the most noticable things
    - not good, as it distracts from &#39;seeing&#39; the movie as you read.   <BR>
    <BR>The narrow dialogue setting gives you the reader a sense of the time running
    in the movie, just as it does for a production person. Yours is too wide - near
    the length of the narrative. Also, your narrative is in the less readable italics.
    This slows you down. And the dialogue and narrative being the main thing, they
    I think should be in the same face. <BR> <BR>Don&#39;t get me wrong, your redesign
    LOOKS way better than the standard format. But it functions way worse, even for
    the non-production reader. And by the way, most readers of published screenplays
    are going to be would-be screenwriters themselves, who have been drilled to the
    point of being traumatized in the standard form. Thus their expectations are going
    to be for the standard format. <BR> <BR>In sum, I think you can change fonts from
    the standard format and improve the look that way, but not mess with indents.  <BR>
    <BR>This is actually a great assignment as it really dramatizes &#40;!&#41; the
    tension between looking great on the page and functionality for the reader. It
    also highlights how strongly reader expectations affect what will fly - although
    you probably wouldn&#39;t know that if you haven&#39;t spent time with scripts.  <BR>
    <BR>Good Luck!   '

  body: Thanks so much for your advice and comments, all. <BR> <BR>In regards to the
    narrative and the use of italics and smallcaps, I am really beginning to see that
    it might be a good idea to try another face; I agree with you Kevin that the small
    caps are awkward. Perhaps I might set the narrative text in something other than
    italics. <BR> <BR><i>I am curious as to why Mr Helpmann&#39;s name is italicized
    in the interviewer&#39;s first line.</i> <BR> <BR>This, I find curious as well.
    It is set in caps in the original screenplay &#40;if I remember correctly&#41;,
    and since I really know nothing about how screenplays are read, I didn&#39;t want
    to remove this emhasis, though I did not want to use the caps in the dialogue,
    therefore I replaced it with the italic. <BR> <BR>After today, I can safely say
    that I have learned a great deal about the functions of each element in a screenplay
    or script, thanks again all. <BR> <BR>It is quite valuable for me to have this
    feedback and I appreciate it a lot. I will be taking your advice into consideration
    as I make adjustments over the next couple of days, then I will post another version
    to see what you all think. <BR> <BR>cheers, <BR>zara

    It sounds like it might have been a suggestion to the actor. You can probably
    ditch it.

  body: 'The capitalization of &#39;Helpman&#39; was probably because it was the first
    time his name was used in the script, and the standard format requires you to
    do it in all caps. It is not for emphasis. <BR> <BR>I agree that in this case
    you could just do it in lower case in a book, as it is not for use by film makers.
    However, then you would need to be consistent and also not cap the other characters
    when introduced. You shouldn&#39;t italicize it in place of caps because then
    it is just puzzling. You see the problems in departing from the conventions -
    they are worked out in such detail.   '

  body: 'Oh, and suggestions to actors are in the dialogue directions line. Using
    a lot of dialogue direction is frowned on, but sometimes it is necessary - for
    example to indicate that the actor is being sarcastic, when this isn&#39;t obvious
    from context, or to say which other character the dialogue is being directed to
    etc. <BR> <BR>I would think that your script will have some dialogue direction
    lines, and you will have to decide on a format for them that works with the rest.  '

  body: 'Zara, in your new version you narrow the dialogue column, which I think is
    better.  <BR> <BR>But the other problems I had before still remain or are exacerbated.  <BR>
    <BR>Having the narrative now smaller than the dialogue, and still in italics,
    makes it worse. Because narrative describes the visual aspect of the movie, which
    is often more important than the dialogue, it should be just as prominant and
    readable as the dialogue. Also the ligatures seem to me inappropriate for this
    material, as they also slow down the reader.  <BR> <BR>The slug lines are still
    way too prominant relative to their importance.  <BR> <BR>Again, it looks very
    good, but I really don&#39;t think serves the material well. And serving the material
    well is to me the fundamental rule in typography. <BR> <BR>You are a talented
    designer, but for me you need to rethink this to get the heirarchy right for this
    material.   '
