  body: Most likely hand lettered. I'm not sure if I'd call it "tiki". Similar flair

  body: I would assume the designs were created by their in-house art department.
    Illustrations may have been commissioned? I just saw someone in an old CA Illustration
    annual the other day whose work looked exactly like this, but don't remember the
    name.

  body: A friend of mine was one of a small group of designers working on the summer
    campaign, and this is his style. It was done in-house, and probably all by hand.
    (Even more likely, on his personal letterpress, which he keeps in a trailer.)
