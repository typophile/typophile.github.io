  expanding a typeface to include old style numerals and small capitals. I have a
  draft of all these glyphs drawn in FontLab. How would you go about proofing these?
  I see that you can print up glyph tables in FontLab, but I'm wondering if there
  is an effective way to create specimen sheets with all these new glyphs in the context
  of the larger typeface? Ideally, I'd like to print them out. Thank you,\r\n\r\nLuke"

  body: "I assume the original font was done by somebody else? If so, first of all
    know that many font licensing agreements prohibit any sort of modification, so
    to stay squeaky-clean legal you'd have to make a totally separate font with your
    additions and use it in parallel to the original... Although to me if you keep
    it all safely internal I think it's acceptable to ignore such a no-mod clause*,
    especially to ease development. But if you let it leak out, beware...\r\n\r\n*
    There was a useful recent thread about this, but for the life of me I can't find
    it right now...\r\n\r\nSince you're sort of splicing in to somebody else's thought
    process, in terms of making the new glyphs work think not just about maintaining
    things like equal weight with the original, but also what glyphs from the original's
    set your stuff needs to work with. For example, smallcaps have to work with both
    the caps (in \"capitalized\" all-caps setting) and the lowercase (especially for
    acronyms) and they should probably also harmonize with the numerals, both from
    the original and the new ones. So make a specimen sheet that covers all these
    permutations.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: hrant, Thanks for the links to those threads. It's an important legal area
    which I could use more knowledge about. For this project, I am expanding the typeface
    only after being commissioned to do so by its owner. I am not going to be selling
    this myself or making any money off of it.
