body: "I downloaded Microtype Typographic ruler form \r\n\r\nhttp://www.microtype.com/typometer.html\r\n\r\nand
  I am trying to understand how to use it. The PDF has a note that reads.\r\n\r\n------\r\nThis
  font is Helvetica, where the measured cap height is 72% , and the x height is 52%,
  of the specified font size.Thus when you select Helvetica 20 point, the cap height
  is 14.5 points, and the x height is 10.5 points.  \r\nThis proportion can generally
  be regarded as \"standard\", and the sizes shown can be used with most fonts. \r\nFollowing
  are cap height percentages for some common fonts (these might vary according to
  font manufacturer): \r\nAmerican Typewriter 66%\r\nAntique Olive 75% \r\nAvant Garde
  75%\r\nBenguiat 66% \r\nBodoni 70%\r\nBookman 69% \r\nCentury Schoolbook 72%\r\nClearface
  69% \r\nFranklin Gothic 70%\r\nFutura 75% \r\nGaramond 62%\r\nGill Sans 67% \r\nLubalin
  Graph 72%\r\nNews Gothic 77% \r\nOptima 69%\r\nTimes 68%\r\nUnivers 70%\r\n \r\nTo
  precisely determine the size for any font, use the line spacing gauge on this ruler
  to measure the cap height, and divide it by the cap height percentage of the specific
  font.\r\n----\r\n\r\nCan a typographer help me to understand this please?\r\n\r\nthanks\r\n\r\n"

  body: "The file they sent you is a type gauge ruler of the variety that was in common
    use in the pre-computer era.  I have a drawer full of these in various sizes,
    most with the logo of some long dead type house.\r\n\r\nIf you're truly interested
    in measuring type offscreen, I would not trust something created from a file and
    output on your home printer.  A good type gauge would give you real sizes, not
    ask you to go perform math.  \r\nhttp://typographyshop.com\r\nhttp://kinggroupmedia.com"
