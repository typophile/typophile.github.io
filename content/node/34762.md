  try to retain similar angle of stress or character width when combining typefaces?\r\n\r\nShould
  contrast on all levels be key?  Does maintaining similarities in any particular
  aspect (see subject line) generally result in better combinations?"

  body: I agree with Lex, although I'd add that what tends to work is finding some
    similar aspect between the two, e.g. a calligraphic character or soft lines. But
    there should be enough contrast between the two that it doesn't get boring.
