body: "Hello fellow typophiles!\r\n\r\nWith my first post I come to present you the
  new corporate font of the Centro Portugues de Design (Portuguese Design Center).
  It`s not a Design ruling body per se, but it`s probably the most important organization
  for design in Portugal.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Untitled-1-01_4890.jpg]\r\n\r\nIn
  the attached image you can see their new sans serif corporate font, CPD Sans, designed
  by Hugo d`Alte in 2009 or 2010.\r\n\r\nThey presented this font on their Facebook
  page and I immediately recognized it and made a little comparison with FF DIN, which
  i`m sure everyone here knows.\r\n\r\nI pasted their image and wrote the same set
  of characters on top of it, using FF DIN, size 34pt. The kerning is exactly the
  same.\r\n\r\nYour opinion? Is this blatant plagiarism? Could they have had permission
  to make subtle alterations to the font and release it as their own?\r\n\r\nComing
  from such a reputable organization and with considerable resources I would have
  at least expected something new... original!\r\n\r\nCheers"

  body: "Firstly, DIN was designed long ago and was always public domain.\r\nFF DIN
    is a particular iteration of it.\r\n\r\nSo there is nothing to stop anybody else
    doing their version, even though the digital FF DIN has become so well known and
    much used.\r\n\r\nHowever, other copies must not use FF DIN's digital data as
    a starting point.\r\n\r\nSecondly, plagiarism means copying without recognition
    of the source, so if there is no mention in the collateral literature of CPD Sans
    that it is a version of DIN, then that would indeed be plagiarism.\r\n\r\nThirdly,
    because FF DIN is such a subtle and extensive iteration of DIN, if CPD sans takes
    a lot of its form from Pool's work, rather than the original of the 1930s, then
    that too could be seen as plagiarism, even if there is no \"point piracy\"."

  body: "1. CPD Sans & CPD Serif are not custom original designs for CPD (Centro Portugu\xEAs
    de Design). \r\nThese typefaces were developed as part of an identity update.
    These typefaces were developed\r\nfrom previous work as agreed with CPD (Centro
    Portugu\xEAs de Design). \r\n\r\n2. CPD Sans is based on DIN, it's in fact a development
    of an earlier (experimental) work done internally\r\nat the biggest advertising
    agency in Finland (SEK from the GREY Group), a rounded version of DIN (some\r\ntime
    before DIN rounded was published). This earlier work was never used. This was
    known in advance.\r\n\r\n3. CPD Sans was develop primarily to replace Futura typeface
    on CPD's logotype. Nothing else.\r\n\r\n4. CPD Serif is in fact CPD's  corporate
    typeface - to be used in it's stationary and internal/ external communications.
    \r\n\r\n5. CPD Serif is a customized version of a typeface designed by me and
    currently being developed\r\nfor it's commercial release (this typeface known
    as  Rolland). Also CPD Serif was chosen by CPD \r\nto be customized for their
    internal use: http://cargocollective.com/hugoalte/13224/Rolland"
