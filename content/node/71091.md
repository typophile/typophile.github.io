  somewhat tricky paper.  What worked, what didn't.

    printers' where I used to work, we had to do a job on that kind of ultra-thin
    Bible paper. Only way to get it through our standard press was one sheet at a
    time ..."

    is the best quality to use. There are other types of semi-opaque paper that you're
    looking for out there.\r\n\r\nAs the \"paper\" doesn't absorb, most ink-printing
    methods don't work too well. Laserjet is your best bet for good quality. You can't
    get too light of a paper (such as the onion paper/bible paper Theunis mentioned)
    or it may melt... in that case, as he also mentioned, a press would do the trick."

  body: "Are you just doing a few sheets for a personal project, or will a professional
    printer be doing the job?\r\n\r\nIf it's just a personal project, then some of
    the arts-and-crafts websites may have advice on hand stamping or using a desktop
    printer.\r\n\r\nIf it's being professionally printed, I suspect that many print
    shops would farm out a job like that to a speciality printer. Try to find a printer
    that has a lot of experience with that kind of stock (ask to see samples) and
    get their advice. They may not be experts at design, but they should be able to
    give good technical tips.\r\n\r\n"
