    another note:\r\n> You have so much more actually important things to complain
    about, you have no idea.\r\n\r\nMost of the \"important\" things you may be referring
    to, I have given up hope on. I have done the math. Man minus a base point for
    morality equals a big friggin' mess. As I see it our only hope is for an omniscient,
    all-powerful benevolent dictator to check in."

    is not idealistic for me)"
