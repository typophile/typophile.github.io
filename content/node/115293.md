  the heading and main text.  It seems to be the same font family throughout - and
  the R seems to have particular significance with a little rounded edge and flick
  at the bottom.  Any help would be greatly appreciated.  Thanks for your time.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/font_6440.jpg]"
