  \r\nI'm working on a logo for a delivery express company named Kangaroo.The company
  has several activities: expressdelivery, expressdistribution, directmail, floralexpress.\r\nI
  was asked for a redesign of their logo. What do u think? The type is a modified
  version of erasltc. Here are the 2 proposals and the old logo too. I prefer kangaroo.gif.\r\nThank
  you very much.\r\n"

  body: "I love where you're going with the most recent upload, but I am bothered
    by the line weight of the kangaroos silhouette. It feels too thick around the
    ears/head. I would definately stay on this track, but finesse the kangaroo a bit
    more. \r\n\r\nThe typography is very nice, but I would definately keep \"express\"
    at the bottom. And again, I see what you are working at with the dual \"oo\"s
    at the end, but they need a little more work.\r\n\r\nBut its definately in the
    right direction, no doubt. Keep at it!!!"

  body: I like the 1st of the two better. I wonder if you aught to take the bottom
    text 'express' & reverse it out in white inside a swash like the kangaroo is made
    from. The letters for express will need to be much bolder. The Kangaroo could
    be bolder too. The legibility of the letters in kangaroo is getting a bit compromised.
    I would shore that up.

  body: 'My take on the look is you really need to discuss this with the ad agency
    and the marketing department. Its a cute look but the marketing of this business
    probably needs a bigger picture view. Think of Geico, they created a cute Geko
    to act as the image of the company. This is a situation where they can either
    be major players or the little guy. '

  body: "Thank u for your comments, jlusby u're right, I should work more on the kangaroo
    and the double \"o\". I will try also to see how it looks the other version but
    the client likes more the grey one.\r\nDan, can u be more specific on geico, i
    didn't understand u very well.\r\nThank You."

  body: Of course I find new logo idea well. The old was well working too. Often you
    you must not to redesign logo global but rather improve. Example of such redesign
    is german railway by Kurt Weidemann. Comparison of old kangaroo logo could be
    also http://www.lupach.de I have created for my customer. It`s not stylish, but
    well understandable by target groups. So I would improve impact of experess and
    comprehensibility in new version.
