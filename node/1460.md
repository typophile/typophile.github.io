  body: I agree, conceptually it&#39;s what we&#39;re all about. <BR>Something lacking
    in a lot of the submissions. <BR>But, I haven&#39;t seen that ads Stephen is talking  <BR>about...
    <BR> <BR>That said, however, there&#39;s something great about  <BR>those fists.

    If I can&#39;t find proof <BR>than it is as legit a submission as any. And I <BR>can&#39;t.
