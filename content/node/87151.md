  body: "Well, thanks anyway. I searched some more and found this one: \r\n\r\nhttp://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/0321685369/ref=s9_simh_gw_p14_d1_g14_i1?pf_rd_m=A3P5ROKL5A1OLE&pf_rd_s=center-2&pf_rd_r=1WZTVQFEJCEGF8WTDTPT&pf_rd_t=101&pf_rd_p=467128533&pf_rd_i=468294\r\n\r\nAt
    least it seems to get as close as possible, to what I was looking for. Any objections?"

  body: I bought the CS2 version (some years ago), and found it useful. The new edition
    could be the best book for your purpose.

  body: I've got this one for Christmas. It's well written, clear, pragmatic, but
    too general (and also too short) in my opinion. Not really the typographic InDesign
    companion you're looking for, but the mix Bringhurst + N. French might be enough.
