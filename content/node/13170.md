body: "Sorry for the vanity of making such a post, but I figured that some of you
  might like an update.\r\n\r\nIn real life, things are incredibly chaotic. Meetings
  and other similar sessions as part of my divorce are burning up an enormous amount
  of time (and money too, naturally). By next Friday, I will have had eight separate
  meetings over a period of nine days. So if you're feeling miffed that you've sent
  me email and I haven't responded, rest assured it's nothing personal.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile,
  my curve editor project is coming along very nicely. After having redone the math
  from the ground up, I now have a fairly polished C implementation that's plenty
  fast enough for interactive use; it's even more responsive, in fact, than my previous
  Cornu-based version. I need to be a bit discreet about details so as not to screw
  up patent rights, but people with access to Linux / X11 running on MacOS and who
  are really curious about the new stuff may find it rewarding to contact me. In any
  case, I hope to be able to make a wider release in a couple months or so when life
  settles down, and, with luck, a patent is filed.\r\n\r\nEven the concept of \"spare
  time\" is alien to me right now, I have found drawing some letters to be very peaceful,
  relaxing, and sustaining. I now have twenty-four of the 60-pt metal Centaur lowercase
  letters drawn, in addition to half a dozen from the Imprimerie Nationale's Christian
  Gothic and a handful of others. I find that the new curve editor lets me get to
  <i>vastly</i> better results in a fraction of the time as a Bezier-based tool.\r\n\r\nIn
  all, I kinda feel like I'm in a cocoon right now, preparing to come out in a little
  while. Greetings from inside!\r\n"

  body: "Raph, thanks for the update. This is then a good time for me to express my
    gratitude for your recent bursting onto the type scene. Your particular multi-disciplinary
    angle is most valuable to the field. Good luck managing your time, although it
    seems you have as best a handle on it as possible. And I can't wait to try out
    your outline editing software; will you have a native-Windows version too?\r\n\r\n>
