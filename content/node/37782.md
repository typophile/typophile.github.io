    NAMED BOREALIS\r\n\"What's the font in the festivalmagazine and on your posters
    called? I've never seen it before\". The question we've had to answer several
    times the last weeks and the answer is rather simple: The font is called \"Borealis\"
    and is designed for the festival by the eminent designers in the local designcollective
    Grandpeople. More about Grandpeople at http://www.grandpeople.org."
