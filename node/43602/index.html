  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>I&rsquo;m posting a new thread to prevent further disruption of the <a href="http://www.typophile.com/node/43312">thread on embeddable web fonts.</a> My posts on that one were disruptive and harsh, and I apologize to Typophile&rsquo;s members and moderators for that.</p>
<p>My sincere apologies to Sii for subjecting him to prolonged scrutiny. I can see now that I overreacted. Let&rsquo;s forgive each other and put it all behind us.</p>
<p>I will be taking a break from Typophile over the next four months. I&rsquo;ve got so much work on my hands I can&rsquo;t spare the time, and it pays to be pragmatic when grappling with the slippery dynamics of online fora. Life can be very strange at times. I&rsquo;ve had eight of my teeth extracted in the past six weeks. That&rsquo;s six weeks of swollen gums and throbbing pain as the gums heal. I&rsquo;ll have dentures fitted around about May. A musician friend of mine is dying from cancer right now and it&rsquo;s making me miserable. Life can be very strange.</p>
<p>Before I depart, I want to thank the following people:</p>
<ul>
<li>Tiffany for her good grace, marvellous judgement and big heart</li>
<li>Eben for his practical outlook and solid moderating skills</li>
<li>Stewf for his coolness and ongoing support of my type career</li>
<li>Dan Reynolds for his very existence&mdash;you&rsquo;re a beautiful person Dan and I like you</li>
<li>Nick Shinn, John Hudson, William and Hrant for their immense knowledge and experience</li>
<li>Ricardo and Chris Lozos for their generosity and wonderful humour</li>
<li>Linda and Patty for their great artistry and professionalism</li>
<li>James Puckett for his dynamism and obvious potential</li>
<li>Ben Mitchell and Jelmar for being great sponges and teaching me how better to teach type design</li>
<li>Darrel, Haley, Zara, Yves, Russell, Tim Daley, Paul Hunt, Sharon, Richard Kegler, Joshua and every other regular here&mdash;you&rsquo;re all wonderful people whose hearts are in the right place</li>
<li>Everybody else I&rsquo;ve conversed with, whether we&rsquo;ve agreed or disagreed, that&rsquo;s not the point. The point is it&rsquo;s all good. You are all good people who expand my mind and strengthen my heart</li>
<li>Most of all to Joe for making it all possible.</li>
</ul>
<p>I&rsquo;ll leave you with the words to the chorus from the Stone Temple Pilots song Still Remains, written by Scott Weiland. It&rsquo;s very significant for me right now because I don&rsquo;t know how long the repaired arteries inside my head are going to last. I&rsquo;m experiencing head pains every time I cough lately. That&rsquo;s a bad sign, and if one of &lsquo;em bursts I&rsquo;ll probably die. I&rsquo;m not kidding, nor am I making it up to get sympathy. Life can be very strange.</p>
<br>
<em>Pick a song and sing a yellow nectarine
Take a bath I'll drink the water that you leave
If you should die before me ask if you can bring a friend
Pick a flower hold your breath and drift away</em>
<br>
<p>While I&rsquo;m away, please keep in mind one thing: It&rsquo;s the spirit of the rules that counts, not the letter.</p>

A bit of advice, try to avoid coughing :-)&ndash;I can recommend Thayers Slippery Elm Lozenges, &ldquo;Nature&rsquo;s Gentle Lubricant &mdash; Prized by Opera Singers&rdquo;, if it&rsquo;s available in your neck of the woods, or similar. Not sure exactly how it works or if it would be appropriate for you, but if it&rsquo;s better to deal with congestion by swallowing rather than coughing, something like that may help.</div>

<p>Sure there is a need to pound Joe. He seemed to be claiming to speak for the entire Typophile community in insulting James as to what &ldquo;we&rdquo; &ldquo;don&rsquo;t need or want.&rdquo;</p>
<p>James A has irked me on a couple of occasions, but here he is making a public apology for something, and sharing some personal information. I appreciate both of those choices, and I see them as reflecting humility and humanity rather than egotism. I certainly don&rsquo;t appreciate somebody else seeming to think they can speak for the entire Typophile community in putting James down for doing this.</p>
<p>But then again, maybe this just means I&rsquo;m part of the cabal?  :)   (Just teasing, really.)</p>

<p>I know I can&rsquo;t prevent you or anyone from giving Joe what for except to make some points which either will or won&rsquo;t make sense to you.</p>
<p>Some of this might sound like my trying to &ldquo;<a href="http://www.phrases.org.uk/meanings/118200.html ">teach your grandma to suck eggs&rdquo;</a>. But isn&rsquo;t meant as condescension. Instead I am trying to see if I can (re)establish common/shared ideas about this.</p>
<p>a) It&rsquo;s James' thread not Joe&rsquo;s and the more you ( or anyone ) pounds away at Joe the more it becomes about Joe albeit in a negative way.  To me this seems unfortunate. This was in part the reason I asked James to make his own thread - this thread.</p>
<p>b) A very related point is that information which is too random/mixed becomes less valuable to the users of Typophile. Granted this isn&rsquo;t a Type heavy thread, (it&rsquo;s personal) but the point is applicable to Typophile threads in general.</p>
<p>This why the guidelines say <cite> Don’t hijack other threads:
Don’t post irrelevant queries within another thread; create a new thread. You can post a new topic by scrolling to the bottom of one of the main forum pages and clicking on the “Post a new topic” link. </cite></p>
<p>b) James himself* is an advocate of avoiding extending conflicts bad feelings on Typophile or elsewhere. One way of extending these bad feelings is to reply to negativity with ire even if you are fully justified.</p>
<p>d) That Typophile is a bit too full of &ldquo;pounding&rdquo; is in part why James is taking a break.</p>
<p>Typophile will be the kind of place we make collectively it.</p>
<p>Agree or disagree but please make a new thread about it if you want to reply to me. It&rsquo;s valid to link to that new thread here.</p>
<p>*He can correct me if I am putting false words in his mouth when he gets back, but I I think I am very probably on safe ground here.</p>

<p>Actually, Joe <em>is</em> a decent, caring and highly committed guy and I like &amp; respect him.

Obviously I missed the mark.</p>
<p>I also like and respect James. I didn&rsquo;t mean for my contributions to this thread to take anything away from what he has to say, I had hoped to sort of disarm Joe&rsquo;s negative remarks a little bit with my first post here.</p>

<p>This isn&rsquo;t really a discussion thread. It&rsquo;s a goodbye for the time being thread. The best thing to do now is stop posting on it. That&rsquo;s all well-wishing we need for the time being.</p>
<p>Eben: <em>*He can correct me if I am putting false words in his mouth when he gets back, but I I think I am very probably on safe ground here.</em></p>
<p>Very safe ground Eben. Everyone on this thread owes it to themselves to listen to what Eben is saying and take it on-board. I mean it. Let Joe&rsquo;s comments stand and stop making personal remarks about him. I was uncivil and made many personal remarks about people here the other day in an attempt to draw attention to incivility and the problems that hubris creates. That was the wrong way to go about it. You may not agree with Joe but berating him for his remarks is just more incivility and does nothing to create an environment of trust and good faith.</p>
<p>An uncivil environment is a poor environment to discuss typography in. Yes, we all believe our view is the definitive one, but we must be as broad-minded and tolerant as possible to stay civil.</p>
