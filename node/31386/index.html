Thanks for reply. What do you mean with "too noisy"?
Too strong? Not calm enough?

<div class=commentbody>I second Muzzer's wise opinion.
Also, if you want to use a German word instead of the common English one, for instance Welnetz in lieu of Internet, why don't you use a German word for radio, too? (Weltnetz Hörfunk???)</div>

In understand what you mean.
I wanted the same kind of border around the flagg and the buttons.
But may be its better to use the thinner ones for both. We'll try.
Thank you.
@ Dan
You are right. I'll change it.
The anglo-american culture-imperialistic influence of the last 62 years to the post-war generations in Germany was a very heavy one.
I did not see it before, thanks.

<div class=commentbody>…on the other hand, the anglo-american culture-imperialistic influence is so strong that you forgot that radio was not an <em>urdeutsches</em> word! The word "Internet" is used so often in German today that I am sure that your grandchildren will think it a completely normal German term in 62 years, too ;-)</div>

<div class=commentbody>Of course I know that.
In Germany we have the word "Maschinenstürmer".
Its out of a book "Die Weber", from Gerhard Hauptmann anywhere in the beginning of the 20th century.
After starting of Industrialization in Gemany (and other countries, like England, too, of course) lots of cloth was produced in small private homes. These webers went on strike, because the could not feed their families anymore. And they burned their looms (Hurray to Babelfish). "Maschinenstürmer" stands for people who are living in the past and who don't see that times are changing. I am not a "Maschinenstürmer", but I want to hold and protect my language for my german people. (In deep respect to other languages).
"Undeutsch" was "NS-Sprech" (Terminology of Nationalsozialismus). That's not my way of thinking (and you know that of course).
To use german words for english ones in german language - if there are perfect words for it - is very senseful. I read that in Finland 95 percent of IT and computer terms are translated into finish - without any problem. The finish international specialists use both - english and finish - but for national requests they use finish terms only. Nobody thinks (as I know) that Finland is too nationalistic.
I'ld love to translate my complete website into english. But the problem is: My own english is too poor. And the translators I know are not familiar with all the terms out of typography and letterpress.

An almost exact English equivalent would be a <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luddite>Luddite</a>.
You could try keeping just the heavier bar at the top of the link buttons rather than framing the whole thing. My German is not good enough to translate but hopefully there are enough native German speakers on Typophile who could help with the more technical terms.

<div class=commentbody>I just dislike the idea that something like the word "Internet" has to be translated :(
It isn't like, before the introduction of the word "Internet" into German, there was a German word for the Internet. The Internet is a new concept. It was given a proper name (with a capital letter! By English speakers! What a concept!). Is it neccessary to translate that when both the sounds "inter" and "net" were already common in German-language anyway? <em>(Z.B. Interaktivität oder vielleicht auch Networking?)</em>
On the other hand, sometime German (marketers?) create new "German" words that are supposed to sound like English ones, but which are completely unintelligible in English. The best (or worst) example of this may be "Handy", i.e., the German word for a mobile phone. A mobile phone may be a very handy thing to have, but no English-speaking country called that sort of telephone that name. This causes many young Germans minor troubles when they go abroad… they think that are communicating in a common language, when they are not necessarially doing this ;-)</div>

<div class=commentbody>This reminds me of something that occurs in the other direction. In anglophone culture, if people hear someone sneeze, they say <em>Gesundheit!</em> without having any idea what the word actually means. </div>

That's true? :-)
I did not know that..
Of course I know that times are changing.
And I for myself prefer international contacts.
I think most of the germans do. An american collegue
from Kodak said to me, I'ld be the most outgoing geman,
he ever met. Its 20 years ago but 'til today I do not
know if he wants to joke me or not.
I'ld love to read books from Truman Capote, John Irving,
Normal Mailer in your american language. But my knowledges
are too poor. But it was enough for Jack Kerouac, when I
was young. My stays in US, working for Atex, a Kodak company
in Germany, was extremly interesting. Not only the job, but
although (or more) the personal contacts to the people in
New England and NYC, too (yes). Everyone was very friendly
to me (mostly travelling alone for months) when they mentioned,
I am German. No, they asked "Are you from Germany, 'cause they
heard it). And they all or most of them where patriotic americans.
That's alright for me, 'cause I am a patriotic German with my
own wonderful language and books from Arno Schmidt, Heinrich Böll,
Joachim Fest and others.
Using a foreign language sets borders.
Very often its not possible to define exactly what is meant.
Only in my native language I know all facilities.

<div class=commentbody>All first corrections are done now.
No noisy borders anymore.
"Hörfunk" instead of Radio.
Now its time to write new textfiles.
Thank you all for your support.
And if some of you american guys visit Germany, I'ld be happy to welcome you at Preußisches Bleisatz-Magazin in Ratingen, close to Dusseldorf in the very west of Germany.
