  logo below (I know it is not a good logo, as I have been told, but I am stuck with
  it). I wanted the letters to be white with a blue background (or better yet, a transparent
  background).\r\n\r\nIf any of you experts could help as to exactly what this font
  is, I would be much obliged. \r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/logo_6408.JPG]"

  body: It's not a complex set of letter forms. Your time would likely be better spent
    redrawing it rather than hunting for the font.

    function (Image>adjustments)\r\nThat e is truly horrifying."

  body: That rotated 'e' is not a true font design. It was possibly rotated and had
    it lower part cut off by the logo designer. The logo mixes uppercase and lowercase
    characters, and possibly normal and condensed styles. Looks like Avant Garde,
    with the 'r' possibly from many of the Geometrical fonts made during the 90's,
    most of them found freely over the web.

    helpful.\r\n\r\nTo the rest of you, I really appreciate the help. How would I
    get in contact with you about doing some things with this logo?"
