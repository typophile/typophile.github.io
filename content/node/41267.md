  body: 'Dude, the etiquette is to give the original thread a bump rather than to
    create a new thread with the same ID. Besides, there were several suggestions
    offered as to what it could be (bottom line: Arial; top line could be Franklin
    Gothic condensed or Adobe Substitution font). If nobody else contributed it''s
    because either we don''t know for sure or that the font doesn''t spark our interest
    (that was my rationale anyway).'
