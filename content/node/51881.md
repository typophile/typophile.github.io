  have been using InDesign (ID) for <24h.\r\n\r\nFrom my experience in the old days,
  I understand that when creating a typeface in a piece of software like Fontographer,
  you could pre-determine kerning pairs.\r\n\r\nIn ID, when I look at the kerning
  options, there are three choices:\r\n\r\n1. Optical\r\n2. Metrics\r\n3. None\r\n\r\nI
  understand that optical takes advantage of an algorythm in ID which attempts to
  counterbalance the negative space between glyphs based upon the typeface itself.
  Serif's and all.\r\n\r\nIt is very important that I recreate materials using the
  type designers original kerning pairs, not ID's interpretation of what it considers
  \"good\" kerning to be, and not all kerning pair set to zero.\r\n\r\nRepeat, I need
  the text to be set using the original type designers kerning pairs.\r\n\r\nDo I
  do this by using \"metrics\" or \"none?\"\r\n\r\nAdobe technical support was unable
  to answer this question.\r\n\r\nThank you."

    am stunned. [[http://livedocs.adobe.com/en_US/InDesign/5.0/help.html?content=WSa285fff53dea4f8617383751001ea8cb3f-6e0a.html|The
    online help]] explains it quite obviously, and under the help item \"Kerning and
    tracking\" as well!\r\n\r\nIn short, <strong>Optical</strong> uses ID's build
    in system, and -- reportedly -- works best with large type. It kinda gets slow
    for running text, but according to people in the know, it adds too much space.\r\n\r\n<strong>None</strong>
    puts no extra space inbetween characters (or takes it out), so, essentially, all
    that's left is the space that's in the letter boxes itself. Kind of what you're
    seeing in your browser.\r\n\r\n<strong>Metrics</strong> \"uses kern pairs, which
    are included with most fonts\" (yeah, that's what the help sez!), and this is
    what you obviously want: just what the designer decided, no more no less.\r\n\r\nFor
    Quark there was this plugin (oh yeah, sorry: 'XTension') that allowed you to create
    custom kern tables for fonts, but sadly, ID lacks this and nobody who can write
    plugins cares enough to write one."

    questions here if i get stuck while this old dog learns a new trick?
