  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">hi; i was wondering what you guys think of this logotype i created for a friend of mine who is starting up a network for artists (who are active in social change). i thought <i>Impact</i> designed by Geoffrey Lee would be appropriate for its strong statement and connotations of you know, solidarity and activism. btw my name is andrea, i work as a designer (with LOTS to learn still and i'm mostly self-taught, with a background in writing) but sometimes my favourite projects are the ones i do for my friends. i'm new in these forums but i'd like to say hi and that i'm completely amazed by you people and all you know; it's nice to have mentors even if it's on the internet: ) btw i notice the male pronoun is often defaulted to in here, and i wondered if anyone else noticed that or has comments. <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/4680.gif" alt="ana logotype"></div>

		<div class="commentbody">the logo is specifically for business cards right now; the budget is small so i'm going to try to find a b&amp;w and red photocopier to reproduce them on; the back of the card reads &quot;Creating a space for artists engaged in social change&quot; (+ contact info). thanks!! <BR> <BR>-a</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I think Impact has good weight, but it's too commonly used, so it makes it harder to be memorable. <BR> <BR>Maybe this is one place a unicase font (like Emigre likes to make) would be good? <BR> <BR>&gt; the male pronoun is often defaulted to in here <BR> <BR>Common practice, pretty much everywhere.  :-( <BR>Although some languages don't have such an issue. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR></div>

		<div class="commentbody">I agree with the other comments here. <BR> <BR>Not to be a spaz, but I wonder if there's some &quot;networking&quot; visual stuff you could do with the horizontal and vertical strokes of the characters. You know, like make them weave together or something. <BR> <BR>Oh yeah, I alkso agree about Impact. Most usages make me violently ill, but strangely, yours did not. Still, it's best to avoid typefaces that are on every computer in the world. <BR> <BR>One other idea I had was, I wonder if something more grungy would be in order? More protesty? Like the logo was created with a spraypaint stencil or something. <BR> <BR>Good luck&hellip;</div>
