  body: No <em>The New York Times</em> here unfortunately. We'll have to wait for
    the East Coasters to jump into action.

    body: No, in the ad some kind of kinky Baroque Old-Style serif is used (remindful
      of Mrs. Eaves, somehow; I know the latter is neither an Old Style nor Baroque...).
      I am very intrigued.
