    recent revival of interest in Arabic fonts will be extended to other complex and
    minority script languages in the future -  maybe this one will see the light of
    day as an OpenType font eventually? But the work would likley be considerable
    and expensive, and with the Indian governments push to provide free fonts, I wonder
    if anyone can earn a living as a type designer in India any more?  "

  body: "> it is neither digital nor for sale.\r\n\r\nThe reason for it might be simple:
    the important thing about Frutiger's\r\nDevanagari is that it wasn't good. The
    client didn't even like it - a rare\r\ncase where the client had some sense. India
    is not Switzerland.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    a good typeface, its important to feel that language. \r\n"

    ;-) but is it bad because of the technology that it was designed for, or is it
    bad because it's too westernized (I've seen one letter shape described as being
    too 3ish), or is it bad for another reason? \r\n\r\n"

    were too much distorted from the original proportion of the letters. \r\nBut yeah
    It's not at all that bad, that it can't be released:)\r\nbtw, personally I like
    this the typeface."

    you're paying attention.\r\nYes, it's too Latinized and -Saad will complain- this
    tends to also mean too Modernized (by which I mean \"Modernismed\"). Simplification's
    role as a goal instead of merely a means came out of the woodwork, causing explicit,
    finger-pointable rejection. I guess we're <cite>lucky</cite> it wasn't subtle!\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
