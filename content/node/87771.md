  is not a priority matter on my schedule but I did a first try. I wonder if it may
  bear some 'softened' details like this:\r\n.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/A-sans_4492.png]\r\n\r\nthoughts?"

  body: I hope this doesn't sound harsh, but to me at first it seems the sans cut
    hasn't quite found its voice yet, taking its proportions and ductus from the serif
    face. (Though from a small sample it's hard to see how it would work in paragraphs.)
    That said, I do like the stress and styling; the /c/ in particular is really interesting.

  body: "@ Karl, you give a counting of my modest creations of the past few years
    \u2026 What you state about Andron humiliates me a little bit, since there are
    many excellent faces out there. However, I appreciate you like it!\r\n\r\nBut
    now to the Sans try-out.\r\n@ Bendy: no harshness at all, what shall a very first
    take be for? Maybe you\u2019re right.\r\n.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/A-sans2_6011.png]\r\n.\r\nIt
    ought to harmonize well, this is supposed to be the goal. But, could it be that
    it harmonizes too much? Yeah this has been worked upon by many others already,
    I know \u2026"

  body: "Softened sans faces are not a good proposition for a foundry to produce,
    mainly because typographers assess them at display size, and get the impression
    that they are quaint, which severely restricts their usage.\r\n\r\nThe sans and
    serif members of a super-family should be able to stand on their own, because
    the majority of their sales will not be in the complete package containing both."

  body: Andreas, well when combining a sans and a serif, my personal taste is to have
    quite a big contrast in tone, shape or feel. I'd want to use the two for different
    purposes, so they need to be immediately distinct. Other people of course use
    things differently.

    new Andron-Sans seems to have all of the sensibility, & sensuality, of Andron-Serif.\r\nYet,
    beside the deep beautify of its classical Venetian ductus, the great glory of
    Andron is its wide literacy.\r\n\r\nShall an Andron-Sans also have Latin, Greek

    this was the initial idea to try out if this is possibly to be achieved. Yes,
    the first sample (it\u2019s no more than that) looks quite nice.\r\nBut, as others
    have commented here, wether this fashion is advisable to go for an actual companion

    not yet see the light of a release. Latin, Greek, Irish and Coptic middlecase
    char. sets are in stock.\r\n\r\nAnd yes, one could also do \u201CAndron Sans Coptic
    Medior\u201D or Andron Latin Medior Italic. By the way, uncial small capitals
    would be also a variety I\u2019d like to explore. (wait \u2013 did I already??)\r\n\r\nYesterday
    I shortly thought about a possible didone Fraktur-Uncial.\r\nBut this has nothing
    to do with Andron."

    it\u2019s very nice that you want to see more of it. It would be a worthwile exploration,
    surely. I\u2019d love it myself to see some Old Norse manuscript text reproduced
    faithfully down to the character in such a typeface. But are you aware what an
    awful amount of work this is.\r\nAs I noted initially, this project is not really
