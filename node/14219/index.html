<div class="post-content e-content" itemprop=articleBody>Here's an ambigram I sketched while at TypeCon last weekend. I talked with my professor (John Langdon) about it and deemed it a good start but not a perfect finish. I learned a lot from the progression of it from my original sketch (there were about 3 revisions). Time to move on and do more sketching. I did come up with what John considers quite an excellent alternate for an a/r combo that he had never seen before (doesn't fit this style though) and I attached that as well, it'll surely go into my library for future use! Comments? critiques at this point aren't so important, just thought I'd share some of my type work with everyone!

<div class=commentbody>David,
the DARA ambigram is completely readable and interesting in that the "A" treatments are very different from each other yet they are separated by only one character.

<div class=commentbody>Norber: Thanks for the comment, I was waiting to see what some of you thought on the general letter forms and such. I do a lot of sketching of typefaces and I think it's started to help me form my own letters that are readable and still solve the problem!</div>

<div class=commentbody>I think your AR combination might work better if you closed the counter in the middle and put a curve on the inside of the vertical stroke where it joins the horizontal (I hope this makes sense, it is very hard to describe parts of letters that can be viewed from 180 degrees).

Interesting idea, if I ever come across this combination again I'll remember your suggestion. Which direction are you saying the curve should go on the vertical stroke?

My inspiration comes entirely from John's work, he's nothing less than inspirational. John is perhaps one of the most knowledgeable people about letterforms and type that I know in person and to be deemed the 'Ambigram Master' by so many, who could ask for a better teacher!? He's been my motivation for what now is becoming a love for type and he enjoys the fact that I'm really getting into it. I get to help out with some of his work like mentioned before which is also exciting!
I've linked my very first 3 ambigrams I did for John's class open ended final if anyone's interested. He enjoyed them very much for their different styles and solutions:

<div class=commentbody>John is truly amazing. I can't and wouldn't disagree with that. Having run into his book years ago and also trying to inspire my own students I know how difficult it is and how loose you mind must be to see in that way. I really that first one a lot, Dave.</div>

He's set to release a second version this fall! Don't forget to go pick up a copy! I know I'm going to be getting one and making him sign it no doubt.
<em>I really that first one a lot, Dave</em>
Thanks!! I love that one too, it's so simple but I love the style I chose and the actual letterforms.</div>

<div class=commentbody>If I refer to the A, the curve I suggested would be in the same direction as the outside curve from the vertical to the horizontal in the top right, you will have to balance the curve so it works with the other curve inside that counter. The reason I made the suggestion is that it looked a bit abrupt having a right angle. Of course you might decide that it will affect the readability of the R shape too much.
