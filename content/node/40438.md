  far i have only designed lowercase, feedback is greatly appreciated as I need constructive
  criticism, as I'm sure a lot is wrong with it, also i was wondering what are the
  best ways and programs to use I just used illustrator using guides and the grid
  i was wondering if theres a better way go about creating a font and getting things
  like contrast accurate other than using guides and grids.\r\n\r\nthanks\r\n\r\nJohn.\r\n\r\n

    many types of serif would you like to put in one face ?\r\nSkill in the digital
    age is confused with mastery of digital tools, masking the importance of understanding
    materials and mastering the elements of form.\r\n"

  body: "The profusion of seemingly incompatible serif approaches is a bit distracting,
    yes. And what's with the weird angle of stress on the \"o\" - it seems like it's
    from a different typeface, as the same angle of stress isn't present in any other
    letter.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\n\r\nT"

  body: "Hi\r\n\r\ntotally agreee with tomas here, as you know typography comes from
    the pen, ductus is very important. An exercise that might help you to understand
    a little more about typography is to try and trace the letterforms of your type
    with a pen. Is very hard too! hehe\r\n\r\nAnyways i'll give my humble opinnion:\r\n\r\n-
    For the regular version it seems too bold\r\n- The eye of the \"g\" is a little
    small and the beggining of the tail is too bold\r\n- The \"i\" and \"j\" accents
    are small. They should be a little more wide than the stem\r\n- The \"s\" needs
    more work (is a tough one)\r\n- Intresting \"t\"\r\n- x needs optical adjusment,
    it seems to \"fall\" to the right \r\n- You managed to make a sistem with constants
    and variables, thats tough for first timers! :)\r\n\r\nHope to have helped a little!\r\n\r\nFerch\r\n\r\nPS:
    Is coming relly good, my first proyects where horrible compared to yours :)\r\n\r\n[[http://www.tipografia-montevideo.info/|Tipograf\xEDa-Montevideo]]"

  body: "Neither the r nor the c have serifs on a curve which is highly similar to
    what you use on the s, which does have a serif.\r\n\r\nThe serif on the k is to
    long, almost making a triangle."

  body: Well, that inconsistency in particular is present in a large number--maybe
    the majority--of serif fonts. However, this font does have some other issues.
    My first-slash advice is to make all the hairlines the same width, and all the
    broad strokes the same width. That will make it look more professional, and make
    it easier to address the smaller issues.
