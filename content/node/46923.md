  body: "Can you be a bit more specific than 'using for web'?\r\n\r\nHTML text can
    be styled via CSS declaring any typeface you want. The catch is that for it to
    render in said font, the end-user has to have it installed on their machine. This
    limits you to the standard Windows, OSX, Linux, and MS Office fonts for the most
    part.\r\n\r\nHeadlines and such can be set as images, using any font you want
    to create them.\r\n\r\nsIFR is a flash technique to embed fonts into a flash file
    to render text on screen. It's used on this site for the thread titles. It's typically
    used mainly for headlines.\r\n\r\nAnd then there is web font embedding, which
    some browsers now support, though there are contentious issues in regards to which
    FONTS support it in terms of the EULA.\r\n\r\nBeyond that, be true to the brand,
    and be cognizant of readability and accessibility issues."

  body: "Well,\r\n\r\nI am designing the strap line typography of a banner ad for
    a wine label design  studio. \r\nThe studio I'm designing this banner for does
    normally uses Adobe Jenson Pro in printed work. But, I have been told that  there
    are fonts specifically designed  to be used on the web.\r\n\r\nI was thinking
    to use ScalaSans "

  body: "Speaking of 'strap line'...how old is that term? In all my years, I hadn't
    heard of that term until the past year or so. Is it particularly Brittish?\r\n\r\nBack
    on-topic...\r\n\r\nThere are fonts optimized specifically for the screen...most
    of the Microsoft Office Type fits that (Verdana, Georgia, Tahoma, and the newer
    ones in '07 like Calibri)\r\n\r\nHowever, the benefit is really only noticeable
    at text sizes and when rendered natively by the browser/OS.\r\n\r\nIf you want
    to use ScalaSans, that's going to have to be an image anyways, so go for it."

    you go with graphics, just be sure to stick with headline and decorative use.
    Avoid setting your actual body copy as an image."
