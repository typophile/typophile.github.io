body: "In another thread someone asked about an \"overflow\" problem when compiling
  OpenType kern feature in Fontlab. I am having the same problem, except with the
  dlig feature. The solution that was suggested for the kern feature overflow was
  using subtables. I tried that with my dlig feature, but it looks like subtables
  are not allowed with this feature. \r\n\r\nMy dlig feature is quite simple. It's
  just about 120 lines of things like \"sub @lc_d @lc_a @lc_b by dab.alt;\" nothing
  at all more complicated than this. I'm at a loss as to why it would could cause
  an \"offset overflow\". I thought overflow errors were caused by tables that exceeded
  64k in size. My dlig feature is nowhere near that size. In fact, my liga feature
  is about the same size as my dlig feature, but it doesn't cause an overflow.\r\n\r\nIf
  anyone can shed some light on this, or tell me of a workaround, I would very much
  appreciate it.\r\n\r\nAle"

  body: These are classes of variations on each individual letters. For example @lc_a
    is a class that is the equivalent of [a a.alt a.swash a.alt2]. None of these classes
    contain more than 6 glyphs. I even tried doing it without the classes, i.e. using
    "sub [a a.alt a.swash a.alt2] [a a.alt a.swash a.alt2] [a a.alt a.swash a.alt2]
    by aaa.alt;" It still caused the same overflow.

  body: "it seems to me that this kind of encoding can easily result in a large #
    of replacement lookups. I'm sure I don't understand OT compilation as well as
    Adam does, but for your given example if you have 4 letter variations in each
    of your classes and 120 lines you would end up with 7680 lookups, and easily many
    more if some of your classes have five or more alernates or your ligature strings
    are more than 3 characters long. (Adam, please correct me if my thinking on this
    is wrong!)\r\n\r\nAn easy way to get around this problem is to put your dlig feature
    <em>before</em> your other features (salt, swsh, calt, etc.) But maybe you're
    trying to achieve some other effect. Maybe you could explain a bit more in detail
    what you're trying to achieve?\r\n"

  body: "Not lookups but substitutions -- but indeed, that's the case. And your advice
    makes much sense, Paul. If you move dlig before calt, you may get away with just
    putting the basic variants into dlig (sub a a a by a_a_a.alt) instead of all the
    variants (sub [a a.alt a.swash a.alt2] [a a.alt a.swash a.alt2] [a a.alt a.swash
    a.alt2] by a_a_a.alt), and yet, largely, you'll achieve the same functional effect
    (except that dlig will not work for variants that were manually inserted into
    the text string using the Glyph Palette, but it will still properly interact with
    calt). \r\n\r\nAdam\r\n"

    it helps the overflow problem). Plus, dlig will still work for variants that are
    manually inserted using the glyph palette, because what gets stuck in the text
    is the base character plus the needed formatting.\r\n\r\nT"

  body: "Tom, \r\n\r\nyou are right. Adobe Illustrator and InDesign are smart: when
    I insert a glyph using the Glyph palette, they try to guess the \"best\" possible
    way to access that glyph, and store that information. If a glyph has a non-private
    Unicode codepoint assigned, InDesign (and Illustrator) inserts that codepoint.
    If a glyph is accessible through a particular OpenType layout feature that InDesign
    can work with, InDesign inserts the Unicode codepoint of the basic glyph plus
    a feature code. When I insert a small-cap a, InDesign will store it as \"a with
    smcp applied\". This is nice because if I switch the font, that formatting will
    retained if the new font also supports small caps. \r\n\r\nIf the glyph is available
    through several different OpenType Layout features, InDesign makes a \"best guess\".
    And only if the glyph is not accessible through an OpenType Layout feature and
    does not have a Unicode codepoint associated, the glyph id is stored, as a sort
    of \"last resort\". \r\n\r\nThe Mac OS X Character Palette works differently.
    If I switch it to the glyph mode and use it to insert a glyph to, say, TextEdit,
    the glyph id will be always used. \r\n\r\nAdam\r\n"

  body: "Thomas, \r\n\r\non an unrelated note: as we all know, Photoshop CS/CS2 doesn't
    have the Glyph palette. I tried to use the Mac OS X Character Palette with it
    and it only works for \"characters\", i.e. glyphs that have a Unicode codepoint
    assigned (even if that's just PUA). Even though the Apple Character Palette has
    a \"glyph\" mode, unencoded glyphs don't make it into Photoshop, or InDesign or
    Illustrator. I realize this has to do with the text infrastructure, and that Adobe
    apps don't use the Cocoa text handling (AAT/ATSUI). However, I wonder if this
    could be looked into for all future CS apps on the Mac. Even though Illustrator
    and InDesign have their own Glyph palettes, I think a seamless integration with
    the system Character palette would be desirable. The Mac OS X Character palette
    is actually a pretty potent tool. \r\n\r\nOf course, I have submitted a request
    on this at http://www.adobe.com/support/feature.html\r\n\r\nAdam\r\n"
