  mind a squarish geometric with serifs that would work at text sizes.\r\n\r\nI know
  it would be helpful to have some more glyphs to show, but my concentration is consumed
  for today and I am curious about whether you think this has some direction or no
  direction at all.\r\n\r\nThank you for your time!\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/neohopperndorf_5964.gif]"

    is reminiscent from the rotation \"p\". Maybe a more curved join would look better
    there.\r\n\r\nto wormwood: I will try hard not to analyze Kontrapunkt for fear
    I would limit my ideas.\r\n\r\nThank you for commenting! I will make a complete
    set of characters really soon."

  body: "I quite like this.\r\n\r\nHere are some comments, take them with a grain
    of salt:\r\n- /t/ is top-heavy.\r\n- The ear on /r/ should be a tad heavier.\r\n-
    The transition/arch on the letters /m/n/h/u/ should be slightly darker. Also the
    top-right on /a/ and /p/.\r\n- /x/ is probably too wide at the bottom.\r\n- /k/
    seems a bit odd with the upper diagonal thicker than the bottom.\r\n\r\nIn any
    case, the joins on your letters are lovely. I especially like your serifs - my
    attempt at similar ones didn't work too well. Also, as far as the /t/ goes, the
    lowercase t is the worst letter to design in my opinion. Normally you form it
    using the left part of the /u/, and figure the crossbar weight from the eye of
    the /e/.\r\n\r\nI am guessing you can find most of the problems yourself. Printing
    a page in your font at a small size should help you find any major problems, as
    this will be used in small sizes.\r\n\r\nHope that helps! If you have time, you
    could take a look at <a href=\"http://typophile.com/node/68311\">my font</a>.

    and no kerning. Now I remember I didn't look over all of brianskywalker's remarks,
    but I'll do it right away.\r\n\r\nLowercase c, a and f have no serifs on their
    terminal strokes and I quite like it. I've put a serif on the uppercase C to make
    a comparison. Your great feedback is warmly welcomed!"

  body: "Well, as has been said before, I'm just a beginner so take what I say with
    a grain of salt.\r\n\r\nThis is looking pretty good (nice numerals), though on
    some of the bowls, arches, and  round corners, the strokes don't appear to be
    the same thickness. Some letters, like the uppercase U, look slightly lopsided
    to me. (Again, thickness of bowls and arches.) Some letters are very round, and
    some are more square, try to equalize it.\r\n\r\nDiagonal uppercase letters AMNWV...
    Try making the thin and thicks (as subtly different as they are) like so:\r\n-
    A: <code>/<strong>\\</strong></code>\r\n- V: <code><strong>\\</strong>/</code>
    (opposite of A)\r\n- M: <code>|<strong>\\</strong>/<strong>|</strong></code> (not
    with the inner strokes thinner)\r\n N: <code>|<strong>\\</strong>|</code>\r\n
    W: <code><strong>\\</strong>/<strong>\\</strong>/</code>\r\n\r\nAlso:\r\n- G should
    have a serif on it's stem\r\n- bottom stroke of the C should extend slightly past
    the top stroke\r\n- the horizontals  in your uppercase should be slightly thinner
    than the verticals\r\n- lowercase g is great! Though you could try making the
    ear sheared off diagonally\r\n- Maybe try connecting the bowl on the R to the
    stem, and making the angle of the leg slightly less.\r\n\r\n\r\nYour uppercase
    might be slightly too bold compared to the lowercase, but I would print a test
    out on paper to make sure. Also, the spacing is much too tight for text, although
    it works for titling, if you plan on having it used at all for text, you might
    want to loosen the spacing a bit. (Graphic designers tend to close up the spacing
    in large sizes if they feel it's needed.)\r\n\r\nSorry if this is a lot of critiques,
    and most of my previous critiques may still apply, but I hope it helps (remember
    the grain of salt!). Anyway, I've been waiting for the uppercase. This font is
    great! (Hope you release it!)"

  body: "My, now this is some constructive criticism! Where do you live? I will send
    you a pig for Christmas.\r\n\r\nThe basic spacing is almost done now. I've put
    more space between letters, as they are quite open. Yes, I'm having difficulties
    with the curved strokes (which basically are the font). I think I fiddle with
    them with just my bad eye. I should make some control shapes to help make the
    curves and diagonals more uniform. You are so right about the diagonals. I've
    improved them according to your suggestions:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/uc,lc,numbers_5572.jpg]\r\n\r\n\r\nIn
    the first post I've attached another pdf with the current spacing. Still no kerning.
    Set at 9/11, I think it is not the most unreadable design when printed.\r\n\r\nRight
    now I'm having trouble with the diacritical marks.\r\n\r\nAnother question comes
    to my mind: should I make the round curves more square, or the squarish ones more
    round?\r\n\r\nI will take time tomorrow to take an in-depth look at your remarks.\r\n\r\nThank
    you so much!"

  body: "Hey, not a problem!\r\n\r\nAs far as the rounded edges go, I'd say even it
    out. Some letters are naturally rounder, I think, and some (with smaller counters)
    need to be less round to still appear squarish. The lower case is good, for the
    most part. I would start with the O and the check the other letters against that."
