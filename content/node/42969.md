  go any further with this thing I was wondering if the kerning was alright? I think
  I'm kern challenged."

  body: "Looks good to me, but can I suggest abandoning the \u201Ckerning\u201D idea
    and just judging letter spacing with the ideal of seeing it as even as possible.
    \ To that end you can use the old \u201CHand Letterer\u201D trick of putting a
    piece of vellum over the type and penciling in the spaces between the letters.
    \ Relative weight can be better judged with a positive image, or so goes the old
    theory.  Letterers did pen and ink headlines  before Headliners or such.  They
    worked for Ad Agencies etc.  I fear a lot of their knowledge and tricks has been
    lost.\r\n\r\nThe second \u201Cs\u201C in Chess may look like it is wondering off
    a little."
