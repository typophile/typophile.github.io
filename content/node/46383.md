  body: The lack of further detail on this point is perplexing. The complications
    inherent in handing someone a note typed up in Wingdings and expecting them to
    decipher it on the spot are not conducive to a successful bank robbery. I'm not
    even sure if I can think of a way to construct a simple rebus expressing "give
    money or die" with the symbols available.

  body: Could the bandit be David Carson? He set an entire article in Raygun in Zapf
    Dingbats, so this appears to be in line with his style.
