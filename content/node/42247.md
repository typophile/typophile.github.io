body: "Now that we've forsaken the Kensington Pub, we seem to be jumping all over
  da place.\r\n\r\nOur next meeting is tomorrow, Wednesday, Feb. 20, 2008. It'll be
  held upstairs at Jupiter, 124 - 10th Street N.W. (Jupiter is just behind The Source,
  go around the corner and up the stairs; alternately, Jupiter is just past Saturn
  if you have the proper impulse engines.)\r\n\r\nShow up around 6:00 p.m. There's
  a good chance the Typos will be the largest group in the joint. We can be identified
  by (1) being at Jupiter, (2) drinking beer and talking, (3) possibly passing books,
  pamphlets, specimens & whatnot amongst ourselves. Don't be shy, show up and say
  hi. Bring stuff typographic for show&tell and to keep the enthusiasm going.\r\n\r\n"

    at the lunar eclipse.  ;-)
