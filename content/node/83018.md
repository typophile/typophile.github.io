  reading through them) but why not one more? \r\nWhat I\u2019m wondering are what
  brands \u2018own\u2019 Helvetica, and can/should always own it vs. companies that
  fall in line using it. I guess, what makes Helvetica special to certain companies
  over others?\r\n"

    you asking why some graphic designers use helvetica in logos and/or specify helvetica
    as the corporate typeface for their clients? Hasn't that been discussed extensively
    already? Or am I misunderstanding your question?"

    Helvetica is overused.\r\n\r\nIn my opinion, Helvetica is immensely dull and is
    a lazy choice. So I agree with hrant: run away from Helvetica."

    was to the original poster, not to hrant.   \r\n\r\nI didn't notice that hrant
    had revived an old thread, and the original poster was long gone and never replied
    to my question."

    most posters to wait for the first reply.
