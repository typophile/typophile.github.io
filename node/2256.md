  body: The web site is gone and the number has been disconnected. Short of swinging
    by, I&#39;d say you&#39;re right. &#40;I&#39;d happily do it, but Judah &amp;
    46th is quite a swing from where I&#39;m at.&#41; <BR> <BR>jb

  body: I was afraid of that when I called the number. &#40;Thanks for checking.&#41;
    It was oddly a pretty straight shot from my old place in Pleasanton, but I still
    hardly ever made it there. What a shame. If only I had a Zulu haiku to lament
    its disappearance. <BR> <BR>Alan
