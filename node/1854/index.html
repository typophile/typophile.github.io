  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Hola Amigos, <BR> <BR>I have a theory about this situation, discussed in the Build Forums, on a couple of weeks ago <BR> <BR>I receive an email from Hugo Perez from the pixietype foundry announcing new fonts with grey effects. <BR> <BR>I was trying to contact him about a month ago,  <BR>asking about if they have an authorization from FFF or truth in Design for using the FX technique who was created and owned by Truth in Design, who is the same as super pixel fonts, Whith no responses. <BR> <BR>I can`t understand why pixietype are selling, if they lauch before FFF first super pixel fonts, it seems they are making the same super pixel stuff without autorization, this behaviour is very suspicious. <BR> <BR>It seems that they buy a font form FFF,open in fog, and make the same technique, just changing the name. This is not fair, there are a lot of job behind this new greyscale trick, and this guys seems to non stop, without giving any credits or licence fee to TiD. <BR> <BR>Please tell me what do you think about this topic Typophiles, i dont want to be rude with pixietype or Hugo, but i believe in respect of the job behind this technology contribution in typography. <BR>    <BR> <BR>Regards, <BR> <BR>mh.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">But weren't you previously saying that TiD's &quot;technology&quot; was no big deal, not a real invention? <BR> <BR>Certainly, if Pixietype <i>did</i> swipe the technology (but how can you be sure?) without even giving credit, it's unethical. But without a patent on the part of TiD, it's not illegal. And if they just had the idea of making grayscale fonts by filling in &quot;partial&quot; pixels, and they developed their own techniques to do so, it's probably OK. <BR> <BR>Bottom line for me: if we become certain that Pixietype has indeed behaved unethically, we should mount a petition campaign. Otherwise it's more productive to spend the time pushing the envelope further. Handmade ClearType bitmaps, anyone?  :-) <BR> <BR>hhp <BR></div>

		<div class="commentbody">Hi, <BR>First of all, english is not my original language so, sorry. <BR>All I do is add quarter and eighth pixels to a standard pixel font. You can call it 'pixel font with greys' or 'hand made anti aliasing'. <BR>Chris Lowery said in another post: &quot;&quot;Super Pixel fonts&quot; describes a patent pending technique which provides reliable rendering on all TrueType environments. Your grey dot fonts will probably be great but they won't be &quot;Super Pixel fonts&quot; unless you license with us and build them like we do. Hrant is right, it takes more than sub-pixels. <BR> <BR>All I do is sub-pixels. I DO NOT use the technology that TiD have. So I don't do Super Pixel Fonts. <BR>I DO NO WANT to break any law, do something illegal or steal any technology.  <BR>If I'm doing this, sorry, I'll stop selling fonts with semi-pixels, sub-pixel or whatever you want to name it.  <BR> <BR>Thanks <BR>Hugo Perez <BR>Pixietype.com</div>

Please look for my response on your pixietype info address. <BR> <BR>Any developer who wants to create sub-pixel fonts can get support, licensing, and a good royalty through TiD's new site, which will launch in November. You do not need to know how to create sub-pixel fonts, only to paint all the characters in a GIF. TiD handles the rest. We will publish great fonts from anyone.  <BR> <BR>To become a licensed developer, contact me through typophile or truth @ truthindesign.com.
