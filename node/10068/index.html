<div class="post-content e-content" itemprop=articleBody>Hello! <br> <br>Im a graphical designer that just recently got completely addicted to typeface design. Im very happy i found this forum because obvously i will need some professional help =) <br> <br>This is one of my first attempts at designing a typeface. Im making it mainly for use as a display font in print graphics and websites. <br> <br>Thanks in advance. <br>- Lasse <br> <br><img src=http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/68555.gif alt="Typeface: SNAP!"></div>

<div class=commentbody>I quite like this concept, altough there's some issues with the way its working technically. <br> <br>There are a few characters in the lower case that could use tweaking: <br> <br>"m" i like, but consider splitting the two strokes that make it up (the "r" like shape and the other curve) and spacing them a little. At the moment the two are so close we almost lose the mid-stem all togther - it's losing it's "m"iness. <br> <br>"t" not working yet. try some other solutions, like the reverse J look - if you know what i mean. (sorry don't have time to mock-up visual samples). <br> <br>"q" seems that the stalk is too short. "w" seems too flat and the mid-stem needs to come up higher. <br> <br>In the uppercase the C, E, F, J, P & R are all significantly skinnier than the other glyphs. I guess this was intentional, any reason why these characters? <br> <br>Solid effort overall. Forgive me everyone for getting my type-anatomy wrong. It's too late and I'm too tired to whip out Bringhurst's Elements to cross-reference. Please, give me some feedback in turn on my sans-serif. <br> <br>Cheers.</div>

<div class=commentbody>I agree with Linus. <br> <br>The font looks great when you spell your name out in it. Those characters looks good together. For now I will assume that that is the flow you want to achive with the rest of the font. <br> <br>I would add some suggestions. <br> <br>Use more space between the letters so we can see them better. They seem squished together in the sample. <br> <br>Caps: Maybe pull the ends of the cap C around further fallowing the path of the cap O. The D is overly wide. Why not drop the foot of Cap J down below the baseline? The Cap K seems like an H. A small adjustment could make a big difference. The cap M seems a little wider than it needs to be. Again small change is what I suggest. What about Pulling the foot of the R out from the stem farther? Or a Bigger counter for both the P & R? Not both probably. How about a straight vertical tail on the Q? The W needs work. I can imagine 4-5 ways to change it. The Z is a little regular compared to the other interesting letters. Maybe treat it a bit more like the S? <br> <br>Lowercase: The e needs work. It stands out & doesn't flow. it's an important character so I would do lots of versions until you get one that flows. I like the a. I thing the f most be taller. Otherwise it is a mixed lowercase small cap thing which is too wonky for the cool spacy elegance of the Caps. I really like the ghij. Same for the k as the f. What about a double mid stem for the m? Like two overnapped 'n's? Maybe too wacky also. Just a smooth double hump might be good... I think the q needs a decending tail. The s feels cluncky to me. Whay not adopt the approach of the elegant Cap S? As Linus said the t needs reworking. I would try several ideas & see which ones feel closer to the feeling of the caps. Not that they should use the shapes of the caps - just the feeling. The w also needs reworking. <br> <br>Sweet font!</div>
