body: Can anyone identify this sans-serif typeface? It looks familiar but I can't
  put my finger on it. It's been popping up a few times in some of Non-Format's recent
  work. Something tells me this isn't one of the 'classic' typefaces unless it's a
  hidden gem.

    say it\u2019s custom by Non-Format."

  body: Do you have a link to the other post and perhaps they have some close alternatives?
    I'd be a little surprised if Non-Format had created a font that is this "refined"
    since most of their stuff is modifications of other fonts with heavy strokes /
    path offsets.
