body: "I'm having trouble finding an exact match for a font (even tried the Type ID
  forum!) so I'm probably in the position of needing to take an existing font that
  is close and modifying it.  But I haven't done any font modifications in 15 years.\r\n\r\nIs
  there an editor that I can bring a background graphic of a glyph into and use it
  to modify the existing glyph by tracing and nudging for accuracy?\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\n\r\nChris\r\n"
