<div class=commentbody>From "An Introduction to Book History" By David Finkelstein and Alistair McCleery, Routledge 2005
The printing workforce divided into a hierarchy: apprentices, journeymen, and master printers. As in most trades, young apprentices were indentured for two to five years into the service of a master who would provide training, food and board, clothing, and occasional payment. The apprentice would clean the workshop, run errands, prepare ink, pull the press, and ultimately learn the more skilled jobs from journeymen. A journeyman was a specialist -- an apprentice who had graduated to the role of compositor, corrector, type designer, and press operator. <...>
The average print shop supported half-a-dozen workmen, some permanent and some journeymen. The master printer, or in larger operations a head compositor, would oversee the printing process. Two men, a printer and an inker, would operate the press itself, supplied with paper by a warehouseman.<...>

<div class=commentbody>Christopher:
I do not know what you mean by "old,"but here's an account of how such hierarchies worked in the USA in the late 1960s and into the late 1970s.
In 1968 I took a job as an apprentice hand compositor at a small non-union job & novelty letterpress shop in rural Ohio. I knew nothing about how to set type. The other comp & I were overseen by a foreman who had been a union journeyman, but there was no formal apprenticeship or recognized progression to higher levels. I also learned to run both the hand-fed platen press and the Heidelberg windmill platen press.
18 months later I moved to a letterpress book printing shop in rural Vermont, also non-union. I was put on the apprentice-to-journeyman track, under the supervision of a guy from the state's department of labor who visited the shop a few times a year. For 5 years my progress was tracked by the foreman, who reported on me to the state guy. I had texts to read and tests to take. At the end of 5 years I got my state-issued journey card. It is one of my prized possessions.
I soon left that job and spent 9 months as night proofreader in a non-union magazine printing plant (not letterpress). The journeyman's card was useless. After a spell I went to Los Angeles, on the promise of journeyman's wages. HA! The shop was non-union; when I started work I was told I'd earn about half the journeyman's wage. It's a long story; I stayed there 6 months because I had no financial choice.
Then I opened my own shop in San Francisco, non-union, I and a partner. After a spell I was asked to become a hand comp in a composition house in SF. My Vermont journeycard was not worth a bucket of warm spit and I was paid apprentice wages. I was 35 and had been a non-union journeyman hand comp for 5 years. But it was still the most money I'd ever made, so I stayed 9 months. I was finally a union member, but all it got me was support from the steward when the owner tried to fire me for refusing overtime.
As far as the "Master Printer" designation goes, I never encountered that as a formal designation. I think that may have truly been in the "Old" days. To this day, looking back from a computer keyboard, I call myself a Master Printer because I was one of the best hand compositors in the Monotype industry at the time.
I hope that sheds some light.

<div class=commentbody><em>As far as the “Master Printer” designation goes, I never encountered that as a formal designation. I think that may have truly been in the “Old” days.</em>
The debut of Gill Sans occurred on a pamphlet distributed to the annual conference of British master printers in 1928.
In 1933 Gill observed, to another crowd of "master printers": "To be a 'master printer' to-day means that you know how to sell the printing done by your employees. The master printer is primarily a man of business."
And perhaps we can see them conceding that fact 41 years later: [[http://www.warwick.ac.uk/services/library/mrc/ead/375col.htm|"The Federation of Master Printers and Allied Trades of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland was founded in Apr 1901. In June 1931 the Federation's name was changed to the British Federation of Master Printers. In April 1974 its name was changed again to become the British Printing Industries Federation."]]</div>

<div class=commentbody>All interesting. Master Printer is a business man of printing. I think it implies the classic notion of printing being related to some sort of art allied to science. Printers in the good old days were scientists and versed in the arts in general, and the economics of the production.
In my days in letterpress, we called it like this:
Apprentice Composition - 2 years
Half-Officer Composition - 3 years
Compositor - 5 years
Apprentice Pressman - 2 years
Half-Officer Pressman - 3 years
Pressman - 5 years
I finally understand now the concept of Jorneyman and the Union Shop.</div>

<div class=commentbody>This isn't about the apprentice/journeyman/master printer classification, just a bit about the old days.
I've set a few books designed by George Mackie. George was a British pilot in World War II, to give some idea of his age. He is also a Royal Designer to Industry (RDI) in graphic design, as is Matthew Carter in type design. In other words, he was good.
The specifications for a book would be something like "set it in 11.5 Baskerville, leaded 2 points" There would be a specification of the font for the chapter openings, but the comp was expected to know & work out most spacings, & often the subheads, extracts, and notes. There would be layouts, but not heavily marked, and not everything was even traced. You just had to get the idea from the sketches, and put it together.
While perhaps less was possible technically in those days, more was required of the comp. You couldn't turn such a set of specifications & layouts over to an apprentice, at least if you didn't want to bear the wrath from someone like George. You probably couldn't give that set of specifications to any comp today without getting a squawk -- certainly no one else at out shop, and some of them have 20+ years experience.
As a designer, George would rewrite the copy if he felt he had good reason. The publisher invariably would back him up. Many of the experienced people in publishing & printing knew more than the specifics of their particular task, and were expected to contribute all of their skills. Well, within reason.
I imagine Will Powers knows something about this kind of work; unless I miss my guess, the shop he worked at in Vermont was started by a (U.S.) WWII fighter pilot who was a good friend of George Mackie, and a kindred spirit.</div>

<div class=commentbody>A+ to Charles for acuity. He refers to the Stinehour Press of Lunenburg, Vermont. That's where I got my skill as a compositor, and first saw how books were designed well. Sad to say, the press just closed its doors; prospects for re-opening appear dubious, from what I hear.
Regarding the relations of Master Printers to Journeymen, I can offer an echo of Charles's George Mackie tale. Lawton Kennedy was one of San Francisco's venerable letterpress book printers. As a comp at the Mackenzie-Harris Monotype composition house, I was once handed a sheaf of galley proofs, along with the ms, on which were no specifications other than the desired page count. The owner of M&H knew Lawton's work was to be set in Caslon and he knew the page size; he specified text face & size, measure & leading. Display, page depth, chapter drops, folios, initials: all that and more was left to me, the Journeyman. I had to make the book come into the page count, in full 16's, acting under the gaze of the Master, the shop owner.
But only a designer with real clout, as George Mackie, can re-write copy. I prefer the old adage given to apprentices: "Follow the copy, even if it flies out the window and you must jump out after it." Designers & typesetters should be encouraged to write queries on mss when they see either possible errors or textual ways to improve design. But not to change copy. That said, I just got page proofs back from a design shop with a note explaining why they have dropped a subhead for both design and text reasons. This is a shop with which we work frequently. They are approaching a Mackie-like degree of clout after 9 years working with us.

<div class=commentbody>Just an aside: George Mackie could get by with rewriting copy only when he was with the Edinburgh University Press. He tried that when he freelanced for some U.S. university presses, and by in large they were not pleased. Different times, I suppose.</div>
