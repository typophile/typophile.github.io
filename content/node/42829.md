  C Hairline) typeface is printed in any reference work (whether in print or out of
  print) and the name of any such reference works? I understand that this typeface
  is not currently available in digitized form. I am aware of two web sites with complete
  and partial character set appearing in low quality images, but prefer to see the
  complete character set of this typeface in print. Thanks.\r\n Ray"

    its on there - although not quite as hairline as the photo lettering specimens...

    now except for the sample on some stationery dating from the early 1970's. Do
    you know if this is the Image Club Graphics version? As Justin comments, that
    version (and your image) is a thicker rendering (not as hairline) than what I
    have on the stationery.\r\n Also, by chance do either of you or anyone know the
    typeface used on the Typophile site for topic headings such as for this thread?
    Thanks again.\r\n Ray"

    a lot of characters that you find in present day digital fonts, but it also contains
    a lot of others that you don't. Some are downright whimsical, such as the dagger.\r\n"

  body: As for seeing the complete character set in print, many headline font specimen
    catalogs from the Seventies would have it. The kind to look for are ones produced
    by typesetting houses for their customers, rather than the ones produced by the
    film font manufacturers, such as VGC, which would usually only show one-line specimens.

    catalogs. Thanks for the tip though.\r\n Ray"

    forum provided to me privately a 220k\r\ntif file that displays the characters
    with many, but not all, of the alternates. It has all of the characters I am interested
    in. My original stationery from the early 1970's has  twenty characters, most
    with the uppercase size about 3/4\" high. What I don't have is any digital version.
    I suspect the version you have, Miss Tiffany, is that done by Image Club Graphics,
    which I understand is thicker than the original. Still it would be of interest
    to me.\r\n Ray"

    to Incipit's notes, Lubalin and Carnase's design (c 1965) is owned by their estates,

    anyone can shed some light on this it would help tie up loose ends."
