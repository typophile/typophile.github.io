body: hi folks. new to this forum, so let me start by saying howdy. now to the gist
  of the post. i am in the process of starting a redesign for the magazine i work
  for. we are going to do this the right way by determining what our two type faces
  are going to be.  <BR> <BR>my preliminary selections are Alfon &#40;serif&#41; and
  Giacomo &#40;sans&#41; by terminal design.  <BR> <BR>I would like to get some input
  from the typography gurus here on a couple more sets of sans and serif types faces.
  so that i can better compare and contrast to my preliminary selection above. <BR>
  <BR>the only is, is that these faces have to be classic yet contemporary. any and
  all input is welcomed and appreciated. <BR> <BR>thanks in advance. <BR> <BR>erin

  body: Erin, could you post some pages from the current design? This would be useful
    just to get a visual on where it is at now. <BR> <BR>No worries about the double-posts,
    it happens to everyone.

  body: Erin, what&#39;s you budget for the fonts? <BR>Would your magazine consider
    commissioning its own custon designs? <BR> <BR>hhp

  body: Hrant, <BR> <BR>I need to keep it as low budget as possible. maybe $150-$200
    per family. Custom type is only a mere dream for me. Texas Monthly mag comissioned
    a type face for their body copy and it ran them about 40K. not gonna happen here.

  body: 40K is quite a lot. Was it just for the type? <BR>Any more details you can
    spill about that &#34;deal&#34; would be devoured ravenously. <BR> <BR>As for
    using Terminal Design&#39;s stuff, that seems very sound. <BR> <BR>hhp
