  body: "This, like all the other UPC Thai fonts in Windows, was licensed from Unity
    Progress in Thailand. The company still exists (we extended our rights a while
    back) but is not in the fonts game. I don't think there are any commercial font
    efforts in Thailand which is a shame. Anyway as long as you don\u2019t redistribute
    the file (or derivative font file) you can  use it in your print or digital project.
    \r\n\r\nAlso: If you need to install the font on another platform or machine that
    doesn't have the font you can license it from Ascender Corp. "

    embedding) but I will need to embed the font within the PDF sent to the printers.
    Is this considered redistributing?\r\n\r\nStewart"

    the font to the printers, but must delete them after the book has been printed?\r\n\r\nCheck

  body: "Ha, not exactly. This is 'printer', as in laserjet, not as in Kinkos. The
    first point is the one that relates to PDF...\r\n\r\nb. Font Components. While
    the software is running, you may use its fonts to display and print content. You
    may only\r\n\xB7 embed fonts in content as permitted by the embedding restrictions
    in the fonts; and\r\n\xB7 temporarily download them to a printer or other output
    device to print content. \r\n\r\nI also have to ask, is there a big Thai community
    in your part of South Africa? What type of Thai content are you printing?"

  body: Okay, the font is in Windows to support Thai, and I don't know if the font
    is any good for Latin body text, but for page numbers, how can you go wrong.
