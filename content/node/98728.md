  body: "That reminded me of a line quoted by Eric Bana's character in Hanna, \"Music;
    a combination of sounds with a view to beauty of form and expression of emotion\".
    You could take everything after \"sounds\" and be talking about type or indeed,
    architecture.\r\n\r\nI have been thinking about this a lot lately but is beauty
    a transcendent thing or infinitely subjective? Beyond that it is deeply personal
    but I am intrigued by perspectives."

    through his style/philosophy of architecture, but he inspired me because he showed
    what is possible.\r\n\r\nPerhaps it was through his father's teachings that gave
    him the crucial understanding of what can be achieved ...one design element at
    a time for the greater whole.\r\n\r\nn.\r\n\r\n \r\n"

    seen the documentary yet. But the common man, rather than the elite, is uncomfortable
    with modern art, and seeks conventional aesthetic gratification from art - whether
    the beauty of cute puppies, a sunset over a mountain behind a lake, or that of
    Miss February."

  body: "Ah yes, Scruton. While it's worthwhile to watch/read his stuff, but I'm usually
    dropping out because of his assumptions on 'the contemporary' in culture and arts.
    His stance on how people should fill the 'free time' they get in the western world
    only fits the elitist few. If we all lived according to his thoughts on the arts,
    the world would be a quite boring place.\r\n\r\nSure people should be taught more
    to appreciate art and culture (according to Scruton this should be done to teach
    people true emotions and beauty) But hey, some people care less, and to always
    direct your personal flame war at them as the destroyers of society (as Scruton
    does) gets really old fast.\r\n\r\nTo stay on topic, Niemeyer was an amazing architect
    who showed us the possibilities of architecture and need to break from the mold.
    With construction methods becoming more advanced these days, he is a great icon
    who showed how to merge technique and aesthetics."

    right clients allowing him to play.  And that's what inspires me about him. I
    mean really, throughout the history of the 'Urban' concept not very many architects
    \ have been able to determined a whole city's vibe. Even the notable American
    architect Frank Lloyd Wright couldn't pull that one off. Wright had the plan(s)
    but not the client.\r\n\r\nn.\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Niemeyer\u2019s quote on beauty was a riposte to functionalism.\r\nBy that,
    he didn\u2019t mean that the clever solution to a functional problem could be
    considered beautiful, but that there was a sensual enjoyment to be had from the
    perception of form.\r\n\r\n<em> \u2026 not very many architects have been able

    a lot of Mackintosh, but he was marginal and designed few major buildings in his
    day, despite his present reputation. However, the city centre is full of Victorian
    Greek Revival buildings, a large number designed by Alexander Thomson, which really
    set the tone of the place."

    he was well felt across the pond ... no more so than in F.Ll.W's Prairie School.
    \r\n\r\nTomas Jefferson also had the right 'clients' didn't he tho ...  and a
    very far reaching architectural influence at that. \r\n\r\nOne of my all time
    favorite architects from times past is Hawksmoor ...a London architect. His Westminster
    Abby towers are f'n awesome. Even tho he was schooled by Wren I consider Nicholas
    Hawksmoor to be a transitional architect who indeed had a crazy influence. In
    all his stuff there's a distinct edge to his ordering.\r\n\r\nYou don't get that
    with Niemeyer's work nor with his prot\xE9g\xE9s such as Hadid and company ...

  body: I went on a long walk across London many years ago, visiting all of the surviving
    Hawksmoor churches. I want to go back to Christchurch Spitalfields some day, because
    it has been beautifully renovated inside now; when I was there it was in terrible
    state. They are an eccentric collection of buildings, each quite different from
    the others and from pretty much everything contemporary. I don't think his sense
    of proportion was as good as Wren's, but he was more imaginative and less prone
    to repeat himself.
