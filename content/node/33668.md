body: "Hello,\r\n\r\nI have been working on a display font based on the inscriptions
  I've seen on the catacombs of a church here in Porto Portugal, the \"Igreja de S\xE3o
  Francisco\". These are painted grave inscriptions. In was interested in them because,
  even though they are clearly based on victorian leters, I think they may have something
  of portuguese (like the \"A\" or the \"R\"), or at least a unic interpretation of,
  may be, british influences which can be seen, for instance, in older stores, in
  Porto. I would like ask for your opinions on this. What do you think about these
  letters? Can you relate these forms to other alphabeths from the early 20th century?\r\n\r\nThanks
  in advanced:)\r\n\r\nHere is a pdf file:"

  body: "Wow, these are both awesome!  \r\n\r\nCatacumba One: I really like the swooping
    horizontal stroke-serifs of the T, E, L, Z, etc.  And does Portuguese really use
    MB, MP, TE, HE, TU, TT ligatures? Wild.  The only thing I don't like is the foot
    of the R -- it seems like an accident.  I want it to go more horizontal at the
    end, or go from narrow to wide, maybe like the diagonal in the 4.  \r\n\r\nCatacumba
    Two:  I think the E and F are too narrow, and the H is too wide -- it looks like
    it's two letters stuck together.  The  tail on the R is great -- looks like a
    dangerous fishook.  The tail on the 6 and the 9 don't match the rest of the font
    -- they are too geometric. Maybe make the two forked ends go in separate directions,
    or use a tail like that on the R.  And the serifs on the 2, 3, and 7 should look
    like the serifs on the T. \r\n\r\nOh, and I want to see what a lowercase would
    look like.\r\n\r\nOverall, this looks really great!  \r\n "

  body: "I think this can be valuable thanks to the integration of the decorative
    cut, letting people mix the two creatively. Make the two fonts uniwidth (each
    character having exactly the same set-width in each font) for extra usefulness.\r\n\r\n>
    Can you relate these forms to other alphabeths from the early 20th century?\r\n\r\nYes,
    I saw De Vinne in it (even before reading your mention of a timeframe).\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "Sorry Matt but the ligatures were my idea, to make the font more fun to use.
    The original grave inscriptions doens't have any ligatures (I think) although
    I have seen ligatures in stone inscriptions.\r\nI know the foot of the R is very
    strange, it's a litle uncomfortable perhaps, but it caught my eye since the first
    time I saw it, I don't know where it came from. Thanks for your comments they
    will be very helpfull.\r\nAbout the font's width, I suppose I'll have to something
    about it, because my idea was to make two mixable fonts, and the uniforming the
    widths woud help.\r\n"

    "K" might look better if it''s more coherent with "R".'

  body: The foms are pretty sweet already. I agree with Hrant that making the forms
    such that they can lay over the top of each other might be nice. My main critique
    is that the kerning isn't right yet.
