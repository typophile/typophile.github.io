  writings in Arabic and English. What do I need to know? What typefaces mix well
  together? Can I make InDesign do both? \r\n\r\nThanks, kris."

    Word (ack!), make a PDF, and place that PDF in InDesign not-ME.\r\n\r\n__\r\nwww.typeoff.de"

  body: "Alternatively, you could use MS Publisher :)\r\n\r\nNote that if you are
    going to use Word or Publisher and paste resulting PDFs as graphics in regular
    InDesign, you will need to use Windows Office: the Mac version does not support
    Arabic layout.\r\n\r\nInDesign ME is pretty good, but there are some bugs affecting
    vocalised text. So long as your text does not include vowel marks (specifically
    multiple vowel marks on ligatures), InDesign ME CS should suit you pretty well."
