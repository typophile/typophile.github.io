  body: I shouldn&#39;t be giving away this expert tip for faster IDing,  <BR>but
    what the heck... <BR> <BR>1. identify <BR>2. post <BR>3. edit post <BR>4. insert
    link <BR>5. save edit <BR> <BR>How&#39;s that for evening out the odds? <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"
    ALT=":-&#41;" BORDER=0> <BR> <BR>P.S. Wallpaper&#39;s Amplitude had already been
    IDed by  <BR>Marc in <a href="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/19507.html"

  body: 'Raymond, neither one of these typefaces are available  <BR>for free, but
    <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/microsoft/georgia/" target="_blank"> Georgia</a>
    &#40;also by Matthew Carter&#41; is a decent  <BR>free alternative for ITC Charter.
    <BR> <BR>As a rule of thumb, fine typography is never free: there&#39;s  <BR>just
    too much hard work involved in developping a decent  <BR>typeface, let alone a
    whole type family.'
