  body: I like Th for discretionary. Some people really like it as a ligature and
    some don't.

    of a ligated \u2018Th\u2019 and a plain \u2018Th\u2019 is not very obvious, at
    icon size."

  body: "Another complication is that Adobe includes T_h ligature in their standard
    {liga} feature, not {dlig}. \r\n\r\nI personally wish it was discretionary, but
    that's not the case currently in Adobe Pro fonts. Which, like it or not, tend
    to set the expectations.\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Even across Adobe fonts, the classification of ligatures is not consistent.
    It\u2019s a design decision. \u2018ct\u2019 and \u2018st\u2019 are a {dlig} in
    Arno and Garamond Premier \u2013 and a {hlig} in Hypatia Sans. \u2018\u017Ft'
    is a {liga} in Arno, GPP, Hypatia \u2013 and a {dlig} in Jenson. It often depends
    on the style and genre of the font in question (I guess you have no problem with
    \u2018Th\u2019 being a standard lig in Caflisch Script, do you?). I can imagine
    decisions have also been made with regard to feature support in the common applications."

    the T_h in Caflisch. \r\n\r\nBut neither do I feel it is required in order to
    compensate for a collision or impossible spacing in the way the f ligatures generally
    are.  Plain ol' Th in Caflisch works just fine.  So, I'd still argue that it's
    better placed in the {dlig} feature.\r\n\r\nBut, back to the main point: T_h is
    not a good candidate as a representative icon for discretionary ligatures.\r\n\r\n--
