  body: "It\u2019s connection is usually that it's based on lettering found in post-revolutionary
    Soviet propaganda posters. Posters by the Stenberg brothers seem to be some of
    the most popular sources. There's not much more to it than that; in part because
    modernism was effectively banned in the early 1930s so its practitioners moved
    on."

  body: "There are some associations between angular Latin script block cap types
    and political radicalism, but the style as it originally emerged was a broadly
    cultural international phenomenon.\r\n\r\nIn the West, types such as Raleigh Gothic,
    City, and Bankers Gothic had no radical pretensions.\r\n\r\nI've always thought
    of Raleigh Gothic as a skyscraper face.\r\n\r\nThe main feature of faux-cyrillic
    typography has not been, IMO, particular styles of type, but the use of Cyrillic
    characters as substitutions for Latin characters (e.g. in the Borat movie title).
    \r\n\r\nGood designers don't need to play the faux-Cyrillic card (e.g. flipping
    \"R\") when alluding to constructivism, it's a little too obvious, turning radical
    posturing into kitsch.\r\n\r\n\r\n"
