  <BR>Dear Mr Hosek, <BR>Normal channels of communication have failed. The last time
  this <BR>happened, a post to Typo-L succeeded in getting through to you,  <BR>but
  this time that hasn&#39;t worked either, so I am now trying this <BR>forum, hoping
  to get a refund on Serif, which has not shipped an <BR>issue in about three years.
  <BR> <BR>This past September you wrote on Typo-L: &#34;I&#39;ll give refunds to
  <BR>the impatient&#34;&#42;. I declared myself as impatient and asked for a <BR>refund.
  I was advised on September 26 that the refund has been <BR>issued but it would take
  upto two billing cycles. It&#39;s now been <BR>about four cycles, and still nothing.
  Could you please let me <BR>know what to expect? Is there perhaps some information
  <BR>I could throw at my bank? <BR> <BR>&#42; <a href="http://listserv.heanet.ie/cgi-bin/wa?A2=ind0209&amp;L=typo-l&amp;D=0&amp;T=0&amp;P=12097"
