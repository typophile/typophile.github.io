  body: Looks like a custom logo to me, the way the r hooks up with the b and all.
    May have been based in part on Handel Gothic too.

  body: "Chalet Tokyo from House Industries has a similar b, more so than Bauhaus\r\n\r\nhttp://www.houseind.com/index.php?page=showfont&id=4&subpage=viewfonts\r\n\r\nYou
    should also look at Mike's Bauhaus Font ID Guide\r\n\r\nhttp://www.bowfinprintworks.com/BauhausFaces.html\r\n\r\nbut
    I still think it's a logo, not a font."
