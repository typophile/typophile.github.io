  body: "I wonder if [[http://web.archive.org/web/20010121204600/webcom.net/~nfhome/roman2.htm|this]]
    is close. I found that Conrad Sweynheym published the \"Opera\" of Lactintius.
    Then the linked article claims this typeface was \"the first truly Roman typeface\",
    \ and was designed by him in 1468.\r\n\r\n[edit: 'Opera' is plural of 'opus' which
    means 'work', as I understand it.]\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: Sweynheym and Pannartz printed Lactantius twice (1465 in Subiaco, 1468 in
    Rome) using two different typeface. The latter is something like <a href="http://www.ndl.go.jp/incunabula/e/collection/incu_32_01.html">this</a>
    or Mike's link, while the former has more gothic features. I can't find any picture
    on Google.
