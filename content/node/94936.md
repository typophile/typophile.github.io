  I've done my drawings and I've run into some technical hurdles beyond my knowledge.
  If I can guess correctly, I have some horrible hinting nightmares ahead of me. I
  want to believe I don't.  The image below is what it looks like at post script  size
  72 pt. \r\n<a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/14402206@N08/7618824426/\" title=\"Screen

  is the same font seen through the preview panel of Fontlab. \r\n<a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/14402206@N08/7618824370/\"

  is what shows up when you access the hinting window. \r\n<a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/14402206@N08/7618824568/\"

  this a matter of using the dark arts of font hinting? Thank you for your help. Also,
  does there exist literature on hinting?\r\n\r\nA handshake in thought.\r\n\r\n"

    worried about how it will perform and appear small on screen, maybe make a "solid"
    version too.

  body: Thank you dberlow. Right now it is only acceptable at size is 256 pt. I would
    like it to work better down to size 72 pt. The preview panel  on fonlab does a
    better job of rendering the font.

    the cops.\r\n\r\nAlso, hey: what you got so far looks good but, if it only works
    at 256 point, you are not going to get a lot of sales. Which, of course, is only
    important if eating on a regular basis is important. You gotta prioritize.\r\n\r\nTake
    the same approach and make it work at 72pt, and you got a sure winner\u2026which,
    in my experience, is a hell of a lot better than a sure loser. But, that's just
    me\u2026"

    effort hinting this up the wazoo for ideal performance at any size, make different
    cuts for different sizes, and charge for each cut separately (with some bundle
    pricing too though). And you should be able to reduce the required effort greatly
    via interpolation.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
