body: And its design was posted on Typophile critique board, would we think the <em>a</em>
  was too wide, the <em>n</em> and <em>o</em> were too narrow, and the verticals of
  the <em>N</em> were too thin? Basically, with all the rule-breaking done with this
  face, would we see them as mistakes and obstacles to legibility?

  body: "Are you asking about the real Franklin Gothic, contemporary digitizations,
    or ITC Franklin? Because I\u2019m staring at the original lowercase cast in metal
    and don\u2019t see those problems, and I\u2019ve studied the uppercase N enough
    to know that it\u2019s fine.\r\n\r\nAnd Franklin Gothic does not break any rules.
    There are no rules, save that letters must retain some semblance of their common
    forms to remain legible. The notion that type and typography are or should be
    governed by rules is a result of mediocre pedagogues trying to dumb things down."

  body: "Yikes, I really have to watch my words. What I meant by \"rule-breaking\"
    in this case is that ITC Franklin Gothic has unique features that are not commonly
    seen. Those features, to me, are what make the typeface identifiable. About the
    <em>N</em>: I believe Doyald Young, in Fonts & Logos, referred to its stroke weights
    as backwards. What I'm trying to figure out here, is the rationale of the distinct
    features \u2014 whether they're done to solve certain issues, or done for distinction.
    \r\n\r\nIt matters to me because when I draw up glyphs, I follow certain patterns
    to ensure consistency amongst the others. There's a difference between a novice
    making daring decisions versus a master doing it. So I was curious. Does the <em>N</em>
    work <em>because</em> it's drawn that way? Or is the <em>N</em>'s design just
    fine/acceptable because it doesn't hurt the typeface? "

    like. "

    and visual distinctiveness are not mutually exclusive\u2014in letterforms one
    will always impact the other. My guess is that when Benton designed Franklin he
    used the alternating stroke weights both to balance the color of the heavy letters
    and to give it a look more akin to serif type or writing than to monoweight designs,
    which the market had been flooded with for decades. "
