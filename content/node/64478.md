  body: 'Don''t know it, sorry. It looks like some one added a thick stroke to it
    though. Try posting this in the Type ID forums here. Also try adding a descriptive
    title next time (like ''Seascapes: oblique script - what is it?'') - this will
    make it easier to locate amongst the many threads and postings on Typophile. Good
    luck!'
