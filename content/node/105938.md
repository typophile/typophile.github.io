  anyone know how I can create a fully-working Unicode Hebrew font (complete with
  proper nikkud alignment) from this?"

    a font is a major undertaking so my question would be WHY?\r\nWhy are you attached
    to this particular font?   Have you created fonts for English or some other Latin
    language? \r\nPeople spend years creating a font.  \r\nThere are lots of free
    fonts for Hebrew."

  body: "Isn't that font, Vilna? There is an open-source Unicode font that emulates
    Vilna that you can learn from -- Mekorot-Vilna. The Hebrew range in the Linux
    Libertine font also is a Vilna style font.\r\n\r\nYou'll find both of them in
    the <a href=\"http://opensiddur.org/tools/fonts/\">Open Siddur open source and
    Unicode Hebrew font pack</a>. \r\n\r\nNote there are some issues with diacritic
    placement with this font which needs fixing.\r\n"
