  body: After study I think it is hand done - the two Gs are not quite the same nor
    is the E in Eggs and The E in Care. That said a number of early san serifs fonts
    are close.

  body: "Agree this is hand lettering with strokes of about even thickness in the
    style of the 19th century grotesks/grotesques. For some ideas as to the possible
    shapes of other letters you might look at Block, Helvetica Black, Sweet Gothic
    and Folio among others.\r\nDon\r\n"

  body: "I agree that Gascogne is a rather good approximation for _Per Parcels Post_.
    Both Gascogne and the 1923 Egg Box lettering are typical of a soft rounded style
    that was popular from about 1900 to 1930. But Gascogne is a closer fit than other
    such \" friendly\" fonts from the era, such as Windsor, Verona or Cooper.\r\nHowever,
    I only recognize Gascogne from the digital version.\r\nAs far as I can determine
    it first appeared as a font by B & P Graphics in 1991 [or earlier] with seven
    weights. This was followed by fonts from TypeShop, and later Softmaker, with the
    same seven weights and the same scale and digital outlines -- allowing for errors
    from ps to ttf format conversion etc. -- as the B & P Graphics fonts.\r\nSo my
    question is, what did B & P Graphics use as a source. An original creation? Something
    created from scratch by a photo-type era company? An early 20th century font?
    If so, what, and by whom?\r\nDon"

  body: "To muddy the waters further we have to recognize that B & P Graphics was
    a notorious font forger. This is what Luc Devroye said about the company:\r\n---start
    quote---\r\nThis company sold lots of fonts in the mid 1990s under slightly changed
    names. In the 1993 truetype collection, I count at least 1003 fonts. There are
    1000 fonts in their 1991 type 1 collection. Many names reappear later under the
    Softmaker label, dated 1996. It is unclear whether B&P Graphics has evolved into
    Softmaker GmbH and/or FantasticArts.com. Many of their fonts can be found on free
    font sites, and indeed, the collection is in limbo. Uli Stiehl writes: The British
    font forging company GST Technology alias Greenstreet Software selling thousands
    of font forgeries made by Brendel & Pabst, was sued by Linotype in 2001. And the
    German font forging company Brendel & Pabst alias B & P Graphics Ltd. alias Brendel
    Informatik GmbH alias The Quick Brown Fox GmbH in Cologne was sued by FontShop
    in Berlin.\r\n---end quote--\r\nsource: http://luc.devroye.org/fonts-45532.html\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Perhaps Gascogne was a Typeshop/Brendel original?\r\nHere is what Luc Devroye
    has to say http://luc.devroye.org/fonts-46259.html\r\nNote in particular the phrase
    \"Thanks to his perfectionism, type users can have the luxury of choosing a specific
    type weight out of seven from as many as 65 font-families in the TypeShop Collection.
    \"\r\nGascogne comes in seven weights.\r\nBut if Gascogne was a Brendel seven
    weight development, what was Brendel's source for Gascogne?\r\nDon"

  body: The slightly rounded corners on the strokes may be an artifact of the printing
    process, not the design of the type. I can't tell from this photo what the box
    material is, but since early in the 20th Century, cardboard packaging has often
    been printed by flexography. Invented to accommodate printing surfaces too thick
    or too irregular for letterpress printing, flexography uses type made of rubber
    instead of metal. The softer type material can make corners appear slightly rounded.
