When I ask this I am thinking of <strong>ff fl fi </strong>etc rather than <strong>st </strong>or <strong>ct</strong> the later being a little distracting I think. I ask this because I had been thinking as an article of faith you might say that certain ligatures ( assuming a ligature design that is not showy or attention getting ) simply did make better word forms and hence generally speaking better &amp; more pleasant immersive reading.</p>
<p>But think about it again I realize that all I have is my gut for this.</p>
<p>What do you guys think?</p>

<p>Do ligatures improve readability?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Kevin Larson, may correct me if I&rsquo;m wrong, but I think that any improvement in reading performance between texts where the only difference is ligatures vs no ligatures would be far too small to measure using current techniques.</p>
<p>I know the team studied performance where all the typographic stops had been pulled out (ligs, small caps, osf etc.,) vs no typographic niceties and found the difference not measurable even then.</p>
<p>Cheers, Si</p>

<p>No not really, I think that ligatures improve readability but I think it&rsquo;s impossible to prove they do.</p>
<p>I think Kevin would say that when ligatures are used along with small caps, old style figues, correct spacing etc., that you can measure improved performance.</p>

And the more clearly and definitely it suggests that form, the more we value it.&rdquo; - Talbot Baines Reid, <em>Ars Typographica,</em> Winter, 1920.</p>
<p>In classic serifed faces, the fi and fl combinations create indefinite forms in which the letters are almost-merged. Ligatures solve this problem by fully merging them.</p>
<p><img src="/images/old-images/liga_5597.jpg" alt="">
Reading research has discovered that we read letters not words, but I suspect it is more likely that we read discrete, contiguous shapes &ndash; which is what most letters are, except for those which have separate accents, and that includes the i. Therefore, the circumstance where the dot of the i becomes attached to an adjacent letter is detrimental to readability.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a rationalization for something we understand not with mere intellect or gut feeling, but with typographic sensibility.</p>

<p>As would be the case with most of us here. But that is because we are trained to look for them, just as typewriter quotes bother us, and slow down our reading. But to most people, these typographic niceties are not recognized, and would not cause them to &ldquo;stop short.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I see it as a case, like so many other things, where good typography can give good color to a page, and that can improve reading. Will Harris makes some good points in his article (linked above). I will insist that good color does improve readibility, at least until someone shows me a study that refutes it.</p>
<p>Bad color &hellip; the worst case being the use of bold words sprinkled within text &hellip; means that the eye is attracted to the (bold) words, breaking the normal flow of the text. This has to decrease readability as the eye is jumping about unnecessarily.</p>
<p>Lining figures, fake small caps, full cap acronyms, and other bumps in the road to good color will all do the same thing, although  not as badly as bold text.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>The other difficulty is that some sets of ligs are done better than others.  It might be hard to make a blanket statement about ligatures without measuring the difference between the good ones and the not-so-good ones. 
The main job of the lig is to avoid the crash and the hole.  To me, it makes sense that a crash and a hole can cause a brief moment to sort out slowing down the reading a tiny amount. Context solves most of it but I find when I am looking at text in a foreign language, the absence of ligs seems most jarring&ndash;I have no context to help me there.
The other issue is with typography that is readable enough as words and language but whose meaning becomes enhanced by typographic effects including ligatures. This is probably not the case for emersive reading but might hold true for the things we might dwell over reading a bit longer&ndash;covers, ads, menus, art books, display material&hellip;</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Alessandro : I do see beauty there but plenty of beautiful things are not functional. Ideally the two should be married &amp; if you listen to some beauty should precede or fuction should as they prefer. But my question is how did you come to decide this. That is what I mean by basis. You can still count me as sympathetic just skeptical of either point of view having been made in a some kind of solid way.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The other difficulty is that some sets of ligs are done better than&hellip;&rdquo; Chris that&rsquo;s a very good point and while it clouds the issue somewhat - that&rsquo;s just too frickin' bad. That&rsquo;s reality!</p>
<p>Actually the only really strong arguement I have heard so far against ligatures is that they can make spacing look odd when the basic letter spacing is screwed with. This is Will Harris' aregument. See the link above. But his point of view is overly practical in my view. He is advocating safer type. Not better type if you see what I mean. He is seeking the robust over the perfect and somewhat brittle. I see his point even if I am not completely taken with it.</p>
<p>Reading over everybody&rsquo;s posts the final thing that I am reminded of ( again one of Will&rsquo;s arguements or obsevations ) is that it is possible to simply design letters differently to avoid the problems that would have occured. An f can be made more narrow so collision is avoided.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.will-harris.com/ligatures.htm">http://www.will-harris.com/ligatures.htm</a></p>
<p>So I suppose I aught to reframe the question ( without expecting a solid answer per se ) is it better to redesign the forms or to use ligatures for immersive reading. I bet they wash out as more or less equal. And other issues such as &lsquo;is it a revival?&rsquo; etc. must trump any kind of absolute decision you could make.</p>
<p>Of course now I am think about it I am starting to see other redesigned elements in typefaces which are not ligature related but are related to robustness in spacing such as the seemingly shrinking arm on the &lsquo;r&rsquo; glyph. Anybody care to mention other examples?</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>It sounds like a lot of people are saying the same thing: they&rsquo;re good if they&rsquo;re good.</p>
<p>I think ligatures should fix a problem, and they should disappear. I&rsquo;ve seen lots of nice Linotype faces (and others) which are designed to not need ligatures. I think it&rsquo;s especially difficult for young type designers to come around to the idea that ligatures aren&rsquo;t always better &ndash; because they are so fun to make and look at.</p>
<p>As mentioned above, if the ligature itself doesn&rsquo;t match the overall letterspacing, it&rsquo;s trouble.</p>
<p>Once again, I can cite some changes between the old Type 1 version of Utopia and the newer OpenType version to show how two different approaches to ligatures compare. (I always thought the old ligatures were a little obtrusive, despite my liking the design of them. I think especially the first f in the ffi &ldquo;reaches&rdquo; a little too much.)</p>

		<div class="commentbody">I suspect that Utopia&rsquo;s popularity as a news face might have something to do with this. Given that most news text varies tracking quite a bit to assist justification on narrow columns, if the font has a dotless fi ligature, you will get a variety of ligating and non-ligating f_i combinations in text, with an overall appearance of &ldquo;quantum dotting&rdquo;, which is probably not a good idea. Therefore the dotted ligature is to be preferred &ndash; at least this was my reasoning for doing it that way in Worldwide.</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Eben, and also Christopher for his “they’re good if they’re good”, I leave you your definition of beauty because I like things that are not funtional especially in the semiosphere. What are commonly referred to as ligatures are strictly aesthetic forms, most exist to avoid awkward collisions between characters (or text kerned glyph systems as tradition has it that ligatures should  not be used in display type). They have no phonetic or syntactical roles (some editors dislike ‘&amp;’)&mdash;-they are strictly typographic constructs.</p>
<p>Regarding the point whether it is possible to “simply design letters differently to avoid the problems that would have occured” I would say that italics should be set only with the default designed spacing, as for the Roman, I expect old and young type designers to come around to the idea that there are new possiblities in forms but lettering is a precise art and strictly subject to tradition &ndash; you can’t make letters any shape you like, you can’t make houses any shapes you like, unless you live all by yourself on a desert island.</p>
<p>Eben, I am glad I can count you as sympathetic and skeptical, I have my knowledge, my know-how and my physical being as basis, I&rsquo;d like to quote Buckminster Fuller for you, “When I’m working on a problem, I never think about beauty. I think only how to solve the problem. But when I have finished, if the solution is not beautiful, I know it is wrong.”</p>

<p>What REALLY stands out, though, is an fi-lig or fl-lig that is too cramped. How many times have we all seen a word with loose tracking applied but a &ldquo;stands out like a sore thumb&rdquo; auto-inserted fi-lig? Yeesh. That&rsquo;s the real peeve for me.</p>

That goes for f-ligatures, mainly.
The revival of historical ligatures, tho, is a completely different thing. I find ct and st ligatures, as beautiful as they may be, if used in plain body copy very distracting. I think a typographer should have very good reason to use these – because of context, content, etc.–, otherwise leave them on the shelf.</div>

<p>That is only part of it. Granted, it is not a scientific measure used by type desighners but their trained eyes are capable of seeing disruptions in visual pattern that are caused by missfitted neighboring glyphs. They either fix the problem with adjustments to the outlines or with font metrics&ndash;fixed or kerning based.  If this fails, ligatures may be a solution.  I don&rsquo;t think these decisions are based so much on the aaesthetics of the type as they are on what the type designer feels is the function of the type. Anyone can debate if the type designer is successful in fixing problem crashes and holes (people like Kevin may be able to measure the effectiveness in some more concrete way) but I don&rsquo;t think the typical type designer would call his an aesthetic decision.</p>

Experienced type designers have an intuitive grasp of this, or so I think.</p>
<p>Chris&rsquo;s &lsquo;crash and hole&rsquo; create areas of proportionally higher visual salience in areas of the word map, and this disproportion exacts a neural computation cost. The word &lsquo;measure&rsquo; was a bit unfortunate. I meant it in the sense of gauge, or &lsquo;thought of in terms of&rsquo;. I&rsquo;m introducing a set of heuristics that have a perceptual processing signature&ndash;a framework for acting, a system of constructs convenient for gauging efforts and channelling action.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t need a nueralcomputationcostometer to practice mindfulness of computation costs / saliency / cue value in action. Though it might help to have empirical verification of what things have cue value.

<p>You may be right Peter. I really don&rsquo;t know, of course. I am just guessing that this is not a big factor. Reflecting on this again, let me partly retract what I said. I was reacting to the fact that I and other people don&rsquo;t notice the fi crash in Times Roman in MS Word, where they don&rsquo;t have ligatures. There are just millions of documents like this. However, if fi ligatures were all over the place in a language, it would be important. But I wonder if then it might be better just to have no overhanging f.</p>
<p>On the gap at the bottom of a seriffed n. Funny thing, I was just working on that yesterday. I think it has a lot to do with having the &lsquo;n&rsquo; look balanced and even in color within words. I think here the aesthetic and readability considerations largely coincide. The balance and even color give the neutral background against which only the salient features of the n stand out as different and are easily and instantly registered by the eye and brain, without any distraction. Of course, connecting the bottom of the n completely would also change the architecture, so that apprearance would need to be avoided.</p>

The unfolded f, e.g. in Palatino, at left, minimizes the need for ligatures, but is apt to create vertical &ldquo;fingers' (the reverse of &ldquo;rivers&rdquo;) with descenders in the line above.</p>
<p>The strongly terminated f, shown centre and right, is better disambiguated from adjacent descenders, but at the cost of requiring ligatures.</p>
<p>Traditional serifed typography, which did not use extra leading, was and is dependent on type forms where the f ligatures are absolutely essential. One sees this notably in type associated with the Morison years at Monotype, as in his little book on type practice, which is set in a solidly leaded Bembo, if my memory is correct.</p>

<p>The truncated f was done for Linotype, I believe. Monotype I believe had an &lsquo;edge&rsquo; over Linotype in allowing kerning, so they probably made the most of it for that reason among others you point out. You could get ligatures on the Lino keyboard though it seems they were probably more trouble&ndash;perhaps someone knows about this.</p>
<p>Isn&rsquo;t the truncated f common now in sans faces? Why is that, given that there is no problem with kerning and ligatures in digital type?</p>

<p>Firstly, it&rsquo;s easier to design without ligatures.
Also, extra leading is no more work than solid leading, and is the norm (note software defaults). So &ldquo;fingers&rdquo; are a not a problem.</p>

<p>Tradition usually has a lot to do with that sort of thing. Plus Modernism wreaks its usual havoc, seeing as how it prefers sans to begin with. Also note that sans fonts tend to have larger x-heights, making a [relatively] large beak on the &ldquo;f&rdquo; fit fine.</p>

<p>You don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>BTW, the notion that metal type was usually (or even often) set without leading is incorrect (except in newspapers). And if you&rsquo;ve ever set metal type you know why: the lead keeps those little sorts from falling into the bottom line like rotten teeth! The lead physically holds the line together.</p>
<p>But Linotype, different story, since the type was the line itself (besides being limited in other ways compared to &ldquo;foundry&rdquo; -coldmetal- type). And Monotype, being mechanically tighter than human hands, I&rsquo;m guessing could get by without leading as well.</p>

		<div class="commentbody">With regards to metal type, I said &ldquo;extra&rdquo; leading. 
You&rsquo;re right about newspapers. The Linotype, casting quite literally a line of type, made solid leading very practical. Although it&rsquo;s interesting to note that the Linotype manual of 1923 flaunts copious leading throughout.
For tight leading I was thinking of pieces like this Monotype promotion of 1924:

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I&rsquo;ve been &lsquo;lurking&rsquo; in this thread and have learned a lot from so many erudite posts. One thing I&rsquo;ve been wondering, though, is whether this discussion should first be approached from the other end, so to speak.</p>
<p>Before diving into the complexities of how ligatures and other lettershape features affect word image and, ultimately, readability, shouldn&rsquo;t one look into the expectations of people from different cultures and printing traditions?</p>
<p>To me, Patty&rsquo;s comment says it all:</p>
<p><em>I stop short when I see an un-ligatured fi. So yes, I think they improve legibility.</em></p>
<p>My reply would be, &ldquo;Well, yes, but that&rsquo;s because you&rsquo;re a type nut, like the rest of us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>People who have lived their whole lives in places with little or no typographic tradition (like Brazil) are not at all unlikely to never have laid eyes on a &lsquo;standard&rsquo; ligature. Couldn&rsquo;t it be that ligatures cause more of an imbalance to the word image that those people expect to see than so-called &lsquo;crashes&rsquo;? After all, one can only process ligatures without any conscious effort if one is intimately familiar with them. In other words, if all one has seen their whole lives is &lsquo;unsightly&rsquo; collisions between f&rsquo;s and i&rsquo;s, perhaps that&rsquo;s what they expect to see.</p>

<p>I think this idea is a mistake. It&rsquo;s true that familiarity ( culture) has it&rsquo;s effects. Culture is not a minor aspect.  It&rsquo;s a big deal. It is however, just one part of the puzzle. I ( and I suspect most of us here - correct me if I err) think that there is such a thing as better &amp; worse design. I would be willing to bet that a well designed ligature will beat crashing &amp; holes in what ever population you toss it into. And a poorly designed one will not. Assuming you are not stressing the font out with heavy spacing as Will harris ( see above) points out. Also, all the ligatures pairs and triples are different. an fi is not a ct. I would argue that the ct is more significantly an artifact of the chrographic origin of the lower case. It&rsquo;s more vestigal and has less obvious visual utility. Where as the fi ( when it is designed well) has quite alot of visual utility.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t think you err at all; in fact, I probably have a lot more to learn from you than the other way around. I present my case here half hoping that someone will prove me wrong! :-)</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m all for making choices based on what I believe to be &lsquo;better design&rsquo;. I just don&rsquo;t know that I would claim such decisions to be right or wrong in a more absolute, universal sense &ndash; not that I think you&rsquo;re doing that, mind you. In other words, I&rsquo;m open to research that could prove my choices to be wrong.</p>
<p>But even if incontrovertible &lsquo;hard data&rsquo; were to prove, say, that for a certain target audience lining figures make for better readability than text figures, I would still use the latter, especially in extended text. In fact, I think a lot of people do this consciously all the time: if it were proven once and for all that serif faces are more readable than sans-serif ones, or that faces with high contrast and vertical stress are more readable than low-contrast ones with an oblique axis (for a given target audience), Bodoni wouldn&rsquo;t all of a sudden become the most popular face among well-informed designers.</p>
<p>To sum up, I believe in better and worse design; I&rsquo;m just not sure that better design always corresponds to better readability.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Re: <cite> To sum up, I believe in better and worse design; I’m just not sure that better design always corresponds to better legibility. </cite></p>
<p>Your may be right. It isn&rsquo;t clear to me what you mean by better design.</p>
<p>So let&rsquo;s take that apart: I think a design can be said to be good if it does something very specific - very well. But it&rsquo;s really complex.</p>
<p>( BTW- you might want to search Typophile for threads about legibility and readability. They are different too. )</p>
<p>Even just speaking about legibility is complex. Legibility should probably be considered in the context of culture as you pointed out, on what paper, with or accomodating what feeling or style, and at what size, and&hellip;. many more things. With type there are many many many somethings that could be done well and some of the specifics are not compatible.</p>
<p>For instance: Type that works wonderfully well looking just at legibility at 72 point we know does not work well at 9. And vice versa. It would be silly to expect one design to do both.</p>
<p>I suspect when you say good design you might mean good style or maybe beauty. That&rsquo;s complex too. Style by definition has to coexist with other attributes. Some attributes of style like weight or serifs can impact legibility positively or not depending on how they are handeled. But you are certainly right to think that sometimes a design can be beautiful at the expense of legibility. Is that your point? If so, keep in mind that Beauty is not just one relevant measure in some cases - it may be the primary one depending on the purpose of the face or the design in which it is used.</p>
<p>This doesn&rsquo;t mean that there are no generalities that can be noticed and which support legibility. They exist, but in a very provisional or contextual way rather than absolute one.</p>
<p>But coming back to a pervious point of yours (if I understand it). I agree that people who design type don&rsquo;t have nearly enough hard data to work with yet. That may change. And to be sure some of what we do is probably neither helping nor hurting legibility. But that&rsquo;s not necessarily the problem that it may sound like; legibility being just one way to measure the success of a typeface.</p>
<p>But even in our relatively impovrished state (from a hard data point of view); there is quite alot that intuition, cultivated sensitivity, and awareness of context can offer in the persuit of legibilty. Pehaps you will be one those folks who will chew on the data! Or create the data. That would be great!</p>
<p>However I don&rsquo;t think that proof is what will emerge from testing or that &lsquo;proof&rsquo; will help anyone, but rather I hope that testing will illumminate the way that characteristics of type can be traded off against each other to differing and hopefully increasingly deliberate effect. No matter what the test results may show - a prescription for Bodoni ( or any other face ) will never be &lsquo;the right one&rsquo;. But I do think testing may eventualy help us to know more precisely what a type design is likely to be able to do. I put it that way because then there is the question of use. That&rsquo;s a whole additional area!</p>
<p>This is way too long. Sorry about that. I hope it is helpful and not a pain.</p>
<p>Cheers!</p>

<p>I am well aware of the difference. Here the distinction didn&rsquo;t seem important, since no contrast is being made between one and the other. In any event, I&rsquo;ve edited my posts so that the word &lsquo;readability&rsquo; is now used throughout.</p>
<p><em>I suspect when you say good design you might mean good style or maybe beauty. That’s complex too.</em></p>
<p>Hmm&hellip; Not really, no. I mean, designers usually strive for style and beauty, yes, but that shouldn&rsquo;t be their ultimate goal. After all, a designer has a problem to solve: finding the best possible way to communicate a certain message or messages.</p>
<p>But what is the best way to communicate a message? Doing it in such a way that the reader will be able to process the verbal message with maximum efficiency? Or finding the most effective solution to convey a certain mood? Or trying to strike a balance between one and the other? That all depends on the designer&rsquo;s goal, of course: sometimes it&rsquo;s mostly about being as clear and matter-of-fact as possible, sometimes it&rsquo;s mostly about creating a certain atmosphere, sometimes both are important.</p>
<p><em>But even in our relatively impovrished state (from a hard data point of view); there is quite alot that intuition, cultivated sensitivity, and awareness of context can offer in the persuit of legibilty. Pehaps you will be one those folks who will chew on the data! Or create the data. That would be great!</em></p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t believe cultivation and intuition will ever be entirely supported by hard data. My point is that even if research proves your cultivation and intuition to be &lsquo;wrong&rsquo;, I don&rsquo;t think you should give them up. &lsquo;Better design&rsquo; will <em>never</em> be entirely objective, even if you do make a conscious effort to solve a problem rather than just &lsquo;make things pretty&rsquo;. Besides, you can always try to educate the audience a little.</p>
<p><em>This doesn’t mean that there are no generalities that can be noticed and which support legibility. They exist, but in a very provisional or contextual way rather than absolute one.</em></p>
<p>I completely agree. That&rsquo;s why, in my opinion, looking for universally applicable generalizations can be a thankless job. Rather than ask whether ligatures improve legility/readability &ndash; a &lsquo;universal&rsquo; question &ndash; perhaps it would be more to the point to ask whether that is true for, say, French baby boomers that read Le Monde.</p>
<p><em>But I do think testing may eventualy help us to know more precisely what a type design is likely to be able to do.</em></p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re talking about general guidelines, I agree. But not even those general guidelines will be universal; you&rsquo;ll always need to try your design on a focus group if you want to determine how well it works in comparison to something else.</p>
<p>In the end, though, no tradition is absolute and universal, but that doesn&rsquo;t mean you should abandon tradition. It&rsquo;s a little like religion: keep doing it, but never hold it to be a universal truth.</p>
<p>By the way, if anyone thinks all I&rsquo;ve said here is a load of c*** or that I&rsquo;ve disrupted the discussion that was going on without being knowledgeable enough about the subject, feel free to say so.</p>

<p>A Modest Proposal: Let&rsquo;s reserve the terms legibility and readability for base-level experiential judgements about writing and texts (with both language use and typographical formatting being factors in the perception of readability), where they are more at home. Familiarity with the script, facility at visual wordform resolution, adequate discrimination affordances of role architectural particulars and proper saliency of criterial features are (co)operative within these base-level experiential judgements of the typographical component of the readability of texts. Let science isolate, denominate and focus in on them.</p>
<p>Than let&rsquo;s ask more interesting and testable questions like: do serifs, tight spacing and ligatures promote or inhibit visual wordform resolution / promote &lsquo;response bias (to the whole) collapse&quot;?</p>

		<div class="commentbody">In Erik&rsquo;s context, my hypothesis would be ligatures improve, in the nature of the case, the performance of texts set in types that require them because of the structure of the visual cortex and the mechanics of visual wordform resolution. Another example: to be resistant to response bias collapse, unseriffed text requires tighter control of spacing. So be aware of that when you use it. But don&rsquo;t avoid sans serif when it makes aesthetic and journalistic sense to use it. (There are other things to be aware of vis a vis unseriffed faces when used for extended texts.)</div>

<p>Clearly that&rsquo;s true. It&rsquo;s also true that the vast majority of what we find useful in letter design today comes from that source- cultivation and intuition. So we should respect it. That respect needn&rsquo;t suggest a phobia about science or testing of course.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Eric, I&rsquo;m long on hypotheses but short on methodologies. One approach might be to see how the magnitude of the Word Superiority Effect varies with spacing, ligatures in fonts that need them, and style of stroke termination. Another might be to measure the responsiveness of the Visual Word Form Area under conditions of &lsquo;priming&rsquo; with these variations. The best thing would be to develop a criterial test for what I refer to as &lsquo;letter-wise slot processing&rsquo; verses the more direct and supercessionary pattern-based recognition style of visual word-form resolution that I claim emerges when reading becomes fluent.</p>
<p>Eben, 1) I misused and miss-spelled the latin phrase <em>mutatis mutundis</em>, thinking it meant something like &lsquo;in the nature of the case.&rsquo; 2)  Expanding on &lsquo;facility at visual wordform resolution,’ ‘adequate discrimination affordances of role architectural particulars,’ ‘proper saliency of criterial features’ and ‘response bias collapse’:</p>
<p>&lsquo;facility at visual wordform resolution,’
I use this instead of &lsquo;word recognition&rsquo; because the term &lsquo;word recognition&rsquo; doesn&rsquo;t isolate and reference clearly enough the foundational <em>perceptual</em> processing moment&rsquo; of the sense-following mechanisms in reading. It can mislead us into thinking that the interesting and important part of what we are dealing with in reading is mainly a cognitive letter-assembly mechanism.</p>
<p>In my scheme, facility at visual wordform resolution is a learned perceptual skill which develops of its own accord, without conscious effort because of the optical-grammatical structure of writing and, once solidified, proceeds automatically and under the radar of consciousness. It becomes the &lsquo;response bias&rsquo; of the visual system when it is confronted with separated written or printed text. It begins to supercede the letter-wise routine we must master to become skilled readers. The visual binding forces of serifs and rhythmic spacing make breaking the system&rsquo;s learned bias toward a kind of wholistic processing an effort-intensive process neuro-mechanically. These visual binding forces broker or catalyze the perceptual learning that must occur. Bad spacing and the abscence of serifs may make breaking the wholistic respones bias less difficult. They may threaten it, or they may actually privilege a more letter-wise neuro-mechanical routine. When the more letter-wise neuro-mechanical routine is induced or privileged by the typographic realization of the text, I speak of &lsquo;wholistic response bias collapse&quot;.</p>
<p>‘adequate discrimination affordances of role architectural particulars,’ 
Visual wordform resolution requires that the visual system be able to &lsquo;make out&rsquo;&ndash;and the visual cortex register and integrate&ndash;the shapes of visual components of the word at least up to the level of letter parts and counters. My word for letter parts is &lsquo;role architectural particulars&rsquo;; my word for things like counters is &lsquo;role architecturally evoke form&rsquo;. I use them because we need a set of generic terms for things like bowls and stems and shoulders and counters. Because the stems and counters &lsquo;afford&rsquo; or lend themselves to being &lsquo;made out&rsquo; by the visual sytem, I use &lsquo;discrimination affordance&rsquo;. When the lighting is too dim or the contrast with the ground too low, or the type too small for role architectural components to be registered or connected with effectively or made out, the &lsquo;discrimination affordances&rsquo; or &lsquo;discrimination affordance quotients&rsquo; of the font&rsquo;s component letters are inadequate for the condition of use. The discrimination affordances of some fonts are greater at threshlds of size or illumiation or degradation than others.</p>
<p>‘proper saliency of criterial features’ 
Even if the discrimination affordances are optimal for a given condition of use, the type may not perform well, because certain parts of the visual wordform that are perhaps marginal to perceptually resolving it&rsquo;s identity are given too much visual weight by idiosyncracies in the shaping of the letters. The forms have to be balanced against eachother so that all the parts that are collectively important to resolving the perceptual identity of the stimulus have equal visual weight. In these contexts I speak of &lsquo;proper saliency&rsquo; and &lsquo;cue value&rsquo;. And it is important that salient holes and crashes not draw neural processing attention away from areas that are criterial for visual resolution of the identity of the stimulus. This mucks up processing from the retinal receptors up through the visual cortex. Salient here means salient for the visual system <em>at a receptor and neurological level</em>&ndash;not necessarily salient for conscious vision)</p>
<p>‘response bias collapse’
[see above]</p>
<p>Hope this helps!</p>

<p>Don&rsquo;t be cheeky. You know full well that he uses a lot of big words.

I don&rsquo;t mean to ruin your fun, it&rsquo;s just that I haven&rsquo;t studied psychology or neuromechanic processes (whatever that is) so your terminology trips me up.

		<div class="commentbody"><p>&ldquo;Do ligatures improve readability?&rdquo;
So, then there are legibility, readability and usability. Do footnotes improve readability? Do page numbers improve readability? Italics don&rsquo;t but we use them to &ldquo;improve&rdquo; usability by distinguishing emphatic statements or those outside of the main language of a text. At some point, the convenient things, like ligatures, logotypes, numeral variety, style variations and the many other tricks that well-used type one can bring to the table are not as readable as something else might be, but their usability outweighs their faults.</p>
<p>If seen the worst of this by the way, from some of &ldquo;the best typographers in the world&rdquo; not long ago in a published sample of OT features where every single instance of c^t and s^t were ligated in the accompanying text. I wanted to barf, but I eventually got myself to gently point out that, usually these types of ligatures are set repeatedly only in big text, like ad use, or in pull quotes. Otherwise, use should be &ldquo;intelligently&rdquo; sprinkled into text to help the reader off, e.g. as the signal that an end of a ppg. is nigh.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Does this help (as a pre-amble to what I wrote earlier)?</p>
<p>The <em>visual wordform</em> is the totality of stems, counters, ascenders, descenders, bowls and between-letter shapes <em>in their visual relationship</em> or <em>pattern</em>. (I refer to sensitivities to how these elements combine as optical-grammatical attunements)</p>
<p>There are two ways of looking at word recognition in reading. The one says the visual system moves directly from what I have described just now in terms of pattern to the sense or meaning of the word. I call the perceptual process involved in this: visual wordform resolution, and claim it has a neuromechanical component which makes it, all things considered, advantageous. The other says, no the visual system <em>streams</em> stem / bowl / counter / ascender / descender information <em>according to the letters they comprise</em> and from there resolves the identity of the word before linking to meaning. I claim this has a neuromechanical component which makes it, all things considered, counter-indicated.</p>
<p>Then I say visual wordform resolution is a learned mechanism, involving perceptual learning of the pattern, which develops in learning to read. Because the visual wordform resolution process requires a dependance on stems, etc. <em>in their pattern</em> and not the streaming of letter-part information according to letters (&lsquo;slot-processing&rsquo;), a &lsquo;respnse bias&rsquo; of the visual system to that (first) kind of processing, when confronted with word-separated text, develops. (The problems encountered by &lsquo;word-blind&rsquo; (dyslexic) persons demonstrate the <em>consequences</em> of the falure of my &lsquo;learned mechanism&rsquo; to develop.)</p>

<p>Ligatures, where they are necessary to avoid holes and crashes when type is rhythmically spaced enhance the ease of visual wordform resolution. I&rsquo;ve tried to detail what this means and how this might work.</p>
<p>If you prefer to say: ligatures improve readability because they speed up recognition and this is shown by the fact that texts with ligatures are read faster, go ahead. But how much is actually being said? When I ask how this works and why this is so, the term readability doesn&rsquo;t help me to an explanation, and the term recogntion doesn&rsquo;t isolate finely enough where in the process the advantage is acheived. To dig deeper&ndash;to be more informative&ndash;I need to expand my repertoire of terms and extend my knowledge of the percptual and cognitive mechanics. The risk of digging deeper, expanding the repertoire of terms, extending knowledge into &lsquo;subatomic&rsquo; areas, is the perception of making relatively straightforward things seem more complex than necessary.</p>

With the provizo that some faces do need them to look their best and some faces don&rsquo;t depending on the design specifics. So it&rsquo;s isn&rsquo;t just a question of designing them well - it&rsquo;s a question of if they are needed in a design. Actually, putting it that way makes some of Mattew Carter said to me at Typecon about contextual alteration of letterforms make that little bit of extra sense.

<p>Actually let me restate this idea I had to see if you can be on board with it instead.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Some fonts' readbility is enhanced by the presence of well designed ligatures. These fonts posses built in rhythmic and notaic problems with certain letter combinations that are best solved by the use of certain ligatures.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Some fon&rsquo;t don&rsquo;t require or benefit from ligatures because their design is such that the problems that ligatures address are no longer present.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>What do you think Peter?</p>
<p>What I wonder having written that is if the variety of forms in designes that need ligatures is readability enhancing&hellip;. But that would &amp; should be a new thread.</p>

<p>Aha! My point exactly (well, one of them, anyway). There may be better and worse design, but not in a completely objective sense.</p>
<p><em>I also very much like the notion of “usability” David mentioned above.</em></p>
<p>Usability is indeed an interesting topic: as with readability, in my opinion one simply cannot talk about usability without talking about culture and education. Of the myriad variables that affect usability, many have to do with traditions and habits. People learn to use things &ndash; from kitchen knives to computer interfaces &ndash; and not every person in every culture grows accustomed to using the same things in the same manner.</p>
<p>Take a kitchen knife, for instance: most chefs will give high usability ratings to heavy knives with large blades; my wife (who is not a chef) only likes small knives, and her preference has nothing to do with having small hands or not being able to lift a large knife. It&rsquo;s just that she never learned how to properly &ldquo;operate&rdquo; a chef&rsquo;s knife, so to speak.</p>
<p>Someone who can appreciate the refinement of a good ligature will find it aesthetically pleasing in Chris&rsquo;s wedding invitation; someone who&rsquo;s never seen one before may find it strange, especially if the text is large and the ligature is clearly visible.</p>
<p>I have great respect for Peter Enneson, but am not yet convinced that the perceptual processing benefit ligatures may bring to someone is independent from that person&rsquo;s education and culture. Enneson&rsquo;s suggestion that we go deeper and consider not readability as a whole but the different &ldquo;sub-atomic&rdquo; factors that define readability sounds to me a little like discussing how a certain substance can help a brain-dead person because it causes the person&rsquo;s heart to beat. (I am, however, completely open to the possibility that I haven&rsquo;t studied this subject enough to be able to question Enneson properly.)</p>

when Eben asked me my opinion on this topic in an email a few weeks back, i replied that i believed that ligatures are a &ldquo;typographic nicety,&rdquo; but that my views on readability issues tend to follow John Hudson&rsquo;s ideas about the ability of readers to adapt. i think &ldquo;ligatures do (or do not) improve readability&rdquo; is tough to argue, because it&rsquo;s all about specifics. there are so many variables that may or may not improve readability that it&rsquo;s probably next to impossible to isolate them to measure them: serif vs sans, leading values, spacing issues, x-height, point size, medium, &amp;c. &amp;c. all this talk about readability might possibly be a red herring which detracts from the amazing ability of the reader to adapt to a wide range of reading environments.</div>

<p>Sorry, I don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s so obvious. I do indeed think that someone could be happy eating just that &ndash; if he never ate anything else, and especially if everyone else were eating it. He might come to be repulsed by apples, or peanuts, or Doritos.</p>
<p>(The &ldquo;healthy&rdquo; part isn&rsquo;t comparable, since there&rsquo;s essentially no chance of anyone becoming unhealthy from ligatures.)</p>
<p>I think people, throughout history, have adapted to horrific conditions and considered themselves happy&hellip; which begs the question: If everyone is happy, who&rsquo;s to say it&rsquo;s horrific? Yikes, can we just talk about the Big Bang or evolution or something instead?</p>

<p>Maybe on another site. This site is about type! ;-)</p>
<p>I may agree that the analogies can get pretty fruity at times here. But I think we are all doing our best even if that doesn&rsquo;t always seem good enough to some of us some of the time. You all have my respect &amp; thanks for considering this issue, debating this with me &amp; educating me in the process!</p>
<p>I do think that a careful reading of this thread shows that ligatures are not just a typographic nicety in all cases. Sometimes, but in fact - rarely. Sometimes they really do seem to improve a design ( even though nobody can PROOVE it ). Sometimes they seem to get in the way ( even though nobody can PROOVE it ). And sometime they don&rsquo;t seem to do much at all. They seem vitrually neutral, not improving nor detracting from a design. In which case we can call them a &lsquo;typographic nicety&rsquo; ( even though nobody can PROOVE it ). I think this case is the unusual one however - and I cannot proove it).</p>
<p>Another way of looking at it, and this was the way I was looking at it when Tiffany made her point before - is that when a ligature does work well it&rsquo;s working because it isn&rsquo;t drawing attention to itself and it is working neither better nor worse than the glyphs around it. It&rsquo;s not distictive from a readability point of view from the glyphs around it. So it might be said to be average in some sense except for it&rsquo;s exotic connection &amp; hence a &lsquo;typographic nicety&rsquo;.</p>
<p>John Hudson&rsquo;s point about the profound power of the reader is of course an excellent one. But I don&rsquo;t think that it obsolves the type designer of the responsibility to be interested in incremental improvement and of being curious about how that improvement might be achieved. For the record, I am not admonishing anyone just stating my point of view.</p>
<p>I will also readily admit that the topic name I chose for this thread was as usual pretty naive!</p>
<p><cite> might possibly be a red herring which detracts&hellip;</cite></p>
<p>I do agree that the specific examples that people brought up showing relative success &amp; failure in specific cases were by far the most useful things in the thread.</p>

<p>Hrant, you should know that i do my own thinking. C&rsquo;mon, give me some credit. just because i put more stock in readerability doesn&rsquo;t mean that i think making typefaces that are readable is futile. just because i CAN read fuzzy on-screen type or smudgy type or type spit out by Microsoft Office doesn&rsquo;t mean that that&rsquo;s what i&rsquo;m most comfortable reading. It&rsquo;s hard for me to make any judgements about readability because, as far as i know, there is not much reliable research on the subject. (if there is, please enlighten me as to what i should be reading) What troubles me most when reading threads like these is that everyone has their own theories, but how would anyone go about proving or disproving them, which leads me to:

<p>Absolutely. We had a similar discussion on the ATypI list recently, and if you don&rsquo;t mind the cross-posting, I think part of the discussion fits here perfectly. I remarked that &ldquo;I believe graphic and type designers can learn quite a bit from complex systems theory, aka chaos theory.&rdquo;</p>
<p>David Berlow&rsquo;s reply (hope he doesn&rsquo;t mind my quoting him here) was: &ldquo;What is/are the initial condition(s)?&rdquo;</p>
<p>And this was my subsequent post:</p>
<dl><dd>And can you control all initial conditions so that they're all exactly the same (except for the one you're trying to test) every single time? In our specific case here, "hardly" is probably the answer, especially if we're trying to arrive at absolute laws of legibility.</dd>
<dd>But if we reduce the number of variables by dealing with one specific target audience (one culture, a limited age range etc) and one medium, then I believe that a well designed experiment can make a whole lot of difference to a design process. You're not looking for a single universal "objective" truth -- an immutable law -- but merely trying to determine how this or that design will work for a given target audience, <em>on average</em>.</dd></dl>
<p>As Paul Hunt pointed out, a very large number of variables would be involved in a purely objective analysis of whether or not ligatures contribute to legibility/readability, especially if the goal is to arrive at absolute laws that apply to the whole human race. And right now not enough research has been conducted to warrant definite conclusions as to whether ligatures help the human brain process printed text more efficiently/effectively.</p>
<p>So what? Does this mean typographers should stop using ligatures, or not trust their instincts? I don&rsquo;t think so. Perhaps what we can do is have a healthy scepticism (not paranoia, though) of our intuition and every now and then check if a specific design works for its target audience.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Eben, all:</p>
<p>After reading Will Harris' short piece I have decided he&rsquo;s definitely over-simplifying and many of his examples are poor and lack real merit. (Maybe I&rsquo;m over-simplifying too.)</p>
<p>His point about the odd shape made by the fl ligature in a few of his examples is good, however, and I&rsquo;ve noticed this myself before. I&rsquo;ve even not used the fl ligature on occasion because it does create an h-like shape.</p>
<p>One flaw, I think in what he is saying are in his examples. He&rsquo;s basically using what can be seen as display settings. But the usability of a ligature is in text settings and for small point sizes so what he is showing us doesn&rsquo;t wash with me. I&rsquo;d rather see a paragraph at a reader&rsquo;s point size and then form my own opinion. OF COURSE, the ligature might call too much attention to itself at dispaly sizes, duh!</p>
<p>If the letters don&rsquo;t &ldquo;crash,&rdquo; to use his word, then perhaps that is when ligatures aren&rsquo;t needed. I agree with this. But again, his samples, only in a few instances, really prove his point. The Caflisch sample, for instance, I think, is better for the ligature as the tittle creates visual noise, display or text, which needs to be taken care of.</p>
<p>In some cases, for text setting (and maybe display), where the tittle doesn&rsquo;t crash, I wonder aloud if the ligature doesn&rsquo;t simply remove a bit of data that we simply don&rsquo;t need because we recognize the letter pairing without it.</p>
<p>I feel out of my league with the rest of you, but this is a great thread.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>i put more stock in readerability</p>

<p>More stock than in what? A gentle improvement in readability thanks to the (<cite>judicious</cite>, please) use of ligation? Well I do too. But I put even more stock in lamb kebab, and that doesn&rsquo;t stop me from addressing readerability.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>doesn’t mean that i think making typefaces that are readable is futile.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Not readable; that&rsquo;s easy (exactly because of readerability). <cite>More</cite> readable; that&rsquo;s hard. That&rsquo;s what makes most people run away, but some not before using readerability as a smoke screen.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>there is not much reliable research</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Agreed.
This however does not absolve people from considering the evidence that <cite>is</cite> out there, and most of all from <cite>thinking</cite>. The Ancient Greeks figured out tons with sticks and ropes. Now we paralize real progress with our addiction to Proof, afraid to think deeply and try to dig out of this Empirical prison.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What troubles me most when reading threads like
these is that everyone has their own theories</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What&rsquo;s even worse is these theories tend to be self-serving, and furthermore there is little overall desire to actually listen to something new. It becomes an excuse to listen to yourself.</p>
<p>This realization is why I no longer fully participate in threads like this, and I get short-tempered when some people go on and on without the will to actually learn anything, at least not something that would alter their approach to type design (because to them it&rsquo;s too close to Art, something that should -rightly however- be excluded from empiricism). Don&rsquo;t get me wrong, Typophile is better than anything else out there, but -even after all these years of trying- it still doesn&rsquo;t seem good enough for more than possibly sparking an interest among the truly curious, the true craftsmen. Eben, Peter, they are very rare exceptions.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>hope he doesn’t mind my quoting him here</p>

<p>He might not, but since the ATypI list isn&rsquo;t a
public one, it&rsquo;s inadvisable without permission.</p>

<p>David, I like the angle: &ldquo;And ligatures are not there to speed reading up, they are there to prevent reading from slowing down.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In research on reading, speed is often the measure. This should not trick us into thinking of it as an end.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>It seems to me that speed can never be ignored. I can see a very clear distinction between efficiency (speed at which letter shapes/word forms/word clusters are correctly recognized) and efficacy (speed at which comprehension occurs), but speed is a component of both.</p>
<p>Complex as research on reading efficiency may be, it&rsquo;s probably child&rsquo;s play compared to research on reading efficacy. After all, comprehension quickly leaves the realm of visual processing and enters a nebulous domain populated by variables such as intelligence (or intelligences), attention span, education, culture, cognitive strategies, length and complexity of sentences, and so on.</p>
<p>If I take myself as an example, I&rsquo;m well educated by most common standards, score above average on traditional IQ tests and exams, am a very efficient reader, but not a very efficacious one in that I read rather slowly when I need to actually comprehend a text. I suppose I&rsquo;m not very good at concentrating and need to re-read some passages, especially when the writing is convoluted and when there are many levels of nested structures in a sentence. Could typography improve my reading efficacy? I really don&rsquo;t know.</p>

		<div class="commentbody">Erik, until there is really complex sophiticated research done you have every right to be skeptical. But I am guessing that yes, type is a variable &amp; that your speed and comprehension will be different in different types and obviously with different typography - line spacing etc. Experientially - that is my subjective experience &amp; I basically trust it. Of the two it&rsquo;s the arrangment of type on the page and the line spacing etc that matters most but yes, I think the forms are important too.</div>

David, sorry if I am over-interpreting your words here but this is what I am getting from them: Ligatures don&rsquo;t cause speed to increase - they avoid slowing the reading speed permitted by the overall design. It &rsquo;s the overall design that creates the potential for speed. In the same way that a well made road allows greater speeds to be driven safely - a well made font ( &amp; ligature if needed) does not cause speed but makes it potentially avaiable. A well made ligature if it&rsquo;s needed is like a potential fault removed from the road. Not so much a feature as a problem avoided.</div>

<p>Perhaps it&rsquo;s unclear where I was heading with this.</p>
<p>I have to be cryptic, because for now I&rsquo;ve overextended myself on Typophile and must attent to other things.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m positing: &ldquo;sustainability of immersion with effective engagement and good comprehension&rdquo; as the overall goal of efforts to improve reading performance and readability. I could also say: sustainability of sense following over time and text-extent relative to the varient conditions of reading.</p>
<p>In cognitive processing terms, with extended texts, there can be a too fast and a too slow, and this relates to the capacities of short term memory and the integration of it&rsquo;s contents into one&rsquo;s &lsquo;world&rsquo;. The speed at which a balance of comprehension and holding on to the thread of narrative or argument is &lsquo;found&rsquo; (or occurs) in practiced readers who don&rsquo;t suffer from reading disorders varies, but hovers about a mean.</p>
<p>Type plays it&rsquo;s role in enhancing the sustainability of this sense-following by not placing &lsquo;maintaining it&rsquo; at risk for reasons of perceptual processing fatique or expense of neural effort in overcoming neural-attentional diversion, which holes and crashes do.

<p>Yes, that&rsquo;s exactly what I meant. Obviously, in order to comprehend a text one first needs to be able to recognize the bits that make it up, namely letter shapes and word forms. I have no doubt that good typography can make a world of difference in this process.</p>
<p>When it comes to making sense of all the printed words that have already been decoded, however, I&rsquo;m not quite sure how good typography helps, even if I suspect that it does. Perhaps Hrant et al are right: it&rsquo;s all a matter of comfort. The more comfortable the reading, the longer one can read and the more energy one can devote to interpreting meaning (since less energy is expended in recognizing glyphs and words).</p>
<p>When I read something long on a computer screen, I start getting restless because of discomfort and this may cause me to pay less attention to the text, even if I have no trouble making out letters and words.</p>

I don&rsquo;t have to care about much other than enough light. With a computer, there is more fixed than free and more conditions to meet.  I just don&rsquo;t like reading anything long on screen. Maybe it is just the human need to fidget :-)</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not compartmentalizing idly. In order to answer the question originally posed, ligatures had first to be defined as &ldquo;required&rdquo;, and then re-compartmented with other typography used in the interest of defeating distraction while assisting comprehend-ability. I will never use &ldquo;speed&rdquo; again: Ligatures don’t cause comprehend-ability to increase - they avoid retarding it.</p>
<p>They are not alone, A-Z, Dotless-i, $, -, and more, are used in the same overallness, or something. I&rsquo;m hoping, that Hrant&rsquo;s point is — from the first line of the first letter of the letter drawing,  to the last minute detail of the last detail of the composition is the &ldquo;all&rdquo;, and any disturbance of the all is as good as many disturbances?</p>

It&rsquo;s more lucid &amp; less baggage laden. I would amend this further in this way: &lsquo;Well designed ligatures included in typefaces in those cases where they are actually needed don’t cause comprehend-ability to increase - they avoid retarding it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>To get past Hrant&rsquo;s objection that you are creating a model of reading with the statement you might offer the corrolary that &lsquo;In those typefaces that need ligatures you would see comprehend-ability to increase when well designed ligatures are included.&quot;</p>
<p><cite> and any disturbance of the all is as good as many disturbances? </cite>
I am sure you meant something by this but I think the langauage actually written can&rsquo;t get me closer to what you meant. I would be willing to say that any distubance of the &lsquo;all&rsquo; is relevant. Is that what you meant? Hrant, was this all on the page in your mind or does it include the possible sound of a child in the room?</p>
<p><cite> read at some sort of maximum </cite></p>
<p>I think you are absolutely right to insist on avoiding that &lsquo;model&rsquo; of reading.</p>
<p>I think what I was getting at is that any design ( for anything ) has a built in &lsquo;maximal&rsquo; potential use ( defined in whatever way you like ) but that that maximum is just potential. It doesn&rsquo;t mean that it is desirable to reach per se, or even &lsquo;reach for&rsquo; in real life use. That also does not deny that achieving certain testable maximums might not enhance comfort. But your main point if I get you, I agree with - a test ( even a theoretical one) is not a valid theoretical model of reading in itself.</p>

<p>So as far as I can tell I don&rsquo;t disagree with you on that.</p>
<p>So; far from advocating one particular way of slicing this - my point had to do with the unusualy contingent or accutely provisional context in which ligatures are designed. That being, ligatures may be needed: badly, a little, or not at all. In contrast, an &lsquo;A&rsquo; or &lsquo;a&rsquo; of some kind is always needed. And ligatures themselves are suited to their font&rsquo;s actual needs (or not) by degrees. Even though I liked David&rsquo;s axiom very much in some ways - these factors seemed left out of it.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the problem with saying something pithy &amp; axionmatic about ligatures. All the factors count and there are almost too many of them.</p>

<p>Ah, but here&rsquo;s the -or actually just one- rub:
A text font, especially a bookish one, is itself not well-designed (for example I might predict that the &ldquo;f&rdquo; is too shy, or that the spacing is too loose) if it doesn&rsquo;t need ligatures! It might be a necessary &ldquo;technical&rdquo; compromise, but that makes it not &ldquo;maximal&rdquo; as this line of reasoning assumes.</p>
<p>&ndash;</p>
<p>Eben, knowing your &ldquo;plans&rdquo; for ligature integration, I don&rsquo;t understand how you can be so cavalier about accepting &ldquo;negativist&rdquo; opinions about them.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p><cite> if it doesn’t need ligatures! </cite> I think the point I was making is separate because I was thinking ( assumptions at work - look out! ) of display &amp; text at that time where as you are always in text mode. ;-) Also that phrase does not include references to maximality per se -just to improvement.</p>
<p>But to address your point, if I get you: I have not firmly concluded that what your saying about text faces is utterly true. But my very strong suspicion is that in spirit what you are is quite correct. Partly it&rsquo;s because I know I have alot more looking and study to do before I could possibly have seen for myself that this is so. But in addition to that I am still keen on the idea that ligatures are just one kind of contextual alteration that could be applied to improve text faces.</p>
<p>They are the most obvious because they seem to break the &lsquo;rule&rsquo; that glyphs don&rsquo;t touch in Latin. They might also be the most gross in terms of the size or scope of the alteration. I have not assembled a good list of contextual alterations yet so again, I am working on it.</p>
<p>But again, given the options of ligatures ( or no ) in a text face with and assuming the options we are conventionally aware of, I think I would simply agree. That partly because I think ligatures achieve a better notanic relationship than the design solutions created to avoid needling ligatures do.</p>
<p>I am also starting to characterise what I think is going on there - I think ligatures offer a richer or more complex notanic relationship, and that is maybe one of the reasons they are valuable to a text face.</p>
<p>But in terms of my own theory with specific emphasis on text faces; the ideas fighting for equity in my mind now are wheather the ligature is perhaps great but flawed approach. Maybe in a &lsquo;perfect&rsquo; font a ligature is a little too inflexible a solution. Maybe ligatures are a kind of protrotype alteration that hints at a better way.</p>
<p>The rival idea is that ligatures are just one of a broader range of partially undiscovered/documented pro-notanic alterations that are possible the &lsquo;rightness&rsquo; of which are purely need/context based. As of today the later idea is winning.</p>
<p>The underlying question that separates these two ideas the degree to which a type designer can ever hope to control the way in which the face is used. Obviously there are lots of instances in which fonts are basically abused. But in general there is a trend towards font awareness and appreciation, care, respect, etc. And in the case of a special, perhaps bespoke face for immersive reading, [ Hi Tiff! there&rsquo;s your word ;-) ] maybe the type designer could start to expand their influence to issues of leading, word space &amp; so on. In the case where the type designer succeeds in that the place of ligatures is stronger. If you are designing with robustness or &lsquo;abuse resistance&rsquo; in mind this is less true.</p>
<p>Anyway, thats the way the shades of grey are swirling for me at this time.</p>

<p>Ligatures are I think in principle a liability for reading in a separated script like latin script. However, the overhanging f is a nice differentiating feature in seriffed faces. It is enough of a plus that when you subtract out the slight negativity of introducting ligatures to avoid crashes, it still comes out a plus. So ligatures are a kind of compromise that is overall beneficial, but a compromise none the less.</p>
<p>So f-ligatures, good. Other ligatures (st, ct etc.) bad in text as they are not necessary to compensate for problem crashes. Of course, in display you can have Zapfino or whatever, but that is a horse of a different color.</p>

<p>At the time they were invented  the st ligature made sense of course because it was for the long s we no longer use. People probably had afffection or familarity for the form for a long time so it lingered beyond the point of visual utility - because it had been made into a cultural-visual cue. But then the eye prevailed.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t have a similar idea about the ct. Does it stem from a blackletter utility perhaps?</p>

This is just an unfortunate mix of terms. :) 
Ligatures are in principle a liability for reading in separated styles of the latin script. 
Making room for, absence of ligatures being a liability for reading in ligated styles (connecting scripts), of the latin script, as such absences can be mistaken for a space, or make connections ungainly.</div>

<p>Oh?  I believe for each instance of use, there is a prefab set of discrete parts that may be composed and read at a maximum, for a given audience, with range of audience maxima enabled by dynamic control over some of the discrete parts. This is true 4 humans as we do use morse code if that is the perfect set of discrete parts that may be read at a maximum for a given audience. For most uses, however, it is so low in the &ldquo;tone of voice&rdquo; department, we use at least Arial.

<p>Latin is only a &ldquo;separated&rdquo; script formally. That&rsquo;s fine for teaching it, not fine (and not real) for reading it. Not using ligatures is what&rsquo;s a[n arbitrary] compromise. Even an &ldquo;r&rdquo; touching a &ldquo;y&rdquo; is a ligature, and that&rsquo;s a common, conscious, pragmatically intelligent &ldquo;compromise&rdquo;.

<p>BTW. I was noticing some thin ct &amp; st ligatures the other day. They were not so thin as to appear anemic but at the same time they were far less obtrusive than most of the others I have seen. I thought, I could read that. This loooks RIGHT. That would be pretty comfortable! I could live with that. Now who&rsquo;s font was it&hellip; I&rsquo;d love to post an example. I will if I see it again. I think I found it on Flickr somehow. But the point is it really brought it home to me that the nominal combination for a given ligature isn&rsquo;t destiny/fate and there really is room left in which to take things further.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p><cite> contextually sensitive ligation , cursive etc.</cite></p>
<p>Here is what I was getting at:  Let&rsquo;s take the Wy design Nick showed us a while back. ( I tried to dig it up to link to &amp; failed. Sorry. ) He could have made a ligature but he didn&rsquo;t. He made contextual alteration where the h has a shorter serif on the left side so it sits with the Cap w nicely. Did you see it? If he had made a ligature it would have been designed with the assumption that you have a certain range of letter spacing &amp; no more. It&rsquo;s not utterly brittle kind of thing - but compared to non-ligating letter designs, ligatures are more brittle. By brittle I mean when failure does occur - it&rsquo;s BAD and quite obvious. In contrast, contextual alteration permits far more letterspacing before letterspacing causes a failure of equivalent severity and that failure is probably near the point of failure for the type face as a whole. So non-ligating contextual alteration might have a benfit that trumps ligatures.* If so, it would be yet another reason to dig into it with gusto! :-)</p>
<p>But now I will undermine that arguement a little. The subtlety of very high quality notanic interaction of glyphs probably also depends on letterspacing not getting out of hand. The ratios of tollerance before the &lsquo;point&rsquo; of the design is lost maybe nearly identical to that of ligatures. So, if the point of the design is to be finely tuned and optimized it may be that the kind of robustness I had been talking about is not relevant to contextual alteration for text faces.</p>
<p>On the other hand it might well be that each case has it&rsquo;s own dynamics and it&rsquo;s a very mixed situation. That&rsquo;s why I am keen to collect lots of samples and watch what&rsquo;s happening. But every experiment needs a hypothesis or two! ;-)</p>
<ul>
<li>Hrant of course, argues that any near-ideal text face will need ligatures and so the point of avoiding them is mute anyway.</li>
</ul>
<p>In thinking about differences between what I am after &amp; cursive or Arabic I am kind of knocked out by the enormity of the question. I don&rsquo;t know how much letterspacing if any is acceptable in Arabic fonts. That would be something I would need to know. I can imagine there is a little bit but I bet that in that case &amp; in the case of scripts there is a built in brittleness of a different kind than you would see in a face with only occasional connections. How is that for a start? Maybe you have a different point to make. Do you?</p>

<p>Unless you look at it from a notanic perspective instead of a black one, and realize that, in the end, non-touching contextual alternates are just another way to ligate. That&rsquo;s why Legato is called Legato btw.</p>

<p>Reversing the black-white assumptions here as well, I would propose that the Arabic kasheeda (the extension of the horizontal line, usually to help justify a line, although quite often for aesthetics) is on some level equivalent to Latin letterspacing.</p>

<p>I don’t know how much letterspacing if any is acceptable in Arabic fonts.
<a href="http://typophile.com/node/19609">Arabic writing</a> is cursive (linked). That means that the same character has up to 4 different graphic forms, according to whether it is linked with the previous character, with the following character, with both, or with no other character.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As in Roman text, and depending on each font, Arabic consonants can form «ligatures». In a manner analogous to what happens when you write «œ» instead of a separate «o» and «e», 2 or 3 Arabic consonants can merge into one synthetic glyph with its own length, four position-representations, and kerning behaviour.</p>
<p>Since Arabic characters are linked together, you can’t change the letterspacing (also known as positive tracking) simply by adding short spaces between characters as in Roman text: the links would display as non-continuous ones. In this case, short pieces of link (called kashidas) between Arabic characters are automatically inserted. In other words: there are 2 ways of performing full justification in Arabic: either by magnifying the spaces between words as in Roman, or by automatically adding small kashidas after each linked character to make the words longer.</p>
<p>In addition to letterspacing and automatic kashida, there exist 2 other means of modifying the horizontal size of a word:
• Adjusting the width of characters
• Entering a manual kashida-character from keyboard, as you would do when using primitive word-processors.</p>
<p>In general, using the automatic kashida settings is a far better solution: after a text-reformating, if some kashidas become unnecessary, elastic style-kashidas will automatically disappear, while keyboard kashidas will have to be removed manually.</p>
<p><a href="http://typophile.com/node/19348">My font</a> has the additional feature of making Calligraphic full-justification with the help of prolonged overlapping swashed final forms.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I do find Nick Shinn&rsquo;s idea of contextual adjustment of characters&ndash;instead of just kerning&ndash;intriguing. Nick may have already implemented this in a font&ndash;he will tell us, I hope.</p>
<p>Aziz&rsquo;s reference to the kashida in Arabic script is also apt and interesting. In Hebrew also, in spite of the fact that it is a separated script (even in cursive), traditionally scribes would extend letters to fill out lines. In latin script, written with lower case, scribes, if I remember correctly, would fill out the line by extended swash terminals, rather than by stretching a character.</p>
<p>The reason for the difference in scribal practice, I think, is a difference in structure of the glyphs. In Arabic and Hebrew the horizontals are thick and the verticals thin&ndash;the reverse of latin characters. The horizontals also play a much more prominent role.</p>
<p>If you consider the latin lower case, there are no pure horizontals. The f and t cross bars are paired with arches, and the e cross bar is connected with a circle. The r could be a candidate also, but it is a partial arch also.</p>
<p>As opposed to the latin lower case, the resh in Hebrew has a single straight, thick stroke to the left&ndash;and it typically is a glyph stretched to fill out a line for justification. For this reason, I am a bit skeptical about how much contextual alteration in the lower case can be done. Of course I think Nick is suggesting subtile changes to help color, so this might lead to improvements, even if small ones.</p>
<p>Currently what comes closest to kashidas for latin script is the stretching or squashing of the whole character by up to 2% to justify a line&ndash;a capacity of InDesign.</p>
<p>The latin caps are a different story, as you have the &lsquo;H-LEFT&rsquo; which have pure horizontals. And here I think there is more opportunity of contextual alterations, eg of the L in the LA combination. Similarly, you could shorten one or both arms of the T in the Th combination, which is common in English.</p>

<p>He said that he had when he showed us the example here on typophile. Did you not see that? Can anybody point me to it. For some reason I can&rsquo;t find it&hellip;. But I am glad that you see that the idea holds some potential! It seems to me that the greatest potential for improvement in type design today lays down that path.</p>
<p><cite> For this reason, I am a bit skeptical about how much contextual alteration in the lower case can be done </cite> - William</p>
<p>It seems like the wy might be one place to look&hellip; But that&rsquo;s  <a href= http://typophile.com/node/29362>another thread</a>. However, I absolutely agree with you that the characteristics of the letters themselves must color the ways in which alteration can be accomplished. But that also shows why there will be variety. The forms have a huge range of variety. So while we could probably develop semi-predictive theory about where to check for opportunity for successful alteration based on inherent structural chacteristics I am more interested in looking for examples and then analysing what I have for patterns later on. The human eye &amp; mind are pretty wonderfully adaptive. I have a feeling that like the L example on the <a href= http://typophile.com/node/29362>other thread</a> we will find that style &amp; a host of factors and circumstances that make it possible to adjust letters in a myriad of surprising &amp; delightful ways.</p>
<p>So, if you see examples of pro-color or pro-notanic adjustment would you point me or send the examples?  I am starting a collection which I will share for free; (I hope) via a searchable database driven web site. Unless of course, there are so few that that is overkill. But we shall see. My best guess is that there will be a TON.</p>
<p><cite>kashidas</cite> - Aziz</p>
<p>Aziz, thank you for explaining about arabic connections &amp; kashidas. I was wondering, have you ever seen an arabic typeface that has extended connections so the overlap is exagerated? I have an idea that doing that would maybe allow for some additional spacing without using kashidas. Maybe this is naive. What reasons might there be for avoiding that solution?</p>
<p>I was thinking that for searchable text you would maybe not want to have kashidas present. Of course you could (maybe) write your search engine so that it tosses kashidas out&hellip; Do you see what I am getting at? Are kashidas used very much or is it something that is rare?</p>
<p><cite> That’s why Legato is called Legato btw. </cite> - Hrant</p>
<p>You mean a the non-litteral definition
legato
adj : (music) without breaks between notes; smooth and connected;
&ldquo;a legato passage&rdquo; [syn: smooth] [ant: staccato]
adv : connecting the notes; in music; &ldquo;play this legato, please&rdquo;
[ant: staccato]</p>
<p>Yes, okay. I remember reading that on Evert&rsquo;s site. (I wonder if it&rsquo;s still in the google cache ) But do you see the distictions I was getting at? I am not sure that the distictions I was making preclude agreeing with you that contextual alterations are <cite>just another way to ligate</cite>. I have said &amp; will say again that what we recognise as ligatures are in fact just a subset of solutions to a given problem whose disproportionate mental prominance can only be explained by our thrill in observing the  obvious &lsquo;rule breaking&rsquo; they engage in. <strong>Ooooh! They touch!</strong> Still, it this disproportionately emphasized visual distinction does also have a practical/fuctional impact re: letterspacing that raises it&rsquo;s own questions. I don&rsquo;t see the conflict or contradiction there. I would like it if you addressed them more specifically! And if the two ideas are somehow opposed, please explain why that is.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Greetings to All,</p>
<p>This is a very interesting discussion.  I am not a typophile, but I am a great admirer of functional and timeless beauty; qualities that most typefaces certainly possess.  By circumstances beyond my control, I have been pressed into typographical service to publish some technical papers for my company.  As a result, I have been doing a little research into readability, legibility and comprehension (which in my newbie ignorance I have determined to be seperate, but overlapping issues).  I am not, nor will I ever be, a professional typophile, but I have read all of my life (end user alert! talk slow and use small words!).  Now you have all of the information to studiously ignore my uninformed opinions as you wish (I have been married 32 years; plenty of practice having my opinions ignored).</p>
<p>I said all of that to say this.  Since I have read just about anything printed, I have been exposed to many fonts and typefaces with and without ligatures.  The one thing I have noticed is that when the flow of my reading is interrupted because I perceive a hitch in spacing in the word structure, one of the reasons (there are others) is because of both the absence and presence of ligatures.  This bump in the reading flow can occur for me at even small point sizes (8).  The factors that come into play for me are:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>If a ligature is present and I bump over it in text, it is usually because the ligature looks cumbersome; the font does not lend itself well to construction of proper ligatures or the ligature structure was poorly implemented in that particular font.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The opposite is also true; if a ligature is absent and I notice it, the font could probably benefit from a well constructed ligature or better general construction.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>These are just an amateur&rsquo;s opinions; ligatures make reading for me better when they fit well with the font and make it worse when they don&rsquo;t and the opposite is also true.  This kind of reminds me of the Ford vs Chevy discussions that we have here at work (warning! lowbrow content!).  They both have strengths and weaknesses, but both must be used for what they are best suited and that is ususally strictly in the eye of the beholder (or the end user).</p>
<p>Thanks for listening.</p>
<p>All the Best,
John</p>
<p>P.S. - I have started using the font Baramond which, I believe is derived from Garamond Antigua.  The implemention of ligatures in this font I find pleasing.</p>
