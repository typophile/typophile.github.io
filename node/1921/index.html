		<div class="commentbody">Luxury is a funny concept, and it is aptly priced for what it stands for.

		<div class="commentbody">Keith, maybe I am thinking the wrong way about this, but it seems to me only fashion advertisers will want to use 'Luxury', and they will have the money and want the exclusivity. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->But with Trinite, an amazing text face, the whole world might want it, like Times New Roman. By the way, Lexicon, which TEFF compares to Times New Roman as far as versatility, and which Tiffany wants, is also priced similarly in the stratosphere.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->If TEFF could sell thousands more of Lexicon or Trinite by lowering the price, it would make sense to do so. (Of course I don't actually know the 'price elasticity,' as the economists put it, for these typefaces.) For 'Luxury,' as a display face with a wonderful but very limited appeal, you're not going to sell thousands anyway. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The rational basis for pricing is not the work that goes into it, but what will gross the most for the product given the market. Of course that might influence your willingness to do the work in the first place&hellip;</div>

		<div class="commentbody">William, if you can sell one font family license for $3000 rather than seven font family licenses for $400 each, why would you consider this bad marketing, especially if the service overhead for each license is the same? Given the extent of font piracy in the larger market, there is something to be said for high prices and a limited market: among other things, you can be pretty certain that TEFF has a very different relationship with its customers than Adobe has. Likewise Gerard Unger, and also some American type designers such as Sumner Stone. Interesting to note that Sumner used to work for Adobe, so he knows both sides of the font pricing question. If you buy a font from the Stone Foundry, you not only pay a lot more than you would for an Adobe font, you also have to <!-- raw HTML omitted -->sign<!-- raw HTML omitted --> a license contract. Such things reinforce the value of what is being purchased. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I don't think either approach is <!-- raw HTML omitted -->bad<!-- raw HTML omitted --> marketing. They are different approaches to different markets. There are people who are willing to pay a premium for quality fonts and who understand that one of the things they are paying for is relative exclusivity: they want fonts that not every Tom, Dick and Harriet graphic designer has on his or her hard drive. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Are you saying that it is bad marketing for Emiglio Zegna to price their clothes so that the Walmart shoppers can't afford them? <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->And how do you measure the success of a small foundry like TEFF? Peter Matthias and his colleagues feed, clothe and house themselves and their families. Is it also necessary for a small foundry to become a big foundry?

(I am talking about the ALDO logo not the flash animation, which I guess has some light Helvetica.)  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->John, I agree that both approaches can make sense, or not. It just depends on the market - or, to use economists language, on the price elasticity for the good in question.   <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I also can easily believe an alternative theory: that the TEFF and DTL people make their livelihood mainly from teaching and commissioned work, and that the foundries are sidelines. And that they are too busy with other stuff to market properly.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->(Evidence: DTL has been promising that van Krimpen's Romulus, which I adore, would be out in three months, for about three years. The current 'deadline' is August 2003; it has been changed four times, I think.

And I learned from a similar discussion on Typographica that eg. different car models price for different niches. But I am saying that the evidence makes me question whether charging ten times more really is an economic benefit to them.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->In this thread people are questioning Christian Schwartz's decision on 'Luxury', and defending DTL and TEFF.

The Luxury Collection is our attempt to comment on the fact that the multitude of high-fashion logos can be boiled down into three fonts. &quot;fashionable&quot; things look a very specific way, and consumers allow them to be priced accordingly. we were hoping the ridiculous price would clue people in on the fact that the set is a joke. (the thought of someone paying $1500 for these three fonts, now that's funny!)  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->is there a place for social commentary and satire in type design? is the idea of a type family as conceptual art too much of a stretch? or is the problem that we were too straight-faced with our execution? because in this case, i think the attitude IS the function. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->in any case, we were planning for this set to be more of a publicity stunt than a product that sold a whole lot of copies. and it looks like that part, at least, is working out pretty well.&lt;!-/quote-!&gt;<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --></div>
