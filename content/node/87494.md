body: "Sorry, desperately posting here. We recently enlarged a bunch of glyphs and
  discovered the wonderful Fontlab bug of negative side bearings. Fontlab changed
  all the negative bearings in a wrong direction.\r\n\r\nI've writtin a Python script
  to help me fix them and I'm able to read old bearings on a glyph (from a previous
  version of the Fontlab file) change to my font in progress, read the bearings there
  and calculate the numbers I need.\r\n\r\nThe only thing I can't find is how to set
  the bearings to my new numbers.\r\n\r\nI'm sure there is something I'm missing something
  and any help would be greatly appreciated.\r\n\r\nKen"
