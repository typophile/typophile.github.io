  body: "Hmm, thank you! Yes Futura of course seems close, and fitting with Chicago's
    Miesian history, but its those sleek lower crossbars. Sadly yes could be re-drawn
    but I would love to set a whole drawing set in it -- with different weights --
    not just a few words. \r\n\r\nNeutraface is close for a contemporary re-make,
    I think ... still looking for the \"heritage\" version though ..."

  body: "Sorry, don't know the original name of the typeface this signage was made
    from. \r\nMy first thought was \"[[http://www.myfonts.com/search/futura|Futura]]\"
    but after a closer inspection, too many details are off. That's clearly not solving
    this case and you're probably not after this kind of answer but could be easily
    redrawn from Futura: /C finials \"\xE0-la-/G\", lowering /H crossbar, highering
    /A crossbar\r\nMore alternatives: <strong>[[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/urw/erbar|Erbar]]</strong>
    (could work as it, probably the closest I could get), [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/canadatype/semplicita-pro|Simplicita]]
    (quite same issues as Futura), [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/durotype/simplo|Simplo]]
    (same issues as Futura + /R off), [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/paratype/journal-sans|Journal
    Sans]] (/K and /R off)"
