    my book of the day, Penguin's <cite>Guide to Punctuation</cite>.\r\n\r\nI guess
    with quotes longer than a paragraph we might forget that what we're reading is
    a quote, so they put in the opening quote to remind us. And perhaps they don't
    close them because the quote isn't finished. It's always been something I've noticed
    too. "

  body: "It's 11.36 of the Chicago Manual of Style, though they prefer long quotations
    to be set as indented block quotes. Opening quotation mark shouldn't be imposed
    at the beginning of each sentence, but the beginning of each paragraph. The closed
    quotation mark is on the final paragraph only. Thus speaks the CMoS. \r\n\r\nThey
    taught us the same lesson in seventh grade. "
