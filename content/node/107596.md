body: What's a good (perhaps something cursive, vintage) font to capture the sentimental,
  feel-good spirit of a small town? If it has an underlying feeling of dread, it would
  be best (something like a small town from a Twilight Zone episode for example).

    Why do you think it's relevant what it's for? (it's a poster)

    relevant.\u201D\r\nYeah, no s**t. But my point is this: if a font is suitable
    for the idea of a project and works on a conceptual and aesthetic level, what's
    the difference if it's a poster or a book cover? It should work well across all
    mediums. And why is the debate shifting towards semantics, I asked for what professionals
    deemed a good font that is vintage and captures the \"sentimental, feel-good spirit
    of a small town\". It's for a poster and it's the main title. That's all there
    is to know really.\r\n\r\n@Nick Shinn:\r\nErm.. That's not really the kind of
    small town I want to show."

  body: "When you ask for help, and then people ask for more detail, it's generally
    under the premise that they feel they can offer you better help with more information.
    When you quickly dismiss those questions, you come off sounding like a twat. Why
    would you even trust someone's answer when their answer is based on virtually
    no information? And why would anyone want to help when you're so dismissive of
    their questions? So while it may not make much difference if it's for a book cover
    or a poster (two types of media you did <strong>not</strong> mention in your initial
    post), it certainly would make a difference if it was (as J. Tillman asked) for
    text. It could also make a difference if it was for the titles of a movie, or
    if it was going to be silkscreened on a t-shirt.\r\n\r\nSimilar instances where
    asking questions could provide more relevant answers:\r\n\r\n\u2022 What time
    period does this relate to? You never mentioned if this is a town in modern times,
    or the 1960s, or the 1880s. It wouldn't make sense to offer suggestions for fonts
    that evoke an episode of Twilight Zone from that 60s that took place in the 60s
    when you were really talking about one of the episodes from the 60s that took
    place in the 1800s.\r\n\r\n\u2022 Is the location of the town relevant? Your profile
    says you live in Montreal. Are you talking about a small town in Quebec or a small
    town in the US in Indiana? I'd imagine there'd be a difference. \r\n\r\n\u2022
    Who's the audience? (i.e. do they need something obvious, or would something more
    subtle work)\r\n\r\nThese are the kinds of questions professionals ask. They're
    also the kinds of questions (and answers) that could help the professionals who
    frequent this board give you better answers (or answers at all \u2014 twelve hours
    after asking your question, you've gotten none).\r\n\r\nSo feel free to continue
    coming off like a twat, and use Arial. Lots of people in small towns use Arial.
    But if you want better help in the future, try not being dismissive of questions
    that are being asked in the spirit of helping you."

    is somewhat similar, and is more easily available.

  body: "@jonathanhughes:\r\n\r\nWhere do I start with you... I wasn't dismissive,
    it was a question and I clarified my standpoint. If I were dismissive, I wouldn't
    bother explain myself.\r\n\r\n\u201Cyou come off sounding like a twat\u201D -
    And I'm sorry to say, you come off as an asshole.\r\n\r\n\u201CIt wouldn't make
    sense to offer suggestions for fonts that evoke an episode of Twilight Zone from
    that 60s that took place in the 60s when you were really talking about one of
    the episodes from the 60s that took place in the 1800s.\u201D Seriously? I find
    it hard to believe that there are people who ask such incredibly empty and silly
    questions. When I say \"Twilight Zone\", I mean the era in which it was produced
    (and most episodes were set in). Why would you even assume otherwise except to
    make a total dipshit, non-existent point?\r\n\r\n\u201CIs the location of the
    town relevant? Your profile says you live in Montreal. Are you talking about a
    small town in Quebec or a small town in the US in Indiana? I'd imagine there'd
    be a difference.\u201D Although true, I am sure that any non-bullshitting professional
    would agree that the combination of \"Twilight Zone\", \"vintage\", \"cursive\",
    and \"sentimental\" would evoke some sort of American 50s-60s vintage aesthetic
    to all professionals, now wouldn't it? I'm looking for options and would like
    to open a discussion, which is what these forums are for (a fact which you've
    managed to completely miss).\r\n\r\n\u201CWho's the audience? (i.e. do they need
    something obvious, or would something more subtle work)\u201D I'm not going to
    bother with that.\r\n\r\n\u201Cor answers at all \u2014 twelve hours after asking
    your question, you've gotten none\u201D - not exactly the kind of sneering sentiment
    a courteous professional would have, now is it? Oh and I did get an answer after
    all ;)\r\n\r\n\u201CSo feel free to continue coming off like a twat, and use Arial.\u201D
    And you go right on to sounding like an asshole while using whatever hipster font
    you're infatuated with this week."
