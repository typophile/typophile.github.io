  body: "> How do you copyright something?\r\n\r\nYou publish it. Every published
    work is automatically copyright. Just put the \xA92007 (or even Copyright 2007)
    somewhere on the piece. You can register the copyright, which is another step.
    I think Library of Congress looks after that in the US."
