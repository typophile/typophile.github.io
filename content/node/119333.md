body: hi guys, just curious to know if you have any preferred style/font for the page
  number of your papers. where in the sheet? up, down, in the middle, right, left?
  I usually prefer the middle of the page, number in courier or typewriter style (with
  akzidenz for the text body). cheers.

  body: It obviously depends on the overall design, but if possible I like them on
    the outer margin, for easier consultation.

  body: "In book design the most economical spot would be in the outer margin, flush
    with the last line of body type (that will give you an extra line of text per
    page, without impeding the balance of dimensions of margins).\r\nAs for style:
    use the same type as body, sized to around x-height or small caps size. Aiming
    for some frivolity? Go italic."

  body: You said "papers", are you referring to class assignments? If so I'd see if
    the professor has a preferred style.
