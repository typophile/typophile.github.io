body: "Hello\r\nThis is a photo segment of Herb Lubalin's type mural for the CBS building
  that was created in the late 1960s/early 1970s.\r\nI assume this was hand-drawn
  at the time, and it was definitely pre-digital, I'm just wondering if anyone has
  ideas for something similar to this compressed sans. The closest I could come was
  Helvetica Ultra Compressed, but it's not as compressed and it feels too open.\r\nAny
  ideas would be greatly appreciated!\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/bouillabaisse_type_2_4094.jpg]"

  body: Check out Tungsten as well. I don't think it comes quite that condensed /
    compact, but the "S" has a very similar shape.
