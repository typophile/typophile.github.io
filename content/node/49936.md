  body: "Number 1 is (early) custom work from me. There are tons of square sans serifs
    available though. :)\r\n\r\nNo 5. (zoetwaterbron) is also custom, designed by
    [[http://www.atelierreneknip.nl/|Ren\xE9 Knip]] and [[http://www.jannohahn.nl/|Janno
    Hahn]] (see [[http://www.jannohahn.nl/bonifatius-route-in-dokkum-to-make-a-contemporary-uncial-type-design-for-this-project-was-my-personal-initiative/|here]]
    and [[http://www.jannohahn.nl/bonifatius-route-in-dokkum-made-in-collaboration-with-atelier-rene-knip/|here]].
    Knip has a flash site, so no direct links unfortunately)."
