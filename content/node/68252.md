  body: "Sorry, but these are not the exact same font, in so many ways. The wacom
    logo is completely custom, from Wolff Olins. Not sure about kammeraadfinancial.
    No luck at What the Font, but there were some that were close. You can try yourself
    with the image below. Good luck!\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/kf_logo_5952.gif]"
