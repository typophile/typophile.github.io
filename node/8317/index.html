  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">This is my first post to this forum. I have designed a logo for a local wellness center and I am not quite happy with it. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I am pleased with the overall design but I think I need to tweak it just a bit more. The company has an existing logo of a heart with an olympic flame over it. I decided to update their image with a new design. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->They did'nt really ask for a redesign but I took the initiative to put something together for them. They have actually used the logo on a drink bottle but nowhere else. I think they are afraid to change their identity because they might look too &quot;successful&quot;. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The logo would eventually be applied to stationary, bus. cards, etc. Any critiques would be great at this point. I'm very happy with the concept but it still needs a little something. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Thanks for the help <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></div>

		<div class="commentbody">The concept is okay, in my opinion. But the overall feeling lacks finesse, subtlety. The capitals are rather insipid in contrast with the flowing forms of the central heart-piece.  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The way the H sits against the heart leaves this little angle in the top-right corner. This needs to be corrected. Also, to my eye, the W sits to cramped in the heart. Due to all the diagonal lines of that letter, you need to orchestrate a fine balance between form and counterform here. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Have you experimented with other fonts, or a narrower heart, smaller letters? Might be usefull.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I like the direction your logo is taking, but you might want to look at the flame shape and maybe make a small adjustment. As it is now, it is very similar to the shape of a descending dove, in that case it almost certainly gives a quasi religious feel to it - especially in some evangelical circles in the south. Perhaps another toungue on the flame would help or rounding the bottom a bit more. Unless of course it is associated with a church group or religious movement - in which case it would be very appropriate - right now it kinda seems to say Mercy Hospital of the Sacred Heart to me. As far as any ambiguity of the word wellness center - in Louisville almost ALL of the new health clubs are called &quot;Wellness Centers&quot; so I think that aspect is clear - is that a regional thing maybe? I do like the tagling though - very snappy. Is it possible to shift them to a deeper red - less bloody and more soothing? I think that will cut down on the medical feel - also maybe incorporate a softer color into the text to help even it all out.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I don't think I would go with a &quot;deeper red&quot;. To me, that is even more bloody. If anything, I would lean more in an orange direction, which has no relationship to blood or medical institutional imagery. Also, I don't mean to be intentionally contradicting Hugh on all accounts, but the dove thing seems to be a pretty far stretch. Anytime a heart is used as imagery, my first concern is avoiding the image of breasts or a butt. In this case, the only alternative image I can see beside the intended one is a flaming fart exiting a butt. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I can't say I like the tagline at all. &quot;Houston Wellness Center: Wellness is our middle name.&quot; It is redundant and doesn't add any explanation or description. Something like &quot;Houston Wellness Center: Live a longer, healthier life&quot; or &quot;&hellip;Be stronger, live longer&quot; makes a suggestion about what the wellness center is about. &quot;&hellip;is our middle name&quot; is an old school clich</div>

		<div class="commentbody">yikes - forgot about the whole error thing - been three months since I posted (ugh) if a mod could just delete one of those.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->LOL - Scott - boy oh boy I must be way out of practice at critique (heheheh) - Instead of deeper I should have said cooler reds- not quite as far as a rubine, but something of that more calm feel - but orange is an energy color so if you can get them to make enough of a shift to be an actual orangey (is that a word) red then you cold inject a ton of energy into the logo.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Scott you are probably right - it is a bit cliche, but I think that is what appeals to me - it seems like it is coming full circle. There are a lot of taglines for hospitals around here that are those kinds of statements. Norton - Experience. Better Care.; Baptist East - Feel Better. Maybe it was just the whole going for the cute punch line that got the nostalgic side of me. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->As far as the dove - I swear I see it, but that may be the fact that I am from the south and you can't swing a dead cat without hitting a church down here. And I know of a couple that are actually called Hearts of Fire Church (one was located in an old firehouse so it was always a bit corny). All I am saying is I have seen logos for churches that maximize the similarity between a flame shape and a downward dove - (i've even designed one or two). If I am the only one who sees it - then you are probably safe. - Just thought to mention it.</div>
