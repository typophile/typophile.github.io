body: "I've been trying to get to the bottom of how to best set vertical metrics in
  web fonts. These issues go way back, all the way to the creation of the TrueType
  format, which had separate Windows and Mac fields. Setting them wrong will lead
  to clipping, strange line spacing, and inconsistencies between browsers - sadly
  very familiar outcomes for people using web fonts. I'd like to make all that go
  away, and, just as important, make life easier for font designers, so they can just
  set the metrics and be confident they're right.\r\n\r\nTo _really_ understand vertical
  metrics on the web, I created some test cases and tested on a lot of browsers. I
  also came up with some draft recommendations, generally similar to the ones Typekit
  has been promoting.\r\n\r\nMy recommendations, along with the raw source and screenshots
  from the test cases, as well as references to source materials (many typophile threads
  were quite enlightening) are here: http://code.google.com/p/googlefontdirectory/wiki/VerticalMetricsRecommendations\r\n\r\nThat's
  a community wiki page, and I welcome contributions, as I'm sure people will have
  more insight. If you've got something to add (and are not a spammer :), let me know
  and I'll add you. And, of course, I'm hoping for some spirited discussion here.\r\n\r\nOne
  of the other things that emerged from my testing is that people should really be
  specifying CSS line-height explicitly, rather than defaulting to line-height: normal.
  The actual spacing behavior of the latter is extremely complex and inconsistent
  from browser to browser. When you specify line-height explicitly, things get a lot
  better, but baseline positioning can still be wobbly.\r\n\r\nAnd I'm very happy
  if people have questions, or feel there's something unclear in that document. I've
  been spending quite a lot of time digging into this and feel it's a good time to
  spread what I've found more widely."

    responsibility of the typographer/document designer to determine whether extra
    leading (\"linespacing\") is required for the job in hand, rather than relying
    on a hodge-podge of automations whose complications will be compounded by type
    designers' interpretations. "

  body: "I've known about variations in line-height/vertical-metrics between browsers
    and platforms for quite awhile but what I'm finding hard to understand is why
    this was or is not an issue with the 'web safe' system fonts.\r\n\r\nAren't there
    the same variations using, say, Verdana or Arial? In other words, is this actually
    a new problem or just one that went unnoticed until fonts were in the spotlight?\r\n\r\n@nick
    shinn\r\n\r\nI think these are honest divergences of opinion about what font data
    matters the most, Nick. And perhaps an old fashioned bug or two thrown in. Not
    a shoot out over proprietary implementations.\r\nThere's also a lot more collegiality
    between competing browser teams these days - at least with something like this.
    So hopefully the wrinkles will get smoothed out informally. Much quicker that
    way, to say the least.\r\n"

  body: Nick, system/application developers could come up with a single standard,
    and a) the existing compatibility issues would still remain and b) at least one
    developer would interpret the standard differently and produce new compatibility
    issues.

    of understanding font, sze and leading as an integrated spectrum of possibilities,
    through which per font ideals run according to language and line length?  Way
    too complicated... So  instead we have the \"standard\" assumption of 12point
    masters and 120% leading, 65-character long  lines of English, (or all languages,
    your chouce) and shove the problem on down the line to \"the educators\".\r\n\r\nFor
    a real solution, standard meta data would need to exist that apps and users would
    a have chance with. Or... you can go with John's idea, that people will just mess
    it up no matter what'cha do. Or you can go with the idea that inflexible and incomplete
    solutions are just an honest diversion of opinion, and not a partial understanding
    of the complex that is typography today. Or you can take the truly stupid road
    and think one set of values would work.\r\n\r\nSee, lots of choices;) welcome

  body: "@jasonc: I don't know of any such browsers, but I haven't wrapped my head
    around vertical writing scripts yet. What I'm talking about here is strictly clipping,
    baseline position, and line spacing for horizontal modes.\r\n\r\n@Richard Fink:
    They are a problem with system fonts - I found clipping for Vietnamese glyphs
    in Arial on Windows, and inconsistencies in line spacing from Windows to Mac.
    But I think the diversity of web fonts brings out the problems more acutely.\r\n\r\n@dberlow:
    I'd love to see actually useful metadata in the font that helps apps come up with
    better layout choices. I think maybe the closest thing we have to that is the
    \"actually use typo metrics\" bit, which is a pretty strong signal to apps that
    the typo metrics are trustworthy. Unfortunately, only IE7+ and recent-ish versions
    of Word respect that (I'm frankly surprised that Firefox on Windows doesn't),
    so it doesn't go very far to solving the consistency issues that web designers
    have to deal with today.\r\n\r\nBut I do think that being able to <em>articulate</em>
    the goals will go a long way towards eventually converging on something useful.
    To date, vertical metrics have generally been pretty hazy and mysterious (notwithstanding
    John Hudson's great tutorial and the Typekit blogs on the subject), and tool support
    for getting it right is also poor - especially FontForge.\r\n\r\nThanks to everybody
    for the comments!"

    by badly set v metrics. ahem :)\r\n\r\nSecond is the inconsistencies that exist
    in amongst the standards.\r\nRe Verdana, Arial etc. I did some cross platform,
    cross browser, tests with a handfull of big name system fonts. They do suffer
    these issues, because the issue is obviously not necessarily at font level.\r\n\r\nI
    have wondered this myself - is there any solution within font metric standards
    right now that can be utilised to ease these inconsistencies? (i,e more than Raph
    states above) or is the core problem at system/browser level?"

    problem is human. The janitors failed to consider the ramifications of the confluence

    layout and a disintegrated multi-script environment like the web. Simply said
