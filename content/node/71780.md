  body: not trying to be picky but the term Cartouche is typically associated with
    Egyptian culture.  Could you point me in a more "design" oriented direction.  I
    am simply trying to gather more information and examples about them but I am usually
    limited to "uncontemporary" examples.

  body: 'Nick''s term is absolutely correct. A cartouche can be the oblong container
    surrounding hieroglyphics, BUT it can also be define as "(also cartouch) an oval
    or oblong design typically edged with ornamental scrollwork. It is used to hold
    a painted or low relief design." '

  body: I understand that it is a correct term... I guess what I meant is there some
    other association  with a more contemporary Cartouche so I might be able to find
    more example of them... and I'm guessing since all there is, is Cartouche.  That
    answers my question with a no.  although the term Cartouche is definitely more
    then I knew before posting.

    shield, bug, lock-up, frame, plaque, emblem, etc.'
