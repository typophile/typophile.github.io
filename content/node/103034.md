  body: The closest I have is [[https://www.klim.co.nz/retail-fonts/calibre|Calibre]].
    All letters look pretty close (if not matching) except for /a. As I was unable
    to find it even with the [[https://www.klim.co.nz/yk-files/4b971d4f29818ea67f2d622c1567f8cc/Klim-Calibre.pdf|complete
    character map]], it may have been customized.

  body: I still don't know if it has been based on Calibre, at least it resembles
    it now. What I know though is it can't be Avant-Garde to me or it has been so
    customized nothing has been left from it. All letters are off.
