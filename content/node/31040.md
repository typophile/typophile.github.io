  body: "The \"RA\" overlap bugs me, but otherwise this is really cool. I'm not sure
    how I feel about the 'S' - it might need to be looked at, but it fits the general
    vibe of the logo. Also, the bottom of the 'U' could be a little bit thicker, but
    I'd have to see it that way.\r\n\r\nAs for kerning, \"UN\" in \"UNITED\" seems
    closer than the rest of \"UNITED\", so I'd tighten up \"NITED\" a bit. Also in
    \"BRAZILIAN\", \"IL\" could be tightened, as well as \"JIU\". As I've said before,
    I'm no kerning expert,  so someone else could probably help you more.\r\n\r\nGood
    job, and I'm looking forward to seeing this progress.\r\n\r\n - Lex"

    in "Jitsu"?

  body: "Take a look at your cap A. I think its central axis is leaning further to
    the right than the rest of the letters, just by a hair. It could be an optical
    illusion that needs to be compensated for? Am I the only one who wants the tail
    on the J to look more like the leg on the R? It might not work but I think it'd
    be worth a look. The N bugs me, but I can't figure out why specifically.\r\n\r\nOtherwise,
    good job."

    hyphen as a flat spot, you could try making an angled version.\r\n\r\nTim"

  body: Thanks for the tips. timd, I'm not sure what you mean by making the hyphen
    angled... The ends are already angled. Here's the altered attempt. [img:sites/default/files/old-images/bjju_4937.gif]
