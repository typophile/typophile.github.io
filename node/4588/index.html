  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>My company is sending myself and other Mac users on a two day course next month to learn about [[Adobe InDesign]]. Specifically, whether it is worth changing the whole (advertising) company from [[Quark 4]] to InDesign as opposed to upgrading Quark (the more expensive option).</p>
<p>Although I am a bit wary about changing over, I&rsquo;ll be going along with a (relatively) open mind. But I would like to know what thoughts do you people have about the differences between [[QuarkXpress|Quark]] and InDesign? Things to look out for? Basic boxes or tricky typographic twiddling? From an overall design perspective to a more particular typographic viewpoint -  which is best?</p>
<p>Apologies if this has been covered before, but it would be really useful to have a few opinions and perhaps things to look out for from people who know their stuff.</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

		<div class="commentbody">Rob: <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I use InDesign 2 (on Windows) at work (a major Canadian Public Library) and I enjoy it and it works well, smoothly, and is wonderful at setting text. I just like it. If you are already using Illustrator and Photoshop, InDesign makes an excellent fit. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->There are some interface inconsistencies with Illustrator and Photoshop, and that can bug you, but in all they are very nice together. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I have purchased Creative Suite Premium for my own use (on Macintosh) and the integration is better through-out though there is still more to be done. It is pretty well wholesome and delicious from my POV. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Thomas: <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I can't speak to crossing the Quark with Adobe apps. I have only ever used Adobe apps. I even liked Pagemaker and thanks for bringing back the Control Panel in CS. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->It looks like Macromedia Studio MX is in my very near future because of my various capacities at work, so I may be able to comment on this soon. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Nick: <!-- raw HTML omitted -->What I don't understand is why you feel embarrased that your students haven't learned Quark. InD is clearly gaining traction and improving steadily, and seems the way of the future. Your students are well prepared. I don't understand why employers and potential employees both worry so much about whether you have one or the other. Can't the other be learned and conceptually we're talking about the same stuff right (text and pictures combined on a page), so you sit down, RTFM, screw around, commit to using the new one for a critical project and then you've got a pretty good idea of what goes on. I know this sounds like I'm an arrogant prick (I can be) but what I'm getting at is: are these programs that conceptually different? From what I have seen in the screenshots and movies and stuff it looks a lot the same.* <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->In general: <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I have never had the opportunity to use Quark. I'm sure it can be learned. I'm sure it's a very capable program or the large number of companies that do use it would no longer be invested in it. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->As a potential customer (and up until my recent CS purchase I was one), nothing that Quark did or said could convince me that their world was better. Truthfully I must say that their insistence on not bringing their stuff to OS X drove me mad and predjudiced me against them forever. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Jon <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->*I remember now: their Flash movie seems to not work when you get to the Landmarks section.

		<div class="commentbody"><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Grant,<!-- raw HTML omitted --> I was referring to Nick's disappointment that OT implementation in InDesign is botched (Nick's words, not mine). I only say InDesign is pioneering, because it's the only mainstream app that can use OT fonts at the moment. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Nick,<!-- raw HTML omitted --> there are color swatches in InD. They just happen to be in the color palette. (Imagine that.) Rather than in an obscure dialogue box. I agree with Jon, that is one aspect of the Adobe suite that's really nice - the apps all play nicely together. For the most part all the key commands are the same. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Thomas,<!-- raw HTML omitted --> of course Quark is the underdog. They're not Microsoft or Adobe. =) It was easy to predict the day Adobe announced InDesign (1998?). I knew then PageMaker and Quark were doomed if Adobe got InD right. (Frankly I was kind of puzzled to see PageMaker continue on for so long after InD came out.) <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Furthermore, you're right about the Photoshop example. I've been impressed that Adobe has continued to innovate with Photoshop. (Afterall, they still want people to have a good reason to upgrade every year or two, right? No different from any other software maker.) <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Rob Walker,<!-- raw HTML omitted --> one final point. Don't expect to install InDesign and &quot;get it&quot; immediately. If you know Illustrator, sitting in the InD saddle will feel very familiar. But when you switch, give yourself some adequate time to try stuff, read the manual, etc. For me it took half a day to get over the awkwardness of a new app and about a full week before I felt like I really understood the more complex stuff: how to use masks, masterpages, style sheets, etc. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I guess the bottom line is, I don't believe in hanging on to old tech for nostalgia's sake.

Although I'm far from expert, I have to say that is one really major reason I'm trying to work with only InDesign and not going back to Quark. The fact that everything seems to be one application. The ability to go back and forth without having to mentally switch different quick keys. The downside for me is speed. I'm using Panther and Indy CS (all CS now actually). But Quark is still faster, and not just marginally, I would call indy slug-like even. But, I use Indy because the patience pays off in the end. &mdash; BTW Indy &gt; GoLive &lt; Illustrator is pretty cool too.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Nick said: <!-- raw HTML omitted -->EMBARRASSMENT that my students (I teach part time) will graduate proficient in InD, but with no Quark skills (the faculty chose Adobe), when that's a requirement of most entry-level jobs<!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->This is a reality. I can relate to this. It seems most entry level jobs want friggin' ambidextrous multi-lingual multi-platform multi-media geniuses &hellip; an unfair amount of pressure is put upon the teachers whose hands are tied.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I can also say that I have put zillions of hours into Quark and can only say that I'm happy that Adobe allows the quick-keys (and other such) to be the same app to app. I can even set my palettes up almost identically from app to app. Lurvely! <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Up until recently I've managed to leave Quark alone. I do have a two clients now, one a publisher the other in the training field, who both use Quark 4.11 &ndash; so I happily can help them. Otherwise I might not have been able to accept the work. I consider Quark a tool that I can use when I need to, but only often enough that it doesn't get dusty. However, if more clients need me to use Quark I won't turn my nose up at them. Quark isn't a way of life, it is only a tool to me. <!-- raw HTML omitted --></div>

		<div class="commentbody">Joe: re the colors &ndash; there really were no Pantone colors anywhere in InDesign 2.0! This bug was fixed with 2.1.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Grant: re &quot;OT botched&quot; in InD, there are several problems. To begin with, the OT commands are buried on a 2nd-level submenu. It would be nice to have an interface which showed the user at a glance what features were available for a particular font &ndash; Basic, Faux, or OT &ndash; and allowed one to select a piece of text and just click on buttons to see the effect, rather than &quot;click-drag-drag-release&quot; every time. Secondly, the major issue of &quot;is it or isn't it&quot; faux small caps is not resolved. Ultimately, OT features should not be in an add-on menu, but integrated. It's unfortunate that they were not a more integral part of the InDesign coding from its inception, because the timing was concurrent. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The OT palette is a work in progress, and is more progressed in Illustrator CS than in InDesign CS. And I am PLEASED that it's getting better all the time!</div>

		<div class="commentbody">When I see nasty notchy blocks of justified copy, I shiver and think of the days before I had the paragraph composer. I get angry about dongles. Even worse: one undo. I hated Quark every minute I used it (starting in 1994). When InD came out I bought the first copy. When my OS9 machine crashed (we all remember those days), I was amazed to find the project I was working on happily waiting for me when I re-opened InDesign. It was slow, but in that moment I was sold. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I do use multiple graphics platforms. For web work, I use the macromedia suite (photoshop for the web? yuck) and BBEdit. I rarely mix the two suites, however. I still have a soft spot in my heart for Deneba Canvas (bet you never heard of it). It's a do-everything graphics app that my Dad bought me when I was a kid (mostly because it was so cheap). I acutally used it my first year of design school, because it's all I could afford. Now it's marketed to engineers. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->As for competition for Photoshop: how do we know how good photoshop would be if it had some serious competition? Maybe it would be faster, or have new features we haven't thought of; maybe it wouldn't cost so much. I love Photoshop, but I wish it had some friendly competition. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->As for botched OpenType support: I've talked about this before, but why should supported features be defined by the application? Why shouldn't they be defined by the type designer? For example, why can't I add four different ligature sets to a font. Why do I have to put them in the &quot;titling alternates&quot; feature, just so I can access them? It's times like this that I'm saddened at Apple's lousy job of promoting AAT, and that I'll probably never see AAT features supported in Adobe apps.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Of course, this is only an option. By default, InD uses the kerning built into the font. Personally, I'd use optical kerning on almost any shareware font, and some retail fonts.

It saves me taking the time to kern the combination manually, and usually comes out with about the same result. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Hrant will swear that optical kerning does a better job than all but the very best type designers.
