  to be typeset is \"REVOLUTION.\" \r\n\r\nBut it should have a small caps to go with
  it.\r\n\r\nIn particular the leg of the R need to be straight, not curved.\r\n\r\nDoes
  anyone know any fonts that might fit this bill? \r\n\r\nThanks in advance"

    In fact, a good number of new(er) Sans Serifs usually include small caps and old
    style figures.\r\n\r\nAs for your font, you could try Trade Gothic (or if you
    have lots of money, Benton Sans, or alternatively, one of the other \"gothics\"
    ie. News or Franklin) or Akzidenz Grotesk. Both have straight leg 'R's, and at
    bold weight, look pretty robust."

    \r\n\r\nI would guess the lack of small caps in sans typefaces is because historically
    long lengths of text were typically set in serif type."

    fonts evoke cultural contexts. \r\nDIN (and its knockoffs) say standardization,
    bureaucracy, rules, norms \u2013 \r\nthat's the context DIN was developed in/for.
    Iwan Reschniev stems from Tschichold's New Typography, a strongly ideological

    the typographer in charge, who asked quite clearly for recommendations. I understood
    he wanted a punch, not a sneak. :)\r\nI'm aware of the overlap/blur between constructivism
    seen as revolutionary, and modularity seen as stifling and monotonous \u2013 super-interesting
    stuff actually. Tschichold's own change of stance in this regard is maybe the
    best proof of this. \r\nBut there is still a difference in freshness to my understanding,
    in (historical) edginess; wouldn't you agree that it'd be equally unfitting to
    see DIN on Russian Constructivist posters as it would be to see Iwan Reschniev
