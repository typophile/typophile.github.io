body: "A) Can ligatures be included in Class Kerning\r\n\r\nB) If so, how is it done?\r\n\r\nIt
  appears to work in the metrics window but in Photoshop it will not.  All my classes
  work properly except where a ligature is involved, when the ligature will not kern
  at all .  I do have the ligatures included in my kerning classes. I fear I am doing
  something similar to my previous problem regarding the ordering and /or syntax of
  my OT script, but this was generated by FL and not manually.\r\nAlso, strangely,
  the Class Names I specified were changed after generating the OTF from the VFB,
  \r\nCan anyone shed some light on this for me please?"

    body: Thanks Nick, but I have many ligatures in the font and kerning is not being
      actioned in any of them (although the key glyph in the class is). In fact, in
      this font, fi & fl aren't even kerned.

    names don't get carried over into compiled OTFs, so FontLab assigns generic names
    to any classes when re-importing.\r\n\r\nYou say class kerning works properly
    in FontLab's Metrics window, does it also work in the OpenType Features Preview
    panel (with the <code>kern</code> feature checked)?"
