  anyway) a font for me. Interceptor by Device Fonts. It's essentially a revised version
  of STOP, by Aldo Novarese.\r\n\r\nHowever, \"Interceptor\" is based on some other
  font (also a redraft of STOP). I'd like to know what that font is. Some photolettering
  typeface? Or? This earlier source would have been in existence in 1990, and earlier.\r\n\r\nSample
  of Interceptor Italic:\r\nhttp://devicefonts.co.uk/fontshow-b2/Interceptor-Italic.png\r\n\r\n"

      other variant - similar to Stop, but what was used as 'inspiration' for the
      Interceptor font.\r\n\r\nPerhaps a better question would be to list all the
      variants based heavily on Stop. I would imagine the one I'm looking for has
      not yet been digitized, as I have all the current digital variants for reference.\r\n\r\nAG

      - which based on the dated samples I have are remarkably similar in many respects
      to his font. \r\n\r\nAny more STOP-esq fonts produced in/around or prior to
      1990? I'm guessing it is non-digital."
