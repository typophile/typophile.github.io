    and not ones particularly suited for technical/mathematical typesetting. For one
    thing, they seem to lack the needed characters.\r\n\r\nI would assume, if you're
    going to be setting technical/mathematical material, you would consider some form
    of TeX -- LaTex, XeTeX, etc. The layout program (typesetting program) is going
    to be much more important than any font choice here.\r\n\r\nFortunately, the TeX
    uses of the world are usually quite willing to advise someone on font choices,
    based on the material needing to be set."

    I'm sure TeX users are a generous bunch and great at using TeX, but from what
    I've seen judicious type selection is not their forte, in general. (And Computer
    Modern still makes my hair stand on end.)\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "So, Papazian, apparently you know of no good font choices which can successfully
    be combined with a layout program for Mr. S\xE1nchez to typeset equations and
    formulas. Why, then, did you post? Do you in fact have such knowledge, but are
    unwilling to share it? Or are you suggesting that since nothing meets your criteria,
    Mr. S\xE1nchez should abandon his efforts and seek other employment? \r\n\r\nMr.
    S\xE1nchez -- since you've been a typophile member for almost four years, you
    already know Papazian rarely has anything helpful to offer, especially for people
    who want to <cite>use</cite> type. \r\n\r\nAny working professional should know
    there are type families other than Computer Modern which can be used with TeX.
    And the TeX community is a good place to ask about them. As a general note, many
    of the more technical books published through The Johns Hopkins University Press
    are typeset using LaTeX, as that is what most (technical) author's use to prepare
    their manuscripts. Much easier on all concerned to just follow through and use
    LaTeX to set the book after the editorial & design work is done. The designer
    must take the typesetting process into consideration, of course, but would in
    any case. How do you typeset a book requiring characters not available in a font?\r\n\r\n"

  body: "This is a somewhat old thread which just came to my notice.\r\n\r\nComputer
    Modern, although the current version is much improved over the original, is still
    questionable from a typographical standpoint.\r\n\r\nGiven that the textbook is
    not college-level, it may not be the case that you need a typeface with a comprehensive
    set of mathematical characters.\r\n\r\nThere are a number of open-source imitations
    of Times Roman that have extensive sets of mathematical characters (STIX, which
    has display problems in some programs, and TeX Gyre Termes, which has fewer mathematical
    characters, come to mind.)\r\n\r\nIf you prefer something resembling Palatino,
    there's Asana-Math; like STIX, it may have problems with some programs under Windows.\r\n\r\nSymbola,
    DejaVu Serif, and Quivira are other choices."

  body: "Luis, if you are still checking this, what layout application(s) are using
    for composing your equations? Have you considered (if it is a consideration) how
    you will transform to MathML or output digitally? Currently MathJax is one of
    the best tools for delivering equations in digital products and online but it
    uses the STIX fonts by default (for MathML) and this could mean a dramatic shift
    in look and feel between your printed and digital output. [[https://groups.google.com/forum/#!msg/mathjax-users/PjcC7lqbNGs/z-EafIHplpoJ|There
    are workarounds]] but they are complex.\r\n\r\nIn terms of print there are numerous
    options, including TeX as mentioned above, [[http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/word-help/write-insert-or-change-an-equation-HA001230361.aspx|Microsoft

    ([[http://www.dessci.com/en/products/mathtype/misc/euclid_plain.gif|Euclid]] and
    various symbol fonts) and [[http://www.phsoftware.com/pages/powermath_indesign.html|PowerMath]]
    (Helvetica, Palatino, Times Ten and symbol fonts). I am sure there are more but
    these are the ones I am most familiar with. All of these applications come with
    typographic support as indicated in brackets but they may not fit your expectations.\r\n\r\nIt
    is important to keep in mind accessibility and by having clean MathML compliant
    mark up you should be fine. I am not as familiar with TeX output but would hope
    that accessibility would not be a problem.\r\n\r\nMurray Sargent's overview of

  body: "<cite>Are books for students also mostly typeset in a sans?</cite>\r\n\r\nThat
    depends on the country you are in, and the time period.\r\n\r\nIn the English-speaking
    world, textbooks for the earliest primary grades used to be set in large sizes
    of Caslon, and then we saw Spot run in Century Schoolbook.\r\n\r\nIn some other
    countries, infanta versions of sans-serif faces are often resorted to in primary
    schools; in the English-speaking world, they're used for some storybooks that
    parents buy to read at home to their small children.\r\n\r\nFor older students,
    there was Monotype Modern Series 11 in the days before Times Roman conquered the
    world. These days, Baskerville, Garamond, Caledonia, Palatino... whatever is used
    for text setting in general may be found in a textbook. (Halliday and Resnick,
    a very popular first-year University physics textbook, was set in Baskerville.)\r\n\r\nNot
    that Helvetica or Univers could not be found in, say, a textbook on architecture
    or graphic design. My experience is with the physical sciences, where there was
    more conservatism, and I do not recall sans-serif faces in primary or secondary
    school textbooks in the 1960s.\r\n\r\nI know that I have come across a math book
    in an uncommon foreign language - perhaps it was Hungarian - set in a Venetian
    typeface, of all things."

  body: "For the K\u201312 level, you probably do not need any specialized math or
    TeX font. You may run into trouble with vector arrows in physics, but as far as
    I know, any good typeface with Greek support will do the job. Almost every professional
    font includes \u221A, mathematical \u03C0 \u0394 and \u2202,  \u222B, \u221E,
    and \u2211, though I would make sure they have \u2265 \u2264\u2245 and the angle
    symbols since those are non standard. No font includes the characters for vincula
    and the radical overbar\u2014either your equation engine makes them itself, of
    you manually construct them with em dashes or underscores. \r\nIn my experience,
    I've found it easier to just manually typeset the built-up equations with text
    boxes and em dashes. Much more flexible that way and you can correct stuff that
    looks funny. I typeset an entire physics paper that way. The only place I can
    see you running into trouble is with the stretch parentheses and stuff\u2014you
    might have to resort to a helper font that contains those symbols (or just draw
    the helper font yourself).\r\n\r\n\r\n[[http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-7v3h0CnOhWU/VASwkryLhUI/AAAAAAAAAdY/wQbUbY20vYk/s1600/Screenshot%2B065.png|Example

  body: Interesting how LaTeX just scales up the parentheses with no regard to weight.
    Probably bc it couldn't find the character in Minion Pro? I used a light weight
    of Garamond for those parentheses

  body: "The <a href=\"http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/fonts/minionpro\">MinionPro
    package</a>  uses the MnSymbol fonts that were designed  to be used with Minion.
    Here are all the fonts included in the pdf:\r\n<pre>\r\nMinionPro-Capt\r\nMinionPro-It\r\nMinionPro-Regular\r\nMnSymbol12\r\nMnSymbol8\r\n</pre>\r\nI
    used pdfLaTex; so the  MnSymbol fonts come from Type 1 files; there are files
    for 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 and 12 points. I thus presume the way the parentheses scale
    follow the designer's preferences. \r\n\r\nIf I compile the same file with the
    package fourier (Utopia based), which is the package I use regularly, here is
    what I get:\r\n<img src=\"/files/eqn_utopia_four_6343.png\" width=100%>\r\n(Equations
    using the Fourier math font and Utopia)\r\nThe large parentheses are less agressive.
    The fonts used are (listed with <code>pdffonts</code> on the pdf file)\r\n<pre>\r\nFourier-Math-Extension\r\nFourier-Math-Letters-Italic\r\nFourier-Math-Symbols\r\nUtopia-Italic\r\nUtopia-Regular\r\n</pre>\r\nThere
    is no \"opticals\". \r\n\r\nI don't think I would parenthesize the way you did
    though. I usually put smaller parentheses inside larger ones which would give
