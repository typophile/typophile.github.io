    ;o)\r\n\r\nFYI, I think the license is perfectly valid in that it will work just
    fine. It's what's called grey-market at that point. Adobe may not SUPPORT that
    license, but there's no reason you can't install and run it wherever you want
    to. \r\n"

  body: "If Europeans want better prices, they need to stop buying stuff at higher
    prices. The reason Europe, Australia, and Japan pay so much more for stuff than
    Americans is because you guys grumble a lot, and maybe send the European Commission
    out to do a little legal harassment, but in the end you still buy the software.
    When companies try jacking up prices in the US we just buy elsewhere. Don\u2019t
    complain about price discrimination if you\u2019re eventually just going to buy
    the software regardless."

    the market will bear is a factor in pricing.\r\nBut there may be costs involved
    that the purchaser is not aware of.\r\nFoir instance, there are financial complexities
    for any seller in a foreign market, dealing with book-keeping, banks and taxation.\r\nAlso,
    if a company has extra marketing expenses maintaining a presence in a foreign
    market, it may wish to factor that into its pricing.\r\nFinally, there are product
    development and after sales support costs, which on a per-item basis are more
    expensive for a small, foreign language market than for a large, English-speaking
    home market.\r\n"

  body: "\"Why do you think a company which sells its products for different prices

    it's a completely arbitrary decision to sell software and other electronic media
    per-region. It's an outdated concept that only applies logically to physical goods.\r\n\r\nCombine
    that with the 'global economy' and 'free trade' and the like and it just becomes
    more and more of an absurd concept.\r\n\r\nThe only logical (IMHO) price differentiation
    should be LOWER prices in developing countries. Typically, the US has the higher
    SOL able to afford the higher prices for software.\r\n\r\n\"Surely a business
    has the right to determine the prices it asks for its products?\"\r\n\r\nAnd surely
    the consumer can shout about it being unfair. ;o)\r\n\r\nIn the end, I think it's

    in the US is that there are Adobe operations in UK, France, Germany, etc., and
    the company has the odd idea that these people should be paid. And paid by the
    sales of the software in those countries. Smaller numbers of units per employee
    means higher prices, unfortunately.\r\n\r\n"

    and hence a business requirement, legislated by governments, and enforced if you
    are audited. Governments are in cahoots too, with reciprocal tax agreements, so
    businesses doing international trade have to be very careful. You don't want to
    be hit up for several years' back taxes from foreign sales that you *didn't know*
    you were liable for, and then have those taxes collected by your own government!\r\n\r\n<em>I

  body: "Something that once happened to me & may be of interest:\r\n\r\nWhen buying
    my first Mac I had to get software for it & I most of all needed QuarkXPress.
    At that time (1989) it cost more than 2500 guilders in The Netherlands. I decided
    to try to buy in in the States & after a few attempts (where I was rebuffed on
    account of 'not permitted to export') I found a place where to were willing to
    sell. I think I paid 799 dollars for it (at the time the equivalent of about 1200
    guilders).\r\n\r\nThe version I received was 2.0. As the 'elder' Typophiles may
    remember that dot-zero-version was a disaster \u2014 you just couldn't work with
    it. So I tried to upgrade, first contacting the European rep of Quark. When they
    checked my serialnumber they firmly told me they would NOT provide me with an
    upgrade on the regular conditions \u2014 because it was a 'US-version' they were
    going to charge me extra, to the tune of 1600 guilders.Crazy, right?. Definitely
    not okay by me, so I contacted Quark HQ in Denver, several times, a story by itself.
    Turned out they would not support a version that was 'illegally' exported from
    the States. \r\n\r\nAfter several months of this kind of hassle, I decided to
    use a copy of 2.11 that a friend of mine was using. Maybe not completely legal,
    but I did pay a fair price for a product that turned out to be unusable. I wrapped
    up the original package and sent it by special delivery to Tim Gill. Never heard
    back from Quark.\r\n\r\nAt this time Adobe's online activation policy is (as far
    as I know) not tied to any info on the box of the software, BUT that can change
    & 'gray' imports could be the first casualties of a new policy. Marketingbased
    companies really like to control the pipelines\u2026"

    on using tangible metaphors to describe their virtual goods, yet like to cry foul
    when consumers want the same flexibility.\r\n\r\nFor instance, they insist that
    every \"pirated (I really hate the misuse of that term)\" copy of their music/movie/software
    is akin to actual theft of physical goods and real income. If it's real, then
    the product is a product and should be the same no matter where you are on the
    planet. \r\n\r\nBert, I empathize...I think we all have our own favorite Quark
    support story that ends somewhat like yours..."
