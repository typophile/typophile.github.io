  selscted Caecilia (see the pic) as the main font for use in materials for my new
  business. I want a sans serif to complement it (for headings etc) and can't find
  anything I feel really works. I might just be being very choosy, but if anyone has
  any ideas I'd be happy to hear them.\r\n\r\nThanks\r\n\r\nRobert"

    ringer for Caecillia and The Sans works beautifully with it.

    will work fine with Caecilia too. Other ideas:\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/showfont.cfm?fid=GF.118889.0.0\">Freight

  body: "i used theserif (text) together with akzidenz grotesk super (headlines) for
    a festival magazine, but the audience was 14-24, and thats probably not the same
    for you ;)\r\n\r\nAG super is a great counterpart to fine humanistic slabs imho
    because it takes them out of the \"nice and lovely\" corner. but hmm, thats just
    my opinion. plus its a rather unconventional mix, pairing a humanistic with a
    grotesque - but lets note too that AG isnt your everyday static grotesque due
    to its round shapes.\r\non the safer side, any humanistic sans could work. whitney,
    the already named thesans, frutiger next, maybe even vista.\r\n\r\ndisclaimer:
    all content of this post was written because i like to help, not because i think
    too great of my typographic skills."

  body: I agree with Patty as well. Thesis is a wonderful family. Not to take anything
    away from Caecilia. I'm using Caecilia on a project right now. I'm using it with
    Apolline Italic, which is a serif, so doesn't apply to your question.

  body: "Thanks for the comments so far \u2013\_I'll look into them. I realised too
    late that I had foolishly chosen a font that was the only one it's creator had
    designed so there wasn't the usual chance to dig out the \"follow ups\", I was
    obviously taken with it a little too much. \r\n\r\nThanks again and I'll keep
    you updated"

  body: "I've been working on a project recently that uses Caecilia as the main typeface
    (we don't own Thesis). I agree with statements here about choosing a round face.
    I have paired it recently with Avenir. I think a \"geometric\" are \"draftsman\"
    look would work the best with such a slabby face.\r\n\r\nTry Gotham, Avenir, Proxima
    Nova, or even Interstate to go along with it. Interstate actually works quite
    well with it, believe it or not. "

  body: "I had used FS Albert (fairly rounded and geometric) with it, but it fell
    to pieces on me from a techology point of view and I resent the prospect of paying
    for it again.\r\n\r\nI've used Avenir before and think it may be a little too
    geometric (mainly for my tastes) but I'll certainly give it a go."
