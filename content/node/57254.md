  body: "It seems that font has a lot of names. It even shows up as one of the Bluemlein
    Collection handwriting fonts by Ale Paul. See [[http://www.sudtipos.com/fonts/57|Mr
    Lackboughs]]. There are a few small differences, but I think the connection is
    real. This suggests that the Lady Dawn and others may have been based on the Bluemlein
    script, even before Alejandro made his revivals.\r\n\r\n - Mike Yanega"
