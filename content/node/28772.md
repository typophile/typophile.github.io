    Ever look at subtitles on that thing?\r\n\r\nI think ebooks will be useful for
    reference books, maybe cookbooks, etc but novels are pretty perfect & perfectly
    portable as they are and I challenge you to find an ebook that will replace a
    beautifully designed art book."

  body: "A widescreen iPod is still just an LCD, and comes with all the qualities
    of LCD screens that killed the first round of ebook readers. I'm very excited
    by the prospect of rendering text with digital ink from Phillips, but since Sony
    seems to have the exclusive right to market the technology right now, I expect
    that it will be a while before we start seeing affordable ebook readers\u2013much
    less ebook readers with an interface that anyone would actually want to use. \r\n\r\n<a
    href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2006/04/29/technology/29paper.html?ex=1303963200&en=7c42f0659ee3039d&ei=5088&partner=rssnyt&emc=rss\">Microsoft's
    new \"Vista technology\" for reformatting the New York Times</a> sounds exciting,
    because I've read somewhere that there will be special readers produced for it
    that aren't actually full-price tablet PCs. If this \"Vista technology\" (Cleartype?)
    end up on low-power tablet systems with bright OLED screens that should start
    appearing in the next decade it could be pretty sweet. Unfortunately it's pretty
    much impossible to sort the truth from the BS that spews forth from the gaping
    maw of Microsoft's horrid marketing department, so I'm reserving judgment until
    January. \r\n\r\nOf course, if someone doesn't reign in the publishers on the
    pricing front, it's never going to matter. Consumers aren't stupid, and they know
    that there's no good reason an ebook often costs as much as a printed version."

    for reading any length of text, but look at what the iPod has done so far. People
    actually watch movies on them now so there could be a market, especially as the
    screens get larger and higher resolution.\r\n\r\nRelated\u2014 in Japan (and growing
    around asia) you can get <a href=\"http://www.wired.com/news/gizmos/0,1452,66950,00.html\">novels

    I was trying to watch a cartoon on my brother's iPod. (He was showing me something
    I should say.) It was very uncomfortable for me.

  body: "\"Not anymore than it can replace the TV or movie theater for watching movies.\"\r\n\r\nWell,
    it actually has begun to chip away at that. You don't even need cable or a TV
    these days...just subscribe to the shows you want to watch, put them on you iPod,
    then watch it on the bus, or hook up the iPod to a TV and watch it full screen.
    \r\n\r\nBut, as for eBooks, that 'revolution' has been smoldering for years. And
    the iPod isn't going to push it over the edge. \r\n\r\nI know sony has an eBook
    reader that has been getting some good praise, but even that hasn't taken off.

  body: "I should clarify - I realize people do watch movies on their iPods - sat
    behind someone watching The Fog of War recently on a bus, but that was the perfect
    movie for the Pod, just talking heads mostly. \r\n\r\nBut you can't just carry
    a movie onto a bus with you the way you can carry a book. Books are kind of perfect
    that way. They really aren't THAT much bigger than iPods. It is hard to improve
    on a book... but I'm in publishing so I'm biased.\r\n\r\nPersonally I'd rather
    have a book-on-tape on my iPod than try to read it on that tiny screen.\r\n\r\nPlus,
    IMHO the real advantage to eBooks is for reference/search/etc functions which
    I can't see the iPod really handling at that size."

    The New York times has a review of the new Sony reader</a>. It sounds a lot better
    than previous ebook readers, but the interface sucks and it needs to interface
    with crappy Windows-only software to work. On the upside, Sony learned a lot from
    the total failure of its Atrac-only digital audio players, so the reader supports
    ebooks, plaintext, Word files (which is has trouble with), and PDF. \r\n\r\n<a

    child of a Nintendo DS and those old flip-top Motorolla two-ways."

    looked at the typographic quality of the text. From what I've seen from early
    screen grabs it's pretty poor with respect to spacing, hyphenation and non-use
    of typographic features (ie. no small caps, OSF's or ligs) but maybe the retail
    verison has improved. Anyone seen it?\r\n\r\nCheers, Si"
