  anyone recommend a very similar typeface that has a light weight?  If you can name
  more than one it would be helpful. I'm using the Lino Gold type library at the moment.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nMartha

  body: "Can anyone recommend a better solution than Fairfield light? \r\n\r\nI used
    Baskerville as body in a dark tan when I established a design that has been applied
    to a dozen different pieces. At the last minute, the body was changed to black
    on a layout, and the result made the type too heavy. I scrambled to come up with
    something suitable for the comp that had to go out in the next half hour. I settled
    on Fairfield light, but it doesn't have as nice an italic as Baskerville. Is there
    a prettier cousin someone can recommend? It has to be a close relation so as not
    to differ too greatly from the other extant pieces.\r\n\r\nThankyou!\r\n \r\nMartha
    H."

    be able to rework this layout after tomorrow. Then Fairfield will forever be employed

    do research for this.\r\n\r\nPlease help me!\r\n\r\nMartha H."

    be light enough for you, or this:\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/ef-typeshop/old-baskerville/light/\r\n"

  body: I guess the problem here is that Monotype Baskerville (is this what you are
    using?) is already very, very light. Much lighter than that would be hard to get!
    (I did a comparison of four Baskerville's last night and it was the lightest,
    I think.)

  body: "I would second taking a look at Monotype Baskerville. The fine strokes in
    the letterforms are fine indeed. The heavier strokes may be too heavy for you.
    But as I remember, I had to increase the weight of it A LOT to get a good printing,
    direct-to-plate, offset lithography, on Natures Natural (a recycled, uncoated
    sheet).\r\n\r\nFrequently, a serif font that is thin will have a lot of \"sparkle\";
    that is, dramatic contrast between the light & heavier strokes. Bauer Bodoni immediately
    comes to mind. "

  body: "Thanks for your input guys. The Old Baskerville you suggest looks as if it
    would solve my dilemma perfectly. I'll see if they're willing to spend a little
    money. \r\n\r\nI know it seems an unlikely problem. I chose Baskerville (you're
    right Charles, it is Monotype) in the first place because it is a lighter typeface!"
