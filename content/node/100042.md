  websites for 9 of the top 10, looking at design and layout. While I was at it, I
  noticed that the text size on nearly all of them was very small -- and column width
  too wide for the small text. And I found that 6 of them used Arial, 1 Verdana, 1
  Trebuchet, and 1 Proxima Nova.\r\n\r\nMY commentary: \"blech.\"\r\n\r\nIf you'd
  care to recommend, I'm interested in your opinion on a great sans typeface for web
  body text. Assume delivery over Typekit, Google Web Fonts, or comparable service.
  Neutral, readable; up-to-date, professional. Used at a slightly smaller size than
  you would probably want to suggest.\r\n\r\nThese sites frequently use the same face
  for Heading and Subheadings -- in other words, the whole page is one face, with
  the exception of the logo (which is whatever). In case that's relevant to your recommendation.\r\n\r\nWhat's
  solid?"

  body: "Well, for \"stingy\" there's always Google Web Fonts. Open Sans's x-height
    (http://www.google.com/webfonts/specimen/Open+Sans) makes it very good at small
    sizes. I like Lato, though. (http://www.google.com/webfonts/specimen/Lato)\r\n\r\nBut
    I already know what I'VE seen. What I really wanna know is, what have YOU seen?
    What do you think are currently some of the best neutral, readable, up-to-date,
    professional sans faces, for body text, for websites targeted to web browsers
    on computer screens?\r\n\r\nI know there's always an \"it depends\" in there,
    but, what do you like these days?"

  body: "Observation: it seems to me the more successful web fonts for body copy are
    all a bit slabby -- with a vertical slab on glyphs like the f, r, c, and so on.
    Tisa is an example of this, and so it skolar.\r\n\r\nDo you think these slabs
    are, um, \"performance oriented\"? Which it to say, the vertical slab on the f,
    for example, would take to hinting better than if the f ended in a thin stroke.\r\n\r\n?"
