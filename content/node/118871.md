body: I just looked at the different Melior fonts over at [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/melior/|myfonts.com]].
  What's the difference between the "Melior Com" and "Melior Pro" and "Melior"? At
  Linotype there seems to be [[http://www.linotype.com/1222/melior-family.html|only
  one]], yet all claim to be from Linotype?

    which is OpenType Postcript and Melior Com which is OpenType TrueType. It\u2019s
    strange as Pro or Com would normally refer to language support and coverage, not
    to the file format."

    poking around I noticed that [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/bitstream/zapf-elliptical-711/|Bitstream\u2019s
    Elliptical]] looks suspiciously close to [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/melior/|Linotype\u2019s
    Melior]]?"

  body: So much to learn, ta <strong>George</strong>! This sounds much like a [[http://typophile.com/node/117317|similar
    discussion regarding Palatino]] a few weeks back, or this thread related to [[http://typophile.com/node/18710|Futura]].
