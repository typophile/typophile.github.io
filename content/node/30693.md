  body: A pdf is a good place to start - look at it after you make it - it will be
    a good indicator of what it may print like. Use high quality print setting and
    all you need will be in the pdf.

  body: These days printers want pdf files optimized for print. Contact your printer
    and ask him for his requirements. You may also have a problem with the print profile
    of your photoshop documents. Ask your printer if you should use sRGB or some other
    format. If you can't access your printer I would make my color moves in LAB color
    format and make them convert the files to the color profile that works with their
    equipment. make sure when they convert to CMYK that they sharpen the black channel
    a bit.

  body: "Depending on the quote from the printers this could change but aiming for
    a basic 4-colour process job, I would make sure that all colours in all elements
    used (including any imported files) are cmyk not spot or rgb (except for any colours
    used to indicate perforations, folds, spot UV or cutter guides which should be
    spot colours and clearly named as to the function of each), that you have bleed
    where necessary, and if you don't take the pdf route make sure you legally include
    the fonts (screen and printer).\r\n\r\nAbove all though, take a fully mocked-up
    colour version of the job at finished size(s) so that you and the printer can
    see exactly what you expect. btw they will sting you for any changes they have
    to make, so do what you can.\r\n\r\nTim"

    with experts in the field. Having gone to several print shops each one ask for
    different material.\r\n\r\nJust because a person asks a question, does not mean
    they do not have any knowledge. \r\n\r\nTry being a little nicer next eh?"

  body: "Tim, your mock up idea is brilliant. I shall use that next time thank you!\r\n\r\nI
    have read that saving things as a pdf is not always the best route as sometimes
    printers want to change something and they can't or in a rare case a bizarre color
    problem. What do you all have to say on that topic?\r\n\r\nHow do I legally include
    the fonts? I have been reading and asking so many questions about font legal issues
    that I am totally perplexed. Isn't th eonly way to legally include a font is to
    actual flatten or embed the font into the image rendering it useless?\r\n\r\nThanks
    to all of you answering these questions. This website is awesome for a newbie
    yet dedicated person!  I have a pile of books I have read yet nothing compares
    to asking live people these simple things. "

  body: "Well you can certainly save more than one version of the file so the font
    isn't useless. When I work in Illustrator I save things usually as layered .ai
    files and then I convert to outline when I give it to the printer. Ditto photoshop,
    save a non-rasterized version as well.\r\n\r\nMost foundries don't let you embed
    the fonts in pdf files without an additional licensing fee. This seems a very
    un-end-user-friendly approach as pdf is the way most people do business these
    days. But you still can, in most cases, do just that."

    how it works. You work with a printer and give them what they want. There's no
    universal standard for this type of thing.\r\n\r\nSince we're not the one specifically
    printing your job, we're not really the one that can answer your question. \r\n"

    explanations than the specific answer.  \r\n\r\nMy personal experience has been
    that every place is different and I din't know if that is to be expected or that
    its the quality of the service from the local shops.\r\n\r\nThanks Guys ! :)"
