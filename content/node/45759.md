body: "Hi. I am new to this forum, so please be patient with me. I am looking for
  a three font combination (maybe only two) for on-screen display.\r\n\r\nOne serif
  that has got a very old, original touch (like Garamond) that looks at 18px and up,
  white on dark background. I like something rather narrow, like the Apple Garamond,
  but I'm not sure about that.\r\n\r\nThen I need an \"Arial replacement\" font that
  works well with the serif font at 12px or maybe even 10px sizes.\r\n\r\nAnd once
  I've those two I would also like to find a decorative font to go with that. Something
  like a 17th century script that looks fine in 18px, haha.\r\n"

  body: "Yes. This is for screen. I have got these fonts as placeholders currently:
    Apple Garamond,  Arial, ITC Zapf Script. And I'm looking for fonts ot replace
    them.\r\n\r\nThe serif and the deco font should convey a feel of being very old.

    for some elements/headers.

  body: "Could you give some more info on the project?\r\n\r\nAt small sizes I would
    use a screen hinted typeface. Maybe one of them websafe fonts might help you out.
    Verdana, or perhaps Geneva? Both differ quite a lot from Arial though.\r\n\r\nBoth
    Adobe Caslon Pro and Adobe Garamond Pro have swash italics, and both ship with
    Creative Suite!"

    be able to use Opentype swashes and ligatures. I will be happy, if I we are able
    to get those two standard fonts working properly in our project.\r\n\r\nAbout
    the project: Its a game project. :-)"
