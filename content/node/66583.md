body: "Nearly every week, students show up to ask questions based on their coursework.
  Some of these questions are plainly an appeal for us to do their work for them and
  should be deleted. Others show that the student has done some work and just needs
  a nudge or a pointer, and those are fine.\r\n\r\nBut the fact remains that these
  student discussions are a species unto themselves. They need their own space. They
  certainly are not \u201Cgeneral\u201D discussions."

  body: Typophile was started as a student project. Students have always been welcome
    here. When I joined Typophile as a student (in its first year), it was hard to
    get any information on type design. It seemed to me that trade secrets were the
    name of the game. Part of the original intent of Typophile was to make typography
    and type design accessible to students and even *gasp* hobbyists. I hope this
    always remains true.

  body: "Students will continue to be welcome. Student <em>questions</em> need their
    own forum. Half the time they are ill-disguised attempts to get us to do their
    homework for them, often at deadline and typically using misspelled, all-lower-case
    postings. I covered this in the bug report, and, Christian, you aren\u2019t really
    responding to it, but that is a classic Typophile dodge."

  body: I agree. A separate forum for student questions is a very good idea, actually
    a very logical one. And implemented in a minutes time?

  body: There should be some guidelines established, both for how students present
    their questions and how they are answered. In my opinion, constructive advice
    in general terms is fine, as is referring toward other research material, and
    I'd say it's fair to call out glaring errors. To the point that it becomes doing
    their homework for them, that is to be prevented. How do we set the limits?
