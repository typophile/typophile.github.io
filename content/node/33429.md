  body: "You're goning to have problems with any \"current\" font-management software
    release. Because font handling is one of the core functions of the operating system,
    it tends to get \"fixed\" or changed with every major update, if only a little.
    Font-management utilities (Extensis' Suitcase/FontReserve/Fusion, Lintoype's FontExplorer,
    Insider Software's FontAgent Pro) all use hooks built into the system to \"fool\"
    it into thinking the fonts they manage are installed in a \"legal\" location,
    and generally intercept calls for fonts made by applications so they can \"auto-open\"
    those fonts that are not currently active. All this tends to change with new OS
    releases.\r\n\r\nYou're likely going to have to find an \"older\" version of one
    of these utilities, released when OS 10.2 was current. Most software I use/have
    installed will not guarantee proper operation under less than OS 10.3.x (Tiger);
    I know that I forced my co-workers to upgrade to 10.3 partly because font-handling
    was so problematic under 10.2.x.\r\n\r\nOn a personal note, I'd stay away from
    Extensis -- tech support is notoriously hideous, and their updates are VERY slow
    in coming... I suspect they got WAY too big for their britches after aquiring
    so many applications over the years. I'd recommend FontAgent Pro (but unfortunately,
    it's current version does not support 10.2).\r\n\r\n"

  body: bump, using suitcase but eh, figured I'd give fontexplorer x a try. Question-
    Does anyone know how to change the Designer, Manufacturer, etc.? The only thing
    I can seem to change is the comment. Please tell me I can. thanks.

  body: 'eh, even though this is fontexplorer - i guess one of the reasons i am trying
    it out is because I can''t seem to do the same thing in suitcase - so...anyone?
    For example, if I right click the menu that allows how to view the fonts in extensis
    - I get Type, Foundry, Class, etc....How can I change the Foundry, Class, etc?
    The only thing I can seem to change is the name of the font. '

  body: "But somehow this was entered into the file then? Sort of like an ID3 tag
    on an MP3- Where I can change the name in my itunes of an artist name but embedded
    into it is an actual ID3 tagging going on. \r\nSo how was this information embedded
    into the files?  i.e.- If I drag say a House Industries font over and the Foundry
    is listed as House Industries OR it is listed as nothing at all- somehow House
    Industries was entered into this font. So how do I do it?"

  body: "MP3 is designed to have an arbitrary number of tags \"tacked on\" to the
    end. Font files are usually a bit more complicated -- see http://www.microsoft.com/typography/otspec/name.htm
    for where foundry information and such is stored.\r\n\r\nThe name table itself,
    and also the entire font file, are checksum-protected against modification. So
    you would need a full OTF (TTF) editor just to change the info; and modifying
    font files is usually against the EULA.\r\n\r\n<cite>If I drag say a House Industries
    font over and the Foundry is listed as House Industries OR it is listed as nothing
    at all..</cite>\r\n\r\nIt depends on what House Industries entered into the field
    \"Manufacturer Name\" (for example -- there are a few more possibilities, I think).
    If they didn't enter their name, FontExplorer won't know what to display for \"Manufacturer\".\r\n\r\nAre
    you thinking of adding your own tags to fonts? FontExplorer can use your own custom
    classification:\r\n\r\n<cite>Classification \u2013 The new classification feature
    allows users to \u201Ctag\u201D their fonts by freely configurable criteria. Additionally
    it can be used to automatically set classification by receiving this data from
    the Linotype Server. The automatic classification is available for all fonts that
    have such an entry in the Linotype database. (<a href=\"http://www.fontexplorerx.com/macreleasenotes/\">http://www.fontexplorerx.com/macreleasenotes/</a>)</cite>\r\n\r\nbut
    this extra information is (presumably, but extremely likely) stored 'outside'
    the actual font, and it does not modifies the real font file."

    FontExplorerX and choosing Classify Fonts will then allow you to \"classify\"
    by Theme, Usage and Category. Not Bad, again thanks for the information - It's
    more than I got from contacting the makers directly!\r\nStill not sure how I will
    organize though as I am pretty anal and some of my fonts are missing Foundry name,
    etc...\r\nBut thanks for your info. I also opened up FontLab to see if I could
    rename, but doesn't look like it. I'm sure there is some sort of software out
    there that will but as for FontExplorer and Suitcase for that matter I think you
    summed up the extent to what you can do."

    could be \"illegal\". Perhaps it would take a little extra legwork to do it properly
    and without ruffling any feathers at the foundry/designer or vendor offices. So
    do the work, Linotype. And while you're at it, how about designing some passable
    icons, creating some custom interface elements, and basically making your application
    less of an eyesore?\r\n\r\nIf I hadn't invested so much time in categorizing my
    fonts in Fontexplorer MANUALLY, I'd probably have switched to Fontcase already."
