  me if I'm posting in the wrong area.  Here's the scoop:\r\n\r\nOur website is www.tallyzip.com\r\n\r\nI
  designed our current logo, and as you can see, my logo skills aren't great. The
  main things I'm hoping to resolve are:\r\n\r\n1. We need a symbol that would fit
  into a small square space (i.e. twitter profile pic)\r\n2. Overall, the current
  logo just isn't very inspired.\r\n\r\nAll of our company information is on our website,
  but feel free to ask me anything.  I'm open to changing colors, type, and of course
  a symbol if you think it makes sense.\r\n\r\nIf you're available and interested
  in the work, please get in touch with me.  If you can give me some idea of cost,
  that would be very helpful.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nNathan"

  body: "Do you have a ceiling for your budget? \r\n\r\nYounger/newer designers often
    feel like they are being asked to low-ball themselves when asked to give a quote
    point blank. To compensate, they often overshoot the mark and scare the client
    away. It\u2019s very conflicting. And a detailed project brief makes a significant
    difference as it often takes hours to develop proper project plan which is a significant
    investment to a professional."
