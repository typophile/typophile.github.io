    Then by calling the company in question. They are closed for the weekend. I then
    checked on whatthefont.com. No luck there. So I googled some more and found this
    forum. So I thought I would ask here. Hrant, it HAS been a while since I've purchased
    a font. What does that have to do with anything? Usually I either have the font
    already or the client sends me the font they want used. I don't get your rudeness,
    it's completely uncalled for. And again, THANK YOU, Mike, you rock.

    ignorance isn't really a robust defense) but: already having pirated fonts doesn't
    make it OK; people aren't supposed to send you (commercial) fonts, not even people
    who are paying you.\r\n\r\nEspecially since I make fonts myself I don't appreciate
    the cavalier attitude you seem to be representing. BTW, FWIW after you mentioned
    MyFonts I decided to give you the benefit of the doubt and reveal the names, Mike
    just beat me to one of them. But that doesn't mean I'm totally OK with where you
    stand (even if you don't fully realize where you stand).\r\n\r\n<blockquote>Did
    anyone in charge here at Typophile appoint you as the enforcer of this creed?</blockquote>\r\n\r\nNo
    de facto or de jure authority whatsoever. All I have is my voice.\r\n\r\nAnd I'm
    not crazy enough to suggest that any font ID should lead to a sale. But commercial
    font <em>usage</em> should.\r\n\r\nAnd let me ask: Are you OK with people taking
    advantage of Typophile and type designers? Don't you see how often that's been
    happening, here of all places? And most of all: What do <em>you</em> want Typophile
    to be? Maybe I think whatever that is stinks? If so, should I try to shut you
    up? I've never done that to anybody here, in 12+ years.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    totally uncalled for. With straight commercial fonts the best we can do is link
    to a legitimate source and hope that it (or an equivalent) is where the font is
    subsequently sourced.\r\n\r\nWe can\u2019t start from an a priori position that
    those posting ID queries are going to get the fonts by some illegitimate means;
    if after the ID is made there\u2019s some direct hint that they are then yeah,
    we should try to educate them that that is theft.\r\n\r\n<strong>Angelz25</strong>,
