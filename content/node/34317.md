  body: It has a very garamond-derivate feeling, something like bitstream elegant
    garamond.

  body: "I think this is not Garamond, or any classic serif. It feels like something
    new, but I can't place it at all. Do you have a sample that shows any other letters,
    like E, J, K, M or W?\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: ">Jan:\r\nSorry:) I checked it a bit fast earlier on one of the first samples(from
    a low resolution portable device actually) and the few letters I saw reminded
    me of elegant garamond. Now seeing the samples again, and the new ones, it's obviously
    not any garamond variation."

  body: "Top job Mike! Am I right with the assumption that it isn't digitally available?\r\nI
    couldn't find it anywhere online. Strangely enough, the book which used the font
    seemed to be relatively recent...\r\n\r\nThanks a lot!"

  body: "I just identify 'em. \r\n\r\nAs far as I can find, this typeface does not
    seem to be available in digital form*. It was the first typeface issued by the
    Word Typeface Center (according to 'Modern Encyclopedia of Typefaces 1960-90'
    by Lawrence Wallis), a company Carnase co-founded, and it came in five weights,
    each with an italic face. The image I showed was a scan from the Wallis Book.
    The book mentions Linotype as a supplier, but Linotype only mentions it as one
    of Tom Carnase's designs in their <a href=\"http://www.linotype.com/362/tomcarnase.html\">designer
    profile</a> on their site. I suspect it was available as film type, since in the
    time period it was designed, I think that was the dominant type format being used.\r\n\r\n-
    Mike Yanega\r\n\r\n[*edit: At least not by this name. One of his other WTC typefaces,
    'Favrile' was digitized as 'Francois' by Brendel (I think), and also as 'Fascinate'
    by NovelFonts, so it's possible that a renamed digital version exists.]"
