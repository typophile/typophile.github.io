body: My original inspiration derived from xerox waste sheets that I found interesting
  imagry on. From this I proceeded to build letterforms out of a specific section
  comprised of three images.  <BR> <BR>The conceptual idea was to try to hold on to
  the destructive quality of xerox duplication and cohesively form a systematic display
  face that can be used at small and large point sizes. <BR> <BR>Any input is greatly
  appreciated,  <BR>Thanks<img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/7447.gif"

  body: 'poor frankie, no posts.  <BR>i think the overall attitude of this is pretty
    visceral, but the thickness of the forms makes it more approachable; like it&#39;s
    gritty but not in a scary way. it&#39;s surprising how well it holds up at that
    12 pt size, which is real nice. i think the 3 needs a clearer middle horizontal
    stroke &#40;not crossbar, but you know...&#41;, the &#34;xero&#34; title has the
    R shifted downward, but it&#39;s higher in the sample below. i think the lower
    position is nicer, and you may try that with a few u.c. and l.c. glyphs for a
    tiny bit more variety. '
