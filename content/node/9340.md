  redesign a journal I publish, starting with the type. I&#39;ve redone the logo as
  per his suggestion &#40;using Caligne&#41; but am now stumped as to which typefaces
  &#40;serif &amp; sans serif&#41; to use for the body text. <BR> <BR>His advice wrt
  to the body text was: &#34;This is a little tome of knowledge that people will want
  to archive in their library. You have a rare voice so your typeface should be somewhat
  rare as well. You are discussing $500 bottles of rare malt whisky. Please choose
  a font that reflects the nature of your journal as well as your slightly irrevernt
  slant. Right now it looks like a secretary set your publication in Word.&#34; <BR>
  <BR>I have been searching for weeks for &#39;rare&#39; type that is not too offbeat
  or quirky, but that has a slight irreverence to it -- and I&#39;m coming up short.
  Some typefaces I like so far include Centaur, Minion, Vendome &#40;too quirky?&#41;,
  Aalborg, Philomena and Leyden &#40;particularly since it comes in serif and sans
  serif&#41;. <BR> <BR>Any suggestions would be most helpful and appreciated. The
  journal&#39;s website is <a href="http://www.singleminded.ca" target="_blank">www.singleminded.ca</a>
  which gives a feel for the &#39;tone&#39; of the writing and subject matter. <BR>
  <BR>tks, Johanna'

  body: 'Johanna, <BR>as a malt lover as well aas typophile: why not try something
    reminding of 17th century designs, like Fred Smeijers&#39; Custodia, DTL&#39;s
    VandenKeere or Elzevir for serif types. DTL&#39;s Haarlemmer has a different character
    but also a companion sans <BR>All these types have in common the sense of tradition,
    craftsmanship and a certain exclusivity all without too much being &#39;in your
    face&#39;. <BR>Hope this get&#39;s you one step further...'

    &#34;Old stylish&#34; text faces both of them. Delicato is made especially to
