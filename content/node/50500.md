body: "alright. I went back to the drawing board with names for my freelance design
  business. I settled on \"ellbee\", which is my initials written phonetically. \r\n\r\nI'm
  working on using just the name as a logo. I haven't really figured out what type
  of symbol to incorporate into the mark if any. After a few rounds of trying out
  different fonts I've narrowed it down to these two and am now playing with color.
  I feel like they are both still lacking but I'm stuck. The marks to the right are
  not meant to be incorporated into the main logo but may be used as secondary design
  elements in my branding.\r\n\r\nbegin critique.\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/ellbee_logo3_5798.gif]"

    be inviting the more familiar connections to the abbreviation the word pound,
    as in weight.

    speaks a lot about you.\r\nThe second one looks like an attempt to be modern.\r\n\r\nRegarding
    the secondary marks I much prefer the first option on the right, simple and clean,
    you can put a circle around it but you don't really need it.\r\nIt can remind
    of a pound sign but it also looks like a \"u\" to me it feels more like a greek
    caracter...\r\n\r\nRegarding colors, well you can do better that what you present
    here...have you thought about an absence of color? maybe a two tone composition
    in b & w ( two shades of grey ) or a carefully chosen color ( maybe a pantone
    ) that you can decline in your communication, hope this helps\r\n\r\n;-)\r\nR.\r\n\r\n\r\nRodrigo

  body: "thanks Rodrigo. for a second i thought everyone was going to get hung up
    on the pound issue. i appreciate the critique and suggestions.\r\n\r\nI've decided
    to let go of the second option and continue perfecting the first. I agree that
    color isn't there yet. it's kind of arbitrary at the moment. i will try out your
    suggestions and post my work soon. \r\n\r\nto address the pound issue since it
    seems to be an important one. I agree, \"lb\" is an abbreviation for pound. and
    alone the symbol may be read that way. but if i can establish a strong enough
    brand i think i can redefine how people read \"lb\". the symbols are not so be
    used by themselves. they would be a secondary element to the logo. if i can establish
    a strong presence in the name ellbee i don't think anyone would read \"lb\" as
    pound. and if they do...well as a friend of mine pointed out...maybe it just symbolizes
    that my design has weight.\r\n\r\nif i seem cranky, sorry. i just thought i would
    get better feedback here. the lack of response is disappointing, aside from rodrigo's."

  body: Nice designs, I like the first version best, as well as it's 2 color versions.
    I'm not 100% sure about the terminal of the l surprinting the black b. It's so
    delicate, it may be tough to trap, and possibly do some funky things when printed.
    The lb does make me think of pounds but what I find more of a challenge is going
    from ellbee to lb. When I sound it in my head of course it makes sense. But it's
    a little jarring visually - in seeing it, the natural inclination is to think
    the initials should be eb. That said, I keep going back and forth between the
    two like it's a private joke, and getting people to spend so much time thinking
    about your logo isn't a bad thing.

  body: 'Regarding the tagline "design solutions": The word "solution" when not relating
    to an liquid mixture of ionized solids in a solvent, or an answer to a specific
    problem, has come in not so recent years to read as a marketing gobbledygook substitute
    for "thing", that is, it is devoid of meaning. If you are a designer who believes
    that you are in the business of solving your clients'' visual communications problems,
    keep the tagline. Otherwise, give it a second thought.'

  body: "kristin- you're probably right about the trapping issue. do you think it
    would be bad to use different versions of the logo? i don't really want to give
    that up and can probably use it for most purposes. maybe i just use a solid colored
    one when printing the logo small. i guess the first step is to see what happens
    when i print it. i appreciate your feedback on using the lb and ellbee together.
    i'll give it some thought. \r\n\r\ncuttlefish- i was actually just trying to brainstorm
    something to replace \"design solutions\". the reason i chose solutions is because
    through my experiences, one thing i've come to realize that defines me is my passion
    for solving problems. any type of problem really, but especially in my field.
    but you are right about the marketing gobbledygook, i know since i just left a
    marketing firm who used \"creative solutions\". i'm having trouble coming up with
    something else. i'm leaning away from something generic like \"designs\", \"graphic
    design\", etc. I don't know. Any suggestions? Should I just go with \"Print &
    Web Design\"?\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Choices...mmmm \r\n\r\nThe first group of designs looks more straight foward\r\nThe
    second one more creative and free, but, I don't think the spacing between characters
    is correct, some fine tunning needed.\r\n\r\nPersonally I rather do simple and
    clean so I would keep the first group probably option right on the second row
    & left on the third row.\r\n\r\nRegarding color, this is the best of the options
    you presented earlier, but, to me it looks very institutional, too proper and
    not necessarily stylish or modern, ( this might be a good thing , I don't know
    what kind of clients you wish to attrack )\r\n\r\nAlso some of the coloring options
    you present are quickly dismissed because they make you read something that just
    isn't there, such as 3rd row right which reads \"el bee\" \"el\" being \"the\"
    in spanish, not sure an image of a spanish bee is what you are trying to communicate...lol\r\n\r\nDesign
    solutions is by far more stylish that print & web design , print & web sounds
    more narrow less creative etc...\r\n\r\nDesign alone might be a good option, or

    spelling but it seems others like the original \"ellbee\" better. So, here's a
    version of both with the original \"e\"s and with the small tap removed. I really
    liked that characteristic of the \"e\" but I also agree that it doesn't work at
    a small size. Would it be weird to have an alternate logo for printing at a small
    size? \r\n\r\nI've come up with a quick mockup so you can see the two different
    spellings in action. The left has the tap on the \"e\" while the right doesn't.
    \r\n\r\nKirsten, I agree about using the black over the color, luckily I also
    think it looks best that way anyhow. Two me, with the syllables in two different
    colors it plays up the idea that it standing for the intials anyhow. \r\n\r\nThanks

    Though, you have to slightly kern the pairs <strong>el</strong> and <strong>ee</strong>
    tighter, because the customization of the <strong>e</strong> has made small gaps
