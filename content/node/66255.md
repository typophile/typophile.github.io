body: "Sumner Stone is publishing some very interesting articles on type & letterforms
  history and practice in his \"Alphanet Journal\" online. I have found the latter
  two of particular interest:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.stonetypefoundry.com/warpwoof1.html\r\n\r\nhttp://www.stonetypefoundry.com/letterslost1.html\r\n\r\nOne
  of the most interesting facet in both writings is Stone's growing concern towards
  pre-Roman letter shapes, an unlikely approach in today's typography, I guess."
