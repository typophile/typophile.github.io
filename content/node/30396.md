  pretty sure I came accross it before, but now I can't remember the name. The seven
  should be a hint. Thanks for any help."

  body: "Are these recreations of LCD displays on the front of buses? If so, it's
    probably a proprietary font of the LCD sign. Univers might get you close, but
    there are some obvious differences (G, t, 7, etc.).\r\n\r\n - Lex"

  body: Actually, these are not LCD displays. The old buses still have them, and you'll
    see the newer buses (with electronic signs) more often.

    had some weights/widths that were in the ballpark too.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

    anyone to confirm my discovery.
