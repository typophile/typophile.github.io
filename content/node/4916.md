body: Hi... new to the boards here. I follow a lot of threads but this is my 1st post.  <BR>
  <BR>Ive always found it a bit of challange to design club flyers... it always seems
  as if the promoter wants to add these massive bios and jam as much information u
  can possibly image onto a 4x4 hand out. I was wondering if anyone here does these
  quickturnaround type designs for fun or for clients. Here are 2 flyers ive recently
  done for a night here in chicago...  <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/36696.jpg"

  body: Hey there... Im not so keen on the green flyer. Seems to be to &#34;ordinary&#34;
    and maybe not quite finished. Especially when I see what you are able to do with
    the bottom flyer - which is REAL NICE... so cool... Keep it up Anthony... <BR>
