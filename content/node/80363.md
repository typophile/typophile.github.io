  who can write with a similar style as the one on \"Penfolds logo\".\r\n\r\nDo you
  know someone who can do this?\r\n\r\n\r\nhere's the sample:\r\nhttp://womensmuseumca.org/images/SponsorImages/Penfolds%20Logo.jpg\r\n\r\nThanks
  in advance :)"

    has some really nice work but as you said, I don't think it fits the style.\r\n\r\nAs
    for Gerard... it may work, I'll take it in consideration, thanks :)"

    and we wont use a calligraphy after all.\r\n\r\nThank you all for your suggestions
    and samples, I appreciate it! I will contact you guys again if I can."
