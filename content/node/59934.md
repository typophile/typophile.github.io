body: I'm looking for a sans serif with a "long" f in small case, what I meen is an
  f that goes below the other letters. There seem to be many like this in italic but
  i'm looking for this in a regular cut. Sorry for the weird explanation but I dont
  now the word for this style, if there is one. I know Anivers and Fedra has this
  kind of small case regular f.

    (Sans)</a>', by Peter Bi\u013Eak (Typotheque), would be the first that comes to
    mind, as well. (And one great typeface, on top of that.)"

  body: I just noticed that Martin Majoor's Telefont has this kind of f. A small sample
    can be seen in [[http://www.typotheque.com/articles/my_type_design_philosophy|this
    article]].
