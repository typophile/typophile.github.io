body: Hi <BR> <BR>I am organising a charity project to raise the cash to build two
  orphanages for kids with Aids in Africa. <BR> <BR>The project &#39;Building Letters&#39;
  will sell 1000 limited edition CD-ROM&#39;s to raise the cash to do this. But we
  need help to make this CD a must have.  <BR> <BR>So Iam asking the good people of
  typophile to offer fonts to put on the CD-ROM. <BR> <BR>Details of the project can
  be found on <a href="http://www.buildingletters.org" target="_blank">http://www.buildingletters.org</a>
  , but basically apart from the cost of postage and pressing the CD-ROM, every penny
  gets handed over to a registered UK charity which manages the finances of building
  these orphanges, these kids get a better life and you get to feel good about yourself.
