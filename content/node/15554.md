    remember its name. :^/

  body: "Classic in the sense that Letraset or Mecanorma must have sold a lot of transfersheets
    of this font. It was everywhere in the seventies. But for the love of \u2026 I
    can't remember it's name. Need more zinc in my diet, I guess.\r\n\r\nBTW The ligatures
    and other fancy stuff is custom, built out of existing elements (something that
    was very easy to do with transfertype)."
