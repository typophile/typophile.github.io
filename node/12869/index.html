<div class="post-content e-content" itemprop=articleBody>Hello to everybody,
I was thinking on this day, in which i am building my website to sell my font designs, to get a deal with an ecommerce service like e-sellerate. They get a 10 percent of the sales, and send them at the end of the month with a check. Checks here in Chile spends 3 weeks in been verified by a bank so its very slow. Wire transfers are slow and cost us$40 aprox.
I think western union its the most fast and secure way to receive money direct from my customers, but i dont know if some typographer of foundry use this method. Dod you know someone?
WU costs 10% to the customer. My idea is to receive the transfer code and email from customer, and then send an email to them in the same day.
Do you think that customers will use this method? i think its more direct and its secure too but i dont know what customers will think about it. In fact any can send money via WU, no need to use a credit card and WU exists in almost any city..
Cheers,
Miguel Hernández.

<div class=commentbody>Hi Miguel,
I would not use Western Union, they have earned a bad rep because a lot of scammers are using their services. This might not be their fault, but then there are other services to consider, the biggest one being Paypal.
You can set up your website to collect payments through Paypal and offer the fonts to download immediately after Payment has cleared, so you don't have the to send emails manually and people can get their fonts any time of the day.
Paypal sure has it's problems too, but after coding some sites for clients, I have to say it's the best choice as of now.
Cheers,
The Giraffe</div>

<div class=commentbody>Hi Giraffe,
In Southamerica Paypal only works in Mexico for Withdrawl funds. www.paypalsucks.com explain some problems with this system too.

<div class=commentbody>Hey Miguel,
First off, I'm very excited to hear you are going to consolidate your designs under your own brand. In my opinion, this is long overdue.
The service you describe sounds expensive to me. 10% of sales is pretty high, and the fact that they hold your money until they decide to send it to you, less their fee, is also undesirable.
Have you looked into verisign's payflow pro? It's a bit more difficult to implement an SSL certificate, and a bit more expensive to set up a merchant account at your bank, but once you go through the initial expense and hassle, you get a much better system that you control, and you only lose a percent or two per sale to bank fees and credit card fees.
But most importantly, you get access to your sales the day after they occur. That's pretty quick, and no one is holding your funds hostage.
I agree that Paypal leaves a lot to be desired. But, there are a lot of casual web users that use Paypal extensively. You'll probably make more sales if you offer Paypal as an option. But, I wouldn't go with them exclusively.
That said, I don't offer PP as an option at MT.
Also, check out GoDaddy's SSL certificates. They're much cheaper than Verisign's solutions, but there are compromises in the service that make me slightly uneasy. However, depending on your needs, they might offer the best balance of performance and price.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Miguel,
Why not open a Merchant Account with your bank which will allow you to accept credit cards as payment. Your bank should also be able to recommend an on-line payment gateway that they accept. Depending on the credit cards you accept, the "discount" they charge (discount is their clever term for fee) can range from around 3.5% and up. There are monthy minimums, but you just have to look at those fees as part of the "rent" for your online store.
