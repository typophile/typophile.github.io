body: Hi Guys, <BR> <BR>New member so this is my first post. <BR> <BR>I&#39;m looking
  for a little inspiration for a current project.  <BR> <BR>Basically I need some
  visuals for backgrounds on a kiosk. Categories are as follows - Email - Web Search
  - Chat - Games all the content is online delivered via ADSL.  <BR> <BR>I have actually
  designed this service 2 times previously &#40;both had a life of about 1.5 years&#41;
  and am now doing a complete redevelopment. So finding it a little difficult to reinvent
  for a third time.  <BR> <BR>I&#39;m looking for more abstract imagery rather then
  the typical.  <BR> <BR>Could be done in photography but moving more towards illustration
  or maybe even a mix.  <BR> <BR>Any ideas???
