body: I was just reading a handgun publication and inside there was a story about
  the Browning/Colt 1911 pistol. In this article, the author stated that among other
  companies, Lanston Monotype had a contract with the US Government to manufacture
  1911&#39;s during WWII. Apparently their contract was cancelled before they made
  any.  <BR> <BR>This got me wondering if type foundries in the past have manufactured
  products other than type.  <BR>Anyone have any information about that?

  body: 'Well, at the very beginning punchcutters were recruited from the goldsmithy
    trade, because they had experience engraving metal. Also, since type involved
    melting metal, naturally there was a synergy with certain industrial fields. For
    example, Antwerp was famed for its forged crossbow &#34;leaf springs&#34;, and
    later for making rifle parts, and subsequently for type. And come to think of
    it, this might be related to Caslon, since he started off by engraving rifles,
    and then came his derivations of Dutch type! <BR> <BR>Baskerville: <BR>His great
    success in the japanning trade basically financed his typographic efforts. And
    although there was no <i>material</i> synergy between the two that I can see,
    some experts on Baskerville point out the &#34;ideological&#34; parallels between
    japanning and Baskerville&#39;s style of type. <BR> <BR>hhp'

    <BR> <BR>As far as I know, Agfa only went into the type business with its purchase
    of Compugraphic in 1988. But since we were talking earlier about the involvement
    of both the American and English Monotype companies in armament manufacturing
    during the two world wars, it may be appropriate to note that Agfa was a member
    of IG Farben conglomerate &#40;and is today owned by Bayer, one of the other members
    of IG Farben&#41;. Among other war crimes for which IG Farben was found culpable
    were the use of concentration camp labour and production of the Zyklon B pesticide
    used in the gas chambers in the extermination camps. After the war, several IG
    Farben officials received prison sentences at the Nurenberg trials, and the conglomerate
    was broken up into its original constituent companies. Of these, Agfa, BASF and
    Bayer remain in business.

  body: With regard to Linotype, it is important to remember that the identity of
    Linotype as a specifically German company is a relatively recent development.
    For most of its history, it was largely an American and British business, which
    established a continental presence through relations with French and German foundries.
    I don&#39;t know much about the activities of the major German foundries -- Berthold,
    Stempel, Haas -- during WWII, but I do have the very nice Berthold Hebrew type
    specimen from 1924.

  body: Thank you John, for that clarification. I&#39;m 99% sure that Linotype itself
    did very little Nazi business. Haas was based Basel, outside of Germany in Switzerland,
    so they certainly weren&#39;t using slave labor like IG Farben was. Stempel and
    Klingspor were still separate during the war. They, as well as L&amp;M, Berthold,
    Bauer, etc. probably profited from the Nazi&#39;s typographic whims. After 1933,
    there was in increase in thing being printed in Fraktur type. Around 1936, all
    of the foundries realeasesd modern-Frakturs, which in my opinion are some of the
    ugliest typefaces ever designed

    the same sort of thing happens in the US now, in effect linking American companies

    they were winning the war, and were very concerned with their image abroad. In
    the occupied &#40;and unoccupied&#41; countries, they wanted the people to read
    German newspapers. Trouble was, no one could read them! They came up with a ridiculous
    excuse, saying the Schwabacher &#40;the forerunner of the Fraktur style&#41; was
    invented by the Jews. <BR> <BR>The letter is quite famous, it was concidently
    typed up on a sheet who letterhead was stil in Fraktur. Here is a free translation

    3, 1941 <BR> <BR>Announcement, not for publication  <BR>For general information,
    I hereby report on the order of the F&uuml;hrer:  <BR> <BR>The so-called Gothic
    type style, seen as a symbol of German writing, is false. In actuallity, the so-called
    Gothic type can be traced to the Schwabacher-Jewish letters. Just like they later
    occupied the newspapers, the Jews slowly took over the the printing of books and
    publishing houses in Germany, from these actions stemmed the powerful influence
    of the Swabacher-Jewish letters. <BR> <BR>Today, in a discussion with the Reichsleiter,
    Herr Amann, and Herr Adolf M&uuml;ller, the Reich printing office owner, the F&uuml;hrer
    decided that the country&#39;s official type style should be Antiqua [serif typefaces].
    As soon as possible, printed matter should begin to be made with these typefaces.
    When it is possibly, school books should also be reprinted, and in town schools
    and community colleges, this type of writing should be taught exclusively. <BR>
    <BR>The authorities responsible will see to it that government agencies shall
    stop using the Schwabacher-Jewish letters: official certificates, street signs,
    and other such things will now only be finished in the new official typefaces.
    <BR> <BR>Per order of the F&uuml;hrer, Reichsleiter Herr Amann will see to it
    that all newspapers and magazines, especially those in foreign circulation, or
    which should be in circulation abroad, switch over to the new official type. <BR>
    <BR>signed,  <BR>M. Bormann <BR> <BR> <BR>I shouldn&#39;t have to say that the
    grounds for this letter were entirely false, and fabricated! There is no link

    design has played a large part in the fact that the Nazis are always considered
    the worst. Granted, the efficiency and systems created for such atrocoties were
    scary enough. But there is such a huge visual aura that surrounds the Nazis. For
    instance, the Soviet &#34;police&#39; &#40;as they were murdering people under
    Stalin&#41; as far as I know, DID NOT use a Death&#39;s Head icon on their uniforms.
    Is that uniquely German? This awareness of the power of symbols or graphic elements?
    I think that this &#34;visual identity&#34; certainly enhances the narrative of
    things like Schindler&#39;s List, or The Pianist, or even the US Holocaust Museum.

    lucky to have is the swastika! A singular, distinctive visual thing that so perfectly
    encapsulates their [erstwhile] enemy. It&#39;s just a damn shame it used to mean
    the opposite in so many noble ancient cultures. Compared to the swastika, blackletter
    will be a piece of cake to revive in a positive light!  :-/ <BR> <BR>hhp

  body: I just want to make one thing clear here. Some people might counter my last
    post saying that the swastika is a great universal, historical symbol &#40;which
    is was&#41;, and that I &#40;or others&#41; are only arguing that it should remain
    in history&#39;s dustbin because it remains such a powerful movtivator for things
    like Zionism, which many people in the world are against. <BR> <BR>Let&#39;s please
    not get into a discussion about Judaism or the Middle East. Even without the tragedy
    of the genocide of the Jewish people during the Holocaust, I think that enough
    evil could be assigned to the swastika to have it left in history&#39;s dustbin.
    At least 6 million Jews died in the Holocaust, but most likely another 5 million
    people died in concentration camps as well, and all in all, 50 million people
    died in the second world war, most of them civilians. One could easily argue that
    the Nazi party was responsible for a great deal of this, and is therefore evil.
    So, even if we leave Judaism out of the argument, the swastika is still bad. It
    has too much blood on it. <BR> <BR>I really like the topics of foundries, industry,
    and blackletter type. I don&#39;t want to start a flame war about religion, the
    holocaust, racism, or any of that in this thread. If anyone would like to discuss
    their feelings about Zionism, the Republican party, Islam, or anything else in
    any of those directions, I&#39;d glady contribute to that discussion, but in another
    thread.

    I guess that my point was (a year ago) that there are people who do NOT find Naziism
    repulsive. That it was scares me. If everybody in the world found it repulsive,
    then yeah OK, use the symbol again. Lots. No one would be offended. \r\n\r\nBut
    I'm afraid that distaste Naziism is only really limited to the West. And even
    there, one groups that don't seem to hate it so much, e.g., some parts of Saxony
    and Brandenburg in Germany, who last year elected an obscene number of \"Nationalists\"
    into their state parliaments\u2026 these people make the same arguments, mainly
    that the swastika is a noble ancient symbol, blah blah blah. They also argue that
    the Holocaust never happened (or at least wasn't nearly as bad as the Allied bombing
    of Germany, or the American campaigns to destroy American Indians, or any other
    human atrocity, or or or\u2026 main thing to do is change the subject so that
    no one notices that you are trying to come up with ways to kick all the immigrants

    either. And I wish that Turkey (or Japan, or\u2026) would follow post-war Germany's
    example relatively good example of attempting to make reparations with its neighbors
    and victims.\r\n\r\nThe Holocaust may not be the \"worst\" human atrocity ever
    committed, but it probably is near the top\u2026 but can you even calculate the
    \"top\"? Anyway, it was the best documented, I think. Since the Nazis themselves
    (and the Allies) kept such meticulous records, the Holocaust can serve as a lesson
    and a warning for all future generations.\r\n\r\nIf there were any ONE symbol
