		<div class="commentbody">Actually, TT curves need more total points, period, for reasonably equivalent curves in all but a few simple cases. However, it's certainly true that most conversion approaches tend to use more points than one might think necessary in an attempt to get a closer match to the original. This occurs because you can't make a perfect match to cubic curves with quadratic curves (though you can going the other direction). <BR> <BR>Contrary to what Hrant suggests, it is my experience that auto-hinted TrueType generally does not render as well as auto-hinted Type 1. You can of course do a lot more with manual TrueType hinting, but when we're talking simple conversions without manual work, yes, the rendering generally suffers. Even if you do it in FontLab. Turning on anti-aliasing for all sizes will help, though. <BR> <BR>T</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I guess any conversion entails a loss of efficiency*, which accounts for both the increase in points and the decrease in hinting quality. But doesn't the same thing happen the other way? Take a good TT font, convert it to PS, and you'll end up with more points and worse rendering. So I suspect it depends on the quality of the conversion most of all. <BR> <BR>* Are you sure PS to TT is lossless? <BR> <BR>As for on-screen rendering quality, it's pretty clear to me that the TT algorithms are much better - it's just that it's harder to take proper advantage of them. Like stickshift versus automatic transmission. Certainly in Windows, PS rendering is the pits - and on the Mac you had bitmaps to help out - although no longer, since they've now adopted the full-fuzz delusions. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR></div>

		<div class="commentbody">No, this isn't a matter of &quot;loss of efficiency.&quot; Given a constant em square, the cubics used by PostScript are a higher order math than the quadratics used by TrueType. They are a superset. You can go the one way losslessly, and not the other. <BR> <BR>I'm taking it from this discussion that you have never read my article on font formats. It's available in various locations, including here: <BR><a href="http://www.font.to/downloads/TT_PS_OT.pdf" target="_blank"><a href="http://www.font.to/downloads/TT_PS_OT.pdf">http://www.font.to/downloads/TT_PS_OT.pdf</a></a> <BR> <BR>There's no question that *if* one puts manual hinting work in, TrueType will look better than Type 1 in Windows in apps that use the OS rendering. It also helps if the developer manually fixes up the outlines, if they were converted from Type 1. However, we're talking about automated conversions. In such cases, they generally look the same as or worse than the original. <BR> <BR>So, yes, the TrueType format has a bazillion capabilities that Type 1 lacks. But hardly any of these get used particularly well in simply converted fonts that have not had any manual work. Even with pretty good converters, it has always been my observation that Type 1 fonts converted to TrueType render about equally well at best, and generally look worse. <BR> <BR>When you're talking Apple's current OS X rendering, it's not at all clear to me that there is any reason that even superhinted TrueType should fare any better than auto-hinted Type 1. <BR> <BR>Regards, <BR> <BR>T <BR></div>

		<div class="commentbody">Back on the Type 1 to TrueType angle again, I should add that my comments about TT autohinter quality are solely for the readily available retail-priced solutions. Various companies have proprietary or high-end TT autohinters that may do a significantly better job. Ditto the outline conversion. <BR> <BR>Now, going from TrueType to Type 1, the outlines aren't harmed any, and the readily available auto-hinters are pretty good (and likely to improve more soon). But mostly it depends on how well hinted the TrueType was, and the particular imaging environment. Getting worse and getting better are both pretty plausible outcomes, as is &quot;different but equal.&quot; <BR> <BR>Cheers, <BR> <BR>T</div>
