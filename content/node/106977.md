  a sexy, bold font.\r\nClient wants her whole body on the cover. Problem I think
  is that it looks fine if you are looking at it, while holding in your hand; but
  won't stand against competition on an Amazon page. Any suggestions for a better
  bold, sexy sans serif for title, would be appreciated.\r\n\r\nWould love valid criticism
  and suggestions besides it looks amateur...\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/CEOofyou2F_3458.jpg]"

  body: "That's a tough one, MissDaisy. There are three ways that I see you can approach
    this:\r\n\r\n1) Use the same image but move and rotate it so that it looks as
    though she's leaning on the right edge. This will give her a business casual \"You\"
    feel. A little more personal and approachable. The arms crossed and the dominating
    presence is intimidating... truly not working as a friendly authority.\r\n\r\nNow
    you have room on the left side to play with the type flush left.\r\n\"Center-type
    is a convention best remaining in poetry.\" my art director would say...\r\n\r\n2)
    Find a new image in the shoot where she's not crossing her arms. Perhaps one that
    looks like she's pulling you aside for a pep-talk.\r\n\r\n3) Pitch a whole new
    idea after you do exactly what she wants and give her the best damn sales pitch
    on why your idea is superior."

    Took at this in grayscale or black/white to see where some readability issues
    are:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/ScreenShot1_3647.png]"

  body: "GREAT COMMENTS! Thank you..The art is not a good place to start...budget
    deal...you know?\r\n\r\nYeah..I'm finding the same conflicts with the crossed
    arms..Did do a comp with her face off to the right and type flush left. She posted
    it on her FB...which was kind of kick...Everyone liked the full body pose....hmm...those
    are her clients.  \r\n\r\nRegarding the conflict of type and readability across
    her arms...that's why I was thinking of going to a strong sans serif that will
    dominate over her lower \"extemeties.\""

  body: "Here's what I would do.\r\nFor \"CEO\" and \"YOU\" use the small caps from
    the new font Baghadeer http://www.typophile.com/node/106934 in either regular
    or bold as appropriate. For \"of\" use the same font in the illustrated book cover
    or the script from Baghadeer. No gradient, this will fix the contrast issue. Just
    use the same blue that is used for the author's name.\r\nI would make \"CEO\"
    and \"YOU\" the same size. And don't try to put \"of\" behind stuff. Just place
    that word in it's normal place so you can read it on Amazon.\r\nI think the picture
    is okay. This author is giving some tough, straight talk to the buyer. Test and
    see if you can read the subtitle at Amazon size. Decide whether you need to read
    this (the subtitle) on Amazon or not."
