  body: "News Gothic custom. The headlines in Dwell magazine are News Gothic with
    \ Proforma for text. The News Gothic may have been customized a little by Mike
    Abbink (of FF Kievit fame), whose wife, Jeanette Hodge, was Dwell\u2019s first
    art director. Maybe Mike tweaked the logo.\r\n\r\n"
