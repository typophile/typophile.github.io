    probably extended 'GEFORCE GTX\" lettering to keyable fonts and lighter weights.
    Didn't find any track online either. If you still need the name at least, may
    be sharing more information on your sample might be helpful like the origin.\r\nAlternatives:

      you will be able to find more samples of it here, tho they're all images.\r\n\r\nHere
      is another use of the typeface.\r\n<img src=\"http://shield.nvidia.com/images/shield-logo.png\"><p><img

      also found this guideline (http://international.download.nvidia.com/partnerforce-us/Logos/way-its-meant-played/GeForce-Notebook-Brand-Guidelines.pdf)
      but they don't mention the typeface used here. Hope this is helpful."

    add [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/type-type/ttsquares|Squares]] TT to the list."
