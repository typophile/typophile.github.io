  typeface, Zetta Serif?\r\n\r\n- I think the 'square design' of the letter forms
  have been carried too far, in an attempt to look trendy ... or maybe I am mere tired
  of this trend in design?\r\n\r\n- I find the lower-case g a problem - wouldn't it
  be too cluttered in bold, extra bold - and in small sizes?\r\n\r\n"
