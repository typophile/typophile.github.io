  body: "This is from the IBM (now InfoPrint Solutions Company)AFP Core Interchange
    Fonts. You have an example of the GT series (Gothic Text). The specific name would
    be dependent on font size; for example GT10 would be Gothic Text 10 Point.\r\n\r\nThese
    fonts were created in the late 1970s by IBM for mainframe based printing. The
    GT series, particularly GT10, are probably amongst the single most used fonts
    of the last 30 years because of their widespread use in transactional documents
    such as billing. To my chagrin, I recognized this typeface immediately. This means
    that I am getting too old. Even the online copy of IBM's old \"About Face\" font
    documentation is a bad scan, rather than a true electronic copy: http://publibfp.boulder.ibm.com/epubs/pdf/s4435165.pdf
    \r\n\r\nI don't know where to get a TT, PS, or OT version of this font, although
    people used to transform them all the time as PCs started taking over from mainframes."
