    of my favourite fine artists and one of my favourite type designers together,

  body: You like Idlewild (great typeface, well done) and you like Kehinde Wiley (thank
    you for introducing me to a great artist; once again, well done). What was the
    purpose of doing either? When you have posted serious questions in the past they
    have been left hanging with no follow up from you and then you post this for no
    clear reason. Is it guerilla publicity for H&F-J? If so, why have you regurgitated
    their publicity material? If you are merely expressing your admiration of the
    typeface, could you have elaborated? Was there a thought process? I am intrigued...

    how many glyphs it has and how many languages it supports.  367 glyphs, but no

    a fair bit of thought and testing to keep it from looking motocross. Of course,
    there's nothing wrong with work.\r\n\r\nThere's definitely room in the world for

    are accuratly considered lowercase?  I mean basically it sounds like you're saying
    upper and lowercase don't have anything to do with majuscules and miniscules anymore,
    but are more of just a label for what is located in a certain range in unicode?  And
    if uppercase is what you get when you press the shift key, is the at synmbol the
    uppercase for the number 2?  Still very confused.
