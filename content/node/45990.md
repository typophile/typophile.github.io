  what sans-serifs work best for body text?\r\n"

  body: I think Myriad works well. Gotham, Avenir, Frutiger, Gill Sans, should all
    work ok. I would avoid anything overtly geomertic like Futura or Avante Garde.

  body: As I've advocated on other threads, Linotype Syntax with oldstyle figures
    is the best of all sans text faces, mainly because the base weight is so well
    judged, just a tad lighter than so many other starting weights, so it has just
    a tad more delicacy than its competitors. The sans faces mentioned by Chris above,
    though excellent, do not offer oldstyle figures (except for one version of Futura
    from Berthold) and nowadays all my clients demand oldstyle figures. That's a shame,
    especially with Avenir, which otherwise I adore. Josh Darden's Freight Sans is
    a good alternative to Gill Sans because it does offer default-loaded oldstyle
    figures while maintaining a similar look. Check that one out too.

  body: "I guess what rubs me the wrong way about your posts, John, is that you phrase
    your opinions as though they were objective fact. The fact is, you prefer Syntax,
    and I can't see why, now that it's 2008 and so many other options have appeared
    since Syntax. Syntax starts to look weird and clumsy at large sizes, and has a
    limited range of weights. It's a pure humanist sans, like Caspari, Bliss, Freight
    Sans, Haarlemmer Sans, Scala Sans, etc, with the typical low contrast. The more
    modulated options like Legacy Sans, Amira, Beorcana, Optima Nova, Chianti and
    Argo are better for longer text.  \r\n\r\nOften I get the feeling that you resist
    even appreciating new designs because they represent a financial outlay. When
    people ask for recommendations, their concerns and budget may be different from
    yours. \r\n\r\nChris: Avenir is overtly geometric. It's been called \"the better
    Futura\" and is even named to pay homage to Futura. Gotham isn't all that readable
    either; what it has going for it is its big x-height and wide, open shapes. Still
    pretty monoline and not very humanist. \r\n\r\nFor yet another addition to the
    world of humanist sans faces, see [[http://www.linotype.com/5300/berlingnovasans.html|Berling
    Nova Sans,]] an addition to the updated Berling family by Linotype. "

    plain wrong. Both <a href=\"http://www.linotype.com/53781/frutigernext-family.html\">Frutiger</a>
    and <a href=\"http://www.linotype.com/90672/avenirnext-family.html\">Avenir</a>
    are available with old-style figures, in their \u2018Next\u2019 incarnations.
    <a href=\"http://www.adobe.com/type/browser/P/P_1706.html\">Myriad</a> of course
    has osf, too. And there\u2019s even a <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/singles/monotype/gill_sans_book_sc_osf/\">Gill
    Sans</a> with osf. (The latter should be proof enough that the availability of
    osf is not the sole and crucial criterion for  choosing a text face.)"

  body: "As requested, I'm giving my own opinion, Crossgrove...perhaps you can do
    so too without personally abusing other posters.\r\n\r\nI've used Legacy Sans
    for long texts but find it too low-slung, which of course was intentional in order
    to match its serif version.  \r\nI'm also using newer sans with more funky details
    like Anivers and really liking them, but they may be too edgy to recommend more
    widely.\r\n\r\nThanks Florian for those osf updates...OpenType is now starting
    to fill glyph gaps at long last...very encouraging indeed."

  body: "I think when it comes to choosing a typeface, you have to consider a lot
    more that humanist or geometric, personal abuse or delicacy of a font -- put them
    to test.\r\n\r\nI agree that as a rule, a humanist style sans is a great choice,
    and I would definitely  begin with that. But grab a couple old stand-by's (like
    gill sans, helvetica, syntax, myriad, and so on) and see what feel right.\r\n\r\nOne
    other thing to consider is the other typefaces you are using. What serif fonts
    are you using?\r\n\r\nGood luck,\r\n\r\nEvan\r\n<a href=\"http://evanmade.com/\">evanmade(dotcom)</a>"

  body: Agree with Evan...often, it's not a choice of sans-serif alone, because in
    your design work a serif may be doing the primary work, leaving you to choose
    a matching sans for sidebars and secondary uses. Another reason I often favor
    Syntax is how well it matches and blends with the serifs my clients use. But there
    are also some funkier choices on the market worth looking at too--Anivers, Prokyon,
    and Giacomo, which offer fresh subtle details not always found on older sans classics,
    and these blend better with serifs for that very reason. You'll have a lot of
    fun researching such choices.
