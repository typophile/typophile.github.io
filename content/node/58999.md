body: I made this poster for my mom's birthday and I just wanted some feed back on
  what you think I should re-work and if the type is working well with the image as
  a whole. Any and all feedback would be great![img:sites/default/files/old-images/mami_rooster_3596.jpg]

  body: "I like the warm, tapestry-like feel, but the type looks a little too industrial.
    I'd use a little softer-looking face, and use a color from your rooster palette
    (maybe one of the darker blues or reds). \r\nHappy birthday to your mom!"

  body: Yes, picking up a color from the graphic might go a long way towards integrating
    the text.
