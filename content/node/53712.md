  body: "This is a font I made at college last year. We were asked to design a visual
    identity for Hillary Clinton to be used in the United States democratic election
    campaign, but I chose to design a font based on the Stars & Stripes instead. I
    did make the font strong yet feminine so that it would fit her, but it is primarily
    designed using the flag as a grid. I am not finished designing the font, but given
    the challenge I couldn't resist posting it here.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/starsandstripes_3679.jpg]\r\nMore

  body: "[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Rodeo_5514.png]\r\n\r\nHere's a quick
    try out of an idea. The concept is that all the full caps will feature the star
    somewhere in their design. I think the star could be bigger. Small caps for lower
    case looks OK but it might be worth trying true lower case too. Any other suggestions
    gratefully accepted.\r\n\r\nAlso, this is my first post on Typophile. Hello everyone!"
