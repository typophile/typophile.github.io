  body: The only reference I found said  FORMATT was the name of a company that made
    press-on type, it was not the name of a typeface. <BR> <BR>Are you thinking of
    <a href="http://www.bertholdtypes.com/adobe_lib/080218000.html" target="_blank">Berthold
    Formata</a>?

  body: 'Formatt was offered by Identikal Fonts once upon a time &#40;2002&#41;. It
    is referenced here about halfway down the page: <BR> <BR><a href="http://www.fontlover.com/archive/2002_02_01_fontscoop_archive.html"
    target="_blank">http://www.fontlover.com/archive/2002_02_01_fontscoop_archive.html</a>
    <BR> <BR>You might try to contact Identikal directly. I did not find it offered
    on the website though. <BR> <BR><a href="http://www.identikalshop.com/" target="_blank">http://www.identikalshop.com/</a>
    <BR> <BR>Good luck! <BR> <BR>-C'
