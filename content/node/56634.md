  body: The logo itself is almost certainly custom, but they use a number of other
    fonts on their products (for example, the text "micro-sculpting cream" in <a href="http://www.madisonmag.com.au/images/mad/MustHave/regenerist_465.jpg">this
    image</a> is in <a href="http://www.fonts.com/findfonts/hiddengems/eras.htm">ITC
    Eras</a>). Please post an image if you want a more specific ID.
