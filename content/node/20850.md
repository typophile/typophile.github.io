  say a light and a bold. I realise that this will lead to imperfect results, but
  for an enforced need of expediency, it could be my only option. For the sake of
  curiosity, it will also be interesting to see the level of quality versus a manually
  grafted set.\r\n\r\ncheers\r\n\r\n"

    fonts (e.g. your Light and your Bold) and then generate an intermediate instance.
    The kerning will be blended. \r\n\r\nA."

    Kerning Object quite interesting. It has plenty of Methods for many situations.\r\nhttp://robofab.com/objects/kerning.html"

  body: Miguel's right, if you're comfortable with Python you can interpolate the
    kerning between those two fonts with RoboFab

  body: "Adam,\r\n\r\nThat operation is not working for me in FLS5.02. The values
    I get are duplicates of the values from one master. In addition, the number of
    pairs derived from a MM instance is extremely small compared to the number of
    pairs in the 2 masters. \r\n\r\nA separate issue, but an important one, is this:
    After compatibilizing my outlines scrupulously, testing successfully with the
    \"Blend Fonts\" function, instances from a MM have erratically exploding shapes;
    some points simply migrate randomly, many units away from their correct location.
    This behavior is different from what results when outlines are not compatible
    or path order is switched between masters. I include some examples. [img:sites/default/files/old-images/sevenwack_3941.gif][img:sites/default/files/old-images/Hwack_4780.gif]"

  body: I'd love to give this a go in studio 5, but the ruddy folder that houses  macro
    scripts, won't allow me full access unless I key in my password on every single
    occasion. I've tried every possible way of changing the access privelages, but
    with no avail. Anyone else encountered this problem? Or is there a way to change
    the location of the scripts folder? hmfff

  body: "There are two locations of the macro folder. On Mac, it's \r\n/Library/Application
    Support/FontLab/Studio 5/Macros/\r\nwhere the FontLab's \"factory\" scripts should
    go and \r\n[user]/Library/Application Support/FontLab/Studio 5/Macros/\r\nwhere
    the user's scripts should be placed. The subfolder structure of the both folders
    is identical. If the user macro folder doesn't have a particular folder that is
    present in the application macro folder, just create one. \r\n\r\nThe locations
    of the folders for Windows are described in the manual. Note that you can change
    the location of the user folder in FontLab Studio 5's Options/Preferences dialog.
    For example, on my Windows machine, it's D:\\FL\\Studio5 rather than the default
    C:\\Documents and Settings\\Adam Twardoch\\Application Data\\FontLab\\Studio5.
