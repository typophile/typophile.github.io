  body: "I was hoping that you would've asked \"what's the difference between an art
    director and a graphic designer\" so I could've responded with \"about $20,000
    a year.\"\r\n\r\nOh well.\r\n\r\nIn general the art director is more likely to
    do the initial concepts and then pass it on to a graphic designer to complete,
    but I think it's different depending on the company. Sometimes it's just a title."

  body: "The art director directs. The designer designs. In most times, the designer
    is seem by the director just as the little guy whos got to get it done today,
    \"chop chop, chap\". At times, the designer holds up some ideas just until before
    the deadline is at the door, as a way to have some credit, which in most cases
    goes to the director, cause \"you work for me\" - they say ...\r\n\r\n"

  body: what if the designer takes on some of those responsibilities. Directing and
    designing? What then? Should the designer get more credit, more importantly compensation?

  body: "In the advertising agencies I've had expereince with it's basically the same
    role. The designers the work is sent to finish (ie no concept development) is
    usually called \"production\" or \"the studio\".\r\n\r\nI have a sneaky suspicion
    the only reason the 2 titles are used is so companies can pay you less as a designer
    but make you do the exact same work as an art director under guise that it will
    help you move up.\r\n\r\nI use both titles when people ask me what I do. Apparently
    it's more prestigious in the industry to be called an Art Director, but if you're
    looking for freelance work people want to hire a Graphic Designer."

  body: "My findings from freelancing as a designer at large agencies\r\n\r\nCreative
    director, Copywriter(s), Suits (account managers, marketing and strategic, R&D),
    Art director, Studio manager, Graphic designer, Mac op, Trolley person, media
    placement and production managers... tv, programmers, animation\r\n\r\nThe most
    important is the trolley person, especially on a Friday... when they push the
    trolley over full of beer, wine and snacks at 3.30pm... it is well received.\r\n\r\nIn
    large agencies...\r\n\r\nCreative director(s) and suits.\r\nCreative director
    (initial ideas/concepts... how did you think of that) works with art directors
    and designers together. or steals the designers ideas and wins an award for it.\r\n\r\nOnce
    designed designers as semi final art (templates) then pushed out to mac ops to
    create the various media and final art watched and directed by art directors,
    studio manager.. with the occasional suit getting involved.\r\n\r\nArt directors
    will stay on the campaign and design other rough ideas and formats, though art
    directors are like the creative director(s) pets.\r\n\r\nDesigners will work with
    the art directors to make the art director look good...\r\nMac ops will make anyone
    else on mac look really slow.\r\n\r\n\r\nNow the new term from where I am standing
    is not art director or graphic designer... just 'creative' \r\n\r\nCreative Director\r\nSuits
    (account managers, marketing and strategic, R&D)\r\nCreative - copy writer(s)\r\nCreative(s)\r\nMac
    Ops... plus all the others\r\n\r\nmy all time favourite is the client who wants
    to art direct.........! or thinks they can!!\r\n\r\nsorry I am tired and waffling
    on... none of this makes sense if I re-read it.\r\n\r\nI like creative\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: "In the days before computers the difference was easy to spot. An art director
    had no clue how to prepare a proper mechanical. \r\n\r\nI had this one art director
    who would do a little scribble with a pencil, and then walk away. No indication
    of typeface, virtually nothing there. I would take his scribble spec the type
    commission the art and create the layout. Guess who got the credit?\r\n\r\nThen
    I got to be a Design Director and all I did was go to meetings and talk about
    design."

  body: "Where I work, it's a meaningless title - from the moment someone is trusted
    to design work that will be shown to a client, that person has Art Director on
    their business card. There is a hierarchy, but it is not officially delineated.
    Some designers consider themselves junior Art Directors, others very vehemently
    declare they are senior Art Directors. Everyone's business card is the same, it
    just says Art Director. And between you and me, no one should have the title Art
    Director as no one but the Creative Director of the company directs anything,
    we're all just regular designers. But the title on the card makes people feel
    better I suppose.\r\n\r\nI think that the area where they cross over would be
    in designing the work. Certain AD's that I've worked for would set the tone of
    the design work, and then you as the designers would follow their lead, adding
    little bits of your own in there, but mostly following.\r\n\r\nBut it really depends
    on where you work, how the roles are perceived. "

  body: "i've been both, often at the same time. as an art director i work more conceptually,
    clarifying the meaning of choices, identity points, the meaning of visual decisions.
    as a graphic designer i work more hands-on; nudging pixels, tweaking layouts,
    kerning fonts.\r\n\r\ni think that's the key: an art director has more conceptual
    and contextual responsibility. a graphic designer should understand and employ
    that sort of thinking but works more directly with the hands-on process, often
    under the direction of an art director."

  body: "\"Artwork\" was traditionally (pre-digital) considered to be the bits and
    pieces that were assembled on artboards.\r\nTherefore, an art director directed
    the assembly (by the paste-up artist, a.k.a. mechanical assembly artist), as well
    as directing the art contracted out to type houses, illustrators and photographers,
    especially directing photo shoots. In those days, the art director's rough layout
    provided direction to all these people. Other work contracted out included the
    production of comps (comprehensive layouts), which were intended to be very close
    to what the finished thing looked like (although many art directors had sufficient
    skill with markers to do slick comps themselves). Also, comps could be made from
    dry transfer products and colored paper.\r\nArt directors could also \"direct\"
    the selection of stock photography, although this was far less used before PhotoDisc
    came along.\r\n\r\nNot to forget directing another aspect of production--film
    and printing. Proofs that are made directly from digital files, rather than from
    film used to burn the plates, are a fait accompli not requiring much direction.
    \r\n\r\nSo in the past, there was literally a lot more directing involved in art
    direction, before software telescoped and subsumed so many job functions. The
    distinction between advertising art direction and graphic design was more clear
    cut, now there seems to be more overlap and \"globality\" of branding. \r\n\r\n"

  body: "I see very few design companies still using that title art director. To clarify
    our roles we use the term Director for our people that manage an entire team (a
    development team, our visual design team, our interaction design team). The equivalent
    of art director in our company is Senior Designer, Senior Interaction Designer.\r\n\r\nYou
    have to also understand the distinction in titles is not just about experience
    and talent. The longer a designer is in her/his field the more they have to hone
    their concepting skills (idea creation), their communication skills (idea selling)
    and their mentoring skills. \r\n\r\nOur team looks like this: \r\n\r\nDesign Intern\r\nDesigner
