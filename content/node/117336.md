  body: Can't find a perfect match. That's something close to [[http://www.myfonts.com/search/din+condensed|DIN
    Condensed]]/[[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/urw/engschrift|DIN Engschrift]], the
    main differences for these letters being on /R leg, /2 design and some angled
    cut finials. For what it's worth, I'd probably start with [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/fontbureau/garage-gothic|Garage
    Gothic]], possibly the less work to get close of this lettering.
