body: Can anyone suggest some good resources on the web, where one could take a look
  at some more unique typefaces? Maybe even links to some well respected type foundries?
  Anything would be a great help!

  body: "You're in for a long slog. There is simply so much out there that it's better
    to start by describing what you want, such as: \"I need \r\n\r\n<ul><li>a sturdy,
    rugged serif for newspaper text\"</li>\r\n<li>a casual, friendly script with a
    nod to the American fifities.\"</li>\r\n<li>heavy sans serif typefaces that look
    like they were hand drawn with a pen or brush.\"</li></ul>\r\n\r\nWith more specific
    requirements we can be much more helpful with recommendations."

  body: "Thank you for the links loremipsum, very helpful!\r\n\r\nI suppose specifically
    I'm looking for a more elegant, humanist serif typeface. I'm going to be creating
    brand guidelines for a fairly high-end party planner, so I'm looking for some
    quality 'old-fashioned' typefaces that can still look contemporary enough."

  body: Thanks Stephen! Looked through them all. The list was super helpful. For some
    reason, I like Eason... but I may have to take another look later today.
