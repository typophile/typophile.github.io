  introduction to Chinese fonts and typography please? In English but pertaining to
  Cantonese if there is a big difference between the treatment of that and Mandarin?\r\n\r\nThanks,
  \r\n\r\nGraham"

    there is no real typographical difference as far as I am aware apart from some
    characters specific to Cantonese. \r\n\r\nThe standard written Chinese used by
    Cantonese speakers in formal situations is essentially identical to that used
    by Mandarin speakers. When Cantonese speakers specifically choose to write in
    Cantonese, the differences with standard written Chinese based on Mandarin are
    basically in word choice and usage, but as I said, the only typographically different
    element is the use of Cantonese-specific characters.\r\n\r\nAnother thing to take
    into consideration is that in Hong Kong and Macao, Cantonese speakers will write
    with traditional characters, while Cantonese speakers in China will write with
    simplified characters."

    but has lived in the UK for the last 14 years since she was twelve. She might
    be doing some work for Hong Kong, so I thought I'd see if there was anything that
    would be helpful as she studied design in the UK and isn't that familiar with
    Chinese typography and fonts.\r\n\r\nThanks again, \r\n\r\nGraham"
