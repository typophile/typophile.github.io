  like this: http://www.dafont.com/font.php?file=bagpack&page=1&nb_ppp_old=10&text=NO+No+NO+SENOR&nb_ppp=10&psize=l&classt=alpha
  -- just without all stupid effects and... well, as a \"real\" font. The S for example
  seems to be stolen from Baskerville but the rest of it doesn't fit at all, the charakters
  are a lot wider. This is basically my huge Problem right now: All the fonts I have
  looked at so far have wide charakters, whereas I'm rather looking for tall but strong
  ones but still with a good amount of varying line strength.\r\n\r\nIf you can think
  of a free font that would be great but it's not necessary. Thanks in advance for
  your help.\r\n"
