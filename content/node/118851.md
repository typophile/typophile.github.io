    The original was published in the ATF catalog of 1923 at pp 454 to 456.\r\nIt

  body: "\"Do you have a HD scan of this specimen?\"\r\nFor this you would need to
    access a printed copy of the ATF 1923 book or order photocopies from a library
    that has it and is willing to do photocopies. You have the page numbers.\r\nPlease
    note that the old specimen books did not usually include a large scale character
    set. Rather they offered a presentation of phrases in various sizes.\r\nThe 1923
    ATF book was one of the earliest to offer a character set, but only at a smaller
    scale. This is what is shown in the book:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/MottoSMorrisFullerBenton1915_6357.jpg][img:sites/default/files/old-images/MottoSMorrisFullerBenton1915B_3556.jpg][img:sites/default/files/old-images/MottoSMorrisFullerBenton1915C_5235.jpg][img:sites/default/files/old-images/MottoSMorrisFullerBenton1915D_5458.jpg]\r\nDon"
