  body: Reminds me of <a href="http://www.veer.com/partner/link.aspx?i=1048&c=4&p=products/typedetail.aspx?image=UMT0000253">Halvorsen</a>
    and <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/search/?q=strada">FF Strada</a>. Could be
    that Silverjet got their own type made, but they use [[FF DIN]] on <a href="http://flysilverjet.com">their
    website</a>.
