body: "I've loved typography for a while.  When a company recently approached me about
  creating some artwork for them, I felt it was time to dive in and try my hand at
  it. With the job completed and submitted, and the client happy, I garnered permission
  to post it up for critique, and I would really like to hear what some of the more
  experienced out there feel about the piece.\r\n\r\nThe piece is called \"Inspiration\",
  and took me about 57 hours to complete and is over 50 layers in photoshop.\r\n\r\n[[http://i188.photobucket.com/albums/z6/Cutless1/Inspiration.png|Click

    is cut off by the margin and you are seeing pportunity, the others were wrong,
    so thank you again!"

  body: "Has a nice feel to it. Looks like it was enjoyable to make, since it seems
    so organic and free. I bet it would look great in black-and-off white in addition
    to black and white.\r\n____________________________\r\nwww.coroflot.com/kate_dawson"
