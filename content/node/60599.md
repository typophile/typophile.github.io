body: I'm looking for an elegant, yet not feminine font for a woman's personal stationery.
  She is very sophisticated, elegant (and somewhat modern) and does not like frilly
  or feminine things. Her preference is sans serif but I'd like to explore both, seeing
  as she is open to suggestions. Thank you very much!

  body: Thank you all. I really like some of your suggestions, I just don't know if
    I have the $ to spend. I have so many fonts already - it's like getting ONE more
    pair of black shoes because the 10 you have in your closet aren't good enough.

  body: "Will she be typesetting letters on screen and then printing them out on your
    stationary? \r\nOr are you just designing the letterhead and then your client
    will compose the letters by hand?\r\n\r\nIf it\u2019s the first, then you have
    a larger issue on your hands. If it\u2019s the second, then really just about
    friendly sans will do. And yes, the font should emote \u201Cfriendly\u201D\u2014
    after stationary is for \u201Cpersonal correspondence\u201D.\r\n\r\nNarrow your
    choices (or help us narrow them for you) by telling us what them are elements
    are you using and style are you tring to create. Bauhaus Geometric then Futura.
    ArtDeco- Nuetraface. Minimalism- a bitmap... etc\r\n\r\nDoes she owns a business
    and her stationary might do double duty? then allow for that too.\r\n\r\nMikey

  body: "Simone:\r\nI hear you on the money thing!....I just had to drop some cash
    on a new face for a job I'm doing myself.\r\n\r\nBut, I usually look at that as
    an opportunity to do my part to help type designers make a living...educate your
    client about what good type costs. Show her a range of options, and tell her what
    each typeface costs (and that she should probably own a license for her own identity
    typeface!)\r\n\r\nI find that usually you can't do a stationery / letterhead job
    \"for free\" just because you own the fonts yourself because (1) you shouldn't
    be giving a client copies of fonts you already own, (2) quite often, the identity
    fonts need to be paired with the fonts that will be used in the body of the documents
    that she types and prints onto the preprinted letterhead you design, and (3) that
    usually limits you to templating the body content with default system fonts that
    your client owns, which is usually a VERY WOEFUL and limiting selection.\r\n\r\nSo,
    unfortunately, I think your letterhead type choice also needs to be designed with
    the body content type choice in mind....so they make \"good bedfellows\" as it
    were... ;-)\r\n\r\nCheers"

  body: Legacy Sans is the identity font of a condo development near me. I think it
    has the qualities you want.
