  know a few that are close, but I'm not a type expert and was looking to see what
  others suggestions might be. Thanks in advance!

    you that lecture. The closest font might be <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/exljbris/museo-sans-rounded/?refby=typographica\">Museo
    Sans Rounded</a>. Shave the \u2018G\u2019 beard, widen the \u2018A\u2019, and
    narrow the \u2018O\u2019."

  body: "To recreate this sign I would consider the extensive Core Sans series\r\nCore
    Sans A 75 Extra Bold pretty well has the letters\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/CoreSansA75ExtraBoldAsChicago_5850.gif]\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/s-core/core-sans-a/\r\nCrossbar

    Nova]] (soft rounded version [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/marksimonson/proxima-nova-soft|here]])
    or [[http://www.typography.com/fonts/gotham/overview|Gotham]] ([[http://www.typography.com/fonts/gotham-rounded/overview|rounded
    version]]), manually outlining to artificially embolden and round it. Some techniques
    could even blunt corners like on this signage.\r\nReady-to-go option but probably
    with an overall look less close than Proxima/Gotham: [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/aviation/polaris|Polaris]],
