  \r\nI'm working on a project for someone and I'm trying to recreate their logo in
  Photoshop. I have searched for a few hours, but I cannot seem to find this font
  online anywhere. Anybody have any ideas? It's the cursive style font that spells
  the word \"Caniglia\" in the logo at this website: http://www.thecanigliagroup.com/\r\n\r\nThanks
  much in advance!\r\n"
