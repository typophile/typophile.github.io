body: Hey all. I'm looking for immediate reactions to this logo. What do you think
  of, and what do you think it represents? I would give you more info, but I don't
  want to influence the results. Thanks, in advance, to those who are willing to help.
  I'm at a critical point in development and I need some feedback.

  body: Explain your business rational. Its either cool or lame. The right wing looks
    like an E which makes this looks all over the map.

    wanted first impressions! Anyway, I agree with Dan. Design doesn't exist without
    context\u2014give me the context so it can be evaluated on real terms.\r\n\r\nkris."

  body: "i'm feeling ice cream. i have no idea why. i know it says gorilla but i'm
    imagining cows with wings. it's puffy or fluffy and seems to be floating almost.
    that might be the white space though. and although it says gorilla it doesnt seem
    tough like a gorilla, it seems rough like monkey-man. i.e. scrawled letters real
    quick...maybe more third grade-ish like making big bubble letters when you were
    a kid. i dont know though, the S's seem a little too sloppy. almost like there
    wasnt enough 'real attempt' at making them decent. but this might be ok for whatever
    the subject matter is. \r\n\r\ni feel like this is one of those ink blot impressions
    where you fold the paper and someone says what do you see....i need the context
    to contribute more\r\n\r\nw|m"

    design studio who promotes their clients on the street. Much like The London Police
    or ObeyGiant, Gorilla Studios will take a militant, playful approach to its''
    design. '

  body: "I think the logo is a good start. I like the organic forms, but overall it
    still lacks contrast. Maybe a single color approach could be more powerful? \r\n\r\nPush
    the idea to the next level. The wings are the same as the type and everything
    is still one solid mass without much variation of proportions. Try giving the
    wings some more character. Consider the stencil approach that Obey uses...it's
    powerful, simple and high contrast. In my opinion the missing counter only hurts
    the overall strength literally and conceptually.\r\n\r\nHope this helps\r\n\r\n-_-
