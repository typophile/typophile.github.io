    maybe the News Gothic or Franklin Gothic like the GMC,\r\nin their sites...\r\n\r\nPontiac
    uses the Frutiger and Griffith Gothic\r\nhttp://www.fontbureau.com/fonts/sans/GriffithGothic\r\n\r\nOpel
    use the Opel Sans, custom by Monotype!\r\nhttp://www.customfonts.co.uk/csview.asp?cs=Opel\r\n\r\nSaturn
    go with Univers....\r\n\r\nAs well, Helvetica for \"secondary type\" Obvious!!!\r\n\r\nIMHO...

  body: Okay... off the top of my head I can think of the fonts for Buick and Pontiac.
    The current font they use isn't just custom lettering for their logo. I've actually
    seen it in use in a magazine ad from a few years back. See <a href="http://www.chromespinners.com/images/buick_logo.gif">this</a>
    image. As for Pontiac, it's the font they use for their <a href="http://www.usatf.org/events/2001/USAIndoorChampionships/images/indoorChamp01.jpg">Grand
    Prix</a>. I'm sure there's a freeware version of this out there.

  body: I'll have to find which magazine had the Buick ad that used that font and
    see if I can scan it. I'm certain it's not a modified Delta for a logotype, because
    the ad uses this custom font. Fabio, I have seen Larabie's font, however I doubt
    General Motors would use it. If anything, they probably use a font of their own.
    I've seen commercials with this font, and a Pontiac brochure used it as well.

  body: I found the ad, and I guess it does use Berthold Delta. Thanks for your help.

    They just released a new one.\r\nChevrolet = Klavika\r\nPontiac = Univers - I'm
    not sure what the States does but in Canada we use Univers\r\nGMC = Aachen - ugh.\r\nHummer

    I don't really do much Cadillac stuff\r\nSaturn = Univers\r\nGoodwrench = Myriad\r\nGeneral

  body: "ok, so i just started working for GM, i'm a designer, but working in R&D
    at the tech center.  all the original signage around the place has this futura-ish
    typeface that's really nice, but i can't find any documentation about it.  it
    may just be a pre-digital futura, or something original for the tech center when
    it was made.  I don't have any good pictures of it yet, as cameras are technically
    not allowed in the building.  \r\n\r\nit's really gorgeous type, and most of it
    is falling apart, which is real shame"
