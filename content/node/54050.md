body: "I supposed this is a very novice question, but I was curious what the best
  font bundles are to buy. For example, I was on <a href=\"http://www.emigre.com\">
  Emigre's</a> website and was looking at the Mrs. Eaves type bundles. Open type has
  everything from ligatures to numbers and beyond, but there's a smaller (and less
  expensive) one without all the ligatures, fractions, etc.\r\n\r\nI suppose the question
  I post is when purchasing a font should you purchase the Open type files or is it
  best to buy what you need and move forward from there?"

  body: "\r\nThe concern, if I follow correctly, should be about your budget not opentype.
    If you have budget for an entire family or package then you should license it.
    In the end you will (probably) be saving money per font licensed. "

  body: Yeah, I figured if the budget allowed, go for the whole family instead of
    the basic family. Thanks!
