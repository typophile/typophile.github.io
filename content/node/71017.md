body: When writing about fonts made for or licensed for web use, what is your preferred
  spelling? "Web fonts" is certainly more common (Google results for <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&as_q=&as_epq=web+fonts">web
  fonts</a> and <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&as_q=&as_epq=webfonts">webfonts</a>),
  but I'm seeing more of the one word usage now that the market is maturing and providers
  and users are seeking a way to set apart those fonts that are specifically for the
  web.

    Ragan, Jackson Cavanaugh, Kent Lew, and Robb Ogle.\r\n\r\nMy personal take on
    it is perhaps more complicated than it needs to be, but I use \"web fonts\" when
    referring to fonts that were made for the web, and \"webfonts\" when referring
    to the general use of fonts on the web. Compare it to the difference between \"type\"
    and \"typography\"."

  body: "I should note that using either \"webfonts\" or \"web fonts\" is less than
    ideal when what we really mean is \"web typography\"; unfortunately, the general
    public isn't very likely to make those distinctions.\r\n\r\nIf the phototype industry
    is any indication, I get the feeling that people will be inclined to squish the
    words in to one term as the field grows, so perhaps we should just make like the
    Germans and decisively embrace the contraction(?)\r\n\r\nI struggled with a similar
    issue on the issue of \"wood type\" vs \"woodtype\". I opt for the two-word variation
    there, though mostly because of how it has been used historically. See also the
    thread I started on \"sans serif\": http://typophile.com/node/38484"

  body: "Both Ralph's and my interpretations \u2013 where \"web fonts\" and \"webfonts\"
    are slightly different concepts \u2013 perhaps bring up a larger issue of a lack
    of clear terminology to help people avoid lumping everything in to one vague concept.
    \r\n\r\nMost people will understandably consider \"web fonts\" to be synonymous
    with \"webfonts\" and use them interchangeably. It seems worth killing one or
    the other, whether or not we adopt other terms to help clarify the subtle distinctions."

    were just really excited when we started offering webfonts last year."

    Where this might break down is there's no parallel for device fonts and embedded
    fonts. \r\n\r\nBut, since it's important to communicate that the software people
    are licensing is distinctly different (technologically different, or even with
    distinct licensing characteristics), it adds clarity to call them webfonts.\r\n\r\nwebfonts
    = specific software designed for web browsers\r\n\r\nweb fonts = the use or discussion
    of the software (how about web type, browser-based typography or even just typography).
    My personal agenda is to remind people that we've entered the post-browser internet
    age, so you can see my bias showing.\r\n\r\nBy the way, Web Fonts or WebFonts
    will eventually expire. I was thrilled when the style manuals moved away from
    capitalizing Web and Internet, even though they were about 10 years behind the
    common lowercase usage. (Ironically my iPad wants to keep capitalizing it without
    my permission!)"

    such as \"webfont service\" this easier to pick up and less ambiguous. Is a \"web
    font service\" a service for web fonts, or a web-based font service?\r\n\r\nI
    had the same issue as Rob with the name of the web version of my fonts. First,
    I decided to call it FacitWeb because it is a slight redesign of Facit but then
    got convinced that camel case looks silly and changed it to [[http://justanotherfoundry.com/facit-web|Facit
    Web]]. Technically, the font-family property is FacitWeb though."

  body: "We're already seeing that making two-word \"web\" compounds into one word
    is actually behind the trend.\r\n\r\nWeb site --> web site --> website --> site\r\n\r\nThe
    same thing has happened for \"e-\" in many cases. People use \"mail\" nearly as
    much as they use \"email/e-mail/E-mail\" to refer to electronic mail. \r\n\r\nE-mail/e-mail/email
    --> mail\r\n\r\nSo perhaps we could leapfrog some intervening steps here:\r\n\r\nWeb
    font/web font/webfont --> font\r\n\r\nSo, why start out specifying \"web\" or
    \"Web\" at all? We're getting to where the Internet and the Web are the default
    locations for just about everything. The trend to drop \"web\" is so widespread
    and common that it's hardly noticed. We have a few highly contested battles for
    things like \"website,\" but those are the minority cases. \r\n\r\nLook at it
    from another angle: in most of my conversations with people, they no longer even
    specify that they heard, read, or learned something on the Internet or Web. It's
    just assumed. Disambiguation is only required when they learned it offline *and*
    there's room for confusion. \r\n\r\nI could see how highly technical insiders
    might require some disambiguation, the same way they might require specifying
    TrueType or OpenType fonts to their design and typography peers.\r\n\r\nIf you
    do feel that \"web\" is required, then I am afraid I think it should be an open
    compund: \"web font\" or \"Web font,\" which by necessity should create the backformation
    \"desktop font\" or similar. But that's just a matter of opinion and style, not
    of grammar or anything inherent in English.\r\n\r\n"
