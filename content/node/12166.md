  born 1961.\r\n\r\nType designer, co-founder of [[Emigre]], and provocateur. [[Emigre]]
  and Licko were semi-unwitting members of the vanguard of [[postmodern typography]],
  and through Emigre the foundry and [[Emigre Magazine]] found herself on the forefront
  of type design in the late 80s and early 90s.\r\n\r\nLicko's early typefaces betray
  a fascination with low-resolution output, being [[outline font]] versions of the
  fonts then in use on dot-matrix printers. Inspiration from those sources is also
  evident in the \"Base\" typefaces, more abstract explorations of simplified typeface
  design. Over the the last 15 years Licko's designs have grown less extreme, although
  no less radical.\r\n\r\nLicko's most significant achievements to date are her two
  playful text families, [[Filosofia]] and [[Mrs Eaves]]. [[Filosofia]] is a [[didone]]
  / [[Bodoni]] [[revival]] with many alternate characters and a frequently-used [[unicase]]
  face. [[Mrs Eaves]], named for [[John Baskerville]]'s lover, is a mildly stylized
  [[Baskerville]] [[revival]] known for its profusion of colorful [[ligatures]] and
  \"petite caps\", a unique variation on the theme of [[small caps]]. [[Mrs Eaves]]
  is a technical tour de force, formerly being accompanied by a program from [[LettError]]
  intended to help designers manage its unwieldy set of ligatures, and recently being
  converted to an overwhelmingly full-featured [[OpenType]] family by [[John Butler]].
  Both type families are beloved by graphic designers and regarded with mild suspicion
  by typographers.\r\n\r\n<strong>Fonts Designed</strong>\r\n\r\n1985\r\n[[\"Coarse
