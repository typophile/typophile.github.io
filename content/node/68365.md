  Photoshop tutorials online but have not found a method that I like. I want my type
  to look really beat up. I'm going to try printing the type and the doing a blender
  transfer to see if that gives me the right look, but I'm curious about how to do
  it digitally, too. Any tips or links to tutorials would be great. Thanks!\r\n\r\n"

    The scan and attack it method gives the most unique - anything digital looks like
    the computer did it.

    layer, apply Gaussian Blur, then adjust the levels to pure black and white."

    on the final output distressing digitally yields better results. The advantage
    to manual distressing is that it provides infinitely more complexity in the kind
    damage done to the type. But that only matters if the end product will reproduce
    the distressed type as a raster graphic at a size that can reproduce the detail.
    If the text will only been seen at a distance, at a small size, or as a vector
    graphic it\u2019s much more efficient to work digitally. And when making a font
    distressed digitally does not distort the proportions of letters. By the time
    a sheet of paper has been pulled through a hot laser printer, sanded, crumpled,
    etc. the letters can end up stretched in unsightly ways."

    etc.</cite>\r\n\r\nThat's a silly argument. You might have more control when faking
    wear digitally, and it might be faster if you've done it before and have developed
    a good process or have purchased some off-the-shelf filters (?!?!). But good distressed
    type visually mimics the physical qualities of real-life, usually ephemeral, objects
    (hand-drawn, typewritten, stamped, over inked, coarse paper, physically worn,
    etc.). The best (read: authentic and convincing) way to make it is to try to use
    a similar processes to what's being mimicked. In this case, for a worn, faded
    stamp, get a stamp made (can be done overnight) and then play around with watered
    down ink and different papers (smooth, rough, sized, damp, etc.). I promise you
    will get better results that way."

    Distorting the letters is what it is about - running a piece of paper through
    a printing press back in the day used to distort what the metal type looked like
    too. '

    Beowolf, Jesus Loves You All, Nebulae.\r\nAny others?\r\n\r\nHaving said that,
    I applied the Roughen filter in Illustrator to Handsome, and came up with a result,
    the Handsome Rough font, that looks like the bleed of ball-point ink into paper

    is a digital conceit. Type in the real world isn\u2019t tacked up and left to
    be beautifully abraded until it has a patina that just happens to look really
    nice when thrown into perspective, tinted the right shade of red, made transparent,
    and layered inbetween a backdrop and a model holding a beer can. All that matters
    is that it look good, and it doesn\u2019t need to be produced by analog methods
    to pull that off."
