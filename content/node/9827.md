body: Hi, <BR> <BR>this is my first font i&#39;ve ever made. It is a quite a strange
  mixture of classicistic fonts and modern semi-serifs. <BR> <BR>i have just finished
  a first sketch of the lower case glyphs, now starting with upper case, and i would
  appreciate some feedback about the work so far. <BR> <BR>I haven&#39;t done any
  kerning or spacing yet, so it doesn&#39;t make sense to show reading-sized text
  &#40;it would be too ugly&#41;, but the font is intended to be used as reading-font
  for small text-passages, and display-sizes. <BR> <BR>what do you think about the
  idea at all? what about horizontal stroke-weight? is it too thin for reading-sized
  text? any suggestions about one of the glyphs? <BR> <BR>thanks for your comments,

  body: 'Right now it feels a bit like a didot, with the weaknesses that implies:
    I think the widths of your horizontal strokes will be pushing things at text sizes.
    Also, the color feels inconsistent. <BR> <BR>I like the serifs, although I think
    maybe they&#39;re a little too consistent right now, with all of them facing left
    except for the g. They also look a little funny on the v, w, and z, although I&#39;m
    not sure what I&#39;d like to see instead. <BR> <BR>The t feels a little stunted.
    The spine on the s feels inelegant and chunky, although I like the terminals.
    <BR> <BR>The counters all look nice, except the m feels a little compressed and
    the c has too much open space inside. <BR> <BR>I like the tail on the y. <BR>
    <BR>Overall, this has promise. This has kind of a postmodern feel without being
    irritating about it, and I like what you&#39;ve done with the idea of semi-serifs.'

  body: you are right, a high stroke contrast implies lesser readability, that&#39;s
    why i intend it for short texts only &#40;maybe jewelry-advertising? i don&#39;t
    know&#41;, and for display use. <BR>&#34;Also, the color feels inconsistent.&#34;
    --&#62; can you explain me this one? i am German-speaking and don&#39;t understand
    this one &#40;word&#41;. do you mean gray impression that might be not even? <BR>
    <BR>the direction of the serifs is inspired by Rotis SemiSerif &#40;Otl Aicher&#41;,
    i think they are okay, except maybe for the z &#40;i can&#39;t figure out how
    to do them right&#41;. <BR> <BR>i am unsure about the t myself, but i don&#39;t
    know how to do it yet. is it right that the cross bar has to be x-height? <BR>
    <BR>s is &#40;as expected&#41; my big problem child <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"
    ALT=":-&#41;" BORDER=0> i just don&#39;t know how to do it right. do you think
    it should rise more steeply? <BR>at the moment, it&#39;s too small as well. <BR>
    <BR>you are right on the c and the m. c has to be corrected, i will have a look
    on m as well. <BR> <BR>i hate the tail on the y <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"
    ALT=":-&#41;" BORDER=0> <BR>do you really like this one? <BR> <BR>well, next big
    step will be upper case, but before i will think about re-doing the horizontal
    stroke weight. <BR> <BR> <BR>thanks a lot for your feedback, this really helps
    me to continue <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif" ALT=":-&#41;"

    do you mean gray impression that might be not even? </i> <BR> <BR>Yeah, the large
    aperture and thin lower stroke in the c, especially, might keep the letters from
    creating an even gray on the page. &#34;Color&#34; is indeed the overall impression
    of the page&#39;s balance of black and white. And I probably spoke to soon: that
    was just my gut response, and until I see this font in a text setting and printed,
    I won&#39;t know how I feel about its color. <BR> <BR><i>i am unsure about the
    t myself, but i don&#39;t know how to do it yet. is it right that the cross bar
    has to be x-height?</i> <BR> <BR>The t&#39;s height and crossbar are all right,
    I think you just need to work on the curve of the tail. It feels too narrow. <BR>
    <BR><i>s is &#40;as expected&#41; my big problem child  i just don&#39;t know

  body: thanks for the tip with the &#34;y&#34;, Hrant. <BR>maybe i am just a bit
    too consequent when trying to follow the guidelines i imposed on myself. <BR>i
    will try your solution, maybe they are useful when working on the uppercase too
    &#40;comparing your &#34;j&#34; und &#34;J&#34;. <BR> <BR>i also like your &#34;g&#34;,
    as i was irresolute about giving it a modern form or an old-styled with loop.
    your &#34;g&#34; is something in between.
