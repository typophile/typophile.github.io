  events, essays and publications for a poster design. I have found a great deal of
  information up until 2000 but am having trouble with the last seven years. If anyone
  has suggestions as to what should be included, I would appreciate any help.\r\n\r\nI'm
  including a jpeg of the poster design in progress, I still have some work to do
  on the lower half of the type.\r\n\r\n\r\n"
