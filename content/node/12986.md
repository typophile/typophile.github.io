  Fraktur is probably the most used Blackletter typeface today. This probably has
  more to do with marketing decisions than with any instrinsic merits the design has.
  Fette Fraktur is a very 19th Century Fraktur. It has been described by some as \"Victorian,\"
  even though it was designed before the Victorian-era (and in Germany instead of
  Britain). Others have described it as Neo-Classical or Romantic (in the sense of
  19th Music and Art forms, not necessarially in that other romantic sense, i.e.,
  love).\r\n\r\nFette Fraktur is probably bestly described as a Fat Face variant on
  the Fraktur theme. Hey, fat face worked <em>so</em> well for Didones\u2026\r\n\r\nFette
  Fraktur was first released sometime before 1842 by [[Joh. Peter Nees & Company]]
  in Offenbach, Germany. The foundry was later purchased by the Ruhard'sche Gie\xDFerei,
  which during the early 20th Century because the [[Klingspor]] foundry.\r\n\r\nKlingspor
  was absorbed into the [[D. Stempel AG]] by the 1950s. Stempel converted Fette Fraktur
  into a photosetting face, which was later converted into a digital font. This digital
  font was part of a very popular bundle that Linotype and its partners (including
  Adobe) distributed during the 1980s and 90s.\r\n\r\n[[Linotype Library]] now sells
  Fette Fraktur via its website, amoung other places."
