body: "Hi Folks, \r\n\r\nThis old movie title type is eluding me. The closest I found
  was Nick Curtis' version of the Saturday Evening Post type that he called \"Saturday
  Morning Toast\". It's at least from a typeface older than the movie, but it's not
  a great match. The rounded tops of the R and B should be good earmarks, but this
  may never have been digitized. I looked in the McGrew book, skimmed the Solotype
  Catalog, and even looked in a Photo-Lettering catalog.\r\n\r\nAnyone have any ideas?\r\n\r\nThanks,
  \r\n- Mike[img:sites/default/files/old-images/RebelGirls_6137.gif]"

  body: "The tops of the R and B are similar to [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/mti/perpetua/?refby=bowfin|Perpetua]],
    but that's almost all that seems similar. I think that's why I thought this looked
    familiar at first, but clearly not the same type.\r\n\r\n- Mike"

  body: The uppercase largely matches a typeface called Book Extra Bold Italic, appearing
    in the Quick Brown Fox Co. filmtype catalog. It looks like a variant of Bookman.

  body: "It\u2019s LSC Book, which used to be part of the ITC library. There\u2019s
    no authorized digital version as far as I know.\r\n\r\nNow, LSC Book wasn\u2019t
    released until around 1970, so you might think that would rule it out. However,
    the film was originally titled <em>Cuban Rebel Girls</em> when it was released.
    In a later reissue of the film, the title was changed to <em>Assault of the Rebel
    Girls</em>. I don\u2019t have a date for that, but judging by the type it was
    after 1970. (More info <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0052717/releaseinfo?ref_=tt_dt_dt#akas\">here</a>
    and <a href=\"http://www.scoopy.com/cubanrebelgirls.htm\">here</a>.)"
