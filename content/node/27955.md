body: "I recently discovered <a href=\"http://www.letterror.com/code/ttx/index.html\">TTX</a>,
  an amazing open-source compiler/decompiler for TrueType and OpenType fonts.\r\n\r\nThe
  <a href=\"http://sourceforge.net/projects/fonttools\">SourceForge TTX site</a> provides
  ready-to-use Windows and Mac builds of the latest official release of TTX (2.0b1).\r\n\r\n<a
  href=\"http://typophile.com/wiki/Adam%20Twardoch\">Adam Twardoch</a> also hosts
  his own <a href=\"http://www.font.org/software/ttx/\">TTX for Windows</a> page that
  provides builds of the latest bleeding-edge unreleased versions of TTX.\r\n\r\nAdam's
  page has not been updated since March 2005. There are newer development \"snapshots\"
  of TTX available (the most recent one is from February this year), but no ready-made
  builds to use.\r\n\r\nNot wanting to bother Adam, I decided to build it myself.
  It took quite a bit of fiddling to get the build scripts to work at all using all
  the updated build tools I used, but I was eventually able to get a build together.\r\n\r\nIn
  case anyone wants to use it, I'm making it available for download:\r\n\r\n<a href=http://members.cox.net/typophile/TTX_2.0b2_2006-02-23.085153.exe>TTX_2.0b2_2006-02-23.085153.exe</a><!--break-->\r\n\r\n(File
  size: 2,407,971 bytes; MD5: 94ce29217ccd69e90e3da0cbcd56e8a3.)\r\n\r\nThis is a
  Windows installer, and should work on all recent versions of Windows. I'm providing
  it with no warranties express or implied, but I have tested it on multiple computers,
  and it seems to work fine.\r\n\r\nIt was built and packaged using the following:\r\n\r\n<ul><li><a
  href=\"http://www.python.org/\">Python 2.4.3</a>\r\n<li><a href=\"http://sourceforge.net/projects/numpy/\">Numerical
  Python -- Numeric 24.2</a>\r\n<li><a href=\"http://www.py2exe.org/\">py2exe 0.6.5</a>\r\n<li><a
  href=\"http://msdn.microsoft.com/visualc/vctoolkit2003/\">Microsoft Visual C++ Toolkit
  2003</a>\r\n<li><a href=\"http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?familyid=EBA0128F-A770-45F1-86F3-7AB010B398A3\">Microsoft
  Windows Server 2003 SP1 Platform SDK</a>\r\n<li><a href=\"http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyId=9B3A2CA6-3647-4070-9F41-A333C6B9181D\">Microsoft
  .NET Framework SDK 1.1</a>\r\n<li><a href=\"http://upx.sourceforge.net/\">UPX 2.02</a>\r\n<li><a
  href=\"http://advsys.net/ken/utils.htm\">Kzip (Aug 26 2006)</a>\r\n<li><a href=\"http://advsys.net/ken/utils.htm\">ZIPMIX
  (Sep 29 2005)</a>\r\n<li><a href=\"http://www.chmaas.handshake.de/delphi/freeware/xvi32/xvi32.htm\">XVI32
  2.51</a>\r\n<li><a href=\"http://www.jrsoftware.org/isinfo.php\">Inno Setup 5.1.7</a></ul>\r\n\r\nAdam,
  if you happen to read this: I'd be more than happy to have you host this build on
  your site. Please feel free to go ahead if you want to."

    an opinion about this? Would it be a waste of time? Would it be something others
    might use? \r\n\r\nI don't mean to hijack this thread, since current Windows versions
    are also very much appreciated. For both Mac or Win, and important question is
    whether the changes to the python components are significant. \r\n\r\nI'm definitely
    going to try this out. Thanks. \r\n\r\n"

  body: "Not a hijack at all, Carl. The only reason I put \"Windows\" in the thread
    title is that I didn't want to disappoint any Mac users who might come in thinking
    I had built something for them as well. (If I had a Mac, I would have, but alas,
    I don't.)\r\n\r\nI think it would be cool if you built a Mac version of the latest
    CVS snapshot. I don't think you'd have <em>too</em> much trouble; for the most
    part, the code worked for me right out of the box with the newer versions of Python
    and Numerical Python that I used. The only real snags I ran into were Windows-specific;
    they mostly revolved around getting py2exe to work with build scripts that had
    been designed for an older (and incompatible) version of py2exe."

    building TTX from the newer sources, due to a complicated mix of components present
    on my own machine, so I'm very glad you have taken on this. \r\n\r\nPlease contact
    me at adam at twardoch dot com so we can set up a permanent collaboration. I'm
    all for it! :)\r\n\r\nA."
