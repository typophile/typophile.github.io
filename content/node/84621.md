  piece of hand-written signage I found on a recent trip to Thailand. So far, I have
  designed caps only, but I aim to continue and create a comprehensive character set.
  I guess I'm trying for something quirky yet elegant!\r\n\r\nAny thoughts and criticism
  would be much appreciated at this stage.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/flametree_1_5033.jpg]"

    /P/ and /R/ bowls.\r\nShorten the middle /E/ bar a lot.\r\n/X/ top is too narrow

  body: "Thanks Minerva. Actually, no, I didn't create them in that manner, although
    it might have made things easier!\r\n\r\nI probably should have pointed out that
    one of the things I liked most about the lettering that inspired this typeface
    was the somewhat exaggerated height of the characters, and so the elevated crossbars
    of the A and H and comparatively small counters of the P and R. Similarly, the
    curly leg of the R was integral to its charm and so I am tempted to stick with
    these quirks. Agree with you with everything else though, so many thanks for taking
    the time to look and pass on some comments. N,M and W have caused a lot of bother
    trying to eliminate those dense spots at the joins without the characters becoming
    excessively wide or the strokes to fine.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, I have also been
    working on the lowercase, so I will report back soon with more to dissect.\r\n\r\nCheers!"

  body: "You're \"forcing\" /Y/ and /K/ connections to be at that height. And that
    doesn't look good.\r\nAlso you can't put /A/ crossbar at the same height as the
    others. So why not lower it a lot? Almost to the ground. \r\n"

    look now? I've also included my first efforts at some lowercase characters.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/feedback_1_portez_4277.png]"

  body: "I see you lowered /P/ and /R/ bowls - looks more balanced.\r\n/Y/ connection
    still looks to be higher than /H/ for example.\r\n/X/ is quirky (very difficult
    letter to get right) - lower right leg is too far out.\r\n/G/ and /E/ bars are
    at different heights now (somehow). They need to be at either the same height,
    or noticeably different.\r\n/K/ connection was lowered too much. Now top is too
    light. Also try another connection.\r\n/c/ too wide (big).\r\nNot sure about /g/.
    The bowl should come from /d/, or try the two-story /g/.\r\n/r/ terminal too dark.\r\n\r\n\r\n"
