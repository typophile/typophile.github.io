    to design capital letters with classic proportions (i. e., something in the Futura
    or Gill Sans style). I don\u2019t know if a grotesque can benefit from it, but
    I can tell you AFAIK there is no method of doing this, except trying, as David
    said. \r\n\r\nIn fact, IMHO those modern proportions are an important part of
    a grotesque, but I can change my mind if you demonstrate the opposite. Good luck!"

    to elaborate :-) on what David wrote: if you decide to get\r\na third party to
    do such modifications for you, you might want to ask for\r\nquotes from type designers.

    others here who could carry out this sort of\r\nthing very capably.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "Some of these \u2018mistakes\u2019 are the result of technical limitations,
    eg the mix of positions in a typesetting matrix (where some characters had to
    conform at the cost of proportions) and the unit system used. I am talking about
    the olden days aof course, when typesetters received a quota of milk to drink
    during their work day, to offset the effects of lead fumes.\r\n\r\nThere is a
    certain charm, I feel, in these \u2018compromised\u2019 typefaces. Why change
    that? Just use a modern face like National.\r\n\r\n. . .\r\nBert Vanderveen BNO"

  body: "Thank you all very much for your input. You have raised quite a number of
    interesting issues to be tried out. While waiting for your replies I have thought
    about it a little more and came up with the following alternate approaches to
    this particular problem:\r\n1. Use Type Design like David said. \r\n2. Using an
    empirical method, i.e. some form of numerical analysis as follows: Select a number
    of Grotesque typefaces such as Akzidenz (A), Franklin Gothic (FG), Helvetica (H),
    News Gothic (NG)\u2026 with the same weight as the \u2018grotesque\u2019 [actually,
    lets say that it is a new Grotesque typeface under construction by a novice typeface
    designer] with the probably erroneous capital widths.\r\nFor each grotesques selected
    take the widths of all capitals and divide them by the width of \u2018H\u2019
    e.g. \r\nNews Gothic:\r\nA/H (), B/H (), C/H (), D/H ()\u2026\r\nDo this for the
    other selected Grotesques.\r\nDo this also with the Grotesque which contains number
    of erroneous Capital widths (GECW). \r\nYou end up with 4 series. Average them.
    \ The result would be a generalized empirical formula or Capital widths relationships.\r\nCompare
    each element of the Averaged capital width ratio series (ACW) with each respective
    element in the GECW. \r\nAt this point the Capitals with the erroneous widths
    will stand out by virtue of the fact that they would have the largest discrepancies.\r\n3.
    Another method, an optical one would be to print out lines all the capitals of
    the selected Grotesques and lastly of the GECW. Take your time looking at them.
    The Capitals with the erroneous widths in GECW will stand out.\r\n"

    and the intentions are golden, there's a severe limit to how much this is worth
    the effort. It's great for understanding fonts, but lousy for actually producing
    fonts. The eye is much more effective in this regard. The problem is, without
    experience and/or quality feedback, even the eye is not enough. If you still want
    to attempt numeric analysis, try to find a copy of the fascinating Unica booklet
    by G\xFCrtler et alia. You might also want to study Nick Shinn's Richler, which
    IIRC exhibits an interesting \"third way\".\r\n\r\nWhat I suggest is giving it
    a shot, posting\r\nthe results here, and hoping for the best.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
