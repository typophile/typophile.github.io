    a name? Or are you also looking for close digital matches?\r\nImage #4 should
    be a [[Walbaum]].\r\nF"

  body: "I'm looking for both:) Name of the font and closet digital match.\r\nWelbaum
    seems to be the right choice for image #4, but it's still hard to find correct
    version.\r\nBigger problem is with other samples: I have no idea what font might
    be on image#1 (\"R\" is so characteristic, but still nothing matches), #2 might
    be some Goudy or Garamond version, but all version I've seen do not match Italic
    on #3.\r\n\r\nAnyway it must be something created before 1920 :)\r\n\r\nthanks
    for reply.\r\nh."

  body: As these are pre-digital samples we're likely to come up with nothing better
    than close matches. The text face is a <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/fontlist/genres/garamond/">Garamond</a>,
    and it looks quite like <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/linotype/stempel_garamond_std_virtual/">Stempel's
    version</a>.

  body: "Thanks!!!\r\nOnly image#1 still unsolved. It doesn't look like Garamond -
    different \"M\" and that flow in \"R\". Any idea? "
