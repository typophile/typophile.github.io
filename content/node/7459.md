  body: David, thanks, I was actually going to mention that I was referring to optima
    occasionally while designing this &#40;though I suppose a traied eye such as your
    own would pick this at 20 paces&#41;. However, I&#39;m not so keen on optima,
    except in all caps with generous spacing. The Q has been an interesting thing
    for me; it always takes such a short time for me to make it. Maybe the classical
    roman proportions with near-monoweight lines make for easy Q&#39;s. <BR> <BR>I&#39;ve
    been designing this over quite a short time-period and had previously limited
    myself to only caps &#40;it&#39;s a student project &#40;me being the student
    &#40;off topic, is it gramatically correct to use brackets within brackets?&#41;&#41;&#41;.
    <BR> <BR>I don&#39;t think I have time to add numerals, but perhaps i can work
    the &#34;It only needs roman numerals&#34; angle. ;&#41; <BR> <BR>I think I might
    shift the weighting of the P, B and R&#39;s bowls upward a little, they look a
    little &#34;depressed&#34;.

  body: 'off topic: <BR> <BR>bracketing rules depend on the subject. i&#39;m not sure,
    but i think for exmaple in mathematics it goes like this: { [ &#40; &#41; ] }
    <BR>and i believe in arts subjects and languages it works differently.'

  body: i love how you relate the handles in your glyph to the canal in the pen nib.  <BR>
    <BR>I might look at giving the bottom of your S a little more room. It feels a
    little off balance, and the REBK already push the top to bottom contrast.

  body: By &#34;a little more room&#34; do you mean fatten it up a bit? or lengthen
    its curve that extends to the terminal? The B features a slightly curved, slightly
    thinned base. <BR> <BR>Having looked at that do you mean lower the bottom of the
    S? <BR> <BR>Argh, I often struggle with my anatomy. &#34;that curvy bit down the
    bottom, huh?&#34; <BR> <BR>I&#39;ll have a bit of a fiddle...
