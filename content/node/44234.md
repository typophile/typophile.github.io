    DM, but East Mark. Back then, there were 10 East Marks in a Deutsche Mark, if
    I remember well. So the cassette was about 60 dollarcents in -let's say- 1988.\r\n\r\n(Orwo
    also made roll films for photography. They were dead cheap too, but could only
    be processed in the German Democratic Republic and especially the slides had a
    very weird hue to them.)\r\n\r\nBTW: all their printing was done with raised type
    on polymer plates, not with offset!"

    an audio cassette in the U.S. or 17 DM in West Germany - a lotta money in the
    GDR."
