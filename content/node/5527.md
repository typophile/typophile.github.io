  body: 'Nice article, though it sparked me to send the following letter to the NY
    Times: <BR> <BR>Dear NYT staff and readers, <BR> <BR>In a generally oustanding
    article on the use of Tobias Frere-Jones&#39; &#34;Gotham&#34; typeface on the
    new cornerstone at the  former World Trade Center site, there is an unintentionally
    misleading statement. The article says: &#34;The strokes have a uniform width,&#34;
    and goes on to talk about the geometric simplicity of the font. <BR> <BR>Although
    the strokes APPEAR to have a uniform width, one of the subtleties of typeface
    design is that vertical strokes must be thicker than horizontals to achieve the
    appearance of uniform thickness to human eyes--and so they are in Gotham. <BR>
    <BR>Understanding and using this and many other arcana of human perception is
    just one step on the way to becoming a master typeface designer. Like a professional
    athlete, Frere-Jones does with elegant simplicity something that is beyond the
    capabilities of most viewers, however straightforward it may appear. <BR> <BR>&#34;All
    you have to do is hit the ball with the stick. How hard can it be?&#34; <BR> <BR>Regards,
    <BR> <BR>Thomas W. Phinney <BR>Program Manager <BR>Fonts &amp; Core Technologies

  body: Interesting that Skidmore Owens &amp; Merrill hired a design firm for the
    cornerstone, and that a font was used. <BR> <BR>&#40;Or perhaps Pentagram is the
    design firm of record for the project as a whole, and not contracted specifically
    for the cornerstone.&#41; <BR> <BR>Back in the days of the lettering that Gotham
    recreates, I believe that Skidmore would have done the lettering drawings in-house,
    and contracted a mason to execute them; or perhaps they would have done a rendering
    &#40;rather than a working drawing&#41;, and directed the stone-cutter to match
    a style from a style-book. Or did the letter-cutters show their own &#34;comps&#39;
    to the architects?

  body: 'Nick: <BR>I, too, was surprised that such a prominent monument would be &#34;carved&#34;
    with the sandblaster and mat method &#40;if, indeed that&#39;s what was done.&#41;  <BR>
    <BR>Don&#39;t get me wrong, Gotham is a good New York kind of face, but I think
    hand carved would have been much more appropriate.  <BR> <BR>Of course, maybe
    a stone-cutter was employed, using Gotham as a template, but it really doesn&#39;t
    look like it from the picture.'
