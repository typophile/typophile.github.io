  easier. \r\n\r\nMake simple sugar for your ice tea/coffee and lemonade. One cup
  of sugar in a bowl add one cup of boiling water and stir with a spoon. The sugar
  desolves making simple surup. Simple surup desolves in your ice tea/coffee and lemonade,
  unlike raw sugar which goes to the bottom of your glass like a lump.\r\n\r\nLemons
  and Limes can be a pain to juice. Microwave them for 15 to 20 seconds then cut then
  into wedges, not across, you get more juice. \r\n\r\n\u2026summertime and the glyphs
  are easy\u2026 "

    as much as possible. I had to walk 20 blocks this morning to get supplies for
    my portfolio, that was horrible.

  body: I like hydrglyphics it sounds like science. Makes me think of the cowardly
    lion in the Wisard of OZ after he got his courage from the "wizard". Hrant, I
    told someone about simple sugar recently and he was scared to make it. I guess
    it takes all types to make a cake. Also keep passing the word, nothing is worse
    than a clump of sugar at the bottom of your ice tea.

  body: Caffeine yuck! I drink mostly tea and it has phytochemicals that counteract
    the caffeine effect. I like not having twiching hands and surges and crashes (energy
    levels) caused by caffeine. I guess this is more hydrglyphics

    water. They don't need to know. Don't confuse them more than they already are.
    I've noticed they have trouble with \"What kind of tea do you have?\" One time
    I had to repeat that question so many times, the guy in line behind me broke down
    and yelled out the question for me.\r\n\r\nKyle, I miss Arizona - haven't been
