  body: "I've looked at a lot of script fonts in the past 40 minutes, and I'm coming
    to the opinion that this is not a commercial font. There are some poorly drawn
    letters here, especially the X, P, L and T. Also I seem to notice that the left
    stroke of the F, H, I and K are nearly identical shapes, and the U, V W and Y
    all start with a uniform left side. The basic style of the letters I would call
    a copperplate script (though that may not be the right term), but I can find none
    of them anywhere with a rounded W like this. This U, V, W, Y looks more like <a
    href=\"http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/bitstream/murray-hill/\">Murray Hill</a> than
    any copperplate script. \r\n\r\nLooking at the lower case letters, I almost thought
    they were from a German script like <a href=\"http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/urw/kunstlerschreibsch/\">Kunstler
    Schriebschrift</a>, but the k is wrong, among other differences.\r\n\r\nI think
    this may be an amateur attempt to create a font, based on some ideas borrowed
    from various formal pen scripts, and using copied elements to simplify the creation
    process.\r\n\r\nWhere did this sample come from?\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: "It looks like someone attempted to make a \"French\" version of K\xFCnstler.
    The differences are quite clearly influenced by the French \"ronde\", particularly
    the rounded W, the X and the T. It's not a great job, sadly there are no commercial
    font versions of that handwriting style."

  body: closest i see thus far is [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/canadatype/sterling-script/regular/|Sterling
    Script]]. plenty of alternates and swash characters to go with it, so might work
    out for you. possibly even the basis of your sample?
