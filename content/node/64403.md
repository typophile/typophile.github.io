  called \"Basel\" (which I cannot find as name anywhere). He sent me a book title
  and a pic from the font.\r\n\r\nI think it could be a PostScript font. Primafont
  offered a Basel, but I do not think, its this one. Am I right or not? Can someone
  help me?\r\n\r\nGeorg\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Basel Schrift_5016.jpg]\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Schriftbuch_4139.jpg]"

  body: "Image Club used to have Basilea in its early Letterpress CD's. I still have
    the font, but I don't think they offer it any more. Akira, that was a good find
    to recognize Kellie Ann as the same typeface. I've made a note of that one for
    the Serif Guide, as an alias.The image below is from thew Serif Guide, made from
    the Image Club font.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega[img:sites/default/files/old-images/basilea_full_5490.gif]"
