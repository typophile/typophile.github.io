  is a project of the Brazilian Association for the Welfare of the Handicapped Children.
  They are inviting designers to create fonts inspired by children suffering from
  physical disabilities.\r\nBesides the chopped Arial they used on the video (which
  reminded me of the [[http://www.typophile.com/battle36|Fix Arial]] topic), I think
  there are a couple of good fonts when we scroll down. But I still feel kind of sad
  knowing the guys who conceived this project couldn't think of any other way to represent
  disabilities other than cutting things off."
