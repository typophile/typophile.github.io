  with an artistic spirit in design and typo and so on. Most of the papers in categories
  that have a lot to do with computers etc are not that much enjoyable to read according
  to layout and design :)\r\nwhich i cannot understand because 3D professionals actually
  should provide a certain sense for design!\r\n\r\nhowever, i decided to use DIN
  LightAlternate or RegularAlternate for text and now am looking for a nice contrasting
  serif font for headlines!\r\nI already considered Big Caslon, Mrs Eaves and Perpetua
  Titling but I don't know... probably they are still too boring (?)\r\nThe headlines
  can be a little squiggy because the book itself will be kind of classic (which is
  also the reason why i would not like the text to be in a serif font too because
  i like the contrast between classic and simplicity (DIN) )\r\n\r\nThank you in advance!!\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Bildschirmfoto

    Is there not a lot of text?\r\n- Caslon and Perpetua are very old-fashioned. Mrs
    Eaves is more interesting, but it's horribly spaced, so you would need to manually
    respace every single setting.\r\n- I don't know what \"squiggy\" means.  :-)\r\n-
    Instead of extreme contrast between text and titles I might aim for more harmony,
    choosing a squarish face for the titles (maybe Melior, or preferably something
    more recent). But first make sure you want to use DIN.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    F</a> may be a good serif match for DIN, but unlike Melior (which I love) it doesn\u2019t
    look so old-fashioned, at least to me. And I second Hrant, you may want to consider
    using the serif face for text and DIN for the headlines."
