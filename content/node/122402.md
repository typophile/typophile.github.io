    The building is obviously much older, perhaps pre-WWI.\r\nAs for the sign I note
    the difference in the two _E_ letters.\r\nSeems that part of the letter has broken
    off.\r\nNot a new sign. But I wonder when it was installed.\r\nUntil recent decades
    large sign letters were designed by various makers who did not necessarily base
    them on a specific font.\r\nBut I trust someone will suggest some sources for
    matching individual letters.\r\nThe low waist _R_ with a straight leg from where
    the bowl meets the vertical stroke, and the top heavy _S_ are a fair match to
    Erbar Grotesk Extra Garnitur introduced by Ludwig & Mayer Frankfurt in 1927.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/ErbarGroteskGarnitur1927SM_6491.jpg]\r\nThis
    version of Erbar is not digitized.\r\nDon"
