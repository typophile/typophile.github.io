  body: "There are so many adequate fonts for the purpose available, I can't imagine
    anyone choosing Comic Sans who wasn't perfectly at home with the idea of using
    the font and fully prepared to identify with it heart and soul or flaunt it as
    some sort of ironic d\xE9class\xE9 statement. It could after all be worse. It
    cou,ld be Papyrus. Or that piece of shyte, Andy.\r\n\r\nWho is Tracy Osborn when
    she is at home anyhow, and by what means does she expect to make wedding invites
    more democratic than they already Are? \r\n\r\n\r\n"

    who <em>don\u2019t</em> want Comic Sans don\u2019t know what they <em>do</em>
    want. (Weiss is often an excellent choice.)"

  body: "\"...while professional wedding invitations are hundreds or thousands of
    dollars.\"\r\n\r\nI read that as \"hundreds of thousands\"! I was thinking \"wow
    that's a bit of an exaggeration.\"\r\n\r\nMeh, not sure this is gonna work. Those
    couples who want nice wedding invitations want them personalized. The wife-to-be
    is meeting with decorators, florists, bakers, etc., in person to make sure everything's
    perfect. Why would she settle for less when it came to the invitations?"
