  body: "Holding a clear and compliant license trail is a good start. If you are unable
    to verify that the font data you hold conforms to the license then you can confirm
    with the foundry or designer in question. If the license you hold is for an agency
    you own, have owned or previously worked for, then the license is only valid for
    the agency but again, some foundries or designers may be willing to transfer those
    rights directly to you if all the paperwork is in order.\r\n\r\n<blockquote>Apparently,

    is a worrying statement as it indicates that you may have received, knowingly
    or otherwise, fonts for which you are not licensed and which may have been obtained
    illegitimately, oh my! If you did know, that is not cool; if you are in doubt
    and want the real thing, support the industry and buy fresh."

  body: "Thanks for the response. \r\n\r\nJust for some more background on this...
    I'm a web designer and was curious why Hoefler & Frere-Jones developed their own
    webfont delivery system. One of the reasons cited was that hackers could steal
    their fonts easily. Honestly, I thought that this was a b.s. response, until I
    found videos like this [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jS9ge9xFZ-w]]. People
    are also apparently using Fontlab to rebuild compete font sets this way. To make
    it clear, Fontlab is just a tool (a good one at that), so I don't mean to call
    them out.\r\n\r\nYes, I've traded fonts with other designers. I've never met a
    designer that hadn't done this. That's just the reality. I'm just wondering if
    there was an easy way to find these sets and delete them. I blame nobody but myself.
    I should have kept better records."

    common, especially among younger designers who are used to trading videos and
    MP3s. Most designers I've known save a copy of every font they have access to.
    Like you said, it's just the reality of the situation.\r\n\r\nEmployers and clients
    sometimes add to the problem by providing illegal copies of fonts and refusing
    to reimburse if the designer wants to buy them legally.\r\n\r\nAnd you're right
    about record-keeping; big agencies often keep track of licenses but most designers
    don't. I've purchased many fonts but didn't start saving the licenses until a
    few years ago. It just didn't occur to me. "
