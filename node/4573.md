body: G&#39;day, <BR> <BR>I am currently doing university research on Helvetica. I
  will be comparing and identifying clones and lookalikes &#40;or rip-offs&#41; of
  the 1951 Haas  Helvetica. <BR> <BR>I am not sure if this post is appropriate for
  the Type Identification Board. But it would be greatly  appreciated if any of you
  could spare your time and knowledge on Helvetica clones and rip-offs &#40;lookalikes&#41;
  and help me identify them. <BR> <BR>Name the typeface, if you can specify the type
  foundry that created it. <BR> <BR>If you can help, great! Thanks. <BR> <BR>Cheers

    &#40;URW&#44; digital&#41; <BR> <BR>There were some metal faces that might qualify
    &#40;such as certain weights of Ludlow&#39;s Record Gothic&#41;&#44; but I don&#39;t
    know that I would call any of them clones as much as competing expressions of
    the same general idea. They were clones in the sense that you couldn&#39;t use
    Helvetica on a Ludlow machine &#40;Helvetica was only available for Linotype machines&#41;&#44;
    so Record Gothic was offered as a substitute.  <BR> <BR>Most of the phototypesetting
    faces listed above were offered for similar reasons&#44; but were nearly indistinguishable
    from Helvetica. <BR> <BR>Arial is an unusual case in that it was created specifically
    as a substitute for Helvetica. It was originally for use in PostScript clone laser
    printers and imagesetters when Helvetica was called for by the print job. It uses
    the same metrics for all the characters and a similar overall appearance&#44;
    but differs in its details. It could be thought of as a separate design, except
    that without Helvetica&#44; it would not exist or have any reason to exist.'

    to a Typeface&#34; by Lars Muller. It&#39;s kind of short on info but lots of

    closer to the display version of Helvetica, which Mark brought up in an <a href="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/30/7772.html">old
    thread</a>, than either the original Linotype digitization or Lino&#39;s Helvetica
    Neue. Notice how the bold weight is slightly lighter and how, partially as a consequence
    of this, the counters on the &#39;a&#39; seem wider. &#40;This is more like the

  body: Mark, thanks for all that info on the reasons behind the numerous clones of
    Helvetica. I didnt realise this. <BR> <BR>I am currently trying to obtain type
    specimen sheets of the phototype clones of Helvetica. So far I have been able
    to find Megaron, but no luck on the others. Do any of you know particularly where
    I could obtain them? <BR> <BR>One of the things I observed is that URW&#39;s Nimbus
    Sans D has a smaller x-height, as a result it has a lighter tonal weight to it.
    This is especially noticable in blocks of text. <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/35060.gif"
    alt=""> <BR> <BR>Nimbus Sans D seems to be based on the original Haas Helvetica
    not LT&#39;s Helvetica Neue &#40;the end serif on the leg of R seems to imply
    this&#41;  <BR> <BR>Metadox, I hope you don&#39;t mind me using the word &#34;Real.&#34;
    as &#34;R&#34; and &#34;a&#34; are often where differences in Helvetica are identified.

  body: 'URW seems to have digitized at least 4 &#40;!&#41; different optical sizes
    of Helvetica, along with Helvetica Neue. &#40;Here I&#39;m talking about the Bold,
    since that&#39;s the weight I can remember seeing most in display type.&#41; <BR>
    <BR>Nimbus Sans T: This one is more like the Linotype digitizations I posted here,
    with heavier stroke weight and more dramatic curves on the &#39;R&#39; and &#39;a&#39;.
    <BR> <BR>Nimbus Sans D: Intended for display -- this is what I used to make the
    sample. <BR> <BR>Nimbus Sans P: The P is for Poster. Intended for even larger
    sizes! Looks like the glyphs are thinner still, and spaced more closely together
    by default. <BR> <BR>Nimbus Sans L: Not sure what this is meant for, but it seems
    to resemble the text faces more than the display faces. <BR> <BR>I think these
    are all based on the pre-Helvetica Neue designs, because in <i>addition</i> to
    this, URW also has many of the same optical variations of &#34;Nimbus Sans Novus&#34;,
    which presumably is a digitization of Helvetica Neue &#40;and has SC/OsF!?!&#41;.
    <BR> <BR>Though I don&#39;t have a type designer&#39;s eye to tell you if these
    faces are well-digitized&#42;, I am really liking the robustness of the Nimbus
    Sans family. Has any other foundry done this with their Helvetica equivalent?
    <BR> <BR>&#42; One weird thing with URW fonts, is that URW will &#40;or at least
    would, at a time&#41; provide the outlines to different licensees in their Ikarus
    format, and they can do things like alter the curves &#40;maybe&#41;, metrics,
    kerning, hinting, etc. &#40;definitely&#41; in the process of generating T1&#39;s,
    so not all URW digital fonts you get are equal, especially if they came bundled
    with something else!'

  body: Metadox, thanks for pointing out the various versions of Nimbus Sans. I had
    not looked at it very closely before, assuming it to be similar to the rest. I&#39;m
    especially surprised to see that URW did the display versions, which match the
    old display versions of Helvetica.  <BR> <BR>As you point out, the display versions
    of Helvetica were distinctly different from the text versions &#40;which are what
    nearly all of the digital versions--clones or not--are based on&#41;. It&#39;s
    too bad Linotype has not released such a version. Helvetica Neue is fine, but
    the old display version has some merits, especially for anyone trying to capture
    the look that made it so popular in the &#39;60s and &#39;70s. The text versions
    &#40;or even Neue&#41; don&#39;t do it.  <BR> <BR>I&#39;ve often wondered why
    Linotype has never done a display version of Helvetica, and now I think I know
    why. In metal, the display version was only available from Haas, and all the &#34;cold&#34;
    display type &#40;film fonts, rub downs, etc.&#41; got their Helvetica from Haas,
    not Linotype. Linotype was traditionally a machine composition system used mainly
    for text even when they went to phototype. Linofilm Helvetica only went up to
    36 point. Looking at it in one of my old specimen books, it looks exactly like
    Linotype&#39;s digital version. The Linotype metal version only went up to 14
    point. So, that may be why Linotype has never released the display version--they
    never had it in the first place.

    equipment.  <BR> <BR>One caveat: The book has been updated, and the copy I have
    is one of the older editions. I don&#39;t know for sure if this section is in
    the current edition &#40;after all, nobody uses phototypesetting machines anymore&#41;.
    Perhaps someone else here can confirm this. Otherwise, I would recommend getting
    it from a bookstore or library so you can examine the book and make sure the specimen
    pages are in it.'
