body: 'OK, so it&#39;s my turn. <BR> <BR>For over 15 years I&#39;ve used the name
  &#34;NEWORLD&#34; &#40;yes, I know others use it too&#41; informally for the multimedia
  productions/programming that I do. I chose that name because of many reasons, but
  the one reason that might be usable in logo design is this: &#34;norashkharh&#34;
  &#40;which translates to &#34;new-world&#34;&#41; is the Armenian name of a fruit
  that I really love. I&#39;ve never known its English name, but it looks like a tiny
  pear with a very thick, fuzzy, dark greenish-brown stem; the body is dark orange,
  with a thick peel; the seeds are huge, dark brown, and usually in pairs or triples&#42;;
  the trees have large, thick, dark green leaves. &#40;It&#39;s ironic btw that it&#39;s
  originally from the New World, but people here don&#39;t seem to harvest them.&#41;
  <BR> <BR>&#42; Superb ammo for improvised wargames, btw! Just the right heft for
  pain with no injury. And great aural resonance when dropped onto car roofs &#40;preferably
  in a fistfull&#41; from a 6th-story apartment...  :-&#62; <BR> <BR>Anyway, I never
  had a [decent] logo, but now some of your guys&#39;s design sense has [hopefully]
  rubbed off onto me, and I feel ready to &#34;congeal&#34; a visual identity. <BR>

  <BR> <BR>I would like to have some melding trick in the &#34;w&#34;, not least as
  an allusion to the WWW. <BR> <BR>For the top-left one, I can make it all-caps, or
  maybe unicase &#40;which might create a good avenue for &#34;w&#34; trickery&#41;.
  If I leave it lc, I could nestle the &#34;software&#34; above it &#40;to the left
  of the ascending &#34;ld&#34;&#41;. I don&#39;t think I can make it an intercap
  -&#34;NeWorld&#34;- decently, and &#34;Neworld&#34; detracts from the &#34;World&#34;
  part. <BR> <BR>For the other three, the inside squarish part I&#39;m thinking needs
  really full, blocky, kinda hard to decipher letters &#40;like in FF Extra&#41; -
  maybe in reverse field. For the bottom-left one &#40;or maybe the top-right one
  too&#41;, I&#39;m wondering if I could make the &#34;W&#34; into rays&#42;, like
  a newly rising sun or something - but the &#34;W&#34; would have to remain strongly
  legible. <BR> <BR>&#42; In which case maybe I could set &#34;NEWORLD&#34; in a semi-circle
  around a sun-disk &#40;or half a disk&#41;. Huh, a disks is a good allusions to
  a CD too... <BR> <BR>BTW, the &#34;software&#34; part is really optional. I&#39;d
  even consider using another word that makes sense &#40;or for the logo just &#34;NEWORLD&#34;
  maybe&#41;. <BR> <BR>Advice appreciated... and needed! I hope the multiplicity of
  directions I mention above don&#39;t derail some totally different -and much better-
  ideas you guys might dream up. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>'

    like to have something decent that conveys one or two key concepts, and maybe

    I can probably achieve that &#34;internally&#34;. That makes it more personal,

    typeface without having it&#39;s intended use/purpose in mind would you? <BR>
    <BR>I don&#39;t really think it&#39;s wrong to say to yourself - &#39;maybe a
    sun design, maybe a deep red color &#39;- or whatever you may think up.  However
    I do think you would feel more confident &amp; satisfied in your choice if you
    knew what your you meant by those choices. Your pleasure &amp; confidence in your
    mark could be good for business in &amp; of itself! <BR> <BR>If I were doing this
    project I would want to know what you wanted a prospective client to assume about
    you. Logos are great for suggesting things about their owners/companies.  <BR>
    <BR>If your logo was a poem spoken into the unconcious mind of a viewer allowing
    you to quietly shape his ideas about your company - what would it say? <BR> <BR>With
    the Nike swoosh you get : motion. Simple. That&#39;s what I think the nice swoosh&#39;s
    &#39;poem&#39; is. Motion. <BR> <BR>Another issue is distictiveness. What do your
    competitors logos/identities look like? You should probably avoid anything that
    looks too much like their logos or which uses similar ideas to avoid any confusion
    &amp; or any dimishing of your logo. <BR> <BR>What about having a no logo identity
    which work off of graphic standards rather than a mark per se? Or a logo that
    is a set of variations rather than something static? I have to admit that some
    of the best work I have seen in the last 10 years seems to be about identity rather
    than a &#39;logo&#39;. There are logos in most of the examples I am thinking about
    but the logo is part of an larger &amp; cohesive whole. <BR> <BR>Where the logo
    will be used - computer screens/web presumably - but where else? Does it need
    to work at a small size on a TV screen for instance?  <BR> <BR>If you know where
    it is going to be used that will shape your thinking too. It&#39;s quite alot
    like like when you know a font is going to be used on newsprint- you will avoid
    obvious problems when designing it or selecting it.  <BR> <BR>A one color design,
    or a design that works well in one color can save on repro costs too! <BR>'

    new media. But even that might be asking too much, so just some humour/meaning
    would be great - which is what I&#39;m trying to do with the arc-of-a-circle stuff
    &#40;and now with the rays&#41;. But I&#39;m frankly not sure what that button
    is... :-/  It&#39;s supposed to be a &#34;digital eye&#34; or something... Do

    might go to instead of going with me. Do you guys know of a directory where I
    can them look up? <BR> <BR>&#62; a logo that is a set of variations rather than

    now too. I&#39;ll think about it. Any ideas yourself on this? <BR> <BR>BTW, the
    logo will be used mostly on business cards, stationary and in credits of produced
    pieces - so nothing <i>too</i> low-fidelity. One big advantage my logo could have
    though is being animatable. And I think something made up of rays has a lot of

  body: When you say &#34; affinity for innovation and technique&#34; I guess I was
    thinking of the evocation associations that are less cerebral &amp; more emotional
    or poetic. Innovation could be bleed out into description like mutable, as opposed
    to static, variety etc. It could also associate with ideas of dynamicness, shifting
    - not resting. <BR> <BR>When you say technique I can&#39;t imagine what you couyld
    mean. I think of skilled maybe but I don&#39;t feel confident that thats what
    you have in mind. <BR> <BR>About the logo you have going I think you don&#39;t
    need the eye per se. It seems like an afterthought to me - as it is being presented
    now. I get the idea that you press the button &amp; you get a glowing new world.
    If thats the idea then maybe it would be good to integrate the two a little more.  <BR>
    <BR>I bet the letters could work on their own though! <BR> <BR>I would loose the
    button myself. When I look at GUI with buttons I usually don&#39;t like it because
    the metaphor of the physical is almost always wrong somehow. In the case of a
    logo it&#39;s less so but my prejudice remains.  <BR> <BR>&#60;venting&#62;Buttons
    are so then... Also the rise of simple text based blogs &amp; boards like this
    one &amp; typographi.ca which use simple looking but sophiticated layout are happily
    showing us that buttons are not needed.&#60;/venting&#62;      <BR> <BR>What about
    adding some kind of texture or phyical reference to the logo. Like as if it was
    woven into a basket or cut into pottery - Amerind craftishness embeded at a subliminal
    level could offer alot of richness.  <BR> <BR>That actually might refer to your
    idea of &#39;technique&#39; via the reference of craft.  <BR> <BR>Alot of what
    I have enjoyed about your posts is that you seem concerned with legitimate craft
    as a means to expression as opposed to expression without regard for craft. I
    am probably putting words in your mouth to some extent &amp; if so sorry about
    that if I am.  <BR> <BR>- Actually you could have versions of the logo as they
    would be woven carved or printed using a variety of old style, real world, materials

  body: '&#62; you can animate it using the rays <BR> <BR>Right - I can make them
    come up from the &#34;surface&#34;, or make them ripple laterally, or even have
    them as cones with a fly-through&#42;. I did 3D animation for 8 years, although
    now I&#39;m pretty rusty. <BR> <BR>&#42; Yeah, make them orange, and have the
    slogan &#34;Neworld will help you navigate through obstacles&#34;...  ;-&#62;
    <BR> <BR>-- <BR> <BR>&#34;Technique&#34;: I guess it&#39;s a more contemporary
    way of saying &#34;craft&#34;. Like something you do to ensure long-term quality
    that might not be obvious. Like putting good kerning in a font. &#40;BTW, no font
    stuff at Neworld - that&#39;s what The MicroFoundry does.&#41; <BR> <BR>That button
    isn&#39;t supposed to be a button... But anyway, it&#39;s gone now. <BR> <BR>&#62;
    What about adding some kind of texture or phyical reference to the logo. <BR>
    <BR>That sounds like a good idea - although it might push my design skills beyond
    my abilities... I&#39;ll see what I can come up with. <BR> <BR>Domain names: I
    used to think a catchy domain name is very important. It might be for a Joe Shmoe
    using the web semi-randomly to find a megacorporation, but for highly focused
    operations that you could never employ by chance encounter, just throwing in a
    hyphen or something will avoid problems with existing names. So any decent domain
    name &#40;with a pre/post-fix to &#34;neworld&#34;&#41; would work fine in my
    case, I think. And if I go with a logo with a triple-u &#40;&#34;ww&#34; when
    spelled out&#41; that might help a lot. <BR> <BR>-- <BR> <BR>Chris, I like your
    rendering with the triple-u! Pretty clever concept - definitely a strong candidate.
    It kinda looks like a bird, but most people like birds. <BR> <BR>-- <BR> <BR>&#62;
    dragging in Indian symbols and the sun is a mistake. <BR> <BR>1&#41; American
    Indians are the old-timers of the New World - like me in my field. <BR>2&#41;
    I&#39;m Armenian, and our histories have strong parallels - so it has personal
    relevance&#42;. I agree that shouldn&#39;t be made too important - but I think
    it&#39;s a nice, meaningful touch. And if I offend people who think the American
    Indians are just a bunch of drunkards who should have been wiped out totally &#40;as
    opposed to the partial treatment they got...&#41;, and decide not to give me their
    business as a result, I think I can live with that. <BR> <BR>&#42; You don&#39;t
    have to be part of a minority to feel a connection. Heck, many people &#40;notably
    westerners&#41; feel a strong connection with WHALES... It&#39;s like the Irish
    guy in The Commitments said: &#34;We&#39;re the niggers of Europe&#34;!  :-/ <BR>
    <BR>On the other hand, I do think that an Amerind reference shouldn&#39;t be too
    literal - which is why I didn&#39;t bother with that dark angular bird symbol
    - although Daniel brought a bird in anyway!  :-&#41; <BR> <BR>Sharktooth is an
    interesting suggestion - thanks. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>'

    &#40;using the triple-u&#41; in a good sturdy san serif on an arc and then apply
    the rays over it. i&#39;d use two good contrasting colors, one for the background
    and one for the rays &#40;maybe making the triple-u the solid ray color&#41; i&#39;d
    put in a second word within the arc &#40;i know you scratched that idea&#41; but
    i kinda like &#34;newworld newmedia&#34; but that might be too cheesy for ya &#40;but
    then you would use a ww-ligature and a wm-ligature ha ha&#41; and for a domain

    a <i>good</i> thing? <BR> <BR>For the &#34;vibration&#34; I&#39;m sure you mean
    the rays one, but is it a <i>bad</i> vibration? The annoyance it generates, could
    it be slight enough to be &#34;a feature and not a bug&#34;? Hard for me to see
    &#34;from inside&#34;. That and the earlier version with the heavier outside rays
    give the logo a nice dynamism, a rawness, no? Dunno. I have an aversion to it
    looking too polished, too static. Do remember this is multimedia work &#40;in
    terms of movement&#41;. <BR> <BR>You can tell I&#39;m thinking out loud here.

    like they&#39;re wrapped on a sphere, with a circle/dot at the intersection. That
