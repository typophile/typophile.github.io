  on Wroc\u0142aw's (Poland) trams and buses.\r\nI'm looking for a clues about history
  of such typography use or just some background about history of such digit design.
  \r\nOf course it can't be connected with transportation but we're close to thinking
  it has some functional matter. \r\nI'll be very glad if you could help me a little
  with it. \r\n\r\n\r\nThank you very much.\r\n\r\n\r\nBest,\r\nWojtek"
