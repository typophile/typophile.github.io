body: "[img:sites/default/files/old-images/airheat_3738.jpg]\r\n\r\nThis font is very
  similar to Gusto Black by Bob Alonso and Churchward Freedom by Joseph Churchward
  but the difference is the slant to the \"A\", the angle to the ends of the crosspieces
  on the \"E\" and \"T\" and the curve of and drop on the tail of the \"R\". \r\n\r\nI
  do not know if the \"&\" is from the same font or was borrowed from another. \r\nThis
  is a vinyl sign.\r\n\r\nKevin"
