  body: "\r\nThanks, but, I had seen it too in my search. If you look at it, it's
    actually a poor attempt of creating something with very little reference. The
    lines are poorly shaped and mangled (sorry if the creator is reading this). While
    an attempt was made, I don't agree with the individual's choices in the continuation
    of the lettering. \r\n\r\nAny other ideas on this font?\r\n\r\n"
