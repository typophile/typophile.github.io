  body: Can't identify it but really doubting it could be a font as it. My hunch is
    a custom logo work on [[http://www.myfonts.com/search/bank+gothic|Bank Gothic]].

  body: I think it's based on <strong>[[http://www.findmyfont.com/index.php/fonts/font-preview?fset=Dafont-2%20%2F%20%28Freemium%29&ffam=Counter-Strike%20-%20Regular&fid=9cba236bd2c2b878e71760fde4de17ab&fsize=60&text=TECHFLY&fit=1|Counter

  body: Fivos is right, that's a font. Digged a bit more though and it happens original
    design is actually T-26 [[http://www.t26.com/fonts/115-Megahertz|Megahertz]],
    Counter Strike being a rip-off. 'Counter Strike' game logo design has been discussed
    many times on many forums stated as "based on Bank Gothic".
