Which is better, Linotype’s Stempel Garamond or Bitstream’s Original Garamond?

I’m referring to kerning and “technical polish”.

That may or may not be true for Arrus, but Iowan Old Style had oldstyle figures from the very start. Granted, they were not default in the U&lc fonts, being included in the Small Caps fonts instead. But this was a common enough arrangement in the days of its release, along the Adobe Expert model.

John was very thorough in this design, including many characters that the old formats couldn't adequately accommodate (like Catalan l-dot-l, fully-composed Polish ogonek characters, Croatian dyet) and which all had to be off-loaded to an "extension" font. All available in the 2001 release. John and Dennis were ahead of the curve.

You may feel that Bitstream is "indifferent" to oldstyle figures, but you can't use Iowan Old Style as an example.

That oldstyle figures were long a rarity for Bitstream is well known to anyone who shopped and bought from them, and this certainly applies to their versions of Garamond.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Thank you guys for all you comments. Unfortunately after going through all the Stempel Garamonds (and ilk) I found all digitizations  to be poor (Linotype) or incomplete (Bitstream). Most of the fonts I looked at had serious lapses in kerning. My favorite— “ara” as in garamond looks “gar” and “amond”.

I wanted something designed for text but crisp and “sculptural” enough to be used for occasional light-duty display work. 

I’ve narrowed it down to Merlo, with Rongel and Verdigris also right there. I already have Minion and I’m not a Sabon person.

Did I miss anything?

		<div class="commentbody">Loremipsum> Thank you again for your suggestions. Although I’m even more sure than ever about going with Merlo, I’m putting Corundum on my shopping list because its also super crisp, very well honed, and is an excellent value.

Freight is also on my list but not anytime soon.

Clifford; I love, not crisp, but I love that one too. Akira Kobayashi said he would release an opentype version. I’m waiting for that one.

I’m waiting for someone to do a serious learned reinterpretation of Kis. I like Tyrnavia very much. I just wish Gabor Kothay would come back to it and refine the kerning and perhaps the lowercase italic w. Also, improve diacritic placement. 
Font Bureau (Studio) has an interpretation of Kis. Very nice, but definitely suited to newspapers it doesn’t have the left handed swashes in the lowercase italics (that I like) that would make it feel more literary.

Nexus is also on my list. Very crisp and kinda funky.

But Merlo for sure is happening. Although, I wish it had a bold.

Thank you all for your responses. This was helpful.

Mike Diaz :-)

I bought this one. Whoooo hooooo!

I like Merlo so much better than Stempel by leaps and bounds. 

The kerning rocks. I love the crisp details. It sparkles to me.
