  body: "I agree that Filmotype Lucky is the closest.\r\nI keep bouncing into similar
    fonts. Here is Ahkio Light [img:sites/default/files/old-images/AhkioLightAsTWITTER_6392.gif]
    http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/mika-melvas/ahkio/ I mention this one mainly because
    it has one lighter weight and three heavier weights.\r\nDon"

    mentioned in the previous thread, Pat Snyder is the most likely digital creator,
    circa 1992,  using the name Snyder Speed Brush.\r\nAt least his explanation at
    http://www.fontspace.com/pat-snyder/snyder-speed-brush is plausible. \r\nDon"
