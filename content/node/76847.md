  body: "@Penn - Thanks. No practical reason for leaving out the crossbar. Just style
    and general minimalism. I did try it with the cross bar it but I thought it looked
    \"cleaner\" without it. I liked the \"four vertical bars\" thing, and with the
    crossbar that sort of disappears.\r\n\r\nDid you read it as \"THE\", or did you
    know that from seeing my original post?\r\n\r\nFurther thoughts on that?"

    have trouble with legibility. It reminds me of this: http://www.themill.com/\r\n\r\nAny
    other details you can give about the scope of the project? It might help in critiquing
    to know who the audience is, what the company does, etc."

  body: "@Penn - Great! I don't mind being compared to The Mill at all; maybe they
    were a subconscious influence on me. The site is going to be a science/tech \"Blogazine\"
    but will differentiate itself by being design-conscious, taking cues from industries
    like fashion or maybe high-end automotive.\r\n\r\n@BeauW - I sort of agree actually.
    The left-side \xA9 was a conscious decision to balance out the left side of the
    logo a little. Since the T and E aren't even the logo needs to be aligned a little
    to the left to compensate, and the \xA9 helped, somewhat. Alternative suggestions
    ?\r\n\r\nI appreciate the feedback guys!"

  body: "I would like to see it with three strokes.\r\n\r\nI think, it needs serifs,
    but maybe less extreme than yours. And maybe it is better, to slightly enlarge
    the distance between the vertical strokes. The small distance could be problematic
    in smaller sizes of the logo.\r\nHere only a skeleton. I don\u2019t mean, that
    it is better than yours. I invested a few minutes only. But I think, it would
    be worth to try it with three strokes:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/skeleton_3509.gif]\r\n\r\nAnd
    with regard to the copyright sign, I agree, that it is actually misplaced."

  body: "You could try giving the T a larger stem serif to balance it. Although this
    is supposed to have a geometric look, I think making that stem serif a little
    thicker would not ruin the look. You might try shortening the arm on that T as
    well.\r\n\r\nAlthough the copyright symbol doesn't necessarily look \"correct\",
    in this case I think it adds to the look of the design to use that sort of placement.
    As if, perhaps to say \"I do not abide by the rules, I am fashionable, I am cool.\"\r\n\r\nMaybe
    I should make a minimalist geometric didone font..."

  body: I had hard time understanding what it said. T and E are obvious enough, but
    given the treatment of T the middle part is pretty ambiguous. My guess was that
    this said "TILE". It being "THE" did not occur to me until I read first reply.

    for the \xA9 in a logo. Any references?\r\n\r\n@Arno - Maybe I misunderstood,
    but what were your suggestions aiming to fix?\r\n\r\n@Brian - It's funny that
    you mention the T serif, because I had a working version for a long time where
    that serif was about 30-40% longer; maybe I should revert. It's fun to think I
    might have been a part of inspiring your future minimalist geometric didone! ;)\r\n\r\n@apankrat
    - It is ambiguous. I was surprised that others immediately read it correctly,
    because to me it sits on the fence between legibility and abstraction. I absolutely
    see where you got the \"TILE\" from. :) While legibility isn't a huge factor (this
    mark will usually be accompanied by the full name) I was just happy to see that
    it wasn't nearly as abstract as I thought. Thanks for the feedback!"

    from that I would like to see the logo with three vertical stems only, which does
    not mean, that the logo would be better with three stems. I only would like to
    see it. With the H-bar and the rest of the right side of the horizontal stem of
    the T."
