  love the rounded 'A'.\r\n\r\nBut before I do so, I'd like to know if there are any
  other sans serif typefaces with this kind of 'A'?\r\nIf possible, the 'M' should
  have vertical legs.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance,\r\n\r\nSeb\r\n\r\nPS. Nick if you
  read this, when will the opentype version be available?"
