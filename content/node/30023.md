    to that masterpiece of art, though it is a possible workaround. There, the 1st
    letter of the 2nd word (ALif) and its mirror have been combined into a slit-arrow
    to stand for Male as well as female. The Nukta (dot) centered above the said slit
    adds more meaning to the female dimension.\r\n\r\nSorry for the Confusion.\r\n\r\n"

    between Arabic calligraphy and Latin Typography. While both are just 2 different
    issues.\r\n\r\nOne thing about Latin letters they are not just treated in typography,
    Latin letters have their own calligraphy too. And a lot of old scripts have overlaps
    and complex forms just like Arabic calligraphy. Did You think about comparing
    an old Latin calligraphic script with an old Arabic calligraphic script? However,
    Calligraphy and Typography are just different, and as the Arabic has been rich
    in Calligraphy, it has to be rich in typography too, and both  have different
    values of quality. At least if Calligraphy is about the beauty of the sign's form,
    typography is about the readability and legibility of sign's form.. and excuse
    me, so far I fail to see the type of font in our Arabic world that really cares
    about \" readability\" yet, they mostly are a poor or clever transforming of a
    calligraphic font, or just an ugly/pretty display font. \r\n\r\n\r\nA."
