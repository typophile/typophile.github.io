  sans fonts</a> seem to be (or have been) rather plentiful and/or marketable in the
  last couple of decades. In the nineties when Dax became popular the style felt fresh
  but these days for me the genre has been done to death, so the new Adobe Clean (as
  a current example) feels a bit faddish. \r\n\r\nI'm wondering whether the style
  is still useful. Do people still need spurless sanses? More precisely, I'm considering
  putting a set of alternate spurless variants in my font <a href=\"http://www.typophile.com/node/65841\">Gecko</a>.
  My reservation is that it could look contrived \u2014 since the base font has spurs,
  the last thing I'd want to do is pay lip service to a wholly different (incompatible?)
  genre. On the other hand it could add value to the font as the typographer would
  have two fonts in one.\r\n\r\nHere's a screen capture to better judge. Any thoughts
  very welcome.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Gecko-Spurless_4164.gif]\r\n(And
  there's an alternate g and e in the second one too)"
