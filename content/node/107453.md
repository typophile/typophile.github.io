body: "Hello,\r\n\r\nI installed the LisuUnicode font https://github.com/phjamr/LisuUnicode/blob/master/LisuUnicode-Regular.ttf
  on Windows 7 and it won't display unless you specify that you want to use that font.
  For example, if you select the Lisu font in Microsoft Word, it will display the
  Lisu input, but if you want to do anything in an another WIndows program, like Internet
  Explorer, it will just display boxes (unless the website has it specified in its
  stylesheet, that the font should be used). Interestingly it will always display
  in Firefox, but not in other browsers or in QQ (a chat program Chinese people frequently
  use). Lisu is a Chinese minority and there are a number of fonts available, but
  none works under Windows 7 or lower. \r\n\r\nThe font works fine in Windows 8, as
  well as on a Mac. Apparently also no problem on Linux. So why doesn't it display
  on older Windows versions, even though it is a Unicode font? We would really like
  to get the font working in any Windows program, so that the Lisu minority can start
  to communicate in their own language.\r\n\r\nThank you for any suggestions.\r\n\r\nPhilip"
