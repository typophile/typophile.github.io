This is called "working on speculation" and is considered by many to be highly irresponsible, unprofessional and even disrespectful to the practice. It takes advantage of young designers trying to enter the field and devalues what we do as professionals. If you want a quality product, find the right person for the job, and pay them their fee. As you would a doctor or lawyer.

I cannot speak for others, and I do not fully understand what social media "strategy" is, but from my experience here, I do not think this is the place one goes to create a profile to announce logo contests and hope to get a good deal. On top of that, I am fairly certain isn't the place to advertise your new robot company.

You will however find hundreds, if not thousands or people with a very keen and diverse set of interests around the field of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Typography">typography</a> who will be more than willing to provide you with advice, consultation &c which may even lead to a lasting professional relationship.

That's even more manipulative that asking someone to work on spec. Not to mention shamelessly bumping your own post.

Ask any freelance designer how many times they have heard a client say "I know the budget for this job is small, but if it goes over well, there <em>may</em> be lots more work for you in the future!"

I suggest making a <a href ="http://www.facebook.com/">facebook</a> page for this.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I agree with Christopher. It's one thing for a charity or non-profit to ask for spec work, but this sounds like a profit-making company that just doesn't want to pay professional wages.

I doubt if they'd ask a bunch of accountants or electricians or plumbers to work under a similar arrangement, but somehow it's okay to ask designers to work that way.</div>
