  for helvetica. I couldn't have been the first to notice it, could I?

    word. Sorry. That's why it isn't in the dictionary. However, if you look up \"Helvetia,\"
    you will see this:\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/helvetia_6003.png]\r\n\r\nNow,
    if you looked up \"Helvetica\" in an encyclopedia and didn't find it... OK, that
    might be cause for alarm! :-)\r\n\r\n[EDIT] Here are some more words I found,
    all related to \"Helvetia\":\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/helveti_more_5463.png]"
