body: "Hi guys, this has gotten me stumped and I thought I'd turn to the experts for
  some help. I would be happy with something that's just close and isn't exact, but
  that triangular capital A is something I've never seen before in a typeface like
  this.\r\n\r\nThe subject says it all: this is from a photo presumably taken in Manila
  some time before the building got damaged in a fire in 1931.\r\n\r\nI'm hoping you
  could help me out! Thanks."
