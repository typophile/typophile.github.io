body: "Hey guys, making an old logo vector. Was just hoping for a little verification
  on weights and possibly even fonts if I'm off. \r\n\r\nTrinity Community appears
  to be Adobe Garamond Pro with small caps. I'm not positive on the weight though.
  Nothing seems to be right on and I'm assuming that's just because I haven't begun
  the squashing process as it looks like both fonts have been squashed flat.\r\n\r\nI
  believe Ministries is just Futura extra bold with the same squashing as Trinity
  which is why letters may be a bit off. \r\n\r\nAny other ideas out there?"

  body: "Thank you Mark. I had tried out Minion and for some reason had been drawn
    back to Garamond. I was able to use Minion and with the right sqooshing it's right
    on point. So, thanks again!\r\n\r\nIt makes me sad that I have to sqoosh these
    fonts. A little piece of me is dying on this project."
