  body: Condensed fonts are narrower than the regular version in that typeface, extended
    just the opposite--they are wider.

  body: "Well, what do you think? That\u2019s what counts, right?\r\n\r\nGenerally,
    I find extended cuts a little luxurious. At least the type setter has the <em>luxury</em>
    to waste space with wide letters. :^) Of course there are wide fonts that are
    not luxurious at all.\r\n\r\nMaybe somebody knows are the extended fonts luxurious
    on their own or is just because their used on luxurious products.\r\n\r\nCondensed
    cuts don\u2019t convey that type of message to me. I think they\u2019re more something
    that grew because they were needed, more text on a line or taller headlines.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.designingwithtype.com/"

  body: Sorry, garden. It depends in part on the design of the face. There are some
    truly elegant art deco fonts that are condensed. It does seem, though, that type
    set with additional space (wide letters, ample word and letter spacing, and extra
    leading) does have an air of luxury, generally speaking. And if done with letterpress,
    that much better. Of course there are always exceptions.

    Now, a headline set in a condensed grotesque starts to speak in the tones of mid-century

    the page? We're looking at 1800s advertising type. Palatino stretched in PageMaker
    so that it fills the width of the column? Why, it's 1990 and we're in the middle

  body: "I prefer to privilege function over allusion.\r\nIn other words, it's how
    a condensed or extended face is used in a layout that determines its effect.\r\n\r\nA
    condensed face may be considered horizontally compressed (narrow), or vertically
    stretched (tall). These convey two quite different feelings -- either restricted
    or expansive.\r\n\r\nFactors like how big the condensed form is in relation to
    the page, and other type and graphics on the page, determine what kind of a feeling,
    symbolism, or meaning, it conveys.\r\n\r\nOne thing: the amount of tracking (letterspacing)
    applied to a condensed face makes a huge difference to its effect, especially
    for all caps. But extended forms almost always look best set quite tight."

  body: so if someone wants to apply something more luxurious for condensed type (
    as I am requested for a logotype for a photographer) it is better to set it wider?

  body: "<em> it is better to set it wider?</em>\r\n\r\nAs I said, it is the layout
    as a whole that determines the effect.\r\nSo you have to take into consideration
    how big it is on the page/card, and its relation with the other type. Also, the
    weight and style of the face have some bearing on the matter. And be more precise
    in your analysis -- does \"wider\" mean horizontally stretched, tracked out, or
    occupying more width?\r\n\r\nTypography is a practical matter. Sure, you can follow
    Bringhurst's \"rules\" as a starting point, but it only takes you so far. Beyond
    that, you have to try out variations and see what looks best. If you have no opinion
    as to whether one setting looks better than another, you should get someone else
    to do the job.\r\n\r\nThis story about a newspaper editor's relationship with
    his work \r\nhas a wide relevance, and may be applied to typography also: \r\nThe
    process of editing was neatly articulated by Ralph Ingersoll, \r\nwho helped launch
    Life and Fortune magazines in the USA in the thirties: \r\n\r\n\u201CAn editor
    may pass for print only what pleases him. It is his own taste \r\nhe must discover.
    If he then finds that people share his taste and like \r\nor enjoy or approve
    of what his taste has chosen, then he is a successful \r\neditor. If they don\u2019t,
    then he had better choose another trade, for no man \r\ncan base his choice on
    what he imagines or reasons other people MIGHT like.\u201D \r\n\r\nHaving said
    that, Ingersoll went on to launch his own daily newspaper \r\n\u2013- PM -- in
    New York City. It failed. He became an author. "
