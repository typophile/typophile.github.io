body: 'Hi <BR> <BR>I&#39;m creating a pixellike font that consists of: <BR>1 - the
  normal typeface <BR>2 - and pictos &#40;pictograms&#41; <BR> <BR>I want to have
  one family name &#40;Pharma&#41; with 2 styles <BR>1 - regular <BR>2 - pictos <BR>
  <BR>As i want the font to be crossplatform, i generated &#40;using FL&#41;: <BR>1
  - Pharma normal.ttf <BR>2 - Pharma pictos.ttf <BR> <BR>Than activated both in suitcase,
  they nicely work in apples textedit &#40;in the menu i have the Pharma-family and
  can choose between normal and pictos&#41; <BR>However in adobeprograms like illu
  or photoshop, it&#39;s only the Pharma normal that shows up, ignoring the second
  one with the pictos. <BR>I already read the thread about this issues <a href="http://groups.msn.com/fontlab/tipsandtricks.msnw?action=get_message&amp;mview=0&amp;ID_Message=2843"
  target="_blank">http://groups.msn.com/fontlab/tipsandtricks.msnw?action=get_message&amp;mview=0&amp;ID_Message=2843</a>
  <BR>But this is very confusing to me. Isn&#39;t there a simple solution to my problem?
  I mean if textedit can handle the fonts why can&#39;t Illu, Ps or Indesign? <BR>Thanks
  a lot <BR> <BR>Gilles'
