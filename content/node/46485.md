  again, design and typography go mainstream for a little while. :P\r\n\r\nruD"

  body: "Si posted an article about the same study (different source, though) not
    too long ago. I think there are a few fatal flaws, chief among them that the researcher
    accepts that certain typefaces are more legible as a pre-accepted fact. I would
    have preferred they pick one or two defining typefaces for certain styles (Garamond
    and Centaur for oldstyle, Baskerville for transitional, Didot for modern, Futura
    and Century Gothic for geometric sans, Frutiger and Meta for humanist sans, etc.),
    then instead of evaluating readability vs. perceptions, only talk about the perceptions
    associated with each style. Then set those only in black-on white, all caps, small
    caps, no caps, and at different point sizes.\r\n\r\nThe study may have been that
    complex, but the article portrays it as very simplistic, especially talking about
    comparing an easy-to-read Arial with a more difficult Mistral. Under those criteria,
    Mistral falls into the same category as, say, 8 pt. Goudy or something since it's
    harder to read than 12 pt. Arial.\r\n\r\nOh, well, I guess the fact that this
    is being researched is a step in the right direction.\r\n\r\nEDIT: I like the
    ending of the article, though. The best menus are those that have only the name
    of the dish with the price, preferably without a dollar sign or any change. The
    name of the dish can be as complex as you want, but descriptions under the dish
    detracts from the experience, in my opinion."

  body: "Well, apparently they didn't bother to chime in on someone knowledgeable
    about the stuff. But then again, I think their focus was more superficial, so
    it's understandable. I mean, their focus was more on the end-user, so they used
    an end-user \u201Cmental frame\u201D. It may probably be considered not so scientific,
    but I think science is a lot more subjective than what is generally publicized.\r\nAlso,
    someone knowledgeable would probably see no point in making such study\u2026 so,
    yeah, I guess the main thing is that some people tried to study this in some way
    (different from our own biased point of view), which, in the end and in more than
    one way, can only be seen as a good thing.\r\n\r\nruD"
