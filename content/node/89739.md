body: Hey all, I was trying to think of some variations to my resume that I can use.
  I'm trying to everything pretty similar business card and site wise. I'm wanting
  a typeface that is good read small and condensed but might still be good in all
  UPPERCASE for the information? Should I just stick to using serif for the information?
  I'm just trying to experiment, I could always fall back on my Scala Sans and Scala
  Regular... Thanks in advance! I made a "logo" based off of the <a href="http://www.dafont.com/headline-hplhs.font">headline</a>
  This is ONLY used in the top of the resume and I don't plan on using it anywhere
  else but just to give something to help figure out actual practical type compliments.
