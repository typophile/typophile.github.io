  a few like it. I got the shot off coudal.com. <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/24444.jpg"

  body: nope. its very close to neutraface titling but the &#34;G&#34; doesn&#39;t
    match. <BR> <BR>I should have known it better. If it was so simple the typophile
    id-gurus  <BR>still had posted the answer.

  body: There are two variations on cap G in Neutra Display Titling. What don&#39;t
    you find to be the same?

  body: Neutraface  Display comes with 2 G&#39;s, one of which matches the sample.
    I have their catalog and it shows them both.

    alternates shown.

    Just hang on a bit.

  body: OK. Here is the sample page. It doesn&#39;t show all weights, but these are
    the characters and alternates. The rounded G is the one used in the posted sample.

  body: 'Daniel, When I look around Schwab&#39;s site, the navigation font is a bold
    Sans, but not Neutraface. Futura, Metro and Kabel are similar to it, but they
    have splayed M&#39;s. Nobel  has flattened apex of N, but the M is better. Offhand
    I can&#39;t pick one font that matches both criteria: straight-sided M, pointed
    apex on N. Maybe he used Nobel with a Futura N?'

  body: 'Hi Daniel, <BR> <BR>I suspect Schwwab&#39;s font is a custom one based on
    his lettering. This is conceivable given his illustrative superstardom. As you
    look through his posters and logos you find the same heavy deco sans lettering,
    but there are slight variations in weight and form which says to me that he is
    drawing his letters. To Mike&#39;s observations about the hallmarks of his lettering
    I would add: slightly rounded corners and a very dark A. These qualities are also
    found in the navigation font, though I suspect it&#39;s a digital version given
    it&#39;s regularity. <BR> <BR>I&#39;ve always enjoyed Schwab&#39;s type. If you
    want to match it, for a logo, i&#39;d suggest drawing :-&#41; <BR>Or if you haven&#39;t
    got time, then the alternatives mentioned plus Mark&#39;s <a href="http://www.ms-studio.com/FontSales/mostra.html">Moestra</a>
