  is a way to get type to snap to the top left edges (for left aligned type) of a

  body: You can do it manually by shifting the baseline (for the vertical position),
    and adding a space before the first character and kerning the text against it
    (for the horizontal position). Depending on your motives, it might be quicker
    to just move/enlarge the text frame, so that it is the text that optically aligns
    with your guideline, and not the (optically irrelevant) text box edge.

    (leading, baseline, height etc.). Probably one of these options would produce
    the vertical snap effect you want.\r\n\r\nOn left snapping, you can try optical
    margins (Story Panel) to reduce this space. anyway, be aware optical margin alignment
    may dislocate some glyphs a bit outside the box (as A).\r\n\r\nI can add menu

    does anyone know why I shouldn't want to do this?\r\n\r\nHmmm... maybe if you
    want to snap the text box to the same guideline that's used by a different printing
    object (like a rule or photo box). If there's no text inset, the type will butt
    that object. Having a text inset allows you to align both objects to the same
    guideline and still maintain some white space between the printing elements. If
    you have to do that many times in a layout, might save a little time."

    I agree that when this level of precision is available and so readily available
    at that, it is lazy not to use it. This is Typophile - sorry to refute Mr Sipe
    so thoroughly but Typophile is largely concerned with taking a great deal of care
    with all these things, from layout, to even finer work like kerning. Worry no,
    care absolutely. Apologies in advance, I just find it frustrating that this attitude
    is prevalent in design in general. To encounter it here I find baffling.\r\n\r\nAligning
    to the top of the frame is easy as explained before in First Baseline menu to
    \ Cap-Height.\r\nHowever regarding align left, there is a good reason not to,
    as Frode rightly pointed out, to accommodate the side bearings of the font. Whereas
    a line beginning with A will sit left of the frame, one beginning with j will
    generally peak out of the frame, creating an optical alignment from top to bottom.\r\n\r\nYou
    can check Optical Margin Alignment (Window>Type & Tables>Story) but I don't fully

    I'm misunderstanding, but are you saying that using a text inset of \"0\" on the
    left edge will result in inferior alignment of text which is left-aligned? I did
    a quick test using both 0 inset on left edge and 1 pica inset on left edge, and
    it didn't appear to affect the quality of the alignment."

  body: "Let me check again James as I'm confused by what you mean. Surely inset of
    zero is default and preferred for text? Sorry if I am misunderstanding your point.
    The initial problem in the thread that remains unsolved is to get the text to
    butt the frame to the left, but this is character and line specific, by default
    some letters won't butt it at all, some will and others will overshoot it to the
    left.\r\n\r\nThe default left edge of a text block consisting of several lines
    at text size, placed in a grid beneath an image, ought to look correct as the
    number of characters overshooting will make up for those undershooting, so to
    speak, an average optical line will appear. \r\n\r\nI can see your problem at
    display sizes but it is not necessarily correct to align characters by their most
    extreme left protrusion. If your first letter was O then aligning the extrema
    of the curve to the extreme coordinate of the image above would still result in
    the O appearing indented. Continue this logic and all the initial characters might
    align to the above image but none will align to each other.\r\n\r\nSo a line by
    line aligning to extrema solution seems ineffective. \r\n\r\nAlternatively align
    the content to the gutter by picking a straight sided letter and positioning the
    text frame so that this straight sided letter appears aligned to the gutter. This
    way the O will actually protrude into the gutter but might feel optically correct
    with the image above. However the protrusion of some characters into the gutter
    will affect the overall white value of the gutters themselves.\r\n\r\nSo a complete
    text frame option is not really the answer either and does not have snappy functionality.\r\n\r\nHope
    somebody else can offer more complete solution.\r\n\r\n@ Martin, glad to hear
    it."

  body: "InDesign does not have a control like this. And this align procedure is just
    plausible for display sizes, not for normal/small ones.\r\n\r\nTwo workarounds:\r\n\r\n1.
    Type the first line of text in a text frame. Set format. Convert it to outlines
    (Crtl+Shift+O). You now have a group of vectors which may be placed exaclet besides
    your line/margin.\r\n\r\n2. Design a line. Choose text in path tool, click on
    the line and type text. Align this text anywhere.\r\n\r\nBoth solutions are for
    one line at a time. Anyway, I think this is not an issue as text in display sizes
    are usually in small. For text is set in small sizes, don't try to force this
    alignment. As Andrew (1985) pointed, this leads to misaligned first letter in
    multiple lines."

    clear. I wasn't expressing an opinion over which inset setting was preferable.
    Rather I was responding to someone who said -- if I understood correctly -- that
    an inset of zero resulted in inferior alignment of left-aligned text, which I
    don't believe is correct. \r\n\r\nIn other words, I'm saying that an inset has
    no affect on the quality of text alignment within that frame.\r\n\r\nPersonally,
    I always use an inset of zero (the default), unless there is some special reason
    not to. When would I use an inset? Mostly it's in situations where I want some
    text to be inside a visible box, so I apply a stroke to the text frame and inset
    the text to provide a margin between the stroke and the text.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    quick fix that leaves the frame snapped to the guide or margin is to insert a

    with the guide. This is all with inset spacing at zero. [img:sites/default/files/old-images/aligning_5245.png]
