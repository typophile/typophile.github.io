  is using cage's rhythmic structure, and second a basic story passage, thirdly a
  more decorative poem...\r\n\r\nany comments would be great!\r\n\r\nSecondly.. I
  was going to call it 'Generated Poetry', but now it isn't just poetry... short stories
  are included as well. I want the book to be slightly humanistic to contrast with
  the computer generated spam (hence the layout). So far possible titles are:\r\n-
  Generated Language\r\n- Generated Voice\r\n- Generated Prose\r\n- Generated Sonant\r\n-
  Generated Utterance\r\n\r\nGenerated could be replaced with:\r\nManufactured/Created/Automated\r\n\r\nWhat
  I want from the title is a contrast, unfortunately my grasp of the English Language
  is not so great.\r\n\r\nThanks for any suggestions.\r\nClaire"

  body: "The decorative poem looks good, the trouble with critting this is the limitless
    options, a hundred different designers would probably do it a hundred different
    ways. The short story layout is a bit wide in the measure and the margins seem
    out of balance, the middle margins are a bit broad. For the Cage style you could
    look at justifying the right margin (while still keeping the aligned punctuation).\r\n\r\nAs
    for the title I quite like Generated Voices, (or perhaps Received Voices), the
    plural adds to the humanist feel to me.\r\n\r\nTim"
