You're on your way to   <BR>achieving it.  <BR>  <BR>Cristian is right about the 'Y'. But I recognize your problem -   <BR>you were obviously trying to keep the middle bar consistent   <BR>on the 'Y' and 'R'. But the higher bars on the 'A' 'B' 'E' work  <BR>fine so there is room to raise it on the 'Y'. Or, are you   <BR>opposed to a descender?  <BR>  <BR>Consistent widths is a definite issue here. In addition to  <BR>Cristian's comments, I'll add that the 'J' seems too wide and  <BR>the 'H' too narrow.  <BR>  <BR>The 'H' also feels too straight with the flat ends. I wonder if  <BR>there's a way to give them an angle as on the 'A' and 'N'.   <BR>See if you can make it happen without a Hobo effect. <BR> <BR>The 'B' and 'S' look fine to me.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">This is rockin'. I'd agree with Stephen that the 'J' seems too wide - maybe it should be more along the lines of 'L.' I might say too that the 'T' feels a bit too straight. Also, much like the 'Y,' the '2' seems too have some quirky proportions because of the middle bar or spine.  <BR> <BR>I wonder if modeling the 'W' after conjoined 'U's insteaded of 'V's might be worth trying. Or perhaps modifying a rotated 'E.' <BR> <BR>Love the 'Q' and the 'X' is great.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">This is fantabulous! <BR> <BR>But the 6 and 9 don't look very stable. Maybe move the tails just a wee bit more towards the axis. <BR> <BR>J, U and V look too wide, optically at least. <BR> <BR>The ampersand could do with more curves, no? It looks bolder than the rest now. Try it with a back like the &quot;3&quot;? <BR> <BR>I think the horizontal bars on the Euro and the Yen might be too thin. <BR> <BR>Just my two cents. <BR> <BR>When it's done be sure to tell us where to get it. <BR> <BR></div>

		<div class="commentbody">Paul, your Polish <i>ew</i> (Lslash) is pretty good: the bar crosses the stem at just the right height and has a really good length. I would probably increase the angle off the horizontal just a bit more though. Since you've done such a good job with this diacritic letter, I really encourage you to do the rest of the Polish letters and extend the languagre coverage for the central European, Baltic and Turkish character sets. I think you would have a lot of fun doing this, and would increase the value of the font.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Thanks, Karen, John, Yves et al. <BR> <BR>John: I'm happy you like my <i>ew</i>.  I studied them for some time to figure out the positioning, but I agree about the angle. <BR> <BR>I'd actually like to do not only more Latin language coverage, but perhaps some other scripts.  I've already sketched out Thai letters, just to see how it might work.  From reading the threads here and at Typographica (especially Hrant's comments), I gather it will be an interesting challenge to &quot;keep it real&quot; in other scripts, so to speak. <BR> <BR>Paul</div>
