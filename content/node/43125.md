  concepts were for a film production company that focuses on horror. The name relates
  to a ghost story where a woman is picked up by a lake and dropped off. The driver
  later discovers that she was a ghost.\r\n\r\nAnyway, we went through several ideas
  and ended up going with a type treatment that was finally bastardized and combined
  with some animation.\r\n\r\nPlease, if you have a moment, comment on which are the
  least appropriate. I\u2019m looking for a kill list, but like the depth of development
  in general.\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/concepts_3933.png]"

    is worth for further development. It is simple, clear and you can imagine it immediately
    animated."

    the single line waves and the matching type.\r\n\r\nNo offense, but he chic in
    the bottom image has a huge butt."

  body: "@ Nora. Thanks. That is the direction I wished the client had followed.\r\n\r\n@
    Andrew. I thought this concept was of the period associated with the story. Clearly
    there are too many ideas\u2014ghost story, lake, film production. The illustrated
    version with the woman is fabric rather than butt, but it doesn\u2019t read well
    or reduce well. The other issue is that she needed to be wet from having come
    from the lake. Freakin\u2019 Hollywood!\r\n\r\n"

  body: I'd kill the one with the film sprockets. I'd also kill the version with the
    woman. And the one with the five wavy lines. And the top one too. I like the other
    two for different reasons. The one Nora highlights is the most simple, but the
    other might really be amazing to translate into motion. Well, I guess they both
    would but I'm seeing something different from each.

  body: "I'd lose the one with the woman (somehow it reminds me of food) and the one
    with the sprockets; I don't think they animate particularly well. The ones with
    a lake as the background work best if animated, I think, especially the first
    one (I REALLY like it!)\r\n\r\nGood luck!"

    have you ever noticed how many movies roll the opening credits over water?"

    over water?</cite>\r\n\r\nI had this idea; I envisioned the screen filling up
    with water, very clear water with a blue tinted back ground, the water sloshing
    back and forth until it fills completely to the top. then a small white pebble
    is dropped in, light enough that it slowly saunters back and forth as it falls.
    Landing lightly on the bottom of the screen, then next to it, the words, Whiterock
    Lake fade in.\r\n\r\n-Corny, but it sounds like something I'd see in the opening
    credits."

  body: Most of the looks remind me of a beverage company logo. Maybe less lake more
    ghost. How about the type forming the ghost or imposed on the contour of the ghost.
    Nothing scares me

  body: "I found the original.\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/OneMore_4762.png]\r\n\r\nThe
    basic story is that a couple driving at night along the shore of White Rock Lake
    comes upon a young woman that is soaking wet. They stop and give her a ride. As
    they drive along toward the address she has given they turn to the back seat and
    notice that she is gone, but the seat of the car is damp.\r\n\r\nThe next day
    they go to the address and inquire to find that there was a young woman that had
    lived there, but she had died in an auto accident years ago on the the same night
    when the car she was riding in drove into the lake.\r\n\r\nHere are some cool
    images.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.whiterocklake.org/?page_id=564\r\n\r\nYou can google
    and see what Aaron came up with. He does character design/visualization and was
    understandably set on rendering something himself. Although I suggested the type
    treatment what is on the page is not what I gave them to work with so no nasty
    comments."

    \"feel some (mystic) scare\", is the motive with the leaveless tree plus the lake
    behind.\r\nThe abstracted waves + the extended grotesk motive looks \"60s, 70s
    retro style\" to me, i do not connect it with \"horror movies\".\r\nSeries No.
    1 looks interesting to me. Maybe start another series with this type and type
    treatment, that combines this special art deco feeling with horror."
