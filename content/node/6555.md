  body: Hi Kerry,   <BR>We ought to have an FAQ about sports jerseys of professional
    teams, but what it would say is that the lettering and logos for professional
    sports teams are almost always custom font designs. The teams and leagues do this
    for the reason that it makes it hard for anyone to imitate their products -- and
    it&#39;s all about marketing.  <BR> <BR>There are font designers like Dennis Ortiz-Lopez
    who specialize in designing fonts for sports franchises. <BR> <BR>Sorry.

  body: Mike, I think your statement might be a bit broad -- the logo for the major
    league baseball team here in Phoenix &#40;the woeful Arizona Diamondbacks&#41;
    uses a barely modified setting of Emigre&#39;s Matrix.  <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/48363.jpg"

    <BR>Go Vikes! <BR> <BR>&#40;Granted, this logo was spawned in the &#39;60s&#41;

    There is also the chance that with a serif font like that, especially using all
    caps, that it might be hard not to look like <i>some</i> serif font. Is the high-centered
    M  the &#39;Matrix&#39; earmark that makes your case? It seems like a name as
    long as DIAMONDBACKS would dictate as narrow an M as possible, and that style
    would fill the bill. Matrix isn&#39;t the only serif font with that kind of M,
    -- Red Rooster Kingsrow is another, for example --  but my point is still that
    <b>most</b> team lettering and logos, particularly newer teams, try to be distinctive
    so that they are more marketable, and harder to imitate. The Vikings  &#40;Futura
    Black&#41; is an exception, and as noted has been around a long time. If we were
    to make lists of the pro teams, I doubt many would use commercial fonts, but I&#39;m
    not ready to take on that task.
