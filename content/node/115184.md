  body: It's just an educated guess, but I suspect that is just clipart, Anthony.
    The fact that I find the letters on their Pulse Choir web page in an old ClickArt
    catalog supports this.

  body: Many thanks Mike, do you think that the COHS that appear on the file I uploaded
    have just been 'cobbled' together? If so I'll stop looking for the complete set.
