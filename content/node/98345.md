body: "Hi everybody,\r\n\r\nfirst I'm going to briefly introduce myself (silent reader
  and observer for a longer time, now finally joined):\r\nMy name is Cornelia but
  I prefer to be called Conny, I'm 26 and studying media design at Rheinische Fachhochschule
  K\xF6ln (Cologne), what I really enjoy, it is a great experience with a lot of demandful
  tasks. Like the one I could need your help:\r\n\r\nMy topic will need some space.\r\nI
  am planning on printing a booklet that contains a potrait about the \"Didot\" font.
  (I'm afraid my English is a bit rusty, please don't hesitate to correct me in case
  of failing at technical terms.)\r\n\r\nIt is a task at my typography discipline
  (Rheinische Fachhochschule K\xF6ln). Every student does another font.\r\nI already
  did a presentation about \"Didot\" (Only showed the sources of picture-like files,
  because the other stuff (what are the characteristics, which differences between
  Didot and Bodoni are noticeable) I can see and explain by myself. (I got a completed
  vocational training as media designer and I think I got some experience in dealing
  with typography)\r\n\r\nI really want this booklet to be something special. It should
  not be filled with web-based sources only or none at all.\r\nMy problem is:\r\nI
  am desperately looking for books or other sources that are based on scientific evidence.
  Especially on some facts.\r\nI did the presentation with most web-based sources,
  which is okay, cause it are links to blogs by people that love typography and got
  some experience, but for something like a printed booklet I think it really should
  be properly researched.\r\n\r\nIt should be about at least 28-32 pages with information
  about \"historical\" and \"digital\" Didots. I want to show when it first got revealed,
  by whom, why, where, how popular it was, its history, where it was used at the very
  first, a comparison to its biggest rivale, Bodoni, the specimen of Didot, the new
  digitized fonts (esp. the usefull ones that are built with lots of signs - don't
  know how to say in english right now, sorry): HTF, Linotype, URW, DPS, and say briefly
  what the differences are and which ones are the \"best built ones\" if you know
  what I mean.\r\n\r\nFacts that I got without real sources:\r\n\r\n(releasing) Designer:
  Firmin Didot, released at 1784 (http://ilovetypography.com/2008/05/30/a-brief-history-of-type-part-4/)
  Problem: Where does that information come from? There is no source at this article
  about it), inspired by Baskerville (so is Bodoni, => comparison, same source again,
  is this true?!)\r\n\r\nFirst printed thing with Didot font was \"La Henriade\" (Voltaire),
  which was printed by Firmins brother, Pierre in 1819 http://catalogue.drouot.com/ref-drouot/lot-ventes-aux-encheres-drouot.jsp?id=2548072\r\nI
  don't know where I could find a source for the fact, this was the first \"thing\",
  for which Didot (by Firmin) was used while printing.\r\n\r\nIt's character is shaped
  by the sense of enlightenment (I read this somewhere, but don't have a source).
  I kind of did my own interpretation based on the therm enlightenment, the mood of
  french people at that time and the specimen of the Didone.\r\n\r\nWhy do Didot and
  Bodoni look SO similar? I mean, okay, both font designers loved Baskerville (based
  on ilovetypography.com again), but can you really rely on that one fact? And where
  is the source for this?\r\n\r\nhttp://www.fonts.com/content/learning/fontology/level-1/type-families/didone
  says  \"Frutiger also studied the Didot types in a book printed by the Didots in
  1818, La Henriade by Voltaire\" - again no real source.\r\n\r\nI already wrote an
  e-mail to stehaufsatz.com and got an answer from Schmitz with some sources I already
  ordered at the library and can borrow next monday, but some french books too, which
  leads me to the next problem: I don't speak French.\r\n\r\n\"Specimen des nouveaux
  caract\xE8res de la fonderie et de l'imprimerie de P. Didot, l'ain\xE9\", Pierre
  Didot, 1819\r\n\"Sur le prix du papier dans l'antiquit\xE9\", \xC9mile Egger, 1857\r\n\"Sp\xE9cimens
  de caract\xE8res de Firmin et Jules Didot\", Andre\u0301 Jammes, 2002\r\n\r\nThese
  are those books. Is there a possibility some of those got translated into english?\r\n\r\nThen
  there was another book which is acutally in German:\r\n\r\n\"Wo der Buchstabe das
  Wort f\xFChrt\", Kurt Weidemann\r\n\r\nI know Weidemann but the library I am member
  at (cologne university) doesn't keep this one in stock.\r\nThere should be some
  pictures in it that could help me (referring to Sybille Schmitz - stehaufsatz.com)
  maybe.\r\n\r\nSources that I researched today and that I did not check yet (going
  to the library next monday):\r\n\r\n\"Das wohltemperierte Alphabet\", Axel Bertram\r\n\"Anatomy
  of a typeface didot\", Alexander S. Lawson\r\n\"The Didot Family and the progress
  of printin\", Albert Joseph George\r\n\r\nMaybe some of you already did a big research
  at didot and can help me with more tipps about sources that are needed or that prove
  the fundamental facts like \"who, when, where, why\"? Or say, the books I get monday
  are enough?\r\nNext problem:\r\nI wasn't able to find that much examples of using
  didot. An I'm not sure which examples are the most interesting ones.\r\nBeing aware
  of the fact that there are a lot of digital didot fonts and that fashion magazine
  got their own version built, this is what i found:\r\nhttp://maxboam.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/vibe1203-minaj.jpg\r\nhttp://www.harpersbazaar.com/cm/harpersbazaar/images/3R/4-hbz-editors-letter-greatest-hits-drew-mdn-81314190.jpg\r\nhttp://i599.photobucket.com/albums/tt74/vogue2891/Marlene_tfs_voguecover.jpg\r\nhttp://nashaification.blogspot.de/2012/09/type-5-examples-of-didot-linotype.html
  (bookcovers)\r\n\r\nFashion, fashion, fashion. HTF didot at Harpers Bazaar, another
  specified version for vogue, and so on. Then a lot of bookcovers. But what about
  other examples? Are these enough or do you as typographs want to see other examples
  with copytext or a more creative way of use? I ask this because of my docent. The
  booklet is his to evaluate and I want to impress him and do something I can be proud
  of. I am also concerned about hard- or softcover and size. I think I personally
  would prefer a hardcover version in DinA5 portrait format with matt pages. What
  would you like? I mean \"booklet\" itself should usually be softcover, but I think
  it may upgrade the appearance and reflect what I want to say: That one's better.
  More solid.\r\n\r\nBy the way Sybille Schmitz meant I should contact Mr. Frutiger.
  I'm wondering how that should be possible the whole time.. didn't find ONE contact
  adress even after an exhausting search.\r\n\r\nI hope I don't ask too much from
  you and my English isn't too rusty, didn't use it for a long time.\r\nMaybe I should
  have waited till I got those books and read a bit, but I'm already dying to start
  this thing.\r\nSorry for the long text but it's important to me and I feel like
  I need someone who's pushing me in the right direction.\r\n\r\nOf course I would
  love to show the result to you as soon as it's finished!\r\n\r\nHave a nice day!\r\n\r\nConny"

    evidence. Especially on some facts.</blockquote>\r\n\r\nOut of context this sounds
    reasonable enough, but in <em>this</em> context I'm having a hard time figuring
    out what you're really looking for... Could you explain?\r\n\r\n<blockquote>I

    the Baskerville connection: Bodoni was a great admirer of John Baskerville, and
    went on a trip to visit him. But he got sick along the way (in fact even before
    even leaving the borders of Italy) so he never made it.\r\n\r\n<blockquote>First
    printed thing with Didot font was \"La Henriade\" (Voltaire)</blockquote>\r\n\r\nHuh,
    interesting. When Beaumarchais brought Baskerville's punches to France to cast
    new type, it was to print Voltaire's complete works! BTW if you need any French
    passages translated just send them over.\r\n\r\nConcerning what might be fruitful
    to pursue: since the Didone style is so \"dramatic\" it would be interesting to
    see how much compromise is required when shooting for text sizes (since smaller
    sizes of type benefit by having features anathema to the Didone style). I believe
    a style have its preferred size range, and outside of that range it's not really
    itself. Can a Didone still be a Didone at 10 point?\r\n\r\nLastly, I would offer
    this favorite quote of mine:\r\n\"Bodoni would be an admirable letter for a death
    notice.\"\r\n\u2013 W. G. Ovink\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    reasonable enough, but in this context I'm having a hard time figuring out what

    primary sources, not secondary sources because of academic integrity.\r\nIt should
    be a scientific research, at least as far as I am able to do so. So I'm looking
    for proves for the facts I wrote, for example the ones I found at ilovetypography.com
    because this source would not be scientific.\r\n\r\n<blockquote>About the Baskerville

    But where is the source for this information? I know I can believe you, but I
    don't think that you found that out yourself, did you? So I'm looking for primary
    sources that prove these facts. Did you read this in a book? Is there another
    good book that is English or German and tells such interesting facts?\r\n\r\n<blockquote>Huh,
    interesting. When Beaumarchais brought Baskerville's punches to France to cast
    new type, it was to print Voltaire's complete works! BTW if you need any French
    passages translated just send them over.</blockquote>\r\n\r\nI don't know if you
    misunderstood me here. I meant, I read that the first printed thing those Didot
    types (fonttype Didot itself that Firmin released) were used was the Henriade
    and that it was printed by his brother Pierre with sterotype method. I don't know
    what you mean with this. Voltaire's work is older then Didot and already was printed
    some times before of course. I didn't mean \"La Henriade\" was printed first by
    Firmin Didot but the first thing he printed with the new typeface was \"La Henriade\"\r\nBut
    this are facts I also only read at the www. I want books that tell me more about
    it. And if possible in English or German.\r\n\r\nThanks for offering me translations,
    but I couldn't even find the passages I need, I don't understand one word. So
    I can't use French books.\r\n\r\n<blockquote>I believe a style have its preferred
    size range, and outside of that range it's not really itself. Can a Didone still
    be a Didone at 10 point?</blockquote>\r\nThis could be interesting. But maybe
    I need more original prints to compare.\r\n\r\nThat quote. True. Didn't look at
    the typeface like that till now. Always thought about soldiers, esp. because I
    read about that comparison already, but it could be gravestones too, indeed. I
    think it's even the better metaphor because it includes that gravestones can look
    elegant and beautiful.\r\n\r\nAbout the graph:\r\nIt's interesting that the gap
    between use and revival becomes smaller over the years. Maybe the need of more
    different typefaces was rising at about 1900. What does \"Modern\" mean? Modern,
    maybe already \"digitzed\" typefaces? Bodoni revived before Baskerville, it followed
    then. Hm.\r\nWhy can't I find Didot in it? And in books it is missing sometimes
    too. I recently bought a book \"Wegweiser Schrift\", and it tells some facts about
    specimen and stuff, of course Baskerville, yes, and Bodoni, and OH YES, Walbaum,
    too. But Didot? No. Why?\r\n\r\nBtw: I just wrote an e-mail to Mr. Porchez.\r\n\r\nSorry
    again, I know my English is hard to understand. Thanks for going through it though.\r\nThanks
    for helping me, I admit it!"
