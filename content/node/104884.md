  working on a new logo.  I am a documentary filmmaker and have worked on logo designs
  in the past but am no expert.  before i share my opinions with my colleagues and
  the graphic artist, I would love your input.  Our department offers a BA and MA
  \ in communication with concentrations in rhetoric, speech communication, health
  communication, media studies and production.  Thank you so much!"

    what they represent? Did he/she give an explanation?\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/concepts_5579.jpg]"

  body: "First symbol is more fitting for a photography business (due to crop/frame
    bracketing). Also the arrow contraption looks forced. Furthermore I'm not sure
    why arrows meet off-center and why they form a loop. I guess, basically, I'd like
    to echo James' question - what's the rationale behind the symbol?\r\n\r\nSecond
    symbol is just a knitting machine of some sort, sorry."
