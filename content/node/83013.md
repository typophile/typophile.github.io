  I will gladly take the flak if this would result in a funded kickstarter project.
  I would be bummed out if this project doesn't get funded because I would like to
  use the sh*t out of that font. So my selfishness is in a way a shameless selfpromotion.\r\n\r\nAnyways,
  Mark Caneso from <a href=\"http://cargocollective.com/pstype\">p.s. type</a> is
  looking for backers to expand his Quatro typeface from 3 fonts to a full 16 fonts
  - 4 weights (with matching italics in each style) type family. In my opinion an
  interesting solution for financing a typeface.\r\n\r\nMore info about this project
  is over here at <a href=\"http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1436223656/quatro-typeface-a-16-font-opentype-family\">kickstarter</a>.\r\n\r\nIt
  would be awesome if more people could back this up.\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\nEike"

    pictures of kittens and puppy dogs.\r\n\r\n**\r\n\r\n$125 is a good deal for a
    16-font family + specimen.\r\nThe only downside is you have to wait for the typeface
    to be completed.\r\nHow long will that be? \r\n\r\n$13,000 is a good development
    budget for a retail type product\u2014there is no knowing how long it would take
    to recoup that from normal sales."

  body: Oh yeah, price-wise it's a good deal. Regarding your question, I'll ask Mark
    if he can answer that.

    development of the sans is farther along then the slab so backers who only want
    those styles could get them sooner then those who are wanting the entire family. '
