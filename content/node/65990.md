  body: "It reminds me of Ray Larabie's [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/larabie/still-time/|Still
    Time]]. You might also check at Dafont.com for Brush and Comic styles. Also might
    be worth checking Comicraft's collection, as this sort of dramatic lettering is
    sometimes seen in comic books.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
