  looks like Billabong [img:sites/default/files/old-images/BillabongAsInstagram_5958.gif]
  http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/typeassociates/billabong/ and the lettering of the
  reworked logo [img:sites/default/files/old-images/InstagramLogoRemakeByMackeySaturdayA_4444.jpg]
  which was created by Mackey Saturday, is apparently a smoothed out revision rather
  than a different font.  http://taufanwords.wordpress.com/2013/08/31/the-fonts/\r\nI
  would be interested in opinions as to which digital font is closest to the new logo.\r\nThanks.\r\nDon"

    one wonder about the legitimacy of the other designs too."

  body: "Edited:\r\nMany thanks to both of you for the font suggestions. Quite helpful.\r\nRyuk,
    your critique is perceptive Gives me a better insight into the merits, or perhaps
    demerits, of the redesign. I agree a cursive style  _s_ works better when it is
    allowed to punch above the X-height. The cursive letter _r_ is always a problem.
    Handling the _gr_ link is particularly difficult. Should the tail of _g_ snake
    up to follow the pattern of letters like _a_ and _e_, compare to Aaron Script
    by Seniors [img:sites/default/files/old-images/AaronScriptAsInstagramSM_4703.jpg]
    or should it stay below the baseline and allow a break in the cursive structure.
    I wonder if that would have been a better version for _Instagram_? compare to
    Shintia Script by Seniors\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/ShintiaScriptAsInstagramSM_6139.jpg]\r\nRiccardo,
    indeed Authentica is close to clonesville -- \"legitimacy\" in the font business
    is often an oxymoron that matches \"jumbo shrimp.\" :) \r\nJust for ease of future

  body: "About the Instagram reworking, I understand the need to smooth the logo down
    and to make it more a logo and less a word set in a nice font. But I think the
    result took away too much of the liveliness from the original. In this regard,
    for the g_r pair probably a more \u201Ctwisted\u201D curve would have helped (less
    tame loop for |g|, less wide counter for |r|, a bit like your Fertigo Script sample*).\r\nAs
    for Authentica, it\u2019s not the first time someone is called out for ripping
    off Wisdom Script (see http://typophile.com/node/93171).\r\nIf you need to \u201Cimprove\u201D
    upon an existing script, at least do it with something which allows it (example:
    https://www.behance.net/gallery/Blenda-Script-Free-Font/13832171).\r\n\r\n* Although
    in Fertigo |g|\u2019s loop could look a bit cramped, and the joining a bit thin."

  body: "Good point: liveliness vs. regularity in script font design. This seems to
    me to be perhaps the most difficult issue for a script font maker. The new _Instagram_
    logo does indeed seem to emphasize regularity at the expense of liveliness.\r\nBlenda
    Script as a remake of Lobster -- one of the most successful font designs of recent
    years -- is not close to _Instagram_ because it is too crisp and regular for a
    match. Is it an improvement? Perhaps. In any case, It looks like a good font for
    some uses.\r\nThanks for the comment on the _gr_ pair issue.\r\nDon"

  body: "Sorry to somewhat hijacking the thread, my links were intended to illustrated
    points only tangential to the main topic.\r\nOn the question on which digital
    font is close to the revised Instagram logo, I\u2019d say that the closer general
    style is the modulated-but-not-too-contrasted upright brushy cursive favoured
    by vintage advertising, sign painters and phototype.\r\nSome examples:\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/typesetit/style-script/\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/sideshow/impala-script/\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/bomparte/retroscript-bf/\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/underware/liza/\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/suitcase/bistro-script/\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/mika-melvas/alina/\r\n\r\nA

  body: "My 2 cent... I'm not great fan of this rework. It gives the impression of
    exactly what it is, a rework. /m and /n look out of the scope now, still too close
    of Billabong's, /n and /s feel unbalanced together (don't like the way /s x-height
    has been reduced to be aligned with the rest), /g loop and following /r look weird
    creating a big gap probably because the designer wanted to keep the tracking (making
    /g leg longer and reworking loop).\r\nThat said you may like to have a look to
    [[http://creativemarket.com/Seniors|Seniors]] and [[http://creativemarket.com/artimasa|Artimasa]]
    fonts, 2 fresh and new foundries."
