    thread but I just wanted to say it was great getting meet all of you. Tamye Riggs
    and her crew really did a great job.  <BR> <BR>Stealing Joe&#39;s format: <BR>The
    funniest thing at TypeCon:  <BR>John Downer&#39;s strip tease at the auction.
    <BR> <BR>The most frustrating moments:  <BR>Not being able to go to all the really
    great workshops offered. <BR> <BR>The most unbelievable moments:  <BR>Every once
    in awhile I would step back and realise that Ken Barber of House was teaching
    me how to draw letters, or that I was having dinner with Akira Kobayashi of Linotype
    and it was hard to believe. I thank TypeCon/SoTA for bringing together people
    who may not have otherwise meet. <BR> <BR>The second worst moment:  <BR>Finding
    out Josh Darden couldn&#39;t make it. <BR> <BR>The worst moment:  <BR>Joe--I had
    the same problem with the business center. I tried to go across the skyway and
    poach a computer at the Marriot, but theirs were heavily guarded. <BR> <BR>Biggest
    regret:  <BR>No regrets. <BR> <BR>The simplest pleasure:  <BR>Those beds. <BR>
    <BR>Funnest time:  <BR>All the planed and unplanned evening events. It&#39;s really
    great to get to talk &#40;in person&#41; to like minded typo folk. <BR> <BR>I&#39;m
    already looking forward to the Bay Area. The west coast crew really has their
    work cut out for them.  <BR> <BR>Sustain SoTA: Join SoTA as a member now!'

    &#40;Why don&#39;t camera reviews make a bigger deal of this? Sigh...&#41; Even
    when set to manual everything I feel I&#39;m making a request for a picture to
    be taken, not taking the picture myself. It turns photography into something akin
    to video: you press the button with the hope that the desired shot is imminent,
    and shooting tons of footage you use your &#34;creativity&#34; in the editing
    process. The difference between film &amp; digital stills may only be 0.2s or
    so &#40;~0.1s vs. ~0.25s&#41;, but psychologically that&#39;s huge. To capture
    moments, stick with SLR.'

  body: '&#62; In fact 0.1 seconds is the approximate fastest human finger reaction
    time. <BR> <BR>The relevant physiological constraint is not reaction time, but
    with what precision can one operate a trusted piece of machinery. From experiments
    &#40;aged 11&#41; I know I can stop a stopwatch within 0.02s of the full second
    quite reliably. A photographer sees moments coming, and can adjust for a 0.1s
    delay in a mechanism to an accuracy better than 0.1s. But with longer delays,
    there will be a rapid fall-off of such accuracy. The probability that you can
    predict what&#39;s going to happen 0.1s from now in a complex environment, is
    much higher than for 0.3s hence. This is armchair musing, of course. We should
    both ask good photographers whether they agree... But I liked a story I heard
    from a friend who once found himself at a party with Henri Cartier-Bresson. The
    great man would stand in a corner on his own, chain-smoking Gauloises and looking
    depressed. Every few minutes though, he would whip out his camera, click!, then
    hide it away again. Hardly anyone had noticed a thing. This seems to me to be
    the human equivalent of a frog catching a fly: a neuronally complex, supremely
    precise action, the perfect result of those minutes of observation. Any error
    in its timing - just by a tenth - would mean the prey would escape both frog and
    Frog. <BR> <BR>&#62; Or full-motion &#40;hi-res&#41; video and then select a frame?  :-/
