  body: "Well, the spelling is wrong: it's Bernhard MT Condensed. You are missing
    an \r\n\"H\" in there.\r\n\r\nIt was designed early in the 20th century by Lucian
    Bernhard, who did other typefaces such as Bernhard Modern, Bernhard Fashion, etc.\r\n\r\nWith
    the correct spelling you should be able to find more info.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\n\r\nT"
