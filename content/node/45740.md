  up with.  Good or bad, I'd like to hear your thoughts.  Oh, the logo is for a possible
  TV production company.\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/firecracka_ident_6183.png]"

    don''t make your design too phallic either (not that it is, but it''s easy enough
    to do)'

  body: "Out of these I like the very first one (1). It's simple, one color, and probably
    the most powerful, out of the shown ones. <em>(Version 3 and 4 just look a tad
    too 'clip arty', for me. There is too much happening. Perspectives, outline type,
    very small type.)</em>\r\n\r\nDav"

  body: I'd say first one, maybe with some correction on the dynamite thread (a little
    thicker?)

  body: "I agree on #1, it's the most professional and straightforward to me.\r\n\r\nThat
    said, I know video and web companies tend to prefer lots of color, 3D effects,
    etc because it looks \"cool\". I suspect they'll like #3 best, and animated it
    offers a lot of possibilities. I would definitely get rid of the clip art firecracker,
    though, it's very, very clip art in feel and design. For one thing, replace the
    fuse since the current tone looks like a piece of rope from Home Depot (I'm guessing
    it was done by someone who'd never seen a fuse before), and light it."

  body: "well, with #1 you'd have to use that entire thing\r\n\r\nif you use #3 or
    #4 you could always use the dynamite alone as a logo for smaller applications
    where the entire logotype isn't needed, solution #1 doesn't allow for that."

    the bakground, besides, it will work great in two colors.\r\nI've to disagree
    with innovati, 'cause you can always use the I with the thread for small applications
    of the logo.\r\n"

  body: "with a TV production Company, I guess you'd get to add some animation?\r\n\r\n#
    3 and 4  work well together for that, I think. \r\n\r\n#3 animated ... fuse burns
    down / dynamite blows up - letters all over the place /  next screen in the credits,
    or what ever. \r\n\r\n#4 as a static version.\r\n\r\n#1 is nice and professional
    looking, and that may be why there are so many logos like that out there (grungy
    painted-with-a-roller background)\r\n\r\n#2 this one feels too corporate for the
    spelling of \"Firecracka\" and the use of such an industrial strength stencil
    font. But, that said, it's just my two cents, #1 & #2 would also work together
    as dynamic and static versions of the same logo.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n-=\xAE=-"

  body: "Thanks for all the comments so far, it really makes contributing to these
    forums a joy, along with being a 2nd (3rd, 4th & 5th) opinion.  It also helps
    to arm me with professional opinions with respective clients, as I'm sure you're
    aware, a lot of the time they either don't have the taste to tell good from bad,
    or don't really know what they want!\r\n\r\nAnyway, I've got some more ideas to
    do, so thanks.  I'd just like to address a couple of points made;\r\n\r\ninnovati
    - I'll bear the 'phallic' angle in mind!\r\n\r\nFormlos - granted, the stick of
    dynamite does look clip-arty, but that was sort of the intent, and for the record,
    I constructed it from scratch in illustrator.\r\n\r\nTezzutezzu - I think you're
    right with the thickness of the thread - good call.\r\n\r\nnmerriam - you're right
    about the fuse, so a change of colour should help.  You're right I've never lit
    a fuse before let alone handle a stick of dynamite, so no surprise I got it wrong
    really.\r\n\r\nSo far, #1 seems to be favoured by most people here, and that has
    also found some favour with the client, so with your help I can now carry on.\r\n\r\nThanks
    so much to all.\r\n\r\npeace\r\n\r\nSimon."

    #4 reads FIREC-RAC-K\u2019A. Remove the white from between C and R and between
    C and K, and don't let the white descend so far down like between the last two
    letters."
