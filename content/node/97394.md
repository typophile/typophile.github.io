  Thanks in advance!"

    family. The Banner Ultra Italic cut comes reasonably close to the non-swash letters
    of your sample, but has a little less contrast.\r\n\r\nPS: Browsing through your
    past postings, I noticed that you regularly ask for Type IDs without bothering
    to give any feedback to those who reply. I think it would be nice if you would
    break that habit and let us know if our reactions were helpful."

    body: Thank you R. for identifying the font. It's always helpful if someone identifies
      a font. Don't know what else to say. I'm always thanking in advance because
      I very rarely login to typophile. Best regards.

  body: "Thanks for your reply! You\u2019re right that there\u2019s not that much
    left to say after someone has successfully and accurately identified a typeface.
    Still, many people (including me) appreciate a personal thank-you for their \u2018work\u2019.
    It\u2019s not strictly necessary, but it\u2019s a nice human touch, I think."

  body: "Is it really? In the preview on MyFonts, not one letter of <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/dstype/acta-poster/\">Acta
    Poster Swashes</a> matches the sample. I still think that it\u2019s a Publico
    spin-off."
