  a similar squished bowl. What's your opinion? (The image below was made in Photoshop

  about right).\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/arial.jpg]"

  body: 'Thanks, Eric! That does help, as does the link. I teach professional communication
    and document design, but from a rhetoric background, not a graphic design or typography
    background. I think I have a pretty decent eye and have worked hard to learn a
    lot. But it is very helpful to have some expert perspectives that can help back
    me up in telling students -- in precise terms -- why some typefaces are just nasty. '

  body: "Some major differenced explained here:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.ms-studio.com/articlesarialsid.html\r\n\r\nThe
    squished appearance most likely has to do with how it is hinted. Hinting is a
    process that adds instructions and other data to help render a font at low resolutions.
    Generally, the effect is to distort the shape of the letters to better fit the
    pixel grid, retaining enough of the shape to keep it recognizable (as an \"a\"
    in this case), but not necessarily accurately displaying the real shape, which
    isn't possible at low resolution anyway.\r\n\r\nFor what it's worth, Arial is
    probably one of the most intensively hinted fonts in existence. The problem is,
    the basic design (derived from Helvetica) is not well suited to on-screen display,
    especially at small sizes (also true of Helvetica, or any print-centric font).
    You can't say they haven't tried, though."

  body: "Photoshop's sharp/crisp/strong/smooth options ignore the font's hinting,
    being based on a \"plain\" rasterization of the font's outline.\r\nYou can see
    this by doing manual kerning, and watching how the vertical stem changes.\r\nThe
    \"none\" option shows the hinting.\r\nIn fact, Arial can probably get away with
    having a heavy central crossbar because it is so extensively hinted, and designed
    more for PC monitor display than being used in Photoshop.\r\n\r\nFaces which have
    a markedly thinner central crossbar to the \"e\" and \"a\", such as Gill Sans,
    fare better in the kind of test you're doing.\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Interesting. I've known about hinting, but hadn't considered it wrt to this
    issue. \r\n\r\nOne contrast, perhaps a false dichotomy, that comes up a lot in
    my field is something like \"artful vs. useful.\" I.e., the old form vs. function
    question, and it doesn't lead anywhere-- obviously you want both in some degree,
    depending on the situation. But as a matter of teaching students a professional
    practice, it can be a Sisyphian battle to get them to think outside the \"workhorse\"
    typefaces, like Arial and TNR, without getting all goofy with fonts (you know,
    \"but prof, I LIKE 12-point Comic Sans in my 2.25-in wide columns on my newsletter\").\r\n\r\nPlus
    even the experts in my field at times point out the \"servicability\" of super-common
    workhorse fonts-- citing, e.g., studies that show that compared to similar serifed
    fonts, TNR degrades the least through multiple generations of copies. And others
    think using utterly awful type is just \"fun.\" Grrr!\r\n\r\nAlthough, to be fair,
    these are very broad-brush generalizations. Part of the issue is simply that I
    happen to have an \"arty\" as well as \"spatioanalytical\" background, and many
    of my colleagues simply do not. I get into this stuff."
