    French Clarendon, created by William H. Page in 1865. Note the heavy bracketed
    serifs, which are about 1/4 to 1/3 the height of the letter. Various digital interpretations
    available, including MPI French Clarendon\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/mpressinteractive/mpi-french-clarendon/\r\nand

  body: "I agree Ryuk that Manicotti is probably the most suitable of the lot. It
    has a relatively open design that would facilitate a radial version. Would be
    interesting to see how it would look after the transformation.\r\nSince the poster
    is hand lettered there would have to be some major adjustments in addition to
    the radial transformation. Note for example the very extended bottom serif on
    the lhs of R.\r\nDon"
