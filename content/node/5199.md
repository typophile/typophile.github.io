body: Great forum! <BR> <BR>We are selecting fonts for an upcoming novel, St. CROIX.
  <BR> <BR>The book is an historical fiction set in the 18th century.  <a href="http://www.tomahpublishing.com"
  target="_blank">www.tomahpublishing.com</a> <BR> <BR>Have chosen Bickham for the
  prologue, first letter on new chapters, and historical quotes.  We like Bickham
  especially since he would have been contemporary for the time, and the protagonist
  has a vast personal library.  The author is even including a discussion among characters
  about Bickham&#39;s &#34;new&#34; broadsides from Bickham&#39;s &#34;The Universal
  Penman.&#34; <BR> <BR><a href="http://www.davidsongalleries.com/artists/bickham/bickham.html"
  target="_blank">www.davidsongalleries.com/artists/bickham/bickham.html</a> <BR>
  <BR>We are looking now for an appropriate book text font that will work with the
  Bickham embellishments. <BR> <BR>Thanks, <BR>Zoe

  body: Caslon Old Style 337 is a faithful rendering of the original metal face of
    the same name, which in turn was an early 20th century revival. I believe Mr.
    Giampa worked directly from the metal type. This is great if you are going to
    use letterpress printing &#40;a lot of letterpress printers like these because
    of this&#41;, but they will tend to look a little thin in offset printing. <BR>
    <BR>Adobe Caslon is a recent &#40;c. 1990&#41; revival of the original 18th century
    Caslon types done by Carol Twombly at Adobe. It&#39;s a very modern purely digital
    adaptation with a lot of corrections and smoothing out of the design while still
    capturing the flavor of the original. The overall feel is similar to Caslon Old
    Style, but without the quirks. <BR> <BR>Founder&#39;s Caslon is an facsimile reproduction
    by Justin Howe of Caslon&#39;s original types, warts and all. The most striking
    thing about this version is that, instead of doing one design that captures the
    general look of all the different sizes Caslon cut, there are many different fonts,
    each based on a particular size of the original Caslon. Using this, you could
    make a reasonable facsimile of the way metal type used to look, when every size
    was a separately cut font. <BR> <BR>Of these three, I would go with either Adobe
    Caslon or Founder&#39;s Caslon, depending on the look you&#39;re after. Founder&#39;s
    would be better if you need to use it in display sizes, not just text. <BR> <BR>Also,
    you might look at some of the suggestions we offered in a couple of threads earlier
    this month, <a href="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/37822.html?1086748247">one
    is here</a>, but I can&#39;t seem to find the other one. I&#39;ll post a link
    if I find it.

  body: If you&#39;re working in InDesign, you&#39;re in luck, because both Founder&#39;s
    and Adobe Caslon have Opentype versions. &#40;Mind you, if you want 337, you might
    contact Gerald about an OT version.&#41;

  body: OK, great.  Thanks for all the help. <BR> <BR>We have decided to go with Adobe
    Caslon with Bickham embellishments.  Accurate historical context and nice look.
    <BR> <BR>So how do I buy the opentype versions - do I just buy Adobe Caslon Pro?  I
    can work either on Mac or PC, I have both.  Have not yet purchased InDesign, was
    planning to check out the demos. <BR> <BR>Zoe.

    really funny, with uneven blotches of ink across the text.  Is this the way it
    will look? <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/38238.jpg"

    of what the text would look like if it were actually pressed and not digitally
    published? <BR> <BR>Zoe.

    printer to get a better idea what it will look like &#40;see the pdf near the
    bottom of the page <a href="http://www.adobe.com/type/browser/F/CASP/F_CASP-10005000.jhtml"

  body: If you really want the look to be old fashioned you should make sure to use
    old-style &#40;non-lining&#41; figs for the numbers and also you could try beginning
    each chapter, or section, with a phrase in small caps. Adobe Caslon has an expert
    collection.

  body: Adobe Caslon Pro includes all the expert characters in the main fonts. You
    need an OpenType aware application like InDesign or Illustrator CS to get to them
    &#40;I think&#41;.
