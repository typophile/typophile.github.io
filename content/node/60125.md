    (maybe 30 years ago), but is it not ironic when a posting headlined \u201CLoking
    [sic] for this font\u201D\_ends up asking for the identity of one of the most
    subtle and recherch\xE9 typefaces of the 20th century?\r\n\r\nBut it\u2019s good
    when an initiate seeks out the master, is it not?\r\n\r\n\u2014  \r\nJoe Clark\r\nhttp://joeclark.org/"

  body: "Calm down, Jad, I think you're seeing hostility from Joe where there was
    none. The point was merely (a) that there are sidebars and forum headings clearly
    pointing out that type ID queries should be asked in the, er, Type ID forum \u2013
    which the regulars here must get a bit frazzled by repeatedly having to point
    out to newbies \u2013 and (b) that your spelling was a bit slack (btw, looking
    at your profile page, I reckon \"Fance\" should have an \"r\" in it, too). No
    big deal. You got your answer, which was the main thing, surely?\r\n________________________________________________\r\nEver

  body: "You're right Dave. Just keep it easy, it's only a type question (most people
    don't care about type). I've seen now the dedicated place for those questions.
    So next time, I'll follow the right process (with the right title that sound a
    bit authoritarian but anyway).\r\n\r\nI also understand those type expert who
    answer the whole day to initiate and unread designer.  Could be annoying sometimes.\r\n\r\nThanks
    again for your prompt answer Joe.\r\n\r\nJad"
