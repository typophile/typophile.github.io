		<div class="commentbody">With the insanity of Bourbon Street just outside I think most folks were having a good time in the hotel. I tried drinking Sazeracs in three different bars, and the hotel bar made the best one by far. I turned Petra Weitz on to Negronis, she was trying to blame me for getting her drunk before the TypeQuiz.

I think the conference organizers did a terrific job, and from a content point of view, the best TypeCon I ever went to.

One of the more compelling presentations was done by three gentlemen from the Cherokee Nation, encouraging the type design community to develop more fonts with Cherokee language support.

No location for 2012 was announced. Too many organizational decisions yet to be made I would gather.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I second what James Montalbano said about the Cherokees. They so movingly explained how in their efforts to keep their language, reading and culture alive, having good typefaces, and aesthetically varied type designs are key to motivate people to read, and the preservation and development of culture. They said "What you do is precious, it is a valuable contribution to culture, thank you!"

Incredibly touching.

Sorry if it seems that we’re kept you in the dark … that was certainly not the intention. Like Si mentioned, we were posting updates and tidbits to the TypeCon site continuously during the conference.

Here are a few recent articles, mentions, and galleries to peruse.

Not yet, Craig.

We are still evaluating several locations for next year.</div>

There are a few more than one, but most of them are of poor technical quality and mostly represent a single style. One of the points made by the Cherokee speakers at TypeCon is that they are ready for more styles.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">It was an awesome conference. The mood was super, with content to match!

The Cherokee presentation also stood out for me. What struck me most
is what smooth operators they are (especially Joseph Erb) - they really
know how to work the ropes, getting Apple to fully support a script for
a population of less than 300,000! They're working so hard with so
much insight to plant hope where there is so little.

Another highlight for me was making new friends - usually I hang out with
the people I already know, but New Orleans has an infectious friendliness!
Oh, and the riverboat cruise at the end - talk about a smooth finish.

James, this is funny. I was sampling Sazeracs as well. I found a good one at the French 75 bar around the corner. I too was having a conversation about Sazeracs and Negronis with Jessica Hische. Actually, Petra was sitting next to me at the time, so the pressure must have been too much!</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Following James's advice, I tried ordering a Sazerac at the hotel bar – but it was the bar next to the pool, on the final morning, and the bartender there said that he didn't have what it took to make a Sazerac. So I missed out on that particular peak experience.

For what it's worth, I've finally posted a bit of reminiscence about TypeCon 2011: http://johndberry.com/blog/2011/07/20/typecon-surges-ahead/

I suspect that everyone who was there had to take a little while to decompress and recover before they could write it up.
