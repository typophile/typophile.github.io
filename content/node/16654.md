  design and practicing how to use the FontLab. I designed a typeface which I haven't
  named it yet but wish you all can give me a feedback of how I did. The type was
  drew with Sharpie fine marker. I wrote on regular paper and created in many strokes,
  I scanned the lettering and traced them from the Illustrator.\r\n\r\nThank you!\r\n\r\nWai

  body: "Wai Har,\r\nthe type you have drawn is dynamic, to say the least. It will
    find a purpose I am shure although I wouldn't know where to use it. It looks fun
    though. The basic lettershapes, the skeleton so to speak, look very familiar,
    although I cannot put my finger on it where I could know them from.\r\nA couple
    of things caught my eye:\r\n\u2013 I like the idiosyncrasy of th 'J'\r\n\u2013
    The 'N' looks very tight\r\n\u2013 The 'W' appears very wide and resisting the
    italic slant\r\n- The 'a' seems to move to the left whereas all (italic) shapes
    are leaning to the right, this might look bad when set in words.\r\n- The bowls
    of the 'g' and 'q' are different from, say, 'a' or 'p'\r\n\r\nI hope this doesn't
    put you of but helps you make your own decisions and create something that gets
    better & better.\r\n\r\n\r\nLook after Goodness & Truth \r\n& Beauty will look
    after itself"

      my instructor about my type design. Yes, I agree what you have said, I will
      make these changes accordingly.\r\n\r\nWai Har"

  body: What's the thought on the whisps coming off the sides at a slightly different
    angle? They look like they came from the sharpie as you moved from one character
    to another. They don't quite jive with the other parallel lines.

  body: "Wow, I like this one.\r\nThe main thing I would point is that you should
    try to (eventually) make multiple cuts of this design -with varying \"gap\" widths-
    for use at different sizes. This is because the gaps will either look too big
    when the font is used large or too small (to the point of clotting) when it's
    used small. The appropriate \"delicateness\" of features (in this case the gaps)
    depends very heavily on size.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "heya,\r\n\r\nThis is pretty nice.  I reminds me a lot of tailor's patterns,
    with its 'stitch' and 'markout' feel.\r\n\r\nlower-case 'a' seems a bit disconcerting
    though.  It look like it has been inverted on its axis, looks out of place in
    comparison to the rest of the glyphs. \r\n\r\nNice though - i like it. "
