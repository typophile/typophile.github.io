body: 'We have a new magazine on the drawingboard. It is called &#34;SITES&#34; and
  contains articles about all kinds of web related stuff. It also apeals to designers
  as it will showcase graphic creations. <BR> <BR>We are looking for a set of fonts
  that will provide a mixture of, contemporay design and that old newspaper feel.
  <BR> <BR>It is importen that the fonts does not provide that desingish feel that
  many magazines use &#40;eurostile etc.&#41;. But on the other hand, we want the
  sharp-seeing reader to discover that this is not just a &#34;boring computer magazine&#34;
  <BR> <BR>A few cluewords: <BR>Web, design, tecnical articles, showcase, comunity,
  essayes, contemporay and tight. <BR> <BR>At the moment the Rotis family has been
  talked about, both for the body and display text. But not all agrees on this choice.
  <BR> <BR>Please give us a pice of your mind on the topic... <BR> <BR>Thank you,
  in advance! <BR> <BR>Thomas <BR>/SITES <BR> <BR>Uploaded is a draft for the spread,
  which proberly  will be changed a bit...<img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/4100/69532.gif"
