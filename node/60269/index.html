		<div class="commentbody">Rather than stressing the "enjoy and experience" aspect, I think you should aim towards utility. I suspect the blind would prefer something that is quick and easy to use.

Also, define calendar. Today it can be a list of days, weeks, and months, or something that one puts appoints into (Outlook Calendar).

Might as well define blind as well, since there are the totally blind, and those who have limited vision, yet are legally blind.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Sorry, i figured it would be a braille calendar and you were just wanting to make it a bit more interesting.
With the new explanation i would try and find a method of representing the calendar which is primarily physical and move away from alll letterforms (both coventional and braille) completely.
How about starting by looking at aztec or egyptian systems, or by looking at planetary positions.

		<div class="commentbody">I watched my mother-in-law sign for many decades and ultimately had to teach our third child sign language as he did not speak until almost 4... nothing mind you except mama and dada and about 5 other words. 

Met a fellow (who was blind) when I was an art director, back in the early '90's, and we hit it off. My father was basically blind in one eye as a result of an eye injury in the war so I had a teeny bit of sensibilty about this dilemma. To this day my eyes are so empathetic that if some ones tears up I am a goner. After a couple of weeks of talk I asked my friend what he felt he missed in the seeing world. To my surprise he said "NOTHING." He loved textures, things he could feel, touch and smell. Well that was all I needed. I started bring him things that I found interesting to touch and smell. He said the nastiest thing was a wet spent Hibiscus blossom, the best smell was a Gardenia bloom and his girlfriends body was the best sensation in the world. 

Thanks for dredging up that friendship, he has since passed away.

Texture and odor might be the way to go. 

It's odd now that I have typed this I remember I did a cover and inside lettering for a book by Random House called "The Stinky Book." Loaded with scratch and sniff....... what fun : )

		<div class="commentbody">Thank u micheal for sharing your wonderful thoughts,.
Its amazing how blind enjoy their own world with their other senses.They probably dont know what they are missing..coz they are not aware of such things..

Many people feel sympathy for blind..but that attitute is very very wrong.Blind doesnt need any sympathy..all they need is education and inspiration to go forward in life.

Here I am designing a manual which will have guidelines as how a blind can visit a museum or any space for that matter.I hope il be able to finish it successfully!!</div>
