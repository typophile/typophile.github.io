    guess that Meta Design wouldn\u2019t use a standart typeface for a logotype. It\u2019s
    most probably custom."

  body: Stephen. I like linking to MyFonts. The site is faster and it displays fonts
    better and at recognizable sizes (compared to fontshop).

  body: "That's perfectly understandable to have preferences. Link to where you see
    fit. But please keep in mind that once a font has been identified and linked it's
    not necessary to link again. \r\n\r\nCan you explain what you mean by recognizable
    sizes? Are you referring to the samples at fontshop.de or fontshop.com? The new
    upgrade I mentioned will let German visitors set fontshop.com without being redirected."

    Yes.\r\n\r\nHehe. These are two different sites. Are you saying that the font
    sizes are \"unrecognizable\" at both sites? I'm having trouble understanding what
    you mean. Fonts at fontshop.com are displayed at 36 pt. by default and can be
    resized all the way up to 388pts."

    course, Stephen, I\u2019m refering to fontshop.de, BECAUSE I GET REDIRECTED EVERY
