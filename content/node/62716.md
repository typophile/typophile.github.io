  hit a wall when it comes to my personal logo. I designed this about two years ago
  in my last year of college. I've never really LOVED it.. but anything else I came
  up was never that good.. and I kind of just went with it. I've tried to alter a
  bit over the years.. but nothing has really changed my opinion of it.\r\n\r\nJust
  want everyone's two cents on it. \r\n\r\nI've attached two images, the first one
  is the original one made in school.\r\nThe second image is a slightly altered (angled)
  version of the logo that I use on my website.\r\n\r\nThanks!"

    (in the header) is a lot less confusing. Even so, it is hard to make out the K
    and the R, especially because the K is backwards. I only figured it out in the
    header because your name was listed, so I was able to make out the initials.\r\n\r\nI
    just don't see any connectivity between the design. Yes, it looks nice, but I
    think the reason it's confusing is because there's no sort of... unifying concept.
    For example, moving the line of the K to be in the same position as the line of
    the R just higher up (creating, in essence, a diagonal) may help unify the image
    slightly. Then again, that may be less readable. Also, I think the whole \"D\"
    part of the R is confusing, especially because you don't have a D in your initials
    (or at least aren't branding yourself with your middle initial, which could be
    a D I suppose).\r\n\r\nI'm sorry I don't have more solutions to this. My best
    advice would be to go to the drawing board, bring us some concept images, and
    then we'll take it from there. I'll mull over this and post back if I have any
    more ideas, though!\r\n\r\n-- David"

  body: "The latest post (5.Oct.2009 7.59pm) does look amateurish - I think because
    the shapes of the curves in the \"R\" are not very well refined. (weight and thickness
    of the R is uneven; terminals of the stroke/shape are not consistent).\r\n\r\nI
    couldn't see the version you posted that was from college - (first image in your
    original post) but the 2nd image in your original post was cleaner and had more
    \"edge\" than the latest curvy R version. This latest curvy one is a lot more
    feminine to me. I would try a different type face to perhaps make it more masculine.\r\n\r\nI
    know it is so hard to come up with a personal logo! I find it a lot harder to
    design something for myself than a client. Good luck!\r\n____________________________\r\nwww.coroflot.com/kate_dawson"

  body: "thanks kate. The \"R\" in the last post was made by me and scanned in. My
    illustrator techniques aren't the best.. so it looks a bit sloppy.\r\n\r\nI'm
    really selling myself :) ;)"

  body: "The second one reads \"kyle ichmond\"\r\n\r\nStep back and do some brainstorming
    sketching. Maybe don't focus on a monogram for now. Come up with some more abstract
    concepts. \r\n\r\n(I always hate to say 'monograms are overdone' when I, myself,
    use one for my business logo. That said, they do tend to be used a bit too often
    and sometimes are overly forced). "
