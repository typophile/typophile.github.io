  I don't like the extra zero in front of the 1, but it makes everything nicely aligned
  with the dash and the colon.\r\n\r\nAlso I Think the numbers are redundant so I
  made this one but kept the 1:00 to show when the event ends:\r\n\r\n11:00\r\n11:30\r\n12:00\u20131:00\r\n\r\nExept
  with a right alignment (html paragraph align is not working)\r\n\r\nor\r\n\r\n11:00\r\n11:30\r\n12:00\r\n\r\nwhich
  I think is ideal, but I have a feeling the client will want the redundant numbers
  to show when the event is over.\r\n\r\nThanks.\r\n\r\n"

    starts ... will the users know that?"

    space before and after the dash so the figure space between the dash and the 1
    doesnt look as awkward.\r\n\r\nThanks again"
