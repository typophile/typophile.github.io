  /img>\r\n\r\nSabon is a typeface designed by [[Jan Tschichold]] in 1967 for [[D.
  Stempel AG]]. The typeface was commissioned by a group of German printers, who wanted
  a good text face that would appear the same on all three metal type mechanisms used
  at the time (hand-set foundry type, the [[Linotype Machine]], and the [[Monotype
  Machine]]). Its design was based on [[Garamond]].\r\n\r\nSabon was later converted
  for use on photo-typesetting machines. Still later, it was made available in digital
  format. The digital Sabon is distributed by [[Linotype]].\r\n\r\nIn 2001\u20132002,
  [[Jean Fran\xE7ois Porchez]] revived and extended Sabon, creating the type family
  [[Sabon Next]]. Sabon Next is distributed by [[Linotype]], and is part of their
  [[Platinum Collection]].\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.linotype.com\">Linotype's website</a>
  includes an overview of all of the <a href=\"http://www.linotype.com/1436/sabon-family.html\">original
  Sabon font</a> weights, and all of the <a href=\"http://www.linotype.com/53159/sabonnext-family.html\">Sabon
  Next</a> weights as well."
