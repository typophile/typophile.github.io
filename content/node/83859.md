  body: I agree with the first part of the above comment. You really nailed it with
    this one. But "v" and "w" look a bit unnatural and distorted to me, as well as
    (partly) "x".

  body: "Lovely. Check out in small sizes if the spur on the f is big enough. The
    right one as in t is not really a stroke going through the stem, rather an \u203Aadd-on\u2039."

  body: "Thanks guys :-)\r\n\r\nThis shouldn't, and probably won't be used at text
    size. I should create the extrabold, using interpolation to check out the spurs
    on t f g.\r\n\r\nI can understand that w looks distorted, but nothing can be about
    it. What's wrong with v x?"

  body: Thanks Frode. I'm gonna have to disappoint yu on that one. It's gonna take
    sround a year before I finish the typefamily. Furthermore, there's a chance that
    I'll be selling it with an exclusive license for 1 to 5 years, meaning in the
    worst case, public release is due 6 years. In the mean time, I just keep working
    :-)

  body: v and w seem too narrow. This especially goes for v, which looks like a y
    with the tail cut off. I would make them wider, adjusting the weight of the stems.

  body: I really like it.. and only if made a hard effort to find some little details
    just to be sure that's the better option I could pay attention on /v/ and /w/
    looks them a very little bit slanted  to right, so the right outter space of /v/
    looks bigger than another gliph, but I could survive with that and I loved it
    anyway.. I would like to see the rest variant of this family I think could be
    so great and a really finest typeface.
