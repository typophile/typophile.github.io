  body: For those foundries that have taken the trouble to register a vendor ID &#40;for
    encoding in their TrueType and OpenType fonts&#41; I have addresses... <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/typography/links/vendorlist.aspx"

    <BR> <BR>Not easy to search though - sorry.  <BR> <BR>But there are a few in and
    around Chicago - Ascender Corp, Monotype Imaging&#39;s Fonts.com team, Berthold
    Types, t-26, Thirstype, probably others.  <BR> <BR>Si

  body: Thirstype actually moved to NYC last year, with chester at the helm. Thirsty,
    the design concern, remains in Chicago with Rick Valicenti and crew. There are
    a lot of type designers in surround states as well, or does it have to be Chicago-centric?

  body: no, not chicago-centric at all, i am just looking for a pretty thorough list
    of foundries and type designers from across the States so depending on where i
    happen to find myself next, it&#39;s always nice to be near type and type related
    activities if there are some in that area.

  body: Just a thought... <BR> <BR>It might be a good way to get Typester kick-started
    again. I think there&#39;s a fascinatingly useful resource sitting there just
    waiting for some more attention.

  body: hey guys, as i am fairly new to the boards i didnt know about Typester, but
    after the link was provided above, it&#39;s hard to forget. i agree with Grant
    that Typester is a highly useful tool which includes an intriguing and fun navigation
    system not too mention the amount of information one might find tucked away in
    there. from an &#34;outside looking in&#34; viewer, it&#39;s definitely worth
    continuing.

    working on the back-end tool which will allow much more user input from the community.
