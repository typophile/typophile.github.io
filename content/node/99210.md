body: In the early 1970s, in New York City, while I was running a tiny loft-based
  typesetting company called Intertypographics, I was friends with a black guy, probably
  gay but I don't know for sure, but geeky/nerdy for sure, in his 20s (which would
  make him 55 or 60 today), who loved type and typography. Not design or the mechanics
  of typesetting. Just type and typography. After all these years, I don't remember
  his name. It's probably more likely that I'd win the lottery, but could he be reading
  this message?

      details that might help. At the time I was probably working on gay newspaper
      project called <em>Gotham Ledger </em>or maybe a successor project called <em>Gaysweek.

    since there are sadly so few black people in typography (offhand I can only think
    of three) your chances are probably decent.\r\n\r\nGeorge, you could simply point
    your contact here and let him decide.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    check. If the names are a close match I would just have to give him a call and,
    as you say, point him to this forum.

    where white males were the minority. Where on earth are you getting your numbers
