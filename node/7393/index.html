Verdana was designed for screen use from the ground up. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->With regards to letter shapes, Arial's relatively closed counters for shapes like a, c, and e make those letters less distinctive than they could be at typical on-screen text sizes. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Try typing a sentence. Set it in 9 pt Arial and again right below in 9 pt Verdana. Copy those two lines, and do them in 10, 11 and 12 pt. View them on-screen at regular 100% zoom. Which text looks more readable to you across the range of sizes. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Note: If you have a Mac, also use 14 and 16 pt.

Like most American schoolchildren, I grew up thinking that America was the only &quot;free country&quot; in the whole world. Now, living in Europe, I realize how not true that is. Granted, the United States is older than every European democracy, except maybe Holland's, but the continent is now filled with free, &quot;democratic&quot; societies, which are all Republics too. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Hurray for Republics! <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Of course, in many ways, the United States is more of a &quot;democratic&quot; republic than most European examples. At least in the United States, we have a much more direct method of electing our chief executive. Compare Tuesday's election with how the UK and Germany (and even Canada) choose their Prime Ministers.</div>

England&hellip;did not even have universal white protestant male sufferage until at least 1848&hellip; <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->But just as England had a parliamentary system many years before it even came close to being a democracy, the US was still way off being a democracy for many years after the constitution was ratified in 1789. In 1789 only <!-- raw HTML omitted -->rich<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, white adult males got the vote. Women had to wait until 1920. African Americans had to wait until 1870, American citizens of Chinese ancestry had to wait until 1943 - even Native Americans had to wait until 1924. And in practice, for most non-white Americans, the Voting Rights Act of 1965 marked the advent of a near-democratic electoral system.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt;&gt;Well, in the US, we get to vote for both our local representatives in Congress AND for President (even if we elect him indirectly).  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->This happens in the UK too, but both things are combined into one election process. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt;In whatway does the electoral college promote democracy? <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt;I never said it did. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->OK, sorry. I misunderstood - when you said 'I'm for the electoral college' I couldn't think why anyone would be for the electoral college, and assumed there must be some argument that it promotes democracy. If it doesn't promote democracy what does it do? <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->================================== <!-- raw HTML omitted -->================================== <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->One thing that I keep hearing here at the moment is 'Why does the US make elections so complicated?' Not so much in terms of the electoral college, but more in terms of the voting arrangements, voting machines etc. No US state has a population more than half the size of Britain, yet here with turnout usually well over 70%, many areas having more than the usual 5 or 6 candidates, and a voting system that uses nothing more than paper and pencils, we get a fairly accurate count, returned by about 7am the morning after the election.</div>

That's at the heart of this farce. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The reasons for the Electoral College are obvious: <!-- raw HTML omitted -->1) Makes the election much easier to rig, like in 2000. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->2) Avoids the bad aftertaste of your president being elected by 1% of the popular vote. You get a nice big number as the difference. Sort of like points systems in arcade games. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Banana republic, except with imported bananas culled from de facto slave labor. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->hhp</div>

Unless of course it serves as an excuse to rape and pillage. Fits in the overall trend towards telling other people how to live their lives, like not be gay. Free, tolerant society my finial.
