body: "A colleague to me has another opinion than me about the amount of horizontal
  space before an ellipsis.\r\n\r\nMy opinion:\r\nIn my mind, an ellipsis can be used
  when a word is interrupted (a) - or when a sentence is interrupted (b):\r\n\r\n(a)
  \"What the f...\"\r\n(b) \"Well, I don't know ...\"\r\n\r\nI think it is logical
  to have no space in (a) and a space in (b). The logic being, that the first point
  of the ellipsis is placed precisely where the first left-out character should have
  been.\r\n\r\nMy colleagues opinion:\r\nIn example (b) she would reduce the horizontal
  space before the ellipsis, much as you would e.g. a semi-colon. \r\nHave you ever
  seen that done? To me, it makes it harder to distinguish between the a- and the
  b-type.\r\n"

  body: "I'm not sure about Denmark, but in the States & UK, there is no hard and
    fast rule. People have preferences, and often they are quite sure their preferences
    are the only correct useage.\r\n\r\nWith regard to ellipses generally, I know
    of three distinct styles in the States, AP (Associated Press), MLA (Modern Language
    Association), and Chicago (Chicago Manual of Style). All are different, and there
    are probably more.\r\n\r\nRemember too that the ellipsis as a character is fairly
    new, traditionally it is a sequence of periods. Periods always have sidebearings,
    so that space has to be considered as well. With the inclusion of an ellipsis
    \"character,\" I've noticed that the sidebearings of that character are frequently
    different than for the period itself.\r\n\r\nA story: We had a new customer --
    new to us -- who tried to tell us how to set ellipses as they preferred (\"preferred\"
    wasn't the term they used, but we're allowing for individual taste here). Their
    specification was in terms of a particular typesetting program, which wasn't one
    we happened to use. To pin down what they wanted, I made up a period with no sidebearings
    & wrote a little routine that let us set about 100 of them, with the space between
    the dots and the space outside the ellipsis varying, with about 10 unit increments
    (1000 unit em). We sent them a PDF & said \"pick one.\"\r\n\r\nI believe they
    got the point."

  body: "There\u2019s more complexity than you might guess, particularly when you
    combine the mark with end punctuation. Chicago governs most book publishing, and
    has consistently asked for equal spaces between all the dots and the characters
    they sit next to. If you vary much from this most editors will consider it a mistake,
    and they don\u2019t want to look foolish to their peers."
