body: "This is a scan (with contrast boosted and cleaned up) of three old juke box
  title strips.  These are just like those that the company my late father worked
  for, Servomation, used in their juke boxes in the Seattle area in the '60s through
  '80s.  I wonder if this typeface was exclusive to a smaller title strip company
  on the west coast, because strips with this font are quite hard to find on Ebay.
  \ It's very different from the cleaner and much more common Star Title Strip Company
  font.  \r\n\r\nIt's ALMOST identical to a font I found online called \"State Evidence
  AOE.\"  However, this juke box font has a \"B\" and a \"D\" that have the little
  \"overshoot\" at the top and bottom. (I don't know what that's called, but you see
  what I mean from the scan.  Oddly, the \"P\" does not have that.)  \r\n\r\nI boosted
  the contrast on the top strip too much... the actual print on paper looks more like
  the three middle lines.  I think I'm missing the letters F, J, K, Q, and Z. I have
  an apostrophe (on the word \"don't\" here), but no quotes or dashes.  \r\n\r\nThanks
  for any help anyone can give me!\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Jukebox

    like a teletype machine. [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/adobe/orator/|Orator]]
    type has similar half-serifs on the B and D, but G and W are not the same. I think
    it's effectively custom type, because it was designed for a printer, not a computer.\r\n\r\n-

  body: Yeah, that's kind of what I figured, Mike.  I suppose I could try to make
    my own font, if I can get the rest of the letters and punctuation I'm missing.  (Not
    that I really know how to do such a thing.)  Or I suppose I could purchase the
    "State Evidence" font and try to alter the "B" and the "D."  Anyway, thanks for
    the input.
