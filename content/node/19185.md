body: "hello\r\n\r\nim looking for a \"helveticaesque\" grotesque (no, not helvetica!).
  no frutiger, no myriad, rather along the lines of akkurat or akzidenz grotesk. any
  further ideas?\r\n\r\nit doesnt have to look very modern. monotype grotesque would
  be an option too, for example. it will be used in an art project about definitions,
  but its for a school application so i dont want to use helvetica (they could think
  that i havent thought about font-choice). oh, and it doesnt need to be perfect for
  setting long texts.. will mostly be used between 10-20pt on small pages anyway.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthanks!"

  body: If you're after something 'helveticesque', go for a neo-grotesque (usually
    monocular g)* as opposed to a 'benton-franklinesque(?!?)' old grotesque (usually
    binocular 'g')*. Someone please correct me if I'm wrong.

    too \"humanistic\" (right term?) like frutiger, rather something impersonal (but
    not constructed/geometric!), like helvetica.\r\n\r\nfranklin gothic is on my list,
    too."

    a personal project so investing in type (with my low budget at the moment) is
    quite a step.

    cash, I think you should just go with the one you actually LOVE rather than one
    that's appropriate to a certain project.\r\n\r\nI personally love FF Bau, DynaGrotesk
    and Maple! I'd have a hell of a hard time deciding between these four. :^D"
