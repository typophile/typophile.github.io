    specimen book from the era to verify which version/foundry."

  body: Yeah, I was suspecting a Century but it didn't look like any I could reference.

  body: "I'm pretty sure that this is not a bold version of Century Old Style - or
    the related Phemister Old Style.\r\n\r\nHowever, Cushing Old Style, also known
    as Lanston Monotype 25J, is a possibility. See [[http://typophile.com/node/48550|this
    thread]].\r\n\r\nAlso, in [[http://typophile.com/node/101262|this thread]], I
    discuss a similar-looking typeface, but without the descending J - and also with
    <em>very</em> short descenders, also from Lanston Monotype, 76J, also known as
    Modern Antique Condensed - also used in a Bible."
