  think it is the time for me to have a good handwrite and so. For two reasons, first...
  of course... a good handwrite by someone who loves typography, me! the second...
  it will help me since i love copperplate and canceleresc italics and so...\r\nSo...
  where should i start? What do you advise me?"
