    first glance, this is very nice and you are showing some good examples of your
    work.\r\nI also like the use of flash for your nav, not over the top just adding
    a little playfulness and movement.\r\n\r\n2 notes:\r\nI noticed a little mistake,
    the image (http://www.bloobseven.net/info/site_media/img/blue_dot.gif) on your
    Info page can't be found - resulting in ugly squares.\r\n\r\nAs you are already
    doing commercial work, why do you mention that you are a student? It sort of contradicts
    the initial statement on the same page (..Vienna based freelance graphic designer..)
    - I would drop the occupation bit all together. \r\n\r\nAll in all, i like ;)\r\n\r\nGr\xFC\xDFe
    aus Stockholm,\r\n\r\nSeb\r\n\r\nPS. Hast du einmal dar\xFCber nachgedacht deine
    Seite auch in Deutsch anzubieten? "
