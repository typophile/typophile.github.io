  body: Aaaaaah! <BR> <BR>And here I thought it was only the local shoppers / classified
    papers still actively using Hobo these days... and those ad placemats, too....
    Little League t-shirts... <BR> <BR>If it&#39;s good enough for the phone company,
    tho, well then by God...

  body: Note that this is the content listing for the <i>community</i> pages. That
    word community is surely the key to the choice of typeface. This is a perfect
    use of Hobo, a typeface that in my idiosyncratic classification scheme is categorised
    as <i>ersatz vernacular.</i>

  body: i also thought it was interesting that it <BR>was the community section. is
    hobo really <BR>the perfect font to bridge the gap between <BR>&#34;zip codes&#34;
    and &#34;elected officials&#34;? &#40;perhaps <BR>the name fits for elected officials.
    i&#39;ve <BR>never heard of a font called dirty crook, <BR>so...&#41; i&#39;m
    very curious about your reasoning.

  body: here are some more excerpts to study.  <BR>hobo appears to be the unifying
    element,  <BR>although used somewhat inconsistantly.  <BR>it&#39;s used for every
    tab, some subheads,  <BR>some headlines, etc.  <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/4782.gif"

    stop  <BR>disctributing this for about a decade. Then when they  <BR>re-release
    it it will be the hottest thing since, well, since  <BR>Beesknees!

  body: When I was gearing up to do &#34;Behind the Typeface,&#34; Hobo was originally
    the star, before Cooper Black stole the show. I was surprised to learn how old
    a typeface Hobo was. It&#39;s been completely disconnected from its Nouveau roots.
    It could be such a worthwhile face, if used better.

  body: 'i was surprised too. 1910. whoa. i was just a kid then. <BR>but aside from
    this being an obnoxious use of hobo <BR>&#40;redundant maybe, but...&#41;, i was
    curious about why <BR>the designer used it.  <BR> <BR>john hudson said: That word
    community is surely the <BR>key to the choice of typeface. This is a perfect use
    of Hobo <BR> <BR>but why? what kind of community can this be? <BR>not a pressing
    issue, i know, but it&#39;s something i&#39;m curious about. <BR>a &#34;psychology
    of type&#34; kind of thing.'

  body: <i>but why? what kind of community can this be? </i> <BR> <BR>I think it is
    the idea that &#39;community&#39; is something made <i>by</i> people, not for
    people by, say, government agencies. You want people to think that &#39;Parks
    and Recreation&#39; are something that belongs to them, rather than something
    that has been planned for them by a Park&#39;s Board and a civic bureaucracy.
    So you use a typeface that looks vernacular, like something someone might have
    written by hand on the side of a lemonade stand. So you think &#39;Ah, old fashioned
    lemonade&#39; not &#39;I wonder if those kids have a license to sell lemonade,
    and are they collecting sales tax?&#39;

  body: Behind the Typeface! I would be so excited... <BR> <BR>It&#39;s growing on
    me... at first I was thinking &#40;especially after the &#34;what kind of community
    can this be&#34; question&#41;, that maybe Hobo felt kind of patronizing...you
    know, too &#34;just folks...&#34; <BR> <BR>after all, the idea here isn&#39;t
    to sell something but to serve another function... but I must ask myself, even
    if that&#39;s so, does it have to be straight-laced and sans-serify boring? <BR>
    <BR>but, god help me, it&#39;s kind of growing on me... must-stop-looking-at-it...
    must... resist... don&#39;t want to go to work and scream  &#34;Hobo! Hobo for
    everything!&#34;

  body: Curse you Isaac, you&#39;ve blinded me. Since I first saw this thread I&#39;ve
    noticed &#40;1&#41; That &#40;wretched&#41; 70s Show uses some skewed form of
    Hobo in their credits &#40;<i>ersatz vernacular</i>?&#41;, and &#40;2&#41; my
    favorite used bookstore in Chicago, Myopic, has Hobo plastered all over their
    awning. Myopic, indeed.
