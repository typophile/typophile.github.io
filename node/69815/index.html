I am actually in a discussion about ebook devices with regard to their low resolution and my counterpart tells me, that I shall show him the book, that reaches a resolution of 2400 dpi. One of my arguments against ebook devices is their low resolution. I simply need more information about offset printing with regard to the resolution.</div>

I'm not sure, though, if this is done in practice (perhaps there are text-only companies that use low res as default). I doubt my trusted magnifying glass can tell the difference on text offset-printed at, say, 800 dpi and 2400 dpi.</div>

With regard to the direct comparison of printed text and ebook devices – what would you say, at which resolution could an ebook device beat a well made book, that is printed in a normal quality – I miss the right term, let’s call it a normal paperback, nothing exclusive and expensive. What resolution would an ebook device require, when it shall display body text in 8.5 points?

And can I buy printing examples with different resolutions up to 3600 dpi? I would like to check, if I am able to see the difference. More to the point, I would like to know the real resolution, that is required without castrating body text fonts like Sabon Next.</div>

Yes. And I can ask in German. I better can express in German, what I would like to know. But it seems to be, that I made a mistake, when I had claimed, that an ebook device has round about 8% of the resolution as a "normal" print. There was a person on a non-typophile forum, who said, we should be glad, when the problem of turning the pages of printed books will be solved (by replacing printed books with ebooks on ebook devices.)

The original German wording was: "Was soll am Seitenumblätterns bitte schön sein? Das hat doch eigentlich schon immer nur genervt.
Das sind doch nur romantische Klischees, die Nachteile gedruckter
Bücher werden völlig ausgeblendet: Man braucht beide Hände dafür,
wenn man das Buch loslässt, blättern die Seiten zurück oder es klappt
zu, es kriegt Eselsohren und der Rücken wird verknittert, wenn man es
zu weit umknickt. Wir sollten froh sein, wenn wir diese Probleme los sind."

(I just remember, that you are from Brazil.)

And that was too much ignorance for me. But I am amateur. It would be better if professional typographers and printers would comment those things. My argument was, that the most important and most comfortable thing is the legibility. If an ebook device is legible and comfortable as printed book with regard to the legibility, then we should be glad, if the printed book dies. What I want to say is, I am not against ebook devices because of pure ideological reasons.

Another argument from my side was, that we should not compare books, that are printed in the lowest quality, with ebook devices. So I need a standard for the comparison between ebook devices and printed books.

But I don’t want to start another thread about the future of the book.</div>

Anyway, I don't think you're wrong. 96dpi <strong>is</strong> 8% from 1200dpi –and there are many prints in this resolution. Maybe you can better say that e-devices had near 16% of average print resolution (comparing to 600dpi output). And even this is a <strong>long</strong> distance.

You are surely confusing dpi and lpi. 2400 dpi is quite normal for imagesetter rasterisation of text (even for straight-to-plate these days); 150 lpi (lines per inch) is quite common for halftone images, but stochastic screening is now pretty widespread.</div>

Of course, at 8% we would have a way to go yet.

Okay, a dot is not a dot. In case of inkjets I know, that the quality of the dots is very dependent from the paper. But that’s not all;  it’s also the way, in which the dots are set, which seems to be partly dependent from the printer driver.

With regard to electronic devices Thomas already said, that the antialiasing improves the legibility. But the extra dots (pixel in this case) are still pixel.

So I would like to know more generally, when a dot is a high quality dot? Is it the shape, the size, the regularity of the grid, in which the dots are set, or the reflection characteristics of the dots? Ten lined dots on a centimeter can be ten squares, that are all much smaller than a millimeter. The I have a dotted line. If they have a size of exactly one millimeter I have a line, that is not broken between the dots.

<cite>2400 dpi is a great resolution for an inkjet printer but, realistically, very few--if any--commercial offset printing presses print at a higher resolution that 200 dpi.</cite>

200 dpi? Did you forget a zero? I can hardly imagine, that this is true.

<cite>In the case of smallish text in high-quality printing, one
can certainly see the difference between 1200 and 2400.</cite>

One argument of my counterparts was, that the text in books is often set to small for old people. And my answer was, that it is not the point size only, that makes the text harder to read, but partly the downscaled font, that was designed for a bigger point size, and partly the low quality, in which the text is printed. I did say, that we need more font families with optical sizes, and more maintenance of our cultural achievements with regard to the apprenticeship of craftsmen. It is absurd to say, that a new technology is better than the old one, if the potential of the old technology is not tapped. If a person only knows wine, that costs one Dollar per bottle, he may come to the conclusion, that alcopops taste better than wine. And that is really a pity, because it is so unfair.

Someone did tell me with regard of my pro book arguments, that we also should not use modern cars anymore, but carriages. He did not understand, that the speed, in which you can read a book, is dependent from the legibility. So the ebook device of today is a carriage in the outfit of a modern car – in the comparison with a well printed book.</div>

As the car has evolved over time to be <em>more</em> than a <a href="http://www.google.com/images?q=horseless+carriage">horseless carriage</a>, you should expect ebooks to evolve in a similar way. For now, an ebook is simply "a book on screen" -- but take for example

Assuming some hints & just average anti-aliasing (aa), and to be safe, one would want a font where all the main stems have become 2-pixels-worth of the em. For most text faces that falls somewhere around 22-24 pixels per em. For 23 pixels to be 8.5 point you'd need 195 dpi.

Assuming no hints but scary-good aa, one can obviously get it to work at 135 or so, with user distance/size of screen — key.

I don’t think, that this is true, at least not on a TFT. Cleartype is sub-pixel rendering for example. There is one grid only. The sub-pixel R, G and B are on the same position and they are not smaller than a pixel. Sub-pixel rendering dupes a higher resolution only. It is an illusion. This can easily be seen on low resolution TFT. The illusion does work better, if the physical resolution of the TFT is higher.But just make a screenshot, if sub-pixel rendering is active, and zoom in.</div>

Yes, physically, they are exactly that. Physically, in a TFT, each pixel is made up of three distinct R/G/B elements (usually in that order), each of which is a third of a pixel wide. This is what subpixel rendering uses: Of course you can only edit full pixels, but when you make a pixel blue, then technically only the rightmost third of it is glowing. When you make it red, only the leftmost third. That's why subpixel rendering works. Obviously when you zoom in, your hardware stays the same, so you only see colors, not the active and inactive subpixels…

There's a bunch of material on it out there. You might start here: http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2009/11/02/the-ails-of-typographic-anti-aliasing/

Actually, from a typographic point of view, there are now three grids per size.

It's not entirely unlike a baseball manager saying he can use 22 one-legged players at once, within the rules, and get the same results as 11 two-legged players would deliver. ;)

There are three sub-pixels per pixel, and they are completely physically distinct, in different positions on the X-axis. Attached for instance is a microscope photo of a Dell TFT LCD screen.

[img:sites/default/files/old-images/397px-Dell_axim_LCD_under_microscope_6201.jpg]

<cite>Sub-pixel rendering dupes a higher resolution only. It is an illusion.</cite>

It's a weird process, but not exactly an illusion.

<cite>This can easily be seen on low resolution TFT. The illusion does work better, if the physical resolution of the TFT is higher.But just make a screenshot, if sub-pixel rendering is active, and zoom in. </cite>

If the screen shot is viewed at the original resolution on a TFT (or any other kind of LCD), then turning on/off a sub-pixel "works" and produce something reasonably convincing to most viewers. Of course, if one views it at any other resolution, then of course that breaks the effect, because instead of turning on/off a single sub-pixel, the same sub-pixel is affected on several contiguous pixels, affecting one out of three sub-pixels repeatedly, creating what is most definitely a single color.

The whole thing is only slightly more of an illusion than the LCD screen in the first place. We are already creating an "illusory" white by turning on three adjacent subpixels that are red, green and blue. A horizontal white line is simply a row of alternating red, green and blue subpixels. If we end that line a third of a pixel sooner, by not turning on that last blue subpixel, we still have a line ending in one subpixel of each color, so it looks white.

Depending on the details of how the subpixel rendering is done, the amount of space between x-direction features, the individual's sensitivity to it, and the resolution of the screen, one can sometimes see "color fringing" with sub-pixel rendering. But that doesn't mean that sub-pixel rendering is somehow illusory. At text sizes on screen, for most people viewing it, it is immensely beneficial the overwhelming majority of the time.

Of course, that is with pixels that were either black or white. With antialiasing, a lower resolution is tolerable. This is why you can see printed signs in a scene on a TV screen, and they look reasonable.

While printers might have difficulty in dealing with different shades of gray, displays are designed to do this.</div>

Aren’t laser printers electrostatic printers?

<cite>Of course, that is with pixels that were either black or white. With antialiasing, a lower resolution is tolerable.</cite>

The question, under which circumstances text is printed or displayed in a tolerable quality, is less important for me. When can an ebook device beat printed books? And I am not talking about books, that are printed in a low (but tolerable) quality. It would be the same as the following: First I don’t produce speed cars, that have combustion engine, anymore and then I compare cars, that have a combustion engine, with cars, that have an electro engine.

David Berlow already gave an answer. Nobody disagreed. You are the professionals, I never have seen a linotron. I have to trust in the experts, because I am far less experienced.

A laser printer does indeed use static electricity to hold toner on the selenium drum, which is then transferred to the paper. There was an older type of computer output device, typically <em>called</em> an "electrostatic printer", made by companies such as Varian which printed at a significantly lower resolution than laser printers, but higher than impact dot-matrix printers.</div>

As far as I am informed ebook devices with resolutions, about which David says, they could provide the same quality as printed books with regard to the felt resolution, are already available.

If I understand your question correctly, if there is enough device resolution, quality electronic publishing can be developed without extensive effort to overcome hinting and rendering issues.

Yes, sure. If the resolution of a display would be 1200 dpi, nobody had to care about hinting and subpixel-rendering anymore. If I have understood you correctly, the 135 dpi are enough only, if the rendering engine is well programmed (and if the hinting is very well made?). You know that better than me, how much effort the programming of the rendering engine and the hinting requires, when the resolution is 195 dpi. You are the professionals – inclusively the responsibility of education, for the case, that the ebook hype is more fascination for modern technology than a justified replacement of the old technologies with regard to the legibility. I hope you understand me correctly – typedesign and typography are your professions and therefore it would be a normal reaction from your side, if you raise an alarm, when the quality is in danger just because there can be made more money with a new technology for example.

As I already said, I don’t want to keep printed books, because I am nostalgic. I simply want to keep quality, especially with regard to the legibility, and I see, that quality often was immolated in the past for pure marketing reasons in case of other products.</div>

Correct, it doesn't. But, people who know what they are doing in screen fonts. as opposed to making something new out of nothing old,  do not 'count' on something in X they don't have in Y, or the reverse. So, 'typographically', the way I count resolution is to take the x resolution and the y resolution, throw away the highest value and use the lowest;).

Yes, and there is no accounting for taste, which sounds similar, but which is untrue, because it denies aesthetic principles. There is for example art, that is pure shit. It’s more than a question of taste. Yesterday I had talked with a woman, that only buys wine for two Euro per bottle, but invests 15.000 Euro in a conservatory (winter garden). Sorry, but legibility can only be evaluated, if the reader can compare. If he only knows books, that are not well printed, he concludes, that ebook devices are an improvement. Maybe they are or will be an improvement, but the minimum, that I expect is a fair comparison from competent people. People, that read telephone books only, are not competent.</div>

Agreed. And if one only knows poorly rendered text on desktop computers, badly printed books may be an improvement.

But relative to rendered text on desktop computers, most e-books are going to do just fine, I think.

		<div class="commentbody">Dots and pixels as noted are not the same in offset printing. A minimum 150 line screen can have positive and negative elements at the outer reaches of the tonal spectrum. Imagine how much pixel resolution it would take to make a consistently defined halftone dot at 3% of its fullest possible size within the 150 lpi grid. That is why they use imagesetters in the area of 3,000 dpi to resolve a 3% dot at 150 lpi.
Solid type has no halftone dots so there is much less resolution needed to get reasonable text print at book sizes. A 1200 lpi Linotronic will do.  When smaller sizes are needed, imagesetters at 2538 or higher are used.  Since photographs are most often printed with fine quality book text, the 2538 and above imagesetters are used anyway.  The main thing to realize is that dot printed on even a 2400 dpi laser is no where near as crisp as an imagesetter at the same setting. Inkjet is a whole other beast and they are not reliable for long runs.</div>

I'm not entirely convinced of that. Of course, they are much more portable, which is a great practical advantage, but not so much of an edge when one is actually reading. Some of them use e-ink tech, which has some advantages (readable in outdoor daylight, for instance). Some use LCDs, just smaller ones than desktop/laptop computers.

Aside from that, they have fewer total screen pixels and hence shorter line lengths of text. The resolution (dpi) is generally much higher, of course.

(Except for the iPad, which is weirdly low, with 1024x768 at 9.7" diagonal = 132 dpi, while current laptops often get to 120-125 dpi.)

There are only a few fonts with optical sizes in relation to the number of body text fonts without optical sizes. One third of them are news paper fonts. One fifth sans serifs. And the half of the rest is not well made. Garamond Premier Pro is a desaster. I would not want to have a license for free. Merlo and Stempel Garamond should have optical sizes. I am not contented with the way, in which Adobe has created optical sizes. In fact I don’t like the very most fonts released by Adobe. There are genius fonts of other foundries, but the very most of them have no optical sizes. And I think, it is a pure question of money. In my opinion there is absolute no need for more magazine fonts and sans serifs, but a big lack of well made fonts with serifs and optical sizes for books. Minuscule impressively shows that even optical sizes in steps of one point make sense.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">OK I haven't read the whole thread, but 300 dpi is generally fine for art for book printing. As long as you are using the scan at no more than 120%. For bitmap art, 1200 dpi is considered the norm. Again, no more than 120%.

I have no idea what resolution ebooks require but you might as well make your files with print-quality resolution. You can always make a pdf to the specifications of your clients. But you can't res something up.</div>
