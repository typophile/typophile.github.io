  search...\r\n\r\nThis old web page [[http://lmnop.blogs.com/lauren/2006/10/americas_most_f.html|(America's
  Most Fonted: The 7 Worst Fonts)]] is someone's personal rant on 'worst fonts', but
  the descriptions and thumbnail images are pretty damn funny.\r\n\r\nMy personal
  favorites:\r\n\r\n1. CURLZ MT: \"Curlz MT is not a font; it's a cry for help.\"
  + \"Common abusers: Middle-aged ex-cheerleaders trying to hold on to the magic\"
  + \"Probable famous user: Britney Spears.\"\r\n\r\n2. VIVALDI: \"Look!  It's like
  I really signed it!  Even though it's on a computer!\"\r\n\r\n3. KRISTIN ITC: \"ITC
  = I Teach Children\" + \"Don't you see how playful these letters look? You are talking
  to someone who is young inside!\""
