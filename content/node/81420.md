  Light exists anywhere? It needs to conform to either of the following criteria:\r\n1.
  Installable embedding allowed: fonts may be embedded in documents and permanently
  installed on the remote system.\r\n2. Editable embedding allowed: fonts may be embedded
  in documents, but must only be installed temporarily on the remote system.\r\n\r\nI
  really don't want to use Arial, although I might if I can find an embeddable version
  of Arial Light.\r\n\r\nCan anyone help here?\r\nThanks in advance\r\nSteve Brown"
