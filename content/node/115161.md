body: "The definition text is some small size of Times Roman, of course. Heading looks
  like Futura or some Futur-alike. What is the bold text font? Printed in 1967, composited
  by R.R. Donnelly in Chicago. This is Webster\u2019s Seventh New Collegiate dictionary,
  which I grew up with as a child.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/WebstersSeventh_6530.png]"

  body: "No, I looked at those. The lowercase a precludes most Clarendons. And I can\u2019t
    find any condensed Bookman.\r\n\r\nI\u2019m guessing it was composed on some kind
    of Monotype machine."
