body: "Hello Everyone!\r\n\r\nI'd like some help with typeface suggestions to accompany
  a corporate mark in a signature lockup. The mark should be able to stand on its
  own, as should the logotype\u2014depending on later applications. The accompanying
  image shows two possible explorations, among others (to show an aesthetic direction),
  yet to be further refined.\r\n\r\nThis is a start-up company called \"Pulse\"\u2014they're
  a logistics firm involved in international/global trade.\r\n\r\nWe're (with the
  client) leaning toward all caps, as I've found that upper and lower case with the
  letters \"Pu\" just makes for an awkward pairing. The more I look at various faces,
  the more confused I get. Should it be chunky like an Inserat, or elegantly rounded
  like Futura, squarish like a Eurostile, or condensed/compacted?\r\n\r\nMuch appreciated,\r\n\r\nAndrew\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/marks_5512.gif]"

  body: "I'd try to use a square typeface, and the width and finish of its strokes
    should be clearly related to the forms you use in the mark. This will give a family
    likeness to the mark and logotype and ensure that people recognise them as belonging
    to the same firm even when they're used separately.\r\n\r\nInstead of looking
    for a readymade typeface, you could draw those five letters yourself -- which
    would give you full control over their relationship to the logo and allow you
    to make sure that although being square and solid, they don't look too static
    -- after all, it's a firm that moves things around."

  body: Phillips points are good ones...I just have one other suggestion. You could
    hire a third party to make the cusom letters for you. That's one of thes services
    I and some others on the board provide. The great thing about custom lettering
    is that the clunkiness of the PU ( or other letter combos ) can be dealt with
    optimally.
