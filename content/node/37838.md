    not as good as Yojimbo, it's basically an enhanced Explorer. I have only used
    it years ago, it was fairly good, but I have no idea if it still is. But it's
    free, so that's not too bad. :)

  body: "I find it very helpful to partition hard drives, not merely into two or three,
    but really carve it up. This allows certain data types to be grouped easily, and
    you end up with multiple small directory trees, one on each partition, instead
    of one great big cumbersome tree on C drive. Much easier to navigate and find
    things, automated searching is quicker.\r\n\r\nFor example:\r\nC: Sys Vol (the
    OS and system apps only)\r\nD: Documents (.doc .pdf .rtf .qxd .pm6 .p65 .txt,
    email)\r\nE: Applications\r\nF: Admin (desktop, shortcut to IN drive, out folder,
    personal stuff, project folders, shortcuts to key utility proggies. This drive
    contains any data type)\r\nG: Work drive (.ai .avi .bmp .eps .indd .pcd .psd .psp
    .gif .jgp .png etc)\r\nH: HTTP 1 (saved webpages from the interwebs)\r\nI: IN
    drive (my in basket, accessed by shortcuts on F:)\r\nJ: Anime (a library of anime
    artwork I collect)\r\nK: D'Arts (artsy-fartsy artwork of all kinds for reference)\r\nM:
    Femmes (pictures of attractive women)\r\nN: Webdev (web-based work projects: .html
    .htm .php .css .txt)\r\nP: Pics (massive library of stock images, different from
    artsy-fartsy stock)\r\nT: Type (whole drive devoted to fonts and EULAs)\r\nS:
    Spare (large storage drive for dumping giant-sized files, software, DVD movies
    and the like)\r\n\r\nA place for everything and everything in its place. Having
    one drive devoted to fonts only makes finding a font manually quite easy, provided
    you create an extensive hierarchy of category folders. The IN drive has only a
    few folders, each assigned to whatever clients I'm working with at the moment.
    I used to have an OUT drive just for outgoing items but found an out folder on
    the admin drive more efficient :^)\r\n\r\nj a m e s"

    sucks.\r\n\r\npersonally, for organizing things on my own HardDrive, I think the
    solution is diligent folder heierarchies and a decent search tool. Windows doesn't
    have a decent search tool built in (and, in fact, I'm not finding Mac's 'spotlight'
    all that great either, though it is fast)"

  body: what i thought was really interesting about yojimbo is that it allows users
    to add tags to their files. i'll have to see if there's some kind of tagging functionality
    built into windows explorer. haven't looked into it yet...
