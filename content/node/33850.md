body: "Greetings!\r\n\r\nDid a search on this forum, and didn\u2019t find anything
  related, so hopefully this isn\u2019t a repeat question.\r\n\r\nI need to match
  the font used for branding on the Subaru.com site, please see the included example:\r\n\r\nThere
  seems to be a number of variations. Specifically, if there were leads to all, that
  would be ideal. \"IMPREZA\" seems to be different than the rest. Under it is  \"CAREER,
  FINANCES\", which is a little different than the lower portion, it is rather condensed,
  no serifs \"FULLY EQUIPPED. FULL ACCESSORIZED.\" Which, if you ask me, seems to
  be slightly more narrow than the most-right chunk of text \"HIGHLIGHTS\". Is it
  some family of styles? The other one with the grey links \"CURRENT SPECIAL...\"
  I don\u2019t particularly need, but appear like Interstate. Any ideas? thanks in
  advance folks.\r\n\r\nWes\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    Compressed).
