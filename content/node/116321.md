  body: The letters look like they are photographs of pipe cleaners bent into the
    shape of the letter.

  body: "I think it resembles a blend of two scripts: Monotype [[http://www.myfonts.com/search/monoline+script+mt/fonts/?refby=bowfin|Monoline
    Script]] and [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/brassfonts/fiona-script/?refby=bowfin|Fiona
    Script]] from Brassfonts. Notice the o and w loops and the r shape of the latter
    font. However the I is all wrong, as are the k and s shapes, but that's where
    Monoline Script comes in.\r\n\r\nThe shapes are not exact, but I could imagine
    this being a design compromise to make the embroidery lettering easier to read.\r\n\r\n-

    not \"photographs of pipe cleaners.\"  [img:sites/default/files/old-images/Ravi_Script_4371.jpg]
    For details see http://www.milligift.com/products/fonts.html\r\nStill searching
    for a digital version that you can use as a regular desktop or web font.\r\nDon"

  body: "I believe that Monoline Script -- already mentioned by Mike Yanega -- has
    the letter forms used as the basis for much of this script. Some letters such
    as _f_ look almost identical, others such as _A_ or _k_ have the same basic form
    but have been modified to make some of the strokes more flourished. The result
    seems less mechanical than Monoline Script, and perhaps has improved legibility
    when embroidered.\r\nDon"
