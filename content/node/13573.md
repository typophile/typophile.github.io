body: I was told that the company I work for had commissioned the typeface Barmeno,
  for use as its identity system. Recently while perusing the Typophile forums I discovered
  that Barmeno was expanded into FF Sari. Barmeno contains NO italics and is exactly
  the same typeface as FF Sari. Why is this? Does anyone know any more details about
  this? Yves maybe? I ask because I use Barmeno daily and have to manually italicize
  Barmeno in Quark to set type properly.

  body: Um...wow. Something I thought was a little issue has turned into a MAJOR issue.
    I have to say that I feel a little morally conflicted now. Reading that makes
    me understand the viewpoints of many of the members of Typophile. As I'm very
    new to the game my heart goes out to Nick curtis, Nick Shinn, Erik Spiekermann
    and many others who I'm sure this has happened to.

    templates to the trade? And I think he licensed his designs to other companies
    that built the equipment (eg Berthold) and later on digital versions to others?\r\n\r\nWell,
    it's late, so my thinking may be muddled..."
