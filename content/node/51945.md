  body: "A Pew research study has been released showing a media bias against Microsoft
    type. There were 65% more negative articles against Microsoft than competing font
    providers. The study also found that Apple's Chalkboard was unfairly escaping
    media scrutiny.\r\n\r\nDamn liberal, elitists media! They deliberately insulted
    Comic Sans here and are so in the tank for Adobe and Apple!"

    for the more famous Comic Sans all the time. If and when it's used, people just
    think, \"There's that Comic Sans again!\""
