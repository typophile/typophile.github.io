  your efforts. Thanks in advance.\r\n\r\n\r\nagain, the website is:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwww.vancity.com"

  body: "\"the rebranding of Vancity\"\r\n\r\nWhile it's a nice logo, I'm completely
    stumped as to how they came up with that website and 'rebranding'. I'm thinking
    'vancity'...must be a custom hot-rod or auto dealership. Oh, wait. Camping. Huh.
    Must be an outdoors retailer. Wait...mortgages? Is it a lending bank? Where ever
    I am they believe I can? What does that mean? \r\n\r\nOH! There it is...several
    pages into the site:\r\n\r\n\"Vancity is Canada's largest credit union.\"\r\n\r\nWhy
    didn't they say that on the home page!?\r\n\r\nI'm always perplexed as to what
    passes for 'branding' these days...\r\n"

  body: "Vancity is quite well known in western Canada as a financial institution,
    and the confusion you faced would not apply in the market they are catering to.
    I could take another brand and ask the same kind of questions: Coke ... is this
    a drug related product.\r\n\r\nIt is a feature of the Internet that both local
    and international causes and products are intermixed. I would agree with you if
    Vancity were trying to expand their market base geographically ... even in eastern
    Canada they are poorly known. But they will (I expect) be trying to build market
    share within their existing geographic area."
