body: "I need to convert Cronos Pro to a Windows Type 1 font. Cronos Pro is Post Script
  flavored OpenType. Type Tool won't open that. Transtype will, but it's $180, and
  I doubt I'll have further need of it. (It's not an impossible expense, it just seems
  wasteful.)\r\nAre there other resources for this sort of conversion? I don't see
  that Adobe (or anyone else) sells Cronos  in any other formats.\r\nWe're building
  an intranet system that's dynamically creating pdfs (using Cronos) from an ODBC
  database. I'm not sure what software our IT fellow is using, but the pdf creation
  component seems to be the part that really prefers Type 1 fonts. Currently it throws
  an error about a /BBOX, asks for Type 1, and then makes the pdf anyway, but the
  metrics are gone-- it' s tr  ul y    hor ri d.\r\n\r\nHelp at any point is appreciated."

  body: 'Isn''t Cronos an Adobe font? You mean FontShop will modify a font from another
    foundry for an end user? I know Adobe allows the end user to do  a "technical
    upgrade," but many foundries (including maybe FontFont?) seem to prohibit it.
    And do you check to make sure the person sending you the font to be converted
    has a valid license for it? '

  body: "While Stephen is partially correct there is a bit of a misunderstanding.
    FontShop is happy & willing to convert fonts from one format to another as long
    as the EULA permits it, or with the foundries direct permission. \r\n\r\nThe version
    of Cronos Pro carried by FontShop is from Monotype. Unfortunately MT (like many
    foundries) do not allow for any modifications or conversions to the font unless
    they make the customizations themselves. \r\n\r\nIf you have any other licensing/modification
    questions give FontShop a call (1-888-FF-FONTS) and we can help you out."
