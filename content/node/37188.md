  craft, the small discoveries, the satisfaction of making a layout work, finding
  the right typeface for the job, the history, the strict limitations of the 29 characters
  (I'm \xE5 n\xF8rwegi\xE6n), wanting to use a typeface for years and then suddely
  finding the right ocassion. Among other things."

  body: "I'm a bibliophile who dabbled in calligraphy and hand lettering for a while,
    and who subsequently worked in computer graphics for three years in the early
    eighties. During those years, I spent vast amounts of time editing bitmaps of
    Helvetica and Clarendon, simulating kerning (for a graphics display system that
    wasn't anywhere near true kerning), and reveling in the actual typeface choices
    that my office neighbors in the art department could select at will.\r\n\r\nI
    left the job when 3M bought out the company (I feared there was no stable future
    in computer graphics), but the experience of type design, umm, left an imprint
    on me."

    for beauty in glyphs or typefaces."

  body: I could never write very well. I always feel like I am wrestling with a pen.
    It is a dream come true to make things that look good to me, even if I had the
    help of the typeface designer.

    into shapes and space. And after reading about Jonathan Hoefler being color-blind
    it even makes more sense to me."
