    installed here. <BR>I think you should go with Georgia for everything. <BR>

    dynamically, with PHP using GD and freetype/t1lib&#41;.

  body: 'You are able to specify a range of fonts in decreasing order of preference
    in your stylesheet, so when you specify your font &#40;please forgive me I haven&#39;t
    tried to read your site&#39;s code or stylesheets&#41; you do something like:
    <BR> <BR>p { <BR>font-family: Bookman, Georgia, serif; <BR>font-size: 1em; <BR>line-height:
    1.35em; <BR>} <BR> <BR>In this example: everything inside a paragraph tag will
    be Bookman if available, Georgia if Bookman isn&#39;t, and whatever the browser
    understands is its default serif type if the first two aren&#39;t available. The
    text would be set at the browser&#39;s default size and the leading is 1.35 times
    the browsers default text size. <BR> <BR>Personally I would specify Georgia, serif
    for everything and leave it at that. I wouldn&#39;t get into automated graphics
    unless you have the technical chops and patience to do so &#40;though I know from
    experience that automated graphics can be very useful&#41;. <BR> <BR>One of the
    hardest lessons for me to learn is that typography on the web, even with powerful
    <a href="http://www.webstandards.org">web standards</a> such as CSS, is that it&#39;s
    a thing that&#39;s best controlled by making suggestions about what you prefer,
    rather than imposing your will.'

  body: Jon, thanks for your suggestions.  I&#39;m pretty familiar with CSS; the layout
    you see is pretty close to CSS 2.0 and XHTML strict validation.  It&#39;s also
    tableless, by the way.   <BR> <BR>The problem I have is that Georgia is the font
    used by just about everyone today.  There is no other font that works as well
    for screen display, which is why I use it for the body text.  But I&#39;m also
    attempting to create some sort of semi-unique look, and in my mind, Georgia is
    not the way to go with headings if that&#39;s my goal.  I liked the way Bookman
    is just slightly reminiscient of typewriters, and how it contrasts with the more
    flowing, elegant Georgia. <BR> <BR>But on the other hand &#40;and this is a powerful
    counter indeed&#41; i really don&#39;t know jack about typography.  Any other
    reasons besides cross-compatibility that you would recommend Georgia?

  body: If you fix the titling text into an image, you can&#39;t control its size
    depending on a user&#39;s display attributes. And if you have some sizable text
    below it, it could conceivable end up larger than the title! <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>

    follow with Georgia and serif of Georgia, Times, serif. <BR> <BR><i>The problem

    don&#39;t think that typographic branding or identity can be accomlished easily
    on the web without the use of graphics, Flash or SVG. <BR> <BR>Consistency and
    pleasant on-screen presentation <b>can</b> be achieved in your type and you can
    rely more on your colour scheme, page layout, and page title header for ID and
    brand distinction. <BR> <BR>If preserving Bookman is that important and you have
    about 10-20 titles to set each quarter, I think that it&#39;s reasonable to make
    title GIFs by hand. As long as you are aware of the threshold that Hrant has indicated
    and can live with that for an odd user or two. <BR> <BR>In a case like this, plan
    a single title block size  &#40;that maybe allows for two lines&#41; and build
    all your titles as layers in the same document over time. It will help speed you
    production and maintain consistency. <BR> <BR>I was just reviewing your site,
    and I like its look. It looks educated but friendly in a newspapery kind of way
    with the all cap titles. And in truth, using Georgia doesn&#39;t make me think
    I&#39;m at any other site than The Metatastic Whatnot. <BR> <BR>Jon &#40;the over-explainer&#41;'

  body: Thanks, Jon &#40;and others&#41;.  I appreciate the advice, and I&#39;m glad
    you like the site.  I&#39;ll really think about doing the image headers.  It would
    give me a bit more freedom, and I could even look at using a nicer font in that
    case. Based on the feel of the site, what would you recommend? Something like
    a Hoefler or Caslon, maybe?  Didot might also work well in all-caps, but I think
    it might be a little too cold. <BR> <BR>In fact, just after lurking on this site
    for a month or so, I&#39;m having to go back and reaccess many of my extant typographic
    images as just plain clumsy.  Thanks for multiplying my work.

  body: 'Daniel, just wanted to say stay away from Didones unless you&#39;re setting
    them at pretty large sizes. I have to contend with Bodoni Book as part of my <a
    href="http://www.vpl.ca">library&#39;s</a> CI. <BR> <BR>I&#39;ve found that I
    really can&#39;t go any smaller with the logo at this site without it looking
    blurry and nasty and illiciting strong negative comments from many quarters. So
    my experience is it&#39;s less about coldness than resolution of the fine serifs
    and radical think and thins at smaller sizes. <BR> <BR>BTW: If you stare at the
    line &#39;Vancouver Public Library&#39;, the words appear to grow in size with
    &#39;Library&#39; beginning to look positively large compared to the &#39;Van&#39;.

  body: As for the prevalence of Georgia on the web, I believe weblogs using Movable
    Type or Blogger as backend use Georgia in their default CSS stylesheets. So there&#39;s
    a good bit of it out there, but that doesn&#39;t necessarily make it bad.  <BR>
    <BR>IMO, having a well-designed page that mimics a printed page will look outstanding
    with Georgia as body text, certainly better than any other commonly-available
    Web font.
