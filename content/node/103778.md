body: "I came across this a few years ago in a museum exhibiting a few pages from
  a 1950s edition of Picasso's bullfight drawings. Being no fan of either Picasso
  or bullfighting, the thing I found most interesting about this was the titling face
  used on the front page, particularly its <code>U</code>, which has its \xBBstraight\xAB
  top part and its curved bottom clearly separated, and this separation empasised
  by serif-like hook-ish embellishments on both sides.\r\n\r\nThe guards interfered
  my trying to take a picture of it, but I found this blurry one online, from someone
  selling their edition for \u20AC6000,-. \r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://images02.olx.es/ui/4/39/91/1348309572_436853891_2-La-tauromaquia-de-picasso-Malaga.jpg\">\r\nhttp://ciudadmalaga.olx.es/la-tauromaquia-de-picasso-iid-436853891\r\n\r\nWith
  some imagination, you may be able to see the hooks. If you can't, there's a poor
  man's (i.e. my) re-creation of it in the attachment.\r\n\r\nI'm not really looking
  for a digital equivalent of it; I'm rather interested in everything you may have
  to share about this face, and this particular style feature, about other faces that
  implement it, etc...\r\n\r\n"
