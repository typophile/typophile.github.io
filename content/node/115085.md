  body: "Might have used a base font and extensively modified it, or just done as
    lettering. Only the staff of Antonio Banderas would know for certain.\r\nAbout
    the only letters that seem to be relatively unchanged from standard fonts are
    S, T and I. They are reasonably consistent with Clarendon http://www.myfonts.com/search/clarendon/fonts/\r\nDon\r\n"

    the pseudo medieval letterforms. BTW, thanks for correcting my spelling of \"uncial,\"
    I have edited my second post.\r\n\r\nDon"

  body: "Just to help you along. The u and n are in a style called uncial -- from
    the latin word \u201Cuncus\u201D meansing hook-shaped like a beak or talon. Two
    fonts have very nice u and n shapes that could be adapted to your project. English

  body: You meant 'uncial' Don, didn't you? So, my previous comment was not so useless.
    Anyway, glad to have been of a little help Nathan :) Good luck with your client.
