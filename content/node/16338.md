  presentation last time,\r\nhttp://typophile.com/node/15615\r\nand that finally my
  QM tutor liked it and asked me to give him a copy to show other tutors, I want your
  suggestions again because I will have to make another presentation for my English
  course project about banning smoking in public places. So can you suggest some fonts
  for this theme? One more thing, my English tutor is an Australian female. Thank
  you,\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\nTYPO\r\n\r\nP.S. I'm sorry if you are a smoker."

    \r\n\r\nBut to be really clever use the fonts and colors used by the best selling

      really such a Western place. But yes I also thought the colour red and white
      would be good for the theme. I wonder if I can use Eurostile instead of Nicotine.
