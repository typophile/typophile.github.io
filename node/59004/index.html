  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>This started out as a quick contribution to the [[http://typophile.com/battle36|Arial Type Battle]]. The typeface still shares the metrics of Helvetica and its impostor, and it is my first attempt at drawing a complete sans serif. That&rsquo;s a lot harder than drawing a serif, I think.</p>
<p><img src="/images/old-images/neutro_3995.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to release this typeface from its Arial/Helvetica metric imprisonment, and make a light, a bold and a black, and italics for the three lighter weights. Do you think it will be worth the effort? I&rsquo;m very unsure if Neutrogen is but an exercise, or if it deserves to be developed and used. Please tell me what you think.</p>

		<div class="commentbody">Hi Sindre :)
This is really cool. I like the DIN-like introduction of straight-sided rounds. I think you are right, this is crying out to be let out of the Arial/Helvetica cage. I find the widths, especially in the caps, a bit uneven. 
Are the corners and terminals bevelled? I wonder if small curves might be cool.
I think there&rsquo;s a tiny amount of optical correction needed on some of the curves e.g. o looks darker on the top left and bottom right because it&rsquo;s symmetrical.
I love the almost unnoticeable trapping on the M and N for example. M looks a bit narrow perhaps.
I&rsquo;d move the crossbar on e down slightly. a looks wide (as of course it would being based on the metrics of Arial). w could go wider.
Bowls on 6 and 9 could be larger. 
You would know much better than me but doesn&rsquo;t the ring on aring look a bit light and close to the base glyph?
I&rsquo;d put a slab on the bottom of £ to match the 7.</div>

You are absolutely right about the need for further optical correction, I&rsquo;ve been fumbling in the dark about that, having no theoretical background at all. Type design is an infinite rabbit hole. 
And yes, working on a set of given widths is a severe limitation. I&rsquo;ll rework every glyph. 
I agree on everything else you say, and will make corrections. Those Å and å-rings (and the ø-slashes) follow Helvetica&rsquo;s thinness and placement. I&rsquo;ll fix it.
Yes, every outer corner is bevelled. I&rsquo;ve been thinking about making curves instead, but given the small size (5x5 units), I&rsquo;m not sure if the difference will be noticable except in very large sizes. I&rsquo;ll give it a try, though.</div>

The biggest differences are the widths of a, f, s, t, w, eszett, A, B, D, E, F, M, P, R, S and W, while several other glyphs have had som minor optical adjustments. And the spacing and basic kerning is completely redone, though roughly. New pdf attached to first post.</p>

<p>I think you could extend the right side of t, both on the crossbar and the foot, similar to what Craig suggested for the f. But I like the angular terminal on top.</p>
<p>If the P gets narrower, consider doing the same for B, c, D, G and to a lesser extent R.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Thank you very much for your comments, everyone! 
Frode, I chose the serifed numeral 1 to make it fit better in tabular settings. I think it is quite common for the the base serif in sans serif 1s to be slightly thinner than the base horizontal stroke. However, I&rsquo;ve thickened and shortened it somewhat. The top is also altered. The 7 is stabilised. (Er litt agorafobisk for tida, sjukemeldt på grunn av ekstremt overarbeid og konstant migrene, så jeg er litt ute av drift. Men når jeg friskner til, kan vi gjerne møtes.)</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve tried fixing the S (always a major headache), and worked out a better width relationship between B, C, D, G, O and P. I&rsquo;ve also extended the capital overshoot slightly. Question mark fixed, open-topped 4 made, f and t fortified, comma slightly altered. I think its form suits the angularity, but I&rsquo;ll try some other solutions.</p>
<p>Your input is invaluable, thanks again and keep them coming!</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Sindre, you&rsquo;re obviously playing a crowded field here, but I think this may well grow to be quite &ldquo;special&rdquo; enough to exist of its own right. I like how its &ldquo;angularity&rdquo; pulls it over a bit into the  direction of DIN. I think the character of the face still needs a bit of refining though; not all glyphs pull equally strongly into the &ldquo;new&rdquo; direction.</p>
<p>For one thing, the angularity is not treated alike in all letters. I agree with Craig that the &ldquo;S&rdquo; is too flat on top and on the bottom. Conversely, the question mark might be too round. The &ldquo;m&rdquo; seems more roundy than I&rsquo;d have expected, too; and maybe the &ldquo;n&rdquo;/&ldquo;h&rdquo;/&ldquo;u&rdquo; could also do with more &ldquo;tenseness&rdquo;? – also in terms of stroke modulation (that taper close to the joins looks a bit 1950s-grotesque-ish I think).</p>
<p>The other thing is that a few glyphs look closer to existing fonts than others (kinda hard to avoid I guess). &ldquo;g&rdquo; and &ldquo;t&rdquo; are somewhere between Arial and Univers; &ldquo;f&rdquo;, &ldquo;k&rdquo;/&ldquo;K&rdquo;, and &ldquo;R&rdquo; seem reminiscent of Helvetica. There might be room for different treatments… dunno, maybe a &ldquo;K&rdquo; with a horizontal crossbar could work? Or a differently-topped &ldquo;t&rdquo;, a wider &ldquo;f&rdquo;, …?</p>
<p>*</p>
<p>Details: I think &ldquo;t&rdquo; might need more of a foot to stand on. Maybe also consider making its stem [more] off-vertical.</p>
<p>&ldquo;z&rdquo; looks maybe a bit wide.</p>
<p>My biggest beef is the &ldquo;e&rdquo; – to my eye, its vertical proportions (and to a lesser degree, maybe also those of the &ldquo;G&rdquo;) are off. I&rsquo;d make the eye larger, but if you don&rsquo;t want to do that, I think you need to give it less of a &ldquo;jaw&rdquo; (i.e. close it less in the bottom-right) and fiddle with the curves; it just looks like the crossbar is too high. (It reminded me of that illustration that Frutiger did of the proportions of lettershapes vs. human faces, with the Mona Lisa – have you seen that? It&rsquo;s pretty funny.)
BTW, it might also be slightly wide.</p>
<p>Numerals: I like them! 
They look a bit more Franklin-Gothic-esque than the letters though. The bowls of &ldquo;6&rdquo;, &ldquo;8&rdquo;, &ldquo;9&rdquo; are surprisingly un-square. And hmm, with a &ldquo;4&rdquo;, a &ldquo;6&rdquo; and a &ldquo;9&rdquo; like that, I think I&rsquo;d expect a &ldquo;R&rdquo; with a straight leg. But maybe that&rsquo;s just me.
I think &ldquo;3&rdquo; is too heavy in the bottom-left. The zero might be a bit <em>too</em> square, dunno.</p>
<p>BTW, I dig the name, except that it keeps reminding me of hand cream. ;)</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll be curious to see where this goes – it&rsquo;s interesting!</p>

Ben, thanks for posting the link to that Mark Jamra article! That&rsquo;s interesting stuff.</p>

		<div class="commentbody">Those cap proportions look pretty good to me.
S still looks to &ldquo;Eurostile-y&rdquo; for this font to me. 
6 (and presumably still 9) are too abrupt going from curve to straight I think.
Relationship of the question mark stroke and its dot is weird - align them better, and maybe the stroke can thicken at the bottom so the difference in width isn&rsquo;t so distinct?
Relationship of inner and outer contours needs refining in some curves - for example, southeast corner of D and B looks pinched.
The open-topped four looks a little narrow.

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Hi, Nina, and thanks a bunch for your thorough critique. Very much appreciated, and very, very helpful.</p>
<p>Yes, I know there are already too many clean grotesques in the world, I guess I yet again have to hide behind the I&rsquo;m-just-a-beginner-trying-to-learn-the-craft-moniker. Then again, my goal with this typeface is, if anything, to rid a grotesque of much of its grotesqueness, and use geometric solutions instead. I&rsquo;m not so sure that I will succeed in this, but with all the great help I&rsquo;m getting here on Typophile, it might just happen.</p>
<p><img src="/images/old-images/neutro4_6261.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve tried to make the glyphs more uniform, and have spent most of my free time since my last post fiddling with the curves of mnhu. It looks better now, I think, but I&rsquo;m uncertain if it&rsquo;s good enough. Thanks for spotting the problem, those curves are probably the most defining of the lower case, I think.</p>
<p>New S made, question mark fixed, f, t, y and j altered, e fixed, c, a, s and z is also tweaked.</p>
<p>B, C, D, G, H (wider) and Q are also tweaked, most of them following suggestions. Do you think I&rsquo;m closer to solving the optical problems now, Craig?</p>
<p>Nina, I tried several other K&rsquo;s and k&rsquo;s, but I just can&rsquo;t make them work. I don&rsquo;t really like the style of the R, but since a straight legged version is the obvious route to follow, I&rsquo;ve decided to stick with the unpopular solution. At least, it hasn&rsquo;t got that weird semi-serif of Helcetica.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d really like to see that Frutiger on Mona Lisa and type proportions you mentioned. Which book should I be looking for? Or is it online somewhere? I think my e is much better now, by the way, thanks for pointing it out.</p>
<p>The numerals: I tried to make a softer transition into the straight line of 6 and 9, but wound up with a <em>very</em> subtle difference. What do you think? I&rsquo;ve softened the zero, but kept the roundness of 6, 8, 9. I&rsquo;ll try squaring them later. The 4 is extended, thanks, Craig.</p>
<p>New pdf attached.</p>
<p>I swear I&rsquo;d never heard of the Neutrogena cosmetic products before today, I don&rsquo;t think they&rsquo;re sold here. And I thought I was somewhat clever with that name &hellip;</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Sindre, I&rsquo;m glad if my input helps; to be honest, I&rsquo;m probably learning just as much doing this as you are :-). I&rsquo;m happy you know that I&rsquo;m not all that &ldquo;advanced&rdquo; yet, either!</p>
<p>That said, to my eyes most of the stuff you did is totally spot on. The &ldquo;e&rdquo; feels <em>much</em> better now, as well as the &ldquo;n&rdquo; &amp; Co. Nice!</p>
<p>&ldquo;S&rdquo; looks a LOT better (how fast can you make &ldquo;S&quot;s?! I&rsquo;m envious). You might try pulling its belly in a bit though ;-) – I mean the bottom-right.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m still wondering about some of the proportions. The &ldquo;e&rdquo; still seems wide (especially next to that somewhat narrow &ldquo;d&rdquo;); actually, I&rsquo;m wondering if the &ldquo;o&rdquo; isn&rsquo;t also a bit wide compared to the bpdq? In the uppercase the CGOQ also look a <em>hint</em> wider to me than most other glyphs; but maybe that&rsquo;s just me.
In any case, the &ldquo;N&rdquo; needs to be (nominally) wider than the &ldquo;H&rdquo;. It&rsquo;s now actually a bit narrower. Also, &ldquo;F&rdquo; might be a bit narrow compared to &ldquo;E&rdquo;?</p>
<p>The &ldquo;Y&rdquo; is hot!</p>
<p>I wonder if the straights on &ldquo;6&rdquo; and &ldquo;9&rdquo; might be <em>too</em> straight. Especially on the &ldquo;6&rdquo; it almost looks like it&rsquo;s bending outwards. You might try just a hint of a curve?</p>
<p>BTW, I dig those chamfered corners. They make it just a hint soft on the page, which seems quite pleasant.</p>

I thought it was in the Frutiger monograph, but couldn&rsquo;t find it in there.

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Wow, thanks again, Nina. You already deserve a mention in the font info-section.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve had very little time for type drawing today, but I&rsquo;ve tinkered a bit with proportions, following your suggestions. It&rsquo;s incredible how easy it is to see your own faults when someone points them out. While I may be fast at drawing S&rsquo;es, you really have a tremendous eye for type, of which I&rsquo;m envious.</p>
<p><img src="/images/old-images/neutro5_5741.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve widened bdpq somewhat, made e slightly narrower, m a bit wider, s a little wider (with some additional tweaking), widened F quite a bit, tinkered a little with the S (it&rsquo;s a great trick turning difficult glyphs upside down, by the way, all bumps and faults suddenly stand out when you see it as an image instead of as a letter), narrowed the H considerably, widened the N just a hair, sliced a little off the X, and slimmed COGQ a tiny bit. To my eyes, the whole font looks much more harmonius and optically pleasing now, but I guess you&rsquo;ll find more faults. I hope you do!</p>
<p>Er, the numerals. I haven&rsquo;t had time to work on them today. I really think I want to redraw them from scratch, as I feel they don&rsquo;t really match the rest of the typeface. Perhaps I&rsquo;ll make them cap height instead, and draw some kerned hybrid numerals as an alternative.</p>
<p>Thanks a lot for the Mona Lisa distortions! That&rsquo;s so true! Still, the hard part is probably understanding the different relationship of proportions in different type styles. A Barocque e would look slightly retarded if one were to interpret the crossbar as the eyes of a human face.</p>
<p>It seems &ldquo;Neutrogena&rdquo; is actually a Swiss brand, its formula supposedly invented by a Belgian. I found several Norwegian pages where female bloggers lamented the products' non-presence here. Obviously a case of &ldquo;foreign branding&rdquo;, just like Häagen-Dazs, which name is supposed to look Scandinavian to American customers.</p>

<p>We wouldn&rsquo;t want that, would we? Actually, I fear it already does. But then again, it&rsquo;s been a great exercise and so far a pleasure drawing this, and I look forward to drawing additional weights. You&rsquo;ve helped me a lot in making this rather hygienic grotesque better. Thanks!</p>

<p>I think the refinements you&rsquo;re doing are working well.</p>
<p>Top terminal of G looks to me like it hangs over a bit much or far.</p>
<p>y gets thick at the intersection. K&rsquo;s arm may be a little too thin. Other than those, I&rsquo;m envious of your diagonal weights and vertices.</p>
<p>Take a look at the straight-into-curve of J. I think it has a similar problem that I was seeing in other curves: abrupt transitions and pinched strokes - maybe the inside curve needs to start higher? (If I myself knew more about curve drawing I could diagnose this more helpfully&hellip;)</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Argh, I completely fell for the Neutrogena thing! :-|  Sorry. Must be odd for you. 
I tend to get annoyed when stuff is branded Swiss and isn&rsquo;t really.</p>
<p>I think your refinements work quite well. Not too much time for details right now; but I&rsquo;d agree with Craig that the &ldquo;J&rdquo; needs some fiddlin'. Also the &ldquo;e&rdquo; still looks a bit wide to my eye (try setting the word &ldquo;the&rdquo;), and so does the &ldquo;G&rdquo; actually (and I agree about not making the top hang down so far).
I&rsquo;m not sure &ldquo;H&rdquo; isn&rsquo;t too narrow now – just if you (very slightly) widen it, make sure you take the &ldquo;N&rdquo; along.</p>
<p>Mona Lisa: I think it&rsquo;s less about &ldquo;absolute&rdquo; proportions (in terms of the eyes corresponding to the crossbar of &ldquo;e&rdquo;, etc.) and more about appearing well-balanced, not stretched or squooshed, which also depends greatly on the visual balance / coherence of the entire glyph, and its historical model / structural context, as you say – just like two human faces from different cultural backgrounds can look very beautiful with very different proportions. 
Otherwise a Venetian &ldquo;e&rdquo; (with the angled bar) would be pretty scary :-&gt;</p>
<p>BTW, please don&rsquo;t pick me out for the credits – why not put Typophile as a whole in? We&rsquo;re all contributing, and this environment is helping us all I think.</p>

<p>Now the numerals need some attention, I think. Then I guess it&rsquo;s time for some text settings and print-outs, as this typeface hasn&rsquo;t left my laptop yet. I guess I&rsquo;m in for some surprises (and more work).</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>looking great, but here&rsquo;s some feedback from a prospective user.</p>
<p>AFAIK this face started life as an arial improvement/redesign and, from my point of view, that&rsquo;s where the value of this face lies.</p>
<p>i, like many other millions of people around the world, am forced to both read and spec arial almost every day of my life. i would love to have a redesign that i could safely substitute for arial, with the same basic charset and without risk of document reflow. seeing neurogena in place of arial every day would improve my quality of life. that, to me, would be worth more than another neo-grot, however well-designed, in an already-crowded market.</p>
<p>of course, i&rsquo;m talking about compromising a typeface you may feel has entirely transcended arial and acquired characteristics and an independence all of its own. so here&rsquo;s a suggestion. the main version would be spaced and kerned with complete freedom. but alongside it could be a retrograde &lsquo;arial-compatible&rsquo; version could adopt the arial metrics so it could be substituted in the way i describe.</p>
<p>what do you think?</p>
<p>in any case, i&rsquo;ve anjoyed seeing this design evolve.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>No, I haven&rsquo;t given up on this. I just needed a little time off from it. (And I&rsquo;ve made yet another half-finished serif in the meantime). See the enclosed pdf for a <I>major</I> update. Everything is redrawn at least twice since then, and as you can see from the enclosed pdf specimen, the typeface has grown considerably in several directions. It was obvious (see above) that the typeface needed a new name. What do you think of my new suggestion?</p>
<p>Geraint, thanks for your post. I didn&rsquo;t see it till now. I&rsquo;m afraid this typeface no longer has much to do with Arial or it&rsquo;s metrics. Your idea about a Arial/Helvetica-compatible version is indeed interesting. I&rsquo;ll think seriously about it when everything is more finished. And thanks a lot for your kind words!</p>

Yes, your description is spot on. In really haven&rsquo;t looked at Univers at all when drawing this, though my goals with this typeface are probably rather similar to Adrian Frutiger&rsquo;s when he drew Univers. My typeface is squarer, narrower, tighter (but nowhere near Helvetica&rsquo;s tightness) and darker than Univers, and I think it&rsquo;s more the overall impression than the actual letter-shapes that makes them similar. 
I&rsquo;m looking forward to your critique. Please don&rsquo;t be nice.</div>

Ok, I&rsquo;ll take a break from chunking up Eternal roman into a text face and give your glyphs some attention&hellip;
As I said before, this is looking <em>very</em> polished and useable, so I&rsquo;ll have to go into super picky-pokey mode to give a decent crit&hellip;remember I&rsquo;m a type novice too so have salt at the ready.
My favourite feature of this is the structure of the bowl and stick glyphs, which seem to have perfect rigour at a perfect midpoint between the grotesques and moderns. There&rsquo;s also a few hints of geometrics (ampersand, percentage and numerals) and humanists (J,K perhaps).</p>
<p>OK&hellip;
C looks a notch too wide, perhaps also D and G (but I think G should be slightly wider than C because of the crossbar).
I find the crossbar of G a bit too low. 
J is quite narrow. I like that. Its overshoot is tremendous!
Knee of K may be slightly high.
I love the trapping on M and N. 
V and Y may need the join moved a hair to the right.
Z is leaning left a bit.</p>
<p>Numerals
5 looks slightly dark all over.
6 and 9 have quite small bowls, I presume that&rsquo;s intentional?
That&rsquo;s a killer 7!
Lovely.</p>
<p>Lowercase
abcd: wonderful. Well done.
e needs some work. Perhaps the terminal should be lower — the glyph looks a bit closed. The sides could be a hair heavier. The stress looks funny on the top half&hellip;think the BCPs on the top extrema need to go inward slightly?
f is narrow, reflecting the J, but I think here the hood needs to be longer.
Have you worked more on the lowercase? I&rsquo;m struggling to find anything to say for the other letters except they&rsquo;re really well executed!?
z might be leaning left like its mother.</p>
<p>Ampersand and £ may be a bit too geometric for the font. I&rsquo;d like to see a £ with a hood like on f (horizontal with a vertical terminal)&hellip;also if you&rsquo;re sticking with its current form, I think the bar could be a bit lower.</p>
<p>Grave accent on a needs to be more left. Acute on e should be more right. Check the ones on O/oacute and O/ograve too. Oslash and oslash are lovely!</p>
<p>Yogh and wynn look a bit wide and need to be tauter I think (but I am not very familiar with these characters). Lowercase schwa looks rotated anticlockwise a little.</p>
<p>Have I been unkind enough?!</p>
<p>Looking forward to seeing more of this, but do remember to sleep! ;)</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Thanks again for picking some of the nits out of my work, Ben. I&rsquo;ve addressed all the problems you pointed out. Aw, looks like I forgot about the K, but I think you&rsquo;re right about that one, too. I remember sweating over that glyph a couple of weeks ago, not understand why I never got it right.</p>
<p>The numerals are intentionally narrow and small-bowled, yes. That way they can have full height without looking to intrusive in text settings. At least that&rsquo;s my theory. I still haven&rsquo;t printed anything on paper, but to me it looks good on screen.</p>
<p>I like the ampersand&rsquo;s shape, but I&rsquo;ve made it slightly looser. The new £ is much better. The e was really screwed up, I don&rsquo;t know how I could have overlooked that. It&rsquo;s better now.</p>
<p>All those diacritics are hard to get right. Are their placement better now?</p>
<p><img src="/images/old-images/ethos_fix_4602.png" alt=""></p>
<p>I promise to give you some feedback on your lovely Eternal Italic later today or tomorrow.</p>
