body: "Hi, I'm working on some packaging design for a food company. I need a find
  a font which will be used for all product names (varying from diary, meat and fruit)
  to make it consistent. The concept is healthy low fat products. I am currently thinking
  of semi sans or a rounded sans, brush scripts or maybe a soft serif with swash caps.
  Any suggestions to what might fit? \r\n\r\nOystein"

    of floaty, swashy fonts that aren't too fussy. Approachable.

  body: I've seen the feature on the packaging fonts, but not the soft scripts. Thanks,
    they are great resources Stephen! Thats where I got some inspiration for direction.
    I also checked out Sudtipos, and found Amorinda worth considering. I'll keep searching.
