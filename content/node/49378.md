  packaging, and wanted some suggestions please.  The font currently used is (Apple)
  Chancery, which I personally can't bear.  I'm sure there's something out there better
  than that.   Let me know your thoughts.\r\n\r\nCheers\r\n\r\nJH"

  body: '"Pita" is Greek vaguely referring to pie, also refers to Lebanese style flat
    bread that is either split open as a pocket or rolled and stuffed with sandwich
    fillings of various sorts. I''m not sure what "pitta" is, though.'

  body: "'Pitta' or 'Pitta bread' is pretty commonplace in the UK.  I see from one
    link it's spelt with a single 't' in some countries, so sorry for any confusion!\r\n\r\nBack
    to the point though - any Eastern Med fonts that anyone can suggest?\r\n\r\nJH"

  body: For eastern Mediterranean I take it you want something that not only reflects
    Greek characteristics, but also something slightly Hebraic and/or Arabic in character,
    without obviously being a parody of any of those. Something with horizontal or
    reversed contrast might do the job, like [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/ingrimayne/smokehaus/|Smokehaus]]
    or [[http://www.linotype.com/90528/itczipper-family.html|Zipper]].

    thanks anyway.  As you're probably aware, food manufacturers can be quite conservative
    - and fonts are no except.\r\n\r\nJH"

  body: It would make it easier to suggest a Font for your package design if you post
    a preview of the overall design. Most likely you will not be using just one font.
    Perhaps even a non mediterranean looking font with a little tweak... can do the
    job.

  body: "I strongly agree with tishbite: this would be easier if we could the rest
    of the art.\r\n\r\nThe traditional \"Greek\" looking letters seem a bit cliche.
    J Weltin's \"Balega\" suggestion looks like an elegant solution."

  body: "If you want/need to be subtle, try a font with reversed stroke contrast (where
    the horizontals are thicker* than the verticals). Greek has this a bit, and it's
    a main feature of Arabic and Hebrew. Look at the work of Excoffon and Bloemsma
    for starters.\r\n\r\n* Although preferably not much.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
