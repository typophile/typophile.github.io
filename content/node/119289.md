  used to designate allied territory in Germany.

  body: "Edited:\r\nGood call Kevin. \r\nIt is important to note that signs of that
    era were not produced directly from fonts. The process varied from hand drawn
    stencils to various screening techniques. \r\nIn Germany  road and railroad signs
    since the 1930s were required to conform to a DIN standard, i.e. a standard issued
    by the Deutsches Institut f\xFCr Normung (German Institute for Standardization)
    which used predecessors of the digital DIN Schriften Neuzeit Grotesk. Some info:
    \ http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DIN_1451 \r\nThe letter maker would almost certainly
    have seen these signs. The use of something similar for British signage in post
    WWII Germany is entirely logical and the signmaker could well have used DIN specimen
    sheets for the Zone signage.\r\nI agree that the sign can be pretty well duplicated
    with Neuzeit Grotesk Bold or Black, using the condensed version for the letters
    Kevin mentioned. You will have increase the weight of the condensed letters to
    match the regular ones and check the digital version for any variations from the
    sign lettering.\r\nDon"
