  body: "The font is Spellbound (Not Spellbound BV by Blue Vinyl).\r\n\r\nIt's a WSI
    font. WSI was a major font ripoff cloning outfit, but this one may have been an
    original. Over many years, I've never seen it under any other name. Note, though,
    that because of its dubious parentage, I'd be leery of using it commercially."

  body: Thanks for that info, Fivos. Sensation would appear to be an earlier font
    than Spellbound. Maybe the original, eh?

title: I'm looking to identify the font that was used for the word Jumpstart in this
  image. I know very little about fonts, so any help would be greatly appreciated.
  Thank You!
