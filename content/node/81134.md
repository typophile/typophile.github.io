body: "Hi,\r\n\r\nI'm looking for an all-caps font that can create characters that
  are two different heights. One height is for letters that would traditionally begin
  a word and have longer 'stems', and one height is for letters that are shorter /
  lower in height (but still upper case). I've included an example to clarify. \r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\n\r\n"
