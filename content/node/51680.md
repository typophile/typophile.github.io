body: "Hi all,\r\n\r\nI realise that this is a fairly broad question, but I'm looking
  for some general information on the (hopefully peaceful) coexistence of GSUB and
  morx tables within a single (.ttf) font.\r\n\r\nSay, for example, I wanted to design
  a multilingual font where some of the supported scripts require a morx table to
  function properly in Cocoa applications, but I also wanted typographic features
  to be accessible in applications like InDesign which don't (AFAIK) make use of AAT
  features.\r\n\r\nShould I avoid duplicating functionality where possible (for example,
  implement small caps only in the GSUB table since Mac OS will make use of this)
  or should features be implemented in both tables where possible?\r\n\r\nAre there
  any pitfalls which I should be aware of in terms of possible interactions between
  the two tables? Will such interactions be consistent across applications, or will
  there be issues which might arise in some apps but not others?\r\n\r\nAlso, are
  there any issues related to interactions between development tools which would favour
  implementing one table before the other? (For opentype features, I do most of my
  work in FontLab Studio 5 (though Adobe FDK is also an option available to me). For
  morx tables I use the Apple Font Utilities Suite (ftxenhancer/ftxanalyzer) for morx
  tables. I also have FontForge installed, though I rarely use it. I'm running Mac
  OS 10.5).\r\n\r\nAny advice or references would be appreciated.\r\n\r\nAndr\xE9"

    interest.\r\nFrom my experience, you can put AAT and OT into a single font. But
    the applications choose one or the other. In other words, you have to put GSUB
    for OT and duplicate the same functionality in MIF for AAT.\r\nThis is what I
    was doing for quite a while now because for a single Arabic font that you want
    to use in a workflow, exporting from Illustrator to FinalCut for example, this
    is -not a perfect way- but the only way to make it work.\r\nBut this is a lot
    of work and a lot of duplications in making a font and still it doesn't always
    work as intended. I love to know if there is a possibility for Mac text engine,
    that when AAT is engaged, it also borrow some features of OT at the same time,
    or vice versa.\r\nBut my experience was either this or that."

    be wrong here, but Adobe Arabic <em> appears </em> to work fine for me in TextEdit.
    In Tiger (or perhaps I'm thinking of Panther) .otf Arabic fonts definitely <em>
    didn't </em> work in AAT, but Leopard seems to support them. So at least for Arabic,
    one could just use OT features provided you didn't mind requiring your font's
    users to have OS 10.5 or greater. The general problem, though is definitely still
    there (e.g. I don't think AAT can deal with Indic languages unless a morx table
    is present).\r\n\r\nEven without dealing with multiple script systems, though,
    the set of behaviours which can be implemented under AAT and OT are not identical,
    so there may be cases where one would like to implement a feature in one system
    and then approximate it as closely as possible in the other to maximize the number
    of applications which can effectively make use of glyph alternates, etc. which
    are present in the font.\r\n\r\nAndr\xE9"

  body: "Yes indeed. Leopard has completed its OT support for Arabic. But it is not
    yet completely spread throughout the Apple applications. FinalCut and Motion,
    among others, still need AAT.\r\nAt some point they will all take advantage of
    Leopard OT support for Arabic but it's not done yet. Just a couple of weeks ago,
    BBC\_World\_Service asked me to put AAT to their newly purchased Persian font.
    It was not working with their FinalCut for their Persian TV production.\r\nThe
    core of Mac text engine remains AAT. NeoOffice which uses Leopard engine, can
    easily use Arabic OT fonts for the body text. But we noticed few days ago that
    its localization for Persian (and surely for all Arabic script) has some designated
    OT fonts (Arial, Tahoma, Courier New etc.) which don't work on Leopard for Arabic
    rendering and they don't show properly in application menus etc.\r\nYou are absolutely
    right. For basic behaviour there is no problem. But for the typographic side of
    it, I only can approximate one to another."

  body: "AFAIR, the problem is that in Mac OS X 10.4 Tiger, if a font has both OpenType
    Layout tables (GSUB/GPOS) and AAT tables (morx etc.), the OpenType Layout tables
    will always be used and the AAT tables will be ignored. In Mac OS X 10.5 this
    may have been changed, but I don't have time to check it now. \r\n\r\nThis is
    why SIL developed two separate versions of their Arabic fonts Sheherezade and
    Lateef, one for OpenType Layout applications and one for AAT applications. They
    differ in family naming so both can be installed at the same time (e.g. one for
    TextEdit, the other for InDesign Middle East). \r\n\r\nhttp://scripts.sil.org/FontDownloads\r\n\r\nA."

  body: "> Leopard has completed its OT support for Arabic\r\n\r\nWell, not really
    \"completed\" -- much rather implemented a first version. But OpenType Layout-based
    Arabic support only works in the new CoreText API (first introduced in Tiger),
    not in the old QuickDraw and ATSUI APIs that many applications still use. For
    all other complex scripts such as Devanagari, AAT is still the only solution.
    \r\n\r\nTo underline what I've written before: in Mac OS X 10.4, if you put Arabic
    or Indic AAT and OpenType Layout tables, then the system will recognize the presence
    of OpenType Layout tables and will ignore the AAT tables, but since it cannot
    process the complex-script OpenType Layout shaping for those tables, in the end
    nothing will work properly. \r\n\r\nAdam"

  body: "Yes that bug existed with Tiger and the AAT component of my fonts were ignored.
    But it has been fixed since version 10.4.2 or so and if a font has both, AAT gets
    the priority. This was very important with Tiger that it's OT support didn't include
    'init', 'medi' and 'fina' tables. With 10.5 the problem is not as serious. If
    AAT in ignored, OT can still do the job. The problem remains though, with some
    Apple applications. Motion seems to be one of them. My dual identity font for
    BBC although solved their problem with FinalCut, but I had to produce an AAT only
    version to work with Motion.\r\nBut as I mentioned and Adam confirmed, for core
    processing, such as localization, still AAT rules.\r\nSIL solution is a safe bet.
    But it's the workflow that is sacrificed in this whole technology conflict."
