  a very good kerning table (or it is not spaced very good)\r\n\r\nAs an example,
  if you type:\r\n\r\nHEV. Available. HOH. Victory. Hello.\r\n\r\nYou notice that
  the spaces are not that very good \u2013 and you always have to go n front of the
  V and A and adjust it. Of course I could use the optical kerning in InDesign, but
  I think it\u2019s rather strange that the built in metrics aren\u2019t better adjusted.\r\n\r\nThis

  body: "It bugs the heck out of me, too. The Adobe, Linotype and Monotype Gills have
    been like this since they were released around 1990. As far as I know, they are
    from the same source and are identical. The problem is that some of the caps are
    kerned against the space character. A few of the other early Monotype PostScript
    fonts (such as Plantin) had this \"feature.\" I don't know if Gill Sans Pro has
    this problem.\r\n\r\nMy solution has been to use the Bitstream version (Humanist
    521)."

  body: "One would think that an opentype version would be able to use features to
    overcome the spacing issue.  I have not seen the Pro version either. \r\nNot so
    much in the lighter weights, but in the heavier weights, Gill caps seem to be
    too bold for the lowercase. This makes times when they meet awkward for me.  It
    makes me want to space them more but then it looks loose.  I have always found
    Gill Sans to be high-maintenance and use it in small doses. It is a shame because
    it has some very good characteristics as well.\r\n\r\nChrisL"

    WHOLE THING, before I noticed it was Gill Sans. I can usually smell it from a
    mile away, and I normally am not a fan. The power of design/typography.

  body: "In Quark you can add kerning pairs. You can also change the AFM file so you
    can have properly kerned font. Or in FontStudio open it up and use the the kerning
    part of the program (my favorite way). Try the kerning module for free from DTL,
    use Fontographer if you need to or FontLab. There are literally dozens of ways
    to custom kern your font. Before postscript, we used to output repro and kern
    whole fonts of the big 20 or so fonts so we would not have to kern twice, we got
    it close for 10 pt for text and 24 pt for headline fonts. Adobe was at Linotypes
    mercy in recieving the original PS fonts and they got what Typographers got,  200
    or so kerning pairs, most not too nice. \r\nThe customers did not care, they got
    freed of me billing them a couple of grand a month for galleys of type and type
    modifications.\r\nIf you want I can send you kerning pairs from an AFM of a competiting
    font (URW Giltus) that has almost 1000 kerining pairs. You would have to adjust
    them somewhat, but I think they would do pretty good for you.\r\nI agree, many
    classic fonts are in need of better kerning. The best thing, though is you can
    do it yourself for a bulk of a font pretty quickly. The biggest issue becomes
    \"OK I KERNED it, now all my previous work is going to be too tight because it
    will essentialy be kerned twice\" Strike a good balance between perfect for one
    size and crap at other sizes. I guess that is the problem founderies have too,
    what looks good for my application, may be inappropriate for some one or everyone
    else. Gosh fonts are a mess.\r\n\r\nNice thing is that some designers are make
    better use of kerning, but some don't. I think you could probably have a cottage
    industry just custom kerning for clients.\r\n\r\nThe Truth shall set you free"

  body: "Short answer to Goran's question is that yes, now there are many better alternatives
    to Gill Sans. As Paul said much earlier, Bliss is one of them.\r\n\r\nLong answer
    is that if he's stuck with having to use the older Adobe/Linotype/Monotype digitizations
    'out of the box' then he could add a great deal of value to the project either
    by altering the spacing as Rodrigue suggests or by buying the Opentype Pro...\r\n\r\nThere
    is so much wrong with Gill Sans as a jobbing typeface I really wonder how it gets
    recommended as a corporate face (outside of the BBC and the Church of England).
    The local university here sets everything in Gill and Bodoni, with the result
    that half of what they publish is unreadable.\r\n\r\n"

    like another favorite (Univers) it is loose as a goose, as we used to say. It
    was that way in metal and the song has remained the same, all these years. Does
    Monotype pro actually add glyphs/characthers? To me that would be the only reason
    for purchasing it, because kerning a font is pretty easy. \r\n\r\nThe Truth shall

  body: "Kerning a font is something that the average user probably not would get
    in to, unless Quark is used. I know that some ex Quark users that shifted to (the
    much better IMHO) InDesign often ask about how you adjust the kerning in InDesign.
    As far as I know, it can\u2019t be done from InDesign.\r\n\r\nMe, I could easily
    take the font to FontLab and adjust the kerning pairs, but that would probably
    have another effect \u2013 when someone else opens the document with a standard
    Gill, so I don\u2018t think that\u2018s a good idea in this case.\r\n\r\nI would
    see if we could purchase the Monotype Gill pro instead, or just forget about it
    and always use the Optical kerning in InDesign.\r\n\r\nI\u2019m more sort of a
    little dissappointed that such a standard typeface is not properly kerned/spaced,
    it bugs me I guess, and I wonder why.\r\n\r\nHere in Stockholm, Gill is used for
    almost everything that the \"City of Stockholm\" communicates. Gill together with
    Times, hehe \u2013 could it be more boring? ;-)\r\n\r\nI really think there is
    time for a re-design of this graphic identity."

    said elsewhere on typophile) as a corporate face, and it's rubbish in most applications.\r\n\r\nGill
    is not the only 'standard' typeface that spaces badly out of the box. I've been
    to situations where magazine art directors were custom kerning the Adobe/Linotype
    Futura. By the same token, contemporaries of mine walked into their first job
    precisely because they knew what to do with a custom H&J or kerning table in QX.\r\n\r\n<em>I
    could easily take the font to FontLab and adjust the kerning pairs, but that would

    a standard Gill, so I don\u2018t think that\u2018s a good idea in this case</em>\r\n\r\nMy
    point about adding value to the project would be exactly that; make a non-standard
    version of Gill Sans specifically for your client that spaces properly. Get their
    approval to pay you for all the extra work and insist that it becomes the new
    [insert client name here] Gill Sans to be used in all their documentation, signage
    etc. Whoever advised City of Stockholm (or University of Auckland for that matter)
    to adopt Gill Sans as part of the earlier graphic identity was unaware of this,
    but I don't see why the situation can't be improved with a litle more finesse."
