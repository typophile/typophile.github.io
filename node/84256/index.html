  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>Hi All,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to VERY brave here and open up a small part of a website that I&rsquo;m currently designing. I&rsquo;d love to know people&rsquo;s thoughts on the typography - this isn&rsquo;t my strongest area and is something I&rsquo;m really keen to improve on. I&rsquo;ve included a few notes on my thought process when laying this out. Please tell me if you think I might be doing something wrong! Also let me know if any of this doesn’t make sense.</p>
<p>A few notes - This is for a website and uses fonts on the google web fonts service displaying on a vista machine - therefore some things might not look as crisp as they would in a perfect world.</p>
<p>(You may need to scroll to the right to see these full and I&rsquo;ve also uploaded them as files and there are a few more notes below them)</p>
<p>NORMAL VIEW:
<img src="/images/old-images/norm_4746.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>WITH GRID
<img src="/images/old-images/withgrid_3494.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>I wanted the heading to have twice as much space where possible above as they do below so that are in close proximity to their paragraphs.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve set the base font to a simple arial at 13/18. I&rsquo;ve tried to stick to the classical typographical scale but 12 was too small and 14 too large in my opinion.</p>
<p>The &ldquo;leading text&rdquo; (first bit in italic) is open sans condensed italic at 24/36. I&rsquo;ve added a 4px margin at the top which puts it on the baseline. I&rsquo;ve made this up to 18px by adding a 14px margin at the bottom.</p>
<p>The headings are all open sans condensed.</p>
<p>Secondary headline is 36/36 with 9px margin top and 9px margin below</p>
<p>Third headline is 24/36. 36 seems a bit too much but the likely hood of these going over 2 lines is very low. I also thought about shifting this a few pixels so that it falls on the either the baseline or the &ldquo;half baseline&rdquo; but decided against it.</p>
<p>The quote on the right does a similar thing to &ldquo;leading text&rdquo; in that it shifts as its so close the baseline.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Thanks for the reply riccard0. I really wanted the headings to be in close proximity to the text that was associated to it so that a quick scan made it obvious. Perhaps its obvious anyway?</p>
<p>Does that make sense?</p>
<p>Does anyone else feel the same? would be great to get other opinions on this.</p>
<p>appreciated
