body: I&#39;m doing some research for a typographic project which hopefully will result
  in a typeface to be used in small sizes. <BR>Right now I&#39;m looking for type
  specimens of 6 pt Plantin and Fleischmann. Specifically the italics, but if possible
  the entire family. <BR> <BR>Does anyone have samples to share, and/or know where
  I should search for them? <BR> <BR>Kind regards, <BR> <BR>

  body: What&#39;s 6pt Plantin? <BR> <BR>As for the Fleischman &#40;I&#39;m still
    unsure to spell it with one &#34;n&#34; or two...&#41; I have the glorious 1908
    Enschede specimen book on hand - arguably the best source for anything Fleischman.
    I can get you good 600dpi scans, or 1200dpi macro photo images &#40;which however
    will be focused adequately only on a few letters at a time&#41;. I could also
    do 2000dpi photos but those would require a tripod &#40;which I have, it&#39;s
    just more work&#41;. But I can&#39;t do this for free, sorry. Please let me know.

  body: Is the Plantin reference to Monotype Plantin?  <BR> <BR>A great letterpress
    face. Tough as nails &#40;for a Monotype face

- body: Yeah, I think it&#39;s the Monotype version.  <BR> <BR>Perhaps not a conventional
    beauty, but in this case I&#39;d say the beauty is in its practice. <BR> <BR>I
    would love to see some of the work you&#39;ve done with it, but I guess it&#39;s
    long gone. <BR> <BR>

  body: Fredrik <BR> <BR>Print never goes away. We did a book back in &#39;86 with
    the Plantin, The Compleat Melancholick. Still in print, both the letterpress and
    the offset editions &#40;the latter reproduced from the letterpress proofs&#41;.
    I guess that should tell you something about how successful a publisher I am!!!!
    &#40;nothing worse than not putting a title into OP status&#41;.  <BR> <BR>But
    if you are interested, I pop the offset version up on eBay from time to time &#40;currently
    up&#41;, and they are both always for sale on Amazon. Obviously, just another
    compositional exercise &#40;but, I always liked the book&#41;.

    lc &#34;a&#34; piss me off so... Gerald, doesn&#39;t Archetype have it? I&#39;ll
    be coming in this Tuesday - maybe I can do a print for you, Fredrik. My trademark
    effeminately light touch on the press would reveal the forms quite well I hope
    &#40;on good paper, which I have on hand&#41;. <BR> <BR>BTW, I just dug up my
    copy of that Carter article &#40;always a pleasure to gaze upon such technical
    eloquence&#41;, and I think there&#39;s a plausible reason why all the samples
    bottom-out at 8 point: foundries start behaving quite strange below that - some,
    like ATF, go nuts &#40;but to me at least in the best meaning of the word&#41;,
    while others &#40;like the Imprimerie Nationale&#41; are too tentative. This causes
    any design analysis to start venturing into human psychology - always treacherous
    ground. <BR> <BR>hhp'
