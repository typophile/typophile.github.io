  body: "Since its lettering on a racecar, there may be some variation from the original
    font. The closest I can find is <a href=\"\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/congress/black/\">Congress
    Black</a> Designed by Adrian Williams published by Linotype in 1980.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/CongressBlack_5263.jpg]\r\nThe
    counters aka bowls in Congress Black have a more rounded appearance than your
    lettering, which has something of boxy or squarish effect. I also note that your
    lettering is wider than Congress Black.\r\nDon"
