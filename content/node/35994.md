body: "I'm going to open a can-o-worms here. I think the letter 'g' is one of the
  few characters that really stand out in a type face. There are a multitude of ways
  it can be crafted. With so many fonts out there, I look at a few letters -- the
  lowercase g in particular.\r\n\r\nThis is how I propose the thread will work. I'm
  not here to militarize things... just some friend standardization. \r\n1. Go to
  a font site (I prefer http://www.fontshop.com/ because you can link to samples)\r\n2.
  Find your font\r\n3. Post a link to it (if possible to the sample) along with the
  font name.\r\n\r\nFor example:\r\n\r\nNatalie Script OT\r\nhttp://www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/paratype/natali_script_ot/?sample_text=Gg&sample_size=36\r\n\r\nYou
  can also post an image. Let's see your G-sus."

    I've ever started here. Definitely bend the rules... can't have the good without
    the bad.\r\n\r\n@Nick: I like Digitalis - it's got character. Nubian is something
    I would use daily if I had license to it. ;)\r\n\r\n@Grant: I'm not sure if the
    font in \"Meet the g-friends\" is Opentype... if it is that's hot. I have a set
    of Zapfino and keep going through the alternates when typesetting.\r\n\r\n@Bald:
    I agree, the Trebuchet g is quite basic. I think the more a font is used, the
    more it gets abused. The more it gets abused, the more you want it disposed. Comic
    Sans anyone?\r\n\r\nHere's something I came across today:\r\nhttp://www.fontshop.com/search/?q=Deviata&sample_text=g&sample_size=388\r\n\r\nI
    don't like how it flattens out at the bottom of the character. It's not noticeable
    at lower sizes.\r\n"

    to 388, but sometimes the window can't quite take an image that large. Try 288.
