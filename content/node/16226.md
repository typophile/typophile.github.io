  this is the first font ive ever made. I haven't done the numbers yet, but im working
  on them now, just thought I would try for some feedback here since you all seem
  to be total experts on all this :)\r\n\r\nthanks in advance"

    of paper... maybe with those round ended scissors come to think of it."

  body: I guess just any thoughts. I've never made a font before, i guess this one
    doesnt really seem that origional. Are there any parts that appear to heavy from
    the rest of it? (besides the crossbar on the A) I already fixed that just not
    in the image thats on here. Any things that might improve it maybe? I dont know
    haha..

  body: From the look of it the font seems to be deliberately akward & childish. Like
    the kind of thing you would see cut out & pasted to a school bulliten board. It
    works if thats what you wanted to do. To suggest that it look different I would
    have to know what you wanted the font to be like. Maybe it's time to start reading
    some more about type so you can formulate your purpose in a clearer way.

  body: "Nice first go-around! Better than mine (nope, I won't show it).\r\n\r\nE,
    F, T, and Z are straight across their tops, with no bevel to them (compare with
    the top of B, for example). It makes them look heavier than they are. "

  body: "lherrou: thanks. the b isnt really beveled (rounded?) though, it just rounds
    off at one end.\r\n\r\neben: you're right I guess I wasnt very clear, this is
    the final version of the font:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/PaperCut
    (font).gif]\r\n\r\nI was trying to make a font that was big and bold that could
    be seen both as a somewhat childlike font, but also one that was bold and strong
    enough to be used as a display font for non-child-like uses. im not really sure
    if i'm explaining that well, basically I  wanted it to be somewhat childish, but
    not so much as to regulate it to hokey uses like sand and comic sands (fonts that
    I strongly dislike) are. Also, I was trying to learn how to use the curves tool
    since id never had to use it with such percision before (I've only done drawing
    in illustrator, which is far far easier than planning out the letter S for example,
    haha). \r\nand the third goal of the font was to be able to create something where
    the letters had an overall theme that connected them all very clearly, so that
    they could be used as a somewhat-body-copy font if they needed to be, i say somewhat
    because while they would probably fail at normal copy sizes under 12, they might
    work out ok at around 15 or 20."

    text up top. I left it up there so you guys could see how the font types out in
    sentances.)

  body: "You must mean comic sans. I think it has a brassy adolcent feel. There is
    NOW WAY that you would want to use this font for body copy in a book or magazine
    though. This one is strictly a title kind of font. Okay maybe for 5 or 6 line
    sof text but after that - no way dude.\r\n\r\nThanks for postring the poster.
    Is that actually how you feel?"

  body: "haha.. yeah i did mean sans , I guess I had sand on the brain. Yeah thats
    what i meant by sort of, it would be terrible for true body, I just meant for
    a few lines.\r\n\r\nno not really. I'll probably make other fonts, it was fun.
    I don't think Ill be quite as cavalier as I was at the beginning of this one though
    now that I know what an investment of time it is haha. \r\n\r\nIt is true that
    illustrator's curve tool has been slightly ruined for me, as its impossible to
    be as precise or wonderful with it as you can with the curve tool in fontlab,
    but I still enjoy both of them."
