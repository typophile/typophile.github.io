  quirk in Font Agent Pro (FAP).\r\n\r\nIf an OpenType/CFF font has a PostScript name
  longer than 28 characters,  FAP does not recognize it as a font.\r\n\r\nFontBook
  handles the font fine, as does dropping it directly into the various font folders
  on OSX. And when running the name audit in FontLab, PS names longer than 28 characters
  (29 and 30 char. in my examples) are deemed to be fine. The font also work fine
  in WIndows XP.\r\n\r\nIf I remember correctly this 28 character limit was an old
  spec. Hasn't this changed? What are current best practices?\r\n\r\nJames"

  body: "To my eyes it also proves that FAP handles font names the old-fashioned way.
    PSNames may be an old spec but is still used in some apps (Word Mac 2004, FileMaker
    etc.) and is one of the most constraining parameters in namings. I find it actually
    weird that FAP looks for PS names in an OTCFF font, where it should at least look
    for OT Names/Mac Names (the latter has the same flavour of length limits by the
    way)\r\n\r\nOn Windows XP I found some fonts with PS names longer than 28 chars
    that simply wouldn't install. (plain drag n drop install, no fancy FAP stuff.)"

  body: "The limit on length of a PostScript FontName is 31 characters. FontAgent
    Pro seems to have a bug.\r\n\r\nIn OpenType CFF fonts, Adobe has historically
    chosen to limit our own PostScript FontNames to 27 characters, so we can fit names
    of the form \"PSFontName.otf\" within 31 characters (old Mac Classic filename
    limit). However, this is not a requirement of the format.\r\n\r\nAt some point,
    we'll decide we're no longer worried about Mac OS 8/9/Classic, and we will start
    having longer PS FontNames when it seems helpful.\r\n\r\nSide note: Classic Mac
    font menu name (name.ID=18) also has a limit, which is 63 characters, but there
    are limitations in old versions of Mac Office which require that the name have
    unique characters within the first 31 characters, as Mac Office would ignore anything
    after that. (Serious bug!)\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\n\r\nT"
