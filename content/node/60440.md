body: "Hello!\r\n\r\nI'm a student from Italy, who is developing a passion for typography.\r\nI've
  read many books on graphic design, and i recently bought an italian-only book:\r\n<a
  href=\"http://www.aiap.it/libreria.php?ID=153\" title=\"Caratteri e comunicazione
  visiva\">Caratteri e comunicazione visiva</a> (Characters and visual communication)\r\nthat
  officially introduced me into the vast world of type.\r\n\r\nI feel i can appreciate
  typography a lot more than i did before, but this book left me with lots of questions.\r\nI
  work as a freelance graphic designer, and I'm recently making a logo for an attorney
  and consultant studio: they wanted it simple, and we opted for a serif type-based
  logo.\r\nBefore reading this book i wouldn't care about the chosen typeface, i would
  have used the first font that looked nice, let's say Cambria. But now i care more
  than i could think before.\r\nThe problem is that this book teached me nothing about
  how to choose a typeface!\r\nAnd that's why i'm looking for another book to buy
  and read as soon as possible. I know that there isn't a magic formula, and i think
  i should train my sensibility towards typography more than looking for guidelines...
  but I have to start somewhere, haven't I?\r\n\r\nSo I'm here, asking for your help,
  looking for books and ideas.\r\n\r\n\r\nP.S. from the title i would choose \"Thinking
  with type\" but I'm not 100% sure."

  body: I will always recommend starting with 'Elements of Typographic Style', which
    has good information on how to approach font selection.

  body: "Check these out by [[http://www.doyaldyoung.com/books.html|Doyald Young]].
    They're more about how to <em>design</em> a font rather than how to pick one out.
    (which, when it comes to identities, according to Doyald is always the way to
    go.) They're valuable books to anyone concerned with pairing the right type with
    the right company though. \r\n\r\npenn"

  body: "Thanks everyone! I appreciate all the answers and I will buy \"Elements of
    Typographic Style\" since it's a Bringhurst's book and is, generally, a must-read.\r\nDonald
    Young's books are very interesting too, and i will look for someway to buy it
    without 40\u20AC of charge for international shipping.\r\nFor the lawiers logo
    i'll probably use \"Palatino\"."
