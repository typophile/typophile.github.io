  called Citizen Ave. We're in the middle of the business plan and developing the
  logo has been next to nerve wrecking. Below is what we have currently. We're happy
  with the bold/heaviness of the image, however, we're struggling with the font -
  \r\n\r\nWe have been downloading endless fonts online. To compromise, we need to
  have uniformity and a freehand look. Nothing we've downloaded translates that. Can
  I jog the collective rolodex for a font that might work. :-)\r\n\r\nAlso, what is
  your opinion of the placement of the name? Thank you for your insight!\r\n \r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/CITIZEN_AVE_FINAL[2]

  body: "You're asking about font choices when you should be asking about the very
    core of the design.  When I look at this, I don't think of hip hop at all.  I
    mean, not at all.  I think outdoor suburban theme mall.  Or, with that quaint
    little lamp, some hackneyed recreation of a 19th century London street corner
    in Disneyland.  Is this at all what your group is into?\r\n\r\nFrom a technical
    point of view, I can't imagine this looking good when it's scaled down to small
    applications, such as business cards, letterhead, CD covers, etc.  Also, this
    would be a hot mess in black and white.  Finally, what was your process on this?
    \ Did you start on paper and then get it into the computer?  If it didn't start
    on the page, then go back and start there.\r\n\r\nI don't mean to be harsh, it's
    just that this design fails on so many levels, I need to encourage you to go back
    to the drawing board.  Start looking at some logo designs (perhaps, more helpfully,
    hip hop designs) that inspire you and pay attention to the balance of simplicity
    and impact.  I mean, I'm not really into hip hop, but I know it's a Wu Tang production
    when I see some iteration of that W symbol.  That's what you need to be going
    for."

  body: "HA! You said hot mess.\r\n\r\nIt does look more like a tee shirt design,
    CD cover or web banner than an actual logo, but then again bands have a little
    more leeway to go that route and tend to rebrand themselves with every major CD
    release anyway. If you don't plan to use this in print much (biz cards, letterhead,
    anything at a small size) you might be able to get away with it.\r\n\r\nI don't
    know many free fonts, but when I think hip-hop I think of Aerotype's graffiti
    selection. https://www.aerotype.com/ I like Gamestreet for it's readability.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/citizen_6576.png]"

  body: "Thanks to nvhladek for driving your point home. LOL The funny thing is, our
    first point of reference was the Wu logo. Second was Gangstarr, and third was
    Aerosmith. To answer Maverick, we are definitely looking for something that can
    trancsend to apparel. Back to Nvhladek, the more we look at it, the more we're
    starting to see Euro movie trailer than anything else. \r\n\r\nI think the tagline
    makes it look really quick - and for all intents and purposes, not too many people
    are going to see the logo with tag. However, once we began pulling elements away,
    it starts to look kind of blah. \r\n\r\nI guess number one problem is, we understand
    the concept of weight and balance, but we're not typographers/designers. We're
    musicians -- we're trying to own as much of our product as possible, though. Any
    tips/angles would be helpful. Thanks again!"

  body: "If you pull elements away and it starts to look blah, then it means that
    your design is not succeeding.  With a good design, the idea should be to remove
    elements until you get down to the core; when you get down to the \"a-ha, there
    is nothing more to take away, nothing more to add\" moment, then you've got it.\r\n\r\nGood
    for you for making an attempt, however.  Here are some leading questions to help
    your process:\r\n\r\nWhat are the themes that inspire and form the content of
    your music?\r\nWhat emotions, ideas, actions does your music attempt to evoke
    from the listener?\r\nHow does your location, age, identity, etc. shape your music?\r\nWhat
    are some images and symbols that represent your music?\r\n\r\nYour music is the
    inspiration for the logo.  From words and sounds, let your imagination generate
    images.  This will lead you to THE image that will be your logo."

    This has been extremely helpful and I'm sure we'll have something cooked up by
    the end of the week. Thanks for facilitating!!\r\n\r\nTony"
