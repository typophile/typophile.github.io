    at MyFonts as an alternative to LetterHead Fonts.\r\nSee <a href=\"http://typophile.com/node/30452\">this
    discussion</a> for why, if you haven't already."

  body: "You work looks great! But don't forget to update your page titles :-)\r\n\r\nIf
    I might kibbitz a little more (sorry!), I would also suggest maybe moving the
    \"more stuff\" link over to the rest of your navigation and changing it to something
    like \"logos\" or \"samples.\"\r\n\r\nI know you didn't ask for suggestions &
    maybe you're still working on it, so I apologize if this comes across as nitpicky. "

  body: "Thanks for the nice comments. Inarges, I am not a website designer, what
    does it mean to update your page titles? and how do you do it?. I could use all
    of the help I can. That was a great Idea, Inagres. I think i will make that change.
    Suggestions are very welcome as I am new to this.\r\n\r\n:)\r\n-Charles"

    the window. I don\u2019t know how to do it in Web Studio but you can edit your
    pages with Notepad. You\u2019ll find the title in the beginning, between &lt;title&gt;
    and &lt;/title&gt;\r\n\r\nI really love your lettering. Good to know I can buy
    from Myfonts."

  body: "Thanks, Charles. I'm glad you took my suggestion in the spirit it was intended.
    Criticism from strangers on the internet can be very annoying.\r\n\r\nTo expand
    on what Grot Esqu\xE9 said, I would suggest changing each page title to something
    descriptive. So your homepage title might become \"Charles Borges Lettering\"
    and the page for your commercial fonts could be \"Charles Borges Lettering: Fonts\"
    etc.\r\n\r\nThe page title is what shows up by default when someone bookmarks
    your site (as I did!) in their web browser. \r\n\r\nI believe that descriptive,
    relevant page titles also help your site become more visible search engines."
