  unfortunately this is the only example I could find.\r\nAny ideas what it could
  be?\r\n\r\nCheers!"

  body: "I have a feeling that the Cinema 16 font was commissioned - a bit of look
    around, and it seems to be their main brand font - but who knows which foundry
    it came from.\r\n\r\nBut Maxwellmaxwell, you've hit the nail on the head with
    the second example of that thread - that's what I'm looking for (or one close
    to - I think the G is different, and more of a classic sans serif/arial derivative
    shape). I've done several searches, and had a good look around, but haven't seen
    much that comes close, other than pixel fonts.\r\n\r\nCheers for the links ross_robinson,
    but, yes, I need something more detailed. I'll be wanting to use it in a magazine
    display font context,  so I'll need it well drawn, spaced and with a full character
    set.\r\n\r\nSurprisingly difficult to track down eh? I thought it was just me
    not being able to see for looking..."

  body: "Superpois is nice, probably your closest match to date robboynes.\r\n\r\nI've
    discovered the dotted Avant Garde style face I was searching for was a bespoke
    job by Build for Flying Lotus, possibly based on a Letraset catalogue  type called
    Pinball.\r\n\r\nhttp://wearebuild.com/projects/flying-lotus\r\n\r\nAlso see here\r\n\r\nhttp://www.whynotsmile.com/project/pinball.html\r\n\r\nBut
    then it's also used here, so I'm not sure, perhaps it's available somewhere.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.yesstudio.co.uk/view/gemmabooth/all\r\n\r\n\r\n"
