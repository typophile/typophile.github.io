  assumed that Function was a rip off of Adobe&#39;s Futura without actually setting
  the type and looking for differences. But it seems fishy to offer hundreds of dollars
  <BR>worth of typefaces for fifty dollars, especially since they <BR>claim that their
  faces are licensed. That would be pretty <BR>ballsy to not change the names of those
  fonts, a la <BR>&#34;Futuri&#34; &#34;Chantilly &#40;Gill Sans&#41;&#34; and &#34;DawnCastle

  body: That&#39;s what I thought...But how come Adobe doesn&#39;t go after this company?
    And the fonts...are they just traced from hard copies of the originals &#40;to
    avoid having the same curves and points&#41;? <BR> <BR>Also, are the &#34;Baskerville,&#34;
    &#34;Bodoni,&#34; and &#34;Franklin Gothic&#34; names not protected by law because
    they are all digital revivals from the same source?

    must be something, er, lax about Germany&#39;s laws in this area because it is
    home not only to Softmaker, but also Brendel Informatik and Primafont &#40;which
    resurrected itself this year&#41; '

  body: Mike, I thought many of those URW  &#39;knockoffs&#39; were from their days
    as one of the early digitizers for other foundries, using their Ikarus system.
    My understanding was that they were allowed to keep versions of the fonts they
    digitized, if they renamed them &#40;like Bitstream was too, I think&#41;.
