  I was wondering if someone knew where I could find a free script font, wich also
  is royalty-free. I know I could find a lot at free font sites, but I don't if they
  are \"really\" free.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance!"

    In general royalties may be due when redistributing the font or building it into

    proprietary. Either way its an infringement. We've seen television commercials
    and newspaper ads using our fonts. \r\n\r\nI've also had to address issues of
    type designers doing knock off versions of our fonts. Even that can be hard to
    stop.\r\n\r\nAn interesting side note, recently it was brought to my attention
    that several fonts of American Greetings were listed on a free font site and credited
    to American Greetings. After a bit of research it seemed that these were released
    legitimately. Shortly after that I got a call from a French package design firm
    asking if indeed they could use these fonts. After running it by our creative

    statement is absolutely false. There are, in fact, many wonderful free fonts available,
    created and shared by many type designers, both professional and amateurs. \r\n\r\nHowever,
    with free fonts you do have to watch for a several things: \r\n\r\n1) There are
    many rip-offs (inferior and otherwise) of professional typefaces. These should
    be avoided, and the original fonts purchased instead. \r\n\r\n2) Many free fonts
    have been designed by amateurs, so you must look closely at every character in
    the font to make sure the fonts meets your needs (and to ensure that the font
    has all the characters you need). \r\n\r\n3) Kerning and other finishing touches
    are often missing, so you should be aware that many free fonts will not work well
    as text fonts, and may require a lot of special \"hand-work\" with spacing in
    display sizes. What you save on getting a \"free\" font, you may loose in extra
    time required to make the font work for you.\r\n"

    their own foundries. That list has not been updated in several years, and some
    of those links may no longer work, but it was among the most well intentioned
