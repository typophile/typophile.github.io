body: "I'm having a feature developed for a web project that involves rendering type
  from 6 different typefaces at a pt size of 9-10px. We're having problems with the
  quality at such a small size--gets very jagged. Anything below 12pt gets pretty
  screwy. We are basically generating a preview image on the fly from the font files.
  It works similar to the the preview feature here, however we're not selling fonts:
  http://www.fontshop.com/\r\n\r\nDoes anyone out there have experience with something
  like this? We're using 'glib' and I believe everything runs through PHP or related
  programming. We have everything working great, it's just that rendering the smaller
  pt sizes is giving us fits. My developer thinks it has something to do with anti-aliasing.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nWilliam"

    properly [[Hinting|hinted]] fonts to get good results under 12 pt.

    but rather that he or the car just wasn't tough enough. ;)\r\n\r\nThere are only
    a couple of dozen fonts that have both the stylistic and technical ability to
    scale to 9 pixels per Em while remaining readable. What's the actual problem?"

  body: "Once we're working at these sizes, (below 12pt) the rasterizer, OS, and formats
    used become critical. You're working on a project for the web, so presumably the
    end user can use any modern OS and browser. What's of concern is how you are rendering
    the image. Are you using TrueType OTF or CSS/OTF? What rasterizer are you using?
    A Win, OSX, or something custom? \r\n\r\nAnother comment: regarding your comment,
    \"..gets very jagged.\"\r\nA hand-hinted TTF/OTF on a Win system, would have the
    gasp table set to show B+W rendering at sizes below 12pt. This is because Anti-aliasing
    at these sizes tends to cause more problems than it solves. So the characters
    are rendered B+W (like a bitmap) so that it remains legible. This does result
    in a stair step affect, but it's a compromise that needs to be made, if you're
    hinting these small sizes.\r\n\r\nAnother note, although there are more than a
    couple of dozen hand-hinted quality TTF/OTF fonts, the stylistic differences at
    these sizes all but disappear, as David mentioned,. The truth is, there just aren't
    enough pixels to go around. This means that the differences between Arial, Helvetica,
    and even Frutiger or Optima, all disappear at these small sizes, when you have
    to make a legible glyph, and have no room for stylistic differences.\r\n\r\nJason

    or autohinted fonts with Windows defaults that alias below 12pt - if that\u2019s
    the case you could run the fonts through \"<A HREF=\"http://www.geocities.com/SiliconValley/Lakes/8162/\">ttfgasp</A>\"
    to set antialaising at all sizes (license permitting of course)\r\n\r\n"

    things that we think might do the trick. I'll let you guys know how/if they pan
    out.

    the rasterizer, OS, and formats [] become critical\"\r\n\r\nAll the rest is sane,
    just be a bit careful using \"pt\", because e.g. \"12 pt\" can contain anywhere
    from ((LESSTHAN))12 pixels per em to 32 or more per em depending on OS and display
    device. Since that makes it possible for a 9 pt to be 20 pixels, or more, and
    9 being a smaller size than 12, we always have to think in pixels, not points,
    like, I believe a gasp table."

    take up 25 pixels and look wonderful with anti-aliasing turned on :-)
