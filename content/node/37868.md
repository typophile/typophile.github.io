  I'm having 2 components which are overlapping eachother. I have a question cause
  when I do the fill out (presing \"<\" button)  I can se som lines which looks \"smoothered\"
  - Tjek out img's - marked with a red circle.\r\n\r\nMy q'tion goes like this: Is
  the smootheredness a problem when I generate the typeface?[img:sites/default/files/old-images/fontlab01_4665.gif][img:sites/default/files/old-images/fontlab02_5812.gif]"

  body: "From my experience, you need to decompose any overlapping components before
    generating. You'll also need to 'Merge Contours' (ctrl + F10 on PC)\r\n\r\nGood
    luck!\r\n\r\n- David"

  body: I also always merge contours. You can then remove any points that might have
    been left by such inaccuracies as in your images.

  body: "The little bumps you are seeing are the result of the way FontLab previews
    outlines when paths overlap. \r\n\r\nYou <em>can</em> generate a font like that,
    and it will work with some programs (InDesign, for one), but other programs (Illustrator,
    for example) will refuse to print a document containing such fonts. Even when
    they work, they sometimes look weird on screen (InDesign makes holes appear at
    the overlaps at some zoom levels). In any case, overlapping paths are not allowed
    in the PostScript Type 1 spec, so you don't want them in your finished fonts.\r\n\r\nHowever,
    it's okay to have overlaps while you're working on a font. It's hard to make some
    kinds of letter shapes to look right (scripts, for instance) without overlapping
    paths. And if the design is still in flux, it makes it easier to play with the
    design.\r\n\r\nIn the end, before you generate a font, you will need to remove
    the overlaps. Be sure to check the results when removing the overlaps. Because
    the resolution of the em square is limited, you may get a little distortion due
    to the fact that the new control points that are created where lines intersect
    have to fall on a whole-unit coordinates."

    on the overlaps. \r\n\r\nA."

  body: "Overlapping contours are clearly a problem for the buggy end of PostScript,
    but overlapping composites should always work (i.e. fill as you expect), because
    of another \"bug\". \r\n\r\nCheers!"
