@craig: I agree on the r. I probably need to make it thicker where it meets the ball terminal. What you say about p r n is a difficult subject. Do you feel the same about Lexicon? The spur on q should maybe be bigger, otherwise I don't see the problem. I dislike the loop of the g in many typefaces, so it's good to know you like mine :-)

@santiago: I disagree with both. They shouldn't be anything, except for looking good and being legible, which they are. Have a look at Lexicon.</div>

My only critique would be that the extreme thinning in the /b,d,p,q/ etc looks a little too thin next to the /t,s,c/ and /z/.

But then again, you are far more advanced than myself so feel free to ignore this.

		<div class="commentbody">Thank you James. The extreme thinning does look a little off at first. It did to me too. However, after a while (non-typedesigners are not bothered by it in the first place) I got used to it. In text, it creates something that untill now (hopefully) could only be achieved with Lexicon. I don't know how to explain it, and really you should see the NRC Handelsblad in real life to find out, but looks 'new', fresh and vivid.

Underneath is a picture for a quick comparison. As you might tell from the picture, I'm trying to catch that "newness" from Lexicon, while toning down the quirks, making it suitable for display usage too. I also included some Sensato traits, leaving my personal mark. Well, that's the idea.

		<div class="commentbody">Redesign x. It is an unintentional swastika that creates a distracting illusion of movement.

The ball terminal on y is too small.

f is too limp and too wide. It looks like a willow tree hanging out over a river, but the tiny baseline serif is not big enough to support the weight. This is entirely out of place with lively feeling in the rest of the letters.

Overall I like the feeling of this face. At first glance it seems like a typical Dutch book face. But the more I look the more I see something much more youthful and vibrant. Keep putting that energy into the font as you fill it out. Watch out for calligraphic curves that start getting soft, which is happening to the loop of the g and the descender of the y.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">This is beautiful work Jasper. I love the thin joins, it looks to be a rationalised Lexicon with influences of things like Arnhem or even Mercury.

I agree about the x. I've tried this style and it seems very difficult to make it work.

/u/ may be slightly wide.

X-height isn't quite even. Look closely at the /v/ next to the /u/. I think this may answer the difficulty Craig raised about the arched letters with their spurs. If in doubt print a line of text and look at it end-on.

The ball terminals are great, but I think I'd make them crisper on the inside (they look slightly teardrop shaped).

Tail of /y/ is weak.

Perhaps, just perhaps, make the bowl of /g/ a fraction smaller.</div>

@ Dunwich: Yes, I already decided to get rid of that one-serif-only-idea in /k v w x y/. The y as a whole is still a bit weak. It'll take more than just a larger ball terminal.
I'm not sure about the f. I think this happens in many fonts and is not necessarily a bad thing. 

<em> Watch out for calligraphic curves that start getting soft, which is happening to the loop of the g and the descender of the y. </em> I don't really get what you mean, sorry. 

@Ben: x, along with k v w y will be fixed :-)

/u/ looks fine to me, but I haven't made any high-quality prints yet. 

I exagerated the overshoots a bit, and I like the liveliness it gives in text, but maybe I should tone it down a bit.

The ball terminals are crisp on the inside, not clearly visible though.

I really don't know what to do about that y. It's anoying me.

Yes, I thought the same thing about the g.

		<div class="commentbody">There is something not quite right about the execution of what appears to be a design principle: the asymmetric serifs. The left ones are curving, the right ones straight(ish). That principle is not upheld in for instance the /x/ and the /k/. 

The other thing that bothers me is the application of the flare-like broadening of certain elements that unhinge the balance of certain glyphs. Eg in your larger sample it shows in the /ij/ combination. I assume both glyphs share most of their form, but the /i/ appears to lean back to the right in comparison to the /j/. I think that the stress introduced by that broadening needs to be compensated in the lower part of /i/ by (maybe) extending the serif a bit, or putting some stress in the area where the stem approaches the serif.

That said — I kinda like the overall design. </div>

		<div class="commentbody">Bert. The asymmetrical serifs are indeed a design principle. It's not persued in letters like v w x etc, because of the sharper corner there. I tried it and making it smooth just doesn't work. I might get rid of the asymmetrical serifs, though the difference between letter like v w x and n m l doesn't bother me at all.

I suppose by "flare-like broadening" you mean the bend to the right at the top of i and j. This is seen in many fonts and is actually to compensate for the serif at the top left. What do you mean with "lean back to the right"?

I'm glad you like it :-)

Offtopic: I was told there's an article in the Publish magazine, which briefly discusses something about a mistake in the typography of De Volkskrant. IIRC you mentioned that you once wrote a letter to De Volkskrant about that and they published it, so I thought you might be interested.

		<div class="commentbody">That's a more difficult choice. I marginally prefer the closed bowls: the overall delicate build of the forms seems to mean they fall apart slightly with the interruptions. I'm not against interrupted strokes — indeed I have them in a typeface I'm working on now — but as far as character goes, I think there's plenty of charm here without having to introduce new quirks, if that's the only reason you're thinking about them. It's rather a small difference at the end of the day, so it should just depend on which version you fancy.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">There are some problems with balance: the axises are off. Consider /g/ — you have critiqued others with the remark that it leans back etc., well so does yours in relation to /e/. And /a/ has a similar disbalance, probably because the bowl has a belly that’s pulling the ear down.

The way you cut the lower part of /d/'s stem is interesting, but this is an isolated ‘message’ because you treat the same area of /a/ in different, more traditional way.

I’d like to suggest that you should define some basic characteristics and try to stick to them when constructing the font. These basic characteristics may seem to confine your creativity, but actually they will help you design a harmonious set of glyphs (where i use that word in its meaning of being of one family). And in case you re-define one of your principles, it is far easier to implement.

I would like to paraphrase a great Dutch designer by stating that a designer first of all analyses a problem and then defines its solution. </div>

"I’d like to suggest that you should define some basic characteristics and try to stick to them when constructing the font." I have, and feel like I put everything together quite harmonious. Which parts are different from the 'basic characteristics' in your view? The complete (updated) characterset is on the top of this thread.

Underneath are two options to move away from Lexicon. The top is a an adaptation of the latest version of Richard, being widened, softened and altered of shape, moving in a more classic (garamond, etc.) direction. The bottom is an older version of Richard, which has a lot more originality and has a more slab-like feel to it. I'm not sure as to what direction I'll take (perhaps both), but I just wanted to share this with you. Cheers! jasper

So... here's the solution. This whole Richard thing started out as Sensato Serif, but moved away from Sensato quite quickly. Hranr's comment about going back to the source, made me remember that (yes, I forgot). So, Richard will, from now on, be Sensato Serif. They don't match currently, but it shouldn't be too much work to make them match a little more (I don't want them to match perfectly). What do guys think? Only problem is, typophile won't let me upload picts currently, so the pic is here: http://www.flickr.com/photos/designtown/6969991066/in/photostream#/photos/designtown/6969991066/in/photostream/lightbox/

The serif-'a' needs a hand on the upper terminal. The terminals of 'c', 'r' and 'f' are well accomplished, but in 'a' the terminal doesn't return inwards (sorry for the pleonasm), but it stays in the same angle and gradually tends upwards. The consequence is a hanging terminal. I also see you've aligned it with the bowl from the left side†. Often, the terminal doesn't hang as far to the left as the bowl††. As for the terminal of 'y', it looks unsteady†††.

The serif lengths are not consistent. Particularly, the upper serif of x-height letters could be longer (see /qu/ pair).

Nice 'd'/'q'.

†  And why did you change your mind? They weren't aligned before!
††  The uttermost example could be <i>Diotima</i>. If you take a look at the opposite extreme, I don't know any 'a' that hangs more than <i>Caslon</i>'s.
†††  Can you post a PDF or a bigger image of the character set next time? I wanted to look closer at the upper right of 'z' :-)

For me, the term 'usable' embraces almost all existant fonts, but I think you're referring specifically to text-font usability.

I'm curious about which designers do you mean by that, but naturally, it's something you wouldn't be posting in this forum :-)</div>

As for naming names, there's not much to be gained from that. Now, if one of them happens to say "this is not very original" here then I surely couldn't keep my mouth shut. But I think we're safe because the boring ones don't like discussing things [in public] in the first place.

		<div class="commentbody">First impression: the full stop is too heavy. Aim for something similar to the thinner part of the diagonal width. (Hope this makes sense).
Also: I prefer slightly taller descenders and ascenders. There IS a point where the portruding parts help figuring out the shape and meaning of words for the reader. That means that there has to be a certain difference between the x-height and the glyphs that ‘hold out their arms’. Try blurring some samples in PhotoShop and you will see what I mean.

On an altogether different note: why are you aiming for a coherent sans/serif family? Why not cut your teeth on a display face?</div>

The length of ascenders and descenders is a tough call, because it has to match the sans serif. Or would it be ok to give the serif longer ascenders/descenders?

I'm going sans/serif because 0. It's a great learning experience. 1. It's a way to stand out (if not much) from the crowd. 2. It's functional. 3. Designers like it a lot because they think it takes away their job of pairing fonts, so it should help sales. Perhaps I'll also make a display version out of Sensato Serif, but that's not really on my mind now.

		<div class="commentbody">Think about how the sans and serif need to work together. How often will they be mixed inline, and if they are, do serifs not play a role in apparent size? And maybe deviating their apparent size could actually be useful... In any case, remember that in a text font lining things up exactly is almost never the point, so don't discount nudging around things like the x-height. I <em>would</em> keep the caps and numerals lined up though.
