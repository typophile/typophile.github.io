body: "Logo is for a sheet metal company. Im trying to get the 's' look a little like
  a blade or something sharp..implying precision - that kind of thing. Just having
  trouble getting it exactly right. When the line through the centre of the 's' is
  thin..there seems to be too many fiddly bits either side...the thicker line is a
  cleaner cut but it starts to look less like an 's'. Any suggestions?\r\n\r\nThanks"

  body: The S treatment concept is a nice one, but I would seriously consider <em>not</em>
    abbreviating the name, a bit too close to BDSM for comfort.

  body: "How'bout rounding the M top left so's to get the sheet through?\r\n\r\nSet
    it on three lines (BRITANNIA / BSM / SHEET METAL)?\r\n\r\nRaise the B and S top
    half and lower the S bottom half and M a wee bit? \"_/~\" (a metal sheet with
    two bends in it)"
