  body: "He probably couldn\u2019t find the old thread any more, created a new one
    (11:23&nbsp;PM), then suddenly found the new one, thanked Ryuk there (11:27&nbsp;PM)
    and didn\u2019t know how to delete the new thread. Quite understandable, given
    that Font ID threads don\u2019t show up in the <a href=\"http://typophile.com/user/me/track\">list
    of one\u2019s own posts</a> for some reason."
