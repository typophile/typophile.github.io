  body: There are quite a lot of fonts of varying qaulity, that try to resemble asian/chinese
    calligraphy. For example Mandarin, Chineze or Faux Chinese.. try searching after
    fareast, chinese decorative or asian on myfonts.com, there you will find serveral
    examples with varying degrees of abstraction.
