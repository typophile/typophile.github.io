body: "Hello,\r\n\r\nI\u2019m about to start writing my diploma thesis in media computer
  science. \r\nThe idea that occurred to me first was trying to improve an aspect
  in the process of type design, as I really like the combination of design and technology.\r\n\r\nSo
  I had a look at FontForge and FontLab with regard to the ease of use for designers.
  OpenType feature creation in those tools seems to me not to be made for people with
  a less technical background. Even OTMaster and VOLT which claim to do or sound like
  doing so didn\u2019t meet my expectations in this respect. \r\n\r\nThat\u2019s why
  I think about developing a more designer-focused tool\u2026\r\n<!--break-->\r\nMy
  first humble ideas are:\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>A tool to visually edit OpenType features
  with emphasis on a user-friendly interface (without unexplained cryptic abbreviations)</li>\r\n<li>Integration
  of the specification in a way that it doesn\u2019t clutter the user interface but
  is always within reach</li>\r\n<li>I\u2019d like to both offer visual tools as well
  as allowing for directly editing the code</li>\r\n<li>That would have to include
  live-updating and checking feature code on the fly\u2026</li>\r\n<li>But on the
  other hand it could avoid/indicate errors before font is compiled</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\nProbably,
  I will be focusing on AFDKO-syntax. So far I don\u2019t have a decent knowledge
  of AFDKO, but I already read quite a bit about OpenType and AFDKO and I\u2019m following
  the threads in this forum about OpenType development for a while (I especially enjoyed
  reading [[http://typophile.com/node/55208|this one]]). Also, I did my own first
  tests with OpenType feature generation using AFDKO.\r\n\r\nNow I\u2019d really like
  to know what you think of my <em>vague</em> idea. Is it reasonable? Probably I missed
  some important aspects. Ideas and criticism are very much appreciated. Eventually,
  I might as well need some test persons in order to evaluate my prototype.\r\n\r\nThanks
  for reading and for your comments! \r\nBut dont\u2019t forget: it\u2019s only a
  diploma thesis\u2026\r\n\r\nMiZ"

    of the newer apps aimed at web development, like Coda:\r\nhttp://www.panic.com/coda/\r\nI
    think you can pick up some ideas from that kind of applications."

    He's open-sourced a lot of his code, and it's all specifically aimed at making
    tools for font development. Several good tools have already been made using his
    code, and not just by him.\r\n\r\nCheck it out:\r\n\r\nhttp://tools.typesupply.com/"

  body: "What I would find useful is a standalone program that can automatically set
    up OT classes and code based on what glyphs exist in the font using Adobe\u2019s
    suggested glyph naming. A good app for building combining diacriticals would be
    a big help as we don\u2019t have one on the Mac platform AFAIK. You should also
    get in touch with people who build fonts with lots of complex replacements\u2014Patrick
    Griffin at Canada Type, Ale Paul at SudTipos, and House Industries\u2014to see
    if they have needs that current software is not meeting.\r\n\r\nI second Mark\u2019s
    suggestion that you look up Tal\u2019s code. You should also contact Tal and Erik
    van Blokand to see if there\u2019s pent-up demand for something that nobody has
    got around to yet."

  body: "Thanks for all your suggestions!\r\nI already had played with Tal's libraries
    at [[code.typesupply.com]] and think they look quite promising. Before bothering
    people directly I wanted to see if there is some interest in an application like
    this at all. Probably I will add underware to the list.\r\n"
