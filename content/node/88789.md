    copies, \"inspired versions\" etc. This is not a game to some of us! I love capitalism
    but I despise lazy and situationally ethical businesses.\r\n\r\nNo problems with
    revivals but to sell \"bad\" and incompetent redrawings of stuff that is less
    than a decade old is just offensive."

  body: They strike me as a decent bunch... you bring any of these ripoffs to their
    attention? With so many new fonts out, I can see a few sneaking under the radar.
    There are certainly worse offenders out there.

  body: "Now some of you may get it but this is a prime eg. This font took several
    years to figure out the parallel dilemma. When I saw Flavour 5 or 6 years later
    I was not amused. Compare the \"l's\" because that is where the essence is...
    and then he missed the parallel in the other characters and \"did the caps like
    an amateur. When I confronted him he said, \"Oh yes, I was inspired by Pooper
    Black.\"\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/eg2_6668.png]\r\n\r\nWay too
    much of this going on!"

    seem a bit close at first blush, but it's really just\r\nanother example of a
    now-ubiquitous style; and the fact that\r\nit came a decade later only makes it
    <em>more</em> OK. The second is\r\nreally not even close, even though is was apparently
    a case\r\nof inspiration (a normal and good thing). My own concern is\r\noutline
    theft - the remixing of an actual font file.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
