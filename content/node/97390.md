  body: I'm no scripting expert, so I don't think I can help with that. But all but
    the last step of this (and maybe even that) can be done with a combination of
    TTX (to convert the fonts to .ttx text format and back) and a text editor to do
    some searches and replaces. A good text editor usually has some way to batch things.

    could still use some help with the possibility or writing directly to the font

    new SkyFonts scheme, which is pretty cool except for the beyong-stupid five-minute

    an important phone call might time you out\u2026"

  body: "Mark\u2014\r\n\r\nThe ridiculous amounts of money which people are willing
    to spend on cellphone service makes it abundantly clear that font subscription
    services as a reliable revenue stream is the wave of the now, to which Monotype\u2019s
    SkyFonts service attests. As I envision it, a subscription-based font service\u2014costing
    as little as $1 per session\u2014ought to let you to install the font on your
    local machine, for use in an application which you are comfortable using, for
    the duration of one work session.\r\n\r\nAs I understand it, Windows writes fonts
    directly to the Registry, which entails giving explicit permission to do so, anytime
    a font is installed or <strong>uninstalled</strong>. People often get nervous
    about giving such permission\u2014as well they ought, given the abundance of malware
    which masquerades as legitimate software. Also, people of less than stellar moral
    character might simply choose not to uninstall the font. My proposed workaround
    would be to write directly to the Font Cache, so that the font was immediately
    available, but would be cleared from the Cache at the end of the working session\u2014assuming
    that the same level of permissions would not be required, and that the task could
    be easily accomplished"

    lot of younger, self-styled designers appear to have serious reading comprehension
    problems. The \u201CConvert to Outlines\u201D was always envisioned as the primary
    \u201CSave Your Work\u201D option\u2014with \u201CConvert to Bitmap\u201D and
    \u201CSave as PDFx File\u201D\u2014assuming that the PDF generator actually creates
    a non-editable and wholly reliable character-subset document.\r\n\r\nIt probably
    wouldn\u2019t work in CorelDraw 9, either\u2014at least, not with OTF fonts. With
    v10 and beyond, Draw relied on Windows native Postscript support, added with Windows

  body: When I have to do this sort of thing. I use a Windows program called "Do it
    again" from spacetornado.com. It lets you record a series of mouse clicks and
    keyboard activity and then repeats it as many times as you like. It's a little
    bit Chitty chitty Bang Bang/Wallace & Gromit but when you have to repeat the same
    tasks on a zillion fonts, it does the trick.  You can regulate the speed of each
    event but don't set it too fast. In the middle of the night, Windows might decide
    to do some task that causes a brief slowdown and the whole thing goes out of sync.
    Slow and steady. It's a great excuse to get away from the computer for a day while
    it's running. Make a backup because sometimes, things go very, very wrong. Once
    it escaped the Fontlab window and deleted family photos.

    generator at KXAS-TV in 1982. Later (three years or so), I made extensive use
    of them when I operated a Compugraphic 8400 dedicated typesetting machine.\r\n\r\nIn
    Ye Olden Days, macros were usually limited to 256 characters. You could get around
    this restriction by nesting macros within macros\u2014I seem to recall using as
    many as seven to make typesetting business cards simply a matter of typing the
    name, then hitting the right arrow key, where the program would pause for additional
    input, then lather, rinse and repeat\u2026figuratively speaking, that is."
