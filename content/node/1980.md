body: Hi, <BR>Im hoping someone can help me. <BR>I have an illustration i created
  in illustrator &#40;black line on white background&#41;, and have imported to a
  quark document to place on an image. I have imported it as an eps. When i created
  a pdf, the illustration looks bitmapped slightly and is definatly not as smooth
  as the illustrator version. <BR>Im assuming it will be fine when i print it out,
  will this be the case? <BR>And if not, what is the best way to import a line drawing
  so in quark you can place it on any background? <BR> <BR>Thanks alot for your time,
  <BR> <BR>david.

  body: David, what version of Quark are you using? InDesign, displays at a medium
    quality and it looks bitmapped but if you select high quality you get to see how
    it will really print. I don&#39;t know if quark has that feature or not. My best
    guess, if you are working with 4.1, &#40;the last version I will ever use&#41;
    is it will print out fine. Did you know InDesign out puts to PDF directly and
    supports PDFX. Thomas Phinney, our Adobe expert please chime in. Dan

  body: When viewing the PDF in Acrobat, check to see if you have &#34;smooth line
    art&#34; checked in your display prefs settings. This will help reduce jaggies.
    Also, you can zoom in lots to see if things get any more jagged. I expect that
    the vector illustration is still vector, so you&#39;re probably fine. <BR> <BR>BTW,
    QuarkXPress has added high res preview capability in QXP 6, although it is not
    as flexible as InDesign&#39;s options. But it sounds like this is a question of
    what&#39;s in the PDF, not how it shows up in QXP. <BR> <BR>Regards, <BR> <BR>T

  body: And if I&#39;m not mistaken, the &#34;Smooth Line Art&#34; option is now on
    by default, in Adobe Reader and Acrobat 6, correct? <BR> <BR>A funny story, I
    have been working with acrobat for some time now, and after we got our upgrade
    to 6 in the mail I load it up, first thing I do is load a vector file, and viola,
    antialiasing. <BR>So I turn to the chap across the way and exclaim &#34;Thanks
    God, they have finally added antialiasing to vectors other than text in Acrobat&#34;,
    after which he says, &#34;Um.. well, you could have just turned it on.&#34; Doh!

  body: You could thank god Adobe finally turned it on by default. <BR>That was really
    dumb to disable antialiasing out of the box  <BR>since it&#39;s a single feature
    that can make a document look  <BR>either really awful on screen if it&#39;s disabled
    or really good if <BR>it&#39;s enabled.
