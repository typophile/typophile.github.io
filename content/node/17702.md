body: If I have a tiff or psd file with a white background on a white page in InDesign,
  is it necessary to have a clipping path? It will be going to print so will the white
  background box faintly appear on the white paper?

  body: White is not a color and so will not print. The only time you really need
    a clipping path is is you have something which is directly behind the image --
    overlapping -- and you want that.

    for anything done in photoshop. Since you're mostly outputting PDFs though, like
    you said it doesn't really matter what files you use in your layout. :-)

  body: At the last adobe roadshow the guy there said that the future lies in using
    pdfs instead of eps/tiffs. I found that a bit problematic because with pdfs you
    have to know from the beginning how the document is going to be printed. What
    do you think about that issue?

    is built to use the native formats of Illustrator and Photoshop. So why struggle?
    It also handles transparency better from these formats. \r\nA lot of these ideas
    come from working with Quark. I am not talking about Quark.\r\nAs for pdf, the

    most print media not only accept pdf, they request it. Properly prepared pdfs
    are full res, support vector art and embedded fonts, and are really small.\r\npeace"

    in the future Adobe goes out of business (gasp), EPS and TIFF will presumably
    still be viable formats, while AI and PSD won't."

    you find an orphaned PDF on your desktop and aren't sure whether you should open
    it in Photoshop,  Illustrator, or just Acrobat; I think there's some value in
    using the least complex file format suitable for a given image.\r\n\r\nAnd if
    you're going through iterations of your Photoshop/Illustrator artwork, saving
    with different version numbers, it's handy to just save off a 'flat' EPS/TIFF
    with the same name each time, so that links in my Quark/InDesign doc can just
    be updated."
