  body: I would consider it incorrect to mix old style and lining numbers on the same
    page, let alone the same date. I will be interested to see what others say.

  body: Yes, the mix is very disconcerting. [[http://typophile.com/node/58475|This
    thread]] which addresses similar issues might be of interest.

  body: "I disagree with Don about not having the two on one page: old style and lining
    just have different goals. For instance, you can use one for the main text and
    the other for page numbers...\r\nBut I agree that mixing the two in the same line
    makes the text look odd."

    lining and non lining figures on the same line when the semantics is clearly distinct

  body: "I have been known to use lining and oldstyle figures together in a single
    text for different purposes. It can be done. I think of it as analogous to knowing
    when to use capitals vs. lowercase.\r\n\r\nIn your example, however, you are being
    inconsistent, without any semantic logic. \r\n\r\nAlso, in most style guides the
    use of the ordinals in \"21st\" would be incorrect. Even if one would read it
    as \"21st,\" in formal writing the date should be set as simply \"September 21,
    1794.\" "

  body: "Lorem\r\n\r\nI once agreed that having lining page numbers and OS within
    text made sense. After all, if the rationale for OS numbers is provide smooth
    typographic color within the text stream, then why should they be used outside
    the textstream, in the running heads (particularly if the heads were in full caps).\r\n\r\nI
    could never get an editor to agree with me, and gradually realized that they might
    be right. Having two different sets of numbers _may_ inadvertently confuse a reader,
    and that is a cardinal sin in good typography, in my opinion."

    numerals well away from superscript note cues and most mathematical content even
    if used for the rest of the running text..."

  body: "> practically anything might confuse a reader\r\n\r\nTrue, but you aim to
    minimize the possibilities.\r\n\r\nAlthough I did think of a place where I _might_
    use lining numbers with OS. In a scholarly text I would have used footnote references
    lining, even if the text elsewhere on the page is OS. This was because with 10pt
    text, footnotes were set at 7 point, baseline shifted, and the light weight of
    the reduced OS numbers would make them too weak.\r\n\r\nI'd have to do a lot of
    testing (well some) first if I was still doing books, because many fonts have
    true superior figures that could be used without the weaking of using a reduced
    font. OS footnote refs might be acceptable in that case."

  body: "I'd agree with Kent, your example has no rationale. Consider the following:\r\n\r\n\"In
    1933, Whosis developed the equation (put equation here).\"\r\n\r\nI have set texts
    where dates & non-mathematical number usage used old-style figures, but equations
    used lining figures. \r\n\r\nAs to confusing a reader, one should always have
    some sense of who a reader might be. I once set a book where the designer specified
    the chapter opening epigraphs to be set in italic. The run-in source had the author's
    name also in italic, with the title in roman. Usual practice in such a situation.
    An editor objected; it might comfuse the reader. You know, they might think of
    that wonderful novel <cite>Ernest Hemingway</cite> by The Old Man and the Sea.
    I'd add that most anyone without at least a high school education wouldn't have
    understood the text of the book, filled as it was with academic jargon . . ."
