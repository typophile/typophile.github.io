  \"Guru\" would be available for ichatting or skype talk. \r\n\r\nI need some guidance
  on conversion. Basically I'm trying to get a .fon with multiple bitmap sizes in
  it into a single workable font in flash. I'm using bitfonter and fontlab and have
  some questions.\r\n\r\nI can pay you for your time.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance. \r\n\r\nMatt"
