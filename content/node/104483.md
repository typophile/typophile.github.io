  |The American Intelligence Community (IC) is starting to resemble a large cast of
  delinquents, a Faustian opera where bad behavior seeks constant rationalization
  and confirmation.  And like most bad behavior, the real remedy might not be that
  complicated.  Restraint is always an obvious solution; unfortunately, this is an
  obvious path seldom prescribed or taken by any branch of government these days,
  especially Intelligence agencies.  Ironically, the 9/11 attack in New York, the
  worst warning failure since Pearl Harbor, produced a knee-jerk windfall for American
  Intelligence.  Like public school systems, failure became a kind of fiscal stimulus.
  \ Subsequently, government agencies that could embed \"terrorism\" in their mission
  statements were showered with tax dollars.\r\n\r\nThe logic behind such largess
  is bigness, the assumption that more is the key to effectiveness: more personnel,
  more toys, more facilities, and more deficit spending.  Unfortunately, these days,
  big Intelligence looks more like the problem than the solution.  And the performance
  deficit didn't begin with Benghazi or Boston. It took ten years for the American
  IC to find bin Laden.  Several of his thugs still serve today as propaganda martyrs
  at Gitmo, yet to be convicted of anything.  Nonetheless, all are hosted at American
  taxpayer expense, indefinitely, with three hots, a cot, and a Koran unsullied by
  the touch of infidels. The Israeli Mossad took out most of Black September, Palestinians
  responsible for the Munich massacre (1972), immediately after the atrocity.  The
  Russian FSB took less than two years to find and kill  Shamil Baysev, Chechen jihadist
  responsible for the children's massacre at Beslan (2004).  Rendition is seldom a
  measure of effectiveness for successful anti-terror doctrine.  The Twin Towers failure
  in New York was not a one off either.  The slide may have begun with Vietnam era
  \"systems analysis\" where CIA and DOD cooked statistics to suggest there was \"a
  light at the end of the tunnel. \"  And then there was the surprise loss of Shia
  Iran (1979) to theocracy four years after the fall of Saigon.  Or maybe it was the
  surprise advent of nuclear weapons in North Korea and Pakistan.  The Islam bomb
  was a watershed.  Surely the Shia in Iran could not let that Sunni advantage stand.
  \ Alas, American intelligence fudged the call on the first bomb in Pakistan, and
  is still too timid to make a call on the coming Muslim bomb in Iran. \r\n\r\nOn
  this corner:[[http://www.greenoptions.com/t/5279/crown-capital-eco-management-carbon-trading-scam|
  green option community]]\r\n\r\nThe problem with truth is that it often makes action
  imperative.  Alter truth and the need to act can always be deferred. Or maybe it
  was the \"shock and awe\" of not finding any weapons of mass destruction in Iraq
  after being assured by national intelligence  estimates (see George Tenant and Colin
  Powell at the UN, 2003) that Saddam Hussein was so armed.  Were truths told:  Iraq
  1 was about oil and Iraq 2 was about regime change? And let's be candid, since the
  invasion of Kuwait (1990), regime change has been the leitmotif of American and
  European foreign policy.  This sponsored change strategy is underwritten by an assertion
  that imperial Sunni Islam is a protected religion, not theocratic fascism or puerile
  imperial politics.\r\n\r\nRegime change policies have two pillars.  First, Islam
  is said to be \"one of the world's great religions,\" thus entitled to moral equivalence
  and related immunities.  A second axiom claims that the Sunni brand of irredentism
  is the \"right side of history.  \u201CSee almost any public statement on these
  matters by John Brennan, James Clapper, or Barack Hussein Obama.  Unfortunately,
  support to any Muslim faction in their millennial feuds is a little like, as Churchill
  might have said, \"Feeding crocodiles with the hope of being eaten last.  \u201CNegotiating
  with the Taliban is just the first course in the coming South Asia buffet. The Arab
  (or Sunni) tilts in Intelligence and policy are expensive.  Playing defense is always
  more costly -- and often mistaken for appeasement.  And surrender, no matter the
  rhetoric, always has a political cost.  Such things are often managed with mendacity.
  \r\n\r\nAll intelligence operatives lie; it's part of their job.  Heretofore, the
  mendacity was reserved for the enemy.  But now, if Jim Clapper can be believed,
  we need to lie to the folks who vote and pay the bills too.   Peace (talks) with
  the Taliban is the big lie du jour.  The only thing left to negotiate with south
  Asia Islamists is the terms of allied surrender and retreat. The Stuxnet and Prism
  disclosures are just symptoms of decay too, signs that American Intelligence has
  lost its original moorings.  All agencies begin with good ideas until the institution
  becomes the enemy of the original ideal.  Big Intelligence is an example of such
  excess and decay. \r\n\r\nAnd the failure of the IC to provide strategic warning
  is not the worst of it.   American Intelligence is frontloaded; omnivorous collection
  undone by inadequate processing and tainted analysis. Analysis is both the product
  and weakest link in the Intelligence chain.  The most expensive technical collection
  systems on earth feed the worst amateur estimates.  And this corrupt product sets
  the stage for all manner of national security folly. Just two examples suffice;
  John Brennan and Susan Rice.  Personalities, we might point out, promoted recently
  for being agenda merchants, accomplished liars, and not very modest about either
  skill.  Loyalty, not achievement or professional integrity, seems to be the only
  bullet on Obama staff resumes. \r\n\r\nBrennan is clearly the architect of the modern
  a priori paradigm, an analytic model which provides the \"great religion\" narrative
  for administration policy.  Brennan is the Intelligence Svengali if you will.   Decoupling
  Islamism from Islam at the White House is his great career achievement, even if
  has been a little like arguing that cheese and goats are unrelated. The Brennan
  ad vericundium analysis of Islam and Islamism is now fixed policy.  And with Brennan
  at CIA, any event or evidence that contradicts the \"great religion\" assertion
  is likely to be ignored, minimized, or spun.  There may be 16 Intelligence agencies
  in the IC, but CIA is still the big dog in the National Intelligence Estimates pound.
  \r\n\r\nThe Susan Rice saga provides the lurid details of how these things are done,
  a sordid tale of how corrupt and malleable Intelligence analysis has become. The
  immediate IC assessment of the Benghazi slaughter was revised 12 times after passing
  through some unknown number of layers of bureaucratic review in the IC, at the NSC,
  and  over at the State Department.  In the process, facts and conclusions about
  terror and Islamism were altered.  All of which makes the collection of evidence,
  and any objective analysis of those facts, irrelevant. After the Benghazi talking
  point memo was 'scrubbed,' it was released to Ms.  Rice, then UN ambassador, as
  blessed Intelligence.  Rice was subsequently launched at the Sunday chat shows to
  sell a blatant lie, a sanitized edition of yet another national humiliation. \r\n\r\nThe
  Sunni tilt or bias colors recent reportss and analysis of Egypt too.  The IC and
  CIA didn't predict another military coup in Cairo because such speculation would
  contradict the \"Arab Spring\" charade. \r\n\r\nIf ground truth is bureaucratic
  revision or political spin, why call it an assessment or analysis, no less Intelligence?
  If national security analysis can be suborned by political hacks, the IC might be
  just another cabal of pricy beltway whores. James Clapper is one of the most impressive
  chaps working in Washington.  He began his military career as an enlisted Marine
  and rose to become an Air Force general.  Eventually, he became the Director of
  National Intelligence.  His technical achievements in Intelligence collection are
  impressive.  Prism, speaks for itself.   Somewhere along the way, however, Clapper
  also sold his soul. \r\n\r\nAmerican national security has devolved into a very
  expensive game of liar's poker where the voting public needs to be kept in the dark
  too.  Jim Clapper admits as much in Congressional testimony.  In doing so, General
  Clapper tells us that truth and administration politics are mutually exclusive.
  \ Deception in the name of national security might be justified, but lying in the
  name of venal politics makes American Intelligence a very frivolous extravagance. "
