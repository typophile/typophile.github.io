body: "I'm looking to identify (or come close to it) a font used in an old handmade,
  hand painted movie sign for a drive-in theatre. I took this photo this past Summer
  and I just wanted to know what the font was used for the top part of the sign.\r\n\r\nIt's
  most likely done from the 1950's or 60's (when the drive-in was in business) and
  I don't know if the font was copied or just done freehand as I've never really seen
  anything like it before.\r\n\r\nI've attached a photo of the sign... it's the top
  part \"Mustang\" which I'm interested in locating a font close to this.\r\n\r\nTIA,\r\nDale"
