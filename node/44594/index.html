  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>A former employer of mine has asked me to design a custom typeface for them. The project really excites me, but I have never done a custom face before and really feel a little overwhelmed at the prospect of creating one. They have been using an instance of Myriad MM that the designer created and they really like it but they need to have complete rights to the typeface as they want to include it in downloadable media kits for ad campaigns. They are looking for the typeface to have, as they say &ldquo;a neutral sans feeling to it&rdquo; similar to Myriad. They need regular, semibold and bold weights (no italics) that include all the glyphs needed for both the English and Spanish language. Since this is my first time through this process I want to give them a single price and not by the hour because it will most likely take me longer to complete the design. I have no idea what a custom typeface should cost and am looking for some help in figuring out what to charge them. I would really appreciate to hear any ballpark figures on where to start with the cost, or any good guidelines to figure that part out.</p>
<p>I also need to give them some rough timeline for the completion of the design.</p>
<p>Any help is really appreciated,
Michael</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>While mentioning actual prices is frowned upon, discussing formulas to help others arrive at their own sum is not. Suggesting things to consider and what price you think they are personally worth as far as your time goes is always useful. For design it sometimes gets broken down like so:</p>
<p>Design, meetings, production, emailing, price of printouts, cost of media used (CD&rsquo;s/DVD&rsquo;s), cost for purchased materials (fonts, or images), kill fee, late fees, outside of project scope fees, releasing materials, the use of said materials (Logo design and branding or just a business card), and you don&rsquo;t really want the work, the PITA tax.</p>
<p>Once you have a dollar figure assigned to those, you can then look at the project, reasonably estimate your time, for each time consuming item, and work out a price accordingly. For this I&rsquo;d imagine you&rsquo;d want to know how many people will access it, wether you can resell it later, etc… which will all change the cost of releasing your work to the client.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>One of the main reasons to create original, from scratch, custom fonts is to offer the client a licensing program that they can implement without running afoul of any derivative works clauses in existing fonts. Since you say they want to include it as a downloadable font for their media kit, you are proposing an worldwide enterprise license.</p>
<p>A place to start in pricing something like this is to look at what foundries charge for this level of  licensing for their existing fonts. You will find a wide range of prices, depending on the desired font(s). It would be common to pay anywhere from $6000 to $10,000 to $15,000 per font for this type of enterprise license. If these are the prices your client will have to pay for an enterprise license for existing font then what is an original font for their world-wide use going to cost them?</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Do not look at custom font pricing the same way as general graphic design. (Or hanging drywall for that matter)</p>
<p>Always look at the licensing issue instead of just  how much time it takes times the hourly rate. You could almost argue (almost!) that you can do the design for free if the licensing fees are respectable enough. And make no mistake, in the end what you are doing is not selling your client a custom font. What you are doing is licensing your client a custom solution based on their needs, and your intellectual property. A custom solution that you own and manage, and that you could reuse providing your legal counsel writes the license in the proper way.</p>

I was looking for an easy answer, and like life in general, there just isn&rsquo;t one. Several things that I did not and would not have thought of have been mentioned, so thank you. I think part of my problem is that since this is my first time through this I don&rsquo;t think I can price it the same way that the more experienced and knowledgable designers would. Although I can compensate for this with my hourly rate. My other issue is that they are more of a non-profit group, and not a corporation with more funds. If I overprice this, they may not go for it and I would really like to do the project.</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>And add to that the fact that they want a worldwide license ( as opposed to just their in house design shop ).</p>
<p>The fact that you are talking Myriad has me worried for you. Myriad was made to be robust on screen and in print. It could be hard to match the level of fine tweaks and adjustments and hinting* they poured into Myriad.</p>
<p>Also “a neutral sans feeling to it” is a category that&rsquo;s hard to get right I think because you have to be quite subtle.</p>
<p>On the other hand you can get critiques here on typophile. : -) So you do have paddle as it were.</p>
<p>I agree that you should not sell yourself short. Making a typeface that is a good fit to a client is large undertaking. It&rsquo;s best to prepare them &amp; yourself for that. Or else be prepared to pitch for several extensions to the project and a client who isn&rsquo;t sure why they are paying &ldquo;so much&rdquo; for a design that is taking much longer than they thought it would. Agreeing to unfair or slanted terms for time, payment or deliverables will lead to you being unhappy stressed etc and a client not trusting you. On the other hand if you can paint a realistic picture and they agree; then you won&rsquo;t be driven mad, and they will be happier and more respectful of you as well.</p>

<li>Hinting is to help it display cleanly on screen.</li>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Well, I&rsquo;m not a pro type designer, of course, but I&rsquo;ll toss this suggestion out there for others to tear apart:</p>
<p>Go with your baseline hourly rate * estimated hours as your starting figure (estimated hours adjusted as needed based on your assumption that it&rsquo;ll take you a bit longer as it&rsquo;s the first time you&rsquo;ve done it). You can&rsquo;t/don&rsquo;t want to make less than that I&rsquo;m guessing (ie, you don&rsquo;t want to lose money on the deal). In return, they&rsquo;d get the absolute minimum out of that deal&hellip;say one non-exclusive license for the final font files.</p>
<p>Then the negotiating begins&hellip;</p>
<ul>
<li>site license vs. individual licenses</li>
<li>exclusivity (only they can use it) vs. non exclusivity (you can license it to others) vs. something in between</li>
<li>breadth of family provided</li>
<li>etc</li>
</ul>
<p>But if you&rsquo;re just trying to feel them out, maybe ask them if they realize that at the very least, this will cost a lot more than them just purchasing and using Myriad.</p>

</ul>
<p>I don&rsquo;t see how these items are negotiated after the price of the work is calculated. These items must be agreed upon before the price is calculated. One can offer a rundown of different pricing options and let the client determine what they can afford. Most clients balk at total exclusivity when the find out how much it usually costs.</p>
<p>I go back to my first post. Large-scale licensing of existing fonts is very expensive. Since the client is going to have to pay a lot for an off-the-shelf font anyway, the fact that you can give them a custom solution for a comparable price is the hammer that you have to hit them with. (over and over and over)</p>
<p>Can you make a custom font for the $6000, $8000. $10,000 + fee they are going to have to spend for an enterprise license for an already existing font? And can you deliver as high a quality font as the professional font makers?</p>
