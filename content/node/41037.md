  drawing I've noticed 2 behaviours that don't suit me:\r\n\r\n\u2014 Using the drawing
  tool, for sometimes, I couldn't directly close a shape. Instead of a small circle
  appearing next to the arrow when you meet the first point again, I had a \u201C+\u201D
  symbol. Now it's behaving the way I want (circle symbol) but I'd like to know how
  to switch this on/off if it comes back.\r\n\r\n\u2014 Using the rectangle and/or
  ellipse tools, as soon as shapes overlap, an auto-merging occurs?!?\r\n\r\nI've
  looked through the manual (mostly the preferences) and asked around, without any
  success. Help would be highly appreciated.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance, best, mc"

  body: "Dear Eigi,\r\n\r\nThanks for the tip but I'd like to understand what's going
    on with this auto-merging. I checked this on different computers around me at
    school, my FontLab (same version) is the only one doing it!?! Same with the close
    contour symbol\u2026\r\n\r\nBest, mc"

    some feedback.\r\nNote to anyone facing the same problems/behaviours, just wait
    and they will fix themselves. Sorry that I can't give a more precise explanation.
    I went through the preferences, asked my classmates but I never figured it out."
