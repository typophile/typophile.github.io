  italics has undergone through a transformation process and has eventually been reformed
  into an actual typewriter font. <a href=\"http://www.backpacker.gr\" target=\"_blank\">BPtypewrite</a>
  is in fact BPmono italics standing up, with new soft edges, and a whole system of
  supporting fonts including underscored, strikethrough and slashed. As all backpacker.gr
  fonts it supports modern Greek. The italics version remains in all variations, while
  a rough alternate complements the whole set (BPtypewriteDamaged). So, let the BPtypewriting
  begin!\r\n\r\nBPtypewrite's system is very close to caketype's <a href=\"http://www.caketype.com/type/nitti_typewriter/index.html\">Nitti
  Typewriter</a> designed by Pieter van Rosmalen. Check it out if you want extended
  language support, more variations and opentype features."
