  body: "Thanks Concrete for the extra info on PDP-1, and for you guys for 'dropping'
    by.\r\n\r\nThe idea behind PDP-1, MAC and PC is that it is designed so that it
    conceals its real meaning, or the real names they (mis)represent.\r\n\r\nPDP-1
    is the idea of a dinosauric ideology;\r\nMAC is the fresh look it inspire and
    also a model that most of the 'computer word' would give anything to duplicate;\r\nPC
    is the paradigm of a failed attempt to capitalize on the ignorance of non-computer
    users.\r\n\r\nWhen this first come to consideration, I researched for five minutes,
    looking for the desired hardware. My first option was:\r\n\r\nATARI - PC - MAC\r\n\r\nBut,
    the experiment required the use of only domestic brands, to be represented as
    'icons' or pictograms. I also considered it would be best served as images, but
    that would take precious time to accomplish. That left me with a option which
    would make the experiment as fast as fast could be. Living me to the minimal approach:
    Georgia and Align to the left.\r\n\r\nThat has proven to be the fastest approach.\r\n\r\nAndr\xE9\r\n\r\n*
    The above description may change at any time with the reserved option to add a
    picture and color that could shine some light on this puzzle."

    to me... that is a very good idea.\r\nPicture PDP-1, MAC and PC as if they were
    interacting in a ascendent motion and, consequently producing the sounds which
    are perceived by the viewer. As PDP-1, MAC and PC interact, there could be the
    tek-tek-tek, just faster, like trreeehhhhhhhhhh produced by a dot matrix printer,
    which at some point produces the singularity that takes out or annihilate one
    of the elements of this experiment:\r\n\r\nPC"

  body: "[img:sites/default/files/old-images/3_4469.png]\r\n\r\nWell, \"if this make
    any sense\" is still to be determined by the imput-output\r\nPDP-1, MAC and PC
    may or may not generate.\r\nI would propose that the nuclear point or question
    is to determine what really happen to P* (PC) and for that I made a picture to
    depict the trajectory of\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PDP-1\">PDP-1</a>
    <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IMac\">MAC</a> <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_PC\">PC</a>\r\n\r\nI
    have to point out that the order of appearance starts with PDP-1 and somewhat
    influences the implosion / disappearance or annihilation of PC, which from that
    point on becomes only a mirage of itself, which, on a attempt to represent and
    also with great use of XXI Century instrumentation I was able to magnify, the
    exact moment of the event, which is now known as\r\n\r\nP*\r\n\r\nYet the image
    or depiction is still too dimmed as to say with certainty what is going to happen
    in the near future.\r\n\r\nNote: * I guess I shouldn't have used the word \"Experiment\"
    because the word in itself would cause \"chills\", and for that I ask you to look
    at the word \"Experiment\" as if it was/is only a group of letters and not as
    secondary or tertiary meanings.\r\n\r\nFew free to ad more questions or comments.
    Please, I just ask of you to think in terms of PDP-1 MAC P*(PC) as elements composed
    of characters, refraining from connections to facts e/or persons.\r\n\r\nps.:
    I used familiar colors as to keep it in a domestic perspective\r\n"

  body: "I notice that the visual manifestations of these various iconographies are
    mere shells of their connotative meanings. Each has a similar denotative meaning,
    that being a computational device meant to increase productivity, but as you mention
    above, the connotative meanings are greatly different.\r\n\r\nThis visual representation
    of reality is an interesting exploration of the postmodernist question of media;
    we see reality through various media, but reality in and of itself is a medium.
    The problem then becomes, what is \"real\" and what is real? How can we define
    reality, if we can never be sure what is real?\r\n\r\nThis brings us back to the
    idea of connotative and denotative meanings. In postmodernism, the denotative
    meaning of reality is void; we must rely on a connotative meaning. The problem
    with connotative definitions, however, is that each of us views reality from our
    own perspective and create our own connotative meanings, which are further distorted
    because of what we can call the \"frame of reference.\"\r\n\r\nWe then have to
    decide what we can define as absolute. Reality clearly is not; is truth? The answer
    is no; truth defines itself as the generally accepted happening. Truth and reality,
    then, are completely separate entities. But what about happening, or \"occurrence?\"
    We can agree that there is a such thing as absolute occurrence, though we may
    not agree upon that absolute.\r\n\r\nIn examining this enigmatic esoteric representation
    of a reality distinct from our own, we view it through different frames of reality.
    There is a visual element, but some instead may see (hear?) the auditory representation.
    The harsh consonant tones suggest a certain absoluteness and frankness in this
    expression, but then again almost nothing is absolute."
