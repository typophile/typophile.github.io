  body: "I found a number of similar typefaces; however, one of three characteristics
    was always different: 1) oversized, closed descender on the lc \"g\"; 2) open
    (rather than closed top of the lc \"o\"); or the 3) serif(s) on uc \"U\".\r\n\r\nI
    believe the most unique mark to help you identify this font would be to find the
    typeface with the same \"ss\" ligature. Of course, if it is not a ligature and
    the designer \"rubbed out\" part of the stroke on the second \"s\", my theory
    is pretty thin.\r\n\r\nWynne Hunkler\r\nPrincipal | <a href=\"http://www.wynnefields.com/\">Wynnefields

  body: hat was a photolettering face called Lilac Script, including one of the three
    alternate s's. I've never seen a digital version. Stephen's suggestion of Freehand
    575 - Bitstreams version of another photolettering face, Jefferson Script - is
    about as close as you are likely to get digitally.
