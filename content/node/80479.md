body: I know it's possible to make text look 3d using the standard red and blue glasses
  but is there anyway using this same method that you can make the text look bigger
  on the page. So you would look at it normally and it would be the size it appears
  and then when you put 3d glasses on it get bigger and also 3d

  body: "If you are doing the old-school anaglyphic 3d, with a cyan and magenta separation,
    then the answer is no. You can make the some elements in the picture look as if
    they are slightly in front of the page or screen, but it works better with elements
    that are receding into the background. However nothing will look bigger or smaller
    than it is in your original image.\r\n\r\nIs this the method you are wanting to
    use?\r\n\r\n"
