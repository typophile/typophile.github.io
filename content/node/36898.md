  by Sparks.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Metaphortest1_4383.jpg]\r\n\r\nSo
  it's pretty wonky and some characters need to be re-done totally I think - like
  the x and r. But I'd love some opinions.\r\n\r\nThanks!"

  body: I like it, but I'm not as big a fan of the reverse slope. I'm sure that that's
    an integral part of the design, however. What's your inspiration for the reverse
    slope? -- the only typefaces I've seen employ it are those made for cartography.

  body: "I <em>think</em> it might look sharp if the top of the left sides of the
    bowls had a tiny, tiny flare kickin' back to the left? I like 'e', it says \"Yo,
    my cred is streety.\" 't' and 'h' are nice, but at the resolution I'm looking
    at something feels slightly incongruent between them. I think its my screen.\r\n\r\nUpdate
    where this leads."

  body: "werd. I'll give it a try.\r\n\r\nAlso some of the angles are slightly off
    so it's probably not your screen."

  body: I think the 'x' needs to be flipped horizontally. It is basically leaning
    to the right now!
