  sure of the variation. Of course, I could be wrong about the DIN connection. Have

  body: "It seems to be '<a href=\"http://www.hubertjocham.de\" target=\"_blank\">September</a>',
    by Hubert Jocham. <em>( With an alternate 'g', though. 'September' was an exlusive,
    custom, corporate typeface for 'Details' magazine, until July '06, appparently.
    For me this would be the very first sighting of 'September', or its successor,
    thats not related to 'Details' mag. )</em>\r\n\r\nDav"

    I misunderstand the text.\r\n\r\nI do not think it is either Conduit or September,
    though both are very close. Thanks for your suggestions though.\r\n\r\nTim"
