body: "Hi all,\r\n\r\nI was looking at using Garamond for a project, but then I got
  so confused by the sheer amount of garamonds out there that I don't know which is
  the best one to use. I'm looking for a versatile version, that could also work when
  used in small sizes. What are the pros and cons of the different versions? \r\n\r\nAnother
  question related to this one is: which sans-serif font works well next to garamond?
  I'm doing a map related project, so possibly a font that can take a beating; by
  being used in small sizes and still be legible.\r\n\r\nI hope you can help me with
  this one!\r\n\r\nThanks, Jeffrey\r\n[[http://http://www.infraordinaire.com/wordpress|infraordinaire]]"

  body: "Jeffrey, this matter has been raised before in this forum - you can see a
    few links to Garamond related threads here: http://typophile.com/node/12481 (see
    bottom of page) - keep in mind that there have been dozens of different interpretations
    of Garamond typefaces.\r\n\r\nAs a personal taste, I'd go with Adobe Garamond
    Pro or Sabon Next, both well done and working digital typefaces.\r\n\r\nBut there
    can also be some interesting alternatives, like Epic http://www.typetrust.com/font/epic
    or Augereau http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/abramslegacy/augereau/\r\n\r\nBy the
    way, lists of Garamond-ish typefaces can be found here:\r\n\r\nhttp://new.myfonts.com/search/garamond/fonts/\r\n\r\nhttp://www.identifont.com/find?font=garamond&q=Go\r\n\r\nhttp://www.fontshop.com/search/?q=garamond&x=0&y=0\r\n\r\nA
    sans compatible with Garamond should be a Humanist Sans, I guess. Syntax is the
    first that comes to mind."

    at Arno Pro as well.\r\n\r\nJeffrey\r\n[[http://www.infraordinaire.com/wordpress|infraordinaire]]"

  body: Premier Pro has the caption optical size, so I'd probably go with that if
    you want authentic AND small. (Arno also has this, but it's really more Jenson
    inspired IMO)

  body: Dan is right. Arno is more of a Jenson. I should've mentioned that. *slaps

  body: "I have mixed feelings about Garamond Premier Pro. Yes, it has optical sizes,
    and yes, it is historically more accurate than Slimbach's previous Garamond (Premier
    also has a wide range of glyphs and languages). But I find it too delicate, with
    its very detailed strokes; Garamond Pro seems more \"strong\" on the page, if
    you know what I mean (pardon my lack of technical competence). What I like in
    Premier, instead, is its economy - compare Premier (abobe) with Pro (below), and
    see how the text block looks more tight in the first paragraph.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/garamond_adobe_5704.jpg]"

  body: "That's pretty impressive. But I guess I'm quite confused now; I like Premier
    being economincal, but it needs to be pretty sturdy as well. As Pro seems more
    strong on a page, this is a bit of a dilemma. I'll put it to the test.\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\nJeffrey\r\n[[http://www.infraordinaire.com/wordpress|infraordinaire]]"

  body: Jeffrey, that was just my opinion, of course - since we are talking about
    typefaces of the best technical and design quality, the choice is mostly related
    on everyon'e eye and taste. What I find "too delicate" in Premier may be a quality
    for someone else. And my avatar speaks for itself.
