  body: "Found [[http://www.sciarc.edu/images/inside.jpg|another sample]] but still
    can't find a match. Could be a bespoke typeface, loosely similar (except digits)
    to [[http://www.myfonts.com/search/compacta|Compacta]] or [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/helvetica/pro-ultra-compressed|Helvetica
    Ultra Compressed]].\r\n[[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/redrooster/block-gothic-rr|Block
    Gothic]] would be an interesting alternative."

  body: Block Gothic is a good choice for the look - it is also in the ballpark as
    far as a match

  body: "Thanks for the tips Ryuk!\r\n\r\nBelow is a closer look at part of the poster
    with big G, Q, M, and N which I think are very telling. Also, does anyone know
    the smaller typeface?\r\n\r\nhttp://i.imgur.com/b9eTZRv.jpg\r\n\r\nAgain, thanks
    for all the help!\r\n\r\n- Luca"

  body: "To me, that only confirms two things:\r\n- I really don't know any fonts
    with such /M and /N (which could be easily reproduced BTW)\r\n- Seeing now /Q,
    Block Gothic is definitely a fair alternative to what I'm now convinced is a bespoke
    typeface\r\nHard to tell for the smaller one, that could be a lot of fonts from
    Avenir to DIN...\r\n"
