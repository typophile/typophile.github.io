  body: "Wow. I'll go out on a limb and say that I believe this *is* Helvetica Bold.
    \r\nYes the \"G\" and \"I\" obviously differ; but if you look at \"AGAINST\",
    the bad spacing (too tight around the \"I\", too loose on the right side of \"G\")
    seems to indicate the changes to these two glyphs were added to the existing typeface
    without too much compensation. And the rest of this is just too much like Helvetica
    to my eyes to not be Helvetica. But of course I might be wrong.\r\n(There also
    is a bit of blurring/boldening, but that might be due to scanning &c.)\r\n\r\nDo
    you know how old the sample is?"

  body: Unfortunately, I don't know how old it is, but my guess is 20+ years. Here
    is a sample of the body type in the same font but with lower case characters as
    well. As you can see, the "a" is Futura-like. Any help would be appreciated.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/lex_3940.jpg]

  body: "Oh my! I thought it was just that one headline. \r\nThis does look different.
    It's reminiscent of AG Schoolbook (which might be just about the right age: 1983),
    but the \"I\" and \"l\" are different.\r\n\r\nLet's wait for the gurus to arrive\u2026
    sorry not to be of more help!"

  body: Hey, no problem. I appreciate the attention. I did notice that Helvetica Textbook
    looks pretty close (the G still is not right) but I need to match it if possible.
    I'll look forward to the gurus' input...
