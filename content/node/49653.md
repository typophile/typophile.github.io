  Italic]] makes for a good sans companion to [[http://typographica.org/001126.php|Arno
  Pro]] (also italic)? I actually think [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/itc/legacy-sans|Legacy
  Sans]] would be the perfect match, but it's not an option. I tried out several sans
  families and really liked the look of Delicious (no pun intended).\r\n\r\nAny and
  all opinions greatly appreciated."

    face that\u2019s been refined countless times whereas Delicious appears deliberately
    quirky in comparison. If you\u2019re only using Delicious in sizes and places
    where the degree of difference works in your favor you might be able to pull it
    off, but it seems like a stretch to me. \r\n\r\nBut WTF, right? Unless this is
    a really critical job go for it and let us know how it comes out."
