body: "Good afternoon (or morning/evening),\r\n\r\nI've recently been provided a partial
  logo which I'm attempting to identify the faces. I would like to identify both the
  letter forms and the numerals but I will take anything at this point After numerous
  attempts to request more information I am left to the wolves. If anyone has information
  that could be useful I'd love to identify these girls so I can move on to crafting
  some awesomeness.\r\n\r\nThe 's' is probably the best alpha form to use but the
  most distinct forms 7 & 1 and do not register on WTF, identifont or in any image
  search. \r\n\r\nSo far I've eliminated \r\n\r\nThanks in advance for any sort of
  help.\r\nMJ\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/781_6121.png]"
