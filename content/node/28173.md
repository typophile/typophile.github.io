body: "!Exclamachine Type Foundry releases a new disply font today. A horror/display
  typeface, <strong>!the troubles</strong> includes the basic ASCII character set,
  as well a proposed Irony Mark as a standard OpenType ligature. The narrow, deformed,
  broadly spaced letters adds an eerie vibe to any text. http://www.exclamachine.com\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/tt
  sampler small_4504.jpg]\r\nTo include the Irony Mark at the end of a sentence, simply
  type a tilde immediately after a period, before a space, in any OpenType aware application.
  (This mimics the I.M. convention of affixing a tilde to facetious statements.)\r\n"
