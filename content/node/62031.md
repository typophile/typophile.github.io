body: Can anyone identify this? It seems really familiar, like a Letraset or Typositor
  font from the 70s, but it's not exactly Chromium and Identifont doesn't have it.
  My intuition says it's named Hot Dog, but it isn't the Hot Dog that's out there
  now. [img:sites/default/files/old-images/SCN_hotdog_3867.jpg]

  body: Funny, that's the same thing I was thinking when I first saw your post - HotDog.
    Circle K used to use a HotDog font similar to this but not quite. Is there an
    older style of HotDog out there?

  body: Ay yi yi, yes, I was thinking Frankfurter. Hot Dog, Frankfurter...I wonder
    what it is? This client keeps bringing me old jobs to alter and god knows where
    they came from. Thanks for your help!

  body: It bears an uncanny resemblance to an old Letraset face called Pluto Outline.
    I don't know if it has been digitized...

  body: "The overall shape of Pluto Outline does look like the sample, for at least
    the letters shown, but the shading boundaries are different. Pluto Outline is
    shown in a couple of the Dan Solo books for Dover, including the Solotype Catalog,
    but I don't know of a digital version.\r\n\r\n - Mike Yanega"

  body: Interesting, all these fonts are close relatives, but don't have the same
    whipped cream kind of feel, they're more tech-y. I know I need to keep the look
    of this font, this client is very fussy about that. Luckily it is very geometric
    and the client doesn't have high production values. I used a scan and duplicated
    letters, and only needed one, K, which I made. Not the most typophilic solution,
    but it got it out the door! Thanks everybody for your knowledge, it helped me
    make a decision on what to do next!
