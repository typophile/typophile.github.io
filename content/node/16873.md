  Everet Thompson is the founder of the No Bodoni type foundry (I felt bad because
  I had no shoes until I met a man who had no Bodoni). His typefaces appear in \"Indie
  Fonts II,\" and among them are Isbellium, a sans serif version of Dick Isbell's
  Americana, Parma Typewriter, Nirvanium, and Tinman, his first attempt at an OpenType
  font. He teaches graphic design, design history, and typography at Columbia College
  Chicago where he is Associate Chair of Design Practices.\r\n\r\nWebsite: http://www.nobodoni.com"
