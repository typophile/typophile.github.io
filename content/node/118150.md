  body: "The sample is ridiculously small and low-res, but if I had to venture a guess,
    I'd say Avant Garde:\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/itc/avant-garde-gothic/\r\n\r\nFocus
    your image on a single panel of type, fill the frame with it, and that will make
    identification infinitely easier.\r\n"
