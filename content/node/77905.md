  to put together into a personal logo. Believe me! This is my seventh official attempt
  at constructing a cool identity. I sort of want to convey professionalism and perhaps
  invoke a little mythology (a little hydra/lochness monster comes otu of it) while
  at the same time having my initials (a) evolve into each other and (b) come together
  as a what some might call a typographical swash or like something you might find
  in Adobe's Wood Ornaments type.\r\n\r\nI'd love your artistic opinions on it--I
  know it's not done yet, but I don't know what it needs exactly. It is coming off
  a little bit messy. I'd love to hear what you have to say so I can finally finish
  it! I'm attaching a larger version. Thanks again in advance!\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://typophile.com/files/7_3.jpg\"

    point.

    how it looks like a bird with wings if you tilt your head a little bit, and I'm
    worried about complicating it if I separate the curves. What are you thinkin'?\r\n\r\n@Trevor
    Thanks for your comment. Any ideas on how to make the ''d' more prominent?"

    might prefer the 'root branch' look...

  body: Have you tried rotating it anti-clockwise a bit so your d is back-slanted
    (like script on old maps), your l is more upright and you have space on the right
    to put more of a curve into the lower half of your s.

  body: I think b reads better like a 'd' and 's', 'l' is kinda tricky. i might suggest
    smoothing out the inner curves on the bowl of the 'd'. what it look like if you
    rotated the whole piece another 10 degrees clockwise? looking good!

    have that somebody will pick out three different letters out of this, unprodded,
    are in vain.

  body: Perhaps you over-compensated the tilt in b .  To improve readability you could
    thicken the bowl of the d and perhaps close the gap of it's tip a bit more.  For
    the three top tips make the d's almost (but not quite) straight, the l's less
    so and keep the s's as is to have a progression of curvature.  And/or you can
    detatch the d from the set at the bottom making a small gap between it and the
    edge of a cursive capital L which remains joined to the s as it is now. That would
    need a flatter bottom curve of the L+s ligature.  I tried it it looks good that
    way.

  body: Thanks for all the comments, guys. I'll make the changes tomorrow. And just
    to clarify, @eliason, I think you bring up a good point. I don't think it's necessary
    that every initial is picked out, especially because I like it being a little
    cryptic and it will mainly be accompanied with my name below it--I just want to
    maximize legibility and clarity. :)
