  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Greetings. <BR> <BR>I have $100 budget and am looking to buy a font with as many ligatures as possible, old style figures, small caps, preferably with two or more ampersands. <BR> <BR>I have used Hoefler text &#40;available with some limitations on Macs&#41; and like it but find it a tad intense. I also can&#39;t afford its complete set. I am looking for something similar but less expensive. <BR> <BR>I have investigated Jannon Moderne at stormtype.com, but since it doesn&#39;t display a complete character set how can I tell if it has all the ligatures and other odds and ends that I want? <BR> <BR>I would also value tips on a good Greek font that would go well with this style of Latin font. <BR> <BR>Any help would be much appreciated. Thanks. <BR> <BR>Philip</div>

They are ligatures of the most commonly occuring letter sequences in a particular language, but letter frequency has nothing to do with linguistics. This is especially true for a language like English that employs etymological spelling and in which the same sequence of letters can represent multiple pronunciations. In order to make the claim that a font is linguistically aware, I think you would need to do a lot more than count letter pair frequency. For example, you would need to vary the form of ligatures for the same sequence of letters according to pronunciation, such that, for example, you would get different ligatures for the sequence &#60;g,h&#62; in &#39;ghetto&#39; and &#39;enough&#39;. Of course, this is not something that a font can do by itself without intervention either by a user or by a dictionary engine. <BR> <BR>In order for a font to be linguistically aware, it helps if the <i>writing system</i> is linguistically aware. The Latin script applied to the English language is almost entirely conventional, and largely blind to all aspects of linguistics except historical orthographics.</div>

The benefit of having ligatures that are based on frequency is simply that a typesetter is given more opportunities to apply ligatures! <BR> <BR>Now, if you mean that the typographic rendering of parts of a word should ideally depend on what the whole word is, then I most certainly agree - but yes, that would take some very heavy pre-processing and OT work to implement - and it doesn&#39;t mean Lingua&#39;s ligatures are NOT linguistically aware &#40;just less than the ideal&#41;. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR></div>

I&#39;m using terminology correctly and you are not. <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif" ALT=":-&#41;" BORDER=0> <BR> <BR>Many linguists -- probably the majority -- don&#39;t consider writing to be linguistic at all. Writing systems have a conventional, learned relationship to language&#40;s&#41;, that is in no way dependent upon features of language. This is why most linguists simply ignore writing. There is a small number of linguists who have developed an interest in writing, but they generally consider writing systems as independent subjects of study, not as part of linguistics. [The name for this area of study is grammatology &#40;although that term has also be co-opted by Derrida for a different purpose&#41;.] In short, there is no &#39;linguistics of the written word&#39;.</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><i>The ligatures in Lingua are useful largely because Olson based them on language.</i> <BR> <BR>No, he based them on <i>orthography</i>, i.e. the conventional spelling of a language in a particular script. Since all scripts are essentially language-independent -- English can be written in Hangul without much difficulty --, the determination of things like letter frequency must be understood as a function of orthography, not of language itself. <BR> <BR>This isn&#39;t a case of esoteric academic terminology: this is a sincere attempt to accurately describe the relationship of spoken and written language so that the latter can be meaningfully discussed. I agree with Coulmas that most linguists neglect writing too much, but neither he nor other grammatologists such as Daniels and Bright, would advocate the kind of careless terminology that you want to employ. I&#39;ve corresponded with Daniels, and he is <i>very</i> picky about terminology.</div>

This is another example of the confusion of script, language and orthography.
