  body: Can't identify it. Would like to know as well. Pretty convinced too it's a
    custom job based on some (recent) commercial brush script. The closest I have
    for the moment is [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/nikola-giacintova/rukola|Rukola]]
    using some stylistic alternates (/[[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/nikola-giacintova/rukola/regular/glyphs.html#glyphs/623986/577|F]],
    /[[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/nikola-giacintova/rukola/regular/glyphs.html#glyphs/623986/660|r]],
    /[[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/nikola-giacintova/rukola/regular/glyphs.html#glyphs/623986/614|d]]).
    [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/mika-melvas/signalist|Signalist]] is nice too.
    Still searching...

  body: "If you want a font with the tone of the lettering in Fitzgeralds, I can now
    recommend Suzee FY http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/fontyou/suzee-fy/ as being closer
    than any of the other suggestions. The _z_ and _g_ are quite different but the
    casual reader should accept Suzee FY as a continuation of the Fitzgeralds logo
    lettering.\r\nDon"
