body: "Howdy folks, new guy here. This is the first typeface I\u2019ve ever created
  and I\u2019ve been working on it for a few days now and I still have some work to
  do on it. It\u2019s all based on the grid you see in the background and all the
  angles are 45 degrees. I still need to adjust some of the widths of the characters
  and I\u2019m not loving the N, but overall I like the way it\u2019s coming out.
  I\u2019m just creating uppercase characters cause I eventually want to use this
  for big headlines and such. I also plan to do numbers and punctuation as well. Let
  me know what you guys think. Go easy on me...\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/typeface_6200.jpg]"

  body: "Welcome, new guy. It can be a quite tense experience just to throw a graphic
    up here. A'ight, I'll give it a go if everyone else is quiet. Some of my comments
    are guesses at what others might think, because thats sorta fun.\r\n\r\nLove the
    G.\r\n\r\nWith so many other symmetrical letters, not super hot on the Y. I might
    think otherwise if I saw it in action.\r\n\r\nHow closely are you planning the
    letters to sit? If they are too close it will make even headlined tough to read,
    but I think that A would look cool perfectly abutting its following glyph.\r\n\r\nThe
    B makes gridsense, but is probably unsettling to the locals with the suggested
    center-stroke being so low. I suspect the logic was to match the P & R, but if
    you want that purposely top-heavy vibe, bring it out in another letter or two
    as well, maybe? There is more room to play with \"inside the grid\" than you might
    first assume.\r\n\r\nThe chopped centers of M & W have some interesting potential.
    They fit well qith the uneven top-right of the V and the Bottom-right of the A.
    Perhaps you could snip the inside of the top-right corner of the W to a 45 degree?
    What I see here is not \"formal\", so play more and see what you get. What about
    moving the angled leg of the K up n' over a bit so it chops off like the A?\r\n\r\nThe
    O is adequate and logical. The Q, however, is very cool, and requires that the
    O look exactly like you have it.\r\n\r\nIf you aren't down with the N, maybe it
    could get a right triangle lopped off on the inside of the left top. That would
    make it look like  the W if that approach worked there, and would yet strangely
    reinforce the most striking aspect of the letter.\r\n\r\nHide the grid for screenshots
    unless you need it to illustrate something particular, and I think people will
    be less distracted.\r\n\r\nTwo more suggestions. Throw a word or two up for analysis,
    like, \"hotdoggievons,\" or, \"free beer with font.\" Then people can <em>see</em>
    the flow better. And if you think you <strong>might ever</strong> want a numeral
    or punctuation, start visualizing it now. (edit: I mean start actually drawing
    it alongside the letters, so that they can borrow from each other, synergize,
    or whatever one might call it.)\r\n\r\nOh yeah, last of all, before you take any
    of my advice seriously, you should probably search what sort of fonts I make.
    Guess that goes for others, too."

  body: "Choz, thanks for the feedback, it is very very helpful. You make some very
    excellent points that I'm definitely going to consider.\r\n\r\nI see what you
    mean about the Y and I will definitely try a version that is symmetrical. The
    reason I did the Y this way was because I saw an opportunity to create and not
    so traditional character that played off of the angles of the A, V and K. It's
    actually a K flipped and the top arm removed (I still don't have my type terminology
    down). \r\n\r\nI do have to see how the letters work with each other in a word
    and that's the next thing I'm going to try out. Not sure yet how closely the letter
    will sit but your idea with the A is very interesting. Should create some very
    interesting shapes.\r\n\r\nThe B is starting to not feel right and yes the initial
    idea was to match it to the P and the R. I'm going to play with it some more I
    just feel that if I do change it and its not working with the P and the R that
    it won't be consistent.\r\n\r\nI have considered bringing more of the chopped
    feel into it but if I do adjust the K it will throw off the R as well. That's
    something I'm going to play with a little more.\r\n\r\nI have some ideas in my
    head based on your suggestion for the N that I'm going to play with and see how
    they come out.\r\n\r\nThanks again for the feedback, it was very helpful and gave
    me some new ways to approach the typeface. I'm going to make some more adjustments
    and post again."

  body: "Ok so I worked on it some more today and I think I have all the characters
    down. I've adjusted the N, X, B, K, Y and Z. I also decided to use two versions
    of the A and V and 3 versions on the Y. When I create the actual FONT I want to
    build it so that it figures out which combnations of letters to use to make they
    work best together. I know this is possible cause I've seen multiple fonts do
    this but I'm not exactly sure how to create that. Anyone?\r\n\r\n\r\nI've arrange
    some words out to see how the letters play with each other and you will notice
    the use of the different A's, V's and Y's. Actually I just noticed that the A
    in the word Magic is the wrong direction.\r\n\r\nAnyways, I still need to create
    the numbers which will be my next step and I have started on some of the punctuations.
    I want to create as many as I can to make it as complete as possible.\r\n\r\nLet
    me know what you guys think.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/typeface_4167.jpg]"

  body: "Seeing it used helps me get an idea about your intent. Is this meant to be
    good for posters where the idea is to catch the eye with a 'mistake' that can
    be interpreted correctly?\r\n\r\nI think your M is oddly enough working already.
    Whereas the V is not at all. The K is working. I think you should consider making
    more weird versions of the semi normal ones and some more normal versions of the
    weird ones. And just explore more. Like Choz said there are way way more solutions
    out there. Also, other folks have made a ton of fonts like this. Look at what
    they did. See if you can justify the existance of this font with a novel solution/letter-shape
    or overall feeling."

  body: "Seeing text really makes a difference in this one, since the charm is largely
    in the interaction, I think. The tight spacing is compelling in the AY. The mirrored
    variants are a great idea. That is the kind of thing I would have stumbled across
    back in the day, and happily agonized over which to choose in a banner or masthead.
    \ Are those going to fill up some of the free area in the lowercase zone? (Of
    course, there's 3 Ys, oh no) :)\r\n\r\nI do have to note that the \\| version
    of the V reads a bit like a minimalist N when I go fast.\r\n\r\nStupid question,
    perhaps, but, uh, why don't the A's have blacked-out counters?"

    body: "Choz,\r\n\r\nThe A counter isn't blacked out for 2 reasons.\r\n\r\n1. I
      tried it out blacked out and the letter just didn't read well. The character
      had more \"character\" with the counter.\r\n\r\n2. If you notice all the blacked
      out counters are all curved ones.\r\n\r\nI do see what you mean about the \\|
      version but this typeface is intended to be used very large and for big blocks
      of copy. Not meant to be used in a big copy block so I think even though it
      might be confused with an N at first, that the viewer will pick up that its
      a V.\r\n\r\nWhat do you mean by the free area in the lowercase zone?"

  body: Especially for posters you might want to think about not just designing extra
    versions of each letter but also pairs & tripples. Then you can make the oddness/interestingness
    of the relationships work much more completely. Then you could have for instance
    a special AV pair where the leggs go past each other. Or a Ligature. Or both.

    on the thin version? I couldn't decide what to do since in theory those characters
    would remain the same since the counters are blacked out. But it does make those
    characters look heavier so maybe for I would make them normal.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/typeface_3946.jpg]"

      them in the future. Right now I just want to get a working font together.\r\n\r\nOr
      I can just do a Alternative version kind of like Avant Garde and use those other

    I was thinking like you that additional fonts with alts up to an including ligatures
