  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">On a scale that looks like this where I have decided that the regular is on -100, how would you divide the interim weights so it follows some kind of optical scale? Is there a optical scale for that matter?

Please dont tell me to have a look at Luc(as) de Groot's Interpolation Theory, because I dont understand it at all.

I want to place five weights on this scale and place the regular on -100 and before that a light weight and I am not very good at maths :-(

-500  
-400  
-300  
-200  
-100  Regular
0     
100   
200   
300   
400   
500   
600   
700   
800   
900   
1000  
1100  
1200  
1300  
1400  
1500  


These are the stems of a capital I -500 and 1500.

Anyone?

		<div class="commentbody">Goran, de Groot's theory of the ratio between stems is not rocket science. Its basic idea is that each weight should be multiplied by the same number to get the next weight. Thus if your light I is 50 wide, and your heavy weight is 450, then one intermediate weight should be 150. That is because 3 x 50 = 150 and 3 x 150 = 450. 

Another way of saying this is that the weights should be in a geometric progression, with a common factor that multiplies each weight to get the next one.  Eg: 50, 150, 450, 1350, etc., where 3 is the common factor. De Groot's formulas give you a way to caculate n intermediate weights, given the extremes. But if you are uncomfortable with algebra, you can just find the common factor just by guessing and seeing whether that number works by doing the arithmetic, then adjusting it bigger or smaller--trial and error. In my example you would get to 3 pretty quickly just by guessing and seeing what is too much and too little for the common factor. 

All that being said, another way is to figure out what you want to use these for, and then test them in those usages. After all, in the end the usage is the most important thing. 

For example, James Montalbano said something like this, if I remember rightly: If you have made a regular weight you like, then make the medium weight something that can substitute for the regular in reversed text--white on black. Then make your 'light' so that the medium works as a 'bold' relative to the light. And of course the actual "bold" should look good with the regular. That gives you four weights.   </div>

		<div class="commentbody">While it might look impressive on a specimen sheet, the neat visual effect of having a continuous smooth progression of weights at the same ratio is not as important as the function each weight must achieve. Think about what each weight is for (relative to your particular typeface) and space the weights according to best function.

		<div class="commentbody">Another way to define your progression of weights without any math would be to construct it. Below is what I mean. On top is your thinest weight. On bottom is your heaviest weight. They are separated by 4 units in the example but you can use any number of units depending on the number of weights you desire. The unit can be anything convenient, picas, mm, inches, whatever. 
On the lift I have drawn a simple straight diagonal line from the width ends of your 2 stems. Where they intersect the measured units is the stroke width of the intervals.
On the right, I have drawn a curve instead of a straight line. This will force the progression of weights to increase more as it reaches the bolder weight. You can use any regular curve depending on how much you want to skew the weight intervals.

		<div class="commentbody">To carry this one step further and give you numbers, I have added your scale and found the value -100 (in green) and then put it on a 3rd curve at right where the curve is adjusted to where the first of the 4 divisions falls on the -100 length. With the curve now fixed, I took the 2 line segments which struck the 2 yet undetermined values (see blue lines) and measured them on your scale and noted the corresponding values. They turned out to be 345 and 836. This will give you an even progression with -100 as the 2nd unit as regular, the medium as 345, and the bold as 836 to go with your pre-existing extreme values of -500 and 1500 for light and extrabold respectively. There was no math involved, only measuring.

		<div class="commentbody">You'll need to determine what the lightest and heaviest weights are that your design can handle, and then think about the spacing of those weights.

Chris' comments about function determining your decisions is a sound one. Do you see these fonts being used as coordinated weights? If so, for all members, or just between, say, a regular and a bold? If so, you'll need to fine tune those weight relationships just like you went through a bunch of work to determine the ideal "regular" weight. (BTW, if you haven't reconsidered that, it's worth actively thinking about whether you have the right value for "regular.")

		<div class="commentbody">I think the spacing is OK, the light has a whole lot more space between the letters than the heaviest one, which is rather tight at the moment.

I think I want them all to be coordinated, at least visually. I am making light, regular, medium, bold and black (or some other name for this last thick one)

What do you mean with right value for regular? The stem thickness? Isn't that different for different fonts? I mean, some fonts are heavier than other by nature, are they not?

Acually, stem thickness is even different in the same font at different sizes, in some fonts... :-o 
Which is one way of saying that 'optical weights' are different from what I think you are doing here.
Dez's excellent illuatrations give some hint to this, with his display of linear and non-linear paths between your light to black.
