  -- not print / graphic, so I know I need your help.  I appreciate the help some
  of you gave me in making my web co. logo in the past.\r\n\r\nI am at the very beginning
  and have just made some sketch concepts - concepts only!\r\n\r\nThe logo is for
  a business for medical professionals involved in real estate transactions.  A good
  friend of mine asked me to create the logo as quickly as I can, and I keep getting
  stuck at the very beginning with how to incorporate the stethoscope with the house.
  \ Those are the two things the company wants included on the logo, placing the steth
  on the house.  I know the stethoscopes look bad - I just freehanded it fast.\r\n\r\nThe
  stethoscope is supposed to read \"y\"  Do you see that or have to look for it?\r\n\r\nI
  also considered not using caps, but I feel that it needs to be stronger because
  it is a real estate company.  Any tips for typeface?\r\n\r\nThank you for your help
  and time.\r\n\r\n[[http://www.pococreative.com/tests/mikki/Picture%2012.png]]"

  body: "\"medical professionals involved in real estate transactions\"\r\nThat sounds
    like an unusual business :)\r\n\r\n\r\n\"The stethoscope is supposed to read \u201Cy\u201D
    Do you see that or have to look for it?\"\r\nI got the 'y' readily. If you hadn't
    written it, the stethoscope may have been harder. But once you draw it better,
    I guess that shouldn't be a problem. And anyway, you'd get it by association.\r\n\r\nOf
    the two options, I prefer the one on the left where the profile of the home is
    more simple. Why not try an option where the two words, Healthy and Realty are
    stacked - in such a way that you have the stethoscope making a common 'y'?\r\n\r\nAs
    for typeface, I'd definitely go for something less neutral. Do see if [[http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/fontfont/ff_speak_ot|FF
    Speak]] works for you. The lines of the font may cue a way to draw the steth.\r\n\r\nYou
    may also want to look at replacing all-caps with title case. \r\n"

  body: "The other idea I'm considering now based on the suggestion of having two
    lines (but my friend wants the stethoscope to only act as the lower \"y\" in \"realty,\"
    not  on the word \"healthy.\"  This is still a rough concept sketch.\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/healthyrealty3small_6142.png]\r\n\r\nAlso,
    this logo will be used primarily for yard signs, but also business cards, flyers,
    other branding, etc.  Should a 1200 px wide, 360+dpi .png image be sufficient
    for most printing companies, or will I need to start over and make this as a .bmp
    or .svg?  Thanks for your help."

    I'm not sure you really need to draw the house so literally. Probably just the
    roof profile, as you had done earlier, would be sufficient. \r\n\r\n\"but my friend
    wants the stethoscope to only act as the lower \u201Cy\u201D\"\r\nI'm sure you're
    friend was just giving a suggestion to get you going, and would be  quite okay
    if the idea evolves a little, as long as it addresses the client brief. Here it
    looks as if it is. \r\n\r\n\"Should a 1200 px wide, 360+dpi .png image be sufficient...\"\r\nIf
    it's anything other than an on-screen application, you'd be better off creating
    it in vector so that it can be scaled to whatever size. That means drawing it
    in a program like Illustrator, Freehand, Corel Draw etc. If you need an on-screen
    version, you can always create a jpeg/bmp from that.  "

    the top text? It looks off since the letters are identical.
