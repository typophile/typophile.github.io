body: hello. i've been working on this logo for a while, but i'm having some trouble
  with the kerning. the spacing for the first half (TRI) and the last half (CIFIC)
  doesn't seem to be very balanced...or maybe i've just been looking at this for too
  long. any suggestions?

    the kerning bet/n  IC, CI and IC.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/logo11_4578.jpg]"

  body: "Like it. Satya's probably right, especially about the IC combo. Maybe the
    FI is loose too. Then I would tighten the whole thing up.\r\n\r\nEverything in
    me wants to cut the upper serifs off the T. They are distracting. Maybe you could
    also use the green arc shape in the logotype on the right too. \r\n\r\n(Sorry,
    you only asked about the kerning!)[img:sites/default/files/old-images/tricific_5172.png]\r\n\r\nI
    also dropped the type down to the baseline since the visual device on the left
    forms such a strong point of origin, it made sense to me. "
