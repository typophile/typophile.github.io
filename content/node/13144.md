body: "Hello!\r\n\r\nI'm trying to create some lettering for a logotype. I didn't
  <em>art direct</em> this, so the concept isn't at all mine - I'm just an intern
  trying to create something \"from scratch\" that will stop my superiors from simply
  typing the word in a font they like, converting it to curves and saying \"that's
  it!\" (and don't even get me started on the name itself).\r\n<!--break-->\r\nIn
  any case, it's supposed to say \"19th century\"(very vague I know) so I went for
  a late 19th century art nouveau feel.\r\n\r\nI'm looking mostly for advice on letterforms
  and spacing, and maybe pointings to historical references. As I said, the direction/concept
  isn't mine and I can't really change it.\r\n\r\nI've included three variations for
  comparison. Top one includes a \"ligature\" that in my opinion looks nice but I
  fear it may be too hard to read.\r\nI like the middle one better but the space in
  TA and AL seems too uneven; I tried spacing everything to see if it got better (bottom)
  but it didn't, really. Plus the letterspaced version looks weaker. \r\n\r\nOkay,
  I've said too much already, thanks for any advice or comments ;)"

  body: "In my opinion the LL ligature is not only hard to read; it creates a strong
    imbalance between the \"black\" and the \"white\". A better alternative for a
    LL ligature is to \"stack\" one \"L\" into the other.\r\nOut of the three variations
    the middle one is the best. But the spacing does look uneven; try to positively
    track the TA pair. The space between \"T\" and \"A\" should be slightly larger
    than the space between \"A\" and \"L\", because of the horizontal stroke on \"T\".
    And finally, the \"S\" needs work; the curves are too irregular."

  body: "Eduardo, <em>obrigado pelos coment\xE1rios!</em>\r\n\r\nTimd, I agree that
    it isn't very Art Nouveau, but that's not my intention. It's more of an influence
    than an attempt to recreate that period's style. \r\n\r\nThe faces on your link
    may be more historically accurate, but they're too \"caricaturized\" for what
    I need. Thanks for the link, though, has some nice examples."

  body: "If you intend to perservere with your design, I recommend the spacing in
    the third option, but you will need to work on the S start with a more symmetrical
    shape and develop the smaller top from that and work on the modulation of the
    stroke. I think that as a logotype it needs something to pull it together to stop
    it looking like a word, you have a strong shape in the bar of the A, the style
    of the 19th century would be reinforced by something enclosing the whole or the
    kind of gradation that an engraver would produce.\r\nTim"

  body: "Tim, thanks for your input. I should have been more careful with my words
    - it's not really a logotype in the normal sense of the word; it's a product name
    to be applied on packaging. So I'm hoping it'll gain a lot of strenght from the
    context. The good thing of analyzing it out of such context, I suppose, is that
    it has to stand by itself and be good just like that.\r\nAnd you're right that
    it needs something to make it more of an image and less of a word. Again, thanks.
    When I have something relevant I'll post a link here (I still have to show it
    to my boss to see I should keep going or not!) :)"
