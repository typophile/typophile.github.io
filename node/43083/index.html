<div class="post-content e-content" itemprop=articleBody>Hey,
Working on a new id marque for a client. The concept has been approved – so I'm just refining it now and would be good to get some advice from the masters among you!
As you can see from the original plain typeface, the letters 'a' and 'h' don't sit together that well:
[img:sites/default/files/old-images/ah_original_small_5315.png]
So what I've tried to do is combine the 'a' and 'h' with a ligature to make a more unified and unique marque, and allow the kerning to be much tighter. I'll be using this at quite large sizes so I've also reduced the ellipses and the spacing in general:
[img:sites/default/files/old-images/ah_modified_small_6528.png]
I think the ligature is working – but I'm not 100% happy with it. It seems a shame to lose the character you get from that little flick on the 'a'. So it would be good to get your thoughts about if this is the best way I could join them, or any other ways you think this could be improved?
Best Regards,
Ed

<div class=commentbody>I think in the second instance the two characters are way too close in relation to the counters. There is no reason for ligatures here!

<div class=commentbody>i concur with diedrik, however, if you are linking stuff, then you could go for more of a flowing approach...

<div class=commentbody>You could also reduce the size of the lower left serifs on both legs of the h ( a popular modeling style for serifs now anyway) to make the a & h fit together. I think your lig is okay too - it could be opened up slightly - but the ellipses need to come closer to the ah.</div>

<div class=commentbody>thanks everybody some great suggestions there I'll give it a go and post up some new versions.
Especially like the single stroke idea. I know there's no 'need' for a ligature but it just feels clumsy otherwise. Unless I can edit the serifs like Eben suggests. And I agree – the space between the characters is definitely bit too close at the moment…

<div class=commentbody>Ok here's the latest version.
I tried the flowing approach but I think it's a bit too much for this one. I just need to make them sit together well and it needs to be almost invisible/discreet.
So I've just been working on opening it up a bit and reducing the size of all the left side serifs.
And I also decided to mirror the way the horizontal of the h meets the stem (that slightly strange - but interesting taper) with the lower part of the a (circled in blue).

The second file here is a slightly odd idea. I don't know what I think of it yet but it's interesting. Still have to try losing the lig and just tweaking serifs...
all comments appreciated!

<div class=commentbody>I think the 2nd one reads better, but both of them are good now. I will be interested to see how you fare with the serifs. And idea - what if the dots got progressively smaller?</div>

<div class=commentbody>The second one in your last set definitely looks the best . I would maybe place the ellipsis ever so slightly more to the right of the h.

<div class=commentbody>Right, thanks for comments – think it's getting there now.
Here it is with the serifs tweaked and no ligature (let's call this A):
[img:sites/default/files/old-images/ah_modified_14March_2_4444.png]
And here's the second one in the previous set with updated ellipses (B):
[img:sites/default/files/old-images/ah_modified_14March_3_5553.png]
And finally, a new sort of hybrid that's a bit more flowing (C):
[img:sites/default/files/old-images/ah_modified_14March_4649.png]
Interesting idea with the dots getting smaller Eben – but I've tried it and I don't think it's quite right. Possibly just a bit too much.
Thanks everybody for comments and help – let me know which one you prefer and I'll be sure to post up results when this gets printed.

<div class=commentbody>A works best for me. That is exactly what I meant. The dots are getting too small to me though. They are starting to feel like an afterthought, but they are not. Quite the opposite. Take them away & the meaning changes too much. That part will be tough.
You could work more on the lig still if you wanted to by maybe tucking in the serif a tiny bit more - but that's not the weakest link anymore in my opinion.</div>
