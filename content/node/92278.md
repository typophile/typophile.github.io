body: "I'm currently toying with the idea of generating glyph outlines to create a
  font family in a parametric way.  Right now, as a test, I have a program that defines
  the shapes of the 26 latin characters both lc and uc (and smcp, not shown), using
  various parameters such as character widths, x/cap/asce/desc hights, nominal horizontal/vertical
  stroke widths, etc.  Attached is the result of nine fonts with varying weight which
  in turn defines stroke widths and \"squareness\".  Most other things can be changed,
  too, the only thing fixed is the fundamental composition of each glyph (\"b\" is
  conceptually a vertical stroke with an uneven ellipse; this kind of things are,
  I guess, the design element).  Ultimately, I want a set of programs defining a font
  such that by tuning some parameters, varying but consistent set of fonts can be
  created without further human intervention.\r\n\r\nNow, the result is obviously
  not perfect, and I meant to as for suggestions here. But lacking any formal training
  in typography, I'm not sure <em>what</em> to ask.  I'll start with broad ones:\r\n1.
  Has anyone tried this sort of algorithmic approach before? (Donald Knuth obviously
  has, but I'm not a big fan of the resulting Computer Modern family; MetaFont is
  also a pretty horrible language to program in.) Is it feasible to some extent?\r\n2.
  As far as the example image goes, what are the things I did completely wrong, from
  a designer's point of view?\r\n\r\n[Edit: added a pdf.  You can probably extract
  the fonts from it with the right tools.]\r\n[Edit2: updated pdf]"

    body: "MMM as I understand, has a number of axes, each representing a continuously
      variable parameter, with a (hand-crafted) font sitting at either end of each
      axis, and the font engine interpolates in between these fonts.  I have a small
      program defining glyph outlines for each char, which in theory can do much more
      than interpolation: whatever the underlying programming language (Perl here)
      can do, can be done.\r\n\r\nMMM to me seem to have two important limitations:
      1) I can't see how interpolation can give enough control to finer shape changes;
      2) Correct me if I'm wrong, but if you have N parameters, MMM requires 2^N predefined
      glyph sets to work with, so if you have say 6 parameters, you'd need to make
      64 fonts by hand, which rather defeats the point of letting computers do all
      the work."

  body: "I've read all of the linked threads above (I've read pretty much the whole
    design board before I registered).  They are no doubt interesting topics, though
    my problem is not in math, but rather in design: I can have a program draw anything,
    <em>if I know what I want to draw</em>.\r\n\r\nMy code is heavily experimental,
    and is no more readable than a good MetaPost or MetaFont.  Here's the function
    responsible for drawing \"O\", \"o\" and \"Osmall\" (and will be called by say,
    \"Oslash\"):\r\n<pre>sub shape_o {\r\n\tmy $w = round(shift());\r\n\tmy $h = shift;\r\n\tmy
    $cap = shift // 0;\r\n\r\n\tset_brush(0, $cap);\r\n\t$hw = round($hw);\r\n\t$vw
    = round($vw);\r\n\r\n\tmy ($x0, $x1) = set_stroke(0, $w, $vw + $thicken, $bearing_bow);\r\n\tmy
    ($x2, $x3) = set_stroke(0, $w, $vw + $thicken, $w - $bearing_bow);\r\n\r\n\tmy
    $cx = round(($x1 + $x2) / 2);\r\n\tmy $cy = round($h / 2);\r\n\r\n\tpath\t->ellipse($cx,
    $cy, $cx - $x0, $h/2 + $os, $rout)\r\n\t\t->ellipse($cx, $cy, $x1 - $cx, $h/2
    + $os - $hw, $rin),\r\n\t$w,\r\n\thhint=>[-$os, -$os + $hw, $h + $os - $hw, $h
    + $os],\r\n\tvhint=>[$x0, $x1, $x2, $x3],\r\n\taaanchor=>[round($w/2), $h]\r\n}</pre>\r\n\r\n$w,
    $h and $cap are passed in params specifying glyph width, glyph height and whether
    it's a capital letter (capitals have slightly wider v-strokes than lc or smcp).
    \ <code>set_brush</code> sets nominal h- and v-stroke widths ($hw and $vw); <code>set_stroke</code>
    sets the positions of the left and right arcs.  Here $bearing_bow is a family-wide
    parameter, saying how far a bow-shaped stroke should be from the edge of the glyph,
    though the stroke actually straddles this position, so the actual bearings will
    be smaller than this nominal value, more so for heavier weights, in order that
    heavy weights will have smaller white spaces both between chars and inside each
    char.\r\n\r\n<code>path->ellipse(...)</code> creates a path with a psuedo elliptical
    shape given center x, center y, radius x and radius y, plus two optional \"roundness\"
    factors.  The result is a true ellipse if the roundness is <code>4/3 (sqrt(2)-1)</code>,
    but currently I'm using slightly larger values to make bows more squarish.\r\n\r\nThe
    function returns a list of things: the path consisting of two \"ellipses\" of
    opposite winding; the glyph width which includes left and right bearing; hori/vert
    hints ($os is the vertical overshoot); anchor point of typical accent-above.  The
    last one is going to be used for attaching accute, grave, etc., though right now
    only \"i\" and \"j\" use them (the \"i\" is really a composite of \"dotlessi\"
    plus \"dotaccent\").  This function is called by a master builder program when
    needed, and returned values are put into a list, later written out to a .sfd file
    (FontForge format), so I can either open it to have a look, or convert it to .otf
    via command line.\r\n\r\nI can make the whole system work, because I wrote every
    piece of code involved in defining the glyphs; it would be nice if I could make
    it more usable for anyone else, but for that I need to know if what I do makes
    sense (cf. lack of typographic training).  Right now I'd really appreciate it
    if someone can tell me stuff like \"your uppercase letters needs more white space
    on either side\" or \"your 'X' is too thin on the right leaning stroke\";  the
    only thing obvious to me is the fonts should be kerned, but I'd rather get the
    natural spacing of each character right before doing that.\r\n\r\n[EDIT: tag leak]"

    the arches join to the stems. The lowercase Black \"u\" is a good example here;
    there is too much ink in it. In other words - you change modulation of serifs
    extremally, while the arches stay pasive.\r\n\r\nAnyway, the uppercase Black R

    Your program snippet \"sub shape_o\" is not much different to METAFONT coding.
    Writing macros in METAFONT is a bit unusual compared to other programming languages,
    but letter shapes can be defined quite elegant.\r\n\r\nHave you ever tried to
    outline glyphs in the following way:\r\n\r\nMETAFONT code (whitout any pens) -->
    processed by METAPOST --> Glyphs written to EPS --> EPS imported to a sfd-file
    by python-fontforge --> postprocessing with python-fontforge or fontforge\r\n\r\nThis
    is a reliable way. Of course you can easily improve it (eg by reading in the tfm
    file too). \r\n\r\nPlease think of the fact, that Knuth has been working hard
    on METAFONT for about 5 years. He has learned much and also documented his mistakes
    (especially when making the jump from METAFONT79 to METAFONT84). Take a look at
    them to avoid falling in the same pits. METAFONT is not perfect and it is old
    but it is easily extensible by macros and it has uptodate successor: METAPOST
    (which can handle METAFONT code).\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nYour font is onedimensional
    at the moment (weight axis). If you would like to add more axis (such as slant
    or optical size or condensedness axis): Do it now! You will have to consider much
    more things for your letter constructions.\r\n\r\nOne simple tip for your letter
    constructions: \r\nI assume your legs (at the k or R) are defined the following
    way:\r\n1. Definition of the middle path of the leg\r\n2. Expanding the path to
    a stroke\r\nHence, the legs are to close to the vertical stems for bold style.
    You could do instead something like \r\n1. Definition of the left outlining path
    of the leg\r\n2. Expanding the path to a stroke\r\n\r\nIn short: Many paths are
    probably expanded from the wrong points on.\r\n\r\n------------------\r\n\r\nOkay,
    now some compliments:\r\n\r\nYour zerodimensional font (whithout weight axis expansion,
    e. g. medium style) already looks quite good and I suppose this was hard to program.\r\n\r\nDetails
    like serifs and endings look quite interesting.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nI hope this
    helps a bit..."
