body: In the processing of rehabing this sign that marks the infamous WRECK bar in
  Lake Elsinore, CA. The sign has been here since the early 1960's and pretty much
  matches the decor of the bar (which has also been the same since the 1960's....
  I think there are customers who have been in here since the 1960's!..). Would like
  to see if matching font could be found to use in further fundraising media to go
  towards work being attempted in creating a mural on the facade and sides of the
  building depicting scenes of the historic Elsinore Grand Prix Motocycle Race (see
  the film "On Any Sunday") Thanks for any help or clues!
