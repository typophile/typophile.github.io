  anyone know of similar fonts? Same feel. \r\n\r\nAny help is much appreciated.\r\n\r\nThanks"

  body: There really isn't a lot that looks like Kursivschrift. It was created for
    film typesetters and emulated the lettering styles of traditional mapmakers. Can
    you tell us more about what you don't like about Kursivschrift? That might help
    us suggest types in the right direction.

  body: The new magazine <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/stewf/sets/72157594159206925/"><em>Blueprint</em></a>
    uses Kursivschrift alongside <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/singles/itc/fling/">Fling</a>,
    which could be considered compatible, but almost too similar.

  body: I think Oxtail is the one I was looking for. It's not a question of not liking.
    I was looking for a similar feel for a project. I felt that Kursivschrift was
    a bit too "strong" for the project (which is actually for an all female institution*
    was looking for something feminine). I've seen it used in Blueprint, which was
    what piqued my interest. Thanks very much for the help though:D

    Neo]]. The italic is especially nice.\r\n\r\nI think the v in Kursivschrift looks
    like a p without a descender."

  body: Ah..yes..the italic is not bad. I guess the thing with Kursivschrift is that
    it needs to be used sparingly..it's definitely not something you can use all over...

  body: Recently I saw a couple of examples of mid 20th Century Danish maps that used
    backwards leaning letters for names of bodies of water, like the backwards leaning
    versions of Kursivschrift and Roemisch. Modern Danish maps that I've seen haven't
    used this convention. Does it come from Germany? Does anyone know something of
    its history? Has it ever been in regular use on English language maps?
