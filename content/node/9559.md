body: this is a small image from a previous version of US packaging items for McDonalds,
  featuring an intriguing script, and I challenge myself into hoping it&#39;s not
  custom lettering. Any chance such a font might be out ther somewhere? <BR> <BR><img

  body: My vote is custom, as most franchise logos are, and especially since the &#34;d&#34;
    attaches to the &#34;s&#34; regardless of the apostrophe between them.. but the
    first thing that came to my mind was <a href="http://fontdiner.com/menu_vegas.html"
