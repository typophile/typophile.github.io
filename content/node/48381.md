  the company name in a circle.\r\n\r\nHas anyone found a way to decently arc text?
  I've used the \"Type on a path\" tool in Illustrator, but the text always looks
  off to me - either the letterforms start blending together, or the kerning is a
  nightmare.\r\n\r\nHere's another company's example of what I'm trying to do (not
  mine): <a href=\"http://www.yellowcabchicago.com/images/logo.gif\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.yellowcabchicago.com/images/logo.gif</a>\r\n"

  body: I know that Leslie Cabarga's <a href=http://www.logofontandlettering.com/>Logo,
    Font, and Lettering Bible</a> details this (and other similar techniques) explicitly
    (without using Type on a Path), though I don't know how much detail he goes into
    on kerning it properly.

  body: Read your Visual Quickstart for Illustrator book (Peachpit Press) This is
    an easy and standard skill in Illustrator once you start to understand it. We
    used to use a program called Adobe Type Align but all of that was folded into
    Illustrator as was Adobe Streamline ( the tracing program). TypeStyler is another
    program that does this but has been in a holding pattern for a number of years.

  body: "Thanks, <strong>auricfuzz</strong> and <strong>bojev</strong>.\r\n\r\nI've
    used this technique before, but it's not a favourite - it might just be my eyes,
    but it never looks right to me.\r\n\r\nI remember using Streamline <em>many</em>
    years ago. I also remember the copy I had always wanted to crash, usually during
    a save."
