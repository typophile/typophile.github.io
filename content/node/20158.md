  several owners and designers of online scrapbook consignment stores were discussing
  piracy. They are angry and frustrated with the piracy of their products.\r\n\r\nHowever,
  during this same discussion, the owners of a leading online store stated that they
  could use any font as part of their digital products- papers, icons, elements, lettering,
  word art, etc. without fear of violating copyright laws. Their reasonig is this:
  \ Fonts are mechanical devices, and therefore cannot be protected by copyright.
  They suggested that fonts require a patent in order to protect them from illegal
  use, such as file sharing, commercial use, etc.\r\n\r\nAs a graphic designer in
  the digital scrapbook and clip art industry, I am very concerned about the issue
  of copyrights, trademarks and patents and how they apply to fonts, true type fonts,
  typography and type faces.  Fonts and type faces are used frequently in the design
  of scrapbook papers, elements, ribbons, etc.\r\n\r\nAny insight on this subject
  would be greatly appreciated."

  body: The STOP PIRACY blog really should be seen as a bright spot. Being in Utah
    I am quite literally surrounded by scrapbook companies and quite a few of my friends
    from school have worked with them. I've heard good and bad stories about respect
    for fonts. I hope more scrapbookers come to respect fonts and wish success to
    Jenjen's blog.

    body: "\r\n\r\nHi-\r\n\r\nThanks for the reference to Jen's Blog. I am an acquantance
      of Jen's and am familiar with her blog.\r\n\r\nI guess what I'm looking for
      is more information from the Font Foundry's on commercial use, licensing for
      commercial use, etc.  \r\n\r\nI want to protect my own interests, artwork and
      designers from copyright infringements of all types. In order to best serve
      my company and the customers that purchase our downloadable designs, I want
      to be able to post information about the licenses we have purchased for commercial
      use, as well as inform the digital community about copyright law and what constitutes
      an infringement.\r\n\r\nI am confused by other graphic designer's interpretation
      of font EULA's. They are under the impression that they can use fonts in their
      graphic designs and then sell their designs online or in retail stores.\r\n\r\nIt
      seems clear to me that the fonts they claim can be used for commercial projects,
      are actually licensed only to the end user: for personal, non-commercial use.
      Most of them site Microsoft Word or Works as their source for fonts and claim
      that the EULA allows them to use Microsoft's Fonts in their commercial ventures.\r\n\r\nAfter
      reading about fonts on Microsoft's site, I did not come to the same conclusion.
      Rather, I learned that Microsoft has a license agreement with many different
      Font Foundaries and the license they are providing is only to the end user for
      personal use only.\r\n\r\nIf this is the case, then none of the type faces these
      companies and their designers are using, and claiming to be free fonts, or shareware,
      can be used legally in graphic designs of papers, ribbons, elements, etc. \r\n\r\nEach
      designer must purchase a commercial license agreement for the fonts and type
      faces they are using in their artwork.\r\n\r\nAm I right?\r\n\r\n\r\n*** gina

  body: "Gina, \r\n\r\nYes. You are right. Just because a software package comes bundled
    with oodles of fonts, does not mean someone can use them in a project for sale
    which requires them to bundle the same fonts to be sold again. In general, the
    person who licensed the software is the only person who has the right to use the
    fonts.\r\n\r\nVery few people -- a challenge to link to foundries that do -- allow
    for re-distribution of their fonts by the original person who licensed them."

    a truly absurd claim), and Type 1 digital fonts have been found in a summary judgment
    by US Federal District Court (Adobe vs SSI) to be protected as software, and subject
    to copyright law. I'll go so far as to say that if Type 1 fonts are software,
    then OpenType and TrueType fonts sure as heck are software too.\r\n\r\nMost other
    countries in the world consider digital fonts to be protected under copyright
    law, and most first-world countries (notably in the EU) have considerably stronger
    protections for fonts than the US does.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\n\r\nT"

    \"I\u2019ll go so far as to say that if Type 1 fonts are software, then OpenType
    and TrueType fonts sure as heck are software too.\"\r\n\r\nWow- I totally agree
    with you. We are having a similar battle with copyright laws protecting our designer's
    original templates of boxes, cards, wrappers, and novelty packaging.  We have
    had customers rip off our templates alter them just slightly and claim them as
    their own. \r\nTheir response has been that our templates ought to be patented,
    however, if the original pattern is not 3-D or mechanical in nature, it is copyright
    protected the moment the first pencil marks are made- or the first digital pixels
    are placed on the canvas in Illustrator or Photoshop...etc.\r\n\r\nI am going
    to forward this thread to the site owners of the infringing company. I think it
    will enlighten them.\r\n\r\nAlso- I want to clarify that we do not provide text
    in PDF files nor do we 'share' fonts or provide free fonts. \r\n\r\nOur company
    has purchased commercial use licenses for hundreds of fonts in order to be sure
    we are not violating the EULA. \r\n\r\nOur use of fonts is to embellish the art
    or graphics in our papers, and elements. The type becomes merged into the graphic.
    Our files are sold as a download in JPG or PNG formats.\r\n\r\nSamples of our
    work can be found at my site:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.daisiecompany.com\r\n\r\n*** gina
