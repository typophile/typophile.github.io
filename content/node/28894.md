  think of using it for a letterhead for my concert promotion company. Any other suggetions?
  This is the first font I am considering purchasing and i want to make a solid decision.\r\n\r\nThanks.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/shockwavespec_3437.gif]"

    it like a logo ... dunno. if the shoe fits.\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br

  body: Looks very Disco, which does make it suited for certain sorts of concert promotions.
    On a letterhead, though... it would do fine for the trademark, but I hope there
    is a version without the double-line adornements for the contact information.
    Otherwise you'd have to substitute in something like Avant Garde or Kabel, or
    risk making it a tedious read at small sizes.
