  class.</strong>\r\nThe survey is meant to show what characteristics people find
  in different typefaces and how it varies. I'm also planning on exploring the influence
  of different weights, letter-spacing, and line-length on peoples' opinions.\r\n\r\n<strong>My
  question for you is what characteristics do you think are most important to include
  in the survey?</strong>\r\nI'm looking for about 12. It will be setup like this:
  each page will have one sample of type, below that image will be a set of checkboxes
  with the characteristics listed. The participant will be asked to check all that
  apply to the sample image.\r\n\r\nI created a preliminary survey and handed it out
  to a few other students in the class\u2013 these are the \"tags\" I included, that
  I hope to improve upon: <em>Strong, Exciting, Playful, Casual, Modern, Precise,
  Elegant, Boring, Distinct, Ugly, Old,</em> and an option for <em>Nothing</em>.\r\n\r\nMy
  professor, Chuck Bigelow, suggested using the slang of college students to describe
  them, but I'm not sure how effective that would be. I'm also thinking I should make
  the tags more oppositional\u2013 each tag having a counter tag.\r\n\r\n<strong>Any
  suggestions or comments are appreciated. Thank you very much.</strong>"
