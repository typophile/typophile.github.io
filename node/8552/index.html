		<div class="commentbody">This is serious. Maybe the best thing on this forum yet. <BR> <BR>Wonderful integration of curves and cuts. It's clear you're not afraid to see through the superficial rules of type design - instead getting and giving a taste the real juices inside. <BR> <BR>It's very nice to see straightness where we usually see mushy curves, like in the lc &quot;a&quot;, &quot;g&quot; and &quot;s&quot;. In the &quot;g&quot;, though, maybe the straightness should &quot;end&quot; sooner - I think it's pushing the lower counter a bit out of shape. Do you know what I mean? Also in the &quot;g&quot;: you might want to make the head have vertical stress - like your &quot;o&quot;. <BR> <BR>The lc &quot;a&quot;'s tail should maybe be more like the finials of the lc &quot;c&quot; and &quot;e&quot;. The lefthand &quot;stubs&quot; of the lc &quot;f&quot; and &quot;t&quot; are a wonderful shape, but they seem to be making a dark spot, especially in the &quot;f&quot; (which btw has a great righthand foot serif, as does the &quot;r&quot;). The lc &quot;k&quot; is killer! For the lc &quot;q&quot;, maybe consider making the serif on the descender righthand only. I would give the lc &quot;r&quot; a stronger beak. The &quot;seats&quot; of the &quot;v&quot; and &quot;w&quot; are amazing. And the lc &quot;y&quot; is the real thing. The comma should maybe be more of a comma - less of a period with an appendix. <BR> <BR>UC: Maybe lower the bar of the &quot;F&quot;. I'd make the &quot;G&quot;'s beard sharp (like the lc &quot;b&quot;'s seat). The top-left of the &quot;M&quot; and &quot;N&quot; is just too good. But I think the &quot;M&quot; needs to be wider - maybe open up the middle &quot;V&quot;. I'd make the &quot;P&quot;'s head bigger. As for the &quot;Q&quot;, it's a &quot;Q&quot; alright! I really like the structure and form. But the tail seems to be pulling it leftward/clockwise a bit. The &quot;R&quot;'s leg seems a bit too strong - but maybe I'm being to &quot;rationalist&quot;. I think the &quot;Y&quot; definitely needs a bigger torso. As for the &quot;Z&quot;, it looks a bit too sharp - maybe treat the corners like you did in the numeral &quot;4&quot; (same for the lc &quot;z&quot;). <BR> <BR>Numerals: The &quot;3&quot; is just wow. The zero is great, but maybe a little light (on purpose?). BTW, all the numerals seem to have a little too much stroke contrast. I think your BP is cool, but maybe too big with OS nums. <BR> <BR>And in terms of proportions: I think your ascenders are not long enough in relation to the descenders. <BR> <BR>Please don't take this critique harshly - you have something amazing here, make no mistake. Go all the way with it. <BR> <BR>hhp</div>

Nice work.  <BR> <BR>Just out of curiousity..how many hours (approx.) have you used on this face so far?  <BR> <BR>Uhm.. The tail on the uppercase 'Q' are not right.. I would have tried to make it less angular and softer&hellip; The lowercase 'e' also bugs me&hellip;the horisontal bar should be lowered to balance the negative space above and under it.  <BR> <BR>Its obviously a lot of stuff that can be discussed about a typeface that is so close to being finished (relatively speaking) ..but I am allways a bit reluctant as to suggest alterations that may take some personality away from it at this stage.  <BR> <BR>I am not sure of what youve been thinking with your &quot;experimental&quot; ligatures in the copy you set. Its not working at the moment but its definately something to look into..But the question is if it is the right typeface to do it with.  <BR> <BR>It sure looks promising!!

		<div class="commentbody">&gt; How lose, or how tight should be a text face? <BR> <BR>Quantitatively, I have no idea. <BR> <BR>But I would say that it has to be as tight as possible without making the counters overpower the interletter spacing. The reasons for this are: <BR>1. We generally read words, so letters should blend together. <BR>2. Upto a point (which is essentially determined by the forms, not the spacing), the narrower a word the better, in two ways: more words fit in the field of vision during reading; more words fit in the line/page/etc. <BR> <BR>Also, I can offer examples. I can't think of a text face that has too-tight spacing (Helvetica's too tight, but it's not really a text), but I can mention two fonts that I admire except their spacing is too loose: Rotis and FF Eureka. <BR> <BR>hhp</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Jacques &ndash;  <BR> <BR>It seems I've arrived a little late to the party. But let me echo all the praise that's come before.  I really like what you've created here. In some ways TyPress reminds me of some of the things I was exploring in my Whitman typeface, but built on more of an oldstyle model (in contrast to Whitman's Transitional and Scotch forebears). <BR> <BR>This is a handsome face, and it sounds like you're well on your way to completing the design. If you're open to a few more comments, however, here are a couple of observations I had. <BR> <BR>This may be the fault of the flash specimen, but it looks to me like your lc 'v' is floating a bit on the line &ndash; in words like 'advertisement' and 'approved'. Check the original to see if maybe you shouldn't extend the overshoot down a bit. If you've trimmed the vertex to the baseline, then I would try dropping to half the overshoot. If it's already below the baseline, I'd try going to the full value of the round overshoots. <BR> <BR>Again perhaps an artifact of the flash file, but the counter in your lc 'd' seems a little large to me. Although I see what you're after with the horizontality of the top join, you might want to let that inside curve drop a little more as it joins the stem. <BR> <BR>Finally, this may simply be a matter of taste, but I don't care for the chamfer at the top of lc 't'. I think the effect is perfect in places like the beak of the 'a' or the terminal of the 'y'. But here it serves to round out the top in a way that seems at odds with the crisp character of other, similar details. I would go for a compromise between your original, sharp version and this. Instead of an angled chamfer at the tip, I would try clipping the tip with a horizontal. <BR> <BR>These are just picky little things. Overall a handsome design. <BR> <BR>&ndash; Kent.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Well, to me it means something that goes backwards, towards things that have been done before.

		<div class="commentbody">I like the idea of two italics. But, one of the things that make this font attractive ane interesting to me, as a designer, is the fact that the italic isn't just a slanted version of the roman. I'm borderline bored with italics that look so similar to their roman counterparts. Harsh, I know. I found myself salivating over the &quot;Typophile&quot; collection at the Storm Foundry yesterday, in particular their Jannon. But then again, I'm guilty of coveting Tyfa as well. So maybe I should just say that I like the italic the way it is.</div>

Why should an italic &quot;f&quot; descend, *exactly*? I think you have a point concerning display fonts, but not text fonts. <BR> <BR>I also happen to think that the sloped-roman idea was Morison's one good original contribution to type design - it was just executed badly: they applied it way too literally, instead of looking at what makes a roman a roman: rigidity. <BR> <BR>It's been 500 years, but a real italic has yet to emerge, as far as I'm concerned.

I did say that I was speaking &quot;as a designer&quot;, and I should have also said that I was not speaking as a &quot;typographer&quot;. You know that I like the idea of two italics, both speaking as a designer and typographer. So maybe I should've just been more articulate from brain to fingers on keyboard. Giving typographers and designers variety and also the opportunity to make the text readable (and legible) is very important. But, I can see where an uninformed designer (like myself) might use the face incorrectly. Maybe I was thinking of display purposes and not text. Guilty as charged. ;-p <BR> <BR>And yes.

		<div class="commentbody">O-o-oh. <BR>You are quick tonight. (Berlin it is 21:00) <BR> <BR>HHP: I am still a disputal of the theories about type I learned. Those are the ones of Gerrit Noordzij. (According to his theory, my Italic is a bastard, having its way of building somewhere between roman and 'real' italic) Noordzij has tried to differ between roman and Italic by analysing the way one would write them. So one can say there is immence difference between Roman and Italic. <BR> <BR>I think we have here a discussion about theory, not about my typeface. <BR> <BR>I decided to make my italic a 'bastard' Italic, not only because I like it, but also because i was inspired by 16th and 17th century type. Then they designed Italic to be used with roman faces, but still they were seperate designs. Combined with theory of type of G. Noordzij.  <BR> <BR>I have personaly my difficulties with obliqued type. <BR> <BR>Jacques <BR> <BR>PS: question: hhp, do you really think obliqued type is more readeable than Italics?</div>

		<div class="commentbody">&gt; Gerrit Noordzij <BR> <BR>I admire Noordzij in many ways, both inside and outside of type design. His &quot;Letterletter&quot; I enjoyed very much, even though I disagree with its basic premise: when it comes to Noordzij's blind love of the hand, I think he's completely wrong - and I'm not the only one. As Paul Stiff writes in Typography Papers #4: &quot;Gerrit is confident that once we understand writing, we will understand typography. Here he is quite wrong: we will not understand typography until we understand reading.&quot; We no longer read handwriting. Let the doddering old man rest in peace, instead of trying to teach it the lambada. <BR> <BR>&mdash;- <BR> <BR>Functionally, in a text face, italics is about slant, and *not* &quot;ductus&quot;. The simple reason is that immersive reading cannot always pick up too-subtle variations - it needs a discernible contrast in structure (or alternatively color, which is actually my personal preference), and this is provided by the slant. You need the slant*, the rest is a matter of two things: the designer's personal taste (which is often given way too much importance**), and functionalism (see below). <BR> <BR>* A good example of this is the italic of Seria: Majoor has made a font which is very beautiful, but because it has almost no slant it doesn't really work 100%. Small example: the UC &quot;I&quot; (common in English) is nearly impossible to decipher as italics. Note that he has a second -more slanted- italics for Seria, but I'm not sure when/where it's coming out. <BR> <BR>** Deep down this is a dispute between Art and Craft, and I'm personally tired of the huge exageration of the former in contemporary design. <BR> <BR>&gt; do you really think obliqued type is more readeable than Italics?  <BR> <BR>It's mostly a question of familiarity, specifically with boumas (word shapes): the closer  an italic is to the roman, the more readable it is - that should be beyond dispute. Not just in making the structures the same, but also in making the slant small. But of course you *still* need a discernible slant, and the smaller you make it the more you have to use color, width and apparent size to compensate. <BR> <BR>So, for example, the descending &quot;f&quot; is bad for reading: it creates confusion in our bouma decipherment. However, pure readability doesn't exist - it has to be balanced against aesthetics. To see what kind of balance I personally consider ideal (at least at this point in time), look at Patria, where in places I've sacrificed boumas for aesthetic effect - but also differentiation, like the lc &quot;a&quot;, which is a common single-letter word in English (&quot;I said I wanted *a* dog.&quot;), and being short it's very likely to be deciphered through the blurry parafovea, so it needs extra help. <BR> <BR>hhp</div>
