  body: A long while ago I designed a series of three free fonts, Dotimatrix Three,
    Five and Seven. They are matrix fonts in which the letters are of size three dots
    by seven, five dots by seven and seven dots by seven respectively. A sample of
    Dotimatrix Three can be seen <a href="http://www.1001fonts.com/font_details.html?font_id=1355">here</a>,
    and the whole series of fonts is downloadable from that location as well, I believe.
    <BR> <BR>This post should not be misconstrued as an endorsement of the typefaces.
