    the \"Bb\" is different on both labels.\r\n\r\nOR... could it be a nice Opentype-face
    with lots of alternate letters?"

  body: thank you all for the finds~! There are some good alternatives..Dear Sarah

  body: "I agree that this looks handwritten -- it's the best way to make sure you
    aren't copied.\r\n\r\nIn addition to Lex's remark about Part 9 of the Script Guide,
    you might also look at <a href=\"http://bowfinprintworks.com/Script10Pg1.html\">Part
    10 (Antique Handwriting)</a>. There are some good examples of the sort of individual
    flair that much modern handwriting lacks, and that may resemble this sample.\r\n\r\n-
