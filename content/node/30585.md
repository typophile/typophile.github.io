body: "All cliches aside, im designing an identity and webpage for a company by the
  name of \r\n\"Focused Web\". A quick background. . . A small Web Design and SEO/SEM
  marketing company based out of Truckee CA. \r\n\r\nTheir site is old and they have
  never worked on their identity or website. They are pushing the company towards
  a new Active Content web page management system, following similiar parrallels to
  various forms of web 2.0 user contributed content. \r\n\r\nThey want to look like
  one of the new cliche web 2.0 companies. Whilst I will also come up with a more
  unique solution. . . I have the following question. . . \r\n\r\nIs there any serifed,
  slab, or script that might work in conjunction with Vag Rounded, or the new Gotham
  Rounded. \r\n\r\nOther points. . . they want to incorporate their initials as either
  a mark, or typographic mark. Ill post a few roughs shortly if anyone cares to take
  a look.\r\n\r\nCheers\r\n\r\n(you can see their existing identity and site at http://www.focusedweb.com\r\n\r\n~James"

  body: "When I see the first example I am reminded to the Roxio toast 6 logo. Very
    similar in colours and typeface. In my personal opinion I like the bottom one
    best because it still incorporates a globe from their original logo and doesn't
    look like a massive overhaul of their logo, it makes it instantly recognizable
    to the client. \r\nI'm thinking maybe incorporating the f with the globe in the
    word focused, but when I visualise it in my head I want to punch myself. \r\n\r\nBut
    so far a big improvement from the original logo.\r\n\r\nKeep us updated"

  body: "I'm not sure about the 'f' behind the globe - it makes me think of some sort
    of TV news station from the 1970s. I don't think the typeface choice (of the 'f')
    fits with the Web 2.0 look.\r\n\r\nHowever, the globe is a nice update from their
    old Web 1.0 logo.\r\n\r\nRemember, for Web 2.0:\r\n-Everything made from candy
    (well done in your first two logos)\r\n-No capital letters (to promote \"friendliness\")\r\n-Rounded
    terminals (you're close on this one)\r\n-Bright fruit-like colours (again, your
    blue is nice - maybe throw in some orange or lime or grape)\r\n\r\nSo while your
    logos have that Web 2.0 look, I think you could take it even further :)\r\n\r\n
