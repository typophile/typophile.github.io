  sure it's not Knockout, Akkurat, Univers, Helvetica, Akzidens, Nobel, Gotham, Interstate,
  etc.\r\n\r\nWhat do you think? I have a spread where the capitals look a lot like
  Nobel/Gotham. Again, I can post that too.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\n\r\nSam"

    Grotesque MT Std by Adobe. Is this the same design? Thanks again.'

    to Adobe so if you want any of that you need to go to the source.
