  body: "I'd say customized. A ready-to-use solution is [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/redrooster/extension-rr/|Extension]]
    (Book). If I have to redraw it, I would probably start with [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/frutiger/|Frutiger]]
    (Bold) (reacreating /R with /P). \r\n2 more similars: [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/dtptypes/delargo-dt/|Delargo]]
    (same work as Frutiger) and [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/ascender/mayberry-pro/|Mayberry]]
    (same work again)"
