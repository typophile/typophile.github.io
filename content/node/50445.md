  below. This allowed you to have a line above the first line of copy etc.\r\n\r\nDoes
  anyone know how to do this in Indesign, the only way I can figure is to use underline
  but this seems a little strange because how would you get the line above a first
  line of copy???\r\n\r\nCan anyone help?\r\n\r\nCheers\r\nSteve"

    icon which looks like space above text in the Paragraph palette.\r\n\r\nFor rules,
    see Rules under the Paragraph palette or Paragraph style sheets."
