body: Just curious, why is it the Unicode.org tables sequence from 'top to bottom
  / left to right' as opposed to 'l-r/t-b'?

    complex characters would have been too small to be easily readable. \r\n\r\nCheers,

  body: "I'm not sure I understand what you mean, but I'm certain that I wasn't particularly
    clear myself... If you look at, say [[http://www.unicode.org/charts/PDF/U1F600.pdf|Emoticons]],
    and [[http://http://www.unicode.org/charts/PDF/U2600.pdf|Misc Symbols]]... If
    you mean what I think you do, I don't think these tables would need to scaled-down
    to to facilitate a different orientation. Misc symbols is a 16x16 grid, and prints
    with enough detail to be referenced.\r\n\r\n...\r\n\r\n"

  body: The Unicode Standard book is portrait format, so it made sense to organise
    the charts that way, especially since many writing systems or symbol sets only
    require a few columns.

    reading.

    16 rows were to be reconfigured as 16 columns, same size cells, plus header, there
    would be considerably less margin at left and right.)\r\n"
