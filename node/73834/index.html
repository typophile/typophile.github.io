		<div class="commentbody"><p>Back in the old days, type consisted of little rectangular pieces of an alloy of lead with other metals. And thus type was 14 point type if the type slugs took up 14 points of space.</p>
<p>The x-height of one face might be much larger than that of another, giving it a subjectively larger appearance, but that did not matter.</p>
<p>That would still seem to mean, though, that the type size should fairly closely match the cap height plus the descender length. (In some typefaces, letters like the lowercase d or h have ascenders that extend significantly beyond the cap height, however.)</p>
<p>But even in the days of metal type, other factors existed that led to there being some unused space on the face of the type slug. Typefounders found that printers would sometimes like to mix different typefaces on the same line of text; for example, some typefaces might have a Roman and an italic, but no bold face, and, thus, the printer would have to use a different typeface for a bold.</p>
<p>So they ended up designing &ldquo;lining&rdquo; fonts, where the baseline of every typeface occupied the same position on the type slug. To avoid too much waste, however, if a face had either very short or very long descenders, then the baseline might be shifted up or down by some multiple of 1/2 point so that ordinary leading could be used to align the baseline of such a face with that of an ordinary face.</p>
<p>All this means is that type size is simply a measure of the space a line must take up as a minimum, and how much of that space is actually used by the letterforms is arbitrary.</p>

<p>There’s no <em>visual</em> characteristic. Font size, as specified in points, is the height of the body, but the relationship of the letter shape to that height is variable.</p>

<p>Total height, cap height, and x-height are quite independent of each other. Zapfino, for example, has <em>huge</em> capitals combined with tiny lower case letters.</p>
<p>Is it correct to state the actual font size refers directly to the <em>design grid size</em> &ndash; usu. 1000 units for a Postscript flavor font and 2048 for a TrueType one? And when a designer is drawing a font, he usually stays within that bounding box?  (Although it&rsquo;s quite possible to have elements stick out of it.)</p>

		<div class="commentbody">@John Hudson - the Wikipedia definition of &ldquo;body height&rdquo; might not be correct (&ldquo;distance between the top of the tallest letterform to the bottom of the lowest one&rdquo;) because that, coupled with your &ldquo;Font size, as specified in points, is the height of the body&rdquo; would contradict my original example, no? -i.e. top of &ldquo;h&rdquo; to bottom of &ldquo;p&rdquo; should&rsquo;ve been the same for Verdana and Calibri</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>The Wikipedia definition is not correct, although type is often scaled relative to the body such that this definition is apt. It is easiest to think about the body height in terms of metal type, which allows you to actually see the body. The body height is not the height of the letter, but the height of the piece of metal on the face of which the letter appears. This is well illustrated in <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/hypowren/2234536811/">this photograph</a>. See how all the pieces of metal type are of uniform height, regardless of which letter appears on them? That&rsquo;s the body height. In a 12pt font of type, the body height would be 12 points high. In scalable digital type, the letters are plotted on a unit grid, the full height of which is the body height and is scaled to the nominal text size.</p>
<p>There are numerous reasons which an individual typeface might be ‘cast small on the body’, and hence be visually smaller than another typeface at the same nominal font size. In my work, a common reason for this is inclusion of more than one writing system within a single font, making different use of the grid space, e.g. Latin and Arabic. Arabic tends to have deeper descenders than Latin, and hence in order to visually harmonise the two scripts the Latin needs to be smaller than it would be if it were not a companion to the Arabic. In the case of Calibri, and the other Microsoft CT fonts, we knew when we started developing them that they would be extended for alphabets such as Vietnamese that require vertically stacked diacritic marks, so did not occupy the full body height with the ascenders and descenders.</p>
