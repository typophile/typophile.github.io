body: "hello everyone,\r\n\r\ni'm currently working on an art catalog and i'm thinking
  about a historically inspired look of the typography. the art performance deals
  with an incident that took place in the early 19th century (1816 to be precise).\r\nalthough
  there is really no need for absolute historical correctness in the final design,
  i'd like to have a base for the choice of a possible typeface and the kind of layout
  and typesetting. at the end, i'll have to decide, whether it's possible to combine
  the rather wild and kind of \"trash chic\" performance with a historical typesetting.\r\n\r\nthe
  country involved in the incident was basically france. on the other hand, one could
  also imagine to have another country's press reporting about it. unfortunately,
  i'm quite unsure about what actually typography looked like in countries like france,
  england, netherlands and germany at the mentioned point in time. it meets the almost
  late period of classicism in typography/typedesign. in germany, i guess, broken
  letters were ruling most of the printed work (what about books/novels?). but before
  posting more inadequately simplified consderations about the typogaphic state of
  affairs in the other countries \u2013 like france=didot, italy=bodoni etc), i'd
  like to hear some opinions from the experts here.\r\nonce again, my basic question
  is: which typefaces where used commonly in a) books and b) newspapers or reports
  around 1816? \r\n\r\nkind regards,\r\n\r\nalex"

  body: "great! thanks a lot for your efforts. nice use of the brackets in the second
    example, which in fact is from 1816.\r\nby the way, i've read your punchcuts article
    on typeculture.com. very interesting, too. it shows the early appearance of (not
    only upper case) sans serif letters. i even thought about bringing in a sans serif
    typeface. it works as a bridge and probably i could need it for simultaneous setting
    english translations of some articles. on the other hand: i don't really want
    to slip into this kind of typical 19th century retro design (like this: http://cache.eb.com/eb/image?id=73204&rendTypeId=4).
    although, i like it, this has been done by so many designers before and i'd like
    to do something more idiosyncratic.\r\n\r\nmaybe, i can find some more online
    resources with example material.\r\nthis is, what i've come across so far:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.uk.olivesoftware.com/Default/Client.asp?Enter=true&skin=BL\r\n\r\nhttp://www.bl.uk/onlinegallery/ttp/ttpbooks.html\r\n\r\nhttp://www.ub.uni-bielefeld.de/diglib/\r\n\r\nhttp://www.polona.pl/dlibra/doccontent2?id=186&from=editionindex&from=${searchType}search&dirids=7\r\n\r\nhttp://anno.onb.ac.at/\r\n\r\nhttp://www.historybuff.com/archives/tree.cgi?ID=1655\r\n\r\nof
    course, it would be better to have more english and french examples, so if someone
    had some recommendable adresses...\r\n\r\n\r\n// alex"

    Maybe if you worked on glass -- that way you could shoot it without a cast shadow,
    for close cropping, or against a background. You could place typesetting behind
    the glass to "trace" over, to create the lettering in the first place.

    are two small letter specimen books of two small printing shops at Augsburg (southern
    Germans) from 1806 / 1811. If you think those could be interesting, I could mail
    you those.\r\n\r\nIn Germany, at this time, almost all newspapers were printed
    with broken types - same applies to 90 percent or more of the novels. On the other
    hand scientific texts (in German) could be printed either in blackletter or in
    antiqua (about 60 / 40 percent). And of course all latin and french texts were
    printed in antiqua. \r\n\r\nwolfgang"

  body: "Well, I can chime in here that Friedrich Neugebauer was in an English prison
    camp in Egypt for a good part of WWII and used toothpaste -- I've seen and held
    the original. Of course, the formulation of the toothpaste in 1943 may not have
    <em>any</em> resemblance to the formulation of today's.\r\n\r\nFriedrich was conscripted
    into the Austrian army after Hitler's Anschluss in 1938 and as he put it, after
    four years of serving in the army against his wishes, he had the great fortune
    of being captured and was able to spend the rest of war (1944-1947) not shooting
    at anyone. They lived in tents in a camp somewhere near the Mediterranean, where
    the Brits were generally humane to the prisoners. (Although 55 years later it
    still brought tears to his eyes as he recalled that some of the camp personnel
    simplistically lumped all prisoners together: \"Give a table knife to a Kraut
    and he'll turn it into a machine gun!\") \r\n\r\nThe authorities allowed him to
    make artwork using letter paper donated by a sympathetic officer, colors made
    from pigments that he ground himself from foraged minerals and other raw materials,
    and brushes made from his tentmates' hair. The cover of a small book of traditional
    songs has the title lettered in toothpaste, and if I remember this accurately,
    the binding cloth is a flour sack scrounged from the camp kitchen. I just looked
    in both of my books, <em>Schrift als Kunst</em> and <em>The Mystic Art of Written
    Forms,</em> to see if I could upload a picture, but a there isn't a photo of this
    cover. However, I've made a shot of an interior page. (Sorry that the lighting
    is not good, I just did a quickie handheld.) This book is 30 x 22 cm, and I'm
    still stunned by the grace and beauty of it, when you consider the circumstances
    under which it was made. \r\n\r\nI can tell you from memory that the toothpaste
    is quite mounded up -- higher in profile than the typical raised gesso with gold
    leaf on top, if that helps you imagine it -- and he must have made it even higher
    to begin with, since the toothpaste <em>must</em> have some loss of volume as
    the moisture departs the ribbon. \r\n\r\nI wonder if loading toothpaste into a
    cake decorator's piping bag would be a help to you, since you would have a choice
    of nozzle tips, and far more control over the material than if you simply squeeze
    a plastic tube.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/prisoncamp_6562.jpg]"
