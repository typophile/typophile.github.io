body: "What is a web designer's criminal liability (in the US) if he or she is involved
  in the production of a website the legality of whose content may be called into
  question?\r\n\r\nSpecifically, I'm thinking about the web designer's relationship
  to the terms and conditions statement of a website containing borderline pornographic
  images. What happens if the terms and conditions statement isn't airtight? Is only
  the owner of the copyright of the website liable? Or the owner of the business advertised,
  or which contracted the production of the website? \r\n\r\nThe only reading into
  constitutional law and first amendment protection of borderline obscenity predates
  the advent of the internet, so I really have no idea what the current state of things
  is. Any ideas? (Ideas besides to avoid working on anything legally questionable)"

    pornography of course) are.  But if as the designer you only work with material
    that is legal and only give the client material that is legal, I can't imagine
    you having any problems. Now, if they send you kiddie porn and you put logos on
    top of it, you can probably expect a visit from the police.\r\n\r\nBut asking
    about the \"Terms and Conditions\" statement is broad.  Are you worried about
    being responsible for what that actually stays?  Isn't that like asking if you're
    responsable for the content of a contract people sign at a store since you were
    the printer?  I don't think the printer would ever have any problem unless the
    actually printed material itself constituted a crime (reproduction of copyrighted
    material or illegal images (child porn, etc).\r\n\r\n<em>\xABEl futuro es una

    to keep it mostly lawyer-free.\r\n\r\nThat said, the TOS is typically an agreement

    would be any more liable than the employee in charge of answering phones or sweeping

  body: "No, I didn't honestly expect that the designer would retain much liability,
    but the line of reasoning I was employing went something like this:\r\n\r\nTerms
    of service agreements exist, seemingly, to fulfill the function of a contract
    between the user of a website and the organization to which the website belongs.
    I know too little about contract law, but it would seem, again, that were the
    user's exposure or interaction with the TOS page somehow not set up properly (maybe
    due to the web designer simply not knowing where, or how, or how many times to
    implement it) it might void the \"contract\". Would that be the web designer's
    fault (criminally), even a little bit? \r\n\r\nUsually the worst that can happen
    when a designer makes a mistake on a print or web project is the client being
    angry, perhaps choosing to go with someone else for the next gig. I don't think
    this is even a borderline case, but was curious (read: cautious) about if it were.
    The US is a strange country.\r\n\r\nAlso, it's not porn. Also, definitely not
    a lawyer. : )\r\n\r\n "

  body: "You can give yourself some protection with a \"hold harmless\" clause for
    your design services, (pretty standard in normal contracts anyway) which basically
    means that you dealt with content provided by your client in good faith that the
    client had obtained all required clearances and kept appropriate records, and
    therefore you can't be sued if the client failed to do so, but that is strictly
    a civil point. \r\n\r\nCertain specific content is illegal (child porn always,
    possibly others depending on community standards) but that is a criminal matter,
    and no contract can insulate you from criminal prosecution.\r\n\r\nI am not a
    lawyer, and this information is for informational purposes only as grounds for
    further research, and should not be construed as legal advice.\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Okay I think I see what the OT is getting out.  This would be more akin to
    (in the case of the paper contract I mentioned in my first post) the printer and/or
    designer producing a document that is otherwise unreadable.  As others have already
    stated, just make sure the client signs off on the final design (positioning of
    the Terms link, etc) and I don't think you'd have a problem.  IANAL but just  doing
    what the client asks for and (maybe) on your own making sure that it goes with
    established practice should be more than sufficient for you.\r\n\r\n<em>\xABEl

    am reminded of hearing \"so there are actually people who design fonts?\"\r\n\r\nAt
    the higher end, did you think magazines like Playboy and Penthouse (and their
    web sites) were created by robots or something?\r\n\r\nI doubt there's *very much*
    high-end design in the porn industry, but it's a huge industry with a large volume
    of cheaply produced low-end product, all of which gets some degree of design.
    Maybe most of it is low-end, maybe a lot of the people doing that are self-taught,
    I dunno. But whether or not one likes the design or its subject matter, there's
    a LOT of design work happening in the porn industry, in print, online, and video.\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\nT"

    not included) for porn were both producing extreme scatological porn and getting
    those convictions required years of searching for people to persecute and venue
    shopping. But at the local level dealing with porn can be far more dangerous;
    local DAs will walk all over law and precedent to try and get elected to some
    higher office."
