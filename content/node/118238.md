  An old-school grotesque in the vein of the [[http://a1.dspnimg.com/data/l/2085910623030_Rp8aLgvk_l.jpg|Stephenson
  Blake]] ones which have seen [[http://www.aisforapple.fr/fonts/grotesque-6/|several]]

  [[http://www.stormtype.com/family-trivia-grotesk.html|the past few years.]] ...all
  of which I've had a close look at, but this is none of them. Note the rather tame
  /Q/ in contrast to most of the ones I mentioned. The /t/ is a good shibboleth too.
  The /g/, not shown here, is of course double-storey. Yes, it could be a custom typeface,
  but then again, none of the four other faces that they use (AG, Sabon, Freight)
  is.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://imgur.com/HgQZAbE\"><img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/HgQZAbE.png\"
