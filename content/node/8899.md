    now, but I think this is a digitization <BR>of Ludovico degli Arrighi&#39;s calligraphy.

  body: The actual font used &#40;with the bulbous terminals&#41; was Acquiline. It&#39;s
    <BR>from Expert Software, a vendor of ripoff clones, but since we&#39;re here
    <BR>to identify exact fonts ... <BR> <BR>It sure appears to have been derived
    from Scriptorium&#39;s Allegheny. <BR>The Golden Globe designers &#40;and I&#41;
    seem to prefer the modified <BR>font but, clearly, that doesn&#39;t justify the
    origin of it.

  body: 'Aquiline was originally offered by T-26 and was a Jim Marcus digitization/design.
    For some reason T-26 removed it from their collection a few years back. <BR>Here
    is the Script Font ID Guide sample: <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/64006.gif"
    alt="Aquiline One sample"> <BR> <BR>You might be interested to know that <a href="http://www.moorstation.org/typoasis/pirates/index.htm"
    target="_blank">typOasis</a> has a revision of Aquiline made by Manfred Klein
    and CybaPee &#40;the site owner&#41;, called Aquiline Two.  You can see it has
    lost some of the flair of the original, and is actually based on the Expert Software
    version. <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/64007.gif"

  body: It also seems to have improved the kerning, which was very poor in the Jim
    Marcus font. I just made the second sample, so that&#39;s the first time I had
    a chance to compare the two.

  body: Dave Nalle&#39;s <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/scriptorium/allegheny/allegheny/charmap.html"
    target="_blank">Allegheny</a> includes the original A among some alternate initials,
    showing it was probably based on the same source as the T-26 font, as you can
    see in the character map. <BR> <BR>I think the typOasis version may have mostly
    made changes to the kerning, which was always pretty horrible, even in Dave Nalle&#39;s
    version. Since Expert Software doesn&#39;t &#39;design&#39; anything, as far as
    I know, I wonder who they ripped their version from? <BR> <BR>I think the funny
    T-26 Help section shows how often that font was asked about. I know I&#39;ve ID&#39;d
    it many times for people. This goes back to Mark&#39;s dissertation about people
    liking typefaces that &#39;stand out&#39; &#40;to paraphrase him&#41;. This explains
    the overblown popularity of Lys Calligraph that we have talked about several times,
    and, near the other end of the spectrum, of Bickham Script &#40;and Zapfino&#41;.
    If it &#40;Bickham&#41; didn&#39;t have all those gorgeous swooping swashes, which
    many people can&#39;t even access in the OpenType font, no one would be as excited
    about it. <BR> <BR>That&#39;s one reason why Aquiline Two might be a let-down
    for some users. The more flamboyant original is more &#39;exciting&#39; to play
    around with.
