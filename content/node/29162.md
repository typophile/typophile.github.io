    together - and that's all the new owners of the establishment have.. I would have
    first guessed some free font from the murky depths of the internet... but to answer
    your question, no I don't know that it actually is a typeface, but given the 'clip
    art' nature of the background, I assumed it was a very hasty design job with no
    budget for custom work (even bad custom work...)\r\n\r\nCheers/"
