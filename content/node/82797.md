body: I have been interested in it, and I really would like to give it a try.  I really
  want to do Kinetic Typography.  Are there any free programs(I don't want to spend
  a lot of money on something if I don't even know if I will enjoy it).  What should
  I start?

  body: Don't do it! I thought I'd try typography for the first time almost twenty
    years ago, and the first time <em>was</em> fun, but its a gateway drug and you
    end up addicted to some really nasty stuff like hinting and quadratic splines.

  body: "I'm with John. A few years back all I wanted to do was make a logo, I just
    needed eleven letters for the name... 3,400 custom-drawn glyphs later I found
    I was hooked.\r\n\r\nAs for software, I've only used After Effects and a little
    Flash for KT style work, neither is low in cost \u2014 unless you're a student,
    in which case you can get really good discounts (80% savings in some cases)."

  body: "First of all, congratulations! A new typophile is always cause for celebration.\r\n\r\nThere's
    a big difference between \"typography\" (i.e., the design and composition of texts)
    and \"kinetic typography,\" though I suppose you could argue kinetic typography
    is a subset of typography. The standard tool for kinetic typography is Adobe After
    Effects, which, as Stickly mentioned, isn't cheap. However, if you have access
    to a video camera, you could do it stop-motion style, which doesn't need to involve
    software at all. [[http://vimeo.com/6382511|This]], for instance, was created
    by traditional stop-motion, entirely without assistance from software.\r\n\r\nIf
    you are interested in typography in the traditional sense, you might want to read
    \"Thinking With Type\" by Ellen Lupton, which is a fun introduction to typography,
    or \"The Elements of Typographic Style\" by Robert Bringhurst, which is a more
    in-depth foray.\r\n\r\nWelcome to Typophile!"

  body: "This website is not really for me- I am a painter wanting to gain a bit of
    understanding about fonts.  I did the \"Font 101\" already, which was interesting,
    but it is not immediately apparent what information is applicable to using fonts
    responsibly.\r\n\r\nSpecifically, I have had to make several paper products (programs
    and postcards) for an event I am planning.  I am a painter, but I want to take
    baby steps to understanding how to use multiple fonts in one item.  I have a fine
    arts degree, but I am no designer.  I will pick up recommended books, but does
    anyone else have advice for amateurs (who probably will not read a whole book).
    \ Basic rules for responsible font usage?\r\n\r\nThank you for your time and brain."

    in anything respectable.  :-)\r\n\r\nBTW, to me it sounds like you belong here
    just fine.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
