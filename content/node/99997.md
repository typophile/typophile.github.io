  body: "Sorry, don't know this type and very hard to find a similar that could be
    close to both uppercases and lowercases.\r\nA list of alternatives, some matching
    lowercases, some uppercases but all requiring customization: [[http://fontfabric.com/static-free-font/|Static]]
    (the closest I have but /R off and all spurs on lowercases to be removed), [[http://www.fontbros.com/families/spoon|Spoon]],
    [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/dayflash/rotundus-rounded/|Rotundus Rounded]] (not
    so far but many uppercases off and some lowercases), [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/nmassi/tesca/|Tesca]],
    [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/baobaby/borba-sans/|Borba Sans]], [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/fw-acme/af-module-classic/|Module
    Classic]] (mainly uppercases), [[http://www.dafont.com/duepuntozero.font|Duepuntozero]]
    (mainly lowercases)"
