  that will work as copy text alongside headings(Interstate). Suitable for print &
  web.\r\n\r\nInterstate is also the typeface used in the logotype(related to this
  project) however I'm having some legibility issues with the typeface used as copy
  at small sizes (10pt) \r\n\r\nI love interstate however think it loses it's character
  at small sizes\r\n\r\nThanking you in advance."

    two sans serif typefaces is always difficult. Could look a little itchy if you
    paired Interstate with a humanist sans, but maybe Frutiger works, try it. Those
    are supposed to be the the most readable. If you need a typeface which works well
    on the web, too, try Benton Sans. There is a special version called Benton Sans
    RE especially designed for small sizes. \r\nhttp://www.webtype.com/catalog/?tssans=693&wssmall=829&wsmedium=866&foundryfb=35"
