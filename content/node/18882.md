    black/white borders) to be stroked. Hmmm, but\r\ndid it also allow non-closed
    outlines? If so, then: Paul, yes.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "If I remember correctly, Type 3 allowed practically any PostScript function
    to be used, including strokes, grayscale, conditional statements--anything pretty
    much. This is how random fonts like Beowolf were possible. It was also used for
    clip art fonts with complex images. The downside: no hints, so if all you wanted
    to do was to make a normal font, it looked like crap on a 300 dpi laser printer.
    \r\n\r\nI do recall a company selling Type 3 fonts based on strokes. The advantage
    they touted was that you could squeeze or stretch the fonts without the kind of
    distortions you would get with outline fonts. Unfortunately, since the fonts were
    composed of unvarying strokes, the designs were limited and lacked optical corrections.\r\n\r\nI
    also seem to recall that the original version of Courier that was built into the
    original LaserWriter was stroke-based."

  body: "If I can add a small comment.\r\n\r\nType 1 fonts permit stroke-based outlines.
    Most of\r\nthe type 1 fonts have a PaintType defined to be 0,\r\nbut if you set
    it to be 1, and define StrokeWidth to be\r\nthe pen thickness (30 is thin, 100
    is thick), then\r\noutlines are stroked. This can be used to thicken\r\nfonts
    (not recommended though!), but it can also be used\r\nto render fonts as strokes
    only.\r\n\r\nThe change in the PaintType value and the addition of StrokeWidth\r\nparameter
    can be done in a standard text editor on the \"pfa\" version\r\nof a type 1 font.\r\n\r\nIf
    this sounds too technical, I apologize. I will try\r\nbetter next time.\r\n\r\nLuc"

    me. He told me he had to outline the strokes of the font, which was simply a unclosed
    path when looked at in Illustrator outline view.\r\nNow instead of thinkng he's
    crazy (or being jealous of his enhanced perception), I feel sorry for him that
    he had to deal with it. Fonts from the Stoned Age\u2026\r\n\r\npeace"
