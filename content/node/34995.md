body: "Hey all,\r\n\r\nI seem to have lost my ability to preview Type 1 hints within
  FontLab 5.0.2 on the Mac with the Adobe rasterizer and I'm wondering if this has
  happened to anyone else.\r\n\r\nIn the \"Type 1 Preview\" hinting panel (Tools ->
  Hints & Guides -> Type 1 Hinting), there's a small dropdown menu at the top right
  of the preview area that lets you pick the rasterizer (choices are Apple B&W, Adobe
  B&W, Adobe Grayscale, FreeType B&W and FreeType Grayscale), but both Adobe items
  give me a preview of \"Sample font is not installed\" instead of the waterfall.
  \r\n\r\nI can't seem to find any reference to this menu in the FL5 manual PDF (the
  screen captures of this dialog box do not even show this dropdown menu). Also, this
  feature is working properly on my colleagues machines who are using essentially
  the same software setup as I am.\r\n\r\nTrashing the preferences and Application
  Support folders as well as trying when logged in as a different user do not seem
  to bring this functionality back.\r\n\r\nHas anyone out there had this same problem?\r\n\r\nMany
  thanks,\r\nAndy"

  body: "Adam, thanks for your help:\r\n\r\nI'm using 5.0.2 build 2298 which I believe
    is a release version and Mac OS 10.4.8. I've also tried it with all workspace
    files removed. Is there any one particular support file that would be related
    to hinting that I may want to try to copy from a colleague's computer? Or, is
    it trying to save a temporary file and this is a permissions problem?\r\n\r\nThank
    you,\r\nAndy"

  body: "Hello,\r\n\r\nNow I seem to have the same problem. I'm using Font Lab Studio
    version 5.2.1 on Winows 8 (Build 4868). When I try to do Type 1 hinting, there
    is a message \"sample font is not installed\" in the preview panel. There is no
    preview. There is also no raster preview in the background of the glyph. What
    is the problem?\r\n"
