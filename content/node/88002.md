  register and ask, instead of holding my questions or asking friends and getting
  a \"what are you on about?\" reply.\r\nI used to have a graphic design job before
  uni a long time ago and ever since I am greatly interested in typography, calligraphy
  and paleography as hobby interests. Hence, my question is a just curiosity that
  is bugging me.\r\n\r\nOn old signs and old correspondence letters, several contractions
  are seen and they are written with the last letter with a dot or line underneath,
  such as st. for street, mr. for mister, yr. for your etc. (e.g. <a ref=\"http://images.travelpod.com/tw_slides/ta00/c91/e56/napier-street-sign-n1-hastings.jpg\">road
  sign</a> in the Art Deco city of Napier, NZ) As to print these combinations is not
  straightforward, they have all but disappeared.\r\n\r\nI do not know what are these
  dotted superscript letters are called.\r\n\r\nWhat is included in Unicode always
  seems arbitrary to me. I, for one, would have a few English language specific combined
  letters, such a overlined w (for with as many still write) and these. To make things
  worse, Office Word seems to hate unicode and the unicode superscript t cannot be
  used, so cannot be used overstriked over a dot \u2014one can always use the underlined
  superscript bug.\r\nIn Illustrator, though, it becomes possible. However, interestingly,
  the letter height becomes an interesting dilemma of size and height...\r\n(Attached
  is S with unicode superscript t; S with underlined faux superscript; S plus a dot
  with a t (same size) shifted so its median line is on the cap line of the S)\r\n\r\nConsequently,
  I would love to hear other people's opinion on these.\r\n\r\nThanks"
