  copyrighted Generation B. Someone needs to stop them.\r\n\r\n[[http://www.haroldsfonts.com/genB.html|Generation
  B]], made by [[Harold's Fonts]], is inspired by film logos and posters between 1950s
  and 1960s. It is one of the official fonts of Hasbro's current <em>My Little Pony</em>
  line up of toys, media franchise and official merchandises. It's also in the subtitle
  part of the logo of the current generation's well-known cartoon show, <em>[[http://www.hasbrostudios.com/Our-Shows-Folder/My-Little-Pony|My
  Little Pony: Friendship is Magic]]</em>.\r\n\r\nWith the rise of the cartoon's fandom,
  some fans tried to create their version of Generation B. One user created a thing
  called [[http://fav.me/d3dqa8d|Celestia Medium]], but soon gave up after some concerns.
  Then, another user came up with small letters and Greek/Cyrillic letters, and named
  it [[http://www.mattyhex.net/CMR/|Celestia Medium Redux]], the font in question.\r\n\r\nApparently,
  Gameloft is using Celestia Medium Redux in their upcoming official <em>My Little
  Pony</em> mobile game, instead of Generation B. \r\n\r\n<iframe width=\"480\" height=\"360\"

  width=\"480\">\r\n\r\nWe can't blame some individuals using knock off fonts on their
  unofficial, personal fan works because counting all of every single person who used
  it is impossible and suing them is technically a waste of time and money (unless
  you are from Disney). But this is a different matter. It's the official merchandise.
  Gameloft is using a fan-made font that (technically) infringed copyrighted font
  design (or, in the U.S. terms, a digital font file that might have altered from
  the original file) in an official game, instead of the original and official one!
  It's more like the developers involved didn't know anything about the font (If it's
  not, this is more serious problem!). \r\n\r\nNow, someone needs to stop Gameloft
  from using Celestia Medium Redux before they officially release the game on 8 November,
  and put them on the pressure to change the font. But honestly, I don't know what
  should I start with as a third person.\r\n\r\nBefore you go, here is opinion from
  a professional-skilled artist who likes <em>Friendship is Magic</em>:\r\n<ul> <li>[[http://fav.me/d3lqxoo|\"Why
  You Shouldn't Use The Celestia Medium Font\"]]</li> <li>[[http://fav.me/d41ylps|\"Why
  You (Still) Shouldn't Use Celestia Medium\"]]</li> </ul>"

    more complex problem than I thought. What should be the attitude to the knock-off/fake/unlicensed
    fonts, especially when major company making an officially licensed product?\r\n\r\nSimply
    getting a license will cause no problem, and it will bring original and quality
    fonts. But it costs so much if it's too expensive, and in major cases, using the
    font for different purposes may require to buy another licenses.\r\n\r\nOn the
    other hand, knock-offs are technically not illegal, only a little different from
    the original, and it will help reducing costs if it is free. But someone will
    notice it anyway, and even if there is no basis to sue, some will still tackle
    and complain. Besides, some of them has inferior quality than original.\r\n\r\nThis
    is getting more puzzled...\r\n\r\nAnyway, despite not being illegal, it still
    shows how terrible Gameloft is at choosing fonts. And still, the people at Font
    Bros. are disappointed with what Gameloft have done.\r\n\r\nI think that, normally,
    big major companies with such scale as Gameloft would just end up buying a proper
    license. Why did they act like... Um...  'Hey, I have no money for this.'? (Just
    my shallow idea, though.)\r\n\r\n<blockquote>On the other hand, \u201CCelestia,\u201D

    raises the moon. That is where the name of the original Celestia Medium knock-off

    about it. (And yes, it has absolutely nothing to do with Mark van Bronkhorst's

    body: "Hi!\r\n\r\nAs the guy who \"started a crusade of FUD,\" (an interesting
      way of putting it) some more information about the history of Celestia Medium
      might be helpful.\r\n\r\nBack in the early days of the fandom, the only people
      who knew of / used Generation B in their work were me and a few others who actually
      took the time to figure out what font was being used. There was no knockoff
      version available at the start.\r\n\r\n\"if she thought it was wrong she wouldn\u2019t
      have done it in the first place.\"\r\n\r\nShe didn't know it was wrong because
      she didn't know about Generation B or that she was ripping someone off in the
      first place. Sometime in spring 2011, PurpleTinker developed the Celestia Medium
      font based on a screenshot of Generation B (that was not labeled as such). She
      traced a PNG file of the Generation B character set that was posted on Equestria
      Daily . The first version of Celestia Medium was a literal trace of Generation
      B, but all of the metrics and proportions were screwed up. It was also missing
      the uppercase and special characters. The actual glyphs were fairly close to
      Gen B (it took a smart eye to notice specific glyph differences), but the glyph
      sizes were all normalized and the baselines too. This reduced Celestia Medium
      to a very block-like face, resulting in long strips of letters that had none
      of the whimsy or motion of Generation B. They were more difficult to read as
      well. A clear tell of Celestia Medium was the letter Os: they were the same
      size as all the other glyphs. Compared to the toy boxes, promotional materials,
      etc with used Generation B, it looked quite ugly. It sticks out like a sore
      thumb compared to the real deal.\r\n\r\nI wrote the first \"Why you shouldn't
      use Celestia Medium\" in June 2011 based on the font that existed, and PurpleTinker
      agreed with me that people should use the genuine article. She was unaware of
      Generation B itself, having traced that PNG of the rip. There's no animosity
      between us on that, and she handled it about as classily as someone could.\r\n\r\nWhen
      she took the font down, MattyHex started making Celestia Redux based on the
      original font file for Celestia Medium and started tweaking the glyphs to make
      it slightly different (and worse) than Generation B. I wrote the second \"Why
      you still shouldn't...\" bit in September 2011 right around the time that the
      Redux version came out. Since then, MattyHex has expanded the feature set of
      Celestia Redux considerably. He's added many special characters that didn't
      exist in GenB, and he also added a new set of lowercase glyphs (relegating the
      copies of Generation B's lower case to CR's upper case). The lower case makes
      it into something completely unrelated, and it's not a very readable face either.
      So Celestia Redux at this time has morphed into something quite different than
      Generation B, but people still try to use it as a substitute. Its uppecase still
      fares poorly compared to Generation B, especially now that he's specifically
      changed the uppercase glyphs to look kind of like Generation B but not exactly.
      MattyHex doesn't have the excuse that PT did; he made the Redux version specifically
      knowing about Generation B to create a knockoff version.\r\n\r\nIt's one thing
      for random fanartists to use Celestia Redux once or twice, but it's very tacky
      and a bit low for Gameloft who has an official license of the game to use a
      fan knockoff font. It's a pure case of cheapness and greed, which is not unsurprising
      given their other games and business practices. Other Hasbro licensees continue
      to use Generation B. This is not the first time Gameloft has appropriated fanworks;
      they've used several pieces of fanart (likely acquired from google image search)
      without contacting the artists as assets for the My Little Pony game and their
      advertising. As far as I know, this is the only case of Celestia Medium slipping
      into a licensed product. Not even the fan created licensed shirts on WeLoveFine
      use it.\r\n\r\nOn the usage of Celestia Redux in the game itself, they shouldn't
      have used it (or Generation B, for that matter) for all of that body text. Something
      more readable should have been used instead. I believe there is a body copy
      font that Hasbro uses on the toy boxes, but its specific name is escaping me
      at the moment. Generation B would have been fine for titling, but Celestia Redux
      is used for almost everything in the game, and it's very difficult to read because
      of it. It's true that Font Bros. basically has no recourse, because of the way
      the laws work here in the states (Which I'm sure many are aware of) and their
      response here details it pretty well. It's unfortunate that nothing can be done,
      but that's the way it is.\r\n\r\nAt the end of the day, my primary objection
      to Celestia Redux these days is 1. that it's ugly and 2. I think it's a shame
      that Harold is not getting his fair share from the unexpected popularity of
      ponies. Tons of people out there (that are not Hasbro) are making a lot of money
      off the pony fandom these days for things that are less work than fonts, and
      there's a lot of Celestia Redux being used in fanart or projects that are used/sold
      for profit. I just think people should do the right thing and pay the man his
      due."

    to learn in a later post that Gameloft did not do anything actionable.\r\n\r\nThat
    implies, at the very least, that the font they are using is <em>not</em> a mod
    of the font from Harold's fonts in question; that it's freshly drawn, even if
    it closely resembles the other font. Font software is well protected by copyright
    law, even if font designs are only weakly protected in the U.S. (as opposed to
    not protected at all: there were changes in the law recently).\r\n\r\nHowever,
    on re-reading the thread, it appears that Gameloft <strong>ought</strong> to be
    in deep trouble with <em>Hasbro</em>, because they've licensed the My Little Pony
    product, and they're not appropriately protecting its brand identity; by not using
    the official font specified, they're making a licensed product that is not, in
    this one respect, however minor, differentiated from what a knock-off counterfeiter
    could do.\r\n\r\nAnd that would remain true even if Celestia Medium Redux is an
    entirely legitimate typeface in the same genre as Generation B, and not a rip-off
    or plagiarism.\r\n\r\nNow, there's also the question of violating the trademark
    of the original Celestia Medium, as it may not have been withdrawn long enough

    during development and during beta testing, to protect their interests. If the
    knock-off font was close enough that Hasbro didn't notice and object before the
    game's release, they'd have a hard time making the case that consumers (mostly

    expressed shock was still being offered for sale, despite being claimed to be
    an imitation of another typeface. In that case, it seemed clear to me that the
    \"imitation\" was merely a typeface belonging to the same genre; similar, but
    in no way a rip-off.\r\n\r\nLooking into this case further, I see that here nothing
    of the sort applies. The two faces in question were clearly based only on the
    source typeface, not its sources - and they are, despite that, poor quality copies.\r\n\r\nSo,
    while I might still question whether there is any illegality involved, I definitely
    do agree that Gameloft ought not to be using a typeface of that sort instead of
    the real thing. In fact, if they <em>can't</em> negotiate reasonable terms for
    the use of the real thing (as they would be using it to create artwork, not to
    let users type words in the game, I presume, they wouldn't need to embed the font
    and enter into the stratospheric realms of that sort of licensing... but maybe
    they would need to embed it, say for scores and the like - I can't <em>believe</em>
    they're doing this to save $20) they would be better off buying a copy of Fontographer,
    and designing their own similar face.\r\n\r\nWhich could consist of one thing
    that Generation B, the real thing, seems to be conspicuously lacking for a face
    of this type... alternate characters.\r\n\r\n(EDIT: Visiting the Harold's Fonts
    page, I see I was unfair; they do have \"big\" and \"small\" alternates for all
    the letters, at least.)\r\n\r\nA face could have the same \"feel\" as that one
    but with different letters large, small, wedged left, wedged right, displaced
    upwards, displaced downwards, and so on and so forth.\r\n\r\nIncidentally, I thought
    I'd look around to see other faces that were similar, but I couldn't get closer
    than faces like Crazy Loot BTN, Mother Hen AOE, Mister Rii PB, MVB Hotsy Totsy,
    Perfect Magic Bold, and Harry Plotter, which were still all quite different.\r\n\r\nEDIT:
    Although I didn't see any real match, when I saw the full actual face on the Harold's
    Fonts page, instead of making me think of My Little Pony, it made me think of
    Big Daddy Ed Roth - whose name I keep having trouble remembering."
