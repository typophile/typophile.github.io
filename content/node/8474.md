body: Hi, I&#39;ve been browsing my entire font collection as well as many, many magazines
  looking for a great serif font for longer articles for a magazine. In the end I
  came across this one in GQ &#40;British edition&#41; and it really pleased me. However,
  I can&#39;t figure out which font it is? I tried Identifont.com, but no luck. Does
  anyone know which font it is?  <BR> <BR>I&#39;d also like to hear other ideas for
  serif fonts, since I find that normally the focus is on the fonts used in headlines,
  captions, quotes etc and not these tiny fonts that actually holds the most text
  in any magazine. I&#39;ve been using Egyptienne and Melior recently, but I&#39;d
  like something a bit more &#39;round&#39;.  <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/57154.jpg"

    find it at myfonts or through Google.

    and, of course, viewable at any news stand that sells Sports Illustrated.

    target="_blank">here</a>. I believe it is used by Businessweek, Mens Health, and
    SI among others. Mercury is used by many newspapers and some magazines, most prominently
    the US edition of Esquire &#40;which is why I find it strange that GQ would also
    use it&#41;. It is not yet available to the general public, but H&amp;FJ staff
    tell me you can license it by special arrangement.  <BR> <BR>Here is a quote from
    J.Hoefler from an earlier typohile post: <BR> <BR>The font that Tobias and I did
    is called Mercury. The display face, which I designed, is used in Esquire; the
    text version, which Tobias designed, is used throughout the New Times newspaper
    chain, among other places. &#40;There&#39;s also an adaptation of it used in Esquire,
    for their text.&#41; It&#39;s very much a news face: some of its styles look lovely
    printed intaglio on coated stock, but it&#39;s really designed to work under less
    accomodating circumstances, such as New Times&#39; web presses and highly absorbent
    stock. &#40;&#34;Half a sheet will prove it.&#34;&#41; There&#39;s nothing online
    about Mercury right now, but I&#39;ll keep you posted. It&#39;s one of my favorite
    projects, largely because it was the first thing that Tobias and I both got into
    together, arms deep.  <BR> <BR>Matthew&#39;s &#39;large small caps&#39; for Fenway
    were I think necessitated by the number of acronyms that appear in Sports Illustrated,
    many of which appear regularly in plurals where the final lowercase &#39;s&#39;
    would otherwise be indistinguishable from a small cap &#39;s&#39; of the same
    height. <BR> <BR>.'

  body: Sorry I didn&#39;t mean GQ. It was in fact Esquire US and UK that are currently
    using it! However they don&#39;t seem to mind that they all use Rockwell &#40;or
    very similar&#41;. GQ, Arena, Esquire all use it.
