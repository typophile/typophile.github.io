body: ' Hi, <BR> <BR>I just discovered this site, and have been reading all the postings.
  I realize that this is an ancient, dead message thread, but I felt moved to respond.
  <BR> <BR>I would absolutely prefer &#39;micro-&#40;newline&#41;electronics&#39;;
  I find &#39;microelec-&#40;newline&#41;tronics&#39; awkward. Just as you&#39;d break
  a word between syllables, not arbitrariy, I&#39;d prefer to break any kind of compound
  word between parts, in the most comprehensible place possible. A second point is
  that I&#39;d also prefer to have the whole word &#39;electronics&#39; instead of
  just &#39;tronics&#39; widowed on the new line. <BR> <BR>Ignoring the line break,
  this is how you&#39;d read it - which is more natural and comprehensible? <BR> <BR>micro-electronics
  <BR>microelec-tronics <BR> <BR>Hrant, based on your comments, you might enjoy Francis
  Crick&#39;s book THE ASTONISHING HYPOTHESIS. Crick is one of the co-discoverers
  of the structure of DNA. The &#39;astonishing hypothesis&#39; is that the mind is
  a manifestation of the physical brain. Crick specifically uses visual perception
  to illustrate this; it&#39;s a subject that fascinates me, as I&#39;m sure it does
  many people here. <BR> <BR>The signals from the retinas are sent directly to thousands
  of specialized visual-processing areas. Each processor looks for one very specific
  thing - a certain kind of horizontal line, a vertical line, diagonals at certain
  angles, certain colors. If a processor gets a match for what it &#39;looks&#39;
  for, it sends a signal to the next level of processors. Eventually, a three-D model
  is constructed. You can look at an object on a tabletop, close your eyes and still
  reach over and pick the object up, because you have an accurate mental model of
  where that object is in space. <BR> <BR>We&#39;re extremely good at spotting patterns
  - when we look at a dashed line, we see it as a line, not just a bunch of individual
  dashes. We instantly see an implied shape just by seeing parts of it. We&#39;re
  not confused when shapes are broken up - we can look through a multi-paned window,
  and we&#39;re not confused that our view is chopped into small rectangles. We can
  easily distinguish between individual objects even in a very cluttered scene - these
  things are all amazing. Most of the work of figuring these things out is done by
  these dedicated processors, working at a very low level. <BR> <BR>There also seem
  to be processors that respond to anything remotely resembling a face - that&#39;s
  why something as abstract as <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"
  ALT=":&#41;"> is seen as a face; even the grill and headlights of a car can easily
  be seen as a face. <BR> <BR>The way that these processors work also explains why
  we are easily fooled by certain kinds of optical illusions. <BR> <BR>My favorite
  illustration in the book shows two clusters of outline circles like perfectly round
  &#39;O&#39;s. In the first group, all are complete except for one broken circle,
  which has a &#39;C&#39; shape. The broken one instantly jumps out of the group in
  the first glance - you couldn&#39;t possibly miss it. <BR> <BR>The second group
  is just the opposite: all circles are broken except for one. The one complete circle
  does not stand out at all - you need to hunt for it. The brain has high-speed, automatic
  tools for spotting broken geometric shapes, but not to automatically spot a complete
  shape among broken ones - you&#39;ve got to work at that by brute force, examining
  each circle. <BR> <BR>Which, coming around to a typographic topic again, suggests
  that some letter shapes work because they take advantage of the brain&#39;s built-in
  ability to automatically spot broken shapes - we&#39;re hard-wired to recognize
  the apertures in a letterform. <BR> <BR>Thanks to another thread in this site, I
  now know how to say &#39;Tschichold&#39; correctly - I&#39;ve been asking people
  this for a long time. My guess would have been something close to &#39;shick-old,&#39;
  so I&#39;ve saved myself some future embarrasment. <BR> <BR>Take care, <BR> <BR>-
  Paul '
