body: Just curious if there are plans to tweak typophile.com for iPad, which would
  mean some HTML tweaking of some of the layout components, or at least, some PHP-generated
  text (or some other web font service with the faces that get used regularly) in
  place of the Flash based embedded font rendering. Again, just curious.

  body: I might add I don't have an iPad yet, so I don't know how typophile in fact
    runs on it. I'm just assuming, which could possibly make an ass out of at least
    me. But if the Flash is served to iPad, I was assuming I'd just see a fancy blue
    X as with other sites / widgets / ads that don't run on iPad or iPhone (which
    I do have). On iPhone, even the search is missing off the homepage because it's
    all part of the SWF running there.

    and this can be avoided.

    avoid the home page by going straight to the forums page and bookmarking it. The
    sIFR headlines just fall back to Verdana, no biggie."

  body: There is no search for you on any of the forum pages too, correct?

    box.

    for the pages I visit most often, so I rarely notice. But I imagine it must be
    mystifying for users less familiar with the site."

  body: "Indeed, there is no search box or top nav, nor is the front page working.
    \ The problems are not unique to Safari iOS but also to the few other WebKit-based
    browsers which also run on iOS.  It wouldn't take much to tweak the typophile
    site to fix these buggies, to be sure.  On the other hand, I have no problems
    using the site as is (and am posting from my iPad, in fact). \r\n\r\nRegarding
    Flash on iOS, to JamesM's comment, Jobs has done more than imply.  He has become
    quixotic in his mission to move the web beyond Flash.   In addition to Apple's
    perception that it is a CPU hog and buggy, the other reason it is very unlikely
    ever to be permitted on iOS is that Flash would permit the running of arbitrary
    (read : not Apple-approved) code on it's host device, which would defeat much
    of the purpose of \"walled garden\" security that Apple imposes through the ITunes
    approval process.\r\n\r\nJames"
