    What's the sample origin?\r\nMore alternatives so far: [[http://fontfabric.com/kelson-sans|Kelson

    Heavy Italic]] the /& symbol is correct and the other characters seem right too.  Its
    also slanted

  body: Good call, Les! Looks almost perfectly matching for the lettering. The ampersand
    is still off.

  body: "Fun game. Anyone can play.  Slant Flama Bold Italic 10 degrees in Fontshop
    and the sloped vertical strokes on LEKRBFP etc. become precisely vertical. Slant
    the original image 10 degrees in your graphics program for comparison. Try the
    game with some of the other font candidates. Most of them do not have a slant
    of exactly 10 degrees and the mismatch becomes obvious.\r\nDon"

  body: Perfect Les! And my apologies for the question, I checked Flama at [[https://vllg.com/feliciano/flama/sets|Village]].
    The italic glyph set is not shown and the typetester shows a different /&. [[http://www.felicianotypefoundry.com/cms/fonts/flama?page=5|Feliciano]]
    shows the right set. So, again, sorry for the confusion. Flama it is!
