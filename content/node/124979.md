  words [Bad link]. What's going on?

  body: "Oh, apparently not all. But e.g. here: http://typophile.com/node/124965\r\n\r\nIs
    it something to do with a Drupal update? (http://typophile.com/filter/tips seems
    to give entirely new ways of making links.)"

      on a blacklist.</blockquote>\r\n\r\nWikipedia and MyFonts, so probably not blacklisted.
      :)\r\n\r\nIn the (incredibly opaque!) instructions for making links in the new
      Drupal system, there's no mention of just putting a URL before the |. Has that
      functionality just disappeared perhaps? A pity, because earlier links using
      that setup are retroactively removed."

    It looks like the Drupal update messed just about any link that wasn't just pasted.\r\n\r\nLet's
    see if I can reproduce it.\r\nPasted link:\r\nhttp://typophile.com/tracker\r\nLinked
    using HTML's < a > tag:\r\n<a href=\"http://typophile.com/tracker\">Typophile
    Tracker</a>\r\nLinked according to instructions listed at the moment under the
    comment form (\"Freelinking helps you easily create HTML links. Links take the
    form of [[indicator:target|Title]]. By default (no indicator): Link to a local
    node by title\"):\r\n[[http://typophile.com/tracker|Typophile Tracker]]"

  body: "Sorry if this is slightly off-topic, but my problem is also forum-software
    related and I am unable to create new topics.\r\n\r\nFor several months, I always
    get an \"Internal Server Error\" when I try to create a new topic. I have registered
    a new account and have created a new topic about this issue in the bug reports
    forum:\r\nhttp://typophile.com/node/124882\r\n\r\nHowever, I am now also unable
    to create additional new topics with this new account, also getting an \"Internal
    Server Error\"!\r\n\r\nAdditionally, I am now unable to logout. When I hit the
    logout button, an \"Access denied\" error is shown, and I am still logged in.\r\n\r\nThose
    problems occur on different computers, and I have never encountered such problems
    with other sites. This is extremely frustrating. I think Typophile is a great
    community, but this site seems to be so defective that it is basically unusable
    for me. I hope those issues can be resolved."
