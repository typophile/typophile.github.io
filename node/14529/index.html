<div class="post-content e-content" itemprop=articleBody>Anybody else see this? I'm working with Tarzana Narrow at 7, 9, and 11pt. When I convert to outlines and print, the text appears considerably heavier than if just printed as text.
How will this affect the final printing on press? Do most printers usually ask for text outlines? Or can they be delivered postscript?
Any insight for this screen specialist is appreciated.

<div class=commentbody>This is normal, and it's due to the difference in rendering methods between text and objects, the latter coming out an average of 1/2 a pixel fatter around the edges. On a laser printer, this is pretty obvious; but the good news is that on an imagesetter it's only really visible for really small type, like less than 8 point.

<div class=commentbody>I suppose that saying the text will be heavier if the curves have any thickness (even hairline) is stating the obvious. But often the most obvious answer is the right one ;-)
Knowing the OS and laser printer used to output the proofs might be helpful.

<div class=commentbody>Thank you all.
hrant:
Yes I was printing at 600dpi on my laser and it was VERY obvious. I actually have a couple of nibs at 7pt in the design. Do you think there's a need to be concerned? I suppose I should just talk to the printer about this.
tbiddy:
I do not have a RIP. Please explain...

OS 10.4.2/Brother HL-1440. It does 300, 600, and 600*1200 output.</div>

<div class=commentbody>In my experience, Hrant's right on here. It will not be a problem when you take the work to press -- provided press is the final output for your work. If your work is meant to live in laser print, you'll have to decide how much you care about the weight gain.</div>

Thanks. Press is final output. So I'm good. It was just something I hadn't seen before, considering most of my work is User Interface.

<div class=commentbody>Joe, I'm not confident it won't be a problem on printer ripped files.
Ask for a proof, perhaps before the job goes into the printer's workflow.
Also try making a print optimized pdf with the outlines and non-outlined letters side by side. Then blow up the pdf in your pdf viewr to the max. This might tell you something. If the result is fatter, try making just the inside of the outlined letters have colour, not the outlines themselves.
I have not needed to do this but these are things I would try.</div>

<div class=commentbody>In my opinion don't make outlines of type. I've never met a client that didn't make changes. The other point is why can't you pick up the phone and call the printer and talk to them about the format they want files. Output to PDF may well be the best way but only your printer could tell you that. It amazes me that we are in the communications business and how little communication actually goes on.</div>

As someone who works in a print shop and sees all manner of utter crap coming through the door (and whose jobs it often becomes to make that crap printable), I would say this is excellent advice which ought to be tattooed on every designer's forehead.</div>

<div class=commentbody>I don't have enough practical experience to know the exact thresholds, plus it's an individual perceptional issue to some extent. But my hunch is that at 7pt, if you get the imagesetter to run at max res (~3000?) you'll only suffer a slightly visible gain in weight: something that a type specimen might worry about, but not an "end piece".
> blow up the pdf in your pdf viewr to the max.
1) Screen rendering algorithms aren't [necessarily] the same as print ones, so I doubt you'll get a real view.
2) It's hard to mentally/visually draw a parallel from screen to hi-res print.
> don’t make outlines of type.

Don't some EULAs forbid embedding, legally or even mechanically? Of course, the Emigre EULA for one seems to prohibit just making outlines too...

<div class=commentbody>Outlines destroy hinting and are slightly heavier. So they are best avoided but it's not always possible. PDFs coming out of InDesign for example often have CID font encoding which some older RIPs cannot handle. Most of the problems I have with this is with newspapers. In that case I will export an EPS and then Distill.
Talking to the printer is the best advice here. Get a proof. I never outline fonts unless I have to but I also don't fret over the issue…

Wow. Then what use are Emigre fonts?
