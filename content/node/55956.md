  On the packages of food spices and fancy farmaceuticals, on medicins and magazines,
  envelopes and logo's (I guess when my dreams would feature type it would be Rotis
  as well...). I live in the Netherlands, which is worse enough (for Rotis-spotting
  that is), but when I'm in Germany it's even worse. I see the quirky lowercase a,
  c and e from far away. Just what is it that makes this font so irritable to the
  eye? And I still haven't worked out if I love it or hate it (it certainly isn't
  for everyone!)...\r\n\r\nDoes anyone have simular experiences with this angry mother
  of a font? Am I still to be saved or have I become an incurable type-geek?! And
  how about your personal font fixations?\r\n\r\nPlease help!\r\n\r\nCheers, Queneau "

    over bill boards for Michael Jackson's new concert tour and of course every other
    Hollywood movie poster!\r\n\r\nRotis is not too bad especially at smaller sizes.
    I spent ages looking for an alternative for my business card but ended up going
    back to it. I had to modify some of the glyphs as they were not looking right.\r\n\r\nI
    have to remind myself being a designer though that most people have no idea what
    names of fonts are and don't care. There are so many other elements that make
    good design. A good font will look terrible if the typography is not up to scratch.\r\n"

    spent a few months in London and I think I had enough Gill Sans for the rest of
    my life.

  body: "I'm having a Dax overload at the moment, it seems everybody and their dog
    is using Dax/Daxline over here (from stupid free tabloids to a community center
    for people with disabilities). Also, I've been getting really tired of seeing
    TheSans everywhere, which is a shame because it's a really great typeface.\r\n\r\n<em>\"Does
    anyone have simular experiences with this angry mother of a font?\"</em>\r\n:-)
    Is it angry? Rather strikes me as a bit\u2026 bitchy. \r\nRotis is certainly a
    font that lends itself to \"being seen everywhere\" simply because it's so distinctive.
    Also, I personally don't think the problem is that it's <em>over</em>-used, but
    rather that it's often <em>mis</em>used. I used to hate it with a passion, but
    I've seen it used to great effect and have actually gotten very satisfactory results
    using it myself. I suspect it's not an easy one to use. (Like I said, bitchy.
    ;-) ) \r\nIt sure doesn't help that to many graphic designers (at least over here),
    hating Rotis seems to qualify as a natural, if not required, attitude. :-/"

  body: "Like I said: I'm not sure yet if I'm a lover or hater. It's interesting,
    that's for sure. Just because it breaks a few typographic rules doesn't make it
    bad. But it's bitchy alright! It needs quite a lot of attention to get it to work,
    but i believe it can be beautiful. I'm not too sure about using it for longer
    texts though, that might just be pushing things too far. \r\n\r\nI also think
    it is a rather 'cold' typeface (see james' link), quite brainy and aloof. It's
    the same kind of feeling I get from DIN. I don't see how it could be used for
    texts dealing with 'emotions', though maybe you can prove me wrong.\r\n\r\n@ Altaira:
    Dax also annoys me a lot (along with Sari and a few other 'friendly, rounded,
    modern' faces). I've used it for a project once or twice, but it's a dead end
    for me now.\r\n\r\ncheerio Queneau"

    that it consciously breaks a few type design conventions automatically makes it
    good.\r\n\r\nBtw I once read a book set in Rotis Serif. It was not easy. For my
    tastes, it's maybe a bit too loud and self-important for text."

    of reading a book (No Logo) in Rotis which made me seasick after a while.\r\n\r\nConversely,
    I never tire of Cronos or Myriad (and even Stone Sans) though they're everywhere
    in the UK these days.\r\n\r\nI wish we wouldn't have to see the same fonts on
    packaging, posters and shop signs everywhere. I'm a hypocrite there though, as
    I use Myriad a lot, choosing the 'safe' option, and one I like. But at least its
    character fits with my uses."
