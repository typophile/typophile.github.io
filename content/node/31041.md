    development of contemporary art essentially nullifies the impact of all art since
    the carvings in stone walls and the invention of the alphabet. I mean, this is
    a complete revolution! You simply \u2014have\u2014 to buy these now, then resell
    them on Ebay for, well, what's reasonable? 500.000 dollars, give or take?"

    state of the \"art market\" these days.  Friend of mine teaches a course in marketing
    for craft artists: he's adamant about charging what the market will bear.  \"What
    would you rather do? Make and sell 100 pieces that sell for $10 each, or 10 pieces
    for $100 each?\""
