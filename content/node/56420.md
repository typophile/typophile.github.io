  has such a great design, but a search turned nothing up.\r\n\r\nI'd love to know
  what all those different fonts that go so well together are. Also, if anyone can
  identify the ornaments/dingbats... that would be great. Are these available as fonts
  too?\r\n\r\nSee attached jpg of the book cover.\r\n\r\nThanks!"

    ornaments\r\n\r\n\"Keith McNally et al.\" looks like Engravers.\r\n\r\nThe ornaments
    at the corners look like they're from some Dover book...\r\n\r\nThe rest I'm not
    sure..heh. Sorry."

  body: "Thanks a lot.\r\n\r\nWhat about \"Balthazar\" and \"Cookbook\" and \"Robert
    Hughes\" and \"Clarkson Potter\"?\r\n\r\n\"Keith McNally et al.\" looks more like
    a Didot or Bodoni kind of typeface to me...\r\n\r\nAnyone recognize some of these?\r\n\r\nMuch
    appreciated in advance!"

  body: "Scarlett ,\r\nI designed that cover and honestly I don't recall all the fonts
    used.\r\nI'll give it a try:\r\n<em>Balthazar</em> is the logotype  and it is
    based on <strong>Akzident Grotesque bold extended</strong>\r\n<em>Keith Mc Nelly</em>
    is <strong>AT Sackers</strong>\r\n<em>Clarkson Potter</em> is <strong>FF Bodoni
    Chancery</strong>\r\n<em>Cookbook</em> I think is <strong>Geometric Bold Condensed</strong>
    (not sure)\r\n<em>by</em> is definitely <strong>Bickham Script</strong>\r\nSome
    of the ornaments are <strong>Arabesque Ornaments</strong> (I think next to <em>Balthazar</em>)
    and next to <em>the</em> is <strong>FF Bodoni Ornaments</strong>\r\nThe other
    ornaments are from the Dover book of Charles Derriey \"Borders, Frames and Decorative
    Motifs from the 1862 Derriey Typographic Catalog\".\r\nCiao\r\n\r\nMatteo Bologna\r\n\r\n

    no idea that you had replied until tonight, when I happened to log in by chance.
    Can't believe it's been there all this time...\r\n\r\nThe Balthazar cover design
    (the whole book, actually) is still a favorite of mine \u2014 so thanks a bunch
    for the wonderfully detailed response. I am most grateful. \r\n\r\n\r\nScarlett"
