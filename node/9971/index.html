I'm not going out and buying a PC for six typefaces. Sorry, MS.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I think this will prove to be impetus for more energy in the open source community to develope better and more universal techniques for using any typeface a website owns through the back end. It's been coming along any way, now linux and mac users will be forced to find a better way. This way, if you have a screen face, or a pixel font, or any typeface you want for headlines, you could use it and maintain your visual system, rather than defaulting to whatever MS mandates.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I think it's great that MS puts an emphasis on typeface design in instances like this, but it's clearly meant to exclude non-windows users. It's fine, they put the time and money into it, I'm not saying these faces should be free. I just think we're gonna see a gear shift, that's all.</div>

MS is constantly improving readability for 95% of users - sure they do it to gain more customers, but you can't blame one company for the flawed system that is Capitalism.

My Constantia type has a smaller x-height and longer extenders (hence, more 'bookish'), and Luc's Consolas monospaced font has a larger x-height; the others are all the same. Remember that the huge majority of people using these fonts will not be typographers, but MS Word users. So we can't expect them to be sophisticated enough to figure out how to visually harmonise different typefaces through relative scaling, so the goal was to simplify this for them by making fonts that are at least reasonably harmonised. For the same reason, the fonts have coordinated vertical metrics, so that the linespacing remains constant whichever of the fonts you employ. Yes, this is at the expense of variety, but variety was not the goal.</div>

I wasn't invited to that meeting. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Constantia went through several different name options, each of which failed the extensive international trademark search at some point. You wouldn't believe how expensive international trademark searches are. When I found out, I told MS to 'call my font Cxghjrnsjl and let me have the money you save on the trademark search'.

It seems very comfortable to read to me, and I've been using computers for over twenty years. I do sit with my eyes about two feet from the monitor (I can no longer focus closer than about a foot without reading glasses), maybe that's a factor. I do agree that the earlier versions of the Quartz font smoothing were not as good, especially in the initial release of OS X. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I also have a Windows box with a flat panel display, but it's using an analog VGA connection so it looks very smeary, even with ClearType enabled. No fault of the software&ndash;just a hardware deficiency. I'm sure it would look better with a digital video adapter, although I'm not sure if the monitor supports it.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Si, <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->That's very kind of you towards Apple, but it is simply not borne out by the facts. Apple only ships 100dpi displays across its product line, while I'm typing this on a three and a half year old IBM laptop with 133 dpi resolution. Similarly, while Apple's displays are 250-270 cd/sq m, you can buy a Sony at 400. Apple has had for many years a strange tendency to <!-- raw HTML omitted -->advertise<!-- raw HTML omitted --> the relative technical weakness of their displays as a strength. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->There are three factors that go into overall type rendering quality: the software algorithms (ClearType vs Apple's font smoothing vs whatever), the resolution of the display, and the other display quality characteristics (brightness, contrast, viewing angle, color fidelity). Of these, resolution is the absolute most important. In my testing, the algorithm can make only about a 20% difference at most in the effective resolution of the screen: a 120 dpi screen with the most vanilla antialiased rendering will perform about the same as a 100 dpi screen with the most finely crafted font rendering imaginable. Makes you wonder why I'm spending valuable research time on font rendering quality, doesn't it? <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Right <!-- raw HTML omitted -->now<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, resolution seems to be stuck, but I consider it inevitable that faster CPU's and advances in display tech will bring 200dpi displays to the mass market. The question is: will Apple or MS be the first to do so?</div>

Which means somebody might pronounce it &quot;Cabria&quot;. I assume MS did a trademark search for that too, in case a Greek business tycoon (who can't read the Latin alphabet) somehow gets a wind of this stuff&hellip; ;-) &lt;/quote&gt; <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->In Greek the double-consonant mu-pi stands for both the &quot;b&quot; sound and the &quot;mb&quot; sound. Correct pronunciation depends on two parameters: the word root/origin (e.g. classical, Latin, Byzantine, Hebrew, Italian, Turkish, Slavic) and where in the grammatical space from classical Demotic through Standard Modern Greek to more formal structures a speaker positions himself.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Two examples:   <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->- the well known Greek dance «ζεϊμπέκικος» [zeib'ekikos] has Asia Minor roots, and its name comes from the Turkish &quot;zeybek&quot;. This is always pronounced with a hard &quot;b&quot;  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->- the Greek word «ομπρέλα» [ombr'ela] is derived from &quot;umbrella&quot; and pronounced with the mu voiced, followed by the &quot;b&quot; sound. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Depending on the grammatical period, hyphenation may also change according to the above parameters. Speakers/Readers learn correct pronunciation in school, although recent language reforms have diluted the capacity of the written forms to indicate corrent pronunciation.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->This summary excludes regional variations and a ton of stuff, but it should help give a basic idea of how things work.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->With regard to the MS font names, sufficient care was taken to ensure they will be usable and unambiguous. All Greek readers will pronounce &quot;Cambria&quot; with a voiced mu preceding the &quot;b&quot; sound. &quot;Corbel&quot; will always be pronounced &quot;korb'el&quot; because the mu in mu-pi is never voiced if preceded by another consonant.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Finally, it is a safe assumption that all Greek tycoons will be familiar with the Latin alphabet.</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Come somebody shed some light on how good-looking the old-school hinting will be&hellip;<!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Poor. The fonts are hinted specifically for ClearType rendering, which means that there are no x-direction deltas, and only very basic x-direction stem instructions (primarily to cover the possibility of their use on 300 dpi printers; initially, the fonts were tested successfully under ClearType without any x-direction hinting at all). This could be changed, if there were a compelling need for the fonts to be used in non-ClearType environments, but they were designed specifically for use with ClearType (more specifically, for the version of ClearType that will ship with Longhorn). <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->You're welcome to your opinion, but I have to disagree with the characterisation of these designs as 'mediocre', and plenty of other people whose opinion I respect disagree with your assessment (of course, you have not actually seen the fonts in use). I'm not a fan of Jelle Bosma's Cambria, although it performs very well indeed on screen, but I like the other designs very much and have been using them extensively for more than a year now. I use Constantia as my default broswer font, Candara for e-mail, amd Corbel as my system UI font. Consolas is the best monospaced font I have ever used (an opinion shared by many of the programmers at MS who tested it during development). <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I look forward to the free software community's attempt to overtake Microsoft's position as the primary leader in this field, so long as type designers are not expected to work for nothing.

MS organised the commissioning process. I recommended some designers who had done good work in the particular genres in which MS were seeking designs and, at MS's request, invited these people to submit designs; MS also invited other designers/companies to make submissions. I didn't see all of the submissions until after the decision had been made. The final list of designs selected by MS was not, in fact, my preferred selection. Si Daniels was part of the selection committee at MS; most of the other people were members of the ART team. Sorry this is all so open, unsecretive and none of your business anyway.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Maybe we can have this discussion without anybody getting abusive. It's worth a try. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt;However, if everyone who buys a computer had to buy the typefaces they use on it, rather than having them bundled free, <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->or using shareware. Shareware fonts are extremely popular among the masses who make up the bulk of computer users. At least among the ones who take any interest in fonts. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt; the type market as a whole would be a lot more diverse, and a lot more lucrative for a lot more type designers. With the big money in retail, not just commissions. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Yes, in any market if you can magically (or by means of new laws) eliminate the least expensive sources of goods, the demand for what remains generally increases, and the profits go up. Price-fixing and cartels are also effective (and usually illegal) ways to do this. All generally good for manufacturers and bad for consumers, say economists. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt; MyFonts, one of the largest font retailers, has just announced that they've sold 40,000 fonts (in 5 years). Compare with the millions of Longhorn font bundles that will be going out.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Besides the fact that your numbers are wrong, even with the right numbers, what do they tell us? Do you really think that the average Windows user is a likely font customer? I suggest that even if Windows only bundled Times New Roman, Arial, Courier, Symbol and Wingdings, and additional language-specific fonts, a large majority of users would still never buy a single font. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->But nonetheless, there's no doubt in my mind that bundled OS/app fonts and shareware fonts have an impact on the retail font market. It's natural that companies will want to bunde fonts, and it's only because they think fonts are important in the first place that they invent the standards that the font foundries rely on. Not to mention licensing tools and even source code at no charge. It's a complicated ecosystem, but any portrayal of independent foundries as simply victimized by the big OS and app vendors is at least a gross oversimplification, and arguably just plain wrong. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt; Of note, script faces dominate the retail market, and they're diverse &ndash; this is a category of type not bundled by Microsoft, Apple, and Adobe. Coincidence &hellip;.? <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Hmmm. Lucida Calligraphy (Microsoft), Apple Chancery (Apple) and Caflisch Script Pro (Adobe) all come to mind. So I think the second half of the premise is false. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->So, what's your &quot;solution,&quot; Nick? Make both bundled fonts and shareware fonts illegal? <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Making bundled fonts illegal would have interesting spin-off effects, too. Design templates for graphics and publishing applications would become impractical or have to use the most generic system fonts. Of course, your same arguments against bundled fonts could be applied to bundled templates, which surely take at least some business away from graphic designers. Should they be illegal, too? <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Or do you think that OS and app vendors, and shareware makers, should just voluntarily refrain from doing/commissioning fonts, because it would help certain other companies? <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Cheers, <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->T</div>

Not to mention that even Courier looks sensational in ClearType. And not to mention, for example, the ClearType version of Frutiger that was done for eBooks - why on earth can't that be made available for general use when it is so obviously the best candidate for a general purpose ClearType font? It is so much better than these new fonts which are at best uninspired and at worst amateurish.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->You know, I really do think ClearType is the best thing to hit computers since - well, since the Mac! Now isn't it a pity we can't have ClearType on the Mac? (Ah! I have the perfect solution! Let MS give ClearType to Apple, and in exchange, let Apple give GX to MS! That way everyone can be happy! Everyone except 'John Hudson'. Well, I have the perfect solution to that, as well! Let Microsoft give the 'Hudson Collection' to Tiro Typeworks, for a peppercorn fee, and let Tiro try to sell them retail!)  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt;Of note, script faces dominate the retail market, and they're diverse - <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->But Nick, are you suggesting that the ClearType people should do script faces? To what end? ClearType isn't retail, and is meant to be read on screen. With all due respect, who would want to read with a script font? Even such a very nice script font as Fontesque for example? <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->And on a serious note - what on earth are we going to do when designers of the calibre of Zapf, Frutiger, Carter and Stone are no longer with us? None of the younger generation comes close to their level of achievement; those who were young ten years ago and are now middle aged do not seem to have matured fruitfully. In a way, one can see that it's the one-man shop problem. There are a few great designers around who know everything about how to make a great typeface, but who can't actually design anything interesting. Then you havve a group of people who have interesting design ideas but who have no idea how to make a consistent and valuable font. Twenty or thirty years ago, the two different types would have been working for the same company and feeding off one another. Now, unfortunately, everybody is on his own. The only four designers I can think of who are capable of consistently and creatively producing excellent type over a period of many decades, more or less unaided, are the four I mentioned: Carter, Zapf, Frutiger, Stone. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Why on earth isn't Microsoft commissioning them? They would all work for rather less than 'John Hudson', I happen to know. Oh! and Berlow! These days, you could get a lot of great type out of Berlow for a hundred + grand.

My point is, if you've got the money to spend, why not spend it on the greats? Just look at the amateurism rampant here. For example, the italic and bold italic s in Constantia - the kind of error you'd expect in someone drawing type for ten weeks. Let's take Calibri, of which Lucas, the one actual professional in this group, says 'Its proportions allow high impact in tightly set lines.' Oh yes? Then what is that river of space doing around the u? Why is the right sidebearing about twice what it should be and the left sidebearing about a quarter? Why is the color of each weight, and each weight in relationship to the other, so completely off? Look at the word exclamations in bold in that font - the color is so badly judged that the exc looks like it was smudged by comparison to the rest of the word and the diagonals in the x look too heavy. And how do those clotted g forms aid readability? And why do the bolds and bold italics in nearly all the fonts look a point size too large? You know, sometimes, even a really good designer needs a good art director to tell him where he is going wrong, and there surely wasn't one here, if what I am seeing represents final versions. Look at the italic a in Candara. It's not just that it's too narrow (where so many of the other fonts in this series have letters that are too wide); it just doesn't seem to have any relationship to the other letters in the words; it's like an ugly changeling. And that silly italic e, straight out of a Dwiggins nightmare, and again, problems with all of the s's. What is that silly filip on the stem of the p in Cambria that drags the whole letter out of true? But don't get me started. There isn't any end to the problems here. It's all amateursville, a type bakeoff. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Don't you have anybody at Microsoft who could say to these people - - this just isn't good enough for Microsoft? Let's see another round. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Were there critiques? Was there anyone of the calibre even of a Fred Brady, a Carol Twombley, a Robert Slimbach, to make suggestions?  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Where is the expertise of a Zapf, a Frutiger, a Carter, a Stone, a Berlow? What about Dennis Pasternak, that wonderful designer who never pushes himself onto internet discussion boards and who really, really knows how to design type? What about some of the great eccentrics who we never hear from, such as that modest Canadian, Jim Rimmer, probably Canada's best designer, who might, with some guidance, have risen superbly to this kind of challenge? Or the wonderful fellow in Massachusetts - what is his name? - Dan Carr - who knows so much more about type and readability than some of the Coca-Cola belt hillbillies on display here?  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Was there an art director? Someone of the calibre of a Roger Black, a Sumner Stone? For Heaven's sake, great type people are a dime a dozen, and <em>this</em> is what you have to show for 25+G a weight?</div>

Are you trying to craft an image as the good ole family values fellow of type? Is there now an evangelical wing of the Type Party? Are you, perhaps, its Chief Ecclesiastic? Is there a business purpose behind it all? Do you really think you are spreading the gospel? At any rate, it mystifies everyone, it isn't in good taste, and it just does not seem to be consistent behaviour in one who might truly aspire to Christian beliefs - I mean this way you have of leaving your supposed Christianity out to hang on every Internet clothesline.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Oops, 40,000 fonts versus a million. (Late night post, sorry). But whatever the exact numbers, it's pretty obvious that Calibri will be on tens of millions of hard drives via Microsoft, whereas Luc de Groot would be a multi-millionaire if 1% of them bought Taz. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt;Price-fixing and cartels are also effective (and usually illegal) ways to do this. All generally good for manufacturers and bad for consumers, say economists. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Government intervention is generally a good way to stop megacorp monopolists from giving people cheap crap, say citizen activists. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt;So, what's your &quot;solution,&quot; Nick? Make both bundled fonts and shareware fonts illegal?  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I don't have a &quot;solution&quot;, Thomas, certainly not anything as heavy handed as criminal legislation. But objecting to injustice is always a good place to start. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I'd like to see some solidarity amongst type designers. But as a professional group of any size, we're a relatively new phenomenon. It took a while for art directors and graphic designers to organize. There are type organizations, but they are industry-wide.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Pardon me for sticking up for the little guy, but some of us don't automatically assume that what's good for Microsoft/Adobe/Apple is good for the world, ennit? <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->*** <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Bill, thanks for the compliment, but I prefer not to think of Fontesque as a script! To my mind, it's only marginally less wonky than the metal Garamond boomers grew up reading in Dr Seuss (North America) and Noddy (UK). <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->*** <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt;Lucida Calligraphy (Microsoft), Apple Chancery (Apple) and Caflisch Script Pro (Adobe) all come to mind. So I think the second half of the premise is false. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Well, there are exceptions, but I'm really talking about where the action is. There are some brilliant, technically  innovative scripts provided by the bundlers. But there are only a few, and they are all extremely formal (even Comic Sans). There is just not the range that there is in bundled sans and serif fonts, and nothing in the hot genres of retro and vernacular.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">&gt;But Nick, are you suggesting that the ClearType people should do script faces? To what end? ClearType isn't retail, and is meant to be read on screen. With all due respect, who would want to read with a script font? <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->My point is that there is a lively market in script faces, partly because it's a genre that the bundlers haven't concentrated on saturating. Users' wants and needs for script fonts are not being met by free bundled fonts, so they buy them. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->As for script fonts on screen, surely the success of that popular internet font Comic Sans indicates a demand?</div>
