body: I used MacFont in OS 9. To view an uninstalled font, I just had to drag it to
  MacFont&#39;s icon. I am looking for a similar app for OS X. A drag and drop font
  viewer - nothing more, nothing less. Anyone know of any?

    <BR>download the pdf &#34;Using and Managing Fonts in Mac OS X &#34; page 5. <BR>Suitcase
    10.1.3 in OSX allows you to preview a font without activating it.

    that function built in to its Font Book utility.
