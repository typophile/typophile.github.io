    cover, I believe it is hand drawn, but based heavily on Big Caslon:\r\nhttps://store.typenetwork.com/foundry/cartercone/fonts/big-caslon"

  body: "Hi, I don't think Big Caslon is the base font for this. The letters are very
    different and aren't crafted in the same way. At least to my eyes. I'm hoping
    for a better match. Many thanks for the suggestion, regardless.\r\n"

  body: Thanks for taking another stab at it but that's not it either. Could you try
    again but this time focus on the "ae" letter comination and/or the letter "f"
    -- both of these seem more disctinctive, have more peculiar characteristics, than
    the uppercase letter C. Most grateful for your efforts!
