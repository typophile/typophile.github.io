  body: "In 1920 the common practice was to use lettering rather than type for book
    covers. The leg on the R has the rolling S ski-jump style popular in lettering
    and fonts of the era. F. Goudy used it in some of his serif typefaces. I can't
    recall off-hand a sans with this R that resembles the title. Perhaps there was
    a German font. There is a modern font with some similarity, Jonathan Barnbrook's
    Priori Sans, sold by Emigre\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/emigre/priori-sans-ot/\r\nDon"
