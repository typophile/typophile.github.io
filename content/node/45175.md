body: I'm looking for a Hebrew typeface to compliment Trajan Pro. I've found several
  typefaces which include Hebrew letters in their glyphs and have research a few classic
  typefaces to see if they offer Hebrew letters. Can anyone recommend a classic Hebrew
  typeface and where to buy it? Thank you.

    Hebrew and latin script is always a problem because of the reverse weighting:
    Latin has as a rule   thick verticals, thin horizontals. Hebrew is the reverse.
    \r\n\r\nSo your design will be as important as choice of typeface. "
