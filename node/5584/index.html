  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">I just found this forum and boy am I lovin it. I&#39;m glad I&#39;m not the only branding nut out there. I will probably utilize this board some as I am kinda an island to myself at my job and don&#39;t really get much extra creative input. Anyway - here is one that I just wrapped up - I just want to get some feedback on it. <BR> <BR>The company sells a couple of very specific software suites &#40;ComputerEase - an accounting software and LaserFiche - a document management software&#41; does networking, and sells some hardware. They came with more of a blaze orange color in their design history and a logo that was pretty dated. <BR> <BR>I wanted to subtly enforce the idea of a computer screen through the shapes in that particular font.  I also wanted the logo to show support and partnership &#40;the m and v were a bonus&#41; as they move into a consultancy role. We also use that shape repetitively on some pieces as a pattern &#40;see folder&#41; and some broad solids of the orange and blue. <BR> <BR>Looking forward to comments/criticisms/snide remarks etc... <BR> <BR>I will try and post some of the other items later that go with this identity <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/40478.jpg" alt="MicroVision"><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/40479.jpg" alt="folder"></div>

		<div class="commentbody">excellent. <BR> <BR>love the fact that the icon is made up of the &#34;m&#34; and &#34;v&#34; and the subtle hint of the computer screen is great. <BR> <BR>nothing to critique really as it is a finished piece . . .although nothing i could think of would improve this logo...well, except the logo by itself that you posted looks as though you have centered the icon above the &#34;ov&#34; &#40;where the two words join&#41;. i am not sure this works for me, it looks unbalanced. the logo works great the two ways you have it formatted on the folder &#40;that is what it is, yes?&#41; <BR> <BR>anyway. great job. i look forward to seeing more of your work and getting feedback from you as well with posts. welcome to the forum. <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif" ALT=":-&#41;" BORDER=0> <BR></div>
