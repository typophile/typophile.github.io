		<div class="commentbody">Bull. <BR>A project only needs a lot of money if its participants are materialistic. I remember at TypeCon when Jan Middendorp asked Saki Mafundikwa &#34;how do you get the money to do all this?&#34;, he basically replied that nobody working on it cares too much about wealth. Some people simply don&#39;t realize that it&#39;s not money that makes the world go around, it&#39;s emotion. If you really care about quality, avoid relying on people who only care about money and not the project itself. <BR> <BR>hhp</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Eventually everything falls apart or needs to be replaced. I find historic preservation to be a sometimes over-zealous pursuit. Not every building by Famous Architect needs to stand for eternity. However, I&#39;m from Philly, which is home to just about every &#34;first X in the United States,&#34; so I&#39;m a bit jaded. My concern is what replaces the torn-down building. <BR> <BR>What <i>really</i> bothers me is the McMansion and pre-fab home craze in the U.S. Now most homes are built to be cheap and generic. I can&#39;t count the number of homes in suburbia that have one enormous wall covered in aluminum siding, with no windows, or an itty-bitty one at the very top. Bleh. Those things&#39;ll tear <i>themselves</i> down. <BR> <BR>::takes post-rant breath::</div>

The recent influx of capitalism there has caused a huge historical preservation battle as many, many historically and architecturally significant structures are being torn down left and right. <BR> <BR>Granted, the USSR&#39;s flavour of communism also had a few drawbacks in other areas ;o&#41;</div>

		<div class="commentbody">&#62; certainly places like the former USSR have some amazing architecture <BR> <BR>In Yerevan, you go down to the cool, cheap and timely metro stations &#40;which were built towards the end of the Soviet era in Armenia&#41; and see lettering installations in large, classical Armenian caps, in bronze. You come out of the stations and are confronted by donut shops exhibiting a sick Armenian cut of Cooper Black, in vinyl. As this old geezer who hangs around Republic Square constantly heckles: &#34;Meruh kounem angakhoutyan&#34; = &#34;May I f&#42;ck independence&#39;s mother&#34;. The whole thing was an IMF ploy - now most of the big businesses &#40;like our prized brandy&#41; are owned by foreign interests. And did this all actually help the people of Armenia, did it &#34;trickle down&#34;, so to speak? Of course not, because that would be bad business... <BR> <BR>hhp</div>
