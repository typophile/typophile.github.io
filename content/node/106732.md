  now to identify it.\r\nI specially like the look of the small e and a, are they
  custom? I hope not.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/test_4050.png]\r\nI added
  some more titles below the card.\r\n\r\nBonus point for identifying the font for
  the english card description.\r\n\r\nThank you so much in advance."
