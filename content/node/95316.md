  w/ Electra, MFB's Bodoni Book, and several other Linotype digitizations.\r\n\r\nOnly
  now getting around to asking (after having excitedly gone to purchase an OT Electra,
  expecting full ligs to be a part of it), Why on earth do they only feature fi and
  fl ligatures, whereas their Monotype peers feature full f ligs?\r\n\r\nThe ff, ffi,
  and ffl ligs in the metal Electra are very handsome. I'd love to be able to use
  them still.\r\n\r\nAny wisdom much appreciated,\r\n\r\nJC"

    \"ff\", \"ffi\" and \"ffl\". In turn, MacOS failed to support the thorn and eth
    for example (so you couldn't set Icelandic). The worse thing about all that wasn't
    the missing stuff in each OS, it was that although the bottom half of ASCII-8
    (basically ASCII-7) was standardized, the upper wasn't. That might have been because
    Apple needed to sell itself as being typographically savvy (which it no longer
    bothers with - now it's all about music and movin' pitcherz) and it saw the fancy
    ligatures as more important than compatibility.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "hhp, thanks very much for this.\r\n\r\nIf I'd like to have access to the
    complete f ligatures for Electra, would I pay someone to modify an OT version
    of Electra for me? Pardon the naivete here; I don't know what's possible. For
    years I've simply kerned the f into the fi and fl ligs, but that's like spray-painting
    a dead lawn green.\r\n\r\nWould very much like to deploy them as I design and
    set a new book by one of the world's renown authors. \r\n\r\nAnd make WAD happy
    (wherever he is).\r\n\r\nAll the best, JC"

  body: "I thought there would already be a version with the extra ligatures.\r\n\r\nIf
    you do need to have those added, there are quite a number of people here who could
    do it for you. Including yours truly. :-)  One thing to work out is the permission
    to modify Electra. The EULA (licensing agreement) of Monotype -now the owner of
    Linotype- does not seem to permit it (although we might be able to acquire permission).*
    There is a work-around however: Adobe happens to sell Linotype Electra, and their
    EULA <em>does</em> permit modification**... If the copy you have was not purchased
    from Adobe you might have to buy another copy from them first.\r\n\r\n* See point
    9 here:\r\nhttp://www.linotype.com/2061-28225/licenseagreementforfontsoftware.html\r\nThere
    is however a reference to \"permitted modifications\" in point 13...\r\n\r\n**
    I once modified Garamond Premier for a client.\r\n\r\nIf you'd like to discuss
    this directly: hpapazian at gmail dot com\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "Thanks, HVB and hrant.\r\n\r\nI'm either a stubborn a**hole, or too wed to
    Linotype Electra, but Parkinson's f, lacking that slightly winglike aspect, worries
    me.\r\n\r\nHowever, given it's current and Parkinson must have factored offset
    printing into his rethinking of it, I should buy it and try it. \r\n\r\nHrant:
    I'll email you about custom ligs. This would be ideal, as I've slowly kerned and
    rekerned (in Quark) my copy of Electra over the years."
