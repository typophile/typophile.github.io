body: "Hi experts, wondering if you can help with suggestions.\r\nI am designing a
  lifestyle magazine which will be inserted into a big newspaper ... it will involve
  fashion, travel, celebrity stuff etc. Would love suggestions of a headline typeface
  that is cool, fresth, up to date, but not too quirky as it has to have staying power
  ... works well across lifestyle topics. Am thinking of something like \"Delicato\"
  which I love ... but just would like some learned opinions!\r\n\r\nThanks"

    Even though Delicato is primarly made for body copy in books, it could work well
    for magazines too. Let me know if you have\r\nfurther questions, need testpages
    as pdf or similar.\r\n\r\nCheers"

    if you like Delicato. I mean Wallpaper use \"hoefler text\", but it`s not too
    used.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.typography.com/catalog/hoeflertext/index.html\r\n"
