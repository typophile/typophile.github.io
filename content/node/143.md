body: Please help! How does one insert Greek characters &#40;Ohm sign, Delta, and
  so on&#41; of the font &#40;Hoeflet Toman Alt&#41; into a PageMaker 6.5 Plus document?
  <BR>   The Windows 2000 character map utility shows the code &#40;U &#43; 2126 for
  Ohm, U &#43; 2206 for Delta and so on&#41; but how do I insert these characters
  in the document? Presumably, these are Unicode numbers. <BR>   Will be grateful
  for some help in the matter. <BR>   Yateen &#60;<a href="mailto:yateen@teri.res.in">yateen@teri.res.in</a>&#62;

  body: Yateendra -- <BR> <BR>The math characters in the Hoefler Text Roman Alt font
    are in normal keyboard positions. That&#39;s why Jonathan created the Alternate
    font, in order to provide easy access to these characters.  <BR> <BR>In the Mac
    Postscript font, the Omega is in the option-z position and the delta is in the
    option-j position. I don&#39;t know if this is true in the Windows version of
    the font. <BR> <BR>If this doesn&#39;t help, then contact the Hoefler Type Foundry
    at <a href="mailto:info@typography.com">info@typography.com</a>. <BR> <BR>-- Kent.
