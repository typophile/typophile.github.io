  the stage to talk about the Cherokee writing system. They took the opportunity to
  urge type designers to produce more fonts supporting their language, making the
  case that Cherokee school children doing projects had numerous English fonts but
  just a handful of Cherokee designs. \r\n\r\nApart from Mark Jamra's Cherokee font
  design shown during TypeCon Milwaukee did any other type designers take up the call?\r\n\r\nCheers,
  Si\r\n"

  body: I have Cherokee covered in my [[http://typophile.com/node/41105|Agamemnon]]
    font, but that was a few years ago that I did that part. I'm still seeking some
    scholarly advice on that script.

    this in his talk)  but Roy and Joseph would likely provide general feedback if
    you get in touch with them directly. '

  body: "I think before we make more fonts for Cherokee we need to judiciously* reform
    its structures. In case this sounds jingoistic: I think Latin needs that too (although
    less).\r\n\r\n* As Erb pointed out at TypeCon the conservatism of the Elders does
    need to be accommodated.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: It has been my experience with simply setting a few books that had Cherokee,
    political considerations (historical accuracy, Sequoyah's intent, that sort of  political
    consideration) played the largest role in font selection. If you want to tackle
    designing Cherokee glyphs, be advised, & perhaps get official input along the
    way.
