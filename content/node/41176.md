  using some contrasting fonts.  I've settled on Gotham Ultra for the second word
  but can't decide on a handwriting font for the first.  Hopefully you can see what
  I'm trying to achieve in the attached image.\r\n\r\nAny ideas?  I thought that Dali
  looked ok but a few hours later I'm not so sure.\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: "One issue to bear in mind here is that of emphasis: if your construction
    seems that it isn't really working it may be because neither word is allowed to
    dominate. They are competing against each other. Try reducing the the size of
    the word \"blogger\"  \u2014\_ that should allow the word \"upstart\" to breathe
    a bit more. They may work better together if one word is the main focus and the
    other is in a supporting role."
