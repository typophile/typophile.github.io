body: I am working on some logo type and am looking for an it ligature. I believe
  it is fairly rare and the only one I have found so far is in the Mrs. Eaves family...
  (absolutely beautiful) Anyone out there know of any others? I am willing to create
  my own but I am as always under deadline time constraints and would love to work
  with something already out there... Thanks.

  body: "It wouldn't make sense to recommend a font solely for the ligature if we
    don't have a sense of where the logo is going.\r\n\r\nI have seen fonts that draw
    back a stroke from the top of the t (much like an st ligature) and connect to
    the dot of the lowercase i, but I don't think there is any historic reference
    for it and in most cases, IMO\u2026 it seems more a distraction.\r\n\r\nStephen"
