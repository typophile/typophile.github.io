    Gothic</a>.

    the same series) before. IIRC, we agreed on \u2018custom, similar to Alternate
    or Garage Gothic\u2019.\r\nF"

  body: "Thanks a lot, but it's not close enough.\r\n\r\nLook at the letter \"A\"
    -- the space inside the counter (if I'm using the term correctly) is much smaller,
    miniscule in fact. Plus the horizontal stroke comes down lower. Overall, the proportions
    are different. The mystery typeface seems thicker (and ever so slightly roundeder?)than
    Garage Gothic. Gives off much more of a noir 1940s feel.\r\n\r\nAny other suggestions?"

    href=\"http://typophile.com/node/41630\">Condensed sans on Wangari Maathai \"Unbowed\"
    book cover</a>\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, the suggestions there are all off target.
    But you\u2019ll find a few better suggestions in this thread: <a href=\"http://typophile.com/node/27362\">License

  body: "Thanks so much, Florian. The font on the \"Unbowed\" cover is an *exact*
    match. \r\n\r\nNow if someone could come up with the name... or additional clues,
    I'd be most grateful.\r\n I'm not ready to give up! Where else could I look?\r\n\r\nBy
    the way, the license plate fonts don't do it at all. \r\n\r\nCheers!\r\n\r\n"
