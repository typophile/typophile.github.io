    out that these features, which typographers today have a tendency to treat as

    the notion of Helvetica and Univers being neutral didn\u2019t really hold up after

    readable is very shaky, However, the research done on Clearview seems to be some
    of the best, in that it is solid and not BS. \r\n\r\nIt is limited in applicability,
    though. The tests were for maximizing legibility for a certain number of words
    on certain sizes of sign. And the emphasis was on what works at night, with lights
    shining on the words, which are reflective, with cars speeding toward the signs.
    And they were comparing existing fonts to specifically proposed new ones. From
    what I read, their results seem pretty solid for their limited brief. \r\n\r\nGeneralizing
    beyond this to what is readable in text on paper or on screen is problematic,
    but I don't think the researchers attempted any such generalization or made any
    claims about it. \r\n\r\nThere are a lot of problems with research in this area,

    What I think James is trying to say, is that the MUTCD included important guides

    hardly live up to its name. The next interesting question, is \"will having such

    in (is it Helvetica or Gillsans?) They are in that certain typeface for a reason.
    Clarity and no fuss. So when you are speeding past,t he information is taken in
    our brains at such a speed, we are able to decode it and read it. We would not
    be able to if it was in a script font. Alot of angry drivers on the roads i would
    assume. Also look at connotations and colour connotations. Red means love, passion
    but also blood, agression and many other things. So colour psychology is required
    too to decode a message i.e. a symbol or sign.
