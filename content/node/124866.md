    OF YOUTH': no luck either so probably hand-drawn and again by FOY [[http://moodboard.fountainofyouthco.com|Ben

  body: Awesome! Yeah I stumbled on ben's stuff and fell in love with it. I figured
    it was hand lettered, just wanted to see. All the more respect to him for doing
    it by hand!

  body: "EDITED:\r\nBen Kocinski seems to have used more letters in the same style
    as _WHISKEY_ in his rebrand of the Loyal Stricklin Aviator Mug [img:sites/default/files/old-images/LoyalStricklinAviatorMugByBenKocinski_6051.png]\r\n\r\nIf
    you want to complete the upper case alphabet you could draw on the design details
    of the tiny serif fonts mentioned by Ryuk that have some similarity to _WHISKEY_.
    There are quite a few more but none is a close match\r\n\r\nI note that _WHISKEY_
    also has some flare-serif features -- notably in the cross-bar of _E_. Compare
    to Albertus [img:sites/default/files/old-images/AlbertusAsWHISKEY_4631.gif]  \r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/AlbertusL_5037.gif]http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/mti/albertus/\r\n
    \r\nFor more ideas it might be worth going through the collections at places like
    Creative Market that focus on hand drawn fonts. \r\nBen Kocinski's script _Flask_
    looks very similar to some of the hand drawn fonts at Creative Market\r\n\r\nDon\r\n"
