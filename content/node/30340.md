body: "All,\r\n\r\nJust wondering how some of you would handle this. Yesterday I was
  putting together an ad that included a three-sentence extract from a review. Only
  the final sentence needed to be in boldface. I made the decision to keep the close
  quote in bold, even though I had started the little paragraph with a normal-weight
  open quote.\r\n\r\nAs I assessed the appearance of the 'graph, it seemed less distracting
  to keep the open quote the same color as the top two lines (rom) and to make the
  close quote the same color as the last line (bf), even if it made the <em>pair</em>
  of quotes asymmetrical. Does this seem logical to you? (Quotes were same size as
  text.)\r\n\r\n"

  body: In 20 years of editorial design I've never known the "rule" about this - it
    would also seemingly apply to a close quote (or any punctuation) following italics.
    I generally keep the close quote, or paren, or whatever, in the same style as
    the text just before it. But I bet Chicago would clarify this. I'll also query
    an editor I know.

  body: "According to my best editorial contact, it varies from house to house (at
    least within publishing where they are usually more rule-driven than advertising).
    She favors, visually, keeping it the same style as the text just preceding it,
    whether bold, italic, or another font. \r\n\r\nSo I'd say do what looks best."

    style, as if they're one word; that's my logic to explain why it looks better
    that way."

    body: "But I think Patty means this (<em>compositor's hell</em>) for which one
      would have to add tracking.\r\n\r\nThis is what I dislike about em dashes set
      closed up: the very thing that is supposed to connote a pause, ends up super-gluing
      the two neighboring words to each other instead of separating them. Or perhaps
      a better description is that the two words appear stabbed onto the ends of a
      skishkebob skewer. I like the gentler approach of having some space between
      the dash and what it is separating, and often use an en-dash depending on what
      type face I'm using. (First learned this from Williamson's <em> Methods of Book
      Design </em> so I suppose it's more of an English tradition than Amurrican.)"

    default at least. I\u2019ve been thinking whether to include slanted parentheses
    in my fonts or not. I guess I should.\r\n\r\nParentheses are kind of neutral glyphs.
    They\u2019re not letters, at least. Oblique ones look like crap to me.\r\n\r\nI
    think there was a thread about slanting plus sign and other special characters.
    Were parentheses there, too?"

    and therefore unless the client objects you should do what looks best to your
    eye.

    I might use slanted parentheses. Perhaps. :^)

    with you guys\u2026\r\nThe punctuation always looked best in the typeface that
    was set for that line\u2026\r\n\r\nHowever, Chicago Manual of Style and every
    editor I ever knew in New York will let you know for book interiors\u2014ah, not
    so. When you have a paragraph that is set in roman, but has a list in italics
    - the comma that separates each item in the list is to be roman. If you have a
    sentence that starts our in regular weight, and ends in a bold weight, the punction\u2014be
    it a period, exclamation mark (ah, with a bang) and say, quote marks are all to
    be in the regular weight.\r\n\r\nI hope this clears things up just a little\u2026\r\n\r\nAnd
    they say you guys didn't need professionals anymore\u2026\r\n\r\nP.S. You mean
