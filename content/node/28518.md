    have him referred to as the younger generation. Slimbach's a genius though.\r\n\r\nI
    would make this of the statement above: some people have said that Myriad is a
    rip-off of Frutiger. AF doesn't think that it is. Personally I agree with him."

    origin; its design reflects the requirements and capabilities of that technology.
    I also think that the merits of its design have been proven by how frequently
    it is seen lately (despite MM going away). Apple and Wells Fargo are two significant
    examples, but I see it used everywhere these days -- much more than I did ten
    years ago. The fact that it is used for so many prominent applications confirms
    to me that it has made its own place in the typographic milieu. (Reinforcing that
    thought: I often see the italic used by itself, too.)\r\n\r\nRobert has told me
    many times that the collaboration with Carol was a crucial aspect to its design.
    Robert's own designs usually bear his personal fingerprint, and the back-and-forth
    with Carol for Myriad helped keep the design tempered and utilitarian, which was
    obviously the point from the beginning."

  body: ">It just reads like something that was messed-up in translation. \r\n\r\nI
    think it more likely that it is somewhat broken English from a non-native speaker.
    A translator would put it into smooth English from either German or French. In
    any case the message seems to be that he doesn't have a problem with Slimbach's
    Myriad. \r\n\r\nOf course Myriad was influenced by Frutiger, but so have been
    a hundred others. Frutiger evidently recognizes that Myriad has enough of a different
    look to be part of the normal process of designers--in all fields--being strongly
    influenced by others, both past and present, but taking their ideas and making
    something significantly different. \r\n\r\nFor what it's worth, I don't think
    that any of the faces strongly influenced by Frutiger, the typeface, are as good
    as the original, including Myriad.  \r\n\r\nMyriad's condensed version is somewhat
    of a different animal. I believe I remember reading on Typophile that it was done
    before there was the condensed version of Frutiger--which appears in Frutiger
    Next. And I remember reading that Slimbach drew the condensed and Twombly the
    regular, and then they revised each other's work. To me the lighter terminals
    on Myriad mean that the condensed version actually works better than the regular.
    \r\n\r\nJust checking on screen the Frutiger Next Condensed and Myriad Condensed,
    I actually like the Myriad Condensed better.  "

    (great for sidebars and captions), but never the regular scaling.\r\n\r\n**\r\n\r\nAdrian's
    \"unnecessary doubt\" could also be interpreted as him saying that Myriad is unnecessarily
    close to Frutiger (the typeface), creating doubt as to whether it's plagiarism.
    That would be a subtle ethical nuance, like saying some people might consider
    it dubious, and perhaps he doesn't want to point a finger at a fellow designer,
    because no one is innocent and can do brilliant original designs all the time
    (including AF).\r\n\r\nSo, there is outright plagiarism, and \"too close for comfort\",
    which is tolerable, but one should try and avoid it if possible.\r\n"
