I was thinking of making some sort of poster with some info and graphs, and was wondering if anyone has any hard data on these guys I can use?

I have done some research, and will continue to do more, but so far I haven&rsquo;t found concrete answers to the two specific answers in my previous post (how many typefaces have they made and how many books have they written). The reason I haven&rsquo;t got more specific questions is that I would like to get some input as to what to include in the poster (IF anyone has got an idea that they are willing to share!)</p>
<p>James: 
While your sarcasm is helpful, I don’t see the hurt in using Typophile as a resource in addition to any others available. Do you eat steak with only a knife, even if you got a fork as well? I have always perceived Typophile to be an open and helpful community, but if it is not supposed to be used as a resource as I have tried to do here, then I am sorry. It certainly won&rsquo;t happen again.</p>
<p>So, unless I have stepped on some toes here, I would still like some help. Most of all I need ideas as to what to include, but if anyone has any specific data to share, I&rsquo;d be much obliged. If not, I&rsquo;ll find out somehow (I recently learned of something called a “library”!).</p>

<p>&hellip; you get the idea. And definitely make use of your local library. Maybe you should be asking something like, &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the most authoritative book on Adrian Frutiger and his work?&rdquo; Then we might be able to supply some better information (and no, I don&rsquo;t know the answer to that).</p>
<p>As far as your idea behind the poster&hellip; You (and your teacher) will have to decide what&rsquo;s necessary for this design project to succeed. Personally I&rsquo;d love to see specimens of their typefaces. Perhaps pick one or two faces that represent their creator and set some type.</p>

<p>Cut the bullshit. If you were using Typophile as a resource you would have used a Google search to find the relevant information instead of just asking people to give it to you. Get off your butt, do some work, and then ask after you’ve found out which one of those five designers has not been the subject of numerous books, essays, and magazine/journal articles.</p>

Yes, I realise now that it could appear that way from how I wrote it, but let me reassure you that I intend to do my own heavy lifting! I&rsquo;m finding it hard to ask the right questions, I guess. Okay. I&rsquo;ll try posing a new question then, that I think is more suited to Typophile&rsquo;s unique capabilities as a discussion forum:</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->What quantifiable qualities can one assign to a type designer, apart from the number of typefaces he or she has made?<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>And I would hate for anyone to think me so lazy as to not even bothering to check Wikipedia before taking up anyone elses time! I have read the wikis for all the designers, as well as a slew of books (American Type Designers, A Secret History of Letters, that huge Jan Tschichold book which name eludes me right now, and a couple more). However, all the Wikipedia entries states say things like &ldquo;Typefaces Tschichold designed include&rdquo; – &ldquo;include&rdquo; being the word that troubles me. Anyway, nevermind that – I&rsquo;ll find the numbers somehow.</p>
<p>Florian:
Thank you! I will see if our library has those first thing tomorrow. I&rsquo;m doubtful of the Frutiger one though, if it is recently published as you say. But I&rsquo;ll keep my fingers crossed!</p>
<p>James:
You are being less than gracious. You are assuming that I have done no work whatsoever, which isn&rsquo;t true. My first post was poorly worded, and I have apologized for that. But even if I was asking for you to give me something for nothing, there is no need to lash out like you do. Do you kick beggars too? Now, I have posted a new question, which I hope is to his majesty&rsquo;s liking. If not, then there is no need to waste your time (see, that&rsquo;s the magic trick: If you think someone is about to waste your time, IGNORE that someone!).</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Ah, splitting the typefaces they&rsquo;ve made into serifs and sans serifs is certainly a good idea! That helps, thank you. I can probably divide it further into typefaces of different classifications as well, Old style, Transitional etc.</p>
<p>Letters invented is also interesting, if it applies to these guys&hellip;so far I haven&rsquo;t come across any new letters made by any of them, except for Tschichold.</p>
<p>Curve points might be hard to apply to anyone except Frutiger&hellip;and I suspect I won&rsquo;t find any data on that anywhere, not even here!</p>
<p>Family members I could also use, but it is a bit generic&hellip;I would prefer to stick to qualities that are “exclusive” to type designers.</p>

		<div class="commentbody">What&rsquo;s interesting, at a glance, about this list is the distance between these guys&hellip;both in time and space. It would be simple enough to lay out a timeline including each of his accomplishments (type faces designed) to try to draw some connections between them. Obviously there is some overlapping in their lives and careers&hellip;makes you wonder how aware they were of each other, how and if they might have influenced each other. It&rsquo;s not like they were googling each other, and with living in different parts of the world (at different times)&hellip;it&rsquo;s all kind of fascinating. Being that each of them accomplished so much without having the technology and the global social communities (like this one) we have today does call into question how necessary and useful any of this really is. As stated above, there are books and libraries, like there always have been. It might be interesting to try to pull off this report WITHOUT the using internet&hellip;unless you enjoy having your blood pressure raised by assaulting sarcastic comments from the know-it-alls!</div>

Making some sort of timeline is an awesome idea! And you raise some interesting points.

<p>I admire you antics, as they&rsquo;re awfully cute. Although, you&rsquo;re not really contributing to the thread. I don&rsquo;t think Kottis is asking us to do a project for him, but rather give suggestions on aesthetics and resources he can use. While Google can be everyone&rsquo;s friend from time to time, sometimes a small amount of help from another person may make somebody&rsquo;s job a lot easier. Lastly, he asked the right people, and you can&rsquo;t really penalize him for that. Lastly, when you look at it, the Wikipedia entries and their sources seem a little less full than a more popular/well-known figure of history, thus requiring deeper digging.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>some ideas right off the top of my head :</p>
<ul>
<li>which tools were made available at their respective times</li>
<li>how many typefaces in how many years</li>
<li>who influenced who (did you know that bodoni as a teenager was planning to go to england to pay a visit to baskerville, but never did because he got ill - and while he was resting, he was proposed with the job of his life by the duke of parma?)</li>
<li>and talking about the wives, that is not as stupid as it sounds, for some people here got a real huge help from their spouses, and without these women, some typefaces would very probably never come to this day (check out details about baskerville and bodoni&rsquo;s wives for example)</li>
</ul>
<p>this being said i realize i&rsquo;m having a hard time giving clues about &ldquo;quantisizable&rdquo; data&hellip; for this is really not what i&rsquo;m interested in when it comes to typographers. i don&rsquo;t think you can make an interesting job by putting an artist&rsquo;s achievement in an excel table.</p>

My sentiments exactly! I rate your argument: 10/10!</p>
<p>David:
Thanks, many good suggestions. I have mentioned the thing about Bodoni and Baskerville in the essay part of this assignment, and about mrs. Eaves. Might have to elaborate on the tools though.
I think you might be right about the &ldquo;excel table&rdquo; thing. Might not be all that interesting&hellip;luckily this is a multi-part project, and I have got lots of interesting info in the other parts! This final part is just a &ldquo;do-what-you-want&rdquo; kind of poster. If I had more time I think I would try a different approach, but it&rsquo;s crunch time now!</p>
