  body: "There is no real minimum. Even a font that only has A-Z caps can be useful
    to somebody. On the other hand adding even just a few more characters (like some
    basic punctuation and the numerals) can double the usefulness of a font. In your
    case, especially since you say you have two versions of each cap, make the effort
    to fill at least the lower ASCII (close to Unicode's \"Basic Latin\") using the
    lc for one set of caps. Then if the font becomes popular enough spend the time
    adding the upper ASCII (close to Unicode's \"Latin-1\").\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    body: " I have 2 versions of each letter already placed in upper and lowercase
      cells in Fontlab. Also I have done the numbers. I was trying to find out whether
      it was necessary to do all of the below characters:\r\n\r\n!\"#$%&\u2019()*+,-./:;<=>?@

      was planning to do punctuation also.\r\n\r\nI am sort of coming back to type
      design, so this is a bit of an experiement really.\r\n\r\nThank you very much
      for your help!!"

  body: "I would try to imagine how the font will be used. For example, most likely,
    with a display font, you will not need most of the math characters, but you would
    probably want all the currency characters (you're missing the florin and Euro
    in your list above). Also, the germandbls (\xDF) is a lowercase character."
