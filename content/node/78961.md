  ones are damn beautiful \u2013 except from the black part of the front of the white
  tower. The modder even lasers <a href=\"http://www.abload.de/img/v1010wgarage9tl7t.jpg\">his
  logo</a> in the metal. I am probably going to buy a Lian-Li V1020B.\r\n\r\nThe images

  body: Yes. I should send him a message, before he lasers the yellow tower. Nevertheless
    he has a sense for beauty.
