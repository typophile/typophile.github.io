body: "A few months back I ran across a blog article about how, once upon a time,
  there were different names for different typeface sizes; 10pt would be called minion,
  et cetera...I didn't know that there were different names for different sizes, so
  it was <em>quite</em> interesting.\r\n\r\nI've searched for the article many times
  since without success. If anyone knows the article or can refer me to something
  similar, I'd greatly appreciate it.\r\n\r\n(Oh, and this is my first sojourn here.
  Hello, world!)"

    so that's probably why I was having so much trouble finding it.\r\n\r\nI'm trying
    to self-educate myself in typography...which is proving increasingly difficult...but
    cultivating an appreciation for it is a bit more manageable."
