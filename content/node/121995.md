  body: "That |G| is highly unusual for a gothic. Does your sample date from the 1920s?\r\n\r\nI\u2019m
    not sure what the original metal typeface was, but here are a few digital typefaces
    (with a bit of surgery on the crossbar of the |G|) that could help you replicate
    the look:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/alternate-gothic-lt/\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/flat-it/rama-gothic/\r\nhttp://www.felicianotypefoundry.com/cms/fonts/grotzec-condensed\r\nhttps://klim.co.nz/retail-fonts/founders-grotesk-condensed/"

  body: "After considering various options I would suggest as the closest substitute,
    KLIM's Founders Grotesk Extra Condensed Medium, which is based on a 1912 Miller
    & Richard specimen of No.7 Grotesque all-caps.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/FoundersGrotXCondMedAsSong_5036.jpg]\r\nFor
    a closer match clip the bar on _G_\r\nAlso compare to the Semibold weight\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/FoundersGrotXCondSemiBoldAsSong_5562.jpg]\r\nDon"

  body: Founders Grotesk is definitely the best option here. I'd like to add a ready-to-go
    option with [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/k-type/penny-lane|Penny Lane]] which
    has a crossbarless /G but you'd have to artificially compress it (ouch).

  body: "Thanks for introducing me to Penny Lane, Ryuk. Some of my ancestors lived
    in Liverpool in the mid 1800s, and I\u2019ve always liked the street signs in
    the photos my family  has of the era.\r\n\r\nGlad you found a typeface you like
    Sarah, but I did suggest it first (see my original post above)...."
