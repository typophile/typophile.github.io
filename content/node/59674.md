body: "Hello,\r\n\r\nI'm developing an Arabic font.\r\n\r\nI want to achieve a substitution
  like the one shown in the attached image.\r\n\r\nI want \"be\" to change to \"be.alt\"
  when it is before \"noon\", then I want to change the \"noon\" to change to \"noon.alt\"
  when it comes after \"be.alt\".\r\n\r\nI know that this has something to do with
  Contextual Substitution.\r\n\r\nMy question is how to write the lookups, and in
  which order the lookups should be placed?\r\n\r\nThanks and regards.\r\n"
