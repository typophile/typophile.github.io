  body: Absolutely it is. What you do is export the kerning file. It&#39;s very low
    tech -- just a text file. Then you simply cut and paste to create kerning profiles
    for the new characters, then import the kerning file again. It&#39;s very self-explanatory.
    As soon as you see that text file, it will all make sense.
