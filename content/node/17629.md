  a logo for a non-profit organization. The symbol involves 4 houses placed in a symetrical
  fashion and tilted at 45 degrees. It has been brought to my attention that the negative
  space in the middle resembles a swastica (now its all I see). Obviously this wasn't
  intentional but the question remains. Is it acceptable or should I tell the client
  to choose one of the other alternatives?\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/cit_logo.jpg]"

    working at an organization where the logo (made up of a cross and a dove) repeatedly
    reminds people of the state of Texas, you want to be very careful with implied
    meaning.\r\n\r\nI could immediately see the negative, literally as well as figurative,
    symbol."

  body: 'I definitely see a swastika in the negative space of your mark. I think the
    most professional way to deal with this would be to recommend to your client that
    they choose a different mark. And if I were you, I would actually develop one
    more option for your client to choose from. That way, you''re not forcing your
    client to choose from a smaller batch of choices. You don''t want your logo to
    even remotely resemble a swastika. '

    about the swastica. Actually there's an interesting book (if you haven't already
    read it) regarding its symbolic meaning in western culture after WW2. The book
    is by Steven Heller, \"The Swastika: Symbol Beyond Redemption?\""

    remaining space. Best to start over from scratch.\r\n\r\nFact is, anything with
    fourfold rotational symmetry is going to remind people of a swastika; that's how
    sensitive people are to it. For a non-profit organization, it's especially hazardous.
    Legends will spring up about how the organization is secretly run by white supremacists.
    Don't think that maybe they won't, because they will."

  body: 'You should note that the 45% rotation gives instability as well as dynamism
    to the design, especially as they are houses, which one expects to sit stablely
    on the ground. Hitler rotated the traditionally horizontal-vertical swastika''s
    orientation by 45% to give it an agressive dynamism. Including the dimension of
    gravity in your re-design might help you in divising a new version.  '

    meaningful symbol in a huge variety of cultures but the fact is it is way too
    loaded in the here and now to want your business associated with it. \r\n\r\nA
    friend of mine showed me a logo for a muslim company where the negative space
    made a cross - they changed it.\r\n\r\nFedEx most memorably has the negative space
    arrow in its logo.\r\n\r\nYou really need to be careful with this kind of thing,
    and especially for a nonprofit (not knowing what kind of business) to risk offense,
    bad idea."

    the  lines between the houses. Because they're an even negative stroke it accentuates
    it.\r\n\r\nThe bottom line though, is that if you salvage this mark, it's only
    merely okay. And you don't want them to go with a mark that is merely okay anyway.
    Best of luck with it.\r\n\r\nPost the rest of your solutions, then we'll help

    I recently had a client bring a project to a screeching halt when it was suggested
    to them that the floor plan of their space approximated the shape of a swastika.
    To be clear, the \"swastika\" would be totally imperceptable to anyone not looking
    at the engineering drawings. Everything was revamped to avoid even an imperceptable,
    unresonable and unitended association with an \"evil\" symbol. \r\nSymbolism is
    strong. I think it would be in your best interest to rework the mark and avoid
    the whole scenario."
