  this question : according to you, what is the Japanese font that would look good
  when placed close to some Times New Roman?\r\n\r\nThe ones I've chosen are :\r\n-
  DFGyoSho-Lt-WIN-RKSJ-H\r\n- DFHS-Mincho-W7-WIN-RKSJ-H\r\n\r\nWhat do you think about
  this choice?\r\nDo you have a better idea?\r\n\r\nThanks ! :)"
