body: For a project I am on, I would like to use the Swift from Gerard Unger. Now
  I saw that he has made two versions, one sold by Elsner &amp; Flake and one by Linotype?  <BR>Which
  one is the best? <BR> <BR>Thank you very much, <BR>Nicolien

  body: Hrant,  <BR> <BR>Thanks for your quick reaction.  <BR> <BR>I just saw that
    Gerard Unger also has an version swift 2.0. Do you mean that version?  <BR>It
    is anyway an bigger familie? But is it better? <BR> <BR>Nicolien

  body: Yeah, I meant the 2.0 version. Anything that doesn&#39;t have that suffix
    is most probably the old version, which I think is the same no matter where you
    get it - but I could be wrong. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>

    an postscript or truetype or open type &#40;if it is available! <BR> <BR>Nicolien

  body: Swift will probably work better in PS, but it depends on what you&#39;re doing
    with it. For example, if it&#39;s hinted well, and you&#39;re using it on-screen,
    then TT might be better. An OT version would be good if Swift has OT features
    &#40;and you app supports OT&#41;. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>

  body: I would assume that the two versions sold on <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/Search?searchtext=swift"
    target="_blank">MyFonts</a> are the same. You should really be comparing both
    of those with <a href="http://www.gerardunger.com/fontstore/store-swift.html"
    target="_blank">Swift 2.0</a> at Unger&#39;s site. Those two versions have a paltry
    eight variants while 2.0 has twenty-four. Maybe I&#39;m crazy but any typeface
    whose designer &#40;proven talented&#41; has seen fit to re-work it should be
    looked at seriously. Am I wrong?

  body: I didn&#39;t realize there was a difference in the number of weights. <BR>
    <BR>The fact that Unger is indeed a &#34;proven talent&#34; is certainly a positive,
    but wasn&#39;t he that when he made the original Swift? How much can you improve
    an already superb font without making drastic changes? And are individuals not
    susceptible to versionitis? <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>

  body: 'Not disagreeing with you there ... at all ... Hrant. Swift 1.0 was used all
    over the University of Reading, I grew to really like that version. I suppose
    I&#39;m speaking from how I might choose which version. Granted the <a href="http://www.baer.com/Media/ContentDetails.aspx?ContentID=100"
    target="_blank">&#39;69 Mustang</a> has a cool factor. But typefaces aren&#39;t
    cars. It would be more practical and make more sense to invest in the new version
    which probably has some tech advances too. '

    directly oversee the manufacture the original Swift? I doubt it. Swift 2.0, apart
    from the obvious benefit of the extension of the range of weights, might be likened
    to a &#39;director&#39;s cut&#39;: you&#39;re getting Swift the way the creator
    of Swift wants you to have it. This is not to say that some people might not be
    perfectly happy with the earlier version, or even prefer it. However, if I wanted
    Swift for a job, and the budget permitted, I would go for Gerard&#39;s version.
    Among other &#40;non-drastic&#41; changes, I believe the spacing is improved.'

  body: The 2.0 version is he most complete and looks very good to me. I ordered it
    today. I have seen an readingtest from the site of Gerard Unger &#40;<a href="http://www.gerardunger.com/fontstore/store-howto.html"
    target="_blank">http://www.gerardunger.com/fontstore/store-howto.html</a>&#41;
    and it looks great.  <BR>As Hrant says an PS version is in my case the best I
    think. I have been told that in mei this year the OT font is coming up but unfortunately
    I can&#39;t wait for that. The project is starting soon where I am working on.  <BR>
    <BR>Thanks everybody for thinking with me. <BR> <BR>Nicolien

    <BR>No, that&#39;s really old stuff &#40;we&#39;re talking mid-90s here&#41;,
    and it  <BR>obviously was meant for private use. <BR> <BR><i>&#62; BTW, did anybody
    mention that apparent size and apparent  <BR>leading need to be normalized for

    <BR>That&#39;s why we did the second series of tests with normalized  <BR>x-heights.
    It <i>was</i> quite interesting and there were some  <BR>surprising results.

    in Minion Pro, compared to Minion, to me made a big difference, even though they
    are minute. The serifs are a little bit heavier and the round letters narrower.
    <BR> <BR>The big Optima Nova project I think is wonderful. It really improved
    the weight of Optima for digital setting. I don&#39;t know about the other re-dos
    for Linotype, such as by Frutiger; it would be interesting to have somebody to
    do a survey of these &#39;second time around&#39; efforts. My guess would be that
    they would be significant improvements.  '
