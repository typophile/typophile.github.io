  body: "Hi Ryuk, thanks for the suggestion of Tertial United It is a good addition
    to the list of \"crisp monoline scripts.\" This the category label I use to classify
    this image. It has squared ends rather than the rounded ones found in most monoline
    scripts, hence \"crisp.\"\r\nI should also have included an old standard,  Max
    Kaufmann's  Kaufmann script of 1936 http://www.myfonts.com/search/Kaufmann/fonts/\r\nDon"
