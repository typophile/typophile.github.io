  upper-case characters. As you can see below, the A and S charachters are quite common
  among blackletter/fraktur fonts. It's the L that's the dealbraker, as I haven't
  been able to find one like that. After four hours straight of searching, I'm hoping
  someone has an answer for me. Thanks a lot in advance!\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Unbenannt_3545.JPG]"
