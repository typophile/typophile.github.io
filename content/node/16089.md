  Hunter Middleton, 1898-1985\r\n\r\nRobert Middleton was born in 1898 in Glasgow,
  Scotland. In 1908 he emigrated to the U. S. and in 1922 was a student at the School
  of the Art Institute under [[Ernst Detterer]]. Together Detterer and Middleton began
  working on a typeface based on the Roman of 1470 by [[Nicolas Jenson]] called Eusebius.
  The typeface design was later commissioned by [[Ludlow Typograph]] and upon graduation
  Middleton went to work for Ludlow. There he learned matrice cutting from [[Robert
  Wiebking]] and in 1933 became head of the type design department.\r\n\r\nAlong with
  Detterer and [[Oswald Cooper]], Middleton was one of the founding members of the
  Society of Typographic Arts and was the first secretary of the organization. He
  was also a founding member of the 27 Chicago Designers. Along with Herbert Bayer
  and others he helped to found the Aspen Design Conference.\r\n\r\nMiddleton was
  also a collector of wood engravings by Thomas Bewick. When a dealer bought a collection
  of Thomas Bewick's wood engravings Middleton convinced him to sell them in smaller
  lots so they would be available to interested collectors. Middleton himself purchased
  several. He had been operating his own private press, the Cherryburn Press, and
  discovered how to print Bewick's illustrations on the hand press.\r\n\r\nHe was
  also interested in paste papers for book binding and had accumulated over 150 designs
  for binding papers and had a sample book of the designs which he could reproduce.
  Middleton also learned punch cutting from [[Victor Hammer]] and later completed
  the Andromaque face after Hammer had died.\r\n\r\nArchives of Middleton's work are
  included in the Newberry Library, Special Collections at University of Illinois
  at Chicago, and the Art Institute of Chicago.\r\n\r\nAmong typefaces designed by
  Middleton:\r\n\r\nEusebius, Tempo, Karnak, Mayfair, Eden, Stellar (an early stressed
  sans predating Optima), Delphian, Umbra, Mandate, Garamond, Bodoni, Cameo, Ludlow
  Black, Lafayette, Bodoni Campanile, Coronet Bold and Light, and Radiant.\r\n"
