  studio? They are famous for their film titling and I would love to check out their
  site as I have worn out the Imaginary Forces Favourites button on my browser. Thanks,

    don&#39;t actually have any video on there, but it lists some of the motion work
    they&#39;ve done. <BR> <BR> <BR>There&#39;s also <a href="http://www.thedirectorsbureau.com/">
    The Directors Bureau</a>, but I don&#39;t think that&#39;s what you were looking
    for.
