body: "Alright guys and gals, let me start by introducing myself. My name is Graham
  Hammond (I creatively overlapped the two names to get my current handle). I was
  referred to this site by [[http://typophile.com/user/44690|Lefty]] and I've moved
  here from Logopond. The constructive criticism over there is almost non-existent
  and since I'm currently struggling with creating a brand identity for myself I was
  looking for opinions/tips from other great designers.\r\n\r\nI am currently working
  on trying to create a personal logo for myself as a designer; something I'll use
  as a r\xE9sum\xE9 header, website logo, and possibly on personal business cards.
  Right now, I'm using a personal variant of the CS3 logo, as you can see. I am aware
  that this will not do, and so I've spent the last couple months trying to create
  a memorable mark that I can use to identify myself.\r\n\r\nI seem to be fine working
  on existing logos and providing good feedback for others and helping them to tweak
  their mark, but when it comes to my own I can't seem to get to the finish. I'm extremely
  critical of myself and can't ever really be satisfied with something. I have gone
  through about 10 different ideas in the last month or so, and I just can't seem
  to make a decision. My brain just keeps coming up with other ideas and now I have
  an overflow of personal mark concepts.\r\n\r\nI've narrowed it down to 5 of my concepts
  for this thread. They're not all the best ones, but they do encompass most of the
  base concepts I've had... many other ideas are just variations of these. Let me
  make it clear that the main focus here is strictly the mark istelf, (I have to say
  it because people have focused on it before) the gradient background and the drop
  shadow are only for presentation; they have nothing to do with the mark! Also, focus
  is of course on creating a black mark first and foremost, as that's how I've come
  to learn it should be done. Color will come once the mark has been selected and
  perfected. Here's hoping you folks can help bring out the best in me.\r\n\r\nSo
  in somewhat of a chronological order, here we go:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/gh4_6558.png]\r\n\r\nI
  don't know how it happened, but I really became a fan of negative space recently.
  I got inspired by some logos that I saw and I started to play around. This was my
  favorite for quite a while. I realize that a designer will probably see it right
  away, but I've showed this to some people and they just see black shapes. I kind
  of liked the idea, it has a kind of Tetris block feel to it and takes a little bit
  to register the letters.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/gh5b_5407.png]\r\n\r\nThis
  one I like because it seems to invoke an image of a shift pattern generally seen
  on manual car gear knobs. I'm a pretty big car buff, so this one sits well with
  me. Plus I think it has more significance as an insight into my persona. This one
  got comments over at Logopond to the tune of 'It looks too much like the LG logo'.
  Personally, I don't see it... how about you?\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/gh6_4745.png]\r\n\r\nThis
  is one of my least favorites, but the idea popped into my head to modify the @ symbol.
  So I turned the \"a\" into a \"g\" and tweaked it to fit.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/gh7_5388.png]\r\n\r\nI
  don't really remember where this concept came from, but it seems it may have developed
  from the @ variation. Obviously I added in the H and squared off the border.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/gh8_5360.png]\r\n\r\nThis
  is one of my most recent marks, and I hold this as one of my favorites. Again, there's
  something about negative space that I just like to play with. I felt it had just
  the right mix of simplicity, creative flair, and a bit of that \"a-ha!\" factor
  when you finally see it. However, I've showed this one to many people... my parents,
  and a couple friends who also do design, and nobody seems to see the G in negative
  space until I point it out to them. I suppose this is the one I'm looking for feedback
  on the most, as I just want a nice broad opinion on whether or not the G is noticeable."

    derivative (I did NOT think LG immediately, however) and you may get pigeonholed.
    I think that last one could work but only if you could figure a way to make the
    "G" slightly more obvious. I have no thoughts on how to do that at the moment,
    though someone else may. As it stands right now that inside shape of the "G" stands
    out to me as being way too awkward with the very vertical and horizontal lines
    of the upper-case "H." '

    in your font selection. Try to find something that has more personality to it.

    for me.\r\n\r\nI didn't think of LG instantly, but I can see why someone might.
    The similarity for me is that both use a monoline, geometric typeface.\r\n\r\nPerhaps
    moving forward you could try a different typeface, as Chris says, something with
    more personality.\r\n\r\nHope that helps"

  body: i can see the G in the last one--but i still have to struggle to force myself
    to see it every time. of these here, the second one works the best. the H feels
    as if it's off center, to the right, and would need to be moved very slightly
    to the left.

    as well.\r\n\r\nThe second reminds me of a logo from an airport, which had an
    airplane instead of the H."

  body: "I like the last one. Solely because it has his own unique 'face'.\r\nHowever,
    the negative space of the G is not in balance with the H.\r\nPerhaps coloralterations
    or an adjustment will do the trick."

  body: "Thanks, everyone, for your opinions. I see that the general input is split
    between the 'gearshift' and the 'negative G' options. This is more progress than
    I have made so far, so this is fantastic. \r\n\r\nFor the 'gearshift' option...
    my original concept was the single stroke as presented in the first post, but
    the one I submitted and got the feedback on over at logopond was reversed on a
    circle. Maybe presenting it like this makes the LG connection more prevalent and
    thus why I got the comments I did:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/gh5_5741.png]\r\n\r\nI
    still think it's plenty different and unique enough to work, but of course I'm
    open to any and all input.\r\n\r\nAnd I'm glad to see that people like my 'negative
    G' logo. I realize it's a bit challenging to see at first, but that's why I like
    it. I feel like that's what makes it successful; that you finally see it, and
    have that \"a-ha moment\" and you remember it from then on... it sticks with you.
    I've run through a bunch of other variations, and since there is a lean towards
    that logo as well I'll post them here. It seems the basic suggestion is to tweak
    it more and try different typfaces. I had already experimented with that and kept
    going back to the original, but up for opinions now... here are all the variants
    I worked with:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/gh8all_3902.png]\r\n\r\nSorry
    about the scrolling, and I know I lack letters or numbers for each item like most
    people... but bear with me. I started originally with Helvetica and branched out
    to other typefaces and ideas. So here we go...\r\n\r\nFirst row: \r\n<li>The actual
    size of the white/negative G matches the H perfectly. (in point size, I think
    the H is too dominant.)</li><li>The H is scaled down to match the negative space
    of the G. (I think the negative space looks too much like it's own character,
    an un-recognizable one at that.)</li><li>This was a happy in between that I just
    eyeballed. (The 'character' and the H aren't fighting for dominance, and the G
    is still readable. This is the one I already posted.)</li>\r\nSecond row:\r\n<li>This
    is the same size as the last one, I just made the G oblique to give it more character.
    (I think I like this one better, is the G more noticeable here?)</li><li>The next
    two are a couple variants on the typeface. I believe the first is Eurostile and
    the second one was custom.</li>\r\nThird row:\r\n<li>A couple other variations
    on type. Also I extended the H 'behind' the G to make the G more readable. (I
    think it solves readability for sure, but I feel it clutters the logo and defeats
    the creative purpose (no more \"a-ha moment\"))</li><li>I tried playing with just
    the G as a negative over a black square.</li><li>I even tried reversing the H
    instead, but clearly this looks like \"G colon\" and practically makes the H non-existent
    unless you knew it was supposed to be there.</li>"

  body: "The middle logo-- the one using Eurostile, I think, seems to have the look
    of a G like in Helvetica, with a \"stem\" coming off of the end of the 'G'. It
    looks great. That partly rounded look fits in nicely with the sharp 'H'.\r\n\r\n--\r\n<sub>\\\\\\<a

    the weight of H ever so slightly. Right now it looks lighter than the G inferred

    is a concern, perhaps putting a light (oval) frame around the mark could help
    with defining the outer shape of G ?\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Thanks Ed, I'm still very partial to that one, I just don't think it would
    be as successful for me as a graphic designer as it would if I were to go into
    an automotive business. This is the only reason I hesitate on it. I feel that
    the enthusiast inspiration would be lost on most people.\r\n\r\nReinis, perhaps
    you didn't read my initial post... but allow me to reiterate that the gradients
    and drop shadows are strictly for presentation. They have nothing to do with the
    mark itself. These were pre-canned images that I had already made up for use at
    logopond\u2014where I didn't get as much help as I've already had here. Also,
    thanks for the mock-up. The misalignment bothers me a bit as well and it was something
    I had intended to deal with should I choose to develop that mark further.\r\n\r\nAlex,
    I also feel like the Eurostile G has potential. Maybe I'll work with it a bit
    more... thanks."

  body: I too like the gear shift version. I like the mark for it's metaphoric symbolism
    - moving forward, speeding ahead, someone who doesn't get stuck in ruts, pushing
    beyond the limits - concepts which may describe you as a graphic designer. That
    you are a car enthusiast is just an added dimension to the meaning. Glad to hear
    the shadows aren't part of the mark. And to be honest they don't bring anything
    to the presentation.
