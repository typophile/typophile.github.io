body: My father insists that the "c" in McGlaughlin should be aligned to the top of
  the M with a line underneath. I have not seen this before and so I pose the question
  to my fellow designers. Is what he speaks true?

    men...

  body: "Looking at that other thread, and then doing an image search, the raised
    c is common, but it exists in different forms; aligned with the top, or not quite
    reaching the top, and with one line, two lines, or two dots, or nothing, under
    it.\r\n\r\nMy understanding, though, contrary to some things said in that thread,
    is that \"Mc\" and \"Mac\" are two quite distinct prefixes. Yes, in the dim and
    misty remote ages of ancient time, they came from a common origin, but today it's
    no more correct to say that \"Mc\" is in error, and should be changed to \"Mac\"
    than to try and tell the people named Peter, Pierre, Pedro and Pyotr that they
    should all spell their names the same way (presumably as Petros)."

  body: It probably started as a ligature to save space with a sloping M.

  body: IMO the dash is a substitution of a dot. Another use in this manner is pricing
    with the two decimals raised, over a line.
