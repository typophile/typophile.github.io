  body: "<em>Of course</em> \"the marketplace\" will \"resolve all\" of the \"issues
    discussed in the article\".\r\n\r\nThe marketplace will also resolve what stock
    prices will be a week from today, but that doesn't mean the Wall Street Journal
    should cease publication. So, while it certainly is true that if new typefaces
    have value, the marketplace will pick them up... some helpful advice to people
    that will help them avoid <em>wasting their time</em> is not a bad thing.\r\n\r\nOf
    course, \"we don't need X\" is not the same thing as \"there is no money to be
    made by providing X\". Britney Spears, after all, has made quite a bit of money
    through her singing career.\r\n\r\nAlso, the article is focused on originality
    as a criterion for the value of a new typeface. There are other figures of merit
    to be considered as well, such as craftsmanship. But maybe the problem is that
    I'm unable to tell how its author <em>defines</em> originality.\r\n\r\nI think,
    for example, that Williams Caslon is a <em>very</em> valuable typeface, and I'm
    very glad it exists. The same is true of Starling - which <em>was</em> original
    when it first came out in obscurity, but is Font Bureau's revival of it \"original\"?\r\n\r\nIt's
    the wild and crazy display fonts that clutter up sites like dafont that are often
    of little value; maybe version #10001 of a child's scrawled handprinting is not
    <em>really</em> original, but it's likely to be graphically unique. Distressed
    typewriter faces are also available in excessive number, but again, each one is
    as unique as a fingerprint.\r\n\r\nMaybe the problem is the distinction between
    real and apparent originality - the writer was writing for a typographically (and
    <em>artistically</em>) sophisticated audience that was in no danger of falling
    into the trap I've outlined. An innocent like myself would use terms like \"utility\"
    and \"craftsmanship\" to make things clearer, or in some other way distinguish
    genuine creativity from mere novelty.\r\n\r\nBut on the general issue, rather
    than the article itself:\r\n\r\nWe have Baskerville and Caledonia and Century
    Expanded and Times Roman and Garamond. And Imprint and Adobe Caslon too! I could
    indeed say on the one hand that with all those choices, one hardly needs a \"new\"
    typeface for workhorse text usage - these all are highly readable.\r\n\r\nAnd,
    of course, on top of those, we <em>also</em> have Bembo, Optima, and Palatino
    and Bodoni Book - so it's not as if the palette of existing typefaces is a Spartan
    one without variety.\r\n\r\nWe - that is, the speakers of Latin-alphabet languages
    without exotic accents - probably don't \"need\" new typefaces. Others are less
    fortunate. But then, we don't <em>need</em> new ladies' fashions either, but the
    market <strong>will</strong> continue to inflict them on us, whatever those dedicated
    to rationality might desire.\r\n\r\nSeeing the world in a new way, even if that
    means perfectly legible and readable typefaces will start to look dated, and thus
    increase the cost of printing due to the need to purchase replacements (so that
    what one prints will appeal to its target audience or market, so \"need\" it is)...
    is not a wholly bad thing. We have a rich selection of typefaces today to choose
    from partly <em>because</em> of the cycle of fashion from Caslon to Scotch Roman
    to the \"standard\" text faces listed earlier.\r\n\r\nSo, even if the last half
    of the nineteenth century was largely a dismal era of typography, it still contributed
    to the era that followed being richer than the era that went before."

  body: "There was no link. I think that I just incorrectly coded an cite tag.\r\n\r\nWhat
    I meant was that the font market seems to prefer a gradual evolution based on
    existing styles. Designers Peter seems to consider original\u2014\u201CPeter Verheul,
    Cyrus Highsmith, Fred Smeijers, or Underware\u201D\u2014are not dominating font
    sales or use. Design criticism has had plenty of calls to abandon slow advancement
    in favor of more sudden change in both typography and type design. While Peter's
    call for originality does not echo this desire to such an extreme as 1990s writing\u2014Peter
    is not asking for more Dead History and David Carson\u2014the sentiment is still
    just as familiar as the types he complains about.\r\n\r\nOf course one could argue
    that the market is only addressing the needs and desires of the Latin alphabet.
    But it could also be that the lack of a market for many non-Latin fonts suggests
    readers of those scripts have more pressing concerns than type. Just because there
    are thousands fewer good typefaces for Devanagari than Latin does not mean that
    Indians are clamoring to stop worrying about drinking water and start setting
    books with new fonts."

  body: "The \"that's not type design\" argument doesn't go over well at Typophile,
    where a number of frequent contributors are heavily invested in revivals. Hence
    the can of worms, no doubt. (BTW Christopher, are Typophile readers really so
    visually illiterate you have to spell it out for them?)\r\n\r\nHaving fought that
    battle, I've moved on to \"that's not science\"!\r\n\r\nHowever, I will say that
    EVB's statement \"If an existing typeface does the job, there is no reason to
    make a new one\" is incorrect.\r\nThere is plenty of reason if people will buy
    your revival, me-too, or knock-off, and they may be persuaded to do so by extra-typographic,
    marketing factors such as:\r\n- Price\r\n- Branding\r\n- Advertising, promotion
    and collateral \r\n- Buying experience\r\n- Support\r\n- Licensing terms\r\n\r\nThe
    present situation may be compared to that prior to the ATF consolidation, when
    there were many foundries in the USA, and each had its version of the popular
    genres.\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    is a good point. Currently, in my country, there is a big controversy over our
    exports of asbestos to the Third World. While asbestos has health risks, these
    pale in comparison to the danger from fire. Telling Third World countries they
    have to do without industrial development unless they do it to our very expensive
    safety standards shows a lack of awareness of their conditions.\r\n\r\nObviously,
    though, the market won't create much in the way of typefaces for people who don't
    have a lot of money to spend on font purchases. For people to have a basic set
    of different styles of printing in which to express themselves is of value because
    it helps people maintain their language and culture. So I praise the efforts of
    those working on various open-source typeface projects to cover more of Unicode.\r\n\r\n@Christopher
    Dean:\r\n<cite>I understand the difference between ' & \u2019 but is that really
    enough to cause a glitch?</cite>\r\n\r\nBelieve it. There is the typewriter quote,
    ', and there is the opening single quote, `, which are both part of ASCII, but
    the true apostrophe and closing single quote are outside the standard 7-bit subset
    on the U.S. computer keyboard.\r\n\r\nAt U+00B4, there is a candidate for the
    closing single quote. That's in the 8-bit ISO 8859-1 set, and so it shouldn't
    be enough to cause a glitch with most systems or typefaces.\r\n\r\nBut if you
    go to U+2018 and U+2019 in the \"General Punctuation\" area of Unicode, I fear
    you are asking for trouble. Instead of the capacity required for accented letters
    in French words - 8-bit ISO 8859-1 - what is required is the 16-bit Basic Multilingual
    Plane of Unicode, that is, the big guns that can also handle Chinese characters.\r\n\r\nWould
    you have been as surprised if Chinese text had caused a glitch?"

    handles this stuff very well, many forums puke up garbage characters when I use
    apostrophes, real quotes, dashs, and so on.
