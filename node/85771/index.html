<p>Ironically, the UN Declaration of Human Rights addresses the issue:</p>

(2) Everyone, without any discrimination, has the right to equal pay for equal work.
(3) Everyone who works has the right to just and favourable remuneration…</blockquote>

I see this as no different than what many of us here have done with the several FontAid projects. There is no speculation because there is no pay off other than acknowledgment and a bit of brief notoriety. To me, it is a straight donation for a cause the contributors believe in.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want any organization defining for me what is charity.  I know what it is for me and don&rsquo;t think anyone has the right to redefine it for anyone else.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>It may be a noble cause, and the people involved may have good intentions, but it would have been far better if the committee had just chosen a well-respected design firm and asked if they&rsquo;d be willing to design a logo for free. Many design firms do pro bono work routinely for good causes. And if the committee didn&rsquo;t like their design, they could ask another firm to take a try at it.</p>
<p>But this &ldquo;cattle call&rdquo; approach to design is a bad way to go for numerous reasons, and is virtually unheard of in most other professions.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Chris, I might counter that not paying the winner makes it <em>worse</em> in the eyes of many people opposed to spec work.</p>
<p>James, I think the nature of this project would have made the awarding of the work to a hand-picked design firm (paid or not) anathema. This is a special case where it actually makes more sense to let anybody try his hand, and let people vote on it. I will remind you that I am in no way a fan of Democracy&hellip;  :-)</p>
<p>Trevor, I think the winning logo is much better than most paid logos.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Not that it has any bearing on the issue of pro bono vs spec, but I also believe honestly that it is a quite GOOD logo (symbol sign, brand, what have you). It is certainly far better than the redos of, Quark, The Gap, UPS, and dozens more big-bucks gradient emblazoned bandanas that have been paid for by for profit businesses.</p>
<p>Spec work is work done almost under coercion with empty promises of future business and &ldquo;making a name for oneself. It is the bait and switch shell game of con men who feel proud of themselves for squeezing free work out of work-hungry designers with bills to pay and then go off laughing about the suckers they have screwed over in their career.</p>
<p>Pro bono, or volunteer work for charities is someone giving freely of their time and skills with no expectation of renumeration.  The difference can only be honestly determined by the parties involved.</p>
