body: "What would you consider a reasonable price for embedding fonts in apps and
  ebooks?\r\n\r\nI think units sold per month is a good way to determine the price,
  because it differentiates between small and big publishers, and if someone starts
  selling big all of a sudden they can purchase a new license. My gut feeling is that
  something like 50, 500 and 5000 units sold per month would cover most cases. What
  would you consider a reasonable price (for one style)?"

    tell you this after each year and you will charge then?\r\n\r\nFrom a user\u2019s
    perspective I really like the FSI way of having an app license but not having
    it based on sales at all: http://www.mobilefontfonts.com"

    selling better, you can come back and purchase a new license. It\u2019s roughly
    the same as buying standard licenses based on users or workstations. I\u2019m
    proposing a one time fee, if that was not clear."
