  failed to find everyone's opinion on the results. For me, there was one major surprise
  but I might be wrong.\r\n\r\nhttp://tdc.org/tdc/tdc2-2010-winners\r\n\r\nWhat are
  your thoughts?\r\n\r\n(PS. Does anyone know whether it is possible to know what
  faces were entered, all I can get is the list of the award recipients?)"

    to get a list of all the entries.\r\n\r\nI've been involved with his competition
    since the beginning, and there are always surprises to me.\r\n\r\nPlease remember
    that the winners are what the four judges agreed upon on that day and that time.
    Perhaps if the weather was different or they had the salad instead of the sandwich
    for lunch, their selections might have changed.\r\n\r\nJames M"
