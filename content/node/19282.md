  help me--I am trying to find a digital match for this Hebrew font. A close match
  would be good, but idealy I am looking for an actual digital version of this font.\r\n\r\nSample
  is here: http://www.sacerdoti.com/Resources/sample.gif\r\n\r\nThe sample is from
  a prayer book printed by Vivian Ridler, printer to the Oxford University Press many
  years ago. Obviously back then it was not a digital font, and I now need to match
  it.\r\n\r\nPlease do help if you can.\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\nJonathan"

      yud character is a bit squarer, as are a few others actually.\r\n\r\nAlso, I'm
      on a Mac (of course!). But that's irrelevant for now."

    Good luck. \r\n\r\nPeninim? This face based on Frank-R\xFChl (and not good for
    your project)"

  body: "I know I'll never get a perfect match, David, between metal and digital.
    But I was just hoping there might be a closer match than Vilna, though I agree
    it's pretty close in some respects. The yud, the bet, and a few others give it
    away, to me. But I think it might be the best there is out there. Vilna is by
    far the best so far.\r\n\r\nWhat I am trying to do, you see, is add a couple of
    paragraphs to a book I am resetting. I have used scans of the old book for most
    of the text in Hebrew, but there's a few new sections I need to set, and I had
    hoped I could use a digital font. Do you think I will get away with Vilna for
    this?\r\n\r\nThanks Miguel. I've seen loads of Hebrew fonts looking for this match,
    including all the ones at that link. But somehow the perfect match has yet to
    be found.\r\n\r\nMaybe I am being too fussy, I know. I have sometimes hoped to
    commission a digital version of this font. Maybe one day."

  body: it's a prayer book, but only a short one, for a special service. Most of the
    prayers are already set in other books, but there is a newly composed prayer which
    I need to set, and I wonder if you think Vilna will be a close enough match for
    me to type the new prayer out and use it, but simply scan in in the old ones.
