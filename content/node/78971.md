body: "I have had the developer tell me that there is a difference in pixel sizes
  for fonts.\r\n\r\nI used DIN as primary font and then secondary to use Tahoma.\r\n\r\nHowever
  on Tahoma, the font sizes are huge compared to DIN.\r\nThey looked fine when I mocked
  them up on Photoshop, its not the case on the web.\r\n\r\nIs this true? I find it
  hard to believe and also for future projects how do I test this properly before
  showing to the client? I have had so many problems with the size difference. I also
  think the developer may be trying to worm his way out of his past mistakes but I
  need some confirmation first from other developers on this board if any.\r\n\r\nBasically
  the Tahoma font looks like 20pt size compared to a 14pt size for DIN. If anyone
  can answer me as to why I can learn something important for today :D\r\n\r\nThanks
  in advance!!!"

  body: "Your question is not clear.\r\n\r\nThe size of a pixel is determined by the
    computer screen on which something is viewed. If you use Photoshop or another
    paint program, if a letter is 60 pixels high on your computer, it will be 60 pixels
    high on any machine on which the image is viewed, whether because they downloaded
    the image, or because it appears in a web page.\r\n\r\nWhen including text on
    a web page, one can specify that the text is to be larger or smaller than normal
    by specifying 'font size=\"-1\"' or something like that. These sizes depend on
    the user's settings, and don't allow fine control.\r\n\r\nHowever, when using
    CSS, you can also specify point sizes for text.\r\n\r\nAnd, when using Photoshop,
    normally you don't specify the size of text in pixels, it is also specified in
    points.\r\n\r\n<em>Here</em>, you can run into trouble.\r\n\r\nBack in the days
    of Microsoft Windows 3.1, and Macintosh computers that used 68000-family processors:\r\n\r\nOn
    a Windows machine, 72 pixels were normally treated as \"one inch\" for translating
    the point size of type into the screen size of a typeface. That could actually
    have been any size, because a PC-compatible computer had no way of knowing how
    big your screen was. You could choose to use \"large fonts\", and to change that
    relationship so that the computer would treat 96 pixels as one inch.\r\n\r\nOn
    a Macintosh, the size of the screen was known to the computer, and it determined
    how many pixels the screen had. The standard resolution of the Macintosh platform
    was 60 pixels per inch.\r\n\r\nNow, the standard resolutions is much greater on
    the Macintosh than it had formerly been. Changes on the Windows platform have
    not been so large, but usually the choice is between 96 pixels per inch and 144
    pixels per inch.\r\n\r\nSo, if your computer is a Macintosh, and your web page
    is being viewed by someone using Windows...\r\n\r\nif your CSS script says a certain
    type of text is \"14pt\", the height of that in pixels will be determined by the
    number of pixels per inch (72 points) on the user's Windows computer...\r\n\r\nif
    you used 14 point text when preparing an image, the height of that text in pixels
    will be determined by the number of pixels per inch on your Macintosh.\r\n\r\nThis
    <em>could</em> be what the person was mentioning."

  body: "Ah, so I was wrong about that part of it.\r\n\r\nIn that case, setting screen
    resolution to be an effective 96 ppi on the computer running Photoshop should
    solve the problem, if the problem was what I thought it was.\r\n\r\nOf course,
    in that case, a browser obeying the CSS specs is no longer screen resolution independent,
    so it could now be in violation of the interface specifications of the manufacturer
    of the operating system. Since Mozilla Firefox is something you download for free,
    I'm not sure if the people at Mozilla <em>care</em> about the right to put the
    \"Designed for Windows 7\" logo on their nonexistent boxes... but this must cause
    feelings of angst among someone involved with Internet Explorer."

  body: "Never use 'font size=\"-1\"' in the HTML tags, define this in the CSS:\r\n\r\n<code>p
    {\r\n  font-family: Tahoma, sans-serif;\r\n  font-size: 14px;\r\n}</code>\r\n\r\nThis
    will style all the p tags in your HTML with 14px Tahoma, and where Tahoma is not
    present (for example on the iPad or on Android systems) it will use the standard
    sans-serif in those systems instead (and most are not as narrow as Tahoma, and
    might not share it\u2019s x-height \u2014 14px might look bigger or smaller in
    a fallback font). The font size can be specified in px\u2019s (pixels), em\u2019s
    or percents, the former being the most static as it only relates to the ppi of
    the screen. Depending on rendering engine in the end users OS and web browser
    and the design and hinting of the font, letters may appear with slight differences
    in width and height.\r\n\r\nMocking up in Photoshop is well and good, but a serious
    web designer <em>should</em> have some understanding of how the web works."

  body: "thanks for all your responses.\r\n\r\ni had the idea that a 14pt or px Tahoma
    on my photoshop layout is NOT to have a big difference where it comes out something
    like 24pt  or px on the web. The site is using CSS.\r\n\r\nI am not too versed
    in programming hence I am asking on this forum. I know how to design visually
    good work but I need to have a developer who can assist me in coding. I would
    assume that a developer who is working on this project would tell me in advance
    the font sizing issues based on the designs I provided to him rather than have
    this shown to me when coded up. He said that there are huge differences in sizes
    from a photoshop file to the web but couldn't explain why. Wouldn't he know this
    in advance and adjust to my layout accordingly?'\r\n\r\nI am also asking because
    I am going through some issues with him and I might need to go to another developer
    for help."

  body: "Short incorrect awsers, that i can understand. Long-wined ones, are such
    a marvelous mystery. \r\n\r\nWindows defaults to 96 pixels per something and most
    users never change that. Mac is 72 per something. This supposedly due to windows
    users sitting farther from the screen than mac users, (really!)  Besides that,
    fonts are sized to be larger or smaller on the em for a variety of reasons. Assuming
    the size specified in CSS is the same, both in value and in the units used to
    describe size for two fonts, Photoshop should give an accurate preview of what
    proportions two fonts have to each other on or off the web. \r\n\r\nDon't blame
    your web designer though. This issue is so problematic, along side line spacing,
    letterspacing and other variations windows browsers add to the stew, that most
    web design with live type is doomed to loose specification, and thus loose design
    if it can be made to work at all. This is why publications who depend on tight
    consistent design the user cannot undo, only really appear on the iPad. "
