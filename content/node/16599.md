body: "Hi, I am new to designing fonts and need some advice: First I would like to
  know where to find the font (to download for free, preferably) that is used to write
  \"Harper's Bazaar\" and also \"Vogue\", because I would like to base my design on
  that font. \r\nThen, is it a good way of designing to draw it on paper, then to
  scan it in, then to trace it in Illustrator and then to work with it further on
  Fontlab?\r\nAny feedback would be appreciated, thanks"
