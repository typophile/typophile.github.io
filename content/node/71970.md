  body: The serif font is <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/linotype/cochin_std_complete_family_value_pack/">Cochin</a>,
    and looking at the <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/themandatepress/2784428764/sizes/o/in/photostream/">better
    image</a>, I would say the sans serif font is <a href="http://www.typography.com/fonts/font_overview.php?productLineID=100008">Gotham</a>.
