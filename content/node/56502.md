  closing, I'd like to recount an interesting incident which adds another dimension
  to the allure of wood type\u2026 a mother and child incident [at an antiques mall
  not long ago]. The boy, about 11 years old, was unhappy with the mall experience;
  but his eyes lit up on spotting [our] array of type cases holding type, cuts and
  other seductive what nots. After inspecting things for a while, he started on a
  second tour despite his mother's tuggings. The mother persisted, the boy resisted.
  My wife, who had been observing this with quiet amusement (having raised three sons)
  asked him why he found the type of such interest. He caressed the piece he had in
  hand - thought a bit and said, \"It's real.\"\r\n\r\n- Stan Harris, writing in Greg
