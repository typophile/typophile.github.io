  you could have asked for it earlier ;-p...)\r\nOk, so one last thread about my new
  business card new modifications and : NO, I'm not going to put any other contact
  information there : I'd rather have a client gifted with a brain who could find
  all the information he needs on it and not overload the design with unecessary text...
  and : NO, I'm not willing to change the picture nore the logotype, for god sake
  ! A little bit of taste here, and c'mon it's not that bad, I don't agree...\r\nBy
  the way, I'd LOVE to see your bCards guys...\r\nLet's have a little gallery here
  in this thread.\r\nB.CARDS HALL OF FAME (first edition)\r\n\r\nThanxxx.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/bCards_4009.jpg]"
