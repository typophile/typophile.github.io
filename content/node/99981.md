  in spread headers or posters. Unlike many of the fonts that are given for free,
  Shket offers a pretty big charset that will cover many languages and symbols, making
  it ideal for any design job\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://fontm.com/shket-font/\" >Download</a>\r\n\r\n<img

  body: "Sorry to that guy, but you forgot some glyphs. Especially bad when you make
    an uppercase, but not lowercase, as with /dcaron and /iogonek. \r\n [img:sites/default/files/old-images/missing_4651.PNG]"

  body: What version of Shket do you have?  dcaron and iogonek are currently present
    in my working master... and no, I have not forgotten ) The font is in development
    and is natural that some glyphs will be missing or that bugs will, well, bug around.

    next update.
