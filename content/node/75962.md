body: "Hello! I need help with programming in beginning and ending swashes into a
  new script font I'm working on. I want to set this up in such a way that I can use
  both a beginning and an ending in the same word. I found an older thread on this,
  and followed it, but it wasn't working. I tried it with just one letter that has
  three variations, but it isn't working for me. This is what I have: \r\n\r\nfeature
  calt {\r\n\r\nlookup caltstart {\r\n   ignore sub @letter_start @start';\r\n   sub
  @start' by @start_swash;\r\n} caltstart;\r\n\r\nlookup caltend {\r\n   ignore sub
  @end' @letter_end;\r\n   sub @end' by @end_swash;\r\n} caltend;\r\n\r\n} calt;\r\n\r\n-
  - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\r\n\r\n@letter_start: t t.start\r\n@start:
  t\r\n@start_swash: t.start\r\n@letter_end: t t.end\r\n@end: t\r\n@end_swash: t.end\r\n\r\nThanks!

    question I must say it: Have a look into <strong><a href=\"http://www.adobe.com/devnet/opentype/afdko/topic_feature_file_syntax.html#2.g.ii\">the

    could be that you don't need the at-signs there.
