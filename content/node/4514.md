  body: California is similar to Plaza but not quite, Hot Rod looks like Futura which
    has been condensed &#40;but not Futura Condensed&#41;. You can tell by the variance
    on the thicknesses of the vertical and horizontal strokes.

  body: HOT ROD is just squished Avant Garde. If you want a more realistic license
    plate font, check <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/ephemera/penitentiary-gothic/">Penitentiary
    Gothic</a>. I know the other one, too -- gimme a minute.

  body: Oops, never mind -- I must have been thinking of Avenida and Plaza, too. But
    you can add Anna to the almost-but-not-quite list. And on further thought I take
    it back about Avant Garde -- Patricia&#39;s right about Futura. Boy that looks
    terrible.

  body: 'That&#39;s not what the license plate type actually looks like, though.  And
    we have some much better plate designs as well. For example, I have a whale-tail
    plate that looks something like this: <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/34625.jpg"
    alt="whale"> <BR> <BR>It&#39;s pretty sweet, actually. And the extra fees go 100%
