  body: "Thanks for your response.\r\n\r\nEven if there are \"hundreds\" of similar
    octagonal fonts out there, it would be nice to get a few suggestions... I mean,
    there must be a few that stand out as possible candidates, no?\r\n\r\nI'd be most
    grateful if anyone in the font world could venture a few guesses.\r\n\r\nMany
    thanks in advance!"
