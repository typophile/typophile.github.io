  by 20%. He'd like the type to look short and wide. I really hate distorting designed
  type in such a manner.\r\n\r\nDoes anyone have suggestions for a typeface with a
  low x height, thus giving it the appearance of being low in height and wide? Thanks!"

    <em>or</em> <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/itc-bookman/\">ITC
    Bookman</a> are wider than usual but not by 20%.\r\n\r\nWhat are you using it
    for? Text, display, logo?"

  body: "Thanks for the suggestions so far. The project is a logo. I'm not exactly
    sure why the client likes the height-condensed look. I guess, perhaps even more
    than a low x height, I need less in ascender and descenders. The Bookman, in particular,
    does a good job with this.\r\n\r\nThanks again!"

  body: I suppose you mean tall x height (i.e. short ascenders). Would Americana be
    close enough to a shortened New York? (maybe the bold cut).

  body: Try shortening the ascenders and lifting the decenders of New York and see
    how they like that. That would be my first choice since that is the typeface they
    seem interested in.
