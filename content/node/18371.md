body: I created a font family using FontLab 4.6. The family consists of regular, ital,
  bold, and bold ital. I generated the font as a Mac Suitcase Type 1. I am running
  Mac OS X. I load the font up in my system and add it to Suitcase. The new font shows
  up fine in Illustrator and Photoshop, but it shows up a bit odd in the font menu
  for Quark. The font is on the list but there is no sub menu with the bold, ital
  etc. Just the  regular weight. Any thoughts?

  body: If you style-linked the family in FLab, you're going to have to use the little
    B and I buttons in the QuarkXPress type bar thingy to switch the fonts to Bold
    and/or Italic.

  body: "i had the same problem. \r\njust a test : how does XPress react as you force
    Bold or Italics in it? \r\nif it finds the good design you can fix it (and have
    your good sub-menus) by not clickin \"this font is italic\" or \"this font is
    bold\" in FontLab...\r\nUh, not a real solution, i know"
