  <BR> <BR>The new FedEx Kinko&#39;s design is being discussed at: <BR> <BR>Foreword:

  <BR> <BR>My own take is that it&#39;s a huge improvement over Kinko&#39;s old logo,
  but the font choice for Kinko&#39;s is a bit strange. I&#39;m wondering why Landor
  would take steps to find something similar to Futura without just using a lighter
  cut of Futura.'

  body: It&#39;s a hybrid that looks as if it took all of an hour in a bullpen to
    do. The existing FedEx logo is thoughtful and precise, the rest of it a pasteup
    with a floating flower and tiny TM to distract a viewer.

    out Kinko&#39;s... Initially the mark was more like the ETrade logo. They were
    playing off the arrow in the &#34;K&#34; in Kinko&#39;s and used the colors FedEx
    currently uses with their different services. After some time they plan on dropping
    the &#34;Kinko&#39;s&#34; and just have it say FedEx Office and Print Center. '

    with the stupid flower asterisk thing? Why not just the word Kinkos in simple
    type and be done with it.  Now it is a cluttered mess.  Perhaps this was just
    &#34;corporate fencing&#34; trying to appease the old Kinkos bosses and the designers
    were just along for the ride. <BR> <BR>ChrisL'
