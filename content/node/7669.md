  body: thank you for the response, David! <BR> <BR>Yves, I do apologise for obviously
    posting a font that has already been discussed in-depth on typophile. In fact,
    before posting I searched the archives with all kind of different terms &#40;&#34;3G&#34;,
    &#34;hutchinson&#34;, &#34;3 mobile&#34;, etc.&#41; but to no avail.  <BR> <BR>Once
    I got the name, Verona, it was very easy to trace it down. <BR> <BR>Thanks and
    have a nice day!

  body: No need to apologise, Samann, it <i>is</i> a quite tricky corporate name  <BR>to
    use as a search string. I&#39;m glad we could help you out. <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"
