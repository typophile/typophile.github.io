body: "This time, I took the inspiration mostly from the Greek epigraphic style. I
  wanted to see what could be done with only straight sides and sharp angles.\r\n\r\nIt
  looks to me like a definite improvement in visibility, but it feels hard on the
  eyes and reading is slower than with a typical text face.\r\n\r\nThis leads me to
  wonder, are more rounded forms needed for better reading speed? Is all-sharp-angles
  unworkable? There are scripts that just don't have curves. I need ideas on how to
  approach those cases.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://img197.imageshack.us/img197/1879/sawtooth.png\">"

  body: "I know of no such study that looks at the influence of rounded versus angular
    letterforms on reading speed. A literature review should provide you with more
    than enough material to develop an experimental design to answer your research
    question.\r\n\r\nIf this is an academic project I would advise you ask your faculty
    to point you in the direction of someone in the psychology department of your
    school or a related one if you don\u2019t have a psychology program. An experimental
    (as opposed to clinical) psychologist with experience in the cognition would be
    a good place to start. If they do not have experience with reading, they could
    most likely point you in the right direction as has been my experience.\r\n\r\nAdditionally,
    people in the references department/help desk of a local university library would
    be more than willing to show you how to do use the databases. I recommend PsychInfo
    or Web of Science.\r\n\r\nThere may be a few articles of interest in the literature
    section of my \u201Cweb site.\u201D\r\n\r\nhttp://readthetype.com/literature/"
