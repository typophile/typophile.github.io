  Win / Publisher 2013 & Wordpad at least. I can't duplicate the problem by myself
  on any of my programs on Mac. \r\nI've had some clipping issues sometimes before
  with fonts exceeding the UPM but now the strange thing is that the font gets clipped
  directly under baseline?!\r\n\r\nAny idea what's this about?\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/unnamed_6576.png]"
