  unsure and afraid. I need your objective critique. Thanks in advance."

  body: "I'm assuming the navigation will work on the real site.\r\n\r\nSo far it
    looks good to me. I would get rid of the black background and make it either the
    same colour as the background of the page, or just a shade or two darker.\r\n\r\n

    and letterhead."

  body: "Agree with Lex about the black border.\r\n\r\nThe colors for your navigation
    fall way flat to me. The text becomes illegible over some of them. I am not crazy
    about your 'b.y.' mark. I feel the concept is good but just needs to be sharper
    and more fluid in the execution.\r\n\r\nFinally, with only those 2 pages, there
    seems to be a lack of consistency between them. They both look totally different.
    It would be better if you could make your pages fit into a master template so
    that all of your portfolio can be displayed using the nav on page one."

  body: It's coming along. Don't be so quick to fear your design work. Just think
    about your layout, make a good document grid/system of organization and hierarchy,
    and work it out. I am usually halfway into a project before I decide on the direction
    I will eventually follow.

  body: "Thanks a lot for the comments.\r\n\r\n@Lex\r\nSure, the navigation will work.
    Each of the square thumbnails will be a button. I don't want a colourful HTML
    background. The five colourful squares on the welcome page will move to the top
    and each portfolio piece will be shown on one of the five background colours.
    So the visitor will know where he/she is by the background colour. Black seems
    way too heavy though. I'll try grey.\r\n\r\nThanks for the spelling.\r\n\r\n@jayyy\r\nAs
    I wrote above, those colours will also be used as the inner background colours
    of the portfolio pieces. So they need to be muted or flat as you wrote. True,
    the colour used for \"Poster\" needs lightening. \"by\" mark is somewhat oriental
    and occult, but not the typography. Maybe you don't like that contrast? Please
    explain.\r\n\r\nAbout consistency... First one is a classical informative welcome
    page. The second one is actually the last one. Getting the welcome info to the
    second page should be quite logical. I'll try.\r\n\r\n@David Sudweeks\r\nIt's
    just uncomfortable to show off myself. There's actually a grid, it's just lenient.
    The pages are constructed on a 40px grid, all the margins, spaces etc. I don't
    feel a dictating and easily seen grid is needed here. I presume the layouts will
    be awkward, there will be different sized pieces, so space should dictate instead.
    My intention was to present my work on a quiet and minimalist layout. The visitor
    shouldn't need to think about the layout itself but only look at the work. Easy
    and direct access to the rest of the content was my another intention."
