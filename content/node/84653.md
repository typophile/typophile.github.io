body: "Hinting in the x-direction have a tendency to introduce a lot of problems (rounding
  errors?) with the spacing. Things turn out very uneven, and unfortunately also uneven
  between the Standard rendering and Cleartype. \r\n\r\nFrom what Beat told me, the
  best method is to round the left sidebearing with a single link tied to the left
  edge of the first stem, and leave the right sidebearing free. This yields relatively
  good results in CT, but looks like horseshit in greyscaled or bitmapped rendering.\r\n\r\nI
  could always go nuts with delta\u2019s, but they have the same effect on all rendering
  outputs, so <em>I\u2019m left with no way to fix something in Standard and keep
  it as is in Cleartype.</em>\r\n\r\nCan anyone shed some light on this? \r\n\r\nI\u2019m
  hinting with Fontlab, yes. I realize VTT is the next logical step, but is FL really
  that bad?\r\n\r\n"

  body: "In FontLab at least, I don't think there is a solution you could apply to
    the Standard rendering that wouldn't also have some affect on the ClearType. But
    it seems to me from your screenshots that the places where you have spacing problems
    in Standard rendering are also problematic in the ClearType.\r\n\r\nAs you note,
    you can delta the right sidebearing, but if you put x hints on the stem distances
    too, which I thought you would be doing for Standard rendering, then you have
    the option of putting a rounded link from the right side of the letter to the
    sidebearing.\r\n\r\nSo, for example, you could do something like this (greyscale
    rendering, font smoothing on at all sizes):\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/nhint_5202.png]"

  body: "The thing with the loose right edges (thank you db!) is not only a rendering
    that is more similar to the <em>real</em> weight in other environments (CT, Quartz),
    but also a counteract against the thinning you tend to see in rounds and circular
    glyphs with greyscale rendering. \r\n\r\nAnyway, from how I understand the rounded
    single/double link logic in Truetype. I would get roughly the same results if
    I linked it to the right edge of the right stem, no? I\u2019ll see if I can post
    examples of this later when I\u2019m on the other PC, but it does not become any
    better. Just worse, for CT. Btw, most of my glyphs look like your n, only without
    the rounding on the stems. My n however looks just the same without them, and
    file size is crucial for web fonts.\r\n\r\nIf you for example look at the a\u2019s
    and n\u2019s at 14 ppm, you\u2019ll see the unconsistent results."

  body: "<em>If you for example look at the a\u2019s and n\u2019s at 14 ppm, you\u2019ll
    see the unconsistent results.</em>\r\n\r\nActually, I think the inconsistency
    is in the h's and n's; the a's look comparable. Either your CT h and n counters
    are too wide or your greyscale h and n counters are too narrow. So one way to
    fix this would be to delta the right stem to make these counters wider in the
    greyscale, presuming these deltas are ignored by the CT renderers.\r\n\r\n<em>I
    would get roughly the same results if I linked it to the right edge of the right
    stem, no?</em>\r\n\r\nYou probably want to avoid hinting inwards from both sides,
    because this will tend to squish letters at sizes where the sidebearings round
    inwards. This is why I always hint from left to right across the glyph. So if
    you link from the right edge of the right stem to the right sidebearing, you want
    the stem to be the origin of that link.\r\n\r\n<em>...a counteract against the
    thinning you tend to see in rounds and circular glyphs with greyscale rendering.</em>\r\n\r\nYour
    smaller sizes are much greyer than what I was achieving at those sizes by adding
    stem hints.\r\n\r\n<em>a rendering that is more similar to the real weight in
    other environments</em>\r\n\r\nI don't usually consider 'real weight' to be a
    hinting goal. Hinting is a means to adjust outlines to make them size specific
    in crude resolutions. Stem weight is one of the factors of type design that is
    properly size specific, so I use hints to try to achieve the best weight in terms
    of legibility, stem density and contrast for each size. Subpixel rendering environments
    take this ability away to a considerable extent (in the x direction in CT and
    in both directions in Quartz at most sizes), but so long as you are trying to
    target XP greyscale too, I would consider x stem hints important."
