  body: Umm... Georgia was designed for on-screen text; it's not a display face (unless
    you mean something other than the usual meaning of "display face" a.k.a. headline
    type). It also <em>only</em> comes with old style figures.

  body: I agree. (What's up with us agreeing with each other so much lately, Hrant?)
    It looks odd when you have old style numbers set alongside all-caps. I like old
    style numbers, but there are situations in which they are inappropriate. Hybrid
    numbers would have been a better choice for general use.
