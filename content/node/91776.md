body: "I'd like to start building a simple, solid family, with 3 weights + italics.
  \r\n\r\nThe problem is I 'm usually stuck on my first font \u2014 the moment I start
  adding anchors for diacritics, I decide to rework a letter here or there. And then
  I have to redo kerning pairs. There's such a heckload of phases that I'm not sure
  if I'm doing it right.\r\n\r\nI know everyone has their own way of doing things
  but what's \"normal\"?\r\nWhat order do these phases usually come in your workflow?
  \r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>Basic Characters, Numerals</li>\r\n<li>Punctuation, Symbols,
  ligatures</li>\r\n<li>Alternate characters/Opentype features</li>\r\n<li>Drawing
  extreme bold weights</li>\r\n<li>Drawing Italics</li>\r\n<li>Autogenerating Diacritics</li>\r\n<li>Kerning
  pairs</li>\r\n<li>Hinting (? haven't even attempted yet) </li>\r\n<li>Interpolation
  of middle weights</li>\r\n</ol>"

  body: "The first thing you have to do? Resign yourself to the fact that (good) type
    design is highly iterative! And it's worth going very slow at the concept stage,
    making sure things like \"n\" and \"o\" are just right.\r\n\r\nThat said, when
    you consider that nothing can be perfect, there comes a point where you don't
    want to keep going back to change things, and you can start going very fast.\r\n\r\nKerning:
    Don't actually do any until your spacing is optimal; optimal spacing however <em>does</em>
    take into account that kerning is there to help.\r\n\r\nBTW, four weights are
    more than 4/3 better than three weights.  :-)\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: So seeing all the professional superfamilies out there, I wonder do designers
    actually do kerning on the interpolated weights, or is that automated, too?
