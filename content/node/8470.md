body: In my own attempts at making fonts I have tried to induce controlled variation,
  for example in Frimbo Sans the lower case &#34;u&#34; is not a perfect miniature
  of its big sibling. I&#39;ve also been playing with open type a bit, trying to create
  rules for random substitutions that are below conscious perception. My belief is
  that variation, when done below the threshold of conscious visibility, enhance readability.
  Human beings have evolved remarkable pattern recognition skills. One function these
  skills served our ancestors was to allow them to detect both order in seeming chaos
  of their habitat and small changes in that environment. Those who couldn&#39;t do
  this were either protected by those who could, or didn&#39;t live long. At this
  point seeing patterns and seeking variation is built in. When we find differences
  it heightens our awareness and our focus. I believe, though can&#39;t prove, that
  a text set with unpredictable, near subliminal variation would be easier and psychologically
  more compelling to read. When manuscripts were handwritten variation was unavoidable,
  when letters were cast in lead, smeared with ink and pressed into wet, coarse paper,
  variations were unavoidable. Reading texts like this is generally considered aesthetically
  enjoyable. Every effort I&#39;ve seen to capture the roughness of these technologies
  retains a single glyph for each character. Two open type scripts have recently been
  released that attempt to capture the subtlety of human handwriting with complex
  rules. I would like to see an example where, for example, the letter &#34;t&#34;
  has five, ten, or even more different forms as would many of the other characters.
  Each variation would be, at point sizes below those used for display, imperceptible
  unless you were actively trying to spot them. Have any fonts done this? If not,
  how would one implement it? Can one treat a collection as an array and construct
  open type rules to randomly select a character from that array each time the glyph
  is called by an application?
