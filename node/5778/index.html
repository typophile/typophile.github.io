With regard to Bell, I first dated my answer to that of John Bell's specimens; then I recalled, just as you have written, that &quot;Bell&quot; wasn't released by that name until 1930 by Monotype, and so I changed my answer. In a moment of blind panic combined with nightmarish PSAT recall (&quot;your first answer is usually the right one&quot; &ndash; whatever the hell that means), I changed my answer back. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->That question was indeed make-or-break, and I just happened to get fairly lucky.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Jon</div>

		<div class="commentbody">With regards to the ordering of fonts, the stated rules were that one was supposed to use the date of the original design, not the revival. Of course, on that basis the quizmasters goofed in marking Interstate as 1993. As Nick says, they were inconsistent. But they did say how it was supposed to work. (Of course, it was a pretty noisy environment, so it's not a shock that Nick didn't hear this rule being explained.) <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I *think* I would have gotten three more points had this question been marked correctly.
