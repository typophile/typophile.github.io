  old (pre 1950's, letterpress?) publication so not a new distressed version of an
  older font.\r\n\r\nThanks a lot!\r\n\r\n//Hanna\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/serif_4516.png]"

  body: Given the clumsy spacing in places, it may not be foundry type at all, but
    output from a Varityper Composing machine, in which case it would have been printed
    by offset lithography, rather than letterpress...
