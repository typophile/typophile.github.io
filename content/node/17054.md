  body: "Reminds me to old penmanship writing lesson books. The lower p and r looking
    very accient. Some glyphs would look better on word beginnings and endings without
    their connection stroke. The upper case N sems to be broken. Maybe you can enhance
    the design if you try to write like some would write today, trying to catch this
    penman style. - So you have two designs, the 1900 and the 2000 version. :-) The
    connections look ok, since this is an adaption of handwriting for metal. Using
    Opentype features could give a closer impression of hand writing. \r\n\r\ntry
    to search for some of these little lesson books for more inspiration: C. C. Lister's

    sharp final curve. It has grown on me, but I did read the /m/ and /n/ as /nc/
    and /nc/ the first time around. \r\n\r\n/or/ -- the connecting stroke in between
    these to characters seems a little flat\r\n\r\n/he/ -- there is a little bump
    happening from the exit on the /h/ and the entry on the /e/ -- looking again the
    same problem occurs with /de/ so I would guess the problem is with the /e/\r\n\r\n/Re/
    -- the connection seems a little stiff\r\n\r\n/t/ -- entry stroke seems stiff\r\n\r\nOverall
    color -- very nice. I could say that some of the letters could use a little more
    of that filling in that letters such as the /f/ has. The caps all have it and
    I really like it. This feels like copperplate engraving and it is gorgeous. I
    freak out a little when letters are so thin and often call them spindly and without
    spine, but this ultra-refined, even haute couture-esque. \r\n\r\nOh well. I will
    say it anyway. I love this. I just wish the lowercase had a little more of the
    same \"filled-in\" or \"cut too deep\" spots."

    I say weights I mean the filled-in bits get fatter, and the contrast increases.
    Not the overall letter gets fatter. "

    a bit. New attachment to initial message called \"Allyson Pro\" shows all the
    bells and whistles... well not ALL.\r\n\r\nalso, i've almost completed a cyrillic
    component to go along with this one. does anyone think it would be worthwhile
    to finish that up as well?"

  body: The pro set comes with The OT font and all glyphs can be accessed through
    the glyph pallette in InDesign and Illustrator. The regular version of the font
    and an "Xtras" font is also supplied in the pro set to make some features more
    accessible for users of programs such as word or photoshop, or whatever. These
    can be input by the alt method. No pdf documentation yet, but that's a very good
    idea. I should get on that...
