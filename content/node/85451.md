body: "I'm trying to identify a font used on the [[http://www.unlvrebels.com|UNLV
  Rebels]] website.  It's in the mast heading on the page, and also used when you
  click on the Rebel TV tab:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/unlv2_4225.gif]\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/rebel_5368.jpg]\r\n\r\nThe
  font seems to have a bit of a serif, but only on the upper-left of most characters,
  and in the top-bar only of the 'E' (not the middle or lower bar).\r\n\r\nAny ideas?\r\n\r\n\r\nThanks!"
