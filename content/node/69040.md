body: "Hello all, a two for one special Easter deal!\r\n\r\nI've been tasked with
  creating a sub-brand based on the organisation's existing logotype. Unfortunately,
  the style guide isn't much help, nor can I contact the original designer. I wondered
  if someone could please help me narrow down what these are?\r\n\r\nThere are two
  faces:\r\n\r\n1. The word 'Plan'. A heavy rounded sans with asymmetrical counters.
  At first, I thought the designer had taken something like VAG or Futura Rounded
  into Illustrator and messed with the strokes, thicks and thins, but the lowercase
  'a' doesn't fit.\r\n\r\n2. The tagline 'Be a part of it.' Distressed, but both the
  lowercase 'a's have the same pattern of flecks around them. I don't have a larger
  sample with more letterforms in it.\r\n\r\nAny ideas would be much appreciated.
  Thanks in advance."

    charity. The first sample is just the logotype of the organisation; I doubt that
    there are more letters than just these four. The tagline is set in \u2018Plan
    Storytelling\u2019, a bespoke typeface created&thinsp;\u2014&thinsp;as far as
    I know&thinsp;\u2014&thinsp;by Adobe. To learn more about it, you probably have
    to contact Plan."
