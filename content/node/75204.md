  two takes on a similar logo. I am partial to 1,3,4. And I'd like to ask the forum
  if having the Grinder clamp act as a \"G\" is cliche at all.\r\n\r\nBackground:
  This will be the logo for a small specialty shop as well as a mobile truck serving
  homemade sausages (traditional/unique). Catering to an after hours crowd ages 21-35.\r\n\r\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exploitation_film\r\n\r\nThanks!"

    I had to guess the target group I\u2019d say splatter film freaks.\r\n\r\nIt doesn\u2019t
    say traditional to me but it DOES say unique. In a way.\r\nI guess it could work
    for a small business, willing to take the risk (of grossing out potential cutomers)
    in order to (possibly) establish a very unique brand.\r\nA GrindHaus truck driving
    by is definitely something to stick in one\u2019s brain for quite a while.\r\n\r\nFor
    the logo:\r\n\r\n- the grinder looks very industrial to me. Doesn\u2019t work
    for homemade sausages IMHO\r\n- I think a logo like this requires a very careful
    use of colours. Yellow looks purulent, purple reminds of veins and old meat.\r\n-
    i\u2019d avoid any kind of grunge/worn look. Nobody wants to eat food from a dirty/filthy
    place.\r\n- the G in No. 2 could only work if the \u2018RIND HAUS\u2019 was in
    the same colour as the G (the clamp). Then again, it emphasises the clamp, not
    the grinder.\r\n\r\nSo I think the best way this could work was a reworked clean
    monochrome version, maybe with rounded edges in order to add a little softness/friendliness/wink.
    If you use colours, look for \u2018butcher-friendly\u2019 colours (with a rather
    bold logo like this I\u2019d avoid red \u2013 green could be a good choice)\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\nAri"

    or a bar.\r\n\r\nIf I were buying sausage, I wouldn't want to think of how it
    was made. The name reminds me enough without having to look at an image of a gritty,
    dirty grinder.\r\n\r\nI'd suggest reworking this from the start. What kind of
    image are you trying to convey for your client? Based on nothing but my own opinions,
    I'd go with a clean, retro 50s look, evoking the friendly neighborhood milkman.
    Maybe in baby blue, white, and red.\r\n\r\nIf you want to appeal to the \"foodie\"
    crowd (upper age range of your demographic), maybe focus on the handcrafted aspect
    of the sausages. <a href=\"http://www.jbfinecheese.com/index2.html\" target=\"_blank\">This</a>
    is a local cheese shop with a nice clean image that is probably closer to what
    you want.\r\n\r\n - Lex"

    But this is really the vision of the clients. I am simply working within the given
    parameters. As far as I'm concerned, who's to know if this is the wrong imagery
    for a sausage shop just because a few people (me included) think it is. The people
    behind the company have worked in the food industry for a long time, their investors
    trust them, so I guess I'm willing to.\r\n\r\nThanks for the FB\r\n"

    scene in that Pink Floyd video when the children blindly march into a meat grinder.
    Not exactly the place I'd want to eat dinner!\r\n\r\nIf you're forced to use a
    meat grinder, there must be a less-ominous, less violent-looking way to portray
    it? Maybe even if it were a \"stainless steel\" grinder instead of black?\r\n\r\nEven
    so, I might try harder to convince my client that a visual of the grinder itself
    might not be the most appetizing way of selling sausage. I mean, heck, \"sausage
    making\" is <strong><em>actually the phrase used</em></strong> to describe something
    revolting! Why would you use a VISUAL of \"sausage making\" as a logo? It's a
    bit like using a photo of a bloody, decapitated pig to sell honey baked ham. \r\n\r\nOh,
    and I have about 20 years experience in the restaurant industry. Before I went
    back to college for graphic design, when opening a new restaurant, I hired qualified
    designers to help craft an effective identity package. Sure, I had ideas based
    on my restaurant expertise....but I knew I didn't have the visual design and marketing
    skills to excel at logo development. In other words; convince your client to trust
    you. If you believe a meat grinder logo will hurt their business, tell them! Show
    them what would reach a broader, more targeted audience. That's what logo development
    is all about!"

    awesome.\r\n\r\nI second the not noticing the tag line. As far as the typography,
    the only thing that I notice is in the perspective version-- the S seems to ascend
    much more than the others while its baseline stays relatively in keeping with
    the others. \r\n\r\nTo my eye that S seems slightly wrong in its perspective."

  body: "hey dude, there's small problem i find with the 3/4 view of the grinder.\r\nwhile
    much better than the other version the fact that theres so much of an angle means
    that its hard to see both 'the' and 'grind'\r\nmight i suggest making it less
    acute.. and maybe placing 'the' in more centred on the side of the grinder.\r\ni
    only say this because when your dealing with walk-in/by clientele you need to
    be able to immediately communicate how cool you are and what your offering (probably
    in the other way around..) the extra 2 seconds it takes for people to say 'oh
    its grind' and the other 2 to notice 'the' could hurt business.. just saying..\r\n\r\ni
    think the concept is really cool, brilliant approach to a fairly original idea.
    i like the two-color logo on the top right. but i think maybe you should explore
    blue and red (?) whenever i hear butchers stores i think of red white and blue..
    i think this juxtaposed with your logo could work well... now doubt you've already
    tried this..\r\ni think maybe your grinder and the black outline on the text should
    be of the same darkness.. in my opinion it would give the logo more fluidity..\r\ni
    hope the business goes well\r\n\r\nkia ora bro\r\n"

  body: "I like the logo, looks cool and exciting. I'd definitely like to try some
    of their sausages, but they'd have to work pretty hard to make them as exciting
    as the logo. I'm into offal and sausages etc, so it would be good if they could
    make a type of sausage that was hard and dry, not too much fat and definitely
    no stringy bits - that's if they make cured sausages rather than the fresh stuff.\r\n\r\nThat
    said, #4 looks best but I think that the perspective is a little wrong. You have
    a vanishing point to the left but the word \"The\" doesn't vanish in the same
    direction as the words \"Grind Haus\". I think that the design would benefit from
    drawing some temporary grid lines to position the perspective effect (take out
    later). You might also have to bend the meat grinder a little to get it completely
    into the right perspective.\r\n\r\nAlso the words \"Los Angeles\" have some problems:
    1. Are not in the same perspective (don't get bigger as they approach the viewer.)
    2. Different feeling font 3. Bit hard to read when put over the other font, esp
    if reproduced in B&W. My suggestion: Use smaller point size of same font as \"Grind
    Haus\", put it under the word \"Haus\", put it in same perspective as \"Grind
    Haus\". This will help to reinforce the \"coming at you\" feel of the logo."
