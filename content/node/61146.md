  finally I released Discord. Inspired in the machine aesthetics and in the human
  conflict with them, Discord is a flexible family of sixteen fonts designed to be
  used in a wide range of work. Ready for multilingual support and with advanced OpenType
  features such as Small Caps and Old Style Numbers.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.nedertype.com/index.php?/project/discord/\">Take
  a look!</a>\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/neder/discord/\">[img:sites/default/files/old-images/PromoTypophile_5544.png]</a>"
