<div class="post-content e-content" itemprop=articleBody>Hihi, I'm a graphic design student from Canada and I was wondering if anyone else had ever come accross with the problem of bilingual forms. <br> <br>Recently, for my typographic grid class my teacher assigned us with a very horrible looking form from a nearby university. Basically there are two copies of this form, one is in english and the other one in french. Our job is to redesign this form so that a) it's only one page and b) it's much more attractive than the previous one. <br> <br>Unfortunately, forms already tend to be packed with lots of information so it's kinda hard to keep in legible and <b>bilingual</b> on one page ... <br> <br>Any suggestions?</div>
<div class="comment card m-3">
<div class=card-body>
<div class=commentbody>I think the whole point of being a design student is to learn how to solve problems. On your own and in your own unique way. Your assignment sounds like a wonderful opportunity to get your hands dirty. Why start off by asking around here? Go and do the job.</div>

<div class=commentbody>1. Allocate equal space for each language, but always allow for the longer (French) <br> <br>2. Use a different (though harmonious) type style for each of the two languages <br> <br>3. Don't be afraid to use rules to organize and separate items, and background tints to suggest hierarchy: although the tendency with modernism is to remove non-typographic elements, that's not the best strategy for complex forms. <br> <br>4. You won't find this kind of work in awards shows/annuals (it's not Hollywood enough) However, it is amongst the purest and most demanding aspects of graphic design. Take a look at some of Erik Spiekermann's forms design -- he obviously loves and respects this kind of work, and even manages to bring some style to it. (Sorry, can't remember where I saw the examples.)</div>

<div class=commentbody>I really don't see how Shannon is whining. <br> <br>-- <br> <br>I think there are two possible strategies: make the two languages visually as close as possible; or apply some cultural sensitivity and risk the wrath of the cross-eyed Modernists. <br> <br>The first option is pretty easy. But it might result in the functional quicksand like in Emil Ruder's monolithic (in contentually great) textbook. <br> <br>The second option might benefit from using totally different fonts for each language. Ladislas Mandel for example insists that French type needs to have a smaller x-height. This would actually help in the technical realm too, since French will generally run longer (like Nick says). You could also be more conservative and simply apply width (friendliness versus elegance) by using an MM font with a width axis, and making the French font slightly narrower, which would also help with balancing the space usage. Note however that smaller x-heights and narrowness will make the French have a smaller apparent size, and some people might interpret this as "less important" (although others might see it as "discrete", which fortunately happens to be in cultural character). One thing you could do to counter this is put the French first, like on the left or on top. You could also use a bit more leading to make it seem "larger" in a different way. <br> <br>BTW, there are some great articles in old issues of the journal Visible Language about multilingual typography. <br> <br>hhp <br></div>

<div class=commentbody>French more longer than English is a legend created by bad translators. I do most of my publications English French, and in many case my English is more longer (Yes, I'm one of these bad translator to English, so more long). :-) <br> <br>A very recent example from this afternoon: I just edited the French texts of the Avenir Next specimen. Booth English and French came from German source. My job was to edit the French, as the original translation was bad (BabelFish have done perhaps better job than that one). <br> <br>The main conceptual text take 1642 signs in French, 1708 in English. English more longer! <br> <br>Each language has his owns habits don't try to make them identical, its a stupid 50's universal approach. <br> <br>Sometimes, one language will take more space than another for many reasons, subject, translation, style of the writer, sometimes its the reverse. Who know the truth?</div>

<div class=commentbody>>many case my English is more longer <br> <br>The rule I have heard is that generally a translation is longer than the original language. This makes sense as the writer, if he or she is good, will use the resources of the original language to be compact and forceful. A translation can't do that without being a re-write. </div>

<div class=commentbody>Although [literal] translation adds about 10-15%, some languages are still more verbose than others. English is generally very terse, while Latin languages (except Latin itself!) are more verbose. <br> <br>It's rare to find good benchmarks of language economy, but a handy one is Zhukov and Sadek's "Typographia polyglotta", which shows official, very tight, but <i>non-literal</i> versions of the UN Charter in 20+ languages. It shows that the main Latin languages run about 10-15% longer than English. So when you couple that to sloppy translation you can get a huge expansion. When Jorge de Buen translated my "Improving the Tool" essay (~2,500 words) into Spanish and got a gain of only 14%, that was pretty impressive - the UN Charter is 17% longer. <br> <br>BTW, an Armenian from Lebanon has four "unofficial" languages! :-/ <br> <br>hhp <br></div>

<div class=commentbody>Nick's recommendations are excellent and that's <br>how I usually go about it (Belgium has two main <br>official languages, Dutch and French, so we have <br>to do bilingual stuff quite regularly). I had to do a <br>newsletter in four languages once (Dutch, French, <br>English and German) and I got away with it by using <br>ITC Officina, as it has four distinct variations (even <br>to the non-typographic eye): Sans, Sans Italic, Serif, <br>Serif Italic. I designated the styles according to <br>"verbosity": German was set in Sans Italic whereas <br>on the other side of the spectrum Serif was used <br>for English. By keeping identical positioning of the <br>languages in relation to each other (they always <br>were grouped in blocks of four) and by using subtle <br>colour coding it worked out all right.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Furthermore it always helps to deconstruct your form <br>into information zones and treat them as units. <br>Don't be afraid to add a header or - as Nick pointed <br>out - separate different information zones with rules, <br>blocks or tinted areas. If your form is structured in <br>a logical manner than adding a second language <br>won't be as difficult and won't create confusion.</div>

<div class=commentbody>The thing I'm most proud of is (was) a bilingual <br>magazine about theater, not the artistic but the <br>technical aspects. <br>All pages throughout the magazine were cut in half <br>horizontally. Top half Dutch, body copy set in <a href="http://www.philsfonts.com/detail.html?sku=FF01111801P2" target=_blank> FF Scala</a>; <br>lower half French, with a tinted background, set in <br><a href="http://www.philsfonts.com/detail.html?sku=FF01111901P2" target=_blank> FF Scala Sans</a> (it was the pre-<a href="http://www.philsfonts.com/detail.html?sku=FF01117801P2" target=_blank> FF Seria</a> days). All <br>titles in semi-deconstructed setting (to allow <br>bilingual setting) along the division line. Images <br>clustered as much as possible along the divison <br>line as well in order to emphasize the horizontal <br>forward motion of the magazine. <br> <br>Unfortunately I never got the time nor budget to <br>fully explore this, but when it worked, it worked. <br>It got copied by at least two other magazines. <br>The bastards. <img src=http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif alt=:-) border=0></div>

<div class=commentbody>Shannon, it's school. Experiment. I agree with others: add titles, use icons, make one language oriented up and the other down, so you can't read the other unless you flip it. Whatever. It's better to crash and burn spectacularly than be silently disregarded. Enjoy finding new ways to display information. Your wackiest ideas may whittle down into the most innovative/ effective. <br> <br>Also, we don't know why your demos were "trashed" so offering guidance is a bit tricky...</div>

<div class=commentbody><i>John did you hear about the national Eubonics</i> (sic) <i>beauty contest?</i> <br> <br>That sounds like the beginning of a great joke. What's the punchline? <br> <br>Just spotted the typo: Ebonics, not Eubonics. Eubonics refers to the making of really good little cakes. <img src=http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif alt=:-) border=0></div>

<div class=commentbody>WOW~ <br> <br>I really didn't expect so many replies. First I'd like to thank you all for your helpful suggestions and you'll all be happy to know I handed in my form and I think my teacher smirked when he was grading my piece .... <br> <br>I still don't know if that's a good thing or not. At any rate to answer Chris' question ... I believe my first drafts were trashed because the first one was "too symmetrical" (but I thought it was easier to read). And the second one was too simple (which I thought was the point of a form). <br> <br>Either way, I learned a lot about form making that's for sure. Everytime I see a bilingual magazine now, I quiver ...</div>

<div class=commentbody>Also, regarding the whole whining thing. I wasn't whining at all ... it's just that I have 8 classes, that are each 3 hours and that are basically all graphic design classes. Which means that for every class I have 2 hours of research and 6 hours of homework to do per week (minimum). You do the math and you'll realize that they're aren't enough hours in the day to allow me to do that. <br> <br>Then again, that's school for you. However, time because very precious to you in school as well as in the work place. No one likes to waste 6 hours working hard and then being told that what you did was "worse than the original" piece the teacher gave you. Which is what my teacher had told me. So yeah ... I was frustated, but I wasn't trying to whine. I'm sorry if some people felt like I was. I was merely frustated and had a mental block for my project. <br> <br>I believe that's called being human.</div>
