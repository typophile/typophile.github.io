body: I know there are a ton of free font renamers out there that will rename the
  file name of a font to match the actual font name, but does anyone know of any free
  PC software that will rename family names of fonts? Any help would be greatly appreciated.
  Thanx!

  body: "I've renamed plenty of my fonts to reflect foundries/designers before, so
    that I can have (for example) different Helveticas on my system at the same time,
    and so that \"Adobe Garamond\" is under \"Garamond\" where it belongs, not alphabetized
    with the \"A\"s. I also converted some of my old postscript fonts to Opentype
    with Fontlab and named them so that I would know they were my conversions, should
    enhanced OT versions become available in the future from the vendor. I also have
    an aesthetic disagreement with vendors putting a trademark symbol in the font
    name.\r\n\r\nBut Fontlab/Fontographer are certainly overkill for that task alone
    -- I'm curious what suggestions people have, as well."

    instances you are probably going against the EULA which applies to the font software
    you licensed.

  body: "If your font is Open Type you can also use <a href=\"http://www.letterror.com/code/ttx/index.html\"><strong>ttx</strong></a>
    which comes with <a href=\"http://www.adobe.com/devnet/opentype/afdko/\"><strong>AFDKO</strong></a>:
    \ first apply ttx on your ttf or otf font, then replace all occurrences of the
    font name by the new name in the resulting ttx textfile and finally apply ttx
    on it. On a unix system (a Mac for instance), you can avoid hand editing the ttx
    file thanks to the Unix <strong>sed</strong> command. You can then do everything
    with a three line unix script.\r\n\r\nMichel\r\n"

  body: "Converting a font also voids and support or assistance you might receive
    from a foundry in the event of a problem. As someone who troubleshoots font issues
    regularly, I would have to say that \"converted\" fonts often cause a disproportionate
    amount of problems. Font naming is just one issue. As mentioned in other threads,
    FontLab's \"green gem\" auto-naming icon is not sufficient to ensure fonts will
    work in all applications or across  operating systems. A converted font is just
    like a piece of software that has not been tested. It might work, but the probability
    of failure is higher. That's why, for example, you can have confidence in Adobe's
    fonts--the same files I'm using have been tested by hundreds of thousands of users.
    In the case of small vendors like Mr. Shinn, there may be relatively fewer customers.
    However the foundry takes personal responsibility for making the product function
    correctly. \r\n\r\nA lot of fonts that people think are \"corrupt\" or \"damaged\"
    didn't damage themselves..."

  body: "Concerning font renaming, here is a message taken from a publicly accessible
    list, dated  Oct 1, 2007 (four days ago):<dl><dd>\r\n<cite>\r\nI'm trying to change
    the Computer Modern fonts [...] from having lowercase names to having uppercase
    names since all the PDF's I have refer to the uppercase (resulting in font not
    found errors in Illustrator or whatever). To this end, I wrote a [...] script
    to convert the names, but... this script apparently does more then just convert
    the \r\nnames to uppercase - it seems to corrupt a few glyphs. \r\n</cite>\r\n</dd></dl>The
    font editor was not FontLab and the bug has been corrected since then but this
    reminds us that we should always keep a copy of the original font on a stable
    support (CD Rom, DVD) to make sure we can restore it when needed.\r\n\r\nMichel\r\n"
