  body: "[I posted this comment almost 3 years ago, but it's still true.]\r\nEvery
    tattoo is done by hand, and therefore is unique, which is the beauty of tattoos.\r\nNow
    for the grumpy pedantic part: The way I understand the meaning of \"font,\" it's
    a set of letters created for mechanical, optical, or digital reproduction. The
    lettering in a tattoo can be a hand-drawn copy of a font, but it won't be a font
    until they invent a tattoo robot."

  body: 'Sorry zunelle but, even if I can''t agree more with Victor, you should reconsider
    your point of view for this one. I''m 100% positive. The base font is definitely
    Burgues Script. Have a look to the [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/sudtipos/burgues-script/regular/glyphs.html|glyph
    palette]] if you need more flourish letters. And for the rest, it has been modified
    and adapted to look more "tattoo": letters have been outlined and some flourishes
    reworked to look more "pointy"'
