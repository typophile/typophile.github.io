  a film production company called 'Bread & Circus'. Was thinking of a classic typeface
  that could stand the test of time. Any ideas or suggestions would be appreciated.

  body: "\"Panem et circenses,\" I believe is the reference for the name of the company.
    \ It comes from Satires X, a Latin poem by Juvenal critiquing the Roman people
    after they acceded to an imperial rule in place of their (somewhat democratic)
    senatorial republic.  Juvenal commented that people were willing to give up their
    political freedom in exchange for \"bread and circuses.\"\r\n\r\nI suggest something
    that creates the image of Roman type etched in marble, such as <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/singles/rimmer/rtf_albertan_inline/\">RTF
    Albertan Inline</a>."

- body: Bread and Circus used to be a big grocery store chain in the Northeast - I
    think they were bought out by Whole Foods. I'd avoid looking anything like their
    identity.  [img:sites/default/files/old-images/bread_circus_alewife_4760.jpg]
