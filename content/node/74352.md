body: "Hi all. After lurking for a while, I've decided to post an in-progress font
  for review and criticism. My intent for it is to be usable at body sizes, and I'd
  love to get the hints done well enough for it to be usable on-screen. It will be
  OpenType with TrueType contours.\r\n\r\nThere are more glyphs created than I'm showing
  here, but this ought to be enough of a sample to get some feedback on. Please let
  me know if you need anything else from me.\r\n\r\nThanks! I appreciate your help.\r\n\r\nDerek\r\n\r\n<a

    look good, looks pretty deformed.\r\n\r\nP.S. - You could show some better quality
    image, with nicer edges. Looks like it's made in PS."

    should have excluded them from the sample until I am happier with them.\r\n\r\nI've
    edited the original post with a link to a pdf.\r\n\r\nDerek\r\n"

  body: "Great design!\r\n\r\nP and smallcap P have a heavy spot at the bottom of
    the bowl, where it's more curved on the outside and more straight on the inside.
    Pick one.\r\n\r\n4 is light. S is a little light on top. Lowercase s is light
    all over and needs a lot of curve work.\r\n\r\nThere is just a bit of a lump on
    the outer lower left of the bowl of g and q. There is also something wobbly about
    the parentheses that I can't quite put my finger on.\r\n\r\nBy whatever accident,
    the right square bracket is heavier than the left one. Obvious when you look at
    it, but I know how easy it is to never look at your brackets again.\r\n\r\nSince
    you intend this for body use, your asterisk should default to a superscript form.
    But hold onto the big one as an alternate; some people will want it for something.\r\n"

  body: "@cerulean: Thanks for the feedback! I see what you're talking about in each
    case. I'll get to those corrections. The large asterisk results from the years
    I've spent looking at fonts in Visual Studio -- I like a large asterisk. But I
    think your suggestion about making the superscript version the norm makes good
    sense. If I ever do a monospaced version for use in text editors, I'll make the
    full-height one the norm then.\r\n\r\nDerek\r\n"

  body: "I've made the suggested changes (except making the 4 heavier, which I totally
    overlooked). I've got it roughly kerned the way I like, but there's more work
    to do on that. I'm about to dive into hinting.\r\n\r\nAgain, feedback is greatly
    appreciated.\r\n\r\nThe latest: <a href=\"http://www.fileden.com/files/2010/9/19/2973670//melodio_sample3.pdf\">melodio
    sample 3</a>\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\nDerek\r\n\r\nP.S. - I think allowing auto-hyphenation
    on German with English as my default language has caught me on \"Grundbegriffen\".
    Oops!"
