  and all the gave me was an old flag with my town's symbol and some crazy looking
  font.\r\nThis specific font has a very old school look, i would say that has some
  celtic inspiration.\r\nSo far, i found a similar font which is Teaberry Regular,
  but still not quite the same.\r\n\r\nhttp://img830.imageshack.us/img830/2466/mangualde3.jpg\r\n\r\nhttp://img822.imageshack.us/img822/1410/mangualde.jpg\r\n\r\nThese
  are some images from the font itself, sorry for not being able to post them directly.\r\n\r\nReally
  need help on this one guys!\r\n\r\nStay well!!\r\n"

  body: This particular style of ornamentation dates from the 1870s or 1880s, during
    which time most American foundries simply numbered their ornamented faces, rather
    than naming them. There were hundreds of such faces and, assuming that whoever
    made this flag actually copied an existing typeface rather that just concocting
    this particular one (always a possibility in a non-print project), your chances
    of finding an exact match may be slim and/or none...

    though the [[http://new.myfonts.com/search/tag%3Atuscan|Tuscan]] tag at myfonts
    and there should be three or four.\r\n\r\nedit: We've got the same search methods,
    apparently. ;)"
