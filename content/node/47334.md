  to use it in Photoshop 7.0; I can't seem to figure out how to access all the beautiful
  swashes and other goodies. I have read Adobe's help file on Opentype faces and it
  really hasn't helped very much. I have opened the Character palette, opened the
  extra window with the arrows on the top right, turned on the Ligatures, etc. still
  nothing happens. Sigh. Any help would really, truly be appreciated.\r\n\r\nThank
  you in advance for your time,\r\n\r\nBethany "

  body: what does "nothing happens" mean? You try to copy and paste from the character
    palette and it doesn't work?

    you also have Illustrator you can set the text there (usign the the Illustrator
    glyph palette) and then copy & paste the result to Photoshop. There is no easy
    way to access all glyphs in an OpenType font in Photoshop."

  body: I second the suggestion to set the text in Illustrator. Setting OTF in Photoshop
    just makes my head hurt, lol.

  body: "I have opened the Character Map in Windows and it doesn't even show all the
    glyphs/ligatures, it just shows all the \"main\" characters. And I have selected
    the text before turning on the Ligatures/Discretionary Ligatures. I am purchasing
    Illustrator CS3 today because this is just such a pain to figure out, and from
    what everyone seems to say Illustrator will work with Opentype fonts much easier.
    Do you think this is an accurate statement? I just don't want to waste $400. Thanks
    for any advice!\r\n\r\nBest,\r\n\r\nBethany"

    may not show up in the Character Map. In Illustrator you have access to ALL characters
    in the font and copy & paste from Illustrator will work. \r\n"
