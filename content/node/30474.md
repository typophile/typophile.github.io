  body: "The new Saks Fifth Avenue type layout seems so corporate -- it is cold and
    lacks the personality of the former logos. Maybe they want something to reflect
    how it feels when you go inside to shop?\r\n\r\nI love the one from 1955. It's
    so, so... European, fun and playful. Or maybe, I'm just so familiar with it, as
    the 50s were a time for me to play in Saks and get invited to their Christmas
    parties for employees' children...\r\n\r\nWith lettering like they want this January
    - well, they might as well be a bloomingdale's.\r\n\r\nAnd Sakro - please answer
    Bald's question. Are you looking for a similar font - because a few of us are
    brave enough to start looking for one for you."
