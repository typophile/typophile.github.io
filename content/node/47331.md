  body: Hmm, that's very odd. Perhaps a customized or degraded Bodega Sans Oldstyle.
    The bones just <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/singles/font_bureau/bodega_sans_medium_oldstyle/?sample_text=Specialty%20American&sample_size=74">match
    too well</a> to be anything else. What is the source?

  body: It's a book cover. I have no idea how old the book is, but Bodega was released
    in 1990. Is it possible that it was derived from an earlier font?
