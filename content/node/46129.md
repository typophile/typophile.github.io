  characters but I don't even know which langauge are they in. Who can identify them?
  How can I pull them out of a font to know their actual typographic shape?\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/mazao_4536.jpg]"

    I don\u2019t know of the right one, perhaps \u201C\u7DAD\u201D?\r\n\r\nYou should
    ask Chinese people about it.\r\n"
