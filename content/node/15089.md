body: "Hi there,\r\n\r\nCan someone please explain to me why two typefaces at the
  same point size will not necessarily have the same x-height? \r\n\r\nI've always
  undestood point size to be a standard unit of measurement that measures the x-height
  of a typeface. And yet, changing the font on some text set at, say, 45 point, yields
  many different x-heights. What's point size actually meant to measure?\r\n\r\nThanks."

  body: "The point size stands for the body of the typeface (a heritage of the metal
    printing era when type was casted on a body of a determined point size).\r\n\r\nThe
    relative dimensions of type are not related directly to the body size and so there
    are typefaces with greater x height than anothers, longer or shorter ascenders
    and descenders, etc...\r\n\r\nH\xE9ctor"

      within that 45 point space?\r\n\r\nThanks again."

  body: "Yes, anything can happen within the point size. Different x-heights will
    be more appropriate for different situations - and I hope I'm right here - typically
    larger x-heights are more common for text that is on screen - because on screen,
    at smaller sizes, it becomes less legible. Compare verdana, a font designed for
    screen, and garamond, a print font.\r\nAt smaller point sizes, verdana is easier
    to read because it has a larger x-height. Think of it as a ratio - x-height:point
    size"

    target=\"new\">hand set metal type</a>. Note the position of the caps and the
    room below the baseline to accommodate descenders (none showing). \r\n\r\nAlso
    note that hand set type was positioned upside down and backwards. This image shows
    a simple sans serif, but imagine if you had to put back script or blackletter
    fonts after printing.\r\n"

  body: "You will prpbably all recall that in the seventies up to the mid-nineties
    ITC in working with URW produced all of their fonts with a common set of parameters:
    the Cap height, x-height and descent was identical. trade typesetter in matching
    up to a previously set piece of work had a clear plastic scale showing the cap
    height  for each size feom 5 point to 48 point. By laying the scale on a cap they
    could tell very accurately what the point size was.\r\n\r\nA god many designers
    felt that something was lost in giving Bembo the same proportions as Baskerville,
    and I had to agree. Nonetheless their fonts were simply top work.\r\n\r\nJim"
