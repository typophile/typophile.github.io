body: 'For anyone who may have been interested in my post of some time ago concerning
  the romanization character below &#40;I can&#39;t find the original post&#41;, the
  &#34;mystery&#34; has been solved. <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/30/53698.jpg"
  alt="Romanization"> <BR> <BR>Dr. Lauren Pfister of Hong Kong brought my attention
  to the following details: <BR> <BR>The character was used in Thomas Wades&#39; &#40;of
  Wade-Giles fame&#41; first Chinese romanization models, but was replaced simply
  by &#34;ts&#34; or &#34;tz&#34; in later &#40;and current&#41; Wade-Giles protocols.
  <BR> <BR>Dr. Pfister also said the character &#34;was found in traditional forms
  of German text ... and revived in Hitlerian years&#34;.  So, to me its origin was
  obvious--Fraktur.  &#40;Though, other than the sound it makes [ts], I&#39;m not
  really sure why Wade chose a Fraktur character over the simple English combination
  of &#39;ts&#39;.&#41; <BR> <BR>Another fun little detail... <BR> <BR>I&#39;ve been
  trying to find out what this thing is called and where it comes from for a few years
  now, the whole time it&#39;s been right under my nose--the German eszet is a ligature
  comprised of two Fraktur characters, first an &#39;s&#39; &#40;es&#41; and then
  a &#39;z&#39; &#40;zet&#41;.  Can&#39;t believe I didn&#39;t see it, but then, I&#39;m
  not familiar with Fraktur forms. <BR> <BR>Brings up some interesting questions though...   <BR>
  <BR>1&#41;  What&#39;s the word, is Fraktur/blackletter a redeemable object given
  its prior Nazi affiliations?  &#40;Doesn&#39;t Steven Heller talk about this in
  &#39;Texts on Type&#39;?&#41; <BR> <BR>2&#41;  Since zet&#39;s use as a romanization
  character, is it warranted its own Unicode codepoint assignment?  Does Fraktur already
  possess its own codepage &#40;or is it simply a non-specific variation of Latin-1&#41;?'

    <BR>BTW, when it comes to blackletter&#42;, take what Heller says as the opposite
    of what&#39;s needed. <BR> <BR>&#42; For starters... <BR> <BR>hhp'

  body: I think that most blackletter types are worth reviving, and can escape direct
    association with the Nazis. Rudolf Koch, for instance, was such a skillful artist
    that I think it would be criminal to forget about his work. But jackboot frakturs
    like Tannenberg &#40;and most other German blackletters from 1933
