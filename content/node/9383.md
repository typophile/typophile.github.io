  body: I was thinking that this looks an awful lot like some of the photolettering
    &#40;film type&#41; scripts that &#40;for example&#41; ended up in some of the
    Solotype Y- and Z-series scripts.  <BR> <BR>I have hunted through several books
    of scripts and my 3 Photo-Lettering catalogs, and this seems closest to some of
    the film type scripts. There are a couple with the low connection in the &#39;o&#39;,
    but I could find none that showed the same T. Part of the problem is that the
    Photo-Lettering samples don&#39;t show full alphabets. <BR> <BR>Certainly it could
    be hand-drawn, by an accomplished lettering artist, like Benguiat, Bartuska or
    Davison, to name some of the ones who did the Photo-Lettering scripts, but this
    is not the work of a &#39;weekend calligrapher&#39;, in my opinion. <BR> <BR>Jason
    Walcott &#40;Jukebox Type at Veer&#41; has digitized some of these script styles,
    and that might be a place to look for something similar in digital form.
