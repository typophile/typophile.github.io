  Minion would be perfect, but to my knowledge not even the expert set has Greek small
  caps: Is this true?\r\n\r\nAny other suggestions?\r\n\r\nThanks much."

  body: Minion Pro may not have them, but from Adobe, <a href=http://store4.adobe.com/type/browser/pdfs/1737.pdf>Garamond
    Premier Pro</a> has them, and <a href=http://store4.adobe.com/type/browser/pdfs/1739.pdf>Arno
    Pro</a> has regular and polytonic small caps to boot.

  body: Thanks. I'll give GFS Elpis a try. But I'm surprised Minion doesn't have Greek
    small caps. If any one knows different, please let me know.

  body: In the past, I have substituted Arno's small caps for Minion Greek, using
    the tools of cONtExt or XeLatEX. The results are unexpectedly good, although differences
    remain [e.g., in  "Y"]. It seems that Arno and Minion have some design similarities.
    Nevertheless, the absence of Minion Small Caps for Greek is a glaring omission,
    and I hope that Adobe does something about it.

  body: "A small file to make my point explicit. Greek words are typeset in Arno;
    the rest is in Minion. I have also replaced Minion Y's for Arno Y's, because otherwise
    the difference between greek and english would be annoying. Of course, the trained
    eye will not be fooled(notice the \"E\"'s, for example, and the difference between
    O's and Q's), but results are acceptable,  if one makes limited use of small caps...\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/testArno_resized_4603.jpg]"
