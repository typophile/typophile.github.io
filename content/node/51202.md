  or activate fonts. I have a load of fonts that really tax my system to leave installed,
  but can''t find anything that says it will work with Flexi...and let''s just face
  it: I don''t trust the 503 different "font manager by Joe Schmuck" listings that
  come up after an internet search. Had someone slip me a couple bad ones before...don''t
  ask.'

  body: "First, let me say FlexiSign is a great and wonderful program, and would be
    a great choice for all those folks missing Freehand, if it weren't for the fact
    that it's dongled and its pricing is so obnoxiously excessive as to preclude any
    user from acquiring it unless they have an actual business need for the cutter
    drivers. In spite of its fantastic design features it will forever remain a niche
    player.\r\n\r\nI can't imagine why the makers of Flexi wouldn't cooperate with
    the developers of font management software. Many sign shops use a broader range
    of fonts than most design studios.\r\n\r\nHave you tried Linotype FontExplorer
    X? I haven't checked lately on their progress on the windows version, but the
    one for Mac is the best thing going."

  body: "Well, I guess if font developers could figure out a way to put a dongle on
    their fonts, they probably would...and if I could do it on every logo I made,
    it would have saved me the frustration of seeing them on the backs of cars all
    over Texas...but, onward and upward! They have actually come out with non-dongled
    versions that are connected to the internet...but yeah, the pricing sucks! I have
    seen some boot-legged versions out there, but obviously you wouldn't want that
    in your possession for long, right?\r\n\r\nI'll check Linotype and see if they
    have a demo like Extensis...but that didn't go well at all! I even stumped their
    tech support \"guru\"."
