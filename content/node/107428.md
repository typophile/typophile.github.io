  body: "Sorry, don't know the answer and doubt actually there's one. I'm pretty convinced
    this is no font but a custom lettering by [[http://www.artbyforster.com|Anthony
    Forster]] himself.\r\nReminds me of [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/profonts/thalia|Thalia]]
    though. There are also [[http://www.myfonts.com/WhatTheFont/forum/?q=mikado|Mikado]]/OPTI
    [[http://www.myfonts.com/WhatTheFont/forum/?q=miyako|Miyako]]/Scriptorium [[http://www.myfonts.com/WhatTheFont/forum/?q=cipango|Cipango]]/Solotype
    [[http://www.myfonts.com/WhatTheFont/forum/?q=emperor|Emperor]] without being
    any of them of course... May be they inspired him to create this lettering...\r\nAnother
    one: [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/coffee-bin-fonts/letterhead|Letterhead]] by
