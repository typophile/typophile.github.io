  some time on it in my Font Design class at Art Center College of Design (in Pasadena,
  CA).\r\n\r\nI wasn't really referencing any specific grotesques when first designing
  it, but if I had to describe it in any way, i'd have to say it is a grotesque that
  takes some contemporary liberties, and has a little Franklin Gothic/ Monotype Grotesque/
  Akzidenz Grotesk feel to it (not that any of those typefaces are that similar, but
  id say my typeface has some similar characteristics).\r\n\r\nI'd love to hear what
  everyone has to think. Still much more to go, but i'm hoping that after this semester
  doing an independent study with a great teacher and type designer named Leah Hoffmitz
  I can have the full character set in 1 weight fleshed out.  Any feedback is welcome!"

  body: Looks pretty well polished from here. I feel that the stroke contrast in v,
    x, y is too pronounced. S, s are leaning to the right.

    the things that stand out immediately to someone else! Anymore feedback from anyone
    else is welcome too. '

    people have reported the benefit of putting a typeface away and out of sight for
    extended periods - when you pick it back up you find so much to fix! Typophile
    has nicely made that less relevant though...  :-)\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "Although it's not very novel, as Kevin says it's already in decent shape.
    I especially like the inclusion of a binocular \"g\", although it does seem a
    bit out of character - I'd try to make it lean more towards being constructed.\r\n\r\nThe
    vertical proportions are very good, the tittles are nicely prominent (no pun intended
    :-) but the caps are too tall and as a result too large.\r\n\r\nBTW, who's teaching
    that course? I ask partly because I teach a -very sporadic, in this economy- typeface
    design class in the ArtCenter evening program.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    with a slightly different 'a' to me.

    are some weights to adjust:\r\n\u2022 Dots on /i/ and /j/ aren't a bit too big?
    \r\n\u2022 the /Q/ queue is too thin\r\n\u2022 upper /G/ end leans to the right\r\n\u2022
    \ the /S/ and /s/ need to be reshaped (/S/ it a hard glyph!!)\r\n\u2022 I feel
    /f/ widens at the end of upper curve (as other diagonal cuts)"

  body: I don't agree with Synthview on S/s. I think it's the one glyph that makes
    this typeface stand out. The g ear needs more work, IMO.

  body: "wow, thanks so much everyone!\r\n\r\nVery happy to hear tweaks and changes
    rather than it just being not worth the time because it isn't very good.\r\n\r\nIt
    seems like the general consensus about changes pretty much are in the last 2 posts,
    from Eliason and Synthview. I'll start messing with these suggestions, as well
    as get the /W/X/Y/Z/ in there. \r\n\r\nI think some of the characters i've had
    the most trouble with are the /M/N/W/X/. I have just been having a super hard
    time getting the weight right on them, specifically the /W/ and /M/ because they
    seem to carry a lot of visual weight in those chunky parts, and every time i try
    to mess with 1 thing, it changes another a bunch! Oh well, i'll figure it out. "

    caps, but overall I must say that I love your design concept very much! And don't
    be afraid to combine different design traits--you are absolutely right when you
    say it has the feel of both Akzidenz Grotesk and Franklin Gothic. :)\r\n\r\n~HB"

  body: Not bad at all. My main concern with this typeface is that it's not very original.
    I think you should really try to add some more character to it or make some excentric
    italics. Just something to stand out of the croud. Keep going!

    weren't to make something overly expressive or \"unique\".\r\n\r\nIts actually
    a bit from each point you made hhp. I wanted to make a contemporary grotesk that
    took a lot of the functional aspects of go-to grotesks like Akzidenz, but with
    an overall softer feel. \r\n\r\nHere is example of my typeface on the left, Akzidenz
    on the right...\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/sonny-vs-akzidenz_4824.png]\r\n\r\nWho
    know, you guys are the pros, I'm still learning this stuff. I think overall my
    typeface just feels a little more friendly than most of the sterile grotesques."
