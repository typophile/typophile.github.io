  they use for my own letters. However, I have no clue which font they use. Note that
  I'm not after the logo font... I'm after the font they use for everything else besides
  the logo. Take a look at this image to see what I mean:\r\n\r\nhttps://my.vodafone.nl/Vodafone/Images/fact-exam-1.gif
  (sorry for the inferior quality but I couldn't find anything better...)\r\n\r\nMany
  thx!"
