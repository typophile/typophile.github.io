body: 'Hi everyone - unfortunately I don&#34;t have a visual, but here it goes: Letraset
  used to have this fairly bold non-joining monoline script in their dry transfer
  program, that looks round and simple and kind of non-descript in terms of a specific
  era. It&#39;s not Kaufman, and not quite as black as Varga. It was not designed
  for Letraset. I guess that&#39;s why it&#39;s not in their Fontek program. <BR>Light
  bulb blinking, anyone? <BR>Thanks!'

  body: Wait, you said it&#39;s NOT in the Fontek collection? That probably leaves
    out both of the preceding choices. <BR> <BR>The only two fonts I can think of
    that were Letraset scripts that are not in the Fontek collection &#40;I&#39;m
    sure Mark Simonson will know more&#41; are <a href="http://www.fonts.com/findfonts/detail.htm?pid=405832"
    target="_blank">Eclat</a> and <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/search?search%5Btext%5D=Einhorn"
    target="_blank">Einhorn</a>, and neither of those would be considered monoline
    or non-connecting. <BR> <BR>This may be very hard without seeing a sample.

  body: Hi Patricia, Hi Mike, <BR>thanks for your suggestions. So far they are not
    what I have in mind. &#40;And on the tip of my tongue, but maddeningly enough
    the name does not come up&#41;. <BR>Peter
