		<div class="commentbody">Yes, Sabon Next is great, and you won't have to see the Sabon italic h. But let me ask you this:

1. What's your budget?
2. What purpose will you use Sabon for? To make a shopping list, personal correspondence, or to set a book?
3. What software will you use? Will you use InDesign or something similar? If it's Word, don't bother - stick with what you have installed. (Someone here recently suggested Georgia, and I think it's quite usable at 10.5 pt).
4. Why Sabon? It's one of my favourite faces to read, but there are other good text fonts.


As for your question, the cuts of Sabon are the same.There may be differences in Kerning etc.</div>

Purpose – Nothing exciting. I don't really have any good reason for buying a font, I just thought it would be nice. Just so that when I produce "things that people will read" it'll look nicer. Possibility of self-publishing a book
Software – Well...at the moment, Word... I was considering getting hold of some (more) proper GPL typesetting stuff but again I don't know anything about what's good and what's not.
Why Sabon? Because that's what the Faber & Faber poetry collections are set in. I think it looks nice.

		<div class="commentbody">Lyx supports any font supported by LaTex, including opentype, truetype and postscript. Tools available allow easy use of Adobe standard fonts (e.g., from linotype, adobe, and monotype), but something like Quadraat might be trickier (because osf is built into the vanilla roman -- not the "extended".)

A dear, dear man by the name of Walter Schmidt already provided packages for using Aldus, Minion, Optima/Nova, Syntax, Sabon, Adobe and Stempel Garamond, Dolly, Frutiger and more. All the user needs to do is to license the font. http://home.vr-web.de/~was/fonts.html

Lyx is an excellent way to get into typography, because it allows a Word user to enjoy the benefits of a typesetting engine out of the box and without paying. With time, a user must learn some LaTex to obtain specific results, but simple documents -- letters, articles, books -- can be produced simply by instructing the program what to set (e.g., a letter), and choosing the font and size. Latex takes care of the rest.</div>

If you allow it to use "optical" kerning/spacing, it ignores built-in kerning and uses its own algorithm. This is a good option to have if the font you're using is spaced badly or has no kerning. Not so sure I like it as default behavior.

ID also has a preference hidden in the Type panel "Adjust text attributes when scaling", which I suppose is there to support Adobe's sizes, but which (I think) will add space between glyphs (globally) at small sizes, and reduce the letterspacing at large sizes. If you're used to a typeface performing a certain way at small sizes, you could get a surprise when you use it at small or large sizes. Mr. Phinney, care to elaborate? 

For a good all-purpose text family, try MvB Verdigris. Or, get Roman and Italic of Whitman from FontBureau, which is close to your budget. </div>

I wouldn't either, but it isn't the default (using the font's built in kerning is). So InDesign will only 'do things' to the default spacing/kerning if you ask it to.

No, that is not at all what it does. Basically the question is this: Do you want the text size to scale when you scale a frame? In other words, if you scale a frame that contains 12-point text to 75%, do you want it to then contain 9-point text? Or would you rather the text stayed at 12 point (possibly overflowing the frame)?

		<div class="commentbody">Thanks for clarifying that preference, Tom. I have played with ID and there is some behavior that happens to text, which reminds me of the h-z program or some similar algorithm. I've set a paragraph of text in a single-master design like Bembo or one of my own designs, at about 7 point, then copied the text, without changing any atributes except changing point size to about 96 point, and then zoomed the 2 samples to the same large size onscreen, and discovered that the smaller sample was set looser and horizontally scaled. Same with the large sample; tighter spacing, slightly narrow. What is that? I thought that turning off the "text attributes while scaling" preference stopped that behavior. It's a real bother when I'm testing and proofing fonts in development. </div>
