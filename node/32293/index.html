But I don&rsquo;t think it has a chance of standing up to an appeal from Paramount. Beyond the trademark problem is the problem of copyright. Even if they win the trademark case, I think their use of this as a logo will be destroyed as a blatant violation of copyright.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I&rsquo;ve seen the studios slap cease and desist orders for less blatant plagaries than this one. Since your client has no concern for ethics, appeal to his wallet: Help him realize that by using a stolen logo he is in jeopardy. He&rsquo;ll spend a lot of money producing stuff with this logo, and quite likely if Paramount sees it they&rsquo;re going to make him throw it all away. His silly trademark &ldquo;registration&rdquo; means nothing. You are not ethically out of line for trying to get him to do an original logo; quite the opposite. Would you be ethically out of line to anonymously send a copy of his ripoff to Paramount legal and let them convince him what to do? Probably. But it sure would be fun.</div>

<p>If the boss of the company won&rsquo;t admit there&rsquo;s any connection between his logo and that of the popular 80&rsquo;s movie with the same name as his/her comapny then he/she&rsquo;s either having fun with you, or is acting on the advice of their lawyers. Either way in this case I can&rsquo;t think that any &lsquo;blame&rsquo; lies with the designer, and as someone else mentioned it&rsquo;s unlikely a professional logo designer was invovled with it.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I searched the USPTO site and you are right. It looks like the Department of the Navy has registered that trademark. My guess would be that Paramount actually created the mark and it has been given to the Navy as part of the many dealings that go into producing and marketing a movie like that. Either way I&rsquo;m certain there is a legal deal established for licensing the rights to use that mark by Paramount. Just like there had to be a mountain of legal documents covering the use of all of the Navy jets, ships, personel and property used to film the movie.</p>
<p>So maybe you are right and we are making unfounded assumptions. Just like I assume that a corporation like Paramount has negotiated usage rights for that registered trademark, maybe the company printninja mentions has licensed the usage of that mark too.</p>

<p>I really don&rsquo;t care if this company gets sued.  I was just trying to give them a bit if friendly advice, because at one time they were looking to build a motorsports complex in our County.</p>
<p>As a professional designer, I feel tempted to &ldquo;drop the dime&rdquo; on them, because this stuff really ticks me off, but at the same time I have no need of enemies.</p>

<p>A few years ago, there was a robber who wore a &lsquo;TOP GUN&rsquo; hat when he did his heists. Wonder if Paramount could prosecute him for Trademark infringement? (Of course, I believe HE REALLY had a working gun). Don&rsquo;t know if he&rsquo;ll get that hat back after serving time.</p>
<p>Of course its an obvious infringement. Call Paramount and see how much they would pay you to tell them about someone infringing copyright. I wouldn&rsquo;t point it out to them without compensation.</p>

<p>stolen design</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I do not like the expression &ldquo;stolen design&rdquo;, as it is a legal misnomer.</p>
<p>The movie &ldquo;Top Gun&rdquo; came out in 1986, i.e. 21 years ago, but design patents are only granted a period of protection of 14 years in the United States. Therefore the &ldquo;Top Gun&rdquo; design, provided it had been registered at all in 1986, is public domain since 7 years.</p>
<p>See &ldquo;35 U.S.C. 173 Term of design patent&rdquo;: &ldquo;Patents for designs shall be granted for the term of fourteen years from the date of grant.&rdquo;</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Uli, this is an issue of trademark, which is renewable every ten years forever. And an issue of copyright, which is good until seventy years after the creator&rsquo;s death. Otherwise Nike, Starbucks, Coca-Cola and every other protected brand in the US would be out of business. Just for fun I dare you to open a store in the USA and call it Wal-Mart to prove me wrong. They&rsquo;ve been using that logo exclusively for decades now.</p>
<p>The Top Gun logo used above is a stolen trademark. And the owners of that trademark will object.</p>
