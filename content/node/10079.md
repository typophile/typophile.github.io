  to look for a job, and I want to set up as many interviews as possible. I don&#39;t
  really know too much about the city, but I feel like something is calling me there.
  I need to find some amazing design firms or magazines to interview at. Does anyone
  have any good suggestions, or things I should or shouldn&#39;t do when I go up there? '

    major libraries. <BR> <BR>For the design firms, maybe get the Vancouver phone
    book, also at a major library. You&#39;d be surprised at how many design firms
    are listed in the Yellow Pages. <BR> <BR>There&#39;s probably an annual that lists
    design firms, too. Don&#39;t know. <BR> <BR>Then rent all the good Canadian movies,
    so you can quote the vernacular, eh? <BR> <BR>bj '

  body: ' Specifically: <BR>I can&#39;t suggest too much, as I&#39;ve only visited
    Vancouver once, for a few days only, and it was a long time ago, before things
    like a career were on my mind. I thought it was a very pretty town. But I do know
    a couple of people who might be willing/able to help/guide you - I&#39;ll point
    them here and see what happens. <BR> <BR>In general: <BR>In December of &#39;92
    I moved from LA to Barcelona, and I lasted about 6 months. But even so it was
    maybe the single best thing I&#39;ve done in my life so far. I learned &#42;so&#42;
    much, including things I can feel I haven&#39;t realized yet. The main thing I&#39;d
    try to convey to you is how important it is to strike a balance between being
    a gracious guest in your new city versus being a brash young adventurer. Too much
    of either and you&#39;ll never become a true citizen of you adopted environment
    &#40;which however doesn&#39;t mean a perpetually nomadic lifestyle isn&#39;t
    an option&#41;. <BR> <BR>Two &#91;potentially intrusive&#93; questions: <BR>1.
    If I may ask &#40;you certainly don&#39;t have to answer&#41;, is there a girl
    involved? If so, don&#39;t dream so deeply as to lose your direction, eh? Unless
    it&#39;s the real thing. <BR>2. What&#39;s &#42;really&#42; calling you: foreign
    lands in general, Canada, or specifically Vancouver? Try to figure that out ASAP.
    And if it&#39;s the middle one, you might consider Montreal instead, especially
    if you&#39;re looking for something more different than Minneapolis &#40;since
    Montreal is as much French as it is the American&#41;. And it&#39;s one of the
    &#42;very&#42; few truly cool cities West of the Atlantic &#40;Toronto is supposed
    to be pretty cool too, and if you&#39;re not a Francophile maybe a better choice&#41;.
    But what am I saying? I&#39;m sure you have a good reason to shoot for Vancouver.
    Did you go there recently? If so &#40;or actually in any case&#41; you might want
    to dissect your &#91;clearly&#93; positive experience/impression with Vancouver/Canada
    to see what&#39;s really going on inside you. Heart and mind, working in harmony.
    <BR> <BR>Oh, one last thing: go for it. <BR> <BR>hhp '
