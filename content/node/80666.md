body: "WikiLeaks is having a t-shirt design competition over at [[http://99designs.com/t-shirt-design/contests/t-shirt-design-wanted-wikileaks-70772|99designs]].
  And could really like WikiLeaks to get an appropriate and effective t-shirt, [[http://99designs.com/t-shirt-design/contests/t-shirt-design-wanted-wikileaks-70772/designers/473745#entry-720|I
  have tried and it is fun]], but the competition holder seems to mostly appreciate
  geeky or in my opinion some very bad designs. I got so desperate I even tried to
  do Star Wars and Matrix series to please the hackers... But we really seem to have
  different tastes...\r\n\r\nHowever I still think WikiLeaks deserves the best, so
  I would like to find the middle ground between us.\r\n\r\nPlease help me and WikiLeaks,
  either tell me what I should do or what I have been doing wrong or contribute your
  own better designs to this competition! Any advice and opinion would be greatly
  appreciated!\r\n\r\nI think WikiLeaks needs a typographically strong t-shirt since
  it is about freedom of mostly verbal information and a very serious matter indeed.
  Graphics and gimmicks are very subjective and may or may not appeal to certain demographics,
  strong typography is more universal hence more appropriate imho. But I think any
  t-shirt needs to be very clean and simple, since there are limitations in the printing
  techniques and also because people will look at your face and not your shirt so
  the shirt needs to be very simple in order to even get noticed!\r\n\r\nThanks."

  body: You are requesting that we go on a fool's errand. As Thomas Aquinas so aptly
    noted, <em>de gustibus non est disputandum</em>; matters of taste cannot be argued,
    and trying to convince someone else that their tastes suck is not apt to get one
    very far...

  body: "Mandelum, since you are new here you may not know that many of us are opposed
    to design contests (also known as \"spec work\"), as we consider them to be bad
    for the design profession. You can read more about the reasons at www.no-spec.com/faq/.
    \ \r\n\r\nBut even if we put that issue aside, in this particular contest you
    are competing against over 700 other entries (so far), you're designing for a
    client you've never met or talked to, and who has provided only brief and vague
    instructions, and the client appears to have bad taste in design. Not a good situation
    for a designer."

  body: "No, and I totally agree, but since I am not a professional designer it is
    a very good way to do some practice. And since I care for WikiLeaks, I did over
    40 designs for this thing. But you do get dissapointed, and I do nnot think it
    makes economical sense to make the t-shirt only attractive to certain hackers.\r\n\r\nBut
    I really appreciate the kind welcome!"

  body: Of course it would also be nice to know what you think about the designs I
    made, but maybe it is not appropriate because this is not in the critique forum.
    And I guess I should not publish it there either.

    this is truly a great concern for the profession in general.

    is wrong but for an organization like WikiLeaks it a very understandable practice.

    great many of this kind of competitions' buyers have bad taste, which is evidenced
    by their using these competitions in the first place..."

    do you think so?\r\n\r\nI mean, Wikileaks received 1 million Euros in donations
    in 2010, but they can't afford to hire a designer to make them a proper T-shirt?
    Come on ..."
