  body: The poorly drawn M, N and R make me believe this is an  <BR>amateurish customization
    of <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/bitstream/futura/book/testdrive.html?s=MENTOR&amp;p=48"
    target="_blank"> Futura</a>. The angle on the legs  <BR>of the M and the small
    bowl on the R give it away... <BR>I wouldn&#39;t know where that E / inverted
    3 is from tho.
