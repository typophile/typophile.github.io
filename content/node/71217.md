    Pro</a>, an updated version of this font. But MyFonts refused it, as they weren\u2019t
    sure about the copyright. \r\n\r\nHere Mike F.s comment: \xBBBallpark Weiner was
    originally Alan Meeks' Letraset Kestrel back in the dry transfer font days. Interesting
    that URW would do a version of this typeface ...\xAB"
