body: "Hello Typephile members.\r\n\r\nI've released my typeface \"BOXDON\" which
  was especially designed for vertical layout. The typeface looks like boxes or playing
  blocks with minimal counter space to enhance 'stacked' feeling as much as possible.\r\n\r\nIn
  general, Japanese, Chinese and Mongolian, etc. is well known as languages which
  can have vertical layout system. However, even in usage of Latin alphabets, we can
  see some examples of vertical layout as building signage and spine of books. Then
  I thought that we have possibility to design special typeface for vertical layout
  to dig out expansion of type design world.\r\n\r\nI hope this typeface gives spicy
  inspiration to your graphic design..\r\n\r\nBOXDON at [[https://www.myfonts.com/fonts/tydtyp/boxdon-titling/|MyFonts]]."

    possible to enlarge it slightly to increase visibility for small sizes..."

    I think that some character should be revised as the S and 5. Keep going. '

    is an interesting concept it just needs to be more readable.

  body: "Hi sim and bojev\r\n\r\nThank you for your comments. I tried increasing counter
    space as a study, but as you can see, the result was not good - \u2019stacking\u2019
    feeling was lost and the whole shape became unstable.\r\nI\u2019m now thinking
    to make another variant which will have more squared shape. It will be more generic
    proportion and it might help to increase readability with keeping minimum counter
    space and \u2019stacked\u2019 feeling.\r\nAnd also thank you for giving comment
    for S and 5. I'll have study about it.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/typophile_comment01-01_5161.jpg]"

  body: "<blockquote>but as you can see, the result was not good - \u2019stacking\u2019
    feeling was lost and the whole shape became unstable.</blockquote>\r\nI'm not
    sure the shapes are necessarily unstable. The counter space 01 sample could work
    well if you increase the spacing accordingly. But ultimately it seems you're not
    increasing readability so much as merely creating optical variants. Counter space
    01 could be used at smaller sizes, and Counter space 02 even smaller than that.
    I don't feel like the readability changes drastically with the enlarged counter
    size. In fact, I think counter space 01 has the correct counter space for the
    size it's shown at, while I feel the current design works well at the larger sizes
    you showed in your original post, but doesn't work as well at the size you're
    showing now. The counters and spacing are just too tight.\r\n\r\nAs for the readability
    in general, I think it's not too bad at display size. Like Andr\xE9 (sim) implied,
    the typeface works quite well for \"slow life\". However, I just noticed you increased
    the tracking in that sample, which is why it's easier to read as well. I think
    the conclusion to draw here is that you current design works well at very large
    sizes, while for most display uses people probably require \"Enlarged counter
    space 01\" with greater spacing. By making optical variants you will greatly increase
    the application range of your typeface. Whether there's a need for it I don't
    know. You will have to decide for yourself.\r\n\r\nThe last thing I want to say
    is that I think for this typeface ligatures should be avoided. In the third picture
    I can read \"I'm\" and \"don't\" and I think the first sample says \"A 'n' D\",
    but the rest I simply can't read. The shapes confuse me to such large extent that
    I can't even try to encode them. For display typefaces it can be fine if it takes
    people longer to read it, but with the ligatures in this design I feel it becomes
    impossible to read. Do note you're at the outer edge of several restrictions on
    type in general; you're somewhere at the most extreme width, you're using the
    highest weight and the smallest possible counters, the tightest spacing and if
    you think of the negative space between letters and in counters as a hairline
    stroke, depending on the size your typeface is used at you actually went beyond
    the outer limit of how small hairline strokes should be. If you work with so many
    extremes in type, it will be very risky to introduce ligatures as well. Just to
    offer some perspective, I've had a client who didn't want me to use discretionary
    ligatures in Calibri because they didn't understand it. Obviously ligatures are
    getting more and more common again, but don't make it unnecessarily confusing.
    Ligatures should be included predominantly to improve the reading experience.
    When they actually greatly disrupt the reading experience, you might have to rethink
    what you're doing."

    my late reply.\r\nEspecially, your comment regarding ligatures is really appreciated.
    As you said, I had same experience that my clients (for other graphic design work)
    didn't understand what ligature is and they have recognised it as something error..\r\nI
    am aware that I need to think about balance between keeping experimental extraordinary
    looking and readability. It's always challenge to me."
