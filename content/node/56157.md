body: I need an Aldine italic with the small roman capitals and a Froben or Lignamine-esque
  roman with small caps (exactly one weight of each). What exact typefaces would you
  recommend as very authentic reproductions? I'm expecting digital type, but lead
  is okay too.

  body: "Your post is going to make me do research to find out exactly what a \"Froben
    or Lignamine-esque roman\" is, so that's interesting to me. I've never even heard
    of that description.\r\n\r\nAnd the fact that you say \"lead is okay too\" says
    something about what you're working on. Who is ok with spec'ing lead type? Not
    many, that's for sure."

  body: "I've been thinking that I should just post pictures in the type ID section
    and ask for something close.\r\n\r\nJohannes Philippus de Lignamine cut much of
    the type that Johann Froben used. Aldus Manutius was a contemporary. I'm looking
    for type that looks like the type that they each generally used.\r\n\r\nHere's
    a blurry image of a facsimile of a Lignamine edition.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/IMG_2488-600x400_3918.JPG]\r\n\r\nI
    have lots of pictures of Aldus and Froben editions, but I need to get permission
    to post them. Actually, I could make a fun site out of that alone... maybe I'll
    do that. It shouldn't be hard.\r\n\r\nBut decent pictures are already all over
    the internet.\r\n\r\nThe note about lead is largely intended to make you jealous
    of the letterpress shop in my basement. Actually, we have an offset press too."
