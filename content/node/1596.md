  body: 'Just wanted to add: <BR> <BR>In this sample, there is an extra space between
    the letters. The regular spacing is very close. I have a couple of other examples,
    but this one was the clearest, and it features a very distinct lower case g. <BR>
    <BR>Thanks in advance'

  body: This looks like a font-mutilation to me. The g is from Cheltenham with the
    tail reversed. The other letters seem to be from other  fonts, and the baslines
    have been messed with. Why anyone would do this seems like can only be answered
    by saying they had an urge to create an &#39;anti-font&#39;. In my opinion it
    is a monstrosity, but you didn&#39;t ask my opinion. I&#39;d say it&#39;s not
    a commercial font, and it should stay that way.

  body: If by &#34;commercial&#34; you mean for sale, I don&#39;t know. If you just
    mean a real font set, it is. I had it once, and then my computer crashed before
    I had backed up my newer font files. Yes the baselines are &#34;messed with&#34;,
    that&#39;s part of why I like it. <BR> <BR>Here&#39;s another image, I came across
    today. It can&#39;t be all that rare, I&#39;ve seen it twice in one day! <BR>

    <BR> <BR>Your opinion is noted and dismissed. As you said, I didn&#39;t ask for
    it.
