body: "Hi, there.\r\n\r\nThis might be a really stupid question, but I am anxious
  to find an answer, and this is the only reason I have subscribed to this list.  So
  please give me a break and put me out of my misery by shedding light on my ignorance.\r\n\r\nI
  am currently doing an on-line job that involves grading standardized writing tests
  for seventh graders.  Something peculiar I have noticed in their handwritten answers
  is the odd writing of an \"s\".  Instead of the top and the bottom of the \"s\"
  being at 12 and 6 o'clock, these \"s\"'s have been written so that the top and bottom
  are more at like 2 and 8 o'clock.  And they are always very fat and very curvy.\r\n\r\nI
  am culturally deprived, as I do not watch tv, nor do I follow much but music and
  politics.  I am also a tad older (48), and therefore am sure I am not running into
  the same things that a seventh grader would.\r\n\r\nSo, can someone help me out
  here?  I've tried googling \"s\" logo images, and I even thought maybe Justin Bieber
  wrote his name this way (I do, after all, get some popular culture exposure when
  I log on to my e-mail account, so I know he is all the rave with this crowd).  But
  no go.\r\n\r\nAny kind soul prepared to help me out with this one?  I thought it
  seemed like a good place to ask the question.  And I am a curious sort, at that."

    you expect, I can only guess. What you describe may be \"round writing\", a common
    youthful feminine hand that seems to transcend cultures and even scripts.\r\n\r\nDoes
    this resemble the sort of writing you're seeing?\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/CutiesinJapan-writing_5044.png]\r\nexcerpted

    realize that may not be particularly helpful in this case, the example being hiragana

  body: It seems normal for the stroke of an S to begin at 2 and end at 8 o'clock.
    To begin and end on the vertical would seem to make an S lean backward. Are you
    perhaps seeing something more like an integral symbol, or a sine wave?

    think they mean that the loops of s are in these clock positions rather than being
    two separate clock faces. So rather than being upright, they are slanted.\r\n\r\nIs
    S the only slanted letter and all the others are upright?\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Hi.  Thanks for all the responses.  But, nope, I am reading essays from kids
    throughout the state of Texas, and they are all doing the same thing.  I am thinking
    a rap artist.  What they are doing is similar to the figure in the box (6.2) that
    is furthest left, and one from the bottom.  But this S/s has no line through it,
    and it is written 180 degrees differently from the one shown.  Therefore, the
    beginning of the stroke made to make the S/s actually starts at like three or
    four o'clock, and the fat part (or the 'top') of the S/s is at like two o'clock.
    \ Enough kids have done this, and it is geographically distributed at least throughout
    the state of Texas, such that I am sure that it comes from somewhere within the
    mass media, again something to which I am not particularly well-exposed.\r\n\r\nAnd,
    yes, the S/s is the only slanted letter, so it kind of makes the essay difficult
    to read.  Kind of stands out as an idiosyncratic way of writing, but when you
    start to see enough of them, you realize they are emulating someone or something
    else.\r\n\r\nI am losing sleep because of this (just kidding), so anyone with
    the right answer gets a five-dollar Starbuck's card if s/he tells me where to
    send it (for realsies).  (Who's the OP???  Omnipresent Pen?)"

  body: Just about the only thing I can think of in hip-hop typography you could do
    with an S is change it to a z or a $, but that's not really a southern thing,
    more LA and NY respectively. The late DJ Screw would (I guess still) be an "S"
    with an obvious rationale to lean ("lean" being a particular dance associated
    with "sipping" codeine-laced cough syrup "drank", a practice I understand is now
    having a resurgence particularly in its native Houston area), but I've never heard
    of or seen it in any official context associated with him.

  body: I doubt the kids are imitating a celebrity; this is a typical characteristic
    of "teenage" (feminine) lettering, along with excessively round bowls, half-circle
    parentheses, curved descenders, really short ascenders, etc. Is there a significant
    difference along gender lines?

    agree with Joshua. Affectations in handwriting are more likely to be influenced
    by who you sit next to in class than the signature of a celebrity. I'd still like
    to see an example of what you are describing."

    don't know where it started, but it certainly is irritating, more so than hearts
