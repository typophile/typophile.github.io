body: "Hi everyone,\r\n\r\nI've always been fond of anything Japanese & I'm now studying
  the Hiragana & Katana characters. Mind you, I'm not actually studying Japanese,
  I'm merely looking at the forms & trying to figure out in what length they can be
  stylized.\r\nI've been googling myself silly to find Japanese display fonts, but
  I'm not really getting the results I'm looking for.\r\nThings I'm looking for include
  mostly digital (pixel based) display fonts used for cell phones and such (see attached
  image), but also any kind of Japanese letterlogo. I think by looking at pixel based
  Hiragana & Katana characters, I'll get a better insight into how much of it is \"expandable\"
  & what the real characteristics of each character are. Logo's would obviously also
  be helpful at this point.\r\nAny links would be much appreciated."

    Devanagari (Indian) font:\r\n\r\n\"You cannot chop up the curly bits.\"\r\n\r\nBTW,
    do check out the work of Joachim M\xFCller-Lanc\xE9.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "For Japanese display fonts, I'd suggest starting at Maniackers Design, http://mks.jp.org/
    , and after you have a good look at their selection of fonts, poke around in their
    lengthy and (unfortunately) quite aged links page.\r\n\r\nYou'll find a lot of
    Hiragana and Katakana display fonts around, many having matching Latin alphabets,
    but very few Kanji fonts, and you'll find that many of the Kana fonts are mapped
    to standard U.S. keyboard keyspaces rather than properly encoded for Japanese
    keying systems, but for the short passages of text one would use a display font
    for, that is usually sufficient."

  body: 'A thing I''ve noticed about Japanese web sites in general: while they may
    use Japanese text in their navigation, an awful lot of them use English in their
    HTML file names, so keep an eye on your status bar as you point at links and you
    might get a clue as to where they go.'

    Design was already in my favourites list, but I haven't actually checked their
    links out (DUH!). The HTML tip will be very useful, I'm always scared at clicking
    things I don't know where they lead to.\r\nThanks!"
