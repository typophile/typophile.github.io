  was a font called Infinity t-b but the e did not have the proper slant. If anyone
  could solve this mystery, I would greatly appreciate it.\r\n\r\n<img>http://www.itradenetwork.com/assets/itrade_network_logo50.png</img>"

  body: "<strong>Infinity t-b</strong> it's such a good match that it's improbable
    to be anything else.\r\nThe only explanation is that your \"e\" is actually an
    \"a\", rotated by 180 degrees."

  body: "Good find Fivos. Your _a_ rotated as the source of _e_ seems spot on.\r\nAnother
    font with an unknown origin.\r\nWell engineered.\r\nThe only info I found on provenance
    is the cryptic comment on one of the \"free\" download sites that this is: \"Version
    1.0 Extracted by ASV http://www.buraks.com/asv\"  Extracted from what? \r\nDoes
    anyone know anything about the font?\r\nDon"

  body: "Don, I can't find a legitimate source either, but \u0399 think <strong>Infinity</strong>
    was a creation of ThirstType, according to <strong>[[http://luc.devroye.org/fonts-23624.html|Luc
    Devroye]]</strong>.\r\nThere are also many references of <strong>Infinity</strong>
    family on Typophile:\r\nhttp://typophile.com/node/36209"

  body: "Thanks Fivos. \r\nLuc Devroye is an amazing encylopedic resource and usually
    credible in his attributions of authorship. I see nothing that demonstrates Infinity
    is not a ThirstType original, including the lively discussion on the Typophile
    thread.\r\nI suppose Infinity is now an orphan font :(\r\nDon"
