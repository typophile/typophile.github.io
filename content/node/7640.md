  body: thanks for all the advice. Turns out we have that font already. However, when
    I drag the PS font into suitcase it&#39;s corrupt but as a BMP file it&#39;s good
    to go? Puzzling in that I can convert this bmp font to outlines in Illustrator.  <BR>
    <BR>Anyone have this happen to them in OSX 10.3.5 and suitcase 11.02?

  body: I keep thinking Jason Walcott will do Bookman Swash as he cites it as <a href="http://jawarts.com/TypeInfo.htm"
    target="_blank"> one of his favorite</a> typefaces. Maybe you should suggest this
    to him, Grant. ;^D <BR>I&#39;ve also been tempted to digitize the swash characters
    myself, but i have this bad habit of not finishing things i start...
