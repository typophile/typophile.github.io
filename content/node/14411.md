body: "I'm not sure where this topic falls under the catergory of fonts. Does any
  one of a progrom (or method) of calculating the length of a string of text given
  the string of text, the font size, and the font style? Assume that Kerning is on,
  and tracking is off, but if it can be done with kerning off then that's no problem.
  \r\nI know that beggers can not be choosers, but if could be done in java or C++
  then that would be just ducky.\r\n Thanks in advace to anyone that can help!"

    in C++ under windows.. that''s about all i know though, except that this is a
    nastier problem that it would seem.  Most people cop out and just use the font
    height multiplied by the number of characters.. '
