  few weeks in New York but I don't think that is why my computer asks me to restart
  it 1 or 2 times a week. I get the transparent curtain that comes down the screen
  and then the pop up box that says \"You need to restart your computer\" \r\nI dump
  the trash often and have about 3.75 gb being used right now. The processor is 2hz
  and the intel core duo. The memory is 1gb 667 mhz ddr2.....\r\nDoes anyone know
  why the computer is making me restart it 1 or 2 times a week like this. Could it
  be dying :(\r\nRenee"

    have corrupt software, bad RAM, maybe even a bad CPU. You need to get everything
    important backed up ASAP and either get the computer serviced. The iMac isn\u2019t
    designed with service in mind, so personally I would just test the RAM, reinstall
    the OS, and then give up and buy a cheap PC to run Hackintosh on."

    problems (a loose RAM chip, for example) or by software problems. \r\n\r\nDoesn't
    necessarily mean a serious problem -- I've had them once or twice over the years
    and yet my Mac continued working fine once restarted. But if they start happening
    frequently you need to troubleshoot.\r\n\r\nGo to the Support section of Apple's
    site and do a search for \"kernel panic\". Here's one page there that talks about
    it:\r\n\r\nhttp://support.apple.com/kb/ht1392\r\n\"About 'You need to restart
    your computer' (kernel panic) messages\"\r\n"

    a week like this. Could it be dying :(</cite>\r\n\r\nThe heat shortens the lifetime
    of cheap electrolytic capacitors. Checking, whether some of them are burst, is
    the first thing, I do, when I have suddenly problems with a computer, on which
    I have not installed anything new. (If the capacitors are damaged, you can solder
    them out and exchange them with new [and better] ones. But that is not easy.)\r\n\r\nThe
    potential  transformers of the mainboard (cold start problems) and the power supply
    unit are likewise often reasons for sudden crashes."

  body: "Uh, you shouldn't leave your computer on without restarting that much.\r\n\r\nRebooting
    a computer clears the RAM (random access memory). When you open/close programs,
    small portions of the RAM (you don't really have very much to begin with) are
    taken up, thus slowing down your computer's ability to access information and
    execute tasks.\r\n\r\nThe fact that it's not saying why you need to restart doesn't
    help at all... if it were a loose RAM stick, I'd be surprised that your computer
    would boot in the first place.\r\n\r\nTry reinstalling your OS, maybe?"

  body: "Ok few things to do first,\r\n\r\nIs the computer still in warranty, if yes
    don't take it apart and defiantly don't solder or repair any internals, just call
    up apple care and book it in for a repair. IF you didn't buy Apple care you still
    can if your machine is less than 1 year old.\r\n\r\nThen try these\r\n1. Check
    out the apple forums for similar problems with your system, your probably nto
    the only one who has had this issue and there may well be  a fix on there.\r\n2.
    Download ONYX (www.titanium.free.fr) and run its automated services (this runs
    a whole host of Unix repair stuff as well as the apple maintenance routines)\r\n3.
    Download any updates\r\n4  Run ONYX again.\r\n5. Start up in safe mode and run
    fdisk see here for a how to - http://support.apple.com/kb/ts1417\r\n \r\nIf its
    still having a kernel Panic take out any third party ram and restart (Macs are
    picky when it comes to RAM)\r\n\r\nAs a final resort pop in your tiger disc and
    do a reinstall.\r\n\r\nIF all that fails take it to a Genuis bar and have them
    look at it, they'll look at it free and give you an estimate for a repair.\r\n\r\nLooking
    at your specs you really want to increase your ram to 2 or above this will give
    your whole system a boost and is cheap, don't buy the Ram from Apple (unless your
    feeling flush) buy from someone like Crucial.\r\n\r\nMartin\r\n"

  body: "Use Disk Utility: found in Apps/Utilities/Disk Utility. Select your volume,
    run the Repair permissions function, give it a while and it should clean up things
    fairly well if there are any problems. Always run this after an install of any
    kind just to clear and tidy things up. Bad/wrong permissions can do strange things
    to the system.\r\n\r\nAlso, very helpful is the fsck command. At start up, hold
    Apple-S (before the start up spinner appears) and you'll get into single-user
    mode where you can run Unix commands. Type fsck - f (it means file system check;
    be sure to put the space between the k and dash) and it'll run a check on the
    volume catalogue and bitmaps and repair most issues. It's all built-in functionality
    and I've never had a problem with it in the years I've used it.\r\n\r\nOne other
    self-maintenance thing OS X does (as I understand it) is in the wee hours of the
    morning it'll run a check on itself and repair any issues it can automatically.
    Just set  you computer to not sleep for the night and should work on its own.\r\n"
