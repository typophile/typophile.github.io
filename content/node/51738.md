  days ago and I\u2019m pretty sure I noticed something odd. Yesterday I went to the
  video rental place so I could double-check what I think I saw on the DVD, but apparently
  the DVDs are not out yet here in Belgium. So I was wondering if anybody could help
  me with some screengrabs. Here's what I'm looking for:\r\n\r\nIn <a href=\"http://www.sho.com/site/dexter/home.do\">Dexter</a>\u2019s
  Season 1 Episode 11 <a href=\"http://www.sho.com/site/dexter/previous_episodes.do?episodeid=127819\">\u201CTruth
  Be Told\u201D</a> Dexter is searching through newspaper archives, looking for clues
  as to what exactly happened to his mother and the conditions in which his stepfather
  found him. A couple of newspaper front pages are clearly seen in this scene, and
  I really would like to obtain screengrabs of those images (full frame with newspaper
  in it). Can anybody make these screengrabs and send them to me?\r\n\r\nThanks. :^)"

    and cannot seem to find any resource for vintage newspaper front pages, particularly
    from that period. Does anybody know if, how, and where I can find such an archive
    online?"
