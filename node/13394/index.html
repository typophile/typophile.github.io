<p>the story from Reuters and AP</p>
<p>Reuters :
A comic book of the cartoon Memin Pinguin is shown June 30, 2005. A set of Mexican postage stamps featuring the black comic book figure with stereotypically thick lips and a flat nose has sparked off a fresh row with the United States where anti-racism activists want them banned. Photo by Daniel Aguilar/Reuters</p>
<p>AP:</p>
<p>By MORGAN LEE, Associated Press Writer</p>
<p>MEXICO CITY - President Vicente Fox said Friday that U.S. activists who have condemned a new Mexican postage stamp as racist should read the beloved comic book on which it is based before they make judgments.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They don&rsquo;t have information, frankly,&rdquo; Fox said in an exclusive interview with The Associated Press.</p>
<p>U.S. black activists and the White House on Thursday criticized the stamp featuring Memin Pinguin, a sort of Jim Crow-era image of a black child that has been a cartoon character since the 1940s. The Rev. Jesse Jackson, the Rev. Al Sharpton and leaders of other black and Latino organizations have urged that the stamp be withdrawn.</p>
<p>The stamp is recognition of &ldquo;character very loved in Mexico and that has absolutely nothing discriminatory about it,&rdquo; said Fox, adding that he himself has been fond of the comic book since childhood.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And it appears to me that it has provoked a great national unity, because those who are making opinions from outside don&rsquo;t have information.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Actually it is up to those of mainly African descent, not those of mainly European or native American descent to call this. So it is not my call, but personally they look racist to me. But so are Jesse Jackson and Al Sharpton, whom nobody should listen to.</p>

		<div class="commentbody">Tina,
There have been people of African descent in Mexico for many years (since 1522 when a slave of Hernán Cortés arrived). Firstly as slave labour for the invaders, and after 1829, when Mexico abolished slavery, slaves escaping from the north. This is more explanatory <a href="http://www.mexconnect.com/mex_/feature/ethnic/bv/vaughnindex.html">http://www.mexconnect.com/mex_/feature/ethnic/bv/vaughnindex.html</a>.

<p>Black Mexicans,
Black Cental Americans,
Black Caribbeans<br>
Black Americans
Black Africans</p>
<p>Other Blacks</p>
<p>And then maybe other folks after that to say if they find it offensive.</p>
<p>Personally it looked pretty f***ing racist to me.</p>
<p>On the other hand, I really like the tintin comic books despite the fact that the books are clearly racist, and were illustrated by somebody who seems to have had fascist sympathies. I haven&rsquo;t looked into the history too closely in this case - so don&rsquo;t treat this as authoritative.</p>
<p>In any case, art, and especially art from anopther era needs to be evaluated in context to some extrent or we will end up with non-stop cultural revolution &amp; no more bloody art left. This character was probably designed quite a while ago &amp; I don&rsquo;t have beef with the art per se.</p>
<p>On the other hand it was almost certainly a bad decision to use the character on a stamp series. That is a specific use. I think we in the US of A would think twice before putting &lsquo;speedy golzales&rsquo; on a stamp for similar reasons. It doesn&rsquo;t matter if it <em>is</em> right or not it&rsquo;s a question of being sensitive.</p>
<p>One other factor to consider in all this is the fact that many countries release stamps as a way of earning currency. The stamps are sold to collectors for far more than they cost to print &amp; so it&rsquo;s just a way to make dollars. It could be that cartoon charcters were hot in that market this year/month , whatever so they siad, look, here&rsquo;s this cartoon&hellip; next thing you know you have an international incident.</p>

If the US would put out a racist stamp caricaturing those of Central American Indian descent&ndash;with comic sans!&ndash;then should the Mexicans have to shut up and leave it to Americans only to speak up?</p>
<p>I think it is up to the group who might be offended to decide on what is offensive. In this case it is black Africans and all of those around the world of black African descent, including in the US, the Caribbean, Brazil, in Mexico itself, etc. The Mexican government should listen and learn.</p>

<p>This controversy really turns me on and I don&rsquo;t want to make any harsh commentary but I have to speak my mind.</p>
<p>Certanily we are not as sensitive to racial discrimination (specially towards black people) as north americans are because we never had the same kind of racial problems and because there is very few black population in our country (I think I have seen 5 or 6 black cubans in my life while I was at the university and I liked them).</p>
<p>Memín Pinguín has been in the popular culture for many years since 1943 (my father grew up reading it) and the original idea of the author Yolanda Vargas Dulché and the artist Sixto Valencia behind it was to reflect the sweet and innocent character of the cuban boys Yolanda met while se was in a trip by Cuba.</p>
<p>Black people in méxico are percieved as sympathic and ocurrent and this partly explains the choice of a black kid as the protagonist of the comic.</p>
<p>The stories were a mix of comic happenings and a bit of drama that  touched the kid&rsquo;s heart with morality lessons. Memín was the leader of his friend&rsquo;s &ldquo;gang&rdquo; on which he always came with the fun ideas, the solution to problems and also got the punishments form his mom (Eufrosina) when behaving badly, so he was purposed as a role model and wasn&rsquo;t the continual center of racist jokes as some could grasp intuitively.</p>
<p>My father grew up reading Memín Pinguín and remembers it with affection, almost everyone whor read it as kids do.</p>
<p>I think that this sudden interest of some anfroamerican organizations towards the things that they perceive as mexican insensitivity to their condition is only to get public attention.</p>
<p>I also think that the North American government&rsquo;s claims on the topic (as well many other claims concerning our inner matters)are out of place and tend to hurt our sovereignity.</p>
<p>Speedy Gonzalez and all the WB mexican-on-the-cactus cartoons could be the excuse to start an anti latino discriminatio crusade but doing so would show our ignorance and miopy towards other people.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Hector, I am sure the cartoon was lovely, as you say, and a role 
model for generations.</p>
<p>I respect your fond memories of this, but times have changed, and 
the way such caricatures are viewed today by those as African descent 
is relevant to whether they should be made public again and 
celebrated. Those doing the caricaturing may be baffled by the 
offense taken by those caricatured, but I think the groups 
caricatured should be listened to.</p>
<p>No one questions the right of the Mexican government to make 
decisions about stamps. The question is whether it was wise. Do you 
really think that Mexico should ignore the international 
opinion of those of African descent, if they are offended? We live in 
an international media world now, and I would think that courtesy to 
all peoples is a good thing.</p>

<p>I also grew up in Mexico. And Memin is a ubiquitous character, we don&rsquo;t think about it. At least not in an enraged way. To be honest, I hadn&rsquo;t seen Memin in quite a few years and when I clicked on Parker&rsquo;s attached image, my first reaction was indeed &ldquo;whoah&rdquo;. It is unfortunately a dated image that today would make any political correctness detector device – if there were one – blow up into tiny little pieces because of overheating. I would agree that it could use a slight update.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, this is about a context. Mexican culture is VERY different, we are not as hung up on this issue. We experience racism in different – and many times more devastating – ways like Rich vs. Poor. In this regard, Memin – as many other comic book characters in Mexico who don&rsquo;t benefit from screenplays in Hollywood nor are their first issues sold for thousands of dollars to adoring collectors – are a &ldquo;product&rdquo; consumed by the lower and poorer class, which unfortunately makes up for the majority of the population. Memin, for better or worse, is the closest a kid that can&rsquo;t go to school will get to a moral lesson. This character is important to some people and it is important regardless of his race. If some US activist group finally pays attention to the social discrepancies in Mexico I find it very myopic to condemn a stamp of a charicature that means something to a lot of people.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>The stamps are sold to collectors for far more than they cost to print &amp; so it’s just a way to make dollars. It could be that cartoon charcters were hot in that market this year/month , whatever so they siad, look, here’s this cartoon</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Trust me, if you are involved with the government in Mexico there are easier – and more corrupt and violent – ways to make a lot of money. Selling stamps is not it.</p>
<p>In the end, I don&rsquo;t think anyone in Mexico thought anyone would have gotten up in arms about this, worse things have happened in the world and racism. It is a tad unfortunate that the image of Memin is so dated and strongly stereotypical. But that&rsquo;s what happens in a multicultural world. Live and learn. And don' condemn.</p>

<p>this is about a context</p>

<p>You are right, Armin. The question is, though, whether the 
international context matters. As I tried to make clear in my 
response to Hector, I think this stamp was completely innocent in 
intent; the Mexican government had no malicious intent. But you can 
be well meaning and still give offense.</p>
<p>When I said that the Mexican government should listen and learn, I 
meant that they too should be sensitive to the international context, 
and the inadvertant offense that might be given.</p>
<p>It seems to me that the appropriate response when inadvertant offense 
is given to a group&ndash;which it seems might be the case here&ndash;the 
appropriate response is &lsquo;sorry, I&rsquo;ll fix that&rsquo;, and not &ldquo;it&rsquo;s none of 
your business,&rdquo; which seems to be the message of President Fox.</p>
<p>If, say, England, which has little Mexican population, had a 
caricature that Mexicans found offensive, and they put it on a stamp, 
would it be appropriate for Tony Blair to say to Mexican critics, 
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s none of your business.&rdquo; I think not.</p>
<p>Armin, do you think that the Mexican government has no 
obligation to be sensitive and responsive to the potential offense 
given to groups outside its borders?</p>
<p>I agree &ldquo;Live and learn.&rdquo; It applies both to the US and to Mexico.</p>

<p>I can understand that some people can be offended by this image if they don&rsquo;t know the context for it, but it is curious that only north americans are complaining about it. Memín Pinguín was very popular in central america as well, where there is a bigger black population.</p>
<p>Maybe a good explanation and an aplogy from SEPOMEX (servicio postal mexicano) would be good, but having the north american government complaining about this to the mexican government is deffinitively out of place.</p>

I particularly remember the &ldquo;4&rdquo;. Yeah, that&rsquo;s all it was, horizontal format, a blue (I think) background with a bloody great white &ldquo;4&rdquo; in the middle, like a cross joined across the top left. There were some others from Austria that also had just big numbers, but they were sort of art deco broad-nibbed, outline. Sorry, can&rsquo;t put my finger on them right now.</div>

<p>An activist in the Black Mexican community mentioned by TimD above:</p>
<p>&ldquo;One would hope the Mexican government would be a little more careful 
and avoid continually opening wounds,&rdquo; said Sergio Penalosa, an 
activist in Mexico&rsquo;s small black community on the southern Pacific 
coast.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But we&rsquo;ve learned to expect anything from this government, just 
anything,&rdquo; Penalosa said.</p>
<p>More on who in the US has condemned the character:</p>
<p>&ldquo;The leaders of the NAACP, the Rainbow/PUSH Coalition, the National 
Council of La Raza and the National Urban League denounced the image 
in strong terms, calling it the worst kind of black stereotype. The 
curator of a Michigan museum that collects Jim Crow memorabilia said 
the Memin Pinguin caricature is a classic &lsquo;pickaninny&rsquo; &ndash; a black 
child, oafish and with apelike features.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Here is the leader of a US national Hispanic organization, who is of Mexican ancestry:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Janet Murguia, president of the National Council of La Raza, said it 
is &lsquo;impossible to overstate how appalled and offended I am, not only 
by the stamp but by the reaction of the Mexican postal service.&rsquo; She 
added: &lsquo;Hispanic Americans and all other Americans will and should be 
equally outraged.'&rdquo;</p>
<p>Additional information from an Australian Newspaper:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Black historians say that caricatures depicting black people as 
noble savages paved the way for their dehumanisation and, ultimately, 
mass lynchings. The caricatures&rsquo; place in history may help explain 
the strong reaction on the US side of the border.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Memin Pinguin&rsquo;s image permeates Mexico, where people of African 
descent are rarely seen and almost never heard. Mexican television is 
infamous for portraying indigenous Indians and black characters as 
criminals or maids, if at all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Christian, do you include Mr Penalosa and Ms Murguia, as well as the 
heads of the Urban League and the NAACP among those &ldquo;refusing to see 
anything from outside their own cultural context&rdquo;? I would urge you 
to consider the possibility that instead it is Mr. Fox who is so 
blinkered.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Wow. I hadn&rsquo;t been at the computer for quite some time and was surprised to find this thread. I am always amazed at what topics you seem to start, Tina. Not that you all have been waiting for my opinion, but as an African-American male, I think I should voice my opinion.</p>
<p>Based on the information provided by Hctor (and really nothing more). It seems that this character was created as a caricature. It also was created with very little understanding of a foreign culture. However the connotation, be it positive or negative (i.e. Black Cubans being sympathetic) it is still a stereotype. Admiration for the character aside, it was a character that was created out of ignorance (in the actual dictionary definition of the word).</p>
<p>The large lips, the flat nose, the big ears, it is indeed no different than the pickaninny dolls and porch monkey stereotypes that permeated the old South here in the United States. Cultural context aside, it is offensive. For any group to be characterized (in caricature no less) without a full understanding of cultural background is just plain offensive.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All of these self righteous Americans, claiming cultural sensitivity, and refusing to see anything from outside their own cultural context.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Christian, I didn&rsquo;t quote you to attack you, but your statement is actually a type of comment that I&rsquo;ve seen very often. To a degree I understand where you and others are coming from, but I have to say that something created out of cultural ignorance can be offensive to everyone, and not just the racial or ethnic group that is in question. Black Americans have every right to be upset about this because outside of the character, it symbolizes a type of &ldquo;thought process&rdquo; that helps create racism, bigotry and discrimination.</p>
<p>William, I understand your comments about Jesse Jackson and Al Sharpton. I do however, disagree with you about Al Sharpton. I consider him to be an advocate for social rights amongst all people. I&rsquo;m curious as to what you don&rsquo;t like about him or why he shouldn&rsquo;t be listened to. (Though of course no one should be listened to completely.)</p>
<p>Hrant, I&rsquo;m very surprised you&rsquo;ve been mostly silent in this discussion. If there&rsquo;s ever a thread that calls for your passion, its this one. Your restraint is commendable. I also wanted to add as a side note to you that even though we&rsquo;ve had our disagreements in the past this particular issue has ignited a similar fire in me.</p>
<p>I have to say sometimes (and issues like this bring things to a head for me) it gets taxing sometimes when I have to constantly ask myself should I be offended by this? This has partly to do with America&rsquo;s problem of never really dealing with their &ldquo;evil stepchild&rdquo; slavery. Its treated line &ldquo;this happened years and years ago and has no bearing on what is going on now.&rdquo; It is amazing to me that this issue can reopen those wounds&hellip;but its pretty easy to do that when they&rsquo;ve never really healed.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure everyone can relate on some level, but I&rsquo;ve got to say there&rsquo;s something really dehumanizing about seeing an offensive caricature of your ethnic group being sold in a toy store.</p>
<p>Armin&rsquo;s comments I think best reflect the core issues of the matter. During this time especially it is important to be culturally sensitive and it seems to me to be a gross oversight on the part of the Mexican government by not recognizing a major hot-button issue with a country which shares the same land mass.</p>

<p>Thanks for putting this so well. This is one of the main points that those defending the Mexican actions don&rsquo;t seem to &ldquo;get&rdquo;.</p>
<p>On Al Sharpton, I don&rsquo;t want to take this further afield, as this is not a type topic (though it is a graphic design one). But just let me say I have never been able to get past Sharpton&rsquo;s slandering other people in the Tawana Brawley case, being convicted for the slander in a court of law, and never apologizing for the slander. I must say, though, that I was impressed with him in the Presidential primaries, in spite of my prejudices against him.</p>

<p>Off-topic tangents are unavoidable and natural. But off-topic <strong>threads</strong> are not a good idea as far as I&rsquo;m concerned. Typophile used to have a special section for off-topic activity; to me that went beyond &ldquo;constructive venting&rdquo; and into &ldquo;insecure coping&rdquo; - a bad thing. Even my second post in this thread was out of weakness. This one though is a meta-post, so it&rsquo;s OK.  :-)</p>
<p>Also, I do not think people who make more off-topic posts than on-topic ones are good members.</p>

This is a post stamp intended for national use and it is going to be very rare if you find one of this posted in a letter ever. This issue has been magnified by people and organizations with political interests. Only until I see other countries with black population complain I will consider this as a true matter.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s also the need to understand the sensitivity of mexicans to the slightest north american remark on any of our inner issues due to the history of our relation with the USA which has by far never been satisfactory.</p>
<p>If we want to talk about true up to the date racism we must not forget the abuse suffered by latin american inmigrants to the USA where they are exploded in works no north american citizen would do by a society which hipocritically refuses to recognice their rights. This is no cartoon.</p>

Generally speaking its usually best to steer as clear as possible from two topics that seem to always ignite debate and anger&hellip;race/ethnicity and religion.</p>
<p>While I agree with some of the points that Armin, Hector and William brought up, this just goes to show that each of us come from completely different backgrounds and can truly never fully understand the politics and the reasoning for each of our individual viewpoints in this type of matter. Unfortunately, it has always been that way. If we really could walk in another person&rsquo;s shoes, we probably wouldn&rsquo;t ever have disagreements would we? While certainly thought provoking and however good the intentions may be sometimes these topics only make people angry.</p>

<p>however good the intentions may be sometimes these topics only make

</blockquote>
<p>My interest in taking up this topic was to try to see if there could 
be some productive discussion on a hot-button issue across cultural 
or interest-group divisions, which I do think is very healthy.</p>
<p>My observation is that how people react to conflicting views on &ldquo;hot 
button&rdquo; issues depends a lot on the standing of the other person. For 
example, Bill Cosby&rsquo;s campaign for greater parental responsibility 
among poor African-Americans has aroused a lot of controversy. But 
there is really not the anger and venom against Cosby that there 
would be against another person, because everyone knows that he grew 
poor, in a housing project, and has given millions to help the 
African-American community. Whether you agree or disagree with him, 
that he truly has the best interests of poor African Americans in his 
heart is beyond question.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t expect agreement, but hope that both sides, including myself, 
learn.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>understand the sensitivity of mexicans to the slightest north 
american remark on any of our inner issues</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I can understand the anger at any criticism coming from the United 
States, especially with our current bullying president in power.</p>
<p>However, I would hope that people could rise above &lsquo;my side&ndash;your 
side&rsquo; thinking, and just look at what is right. Neither Mexico nor 
the US should be above criticism.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve heard this excuse quite a bit, but don&rsquo;t get it. In the 40&rsquo;s, we had incredibly racist pop-culture iconography. But we sooner or later (usually later) realized they were racist, and stopped using it.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t see the overtly racist Bugs Bunny cartoons anymore, do you?</p>

the composition box. This makes the measure shorter, near to the ideal. 
As the font is different in the composition box, the result is too 
raggedy, but I think it is more readable, at least on my screen, than 
long posts with the excessive measure of the current design.</p>
<p>Sometimes I have neglected to hit the shift-return after some lines, so 
it messes up the concept. I will correct the last one, so you can see 
what I mean.</p>
