  thing or two about fonts. Anyways I am getting a tattoo of a logo from Sublime,
  and wanted a font that would match the art nicely (preferably some type of cursive
  ect.) I put a font in already just so I have an idea of what it would look like,
  thanks.\r\n\r\nhere's the logo:\r\n\r\nhttp://img16.imageshack.us/img16/6803/idea3nl.jpg\r\n\r\n\r\nThanks
  for your input!"
