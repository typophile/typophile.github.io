  reading a presentation by Christopher Slye about features, and while I see there
  is no single rule in the order in which OpenType features are placed (for an optimal
  behavior), I was wondering: is generally better to have the Stylistic Sets features
  (ss01, ss02 etc.) placed at the end of the Features, or at the beginning?\r\nI understand
  it all depends on how you want the other features to affect the already transformed
  glyphs, but if I have, let's say, a few ordinary features like [liga] or [smcp],
  do you usually place eventual ssXX sets after or before them?\r\n\r\nI am a born-bugger,
  I know\u2026"

  body: "It makes a difference if two different features affect the same glyphs. For
    example, let's say you have a normal and and alternate \"f\" and there is also
    a corresponding normal and alternate \"fi\" ligature. Let's say the alternate
    \"f\" is part of stylistic set 1. If <code>liga</code> comes before <code>ss01</code>,
    you would do it like this:\r\n\r\n<code>feature liga {\r\n\_\_sub f i by fi ;\r\n}
    liga;\r\n\r\nfeature ss01 {\r\n\_\_sub f by f.alt ;\r\n\_\_sub fi by fi.alt ;\r\n}
    ss01;</code>\r\n\r\nIf <code>ss01</code> comes first, and you don't change the
    code, <code>ss01</code> would never encounter an \"fi\" ligature to transform.
    You would need to do it like this to get the same effect:\r\n\r\n<code>feature
    ss01 {\r\n\_\_sub f by f.alt ;\r\n} ss01;\r\n\r\nfeature liga {\r\n\_\_sub f i
    by fi ;\r\n\_\_sub f.alt i by fi.alt ;\r\n} liga;</code>\r\n\r\nMake sense?\r\n"

  body: By the way, in the example above, I would put <code>liga</code> first because
    there are other ways to generate an "fi" ligature than via the OT feature. For
    instance, if someone types opt-5 on a Mac to get an "fi" ligature, the <code>ss01</code>
    code in the second example would have no effect on it.

  body: "Piccic, \r\n\r\none rule of thumb is that the features that are more semantic,
    orthographic or linguistic should be processed as early as possible, while the
    features that are more visual or typographic should be processed later. \r\n\r\nAnother
    rule of thumb is that within the visual features, the features that perform a
    more dramatic visual change to the whole of text should be processed earlier than
    those that only perform minor changes. \r\n\r\nFor example, when a feature such
    as \"locl\", \"sups\", \"sinf\", \"subs\" or \"frac\" is applied, the underlying
    text changes its meaning in some way (there is linguistic adaptation through localized
    forms, or some scientific meaning induced through superscript or subscript or
    fraction etc.). This means that such features should be processed as early as
    possible and if multiple features are applies, those features should take precedence
    \u2014 so their features definitions should be placed higher in FontLab Studio's
    OpenType panel. \r\n\r\nA feature such as \"smcp\" or \"c2sc\" is somewhat visual
    but also somewhat semantic \u2014 setting some text in small caps often conveys
    some change of meaning. And also, applying \"smcp\" or \"c2sc\" performs a more
    dramatic change to the text than, say, \"liga\". So when mixing \"smcp\" with
    \"liga\", you'd normally want \"smcp\" to take precedence \u2014 so the feature
    definitions should be placed higher in FontLab Studio's OpenType panel, but only
    AFTER the purely semantic features. For example, if the user applies both \"smcp\"
    and \"sups\" to a number, \"superscript\" will probably be more important to him
    than \"small caps\" because \"superscript\" is more semantic, i.e. it conveys
    a stronger change in meaning. \r\n\r\nThe same principle applies to ordering stylistic
    sets. If you have some stylistic sets that perform some linguistic or semantic
    actions (such as changing, say, \"Russian\" Cyrillic forms to \"Bulgarian\" forms),
    those should be placed tentatively higher. If you have some stylistic sets that
    completely exchange the uppercase letters with completely different shapes (e.g.
    engraved or ornamental), those should be tentatively high. And if you have some
    stylistic sets that only exchange your standard \"R\" and \"Q\" by variants with
    a long tail \u2014 which is a purely visual change, and fairly minor in its effect
    to the overall look of the text \u2014 those features should be further down the
    row. \r\n\r\nI hope this helps. \r\n\r\nBest,\r\nAdam\r\n"

  body: "Adam: thank you!\r\n\r\nI have no strong semantic features in my current
    typeface, since it's mostly for epigraphy and titling, so I'm just trying to avoid
    one Set \"disturbing\" the other.\r\nIn fact I've seen that [dlig] [salt] and
    [calt] are better processed after my alternate sets that are not semantic, but
    in the end I see it's all related to which non-semantic set you wish to have precedence
    over the others (and in general ligatures affecting them should necessarily come
    after).\r\n\r\nMark: thanks, precisely the more recurring problem I have, since
    the few ligatures I have are unusual and would not affect some combinations if
    placed first.\r\n\r\nNow I hope my \"simple\" question won't trigger another unending
    discussion over the Ultimate Logical Solution to Functional Problems\u2122. :ROFL:"
