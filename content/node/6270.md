  body: i think your secind option works better, but you should rework your &#34;N&#34;&#40;structuraly
    has nothing to do with the other characters&#41;, the&#34;V&#34;&#40;Ithink is
    falling backwards, you should move the base a little to the left&#41;, your &#34;R&#34;&#40;shoul
    have an open part as &#34;B&#34;&#41;, the &#34;U&#34;&#40;i think your diagonal
    terminal should be the other way&#41;, the &#34;S&#34;&#40;you should see how
    it looks with the terminal gest pointing to the inside of the character&#41;,
    and the &#34;G&#34;&#40;move the hook upwards&#41; <BR> <BR>I am waiting for the
    &#34;UC&#34; and &#34;lc&#34;, cause i think that this is a unicase version, don&#39;t
    it. <BR> <BR>CG ||

  body: I don&#39;t see any problem with the N. It shares the same uncial/semiuncial
    heritage of other letters. Besides, where&#39;s written that an R should morphologically
    follow the logic of the B or vice-versa? Maybe the intention of John Spencer was
    to give each letter a different treatment. That&#39;s why I think these postings
    are often tricky for a beginner. They may be confusing more than helping...

  body: I didn&#39;t mean to be polemic, Cristian, sorry! <BR>Being relatively new
    I didn&#39;t realized fully that being in the Sans Serif cathegory, Pseudo sachsen
    was meant to be a face for extensive textsetting. <BR>Anyway in odd designs the
    B and the R could be different &#40;I&#39;m odd, you&#39;ll see&#41;. <BR>I&#39;m
    sorry you spent time doing the image which is useful indeed. I just thought of
    Pseudo Sachsen as a generic face...

  body: i intentionally posted this face without any introduction or basis, because
    i was  <BR>curious as to what kinds of classifications pseudo sachsen would receive
    from  <BR>my peers.  <BR> <BR>perhaps i did initially post sachsen in the wrong
    category, yet my intentions with  <BR>the lower case are to maintain a legible,
    modern sans-face while the caps possess  <BR>a bit of the display majuscule as
    some of the historical specimens from which i  <BR>collected reference &#40;namely
    the 5th to 9th century adoption of roman characters  <BR>and written literacy
    into anglo-saxon, irish, visigothic and other northern european  <BR>cultures&#41;

  body: 'I&#39;m very interested and look forward to seeing where you take the lowercase.
    I enjoy both versions of what has been shown as I can see a serif/semi-serf and
    a sans-serif version, as well as perhaps a wider version. Once set at a text size,
    it might work better a bit wider. &#40;?&#41; I can understand why some would
    consider this a display face, it goes against what has become expected and what
    we are used to using for text. It would be interesting to try this for text in
    small amounts for flavor. But I want you to convince us &#40;me&#41; that it can
    be used for longer texts. Perhaps once you are finished, or closer, you could
    set a page and create a pdf. '

  body: John <BR> <BR>i really like your imrovements <BR> <BR>only a few comments
    <BR> <BR>1.-in your lc &#34;r&#34; i think that the &#34;nose&#34; should be shorter,
    is to ackward the spacing with these one. <BR>2.-i do like the second stem to
    be shorter but you should be carefull or even forget it in some characters like
    the &#34;n&#34; or &#34;m&#34;, besides this is completely the opposite in the
    UC &#34;M&#34; and &#34;N&#34; <BR>3.- Why not givin&#39; some curvy stuff in
    the descender of the &#34;x&#34;, that would tie it up with the other letterforms.
    <BR>4.- in your UC &#34;S&#34; i think that it should be so rough in the right
    bottom, you should go up a little bit with that corner, the same as lc &#34;b&#34;
    <BR>5.- in the lc &#34;o&#34; those corners should be more clear, like in your
    lc &#34;c&#34; <BR>6.- lc &#34;z&#34; for me is too wide <BR>7.- you should shorten
    a little bit the acender of lc &#34;t&#34;, it&#39;s too disturbing <BR> <BR>anyway,
    you are progressing with big steps, good work :-&#41; <BR> <BR>CG

    debate late as I am, <BR>I was going to disagree with Cristian <BR>&#40;specific
    to this face only&#41; on the grounds <BR>that the forms seemed to reflect enough
    <BR>of each other to my eyes, but I quite like <BR>the solution you presented
    afterward. <BR> <BR>I like the direction you&#39;ve established in the lc, <BR>but
    I&#39;d love to see more uncial forms, <BR>especially in lc &#34;a&#34;, &#34;b&#34;,
    &#34;d&#34; and &#34;r&#34;, and <BR>perhaps &#34;e&#34;. Check the forms in Omnia
