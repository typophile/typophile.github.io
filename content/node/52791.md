body: "I'm designing a 250-or-so page Hebrew book. It's my first, and as I'm not used
  to reading long stretches of Hebrew text, I'm wondering which font to use for the
  main body copy.\r\n\r\nThe obvious suggestions were FrankRuel, David, Narkis, and
  Hadassah. Of those four, I most prefer the Narkis for the bodycopy and FrankRuel
  for the headings. Any additional suggestions to consider? \r\n\r\nJust as good,
  are there particular editions of these standards which excel in anyone's opinion?
  I've seen Hagilda's FrankReul and it looks quite beautiful. I'm also taken by FontBit's
  Hadassah Chadash, as well as Oded Ezer's Meoded Serif (both only as display faces).
  Thanks!\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Untitled-4_6111.gif]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Untitled-5_6385.gif]"

  body: Another notable FrankRuel I saw recently was Feldheim's new Hebrew-only edition
    of the Mishna Berura. Don't know which cut they're using, but it's more squared
    and tightly kerned than I'm used to seeing. Sorry I don't have a sample to post
    but SO legible and beautiful!

  body: "Who is your intended audience of readers?\r\n\r\nDo you need nikkud alignment?\r\n\r\nContact
    www.fontworld.com. They have a superior version of FrankRuhl. Also, Scott Keofsky's
    Milon has many advantages over FontBit's New Hadasa. \r\n\r\nWho is doing the
    typesetting?\r\n\r\nOnly modern texts, like those used in Israel, use Narkiss
    for the body text. If your audience is the Mishna Brura crowd, Narkiss is not
    a good choice."

  body: "Thanks gohebrew,\r\n\r\nThe book is essentially \"What to expect when you're
    expecting\" for the religious Israeli crowd. It's <strong>not</strong> being marketed
    as sifrei kodesh. And it will be marketed almost exclusively in Israel. Almost
    zero nikkud, and I'm setting the type from a Word doc provided by the client.\r\n\r\nWhere
    could I see Scott Keofsky\u2019s Milon? Thanks\r\n\r\n/\\/\\"

    is narror than narkiss. narkiss is more attractive to me. so david could either
    cost less to make, or larger point sizes could be. (bigger type and larger pictures
    sell better).\r\n\r\nis the book a lot of pages?\r\n\r\n"
