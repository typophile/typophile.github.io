body: "I found this neat article today, whose premise I don't know if I can stand
  behind. I'm not sure what I think about the scientific underlying of letterforms
  throughout humanity's history. I tend to think that writing systems look similar
  because of their historical evolution,* not because of some tendancies of how humans
  see the world around them. But then again, I always liked history more than science
  when I was at school ;-)\r\n\r\nAnyway, this line stuck me in particular, because
  it seems to support one of Hrant's theses (if I understand him correctly\u2026):\r\n<em>The
  shapes of letters are not dictated by the ease of writing them, economy of pen strokes
  and so on, but their underlying familiarity and the ease of recognising them.</em>\r\n\r\n<a
  href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/connected/main.jhtml;jsessionid=KRWZXIBGZXHJBQFIQMGCFGGAVCBQUIV0?xml=/connected/2006/04/18/ecalpha18.xml&sSheet=/connected/2006/04/18/ixconnrite.html\">The
  article may be found here.</a>\r\n\r\n\r\n* Weren't a lot of writing systems simply
  \"invented\"? And moreover, weren't they invented by people who were already familiar
  with at least one other writing system?\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd this paragarph is just too
  rich not to cite:\r\n<em>There is a cosmic dimension to this study. Dr Changizi
  speculates that if there is intelligent alien life in the universe, then so long
  as these creatures live, like us, among \"macroscopic opaque objects strewn about\",
  they will evolve writing symbols like our own. Alphabets on a planet orbiting another
  sun will, if materials, light and shade are similar to our own world, have features
  in common with those used on Earth: if ET writes home, we may think there is something
  familiar about his handwriting.</em>"

  body: "mmmm...\r\nThe structure of the letters is based on natural shapes, because
    letters are analogic representations of old ideograms (notice that the cientifics
    are asian, used to write and read pictures, not words).\r\nBut the shape of the
    letters is \"dictated by the ease of writting them\", no doubt of that."

  body: "Hrant, when alphabets were invented they were writting forms, alas their
    shape (not structure) is dictated by the writting tools. When letters are drawn,
    I should say their contours, one can do anything that the tool allows, and I see
    2 posibilities: to respect the tradition and \"copy\" the shapes with little variations
    or vreate something new.\r\nNow, with computers, almost every shape has been drawn,
    so there's a lot of work to do in the structure of letters (I think you wrote
    something similar for the magazine Tipogr\xE1fica, talking about legibility).\r\nChanges
    of structure create new typefaces (Times), changes of shape create new fonts (Times
    regular or bold)."
