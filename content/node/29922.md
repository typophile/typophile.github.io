  Swedish advertising forum www.bold.se about what font is used in the logotype for
  the Swedish theater \xBBSk\xE5nska Teatern\xAB? My first association was a early
  version of Caslon but thats not quite right. Any suggestions?\r\n\r\n"

    K & R are different) soled but they only name it \"French Old Style\" so it's
    pretty general. \r\nI also think a superbold Cheltenham modified?\r\n\r\nAnyone?"

  body: "Hmm checked Berlingksa's type specimen since it's close. They havce something
    that would match Rookledge's \"French Old Style\" but calll it Fet italiansk Atiqua
    (Fat Italian Antiqua).\r\nIt fits well, but the K & R are not the same either."

    even closer.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
