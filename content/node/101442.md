  body: "@defiantone: When posting links, it\u2019s best to avoid linking phrases
    like \u201Chere\u201D or \u201Cclick here\u201D or \u201Cthis article\u201D as:\r\n\r\n1.
    They are uninformative cues as to the destination, and often require the reader
    to read before and after the ambiguous word in order to determine where it will
    take them\r\n\r\n2. Most importantly, imagine a visually impaired reader using
    a text-to-speach converter reciting the active hyperlinks on the page. The same
    word \u201Chere\u201D and \u201Chere\u201D could easily mean different things,
    again reinforcing the importance of informative language in hyperlinks."
