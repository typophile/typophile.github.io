  can appear condensed in condensed typefaces or if it has to keep rounded.\r\nThanks

    not A-ring, so no, it has to be round. Like anything else, different designs might
    have other alternatives. \r\n\r\n I hope that your question wasn't because you
    wanted to create a condensed font by just squeezing an existing font. You can't
    mechanically squeeze a font to get a condensed version. That destroys more than
    the shapes of glyphs, but their proportions and stroke widths, as well.\r\n"

    because I\u2019d like to have the ring attached to A as it\u2019s a display font,

    as it\u2019s not in a language that actually use |\xC5|.\r\nThe \u201Cring\u201D
    it\u2019s not a diacritic, it developed from |o| and, for example, can/should
    retain the same stroke modulation of the rest of letters. And there are plenty
    of examples of oval looking \u201Drings\u201D, although they\u2019re most often
    horizontally wide in order to save vertical space."

    and Denmark, I would say yes.\r\n\r\nAs for your typeface, one solution would
    be to rotate the shape 90\xB0. You will lose the connection on |\xC5|, but will
    solve any problem with serifs in |\u016E|. Otherwise, you can shorten the inside
    serifs in |\u016E|. In any case, I think your \xE6sthetic choice should be dictated
    by |\xC5|, since it seems to be the most used of the two."

  body: "I disagree with some here. I think the 'ring' is conceptually connected with
    the A in the A-ring combo. That can be seen by the numerous examples where the
    ring is shown as attached to the A, not a separate floating piece. I once looked
    through about 100 of the most commonly used fonts out there (a very unscientific
    guess on my part) and found that around <em>half</em> had the ring connected.\r\n\r\nSo
    I see no reason to consider the ring as something that has to be perfectly circular,
    any more than the dot on the i has to be perfectly circular. Yes, both are commonly
    so, but more importantly should visually harmonize with the rest of the face.
    That goes whether the ring is connected or not.\r\n\r\nAnd as for accents/diacritics
    in general, I think they should always follow the visual language established
    in the 'normal' letters, with similar contrast, terminals, weighting and alignment."

  body: 'I think a disconnected ring is the way to go here. As it stands the connected
    ring makes the A look taller compared to other A''s, and the ring looks too low.
    You also need to check the optical alignments (both vertically and horizontally)
    of other accents. For example, in the light, the breve looks much lower than the
    circumflex, and in both weights the accents often look shifted to the left. One
    last thing: the ogonek like that opens up too much white space in the bottom counter
    of A. I''d make it bigger and more serif like on the inside. We''d need to see
    a lowercase descender to gauge how big it needs to be. It should descend the same
    amount, ie usually bigger than a cedilla.'

  body: "It's great to see some clever, create strategies! The question of how creative
    to get probably depends on the intended usage. Display type benefits from greater
    creative freedom, which can be a distraction in text type.\r\n\r\nThere's a cultural
    dimension to this, too. For example, German foundries in the mid-20th C got very
    creative with their umlauts:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Umlauts_5317.png]\r\n\r\nZapf
    even did this with Melior and Optima:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Zapf_6456.png]\r\n\r\nNote
    that the E-umlaut in Melior shows that there was not technical requirement that
    the umlauts be lower. It was just a style choice.\r\n\r\nThose were fine for the
    German market, but when the types were issues outside of Germany they universally
    adopted the more common (and boring) style.\r\n\r\nMenhart and some other Czech
    designers (even current ones) have tried a very uniquely Czech design for the
    U-ring:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Menhart_4730.png]\r\n\r\nSome
    say this is old-fashioned, but I think it's a classic example of cultural character
    in design, and works great for a limited audience and purpose."
