  with the mark I created a few weeks ago. This is what I am somewhat happy with so
  far for the business card, and I have not yet started the rest of the stationery.
  I'd like critique on everything\u2014composition, type treatments, etc. Please note
  that I've not yet done anything with kerning; I'm going to wait to do that when
  I have everything else nailed down. I look forward to the feedback!\r\n\r\nThanks!!"

    initial reaction to you designs are I love the simplicity, they convey a sense
    of substance and  sophistication. \r\n\r\nI would set your first and second name
    in the same style, capitalise both and not have them running together. I think
    this would suit the conservative and refined style of your design better. \r\n\r\nI
    like option 3 (front & back) the most. I think the mark in this option anchors
    the text rather than competing with it.\r\n\r\nOverall I think your stationary
    is looking beautiful.\r\n\r\nZennie"

  body: "Hi Cassie,\r\n\r\nI like #2 the most \u2014\_the composition is interesting,
    yet not too crazy for the classy style you're going for. What doesn't work for
    me is your name treatment; I don't think lowercasing it and closing it fits well
    with the back of the card, where everything is simply typed out. I'd say either
    more variation on the back, or (better yet) the front is also typed out quite
    simply. It's your name; it should be very clear and clean. Ethos is an important
    aspect \u2014 you can have your name treatment project authority and simplicity.
    \r\n\r\nI'm not sold on the typeface either. Is it Mrs. Eaves? It's nice, but
    it's a bit overused. Not bad, I just wonder if it can be better. Something slightly
    updated, but still serif. And then I wonder if, in addition to the old-style figures,
    you can have another special treatment here & there. I would love the text to
    feel really crafted, fitting your beautiful traditional esthetic. \r\n\r\nAlso
    your mark at first seems a bit arbitrary, like any old pretty thing \u2014 but
    then I see C's in it! It's a great discovery. Did you intend that? It's beautiful.
    Anyway, my 2 bits. "

  body: "Hi cassie.\r\n\r\nI'd go with #1 on the front but I'd change the back to
    match the front. What I'd like you to consider for the back to match the front
    is to introduce some font play in it. You use three different fonts on the front,
    but only one on the back.\r\n\r\nAnd why #1? Because the symbol is still a symbol
    and not a background pattern/item. #2 emphasizes it the most. Maybe a bit too
    much because it becomes overwhelming and makes people recognise the symbol but
    can't relate it to any trademark.\r\n\r\nAnd I guess that word \"graphic\" isn't
    necessary. Design is enough.\r\n\"cassie forrington design\" is a trademark name.
    When \"graphic\" word is used, then \"cassie forrington\" become a trademark name
    with an explanation of \"graphic design\".\r\n\r\nOf course it depends what you
    want to achieve here."

    why not go ahead and use a few of these options on one plate. Might be fun.\r\n\r\nPersonally,

    has a nice layout, but I'm not a fan of the smashed-together-type.\r\n\r\nWith

    serif numerals is a bit off. "

    printer to create multiple pieces (letterhead, cards, envelopes, etc.) Might save
    you a few dollars and give you a bit more versatility.\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Thanks for all the input! Looks like I have some decisions to make...\r\n\r\n<em>I
    think this would suit the conservative and refined style of your design better.</em>\r\n\r\nI'm
    not sure that I want to be 100% conservative. I'd like to find a way to mix a
    contemporary type treatment with a more simple, traditional composition, but I
    guess I haven't gotten there yet. I definitely haven't spent enough time on the
    type on the back (in any version)...\r\n\r\n<em>Is it Mrs. Eaves?</em>\r\n\r\nYes,
    it is. I chose it because my mark is constructed out of MrsEaves italic c's and
    f's, so I feel it best complements the mark. I'm also using Johnston for the sans.
    I used the treatment that I did on my name mostly because of the italic f, to
    reference the mark. Not necessary?\r\n\r\n<em>I would love the text to feel really
    crafted...</em>\r\n\r\n:) Yes! That is exactly what I need, and want. As soon
    as I know which one I'm going with, that will definitely be my next step.\r\n\r\n<em>Are
    these going to to be handset or lettepressed via a plate?</em>\r\n\r\nProbably
    with a plate. That's an interesting idea... making a sort of series with a few
    different layouts. I've seen business  card series before, but I'm worried about
    having too many different compositions, just for the sake of consistency. But
    it's definitely something to think about. Thanks for the idea about setting each
    as a separate block, I didn't even realize that was an option!\r\n\r\n<em>2 is
    interesting, but with the added tactility of the letterpress process, I think
    you might have a bit too much going on with the stroke.</em>\r\n\r\nI was hoping
    the stroke would help accentuate the tactility. It's offset slightly from the
    mark on purpose, and I know it may be even more slightly off with the registration
    of the letterpress, which I like. I feel the layers add a nice depth, although
    I am worried that it detracts from the mark too much to be worth it.\r\n\r\nSo
    it seems like the general suggestion is to set my name more traditionally? Or
    should I keep trying to make the contemporary+traditional thing work?\r\n\r\nLooking
    forward to more feedback!\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    of the front (all very similar) and 6 of the back. I've done some really quick
    kerning, but haven't gone through it with a fine-tooth comb yet, but I would still
    love feedback on everything at this point. \r\n\r\n<em>I\u2019d love to see some
    use of pattern with the mark</em>\r\n\r\nWonderful suggestion, I had completely
    forgotten about that! I tried several patterns, but nothing was really working...
    There is one pattern in the new PDF but I'm not really happy with it. What do
    you think about a pattern running behind the text? The other thing I haven't tried
    is incorporating lines or dots or anything into the pattern, which might help.
    Right now it's just a symmetrical shape, and that doesn't make very interesting
    patterns in one color.\r\n\r\nThanks again! I'm getting closer...\r\n\r\nedit:

  body: 'I like working with local printers, so you can see the proofs without too
    much of a hassle. Look up some letterpresses in your area, and then work with
    them to find papers you like. You don''t need anything dazzling. I''d say fairly
    smooth, but not glossy, and bright white. It would be nice if you can pay for
    160 lb cover stock. That way it''s a really hefty card {ethos! : ) } and you won''t
    get impressions from the opposite side of the card. It''s pretty expensive, though,
    so if you choose against it, your printer will be able to recommend something
    else for you. Prices also depend on what he may have in stock, so it''s best to
    work that out with him (sorry, and/or her). : )'
