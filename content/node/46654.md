  especially interested in finding out what the \"WORK\" font is at the top, and also
  the body copy type. The dates along the left that are set in white/light grey all
  caps seem very close to Arial but are slightly different, better.\r\n\r\nAnyway,
  I really like the look of these and would appreciate any help identifying them.
  Or even if someone could direct me to some pixel fonts that are different and more
  attractive than the average Arial, Helvetica, Verdana pixel sans serif fonts seen
  on the web. What font foundry out there makes beautiful, high-quality pixel fonts
  that could be incorporated into flash-based websites?\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\n"

    as a side project of Gridplane, I am preeetty sure these types are either custom
    made, or available at <a href=\"http://miniml.com\" target=\"_blank\">Miniml</a>.

  body: Wow I should have looked at the site a little more closely, I totally missed
    that on the side projects page. Looks like a lot of well-designed fonts, thanks
    for pointing that out Dav.
