  body: Wow at that size it's awfully hard to tell. It looks Caslon-ish but I wouldn't
    swear to that.

  body: The nice folks at FontShop are giving away <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/features/free.cfm">Baskerville
    Old Face</a>, which is a little more refined and idiosyncratic.

  body: "But it's based on what's called \"Fry's Baskerville\", a clone done\r\nby
    a contemporary of JB, and quite different. Some people prefer\r\nit for display
    setting, but to me that's mostly because revivers of\r\nthe authentic Baskerville
    have generally ignored optical scaling.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: Oh definitely, Baskerville Old Face/Fry's Baskerville obviously is a display
    cut, not to be used in text sizes.
