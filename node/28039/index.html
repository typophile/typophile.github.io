  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>Hi, Some of you know me from the Type ID Board, and may know that I recently (finally) stuck my typographic toes from the familiar comfort of Mac OS 9.2 into the unfamiliar, but inviting waters of OS X. Of course, my Mac being old, my OS X software was what I got on CD and is version 10.1.5. I found that if I wanted the newer versions I would have to have DVD capability, so here I am in the OS X that no one uses, and reading the discussions of Font Explorer X (which requires 10.3.9, or something similarly distant from my version).</p>
<p>OK, that&rsquo;s not an option. So what can I do to have some sort of Font Managment? I had been spoiled in OS 9.2 with Adobe&rsquo;s ATM Deluxe. Now I can&rsquo;t use anything unless I move it to the OS X Fonts folder. So far it&rsquo;s been easier to restart back in OS 9, make my graphics and then drop them off where I can pick them up agin in OS X.</p>
<p>That can&rsquo;t be the easy way to do things.  What can you suggest besides telling me to get a new computer?</p>
<p>Thanks for helping the &lsquo;lame&rsquo; to walk in a new environment.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Another option is to use an iBook/MacBook , connect it to your mac with a firewire cable and use it in &ldquo;target mode&rdquo; to install a current OSX.</p>
<p>That of course depends on your older mac having firewire. With all that said, you may need to check the specs to see if your computer even meets the bare specs to adequately run 10.4.  Although you don&rsquo;t want to hear it, I&rsquo;d suggest even a MacMini for $600 (+$100 for 1Gb ram) that is going to give you a current OS, a DVD drive and, most likely, a faster machine overall. Plus you&rsquo;ll get to use FontExplorer.</p>

I couldn&rsquo;t find them selling anything but the newest OS X versions, at least at first glance, although I admit my focus was on getting used to this version, which can run on my G3. Not sure which newer ones need a G4 as the minimum.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m surprised you can even post on Typophile with your set up. I loved my G3 and OS 9.2.2 but you might want to get beyond that. It won&rsquo;t improve your typography a whit but it sure makes life easier on the net.</p>
<p>OS 10.1 wasn&rsquo;t so good. You probably want to get to at least 10.3.9. Other World Computing (great place) has some kind of emulator software (X PostFacto) that supposedly allows you to run Panther and even Tiger on a G3. But you might also want to/need to soup up that G3 with a faster processor, maybe a video card, updated hard drive controller card, UBS/Firewire card, etc., to get it to even basement level performance.</p>

<p>Suitcase seems to have moved on past my version of the OS, so it doesn&rsquo;t seem to be an option.</p>
<p>Gerald, I know getting the new stuff would make life easier, but the benefits don&rsquo;t justify the cost, and the hassle of transitioning to a new machine.</p>
<p>My biggest gripe with my old system was not being able to post images here after the Typophile &lsquo;upgrade&rsquo; (I can&rsquo;t get past feeling the need for quotations &ndash; sorry, all you folks who were so proud of the changes, and worked so hard on them), but wwith my &lsquo;mini-upgrade&rsquo; I can do it now, once again.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m happy enough with the way things are working, it&rsquo;s just the font management that seems to be a lot more tedious than it was with ATM deluxe.  With all the things I do with the large font collection I have accumulated, that&rsquo;s not a trivial matter, but it sounds like I just need to get used to it, until I am ready to bite the new Mac bullet.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s like being stuck on dial-up when the rest of the world is on broadband. I think a year ago you could almost manage. I bet a year from now the experience will be nearly impossible.</p>
<p>Sticking with an older setup is a tough argument to make if your livelihood depends on the tools you use.  A G3 Powermac is at least eight year old technology, and OSX 10.1 is five year old technology. The limitations and cost involved trying to bring an older system to run current applications has got to have diminishing returns. There&rsquo;s a reason G3 Powermacs sell for less than $50 on eBay. The newer and upcoming software is only going to be more and more incompatible with that older machine.  Whether it&rsquo;s font management tools, browsers and RSS - there&rsquo;s worthwhile stuff that just won&rsquo;t be available.</p>
<p>Transitioning to a new machine is getting pretty simple with Apple&rsquo;s install Migration Assistant.  Getting all your files organized and apps reloaded depends on how organized you are.</p>
<p>Best of luck!</p>

<p>Gary, I appreciate your rationale, if I <em>were</em> in that situation you&rsquo;d be completely right (and I would probably have already done it long ago), but I&rsquo;ve been retired from my career for over 7 years. This is what I do for fun these days, and my simple, low-tech web site and my label printing business sideline does just fine with my antique setup, as long as it is still running. When it goes belly-up, I get a new(er) machine, and load my fonts on it and off I go.</p>
<p>Tiffany, I might just take you up on that offer. Can you e-mail me the details?  Thanks.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Mike, one thing to consider is upgrading to an older Mac. If you look at Apple&rsquo;s system requirements page for Tiger (10.4) you&rsquo;ll see it runs on some pretty old iron, some models going back over five years. A few of them don&rsquo;t have DVD drives, but most do. The biggest issue with older Macs running newer software is hard drive space and memory, but both can be upgraded relatively cheaply.</p>
<p>Lots of resources on the <a href="http://lowendmac.com/">Low End Mac</a> site for running older Mac hardware (including which old Macs are the best value).</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>This thread has made me nostalgic for some of the early, &ldquo;bad old days&rdquo; of Mac OS X. I actually tried out 10.0 and waited patiently for the (free) upgrade to 10.1 which Apple distributed on CD. Each version from 10.0 through at least 10.3 exhibited real performance improvements. It was one of the only times I can think of when OS updates actually made things <em>faster</em>. With 10.4, features like Spotlight and Dashboard probably eat up some resources to overshadow any optimizations. For an older Mac, I think installing 10.3 off CD would be reasonable. If I remember correctly, it takes two CDs. The current state of the art software(FontLab 5, CS 2) will be compatible, and the next generation (like Adobe CS 3) will probably have hardware requirements such that it would never run on your old system anyway.</p>
<p>For a lot of professionals, the trick is to wait long enough for any major issues to be worked out with new versions, but stay current enough that you don&rsquo;t get left behind as support drops off for older products.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Mark, I really appreciated your input on this, because that&rsquo;s a route I can more easily rationalize in my situation. Thanks for that link. I have already added a bigger hard drive (I&rsquo;m using maybe 20% of the 80GB drive after 6 years) and maxxed my RAM (to 768MB), so that they have usually been more than adequate for what I do. I am patient enough for a slower processor to do something in 10 seconds instead of 2. What was killing me was the browsers I could use couldn&rsquo;t keep up with the new web page features.</p>
<p>Carl, Your comments were also quite useful. The OS X upgrade rush has stunned me with it&rsquo;s quick rate of change (read &lsquo;instability&rsquo;, in my mind), and I kept waiting for some sort of equilibrium to be reached at a &lsquo;plateau system&rsquo;, like OS 9 was. Your last sentence is the key to where I found myself (left behind), so I have made the step into the OS X system, and it sounds like 10.3, if it runs on my machine would be the way to upgrade.</p>
<p>I knew I could get some help if I asked here. Thanks to all of you for responding.</p>
