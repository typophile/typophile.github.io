    mean a formal review? If so, can you get me a copy?  :-&#41; <BR> <BR>But reading
    the [original] Castillian part of your post I think you just want to know what&#39;s
    in it, right? I&#39;d just ask Ruben - he&#39;s the nicest guy. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>'

    take away from our true nature &#40;like email does in a way for example! :-&#41;
    it&#39;s a good thing. There&#39;s nothing natural about handwriting - it&#39;s
    one of the most artificial things we do. <BR> <BR>Handwriting will become an elevated
    hobby/craft &#40;kind of like type design!&#41;, something you do because you
    love it, something that the general population might admire, but not really understand
    any more. Kind of like making your own pottery at home - it used to be the norm,
    now it&#39;s an aberration. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>'

  body: '&#62; so why we need to learn..... to talk? <BR> <BR>To communicate, as broadly
    and sincerely as possible. Handwriting is very bad at the former, and it&#39;s
    only good at the latter when the message is highly personal: like if you ever
    have to write a letter to propose marriage to somebody, make sure you handwrite
    it &#40;unless it&#39;s totally illegible&#41;. But for example when you&#39;re
    designing a font that can be used for virtually anything, chirography generally
    confuses things. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>'
