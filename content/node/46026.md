body: "Hi all,\r\n\r\nI have a client who insists that I find the font used in the
  Goldman Sachs logo. It seems at first like a modern typeface but lacks most of the
  serifs ... so maybe a transitional?...\r\n\r\nAnyhow, I have so far drawn a blank.
  I realize that parts of the GS logo have probably been hand-tweaked, but if such
  a font exists that matches \"oldman\" and \"achs\", I will be in much better shape
  than I am right now.\r\n\r\nI really appreciate your all of your expertise and assistance.\r\n\r\nCheers!\r\n-
  George\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/GS_4752.jpeg]"

  body: "That's definitely a start. But none of these quite have the rounded presence
    of the serifs on the \"a\" and \"c\". That's where I'm stuck. I suppose I'll be
    pulling parts from some of the fonts mentioned and something else for the serifs.\r\n\r\nThanks
    for the info!"
