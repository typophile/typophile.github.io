    8-2004 <BR>&#34; <BR>Hello,  <BR> <BR>                           I&#39;m a new
    design student who is very interested in typography &#40;in fact, this is my <BR>                           first
    post here&#41;. I&#39;m designing a logo for an acupuncture clinic and the problem
    <BR>                           I&#39;m running into is this: I&#39;m creating
    the logo in a size somewhere in the <BR>                           neighborhood
    of 8000 X 5000 at 300dpi. From there I&#39;m resizing downward <BR>                           depending
    on the use. The problem I&#39;m running into is setting the type. What <BR>                           methods
    are there to set type that large? Are there typefaces available that <BR>                           large?
    Or is the typical method to design your own type for that size of a project? <BR>                           In
    my smaller rough drafts I was using Trajan as the typeface. I&#39;ve attached
    a <BR>                           web-ready rough draft. Thanks in advance! <BR>{logo.gif}

    <BR>&#34; <BR>Why do you set type in Photoshop?  <BR>                                     Kern
    the dot after the P, now it is closer to S.  <BR>                                     AS

    <BR>&#34; <BR>You should use a vector program / software for creating logos &#40;
    or when working with type <BR>                   &#41;, something like Freehand,
    Illustrator or Corel Draw.. That way, your logo being a vector <BR>                   file,
    is scaleable and there would be no problem with rezising it..  <BR> <BR>                   <a

    <BR>Registered: 8-2004 <BR>&#34; <BR>                           Thanks for the
    suggestions. Like I said earlier, I&#39;m a very beginning design <BR>                           student!
    I just bought Illustrator, so I&#39;ll use that.  <BR> <BR>                           Also,
    thank you David for the links. It&#39;s hard to find solid information that breaks
    <BR>                           things down like that on the web, sometimes.  <BR>
    <BR>                           Back to the drawing &#40;Illustrator using vectors&#41;
    board! <BR>&#34; <BR>'

    are stored on the Typophile server, indexed by a number. I should be able to track
    it down by posting a dummy image&#42; and working backwards from what I get -
    gimme a minute. <BR> <BR>&#42; <BR>Like this one: <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/4100/42778.jpg"

  body: Daniel G, what is the plant symbol mean? I&#39;m not getting the relationship
    to the name of the business. Also it looks like you have an effect on your type
    at least the CHEN&#39;S, do your self a favor and loose the effect in large sizes.
    CHEN&#39;S is very spaced out it looks like a mistake. Match the kerning of the
    rest of the words.

  body: Thanks for the feedback, although I should&#39;ve mentioned that this was
    a quick rough draft to try and get an idea for what I want to do. I haven&#39;t
    delved into the finishing design in Illustrator yet. When I do, I&#39;ll definitely
    keep those comments in mind. Thanks!
