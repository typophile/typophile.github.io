body: "I have been corresponding with Hoefler Frere about customizing the standard
  character set for Whitney. Whitney has a default character set and an alternate
  set. We want to have some of the alternate characters to replace their default characters
  in the main set, and are told that choosing an alternate character can only be done
  manually, one at a time, through the glyphs palatte in InDesign/Illustrator. \r\n
  \r\nWe are buying Whitney for use in a very large organization after months of study
  as to the right typeface for the job, and have found Whitney has just the right
  characteristics, so long as the alternate 'R' is used in place of the standard 'R',
  and the alternate 'K' is used in place of the standard 'K', as well as a few other
  replacements. We want some of the alternate characters to be used entirely in place
  of the default characters at all times. In other words, we want this font to be
  carefully controlled without the option of somebody choosing, for example, which
  'R' they want to use.. a situation where people are going into glyph sets to choose
  an R here, an A there would be far too labourious and confusing; we want them to
  have only one option.  We simply want to have a few of the characters switched around
  from the alternate to the default character set, so we can deliver the various copies
  we buy to our designers in that uneditable configuration.\r\n\r\nIs this possible
  for a designer to do on their own? Must I use Fontographer?\r\n\r\nNeal\r\n"

    to know the opinion of others. I was interested in 'possible' in the technical
    sense.

  body: "<em>Is this possible for a designer to do on their own?</em>\r\n\r\nIt is,
    but if you're not familiar with the process, it may be more hassle than it's worth*.
    I think the most painless way is to have the foundry modify the fonts for your.
    And besides, I'm pretty sure the H&FJ licence doesn't allow it to do it on your
    own.\r\n\r\n* switching the outlines of the R around isn't the only thing you'd
    have to do. The horizontal metrics of the glyph must be adjusted too, then kerning,
    hinting, then the OpenType feature code, which can't just be read from the font,
    modified and written back 1:1, then there are more variants of the R like accented
    variants and small caps, which all should get the same treatment ..."

    but I don't know their fee.

  body: You can use any font editor for that, but if OpenType is involved then better
    use a font that can edit OpenType tables. As for legally, myself I'll do it if
    I need and can, any EULA saying I can't is draconian and will just ignore, but
    that is just a theoretical stance since I'd not be touching such font in the first
    place.

  body: "Aside from legalities (which it seems don\u2019t hold water with some quarters),
    if this is for \u201Cvery large organization after months of study as to the right
    typeface for the job,\u201D then there are practical benefits to having the foundry
    do it, despite any customization fee.\r\n\r\nFor one thing, they can work directly
    from original sources, which will avoid some of the potential problems that Jens
    alludes to. If you\u2019re talking about the entire Whitney family, then this
    potential is compounded. If the foundry does the work, you will be assured of
    commercial-quality robustness and consistency. \r\n\r\nAnd you will also remain
    entitled to customer/technical support for the modified fonts. Which, for a large
    a widespread organization, is no small matter.\r\n\r\nYour requests and your rationale
    are both quite reasonable. Hopefully someone from H&FJ can respond to you in a
    timely fashion with a practical solution."

    for us; they have just requested info about the timeline, specifics, and how many
    computers will be using it & etc. '
