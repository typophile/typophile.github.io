body: They are getting me a scan, but I thought I&#39;d start the question now. Does
  anyone know if there have been typefaces created that mimick the Constitution of
  the USA? Both the blackletter and the script? &#40;Don&#39;t ask why it is a bizarre
  client request.&#41;

  body: Funny, I was under the mistaken impression that it was handwritten. I have
    not been able to find anything similar. It does look familiar.

  body: You could try English 157 for the script. But it won&#39;t perfectly mimic
    something handwritten. <BR>Or one of the Shelley fonts. Or Berthold Script. <BR>

  body: There have been several re-creations of the writing on American historic documents,
    although perhaps not this identical handscript. Part 10 &#40;Antique Handwriting&#41;
    of the <a href="http://bowfinprintworks.com/Script10Pg1.html" target="_blank">Script
    Font ID Guide</a> shows fonts called Article 10,  Old Glory, Jeffersonian and
    American Scribe to name some of the more deliberate recreations. If you look through
    the type samples you may see others that fit the feel as well. Not all the fonts
    are truly modeled on antique writing, but I included them there if I thought they
    might look like they were &#40;so Zapfino is there too, for example&#41;.  <BR>
    <BR>These do at least look more like something handwritten, rather than engraved.
    <BR> <BR>However, I do not know of anything that looks like the &#39;blackletter&#39;
    &#40;We the People&#41; style.

  body: 'Letraset used to have a sheet of rub-down graphics from the Declaration of
    Independence. They issued it in 1976 for the Bicentennial. I don&#39;t know when
    it was discontinued, but it&#39;s not in the most recent catalog I have &#40;1998&#41;.  <BR>
    <BR>It included characters similar to the text in the Constitution, but only enough
    to compose a few words. Here&#39;s what it looked like from an older catalog:

  body: Oh ... eeeeek!! ... That wouldn&#39;t be a very fun way to do it. :^/   <BR>
    <BR>Thanks to all suggestions. They ended up using the old cover. Not the best
    choice, but oh well. C&#39;est La Vie!
