I just think their practices since then don't make great business sense. Maybe they're protecting their font names, but they're dragging the Berthold name through the mud with their hyper-litigiousness. <BR> <BR>I haven't heard of Windows verses Lindows, but I did laugh about the Microsoft verses Mike Rowe (who holds <a href="http://www.mikerowesoft.com/" target="_blank">MikeRoweSoft.com</a>). Does MS really think that MikeRowe and his site are going to cause confusion? (Or is it that over time a bunch of Mike Rowe's could take MS' name into the public domain.)

		<div class="commentbody">&gt;it is essential to protecting intellectual property <BR> <BR>Leaving aside Hrant's raving, my impression that many on these boards do not understand the legal situation with intellectual property rights, which are important to the type business.  <BR> <BR>As Nigel says, my understanding is that the owner of a trademark is required to sue or risk losing ownership of the trademark. This is perhaps a bad law, but that is the box that it puts the trademark owner in. If all that Berthold is doing is protecting its trademarks, I do not think they can be faulted for that, and people should not boycott them for that reason.  <BR> <BR>In the US, my understanding is that only the name can be trademarked, and that in general design itself is not protected. The laws do seem to need changing, but Berthold should not be blamed for the box that the law puts them in.  <BR> <BR>I am not a lawyer, and I do not know about Berthold's business practices generally, but there needs to be some understanding of the problem any digital foundry faces. <BR> <BR>Perhaps other owners of digital foundries can comment.       <BR></div>

		<div class="commentbody">Nigel, you wrote that Linotype no longer delivers the Akzidenz Grotesk. That's right. But nowadays Linotype delivers 4 weights and 4 italics of the Basic Commercial typeface. If you look at <a href="http://www.linotype.com" target="_blank"><a href="http://www.linotype.com">www.linotype.com</a></a> you will be able to read the following sentence: &quot;Basic Commercial font is based on the design for Akzidenz Grotesk, which appeared with Berthold in 1900, designed by type setters whose names have not been recorded, but whose skill cannot be overlooked. This typeface has been popular among groups and movements so diverse as the Bauhaus, Dadaism, and the masters of Swiss typography. It served as an influence for a variety of newer, more anonymous grotesque fonts as well as Helvetica. Basic Commerical font is a clear and objective font whose forms exhibit almost nothing unusual, but which remains both lively and legible&quot;.  <BR>Basic Commercial is available in OpenType with the better hinting, But also in PS and TT for non-InDesign users.<!--attachment: 14056BasicCommBold-32980.pdf*mime_pdf.gif*application/pdf*16.0*BasicCommercialBold*14056BasicCommBold%2epdf --><center><table border=1><tr><td><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/icons/mime_pdf.gif" align=left alt="application/pdf">BasicCommercialBold<br><a href="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/4100/14056BasicCommBold-32980.pdf" target="_blank"><b>14056BasicCommBold.pdf</b></a> (16.0 k)</td></tr></table></center><!--/attachment--></div>

Controlling their product. <BR> <BR>And the only reason that I entered this thread is that I keep seeing so much misinformation about trademarks that no wonder the independent type designer gets into trouble if he doesn't know right from wrong.

		<div class="commentbody">Nigel <BR> <BR>On the Luc site, a lot of Berthold's actions seem to be silly and pointless.  <BR> <BR>The issue with Baremo and FF Sari, though, seems to me quite reasonable. Sari is in fact a 'new Baremo'and 'New Barem' would be exploiting the reputation of the old which is still evidently owned by Berthold - so it would cut into their mark.  <BR> <BR>In fairness, you should answer the question about whether you are associated with Berthold.  <BR> <BR>I agree that people are way too ready to attack anyone trying to protect their IP rights. But Berthold does look silly in some of the warning letters. Do you think I wrong about this?</div>

		<div class="commentbody">It would be handy if one could rely on stuff on Luc's site, but I don't feel I can trust even the stuff that seems plausible. In some areas that I do know plenty about, like OpenType, his writing has a lot of material that is simply false, as well as a lot that is misleading or devoid of content (but always full of inflammatory rhetoric). We're talking a major axe to grind. <BR> <BR>Of course, if you believe that all corporations are evil, and that there are conspiracies everywhere, then you'll probably find Luc's world view quite complementary to your own. <BR> <BR>T</div>

		<div class="commentbody">&gt;I think Agfa Monotype, Berthold, and Linotype are doing things the right way. Controlling their product&lt; <BR> <BR>I've kept quiet for a long time, but now i have to clear up a few facts. <BR> <BR>1. Berthold Types in chicago is not the legal successor to H. Berthold AG <BR> <BR>2. Berthold Types has registered most of H. Berthold's trademarks and thus has every right to defend them <BR> <BR>3. Berthold Types has no contracts with any of the original designers whose fonts are being sold today; thus effectively stealing from designers like Hans Reichel, who designed Barmeno but doesn't receive license payments for his design. Nor was he allowed to re-issue his own face as New Barmeno. So he had to call it Sari and redraw it extensively, just to be able to publish a typeface he licensed to H. Berthold AG, not Berthold Types (see 1).  <BR> <BR>4. Berthold Types sues everybody who only gets into the vicinity of one of their trademarks or even imagined marks, for example &quot;super&quot; or even &quot;grotesk&quot;. In these cases they just lost, finally. It is absurd to want to claim a trademark for a generic term like Grotesk, just because it occurs in one of their trademarks (Akzidenz Grotesk). Defending this not only cost countless hours but also tens of thousands of dollars in attorneys' fees. <BR> <BR>5. They have been sueing dozens of people with frivolous cases. Failing to answer brings about a judgement in their favour; answering cost more money than all these small designers and foundries have. They win not by being right, but by default. <BR> <BR>6. They are bullies; it is not about trademarks but about deleting the competition. <BR> <BR>7. I could cite many more (and worse) cases which have cost me and other designers and foundries millions of dollars (and i am not exaggerating), but this will probably already make me the target of the next attack. <BR> <BR>8. This list doesn't discuss legal matters for their own sake. This list is not called legaphile; it is run by and for people who care for and live by typography.</div>
