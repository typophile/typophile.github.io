  but can't find an exact match for the some of the characters - e.g the \"T\" \"g\"
  \"e\".\r\n\r\nAny help much appreciated\r\n\r\nTom"

  body: "I\u2019m far from competitive in type ID, but my guess on this is that it
    is custom by Hoefler & Frere-Jones. It looks to me to have some of the DNA of
    Hoefler Text. It is really nice."

    K\xF3thay's [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/t26/tyrnavia/|Tyrnavia]] is based on
    Kis's lettering, but has an R with a tapered leg, although it extends below the
    baseline. The other Janson problem is the M, which in most Jansons looks lopsided
    (including Tyrnavia).\r\n\r\nI think this might be a custom face designed for
    the Tate, but I haven't tried Googling this subject yet.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: "Mike, you are quite right, it does indeed look closer to Janson. Tyrnavia
    is interesting, hadn't come across that one before.\r\n\r\nThe sample comes from
    the Tate's own magazine http://www.tate.org.uk/tateetc/about/ art directed by
    Cornel Windlin. In my view its the most well designed magazine around at the moment."

  body: "Tom, it always surprises me how art-related publications so often fail to
    credit the typography they use. I presume they have no colophon attributing their
    typefaces, or we wouldn't be having this discussion.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: "Mike, I certainly get your point, but have heard it expressed in the exhibition
    catalogue world that it can seem improper to call attention to this aspect of
    the design. I think the sentiment might be that if the type is to serve the subject
    and the overall design it shouldn't call attention to itself and, in turn, shouldn't
    be called out by name.\r\n\r\nI can see both sides to the point. \r\n\r\nMaybe
    we will get a response from someone at the Tate on this question of the typeface."

  body: "Mark, It seems to me that a small, inconspicuous colophon would not detract
    from the exhibition, any more than crediting the curators, art directors and others
    involved in presenting the show to the public detracts from the impact of the
    exhibition. I agree that may be their thinking, but it seems a disservice to the
    typography, in my opinion (of course, because type interests me).\r\n\r\n - Mike
