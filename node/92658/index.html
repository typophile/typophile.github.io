does anybody know if the Gill Sans family now includes an Arabic version ?

<p>Of course, for most practical purposes, putting in a generic Arabic typeface as part of a Times Roman or Arial typeface works to allow the characters to be displayed - and, thus, there is no real need to truly capture the spirit of Gill Sans in the Arabic portion of the font. Although that might still be a thing for a type designer to attempt - but such a typeface would presumably be sold separately and cost extra, as it probably should.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Deadlines and confused clients can certainly cause one to design something not to be proud of&hellip; Barring those things, as a rule it&rsquo;s possible to translate any &ldquo;feeling&rdquo; since humans anywhere all feel similar things.</p>
<p>BTW there&rsquo;s actually a hidden risk when designing something close to Latin, like Cyrillic or Greek: you feel more justified doing a straight formal migration. But something like Trajan does not evoke in its forms the same things to a Russian or a Greek; so for example its &ldquo;A&rdquo; should not be identical between those scripts. The idea of &ldquo;cognate shapes&rdquo; (as put forth by John Hudson for examples) is a red herring. In contrast when you&rsquo;re doing a totally different script (like Arabic) the disjoin is so obvious that it forces you to think more deeply.</p>

<p>But this is interesting though, because although the same feelings just don&rsquo;t translate, it does have to conjure up part of those feelings. Possibly we can&rsquo;t even speak of feelings here. Is it a more rational approach perhaps to bring the two in correlation with each other? I suppose it needs just a few key elements which help you connect the two scripts, rather than wanting to have them speak to you in the same way on an individual basis.</p>

To me, since Latin users and Cyrillic users are necessarily different in terms of their &ldquo;visual language background&rdquo;, any formal identicalness is a lost design opportunity.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Well, if you do apply formal congruence between the two scripts, I certainly agree they bring up different feelings – and that&rsquo;s actually my point. What I&rsquo;m advocating is making new shapes in the Arabic that evoke to Arabic readers what Gill Sans tends to evoke to Latin readers.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Almost always, yes. But it doesn&rsquo;t have to be: look at the &ldquo;Y&rdquo; shapes in Adobe&rsquo;s Sava.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>I don&rsquo;t have nativity in Cyrillic so it&rsquo;s hard for me to know offhand, but in the case of the &ldquo;A&rdquo; for example I would say the two main factors are width, and height of the bar. In the latter especially it should be possible to establish whether a higher bar or a lower bar evokes to Cyrillic users what Trajan evokes to Latin users.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Since Times Roman came in special versions for German and French, that capital &ldquo;A&rdquo; maybe should look different in Russian or Greek should not be too hard to accept.</p>
<p>While only native readers of those languages could really decide what is appropriate, a guess, a glimmering, might be possible from looking at what is popular in those languages. In the case of Russian, it seems that typefaces in the Modern classification (akin to Bodoni and Scotch Roman) were popular to nearly the exclusion of Transitional or Oldstyle faces, whereas in the Latin alphabet world, Transitional (like Baskerville or Times Roman) and Oldstyle (Garamond, Bembo, Caslon) were much more popular.</p>
<p>In the case of Hebrew, I&rsquo;ve heard that the Frank - Ruhl face was so popular as to be Israel&rsquo;s equivalent to Times Roman - to me, that face looks, visually, like a Scotch Roman, while the &ldquo;Siddur&rdquo; type of face is more like Times Roman or some other comfortable Transitional or Oldstyle.</p>
<p>For Greek, sans-serif faces seem to have a greater level of popularity for text use; this is not surprising to me, since it seems to me that they better avoid the tension between capitals that are like Roman capitals and lower-case that is like script or italics (even if it isn&rsquo;t sloped Porson-style).</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Arabic has 28 letters (not counting extended letters use by other languages, such as Farsi) most of which have four forms (some only two) depending on the position in the word. Some people think that Arabic is in fact even more complex than that – that it relies on complex ligation to be authentic.</p>

<p>Indeed the non-native has an interesting and useful role to play: naïve invention. Like how vernacular lettering can end up informing formal typography. That&rsquo;s why when I&rsquo;m hired as a consultant for Armenian type design by non-natives I prefer to let them first experiment, based on their instincts. Interesting things come out! On the other hand, when it comes time for me to apply my native expertise they have to be open to my confirmation or rejection of certain innovative features. Too often non-natives don&rsquo;t accept their limitations, sometimes resulting in actual cultural damage to vulnerable writing systems.</p>

<p>For example, yesterday I was having dinner at my dad&rsquo;s place and there was a printed manual from some digital switch for my dad&rsquo;s model train tracks by digirail. I noticed that the digirail logo uses Helvetica, the copyright notice on the left of it is set in Univers and they&rsquo;re using Arial for titles and such. I turned over the page and they&rsquo;re using Calibri on the inside. How can you make sense of this at all? I shared my frustrations and my dad was the only one who engaged with my story at all, but he was very dismissive of its importance. &ldquo;Who would even see that?&rdquo; I don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s even the point, is it? There is just no rationale behind it at all. That&rsquo;s my main objection. I had to tell him how they would have to pay for several licenses to make use of all these fonts—which as he said, no one else would see—before he understood the importance at all. He often dismisses my knowledge as being important and ascribes it to my autistic obsessions. That might very well be, but that doesn&rsquo;t take away the fact that some people are doing crazy things without any rationale behind it. That&rsquo;s absolutely my biggest frustration in life; the lack of logic behind so many things in my direct environment.</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Well, one can say that Arabic has 28 letters, just as one can say that Hebrew has 22 letters. Yes, they&rsquo;re all consonants. But the writing system isn&rsquo;t a full-fledged abugida, like Indic scripts or Ethiopic, since vowels are only an optional annotation.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Too often non-natives don&rsquo;t accept their limitations, sometimes resulting in actual cultural damage to vulnerable writing systems.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>Indeed, that has happened. But not all non-Western writing systems qualify as vulnerable. Occupying powers, and missionaries giving people their first writing system have the power to cause trouble.</p>
<p>And the appeal of the Western/U.S. media can lead to people doing it to themselves. But we also shouldn&rsquo;t underestimate the resilience of traditions.</p>
<p>Thus, if Koreans want to do a Fraktur-ish version of their script for a heavy metal record jacket, it&rsquo;s not likely to stunt the growth of their writing system. They can be allowed to have fun.</p>

<p>Certainly true.
The ideal balance between innovation and tradition depends mainly on the degree of vulnerability. Although paradoxically, there can be no cultural survival based only on tradition.</p>

<p>In the case of stuff like heavy metal Korean, what&rsquo;s happening is that users of a non-Western script wish to quickly appropriate the wealth of display typeface options that the Latin alphabet has built up over years. Advertisers with products to introduce and ad campaigns to begin&hellip; can&rsquo;t wait for the natural and organic evolution of a script.</p>
<p>The glitz and glamor of our wealthy Western lifestyles has beguiled the rest of the world in many respects, and to expect the rest of the world to live simple lives in poverty so they can remain quaint and picturesque for our sake is unreasonable. People want to survive, to thrive, to have fun. So they jump at things that advance their personal interests, with little thought of the long-term impact on values like cultural survival.</p>

		<div class="commentbody">Arabic geometric; hmm that&rsquo;s something more difficult that you can imagine. I&rsquo;ve never seen a geometric arabic typeface that could satisfy geometry and tradition at the same time. But if anyone could do this it would be marvelous. Up until this moment everything that I&rsquo;ve ever seen just disappointed me. The good thing about Myriad Arabic form Robert Slimbach is that he didn&rsquo;t try to make a geometric arabic typeface. Instead he managed to create a low contrast typeface amalgamated from naskh and thulth style. It seems that adobe&rsquo;s Myriad Arabic is mostly influenced by the Adobe Arabic typeface from tim holloway. They share very similar constructions. Anyway I think that was a very good decision which seems to be working well even at short text.</div>

<p>It&rsquo;s true that cultural impoverishment is a loss, which should be avoided. My point is, though, that in conditions of material poverty, escape from it becomes the first priority, and this leads to cultural damage when an alien culture holds the promise of escape from material poverty.</p>
<p>Making use of things from the outside, rather than assimilating them first, is the quickest and cheapest route to having them available. And telling desperate people to &ldquo;go slow&rdquo; is likely not to have the desired result.</p>
<p>Of course, often we&rsquo;re not dealing with something as excusable as dire poverty - humans are naturally imitative as well, and so they will gratuitously imitate foreign models with some sort of prestige as well. But the less desperation is involved, the more a foreign model is likely to be just one alternative, which can end up enriching rather than overwhelming the borrower.</p>
<p>The real Myriad Arabic indeed shows that a sans-serif unstressed Arabic can be far more authentic and natural than the example you gave earlier as showing what not to do. Never mind cultural values - it&rsquo;s likely to be far more legible to a native reader of Arabic as well.</p>
<p>Still, the techniques used in the negative example are not <!-- raw HTML omitted -->always<!-- raw HTML omitted --> wrong. Had the Latin typeface in question been <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Clearview<!-- raw HTML omitted --> instead of Myriad, then the expedient could be defended as necessary to allow the Arabic language to benefit from the legibility research that went into the highway typeface without doing it over again.</p>
<p>Since legibility is what people are used to, though, the process shouldn&rsquo;t end with that first step - which is what happened in the typeface you rightly deem worthy of criticism.</p>

<p>But one can avoid imposing the uniformity of the Latin script, and still change the relative height of the taller characters.

<p>I don&rsquo;t know the script, but I live in an area where most small businesses are run by people who&rsquo;ve originally been taught writing in Arabic or Persian, and a notable aspect of the vernacular Latin-script signage here –and even some of the large-scale sign lettering – is an extremely variant (and thus for a script conservative, &ldquo;wrong&rdquo;) x-height. Whereas first-script Latin writers have the idea of x-height and baseline hardcoded as concepts for their own handwriting, imprinted in a malleable childhood age, this does not apply to later-life second-script latin writers who originally wrote in arabic script. I mean, the beautiful slanted handwriting style most Persian-speakers I know have (Nastaliq?) doesn&rsquo;t even have a baseline as such, let alone an x-height, so no wonder it doesn&rsquo;t translate readily into a four-heights understanding of Latin script!</p>
<p>(Personally, by the way, I find the &ldquo;wrongness&rdquo; of the letters interesting and a potential source of inspiration, rather than something to be chided.)</p>

By comparison to Arabic Latin is like  locomotives (the capitals)  pulling railway cars of equal height (the miniscules). Choo choo!  Unfortunately a whole generation of designers  is now enamoured some with making Arabic as much like Latin as possible.  The important thing about Eric Gill&rsquo;s Sans is not just the simplification, (Johnston and many others before did it first) but that it was a beautiful and legible design, a generic distillation of traditional serif letters.</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>@ John 
Let me illustrate this the other way around. There are three vertical lines on the letter &ldquo;سـ&rdquo; which is called teeth in persian simply because they look like teeth of a tomb. right? Imagine you have enough terms for latin letters but people are not aware of that simply because they don&rsquo;t read much material on the subject of latin typography as they do on persian typography and they try to refer to the bottom parts of lowercase &ldquo;m&rdquo; as teeth in a broad manner even though they don&rsquo;t look like teeth to the natives. What happens from that point is these shapes start to change and look like the parts form the letter &ldquo;سـ&rdquo; because whenever they search for the term in any medium the letter &ldquo;سـ&rdquo; comes to the screen. It&rsquo;s not a problem in anyway as long as it looks appropriate to the certain features of the script, but beyond that it just becomes something as would refer to as ugly. That is what is happening in my opinion in many arabic typefaces. It&rsquo;s just too much exaggeration.</p>
<p>We have terminologies of our own. Some people use the latin ones just because the arabic/persian terms are not accessible like latin terminologies. I&rsquo;m sorry that it sounds like nagging, but it&rsquo;s very surprising that it keeps happening in many places and nobody cares. It doesn&rsquo;t seem right to me.</p>

<p>Do you think a cultural shift in the Western world is needed before people stop with these practices in the Arabic script? This might be a misconception, but I have the feeling these non-Western cultures are poorly understood and generally disrespected, so this may give both parties the idea that the Western culture is something to live up to. In some ways perhaps it is, but I&rsquo;m not sure this applies to the scripts we use or how we use them.</p>
<p>What do you think the future of the Arabic script is though? Will it eventually come closer to the Latin script? Will traditions be upheld or is the script doomed given certain cultural shifts and the idea of a world culture?</p>

<p>If you look at someones handwriting in the native script you can find similarities between the typefaces and the way hand writes letter shapes. Naturally when you write a sentence in latin and in whatever style you can imagine you will get a horizontal line that could imply the x-height. Google image search this term: دست نوشته  (which means handwriting in persian) and I dare you if you can find one example to show the same thing in arabic script. There is no same height rule in arabic script the way it exist in latin. If you ask someone to write arabic script with a strict height rule like x-height it wouldn&rsquo;t be natural for them (just try it!). If you take greek as an example of successful latinized script when entered type systems it&rsquo;s because it shares many similarities like x-height and separated letters as latin but arabic is cursive and fluid. It doesn&rsquo;t work that way. The only way that I could name latinized arabic typefaces is hoax latin in arabic.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I don&rsquo;t think that attitudes in the West changing or not will matter when it comes to people in other societies choosing to imitate the West - because their reasons for such imitation have no real connection to any shortcomings the West perceives in their societies.</p>
<p>Instead, it has to do with how they perceive the West, not how the West perceives them.</p>
<p>So, to take a less controversial example, look at movie posters in Korean that make their script look like heavy metal Fraktur or something else which has no resemblance to a Chinese brush stroke. (And the fact that their script is partly indigenous and partly derivative from another culture to begin with puts another face on the issue - why not abandon the foreign Chinese style for Korean for another foreign style, as of course the Korean alphabet could be done up to look like Eurostyle&hellip;)</p>
<p>America is the land of Hollywood and Playboy, Coca-Cola and Apple. It impresses foreigners for certain reasons, just as, say, France impresses foreigners for certain other reasons.</p>
<p>(Although this is directly a response to Martin Silvertant&rsquo;s post, clearly its premise implies disagreement with Hrant Papazian&rsquo;s preceding post as well - imitation of the West for its glamor has little to do with the Arab Spring and its - from a Western perspective, as valid as I may feel that perspective to be - failure.)</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>That &lsquo;Matching Arabic–Latin scripts in logotypes&rsquo; workshop gave great insights. It&rsquo;s amazing to see these Arabic variants. I don&rsquo;t understand the H&amp;M one though. I thought Vivienne Westwood and Balmain were particularly well done. Shouldn&rsquo;t the Arabic Balmain a bit lighter though?</p>
<p>The Arabic Gucci logo is particularly interesting to me because stylistically I don&rsquo;t really see a resemblance and yet I strongly associate the two in terms of quality. The Arabic logo has a certain sharpness and clarity which I see in the Latin Gucci as well.</p>
<p>Could anyone possibly post some pictures of Arabic logos for which a Latin version has been added later? It seems harder to do than the other way around but that&rsquo;s just speculation. Does anyone have experience with both practices?</p>
