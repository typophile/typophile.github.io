  body: "\xBD is alt 0189.  Hold down the alt key while keying 0189 into the keypad.
    \ The num lock must be on.  You get used to it.  0188 is \xBC.  0162 is \xA2.
    \ \u2022 is 0149.  It works here in this comment field, DreamWeaver, CorelDraw
    and every program I can think of so it's worth memorizing or scratching it into
    your desk. "
