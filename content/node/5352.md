body: I am thinking of going to TypeCon. Or whatever it is called. I am looking for
  really cheap accommodation, shared would work just fine. Remember us old guys are
  on a fixed income. Well, I wish it was fixed. You want to fix it for me? <BR> <BR>Also
  how do I find URL to TypeCon? <BR> <BR>By the way, where is it? The event I mean.

  body: Do come, Gerald, it&#39;s going to be great. Lots of people looking for roomies,
    too. Link to the website from banners here at Typophile, or go to <a href="http://www.typecon.com"
    target="_blank">www.typecon.com</a>. The conference is in San Francisco July 21-25,
    with the main program at the Hotel Nikko, with optional workshops at the California
    College of the Arts and the San Francisco Center for the Book.

  body: Gerald, <BR> <BR>We&#39;d love to see you there! Tamye provided the details;
    it&#39;s up to the rest of us to persuade you.  <BR> <BR>I can assure you that
    you will have a great time -- it&#39;s going to be the best TypeCon thus far.
    And in an attempt to add a bit of flex to your fixed income, I&#39;ll promise
    to buy you a drink. <BR> <BR>Jon

    digs. <BR> <BR>Jon, <BR> <BR>My body is my temple

  body: Gerald, can&#39;t offer cheap digs, but willing to share and split cost of
    room in the Nikko.

  body: Nick, <BR> <BR>That is one surprising offer. I am looking into the possibilities
    of going. I have a confusion in my paper work. Canadian passport, Finnish resident.
    I may not have everything I need. Or rather, too many things. <BR> <BR>Are boxing
    gloves part of the dress code? I hope not. <BR> <BR>
