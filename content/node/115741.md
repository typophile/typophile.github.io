  a chisel texter or a paint brush?\r\n\r\nhttp://designspiration.net/image/864492140743/\r\nhttp://designspiration.net/image/601687944884/\r\n\r\nAnd
  any ideas where I can get some books/tutorials for this kind of lettering technique?\r\n\r\nCheers"

    Typophile <a href=\"http://typophile.com/node/31391\">Charles Borges de Oliveira</a>
    http://www.borgeslettering.com/ does some lettering. I don't think he is the only
    typophile to do that. By the way, Cabarga's book, <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Logo-Lettering-Bible-Leslie-Cabarga/dp/1581804369\">Logo,
    Font & Lettering Bible</a> used to be a reference here on typophile.\r\n\r\nHere
    is a typophile thread that may lead to something helpful: http://typophile.com/node/98612"
