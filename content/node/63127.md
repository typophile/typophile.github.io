  body: "Hah. 4 minutes. Thank you, Jeff and Jan too.\r\n\r\nAnd yes, on the WhatTheFont.
    I actually tried it first earlier in the week but that was with very small version
    of their logo they provided, it wasn't a great source file. They sent me this
    last night and I thought to post here first, though I had it in the back of my
    mind to return to WTF.\r\n\r\nI appreciate it (and will improve my posting titles
    the next time)."
