body: "I'm working on a book project and the editor has asked to include a handwriting
  typeface for central character. I've searched most of the free sites and pay sites,
  but the scripts that are good enough (opentype with ligatures, etc.) tend to be
  a bit too refined for a pre-teen girl. I must admit I'm a bit stuck.\r\n\r\nHer
  handwriting will likely go up to 3 pages and we need to include \"reluctant readers,\"
  so legibility is important. \r\n\r\nI've managed to find two that come close to
  filling the job:\r\n<a href=\"http://www.dafont.com/jennifer.font\">Jennifer's Hand
  Writing</a> (captures the age)\r\nand <a href=\"http://www.dafont.com/lauren-c-brown.font\">Lauren
  C. Brown</a> (the legibility is decent)\r\n\r\nNeither have ligatures, so will require
  a lot of grooming that I'd love to avoid. I also don't mind paying for the font
  if it's the right one. I know that open type will be opening up doors, especially
  for script fonts, but I haven't seen anything that fits this niche. \r\n\r\nHelp?\r\n\r\n\r\n

  body: "If you're doing 3 pages and the readership is broad I would avoid a connected
    script. Print writing, like those you've mentioned, will be much more readable.
    Also <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/fontfont/ff_providence_sans/\">FF
    Providence</a>, <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/creative_alliance/andy/\">Andy</a>,

    Zemke Hand</a>. \r\n\r\nTo avoid shape repetition you can move baselines a bit
    and flip symmetrical characters, but at 3 pages you're going to have a lot of
    the same letters regardless of how many alternates or ligatures you have. Readability
    is most important.\r\n\r\nAlternatively, you can pay a bit more and have your
    ideal <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/services/handfont.php\">font created from
    scratch</a>."

  body: "The Amy Papaelias site is funny, but not quite what i was looking for :)\r\n\r\nAnd
    Olga has a bit too much variation in the x-height and character weight to sustain
    a few pages of text. \r\n\r\nStephen, I totally agree with an unconnected script
    and I took a look at some of the ones you pointed out. They're close but they
    look like boy's handwriting. I'm anticipating needing to make adjustments to a
    few words here and there to reduce the impact of repeated letters (doubled letters,
    character angle, baselines...). \r\n\r\nAs for getting a font made from scratch,
    I won't get any of the ligatures I'm hoping for. I suppose, in my dream world,
    I was hoping that a type designer who visits this site had one made of his/her
    daughters handwriting and went to the trouble of adding all the opentype features.
    Like I said, dream world. \r\n\r\n\r\n     \r\n"

    as a kid. They jhust put circles or hearts over their i's. \r\nIf it were a printed
    character, I'd go with it. It's be nice to have a slightly combined handwriting
    font where 'ing' and 'th' (etc.) get close to a cursive without completely crossing
    over."
