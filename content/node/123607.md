  body: "If the |A| is what make you think it's not Ronda, depending on the age of
    the sample, it could well be a non digitised alternate glyph.\r\n\r\nEdit: confirmed
    here: http://fontsinuse.com/uses/8676/official-california-visitor-map\r\nIt looks
    that, like many 1970s' typefaces, there were plenty of variations that never made
    it to digital: http://fontsinuse.com/typefaces/10234/itc-ronda"

  body: Confirming Ronda too. Mike Yenaga's [[http://bowfinprintworks.com/BauhausFaces1.html|"Bauhaus-Style"
    Font Identification Guide]] showcases this top rounded alternate /A on '[[http://bowfinprintworks.com/Fonts/FontScans/RondaLt.gif|Ronda
    Light]]'.

  body: Don't know any official version of Ronda ITC that comes with this alternate
    /A, not even the [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/itc/ronda/pro/glyphs.html|Pro
    version]]. If you need to reproduce it exactly, I guess the only option you have
    is to recreate it (and from /U, should be quite easy).
