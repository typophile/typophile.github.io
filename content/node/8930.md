body: It occurred to me last week as I was attending a funeral that designing one&#39;s
  own gravestone seems like a natural thing. Of course, it requires a little planning
  ahead. Has anyone else here considered doing this? <BR> <BR>&#40;Maybe I should
  have saved this post for October, but, well, who knows what might have happened
  before then?&#41;

  body: Yes, it&#39;s been on my mind ever since my grandfather died &#40;I was named
    after him, so I had the very odd experience of attending a funeral that had my
    name all over it, too&#41;. <BR> <BR>I was thinking of carving the stone as well.

    am more prone to ignore it now--out of sight out of mind. <BR> <BR>ChrisL

  body: 'About a twelve years ago, I wrote a translation of Ugo Foscolo&#39;s&#42;
    poem &#39;Dei Sepolcri&#39; &#40;&#39;On Tombs&#39;&#41;, a kind of meandering
    neo-classical meditation on the meaning of mortuary monuments and memorials. And
    as a result I&#39;ve often thought, since, about what I would like for a gravestone.
    Not so much the design per se &#40;other than that it would be handcarved, probably
    in welsh slate: no router&#39;d granite for me, thank you!&#41;, but about what
    I would like written there. I currently favour <i>Domine dilexi decorem domus
    tu'
