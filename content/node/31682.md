body: "After years looking for the name of this typeface, I've diceded to beg help
  for some people here. I'm looking for the name (only the name) of this typeface:
  http://lonestarspice.com/singles/suyluscd.JPG\r\n\r\nIt has a particular and peculiar
  kind of \"S\" that we cannot find in many typefaces. I know it is not a custom design
  because I often find it in some posters or book covers, but none of these sourcers
  tells the name of this type.\r\n\r\nThis typeface was used many times as the Spice
  Girls logo on their first and second CD's and, if I'm not wrong, it is used in the
  Panini Comics logo [http://www.paninicomics.co.uk/Home.jsp]\r\nLower case sample
  here: http://lonestarspice.com/albums/spicemd2.jpg\r\n\r\nCan anyone help me solve
  this mistery? I'll be glad to have opinions that leads me to an answer.\r\n\r\nThanks
  for the attention."

  body: "I assume that the SPICE logo is what you are really after? I ask because
    none of that other text appears to use the same typeface (just compare those S's,
    for one thing).\r\n\r\nDoes anyone have a showing of a predigital typeface called
    Tempor? The Solotype Catalog has only a very limited showing, but what it does
    show makes it a possibility."

  body: "Hi Adriano,\r\n\r\nI am also trying to identify the typeface used on most
    of the Spice Girls album covers and merchandise. I have searched everywhere trying
    to find this font but have had no luck. I was just wondering if you happened to
    figure out what typeface it is?  If so, could you please tell me the name of it
    and where you found it?  If not, perhaps we could compare notes and hopefully
    figure out what font it is. Feel free to contact me (just click on my name.) Any
    help you could give me would be greatly appreciated. I look forward to hearing
    from you."

  body: NewCompact is the name of the Spice Girls font. Appeared around 1992. Might
    be a clone of something else - perhaps an unknown Type 1 font designed for Mac
    - as it was "Generated by Metamorphosis Professional 2.0".
