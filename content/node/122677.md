body: "I'm trying to find a font (or pair of fonts) that look as much as possible
  like the text on [[http://idahlgen.scienceontheweb.net/Hermelinweb/ | S.G. Hermelin's
  map of V\xE4rmland]] (1808).[img:sites/default/files/old-images/font-sample1_4713.jpg]\r\n\r\nNote
  the difference between the regular and italic font, especially with regard to \"g\".
  In the original this type was very small -- it is an *extremely* detailed map.\r\n\r\nI'm
  working on a book of family history, and my plan is to use the magic of Photoshop
  to erase the names on the map, and put back only the names of the larger towns and
  the various hamlets where my ancestors lived, to make something that is more easily
  read and understood nowadays. I'm fully prepared to photoshop in the Swedish accent
  marks, if I can't find a modern font that includes them.\r\n\r\nIt's kind of Baskerville-y,
  but not quite. Where do I even go to look for such things? or to find out what the
  original font might have been?\r\n\r\n-- Doctor Science"

    the lettering in 19th century Germanic maps. They used to have rather generic
    names, like \u2018Kartenschrift\u2019 [map type].\r\nConsider:  R\xF6misch http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/roemisch/

  body: "John Baskerville designed his eponymous typeface with the distinctive _g_
    around 1752 and the engraver of the Hermelin map would almost certainly have seen
    it in use. He seems to have thought the ear was unnecessary. Nineteenth century
    map engravers and sign makers seemed to find a source of expression in making
    unusual versions of the letter _g_. Consider this remarkable _Ausgang_: https://www.flickr.com/photos/hardwig/2524903281/\r\nDon"

    threads before, but I didn't *understand* them.\r\n\r\nSince the number of words
    I need \"in clear\" is fairly small, I actually think what I'll do is trace over
    the originals (either by hand or in Photoshop), and replace them with that clear
    copy. Effectively, I'll \"re-engrave\" the letters in the same style as the original."
