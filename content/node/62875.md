  body: "The connectors are different too. More rounded in this sample, compared to
    angular in Nick Curtis's Monte Carlo Script. The resemblance seems too much to
    be a coincidence, but I don't know if it's just a different version of the Deberny
    & Peignot type from 1920 that Nick Curtis gives as the basis for Monte Carlo Script.\r\n\r\n-
