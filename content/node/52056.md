  as it's perfect for what I want to do, I was wondering if anyone could help me identify
  it.. It's probably me just being really slow, I've seen it around loads but just
  don't know who's made it or what it's name is...\r\n\r\nHopefully you can help form
  this picture attached...\r\n\r\nThanks in advance!\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/bookcovertype_6102.jpg]"
