  based upon the original 'g' glyph that I drew out. Here is my progress after a few
  glyps. Does this look cohesive and going in the right direction? Ideas/Comments/Crits

  body: "Okay---it started with a \"g\", but g's, because of their structure, usually
    don't have much influence on how the rest of a font is designed. Whereas \"h\",
    \"a\" and \"c\" typically provide key elements.\r\n\r\nNext step: skew that \"n\"
    upwards and right-a-ways to make it match the motion of the \"g\", then make the
    \"n\" into an \"h\", and keep extrapolating from there.\r\n\r\nWhat you've drawn
    so far looks similar to a completed font of mine, name undecided;\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/buttered.png]\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/elstrange-ocatfood.gif]\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/tamyerocks350x210.gif]\r\n\r\nThis
    one is a Cooperesque display/text hybrid with a heavy cursive influence, designed
    for packaging and poster work.\r\n\r\nFeel free to assimilate elements and details
    you feel will be useful---whatever fits in :^)\r\n\r\nj a m e s"

  body: "James to the rescue! Haha, thanks for the feedback man...it does have a similar
    quality to your font! Sorry, but I don't understand your skew suggestion... :-/\r\n\r\nI
    was actually going to say something, where I knew most typefaces are started with
    the 'h' and the 'o' so I was planning on getting to the 'h' next. The only reason
    I did the 'n' and 'e' is because at the same time as I sketched the 'g' I sketched
    out an 'e' and 'n' for some unknown reason. :-D\r\n\r\nI'll have to get back to
    this at work on Friday, but for now I would like to see what people think. If
    anything I'd like to complete this and have it to use in layouts and such...as
    I don't own any font-creation software."

    like the way that the \"g\" is weighted more toward the bottom without feeling
    imbalanced. perhaps there is a way that you can achieve that with the rest of
    the letters? i think i like that aspect because it gives it a fresh, almost brushed,
    feel but without being a script. it's the same reason why i like <a href=\"http://www.underware.nl/site2/index.php3?id1=bello&id2=overview\">Bello</a>.\r\n\r\nyou

    'n' seems a little squooshed. Thoughts?"

  body: "the tail of the \"a\" is a new element that could be incorporated in a few
    other places\u2026 (???)\r\n\r\nit seems like the counters are not consistent.
    the \"n\" is \"squooshed\" and the \"e\" has the same ammount of space in its
    counter. the counter on the \"a\" is huge. i think that the \"b\" is looking the
    most balanced out of all of them in regards to the counter, and the stoke modulation.\r\n\r\njust
    my two cents,\r\n\r\n-------\r\nnc"

  body: "Keep it going David---it's gradualy taking shape. Once you've designed certain
    key parts, a font almost designs itself.\r\n\r\nSuggestions:\r\n* shorten the
    descenders by 35%\r\n* slant the stem (right side stroke) of \"a\" to the right\r\n*
    try bending/curving the right side strokes of m, n, h to the left in a sweeping
    continuous arc, eliminating the curled tips. That will take it in a brushy direction
    and help make those forms more unique.\r\n* \"s\" is interesting but I need to
    see it in use, as part of a word or two, before making any decisions.\r\n\r\nIf
    you want to turn it into a real font there is a free font making program listed
    somewhere in the Typowiki.\r\n\r\nj a m e s"

    got back here a day ago, so you're hardly late responding.\r\n\r\nTo get some
    clues about brush dynamics and features, spend a while looking at art brush scripts.
    Art & Sign fonts, and Letterhead Fonts, make some of the best examples around.
    My idea is to make your design more specific, and a brush grotesk seems a natural
    direction to go from this point. A brush grotesk would also be more unique than
    a typographic grotesk\r\n\r\nj a m e s"

  body: "I am by no means an expert, and will happily class myself as a complete noobie
    when it comes to the actual task of type design. Though I will offer some constructive
    criticism which I am only too happy to be taken with a very large grain of salt.
    (In fact I offer this as an opportunity for myself to learn also and look forward
    to finding out if I am seeing things that are viewed differently by the experts.)\r\n\r\nLet
    me begin by saying I really like the feeling that this typeface exudes, its got
    a great energy and seems like fun!\r\n\r\nLooking at the face as it stands I feel
    that perhaps the 'a', 'g', and 'e' seem to have a slightly different vertical
    axis than the rest of the face. These three glyphs feel as though they are 'falling'
    to the left a little more than the others which lean toward the right.\r\n\r\nShould
    the counter of the 'g' and 'e' be on a similar axis? Perhaps the 'o' also? The
    counter of the 'a' perhaps seems a little squished relative to the 'b' & 'd' etc?\r\n\r\nCould
    the space between the cross bar and counter of the 'f' be loosened?\r\n\r\nI hope
    some of these thoughts are useful, and look forward to seeing you progress.\r\n\r\nGood
    luck.\r\n-nic"
