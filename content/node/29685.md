  put a decimal tab in a line, the line breaks too early. Problem is, when i move
  the dec.tab rightwards, the line breaks long (that means 3-4 millimeters before
  the '0' meets the text box \"wall\". take a look at the picture below.\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/post-18-98187-dectab_6325.jpg]\r\n\r\n\r\nall
  margins and paddings etc are set to zero.\r\n\r\nDoes anyon know how to solve this
  without changing the width of the text box, and preferrably without using tables?\r\n\r\nbest,\r\n\r\nalex"

  body: I just played with it a bit, and it seems, that if you change the paragraph
    flush right, it should work. Strange, isn't it?
