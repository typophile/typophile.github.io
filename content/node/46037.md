body: "Hello,\r\n\r\n\r\nI just had a brainstormy idea and wanted to ask people about
  how they feel about it. I have no direct plans to use it immediately, but if I get
  rather positive answers I might at some point.\r\n\r\nNow, there are a lot of serif
  fonts that have a \r\nlike Regent II, ITC Anima, Fritz Quadrata, Gill Facia, Hiroshige,
  etc. of which the capital U has a \"descender\", the second stroke hits the bottom,
  sometimes with a half serif there as well.\r\n\r\nMost other serif fonts don't have
  this feature.\r\n\r\nNow, starting from such a font (i.e. \"regular\" U without
  the foot), the idea was, that instead of attaching the [[ogonek]] at the middle,
  one could take an footed alternate of U to attach it. Considering that for a,e,i,u,A,E,I
  the ogonek is attached at the last stroke, at the right side of the glyph, this
  could bring in harmony:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/uogonek_6101.png]\r\n\r\nThe
  image shows in the center the original U from Junicode (I like that font for experimental
  tweakings). to the left of it is the conventional, built-in Uogonek. To the right
  my proposal (roughly; this was just a quick patch-up).\r\n\r\nThe base form of the
  U would not be altered, so the first U's basic shape would look different from the
  second less the ogonek in LIETUVI\u0172.\r\n\r\nDoes this make sense? How does it
  feel? Is it a nice idea, or would this detail distract too much while reading? Lithuanian
  input appreciated :-)\r\nAlso, I see that while the brings Uogonek nearer to its
  AEI counterparts, this also makes O a standalone exception. Then again, as I figured,
  o-ogonek is only used in transcribing Old Norse (and there the other ogenecked letters
  are not) and in some Native American orthographies, but there in complementery distribution
  to u-ogonek (either u-ogonek is used OR o-ogonek)*). If there is no text containing
  both o-ogonek and u-ogonek, that's not a problem (no visual inconsistency between
  right-palced and center-placed ogonek between O and U), and for languages containing
  both i-ogonek and u-ogonek (Lithuanian, some Native American) we have achieved a
  consistency among the ogonecked capitals (and also between lc and uc).\r\n\r\nOr
  does that design look awkward?\r\nAnd most important: did you understand this post
  at all, or did I &mdash; as usually &mdash; overcomplicate my description?\r\n\r\n\r\nSzabolcs\r\n\r\n_______________\r\n*

  body: "Szabolcs, \r\n\r\nThe problem with the ogonek positioning in the Junicode
    font is that somebody thought they are centered, with of course isn't true. The
    top of the ogonek has been positioned at the geometric centre of the base glyph,
    but of course _optically_ the ogoneks are positioned in the left part of the letter,
    which looks absurd. And it's the optical impression that counts. \r\n\r\nIt is
    quite easily fixed and does not require redrawing the U, and also solves the O
    problem (my changes are on the right): \r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Oogonek_Uogonek_4407.png]\r\n\r\nNow,
    the ogoneks are slightly to the right. One could also try attaching them really
    in the optical centre if one wants (i.e. just slightly more to the left than what
    I did, but definitely not as far to the left as in the original glyph which is
    shown in the middle): \r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Oogonek_Uogonek1_4958.png]\r\n\r\nBut
    the most important thing is that you _cannot_ just stick a composite ogonek onto
    O or U or e or even a, for that matter. You need to redraw the junctions every
    time. \r\n\r\nAdam"

  body: "Hello,\r\n\r\nEven though I like Junicode generally for quick tweakings,
    examples and fix-ups (I'm not involved in its developement or enhancement), ('cos
    it's a freely available nice humanist face--- though it has its flaws, like a
    ridiculously wide capital T) I see now that in this very case it was a poor choice
    insofar as in determining the initial assumptions.\r\n\r\nOn a side-note, the
    Oogonek-examples you gave give the impression as if the ductus was starting at
    the bottom of the O and would advance _clockwise_, which is unusual for the latin
    script and is slightly disturbing to me.\r\n\r\n\"But the most important thing
    is that you _cannot_ just stick a composite ogonek onto O or U or e or even a,
    for that matter. You need to redraw the junctions every time.\"\r\n\r\n_That_
    was clear :-) This goes for most good diacritics, (I prefer different (mostly:
    different wide) circumflexes (circumflices ;-) ) on i (e.g. Turkish) and w (e.g.
    in Welsh language). It is however twice as true for attached diacritcs: ogoneks,
    cedillas and horns (in Thai).\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile looking at it, I'm mysself less
    and less convinced of a legged variant of U for attaching an ogonek, you did circumvened
    directly addressing the question regarding its viability by merely pointing out
    (completely right) that it was unnecessary.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBruzs's \"centered\"
    ogonek on E in the Lithuanian-govt.-sponsored font was insightful as an alternative,
    maybe less traditional, more avantegarde solution.\r\n\r\n\r\nClearly, the sound
    value of a letter is completely unimportant for glyph design. The complementary
    distribution of oogonek and uogonek, however, were important for my above considerations,
    if both were to appear in the same language, my suggestion would have lost validity
    immediately.\r\n\r\n\r\nA last question to the explicitly Lithuanians here: do
    words start with uogonek? I have only met them at the end of words. Would capital
    Uogoneks appear e.g. in names (not necessarily personal), or capitalised due to
    the beginning of a sentence, or only in all-caps settings (e.g. if they only happen
    to appear in medial and final positions)?\r\n\r\n\r\nSzabolcs"

  body: "A legged U is historically correct in some lettering styles but not in others.
    I think in principle, it would be possible to mix a round U and a legged Uogonek
    in one typeface, but this would need to be done carefully. Some readers may get
    confused as they might think that the alternate shape signifies some additional
    difference. Also, the legged U would need to be drawn properly, with appropriate
    weight distribution on the stems, and with a complete redrawing of the curve.
    I realize that your own sketch for Junicode is just a rough illustration of the
    concept, but at the same time it clearly demonstrates that this is not a quick-and-dirty
    job. This brings us to a final point: in many cases, it would be uneconomic to
    redraw the base letter so drastically for the sake of Uogonek. I fear that it
    would often be done incompetently, as diacritic extensions are often done by people
    other than the original designers. One for sure \u2014 I do not see the legged
    Uogonek to be the default approach to solve the problem. I think it can be considered
    a valid alternate approach for some, very specific, typeface classes. \r\n\r\nA.\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: "The \u0119 character is certainly the oldest among the letters with an \"ogonek\".
    E caudata was the only such glyph used in medieval Latin (interchangibly with
    \xE6 for the same sound). \r\n\r\nPolish adopted the letter \u0119 for the nasalized
    \"e\" sound, probably because it just \"was there\" and was not used for anything
    else. Then, Polish borrowed the ogonek shape to form the letter for the nasalized
    \"o\" sound, which became \"\u0105\". From Polish, the shape was borrowed by the
    Lithuanian, which in addition to \u0105 and \u0119 also have an i and a u with
    the ogonek (Lithuania was in union with Poland for several centuries; Poland was
    mostly the dominant part in that union). \r\n\r\nMy guess is that the o with ogonek
    as used in Old Norse is an independent development. However, Decodeunicode's description
    of \"the Polish ogonek, which goes all the way down to the bottom line (like \u201Cp\u201D)\"
    is not correct. Depending on the structure of the typeface, the ogonek can be
    quite large or small. The larger the intended size for a typeface, the smaller
    the diacritics (that is a general rule). In typefaces intended for small sizes,
    the ogonek needs to be quite large so it remains legible. In typefaces intended
    for display sizes, the ogonek and the other diacritcal marks are usually much
    less pronounced. \r\n\r\nThere are some images on my \r\nhttp://www.twardoch.com/download/polishhowto/ogonek.html\r\nbut
