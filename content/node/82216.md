  body: "I was able to find a number of similar fonts, but nothing that was an identical
    match. Hand printed fonts are very easy and cheap to make, although this does
    seem to show some lettering skill.\r\n\r\nSimilar fonts (without links, sorry):
    Handwriting Absolute, Prov Draftsman NDP, Joanne Script, American Writer, Soli
    and Graphite. Most of these I think are at MyFonts.com\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
