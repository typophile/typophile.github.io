  a book to be published before. I know I need to register for copyright, ISBN, and

  body: Your question is not entirely clear with regard to the difference between
    publishing and printing. Does the author plan to self-publish this book, by having
    you design it and send it to a printer? Or does the author plan to submit it to
    a publisher, in which case the author does not usually get to choose who will
    design the book?

  body: "\"I know I need to register for copyright, ISBN, and library of congress
    #.\"\r\n\r\nThree completely different things.\r\n\r\n1. You don't need to \"register\"
    for copyright. The book is copyrighted by law as soon as it is written.\r\n\r\n2.
    ISBN: Yes, you can apply for this through the Library of Congress. If the book
    will be sold in stores, you'll want a barcode to go with it.\r\n\r\n3. Library
    of Congress #. The LOC does not grant CIP data to self-published books."

  body: Yes, what Joshua said, but with a minor correction on ISBNs. The Library of
    Congress doesn't sell them; in the United States they are sold by Bowker (isbn.org).
    For self-publishing, it is also possible to buy them from a reseller; this can
    be much cheaper since the reseller can buy a large block of numbers at a low per-unit
    price and sell the numbers in it more cheaply than buying a single ISBN from Bowker.
    The disadvantage is that in that case your ISBN won't have a meaningful publisher
    prefix, and some distributors don't accept such ISBNs. So I'd say, if the author
    wants to do the sales and distribution, a reseller ISBN is fine; if stores or
    Amazon will be involved, get one directly from Bowker.

    for periodicals) are granted for free through the Library of Congress. ISBNs are
    a different story."

  body: Why is the designer involved with obtaining the ISBN, etc? I've designed several
    self-published books for clients and have never been asked to do those things.

    books, and offers such services. I'd classify it more as a part of \"packaging\"
    or \"production,\" but it depends on what's needed I suppose.\r\n\r\nhttp://bwabooks.com/"

  body: "<cite>I've designed several self-published books for clients and have never
    been asked to do those things.</cite>\r\n\r\nI've had to. It depends how the author
    does the self-publishing. With places like CreateSpace you can get a package that
    includes the ISBN, and no further effort is required. But if the author wants
    a more independent process, then if there is to be an ISBN, either the author
    or the designer (assuming there is one) has to get it. And if the author has never
    published before, as is not uncommon, the designer is more likely to have some
    idea of the process."

    clients.

  body: Yes, I have designed self-published books where I also served as a sort of
    production supervisor, doing things like getting ISBNs and barcodes and coordinating
    with printers or navigating POD services. Some authors like to be able to hand
    off a manuscript and say, "Make it happen."

  body: "It has been several days, but I forgot to add that one reason my wife got
    into production -- and packaging -- is the pay is often better. Like so many designer,
    my wife found she (they, now) make as much or more off composition as design,
    and the number of people who can *package* a book -- take a manuscript that still
    needs editorial work and take it through print/bind -- is relatively small.\r\n\r\nThis
    has led her studio to do a fair number of architectural books, often by smaller,
    historic cities in the North Carolina, usually published by the city or county.
    There is a lot of hand-holding, but it is paid for. \r\n\r\nI suppose just to
    balance that impression, I should mention they also do a number of art books for
    Yale University Press. It is easier to have a business if you have a mix of services.\r\n\r\nSomething
    to consider. & here's another one I know of\r\n\r\nhttp://www.kachergisbookdesign.com/"
