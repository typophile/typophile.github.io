body: "Hi all,\r\n\r\nCan anyone help identify this font? I can't seem to track it
  down.\r\n\r\nAnd while we're at it. Is there any way to get an IP address removed
  from the block list? When I attempt to post from work (which goes through a US proxy
  server\u2014I'm in Canada), I can't do it. But it's usually where I need the font
  identification done. I've written the site, but get no response. \r\n\r\nThanks!

    think you can easily find somebody to respond to your request.\r\nI have also
    send a message the other day to ask about the spam amount on the site, and received
    no answer.\r\nI feel that Typophile is running in the auto pilot at the moment,
    no moderators, no admins, nothing.\r\n"

    the rabid increase of spam threads slipping thru the filters I have the option
    to Unpublish an entire thread but nothing happens when I click on the button.
    Irksome to be sure, I only hope that they (whoever owns this site) are working
    hard to complete the code allowing me to do what I do.\r\n\r\nAs for the unanswered
    IP requests I hope they are resolved sooner rather than later."

  body: "Hi Neil,\r\nand thank you for your response.\r\nRegarding the spam mess:
    Sometimes a simple (but not so commonly used) method is more effective that a
    fancy (captcha etc) one. A simple question on user registration form like \"Five
    and two equals: X\" may result in a very good protection, even if the numbers
    are constant and not changing ;)\r\nThe reason for that is the spammers usually
    use automated tools which cannot parse generic questions, especially if the question
    is displayed as an image.\r\nEven if you can't implement the solution, I hope
    that you can forward this option to the admins/owners. \r\n\r\nFivos"

    Gill Sans), but it accepts any input, so the spambots simply fill every text field

  body: "Ricardo I can't believe that a bot can guess \"Eric Gill\" by trying random
    words.\r\nIf you check your profile, the correct answer (\"Eric Gill\") is public:\r\nhttp://typophile.com/user/46071\r\nMaybe
    this is the reason (some) bots get-in very easily?\r\nMaybe they try the words
    are seeing on other users' profiles.\r\n\r\nAnother trick: Introducing a reasonable
    delay of e.g. 5 secs after any failed registration attempt, it would greatly reduce
    the success rate of any bot trying to get in with brute force attempts (random
    strings, etc)."

    bots: I'm admin in various forums and there are many bots that pass the email
    confirmation check. If you need absolute spam control the only solution is to
    have the moderators manually check and confirm any new registration.\r\n"
