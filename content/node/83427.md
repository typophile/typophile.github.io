  body: "I like it, visually (I cannot judge on Arabic writing).\r\nMaybe you could
    leave a bit less white space inside the circle.\r\nAlso, I see that it would be
    an interesting challenge to modify it so it could be read as m or mh (or hm) too
    (maybe rotating it)."

    why not have a slightly more explicit hint of Arabic in there?\r\nMake only the
    leftmost stem of the \"m\" descend, making it like a \"meem\"!\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
