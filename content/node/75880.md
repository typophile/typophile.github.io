  what this font is. I've seen it a couple books now and can't seem to figure out
  what it is.\r\n\r\nHere's a link to the book and you can look inside it here if
  you need more pages: \r\n\r\n[[http://www.amazon.com/Pretty-Little-Liars-2-Flawless/dp/0060887354/ref=sr_1_6?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1288731243&sr=1-6|Click

    (the nicest Garamond cut in my opinion).

  body: "Thanks Freiberger!\r\n\r\nOut of curiosity - what clues let you know it is
    Berthold vs say Adobe Garamond Pro?\r\n\r\nAlso - I think I have this in my font
    library. I assume Garamond BQ is the same (at least for my text purposes)?\r\n\r\n"

  body: The numbers. Berthold's are more regular and very beautiful. Its italic is
    also less calligraphic and better to read. I think Garamond BQ is the same font
    (it was included in Adobe FontFolio up to 1997).
