body: 'Colleagues,  <BR> <BR>I just successfully used British Library&#39;s secure
  electronic delivery document service to get a copy of Maxim Zhukov&#39;s article
  &#34;The peculiarities of Cyrillic letterforms&#34;. The article came in secure
  PDF format per e-mail, 5 days after I ordered it. It cost me approx. 20 USD altogether,
  which included a copyright fee. The quality of the scan isn&#39;t amazing but is
  adequate. And the speed really was impressive!  <BR> <BR>Excellent service indeed!

  body: I doubt any single cent. But if Typography Papers issue 1 were ever reprinted,
    I doubt Maxim would get additional renumeration.  <BR> <BR>Actually, it ended
    up being a bit more than $20. Precisely speaking, it was 15 GBP. That included
    a 5 GBP &#34;copyright fee&#34; and a 10 GBP handling fee. I don&#39;t know what
    the British Library does with the 5 GBP copyright fee but my guess is that it
    goes to the collective copyright organizations.  <BR> <BR>Anyway, since this electronic
    document delivery mechanism is offered by the British Library, I presume that
    it&#39;s legal and OK with the copyright. If anybody doesn&#39;t like the UK copyright
    system, he&#39;s free to submit a petition to the British parliament <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"
    ALT=":-&#41;" BORDER=0>  <BR> <BR>But I doubt it would ever be changed. The libraries
    in most European countries allow copying of articles and even entire books --
    but it&#39;s usually a paid and not very cheap service. In German copyright law,
    sharing single copies with people I know is also legal &#40;an equivalent of the
    &#34;fair use&#34;&#41;.  <BR> <BR>No matter how loud an author may cry -- if
    something is published, the author does not have absolute and complete control
    over all copies of his work. Continental copyright provides very strong protection
    but also provides a balance between the consumer&#39;s and the author&#39;s rights.
    The service of the British Library seems to fit into this balance. It&#39;s comparatively
    expensive &#40;a few pages per BL delivery costs as much as the entire copy of
    the publication in print&#41; but for out-of-print publications such as the Typography
    Papers issue 1, services like that are often the only way to get a copy.  <BR>

    and Adam, I much appreciate your caring about me. It is a fact though, that for
    my piece in <i>Typography Papers 1</i> I was not paid. But I have no problem with
    that. In fact, I feel proud that my essay had been included in the first issue
    of this truly remarkable series. I am a big fan, and a devoted reader, of <i>Typography
    Papers</i>.'

  body: Thanks for the explanation. I&#39;m sure it&#39;s all legal, but It would
    be wonderful if out-of-print type development related material could be made available
    in a way that compensated the authors and original publishers directly.  <BR>
    <BR>Cheers, Si

  body: That would sure make sense. I wonder if the publisher of the series, Reading
    University Press, would be interested in distributing such out-of-print-but-still-in-demand
    materials. Hope they would not lose money on that. And, inshallah, they could
    distribute better-quality PDFs

  body: Given the short print runs on most design books in general and all typography
    books in particular, I&#39;ve often wondered if there was a valid business model
    to re-print these titles.

  body: As I have said in the other thread on Maxim&#39;s article, TP1 was typeset
    in 95 on a conventional film-based workflow. To produce PDF deliverables from
    ten-year old source files is not trivial. We are a small Department and all [overworked]
    staff have substantial commitments, so this is not the highest priority. I am
    sure there may be ways to resource and manage such a project, but I can&#39;t
    see anybody&#39;s agenda lightening significantly in the next couple of years.
    I agree wholeheartedly it would be beneficial to a good number of people, and
    I would like nothing more than contributors to make some money out of their IP,
    but I just don&#39;t see it happening anytime soon for the early TP content. <BR>
    <BR>I&#39;f it&#39;s any consolation, later issues have been produced on a CTP-based
    PDF workflow.

  body: 'What about brute-forcing it with hi-res scanning? Plus there&#39;s always
    OCR. And you could still make a PDF, and even put it on CD&#42; and sell it. And
    if you&#39;re short of manpower to do that, you could outsource the job &#40;maybe
    even including [one-off] replication and delivery&#41;, and give a cut of the
    sales as payment, maybe with a small upfront payment too and/or a free perpetual
    subscription, hopefully including back issues... &#40;Yes, this <i>is</i> all
    a big, fat hint. :-&#41; <BR> <BR>&#42; BTW, I recently got a nice gift: a CD
    of the book &#34;Front Page&#34; &#40;a collection of LA Times front pages spanning
    1881-2003&#41;, which is basically a 262Mb PDF of scans, but it also includes
    [the visible part of] one article from each cover as a actual text. All with a
    simple VB interface - nicely done. <BR> <BR>hhp'
