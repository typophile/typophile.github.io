		<div class="commentbody">Rene, the type of artwork most commonly associated with Scandinavian culture &ndash; at least in the U.S. &ndash; is <a href="http://www.rosemaling.com/">rosemaling</a>. These are brightly colored floral patterns, typically hand-painted by amateurs onto wood (furniture mostly). <BR> <BR>Stephen's example, while not rosemaling, is definitely a good one as well and might be a better source of dingbat inspiration. Good luck! <BR> <BR>By the way, I really like your font. <BR> <BR>Stephen: did you buy a new pair of boxers in Sweden or something? :-)</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Hi Gerald,  <BR> <BR>Thanx for your input. I've also asked my ex, she's Finnish, and also said the Norwegan flower ornaments would be to much. They don't mean anything to her, she said. She herself suggested something from the Vikings. That was my first thought also, but I realised too that it could be too prototype. She also suggested using the ear-marking of the raindeer, but that's a little too abstract for me: <BR><a href="http://tuikku.urova.fi/avoin/poronhoito/merkitys.htm" target="_blank"><a href="http://tuikku.urova.fi/avoin/poronhoito/merkitys.htm">http://tuikku.urova.fi/avoin/poronhoito/merkitys.htm</a></a> <BR>That's an alfabet for it self, but not enough decorative. <BR> <BR>Personally I liked the birds under the trees on your site. Something like that would be great. If you have more suggestions, I have time. <BR> <BR>I've been in Finland once and it was great. My ex's parents live in Rovaniemi, very close to the north pole as I could feel. Perhaps I visit Finland again. I liked it a lot. I'll also visit the 'Santa Pukki' again (is that spelled correctly?). <BR>Who did invent the sauna by the way? ;-) <BR> <BR>Love your way of working with ornaments, by the way.  <BR> <BR>Regards, <BR>Ren</div>

		<div class="commentbody">That's interesting that rosemaling isn't really &quot;authentic&quot; Scandinavian art anymore. <BR> <BR>Most of the Scandinavian immigrants came to my state of Minnesota in the late 19th and very early 20th Centuries, and they brought it with. It was a very &quot;Swedish grandma&quot; thing to do. But if you were to ask a typical Minnesota Scandahoovian, they'd swear up and down it was the real deal.

		<div class="commentbody">Dan, <BR> <BR>That certainly is interesting. I wonder if there are any copies to be had. Thank you for the tip. As you know I am writing a book about ornaments, typographical and otherwise. My present focus, at the moment, is on traditional source readily available to me in Scandinavia. <BR> <BR>My working title is &quot;Ornament and Function.&quot; This is based on some of my original thoughts. <a href="http://www.lanstontype.com/FishBasket.html" target="_blank"><a href="http://www.lanstontype.com/FishBasket.html">http://www.lanstontype.com/FishBasket.html</a></a> <BR> <BR> <BR>The reason I asked about knitting: Knitting clearly illustrates my point about the subtle aspects of ornament. Also illustrates ornament as function, and the structure of mans' day to day activities. See second link. <BR> <BR><a href="http://www.lanstontype.com/SpiderWeb.html" target="_blank"><a href="http://www.lanstontype.com/SpiderWeb.html">http://www.lanstontype.com/SpiderWeb.html</a></a> <BR> <BR>Ornament is not necessarily just &quot;icing on a cake.&quot; Pretty little things tied on like a woman's bonnet, or masking an otherwise ugly face with lipstick. <i>Mind you, that has useful function too.</i> <BR> <BR>That ornaments have strong purpose, that they have served man and nature profoundly well. They do not deserved to become orphaned ancestors. They are building blocks of society, building blocks of nature. <BR> <BR>That is why I am so delighted Ren</div>

		<div class="commentbody">The 'Latinisation' of Futhark mainly involved extension and re-ordering of the sign set to match the set of Latin graphemes, so one could write Futhark as a one-to-one transliteration of contemporary spelling. An interesting aspect of this is the addition of dots to create new consonants. All in all, this 'Latinised' Futhark doesn't <i>look</i> very Latin. One could argue that the changes to Futhark kept it alive as part of the culture for 600+ years after it ceased to be used to regularly write a living language.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">John's right. I re-read my earlier posts and I wasn't specific enough, the 'latinisation' was of the sounds, not the letterforms. <BR>Futhark was used to write latin texts too. <BR> <BR>Part of what kept Futhark alive was also the occult use of runes. It's important that the language didn't die, only the writing system. <BR> <BR>Hrant, the wood carving was in the &quot;Early Swedish Sans&quot; thread somewhere. <BR> <BR>BTW those ear-marks are interesting, has anyone got info on them in English?</div>
