  now and we have decided moving somewhere in Europe would be ideal. He was born in
  Greece and speaks the language and has a lot of cultural ties there still so really
  wants to move back to Athens. I was born in Canada and my Greek is not -that- good
  and although this wouldn't be happening for at least another year and I would have
  time to work on it, is there really any chance of finding work in the design industry
  there if I don't speak the language fluently? Is it like that all over Europe? \r\n\r\nMy
  partner and I both work as Art Directors in interactive departments of advertising
  agencies.\r\n\r\nI know there are a lot of European designers here who could maybe
  provide some insights for me. I really don't want to move to London."

    beaches. And although I do have a German last name, I don't speak any German.
    But it's an amazing city for sure.

    what about Barcelona? It's a major design town -- or so I've been told (by classmates
    and colleagues who've been there). On the downside, you would probably need to
    learn Spanish <em>and</em> Catalan to live and work there."

    Not nearly as modern as Berlin but pleny hooked up.\r\n\r\nThere's lots of large
    companies so I'm sure there's pleny of work. The local joke is that the Germans
    own all of them.\r\n\r\nThe language seemed completely foreign to me. I have been
    in most of western Europe and there were almost always parts of the language I
    could understand but not there, or Scandinavia. The written language seems like
    it would definitely take some time.\r\n\r\nI don't know exactly what you do but
    my job requires idiomatic knowledge of language, that's one of the hardest things
    to aquire and it takes the longest.\r\n\r\nMy friends from Berlin all want to
    leave now. They say it's getting a lot more stressful living there. It's a shame.\r\n\r\nAll

    know people who've been here for decades and still don't/won't speak the language.
    Houses are good and warm, infrastructure ok, air pretty clean and lots of nature
    around, even beaches. Downside is the climate, at the moment it's snowing and
    we won't see much sun for a few months from now. Summers are nice. As for swimming
    \u2013 my local beach offers a nice maintaned hole in the ice during the Winter
    months, so it's possible to swim in the sea around the year...\r\n\r\nActually,
    I suppose it's not that different to Toronto, except it's in Europe, there's the
    sea and people speak strange languages.\r\n\r\nI lived in Munich for a year, and
    it was lovely. I was there only as a Hausfrau, it wouldn't have been possible
    to get a design job with my poor German skills. A Central European location is
    a good idea, if you want to visit other countries easily. From Munich we wisited

    it never is anyway, to start a new life from scratch in a country you don't know.
    before thet i have been living 10 years in new york, 1 year in tokyo and 4 years
    in paris, but this was very different. it takes time to get fully used to this
    city, about 6 month. after that, its really very nice. to obtain a visa is very
    tricky and long, depending on your country: for french people, for example, you
    have to ask the working visa before you actually go and work there; that's really
    boring. i dont know for other countries, but french citizens can go and stay in
    turkey without any visa for 90 consecutive days, which is a blessing: you can
    go hunt for jobs, eventually find one, and ask the company's lawyers to get your
    visa (as in the USA), making things much faster done. job hunting is not very
    hard: just buy the newspaper hurriyet on sundays, that's where 95% of the ads
    are posted. you also might try a spontaneous job request by contacting the agencies
    here, there is a crazy amount of advertising / graphic design companies, both
    local or international. in 70% of the time, their creative directors or top art
    directors are foreigners. if your portfolio is good, they will call you, believe
    me. 3 major companies called me in the week following my emailing, 3 years ago,
    and it is still true today.\r\n\r\nand to finish with the turkish language...
    i'm ashamed to say that my turkish sucks, still now. i can chat, order food, talk
    about graphic design specifics... but that's pretty thin. i am even married to
    a turkish girl, but we speak english and she is learning french... so, dont be
    too much afraid: language is not too much of a problem (until you get in a taxi
    of course).\r\n\r\ndavid r"

    times in Germany, I was living near Frankfurt. It is possible to get work in Europe
    without speaking the native language, but you integrate so much better & so much
    faster if you do learn it, and quickly. I love Berlin, but the job market there
    is rubbish, and the salaries low. From what I hear, designers make more there
    than in Athens, though, if that is consoling. Lots of people seem to like moving
    to the Netherlands. I think its cities must be quite cosmopolitan, and depending
    on what you are looking for, pleasant."
