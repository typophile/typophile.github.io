body: "Hi, I have a number of questions relating to my build of a font. There seems
  to be many ways for me to achieve a similar final outcome and I need some advice
  on the best way forward.\r\n\r\nThe display font has no descenders or  ascenders,
  however some glyphs are based on the forms of l/c letters. For this reason it could
  be called Unicase, however there will be no Caps version of these 'scaled up l/c
  glyphs' and vice versa.\r\n\r\nFirst of all, I would like the font to display in
  the same way, regardless of whether the user is working in upper or lowercase -
  is there a way to achieve this other than repeating the glyphs in both u/c and l/c
  positions on the key map?\r\n\r\nSecondly, each letter has between 0 and 6 alternate
  glyphs which I would like to activate through OT functions, however I'm not sure
  which ones. They could be done as Contextual Alternates, Contextual Ligatures, Discretionary
  Ligatures or Stylistic sets. Some of the substitutions relate to 'serifs' not overlapping,
  whereas some are purely aesthetic options. The font will initially only be used
  inhouse in AI and ID CS3 on Macs, so perhaps the easiest solution is best for now.\r\n\r\nAny
  help is greatly appreciated."

    be great in the long term, ligatures of any sort would be a nightmare to use right
    now due the the huge number I would need to create.\r\n\r\nI created some of the
    alternates as Stylistic Sets which works fine in ID but do not seem directly accessible
    in AI. I guess I could live with them being accessible through the 'glyphs' window.\r\n\r\nAnyone
    know another way?"
