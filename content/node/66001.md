  Sans meets serif.]]</b>\r\n\r\nYou would like to express tradition by using a contemporary
  font? Sintesi might be exactly what you are looking for.\r\n\r\nSintesi stands for
  synthesis: the unification of serif and sans-serif into a contemporary font, which
  surprises with different facets depending on its application.\r\nIn copy size Sintesi
  performs like a sans-serif. It is a compact and well readable font that fulfills
  all requirements of modern digital media.\r\n\r\nIn larger sizes, Sintesi unfolds
  its traditional character. Now, its strong contrast and the perceptible feather-ductus
  stand out clearly, as we appreciate it in a historical old style face.\r\n\r\nSintesi
  is completed by a suitable italic. Its cursive character has more to do with writing-speed
  than to moderate inclination. Therefore Sintesi may be well-suited for many other
  purposes, not only for emphasis.\r\n\r\nThe whole font family consists of 20 styles
  and offers a wide range of Western and Eastern European special characters, typographical
  ligatures, uppercase, oldstyle and fraction figures.\r\n\r\nStart combining antiquity
  with modernity!\r\n\r\nDownload a free trial version of Sintesi with a reduced character
  set. [[http://www.sintesi.ch|Check it out!]]"
