  body: "Answering on '2PACALYPSE' piece (thought like Don it could have been 'FEAR
    OF A BLACK PLANET' which probably set with [[http://www.myfonts.com/search/antique+olive|Antique
    Olive]] BTW). For the rest, at this size, the 2 /A look different to me so I'd
    say \"not-a-font/hand-done\". Even if that sounds clich\xE9, I'd probably have
    a look to some fonts tagged at MyFonts '[[http://www.myfonts.com/tags/graffiti|graffiti]]',
    '[[http://www.myfonts.com/tags/tag|tag]]' or '[[http://www.myfonts.com/tags/hip+hop|hip
    hop]]'. DaFont [[http://www.dafont.com/theme.php?cat=606|Graffiti section]] is
    also worth a look. This lettering has also a '[[http://www.myfonts.com/search/comic|comic]]'
    feeling so maybe having a look to [[http://www.myfonts.com/foundry/Blambot|Blambot]],
    [[http://www.myfonts.com/foundry/Comicraft|Comicraft]], [[http://www.myfonts.com/foundry/Canada_Type|Canada
    Type]] and (My)Fonts tagged '[[http://www.myfonts.com/search/tag%3Acomic|comic]]'
    would be useful too. Finally, I would also browse [[http://www.myfonts.com/foundry/Typodermic|Typodermic]]
    and [[http://www.myfonts.com/foundry/PizzaDude.dk|Pizzadude]] collections.\r\nFollowing
    these tracks and without too much effort, I've found [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/pizzadude/show-no-shame|Show
    No Shame]], a Pizzadude font which looks not so far with its arced /A \"\xE0-la-[[http://www.myfonts.com/search/hobo|Hobo]]\"."

  body: "Missed the reverse contrast, but Ryuk did not. so Antique Olive is clsoer
    than Futura.\r\nAs for 2pacalypse you might find a substitute you like at Creative
