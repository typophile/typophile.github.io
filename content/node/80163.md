body: "In connected script fonts, the transition between characters is often an issue:\r\n<img
  src=http://updo.nl/file/ee197a29.png>\r\nI got the idea to solve this by slicing
  every character in half, vertically, and connecting the second part of every character
  with the first part of every character, thus forming pairs for every transition:\r\n<img
  src=http://updo.nl/file/212529b2.png>\r\nThis example now consists out of the pairs
  /_h/, /ha/, /al/, /lf/ and /f_/\r\nThis way, any two characters can be used subsequently
  without interrupting the flow.\r\n\r\nUsing this method, a font would consist out
  of roughly 26*26=676 \"characters\" or pairs. This may seem a lot, but if we assume
  that every transition between any 2 letters is unique, fixing the issue on character-level
  would take way more different characters\r\n(every letter has 26 (or 27 including
  blank space) possible predecessors and 26 possible successors, resulting in roughly
  26^3=17576 characters).\r\n\r\nOf course, not every transition is unique in a connected
  script font and splitting a font up in pairs of characters instead of the actual
  characters may seem a bit superfluous in most cases, but it would also make for
  some interesting design possibilities.\r\n\r\nI would very much like to hear your
  opinion on this.\r\n\r\n(Also, first post. Hi!)"

    surprisingly, as it must have been almost impossible to compose with accurately
    or with any speed.\r\n\r\nIt's redundant now, with the ability of the contextual
    features in OpenType to mimic the joining rules of traditional cursive calligraphy.\r\n\r\nIn
    fact , that was the origin of the Contextual Alternates feature, in Robert Slimbach's
    Sanvito, in which Adobe automated the alternates which previously existed (but
    had to be annually applied), in conjunction with the development of OpenType support
    in InDesign."

  body: "I experimented with a similar idea some years ago, except with the variation
    that each glyph was a half letter, not a connection between two letters, based
    on the reasoning that the form of letters varied less than the connections between
    them. Hence it would be possible to minimise the size of the glyph set because
    rather than needing an individual contextual glyph for each letter with each class
    of join on the left and each class of join on the right, you would only need half
    letters for each join class. So, for instance, lets say for a given letter there
    were 3 ways in which it could join on the left to a preceding letter and 4 ways
    it could join on the right to a following letter, plus one non-joining shape left
    and right, that would require 20 variant glyphs for a full letter approach, but
    only 9 for a half letter approach.\r\n\r\nTom Milo goes one step further with
    this Arabic fonts, decomposing each letter into strokes and re-using stroke glyphs
    in a modular way to create multiple letters."

  body: 'Blue Island create the visual impression of individual letters being made
    up of strokes connected from other letters, but it is made in a conventional way,
    with each letter being represented by an individual if eccentric glyph. It is
    a very clever piece of design work, but technically it isn''t any different from
    a typical font. It is really the opposite of the idea expressed in this thread:
    precomposed glyphs that look decomposed in use, not decomposed glyphs that look
    precomposed in use.'

    it is quite possible.\r\nIt might be quite tricky to twist your head around.\r\n\r\nI
    think it might have some merit for conceptualizing extremely \"organic\" handrwiting,
    but not for traditional calligraphic styles which are already formalized in joining
    rules that translate well into the Contextual Alternates feature \u2014 after
    all, that is what the feature was invented for.\r\n\r\nI think you should give
    it a try, starting with a formalized chancery script, to get the gist of the process."
