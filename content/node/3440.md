  font is based off of the continuity and connectedness of Celtic knotwork.   This
  is a rough draft, still in the works.  I would like to recieve some feedback.  I
  am trying to think up a name.  Maybe interlacing? Any ideas?  '

  body: I really like this idea. It looks promising. <BR> <BR>Here is my crit- The
    base of your font&#39;s shape &amp; our clue as to the identioty of a glyph is
    alluded to with the curves &amp; then knot or celticness goes over that often
    ending in very modern square edges.&#40; why monospaced?, why modern shapes as
    a base?&#41; This technique adds a consistancy &amp; tension to the font which
    is fun - but in some characters not enough consideration is given to the form
    to be evoked &amp; the glyph gets bogged down by an extreme regularity. The K
    is like that. VW &amp; X are not. The zero,Q and the &#39;&amp;&#39; are like
    that. The H is not. Q is a great glyph to venture beyond basic rules. Really it&#39;s
    the charcters where you venture from your base idea &amp; do something beyond
    it which work best to me.  <BR> <BR>One other idea - what about making the thread
    vary in width here &amp; there to give emphasis? I have seen celtic art that used
    that to great effect.

  body: I created the monospaced letters because when I was creating it and putting
    the letters into sentences, I enjoyed the interweavings that were created not
    only in the letters, but also within the words. See the example below. <BR> <BR>I
    tried to keep the knotwork relatively true to traditional forms, specifically
    in the sharp edged corners where it applied to. This is also why the cord width
    in the letters is regular. I also wanted to create the letters forms out of the
    cord instead of using the cord to fill in the letter forms, although  I do like
    the effect that it gives to letters when it is used. <BR> <BR>I am looking for
    new ways to try to do the &amp;, with the letter having the over and under pattern
    to begin with, it is hard to work the over and under pattern of the celtic knotwork
    into the &amp;.  I am also looking into creating different forms for some of the
    other letters that are not as successful as others.  <BR> <BR>Thank you for the
    input, and keep it coming! <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/28821.jpg"

    I&#39;d like to see more complex and tightly-woven forms.

  body: 'This is a very interesting concept, Lisa!  <BR> <BR>One thing I have trouble
    with is differentiating &#34;B&#34; and &#34;8&#34;... And also, I think that
    perhaps the crossbars in those two characters would benefit from intertwining
    on both ends instead of just one...  <BR> <BR>I have a similar issue with the
    zero figure: perhaps the diagonal bar should be one long cord rather than two
    short ones that almost touch in the middle..., or, as an alternative, keep the
    two cords, but have them tightly intertwined, like in your &#34;H&#34; character&#39;s
    crossbar. <BR> <BR>Looking forward to seeing more of this, <BR>Ricardo'
