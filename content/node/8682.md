    font as Win TrueType.  <BR> <BR>Or are you looking for something more specific?
    If so, please tell us what you have in mind, what system you work on, which tools
    you have.  <BR> <BR>Regards,  <BR>Adam'

  body: Hi Adam <BR> <BR>I am using FontLab on a Mac. I have a set of 10 symbols I
    want to add to my font. To make things easy I would place these symbols on existing
    characters but the problem is that there are no open spaces left &#40;the font
    is completely Unicode&#41;. <BR> <BR>What&#39;s the best way to add these symbols?
    <BR> <BR>Thanks.

    symbols that you are planning to add are similar to those encoded, use the existing
    assigned codepoints. If you want to add symbols that are not similar to any of
    the encoded symbols, you should encode them in the Private Use Area, where you
    can freely assign the codepoints:  <BR><a href="http://www.unicode.org/charts/PDF/UE000.pdf"

  body: Thanks a lot Adam, I&#39;m figuring it out! <BR> <BR>The only problem I&#39;m
    still experiencing is how to &#34;call&#34; a special character on a Mac. On PC
    I can simply insert the unicode while holding down the alt-key..

    characters on a Mac. Go to System Preferences: International, choose the Input
    Menu pane and check the Character Palette box. Then you can &#39;Show Character
    Palette&#39; from the little keyboard menu on the right of the menu bar. If you
    pull the palette&#39;s View menu down to Unicode, you can browse the entire unicode
    space. Double-click on a character to &#39;type&#39; it. <BR> <BR>&#40;Of course
    this will only work if the app you&#39;re using is vaguely Unicode-savvy. Works
    well in TextEdit, for example.&#41;'
