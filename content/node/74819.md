body: "Okay, so since the Spider-Man movies use T-26 fonts almost exclusively (for
  example Mata, Delux, etc.) that is where I assume this font comes from. It is only
  used in the first Spider-Man film. Now, I would try to find it myself, but I have
  not the means or the time at present to go through their website (my connection
  is very slow). So, if anyone can help me out with the name of this font, it will
  be very much appreciated.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Spider-Man-end-credits_4419.gif]"
