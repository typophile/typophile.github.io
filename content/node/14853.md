body: "This is a familiar font, the closest thing I have is 'royalacid' based on the
  masthead font from Rollingstone magazine. Can someone help identify it for me? It
  reminds me of all the sweet TV shows I watched as a kid like \"Hart to Hart\". Who
  can forget Mrs. H, she really was Gorgeous.\r\n\r\nFunnily enough there is another
  version of this album cover widely released which has really poor typography. Not
  sure why?\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\nDom"

  body: Actually, while the lowercase are all ITC Bookman, the caps and cap/lowercase
    ligatures are from the old pre-ITC Bookman Bold Italic.
