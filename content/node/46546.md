    but the n foot serif is wrong, and the r is not quite the right shape. The n is
    like Beton, but Beton has many other differences.\r\n\r\nBTW, 'Staring' is a funny
    typo here.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: Thanks for your input Mike. I'm pretty sure I've seen that font somewhere
    but can't recall where... I hope somebody else will give me a clue on which type
    is that!!
