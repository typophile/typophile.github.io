body: "Just curious---on the forum page there's that list of top ten posters. Typically
  you'd need to be averaging close to 5 posts a day, sometimes more, to crack the
  list. Earlier today I noticed number 10 had just 23 posts in the last 10 days---lowest
  I've ever seen it since I began hanging around these forums a few months ago. At
  this rate, I'll eventually crack the top ten by virtue of the list sliding down
  until it hits me (I think I average maybe one post a day).\r\n\r\nAre a lot of typophiles
  on holidays, are just too busy with projects that they don't have time to post?"

    people who post once each, that would equal in lots of posts. ;)\r\n\r\nNaw...
    I guess it also depends on what kind of threads are active; what kind of discussions
    and subjects, etc."
