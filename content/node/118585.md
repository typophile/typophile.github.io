body: I've saved a while back this image off the internet but I don't remember from
  where, or what it is and by who. I was wondering if anyone knew anything about the
  history if these letters. Thanks in advance

  body: "I found these in one of my books (\"Initials and Decorative Alphabets,\"
    Erhardt D. Stiebner and Dieter Urban, Blandford Press, 1985). It's an English
    translation of the German \"Initialen und Bildbuchstaben,\" 1983.\r\n\r\nIt appears
    on page 172, and is described as \"After Renaissance original, Silvestre, 19th
    cn.\" The image it accompanies is the same as shown in your sample \"Typography.jpg,\"
    but reversed (white on black) as in your \"Sample.jpg.\" \r\n\r\nMore information
    about Silvestre here (as well as a cropped sample of this alphabet):\r\nhttp://www.johncoulthart.com/feuilleton/2011/09/07/joseph-balthazar-silvestres-alphabet-album/"

  body: "Good find Kevin.\r\nThe original has a fascinating amount of nuanced detail.
    Here is a slightly enhanced copy\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/SilvestreAlphabetAlbum91_5809.jpg]\r\nBTW
    the black and white rendition posted for ID is a good quality adaptation and catches
    a substantial part of the detailing. \r\nIt would be a real challenge to capture
    this in a digital font. There would have to be some drastic simplification of
    the engraved sphere like circles to make them work for the upper case and they
    might not even be feasible for the lower case.\r\nDon"

  body: "Hi Mike, a harp is as good a guess as any. \r\nAll we know about this alphabet
    is that it's an Italian lapidary alphabet from the 15th century.\r\nFrom the shading,
    the circles appear to be spheres on strings, ropes or pipes.\r\nWhy spheres? Musical,
    astrological, astronomical, heraldic, cannon balls?\r\nIs this supposed to represent
    armor laced together, plumbing, something architectural?\r\nA lapidary alphabet
    was intended to be engraved. This might have been used on something metal, a platter,
    a bronze door etc. Religious, scientific, military?\r\nLast guess: knobs on a
    pipe organ.\r\nA true mystery alphabet.\r\nDon"
