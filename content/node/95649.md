  or fashion fonts such as 'Didot' or 'Monotype Modern'?\r\n\r\nAlso does anyone know
  a resource, where I can find out which arabic fonts are supported by which browsers?
  (web safe etc.) \r\n\r\nThanks, \r\ncian\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    overview from Sylvia Egger]] provides a good overview of the major services and
    which languages are supported.\r\n\r\nMonotype's web fonts service includes a
    significant number of Arabic fonts in different styles and would be worth checking
    out."

  body: "OK thanks Hrant \u2013 I don't really want to be disrespectful. I guess what
    I'm really looking for is good classic arabic headline/display typeface... something
    that would look good for editorial headlines.\r\n\r\nKarl \u2013thanks I've been
    looking here:\r\nhttp://webfonts.fonts.com/en-US/Project/ChooseFonts?Languages=W44#languages%3DW20%26page%3D1\r\n\r\nI
    found 'Jalal' and 'mitra' to look good... any thought on these or others?\r\n\r\n"

    and also investigate Typotheque's webfont service, which might simplify the technical
    challenges.
