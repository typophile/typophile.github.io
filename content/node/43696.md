body: "Hi,\r\n\r\nI would like to do a handwriting signature for a DVD cover (TIFF
  300 dpi).\r\n\r\nMy cover is in Photoshop. Black background. I used the \"sharp\"
  setting for my fonts (mainly Eurostile)\r\n\r\nI need to do the handwriting in white
  on black.\r\n\r\nI had some info in this thread: http://www.typophile.com/node/20954,
  about Illustrator, Live trace, Photoshop etc.\r\n\r\nBut I`m still confused...\r\n\r\nWhat
  will be the best way to do this? Can I do it by hand straight into photoshop or
  Illustrator? Hand tracing, scan / Livetrace, Pen tool?\r\n\r\nI never used illustrator
  before but I can try. I use Photoshop usually.\r\n\r\nMany thanks.\r\n"

    sharpness, unsharp mask etc until it looks good. You might want to turn it grayscale.
    In other words, I wouldn't trace it, I'd use it as a picture.\r\nAnd since it's
    supposed to be white, just inverse it."
