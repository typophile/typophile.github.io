body: "I am designing a war history book in two columnns 90 mm, 10,5 on 12,75 Sabon.
  As a complementary sans i have FF Nexus, for captions and extra text in 3 colum
  setting, 10 on 12,75 pt.\r\n   \r\nI would be thankful for spontaneous reactions
  to the combination, is it ok, good or terrible? :)\r\n   \r\nSuggestions on changing
  the text font? ( I'm rather not changing Nexus!)"

  body: Since you're using FF Nexus Sans, why not <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/fontfont/ff_nexus_serif_ot/">FF
    Nexus Serif</a> for text?

    Nothing wrong with asking for an opinion.

  body: Syntax's design was inspired by Sabon's letter proportions. So those two work
    together as well.
