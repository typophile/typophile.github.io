		<div class="commentbody">"I’ve come to the conclusion that Chrome is really a stripped down version of FF."

Well, it's based on WebKit, so it's more related to Safari than Firefox.

Google has been (and will continue to be) a major financier of Firefox, so it's an odd decision on their part. The theory that makes the most sense to me is that Google Apps depends heavily on JavaScript and the current crop of browsers just suck at that, so they thought the easiest solution would be to just write their own browser.

Chrome, for the most part, is Google's Operating system for Google applications. If you are an avid user of Gmail, Google docs, Google sites, Google calendar, Google reader, Google etc, then Chrome is the browser for you.

If not, there's probably not a really strong reason to bother with it at this point.

"It runs rings around Firefox and IE, both of which will probably slip into decline as a result."

It'll probably chip away at Firefox's share, but probably won't have much effect on IE. Anyone that uses IE isn't the kind of user that's even aware that the web browser is actually a piece of software that they can choose alternative for.

"What ads? I’m not getting any ads in Chrome."

That wasn't me that mentioned the ads. I just thought it was a funny comment (google makes money via web ads).</div>

I don't mind static ads but I simply can't stand it when anything moves while I am reading the news or so.
So, no flash blocker, no Chrome for me. Unfortunately. I will give it another try as soon as there is a flash blocker available.
Also, as [[http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20080904/ap_on_hi_te/tec_tech_test_google_chrome|this article]] points out, flash often uses more resources that you could ever save with Chrome.</div>

@Darrel: <em>Anyone that uses IE isn’t the kind of user that’s even aware that the web browser is actually a piece of software that they can choose alternative for.</em>

I've been an IE user from the very beginning of the popular internet, and I've been trrying all kinds of browsers ever since, yet I always went back to IE because it works well enuff.

Tim, guys, peeples, Chrome doesn't have an ad blocker because it doesn't need one. The ad blocking is built into the thing, which is why you don't have an option to turn ad blocking on or off. Ads are blocked permanently. I'm not getting any ads where I don't want them in Chrome. The proof is in the pudding. Don't assume Google are going to the use the same software and interface model as IE, Firefox and all the others, because Google are well-known for their intuitive approach to software and application design.

I mean, I'm a gmail user, and I wouldn't even consider going back to any other kind of email client, especially not a stand-alone desktop-based proggie like Outlook and its ilk, because gmail is so intuitive and simply anticipates what people need it to do automatically. compared to gmail, I would describe Outlook as a hopeless, outmoded, time-wasting, unintuitve, stupid, badly-constructed, over-complicated piece of junk.

Oh! Sorry, I thought you were joking.

If they add it, it'd be interesting, but given that Google's primary income comes from web ads, I find it hard to believe they will put too much effort into allowing you to block them using their own browser. ;o)

That said, Chrome is open source, so give it a week and I'm sure someone will have a solution.

"I’ve been an IE user from the very beginning of the popular internet, and I’ve been trrying all kinds of browsers ever since, yet I always went back to IE because it works well enuff."

Sure. That's kind of my point. Anyone that's fine using IE probably has no incentive to bother using anything else. </div>

		<div class="commentbody">Nope, not joking. I'd say I'm a proponent for free internet. It's becoming a life blood for so many organizations and communities (ahem, Typophiles), that to not have internet access is almost a crime. 

But, I don't have free internet. I have to pay for it, like most other people. However, I'm also subjected to a constant stream of advertisements... I feel the same with television. You have to pay for the service (if you have anything more than an antenna, which will eventually be gone soon too) and yet you're forced to watch commercials ad nauseam. 

So, I would prefer to have a program that can atleast filter out a large chunk of that noise and leave the more important features available. 

There are many arguments for and against, and I'm aware of that. It's just, I'd prefer to have a choice in the matter. Right now, Google isn't giving me that choice. 

They might be open source, but until they allow plug-ins/add-ons that support my choices, I'm not jumping on board. 

I prefer FF over IE because it's a forward moving application. They're trying to be open to all features of the web. IE makes small waves, but it's still a locked-tight box with little expandability. It all comes down to choices. Some people like the freedom of choice, some don't care, and some just want things to be as simplistic as possible. </div>

		<div class="commentbody">Trust Tiffany to go straight for the EULA - - that was a brilliant find! It's a very significant moment - - that Google is capable of even getting near such an atrocious EULA means the idealistic days are over -- really, truly, over. We could be watching the birth of a new MS, and it will require constant user-policing to make sure this doesn't happen anytime soon.

The great thing about Chrome -- and about IE 8 -- is that they try to keep each tab or window an entirely separate process -- this is really big news because it means that -- unlike any other browser -- a single errant tab won't take the entire browser down.

So far, Chrome is implementing this concept more rigidly and more thoroughly (and more effectively) than Microsoft.

The downside in both cases is huge memory footprints and startlingly high thread counts. You'll need twice as much memory for either as you did for previous generations of browsers. If you have the memory and processor power, Chrome has by far the most persuasive architecture of all the browsers.

1/3 gig to run 10 tabs. What about 20? 30? All of a sudden, 4GB of memory is beginning to look like 4MB of memory. I've never understood why a browser takes up so much memory -- what is it but a hypertext interpreter after all? Yet the programmers at both MS and Google seem to have the same message: to advance the architecture means having even <em>more</em> memory.

So how will Mozilla react? </div>

		<div class="commentbody">I've been using Chrome as my primary browser since Tuesday now.

Plus: Blazingly fast. Very stable. Each tab is a process. Minimal "chrome" to clutter the UI (making the name rather ironic).

Minus: Not being able to override fonts in web pages. Imported bookmarks end up in a *sub-menu* of the bookmarks, with no apparent practical way to move them all out to the main level.

Overall: Thumbs up, but with significant reservations. But still about the most impressive pre-1.0 "beta" app I've used.

I can't influence how web content is presented to me (filtering, re-styling, adding additional information, ...), which is a killer feature of firefox to me.

If

		<div class="commentbody">I have every major browser on my Toshiba Satellite A215 laptop, running Vista Home Premium.

I prefer Firefox 3 for most things, but Safari for Windows is by FAR the most stable. Chrome is okay, but I haven't used it that much because I am so big on FF3 and Safari Win. 

I keep IE7 around for my boyfriend to use and for watching movies on Netflix.

I also have Browzar, the free "private" browser, which in itself is pretty good. 

I just don't see the need for Google to come up with a new browser, except for the fact that they seem to be creating more and more stuff that would be a vital part of their own OS. 

 - Gmail
 - Blogger
 - Documents
 - Calendar
 - Desktop 
 - Chrome

My suspicion is that they are amping up their products to be a new free OS on par with Linux. They probably are cultivating these new applications and generating all this buzz to lure people from other systems. I already use two different Gmail accounts, write in documents, etc. 

I would wager that within five years Google will have a new OS and make it big with users turned off by the people turned off by the exclusivity of MS and Mac and target a new cult of tech-savvy youth and millennials. I wouldn't even be surprised if they started manufacturing manufacturing their own devices.  </div>

They've pretty much said why: all current browsers have really crappy memory handling when it comes to JavaScript execution.

But you are correct, this is pretty much the Google OS that has been rumored from what I can tell.

Some think it might become an actual full-fledged OS as you state. I'm not convinced yet, but things like their Cell Phone 'OS' Android  is a convinced argument for it...</div>

HTTPS would be a network transfer protocol, while the browser cache would be a local computer behavior.

That article seems to be describing the functionality of the local browser cache and spinning it as a security hole.

Granted, having data like this in the local cache is certainly an issue, but not really something that is unique to Chrome.
