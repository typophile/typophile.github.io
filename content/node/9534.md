    <BR>I thought a lot about whether something with one or two letters changed would
    match, but even that didn&#39;t seem promising, although Amasis with a new &#39;a&#39;
    and &#39;r&#39; would be pretty close. <BR> <BR>So it seems this must be a rather
    new font, or one from an obscure source.  I am still hoping to see an answer for
    this, just to satisfy my curiosity about it. <BR> <BR>Let me guess -- it&#39;s

  body: It seems highly unlikely that someone would customize one or two characters
    of an existing font when there are SO many fonts that resemble this. I bet it&#39;s
    a custom corporate or magazine font, but that&#39;s why it would be good to know
    where it came from.

    five is no match. The E&amp;F Egyptienne five does, to me, look very similar to
    the posted sample. However E&amp;F doesn&#39;t seem to offer a version that is
    not condensed, which to me is odd.

    major foundries, unless it&#39;s a custom face they did. It&#39;s the sort of

    hope this Jonas dude appreciates our combined effort. He seems to have fallen
    off the face of the earth! If he&#39;d only replied to our MANY requests for the
    source of the sample this might have been cleared up days ago.

  body: I think Wolfgang Grulke mentions &#34;some 50 billion machines&#34; while
    Lars Godell has that exact quote from the original sample. Both deal with M2M.
    Yeah, I wish Jonas would come back and shed some light on this but it seems this
    thread is now an orphan. Still, thanks to your efforts it&#39;s another one in
    the solved column and now we&#39;ve all learned about Siemens Slab Bold, and perhaps
    will consider it in a future type-ID so it&#39;s all good.

  body: Great work Patty!  It pays to be up on your type award winners, although it
    should be rare for us ever to see this one again, since it is proprietary. So
    the implication of that is that the original sample was a quote of Godell/Grulke
    in a Siemens publication? &#40;seems plausible&#41; <BR> <BR>Well, anyway, I filed
    that sample in with my Slab Serif fonts, so I will recognize it if there is a
    next time. I&#39;m just glad I don&#39;t have to keep hunting for more slab serif

  body: I remember that last thread clearly but whether we&#39;ve seen the custom
    Siemens family before isn&#39;t in doubt. Like Mike said, a passing glance at
    the family almost a year ago was hardly enough to register all the destinctive
    shapes of the <i>variant</i> slab face, and since it was a corporate face, I never
    thought we&#39;d see it again unless someone asked &#34;what&#39;s the siemen&#39;s
    face?&#34; at which point a bell would ring. BUt without any sort of indication
    that the source of this was a Siemens document &#40;which it may or may not be&#41;,
    the ID was pretty challenging. That&#39;s why I said it was pretty good of Patricia
    to make the connection. Nuff said about this. <BR> <BR>I think I&#39;ve muddled
    what I was trying to say. Hopefully its understandable
