  mentions that the classic match to Century is Franklin Gothic, which obviously comes
  from more of a newspaper tradition.\r\n\r\nI'm curious as to what other combinations
  could be considered \"classic\"?\r\n\r\nWe have:\r\nCentury -> Franklin Gothic\r\nHelvetica
  -> Helvetica (LoL, those witty Swiss...)\r\n"

    for the headline and Century Oldstyle for the text And everything was kerned \"tighter
    than a waterbug's ass\". That was the actual terminology we used back at Great
    Faces. It's been quite a while since I've seen Century Oldstyle used in advertising.\r\n"
