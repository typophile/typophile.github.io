    ALT=":-&#41;" BORDER=0> <BR> <BR>It is also known as &#39;Carleton&#39; in the
    Corel font world. It also seems to exist as &#39;freeware&#39; under that name
    as well. <BR> <BR>Agfa &#40;excuse me, Monotype Imaging&#41; no longer includes
    this in the Image Club fonts. &#34;Oldstyle&#34; was listed as the source in my
    old Image Club catalog.
