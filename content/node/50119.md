body: "How about Vista Sans regular for headlines and Garamond or Minion for bodytext?\r\n\r\nDo
  they match? I was trying to follow some of the \"rules\" in fontmatching I read
  on the other threads covering that topic. I chose Garamond and Minion because they
  are both humanist, and I compared apertures of e,c,a and tails of J,t etc. with
  Vista Sans Regular and it seems they should match well???\r\n\r\nHow am I doing?
  I'm mostly lost but I'm trying hard. ;))\r\n\r\n"

  body: I recently used for a magazine Vista Sans black (titling alts on) for headlines
    with Garamond Premiere Pro regular for text to wonderful results. VS also looks
    great with Arno. Good luck!

    works like a charm. If you're going to work with (narrow) columns, I'd prefer
    Minion for body."
