  \r\n\r\nCurrently trying to convince the client we need it. Can't live without it.\r\n\r\nAnd
  until I have it, I'll be here. Under my desk, sobbing softly...\r\n\r\n"

  body: "That is nice but IMHO less and less successful as it gets compressed. The
    S especially starts looking like a backwards Z and seems quite out of character
    with the S's of the wider weights which have a nice squarish quality. I'd have
    preferred the S to follow more the shape of Solex or Tasse. I'm also not wild
    about the angle of the C in MICROFIBER.\r\n\r\nThis is a case of I might just
    buy some of the weights and not the whole family."

  body: Patty, I had the opportunity to work with Antenna this last year. I know what
    you mean about the cap S and the lowercase c. The lowercase a is one of my least
    favorite glyphs. But for me the black weights in all variants seem a little choked.
    (Which seems very odd to me as Cyrus has never had this problem before.) But other
    than that I really grew to love the face.

  body: "mate are you joking? those curves are so badly drawn that is looks like some
    automatic interpolation between Amplitude and eurostile! It is neither here nor
    there, trying to be too many things. Its a shame becuase he seems to have done
    some pretty good other typefaces.\r\n\r\nMuzz"
