body: This is the bottom part of a logo I'm supposed to recreate. I identified the
  top part (totally different font), but can't quite place this font. It's similar
  to a couple of Calligraphic fonts I have, but not quite right. Maybe someone has
  the correct version - not that I'm sure that's the right one though.
