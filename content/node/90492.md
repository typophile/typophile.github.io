  body: "Yes, many places where the curves start going\r\nout (like the right side
    of the bottom of the\r\nright stem in the \"H\") aren't smooth enough.\r\n\r\nOh,
    and I just had an idea: what if you made the\r\nbars of the \"ff\" join, making
    a capital \"H\"? You'd\r\nprobably need to make the actual \"H\" lowercase,\r\nand
    possibly even highlight the \"ff\" in some way.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "Hrant, thanks for your comments. I tried connecting ff but didn't like it.
    Still undecided on other things like making the ends round or sharp.\r\n\r\nLet
    me tell you what bothers me most, and this is more visible (to me) in the non-outlined
    version.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://mousewave.com/preview/07.png\">\r\n\r\nNow as
    I see it, /f/ looks thick /a/ is thin, /n/ heavy, overall they all look like they
    are in different weights."

    out.

    and the ff is begging to be connected at the crossbar. Overall, though, very nice.  '

  body: "I think the second new /ff/ is the best so far. The ball terminal variants
    look clumsier. I'd see what I could do if I were you about the arc of the /a/
    - which needs more weight, whereas the stem probably needs less \u2013 and the
    shoulder of the /r/, which seems too heavy. I'd also consider making the /n/ a
    bit wider if possible."

  body: Nice. Have you tried making the the first 'f' slightly lower or the second
    higher. Quite common in ff ligatures and might give it an interesting dynamic.

    about seb: Yes, I've seen a lot of those ligatures while browsing font sites,
    but I'm guessing that will be too much here, as there is enough upwards and downwards
    movement already."

  body: One thing that (I'm sure is intentional) is the relative thickness of left
    side of the a's bowl and its right side. Left is thinner and it makes /a/ look
    somewhat dystrophic. /n/ and /e/ have the same difference, but it's the right
    that's thinner. I wonder if flipping the thickness on a's bowl would make the
    whole thing look a bit more self-consistent?

  body: "apankrat: Definitely worth trying and it might be related to my main concern.\r\n\r\nI
    don't know if it's because of problematic curves Hrant mentioned or anyhing else,
    but the flow of letters as a whole still does not feel right, especially when
    viewed without outlines.\r\n\r\nBy the way if you know of similar fonts, it would
    be helpful to investigate."
