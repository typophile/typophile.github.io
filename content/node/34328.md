body: Can anyone point me in the direction of some online examples of Edwardian/late
  Victorian page layout? The typeface isn't too important, I'm just trying to get
  a handle on the ways pages were typically laid out during this era. Any help is
  much appreciated.

    or use the advanced search feature and search for books published between (say)
    1880 and 1910. I got numerous hits that way.
