  body: "Will check some more for a low crossbar on A serif with a lower case.  \r\nPerhaps
    another typophile could make a suggestion.\r\nThis design is rare for serifed
    fonts but is found in some art deco sans. These tend to have a lot of exaggeration
    in letter shapes. For example Party At Gatsbys by T.W. Jeffery:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/PartyAtGatsbys_5928.jpg]\r\nhttp://www.fontspace.com/tysmagic/party-at-gatsbys\r\nDon"

  body: "Ana - not knowing what, besides the low crossbar, you are after, I'll offer
    five options ...\r\n\r\nThe first is <a href='http://old.myfonts.com/fonts/tilde/windsor/'
    target='_blank'>Windsor Light</a> (or Light Condensed).\r\n\r\nThe next two are
    based on the early twentieth century lettering of Elizabeth Colwell. There is
    the fanciful <a href='http://old.myfonts.com/fonts/nicksfonts/mckenna-handletter-nf/'
    target='_blank'>McKenna Handletter</a> and even quirkier <a href='http://moorstation.org/typoasis/designers/lab/lab_colwell.htm'
    target='_blank'>Colwell</a>.\r\n\r\nNext there is <a href='http://old.myfonts.com/fonts/mti/handle-old-style/'
    target='_blank'>Handle Old Style</a>.\r\n\r\nAnd last, with its mini-serifs, is
    Doug Olena's <a href='http://www.fontsfordesign.com/preview.html' target='_blank'>Elegant</a>."

    Inline \r\nhttp://www.linotype.com/176894/ElegantInline-product.html\r\nSerifs
    that are mirco -- smaller than mini!-- with one of the lowest crossbars on A that
    I have seen, and including a fairly conventional lower case. \r\nDon"

    2003, Agfa Monotype. I'm nearly certain it was a Compugraphic property before
    that.\r\n\r\nI wonder why Linotype doesn't offer the solid variant of Elegant."

    for Linotype's font selection I note that they only offer a few of Doug Olena's
    fonts, even though most of his fonts are good quality designs not found elsewhere.
    Fortunately he sells them through his own website, Keystrokes.\r\nDon"
