body: "I have looked everywhere for this and to my knowledge it doesn't exist. \r\n\r\nIn
  InDesign is there a shortcut to enter TextEdit mode when a text box container is
  selected. Kind of like the opposite of hitting esc to exit text edit mode. I know
  it's just one extra click, but as you all know, clicks add up. \r\n\r\nAlso feel
  free to add your most helpful text editing shortcuts. "

  body: No. You can hit Ctrl+Y to use the Story Editor window, but it is not the same.

  body: "Not sure if I understood the question. If you are looking for a shortcut
    to select the Text tool, it is: T (just T, without Ctrl/Cmd). You can hover over
    any tool to see its shortcut.\r\nPlus, you can always define your own keyboard
    shortcuts, and add to/override the default options."

  body: 'Florian, if I understood correctly, the aim is to use a keyboard shortcut
    to edit a text frame when it is selected as object. There is no way to do this:
    even if you change the tool to Text, you still need to click inside the frame
    to edit it. A minor failure as no shortcut can be set to this procedure.'

  body: "Igor, yes, of course you need to click if you want to edit text, because
    InDesign otherwise won\u2019t know where you like to start editing the text, no?
    Global attributes that apply to the whole object can be set without changing to
    text mode, like typeface, size etc. pp. \r\nYou can skip the step of selecting
    the Text tool by multiple-clicking (2\xD7 = insert cursor, 3\xD7 = select line,
    4\xD7 = select paragraph, 5\xD7 = select story. If you want to select one single
    word, double-click, pause, and double-click again. Is that what you were looking
    for? "

  body: Thanks, Florian, but I know this. I was just explaining the original question.
    Justin want to use a keyboard shortcut to edit the text inside the selected frame.
    There is no such option.

  body: "Alright, now I got it. Yes, you are right, if you don\u2019t want to use
    the mouse, Ctrl-Y is the best option, as you have suggested."
