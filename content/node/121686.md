  Any help would be appreciated.\r\n\r\nIf you know of any similar fonts to these
  two, that also would be of great help!\r\n\r\nThanks in advance\r\n\r\nJason\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/hipster_6497.jpg]"

  body: Could be wrong but 'HIPSTER' looks like [[http://www.myfonts.com/search/times|Times]].
    Hard to say for the script (far from my specialty actually but pretty convinced
    somebody else will find it out) but maybe something like [[http://www.myfonts.com/search/english+script|English
    Script]] could do the job. Can't tell for 'Est. 2013', really too small for my
    eyes.
