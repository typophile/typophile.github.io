  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>Hi All,</p>
<p>A friend and I have started a general graphic design office.  We&rsquo;re in need of a printer that outputs text at acceptable resolutions, isn&rsquo;t going to break down on us and isn&rsquo;t going to cost a fortune.  Though it will primarily be used for printing generic office documents, I would like for it to be able to print out quality drafts and tests when needed.  I don&rsquo;t know much about the standing of laser printers in the current market or which brands to trust.  Most of the posts on the forum concerning the topic are outdated and reviews on the web are scattered about and from people who aren&rsquo;t concerned with the same things we are (ie text qualities, etc.)</p>
<p>If those of you on the forum feel like sharing your opinions and experiences please do.  It&rsquo;d be greatly appreciated.</p>
<p>Just as an example:  Would this be a suitable printer: SAMSUNG ML-2525W? (<a href="http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16828112184">http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16828112184</a>)  Is Samsung trustworthy?  Are all printers around $100 going to break down in a few months?  Does it even matter which brand I choose?</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>
<p>Korey</p>

		<div class="commentbody">I bought a refurbished Nashuatec (or Ricoh, it is the same) P7026N (A3, real postcript, network capabilities). The printer works fine and I love it for font proofing. BUT the problem is the drivers do not work with OSX 10.6 (and the one provided for the company does not work).
So&hellip; support is an issue when you buy a second hand machine. Many companies stop giving support to new OS for old models.
I keep an old G4 laptop as printer station, but is it bothering&hellip;</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I got a B&amp;W Brother 3000DN more than 5 years ago for &lt;$300 and it’s been an incredible workhorse. Very cheep, and never a problem. They are even cheaper now and come with built in duplex capabilities. If I were to get a colour, I would start looking at Brother. Maybe 10 years ago I worked for a company in Toronto and they had (I think) a “Phazer Tectronics 780,” which I believe has since been bought out by Xerox. It was <strong>very</strong> good and <strong>extremely</strong> expensive. &gt;$3,000 Canadian in 1998.</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I second Bob&rsquo;s recommendation of HP network printers. I picked up a LaserJet 5000n for $50 advertised on craigslist.
The upsides are that it handles 11x17, A3, and sheets slightly larger; it can also handle pretty heavy weight media when loaded manually; it does high-volume printing very well; its toner lasts a long time; after setting it up on the network, it&rsquo;s really simple to add the printer to other computers, particularly ones running OS X; for general graphic design proofing (usually with lots of greys on the page) the print quality is fine—for lettering and type design it&rsquo;s great; it&rsquo;s pretty reliable. In four years I have never had a problem more complicated than a paper jam.
Downsides: It&rsquo;s big and heavy; setting it up on the network is just slightly complicated, or not at all, depending on how the previous owner configured it. It took me 30 minutes (and you&rsquo;ll need to know a few particulars about how your own network is set up); Also, buying second-hand can be risky. I got lucky and found a machine that had hardly been used and its imaging and output were perfect. Particularly with these older models though you&rsquo;ll find some that have been mistreated, and often the result is repeating defects—some of which disappear with a new toner cartridge, some don&rsquo;t. Just be sure to check its test page output carefully before buying.</p>
<p>I also second Christopher on Phaser&rsquo;s color. It&rsquo;s the best color laser output I&rsquo;ve seen. The place I was working that had it did have to call in professionals occasionally to recalibrate it and replace parts a few times over the course of the 9 months I was there.</p>

		<div class="commentbody">Some of the better models in the Xerox Phaser line can be great for a graphic design office; wonderful color rendition, can print 11 x 17, etc.. But pricey, though. I think the one I use cost over $4,000. And it weighs a ton.  But they have cheaper models in the Phaser line too.</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Let me add a second question to this thread: does anyone have different type results with original and recharged toner?</p>
<p>With my HPs (LaserJet 4P, LaserJet 2100m and ColorJet 2605dn) original toner produces type bolder than I expected. It&rsquo;s clearly more tinted than I see on screen, although contour quality is excellent. But with recharged toner cartridges these same printers produces lighter, less tinted texts. Actually, type printed with recharged toner is more near to off-set print result, but contour quality is not so perfect.</p>
<p>Was this an issue to you? Which kind of test must be considered more reliable to show how my font will play at commercial prints?</p>
<p>About color printing, I worked intensively with a Tektronix about ten years ago, just before the company was purchased by Xerox. Although expensive, Tektronix color results were fantastic. Pure B&amp;W text were not so good, always darker than it would be. Phaser printers and also its print results suffered a lot with humidity and heat climate conditions. In other hand, HP ColorJet 2605 I use now produces rather good results for color text and graphics, but has a poor, swashed output with photos. It&rsquo;s much cheaper and hardly affected by humidity.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I have an HP color laserjet, which is a fine workhorse printer, but as Freiberger says, if you&rsquo;re proofing type, it comes out bolder than you expect. I don&rsquo;t think this is a function of the toner but rather of the Postscript emulation that the HP print driver uses. Using recharged toner cartridges probably does adjust for this gain.</p>
<p>But this summer I got a Xerox Phaser monochrome printer with true Postscript. Everything comes out a lot sharper and without the HP bloat.</p>
<p>What I concluded: If your target output device is a true Postscript printer (e.g. professional offset printing), then it&rsquo;s worth having a true Postscript printer to proof with. I am not sponsored by Xerox, but it&rsquo;s the only true Postscript printer I found at a reasonable price.</p>
