  body: ' thats phat. the only thing i dont like is the bottom of the S and E. since
    you&#39;re going for the feel of a tag &#40;correct me if i&#39;m wrong&#41; it
    doesnt really flow with the rest of the character. it looks like the bottom part
    was added after the rest of the S or E was written, when normally the letter is
    all one stroke. but maybe thats how you &#34;write,&#34; but i just think that
    bottom part should flow a little more with the rest of the letter. and maybe the
    A could use a little more style near the top, like a serif up there pointing to
    the left. '
