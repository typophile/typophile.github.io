  body: "Hi Yael,\r\n\r\n#1 looks like <strong>[[http://www.fontsquirrel.com/fonts/Brushstroke-Plain|Brushstroke
    Plain]]</strong> free font by Kevin Willis (1992)\r\nNote though that there is
    another quite similar font called <strong>Pennello Becker</strong> (Copyright
    \ 1999 Data Becker) so, I 'm not sure if Brushstroke Plain is the actual original
    design.\r\n\r\n#2 must be a handwritten font called <strong>Maria</strong> but
    I have no more data about it (Designer, Foundry, License etc) and I have not found
    any legitimate source to acquire it, therefore I advise to check twice and be
    extra careful if you want to license/use the font in any commercial project.\r\n\r\nFivos\r\n\r\n-----------------------------------------------\r\nI
    found them using Find my Font - http://www.findmyfont.com"

    legitimate free fonts. I would avoid using/recommending them (especially the latter)
    without further research.\r\n\r\nFivos, thanks for the caution on #2.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "Brushstroke Plain TOP\r\nPennello Becker  BOTTOM\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/untitled9_3630.jpg]\r\nSince
    Pennello Becker is older, what reason is there to suspect it's \"not a legitimate
    free font\"? Show me an older font that it's based on. I like Brushstroke better,
    but Pennello has more glyphs."

  body: "Strange. I guess Pennello Becker is a scan & trace of a printout (or rendering)
    of Brushstroke Plain. But also, I could swear I've seen the latter as a commercial
    font.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "One does not look like a scan of the other. With a scan there would be exact
    duplicate letters or strokes someplace.  Clearly, Pennello Becker could be derivative
    of Brushstroke as it appears far muddier in comparison. \r\n\r\nIt also seems
    that Brushstroke Plain is nicely drawn which gives weight to it being an original
    or at least a legitimate font. Whether it's \"free\" or not ...\r\n\r\nps. Don't
    trust anything written in a font.  I predate all my fonts to get \"prior art\"."

  body: "Here we go again ...\r\n\r\nBrushstroke Plain (which I have as Brushstroke
    Medium) is a 1992 digital recreation of Stop A by Walter Honisch, 1939. Separately,
    I have in my notes that Mark Simonson confirmed this as, \"an old metal font called
    Stop.\"  I can't find the post to verify this, though. Mark?\r\n\r\nAgain, Hrant,
    your \"strongly suspect\" is based upon ignorance and a highly dysfunctional gut
    feeling."

    you apparently have nothing to say about Pennello Becker... Not to mention your
    silence in this thread:\r\nhttp://typophile.com/node/99822\r\n\r\nAre you sure
    that Stop is in the public domain? If you're not sure, then be more cautious.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "Which is why I'm being tentative. See Fivos's #2 above for similar due caution.
    Remember, it's not like there's a shortage of [free] fonts, and choosing \"just
    the right font\" isn't exactly saving lives here. It's better to avoid potentially
    harming a designers instead.\r\n\r\nAlso, don't sidestep talking about Pennello
    Becker.\r\n\r\n--\r\n\r\nI believe all this resistance to exercising due caution
    is mostly coming from one place: people addicted to IDing fonts don't want morality
    cramping their lifestyle.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
