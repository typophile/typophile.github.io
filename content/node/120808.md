  tiny text onto paper. \r\n\r\nThe idea is to give out magnifying glasses to patrons
  so that people can read the tiny text. I want the text to be as small as possible,
  but still legible using a visual aid like a magnifying glass. It is fine to have
  the text not legible without a magnifying glass though.\r\n\r\nI suspect that a
  printer's DPI would be important in figuring out the smallest size since you need
  to fill a character's stroke with sufficient number of dots (ie. ink). For sake
  of discussion, let's assume the printer is a commercial printer who mass prints
  books.\r\n\r\nHow small in pts can I print the text?\r\n\r\nAny help is appreciated.
  Thanks."

    but is everyone assuming a DPI of 300? Aren't there commercial book printers who
    can print at higher DPI than 300? And with DPI of over 300, aren't you able to
    theoretically print at a smaller size?

    additional factors come into play: the roughness of the paper, and the thickness
    of the ink or toner. Even with super-smooth paper, ink may spread out (the same
    problem as when trying to accurately produce an exact level of gray, where it
    is called \"dot gain\") and toner may not be delineated sharply.\r\n\r\nOnce,
    while retouching small faults in a bitmap image -- which, by all rights, should
    have reproduced faithfully -- I inserted my initials in it with 5 pixel high characters
    into the dot of an 'i'. Unfortunately, after offset printing, the ink had run
    ever so slightly. The dot was visibly not 'sharp' anymore, but that was about
    it."

    that output at resolutions of 300 dpi. I think you're confusing the 300 ppi that's
    a common resolution of photos and scanned imagery intended for printing at about
    150 lpi.\r\n\r\nType is typically vector-based, so resolution is irrelevant. Unless
    the typography is printed with a screen tint, the 150 lpi is also irrelevant.\r\n\r\nWhat
    is relevant is the resolution of the output device. An inexpensive B&W laser printer
    typically prints at least at 600 dpi. The output resolution of a typical commercial-quality
    imagesetter or platesetter typically varies between 1200 and 4800 dpi. The resolution
    of microprinting used for anti-counterfeiting purposes on currency is even higher
    than that."
