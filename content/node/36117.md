    email "joel@sendoushi.com". I want this account (with the username "joelsantos")
    to have the username "sendoushi" so... since I don't use the other account and
    this one has all my historic on typophile...

    \u2014 Your threads are probably getting flagged by the Antispam checker and sent
    to a queue for moderation. That\u2019s the usual cause. One of the current admins
    will have to review and clear your post. But I\u2019m not sure if anyone is performing
    this task regularly any more these days. I would recommend sending a message through
    the Contact link that Russell pointed out to see if there\u2019s anyone on duty
    who can moderate those for you (and whitelist your account). "

  body: "> and whitelist your account\r\n\r\nI doubt if there is a whitelist. The
    main purpose of a whitelist is to distinguish between posts that should appear
    immediately and posts that need to be reviewed first by a moderator before appearing
    (like a post from a brand new account that might be spam).  Since we see blatant
    spam sometimes, it's clear that first-time posts are not being reviewed, so this
    method isn't being used."

  body: "It\u2019s not specifically a \u201Cwhitelist\u201D per se \u2014 I used the
    term generically. An admin can assign a special role that we use to let certain
    accounts that are constantly flagged for no good reason to bypass the antispam
    checker when they post. \r\n\r\nWe see blatant spam because the antispam module
    is not perfect and leaves much to be desired \u2014 i.e., it gives periodic false
    negatives. And it also gives occasional false positives. "
