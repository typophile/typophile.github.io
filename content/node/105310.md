  m, r, with no spurs, similarities to Helvetica and Century Gothic.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/photo_5249.jpg]\r\n\r\nI
  can't show the original photo of the font as seen in the wild, for client confidentiality
  reasons.\r\n\r\nThe lower-case M is definitely a heavier weight than the other characters,
  that's not just \"how it looks.\"\r\n\r\nWhile it appears to be a mashup of different
  type faces, I assure you, from what I've seen, it's an actual font with at least
  2 weights."
