body: "I read a recent article talking about David Cason's work on Beach Culture mag.
  I only saw a few screens of the work, but the stuff is amazing and suprisingly,
  i hadnt heard a lot about the work he did with the magazine. I always heard Ray
  Gun this and that but not so much about BC...So i was wondering if anyone had some
  good links to screens of pages or to places you can find actual copies? i've really
  never seen this magazine anywhere and the usual ebay search didnt turn up anything.
  \ So before i email D. Carson himself, i thought i'd ask here. thanks\r\n\r\nw|m"

    have issues of Ray Gun. Maybe you already tried that, but I thought I'd suggest
    it anyway. Don't let the owls scare you off.\r\n\r\nNice weather today, eh?"
