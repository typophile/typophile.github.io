body: I am a non-designer with limited knowledge of typography, but I figured one
  of you experts could help with this probably rather simple quest. I am looking for
  specific imagery that I know I have seen in typography or type design context, but
  I'm not sure what it's called. It's essentially a diagram of how individual letters
  of a typeface are drawn/created. The character is shown on some sort of grid with
  the radii of curves drawn as full circles, angles shown, tangents drawn, etc. What
  is this called? I have done google image searches for type design/diagram/grid,
  etc. to no avail. Thanks.

    can find used for under $10. Geoffrey Tory\u2019s <em>Champ Fleury</em> did something
    similar by comparing the Roman majuscules to idealized human proportions, this
    one can be found in a variety of French, English, and polyglot editions. More
    recently Helm Wotzkow broke the proportions of letters down into a square in his
    book <em>The Art of Lettering</em> and Frank Blokand has developed Letter Modeler,
    a program that generates letters based on harmonic proportions. There isn\u2019t
    really a name for these, probably because the systems have serious limitations."
