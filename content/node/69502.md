  the pages (Dark Hills Divide, Scholastic Press). After trudging by way through a
  couple of dense books, my eyes rejoiced! It was so airy and easy to read (not sure
  what the typeface is). \r\n\r\nTo my question, I am wondering which typefaces in
  novels you find the most readable."

    book easy to read. I would not be surprised that if in the books you found "dense",
    the problem was not the choice of typeface, but typesetting and layout problems:
    text too small, not enough leading, lines too long, margins too narrow, etc. Maybe
    the quality of printing  was bad as well.'

  body: Gary, you are probably right. I really don't know much about typography--though
    I do find it fascinating. Calluna, Amalia, Delicato, Calisto and Hoefler really
    look good to me. I also like Gentium. I know it is a relative newcomer and free,
    but really I think its a easy to read typeface.

    novel editions will show you that rather few Roman typefaces which represent the
    best of both the Venetian and French (Garalde) traditions are mostly chosen, for
    their unsurpassed legibility (which is not quite the same as readability).\r\n\r\nNobody
    wants to read \u2018Huckleberry Finn\u2019 or \u2018Ulysses\u2019 in Times or
    Gentium.  "

  body: "Interesting topic. Lately I've picked up a few novels in the library which
    I regretfully put back after glancing through a few pages of text which were uncomfortable
    to even browse, never mind a lengthy read. \r\n\r\nSome were simply in too small
    a size or too narrow; some had a relatively small x-height and tall ascenders/descenders.
    To me that's very fatiguing to read. "

  body: "The worst typesetting of a novel I've ever seen was a self-published job
    I got on a recommendation from a friend; the story was good, the novel itself
    needed some editing, and the page was set up in tightly tracked Arial. My eyes
    were burning after about 50 pages.\r\n\r\nI prefer Baskervilles and the like for
    my novels, but your mileage may vary."

    about the font options in the iPad's e-reader program. Well, evidently <em>somebody</em>
    thought these were good options for reading."
