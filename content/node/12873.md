body: "Hi,\r\n\r\nI am very new to building fonts. I have converted a few for work
  and tweaked, but creating from scrtach is a whole new board game.\r\n\r\nOk, so
  my task is to make a font from a hand drawn alphabet. I have two seperate scans
  one comprising of all the upper case characters, the other, lower case characters.
  I am running OS X and own Fontographer 4.1.4 and have access to FontLab 4.6. My
  Mac will boot natively into OS 9 if need be.\r\n\r\nRight, I placed the scan of
  the upper case characters into Illustrator 10 and have traced the characters to
  the point where I am very happy with them. I have done the same with the lower case
  and so have two Illustrator 10 files that make up my alphabet, all drawn and traced
  in proportion to each other. Now my problems start. Copying and pasting directly
  from Illustrator 10 into Fontographer doesn't want to work at all. I have read that
  doing this natively in OS 9 and using Illustrator 8 will cure this but have yet
  to try it, can anyone confirm this? I can import the whole EPS into fontographer
  but this means the whole alphabet is in one glyph space and the letters are tiny,
  and I mean really small (remember I had to trace a hand drawn image of the characters).
  When I split them up by copy and paste into individual lettersFontographer resizes
  which causes a huge problem with the lower case letters as they become the same
  size as the upper case characters and because the upper case is in one file and
  the lower in another, fontographer applies different scaling to each set.\r\n\r\nNow
  that I have traced and am happy with my bezier curve drawings in illustrator I could
  enlarge them proportionally but what is the optimum size for doing this that would
  make them appear at a decent size in Fontographer?  I imported the curves into FontLab
  but they got hideously mangled and aside from my scaling problem in Fontographer,
  the curves came into that damn near perfectly. And of course I own Fontographer
  and have used it before.\r\n\r\nSo (sorry to ramble guys) this should be relatively
  simple but is driving me crazy. Because the characters are hand drawn they are all
  proportionate to each other and that is how I want them in fontographer but the
  scaling is all over the place when I finally get something into it. I have read
  the Fontographer manual and am looking forward to messing with getting the font
  spaced and kerned etc but I just cannot get my slaved over bezier curves out of
  illustrator and into fontographer without messing up the size and proportions I
  worked hard to keep in the original tracing.\r\n\r\nAny help to these novice questions
  wouold be very greatly received.\r\n\r\nThanks for reading."

    english in the following): In Illustrator make a rectangle the size which extends
    from the character which has the lowest point to the letter which has the highest
    (from the descender to the ascender). When you copy from Illustrator you should
    copy several letters (or all of them if your computer can handle it) together
    with that rectangle. \r\n\r\nMove to your font application and paste the characters
    into a slot. Now you should have your characters in Fontographer or FontLab. And
    they should all be proportionally aligned as you intended. From there on it\u2019s
    just a matter of moving each letter into its own slot. I hope that helps.\r\n\r\n/Robert"

    body: "Thanks for the reply.  I got the outlines into Fontographer by using Illustrator
      8 and the scaling trick worked a treat.\r\n\r\nI find myself in the bizarre
      position of being asked to digitise an artists handwritten font which is going
      to be on a specific range of greetings cards for a company that has world wide
      distribution - and this is the first font I have ever digitised.\r\n\r\nI spent
      a long time tracing the scans and the spacing and kerning was fun to do as the
      font is emulating handwriting and requires a certain random look to emulate
      the original scans.\r\n\r\nToday I took the font in and within an hour they
      had approved it and the art team were using it on the range of cards, which
      is quite scary as I have not even finished making ALL the characters I would
      like to include with the font. Due to very long ascenders and descenders the
      font is quite small in comparison to other fonts at the same point size. I offered
      tho try and tweak this but they want to use the font now and say that it will
      only ever be used for captions and although it would be useless for body text
      it works very well for the captions.\r\n\r\nThree weeks ago I had never made
      or even attempted to make a font and I would like to thank typophile for the
      many hours of fine reading material. I am now hooked and although my first font
      is going to appear in a number of countries on an overwhelming number of cards,
      I am now seriously into type faces.\r\n\r\nI did try FontLab but my bezier drawings
      pasted into it  so badly that I may have well just drawn them in FontLab to
      start with. Trouble was, I had already drawn them in illustrator (which I have
      experience with) and once I realised that I had to use Illustrator 8, the curves
      went into Fontographer perfectly.\r\n\r\nThanks again for the help.\r\n\r\nPaul"

    will also distort your glyphs -- when it generates the font. Fontographer allows
    non-integer coordinates during the drawing, so you can paste arbitrary artwork,
    and freely scale and move it in Fontographer. But when Fontographer generates
    the font, it will round all the coordinates to integers, causing your outline
    points change positions. It can be easily tested: just generate a Type 1 font
    in Fontographer and read it back in, then compare. \r\n\r\nFontLab does to rounding
    already at the beginning of the process. So if you scale the glyphs to the appropriate
    size in Illustrator and paste them into FontLab, you will see exactly what the
    forms will look like in the final font. In the end, whatever goes into the font
    from Fontographer or FontLab, is the same. The difference is that FontLab always
    shows you in full WYSIWYG what the font outlines will look like while Fontographer
    allows you more freedom in the design process but then does the coordinate rounding
    for you in an uncontrolled manner. Which usually means you will have to redraw
    the glyphs anyway so *you* decide where the nodes should snap rather than the
    application. \r\n\r\nThere are some additional informations at: \r\nhttp://groups.msn.com/fontlab/tipsandtricks.msnw?action=get_message&mview=0&ID_Message=2675\r\n\r\nRegards,

    body: "Thanks Adam, that makes sense now I have generated my font. I must admit
      that because I actually own Fontographer I could play around with it a lot more.\r\n\r\nI
      am pleased with how this has gone and the font does look like the artists original
      captions, right down to the spacing and kerning. It was a steep learning curve
      and I haven't even begun to scratch the surface.\r\n\r\nHere is a pdf of the
      captions followed by the same caption written in the font. Remember, it is my
      first attempt and the brief was to remain faithful to the hand drawn alphabet.\r\n\r\n<a
