  <BR> <BR>this one looks like the fusion of bold and regular weights <BR>of some
  sans. I swear I came across this one on a &#34;70,000 font <BR>explosion&#34; CD
  that came with a book. Also there&#39;s this one: <BR> <BR><!--attachment: RDIA-43149.unk*attachment_icon.gif*image/tiff*19.8*RDIA*RDIA%2etif

  <BR> <BR>That looks like brush or pen on absorbent paper, a Papyrus <BR>feel but
  with the embellishments like the long stemmed right <BR>leg on the &#34;A&#34; <BR>

    The most well known digital <BR>version is Allen Walden&#39;s <a href="http://www.musicaecomputer.com/fonts/japan/english.htm"
    target="_blank"> Japan</a>. I couldn&#39;t find it for Mac.

  body: I&#39;ve seen it put to lots of uses over the years and, to me, it can <BR>serve
    nicely for, say, a magician&#39;s or horror show poster/flyer. <BR> <BR>It&#39;s
    found, however, in the oriental-style section of the Solotype <BR>Catalog and
    called Japanette and that Japanese connection I <BR>simply do not see at all.
    <BR> <BR>Oddly enough, though, my family and I went out for a Chinese <BR>dinner
    last night shortly after I made the above post and what <BR>typeface do you suppose
    was used on the packaging of our <BR>fortune cookies?  You got it. <BR> <BR>Hey,
    Daniel, maybe if your Mac were Macanese ...  ? <BR><br>
