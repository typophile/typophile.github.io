body: "I\u2019m looking for a (text) serif with as/descenders that are darker than
  the x-height area. I\u2019m not even sure if such a thing excists. They must not
  be to obvious at close inspection, but notable in a large block of text.\r\n\r\nAlso
  typefaces with letters that are denser then the rest (with the same effect on text
  color in large blocks of text) are of interest."

    Antiqua]]? Jim Spiece also did a version, called [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/spiecegraphics/eva-sg/|Eva]],
    in which the weighted ascenders are even more pronounced.

    a traditional, but contemporary look. \r\n\r\nRiccardo: Kinesis is a great suggestion,
    but I think I\u2019ll need something slightly softer."

    I didn\u2019t have time for all the samples. Was there something specific you
    were thinking about?"

  body: I guess I'm not sure exactly what you're seeking. You want ascenders that
    are darker than the body?

  body: "Bendy: I guess I\u2019m looking for design flaws: Letters that are denser
    (darker) than the other letters in the typeface, ex: a binocular g that isn\u2019t
    well optically adjusted. \r\n\r\nI\u2019ve got an art project on the stairs with
    a writer friend. We\u2019re \u201Cdrawing\u201D with text, hence I\u2019m looking
    for design features that could give me some shades. We\u2019ll use white space
    (paragraphs, line breaks) and italics (speach) for light shades, and capitals
    plus the stuff I\u2019m requesting here for darker shades. It will be quite big,
    and divided in narrow coloumns allowing us to construct the sentences more carefully.
    It will be a real short story illustrating itself."

  body: I know I've fairly recently seen a typeface that was designed to replicate
    the uneven pressure of older typewriters...the top half of most characters were
    slightly, but noticeably, heavier (inkier) than the bottom half. I haven't been
    able to find it again though.

    the obvious, but maybe you could work with a typeface that has a very fine gradation
    of weights, or even something like H&FJ's \"grades\", and just pop in a couple
    of very slightly darker letters where you need them?"
