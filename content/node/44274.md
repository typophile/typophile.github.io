body: "[img:sites/default/files/old-images/schedule_board_3859.JPG]\r\n\r\nAnyone
  know of a font set that looks exactly like the letters used on an old-school airport
  flight arrivals/departures board?  \r\n\r\nFeatures white letters on black boxes
  with rounded corners, a slight crease running across middle of each letter where
  each letter folds in half, etc...\r\n\r\n(I wouldn't be surprised if it's called
  \"rolodex\" or \"boxscore\" font)\r\n\r\nThanks for your help.\r\n\r\nps. awesome
  Drupal site!"

  body: 'These mechanical displays were made by Conrac in Germany (now it''s all digital
    stuff).  This was one of their standard fonts, more or less based on helvetica,
    but with occasional deviations to accommodate the horizontal split. We occasionally
    had them make up custom fonts, but this was an expensive and time consuming procedure
    since the final designs had to work within the limitations of their manufacturing
    process.  '
