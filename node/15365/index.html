  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>When I struck out on my own earlier this year, I was forced to rapidly create a business card and logo to drum up new business. I have since tried to base my other materials on that card (well, other materials being my website and invoices) and I&rsquo;m now considering revising and putting more thought into my needs &ndash; I&rsquo;m a one-man studio working in print, logo, and interactive design.</p>
<p>Anyway, here are samples of my current business card and invoice, as well as <!-- raw HTML omitted -->my website<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. I&rsquo;d like other professional opinions as to whether or not I should proceed with changing or live with what I have. Any and all suggestions are welcome. Thanks.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I really like what you have &hellip; the print identity is nicely complemented by the online presence. You&rsquo;ve created a wonderful feeling of trust and professionalism, through the efficient use of type, image, and color. (And solid verbiage.)</p>
<p>I really like your logowork, most of all the fenceworks logo. :)</p>
<p>The only thing that stood out was the picture of yourself, and the inclusion of your child. I have two kids so I understand the pride of being a father. But in my very humble opinion, I don&rsquo;t think that you need a kid picture. To me, it makes it seem like you are juggling design while changing diapers. And maybe you are. Some clients might like that, others may not. I&rsquo;m sure others have a differing opinion on this. Anyway, that is my only quibble in what is an otherwise fantastic print/online combo. Congrats!</p>

<p>I agree about the photograph &ndash; I had honestly forgotten about it (it was previously me and my dog&hellip;). The family photos should probably be restricted to my personal site.</p>
