  body: Hi Cheshire, Thanks for your posts -- here and on my &#34;The Train Robbers&#34;
    thread. This type has to be exactly recreated, so if I can&#39;t find a digital
    font I may have to find a source to scan &#40;type book or ?&#41;. Any other suggestion
    will be appreciated.

  body: This looks like lettering to me. Note the differences between the individual
    letters &#34;arum&#34; between the two words, especially the &#34;a&#34;. <BR>
    <BR>Since you have halfway descent images of these logos, it wouldn&#39;t be too
    hard to redraw them in something like Illustrator. &#40;Or maybe even hire someone
    to do it for you. :-&#41;

    Alice, just spelled with a y&#41; and a cat lover it ocurred to me to use the
    cheshire cat in my own stationery, etc. Your tie in is obviously much closer.
    Several years ago I bought one-time usage rights from Bettmann Archives for the
    original Tenniel illustration, for a Friskies magazine project. Here&#39;s the

  body: Thanks, Alyce -- a detail of the image you used is the startup image on my
    computer. I&#39;m very surprised to hear, however, that the Tenniel illustrations
    aren&#39;t in the public domain. Tenniel&#39;s been dead for nearly 100 years!
    Oh well, don&#39;t tell Bettmann I scanned it out of my <i>Annotated Alice</i>.

  body: Cheshire, Public domain? Probably. However, we had the art budget and a reputable
    source so we spent the money. The price was cheap to protect ourselves and the
    client.  <BR> <BR>Have you seen the Pennyroyal editions of Alice? They were designed
    and illustrated by Barry Moser. Illustrations, page design and typography are
    all beautiful. Check out his Richard Nixon-inspired Humpty Dumpty. <BR> <BR><a

    wondering about the Disney film &#34;Newsies,&#34; since newspapers seem to be
    a stumbling block for many of the films you cited.  <BR> <BR>Living in Los Angeles
    we are able to recognize many film locations. Downtown, in particular gets used
    a lot. 7th Street was recently dressed to look like New York for the next Spiderman
