  between braces and curly brackets? I always thought they were the same, but I've
  got a colleague who <strong>insists</strong> that they're different and that we're
  using curly brackets.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nR "

    decoration. If you actually need to use them with text check your style manual
    or ask your editor how you should be using them."

  body: There is a style of "curly brackets" or alternately "squarey braces" or somesuch
    that shows up from time to time, and I've always liked it. The font that comes
    to mind is Hoefler Text. Check out its brackets and braces; perhaps that is what
    your colleague has in mind.

    crucial. ;)

  body: "Page 303 of Bringhurst's Elements of Typographic Style calls {these} braces.\r\n\r\n<em>\"Braces
    are rarely required in text work, but they can function perfectly well as an extra
    and outer (or inner) set of parenthesis:</em> { ( [ - ] ) }.<em> In mathematics
    they are used to mark phrases and sets. In editing classical papyri, braces are
    often used to mark editorial deletings.\"</em>"

  body: "I use \"square brackets\" and \"curly braces\", to reduce potential confusion.\r\n\r\nIn
    terms of usage in running text, I use the former to indicate something that can
    be included in the text or not; and the latter to mention something \"meta\" that's
    relevant beyond the textual content. And parentheses I use to mean something that
    is an aside to the main text (sort of a more casual or immediate version of asterisked
    or footnoted content).\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
