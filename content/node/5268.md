body: I am designing a logotype for a firm that plan to arrange theme dinners held
  in various spectacular places. Examples of food could be &#39;scandinavian&#39;
  or &#39;18th century menus&#39;. Examples of places could be an old castle or a
  closed-down railway station. <BR> <BR>So the arrangements will have a &#39;adventurous&#39;
  quality. Therefore the design elements of the identity &#40;fonts, colour, symbols&#41;
  must have a hint of exotic places, third world, globetrotter, unexplored land ...
  you know ... <BR> <BR>I know what colours to choose from and what symbols and patterns.
  But do any of you know a font with the desired exotic quality to it? <BR> <BR>--

  body: I&#39;m wondering if -- assuming these are high end affairs -- that maybe
    you should brand it as high brow rather than exotic. There is a restaurant chain
    called <a href="http://www.rainforestcafe.com/">Rainforest Cafe</a> that attempts
    to provide an exotic ambience by pretending to be a jungle or rainforest. Your
    client sounds a lot cooler, but I wonder if trying to find exotic fonts will take
    you down the same cheesy road that Rainforest Cafe did. Good luck!

  body: how about you use lots of different typefaces. the logo could have one layout
    with a symbol, but on every item, the logo uses a differnt typeface to express
    the fact that the company offer food themed around lots of different places...
    <BR> <BR>something like this... <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/30/38752.gif"

  body: That&#39;s an interesting approach, Jim -- however ... the firm will use a
    corporation name combined with two subbrands &#40;e.g. Acme Theme Dinner and Acme
    Catering&#41; ... so your solution would be confusing. <BR> <BR>Thanks for taking
    time to think about the design! <BR> <BR>-- <BR>Soren O
