    it and style it in Quark 8 and -- believe it or not -- Ventura. '

    it I believe. I could be wrong though, and it may have been implemented in recent

    CS4 process.

  body: "Optical margin alignment cannot be set in paragraph styles (even though it
    is applied at the paragraph level!). This is a symptom of Adobe\u2019s broken
    development methodology: add new features, advertise them, and then forget about
    them. It\u2019s a real shame that the Indesign team has allowed this feature to
    wither as the only option int a menu item that isn\u2019t even relevant in the
    Latin version of Indesign, because with a little polish it would be so useful!
    <a href=\"http://www.adobe.com/cfusion/mmform/index.cfm?name=wishform\">I recommend
    that you file a feature request to move optimal margin alignment to the paragraph
    settings, along with the addition of control over what does and doesn\u2019t hang.</a> "
