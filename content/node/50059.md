  again this is the general discussions area, right? I have been looking for some
  valuable insight into this and thought you guys may have some opinions I would respect
  on it.\r\n\r\nI have been looking at this web host called [[http://www.businesscatalyst.com/|Business
  Catalyst]] - they are what has been dubbed as a 'next generation web host' meaning
  that they provide easy to customize and add web apps, integrated CRM etc for designers
  to resell to clients. They also allow designers to rebrand their product to sell
  it as theirs, with billing through the reseller or direct to client. In their words:\r\n\r\nBC
  is an online, hosted application that allows your clients to:\r\n\r\n    * Build
  and manage their website\r\n    * Write a blog and build a forum\r\n    * Run an
  online shop and accept payments\r\n    * Create email marketing campaigns\r\n    *
  Build a customer database\r\n    * Analyze and improve results\r\n\r\nHas anyone
  used a hosting service like this before? What are your thoughts?\r\n\r\nIt seems
  too good to be true, but for a designer to be able to offer all of these backend
  features quickly, easily and cost-effectively would be amazing.\r\n\r\nApologies
  again for the non-type-related post BUT, you did say anything goes!\r\n\r\nSo thanks,\r\nJay"

    a pyramid scheme. Whoever I bought from got tired of it and dropped out leaving
    my domain suddenly gone. I\u2019d go with a known hosting provider who just gives
    kickbacks for recommending clients. And keep in mind the old truism: if it sounds
    too good to be true, it probably is."

    with HQ's and hosting in Australia, Europe, Asia, and East to Weast Coasts of
    the USA. My biggest concern was that the hosting was all in Australia which is
    where most of their testimonials come from, but they are expanding hosting globally.\r\n\r\nCheck
    out their site James."

    the concept.\r\n\r\nI'd likely go with a host that offers open source options
    to the bullet point list above just to make it so the client isn't forever trapped
    in one service agreement through one reseller.\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Good point about the 'trapped' bit. I imagine that is a key component of
    their customer retention strategy. I am trying to determine if their apps are
    open-source (I imagine not).\r\n\r\nSo, just to clarify Darrel, do you think a
    lot of web hosts would offer all of these features INTEGRATED with each other?
    The core foundation of their service seems to be a CRM which maintains a database
    of all of your customers which on turn can be used to drive full email marketing
    (included), take bookings, make sales etc.\r\n\r\nMaybe I am behind on what most
    hosts offer, but to offer all of this as an integrated solution in a format that
    a client can self manage and update seems great."
