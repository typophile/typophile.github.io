  this book. I've always wanted to send in my secret(s), but time has never allowed
  me to do so. BUT anyway, if you don't already know what Post Secret is, I'll tell
  you. The book is filled with postcards that people send in anonymously (to the address
  on the cover) and each card contains a secret. \r\n\r\nI think the cover is pretty
  neat. I gives you a clue to what's inside the book, but still leaves you a little
  curious. I also like how the whole address is on the cover, a good way to get that
  out there. There's just enough detail, not too much. Not to mention, I am quite
  a fan of hand lettering which this cover appears to have.\r\n\r\nCheeeeeeck it out.\r\nhttp://postsecret.blogspot.com/\r\n"
