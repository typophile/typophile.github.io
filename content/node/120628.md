  long time to find some really great books specifically on Display typography. Sure
  there's lots of books out there that show examples and talk loosely about what's
  been done but there's also some gems with tips, in-depth analysis, and hard-and-fast
  \"rules\" to cling to or start from. \r\n\r\nWhat are people's favourites/recommendations?
  \r\n\r\nThis is out of my own curiosity and perhaps as a reference for other designers
