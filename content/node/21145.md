body: "In one of the sessions during Thursday's \"Type and Design Education Forum\"
  at TypeCon, I will be sharing an exercise aimed at improving design students' awareness
  of and sensitivity to type color.\r\n\r\nOne of the many components that effect
  the 'color' of text blocks is <em>texture</em>.\r\n\r\nMost of the terms used in
  describing text texture that I am aware of sound closer to the expressions used
  in classifying the varying sensations of <a href=\"http://zebra.sc.edu/smell/wine_glossary.html\"
  target=\"new\">wine tasting</a> -- fruity, dirty, hearty, nutty, rustic, woody,
  etc.\r\n\r\nOf the <em>texture</em> \"expressions\" I have used, here are a few
  of the key ones:\r\n- Sparkle, Dazzle, Spikey, Flowing, Weak, Thin, Heavy, Staccato,
  Contrast, Even, Flat...\r\n\r\n(Some of these expressions I learned from \"old type
  composers\" during my formative years.)\r\n\r\nQuestions --\r\nIs anyone aware of
  a resource (like a Wine Terminology glossary) that ellaborates on actual type texture
  terminology/descriptions."

    <em>fruity, dirty, hearty, nutty, rustic, woody, etc.</em> What I meant is the
    terms used in wine are \"warm/fuzzy - cold/prickly\" terms, much as in type we
    use \"spikey, sparkle\" kind of expressions for texture.\r\n\r\nI'm looking for
    a list of commonly used \"type texture\" descriptions."

    one I have seen people use on typophile, and is particularly relevant to italics.
    There is also the 'picket fence' effect, which is generally to be avoided, though
    not in some display types. \r\n\r\nHere is Tracy on ascender height: \"For my
    own taste, if x to h is a proportion of about six to ten a face will look refined
    and be pleasant to read. If the x-height is much less than that the face may be
    stylish but will be unsuitable for a long text. A larger x-height conduces to
    dullness.\"\r\n\r\nVery well said, I think.  "

  body: "I think the wine terms might be like the faces (a varietal grape equivalent
    to a class of type), and the setting and color of the type might be more like
    how a wine is paired with food\u2014the whole meal.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.winenet.com/aromawheel.html\r\n\r\nSo
    a heavy face tightly leaded with narrow margins might be highly concentrated,
    like a Bordeaux with a ribeye, basalmic vinegar on strawberries, and a sweet potato
    salad with scallions and cranberries. \r\n\r\nA Didot with airy leading and big
    margins might be effervescent and steely, like a champaign or Friuli Pinot Grigio
    with goat cheese and melon.\r\n\r\nWith wine and food, you can complement or contrast.
    Maybe the same is true of type faces and color.\r\n\r\nThis is really kinda essoteric.

  body: "I think the problem with a greyscale value is that it may not tell you enough
    about the variables.  An 18% grey may be achievable by both a light weight set
    solid or a bold weight set loose.\r\nWith the numeric system above, you could
    add another digit for letterspacing if needed. An example might be Helvetica,
    with tight letterspacing  might be a 1 and a very open letterspaced font might
    be a 9. This would give us a 4 digit number. You could also add letters or substitute
    them for a number.  The letter could stand for degree of slant or any other important
    variable.  I guess what I am getting at is that we first need to define each variable
    that we consider important and then give it a value scale.  I think esoteric descriptive
    words can be very vague.  It seems trying to emulate the Pantone matching system
    is a better idea to me than trying to emulate colors used in car paint--Zombie
    red, Caribbean Blue, Bahama Yellow say less than PMS396.\r\n\r\n\r\nChrisL"

  body: "While categorizing or developing a <em>greyscale value</em> system for text
    blocks might be useful (and in fact the more common awareness of what affects
    type color), my focus on this topic thread is about expressions for <em>texture</em>
    and not density or value of text blocks.\r\n\r\nAn example of what I mean would
    be this --\r\n(the LAST place one should evaluate type color is on screen, so
    I've used exaggerated examples here.)\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/BenguiatCond_5031.png]\r\nThe
    characteristic sharp wedged serifs of Benguiat Condensed are still prominent enough
    at text sizes of 8--12 points to create a \"<em>Spikey</em>\" look. It is the
    intrinsic nature of the face, and can either be emphasized or diminished by adjusting
    spacing/leading.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Basilia_reg_3674.png]\r\nIn
    Basilia Regular, the rounds are slighly narrow yet the counters feel open. The
    straight-to-round and round-to-round character combos unless given adequate space
    will tend to darken quickly but in contrast the counters create open holes creating
    a block of text that <em>Dazzles</em> (a term that may not really exist, but expressed
    to me by several \"type directors\" of yore). To decrease the <em>dazzle</em>
    you need to open letter spacing.\r\n\r\nThere are many characteristics in blocks
    of text that you may or may not want presented. The very reason why one text face
    may work \"better\" than another for the intent of the printed piece is based
    on these subtle and intrinsic apects of a given typeface. As you can see, this
    has less to do about the <em>lightness</em> or <em>heaviness</em> of a text block,
    but more about the <em>texture</em> or <em>flavor</em> one might say."

    Ed session is for students to evaluate <em>tonal value</em> of copy blocks...
    in other words, how light or dark one block of copy compares to another.\r\n\r\nThe
    first step in \"seeing\" type color is understanding that text is basically ink
    on paper. Type style, size, density and massing of glyphs within a given area
    equals the ink coverage... the more ink coverage the darker the tonal value.\r\n\r\nWhoever

    it's of no use for Thursday, but I'm pretty sure that Frederic Goudy made mention
    of the contributing factors of text block colour in the <a href=\"http://www.typeart.com/reference-books/typologia/typo-contents.html
    >Typologia.</a>\r\nBringhurst's Elements of Typographic Style lists four entries
    on text block colour, and I think some of the writing about Matthew Carter's work
    also includes considerations about his types' resulting overall colour on the
    page. 'Fine Print on Type' also comes to mind, although I'm not sure which section.\r\n\r\nFor
    myself, I've been known to use weather-related terminology to describe text block
    colour \u2013 from 'light drizzle' through to 'blizzard' because these terms convey
    some accompanying notion of direction and degree of noise, possibly amounting
    to what we construe as texture in this instance. I'm also pretty sure that the
    old terminology relating to textures in mezzotinting and mechanical tint-laying
    might be relevant to this."

    value\u2019 as you put it.</em>\r\n\r\nWilliam, I agree that <em>texture</em>
    is not an independent variable affecting <em>type color</em>, but it does happen
    to be one of the lesser discussed or defined aspects. My perspective is from the
    \"type user\" or typographer's point of view and less from the type designer's
    point of reference.\r\n\r\nBack during my Cg/Agfa days, I produced no less than
    six editions of their \"big\" type specimen books, each containing 5-6 lines of
    10 pt. type over 11 points of leading at 20+ pica width. (Not the one or two liners
    you see nowadays.) By maintaining these settings consistently, the user could
    make comparitive judgements regarding what cut (version) of a typeface or family
    they preferred.\r\n\r\nGetting an even and balanced color to each copy block was
    a prerequisite (as was for all printed material coming out during my watch). There
    is no doubt that even small adjustments to leading or overall tracking affect
    the <em>lightness</em> or <em>darkness</em> of a copy block.\r\n\r\nTeaching students
    and novice designers about achieving a balanced grey tone or color in text blocks
    is not too difficult to explain or demonstrate. My main concern (and the reason
    for this topic thread) is how to teach students to see the more subtle aspects
    of block copy, that each typeface and each weight/style has an intrinsic <em>feel,
    flavor, personality, texture,</em> and/or <em>flavor</em>, so to speak.\r\n\r\nIt
    just seems that there are few, if any, standard <em>terms</em> or <em>descriptions</em>
    used to express these inherent type qualities. Hence my reference to \"wine tasting\"
    glossaries, since this is an example of how an industry or user base sought to
    define subtle but discernable aspects of aroma and taste.\r\n\r\nIt would be great
    if we were able to describe a newly released italic old style as <em>gracefully
    dancing</em> at 10 through 12 point settings... and have someone understand what
    it implies."
