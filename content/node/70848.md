body: "Even after a fresh install of snow leopard Font Book just gives me problems
  every time I open up. I have around 3,000 fonts.  Once the fonts load if I try to
  click, scroll or find a font it crashes in an instant.  What is the best or a great
  Font Book alternative?  Something that can handle all of these fonts.  I don't use
  all of the fonts, I know deleting would be nice, but the job sometimes calls for
  fonts that I may need so it's good to have them in there.  Eventually I would like
  to delete some that I know I won't use but for now I really need something that
  will allow me to browse all of my fonts (and their styles) and Font Book just isn't
  doing it.  Google searches turn up free alternatives that I have tried but still
  give me the same problems.  Thanks.\r\n\r\nbtw, running on a Macbook Pro 17\" with
  6 gigs of Ram and 500gb HD, so the system can handle it, the software is my problem."

    be careful not to delete any fonts that your software depend on.

    at once is going to cause problems no matter what font manager you use. You seem
    confident that \"the system can handle it\". I'm not so sure about that. Even
    if it is possible, I can't even imagine trying to scroll through a font menu with
    that many loaded.\r\n\r\nExtensis has a nice guide to managing fonts on Macs.
    It has useful information even if you don't use their product (Suitcase):\r\n\r\nhttp://www.extensis.com/en/downloads/document_download.jsp?docId=5600039"

  body: "thanks, this is a nice program. i actually had almost 9000 fonts. (Font Book
    would also crash around 3,000 and I never actually went into the folders to confirm
    until now) No wonder I couldn't open Keynote or Word. Deleted them all but system
    fonts, gonna stay up all night and start installing the ones i really need. \r\n\r\nand
    thanks for the extensis info. I'm starting to realize my practice of having this
    many fonts this unorganized is a bad idea. Day One of my new life starts tonight."

    I am really excited about Extensis. This thing is awesome. '

  body: "Usually, if someone has 9000 fonts it means he\u2019s downloaded a lot of
    free fonts or some torrent with commercial fonts. I\u2019m not necessarily saying
    you\u2019re in any of those categories, but I\u2019m saying no one really needs
    that many. Choose wisely when you buy fonts! IMO, a handful of quality stuff is
    way better than thousands. You\u2019ll get familiar with the few and learn how
    to use them best, and you\u2019ll value them higher."
