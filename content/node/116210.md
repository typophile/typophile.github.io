  numbers, \r\nwho are not es high and thick as upeper case letters?\r\nCan somebody
  tell me why?\r\n\r\nThanks a lot.\r\n\r\n"

  body: The standard  numerals in most fonts are designed to fit optimally in tabular
    matter, and don't always fit well in paragraphs of text or headlines. When combining
    numerals with text, choose a font that has old style figures, like Georgia. When
    setting numerals in a headline of all caps (e.g., CELEBRATING 100 YEARS), use
    lining (also known as modern) figures and increase the size by a point or two
    to match the cap height.

  body: Lining (modern) figures are monospaced, even when the other glyphs are not.
    When setting lining figures in a headline, you'll want to kern them for the best
    optical fit.

  body: "Thank you @PublishingMojo.\r\nI know how to use different styles of numbers.\r\nBut
    if you look in detail at Myriad pro, you will see the numbers are not exactly
    reaching the ascenderline.\r\nAnd more the steams are not as think."

  body: "Type designers often choose not to align numerals with cap height or lowercase
    ascenders. If the user disagrees with the type designer's decision, he or she
    can manually adjust the height of the numerals, or use a different font.\r\nI
    hope that's a helpful answer. Maybe your question has more to do with what informs
    a type designer's decision to make the numerals taller or shorter, or to make
    the stems thicker or thinner, and I'll have to leave it to other Typophiles to
    answer that question.\r\n"

  body: "What you have observed is a compromise.\r\nThe size and weight of the \uFB01gures
    you describe are somewhere between capitals and lower case.\r\nTherefore, they
    are not overpowering in upper and lower case text, yet still function fairly well
    in all-cap settings.\r\n\r\nHowever, now that we have the OpenType format that
    permits thousands of glyphs in a font, it is possible to include many different
    \uFB01gure (number) styles in a font, each designed to work in a certain kind
    of setting.\r\n\r\nMy current practice is to make the default \uFB01gures \u201Cthree-quarter\u201D
    height, lining, and tabular.\r\nThe old style and proportional variants are accessible
    in the \uFB01gures section of the OpenType menu in applications such as InDesign,
    while there are variants for small caps that are activated in the Small Caps feature,
    and variants for all-cap setting that are activated in the All Caps (case) feature.\r\n\r\nHere
    is how I proliferated the \uFB01gures in Scotch Modern:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/figs_6304.png]\r\n\r\nA

    are two separate issues which are not necessarily related. \r\n\r\nWhat Nick said
    about compromising to more-or-less work with both case settings is the most important
    rationale for shorter figures. Making them a different height than caps also disambiguates
    some: a zero and an O will be more distinct."

    I don't think <em>compromise</em> is what's always happening; for example hybrid
