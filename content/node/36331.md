  a packaging company. They are married to the panther in the logo and do not want
  to omit it. I have included the original logo I have to work from and two of my
  proposed designs.\r\n\r\nPlease let me know what you think.\r\n\r\n\r\nOriginal
  Logo\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/PkgAll-logo-2-1_6710.gif]\r\n\r\nMy

  body: "I like the first set of revisions over the second set, even though the tag
    line seems lonely.\r\n\r\nYou're revision of the panther head is abit Thundercats-esque.
    Not to mention, unfriendly.\r\n[Thundercats Logo: <a href=\"http://www.stickergirl.com/images/Thundercats.jpg\">http://www.stickergirl.com/images/Thundercats.jpg</a>]\r\n\r\nYou
    might want to consider bringing the entire body back to illustrate the agility
    of Package All.\r\n "

  body: Explore. Explore. Explore. I can see a several adaptations that would probably
    work much more effectively. There is a larger question with your 'concepts'. What
    is the tone of messaging, and how does that influence the style of visuals your
    using in the design of the mark/logo? The original logo, although lacking, has
    a softer feel and an approachable sense to it. What you've created is bold, harsh,
    and very masculine. Consider what has been created in the past with this company,
    and use a more subtle transition.

  body: "I totally agree that the new panther looks \"unfriendly\", and that without
    the body, it's lost its dynamic.\r\n\r\nI like that you've tweak down the size
    of \"P\" and \"A\" in the second group. However, I think you overdid it -- the
    \"ll\" being taller than the \"A\" looks rather irritating and makes the whole
    logo unbalanced.\r\n\r\nThe \"w\" in \"we go the distance.\" should be capital,
    otherwise it's pseudo-modern hip-hop -- frivolous and unfit for a business. Alternatively,
    you could loose the period (\"we go the distance\") -- not capticalizing the first
    letter is more excusable if the line isn't a complete sentence."

    original posting), the lower panther also strongly reminds me of Voltron... which
    may not be the vibe they're looking for ;)\r\n\r\n----======*======----\r\n\"If

  body: "I like option 2. But the slogan is probably misplaced and too small if the
    logo is decreased to certain formats. The Serif compliments the icon. Good choice.\r\n\r\nDavid

  body: The original one is quite flowing and friendly, where as the new version is
    very bold and dramatic.
