body: I found this face in a little town on the French/Spanish border called Luz Saint
  Sauveur. It appears on the metal plaques used for street names etc, I cant find
  anything exactly like it anywhere, it looks very similar to some of the DIN typefaces,
  but has several subtle differences.

  body: "Alphabets used for metal plate stamping are usually specially designed for
    this technology. They have no equivalent in digital type, unless someone digitises
    them afterwards, like Verena Gerlach and Ole Sch\xE4fer did with <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/fontfont/ff_city_street_type/\">FF
    City Type</a> for example."

  body: "I've begun to digitize it after looking already and not finding anything
    to match, I'm pretty new to the whole process and struggling with the letters
    i don't have to work from particularly 's' and 'v' which appear to reside outside
    of the grid. does anyone know of good typo design aids or have any pointers?\r\n\r\nhere
    are my attempts so far:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/IMG00233_4788.jpg]"

  body: 'The plaque has been cut with a tool much like a router, as opposed to pressed.
    This would suggest to me that it was done on CAD driven machine, wouldn''t this
    mean the existence of a digital version somewhere? '
