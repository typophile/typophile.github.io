body: "Hi,\r\n\r\nI am in the process of developing a logotype. I started off with
  an uppercase B set in Foundry Wilson and combined it with part of a serif of an
  uppercase \u2018B\u2019 set in French script. I then chopped off the serif from
  the top left corner of the Foundry Wilson \u2018B\u2019 and rounded it off. I quite
  like the quirky shape that comes out of it. \r\n\r\nMy Logotype will have three
  words. I thought it might be easier to use a san serif font instead of the Foundry
  Wilson, as it is easier to add to a character than subtract. \r\n\r\nFor this project
  I am looking for a sans serif with varying stroke thicknesses, similar to that of
  Foundry Wilson. Any ideas?\r\n\r\nClient restrictions mean that I cannot post the
  B on the Internet. Sorry!\r\n"
