  you gurus.\r\n\r\nI was hoping someone could help me ID two separate fonts, or suggest
  possible alternatives: 1) company logo (attached), and 2) Smythson's custom \"Brook
  Street\" lettering -- can be found at www.smythson.com while customizing \"Personalised
  Stationery.\" \r\n\r\nThank you for your time and help!"

  body: "1) As previously said, very generic, nothing really specific. Suggestions
    by Alex look fine to me.\r\n2) sorry, don't understand what you want exactly...
    Do you mean \"Bond Street\"? Because I wasn't able to spot any \"Brook Street\"
    lettering anywhere... For the rest, Smythson identity has been designed by [[http://saturday-london.com/category/clients/smythson/|Saturday]].
    They may use some bespoke typeface for all their materials. On their website,
    thery're using [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/hvdfonts/brandon-grotesque/|Brandon
    Grotesque]] and [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/adobe/electra/|Electra Display]]
    but I suppose it's not the one you're after.\r\nFor the rest, can't get out of
    my head that main woodmark SMYTHSON could be easily done starting with some [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/efscangraphic/futura-sh/xlight/|Futura
    Extra Light]] manually extending differently each letter. It's some sort [[http://www.myfonts.com/search/engravers+gothic/|Engravers
    Gothic]]/[[http://www.myfonts.com/search/blair/|Blair]]/[[http://www.myfonts.com/search/sackers+gothic/|Sackers
    Gothic]] extended.\r\nSome more \"Futura-like\" (letters needing to be stretched:

    Definitely very close to some Engravers Gothic/Blair/Sackers Gothic, for the caps
