  :) \r\n\r\nI'm looking for a look-a-like (preferably free) of the font Nyx.  Here's
  a link to the original font:\r\nhttp://www.fonts.com/FindFonts/detail.htm?pid=202867
  \ It doesen't have to be *exactly* alike, but the closer the better.\r\n\r\nI appreciate
  the help!"

    find something that looks the same, you may have to spend the money on the legitimate
    font.\r\n\r\nOff the top of my head, La Bamba with a white stroke applied might
    be close. I think it was included with some versions of Office or Photoshop.\r\n\r\n

  body: It's a sad reality that reseller sites like Fonts.com do not always list complete
    designer credit information, and ours (FontShop.com) is no exception. We do try
    to add info where it's missing, but when the foundries don't supply it from the
    beginning, that's often the root of the problem.

  body: "Stephen is abolutely right! All resellers try to nail as much info as they
    can. At Linotype.com, we have the following information about Nyx:\r\n\r\nDesigner:
    Rick Cusick\r\nNyx is a stencil typeface designed by lettering artist Rick Cusick
    and named after the designer\xB4s muse: the Greek goddess of night. Classic roman
    capital forms underlie its sharp, energetic surface. Nyx first began to take shape
    as hand lettering on the artist\xB4s New Year\xB4s greeting card. It later appeared
    in several art exhibits of Cusick\xB4s work before it was digitized and refined
    on the computer. Gallant and spartan at once, Nyx infuses music CD liners, toys,
    games, and magazine titles with dash and daring. (Nyx is a trademark of Adobe
    Systems Incorporated which may be registered in certain jurisdictions.)\r\n\r\nSadly,
    I haven't got a year for Nyx. On the Linotype.com webshop, I always tried to get
    in a designer name, a release year, and some sort of description (in that order
    of importance). There is also a designer page for most designers, but Rick's just
    repeats the info for Nyx -- http://www.linotype.com/353/rickcusick.html\r\n\r\nOn
    the flip side, all of our Nyx info is at least Bi-Lingual; we have it in German
    on our German website, too.\r\n\r\nAs for a free similar font, I don't know of
    any, and honestly, it'd be a bit difficult. Rick is a great calligrapher, and
    well, for a similar font you'd probably need to find a free font designer whose
    a great calligrapher, too. But if you look at Nyx and the way it was created,
    maybe you could find a designer who makes free fonts who works in similar manners
    or from similar inspirations. But in terms of the time you'd spend searching,
    it might be more cost effective for your project just to license the font."

  body: Oh well!  Thanks anyway.  I rememeber when it was free once upon a time.  Had
    a blast with it.  I don't mind if I have to buy it, because it is a cool font.

  body: I don't think it was ever free. Perhaps it came bundled with software, but
    it's always been a commercial typeface requiring a license.
