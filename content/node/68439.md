body: "Hello all,\r\n\r\nBelow is a logo about which I'd like to get your professional
  opinions. Many of the letterforms were redrawn and I'm now too close to it to see
  its inconsistencies. I'm looking for any constructive recommendations about refining
  the details (stroke width consistency, kerning, etc.)\r\n\r\nStylistically speaking,
  the logo will not be changed, but I suppose I could hear any related comments there,
  too. \r\n\r\nThanks kindly,\r\nRay\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Forsight-Innovation-Logo_5102.png]\r\n\r\n"

  body: Not a professional opinion, but the leg of R looks foreign in the otherwise
    geometrical set of characters. Also O-N is kerned too loosely.

  body: "I like this type a lot. It has a nice soft and stable character. It's true
    that \"R\" has a curved tail, but that puts a special twist into it. I like it.
    But... The only thing I don't like is the length/width of this logo. So you could
    ask yourself this:\r\n\r\nDo both words have equal importance or should one be
    more emphasized/remembered?\r\nIs the company doing any everyday stuff not just
    innovating?\r\n\r\n...\r\n\r\nYou've probably guessed where these questions are
    taking. I think that word \"innovation\" has a lesser meaning. But I may be wrong.
    Even though if they don't bare the same weight, what can you do? Can you change
    one of the two in a way so it won't become disturbing and unpleasant? I think
    you can. But make sure you don't create a seen-it-before logo out of it.\r\n\r\nIf
    both words will stay the way they are right now, you could put one over the other
    to make your logo narrower."

  body: "Thanks for your feedback, guys.\r\n\r\n<em>@apankrat</em> I can't believe
    I overlooked the kerning of O-N. Thanks for pointing it out! : /\r\n\r\n<em>@litera</em>
    There is a stacked version of this logo that gives less significance to \"Innovation\",
    but for the purposes of this evaluation, I  wanted to show all the letterforms
    at equal size.\r\n\r\nGreat! Please keep it coming!"

    get lost in the depths of the site because it's not on the homepage anymore?\r\n\r\n;

  body: "Maybe your question was too vague. Maybe you should ask better questions?
    So if you needed kerning suggestions you should as that. FIRST.\r\n\r\nThe other
    possibility is that people think you've made it ok.\r\n\r\nAnd BTW: I don't think
    anyone looks at homepage alone. Your post is high and visible in Logo area anyway."

    to me.
