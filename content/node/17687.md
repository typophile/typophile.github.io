  freedom to make a title sequence for a show called \"Settlers\".\r\nIm a little
  stuck for ideas as they want it to have a more contempory feel.The main ideas being
  \"firmly grounded\" and bringing the past into the present, as opposed to taking
  the viewer back in time.\r\nI have attatched some crap i thought of but Any fonts
  or suggestions would be great."

    it all be inspired from that. As they stand, your two choices seem more historic
    than modern.

    will occur to you.

  body: "The show consists of celebrities discussing there heritage,how certain personality
    traits they have, may have come from there ancestral background. \r\n\"What did
    the Settler's contribute to the modern Kiwi personality?\"\r\n\r\nI have thought
    about the above comments and they have both helped,\r\nanother idea i had was
    to show the letters grown out of the \"S\" so each letter represents a generation..which
    inturn has come back to the last \"S\"?...so maybe a font which has character
    that is strongly revolved around the curves of an \"S\".\r\n\r\n"
