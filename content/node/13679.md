  is a digital [[type technology]] originaly developed by [[Sampo Kaasila]] of [[Apple|Apple,
  Ink]], whose remit was to create a custom technology so as to avoid paying royalty
  fees to use font technologies developed by other parties, as well as to solve some
  technical limitations of [[Adobe|Adobe's]] [[PostScript]] based [[Type 1]] font
  format. TrueType differs from Type 1 in that it uses [[quadratic beziers|quadratic]]
  as opposed to [[cubic beziers|cubic]] [[bezier curves]]. TrueType excels at on-screen
  rendering due to the fact that it can support sophisticated [[hinting]] instructions.
  The technology was cross-licensed with a [[Microsoft]] replacement for [[PostScript]]
  called [[TrueImage]], but today only TrueType survives. A few years later the format
  was extended to support [[Unicode]] and more complex linguistic and typographic
  behaviours such as automatic ligature substitution and Indic vowel rearrangement.
  However the new extensions, called [[AAT]] (Apple Advanced Typography), were not
  licensed to Microsoft, who then set about creating their own extensions to TrueType
  (along with [[Adobe]]), which they called [[OpenType]]. The two extensions are incompatible
  and whilst their feature sets overlap, there are many things that one can do which
  is impossible with the other.\r\n\r\nFor other articles on TrueType, see:\r\n* http://www.microsoft.com/typography/WhatIsTrueType.mspx\r\n*
