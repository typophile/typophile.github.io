  body: I have seen many filters for getting the color to resemble specific film stocks.
    I have not seen any for grain but I bet they exist. It's also probably true that
    "grain" is stock specific and that you need quite a big file to make the grain
    feel "natural". What's your context?

    with that and blurring, at a particular image resolution, and fine tune it in
    relation to the final output resolution/rendering."

    \r\nhttp://powerretouche.com/\r\n\r\nIt's reasonablely priced. (over onOne which
    is shockingly expensive and shite).\r\n\r\nWhen you open it you can select some
    effects that look like types of film. And you can add B&W filters such as Orange.
    \r\n\r\nIt has settings to mimic Kodak TriX400, TMax100, Ilford HP5, Delta100,

    mentioned above; I worked several years with traditional cameras such as minolta
    and leica m, and now i am working with a digital leica; once coupled with exposure
