  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">I'm choosing a typeface for a magazine, and I've decided that Baskerville is the one for me. The magazine is meant to have a sober, timeless feeling to it, without being intimidating or stuffy, and I feel that Baskerville hits all the right notes in that regard.
Now the problem becomes, which one? I'm choosing between several versions, including Linotype, URW++, Monotype, ITC, and Storm's Baskerville Original Pro. 

We're printing on both uncoated and coated stock, usually at 9pt size. I've found that the first version I bought, from URW, tends to look too thick, and doesn't quite have the level of readability and lightness that I want. Of course, I could buy them all and experiment, but we're a small independent magazine, and the budget's not there for that.

I'd love to hear if anyone has an opinion about their favorite version of Baskerville, and why. Thank you!</div>

I wonder what technology Dragon magazine was using to set type in 1983, and how that would have resulted in fake italics?</div>

		<div class="commentbody">As you may have guessed by now, I'm using Dragon magazines from the mid-'80s as my model for type choices. At that time, they were fitting 1500+ words per page. I've measured their type, and as near as I can tell by comparing it to my own printouts, it's nine point Baskerville. It's possible they were using ITC, but it doesn't look like it to me. You can see for yourself in the sample I posted above.</div>

I'm still holding on to hope that Monotype's Baskerville will work for me, but as you point out, it may not be suitable at that size.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Mid-1980s means the magazine was probably phototypeset and the font would almost certainly have been provided by the manufacturer of the equipment. I’m only familiar with some of the Compugraphic machines from that time. I don’t know if they had their own version of Baskerville, but I wouldn’t doubt it. Compugraphic was swallowed by Agfa, which was then taken over by Monotype, if I recall my consolidations correctly.

Skyfonts.com has four different Baskervilles you can try out for free if you join the beta programme. (Have your specimen sheet template ready beforehand; they’re only free for five minutes at a time.)

		<div class="commentbody">Jayson, maybe I'm late to the party, but: Monotype's and Storm's are at the opposite sides in terms of darkness and readability, the former being the lighter and the latter being the heavier. I'm not sure that Monotype's digital version would be the best choice for a magazine setting. Fountain's revival is an elegant rendition but maybe a bit too stiff for my taste; it also lacks the lining figures in the italics and doesn't have a bold (which could be limiting in a magazine). Storm's version looks like a more faithful rendition (compared to others), but I see its design more appropriate for books with a classical feel rather than contemporary magazines. For what is worth, I think that ITC New Baskerville, in its apparent averageness, is still the best Baskerville option for a magazine text setting. The sample you posted - fake italics apart - seems set in ITC's to me.</div>
