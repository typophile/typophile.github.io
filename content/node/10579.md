    target="_blank">DIN Condensed Black</a> with some tweaking to the O and C might
    work for RADIOACTIVE. You may also want to check <a href="http://www.dafont.com/en"
    target="_blank">DaFont</a>&#39;s Russian section, but it seems to be down right
    now. <BR> <BR>MAN could be approximated by <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/redrooster/phosphate-rr/solid/testdrive.html?s=MAN&amp;p=48"
    target="_blank">Phosphate Solid</a>. <BR> <BR>The other fonts on the cover seem
    to be <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/futura/extra-bold/testdrive.html?s=BART+SIMPSON%27S+FAVORITE+COMIC+BOOK%21&amp;p=16"
    target="_blank">Futura Extra Bold</a> and <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/futura/heavy/testdrive.html?s=INTRODUCING+THE+GREATEST+HERO+OF+THEM+ALL%21+DON%27T+MISS...&amp;p=16"
    target="_blank">Futura Heavy</a>. That last one could be Futura Medium, it&#39;s
    hard to tell. <BR> <BR> - Lex
