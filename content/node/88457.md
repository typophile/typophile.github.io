  big news item of the day, the death of Kim Jong-Il. What could Perry get so wrong
  about the late North Korean dictator...? His name. \"In an email statement regarding
  the death of North Korean dictator Kim Jong-Il, Rick Perry mistakenly referred to
  the despot as Kim Jong the Second,\" reports Think Progress. (The posting on Perry's
  website has since been updated with the correct spelling.) We see what happened:
  <strong>some sans-serif news brief on his death tripped up a Perry PR person, as
  a upper-case I and a lower-case l next to one another can easily be mistaken for
  \"II\" -- i.e., \"the Second.\"</strong> But Kim Jong-Il was a regular old tyrant,
  not a monarch, which is probably something a presidential candidate (or at least
  the team surrounding him) should know. But Perry has excelled at not knowing things
  during his presidential campaign.</blockquote>\r\n \r\n[[http://www.theatlanticwire.com/politics/2011/12/perrys-latest-oops-kim-jong-second/46394/|link]]\r\n
  \r\nA failure of type design? Or a public service by the type designer, exposing
  the shallowness of understanding of the candidates for high office? :)"

    referring to \u201CKim Jong Two\u201D, until his staff changed the senator's notes
    to read \u201CKim Jong Ill\u201D, spelling out the pronunciation. Then, apparently
    Helms started talking about \u201CKim Jong the Third.\u201D\r\n\r\n(Also quoted
    from the above link.)"

  body: "I had just seen a news item about someone referring to Kim Jong-Il as the
    \"brutal dictator of North Dakota\". And then in Taiwan, outrage at a satire of
    the tearful announcer informing North Koreans of their Dear Leader's death led
    to a resignation at a TV station or network - of their news director.\r\n\r\nBut
    turning \"Il\" into \"II\" was something I missed."
