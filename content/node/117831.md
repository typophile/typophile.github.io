  the internet and have no idea where to turn for answers. I am very NEW to the love
  of Typography so please forgive my ignorance that exists on many levels.\r\n\r\nSince
  my newly found appreciation for fonts, font families and typeset in general, I have
  realised a painful truth that I have many unnecessary and ugly fonts on my machine.
  I learned about font managers and how they can help sort and manage all of my fonts.
  So, after a bit of research, I settled on and downloaded Nexus Font, eager to begin.
  It sounded like a great, easy solution... until I actually tried to figure out where
  to start this whole process. I began with copying my Window/Fonts folder to a new
  location on a separate but local drive. \r\n\r\nThis is where my confusion begins
  because the copied folder doesn't resemble my actual Windows/Fonts folder at all.
  There are many many fonts in my copied folder that do not even show up in my Windows/Fonts
  folder. Most of these have a red \"A\" icon associated with them and (I think) they
  are system fonts or something . Anyway... some of these fonts are listed SEVERAL
  times in the copied folder I created and some seem to be \"greyed out\" as if they
  are there but not installed. I'm very confused by this and am not sure how to proceed.
  I am currently using Windows Vista. Can anyone help me understand this a little
  better?\r\n\r\nThanks in advance,\r\n\r\nJasmineSkunk"
