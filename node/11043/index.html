<div class="post-content e-content" itemprop=articleBody>My intention was to create a type by first taking type and then manipulate it using light and shadow, which then deteriorated the letterform. <br>This is my first typeface design.

<div class=commentbody>It looks like wrinkled tinfoil. I'm not sure if the name "remnant" works, since the majority of the letter is still there. It's definitely something that can be used as a display, but if you just took an existing typeface and applied filters to it, there may be legal issues. It's a good start though.</div>

<div class=commentbody> <i>...if you just took an existing typeface and <br>applied filters to it, there may be legal issues</i> <br> <br>I have heard this sort of thing said before and <br>I am wondering if that is really true. In the US, <br>a type <i>design</i> cannot be copywritten. As I <br>understand it, the name can be protected but <br>not the design itself. <br> <br>Ethically, I am totally convinced it would be <br>wrong to directly copy someone else's work. <br> <br>But what would the legal issues be? <br> <br>-smc</div>

<div class=commentbody>Sorry I haven't gotten back to all of you sooner. I was just reminded by a friend of mine that I had some responses. <br>I guess I need to explain my process a little more. To start with I took a typeface, made some alterations, crumpled the paper, took digital pictures of each individual letterform in 3 different light settings. Then I took these images and manipulated them in Streamline. The high contrast and conversion I applied helped erase my letterforms to my goal. I hope this helps. Also, in response to Eduardo- I actually think the Frothy typeface looks very similar to a fellow student's design-Tetanus. I think it is also posted on here. Both Frothy and Tetnus remind me a lot of Baskerville. <br>For legallity purposes, I'm not intending to sell this. Just for personal use and for my class project. Thank you!</div>

<div class=commentbody>Hi, Beth. <br> <br><i>>I actually think the Frothy typeface looks very similar to a <br>fellow student's design.</i> <br> <br>I didn't mean that your Remnant <i>looks</i> similar to Frothy. <br>I just put those links above just as "reminder". Taking an existing <br>typeface and changing it, it's not as innovative as it may sound. <br> <br>Can I ask you a question? Why did you choose Stone Sans to <br>play with? It was the same typeface used in Frothy. <br> <br> <br><i>>Both Frothy and Tetnus remind me a lot of Baskerville.</i> <br> <br>I don't wanna be picky, but how can a modern serif typeface <br>remind you of a nineties grunge one? ;-) <br> <br></div>

<div class=commentbody>Eduardo- I understand you were sharing with me what you thought was similar. I also understand that changing an existing typeface is not so good. What I wanted to do, was to work with it and to create a typeface that appeared unwanted, used, and all that remained was this new design. I didn't realize that I along with the Frothy designer had such a pull to Stone Sans. Just kind of odd I guess. I thought Tetnus looked a bit like Baskerville because I think that is one of the types she used to base her typeface on. <br> <br>On another note, any suggestions on what to use this typeface on? I'm trying to brainstorm for my specimen posters......just looking for open feedback from everyone. I am hoping for a better idea than for a landfill flyer. Thanks!!!</div>
