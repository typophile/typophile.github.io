body: Recently ran across a typeface in Baseline 45, page 12.  <BR> <BR>Kurt Hauert
  designed a logo in the 1960s for Chaussures Au Centre, a shoe house. The caption
  mentions he drew this specifically for them. <BR> <BR>Does anyone know of a face
  that might be based on these letterforms, or a typeface that was the source/reference
  for Hauert&#39;s design? The &#39;s&#39; and &#39;a&#39; are particularly intriguing.
  <BR> <BR>Thank you. <BR> <BR>Dennis Mabry <BR> <BR>... <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/51613.gif"

  body: Brazilia is the closest thing I have seen so far. Thanks for the response,
    Yves.  <BR> <BR>... <BR> <BR>Does anyone know the history behind Brazilia? I&#39;ve
    seen references to &#34;PL&#34;; does that refer to a foundry? <BR> <BR>I understand
    the design is owned by Agfa, but know little of Brazilia&#39;s background and/or
    historical examples it may be based on. <BR> <BR>Thanks, <BR> <BR>Dennis <BR>
