  magnets.\r\n\r\nI'm aware of other fridge magnets that typically use Vag and cooper
  black style typefaces.\r\n\r\nAny help would be very much appreciated!\r\n\r\nGary"

  body: It looks like Futura Bold accept for the 'q'. Maybe that letter was customized
    for clarity...?

  body: "If it is Futura bold the j was modified too.  It would look just like the
    i if it wasn't.  The c certainly looks like Futura bold.\r\n\r\nI don't think
    these are real frig magnets.  The dots on the i and j aren't connected.  And aren't
    frig magnets usually in all caps?"

    fridge magnets, they went on a metal board, had cheap bar magnets snapped into
    the back. The dots were connected by thin bits of the plastic.\r\n\r\nThese images
    are \"3D\" re-creations of the originals."
