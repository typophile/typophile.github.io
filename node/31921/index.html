  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>If you were building the ultimate font management software what features would you add?</p>
<p>My suggestions will be based on Extensis Suitcase for Windows, the &ldquo;Missing Features&rdquo; and design changes:</p>
<p>•I love the simplistic approach Suitcase takes, but it&rsquo;s missing features that seem apparent to me? Such as, Drag and Drop file management, in the key of iTunes. It creates a data base/file management system without me having to keep up with it.</p>
<p>•To be able to maintain rich data about the fonts I use, including Foundry, Style and Family and any other information that I&rsquo;d find useful for finding and using my fonts. I could sort through on demand by columns such as name, styles, weights, foundry, designer, category or whatever. Such as sorting all the sans serif fonts by simply clicking a tab/column that would make life so much easier.</p>
<p>•A quick &ldquo;Mix&rdquo; feature using keywords or drag and drop to create &ldquo;Sets&rdquo;. Just like iTunes.</p>
<p>•A character counter for quick viewing and a detailed pop-out character map. Since the advent of OpenType, Character maps can get up into the 1000s for a single font, it would be nice to see all of those characters before activating a font.</p>
<p>•Font Management should appear easy, I feel as if I do a lot of &ldquo;maintenance&rdquo; outside of the software and that should be the softwares job.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d like to hear what some of your thoughts are for features you&rsquo;d like to see.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I really have no complaints about Font Explorer. It&rsquo;s attractive (much more so than Fontbook) and seems to have all the features I require. I guess it&rsquo;s not always easy to track down foundry detail - which was a nice feature of Font Reserve - but that isn&rsquo;t that important to me.</p>
<p>It would be nice to be able to sort by style without having to create sets like I do, but that would probably require the foundries to tag their fonts.</p>
<p>When I installed Font Explorer I basically devoted most of a day to creating sets that were useful to me. Every now and then I decide to add a new set and have to page through thousands of fonts to find ones that fit the categories. But basically, as in iTunes, once you set it up then as you add new fonts it&rsquo;s pretty easy to maintain.</p>
<p>And, as mentioned above, it&rsquo;s free! Plus unlike iTunes it doesn&rsquo;t direct you to a store every chance it gets.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m in a windows environment, so I don&rsquo;t have access to Font Explorer, which sounds like a much better application than Suitcase. Regardless, I think a lot of the &ldquo;font management&rdquo; apps out there don&rsquo;t actually give much help in the way of managing one&rsquo;s fonts.</p>
<p>Example: I collect fonts piecemeal. I try to organize them into folders on my hard drive based on Foundry, and then add them to Suitcase creating Sets based on that font;s Style. It&rsquo;s a laborious process that If I would accidentally delete a set, I&rsquo;m pretty much screwed till I find the time to &ldquo;re-manage&rdquo; my font collection.</p>
<p>If the actual software keep track of my fonts for me, this wouldn&rsquo;t be much of an issue, and then if I could set-up a keywords/tags for specific fonts to help me find them faster, that would be another piece in the management issue I have with Suitcase.</p>
<p>In essence, Suitcase isn&rsquo;t a font management application, it&rsquo;s a font activation tool and that&rsquo;s about it&rsquo;s limits.</p>

<p>FR for the PC hasn&rsquo;t been updated for ages and isn&rsquo;t very pretty, but it does exactly what I want it to do: quickly enter text samples and scroll through the fonts I have with lightning-like speed.

<p>Really? How does spotlight help you manage fonts? Can it automatically activate fonts when you open an application - and deactivate them when you close it? Sort your fonts by style? Create a set that shows you to view all your sans serifs at once? Allow you to type in text for a preview? Give you a character map? I&rsquo;m baffled.</p>

<p>I was referring to Andrew&rsquo;s comment:</p>
<p><cite>In essence, Suitcase isn’t a font management application, it’s a font activation tool and that’s about it’s limits.</cite></p>
<p>I use FontExplorer similarly. The software is just there for activating fonts, but when it comes to actually managing the fonts I usually just use spotlight to grab a file by name and fire it up, as opposed to the old method of just dumping every single font into a management app and dealing with them all that way. I don&rsquo;t really do much with sets; most of the sets I&rsquo;ve set up only became sets because FontExplorer does it automatically when I add families, it isn&rsquo;t something I need to do on my own. As for type previews, I don&rsquo;t find myself using that feature very often because just seeing the words set in FontExplorer is usually too detached from context to be especially helpful.</p>

<p>sii, as far as I know Suitcase is the only font manager that really addresses this issue. The new Suitcase for Windows implements the same Font Sense technology from Suitcase Fusion. When a font is added to the database, a unique identifier is created based on several values within the font. It&rsquo;s similar to a checksum. During auto-activation, this can be used to distinguish between different fonts of the same name.</p>
<p>The other advantage of Font Sense is that it could be used to match up metadata. I wish Suitcase had a good way to import/export metadata. I  think I want everything filip blazek lists. Lots of metadata&ndash; the ability to sort and group by metadata&ndash;and the ability to share it.</p>
<p>A related feature that I consider critical is the ability to back up data. There&rsquo;s no point creating a bunch of sets and adding metadata if I don&rsquo;t have the ability to back up this effort or  migrate it to a new system. I probably replace my laptop every 18 months. I back it up once a month. If my current hd dies, I know  that I can restore my setup. On  Suitcase for Windows, this can now be accomplished by restoring the Vault to the same relative location. However, I consider  it a necessary feature for any font manager.</p>
<p>In the professional publishing world, some of these features are accomodated by client/server font management solutions like Font Reserve Server.</p>

<p>I agree, this is a major key point in font management, what&rsquo;s the point of putting all the effort and time into managing your fonts if in a short period of time you&rsquo;ll have to do it again to another computer. This would be especially helpful in terms of migrating data across multiple computer if you don&rsquo;t have a server system. Like in a school computer lab, everyone uses the same fonts, why can&rsquo;t they create a &ldquo;default&rdquo; group of sets and port them to all the computers that might not be setup on a server.</p>

<p>Idealistic, but not practical for the single user.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>For Font Explorer I would assume (but have not tried) that if you bring all the application support - preferences, cache, etc that your sets would be preserved. I&rsquo;ve certainly done that with other apps.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s interesting the different things people look for in a font management tool. I honestly don&rsquo;t understand anyone who sees Font Explorer or Suitcase as just an activation tool, that is a limited use of a sophisticated application (altho I will point out that Andrew is using windows). As a designer I really rely on the sets I&rsquo;ve set up as a starting point. I want to use a sans but am tired of falling back on TheSans or Scala so I browse thru my sans et voila, Abadi. Haven&rsquo;t used that in years.</p>
<p>But it just points up the different ways designers work I guess.</p>
<p>I think that if you absolutely need Comic Sans - any version - you should consider switching careers.</p>

<p>I might not have said it, but I use sets too. I have them currently for styles only: Sans, Serif, Rounded, Script and so on. My complaint isn&rsquo;t the ability to set these up, but that &ldquo;I&rdquo; have to set them up and maintain them, and if for some reason I delete said sets, I don&rsquo;t have them backed up anywhere and would essentially have to recommit the time and effort that I already committed to setting up new sets. In my eyes, that&rsquo;s not font management. It&rsquo;s a lot of work for a small part of the design process (no offense to the part fonts play in design, just the tool to get the fonts into the process.)</p>
<p>And I am on a Windows system, which I&rsquo;ve noted before has been shunned against by Extensis. I&rsquo;m no dummy I can see all the great features available in Suitcase Fusion for Mac. Why can&rsquo;t I have those same features in my Windows version?</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>My advice to you Andrew is DON&rsquo;T DELETE THE SETS.</p>
<p>Just kidding. As I said above, tho, more sophisticated tagging - i.e. that didn&rsquo;t require manual  maintenance from the user - would require the foundries themselves to tag the fonts and it probably wouldn&rsquo;t be retroactive anyway to the fonts you already own. I don&rsquo;t see how you can expect a font management tool to instinctively &ldquo;know&rdquo; how to organize your fonts. I think categorizing your fonts is NOT a small part of the design process. It&rsquo;s a time commitment up front, when you first load the fonts in, but not a lot of work to maintain and update as you add new fonts. And if you don&rsquo;t delete them, there&rsquo;s no problem.</p>
<p>Yes it&rsquo;s nice that in iTunes a lot of the songs come already tagged by genre but personally I end up labeling them quite often myself.</p>
<p>Personally I prefer the option of making my own categories anyway.</p>

There is an expanded Font Management area which allows the grouped listings you can expand.  And the preview windows are amazing.  You have so many ways to view your fonts.  It&rsquo;s very fast and it loads an icon with access to your font groups in windows startup.  Just click the icon and check which of your folders you want to install/uninstall.</p>
<p>A couple of things I haven&rsquo;t figured out yet but I think I&rsquo;ll like it.
Lots of features for only $35.</p>
