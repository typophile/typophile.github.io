<div class="post-content e-content" itemprop=articleBody>Hi everyone,
I've just "felt" on this old logotype that I created for me [ Dr Duckling | Design care ] when I started as a freelancer.
I happen to really like it and want it to be a part of my visual identity again.
So I thought I should make some improvements on it since I think that the old version really needed a "ravalement de façade"...
So the logo on top is the old one the new version is the one below.
Can you guys tell me what you think?
Thanks.</div>
<div class="comment card m-3">
<div class=card-body>
<div class=commentbody>Ok, maybe I should let you know about the symbolic work behind this logotype :
- visually evoke the 3 Ds in "Dr Duckling | Design..."
- visually evoke the C of "...Care"
- the C also shapes a moon "croissant", which I find very symbolic for women, which I am...
- using a bird's eye because a duckling is a bird (still)
- using an eye to evoke (æsthetic) vision as it seems to be appropriate and reflects a designer's maybe most important quality
- the whole symbol is definitely inspired my native americans ones (as you may have noticed already), and this particular one was meant to protect (care...) and also to suggest an anticipative vision (watch, obsverse, be aware, anticipate) which is also very much part of a designer's job to me.
Ok I really don't think what I said is clear here, one more time sorry for my poor english...

<div class=commentbody>I prefer the top one. I didn't see the three D's at once or the C but I'm not sure that matters. I'm a bit bothered tho by the white shape (neg space) inside the inner D to the left of the circle, or eye. I'm not sure why you rounded the corners or angled it outward towards the circle. It doesn't seem to fit in with the other shapes. I also think the thickness of the middle or white D should be even as it is in the outer D. </div>

<div class=card-body>
<div class=commentbody>the explanation helped.. i didn't notice the bird's eye when i first saw it. I prefer the bottom version.
the first thing that struck me was that the logo kind of vanishes into nothing on the right hand side. I got used to that after a while though.
What i would arrange would be the outer shape of the eye. I would do away with the 3 'D's and focus on making the shape of the eye more flowing and organic on the left hand side. </div>

<div class=commentbody>That's exactly what I was trying to do, giving it more of an organic shape while respecting the Indian spirit / graphic style of the symbol. What do you suggest ?
And I really want to keep the different ways to read it, the different reading layers / levels (the 3 Ds, etc.).

<div class=commentbody>I like the bottom version better. I find the strict geometry of the top one too cold. The bottom one is more organic, and it appeals to me more.
[img:sites/default/files/old-images/improve2_4896.gif]
a) I like the round corners at the top opposing the square corners at the bottom, but I think you need to work on the curves. The counter thickens through the curve.
b) The two inner counters share a sameness in the bottom version, which I like. I like the croissant better. The eye is harder to read. Maybe the first of the inner counters should be shorter, vertically, to give the pupil more prominence(?)</div>

<div class=commentbody>what i suggest is basically what i said before.. namely - perhaps rounding the edges substantially on the left hand side cos it's looking abit too angular when compared to the right hand side.

<div class=commentbody>The female version adds a certain amount of whimsy to the logo, which isn't bad. But I lean towards masculine version because it reminds me of West Coast native art. However, why a French graphic designer would want a logo that evokes North American native art confuses me. (Unless you also illustrate in that style???) So maybe the whimsical female version is better. I don't know. I'm afraid I'm not being very helpful.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Yes, I know this type of artwork very well and it is, of course, directly inspired from it...
I guess I have to work on it over and over again until I find out what's wrong.
I just know that I wanna keep it simple and balanced. But, on the other hand, I LOVE elegant, refined, ornaments... Aren't there anybody who just finds it super well crafted ? =)
I'm gonna start to think about the colors maybe it'll help somehow...

<div class=commentbody>Tim: That's a beautiful print! I'm a big fan of that kinda stuff. However, I must point out that it is not Inuit. It is Kwakiutl. The Kwakiutl are one of the tribes that live along the west coast of Canada. They are master woodcarvers, best known for their totem poles, cedar longhouses and ceremonial masks. But their artwork also encompasses stone sculpture, jewellery, painting and printmaking. Your kingfisher is a truly wonderful example of the graphic Kwakiutl style. Black and red are the traditional colours. Sometimes a dark green or blue is added. How long have you had the print?
Cheers, Ken

<div class=commentbody>Virginie: It's one of those silly English expressions, I guess, meaning "extremely very".
That being said, I have a cedar carving of a whale that a friend of mine, who's Musqueam/Coast Salish, did, and it's got some of the same elements. :-) Some of the distinctions between the various groups are very subtle.
Tim: There are a number of websites out there that track West Coast prints. I'd google "Kwakiutl Kingfisher" and see what sort of hits you get. I bought what was purported to be an "original" Inuit print last year that turned out to be essentially worthless, but your gran may well have left you something worthy of extra insurance.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Tim: I've been on the website of the Royal B.C. Museum. And I found in their collection a couple of silkscreen prints by a gentleman named Jimmy Johnny. This is one:
[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Cannibal-Bird_5171.gif]
This piece is titled "Kwaguilth Cannibal Bird" (in the lower left corner), and is signed "J.Johnny". It was acquired by the museum during the late '70s. Jimmy is Coast Salish, not Kwakiutl or Haida. The museum tells me he illustrates in the Kwakwaka'wakw style. Whatever that is. Anyway, I think Jimmy is the artist of your Kingfisher.
Virginie: Sorry, I think I've been hijacking this thread. How is your logo coming along. Have you decided on the female or male version? (or, couldn't you use both: the whimsical female one when you want to be on top ;-) and the male one when you want that West Coast feel?)</div>

<div class=commentbody>I think I like the masculine version better, probably for most of the same reason as Ken -- I guess when you know West Coast art somewhat, when you find something that's close but with a twist, the twist seems out of place.
(Tim: I did a search. If yours has an edition number out of 600, it's worth around 50 quid here in Canada at auction.)</div>

<div class=commentbody>Linda and Ken, Thank you for your research, when I have some time free I will certainly look into it further, but as you say Virginie’s thread seems to be diverted, so if I find out any more I'll start a new one, in the meantime I’ll just enjoy it:)

<div class=commentbody>Lol, no problem! ;-)
Check out the print section of this website, it is really beautiful and very inspiring stuff.

I'm still refining the logotype, and I'll post the new version as soon as I think it's finished. I'm doing more research on native art but I'm also at a customizing (and coloring...) stage of it to fit my "message" / identity...
Thx a lot for all your interesting posts.

<div class=commentbody>I did a quick re-work of your logo using Tim's Kingfisher as reference:
[img:sites/default/files/old-images/improve3a_5650.gif]
I don't think it's any improvement over your original. To my mind, the feather-shape and the croissant-shape are fighting. So I'm leaning more and more toward your female version.
Cheers, Ken</div>

<div class=commentbody>Thank you for your rework, Ken. It's pretty nice and very interesting !
The thing is, when I created this logotype, I was defenitely inspired by native art but I don't really want it to be exactly like their art, it's just a (strong) inspiration. That's why I haven't used the red and black bichromie thing yet (and probably won't...) and try to make it lean towards more an organic shape. I haven't worked on it for a couple of days to "let it breathe" a little bit... I'll post my future improvement soon.
Typophile website was unreachable for a few days, that was annoying... It's been happening a lot lately, I hope the problem is solved !
