  What I need is the font that makes up the majority of the \"Performance Technology\"
  logo. I know that the T and P have been customized for the logo, but the rest of
  the words seem to just be one font.\r\n\r\nAlso, if you guys could find the Mountain
  River font too, that would be fantastic. I can make those words myself if I needed
  too, but it would be much easier if I had the real font.\r\n\r\nTHANKS!\r\n"

    poor quality of the image provided: you can\u2019t identify what you cannot clearly
    discern. That being said, Vorpal looks to be a good kinda-sorta match\u2026"

    match so I figured the picture didn't need to be too perfect. It was all I had
    anyways.\r\n\r\nThanks again!"
