body: "I have an idea for a typography site. The site would be community-based and
  populated kind of like a wiki. Without saying too much, the site would ask members
  to download a Flash file, export a swf for sIFR use, and upload to the site.\r\n\r\nThe
  swf file would be engineered to only work on the site, and also be watermarked.
  The site would then display it for educational and inspirational purposes, and most
  definitely not redistribute them (not that they could in any usable manner considering
  the user never upload the fonts or original Flash file, only the swf) and most definitely
  not be selling fonts.\r\n\r\nConsidering no one besides the site in question would
  be able to use the swf, would this be illegal? Technically, I don't think the site
  would be doing anything illegal, but they may be asking people to violate their
  license with their fonts.\r\n\r\nI have been researching as much as possible, but
  this is a grey area for which I am unable to really find a good answer. I am very
  curious to hear some opinions."

  body: "Yes, I am :D\r\n\r\nI'm trying to be vague because it really will be an amazing
    site. I want to display the fonts for, once again, educational and inspirational
    purposes, and sIFR would make it that much more useful. The other option would
    be just gifs or pngs, but I would hate to be tied to a specific size. I realize
    some foundries may have problems with sIFR, Emigre is probably one off the top
    of my head, but if the font software isn't being redistributed or sold, would
    this be in violation?\r\n\r\nI have a deep love for type and would never want
    to harm designers or their interests (which is why I'm trying to make sure I'm
    going about this the right way)."

  body: While the concept is interesting it will never work as most foundries have
    some sort of embedding clause that would disallow this kind of activity. Besides
    this, most reseller and/or foundries are already coming up with better solutions
    for font testing which in turn most people can use to study a typeface.

    out what to do here. Unfortunately, I can't reveal precisely what it is just yet.
    Trust me, I would love to tell all right now, but I have to wait. I've been working
    very hard with other to make this happen, and I would hate for everyone's work
    to be lost. But this is getting away from the point.\r\n\r\nIt's basically a question
    of better interactivity or not. And what the expense of that better interactivity
    is. If it infringes on copyrights, then it will probably have to go."

    You get a bunch of designers to say that it is not a copyright infringement, post
    your site, and find out that it is, and you might wind up in legal hot water.
