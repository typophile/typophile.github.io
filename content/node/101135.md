  - one shows a US advertisement for an adding machine, the other is taken from a
  type writer. Slight variations on the same font as far as I can tell.\r\n\r\nThank
  you for your help!\r\n"

  body: I tried to insert an image of a font for identification but got the message
    "could not copy image. Error"  It is 500 px wide so that shouldn't be the problem.
    Any suggestions. I'm totally new to this.

    not like spaces or perhaps some other characters so keep the name simple."

    the mid 30's, the black and gold one 1925 and probably earlier.\r\nRyuk- as always
    many thanks- some good leads. You think they're both custom jobs then? The second
    image with the upward slanting serifs has totally stumped me. Does the attached
    clearer image cast any light on it at all?\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/typophile4_3755.jpg]"

    state they're both custom job. My knowledge is far from being encyclopedic or
    academic. I've never learned type design and its history. My suggestions are mainly
    based on visual memory and online resources (digital).\r\n<blockquote>The second
    image with the upward slanting serifs has totally stumped me. Does the attached

    they're close, they don't look the same to me.\r\nI've compiled some more using
