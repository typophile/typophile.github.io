    Adigo</a> has some similarities. I think it is custom; here is a close up on the
    type on their website (via flash), you can see how rough and hand-drawn it appears.
    It could have been drawn by Mr. Clowes or somebody and then auto-traced.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/closeupasc_5249.png]"

    from zooming in, on the flash parts. <em>( Ive seen this before, even the 'best'
    and 'cleanest' typeface becomes rough and uneven, when 'used' in flash, and later
    zoomed in on. Flash seems to automatically reduce / remove as much unnecessary
    parts, paths and points as possible, when exporting / publishing. )</em>\r\n\r\nDav\r\n\r\nEdit-A-Bit:
    Two more alternates, though: '<a href=\"http://www.houseind.com/index.php?page=showfont&id=15\"

    target=\"_blnak\">Gala</a>', based on the original 'Neon' typeface, by / from
    Nebiolo."

  body: "Dav, I have to disagree about Gala, because the E (for one thing) isn't found
    in that font. It looks more like <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/redrooster/quest-rr/\">Red
    Rooster's Quest</a> to me, but the letters look more monotone. Geoff's choice
    of Adigo could have done it, with the W reversed to make the M.\r\n\r\n- Mike

  body: "Looks a lot like one of those generic photo-headline fonts like the ones
    on page 166 in the Solotype catalog. Solo give names to them (\"Gay Gothic\",
    \"Gyro Gothic\", \"Gala Gothic\", etc.), but in the old VGC catalog, the same
    fonts only have numbers (\"B-12\", \"B-14\", \"B-15\", etc.).\r\n\r\nIncidentally,
    I think it's pretty likely that they made custom fonts for the movie promo stuff
    based on Clowes' lettering. In turn, I am sure Clowes was inspired by seeing fonts
    like the ones mentioned here in developing his distinctive lettering style."
