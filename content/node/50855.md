    make-ready knife, bodkin, tweezers, shorter ruler, etc.\r\n\r\nBut does it have
    enough other pockets for all the other gear a compositor or typesetter needs?
    \r\n\r\nSuch as a long pocket for a 12\" line gauge. & big waist pockets for palm
    rules, cigarettes, matches, bottle opener, and general composing room detritus?
    \r\n\r\nI can't tell from the photo.\r\n\r\npowers\r\n\r\n"

  body: Nope, this one  just has a small narrow pocket. A second edition may use a
    different apron.

  body: Lovely apron and hat! I actually I thinking the same the other day. I do use
    a apron yellow, red and white, like the sky is all lilies ... I was considering
    a brown approach, but now with the bargain, I may end up loosing my hat.

    these days I suspect that the hat will be too small.
