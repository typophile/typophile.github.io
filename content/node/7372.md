  body: Phew, without lowercase it&#39;s not going to be easy to ID the typeface.  <BR>I
    thought Bembo, but the open bowl on the P doesn&#39;t match.

  body: 'Well, Baskerville&#39;s fonts were used to print the works of Voltaire, but
    that was towards the end of the 18th century, not around the middle as the date
    there says. Plus the &#34;E&#34; is not Baskerville. <BR> <BR>Serge, do you have
    a better scan, or maybe some publication info? <BR> <BR>Also, I have to ask: how
    close do you need to come, and would that include the &#34;weathered&#34; look?
    <BR> <BR>hhp'

  body: Thank you all! <BR> <BR>This is the title of the very first edition of Candide.
    <BR>I got this image from the web.  <BR>I think I can create the &#34;weathered&#34;
    look myself but I would like to know what font would be used at the time when
    Voltaires&#39; works were published.

  body: You need to look at the offerings of the French foundries around that time,
    like at Deberny. Look to the articles by Ovink in Quaerendo, as well as the works
    by Audin and Thibaudeau. <BR> <BR>But actually, Baskerville became very fashionable
    in France shortly after Voltaire &#40;and continues to hold a special place in
    French publishing&#41; so it might be the best choice. On the other hand, its
    design goes against the &#34;antique&#34; look. <BR> <BR>hhp
