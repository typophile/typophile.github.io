body: Just digging through some old photos and found this image of Filip Blazek, Franta
  Storm and Jim Grieshaber from a pub in Prague. Jim & I took a side trip from the
  ATypI Leipzig 2000 (after landing in Germany and heading directly to Oktoberfest
  in Munich)  I recall leaving this dark pub and then realizing it was still mid afternoon.
