  card topic i think the own invoice is part of your CD <BR>and as it includes lots
  more text and typographic things than <BR>a business card i would find it quite
  interessting to see invoices <BR>done by typo-experts <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"
  ALT=":-&#41;" BORDER=0> another reason for this is that i started <BR>my own business
  4 days ago and also need to have a complete <BR>business pack incl. invoice and
  stuff.  <BR>so if it&#39;s ok for you please post some of your own invoice &#40;with
  <BR>dummy text of course&#41;. that would be great. thanks: lars'
