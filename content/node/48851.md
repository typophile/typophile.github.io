body: "A tie-in to some of the other discussions relating user modification and/or
  supplementing of an existing font -- something I'm quite conscious about, since
  I already may <em>have</em> broken the EULA, or at least stretched it to a breaking
  point!\r\n\r\nMy main field of typesetting is in linguistics. Not your average translation
  stuff, but the university side: descriptional (languages from all over the world
  -- I stopped counting), historical (Proto-Indic; but also 17c English), orthographic
  (showing different forms of the capital of '\u014B' -- \"eng\" -- there are at least
  two varieties), and phonetic /f\u0259\u02C8n\u025Bt\u026Ak/ -- not all browsers
  will display the required characters!\r\n\r\nThere are lots of phonetic fonts out
  there, but a lot are put together by willing amateurs (non Unicode; missing italic,
  bold, and bold italic), and there are certainly none even close to the base font
  I use for plain text. So I[*] created a Unicode compliant set of additional characters
  as a stand-alone font, in all required styles. And here comes the snag.\r\n\r\nAn
  upside down 'e' in this font is created by copying a base font 'e' and inverting
  it. A small capital 'R' (that's the uvular trill; not a regular American \"arrr\"
  but the clear one in \"gar\xE7on\") is copied plainly from the base font small caps
  set. It has to be copied because it has a Unicode point of its own! The voiceless
  retroflex plosive (don't ask me -- I didn't make up the names) looks like this '\u0288'
  -- a lowercase 't' with a lowered bottom, shaped more like a 'j'. And so on -- the
  characters are all based on Latin, but may have any amount of alterations.\r\n\r\nIt
  gets worse with added accents: acutes and carons are readily available, usually
  already in combination with often-used characters. But I need them up/under/through
  virtually any possible character, and sometimes even stacked upon eachother! No
  worries: I copy all available accents directly from the base font, add a few handfuls
  of ones Adobe didn't think of (small plus above; inverted breve; lots more), create
  OTF tables to combine them in a fashionable way with my own extended set of glyphs
  ... and <em>then</em> I need the same for the <em>regular</em> set of Latin characters!
  So I copied <em>these</em> as well -- 'a' to 'z' -- and copy their kerning tables
  too, then position the accents for these as well,. That's where my conscience really
  began to work. To be totally in control, I would need to add even more characters
  from the original font, virtually up to the moment I would not even need the original.
  I might as well put <em>my</em> entire set into the <em>original</em> font!\r\n\r\nIt
  has been mentioned that Adobe doesn't mind adjusting fonts for 'private use', but,
  as this is to be put in books, that seems stretching their indulgance quite a lot,
  even though this new font has no commercial purpose on itself. I have no intentions
  at all to sell it as 'the' linguistic set, and up to now I am extremely wary of
  sharing it, even within the publishing cy I do this work for.\r\n\r\nWho can sooth
  my worries? Alternatively, what <em>can</em> I do without having to worry about
  the Font Police?\r\n\r\n[*] TBTH, building heavily upon the work of a previous colleague,
  who had a large part in the initial development. But now I'm on my own."

  body: "I have a lot of respect for those devoted souls, including Victor Gaultney
    and the folks at SIL, for producing fonts with extensive diacritics such as Gentium,
    Doulos, etc.: Unicode has little practical use without fonts that actually implement
    the many characters for which it standardizes encodings.\r\n\r\nHowever, I work
    as a typesetter, and need to offer customers more than a handful of typeface choices.
    \ Sure, I can suggest editors persuade authors to submit manuscripts with Sanskrit
    diacritics rendered in Time Roman Ext.  However, journals that have always used,
    say, Monotype Baskerville, would like to see those diacritics rendered in Baskerville;
    and, by the way, as journals increasingly move on-line, they\u2019d like those
    diacritics coded in Unicode.  I can tell editors that Monotype might not be a
    good choice, on grounds its current font licenses both forbid modification and
    require additional licensing for electronic publications, and point out that there
    are other fish in the sea.  And for some projects Gentium, SIL Doulos, or Times
    Roman Ext really might work very well.  But for many jobs designers will insist
    on more variety.\r\n\r\nScholars are certainly grateful for fonts with large character
    sets, but I\u2019m also pretty sure they don\u2019t want all their publications
    to look the same.  And from a practical point of view, I doubt universal fonts
    will ever be the answer: as readers of the Typophile forums know better than most,
    adding ever more characters is not trivial.  I think instead that typesetters,
    and the scholarly world in general, need a variety of fonts that can be expanded
    as required for a particular piece of text.\r\n\r\nJudging by their font licensing,
    I think Adobe understands this.  I\u2019m also encouraged by Adobe\u2019s push
    for SING glyphlets, developed as a means for adding characters without actually
    modifying the underlying font.  Some such facility is essential for setting East
    Asian languages, where large dictionaries contain more characters than almost
    any font.  I have heard very little about glyphlets recently, but I'm hoping Adobe
    will migrate the technology to versions of InDesign other than Japanese. "

    for \"customary and internal business use\" is permitted, provided that the modified
    font isn't distributed. Whether selling books printed using that font falls within
    that is hard to tell, but the general drift of that part of the FAQ seems to be
    that it's OK as long as you are neither selling nor otherwise distributing the
    modified font software - i.e., that the font file itself is staying \"internal\"
    to the business. Or at least that's what I've assumed, since I've had to do similar
    work (although for epigraphy rather than linguistics). I'd be interested to know
    if anyone knows otherwise.\r\n\r\nWhen I've had to do this with fonts from vendors
    that don't allow modification, the obvious workaround (assuming I need to match
    existing glyphs for parts of the shapes) is to print out specimens and draw my
    own outlines around them, and generate the new glyphs in a stand-alone font. I'd
    never distribute those either, but it does get around the license issue if you
    don't use their vectors at all."

    the urge to modify the original one.\r\n\r\n\"Important\" ... I think it's pretty
    important books look good. Using another font for some characters Does Not Look
    Good. I am not sure if the readers appreciate the effort; best case I can imagine
    is that they never even noticed!"

    make a difference. It\u2019s usage is still within bounds of fair use. \r\n\r\nExample:
    years ago I combined a regular font and an expert font so I would have old style
    figures in the base font. For good measure I added a few dingbats (using spots
    for glyphs  that would never be used in this situation). This way I could use
    ONE font instead of THREE when doing the layout of a magazine. Of course I paid
    for all three.\r\n\r\nYou can put your conscience to rest, Theunis.\r\n\r\n. .
