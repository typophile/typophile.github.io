  someone asks, let it be known that \"Metrics - Roman Only\" is primarily for Japanese
  typography. It works by applying kerning only to \"Roman\" glyphs defined by anything
  that can be rotated in vertical text. This option will affect any Latin character
  (Basic Latin, Latin-1 Supplement, Latin Extended, etc.) and half width Katakana
  (U+FF61, U+FF9F).\r\n\r\nSo, \"Metrics - Roman Only\" works just like the \"Auto\"
  option, but instead of using all the kerning data available (or not) in the font,
  it uses only a subset of it.\r\n\r\n"

  body: "I should qualify this by stating that the 'kern' (and 'vkrn' for vertical
    writing) GPOS features that are present in some OpenType Japanese fonts include
    kerning pairs for kana and Japanese punctuation. To give you an example of a high-frequency
    kana string that benefits from kerning, consider \u3057\u3066 (\"shi\" and \"te\").\r\n\r\nI
    should also point out that when Japanese text is kerned, the 'pwid' (or 'vpal'
    for vertical writing) GPOS features are also turned on, because the values in
    the 'kern' (and 'vkrn') GPOS features depend on them.\r\n\r\nDr. Ken Lunde\r\nSenior

  body: "Wow, I think this option seems to be very cool and useful solution for setting
    Latin characters in vertical writing.\r\nLet me make sure that, to be available
    for this option, does the font need to have vpal and vkrn features?\r\n"

  body: "This brings up a good point.\r\n\r\nWhen the text is horizontal, it is clear
    that the 'kern' (plus 'pwid' in the case of the otherwise full-width Japanese
    characters, when the \"Metrics - Roman Only\" option is not enabled) GPOS feature
    encapsulates the kerning information.\r\n\r\nHowever, vertical writing brings
    with it two complications. The first is that there are effectively two orientations
    possible for proportional Latin glyphs. The default is rotated 90 degrees clockwise.
    The Paragraph Panel includes an option called \"Roman rotation in Vertical Text\"
    that will unrotate the glyphs, so that they are stacked. The complication is to
    which orientation are the kerning values applied? The kerning values are set assuming
    that the glyphs are set side-by-side, not stacked. This means that there may be
    no way to set the 'kern' GSUB feature to handle the glyphs when they are stacked.
    And, it also means that InDesign (or any text or layout engine for that matter)
    should disable kerning when the glyphs are stacked.\r\n\r\nNow for the second
    complication. For the default (rotated 90 degrees clockwise), InDesign ignores
    the built-in (to most Japanese fonts) 'vrt2' GSUB feature that substitutes the
    standard (horizontal) forms with their pre-rotated counterparts, and mechanically
    rotates the glyphs. This then begs the question: is the 'vkrn' GPOS feature used,
    or is the 'kern' GPOS feature used instead, and its values attached to the mechanically-rotated
    forms? If I had to wager, I would guess the latter. When we designed the 'vkrn'
    GPOS feature, we set the values assuming that the 'vrt2' GSUB feature is used
    to access the pre-rotated Latin glyphs.\r\n\r\nI see that this can truly become
    the proverbial \"can or worms.\" \r\n\r\nDr. Ken Lunde\r\nSenior Computer Scientist,
