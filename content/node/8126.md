body: I heard about this microbrewery today on NPR&#39;s Weekend Edition. I must say
  that this is the funniest website that I&#39;ve seen in a good two weeks or so.
  <BR> <BR>Additionally, they&#39;ve made use of some sort of faux-latin lettering
  for their beer bottle labels, which is no surprise. Certainly quite different from
  the beer labels I see every day

    Some of <a href="http://www.jewcy.com/product.html" target="_blank">this stuff</a>
    is in bad taste too - with the requisite faux-Hebrew letters - but most is pretty
    funny, which is a saving grace, if I may use the expression!

    very good. I had the Messianic Stout &#40;&#39;the beer you&#39;ve been waiting
    for&#39;&#41;, and was disappointed.

    beer of choice at the moment is a religious beer of another sort

    Is it just me, or in fact does everyone seem like an idiot on beer commercials
    on TV?

    <BR> <BR>The best religious beers I&#39;ve found readily available in North America
    are the Trappist <a href="http://www.chimay.be/">Chimay</a> beers from Belgium.

    <BR>The best beer I&#39;ve ever had was in Boston once: a Rhubarb Lambic. Unfortunately,
    the waitress was one of those who grabs bottles as soon as you set them down,
    so the name of the brewery and other details weren&#39;t able to imprint on my
    mind, and I&#39;ve never found it since &#40;not even at Monks&#41;.'
