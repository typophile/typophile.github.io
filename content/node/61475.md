body: "I found this in the book Titled 'From Idea to Building'.\r\nThe font looks
  exactly like Palatino, but with \r\na straighter terminal to the italic f. The book
  was \r\npublished in 1992 in Britain. \r\nCan anyone please help identify the font?\r\n\r\n(I
  checked all 'similar' fonts listed in Identifont \r\nbut couldn't find this one.)\r\n"

    version is better with more defined details which aid reader cognition. "

  body: "It's certainly Palatino. It's possible that the type was set in Monotype,
    and the malformed ascender on the <strong>f</strong> is what they used to call
    a broken letter, a place where the metal of the type got dented in handling. \r\nUntil
    the 1970s, most books were set on the Linotype or Monotype, and the printing plates
    were made with negatives shot from repro proofs. This process didn't disappear
    in the US until well into the 1980s, and may have hung on a bit longer in the
    UK."

    but surely that was not the question \u2026"

  body: "\"Book Antiqua\" is Palatino by another name. This was discussed before,
    as I recall, and I think it might have been a Microsoft name for the font.\r\n\r\n-
