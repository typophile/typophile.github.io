  convention booth.  As of now, the size of the posters is going to be three feet
  by six feet.  \r\n\r\nI like the general design here so far, but I feel that the
  script font at the bottom is a bit illegible, and could do for a little bit of a
  change to something a bit more legible, but with a similar feel.  \r\n\r\nIf anyone
  has any suggestions for a font, or anything on the design as a whole, feel free
  to comment away.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/3x6BGsmall_6660.jpg]\r\n\r\nAlso.
  \ This is my first project of this.. magnitude as a freelance designer.  Can anyone
  reference a good place to look to get an idea of where to start for pricing this
  project?  There are several banners involved, as well as designing some images to
  be shown on a few televisions around the booth.\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Make the kerning a bit looser and consistent for both text blocks at the
    moment it is working against the character of Scriptina which in turn is affecting
    the legibility, the bar in the headline appears to be off centre because of the
    shape of the W and if you have genuine small caps it would help the weight differences
    in the title. If these are floor-length you might need to move everything up.\r\n\r\nTim"

    is also a nice alternative.

  body: "i agree with stephen that ambiance could be a better choice for the script.
    to my mind, scriptina is pretty played at the moment -- i might have to go a year
    or two without seeing it before i can appreciate it without rolling my eyes.\r\n\r\nin
    any case, all the type here -- serif and script -- is kerned a bit too tightly
    to be comfortable.\r\n\r\ni like the weathered nostalgia of the design. you might
    try making the lighter 'torn paperish' edge on the left a little narrower; being
    both so light and so vertical, it will still have a lot of impact without dominating
    the design.\r\n\r\njust some thoughts."
