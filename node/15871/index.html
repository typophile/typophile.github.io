  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>Hello, this is a school assignment, we´re supposed to &ldquo;redesign&rdquo; a corporate identity keeping some of the elements from the original idea. My first problem is that my teacher really doesn´t like AvantGarde, he didn´t want me to use it (because it´s &ldquo;old and overused&rdquo;) but since I insisted in keeping it he said I should alter it somehow, that´s what I did on the third logo. The first one is the original design.</p>
<p>What are your ideas about altering typefaces? I have this idea that the original design of a typeface probably took a lot of effort from its original designer and altering it is somehow bad, specially in this case, altering it just to &ldquo;look different from avantgarde&rdquo;. I built &ldquo;a&rdquo; and &ldquo;g&rdquo; from &ldquo;o&rdquo; and &ldquo;t&rdquo; and altered &ldquo;e&rdquo; and &ldquo;c&rdquo;. I´m worried that &ldquo;a&rdquo; has a chance of being read like an &ldquo;o&rdquo;, specially in small sizes and I think the &ldquo;g&rdquo; looks too much like number &ldquo;9&rdquo;, maybe that´s one of the reasons Lubalin didn´t design it this way&hellip;</p>
<p>What are your opinions about this? Should I keep the original design of AvantGarde or the altered version? Would you suggest any other highly geometric typeface? I did some testing with Futura but I really don´t like its &ldquo;c&rdquo;, looks somewaht incomplete to me.</p>
<p>The leaves are supposed to express the idea of their tagline &ldquo;high technology applied to agriculture&rdquo;, the first two leaves are more organic, the last two completely geometric, the middle one is a mix of both&hellip; Any other suggestions? Kerning? Colors? Any ideas would be really appreciated. Thanks. :)</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>If your teacher&rsquo;s dislike of Avant Garde is purely due to its age and popularity I would say that is a pretty bad reason to start altering it. The trick is to make well known types fresh again through good design.</p>
<p>I think that the success of your treatment should be based on contrasting the geometric, technical quality of the letterforms with a more organic leaf shape. The first leaf looks a bit too &lsquo;drawn&rsquo;, and the diamond shaped leaves seem a bit unorganic.</p>
<p>Maybe a leaf should grow from the stem of the &rsquo;t' to form the cross bar?</p>
<p>If you do decide to change the letterforms then you need to look at where the stems and bowls of the &lsquo;a&rsquo; and &lsquo;g&rsquo; meet. If you look closely there is a lot more white space in the original because the stroke that forms the bowl is not actually a consistent width. This may help avoid the &lsquo;a&rsquo; looks like &lsquo;o&rsquo; problem that you mentioned.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Yeah! I agree with Chris G! Tell your teacher to shove it! Ask for a proper reason why you shouldn&rsquo;t use it. I remember a teacher telling me not to use Clarendon because it looks too old-fashoned, and it&rsquo;s now one of my favourite typefaces and used on my logo! Rebellion!</p>
<p>I prefer the tighter letter spacing on the 2nd two ideas and think there&rsquo;s more in them than the first.</p>
<p>The positioning of the seedling in the first breaks up the word in the wrong place, whereas in the other 2 it breaks the &lsquo;agro&rsquo; from the &lsquo;tec&rsquo; which I imagine is the idea.</p>

		<div class="commentbody">I like the angular leaves of the second two. There are a lot of leafy logos out there, but the color of your geometric shapes emparts the idea that they&rsquo;re techno-leafs well enough to be different, I&rsquo;d say.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">well, i wouldn&rsquo;t tell you teacher to &ldquo;shove it&rdquo;, but i would question him/her. &ldquo;just because they don&rsquo;t like it&rdquo; isn&rsquo;t reason enough for a teacher to tell you not to use a typeface. if he/she can&rsquo;t articulate a reason beyond taste i might be so-inclined to agree with the afore-mentioned insult. =^P</div>
