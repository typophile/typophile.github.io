body: "Several of us toil away with pens, brushes and other \"wet\" tools. We have
  varying associations with BCP's at different points in time.\r\n\r\nWhether it is
  slick or rough, type or titling all of us ply our trade with a firm background in
  having made letters by hand for many years. The computer is just another tool used
  in the process as opposed to the genesis. \r\n\r\nWe just thought we would put up
  a WIDE variety of takes on the alphabet.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Gerard_4528.jpg]\r\n\r\nThis
  piece is by Gerard Huerta. He will throw in on this tomorrow. What is important
  is that the \"script\" began as a refined pencil that was illuminated later on the
  computer. I think I have one of his last inked pieces of lettering.\r\n\r\nI figured
  since Gerard went slick I would go abstract in the first round to give contrast.
  A clock conceived around the letter S (very loosely based on Versals from the 12th
  century.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/clock_4449.jpg]\r\n\r\nMore
  to come from others and we hope you will join in if you see fit. Hopefully we can
  show the diversity of the hand writ form.\r\n\r\nMichael\r\n"

    ago in the mid 80's, with a biro on a restaurant napkin at lunch and then re-lettered
    with a pointed brush (Windsor & Newton series 7 # 3) on 3 ply Bristol Board. I
    used it for my personal logo for a few years. A group of us were looking through
    a new calligraphy book at the time and this piece was inspired by the work of
    Jean Larcher, I think (poor memory).\r\nLater when I turned to the dark side (computers)
    I redrew it in Freehand.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/InkwellWP_3674.jpg]"

    children and then had Peter Thornton, well known gold leaf master, do one for
    each. My children's first initials are J, J and K... hence the 2JK.To my dismay
    my daughters now sport it, one on her neck and the other on her undie line.\r\n\r\nGood

    have now given me an  amazing idea.  I have had a phoenix in mind for a very long
    time.  But with the prolific nature of such a symbol, I have been reluctant.  However,
    if it is gestural enough....  Ideas.  thank you so much!\r\n\r\nMichael:  Children
    have a wonderful way of misappopriating ideas, dont they?"

    Pretty obvious all of a sudden.\r\n\r\nI hand lettered 20 issues of [[http://www.heavydutypress.com/books/sphere/milkcrate/|<cite>The
    Sphere</cite>]], a grocery zine advertising my family's [[http://www.koppas.com|grocery
    store]] between September 1993 and September 1995. These pages are from the 12th
    issue. I was fresh out of college, had taken one calligraphy class my sophomore
    year, and wrote the entire thing with three weights of disposable Staedtler pens.
    If you check out the link above, you'll see that I developed a few different \"fonts\"
    to use throughout the rag.\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/2_5243.7_10.jpeg][img:sites/default/files/old-images/2_4853.7_20.jpeg][img:sites/default/files/old-images/2_3445.7_7.jpeg]"

    ones saying \"greetings\", \"happy saint patrick's day\", etc.)\r\nBut most of
    the work other people posted is great as well, like the sigar club emblem, and
    the different sketch pages."
