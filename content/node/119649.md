body: "Hi everyone\r\n\r\nI have just signed up to Typophile, finally, after years
  of casual browsing and checking in on the forums.\r\n\r\nI am working on a logo
  for my company, 'Bird & Co', the name I use for small freelance jobs outside of
  my usual day-to-day. I usually team up with specialists such as copywriters etc,
  hence 'Co'.\r\n\r\nMy thoughts for the overall branding is to keep things clean
  and simple, discretely, so that the work speaks for itself. I have been a long admired
  Caslon IV's Two Line English Egyptian, so used this as a base (and to indulge in
  personal taste). \r\n\r\nLogo needs to work at small and large sizes, positive and
  negative\r\n\r\nI have developed something I am largely happy with, but know the
  details are not there yet. I am hoping for input to help make this 'sing'!\r\n\r\nWeight,
  kerning, proportions, letterforms, all up for any / all comments\r\n\r\nThanks very
  much\r\nChristian\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/LogoDraft1_6573.png]"

  body: "Hi there,\r\n\r\ntype looks good \u2013 although it might be a little too
    loose, especially around the \"I\". But maybe that's just me.\r\n\r\nI think the
    small ampersand lets the brand appear really big. It looks like Bird & Co is a
    large company and/or institution that has many subsidiaries. If that's what you
    want, I'd keep the ampersand smaller than the rest of the letters, because it
    visually separates \"Bird\" from \"Co\", by introducing a second font size, which
    makes it two instead of one, thus provoking the feeling of \"many\" (at least
    to me and maybe only very subtle).\r\n\r\nI don't know how you want your clients
    to perceive your business. Maybe you want them to believe you are a big company.
    Maybe you don't. In the latter case, I suggest you make the ampersand the same
    size as the other letters to achieve a somewhat uniformed look. Why? I think it
    communicates integrity. It looks like you are working so closely with your partner
    specialists that your clients don't even realize there are so many different parties
    involved.\r\n\r\nIt really depends on how you want your clients to perceive your
    business. One more question regarding this: will you be the only one who invoices
    your client or will your partners send their own invoices?\r\n\r\nIf you are the
    only one who handles payment, I suggest you decide whether you want to appear
    big (small ampersand) or small (normal ampersand).\r\n\r\nIf your client will
    receive several invoices, I suggest you clearly separate yourself from your partners
    by getting rid of \"& CO\". If you are only invoicing your own services, there's
    no need to mention other working partners in your company name.\r\n\r\nAnyway,
    it looks good :)"

  body: "> you decide whether you want to appear big ... or small \r\n\r\nNormally
    businesses prefer to look big, but you bring up a good point. It's common for
    designers to be part of a team but I would only use \"& Co\" unless you have at
    least one employee besides yourself, or if the other folks are billed through
    you. \r\n\r\nIf the copywriters, photographers, etc have their own businesses
    and do their own billing, your clients will figure that out pretty quickly anyway.
    And there's nothing wrong with that, but you don't want clients to feel you're
    giving a false impression of  your company."

    have you considered something more graceful and perhaps suggesting movement? I
    don''t mean a literal bird, but a name like that is an opportunity to be memorable.  '

  body: "Hi Stefan & James\r\n\r\nThank you very much for replying and for your comments.\r\n\r\nI
    have looked at implementing your suggestions. Completely agree with all points,
    as you'll see in the quick updates I've been looking at. I've tweaked a number
    of the letters too.\r\n\r\nI feel the ampersand should be a little smaller, to
    help create some visual contrast with the letterforms, so seems to work well being
    about the size of the largest counter, it was far too small before - and would
    impede my ability to use at very small sizes legibly.\r\n\r\nThanks again!\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Bird&CoDraft2_5520.png]"

    you can also create an alternative B & C logo for smaler sizes like icons and
    stuff."
