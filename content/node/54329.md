  target=\"_blank\">Typetweets</a> is a neat little project from <a href=\"http://typesites.com/\"
  target=\"_blank\">Typesites</a> that searches Twitter posts for typographic keywords
  and then collects and displays the 100 most recent. It's a great way to get a quick
  idea of what typophiles everywhere are talking about right now."

  body: i remember seeing this before but was disappointed at the dearth of terms
    that typetweets finds. seeing tweets about helvetica, arial, typography, and letterpress
    gets tiring quickly. they should dig into [[terminology]] and add some more interesting
    terms. i want to see more tweets about ball terminals!
