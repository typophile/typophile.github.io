  me all about it. Why are you printing? I'm getting the urge to maybe get a press
  and set some specimens and would like to hear from anyone who has undertaken this.
  I often think that this is the ultimate goal of type, to be printed (sorry webguys.)\r\n"

  body: "I don't print nearly enough to have a \"workflow\", but I have been printing
    letterpress on and off for almost 4 years now. I've only ever used Vandercook
    cylinder presses, and have never done more than one color. Until recently I only
    printed from metal type in black ink, mostly to make specimens, including an ATF
    Garamond waterfall, 60pt Pascal (one version with rules between each sort to extract
    the sidebearings), and various Baskervilles. The one exception to that was a batch
    of parody courtesy cards* which I submitted to the TypeCon auction. Over the past
    few months though I had photopolymer plates made and printed my business cards
    - explained and shown in here: http://typophile.com/node/21340\r\n\r\n* \"Don't
    Mention It\" cards, intended as a preposterously formal reply\r\nto a \"Thank
    You\" card... Set in a cloyingly self-conscious type of course,\r\nin bronze ink.\r\n\r\nPaper:
    I like \"honest\" paper - white, hard, thin. Good inkjet paper actually works
    great! I can't stand the spongey crap that tempts so many printers to smother
    the type. Goo-goo-gaa-gaa letterpress. I favor what's called a \"kiss\" impression,
    but when I print specimens for digitization (not too often though) I go even gentler,
    to the breaking point of the blackness of the letterform bodies. I call that \"platonic
    kiss\" impression. :-)  On the other hand, well-paying clients can ask for whatever
    the hell kind of impression they want! :-)  As long as I won't be damaging some
    rare beauty of a metal face.\r\n\r\nI print letterpress because: it yields a different
    and useful (in more than one way) result; it's cheaper for small runs; and the
    control-to-price ratio is great - in the case of my business cards for example
    I made my own ink using reduced wine. But I personally feel metal letterpress
    is highly over-rated, and recommend using ppl as much as possible.\r\n\r\n> this
    is the ultimate goal of type\r\n\r\nTo me that's too creationistic, too Art. The
    primary goal of type is\r\nto help multiple people communicate, not one person
    express himself.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "I have a Vandercook SP15 proof press and print (not often enough) from magnesium
    engravings mounted type high. I compose digitally and have the plates made and
    mounted from film.\r\n\r\nI print on all sorts of cardstock and cardboard. My
    makeready skills are not great though so I don't usually do well with thinner
    stock, although the few times I've attemped anything of the level of bookwork,
    I've used Mohawk Superfine, cream, eggshell finish - which is IMHO the be all
    end all of book paper.\r\n\r\nI print because I love to print. not sure why. Ink
    in the veins maybe. my first job was as an assistant in a print shop, I did letterpresswork
    all through high school, and then operated a sign press and Heidelberg Windmill
    after school; in college I took apart and put back together a Windmill and worked

  body: "Rodrigue\r\n\r\nI did a monograph _Printing digital type on the hand-operated
    flatbed cylinder press_ a while back. This will answer some of your questions
    since it is specifically about printing digital type via the letterpress process.
    You can find more information about it here:\r\n\r\nhttp://bielerpressxi.blogspot.com/\r\n\r\n\r\njlt\r\n\r\nI
    wouldn't actually recommend printing type from magnesium engravings. One reason
    is the lack of structural density if mounted on wood [this is also stated in the
    Heidelberg Windmill manual]. Another is that magnesium corrodes quickly. Of the
    three metals commonly used for engravings, copper, zinc, magnesium, the latter
    is the worst for holding detail. Digitally produced film generated engravings,
    however, aren't as bad as engravings that were generated direct from camera; the
    latter's distortion is why type was not commonly printed in engraved form. The
    conjoining of digital film output and the photopolymer plate process eliminated
    this problem and provided a viable alternative to metal type. You would get far
    more satisfactory results from this method.\r\n\r\nGerald"

    they are roughly the same price as mounted magnesium. Processed photopolymer plates
    are about a third cheaper than copper, which, if mounted on a honeycomb or patent
    base, is as good as. \r\n\r\nIf you mean bases, well, yes, but that is just the
    cost of doing business. Presses are expensive, operation space is expensive...
    The trick is to make more money, using the tools and equipment, than you spend.\r\n\r\n\r\nBut
    it's \"characteristics,\" or \"traits' if you will; not \"qualifications.\"\r\n\r\nGerald"

    that I saw you make a post on trap in fonts (at flexoexchange?) a while back.
    Gerald, I went to the link and it is quite facinating. My main question is why
    do you have to distort the fonts? It is obvious you put quite a bit of time and
    love into the site and book.\r\n\r\nI have been contemplating a little 2up 2color

  body: "Monotype would be worth considering. Takes some-know-how. The lead alloy
    can be remelted keeping costs under control. No \"base\" is required. Also, polymer
    plates can be mounted on \"high Monotype spaces\". Typos can be corrected by hand,
    polymer plates with typos requires a new plate. I know all of you set perfect
    type, spell like Dr. Squid, so that may not concern you.\r\n\r\nWe used both.
    So I am not biased. Polymer is certainly superior to magnesium plates.\r\n\r\nGerald

    I was asking about the amount of ink bleed that's typical in flexo printing. The
    eventual answer (~1 mil) was in surprising and reassuring agreement with my other

  body: "Rodrigue\r\n\r\nIt is not an attempt to \"distort\" the letterform but rather
    a modification. Besides a concern about the weight of digital type in general
    there is gain to the letterform during the letterpress printing process. A thinning
    of the letterform will help a bit to counteract this. The idea is to bring the
    letterform back to what it should look like when printed rather than allow the
    process itself to distort it.\r\n\r\n\r\nModification is also a way to provide
    a form of optimization. I feel this is absolutely essential but it is not commonly
    practiced at all and yet it takes maybe five minutes to do this in either FontLab
    or Fontographer. Note that Hrant, our champion of optimization, did not alter
    the letterforms in this manner when he printed his business card. Maybe I need
    a fifth \"trait.\"\r\n\r\nGerald"
