  body: "One suggestion and one complaint about downloadable PDF specimens, from a
    tech writer.\r\n\r\nSuggestion: More leading. Too many specimens have minimal
    leading, probably to put in as many sizes, weights and languages samples as possible.
    But make the typeface look the best that it can! Put a little extra leading in
    your text if that is what is necessary. Making your font look good is the whole
    point here.\r\n\r\nComplaint about color, part 1: Do not put a fake parchment
    color behind the text samples. This pisses me off. When I print the PDF to see
    how the font reads on paper, what I want to see is how does the black ink look
    on paper. I do not want to see how the black ink looks on the fake parchment color
    you have inserted into the PDF. \r\n\r\nComplaint about color, part 2: Keep the
    color ornamentation to a minimum.  I do not want to waste my printer ink  on a
    half page of wild red swirling something just so I  can see what the text on the
    other half of the page looks like on paper.\r\n\r\nThanks, I feel better now."

  body: At the same time, I think it is important to show at least a few examples
    of the text set against a colored background or colored (other than black) text
    set against both a white and a colored background.
