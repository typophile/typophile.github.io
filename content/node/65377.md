  troubleshoot various issues. One that I haven't figured out is this:\r\n\r\nSome
  of our postscript fonts like Charlotte Sans and Figural Book (both Letraset) come
  in with a cursor that is way overextended in length. I've even opened Figural up
  in FontLab, but see nothing wrong there. This issue can become problematic when
  setting paragraphs of text. Any ideas what can cause this?\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Fig_Book_4511.png]"

    annoying.\r\nI have no idea what causes it though.\r\n\r\np.s. My workplace licensed
    Montague Script last year and it's a hit!"
