  body: "I think the Hudson's Bay Company logo and the lettering in the banner are
    custom lettering. The main logo is a simplified blackletter script, somewhat like
    [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/bitstream/cloister-black/|Cloister Black]] or [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/letraset/agincourt/|Agincourt]],
    but it doesn't match any blackletter font I could find.\r\n\r\nI think the sans
    serif lettering at the bottom of the sign looks like Helvetica.\r\n\r\n - Mike

    instance. Further argument for custom lettering.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
