  alter, an existing typeface for which several different cuts are available. (Garamond
  is a handy example; there must be dozens of them.) Is it an acceptable practice
  to, say, type something in Photoshop using the font(s) in question at like 150pt
  size, immediately rasterize it, then pixel-edit the glyphs, then dump them back
  in to a fontforge or something, use the autotrace feature, and finally manually
  correct the outlines?\r\n\r\nObviously, the key question here is in using an existing
  font to generate a bitmap-font-jumping-off-point for a new design. Are most license
  agreements written to prohibit the practice I've just outlined?\r\n\r\nPlease leave
  aside for a minute the question of whether or not the font thus generated would
  probably suck.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance for your kind guidance."

    Sorry.\r\n\r\n@Jackson - my first font, dude. Some slack, pls? I expect it to
    suck -- unless someone else does it for me. I just read http://66.147.242.192/~operinan/2/2.3.1a/2.3.1.01.notes.htm
    and I am sufficiently intimidated.\r\n\r\n@hrant - Thanks. I get the ethics of
    it. If I did this to Ernestine and later said \"look, here's my shitty re-interpretation,
    I call it Franken-stine,\" I'd <em>expect</em> you to have a problem with that.
    \r\n\r\nIn my case, I would like to synthesize things that I like from various
    cuts of Italian Old Styles, Golden Types, and Cloister Old Styles, and to gently
    torture the glyphs into different vertical proportions.\r\n\r\nAnd I'd <em>like</em>
    to say that it will be for internal use only, but if I put any significant amount
    of work into it I know I will want to <em>use</em> it. If nothing else, to become
    the \"bespoke typeface\" of my personal country. That doesn't quite seem like
    an \"internal\" use though.\r\n\r\nEDIT\r\n@Jan - you make it clear. I shouldn't
    do this. If I want to do anything like it, I should take out a pen and paper and
    get down to some real work.\r\n/EDIT\r\n\r\nSo I just wanted to check this ethical
    grey area before I got in to it. Thanks y'all for your feedback."

    the best reason to study history is not with an intent to be encouraged by what

    human psyche that must be kept in check, both on a personal level and in terms
    of society at large.\r\n\r\n<blockquote>I'd <em>expect</em> you to have a problem

    that I made - the rest is essentially Nina's and she might disagree: actually
    personally I would not mind as long as it stayed internal (which only means nobody
    else can use it, and not that nobody else can see it). In fact on some level (especially
    if it stays internal) I would feel flattered. But know that this attitude is not
    typical among type designers.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    find it interesting that you are completely allowed to take you easel and paints
    into the Louvre and copy any painting you like.  Indeed you can even sell it.
    The only requirement is that your copy has to be either slightly larger or smaller
    than the original, and you can't claim it is the original work.  Actually there
    are people who make a good amount of money copying paintings for people who own
    them and want to keep the originals locked up somewhere while they display the

    or not is not the question.  Whether this is your \"first font\" or not is not
    the question.  The question is, why in the hell would you want to do that?  The
    question behind that is why do you want to design type to begin with? If you want
    to design type just because you want to \"make one of those\" (while pointing
    to a stack of existing successful typefaces), you are making a bad decision.  If
    you want only to do revivals then at least study the type and drawings of the
    originals and learn from it and make your contribution of how to make it better
    for our time and place.  If you don't want it to be better than what exists, then
    don't bother trying.\r\nIf you indeed want to design your own type, then just
    do it. You don't need to trace someone else's work to be able to do that.  If
    you seriously want to begin a career as a type designer and want to get up to
    speed quickly, go to Reading or KABK for a year and learn from good teachers who
    know their stuff. If you can't do that, then just start designing the typeface
    that is within you and you would like to see in use. You can learn a lot by just
    taking a shot at it.  Your failures will teach you well, your successes not as
    much. "

    OK to deliberately copy someone's else's work, but that in the world of type design,
    at some point it becomes unavoidable.  Really, aren't we are derivative of the
    original Latin?  Of course we are, we have to be or else our glyphs would be unrecognizable
    and thus unreadable.  There is a certain built in need for us to make our work
    about 95% similar to what came before.  You can't say that of any other artform
    really.  I'm just trying to open this pandora's box for discussion.  Obviously
    being a (very amateur) type designer myself, I wouldn't like the idea of people
    copying my work and claiming it as their own, but you know what, I bet their lower
    case L's are going to be damn similar.  Again, they have to be.  So we can probably
    agree that autotracing another font is wrong, but what about copying by eye?  What
    about that work you posted recently where you said you created it by starring
    at another font?  Is that copying? Or is it merely \"being inspired by?\"  I find
    this line incredibly thin in the world of type design.  Again, I say, it has to
    be."
