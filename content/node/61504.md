  After reading that their outlines have been improved I was curios to compare Adobe\u2019s
  oultines to Neufville\u2019s which are said to be the most authentic. Just comparing
  the bold and light versions I have found them to be identical.\r\n\r\nLooking at
  the copyright information in the Adobe version, both Adobe and Neufville are listed
  as joint copyright holders.\r\n\r\nSo, are they actually the same outlines?"

    recently you read that the Adobe outlines had been improved. About 3 years ago
    I made a comparison layout between the Adobe, Bitstream and Neufville Futuras
    in a single weight \u2013 as a result of seeing something that Erik Spiekermann
    had said about this in his blog. The Adobe version I used for this was the old
    one (from \u201987) and yes, it is different in some respects, but not as different
    as the Bitstream version. I agree with the contention that Neufville's is likely
    to be the most authentic cut."

    posted is not true anymore. The Adobe Futura critiqued by Erik Spiekermann is
    an earlier version and Adobe\u2019s current offering looks nothing like it.\r\n\r\nI
    don\u2019t own the Neufville Futura, but I generated a few characters using the
    Fontshop website to compare them to Adobe\u2019s Futura. They seem to align perfectly.\r\n\r\n"

  body: I think that the Neufville Futura looks better especially because of the ampersand
    and the 'M'. But also 'r' and 's' look slightly better. Maybe it's because of
    the different size and the display but Neufville's 'r' and 's' seem to have nicer
    roundings.

    things much more clear. Some characters look very very similar, others not. Whether
    the difference is great enough to warrant buying Neufville\u2019s version is another
    matter. A few characters do look slightly \u2018better\u2019 though.\r\n\r\nThanks
    again for your help!\r\n"

    the book \u2018PAUL RENNER, The Art of Typography\u2019 by Christopher Burke):
    \r\n\r\nPaul Renner and Futura: The Effects of Culture, Technology, and Social
    Continuity On the Design of Type for Printing.\r\n\r\nhttp://typophile.com/node/18165\r\n\r\nhttp://etd.gsu.edu/theses/available/etd-07222005-152053/\r\n\r\nAlso
    there is an excellent rendering of Futura (which includes the experimental characters
    of Renner and oldstyle numerals...), it is called 'Architype Renner', it can be
    found at the \u2018The Foundry\u2019. It is superb!\r\n\r\nhttp://www.foundrytypes.co.uk/\r\n\r\nAs
    it is stated there:\r\n\r\nThe geometry of Paul Renner's sans serif letterforms
    was tempered with optical correction and followed proportions of earlier type
    models and his capitals were nearer to old-style types than the moderns, yet they
    still retained the spirit of the New Typogrphy. His early experimental characters
    were originally released as alternatives, to the sans which was to become the
    Futura typeface released by Bauer in 927-30.\r\nOld-style figures also featured
    in early versions, along with the alternative characters, but they also disappeared
    soon after release.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
