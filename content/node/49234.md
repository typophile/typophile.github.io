  formal documents i.e. exec summaries for my company. Preferably something elegant,
  modern, and with a robust family. \r\n\r\nDoes anybody have any ideas?\r\n\r\nThanks
  in advance,\r\n--dub"

    the modern) or Indigo Antiqua (http://www.fontanova.se/e_indigo.html) (emphasizing
    the elegant, formal)?\r\ncheers,\r\njan"

  body: "My suggestion would be either Frutiger's Meridien ( i sat my CV in it, and
    it worked very well) or Forsberg's Berling, (a man's Times new roman) But the
    possibilities here seems... endless\r\n\r\n2 x 2 = 5"

  body: "Linotype's new Frutiger Serif is basically an updated version of Meridien,
    and very, very nice, with an extremely broad family.  Berling Nova is Linotype's
    updating of Berling, and also very nice.  Fedra's perfectly good.  So is Tankard's
    Kingfisher.  I'm also partial to Porchez' Le Monde family.\r\n\r\nBut Henrik is
    right, the possibilities go on and on and on."
