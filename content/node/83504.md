body: "Hello everyone, \r\n\r\nBeing the lone in-house graphic designer in the back
  corner of a robust Canadian university student newspaper, I've been tasked with
  revamping things after ten years of a very classic, stuffy look (not my design).
  Our redesign committee has created a personality for our 'new' paper: 'that hip-to-it
  senior year undergrad who's totally in the know but is your peer and isn't talking
  down at you' 'the first person you call if you need to know something a little off
  the beaten path', etc etc. Why the newspaper is a 'he' is beyond me!\r\n\r\nI am
  stuck on headline/subheadline options. We'd like the design to stick for a while,
  so while we chose a punchy Emigre font for the flag, the headline and subheadlines
  should be reasonably devoid of catchy quirks that will date them very quickly (so
  something like Amplitude or Malaga are sadly nixed). I'm really stuck! I still want
  some hipness in the fonts! Help!\r\n\r\nChoices made so far:\r\nFairplex - flag
  face \r\nTisa - Body face (this is not set in stone)\r\n\r\nIt would be nice to
  have a mix of sans/slab between the heads and subheads. \r\n\r\nWorking option for
  subheadline:\r\nWhitney\r\n\r\nPossible options for headline:\r\nNews706\r\nFlama\r\nTiempos\r\nDagny\r\nGotham
  Condensed\r\n\r\n...but none of them are quite cutting it.  I just don't want to
  be forced to choose something that makes us look like we're taking ourselves too
  seriously....we're not The Onion but we are also certainly not the NYTimes. Your
  assistance is appreciated!\r\n-vikki\r\n"

  body: "I like the fact that you are considering contemporary fonts.\r\nAnything
    with any popularity is no longer hip, so why not choose choose something new that
    you would really like to work with (in the kind of layouts that you would like
    to do) as long as it hasn't been overexposed?\r\nThen, your layouts should make
    the difference.\r\nLots of white space. Avoid symmetry. (The layout equivalent,
    in newspapers, of not overexposed.)\r\nTrust your taste, and that should do it."
