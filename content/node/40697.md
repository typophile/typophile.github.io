body: "I'm currently working on a pretty dry piece of material, a bland technical
  document where the author uses a lot of bullet points, and stepped indenture, and
  outlined lists (I.A.1.a...). \r\n\r\nMy questions are:\r\n\r\n1. Is there a standardized
  rule of thumb when it comes to indents? Perhaps a formula has been devised that
  I'm not aware of. I'm currently using a 2 step, but have had 3 step in the past.\r\n\r\nFirst
  Step: Left Indent .1806, First Line Indent -.1325 Bullet Tab .1806\r\nSecond Step:
  Left Indent .313, First Line Indent -.1000 Bullet Tab .313\r\nThird Step: Left Indent
  .4455, First Line Indent -.1399 Bullet Tab .4455\r\n\r\nClearly there isn't a consistency
  between these indents, I've just eyeballed using the tab toolbar.\r\n\r\n2. When
  setting up outlined lists, what's the standard flow? Is it I.A.1.a. or something
  different? I remember creating outlines in 7th grade English class, but I don't
  remember what the format was anymore.\r\n\r\n3. Finally, when doing bulleted lists
  and when those lists are indented, should I continue to use the same bullets for
  the indentures? Or should I change bullet styles (color, character, size)? I like
  the look of the sideways carrot [img:sites/default/files/old-images/Sideways Carrot_5451.jpg]
  and tend to use the standard bullet \u2022 for second step indentures.\r\n\r\nI
  hope these questions aren't too confusing. I don't have The Elements of Typographic
  Style available which I imagine would have these answers. Any help will be very
  appreciated.\r\n\r\n*Edit: Attached KittyHawk.PDF. It's still in draft form, so
  some of the comments aren't complete and I'm still formatting the images. I'd be
  interested to hear thoughts on the design."

  body: ":-)  It's not that tough, Andrew, but it's an editing question, not a typographic
    one, so you won't find much of an answer in EoTS....  Find a copy of the United
    States Government Printing Office Style Manual instead.\r\n\r\n<em>1. Is there
    a standardized rule of thumb when it comes to indents? </em>\r\n\r\nDepending
    on the face and the size of the page I'm using, I like two or three ems -- depends
    how far down you have to go.\r\n\r\n<em>2. When setting up outlined lists, what\u2019s
    the standard flow? Is it I.A.1.a. or something different? I remember creating
    outlines in 7th grade English class, but I don\u2019t remember what the format
    was anymore.</em>\r\n\r\nGiven the topic, I'd follow GPO style as closely as possible,
    so you'd have 1, 1.1, 1.1 a, 1.1 a (i). That being said, I did work at Treasury
    that went I.A.1.a.(i) -- just pick one and stick to it.\r\n\r\n<em>3. Finally,
    when doing bulleted lists and when those lists are indented, should I continue
    to use the same bullets for the indentures? Or should I change bullet styles (color,
    character, size)?</em>\r\n\r\nI don't mind how you've used the coloured carrot
    in the sample at all, particularly how tight this is set.  It really could use
    for some extra space (or a 1-em indent) between paragraphs where there's really
    not a lot of indication where one starts and the next begins.\r\n\r\nA couple
    of other things -- line up your tables with the left column flush left and anything
    with numbers either on a decimal tab or flush right. Centering makes them a witch
    to read.  ;-)\r\n\r\nAnd is there any chance of giving the text a loosening-up?
    \ Man, you've really got it squished on the page!\r\n"

  body: I think the colored carrot is just confusing. It signals 'bulleted list,'
    but then every paragraph is flagged, so it isn't a list under a common topic heading,
    which is what bulleted lists should be. An indent or space between paragraphs
    would work better, I think.

  body: "Great Linda, that's information I can USE! I don't have any style guides
    and I approach all of these designs in the dark (I'm the only guy here.) So, having
    a starting point will be very helpful, and that style guide will help answer some
    other questions for me too.\r\n\r\n<cite>And is there any chance of giving the
    text a loosening-up? Man, you\u2019ve really got it squished on the page!</cite>\r\n\r\nWhat
    would you recommend? I'm aligning to the baseline grid with .1535 inch spacing
    (which works out to 11.05pt leading.) My body copy is 9pt Karmina Regular.\r\n\r\nI'll
    attach and updated PDF."

    up that way because of the source material. I don't write the reports, I just
    try to beautify them. The content is collected from paraphrasing a much larger
    and in-depth report. It's like a summary of the deployment focusing on specific
    areas hence the orange header bars. However, I do agree, I think the bullets are
    abit much sometime, especially when there are multiple levels.\r\n\r\nEverything
    is tight to get it into as small a document as possible. This document is actually
    the longest I've ever created for one of these PDRs, and it's because of the information
    on page 5, I've never had to include a table like that before. Most of the time
    I can create a nice 2 sided tabloid."

    dropping the body copy to 8.5 pt with leaving the leading at 11: the difference
    in print size won't be that noticeable, but with the extra .5 pt of space, it'll
    make it a little less dense.  \r\n\r\nOr....\r\n\r\n<em>This document is actually

    you're designing this for print (vs. electronic) distribution, having a page 5
    means you're going to need an extra sheet anyway (either a tabloid folded cover
    with sheet inside, or three d/s sheets) with a blank side. If there's any chance
    you could use it, do so, since the paper cost will be the same and the look much
    nicer. Bump the text to 10pt and the leading to 12 (or more, if you can), and
    add some extra space before major headings.\r\n\r\n(Looking at this reminds me
    of a couple of subcontracts I did in DC for Beltway Bandits: ah, those were the
    days....) :-P"

  body: "I'll try those suggestions Linda. This is an internal document so there isn't
    to many budget constraints on printing (only a few top level clients see it).
    So, most of the time I print in house as long as it's 8.5x11 and thing larger
    I go to the local print house.\r\n\r\nBy the way, your reminiscing gives me hope
    that I won't be doing in-house government contract design work forever... a scary
    thought.\r\n\r\nWell, back to the salt mines..."

    deployment. I've opened up the spacing, refined the subheadings and I'm very proud
    of how things turned out.\r\n\r\nI'd love to hear your thoughts on this look/design.
    It's a double sided sheet design. The content was minimal and the images weren't
    especially great. I don't expect to many of these PDRs to be like this, but for
    the amount of information I think it works well."
