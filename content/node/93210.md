  httpd, hence the crude CGI interface.\r\n\r\nIt, and all other scripts attached,
  are licensed under the WTFPL. In short, you may do Whatever The F* you want to with
  them."

    one day... Thanks for uploading them though!

    into their possible application would be appreciated!

  body: "Those are Bash shell scripts, right? Copy into a plain text editor and save
    under an appropriate name (end it with .sh). Then run from Mac OS X's Terminal
    and see what happens :-)\r\n\r\n(Do <em>not</em> attempt on a Windows machine,
    it's Useless. Linux may or may not work.)\r\n\r\nFrom mere eye-balling the scripts,
    and interpolating between the flaky bits of knowledge I have:\r\n\r\nThe first
    one creates a HTML file with the test characters and fonts in the top halve (it's
    clearly a CSS file). The http header makes me think this might get fed right into
    a compatible web browser.\r\nThe second one creates a HTML file with the color
    codes of the hex color list at its bottom, in their respective color.\r\n\r\n...
    How am I doing so far, T\xE9? :-)\r\n\r\nI would need to encounter a specific
    scenario where this kind of command-chaining is useful, but then again when I
    <em>do</em> I'll make sure to look these up and see how to adjust to taste. It
    could be priceless stuff, and just what you are looking for -- under the right
    circumstances."

  body: "Forgot to mention, but I got the HKS numbers in hks2css from [[http://www.tabelle.info/hks_farben.html|tabelle.info]].
    The scripts were written on a Linux box on which /bin/sh is <code>ash</code>,
    the Almquist shell, though my login shell is Bash. I <em>think</em> the scripts
    will work with BSD.\r\n\r\nThe CGI script must be adapted to amyone else's system,
    but it takes two font names and two file names. The file names are expanded to
    CSS files with @font-face declarations for the two fonts named. It returns HTML
    with some embedded CSS that sets up a basic comparison between the two fonts as
    subhead/text as well as a side-by-side comparison of some characters so you can
    judge their match for yourself. Can't remember off the top of my head where on
    the web I found this test. I merely CGIfied it.\r\n\r\nYou can use the latter
    script of a Windows machine, <em>if</em> you have a suitable port of various Unix
    utilities installed and working. Cygwin and mingw ought to bring them in as a
    matter of course, but [[http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/|GnuWin]] should suffice.\r\n\r\nThe
    latter script can also serve as a sample of the use of printf(1), here-documents
    and passwd-style databases. Any C coder should know the first already. A here-document
    is a document embedded in a script. Here, it's the stuff from '&lt;&lt;_E_O_F_'
    up to the '_E_O_F_' at the end.\r\n\r\nA passwd-style database is a text file
    with the fields separated by semicolons. Setting IFS=: lets you read them with
    the usual shell commands.\r\n\r\nThere's a whole bunch of Bash tutorials out there
    that will explain this, and hopefully much better than I did."

    dietlibc to lessen startup time and memory requirements.\r\n\r\nHmm... gotta check
