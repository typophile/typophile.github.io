  sources to the digital realm. This kind of work really interests me and I have a
  question in this regard: is an ethical thing to do? I mean, copying a design from
  a printed source and making a digital font? What do copyright says in this regard?\r\n\r\nThanks
  for clarifications"

    speaking it seems to be fine... since you're only copying the design and not mathematical/programmatical
    font data, and font designs themselves are not protected by copyright law.  (In
    other countries/regions you should definitely check what the IP laws there say
    about type designs).\r\n\r\nWhether or not it's <em>ethical</em> is getting into
    a rather murkier area.  Inasmuch as I've been able to sense any kind of general
    consensus amongst type designers, it seems to be that type design really <em>ought</em>
    to be copyright-able even if it isn't; and so I get the impression that there's
    a kind of \"gentleman's understanding\" (apologies to the ladies among us) that
    the proper thing is to behave as if they were.\r\n\r\nFor myself, at least for
    now I've tentatively decided to adopt the approach that a design is fair game
    for revival or reinterpretation if it would be out of copyright under local law
    (in my case, Canadian law) if it actually were copyright-able."

  body: "How ethical it is also depends on what the 'printed source' is.  The ethics
    will be perceived differently depending on whether it's a previously undigitized
    specimen from an 1893 foundry catalog or a printed sample of a current Linotype
    or Adobe digitized font. And, since font NAMES can be copyrighted, and font designs
    can be patented, there are also other considerations.\r\n\r\n - Herb"

    upon the past, or adapt it to the present, rather than produce a facsimile. \r\n\r\nBut
    I shouldn\u2019t be splitting us into for or against, as many type designers do
    everything from authentic revivals to original work. "

    organism stuff. OTOH, improvement and adaptation sound pretty much like Evolution
    to me. Overall, the concept has worked pretty well\u2014or, at least, well enough

  body: "Speaking of Oz Cooper (which you were in another thread) \u2014 I found the
    fonts that were evolved from his sans hateful, despite the fact that Dave Farey
    is such a nice guy. If somehow I had been Oz and seen what Dave did I would have
    said, why did you change <em>that</em> and <em>that</em> and <em>that</em> \u2014
    don\u2019t you know I made them like that for a reason?!\r\n\r\nAnd it\u2019s
    not really a fair evolutionary \uFB01ght if the original doesn\u2019t exist.\r\n\r\nSo
    I would say the \uFB01rst duty of a revivalist is to make sure that the designer\u2019s
    work is available authentically, not just the interpretation.\r\nWhen I was working
    on the Modern Suite, I did that for the Scotch, but not for the Figgins Sans,
    and I now regret that. (I had changed the /G, for instance, adding a crossbar
    for the bene\uFB01t of today\u2019s readers who might mistake the original for
    a /C.) The principle here is letting the market/typographer/user decide how to
    use the font, rather than assuming one knows what they want."

    actually seem to be sufficiently similar.\r\n\r\nWell, it's not as bad as insider
    trading, or practicing law, or running an election campaign. But compared to what
    a type designer <em>could</em> be doing I think there is in fact something fundamentally
    wrong with it. Others (such as Gerard Unger, and Nick Shinn, at least in a former
    self :-) have also expressed such views.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    work is second rate by someone who thinks they\u2019re better.\r\nIt was also
    very hard to convince people that Myriad and Helvetica aren\u2019t original designs!\r\n\r\nOf
    course, I don\u2019t think there is anything wrong with reviving old designs,
    and there is a market for them, and they serve many useful purposes\u2014my biggest
    beef was that I don\u2019t think revivals are type design, they\u2019re technical/styling
    work. Robin Nicholas made a similar point in the recent <em>Eye</em> special on
    Monotype\u2014that he didn\u2019t think of himself as a type designer, that was
    what Herman Zapf did (although I would disagree with him on that count, as he
    has done some quite original work, as well as things like Arial).\r\n\r\nUltimately,
    there are some problems with criticizing those who work in the same industry,
    and, considering the shades of grey between original and knock-off, I now think
    it\u2019s better to accentuate the positive (I\u2019m writing something on Karloff
    for Typographica\u2019s Best of 2012), and make any argument through my work.
    But I\u2019ll still discuss this issue here, hopefully in a more nuanced manner
    than the past."

  body: Different designers have different talents. I would much rather see a well-done
    version of a circa 1900 display font, done by a competent copyist, than a new
    typeface by someone who lacks artistic merit. And I'd certainly like to see some
    older display typefaces used for logos, advertising, and shopfronts instead of
    overused ubiquitous faces such as Papyrus and Vivaldi.  - Herb
