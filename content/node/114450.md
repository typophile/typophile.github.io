  of late, I was wondering what the general opinions on the style was. Specifically,
  what do you think of the success of fonts in the vein of Thirsty Rough or Voyage?
  \r\n\r\nAs a purely digital designer, I'm glad to have elements like these to design
  with; but as fellow typophiles/designers, do you think these trends have a decent
  shelf life for branding, or do you feel like it's a more fleeting trend?"

    flare-serif typefaces, especially the late 30\u2019s face [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lydian_(typeface)|Lydian]],
    but also the likes of [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albertus_(typeface)|Monotype
    Albertus]], [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/itc/tiepolo/|ITC Tiepolo]] and 2013\u2019s
    [[http://www.fontspring.com/fonts/fontsite/dragon|Dragon]]. I\u2019ve noticed
    these faces are often contrasted by popular contemporary geometric sans-serifs
    (amongst these, Lineto\u2019s Circular seems to have become particularly popular).
    Just this week I\u2019ve seen flare-faces used in [[http://nbhap.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads//2014/02/Angel-Olsen-cover-2014.jpg|Angel
    Olsen\u2019s new album cover]] (Lydian) and a set of good concert posters by [[http://www.typographicposters.com/kees-bakker/|Kees
    Bakker]] (Tiepolo). "

  body: "Nice summary, J\xF8rgen. \r\n\r\nGrant, keep in mind that (like most trends)
    the organic/handwritten thing is just one of many and your experience will vary
    depending on region, design format, and field. Also, I feel like the popularity
    of analog/handmade things in general jumped maybe 4\u20135 years ago and has plateaued
    at a high level since then."

    with a lot of personality is prone to be associated with its time, so the handwriting
    styles (in particular the ones you mention) are not likely to be considered \u201Ctimeless\u201D
    20 years from now. But there are always retro revivals of what was once novel
    and new (the chromatic wood type stuff, for example). The best typefaces from
    any of these trends will certainly be a valid choice at any time if chosen wisely
    and used well."

    to me most, unless it becomes a trend before I get it done!"

    or do you feel like it's a more fleeting trend?\r\n\r\nIn most cases you don't
    want to use a fleeting trend, but most companies update their logos and branding
    periodically to reflect current trends. For example, Pepsi has updated their logo
    10 times.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, a fleeting trend might be totally appropriate
    for a company that needs to conform to current trends; such as a company that
    caters to the whims of teenagers. Obviously they don't want to change their logo
    every year, but other elements of branding can be revised frequently, especially
    if the branding is mostly online, which is easy to update as trends change.\r\n"
