    in order to assemble them to print a full page, then it's johannes gensfleisch,
    aka gutenberg. i guess.\r\n\r\ndr"

    earlier?\r\n\r\nI agree that the definition of \"typographer\" has to be clarified
    in order to answer this question.\r\n\r\n - Lex"

  body: "muller, im afraid your definition is a little too vague, still. claude garamond,
    for example, by creating a truely wonderful typeface (though, not from scratch)
    and putting his letters together in a fancy and elaborate way, made his books
    quite easy to read. still he was not the first one: before him, griffo, augereau,
    jenson... and actually, to come back to your definition (which by no mean is the
    definition of typographer, by the way), you say \"to make text easier to read\":
    easier than... what?\r\n\r\ndr"
