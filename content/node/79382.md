  kerning on the name was so bad I felt queazy. \r\n\r\nWent home and took a shot
  at improving it.\r\n\r\nDon't know the Garamond they used exactly, but came close
  with AGaramond Titling.\r\n\r\nIt is admittedly tricky to kern with capital A's
  in the word. \r\n\r\nAm I close?\r\n\r\nSomeone else like to take a shot? Feel free.\r\n"

  body: "And this is why upper-case letters are usually set much, much more widely
    spaced. ;) Any solution for /RA/ and /KA/ is going to be an unfortunate one.\r\n\r\nHere's
    my shot, in Berling but close enough:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/nebraskan_5671.png]\r\n\r\nI've
    tightened up the D and Y in DAILY, meaning it's probably a bit tighter-spaced
    overall than NEBRASKAN but I think that might be needed."

  body: "It is for this very reason that nameplate\u2019s should ideally be hand-lettered/-crafted,
    not off-the-shelf type kerned to within an inch of its life. \r\n\r\nIn this example,
    especially, the RA and KA combinations require custom treatments.\r\n\r\nSteve
    \u2014 your exercise is passable. The RA in particular still needs considerable
    attention, but suffers from the limits of the particular leg in that face.\r\n\r\nBTW,
    the base type in the original looks like Stempel Garamond to me."

    means the K is next.\r\n"
