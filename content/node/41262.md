  decided to join in the fun!\r\n\r\nI'm sure many of you have seen the new BBC3 logo
  (mixed response so far\u2026), my question is what is the typeface?\r\n\r\nAnyone
  know what it is or another one very similar to it? I thank you.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/bbc3_logo_3726.jpg]"

  body: I'm pretty sure this is an altered/customized version of Chalet London 70
    by House Industries.  Tried it out and it fits.  Whoever designed the logo has
    adjusted proportions and rotated and altered the 'e's.

  body: The h is too wide for a regular typeface. All in all it looks like drawn from
    scratch.

  body: "It was done by Red Bee Media for the BBC. As Jason Smith (Fontsmith) has
    worked on all previous BBC incarnations for Red Bee, it wouldn't surprise me if
    his hand was also involved in this, although it does look a bit amateurish in
    places; (the smooth to curve transition on the base of the e's).\r\n\r\n\r\nNick
