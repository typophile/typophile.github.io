  body: Thankyou, I&#39;d already found that page in my initial research, it was very
    useful. The small pictures of the sketchbooks are great reference but they would
    be more useful to me on a larger scale.

  body: Why don&#39;t you contact him directly? I once spoke with Jeremy  <BR>for
    a spotlight the FontShop magazine FontNews was doing  <BR>on FF Disturbance, and
    he was very forthcoming and helpful. <BR>He brought his sketchbook along and provided
    me with a lot  <BR>of background information.

  body: 'Here is a story from David Earls&#39; interview with Tankard in his book
    &#39;Designing Typefaces&#39;: <BR> <BR>&#34;I designed Disturbance for my RCA
    [Royal College of Art] thesis during the holiday. The lecturers found it &#39;too
    distrubing to do this to the alphabet&#39; hence the name! After graduation I
    redrew the type for FontShop International in 1993. It still needs redrawing -
    bad curves etc - but it&#39;s a legal nightmare to redo it.&#34;  <BR> <BR>See
    the book for more of the interview.'
