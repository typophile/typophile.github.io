  body: "Thanks, Mark, for correcting my \"senior moment.\"\r\nHmmmm... Blippo, Pump,
    ITC Bauhaus, which came first, that is, <em>after</em> the prototype created by
    Herbert Bayer of the Dessau Bauhaus in 1925?\r\n\r\nLooks like <a href=\"http://www.linotype.com/43306/blippo-family.html\"
    target=\"new\">Blippo</a> by Fotostar in 1970 (a \"Linotype Original\")\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/blippo1.png]\r\nthen
    <a href=\"http://www.linotype.com/570/itcbauhaus-family.html\" target=\"new\">ITC
    Bauhaus</a> by Ed Benguiat and Victor Caruso in 1975\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Bauhaus2.png]\r\nand
    almost simutaneously <a href=\"http://www.linotype.com/90171/pump-family.html\"
    target=\"new\">Pump (ITC)</a> by Phillip Kelly in late '75/early '76.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Pump2.png]\r\n\r\nIt's
    a good thing we weren't given only the lowercase \"a, b\" and \"d\" to ID from
    :-)"
