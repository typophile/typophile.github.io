  body: "Good mock up Ryuk.\r\nThe sign-maker uses an untutored industrial style.\r\nI
    wonder if he had to make more letters, how he would have handled _S_. With a shallow
    angled straight diagonal like Industry? With a horizontal straight diagonal like
    Purista or Alternative 3. Or something else? \r\nAs for his _Q_, would the tail
    have gone straight down from the middle or at a 45 degree angle from the corner?
    Or something else? \r\nThe other letters would probably have been conventional
    and could generally follow the Engravers Gothic model.\r\nDon"
