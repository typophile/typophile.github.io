body: "I am trying to make text and images line up in CSS/HTML using the same principles
  as baseline typography.\r\nI am using images inside AP DIVs, and lining them up
  with the cap height of adjacent text in another AP DIV.\r\n\r\nMy problem is that
  different browsers pad the text differently within the AP DIV.\r\nI can't seem to
  stop this using CSS.\r\n\r\n#alltext\r\n{\r\nposition:absolute;\r\nwidth:width;\r\nheight:height;\r\nvertical-align:top;\r\nwhite-space:nowrap;\r\nmargin-top:0px;\r\nmargin-left:0px;\r\npadding-top:0px;\r\npadding-left:0px;\r\nborder-top:0px;\r\nborder-left:0px;\r\n}\r\n\r\nI
  know that it is only a matter of 1 or 2px but I'd like it to be as tight as possible.

    create a sample page to show the issue?

  body: "Hm. So I made a quick test of this issue to try and see if I could replicate
    the problem. Part of the problem with just looking at an image is that it is terribly
    hard to understand how all the elements on the page are set up and rules applied
    to the outer div are just as important as those applied to the p tag. \r\n\r\n<a
    href=\"http://aaronb.net/ap_test.html\" title=\"test page\">Test Page</a>\r\n\r\nMy
    example here doesn't seem to have the problem you show. Can you take a look on
    your end and tell me if you see a problem with it? If it seems to work properly,
    check out the CSS rules (they are all in the header) and you should be able to
    figure out what is going on with your example. "

    not seem to exist in your test, which I tried in both browsers.\r\nI am not using
    a p tag though, rather using a css class to style the text inside the DIV.\r\n\r\nCould
    this be the problem?\r\n\r\nI also noticed that, the two browsers demonstrate
    different leading/line-height.\r\n\r\n"

    since containing text is why p tags exist). <a href=\"http://aaronb.net/ap_test2.html\"
    title=\"Test Page 2\">Test Page 2</a> doesn't use p tags and still appears fine.
    It may be related to how you are positioning the div instead. \r\n\r\nRemember
    you can use the line-height rule to set leading, but ultimately these are different
    browsers and their text rendering will be slightly different."

    the Safari and Firefox.\r\n\r\nI really need to have a look and see what happens
    in Internet Explorer.\r\n\r\nThanks again for your time\u2026"

  body: "The p tag does have some inherent properties \u2014\_specifically applying
    space before and after itself. That's it. Beyond that, it applies semantic meaning
    to the text indicating a \"paragraph\" of copy, but that doesn't actually mean
    anything in terms of positioning.\r\n\r\nIt isn't inherently bad form to assign
    css to copy via a containing div \u2014 in fact it can save on file size, but
    I tend to prefer using p tags since then at the beginning of your css style sheet,
    you just say:\r\n\r\np {\r\n stuff\r\n}\r\n\r\nand it will apply those rules to
    every single one on the page. I guess for me, it also helps me think, \"ok, this
    is text because it is in a p tag.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nActually, basic typographic/layout
    ideas are not impossible on the web. I've seen some work that is done extremely
    well that follows those principles. The one I usually present is <a href=\"http://www.wilsonminer.com/\"

  body: "For future reference, it's best to upload your demo page to a server and
    give us the link if you can. It's so much faster to just muck with the markup
    directly than to do the back and forth explanations. \r\n\r\nIndeed, if your text
    is a paragraph of text, you should be using paragraph tags. While there are default
    styles for most tags in most browsers, you can 'zero them out' using CSS. Just
    one of many samples is Yahoo's reset.css: http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/reset/\r\n\r\nAs
    for dealing with baseline grids, the basic premise is that all of your element's
    styles have to conform to fall within whatever increment you are using for the
    grid.\r\n\r\nSo, if you're using a 20px grid, then your header tags' line-height,
    padding and margin would have to add up to 20px or 40px or 60px, or etc...\r\n\r\n "

    makes sure that for both the <em>body</em> and the <em>p</em> tag no extra pixels
