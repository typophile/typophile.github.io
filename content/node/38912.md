  with all types of media, and I've recently been scouring the internet for new font
  types. I'm officially in love, and I'd like to find out the basics, how-to. \r\nMy
  school offers courses on this for Graphic Design Majors, but, alas, I'm a Studio
  Art Major.\r\n Are there certain programs ideal for making fonts?\r\nI have so many
  questions, and I'm sure some of you probably think I'm being silly. \r\nReplies
  would be helpful.\r\n\r\nthanks, Rose"

    are lots of really good earlier threads that you could access by using Search.
    This one, for instance, covers roughly what you're looking for: http://www.typophile.com/node/35134
    \r\n\r\nBy the way, have you checked out the Resources section? Particularly this

  body: "I always recommend books to new people\u2014and feel positively apt in my
    self-made calling as greeter here\u2014since I'm new too. The first book I ever
    read on type was Ellen Lupton's 'Thinking with type'. It's short and gives a nice
    overview of the use of type, its substance, etc.. There are also lots of titles
    and short descriptions here:\r\ntypophile.com/books\r\nThere are also a number
    of discussions archived here that show the different processes of type creation
    and production. Reading through the critiques helps a bunch. Also, you might enjoy
    keeping up with the b'logues of type designers. Some are better than others. I
    like the ones at typography.com (Hoefler & Frere-Jones) and Christian Robertson's
    is great too (betatype.com)."
