    be edited to make the sides concave. With this change and some minor tinkering
    it is possible to make something fairly similar to the lettering in the logo.\r\nDon"

  body: Probably a custom logo. I like [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/hubertjocham/milk|Milk]]
    (but slanted) and [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/t26/terylene|Terylene]]. If you
    something cleaner to customize, may be starting with [[[http://www.myfonts.com/search/helvetica+rounded|Helvetica
    Rounded]] or [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/vag-rounded|VAG Rounded]]
    could be interesting (but probably very long).
