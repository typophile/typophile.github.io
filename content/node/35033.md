body: "Does anyone have ideas about fonts that are reminiscent/evocative of Wiener
  Werkstatte,  Josef Hoffman designs, early 20th-century Vienna, etc?\r\n\r\nThis
  is for a jewelry designer who does pieces in that style. I looked at P22's \"Vienna\"
  fonts, which are very cool, but don't seem as \"elegant\" as this needs to be, or
  at least elegant as perceived by contemporary rich women buying jewelry...  ;-)\r\n\r\nWhat
  I'm hoping for is something between Art Nouveau and Deco -- early-modern, feminine,
  refined, sophisticated, \"luxurious,\" etc.\r\n\r\nThanks for any ideas you have..."

    Their <a href="http://www.typofonderie.com/alphabets/view/AnisettePetite">Anisette
    Petite</a> is nice for smaller settings too. Or maybe something like <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/solotype/cognac/">Cognac</a>?
