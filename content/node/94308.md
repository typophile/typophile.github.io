body: "Hello guys \r\n\r\nWould you be so kind please, to recommend some nice typeface
  match, to go with FF Maverick?\r\nhttps://www.fontfont.com/fonts/maverick\r\n\r\n
  I'm so undecided, I've been too close to this typeface, working with it for past
  few weeks, I could really use some 3rd party perspective. \r\n\r\nPerhaps I could
  quickly explain what am I using it for.\r\nI'm using it as part of the identity
  for new property. A very modern, minimalist condo tower, aimed at young and tech
  savvy, mid and higher level management kind of customers (price market target).
  \ Beside very modern design and simple interiors, it comes packed with lots of tech.
  Each room fiber optic wired, with access to 50mbps broadband, digital tv. Apps to
  control your unit, like Turn ON the Air-Con when you on the way home,  check if
  there are any appliances left turned ON, and allowing you to remotely turn the power
  supply off, for that particular socket....and lots more...\r\n\r\nFF Maverick is
  going to be the Head text for all the printed media. I need to find some suitable
  body text, which would work well with the whole image.\r\n\r\nYou have seen the
  font, now let me please attach small visual of the property, to help you visualize
  what I'm working with.\r\n\r\nThank you so very much for taking the time to read,
  and I sincerely appreciate you suggestions.\r\n\r\nBest regards\r\n\r\nSebastian\r\n\r\np.s.
  sorry for limited renderings, the architect still does many design changes, to comply
  with the city's requirements. \r\n"

    to find a suitable typeface for the corresponding body text. However, you could
    give <a href=\"http://www.fontfont.com/fonts/unit\">FF Unit</a>, <a href=\"http://www.fontfont.com/fonts/unit-slab\">FF
    Unit Slab</a>, <a href=\"http://www.fontfont.com/fonts/more\">FF More</a> or maybe
    even <a href=\"http://www.fontfont.com/fonts/sheriff\">FF Sheriff</a> a try."
