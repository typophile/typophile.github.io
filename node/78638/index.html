  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>Hello Everyone,</p>
<p>My first post this year so I guess a hearty &ldquo;Happy New Year&rdquo; is due!
I am currently working on building a brand for myself and man is that hard.</p>
<p>After tinkering around for quite sometime I have, for the time being, settled on this wordmark. The thing is, I do not want to associate myself with any imagery and would like to stick to letters. What I felt was that &ldquo;nothing can go wrong when its my NAME!&rdquo; Right?</p>
<p>Well, anyways, so here is the wordmark and I have broken my full name into pieces. How readable is it? Honest feedback will be appreciated. Other than legibility any other issues that are blatantly blatant? I have tracked each of these pieces quite a bit.</p>
<p>I am an information designer (work mostly with wayfinding solutions) so it is very important that all the &ldquo;information&rdquo; is clear. Obviously :-) Hoping to hear from you all soon!</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I wasn&rsquo;t sure initially if it was your first and last names, or just one name, so I looked it up through your profile and saw it was both. Perhaps in India (where I see you live) this would already be obvious, but if you also intend to use the wordmark in countries where those names are less common, you might want to consider differentiating the 2 names from each other in some way (font weight or style or color). Although I&rsquo;ll say that one thing I like about your wordmark is its simplicity, and maybe using 2 weights or styles or colors would spoil that.</p>
<p>One thing that bothers me a little is that on the left edge we have a strong alignment, but on the right edge because of the &ldquo;A&rdquo; and &ldquo;Y&rdquo; the alignment is visually much weaker. Hanging the A and Y further to the right might give you a better visual alignment.</p>
<p>You also might try reversing it out of a shape, so you&rsquo;d have white type reversing out of a black or gray box.</p>

<p>Maybe if it was a name I immediately recognized, it would stand out more. But even then, I find it absurd to break words into separate lines when centuries of human evolution have taught us to read each line by itself. No offense, but I can&rsquo;t fathom why a wayfinding designer would think this is a good idea? Clarity is your bread and butter!</p>
<p>A good rule of thumb for a personal identity is to think about trying to sell your logo to your ideal client. If you don&rsquo;t think they&rsquo;d buy it, it&rsquo;s probably not the right logo for you.</p>

		<div class="commentbody">i don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s an absurd design approach. it&rsquo;s been done successfully before. and i probably wouldn&rsquo;t worry to much about how we&rsquo;ve evolved to read. You&rsquo;ll read it left to right top to bottom. One big issues is that your name is not very common, well at least in the west it&rsquo;s not. maybe stacking is creating more confusion then it needs to.</div>
