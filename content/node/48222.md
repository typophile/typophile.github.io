  a comparison between LTC Metropolitan and MT Centaur?  I have had a fairly thorough
  go at the P22 web site (including the treasure trove of Gerald Giampa's pages) and
  have only been able to come up with [[http://www.p22.com/lanston/Giampa/Metropolitan-Oldstyle.pdf|this
  file]] containing just the alphabets and a few additional characters.\r\n\r\nI would
  also greatly appreciate comments from anyone who has put Metropolitan to use; there
  was a thread on Jenson-inspired typefaces here some considerable while ago, but
  that predated the issue of most of the Lanston designs by P22.\r\n\r\n\r\n"
