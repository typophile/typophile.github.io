body: 'Hi, i''m brand new here on typophile and also brand new to making fonts and
  fontlab and before anything let me apologize for my bad english, i''m art director
  and illustrator from Brazil. My question is simple: how can i add more characters
  on the FontLab window so i can see other characters for other languages? Right now
  i have the A-Z, a-z and 0-9 and a few others, but i want to make the font available
  for more languages. I see in fontforge a lot of characters that doesnt show on the
  fontlab window. Sorry if my question is silly. Anyway thanks in advance.'

    \"Codepages\" from the mode pop-up, and then choose the code page you want from
    the next menu to the right.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/popup1_4889.jpg]\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/popup2_6166.jpg]\r\n\r\nAlternatively,
    you can choose \"Unicode Ranges\" from the first pop-up and then choose a range
    from the other menu.\r\n\r\nAfter choosing one of these display mode/glyph range
    combinations, the Font window will display the appropriate templates for various
    ranges of glyphs."
