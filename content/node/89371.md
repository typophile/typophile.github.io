  body: "Hmm, can't seem to edit my last post. Apologies for the rushed previous reply;
    I didn't read your request properly the first time.\r\n\r\nI think your sans is
    Franklin Gothic (see above). Your serif looks to be <a href=\"http://new.myfonts.com/search/minion/fonts/\">Minion</a>
    -- I think it's Monotype's but I'm not good enough to say for sure. If someone
    with some expertise might be willing to take a look and give me some idea of how
    to tell different Minions apart, I'd be very grateful!\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\nCyrus"

  body: "It's indeed not the Minion (see image below), the swash \"M\" is much different
    and the Minion hasn't have the discretionary ligatures (that are in the other
    font), plus that there are some minor differences.\r\n\r\nI hope someone recognize
    this font and could help me out.\r\n[[http://i39.tinypic.com/33cq2dj.jpg]]\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/1_4600.png]"
