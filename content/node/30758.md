  body: "B/W laser printers are not going to \"emulate\" offset printing very well.
    \ Toner, which is how laser printers create images, is made of a fine, opaque
    plastic powder that is melted onto the paper. It tends to have a slight shine,
    and reflects light depending on how you tilt the page. Offset printing uses ink,
    which ranges from semi-opaque to translucent, and depending on the stock will
    be absorbed by the paper to a greater or lesser degree, resulting a duller, matte
    type appearance.\r\n\r\nThe printer's halftoning method can also create a look
    which is quite different from offset.  Postscript devices typically use a circular
    halftone dot which can be adjusted via tint density and LPI.  This is the same
    method RIPs on film and platemakers use.  Essentially, you must have a postscript
    capable printer in order to print proofs that will be representative of what a
    common pre-press device will output.  Postscript printers under $500.00 are few
    and far between.\r\n\r\nNon-postscript printers are less expensive, but generally
    have a fixed halftoning routine which won't look like the traditional \"round-dot\"
    you see in most printing.  The ability to adjust a non-postscript printers halftone
    is usually limited to whatever features the manufacturer builds into the printer
    software.  Otherwise, most any 600 dpi or better laserprinter will produce a decent
    b/w representation of offset printing.\r\n\r\nImagesetters and platemakers output
    at very high dpi (2400 to 4800) and are capable of 150-300 line screens.  Laserprinters,
    ever very high end ones, can't create accurate halftone screens above 150 lpi
    or so, because the nature of toner is to \"splash\" when it is deposited on the
    paper. Above about 150 lpi, the gray just gets muddy or darker. \r\n\r\nI'd say
    your best bet would be to go with the entry-level HP Lasehjet 5200.  It's around
    $1400.00.  You'll get HP's postscript emulation (not true postscript, but close
    enough) and full bleed 11.0\" x 17.0\".  Plus the HPs are workhorses.  They just
    print well for a long time. I've been using mine for six years with no trouble.
    \ \r\n\r\nI've bought many things from Provantage over the years, and they are
    always the best on price & speed.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.provantage.com/hewlett-packard-hp-q7543a-aba~7HEWD0K3.htm"
