  body: "\"Est. 2011\" and \"Kitchen Co\" are in Alternate Gothic or a condensed weight
    of Trade Gothic. \r\n\r\nI don't know an exact match for \"DeCourcy.\" It might
    be a customized version of the one of the above, although the R looks more the
    one in Helvetica Rounded Condensed Bold.\r\n\r\n\"Website...\" is Bernhard MT
    Condensed."
