  weight? Eg: Goudy. <BR> <BR>And why do fonts with OSF always put them together with

  body: ' &#62; why do fonts with OSF always put them together with the Small Caps
    or something? <BR> <BR>Not always, but usually, yes; because the &#34;default&#34;
    style of a font generally has to appeal to the lowest common denominator, and
    the LCD is comfy with the numerals lining up tidily. Since you&#39;re not there
    to explain to each user why they should prefer OS figs, you eventually end up
    with lower sales... <BR> <BR>hhp '

    TARGET="_blank"> Formata</A> is a nice sans and has OsF available. They&#39;re
    in the <A HREF="http://www.bertholdtypes.com/adobe_lib/080337000.html" TARGET="_blank">
    expert set</A>, so you&#39;ll either have to keep swapping or use a font editor
    to rearrange your own OsF version. These used to be marketed by Adobe, but I think
    you can only get them through Berthold now. <BR> <BR>A couple of the Font Bureau&#39;s
    sans serif fonts have OsF available -- Benton Gothic, Berlin Sans, and Petr van
    Blokland&#39;s <A HREF="http://www.fontbureau.com/fonts/font_frames.tpl?cart=1036447081260870&amp;fontname=Productus"
    TARGET="_blank"> Productus</A>. I think the last one comes with OsF standard.
    The others you may have to request specially. But if you find TheSans too costly,
    these may not be in your price range either. <BR> <BR>-- K.

    version of The Sans: a reduced number of weights at a reduced price. It&#39;s
    a great bargain: we recently had a client of ours purchase a multi-user license
    for 100 users for the new house style we designed for them, and it didn&#39;t
    make the slightest dent in their budget. Check Luc&#40;as&#41;&#39;s work out
    at www.lucasfonts.com. Brilliant stuff: he&#39;s been called the new Frutiger.

    make these nifty orange links in my posts... '

    sticking out his tongue? :-P <BR> <BR>Oh, which other fonts comes with these hybrid

    that <A HREF="http://www.daidala.com/loire.html" TARGET="_top">loire</A> is one
    such &#40;font&#41;. Now that I notice the hybridness of it, I must say that they
    are really brilliant.
