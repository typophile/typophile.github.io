body: "I make lots of fonts, but here's a problem I've had a few times and I can't
  figure out how to fix it.\r\n\r\nThe problem is with Microsoft Word users on a Mac.
  I make a handwriting font\r\nfor 'em and they say it loads fine, and prints fine,
  but the tops of the tallest letters\r\nand some of the bottoms of letters (descenders)
  are being cut off on-screen in Word.\r\n\r\n\"When I type onscreen, the tops and
  bottoms of some of my loopy letters are cut off.  It does not print or email that
  way though.\"\r\n\r\n\"When I use the font in Microsoft word it cuts off the top
  of the font visually on the screen. The 9 looks like a 4 and the R has no top horizontal
  line. Similar things happen for other letters and numbers. Funny thing is that it
  prints correctly.  It just doesn't look correct on the screen!?! (10.5.2 for OS
  X, WORD 2004 11.3.8)\"\r\n\r\nSo my question is...\r\n\r\nWhat's the best way to
  correctly set the ascender and descender values in my Fontlab files for fonts that
  I've already created?\r\n\r\nHow many different ascender/descender values do I have
  to set to get it to display correctly in Word?\r\n\r\n-chank\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: "I was going to say OS/2.WinAscent and OS/2.WinDescent are the fields you'd
    need to tweak, but then realized you said the clipping is with Word <strong>for
    Mac</strong>. In that case I'm guessing what you need to tweak are hhea.* values.\r\n\r\nA
