  way.\r\nIt has down to earth prices.\r\nHas a clean feeling along with a home-like
  feeling. (famous for their fresh baked bread).\r\nThe place has warm colors.\r\n\r\nAm
  I on the right direction?\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nElsi.\r\n"

  body: "I think while the type is very appropriate, the extrusion thingy takes away
    some of its elegance and seems to unbalance the whole logo. Its spiky appearance
    that doesn't really match the roundness of the letters, so it looks like a foreign
    element. It also reminds me more of a pineapple or a tomato rather than a pomegranate.\r\n\r\nIf
    I were to chose between the two, I would too select the bottom one.\r\n"

    existing font looks like some kind of Souvenir to me? And I personally think \r\nit
    looks surprisingly fresh in this, but inherently has a sort of softie retro vibe.\r\nIf
    that's intended: great."

  body: "I agree w/ Lex, script is not a good option. \r\n\r\nFirst looks quite good,
    but I have two nitpicks. First is the font outline, it seems to be taking away
    from the 'home' feeling you are after. Second is the placement of the 'flower'.
    I'd move it closer to the top of 'g' because right now the area between it and
    the 'r' looks rather cluttered."

  body: "epsilicon,\r\nI took off the outline. I agree.\r\nRegarding the placement
    of the flower: I wanted the flower to replace the \u2018ear\u2019 of the letter
    \u2018g\u2019.  So there will be a smooth continuity from the letter \u2018g\u2019
    to \u2018r\u2019. \r\nDoes it still look clutter after removing the outline (#1)?
    \r\n#2 & #3 are different versions of the flower placement.  They look odd to
    me. (It is already odd as the flower is not aligned with the circle pivot..)\r\nWhat
    do you think?\r\n\r\nThanks :-)\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/pomegranate15a_5866.jpg]"

  body: "Typeface-wise I think it's better, but the \"pomegranate sprout\" is hard
    to recognize as such. It looks more like a grass bunch, and it will probably continue
    to look like that under Ms. Tiffany's suggestion. \r\n\r\nWhy not try and use
    your original idea here, either with G or the O ? I'd also consider removing G's
    bottom-right extrusion, i.e. make it look like G in [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/processtype/locator-display/black/characters.html|Locator
    Display]]."

  body: "Step back and don't over think it. You were onto something with the first
    set of ideas.\r\n\r\nYou can almost feel the flavour of the pomegranate mix with
    the warmth of the bread ovens. The new concept, in my opinion, feels more like
    a thick cut of steak. \r\n\r\nThe small flourish on the g's ear was brilliant!
    Adds a glint of magic. Like Miss Tiffany was saying the round shape of the <em>o</em>
    may be better suited to the treatment. And, grow that sprout. Bring out this fun
    feature so people will actually see it."

    that of a pomegranate. It needs to be pointy, like [[http://www.producepedia.com/images/commodity/pomegranate.jpg|such]].
    The version of it that you had in your original version was the closest to the
    real thing.\r\n\r\nAlso, the single color version is better between the last two
    .. that's unless you want to go with a high-contrast colors, like dark gray for
    the text and red for the extrusion (which could actually look quite nice)."
