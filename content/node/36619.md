    it would really be the font renderer, not the OS, that would have problems with
    OpenType-ness, right?  Unless maybe there's something odd about the font file
    that causes the default font managers to have some trouble, but that sounds a
    bit fishy.\r\n\r\nI vote for they just want three times the money.  It makes sense
    though, as they say it's their largest font by glyph count, and the average Western
    European will just be using the Latin script.  While he might only use that, he'd
    still be getting three times more than he'll use, and so if they didn't split
    the font into three version, they'd rightfully charge two or three times more
    for their font.  So, perhaps it's being nice to those users who only need one
    of the three.  \r\n\r\nThat's just a guess though.  I do call BS it being an OS

    OpenType fonts do work, there is no feature support, which is what the \"Pro\"

    about!! (I hate when this happens!!) Has it occurred to you to do some research,
    including e-mailing the foundry, before jumping into conclusions?\r\n\r\nThe P22
    London Underground font triggers the same OSX bug that was found when Arno Pro
    was being developed:\r\nhttp://docs.info.apple.com/article.html?artnum=304821\r\n\r\nAlthough
    huge, Arno's glyphset is dozens of glyphs smaller than P22 London Underground,
    which made it possible to find a workaround for the above OSX bug. Unfortunately,
    the same was not possible to do with P22's font, despite Paul Hunt's efforts."

  body: "<em>I vote for they just want three times the money...I do call BS it being
    an OS limitation.</em>\r\n\r\nNo, actually it is three times the work to separate
    them out since all of the fonts are available as sub-families. The end price of
    the full font system is the same as originally planned. If someone wants just
    one script, they will actually be paying LESS. Because of stylistic variants increasing
    the glyph count to over 5000, there are problems with earlier OS behavior. This
    is not a marketing scheme or gimmick. Unless we demand all of customers have the
    latest OS, there are some issues. It has nothing to do with application support
    of OT features. The fairest workaround for the widest customer usage ended up
    being splitting each script up. If anyone has made 5000+ glyph fonts and has a
    better solution, please let us know. And if there are further question, please
    do email us directly.\r\n\r\nThe P22 blog post was an honest explanation without
    going into excruciatingly boring detail.\r\n\r\nThank you Miguel for not sugar
    coating it :)"

  body: 'I''ve had to troubleshoot a lot of font related computer problems, and I
    can say that platform level bugs are the worst. This is because one by necessity
    must assume that the probability of their existence is small or everyone would
    know about it. In the case of the premier foundries, the actual specifications
    and feature support are being tested at the OS level. I sometimes define whether
    a font is "good" or "functional" based on whether it works in basic applications
    like Notepad.exe or TextEdit.app. So, it''s not insane to be skeptical about OS
    bug complaints. It''s also possible that the "bug" lies in some nebulous region
    that is better described as "compatibility". If only a couple fonts fail, the
    platform vendor could simply describe the problem as a lack of support for a particular
    feature. BTW, P22 London Underground, Arno Pro, and Mac OS are all things I would
    like to use if possible. '

    do with a portion of the font file that lists all the glyph names, if this list
    is over a certain size, Mac OS will encounter problems including crashing of the
    system. The only way to test to see if you're in the safe range (that i know of)
    is to build (or test building) your font with the AFDKO tools.\r\nUnless you're
    using really wacky long names, i think 1500 <em>should</em> be safe."

    in Mac OSX 10.4.8 and earlier. (CID-keyed OT CFF fonts go through a different
    \"pipeline\", I think)\r\n\r\nBoth MakeOTF and CompareFamily \u2014 available
    in the [[AFDKO]] \u2014 have a test to assess the fonts and will output an error/warning.\r\n\r\nTo
    calculate it \"by hand\", do the following:\r\n\r\n1. Open <em>Terminal</em> (Mac)
    or <em>Command Prompt</em> (Windows), and type\r\n<code>tx -dcf \u20131 My_Font.otf
    \ > output.txt</code>\r\n<strong>tx</strong> is also available in the AFDKO. The
    kit contains the document <strong>CommandLineHowTo.pdf</strong> as well.\r\n\r\n2.
    Open \"output.txt\" in a text editor and search for \"### String INDEX\". You
    should find something like this\r\n<code>### String INDEX (000012b3-000074f2)\r\ncount
    \ =2823</code>\r\n\r\n3. Startup Python and type (Use your own values; I'm using
    the values above)\r\n<code>2*2823 + (0x74f2 - 0x12b3)</code>\r\n\r\n4. A number
    will be output \u2014 in the case above is 30797. If this number is equal or greater
    than 32768 (32K), then the font will trigger the bug.\r\n\r\nIn sum, the problem
    happens if\r\n<code>(2*count + String Index table size)  >= 32768</code>\r\nOne
    way of reducing the number is by shortening the glyph names*. Other strings such
    as the font's Full Name and the Copyright may also contribute to the size of this
    number.\r\n\r\n*Keep in mind that glyph naming rules still apply. In Arno Pro,
    we managed to get away from the problem by using <strong>uniXXXX</strong> names
    for most base glyphs, and <strong>uXXXX.x</strong> for most alternate glyphs."

  body: "Miguel is correct that CID-keyed fonts avoid the problem. Specifically, because
    they have no glyph names (they are \"CID-keyed\" rather than \"name-keyed\").\r\n\r\nIn
    our fonts, we ran into the problem for the first time right around 3000 glyphs.
    It would be an odd font with 2000 or fewer glyphs that would trigger the problem.\r\n\r\nInterestingly,
    it turned out we'd come *really* close several times before, and just hadn't quite
    gone over the OS X string limit prior to Arno. It was really hard to debug, too,
    because there was nothing wrong with the font and the trigger was not at all obvious.
    We did eventually figure out it was at the OS level and Apple helped sort out
    the exact issue.\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\nT"
