<p>Hello Typophiles,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m aiming for something quirky and light hearted. My approach was to design a rounded face which has some humanist character and a little bit of contrast between sharp and soft. There&rsquo;s influences from Gill, DIN and Futura in there.</p>
<p>Unothodoxly, soft edges have been used around the perimeter and straight lines on the horizontal terminals (e.g the tips of the r, l, t and s). My thinking was this would give a nice soft shape to the outline of the word, whilst allowing letters to sit tightly together harmoniously without awkward negative space. I.e. this: || not this: )|</p>
<p>This is my first font so I&rsquo;d appreciate your comments!</p>
<p>Cheers,
Pete</p>
<p>&hellip;FYI this is the second revision. PDF is attached.

		<div class="commentbody"><P>Before we begin thinking the GHD IV Styler is following the same trend as video & DVD players, lets take just show just a few major differences. Firstly, the GHD IV Styler has almost nothing realistic competition. The GHD IV styler is widely regarded for a consumer and high end (hairdressers) while the number 1 hair styling tool.Secondly, as techniology developes the money necessary production reduces thus retail prices reduce. Well my answer suggestions that GHD haven’t handed over, any reduction in production costs with the retailer (salon owners). In fact cost prices have gone up resulting from <a href="http://www.louisvuittonpursebag.com/"><strong>louis vuitton bags</strong></a>  a surge in the RRP. Here we are at in the event the GHD MK1 to <a href="http://www.coachfactoryoutleti.org/"><strong>coach factory outlet</strong></a>  Mk3 were discounted one of the a RRP of ??99, the actual MK4 GHD styler provides a RRP of ??119.</P><P></P><P>Exactly what continues to be lowering the retail prices? The result we have found simple. Online competition, with online retailer endeavoring to out do eath other ghd hair straightener for being the lowest priced website for GHD IV Styler . I personally, work at a hairdressing salon <a href="http://www.coachoutletonlinepicke.com/"><strong>coach outlet online</strong></a>  and i know which price range of GHD IV Styler. Despite that these web based stores receive massive discounts on there products, they could still merely be making between <a href="http://www.coachoutletonline-bag.com/"><strong>coach outlet online</strong></a>  ??6-8 a hard and fast and perhaps any loss. I possed this with a senior GHD worker from a GHD event in the year. Her response, was which she believed, people were with their company as loss leaders to operate individuals to there sites. In the hope they retain the prospect for <a href="http://www.buyscoachoutletonline.net/"><strong>coach outlet online</strong></a>  future purchases of hair & bath and body goods.I cannot really buy into this theory.Lots of individuals will for sure invest in a straightners without additional shampoos and styling products. So, i’m not really really sure the way this works, in the form of long-term business strategy. The very first thing for several though, would be that the consumer might be gaining from these reduced prices. </P><P></P><P>In order <a href="http://www.coachpurseoutletss.net/"><strong>cheap coach purses</strong></a>  to find out about GHD and locate the ideal price on GHD hair straighteners, <a href="http://www.cheapcoachbagusas.com/"><strong>cheap coach purses</strong></a>  then visit our website GHD IV Styler Stockists.Stories about Britney Spears and her hair disasters are not uncommon, but was damage to britney’s hair just before the infamous shaving incident caused buy faulty, broken or damaged ghd hair straighteners? Faulty ghd’s usually are not all that uncommon and so they can on occasions over-heat and cause terminal damage to curly hair. Maybe Britney must have used a ghd repair service, there are a couple companies these days which can participate in a ghd repair shop with regard to ??19.95 likely the biggest ghd repair company in england and wales is Ion Originals Ltd. they run websites that include www.ghdrepair.co.uk It is advisable to get those ghd’s inspected they were eradicated or become faulty.Common ghd faults include: sparking, buzzing, intermittent power, cable faults & over-heating. </P><P></P></div>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>There doesn&rsquo;t appear to be any rationale for the mixture of flat and rounded termini. Some bottoms are flat, some rounded, as are other random stroke ends.</p>
<p>Many of the glyphs were put together with pieces (was this done with fontstruct?) that don&rsquo;t always fit together properly. The PDF example shows gaps at some magnifications. This also causes mis-alignment at some magnifications (the &lsquo;a&rsquo; shows its vertical parts at different widths, for example, with a pixel or two difference on-screen)</p>
<p>The connections between curved and straight strokes are inconsistant - the &lsquo;h&rsquo; is markedly different from the &lsquo;n&rsquo; for example. Most of the glyphs have a constant stroke width, so those that are markedly different tend to stand out like sore thumbs.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure what characteristics make a character &lsquo;male&rsquo; or &lsquo;female&rsquo; or &lsquo;neuter&rsquo;; or even humourous, comical, or serious! I don&rsquo;t tend to either laught at or fantasize about glyphs.</p>

<p>Yes ecclectic is what I&rsquo;m going for – my aim isn&rsquo;t to produce a generic rounded font. The type was drawn from scratch in illustrator with a few bits borrowed across letters (hence the slightly sketchy stitching). The new version I&rsquo;ve uploaded is more refined.</p>
<p>There is some thinking behind the round/straight edges, I&rsquo;ve edited my original post to explain things.</p>
<p>What are your thoughts?</p>

<p>One thing I would suggest is to look at letter adjacency frequencies*. What I mean is you should try to manage the distribution of rounds versus flats depending on what is most likely to end up next to what.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Your Version 2 still has stylistic inconsistencies. You say that the horizontal termini are square, but they&rsquo;re still rounded on the y,  the crossbar of the t and both ends of the z.  The bottom of the &lsquo;j&rsquo; is ambiguous - maybe that&rsquo;s your intention, but it has no equivalent elsewhere in the font.  The corner in the &lsquo;a&rsquo; makes it look like a ball ending - again, the only one with that particular appendage.</p>
