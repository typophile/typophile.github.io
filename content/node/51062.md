body: "Does anyone have a name for this font. It's a blocked athletic font with serif's
  but the \"S\" \"G\" and so are notched. I can find similar without the notch but
  none with. If you have any ideas where I can find it for down load for free... I'd
  be stoked. If I have to buy it, also good to go.\r\n\r\nI tried to attach a photo?\r\n\r\nthank
  you....\r\n"
