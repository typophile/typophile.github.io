    case, I would a&#41; remove the top serif and straighten that side of the stem,
    and b&#41; lower the top of the bowl as much as possible without distorting the
    form too much, in order to create space for the crossbar. Something like this

    alt="Suggestions for Cooper Black /dcroat/"> <BR> <BR>It is more important in
    designing diacritic letters for languages to preserve the particular identity
    of those letters than it is to preserve the particular details of a serif. This
    means being aware of the primary distinguishing features of the letter, in this
    case a bar that crosses through the ascender, and coming up with a way to preserve
    those features while preserving as much as <i>possible</i> of the characteristic
    details of the typeface design.'

  body: interesting... <BR>i had read in Typo 10 that &#34;In extra bold characters,
    the part of the slash inside of the character may be omitted.&#34; So i wasn&#39;t
    particularly shocked to see the URW example &#40;I just hadn&#39;t seen anything
    like it before&#41;. I personally think John&#39;s is a better solution; but not
    being a native reader of any language that uses  this character, i don&#39;t know
    which is the &#34;preferred&#34; design.

    suggests that for the lower case eth, shortening or omitting the bar can be done

    <BR> <BR>Whether or not this also applies to the Croatian dyet is an interesting

  body: I suspect the comment in Type 10 is based on examination on what has been
    done in some fonts, rather than consideration of whether these solutions are good.
    As a <i>last resort,</i> I think the URW solution is acceptable, but my point
    is that they were not in a last resort situation, because there were other options
    available which are more successful in preserving the normative form of the letter.

  body: 'But the vast majority of non-western fonts are not made by natives. Were
    the comments in Typo 10 re. Croatian letterforms written by a Croat, or were they
    written by someone who has looked at a pile of CE fonts and recorded what he has
    seen? I don&#39;t remember. In any case, I&#39;ve read e.g. rubbish written about
    Hindi type by Indians: basically, I think it is good to be cautious when someone
    says &#39;This form is good/normal/acceptable&#39;. What are the criteria of judgement?
    How historically extensive is this view &#40;often, it represents what one or
    two generations have gotten used to from type, and is cut off from the traditions
    of the script -- you know that from your experience of Arabic&#41;? I certainly
    wouldn&#39;t say that one should discount the views of native readers -- definitely
    not --, but one needs to approach them critically just as you would any other
    view. You certainly can&#39;t assume that because someone is a native he or she
    can &#39;feel&#39; a way to a <i>design</i> solution.'

  body: 'No doubt that Type 10 is a great resource. It is good that it even considers
    e.g. how Croatian diacritics might be made for ultra heavy types: this is the
    sort of question that much commentary on diacritic design fails to consider. I&#39;m
    just saying that years of research into the typography of other languages have
    encouraged me to take most information with a big grain of salt, especially when
    someone says &#39;This is the way we do it in our country&#39;. My immediate response
    is &#39;How long have you been doing this in your country?&#39; Often, they don&#39;t
    know, and research indicates that it is a new development, frequently in response
    to some technical limitation, or a time saving measure &#40;certainly, URW&#39;s
    solution for the Cooper Black dcroat is a lot easier and faster than mine&#41;,
    or, ironically, something introduced two generations ago by an outsider.'

    the part of the slash inside of the character may be omitted&#39; clearly refers,
    from the preceding context, to the /oslash/. It is not at all clear that the same
    applies to all the barred and slashed characters discussed in this section.

    <BR> <BR>Of course Filip Blazek&#39;s article on diacritics is very good. But
    it&#39;s not really something you obtain with your parents&#39; genes.  <BR> <BR>This
    doesn&#39;t necessarily prove anything <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"
    ALT=":-&#41;" BORDER=0> Polish type designers usually don&#39;t have a clue how
    to make Czech haceks, and Czech type designers often make awful Polish ogoneks.  <BR>
    <BR>The U.S. are immediate neighbors to Mexico &#40;where Spanish is spoken&#41;
    and Canada &#40;French spoken in Quebec&#41;. Nonetheless, I doubt an average
    American type designer has seen a lot of French-Canadian or Mexican-Spanish typographic
    material.  <BR> <BR>Similarly, an average Polish has seen more German, French
    and English typography than Czech or Hungarian.  <BR> <BR>In Europe, typographic
    traditions differ from country to country. Actually, I can say that in the countries
    of Central and Eastern Europe &#40;the former &#34;Soviet Bloc&#34;&#41;, the
    knowledge of typographic traditions of the neighbors has been limited in the past
    years. In the past century, the typographic cross-influences in the countries
    of that region were less intense than in Western Europe.  <BR> <BR>Designing good
    characters for a certain language requires serious research and a sensitivity
    in balancing international and local issues.  <BR> <BR>Altogether, the CE characters
    in URW fonts are rather poorly designed. Based on my intuition, I can say that
    URW&#39;s solution in Cooper Black is convincing:  <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/4100/68608.png"
    alt="URW&#39;s dcroat in Cooper Black"> <BR>But so is John Hudson&#39;s draft.  <BR>
    <BR>However, what one would need to look at is the Yugoslav graphic design tradition
    from the 2nd half of the 20th century.  <BR> <BR>In my experience, the Czechoslovakian,
    Polish and Russian display typography of that period gives best clues for analogical
    cases in the questions of Polish and Czech diacritics in display typefaces, and
    of Cyrillic display type design.  <BR> <BR>You can take a look at some Yugoslavian
    posters at: <a href="http://www.musicman.com/yugo/yugo.html" target="_blank">http://www.musicman.com/yugo/yugo.html</a>
    <BR> <BR>Unfortunately, most lettering there is uppercase-only, and I haven&#39;t
    been able to spot a bold dcroat in this collection.  <BR> <BR>Conclusion: I have
    a sense that URW&#39;s solution is acceptable.  <BR> <BR>Regards,  <BR>Adam'
