  body: "It\u2019s a fabulous book about engaging the senses with design, largely
    via anticipation. Hara is one of Japan\u2019s most eminent designers with a western
    audience in mind. He discusses his ideas about stimulating touch, doing really
    deep design, and the color white, among other things. Intellectually, it\u2019s
    at least on par with Alan Fletcher, but written from the point of a Japanese ascetic
    who happens to be an intellectual giant."
