  cover really interests me. It is nearly symmetrically balanced and has iconic imagery
  that resembles hieroglyphics. I've always been a fan of iconic imagery because it
  reminds me of logo designs, and in the case of this cover, many logo designs on
  one composition. The typographical hierarchy works well as it pushes the author
  and his Pulitzer Prize winning accomplishment. The red coloring shows fire and energy
  and the blue has a pastel characteristic that frames the composition nicely and
  helps keep elements from going crazy. The stock adds an extra dimension because
  it is a very course, highly texturized stock that is rough to the touch.\r\n\r\nDesigns
  like this make me jealous that I didn't come up with them first."
