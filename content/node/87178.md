  be using Typekit as part of the architecture.\r\n\r\nOur corporate print fonts are
  WHITNEY (for pull-quotes, small headlines, tabular data, etc) and SENTINEL for headlines
  (always BOLD or BLACK) and copy. We're not slavish, but would love to find something
  that either apes the forms or echoes the tensions of these faces from the Typekit
  library.\r\n\r\nThoughts?"
