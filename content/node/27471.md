body: "i apologize if this has been mentioned elsewhere, but the search function seems
  to be broken (a search of leading and InDesign yielded zero results).\r\n\r\nis
  there a way to automatically give the line spacing of carriage returns one value
  within a story but have the leading be a different value? \r\n\r\nfor instance,
  i want a list of resources in the back of a book to be set 9/11, but would like
  the line spacing between each item to be 9pt (instead of 11pt).\r\n\r\n(see attachment
  for example)\r\n\r\ni am using InDesign 3.0.1 on OSX 10.4.6\r\n\r\nthanks for any
  suggestions!"

  body: "You can set the spacing between items in the Paragraph palette. There is
    an option for \"space after\" or \"space before\" any given line with a hard return.
    Also, be sure that your units are set to points in InD preferences (although you
    can use whichever units you'd like).\r\n\r\nSometimes these options are hidden
    by default on this palette, just click the arrow (upper right corner of palette)
    and \"Show Options.\"\r\n\r\nThese measurements can also be set in a paragraph
    style."
