  I&#39;m doing a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deseret_alphabet">Deseret
  Alphabet</a> font &#40;Unicode 10400-1044F&#41; complete with an OSX keyboard layout
  for a research project. I&#39;ve played around a little bit with Apple&#39;s command
  line font tools, dumping out xml, editing, then reincorporating, but it always chokes
  when I try to change the unicode hex values to anything higher than 8 bit. Letterror&#39;s
  TTX has the same problem. &#40;I even downloaded and applied their patch--it still
  chokes with a long integer error&#41;  Anyone have any ideas? <BR> <BR>Point of
  interest: OSX comes with a Deseret Alphabet font included--who knew? Hint: it&#39;s
  in the Symbols font. It&#39;s very ugly, but cool that it&#39;s there. I just need
  to figure out how to reencode a utf-8 font into a utf-16...'

    <BR>On the Deseret font in OS X: I think once a non-latin script  <BR>is added
    to Unicode it is somehow rolled into the standard  <BR>Mac and Windows installs,
    correct?'

  body: You can do non-BMP Unicodes in FontLab. You just have to give the glyphs names
    in the format &#34;u10412&#34; etc. You can&#39;t see the non-BMP Unicode correctly
    in FontLab, but it should work in the exported font. <BR> <BR>Note that the title
    of your post is a little off; UTF-16 is simply one of the ways of representing
    Unicode &#40;and requires two code points to represent a non-BMP code&#41;. From
    a font perspective, you don&#39;t use two code points to represent a non-BMP Unicode,
    but instead use a 32-bit cmap &#40;UTF-32&#41;. The font itself will actually
    have both a 16-bit cmap and a 32-bit cmap. <BR> <BR>Cheers, <BR> <BR>T

  body: 'Thomas: Thanks for the pointers. I didn&#39;t know that about unicode fonts.
    I guess I need to read up on the unicode standard. I&#39;ve never really worried
    about it up to this point. I tried your  fontlab tip, and it didn&#39;t work.
    The characters come out mapped differently. Any other ideas?'

  body: Nope. That was my understanding of how to do it. Maybe I got some key detail
    wrong. You could try browsing the FontLab user forum on MSN. I know this has been
    discussed there. <BR> <BR>Regards, <BR> <BR>T

  body: If you have a Windows machine, you can run the fonts through Microsoft&#39;s
    free <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/typography/developers/volt/default.htm">VOLT</a>
    tool. This is a program for adding OpenType Layout features to a font, but it
    also rewrites cmap tables, so you can use it to map glyphs to non-BMP characters.
    However, you have to use surrogate pair values, not 32-bit scalar values, so <a
