  target="_blank">http://www.become.co.uk</a>. I have settled for the time being on
  a basic two pane layout. I think it is quite good, but lately my judgement has been
  quite iffy. <BR> <BR>What do you think? Have you any recommendations? <BR> <BR>Matthew

  body: 'Matthew, I like your site, but I think you could actually &#34;play&#34;
    more with your typefaces. I get the feeling of &#34;work&#34; from the sans serif
    you have used, but I don&#39;t get &#34;play&#34; for the title &#34;play&#34;.
    I don&#39;t get &#34;contact&#34; or &#34;all about me&#34;. See what you can
    do, you may want to even do &#34;stuff&#34; by hand to personalize the &#34;about&#34;,
    since it is about you. Plus I don&#39;t see much contrast. Just some things to
    think about. '

  body: Matthew, <BR> <BR>I&#39;m getting a javascript error on loading the page.
    It says it&#39;s expecting a &#41; on line 75. <BR> <BR>I tend to like lots of
    white space which you have in abundance. I also like understated use of Flash.
    One look at my very-much-in-need-of-an-overhaul website <a href="http://www.aquatoad.com"
    target="_blank">www.aquatoad.com</a> will confirm that. <BR> <BR>On the downside,
    the colors arent my favorite, but they&#39;re ok. The html text &#40;Helvetica
    I think, I can never remember&#41; it dificult to read because of the tight spacing
    combined with grey color. Try verdana or georgia for better legibility. <BR> <BR>Regards,
    <BR>Randy

    -- I do like the colors, but with that much white space the green seems too light.
    Should the navigation from section to section be within the color bar and not
    floating on the bottom? The type seems a little on the light &#40;thin&#41; side
    as well. The four-in-a-row game had a couple of bugs in it. <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/sad.gif"

    locked size? smaller? '

  body: Sorry about the errors... no-one had responded to the post and I started to
    play around with some sneaky javascript... anyway, got rid of that now. I&#39;ve
    been thinking of changing the fonts around... I may even go for a serif, or something
    like optima..  <BR>Tiffany, what connect four bugs did you get? I hoped I had
    finally debugged everything...  <BR>  <BR>Randy, join me in my subtle use of flash...
    it seems that people expect Flash to be used in a flashy sort of way... when its
    used subtly people object  <BR>  <BR>I may change colours subtly. The green does
    need to be darker... <BR> <BR>What fonts would you recommend to describe &#39;play&#39;
    and &#39;contact me&#39;... I don&#39;t want a typorgy... <BR> <BR>Matthew
