    or unusual characters, the system may reject it. If this is not the case, then
    it\u2019s something else and we\u2019ll need the Punchcut IT guys to figure it
    out. I know that there have been some problems with uploading from certain IPs
    and configurations.\r\n\r\nTerrence \u2014 Your blog post was flagged as spam
    because of all the artist links and subsequently placed in the moderation queue.
    I think that\u2019s why you got the server error message (not sure why the system
    responds with an *error*, but that\u2019s not my department). It\u2019s been cleared
    now and you\u2019ll find it in the blog section."
