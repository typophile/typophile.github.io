  illustrator Christoph Niemann has a monthly [[http://niemann.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/08/19/rock-paper-scissors-2011-style/?pagewanted=all|column
  in the NY Times]]. I love the grotesk face he uses on these recent illustrations,
  but can't quite figure out what it is \u2013 those terminals (and the 'a'!) are
  a little too quirky for WhatTheFont.\r\n\r\nBut not for you \u2013 what is it? Thanks
  for the help!"

  body: Looks like a precursor to Helvetica, but too tired to hunt for it now. Maybe
    someone else recognizes it.

  body: It's very close to Akzidenz Grotesk. The ascender of the t doesn't quite match,
    and the a's design (featuring the spur) seems to have been borrowed from a thinner
    weight.

  body: "Definitely a Helvetica precursor, I agree, but not even close to either of
    the Akzidenz families I have (Berthold and\u2026 Adobe?). Ryuk, Theinhardt is
    excruciatingly close, but the 'e' and 'a' are quirkier in the face pictured above
    - thanks for turning me on to that font, though.\r\n\r\nWe're still hunting. Chris,
    maybe you've rested up? I believe in you, typophiles."

  body: On review, I can't decide if it's Theinhardt or not. Laying the a sample over
    this image in photoshop, it looks like the 'e' and the 'a' are indeed different,
    but I'll be damned if everything else isn't exactly the same. Am I crazy?

  body: "It\u2019s definitely Theinhardt Medium. If there is anything quirkier or
    slightly different, it will be the result of low resolution and hinting. The ascender
    of the t, the bulky a and the exclamation mark match perfectly. "
