body: "I have a project where I'd like to show this concept to a client (they use
  a lot of translucency in their brand, so this would be a great way to show it off,
  and make a cool piece). The piece itself is a pocket folder, but the transparent
  layer, with its white underprinter to create areas of solid color could just be
  the outside of the folder and bound to it, or act as a slip cover.\r\n\r\nCan anyone
  point me to good online examples of this technique? I really don't want to have
  to go drop $300 at the Japanese book store to show the client what this looks like,
  I only have a couple books at home that use it, but nothing like the fantastic ones
  I've seen from Japan.\r\n\r\nI'm not even sure its actually mylar plastic being
  used, so I'm having trouble even getting anywhere with good. The word transparent
  plastic is too common to make for good searching.\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\nThis is
  a reasonable example of what I am looking for more examples of.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/136_3543.jpg]"

  body: I can't help you with examples, but the plastic is probably not mylar. It's
    most likely polycarbonate, or polyester, both of which come in grades made for
    screen or offset printing (I work for a company that has a division that distributes
    the stuff). Makrofol is the brand of polycarbonate we sell. I'm not sure what
    the polyester is.
