  I noticed a year or so ago this font - &#39;Riven&#39; - in more than one place
  and generally under the category of &#34;Famous&#34;. I remember reading somewhere
  how it&#39;s supose to be based on some movie or game. I liked it and downloaded
  it. A couple of weeks ago I started working on a high school magazine cover and
  I thought I could use it. <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/47894.gif"
  alt="riven.gif">  <BR>Today I wanted to make sure it&#39;s not a ripoff of a commercial
  font. I did the GIF you see and run it throug &#34;What The Font&#34;. A unpleasant
  surprise: it&#39;s <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/perpetua-2/perpetua/testdrive.html?s=RIVEN+a+free+font&amp;p=48">Perpetua</a>
  with a fancy &#39;V&#39; and slightly modified &#39;R&#39;. <BR> <BR>Is it your
  advice to stop using it? <BR> <BR>My single comfort is the fact that I was attracted
  by a quality font. <BR> <BR>PS I tried to post this in &#34;General Discusion&#34;
  but I believe being un unregistered user it was impossible.'

    R does not belong with this typeface.

  body: '&#34;That R does not belong with this typeface&#34; <BR>Now I can see it.
    But when I first found it I ignored both the &#34;R&#34; and the &#34;V&#34; and
    I kept it as an elegant text serif. <BR> <BR>Btw, now that I can see the whole
    familly, I realize I really-really like Perpetua.<IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"

  body: Alex you are not alone. I really like Perpetua too. Other will disagree, but
    I choose to ignore them. If you license the whole package from Linotype &#40;at
    <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/PurchaseOptions?familyid=6080" target="_blank">MyFonts</a>&#41;
    you can get it for $10.50 per ... nice price.
