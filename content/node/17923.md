  body: "According to Martin Kotulla, SoftMaker is finally updating the lowercase
    letter \"y\" in altered glyph form to have no extra line at all for \"F761 Deco\"
    (an actual clone of Florentine), which appears to be just like FontBank's Flourish
    and Southern Software's Toque Display SSi/SSK.    And yet, SoftMaker is finally
    creating \"G855 Blackletter\" in the design of Florentine, numbered from Gyros
    Gotisch, and comes in \"regular\" and \"dfr\" layouts.\r\n\r\nThose two font names
    are finally appearing on \"MegaFont XXL 3.0\" (for home users) and \"infiniType
    4\" (for designers) - both premium-quality typeface collections from \"SoftMaker
    Software GmbH\" that are finally being released around May 27, 2014."
