body: "I based this logo sketch off a font I found. I thought I found it on myfonts.com
  but can't seem to dig it up again. I want to further refine the idea and would like
  to purchase the font. I connected the \"t\" and the \"s\" in my sketch, they were
  not joined in the original font (as far as i can remember).  Hopefully the \"t\"
  and the \"y\" might ring a bell for someone.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance for all your
  help!"
