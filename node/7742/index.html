		<div class="commentbody">You mean folios that move up and down in relationship to the length of the text above, yes? So the folio is in a fixed relationship to the text block, rather than to the page. <BR> <BR>This can <i>look</i> nice, and avoids having the odd folio off by itself, but it is functionally, well, moronic. I would classify this practice as the tyranny of aesthetics over functionality, because although it looks nice it largely defeats the practical purpose of having folios in the first place. Let's say you have looked up a chapter or section heading in the table of contents, or have looked up a entry in the index, you then need to be able to find the relevant page. So you flip through the book to find the appropriate folio. Obviously this is very much easier if the folios are always in a fixed position relative to the page.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Sorry for the confusion. <BR> <BR>The image presented is somewhat correct. In this case I was refering to trade fiction. When you spec a composition for a type compositor to set, you can request the use of bouncing folios. A folio bounces when a page is being adjusted for bad paragraph breaks. Usually bad breaks are adjusted by making a page one line longer or one line shorter. With bouncing folios on a short page the folio moves up with the bottom line of text, and vise versa on a long page. When flipping through the book you will notice the page numbers fluttering up and down with the last line of text on each page. I think this seems strange but my boss feels that this is the correct way to design a text page. She thinks that page numbers should stay the same distance away from the last line of type on all pages. I think the page numbers are there for a functional-navigational purpose so they should stay fixed in place. I think it's distracting to see a page number fluttering up and down when you are trying to  find a specific page. When you are only dealing with a minimum amount of elements it is to me a necessity to harmonize those elements.Bouncing folios are strange, simple as that.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Here's an idea: <BR>When you have to adjust the bottom of the page, omit the page number entirely. <BR>Except maybe when both pages in the spread are like that, then hopefully they're going in the same direction (both one up or one down) and you can put both page numbers in. For spreads that have one short page and one long page, decide if you want it to be slightly ugly or microscopically* dysfunctional. <BR> <BR>* Because chances are quite low that the reader will choose to open up to that spread to regain his bearings, and is then forced to go one spread back or forth. In comparison, all readers <i>will</i> traverse that spread at one time, so maybe aesthetics becomes more important. <BR> <BR>hhp</div>
