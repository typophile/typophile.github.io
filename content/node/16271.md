    client Puma? I've read the original is not allowed to be used for private personalizations
    and at the Puma store in Roma they said to know nothing at all about it.\r\nCan
    I have some hints about it?\r\nThank you!\r\nGiuseppe"

    I think that Vincenzo used Photoshop and made that sentence with the charters
    avaible on the internet. And not with fonts.\r\nOn the internet there is an image
    where is written pumaville - motorstore find a store. I could write italia. The
    fonts of the numbers are not perfect.\r\n\r\nIs possible as well that he has access
    to the font for some reason.\r\n\r\nI hope that someone make these fonts avaible.\r\n\r\nOnizuka."

    some of these other threads found here on Typophile for more information.</a>

    Vincenzo has it for sure. In some way or another he got it maybe he produces T-Shirts
    or he is working for Dalton Maag. I can't believe that nobody (a good designer)
    didn't make a replica of that font.\r\n\r\nOnimiki."

  body: "Ok guys I discovered why Vincent has the font.\r\n\r\nHe is Vincent Connare
    his website is connare.com\r\n\r\nHe is a PRO ! He is working for Dalton Maag
    Ltd.\r\n\r\nGiuseppe there is no way that he will make the font avaialble to the
    comunity. We are normal user he is a PRO!\r\n\r\nThe only way is that a capable
    person will make a replica font based on Puma Pace.\r\n\r\nI thought Vincenzo
    was a \"normal user\" but he is one of the best in the world.\r\n\r\nOnimiki.\r\n\r\np.s.
    is funny because the font file is a small file HA HA ;-) I'm sure it will be avaible
    in the future when it won't be used anymore!"
