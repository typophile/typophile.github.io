    there are board games. I have just been putting together a web site for one: http://empire-game.org.
    My game collection is kinda large, too: http://www.boardgamegeek.com/collection/user/tphinney?own=1&subtype=boardgame&ff=1.
    \r\n\r\nAlso have been into role-playing games, am about to start running the

    games on BrettspielWelt? I often play a few rounds of Dominion there to wind down
    and get my mind off type before I go to sleep.]"

    make indian dishes (including the British/Indian Chicken Tikka Masala) like curries,
    eggplant dishes, naan (it's fun to bake your own naan, and flavour it with a lot
    of yogurt) chinese/vietnamese/thai foods, southern foods...\r\n\r\nI also do quite
    a heavy amount of baking.  rhubarb pie with crispy crusts, flaky scones, and I
    have a famous carrot cake."
