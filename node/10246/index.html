Also I would find it interesting if there could be something like a quality scale in which those quantification could be enclosed - and from which you could compare different editions. <BR> <BR>Because I also want to try to bring awareness of skilled sophisticated typography to people, who don&#39;t know anything about typography, than &#34;take Arial for your letters, it looks modern&#34; - and those people often look at typographical questions as &#34;that&#39;s a matter of taste &#34; - a quantifiable look on evenness could help. <BR> <BR>So it would be very interesting if you could cook something up. <BR> <BR>ms</div>

And both by the use of bold verse-numbering within the text.  <BR>And of course fonts themselves have different values of evenness &#40;it would be a very interesting  thing to me to measure if Rotis is objectively mor uneven than other fonts - and how much&#41;. <BR>But at least there should be a result for the complete perception of evenness. <BR>Maybe in another step you could take out one factor by the other &#40;maybe by filling white spaces with sample text or neutral color from the page itself and so measuring the evenness of type only&#41;. <BR>I really don&#39;t know if results will be significant, and if Fournier analysis would lead to usable results, but I would like to try. <BR> <BR>So maybe you can show me how to make Fourier analysis of a text column or cook something that can help. <BR> <BR>Sprechen Sie auch deutsch?</div>

What Fourier analysis can do is to give you some spatial characteristics you can compare with your own evenness ranking; you&#39;ll be the judge of correlation.  <BR> <BR>Also, Fourier works best on stems, lines, and spacing; it is less usable for analysis of closed areas and round features - if you want numbers, you will need some other basis for those.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Sergei, <BR> <BR>of course, I never thought mathematical analysis could replace human experts. I also much more rely on skilled human experts.  <BR>And I think a judgement of significance has to be done - and maybe at the end of testing the result will be that Fourier analysis or any other mathematical approach won&#39;t show anything. <BR> <BR>I&#39;m not keen for numbers - I only followed some trace that may lead to another confirmation of old human skills - and maybe my German scientific brain &#40;-half&#41; demanded food ;-&#41; <BR> <BR>There is/maybe one point I am setting some expectations on: <BR> <BR>Human experts in typography are not regarded highly in our time. Especially by the millions of people who think with a computer they now can do the same things as learned typographers before. <BR> <BR>I&#39;m working with half of my time in the church. And though church has been a custodian of the word and long time also of the written form of the word, nowadays there is almost nothing left of skill and care. <BR>Asking experts when setting printed matter is a rare exception. Often their judgement is taken as personal taste. If I tell sometimes &#34;this or that layout is uneven&#34; people don&#39;t believe because the edges of the column are mathematical straight. They look for things that can be measured. They don&#39;t see inner unevenness. It takes some time to open eyes &#40;of course that&#39;s a job I like very much: open eyes for aesthetical decisions, care and skill for words and script&#41;. <BR>And it would help, if there were a mathematical way to show: &#34;Here you can see in an objective number, what experts already have said about that layout.&#34;  <BR>Maybe it would help to raise typographical awareness.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">&#62;Can anyone point me towards some reading on the topic of typographic color and how to design for optimal color when creating a text face? <BR> <BR>Maths and theory are not the answer, Paul. <BR>If you want to understand text color, I would suggest finding a sample of letterpress printing which you think is immaculate, and attempting to mimic it by recreating the typeface digitally, by eye, from scratch. That means looking at the printed type through a magnifying glass, rather than scanning it and tracing it.</div>
