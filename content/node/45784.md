  a german design studio.\r\n\r\nI really love the pure modern look of the face, particularly
  the lowercase 'a', the kinky 'g' and the numbers. \r\nIf anyone knows where I can
  find it, I'd like to use it for a  project I'm working on.\r\n(alternatives are
  obviously welcome)\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/mg05_4416.jpg]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/mg06_6363.jpg]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/mg07_3484.jpg]\r\n\r\nfind

    for Palatino/Aldus I would say. Unfortunately it doesn't have osf or small caps."

  body: "I know it's a very subjective thing to suggest alternative fonts, not knowing
    exactly what you are looking for, but in terms of general feel Mark Jamra's [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/itc/jamille/|ITC
    Jamille]] is a bit darker, but it is also a transitional style and does have SC
    and OSF.\r\n\r\nYou can also use the [[http://www.bowfinprintworks.com/SerifGuide/intro.php|Serif
    Font ID Guide]] to find other serifs with characteristics you like from Slimbach.
    It's not only an ID tool. You can compare text samples of many of the fonts to
    see if the color and openness are what you are looking for, and see the italics
    at the same time.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
