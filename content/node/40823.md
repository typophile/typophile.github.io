  questions about schedules and readings in order to address the pressing question
  of fonts. Being a terribly understudied pupil on the matter, I'm currently trying
  to find a good sans serif font to go with Adobe Jenson Pro. Any suggestions?\r\n\r\nMy
  broader question concerns any practical advice - dare I solicit a method - for pairing
  serif and sans serif. I know rudimentary things about coupling fonts with like x-heights,
  but I'm having a hard time putting this precept into action. Take pity! Enlighten
  me velociously!\r\n\r\nthanks, \r\nG "

    Sans</a> was designed with Jenson in mind. I've never used it but could be worth
    a look.

    off the content of the syllabus in order to choose a new font I've always wanted
    to try out.  I'm almost never happy with the pairings I get between serif and
    sans serif, however.  I was happy once with a presentation template that used
    Adobe Garamond for titles and Cronos for body text.  Perhaps [[http://www.myfonts.com/search?search%5Btext%5D=cronos|Cronos]]
    is a typeface to check out.\r\n\r\nI also saw a nice set of handouts that used
    Garamond for body text and Univers Condensed for headings.  In that case, the
    contrast seemed to work out well.\r\n\r\nST"

  body: Thanks much to both of you for your recommendations. The Legacy Sans certainly
    is an appropriate pairing, but also makes me wonder if I should go for a less
    rooted-in-centuries past serif font after all. The Garamond/Univers pairing is
    quite elegant; wish I hadn't sworn off Garamond...
