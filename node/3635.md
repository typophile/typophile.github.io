  body: That&#39;s an old logo, so I wouldn&#39;t root for the Chalet lead. The &#34;g&#34;  <BR>and
    &#34;r&#34; will be decisive I guess, as the &#34;s&#34; looks like an inverted
    &#34;e&#34;  <BR>with a bit cut out, and the customization on the &#34;t&#34;
    is very simple  <BR>to execute.

  body: Ok, thanks Yves. Didn&#39;t know its age. They started with Century Gothic
    maybe.

  body: There are some very un-typographic qualities to it, like the way it&#39;s
    perfectly geometric and doesn&#39;t compensate for optical effects. I don&#39;t
    think it&#39;s based on any font. You could reproduce it with a compass and a
    straight-edge and I suspect that&#39;s how it was done.
