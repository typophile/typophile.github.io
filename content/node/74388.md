body: "Hello,\r\n\r\nI have to ask for a help as this issue is bothering me for a
  long time now.\r\nI have made a logo for my activity as a motion designer. It is
  in the style of sign-painted logos, like \"Dodgers\" baseball team, Cadillac, or
  maybe some House Industries Sign Painter or similar genre.\r\nThe idea came through
  because I wanted to put the accent on well skilled small design studio, rather than
  big post-production or design agency. This is all ok and I am pretty happy with
  it. \r\n\r\nThe things usually become complicated when you have to design something
  for yourself and my big problem is matching the logo with the right typeface. The
  logo seem to be not so friendly with different typefaces.\r\n\r\nI thought I can
  go for something that will contrast hand-painted nature of the logo... something
  like Lineto Bitmap 1 so it can clearly say that it is activity connected to the
  screen. It actually looks nice on screen, but it I am really not satisfied when
  it comes to the print.\r\nIn the print I would go for something like Franklin Gothic
  Condensed in different weights. This one seems to fit the logo, but does not work
  so good on screen and I'm afraid it is too much classic.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure...
  I'd like to avoid using different typeface just because of different medium. Is
  there any typeface that can match both, have a screen aspiration in it, and still
  be very elegant in print... can still match something like sign-painter logo? \r\nAm
  I making too much problems out of nothing?\r\nPlease help.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nCed"

    you are talking about your visual identity, so it's important, but the problem
    isn't insoluble.\r\n\r\nSince it sound like your logo could be called \"Classic,\"
    your typeface choice ought to be Classic too, complementing rather than competing
    with the \"bug.\" As you note, typefaces that look good in print don't always
    look good on screen, but that problem can be solved with faces that have a wide
    range of weights, such as Futura. The light version could be used for print, and
    the book version--slightly beefier, but still noticeably lightish--could be used
    for print.\r\n\r\nAlternately, if you want a little more style, but a classic
    feel and a LOT of weight choices, you might check this out...\r\n\r\nhttp://new.myfonts.com/fonts/marksimonson/proxima-nova/"

  body: "Hi Oldnick,\r\n\r\nThanks a lot for your advice, especially about complementing.\r\nI
    like how the extra condensed Proxima Nova sits with the logo and I like its readability
    at the small sizes. I love fat and light weights independently. I will definitely
    consider it for my identity.\r\n\r\nThanks again,\r\nCed\r\n"
