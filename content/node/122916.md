  Firefox (35.0.1) all the fonts have jaggies and are not particularly antialiased.
  In Chrome, IE or Opera the fonts look fine, though (using win7). I have done a fresh
  install of FF in a virtual machine but the font display is still bad. I would like
  to ask the forum if  if you too see these differences?\r\n\r\nI attach two images
  for Chrome and Firefox to illustrate the difference in rendering.\r\n"
