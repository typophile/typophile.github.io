body: "I always disliked the Georgia font because of its old-style numerals. Not any
  more. I just discovered the advanced font ligatures in Office. Office 2010 and 2013
  now includes advanced typographical features. The OpenType features gives you the
  option to change number spacing to 'tabular' and the number forms to 'lining'.  See
  this link for instructions: http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/13484/use-advanced-font-ligatures-in-office-2010/\r\n\r\nNow
  I can use Georgia without being annoyed with the old-style numerals (see attachment).
  Thank you Microsoft!\r\n\r\nWho else likes these new Microsoft Office OpenType features?\r\n"

      The old-style numerals are the only think I dislike about it. Glad to have discovered
      this new option in Word. Same for Constantia...\r\n\r\n"
