  body: "The text is from the Think Different campaign which was OMG 1997! \r\n\r\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Think_Different
    \r\n\r\nSo the pic is probably from that era too.\r\n\r\nThis one is closer\r\n
    \r\nhttp://images.businessweek.com/mz/04/44/0444_20innova.jpg \r\n\r\nAnyway here's
    the text... \r\n\r\n\"Here\u2019s to the crazy ones. The misfits. The rebels.
    The troublemakers. The round pegs in the square holes. The ones who see things
    differently. They\u2019re not fond of rules. And they have no respect for the
    status quo. You can quote them, disagree with them, glorify or vilify them. About
    the only thing you can\u2019t do is ignore them. Because they change things. They
    push the human race forward. And while some may see them as the crazy ones, we
    see genius. Because the people who are crazy enough to think they can change the
    world, are the ones who do.\"\r\n\r\n"
