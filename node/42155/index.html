@missgiggles - There are loads of specialties that can live under the umbrella of Graphic Design; identity design, interface design, publication design, information design, and so on. 

I usually only call myself a graphic designer in when speaking to people who either wouldn't get the specifics or wouldn't care. :) Doctors are a (somewhat) reasonable analogy. Most of them practice within a specialty or sub-specialty like cardiology, neurology, etc. When asked what they do for a living, much of the time they'll just tell you they're "a doctor".

It's called Visual Communication, and that's what all of the schools are now calling it and offering degrees for.</div>

I would argue against that. Given that graphic designers are about clarifying communication, the term 'designer' isn't all that clear.

Fashion designer?

Interior designer?

Industrial designer?

I think it's not a bad idea to use an appropriate adjective or two if one can.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">It's not quite the same thing, but "Art Director" has a similar perception problem. Here is what Saul Bass had to say about it:

"For years, my mother wondered what I do; that is, what i <em>really</em> do. She new I did art work--and actually she was very happy about it despite some vagueness that surrounded the matter. Her only concern was that I should make a living, and I seemed to be doing all right. But finally her curiosity overcame her timidity, and, I think with some prompting from the neighbors, she finally asked me what it was that I <em>really</em> did.

"I pulled out a proof of an ad that I had designed and I showed it to her and said, ‘Mom, that's what I do.' She looked at this and said, ‘Oh, I see . . . ' and she pointed to a photograph in the ad and said, ‘<em>That's</em> what you do?' I said, ‘Oh, no, you see, there are photographers--and they are specialists--they know all about cameras and things of that kind, and they make the photographs.'

“‘Oh,' she said, disappointed, ‘Then <em>this</em> is what you do?' I said, ‘No, that's typography. You see there are special organizations who do nothing but set type--you know, Garamond, Caslon, etc. . . . these people do that.' Again she was a little disappointed. She pointed to the lettering and we went through this again. Finally she looked at me somewhat concerned, and said, ‘Well, now, what do <em>you</em> do?' I said, ‘Well, you see, I conceived the whole thing, and then I get all these people together and get them to carry out the process.' She looked at me very coyly, and said, "Oh--you devil!'”

Given that "graphic design" is one of the few growing professions nowadays (or so I hear) I think more people generally know what it means than used to be the case. The next question is usually "what do you design" and then you can get into specifics. And no, Uncle Al, it doesn't mean I draw the pictures.

But we do a little bit of everything. In addition to designing (layout/print/books, in my case) I art direct photo shoots, check proofs, read copy for mistakes, typeset, lots of things that fall outside the job description but that (I hope) make me more valuable to my clients.

Loved you sharing the Saul Bass story from “The Design of Advertising” by Roy Paul Nelson.  Nelson was my instructor and mentor in college.

I finally gave up years ago when trying to explain to my grandmother what I did for a living and just said "I make things pretty."  To which my grandmother FINALLY responded with "Oh, that's nice" and she was totally content.

The solution there is simple: have two business cards.

Unless your clients tend to need BOTH a new logo and a new office designed at the same time, you'd be fine presenting one card or the other depending on the client.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">This was about 20 years ago. I got to know the woman who ran the general store in Victoria Beach (Manitoba), a hardy old soul, and one day she asked what I did for a living. I told her I was an art director in an ad agency. "Oh Dear," she said with a look of disgust, "Well, I suppose somebody has to do it."</div>

Mark: Thank you for sharing the Saul Bass story. 
I know my tutors mum still does not have a clue to what he does. He just gave up in the end. I guess it depends on the type of work you are doing at the time. </div>

		<div class="commentbody">missgiggles -- the beauty of the design industry is it's possible to not only be creative in terms of the work you produce, but also create your own job on your own terms (if you're willing to hustle). People who receive graphic design training can go on to be any myriad of things, not just a graphic designer at a graphic design firm who does graphic design projects like brochures, logos, and websites. There are all sorts of niches and different worlds to live in within the umbrella of the design industry, and a lot live on the peripheral edges. I think of myself as a graphic designer, but I've had the opportunity to work on projects that overlapped with photography, fashion, industrial design, interior design, etc., and I'd say that's fairly typical for designers.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Thanks FeeltheKern. It makes sense. Everyone just branches out where life takes them as opportunities arrive in their way. Sounds great. I visited a design firm in London recently and they suggested that brochure work etc would slowly disappear and become digital based. What does everyone think? Will there be a time where paper based work will be a thing of the past like books etc? Will we be reading online? I know you can already do that but a majority of things be digital based. Agree or disagree?</div>
