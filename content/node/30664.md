  target audience is men and women ages 20-30. It focuses on preserving nature and
  is designed to encourage people to recycle. The posters measure 8x16 inches. The
  pattern on the left of the layout is a grid of recycle signs to add depth and create
  texture. The bottom right corner of the series is rounded and flows with the recycle
  sign to reinforce the theme and draw your attention to a line of information on
  the bottom. It reads, \u201CThe Rethink Nature campaign strives to protect, manage,
  and restore the world\u2019s forests.\u201D It also has a link to go to if you are
  interested in learning more about the environment and want to make a difference.\r\n\r\nI
  am struggling with the main typography. My prof wants me to choose typefaces that
  resemble the characteristics of the illustration, each being different. She says
  the Spruce poster is fine, but the blossom should be more organic, but helvetica
  rounded is too much. I am thinking serif for the Leaf poster, maybe something something
  pointy? I am currently using Whitney. \r\n\r\nI am open to all suggestions. There
  is also talk of moving the type up and bumping the illustration down to seperate
  the text. It makes the illustrations harder to work within the space, so I am looking
  for a solution we both can agree on.\r\n\r\nThanks"

  body: "Whitney works great for me. If you want to go serif, try softer, more organic
    faces like Dolly or Winchester.\r\n\r\nTo get around the problem of choosing different
    typefaces (and thus risking some consistency), play around with the words. If
    your message is strong enough, the type doesn't have to be treated much differently.
    You can use color to accentuate the keywords, too. After all, aren't we talking
    about a poster series here?\r\n\r\nBy to by, this <em>definitely</em> calls for
    some Chris Lozos action :-)"

    treatment of the type. If they are stand alones I agree with your professor. Look
    at ad campaigns like the new VISA campaign. It uses the same type look throughout
    its posters and POS material.  '

  body: Thanks for all the feedback. I will work with your suggestions. I've been
    struggling on what to keep consistent and what is OK to switch up. This is my
    first series, so I will keep you posted.
