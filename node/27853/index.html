<div class="post-content e-content" itemprop=articleBody>Hey everyone,
let me sum it up for those who haven't seen my (new to typophile) previous posts.
I'm in the middle of redesigning my business card. So if you could take a look at its different "color" versions, and let me know what you think I would appreciate it a lot. They're going to be offset printed on translucent Cromatico™ paper. The "DESIGN CARE" font is a Trade Gothic Condensed and my eMail address is a Kursivschrift Stehend. I was also thinking to use the "@" of the Digital Kauno font, which is pretty cool and "exotic" I would say...
I usually use (nice...) Trade Gothic Condensed + Minion regular and italic in all my stationery documents but thought it was time for a little change...

<div class=card-body>
<div class=commentbody>Ok this post has been read (at least) 38 times! C'mon guys!… Does it look that bad?
I have also another version that includes my telephone number, written in CrashNumberingSérif (does anyone know this font?). Thought not to put my telephone number on it at the begining, and rather write it down, to create a "closer" relationship with the (future) client... But now I'm thinking : "nah, drop this weird idea, this is not a date!"

<div class=commentbody>Your images aren't attached, that's probably why nobody has commented. Are you saving your files as rgb .jpg's? I think there is some info on how to attach files somewhere here on the site.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Personally, I would put all necessary contact info (name, phone, address, e-mail, website) on the card, and not write it down. That is not standard procedure, and may seem strange to someone. I think I like the middle one with the reversed out type. What about doing the background as a duotone and not just gray? The image seems a bit flat to me. I think the type is fine, you're obviously going with a fun look. Although I must admit "design care" is not a term I'm familiar with.</div>

<div class=commentbody>for the picture, it is the background of my website and also a huge panoramic picture on the wall of my office, so this is a pretty important part of my visual identity.
It defines an "ambience", a mood, and certainly my work since I shot it...</div>

<div class=commentbody>About the personal information : I wanted something simple and smart : the only thing I'm willing to add is my number, since I think "DESIGN CARE" says it all about my professional environment and my name is written on my eMail as well as my website. For my address, I work from home and I don't necessarely think that my clients need to know where I live...</div>

<div class=commentbody>So to put eMail + website just seems redundant to me, and I don't wanna take the "reader" for a dummie. I just like to say on this card that this is all the information you really need.
More over this simple (kinda dary, I agree...) type of business card with very few text allows me to strike the attention on the different elements of the design. I know it a pretty strong statment make here...</div>

<div class=card-body>
<div class=commentbody>The legibility of the email's typeface is of concern, specially if that is the only contact information on your card. I think usability has been sacrificed in the pursuit of style. The knockout version on the small point size, specifically on the "v" and "ini", makes it a difficult read.

<div class=commentbody><strong>OOPS, I just noticed your other threads to have newer versions of your card. So just ignore my comments!</strong>
Drduckling, I think you might want to listen to all the things people have said, and do something with it. Instead of contradicting everything with the reason why you did something. :) Thats the whole idea of posting something for feedback...
I think only putting an e-mail adress/website on a businesscard is a bit odd. You are actually limiting your potential clients on ways to contact you. What if a potential client wants to contact you from somewhere other then home or work? (i.e. somewhere with a internetconnection). They cannot call you by phone... and they might just not bother at all.
Writing your phonenumber down when giving away your card, does not look too professional too.
