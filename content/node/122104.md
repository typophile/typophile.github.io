body: "I continued working on this handwritten typeface and while I made alternates
  to replace double vowels before, I would prefer to replace both vowels individually.\r\n\r\nSo,
  right now I have the following feature:\r\nsub a a by a_a;\r\n\r\n/a_a features
  two variants on /a that are both different from the default /a. Essentially what
  I want to do is replace /a /a by /a.alt1 and /a.alt2 instead of /a_a, because I
  want to maintain the ability to apply tracking to all the letters.\r\n\r\nNow, I
  actually have this feature working with the following code:\r\nsub a' a by a.alt1;\r\nsub
  a.alt1 a' by a.alt2;\r\n\r\nHowever, this doesn't seem to be the most beautiful
  solution and I'm not sure if there are instances where this feature won't work appropriately.
  Is there a better solution than this? Can it be done with only one line?"

    some real limitations. I did a connecting script this year and discovered just
    how much feature code won't do in certain situations. To me that's a real shortcoming
    since connecting scripts with alternates have been around for well over a hundred
    years."

  body: "I suppose this has no bearing on what you're talking about, but just to clarify,
    the typeface I'm currently working on is not a connected script. It's more akin
    to Comic Sans.\r\n\r\nSo is the feature code I'm working with now (the second
    example) proper?"

  body: Yeah, that's how it's done. You should probably add "sub a.alt2 a' by a.alt1;"
    so that if there are, say, seven a's in a row, the last is not noticeably the
    odd one out.
