  a lot.\r\n\r\nAll selection of print items for a client is print collateral?\r\n\r\nWhat
  other ways are there to say it?"

  body: The term has been used primarily by advertising agencies, whose main work
    appears in media (newspapers, magazine, TV and radio, billboards, etc.). Collateral
    items do not generally appear in media, but are standalone pieces. So, brochures
    are collateral; ads in a magazine or newspaper are not.

  body: Posters in a subway are (transit) advertising; signs on billboards are (outdoor)
    advertising. Posters and signs in stores are (point-of-purchase) advertising.
