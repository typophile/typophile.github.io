  with a better eye that me to point out some problem. \r\n\r\nI'm not to sure about

  body: "The counters in b,d,p, and q appear to be off-center. The curve of the u
    appears to be lopsided -- it's tighter on the left.  Many of the curved strokes
    appear to be slighty variable weight, which looks like an accident to me.  I think
    the bottom  bowl of the B should be the same as the bowl in the P.  The bottom
    half of the 8 should be bigger than the top.  \r\n\r\nI like the direction of
    this; I particularly like the g & k, and the bottom serif on the r & i. I like
    the diagonal curve on the Z, z, 4 and 7; but I think it needs to be more asymmetrical
    on the Z and z to not look like a mistake. \r\n\r\nHope that helps."

    I make sure the one I'm making differs from it a little more.\r\n\r\nta."

  body: The 'Macmillan' part looks like [[http://www.typography.net/type/bliss.htm|Bliss]]
    Extra Light; could the 'Palgrave' part be a customisation? Maybe not, actually.

  body: "Hi Ben, yes the Macmillan part is undoubtedly some variety of Bliss as that's
    our corporate font; the Palgrave part (ie the bit where the P reminded me of Jonathan's
    design) is more of a challenge! ...if it does turn out to be an actual font and
    not custom lettered I'd be interested to know.\r\n\r\n[Sorry J: this seems to
    have drifted away from your original thread ... do post your next revision when
    it's ready!]\r\n\r\n____________________________________________________\r\nEver
