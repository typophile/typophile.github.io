body: "Okay, so i have 2 Word issues:\r\n\r\n1) I'm generating Windows PostScript
  Cyrillic fonts. I'm using FLS5, running Win XP SP2. I set the mode in FLS5 to codepages
  and selected MS Windows 1251 Cyrillic. In the Encoding options, I have chosen \"1251
  Cyrillic\" under supported codepages and \"Cyrillic CP 1251\" under Microsoft Character
  Set (and \"Cyrillic\" for the Mac script). With these settings, The fonts work just
  fine in Adobe InDesign CS3, but i cannot figure out how the fonts are behaving in
  MS Word 2007. In Word the fonts generally default to Times New Roman.\r\n\r\n2)
  For OpenType and PostScript (latin) fonts, the bold style-linking is not working
  correctly in Word 2007. I have linking set up so that Heavy is the bold version
  of Medium. Does it matter that the bold style weight is not actually bold? Style
  linking works correctly in TrueType fonts generated using the same files and settings
  as the OpenType fonts and style linking works for all fonts (PS, OT, TT) in InDesign
  CS3.\r\n\r\nThe fact that these fonts work as expected lead me to believe that these
  are Word bugs, but i'll be glad to be proven wrong. If any of you can help me resolve
  these problems, I'd greatly appreciate your help. Thanks for looking!"

  body: "1. When you say 'PostScript Cyrillic' fonts do you mean Type 1 or CFF PostScript?
    I recommend making the latter and supporting both the CP1251 and also the Western
    European CP1252. Actually, I recommend supporting CP1252 in any font you make.\r\n\r\nWord
    has what I certainly consider a bug which means that even if a font supports a
    codepage that supports the ASCII Latin subset, such as the Windows Cyrillic or
    Hebrew codepages, Word will switch to a default font when you try to enter Latin
    characters from such a font, because it is looking for CP1252 support. You may
    be able to input Cyrillic characters correctly with your font. Have you tried
    that? If it is like the issue I hit with Hebrew codepage fonts, the font switching
    should only happen if you try to input the Latin subset characters.\r\n\r\n2.
    Hmm. This ring a bell, but I can't remember what the issue is. I suspect Adam
    Twardoch could tell you."

    that a try. btw, i owe you a proper thank you for your time at TypeCon. i promise
    i'll have something in the mail soon. :D\r\n\r\nThe Bold problem is strange because
    Word is applying faux bold when there is a proper bold installed that <em>should</em>
    be style-linked."
