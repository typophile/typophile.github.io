  body: 'It could also be solved in another way. Like the rankings of ATP, or rather
    <a href="http://www.artfacts.net/index.php/pageType/artists">ArtFacts</a>. Combine
    number of typeface releases (and the general consensus regarding the quality of
    each release)  with years in the business. Add status within organizations such
    as ATypI/SoTA etc., articles, papers, lectures, exposure in correct design magazines.
    Different foundries will generate different amount of points (so a foundry ranking
    is also necessary). Of course context will matter, custom type for an international
    fashion magazine will beat custom type for a provincial news paper. Unless the
    latter is given proper exposure in a Correct design magazine. In contrast another
    factor will be numbers of licenses sold. Regarding the quality aspect this factor
    won''t be as big as some other factors, but making fonts that sell well generates
    a certain respect within the community, so why not. '

  body: "> <cite>I find more people referring to me as Mr. Shinn, rather than Nick.</cite>\r\n\r\nI've
    recently addressed Nick as Mr. Shinn. Why? Well, lots of kids in my community
    refer to adults by first name. Growing up, that's the last thing I'd have ever
    done. Mister was a sign of respect. It took a long time to get to be a dad, and
    by God, I've earned the rite to be referred to as Mr. Koppa, and I don't care
    what the rest of the parents say. I'll admit that Nick's [[http://www.askoxford.com/concise_oed/avatar?view=uk|avatar]]
    does command some automatic respect, and that may be what triggered my impulse.
    But I did have a pirhanna named Mr. Chin when I was in college, which is also
    a contributing factor. Nevertheless, having been a member posting infrequently
    for only a couple months, I find Mr. Shinn to be respected, especially in light
    of his recent unprofessional comment about the Holiday Inn logo. And Mr. Vanderveen.
    I also like Mr. (Gerald) Lange. And just about everybody else, really. It's fun
    to be connected to everyone.\r\n "
