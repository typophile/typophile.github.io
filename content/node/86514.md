body: "The DINfun Pro fonts are special versions of the classic DIN 1451 Mittelschrift,
  far removed from the original typeface's serious and no-nonsense roots. I have made
  them as companions to the classic, with some some very different expressions, complete
  with a large multilingual character set. Time to spice up that DIN profile! :)\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/CheapProFonts-DINfun_Pro_450_6447.jpg]\r\n<!--break-->\r\n4
  themed packs have been made so far:\r\n<strong>Effects Pack:</strong> a collection
  of \"simple\" transformations of the basic font, but with plenty of manual corrections
  to make them work well.\r\n<strong>Removed Pack:</strong> a collection where parts
  of the letters have been removed to create different effects.\r\n<strong>Grunge
  Pack:</strong> a collection with some typical grunge style treatments.\r\n<strong>Halloween
  Pack:</strong> a collection of scary, sharp and disturbing variants - perfect for
  seasonal party invitations, ads, and whatnot.\r\n\r\nThe packs are just $30 each
  (and includes the Plain cut as a bonus) - or get the single fonts for our usual
  $10 each.\r\nhttp://www.cheapprofonts.com/Newsletter_11_03\r\n\r\nLike the idea
