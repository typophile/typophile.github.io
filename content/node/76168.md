  body: "It\u2019s actually pretty simple. Set up a shape with the gradient on it,
    set up the extruded path, and then wrap the blended shape over the 3D object using
    the \u201Cmap art\u201D option. Then tweak and update to get the gradient you
    want. Drawing a tapering 3D path is probably the most complex and time-consuming
    part of process, although I imagine that once you figure out how you\u2019ll be
    able to do it in about five minutes. "
