<div class="post-content e-content" itemprop=articleBody>I'm making a 4 font family (R,I,B & BI) for a customer. <br> <br>What I didn't realise in the beginning , due to vague job descriptions, is that the font needs to be TrueType hinted ( it's primarily is going to be used on screen). <br> <br>And, since that's something I know almost nothing about I'm asking this: <br> <br>Can I somehow "postscript hint" the font, open it in Fontlab, and then convert the settings to truetype hinting? With a good result? <br> <br>Or shoudl I just try to auto-tt-hint it? <br> <br>Or get someone to do the hinting for me? <br> <br>/peter</div>

<div class=commentbody>I'm doing the work through the ad agency & they haven't informed about who their client is yet. It's very hush-hush for some reason. I'm hoping to learn more soon.

<div class=commentbody>It looks like you're working blind here. <br> <br>One suggestion is if you've already hinted the PostScript fonts get hold of a Windows NT4 machine and use its Type1 installer to convert the font (including hints) to TrueType - this used to give the best (free) results. The converter pre-dates ClearType so won't give good results in this is the target. <br> <br></div>

<div class=commentbody>Peter, <br> <br>In FontLab 4.6: <br> <br>1. Start with Type 1 autohinting, do Autoreplacing. <br>2. Refine your Type 1 hints manually. <br>3. Go to Font Info and do Auto Zones and Auto Stems. <br>4. Refine your stems settings. <br>5. Convert the outlines to TrueType, the contour direction to TrueType and hints to TT instructions. <br>6. Review the results in the TrueType Hinting window. Check the TrueType stems settings, esp. the thresholds where the stems turn from one pixel to two pixels etc. <br>7. Refine the hinting manually if needed. <br> <br>This should give you the quickest results. Note that due to a bug in FontLab 4.6 for Mac, step 6 cannot be easily completed so you may want to use the Windows version. <br> <br>Refer to <a href=http://www.myfonts.com/activity/hinting/ target=_blank>http://www.myfonts.com/activity/hinting/</a> for more links about TrueType and Type 1 hinting. Check Victor Gaultney's notes on hinting in FontLab. <br> <br>Finally, you may want to consult any of the people listed there who specialize in TT hinting. <br> <br>Regards, <br>Adam Twardoch <br>Fontlab Ltd. <br></div>

<div class=commentbody>An educated guess is that you're probably looking at a Symbian based device, which seems to use Freetype... <br> <br><a href=http://www.freetype.org/pipermail/devel/2003-January/008759.html target=_blank>http://www.freetype.org/pipermail/devel/2003-January/008759.html</a> <br> <br>With Freetype the devs may have turned off support for hinting to avoid the documented Apple patent issues. You might want to ask Graham Asher, the guy who posted the linked message if he has any details about if Symbian uses hinting and or the ClearType like sub-pixel rendering supported by Freetype. This should give you some background to the rendering environment. <br> <br>Cheers, Si <br> <br>I don't know much about Symbian, and it may be something else entirely.

<div class=card-body>
<div class=commentbody>In TrueType and TrueType-based fonts, a UPM size that is power of two (1024, 2048, 4096 etc.) gives microscopic performance gain when rasterizing, as opposed to 1000 or 2000. This performance gain was minimally noticable on computers with a 8 MHz clock, but certainly not anymore with a 800 or 1600 MHz clock. <br> <br>The TrueType specification *always* allowed the use of any UPM from the range 0-16384, including 2048, 1000 and any other. 2048 was Microsoft's choice in their own fonts, while 1000 was the UPM size for Type 1 fonts. Since currently most fonts (Type 1, OpenType PS, TrueType/OpenType TT) are produced from the same source, it doesn't make sense whatsoever to scale the glyphs by 204.8 % (from 1000 to 2048) because it introduces a lot of trouble and rounding errors. <br> <br>I guess it will still take a LOT of typing to get the "2048 myth" from people's heads. <br> <br>Best, <br>Adam <br></div>

<div class=card-body>
<div class=commentbody>I'll just add that the available evidence is that this performance gain was related to "bit-shifting" operations specific to the 68000 series of CPUs. <br> <br>Microsoft suspects that it is still relevant, but have been unable to provide any evidence for this viewpoint that I have seen. However, they make it a requirement for fonts being bundled with Windows or Microsoft applications. <br> <br>If one *was* going to scale the font up from 1000 units, and didn't have to worry about compatibility between 1000-unit and 2048-unit versions, I'd suggest scaling it by 2x and then setting the em-square to 2048. <br> <br>Cheers, <br> <br>T</div>

<div class=commentbody>Peter, I'm curious why you say OT/CFF with FreeType doesn't work for you. Is that specific to the FT version on the Symbian system, or in general? My OT/CFF font with PS hints renders fine with FreeType, especially at sizes larger than 18 points (hinting active, autohinting off).</div>

<div class=commentbody>Hello Sergej, this was plain PC TT fonts, not OTF/CFF, since that was the customer wanted. <br> <br>Maybe PS hints works better.</div>

<div class=commentbody>The developers are using an emulator for their software, which I'm not allowed to use, since it's top secret. <br>Therefor I've been sending them the fonts to test themself and give me feedback, in some cases I've gotten screendumps. <br> <br>Just to test in the beginning I did OT/CFF (and OTF/TT) and sent them. But they where unable to install them. why this is I don't know. <br>It could be that I didn't generate them properly (but i'm sure I did, plus there's no scripting), or it could be that the had a new employee that was unexperienced in installing fonts especially OTF. I have no idea. I just got the message that it didn't work. I must presume they know what they are doing. <br> <br>I thought it was a bit weird though because Freetype2 should support OT/CFF.</div>
