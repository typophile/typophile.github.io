  of a 40 page soft back book. The publication will be an architect's monograph to
  be sent to clients and potentially sold in select bookstores. \r\n\r\nWe are currently
  getting quotes from printers for between 2-10,000 copies, and I'm really just curious
  what others would (very roughly) charge for the design of a project of this kind.\r\n\r\nThank
  you, Ed "

    times as much as I would for any other client -- they can be a real pain to work
    with.  :-(

  body: "For an illustrated book I usually charge between $40 and $50 per page. That
    includes design, layouts (plus one round of revised, additional correx at $50/hour),
    typesetting. Does not include picture research, scanning, retouching art, or dealing
    with the printer. \r\n\r\nSo I'd say for a book that short about $2000. But be
    sure to make them understand it's only one round of layout changes."

    (not Ivy League) university press? Or, how much per page for a no-illustration
    book via the same nonprofit press? Your input here is invaluable!

    for them to muck around being stupid making arbitraty changes so charge $ 150
    hour or whatever for changes. Think about how long it will take tou to design
    up a grid, talk to printer,s deal with tthe clients shit and nake an hourly rate
    that you think will keep you happy. If you end up doing the job for less than
    yiou are happy with then you will hate it forever and they will take the piss.\r\n\r\nMy

  body: "thanks very much for all your help. I have a good relationship with the architect
    in charge of the project, however there is the terrible possibility of it going
    to committee, so i will be allowing for acres of revisions in my quote. \r\n\r\nWe
    really want the job, as it may well lead to further work, inevitably it's a delicate
    balancing act; both wanting to give the appearance of a serious outfit and at
    the same time producing a competitive quote. \r\n\r\nThanks again you have all
    been very helpful.\r\n\r\nEd   "

    architects need four revisions."

    be low, and your client is concerned with price over perfection, see if you can
    find a good digital printer. Lower quality, but much cheaper for low runs..\r\n\r\nI
    do prepress for a digital press, and with the right attention, it's acceptable
    stuff. Obviously, it's not going to rival offset anytime in the near future, but
    then again, ask for a large press to print 150 copies of something and they make
    look at you sideways!\r\n\r\nJust food for thought. Comments/criticism welcome."

  body: "Ummm . . . let's clarify something about the number of copies to be printed.\r\n\r\nWhen
    you typed \"between 2-10,000 copies\", did you mean \"between two copies and ten
    thousand copies\"? Or did you mean \"between two thousand copies and ten thousand
    copies\"? If it is the latter, digital printing is probably out of the question.
    Digital printing, in the right shop, is getting very good. But there are not enough
    \"right shops\" around yet.\r\n\r\nNot that this has much reflection on the basic
    design fee. But it may have some bearing on your fee for dealing with the printer,
    who will probably need to show you several sheets and talk about the cost variables
    among them.\r\n\r\npatty's price structure is a good place to start thinking about
    this. But, I, too, worry about what kind of swamp you may be getting into here.
    I do not mean to bash anyone, but very often clients who are not accustomed to
    publishing book-like things don't really understand all that this means. They
    very often need close attention and forthright direction so they may do their
    jobs with as little pain all around."
