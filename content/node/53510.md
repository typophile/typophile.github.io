  \ Web Fonts, if you don't know, is simple in practice, although not supported by
  all browsers.  You upload a font ttf file to your server, and apply it to the rendering
  of webpages.  A List Apart has a good article on it here:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.alistapart.com/articles/cssatten\r\n\r\nI'm
  not sure about the legal issues involved here.  My project uses Arial Rounded (not
  my choice) for all of its headers.  I'd like to upload the Arial Rounded ttf file
  to my server, but I'm not sure if that's legal or not.\r\n\r\nHas anyone tried this?\r\n\r\nthx"
