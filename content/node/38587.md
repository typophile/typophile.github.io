  discourages using them, but I am interested in using interpolation for a student

  tweaking outlines created by Fontlab, or learning to use superlator and generating
  outlines with it.'

  body: "What I do in FontLab is to \"clean up\" the outlines (i.e. make them compatible)
    <cite>before</cite> joining the two masters, then you do not need to tweak anything
    afterwards.\r\n\r\nNot quite sure how Superpolator deals with incompatible contours,
    maybe the results are better than with FontLab.\r\n\r\n[edit/update]:\r\n\r\nJust
    saw on the Superpolator website:\r\n\r\n<cite>The app does not make the glyphs
    interpolatable, the masters need to have the right number of contours in the right
    order, each contour the right number of on-curve points. You know the drill.</cite>\r\n\r\nIn
    this sense, you may want to try MM in Fontlab first and move on to Superpolator
    once you have reached the limits of one-dimensional inter/extrapolation."
