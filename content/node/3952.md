    hard to be clever, at the expense of clarity. I would go back to setting the letters
    separately, and then find a way to combine them inside a compatible shape, to
    make it look more like a monogram. '

    original thinking of clear and simple. The last one has gotten way too busy. You
    should be able to say what you are wanting to say with out adding all the little
    drawings. It may have gotten much to bold too. I think the Northwest Airlines

    your case, you are the client. Ok, here is what I&#39;m going to do if I&#39;m
