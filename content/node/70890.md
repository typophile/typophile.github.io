    bottle - the M and W is different than that of Engravers Gothic. '

  body: "I think Mikey's <a href=\"http://www.houseind.com/fonts/neutrano2\">Neutraface
    No. 2</a> answer is the right one. I think the W was edited to remove the center
    crossing part (at first I thought maybe they flipped the splayed M). The other
    letters all seem within the scope of the alternates within the font. I have not
    examined every sample, but what I saw could be done with that font, I think.\r\n\r\n-

  body: "<a href=\"http://typophile.com/files/Byredo-Parfums.jpg\">This sample</a>
    from the older thread exhibits a number of glyphs that are, as far as I can tell,
    not included in Neutraface/Neutra \u2116 2. Either it is heavily customized, or
    just inspired \u2013 in any case probably custom."

    letters to you think are not in Neutraface No.2? The web site may not show all
    the glyphs, but their printed Neutraface catalog shows all of them (I presume)
    -- there are two G's, K's, M's and W's, and three Q's.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

    but still: G has a smaller aperture, P is wider, S curves more like Futura, A
    bar is higher, middle E bar is as long as the others, \u2026\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/byredo_3612.png]"

  body: "Hmm, you're right Florian. My eyes aren't calibrated like yours. When I see
    structural forms that seem about right I am not always aware if certain proportions
    are off. Of course, since I am already saying that they could have customized
    the font, some of these other differences could also be made as tweaks. Yet in
    reality I don't suppose a design firm would do what I suggested. My bias on this
    forum is to suggest how I think it would be possible to re-create custom work
    without having to duplicate the design process. Shortcuts, if you will; what someone
    with my level of design skill (not much) would do to reproduce it.\r\n\r\n- Mike

    is. Your suggestions are always very helpful.
