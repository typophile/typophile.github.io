    a logo, not a full font)? Have you checked the 'Techno' fonts category at Dafont.com?
    I seem to frequently find 'mystery' techno fonts there.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

    at Dafont, and found three fonts that are similar -- <a href=\"http://www.dafont.com/neogrey.font?nb_ppp=50&text=simplicity\">Neogrey</a>,
    <a href=\"http://www.dafont.com/birdman.font?nb_ppp=50&text=simplicity\">Birdman</a>
    and <a href=\"http://www.dafont.com/zekton.font?nb_ppp=50&text=simplicity\">Zekton</a>,
    but none are identical.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

    work: \r\n\r\nhttp://www.t26.com/fonts/style/Techno\r\n\r\nWhich makes me wonder,
    I rarely see T26 referenced here. Do we not like them for some reason? "
