  forum - so I'll post my actual work.\r\nIt is a logo for a photographer (here seen
  on his business card). His approach is to be a creative, insightful photographer
  and having a high technical standard at the same time.\r\n\r\nWhat do you think?\r\n\r\nthx\r\nJan"

    Is that supposed to be an exclamation point on top of the i?

    it would be: 'Till!' The exclamation should stand for 'idea', 'action'.\r\n\r\nHmm,
    I guess this needs more work if it's not recognizable :(\r\nIs the problem the
    font so that the '!' is not identified as one?\r\n"

    write it out:\r\n\r\nTill!\r\n\r\nTill is a fun word. I don't think you need to
    decorate it too much."

    for this. It's nice work. I had a hard time understanding the skewed exclamation
    mark/upside down \"i\" as well. I tried to tie it back to photography, but couldn't
    quite make the connection.\r\n\r\nI like aluminum's idea. I also like the idea
    for the exclamation mark as the \"i\" but I understand your reservations."

    exclamation points are starting to read as a person to me in many of the versions
    -- random and maybe just me. \r\n\r\nIt could be interesting to try Lex's suggestion
    to use a different typeface for the exclamation mark.\r\n\r\nI like what you tried
    with the camera/tripod (great illustration, by the way) but I feel like the whole
    mark lost a little impact with that treatment."

    it reads a bit like Tili."

  body: "I like the original draft, but agree that the exclamation needs to read better.
    Maybe if the bottom corners angled in a bit more. Maybe reverse the colors. The
    exclamation mark (the idea) could be bright and unconventional green, while the
    'i' (the body) is solid and defined brown.\r\n\r\nOn another note, I'm not sure
    that the logo conveys anything about photography. To me it says that Till is a
    creative person that comes up with exciting ideas.\r\n\r\nMaybe that is enough.
    Love the simplicity. "

    a little bit with the exclamation mark as person idea - but ended up in thinking
    that it looks too much like this icons on the mens rest room (sorry) :(\r\nI have
    a \"inverse\" idea with this, maybe I'll post it later.\r\n\r\n@hola: thanks for
    the suggestions but I miss the \"dynamic\" element here. But maybe its an idea
    to see the whole word as a camera and ... hm, I'll think about this.\r\n\r\n@aluminum,
    spire: yes, I had this symbols in other approaches - but felt the are too much
    in combination with the excl. mark. Although they would symbolize photography.\r\n\r\nRight
    now I'm struggling with the mark in another typeface like some of you suggested.
    Not easy, it tends to loose the simplicity ... I hope I can post some versions
    later.\r\n\r\n"

    fragile. In my opinion not suitable for this style.\r\n\r\nChoosing from these:\r\nI
    would go for the middle and/or bottom of the left column. These are strongest.\r\nAnd,
    in a way the exclamation mark has something of a flash?!?!\r\n\r\nI would move
    the exclamation mark a bit to the right. The dot is not opticaly centered over
