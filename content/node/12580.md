    are taking over.\r\n\r\nI've been using a Ricoh for 3 or 4 years, it's cool, but
    I am considering getting a classic Rollei twin lens reflex as my next camera.
    My grandad used to have one, and I was recently at the Lee Miller exhibit at the
    National Portrait Gallery, and it's what she used. All I need now is a good 2
    1/4' film scanner.\r\n\r\nThe way I figure it, a 35 mm frame is the equivalent
    of 15 megapixels, and a Nikon film scanner will get all that, plus the film grain.
    So it's still OK to use film.\r\n"

    only one you can get that's cheap and usable is one like the Canoscan D2400UF
    that is a flatbed scanner that supports film up to 4x5'' \r\n\r\nI've been using
    an Epson something or other with a film attachment that works ok but has a tendancy
    of cropping 35mm and 6x7cm negatives and doesn't seem to recognize some slides
    at the end of a strip or dense negatives. It likes underexposed ones better. \r\n\r\nI've
    compared 35mm prints to prints from a 4.1mega pixel <a href=\"http://www.dpreview.com/reviews/nikond2h/\"
    target=_blank>Nikon D2-H</A> and the prints from the digital are BETTER than the
    35mm ones. \r\n\r\nI've scanned some 6x7cm negatives and that works well. \r\n\r\nI've
    also shot some 6x7cm negatives from a <a href=\"http://www.mamiya.com/cameras.asp?id=1&id2=1&id3=8\"
    target=_blank>Mamiya RZ67 pro II</A> and scanned them to various resolutions with
    success.\r\n\r\nRight now most professional photographers are shooting 50-100%
    digitally. Some are still shooting film since thier magazine requires it. But,
    even fashion photographers are using Leaf or other digital backs on medium format
    cameras. These are in the \xA317,000 (17megapx)-20,000 (22megapx) range.\r\n\r\nThe
    new Canon and Nikon pro cameras are in the 12.5 - 15 mega pixel range. But 4-5
    mega pixel is good enough for most magazines. \r\n\r\nI've recently submitted
    a portrait photo for <a href=\"http://www.sueridermanagement.co.uk/presenters/Hannah/hannah.htm\"
    target=_blank>Hannah Sandling</A>  to a magazine and they requested the image
    be under 2 mega bytes!!!  \r\n\r\nI shoot in RAW format (NEF) and so don't most
    fashion pros. They usually have a photographer and a techy editor that cleans
    the images. \r\n\r\nRAW formats let you adjust the exposure, white balance and
    lots more than you can do with compressed jpgs. \r\n"

    papers will last 100 years. \r\n\r\nNo one has ever said a colour print will ever
    last. Only B&W prints were archivally processed (converting the silver to something
    more stable). Colour will always fade. \r\n\r\nSo the current technology with
    <a href=\"http://www.naturalworldphotos.com/giclee.htm\">gicl\xE9e prints</a>
    and pigment based prints without the use of photo chemicals that could contaminate
    the paper these prints will be more stable than silver, dye or chemical based
    prints. \r\n\r\nI also am finding that 400 ASA or higher black and white negatives
    (Ilford or Kodak films) scan a bit grainier than they would print directly from
    a negative to print. <a href=\"http://www.virtualtraveller.org/epson2450.htm\">

  body: "> a 35 mm frame is the equivalent of 15 megapixels\r\n\r\nHow did you figure
    that? To me it seems that ~5Mpix is almost always good enough. The other day I
    made an 8x10 print from a 3.3Mpix image, and the aliasing was quite mild.\r\n\r\nBTW,
    what Ricoh do you have - the RDC-7? That's what I have (got it used for $160),
    and I LOVE it. The macro feature is staggering - translating to over 2000dpi.
    BTW, during the conference in Beirut I met somebody else with an RDC-7, and we
    almost started a fan club right there.\r\n\r\n> it\u2019s still OK to use film.\r\n\r\nWell,
    I have a lot of emotional attachment to my Canon SLR (have had it since '92),
    but to me the big advantage of digital is convenience: taking too many pictures,
    cleaning up as needed, and not having to stare through a hole*. My only real complaint
    about (affordable) digital cameras is the latency from pressing the button to
    actually taking the photo; sometimes though I hit the button slightly before I
    need to, and quickly frame the image afterwards.\r\n\r\n* Recently in Paris I
    took some \"spy video\" (low-grade though) of a metro car making a stop, and it's
    so authentic it's scary - there was even an accordion player, nervously checking
    for les gendarmes...\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    cameras don't have the delay. My Nikon D2H shoots at 8 frames per second. It was
    made for News and Sports photography and came with a wireless transmitter that
    can connect to a wireless network.\r\n\r\nSo the Canon and Nikon high end ones
    act just like film cameras and you get the same shutter like feedback. My older
    Nikon FM-2 with a Nikon motordrive (MD-12) was surprising loud when I used it
    to shoot a Typocircle third tuesday event at a pub. But the mechanical sound of
    the drive is cool and retro like and old film. \r\n\r\nMy Canon G3 has the delay
    but the Nikon D70 is under \xA31000 and might not have a delay and can handle
    real lenses."

  body: "> a 35 mm frame is the equivalent of 15 megapixels\r\n\r\nI read it in a
    magazine, but it seems about right.\r\nThere is some subjectivity involved, but
    in my experience, if you scan a 35mm trannie high-res, when you get up to 50mb,
    you start to get film grain, rather than picture detail. \r\nA 3.1 megapixel image
    (2048x1536) is a 9mb file (RGB), so if you multiply by five, you get a 15 megapixel
    file, with a 45mb file size.\r\n\r\nYes, my camera is an RDC-7, which I bought
    new when it came out for around $1k.\r\nYeah, the macro feature is very neat.
    Check out the close-up of letterpress at shinntype.com>essays>punch cuts>fig.2\r\n\r\nI
    think I bought it because i liked the way the screen swivels so you can see your
    self-portraits -- i have a lot of pictures I've taken of \"me with so-and-so\",
    although even with arm at full extension, my nose always seems too big (the lens
    is a bit \"fishy\").\r\n\r\nTo return to the thread topic, I don't understand
    what Frank means by \"obfuscating image formats\", or what \"RAW\" is."

  body: "<cite>So what is the problem with archiving .jpgs or even RAW? They both
    are well supported.</cite>\r\n\r\nIt only seems like that, that's the big issue
    here. Nikon has different RAW formats for each of their cams. The newer (except
    for the D-70 for some reason) all have the white balance information encrypted,
    so if you are not Nikon, you have a problem. An Nikon has no clue how to make
    user-friendly software, or software at all, since their \"photo suite\" is a pain
    in the keister to use. Nikon has long forgotten about their users and might even
    suffer the Leica fate in the future who made similar mistakes, both didn't listen
    to users.\r\n\r\nWith obfuscating a file format I mean exactly that. It's not
    like film where the basic information can be restored to a certain level by scanning
    and additional processing steps. but with file \"negatives\" since that's what
    RAW files could be compared with(given that they have way more information than
    a chemical negative ever had) the whole issue is different.\r\n\r\nWe can use
    images that are 50 years old. In 50 years the images from companies like Nikon
    will be useless. Nobody will be able to open them since in a worst case scenario
    the company doesn't anymore exist since 20 years and no one is left that knows
    how to work that secret format.\r\n\r\nAdobe's foray with the Digital Negative
    is quite limited as a format itself (I don't use it btw) and photographers don't
    trust it (except the endorsers). I don't know the whole spec but it seems to be
    limited to carry 16bit per channel images as a max."

    all, since their \u201Cphoto suite\u201D is a pain in the keister to use. \r\n\r\nI
    actually prefer the Nikon View (6.1) and Editor to I-Photo... I bought a Mac G4
    12'' powerbook because they claimed to handle RAW files.. but It didn't. I had
    to upgrade to the toy they call I-Photo 5. \r\n\r\nI use Nikon View on Windows
    and it's fine. It shows all the shooting data and meta data. On the Mac it doesn't
    work well importing since some ranges may go missing ie. I was importing 500 jpgs
    once and about 10 shots were missing. \r\n\r\nThe D2-H is not protecting the white
    balance information so the 'as shot' value is readable. The D2-X is suppose to
    be placing the white balance in an encrypted part of the file format and Nikon
    and Adobe are at odds with this change. But it still doesn't make the RAW file
    format unusable. You just have to use Adobe's white balance setting, set it to
    what you want and then go. The whole reason with shooting RAW is to be able to
    tweak any image just in case you messed up. \r\n\r\nI set my camera's white balance
    to flash when shooting studio flash stuff and haven't really found it necessary
    to change the white balance in the final images. I suppose if I forget to reset
    it when shooting in natural light I might need to change it. \r\n\r\nWonder how
    much film for my old original polaroid Land Camera is available or cost? I also
    own the <a href=\"http://www.central-camera.com/polaroid/for_creative_users.htm\"
    target=_blank> Polaroid 35mm 1981</A> or something. So everything gets old eventually.\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    too long to add basic 32-bit editing to it. What do you think would happen to
    your images when looking from that angle? I'll rather wait.\r\n\r\nSince my cam's
    format (x3f) is not too widely supported and Photoshop's RAW plug-in misinterprets
    a lot of the colors and has no support for the Fill-Light option (see proprietary
    formats) I had to set up my own workflow which uses ILM's Open EXR format so I'll
    be good for long after the ill fated but great Foveon format (no thanks to Sigma
    for that!).\r\n\r\nOpen EXR is supported by CoreImage on Tiger and in QuickTime.
    Since Apple hasn't dropped a single codec yet that they added to QuickTime over
    the years I'm not too worried about my images that are converted already."
