body: This is a project I am working on for a Chrsitan ministry . . . WOW is an acronym
  for Words Of Wisdom--a weekly editorial that is biblically based and designed to
  be encouraging and motivational.  <BR> <BR>The top logo is the original logo, the
  bottom two are revised editions I have created. I was originally asked to stay within
  the same concept of the original logo -- the client is now wondering if the concept
  is outdated and is open to new ideas . . .  <BR> <BR>Any input would be greatly
  appreciated! Thanks! <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/39447.gif"

  body: 'I think the concept of Resurrection is evident, and the sunrise is very effective.  <BR>
    <BR>I would go with 2. the saturation of 3&#39;s orange is making the w&#39;s
    and jesus very heavy.  <BR> <BR>Also it seems Jesus is pulling himself out of
    a deep hole. I don&#39;t think I like this, since it shows incompletion, as if
    he still struggles to get out. '
