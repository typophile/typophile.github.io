    be OK for some preliminary layout, and then you could tinker with the code with
    a text editor.\r\n\r\nThat being said, I'd either buy a dedicated package (like
    Dreamweaver) or explore the templates of Blogger: even as a pretty hardcore and
    competent IDer, I've done both of these, and they are ***way*** better at doing
    web than ID."

    it easy to dump your graphics right to usable files later.

    web sites, you really need to understand the medium of HTML and CSS and the like
    to do it right. "

  body: "> Although i don\u2019t know if we can work with pdf in html? anybody?\r\n\r\nPDF
    is great for what it does ... provide a consistent print/web look. It is not the
    tool for making an entire website, however. For one thing, you will never get
    a good listing with the search engine, since they only index HTML pages, not PDFs.\r\n\r\nThe
    top web program is Adobe Dreamweaver, although there are other programs worth
    considering (Microsoft Front Page is NOT one of them).\r\n\r\nYou can build web
    page with a simple text editor like TrueText or Notepad, but it requires learning
    how to write the code.\r\n"

  body: "Good point about outputting to gif and jpegs.  I wasn't talking about building
    a site with inDesign. Just designing. But there isn't Save For Web in ID.\r\n\r\nWould
    be sweet if illustrator or ps could allow for \"Master\" layouts and multi-page
    documents. If I design a grid for a site, and then could base all the other pages
    off that within one document that would be swell.  \r\n\r\nHence why I asked if
    anyone does this with ID.\r\n\r\nCarry on.\r\n"

  body: "ID does output to XML, I think, and that is HTML on steroids. It sounds like
    you might want to get into data-driven websites, where you design a basic page,
    and it feeds the necessary copy to it, depending on the situation. This site is
    an example, along with Amazon, etc.\r\n\r\nThe tool for doing that kind of thing
    is the php language, ASP, ColdFusion, and maybe more. You can access some of these
    tools in Dreamweaver."

    <a href=\"http://www.google.com/search?q=.pdf\">proven by Google</a>. You would
    have to link to the PDF though, from an HTML web page which contains enough relevant
    information. <em>That</em> will ensure it shows up on the search engines."
