  here goes i'm a fan of stencil making and i've used \"stencil\" fonts and they cant
  beat the real thing. The real thing? Ahh! A good ol' Ideal Stencil Machine or a
  Marsh even!\r\n\r\nI'm looking for a Ideal Stencil Machine No2. If you ever passed
  by one in a shop and had a flash: \"wow i wish i knew a guy who would post on typophile
  and say he'd like that machine!\".\r\nWell you now you know that guy, or at the
  very least you know a poster's name on a forum but close enough ;)\r\n\r\nSo yea
  lemme know if you come across one of those babies :)\r\n\r\nCheers!\r\n\r\nUgo"

    keep you in mind. I recently came across a vendor at one who had a bunch of old
    brass stencils for marking bags of wheat, barley, oats and the like. \r\n\r\n-=\xAE=-"

    in so i can go check the flea markets myself.\r\n\r\nI'm presently waiting for
    this old-but-not-so-old Ideal stencil machine that makes 5/8\" tall letters. Should
    get here bu the end on the month :)\r\n\r\nAre you a stencil afficionado yourself?
    I mean those brass stencil had to be great... if not usable they ought to be cleaned
    and framed!\r\n\r\nU"

  body: "no, I wouldn't say I'm a \"stencil aficionado\". I do like things like that
    though. Old industrial detritus...  It's such a simple, direct and obvious technology.
    If you are ever in Lunenburg Nova Scotia, the fisheries museum has a great display
    of stencils and stencil making equipment that used to be used in the canning plants
    to label boxes. They made some pretty elaborate ones.\r\n \r\nOccasionally the
    sign shop I work in makes large stencils for pavement markings, but we use a CNC
    router.\r\n\r\n-=\xAE=-"

    I've had for a while now. The cutting area, eighteen by twelve inches, is already
    too small for what I want to do in the near future and I've been drooling all
    over the gravograph IS8000xp which cuts up to twenty four by forty eight inches.\r\nBut
    for now, I like cutting stencils from mylar for use on canvases etc...\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/stencil_typophile_3572.jpg]\r\n\r\nIf
    I ever see an old skool stencil machine up around the Ottawa valley I'll let you
    know :) "

    I work for a company in The Netherlands and we have 2 stencil makers for sale.
    A diagraph bradley Jumbo model 1 3/4 and a Marsh Stencil maker (I don`t know which
    size of letter but I do believe it is 1 inch.)\r\n\r\nIs this something you are
    interested in?"
