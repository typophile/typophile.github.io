body: "Hi.  I'm working on this new font - it's a kind of hybrid between a baseball
  script and a formal roundhand kind of script, or at least that's how it started.
  \ It's taken on a life of its own since then.  Anyway, I've just got round to drawing
  the Icelandic characters eth and thorn.  What I want to know is:  Is it ok for the
  crossbar of eth to be extended from th top of the stem in a loop?  Had a quick look
  at other script fonts on MyFonts and found none that treated the eth this way.  If
  there are any Icelandic Typophiles out there, it'd be good to get your opinion.
  \ As for the thorn, I'm thinking it looks way to much like a \xDF because of the
  loop (which comes from making it out of a b and p).  Accents are missing from the
  text string below because I've not made them yet.\r\nCheers for looking and thanks
  in advance for any help\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/icelandic_4383.JPG]"

    couple of Slavic languages used that, both are now preferably set with apostrophe
    instead)\" made me laugh, sorry.\r\n\r\nYou can't replace the glyph tcaron by
    t + apostrophe, this is like replacing W by VV. \r\n\r\nThe letter \u0165 represents
    a distinctive sound and can be found in Czech and Slovak languages only. Although
    the diacritical marks is called h\xE1\u010Dek (caron) it has a special vertical
    form, sometimes similar to a comma or an apostrophe. \r\n\r\nYou can find a plain
    apostrophe placed next to the letter only in poorly designed fonts. Unfortunately
    such an arrogant approach is quite widespread. The result of this is simple: the
    fonts can't be used for typesetting Czech or Slovak and professional designers
    avoid such typefaces.\r\n\r\nIf you'd like to see a good samples of tcaron, please
    visit Storm Type, TypeTogether or Suitcase Type Foundries to name a few.\r\n\r\nPlease
    read very careful explanation how to design this kind of caron which is btw. used
    also together with d (\u010F) and l/L (\u013E/\u013D; not to be confused with
    \u013A/\u0139).\r\n\r\nhttp://diacritics.typo.cz/index.php?id=5\r\n\r\nPost Scriptum:
    The letter t followed by an apostrophe is also used in Czech language, but the
    meaning is different: the apostrophe represents missing letter, but you can only
    find it in poems or in an attempt to write slang pronunciation. This is another
    reason you can't replace \u0165 by t'."

  body: "Thanks Janek.\r\nSo the lslash should not have a loop.  Is the slash part
    of it ok?  I can switch the sacute to that one without a lead-in easily enough.
    \ Is it worth doing this with scaron and scircumflex too?  What's your take on
    my endform ogoneks - smooth or looped?\r\nAnother thing - you said the script
    r was not recognisable to you - should I put the alternate r as default for Polish?
    \ Anyone know of any other languages where script r should be avoided, or would
    it be best to leave it up to the individual user and leave it as a stylistic set?\r\nDutch
    - should IJ and ij ligatures be default for Dutch or not?"

  body: ">>Is the slash part of it ok?<< Could be more like \"tilde\". A bit too heavy
    on the right side? I think you are on the right path now, \"Jagie\u0142\u0142o\"
    looks quite good.\r\n>>What's your take on my endform ogoneks - smooth or looped?<<
    picture please...\r\n>>would it be best to leave it (r.alt) up to the individual
    user and leave it as a stylistic set?<< I think the latter is better solution
    - after all it is user who decide which form to chose.\r\nRegarding Polish acutes
    - I think they are a bit too bent and as a consequence point somewhere far left,
    not point at own letters. See Adam comment on Palatino and Georgia here: http://www.twardoch.com/download/polishhowto/kreska.html
    . And here I vote for LOCL feature. BTW the more vertical \"Polish kreska\" helps
    when is followed by letters with ascender, like \"\u0107b\" in \"cho\u0107by\u015B\"."

    of kerning needed for a connecting script font, not between connecting letters
    but between punctuation and non-connecting alternates. Hopint to get it released
    within the next week or two..."

    close to [[http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/singles/flatit_type_foundry/ht_gelateria_ot/|Gelateria]],
    which is an existing font in the same general design area. I'd hate for people
    to perceive the name as an attempt to ride that font's coattails, especially as
    your design clearly stands on its own in quality and versatility."

  body: "Thanks Craig.\r\nThe name cam about when I had to design a logo for an Italian
    Coffee Shop with Gelato in the name.  I used this font and thought it looked good,
    so I chose it as the name.  There's another font called Gelato but hopefully this
    is different enough for that not to be a problem.  Worst case scenario I have
    to change the name, but that gives you a longer run at Hot New Fonts a-la Sketchetica/Sketchetik.
    \ Still got to sell some first though!\r\n\r\nThanks everyone for the help throughout
    the critique stage, it was invaluable."

  body: "@daverowland\r\n\r\nThis is probably a bit off-topic, but I was curious what
    your initial steps are in creating a script font like this. Do you start with
    actual brush/pen and ink or is done entirely in pencil tracings first?"

  body: "Hi\r\nNo, I never use a brush or pen to draw letters first. I'll usually
    do a few doodles to get a general feel but it's generally straight into the computer
    - I don't scan anything in and trace it, just copy the doodles roughly then mess
    about with the points."

    to keep the letters fluid or do you use at least use an electronic stylus to help
    speed the process?\r\n"
