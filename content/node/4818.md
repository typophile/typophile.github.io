  body: Initally I thought that too - but the leggy bit of the &#34;a&#34; and the
    jaws of the &#34;c&#34; are different to Franklin Gothic... <BR> <BR>&#42;really
    must find out what those bits are called!&#42; <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR>James <BR>

  body: There was a sans serif from around 1960 called Mercator that was similar to
    this, particularly the lowercase &#34;a&#34;. I think this was probably drawn
    for the masthead based on no particular typeface, but influenced by some. &#40;Most
    magazine logos back then were hand drawn anyway.&#41;

    was it... <BR> <BR>Pointy Apex&#39;s - I like them :D <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR>James

  body: The headline under the logo matches Folio Medium Extended except for the R,
    but that could well be an alternate character. I think Folio had two different
    Rs, because some samples show a Helvetica-style R and other samples show a Franklin-style
    R. Unfortunately, I can&#39;t find any digital versions of this particular weight.

    are some other weights of Folio</a>.

  body: After a getting a bit further through Jaspert&#39;s <i>Encyclopedia of Type
    Faces,</i> I would say that the logo is mainly modeled on Grotesque. Monotype
    Grotesque No. 1 Bold is closest to the logo, but not available digitally. <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/grotesque-mt/bold-extended/testdrive.html?s=Autocar&amp;p=48"
    target="_blank">Grotesque MT Bold Extended</a> is similar, but extended and not
    as bold.
