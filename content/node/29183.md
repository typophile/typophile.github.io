    Neue Black</a>. The S is not an exact match. It does not resemble Gill Sans.\r\n\r\n\"PHILIPS\"
    I would guess is custom lettering. It also does not resemble Gill Sans.\r\n\r\nHowever!
    \"Sense...\" really is <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=catalog.fontdetail&displayfontid=M.52.0.5&attributes.sampleSize=48&sampleText=sense+and+simplicity&sampleSize=32\">Gill

    body: Thank you for your responses.  I am trying to find corporate logos that
      does have the typeface Gill Sans used in it.  I think that Penguin Books and
      also BBC also uses their corporate typeface as Gill Sans, like Saab - but do
      they use Gill Sans in the following images?  Thanks again.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/penguin

    body: "I'm doing a research paper on Eric Gill and Gill Sans, and then designing
      a poster around the information.  I'm asked to find samples of Gill Sans still
      used today, but apparently I'm not doing so swell on the logos.  I'm just starting
      out with my design classes, so I'm not fully aware of each typeface.  Apparently,
      to me, they look similar to Gill Sans but I guess they are not.  Much help appreciated.\r\n\r\nIs
      this logo Gill Sans?[img:sites/default/files/old-images/united colors_5972.jpg]"

  body: The old Penguin jacket (circa 1950?) uses Gill Sans apart from, as previously
    mentioned, in the Penguin Books logo. Gill was part of the original Penguin house
    style for their first few decades. They still keep a similar look for some of
    the type on the jackets of the Penguin Classics series but are using Futura rather
    than Gill nowadays.
