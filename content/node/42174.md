    flickr link I realized that your flickr icon has the same color palette as your
    Typophile icon... but the two pictures look like complete opposites! Almost like
    a Jeckyll and Hyde split, or a funhouse mirrorview...  ;-)\r\n\r\nDan, I used
    to have a monkeylike candle that a friend gave me as a going-away present... Don't
    know where it is these days, but I had it in my bedroom for ages."
