  and I really want to buy Pelso for $19. What should I do?

  body: Ah, yes, gas. Indeed a fine point, which I will definitely take into consideration,
    as I lose myself in the Pelso waterfall.

    and get eight billion dollars by promising to lend people money to buy shitty
    cars.

  body: "I brought this question up elsewhere and...\r\n\r\n\"You'd spend the last
    of your money on a single-weight caps-only font? Not the most versatile use of
    your money.\"\r\n\r\nI knew this point would come up, which is a fair and completely
    logical one. But, yes, I would, when the single-weight/caps-only font looks like
    Pelso. Now, if it were a cent over $20...\r\n\r\nFontlove is obviously subjective,
    so this isn't so much about the worth of a particular font, but rather, degrees
    of sacrifice when it comes to one's passions.\r\n\r\nAlso, regarding my survival,
    did I mention, I could stand to lose a few pounds, so food comes second to exercising
    my typography muscle."

    earn you the money back tout suite?

    off on playing with type, and, because I'm broke (and extremely shy), I do this
    while the world goes on without me, so my immediate use would basically be for
    the sheer joy of my two eyeballs, as well as the keeping of my sanity.\r\n\r\n@

    how it feels to be severely addicted to type, especially if you don't have the
    money (there are a lot of books I would like to have, and it's killing me, as
    some might run out of copies soon...)\r\nCongratulations! May you find a job (or
    just a project) to help keep you up. Happy New Year!"
