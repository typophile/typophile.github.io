body: "I designed a logotype for a client based on DTL Prokyon small caps. We offered
  several logotypes, but the Prokyon is what they want (coincidentally, the decision-makers
  are Dutch). To make things nice and neat, I have been exploring the possibility
  of using the Prokyon Pro family for the client's identity, since underneath the
  company name is one those descriptor lines that we all love so much. They would
  probably end up using the chosen type for all sorts of design-free internal projects,
  like presentations, and we would be using it for all collateral, signage, and so
  on.\r\n\r\nAdmirers of DTL all share the inevitable heartbreak of facing the prices
  on DTL fonts: \u20AC100 per font, per weight, per style for PS1, \u20AC250 per font,
  per weight, per style for OTF. Hence, these typefaces are encountered about as often
  as one encounters a Bugatti 57SC Atlantic. What's more, DTL fonts are sold as individual
  licenses, not the usual 5 CPU license, with the price decreasing by about half for
  each additional license.\r\n\r\nAssuming the client balks at the exorbitant fee,
  which is likely and not wholly unreasonable, I will need a substitute font to match
  the logotype. The distinct features of the letters of Prokyon which I am using are
  the katana-like leg of the R, the gentle outward swelling of the counters, and a
  generally glyphic character. Being in small caps lends a slightly gawky-eyed, extended
  feel to it. Two substitutes I think may be close are Monotype Gill Sans Pro (the
  R is too weak) and FF Nexus, which is close but doesn't have the range of weights
  I would like.\r\n\r\nCan anyone suggest some possible substitutes?\r\nThe font comes
  from here:\r\nhttp://www.dutchtypelibrary.nl/Adres.html\r\nAnd it looks like this:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/DTL_Prokyon.gif]"

    always been a bit wary of Jeremy Tankard's type, not sure why.  \r\n\r\nIt seems
    difficult to find the right match without treading too near Gotham territory.
    Scala was one of the first ones that came to mind, since it's just a short leap
    from Gill, but it was just used on an excruciating project so I'm taking a break
    from it. The R is very no-nonsense and a bit narrow. \r\n\r\nTschichold and Nexus
    seem the closest. But neither really has the subtlety of the DTL fonts. Or maybe
    we're conditioned to think that because they cost so much. "

    body: "I think claes' theory can go either way. I prefer to plan out the type
      system as a serif and a sans, preferably of the same basic design or designer.
      At least the same x-height. Ideally there would also be a couple of display
      faces thrown in for larger projects, like magazines. The alterations I made
      to the original Prokyon are not easily reproduced by simply typing out the letters.
      But for the most part, I agree that there should be a level of contrast. In
      fact, I would prefer to use something that is visually concussive.  \r\n\r\nIn
      this case I am sticking to a one family system. It's for a company that designs,
      builds and sells modular buildings. Since there are other companies that have
      the same name that do other things, as is often the case, they have a descriptor
      line under the company name to specify which \"Company X\" they are. The logo
      was designed as a three-color, type/bug pair, and with the descriptor below
      the type it starts to get pretty busy. So I am opting for a single type family
      because anything else would be visual suicide.\r\n\r\nAnother option is to use
      a typeface that is nearly invisible, like Akzidenz-Grotesk. But it is a different
      kind of sans, and it just seems plain silly to mix a humanist with a grotesque."

    up. The font files are even listed as .otf files. The problem manifests itself
    that when you try to use it in an application \u2014 in my case, Illustrator CS
    on OSX \u2014 it behaves like a Postscript font. When you switch to small caps,
    it makes the fake small caps out of the full caps. Selecting any alternate figures
    produces no result. All OpenType options in the OT palette, including all standard
    ligatures, are greyed-out and disabled. The only way to access any character that
    deviates from the standard 256 PS/TTF character slots is to insert it manually
    from the glyphs palette. Furthermore, switching to a different Pro font, including
    other weights of the same family, causes some characters to change into different
    characters. For example, the 'st' ligature changes into an 's' with a caron, and
    an alternate ampersand turns into a percentage sign or lozenge. Thus the Unicode
    glyph maps are inconsistent. The multiple language support (it has full-on cyrillic
    built in) may have something to do with it.  \r\n\r\nStorm says it works fine
    on a Windows XP box, but that does me little good. I think he was in a rush to
    release it in OpenType, and did not test it properly. Fortunately, all his fonts
    carry a lifetime guarantee. "
