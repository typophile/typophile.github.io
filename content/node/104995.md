  body: "Yes Crayonete, a popular font 120 years ago, cool again in the 1960s & 1970s.
    A simplified version of Crayon, designed and patented by Herman Ihlenberg in 1886,
    D16508.\r\nI know of two digital Crayonete fonts. One sold by Aridi as Aridi08,
    \ Aridi Computer Graphics/Hardcover Communications 2001. The second created by
    Claude Pelletier as <a href=\"http://www.fontspace.com/diogene/crayonnette\">Crayonnete</a>.
    Note the double n.\r\nDon\r\n"
