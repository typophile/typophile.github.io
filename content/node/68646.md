  project on behalf of a client. They would like to purchase a license and use the
  same exact font in designing materials in-house. Does anyone know how to track done
  such info on a font you've been using forever and have no idea where you purchased
  it?\r\n\r\nThanks!"

    you can right-click the font and get the copyright information under the "Details"
    tab." That should set you in the right direction...
