<p>Ah, yeah, thats right. A serif face would obviously need more.</p>
<p>Also, nice illustrations in Hudson&rsquo;s post in that thread. Sometimes the spine can use additional nodes, but in my (limited, but still) experience so far, I usually don&rsquo;t seem to need them all that often.</p>

<p>Except in cases where you output a TT font from cubic bezier (PostScript) data, in which case the absence of explicit nodes where the points of inflection are can cause major warping of the outlines. At least in the case of ol' Fontographer.</p>

<p>Yes, I know. Couldnt help myself. But there is some truth behind it. 12 nodes for the S-curve. Then if the curve has serifs or not thats another story. But I think that if you want it really smooth, then 12 nodes is the best. But sometimes the S have a straighter area aomewhere along the &ldquo;big curve&rdquo; and then of course it needs more nodes.
It is however very good practice to draw an S with only 12 nodes, I believe.</p>

<p>i think this is usually safest, as you must be an expert curve handler to add more without making the spine look &lsquo;kinky&rsquo;. but i believe that in certain circumstances, the spine might benefit from additional control which necessitates more points.</p>

<p>I would probaby do this also in the end either as a safety precation or just to put some stability in the curve (to lock this area), but it has nothing to do with getting a smooth S as the original question was.</p>

<p>in my opinion there must be some regular geometry — maybe a polygonal grid — behind a well shaped “S” letter simply because it’s well shaped.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In my opinion that&rsquo;s a fundamental mistake. People have been looking for simple&ndash;and not so simple&ndash;geometry for centuries and haven&rsquo;t found it. Almost everything in letters violates simple, regular geometry, because that&rsquo;s not the way the eye-brain combo works. And the S has one of the most complex shapes.</p>
<p>In the case of the S and s, a basic principle is that the bottom part needs to be bigger than the top part. This follows two principles, both of which violate simple geometry. The first is that when you split something vertically, the divide, to look equal, generally has to be higher than equally bisecting the space vertically. The second principle is that the top part needs to be narrower than the bottom, to look more secure and stable. Hence the top arm of the E is often shorter, and the top of the K, S and X smaller and narrower than the bottom. Similar stuff happens in the lower case. You can see the same principles at work in the design of furniture, buildings, etc.</p>

<p>Bill, there is a tendency for some designers to overdo these two required differences, rather than to get the top and bottom to look right. The same thing can be said of many overshoots which end up looking too big and ink traps which can distort the look of a character. It&rsquo;s as if some designers want you to know that they have attended to such issues, but end up only making more trouble. There is one logo which I always think has O&rsquo;s (or S&rsquo;s) that are far too tall when I see it on trucks in UK but I can&rsquo;t remember for the life of me which it is. Think it might be <a href="http://www.tesco.com">Tesco</a>?</p>

		<div class="commentbody">Hrant, I get that William is right, but some designs have overcompensated on overshoot for sure. Maybe required overshoot is a subjective issue!? You&rsquo;re not telling me though that fonts should have smaller relative overshoots the larger they get, other than remaining in proportion to the font size, are you? Surely that&rsquo;s just maths. If it&rsquo;s not then I have to pack up and go home. No designer is expected to design fonts at different sizes. Maybe you are telling me that. I know some designers have offered different fonts depending on the weight you&rsquo;re going to use (as well as different &lsquo;grades&rsquo;) but I never thought that overshoot would have been different between them&hellip;</div>

<p>Smaller <em>absolute</em> overshoots (meaning in the font design). Which makes sense. Plus it&rsquo;s mentioned in a footnote in Harry Carter&rsquo;s edition of Fournier.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>No designer is expected to design fonts at different sizes</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Why not, since scale affects the net results? Before digital type (actually before phototype&hellip; actually before the pantograph) a given font design was for one size only, and was -generally- designed to be optimal at that size. Now the convenience of using a font at any size has overpowered the sense not to. Sure, a give font can serve within a range of sizes not just a single size, so scaling is useful, but in practice this range is quite narrow. Fortunately during the past decade many type designers have started seeing the light: they point out the scalar limits of their designs (like indicating whether it&rsquo;s a text font or a display font) and some of them even make different cuts within the text range.</p>

<p>Do you think that&rsquo;s why the overshoots on the TESCO logo look too big on a lorry but fine on a tin of catfood? If so, I disagree, I think the overshoots on the Tesco logo always look too big, to me at least. Check it out&hellip;</p>

<p>I guess. Although it might be worth noting that the relationship is not linear, it&rsquo;s probably something like quadratic.</p>
<p>As for the Tesco logo, I think smaller sizes would help, but it could still be designed too poorly!</p>

<p>Gerrard Under showed us an &ldquo;a&rdquo; he designed and where he put extra points &amp; why. I have little doubt that some &ldquo;s&rdquo; shapes might benefit from similar finesse. judging by the subtle enhancement they provide it is also almost certainly true that he got as close as possible without the extra points before adding them.</p>
