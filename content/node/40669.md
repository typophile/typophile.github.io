  I am posting it again here and hopefully I will get some answer.\r\n\r\n\"I have
  a problem with a monospaced font. I have manually hinted the font using the Bitmap
  Tool in the TrueType Tools. The problem is thatin some applications (like Flash
  - see the corresponding picture) the hinted version of the font (from 9px to 16px)
  is monospaced (which is correct) while in other applications (like Photoshop CS
  - see the corresponding picture - or even Notepad) the hinted version of the font
  is NOT monospaced! I can't understand why this happens. All glyphs have a width
  of exactly 600px and the font works great while aliased.\"\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/BPmonoBold

  body: It looks like you may have hinted the advance widths of the characters accidentally
    at 14 ppm. Flash doesn't show this because it's not going to allow hinted advance
    widths (at least not the most current versions.)

  body: "Hello,\r\n\r\nI think the source of the problem are the bitmaps not the hints.
    The Bitmap Tool does not create any hints (or better instructions).\r\nTry to
    generate the font without the option \"Export embedded bitmaps\". You find it
    in <em>Options - Generating OpenType & TrueType - OpenType/TrueType (.ttf)</em>\r\n\r\nRegards\r\nEigi"

  body: "Adam, yes this option was constantly checked.\r\n\r\nWell, I followed eigi's
    advice but it didn't work. Then, I thought that I only have bitmaps and not hints
    or instructions, so I did the opposite. That is, I left the \"Export embedded
    bitmaps\" option checked, but I unchecked the \"Export hinted TrueType fonts\"
    option (together with all its sub-options). And it worked ... (see the new picture)!
    I am not sure whether this is acceptable, but as I understand it, in this way
    all hinting information in the font (if there are any) are replaced by the bitmaps.
    \r\n\r\nShall I leave it this way, or do you think that it could cause problems?\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/BPmonoBold_6336.png]\r\n\r\nGeorge
