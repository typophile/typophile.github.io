body: "I'm looking for this [[http://cl.ly/G0EX]] typeface. A better look perhaps:
  [[http://cl.ly/G07O]]\r\n\r\nIt has a distinctive Q too : [[http://cl.ly/Fzbo]]\r\n\r\nIt's
  somewhat like Landry Gothic and Vitro Extra Bold, but it has a distinctive R."

  body: "The R is the result of a rigidly enforced midline, which suggests one of
    two things. Either it\u2019s a faithful reproduction of a typeface produced during
    the latter half of the nineteenth century, or it\u2019s the work of a neophyte,
    and might be freeware."
