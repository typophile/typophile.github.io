    thinking about what you might be able to do with text on screen that you can't
    do in a book.\"\r\n\r\nThis is one of the major problems facing traditional publishers.
    There are many talented designers working on print material that do not understand
    how to engage with digital technologies beyond trying to transition traditional
    content to new formats and platforms. It is difficult but I think there is a lot
    to be gained from getting those designers to think about and work natively in
    digital publishing environments. Typographically so much more is possible now
    than even a couple of years ago and the technology is developing all the time.\r\n\r\n[[http://www.toccon.com/toc2012/public/schedule/detail/22271|The
    Future of Reading]] session at the recent Tools of Change conference was a good
    overview of what is possible but most publishers are only just getting to grips
    with these concepts, let alone the tools that make great digital typography possible.\r\n\r\nIt
    sounds like a fascinating job and it is great that Microsoft continue to see the
    importance of those elements as part of single focused role.\r\n\r\n"

    making reading on screen as good an experience as a book, but I think to make
    reading on screen a <em>better</em> experience you need to start thinking about

    you need to start thinking about what you might be able to do with text on screen
    that you can't do in a book</cite>\r\n\r\nI agree. At the same time MS's \"better\"
    differs from your \"better\": The job description, in light of past activity,
    is mostly about the medium side, dealing with screens and their possibilities
    and limitations as to what they can display. What you bring up now is the narrative
    or storytelling side, which is not something I saw MS being concerned about. (And
    they shouldn't or don't need to.)\r\n\r\nK.S. \u2013 <cite>was a good overview
    of what is possible ...</cite>\r\n\r\nThe aspect of adaptive/flexible (and typographically
    refined) layout as made possible by wpf or html5+css3 is an old hat to me. Still
    I have trouble to understand why it did not happen ten years earlier.\r\nTaking
    into account what John said and approaching it from the storytelling side, the
    adaptive-yet-typographic-layout technology is means rather than ends, it is but
    one core material condition <em>among others</em> to make new kinds of storytelling
    possible.\r\n\r\nK.S. \u2013 <cite>... but most publishers are only just getting
    to grips with these concepts, let alone the tools that make great digital typography
    possible</cite>\r\n\r\nIt needs new generations of publishers and designers.\r\nCurrent
    print designers have trouble enough getting the idea of adaptive layout, which
    in turn requires conceptual/structural thinking rather than the static collage
    type of thinking. Ironically enough, an <em>earlier</em> generation of book typographers,
    working with tools like Berthold typesetting programs, were familiar with structural
    thinking \u2013 but most likely are long retired. (Put differently: PageMaker,
    XPress, InDesign, following a fixed collage mode of thinking, caused typesetters/typographers
    to un-learn structural thinking.)\r\nAnd I think you over-emphasize the aspect
    of learning tools. Tools are easy to learn when you know what you want to do with
    them. The problem is that designers/publishers don't know what they want.\r\nMoreover,
    what's an ebook, since you pointed at the presentation? Isn't that part of the
    problem rather than being the solution? Mostly it is about packaging old content
    in a slightly modified way ..."

    of reading is one published typeface measured against another quite different
    typeface, or at best a face refined with ad hoc feedback from users. I\u2019ve
    designed commissioned faces where several variants have been presented to the
    client, and these have been tested in mock-ups with focus groups, but the feedback
    is <em>ad hoc</em> rather than scientific.\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Karsten, 'storytelling' -- new forms of literature -- strikes me as only
    one area in which reading on screen might differ from books, and not personally
    interesting to me. I spoke specifically about what one might be able to do differently
    with <em>text</em> on screen, and I meant in the visual sense of text not the
    literary. Sorry if that wasn't clearer. One obvious thing is the use of colour,
    which has tended to be absent from typographic printing -- due to cost, I think
    -- but which has a rich manuscript tradition, e.g. in Arabic and some Jewish vocalised
    texts and in Ethiopic in which bichromatic punctuation signs are normative in
    the manuscript tradition. The ART team has been exploring ways in which empirical
    testing might feed back into design -- which is why when they talk about 'better'
    they usually have an actual measure in mind --, and this strikes me as an area
    in which one might be able to determine whether something like traditional use
    of colour in text might actually aid aspects of reading such as comprehension.
    And if it does, then it raises the question how else might colour be used, and
    what would the result be?\r\n\r\nPrinting has tended to be conservative; more
    so than the manuscript tradition in many respects. In large part this seems to
    me to have been the result of the manufacturing costs of type for most of the
    past 550 years, and the the material costs of publishing. No one wants to take
    risks when so much is at stake. Publishers are rightly wary of publishing books
    using novel types, let alone introducing new punctuation symbols or varying conventional
    typographic norms. What if no one wants to buy it? But the same electronic document
    can be read on screen in any variety of style sheets, and the reader can even
    apply his or her own preferences. How might this be extended? Style sheets for
    the most part remain static: they present a single way of viewing and reading,
    selected by the publisher or, less often, by the reader. Are more dynamic methods
    possible? Part of the job of a typographer is to select a typeface and layout
    appropriate to the subject matter and literary style of a document, taking into
    account both convention and possibilities for innovation. We all have an idea
    of what a novel looks like versus an annual report, and of what range of typeface
    options might apply to each. My guess is that a computer can very easily be taught
    to recognise what kind of document a reader is looking at, so could apply appropriate
    styles automatically. Or a reader could say 'This is what I want novels to look
    like when I read them' and 'This is how I want to read a newspaper' etc., and
    the computer would determine the document type and apply the desired style.\r\n\r\nYou
    mentioned adaptive layout, and the trouble that designers have had 'getting the
    idea'. I agree, and I'm thinking its because adaptive layout probably isn't a
    design 'problem' in any traditional sense -- the sense of determining how a thing
    should look --, but is really an algorithmic problem: how to best fit this content
    into this area, and that seems to me mostly automatable if one knows what kind
    of content it is and how readers prefer to engage with such content."

    production in a quite literal sense \u2013 then we are on the same page, including
    the entire second paragraph.\r\n\r\nAs to the first paragraph: Given that \"to
    make reading on screen a better experience than reading from a book\" (from the
    text in question) is so boldly put, I would not have thought of something as simple
    as color. It was just normal with manuscripts and early printed pieces, and it
    had its come-back with website design (for visualizing the structure of a text
    and for indicating functionality). In so far I would turn the last sentence upside
    down: Not asking the theoretical question how else color might be used, but going
    by the assumption that each document will provoke the practical question how to
    visualize it.\r\n\r\nI don't see why adaptive layout should not be a design problem.
    It, too, is about getting relations/proportions right, among other things. The
    algorithm is the implementation of the answer to the question how a thing should
    look. The only difference is that it is not about how an individual fixed thing
    should look but about how a thing that adapts to certain medium-determined conditions
    should look. The target is not a static but a moving one. And your \"if one knows
    what kind of content it is and how readers prefer to engage with such content\"
    is nothing else but \"design problem\"."

  body: "Karsten: <em>The only difference is that it is not about how an individual
    fixed thing should look but about how a thing that adapts to certain medium-determined
    conditions should look.</em>\r\n\r\nThis prompts two thoughts.\r\n\r\nThe first
    is that adaptive layout doesn't need to presume <em>certain</em> medium-determined
    conditions; it can also presume <em>un</em>certain conditions, and this is where
    I see a difference between adaptive design and adaptive process. Adaptive design
    tends to extend concepts from static design into an adaptive framework bounded
    by certain conditions. An adaptive process is one that is scalable to unknown
    conditions.\r\n\r\nThe second thought is that adaptability, in terms of display
    of electronic documents, may be a strong constraint within at least some important
    conditions. Now, good design thrives on constraints, or at least responds to them
    effectively, but strong constraints are determinative of form, and hence at once
    limit design options and offer themselves to automated solutions. This thought
    can be expressed in a question: 'How many viable options are there to lay out
    a particular document type adaptively on my phone?' My sense is that while there
    remain many design decisions to be made in the styling of documents, there are
    relatively few options in terms of effective layout at the smaller end of the
    media spectrum, i.e. where people are reading more and more. So that strikes me
    as something that is at once not a significant arena for design, but conversely
    a great area for automation."
