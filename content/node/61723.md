  body: That's all I have... I tried a different version of Frutiger and that worked
    better, though subtle details like the flatness of the tail on the "e" still didn't
    match.  I suppose scanning noise could be causing the difference....

  body: It could even be something that looks like Frutiger (and strictly speaking,
    <em>is</em> "Frutiger") but goes under a different name, like Bitstream's <a href="http://new.myfonts.com/search/humanist+777/fonts/">Humanist
    777</a>.
