  body: "The larger counter on p and the tear-shaped, open-eared r immediately caught
    my eyes because it looked like Verdigris. Bembo's p should have a more angular
    top-stroke and less counterspace, and its ear of the r should have a definite
    downward stroke. Beyond that it looked like Bembo.\r\n\r\nDo you have a larger
    version on the image?"

  body: "Ah!\r\n\r\nI failed take the 2005 Monotype Bembo Book into account! If the
    book is quite new, maybe it was set in that particular rendition. Its characteristics
    matched my description more closely, particularly with shorter stub on r. I'm
    still not quite sure on the p, although the image quality could've easily be distorted
    and my perception deceived through optimizing it for the web."

  body: "I didn't dream it: the sample is set in Pietro, a redesign of Bembo done
    in 1995 by Tobias Frere-Jones. It's shown on pp 46-7 of Font Bureau's type specimen
    book, 3rd edition. \r\nIt isn't on the FB website; since it's part of a special
    'readability' group of typefaces, you have to contact their office directly to
    buy it. \r\nI'd checked the website but not the book!"

    body: Yep, that's FB Pietro, a Bembo revival. I took part in the redesign of <em>Poetry</em>
      magazine (that's where the sample image is from) while at Winterhouse Studio,
      and we commissioned FB to make some revisions to Pietro, a project they'd had
      in their shop for a while. As far as I know, no one else is using Pietro, and
      it sounds like your research reflects this. <em>Poetry</em> magazine had used
      Bembo for a very long time, and we thought it appropriate to keep with the tradition
      but update it and make it better. We hope the redesign was effective!
