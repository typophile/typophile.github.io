  from the 1890s/early 1900s and haven't found anything I love yet. \r\n\r\nAny recommendations?
  \r\n\r\nThanks very much. \r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/moerlein_labels_5203.jpg]"

  body: "Nice variety of pix.\r\nRonaldson is one of the better designed body fonts
    from the late 19th century and would give an appropriate and distinctive character
    to your book. Get the Canada type digital version. Most body fonts from the era
    are not very pleasing to modern eyes. They display poorly because of uneven color
    distribution and seem washed out because of the light weight, or are hard to read
    because they are small point sizes of Didone and other Modern fonts  in which
    the hairline portions of the strokes are almost invisible. Century is an alternative
    to Ronaldson. It lacks the 19th century flavor, but was developed for Century
    Magazine in the 1890s and is the first text font designed with the precision and
    better readability that we find in 20th century text fonts.\r\nHope this is of
    some use to your project.\r\nDon"
