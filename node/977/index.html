Given some of its roots in Scotch forms, however,  <BR>I have wondered if it couldn't be reconfigured for  <BR>newspaper work. I have sketches somewhere that I  <BR>started a while back to adapt the proportions to news &ndash;  <BR>much taller x-height and shorter extenders, narrower  <BR>overall, etc.  <BR> <BR>But that is on a back burner and may never come to  <BR>any fruition. <BR> <BR>I'm personally a great admirer of both Charter and  <BR>Swift.

		<div class="commentbody">&gt; narrower overall <BR> <BR>Kent, I've come to the -admittedly counterintuitive, and somewhat tentative- conclusion that narrowness is an illusional virtue in a news face. When you take into account the frequent linebreaks in news setting (and possible a negative effect in apparent size), it turns out that it might in fact backfire*. So the choice of width in a news face has more to do with the atmosphere you want to convey than economy. I'm talking about body here, not headings, where horizontal economy is of obvious benefit. <BR> <BR>* Does this jive with what the FB experts have told you? <BR> <BR>Also, when you pull in the extenders you automatically create a perception of width. When I was deriving Patria from Harrier, I ended up with a much more squat and masculine design than I expected, or even originally wanted. I'm lucky I ended up liking it like that!  :-) <BR> <BR>In the case of Whitman, it depends on the atmosphere you want to convey. If you want it wide/homey (which to me fits well) rather than narrow/elegant, chances are just pulling in the extenders is enough. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR></div>

However, it could work with Gotham Condensed. But really, it's tough to know till you actually start playing around. There are so many typographic parameters that a designer can fiddle with these days in news design &ndash; a huge difference from the rigid restrictions of the pre-digital era. <BR> <BR>A few years ago, North American web presses went narrower, causing all kinds of design problems for news designers, who generally responded by going to narrower faces. So there is definitely a &quot;semi-condensed&quot; look to the genre &ndash; but of course we don't know where Zach is is heading in relation to the trend.</div>

It *has* been growing on me since I called it bland. <BR> <BR>&gt;but of course we don't know where Zach is is heading in relation to the trend.  <BR> <BR>Nor does Zach <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif" ALT=":-&#41;" BORDER=0> Nor does he know what a &quot;web press&quot; is&hellip; it seems like an oxymoron.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">&gt;Soft and populist, now we're getting somewhere.  <BR>&gt;Question: do you think something like the new  <BR>&gt;LA Times body face is too homey for you?  <BR> <BR>I must confess I haven't seen it&hellip; I haven't found a bookstore that carries more than the basic Boston/NY papers plus some international ones. And a few minutes searching the internet yielded no high-res images. <BR> <BR>Sorry, I had meant to answer you about the demographic and viewpoint of the paper earlier but forgot. Gordon is a private, religious, liberal-arts college &ndash; officially &quot;evangelical&quot;, which is a kind of catch-all term for conservative Protestants. The student body however is more diverse than that, with both very liberal and very conservative Christians, and many non-Christians as well, (though that's rarely talked about). <BR> <BR>So handling the demographic is tricky: wheras a national newspaper can carve out its niche in the political spectrum, we probably have a more complex range of readers to serve. The task would be easy if a garden variety, conservative evangelical Protestant had gotten the editorship: you just select and deliver the news from that point of view, and basically preserve the Gordon status quo. But I'm more of a progressive pseudo-Christian (a Quaker to be precise), so I have to think really hard about how to balance my views with what the Gordon community would prefer to hear. For example, we will probably publicize the nasty things done by some the companies Gordon is invested in, though it will probably make many people upset. <BR> <BR>And though we will be pretty leftist, I don't want us to be either shrill (trying to find common ground whenever possible) or alarmist (talking about important social issues, sure, but not trying to put everyone in a perpetual state of moral outrage). So a simple and gentle typeface might reflect that well.</div>
