  Arts tonight, without any prior knowledge of the topic of his lecture. Heller&#39;s
  interests slew all over the map, but most of the reason I was interested in hearing
  him speak had to do with <a href="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/4077/17238.html?1072731339">this
  old thread</a>, which has caused me to do a certain degree of muttering about him
  to my friends. &#40;I&#39;m in the throes of blackletter mania right now, you see.
  Or at least Rudolf Koch mania.&#41; <BR> <BR>As it turns out, that thread&#39;s
  perfect prep material for the lecture we saw, which concerned the uses of design
  within 20th century totalitarian regimes. As it turns out, it was a lively, fascinating,
  and only occasionally irritating lecture about Nazi Germani, fascist Italy, Mao&#39;s
  China, and the Soviet Union. There&#39;s no question Heller&#39;s a popularizer
  &#40;anytime he started straying onto topics where I had some expertise, his arguments
  started to sound facile&#41;, but he presented a lot of interesting material I hadn&#39;t
  seen before. <BR> <BR>He did repeat his potted history of how the Nazis used &#34;volksschrift&#34;
  &#40;i.e. blackletter&#41; as part of their totalitarian &#34;brand&#34;, and once
  again he neglected to mention how the Nazis eventually rejected blackletter, just
  as they&#39;d rejected modernism in the first place. I think I only noticed that
  because I was looking for it &#40;just like I only noticed that he misidentified
  a schwabacher script as a fraktur because I was just studying the differences last
  night&#41;. <BR> <BR>What comes through in his lecture was how much more effective
  the Nazis were at creating a unified &#34;brand identity&#34; than any of the other
  groups. He spent a lot of time presenting materials from the  '

  body: Forrest, thanks for the firsthand account. <BR> <BR>&#62; came across as a
    bit snide or triumphalist.  <BR> <BR>Indeed. <BR>A superset of Heller&#39;s flawed
    stance on the Swastika, blacketter, and anything that the Nazis happened to touch
    is his blind partisanship of the West, and condemnation of anything that tries
    to fight the tyrannies of the ascendant JudeoChristian establishment. By distracting
    us from the fascism of our <i>present</i> age, he&#39;s basically an agent for
    the powers that be. <BR> <BR>In a past issue of Print he had a short piece about
    alleged similarities between the UN logo and the old Soviet crest. And we know
    what the US and Israel think of the UN... In that piece Heller uses classic local
    news innuendo, as well as phrases like &#34;evil Soviets&#34; with a straight
    face. Disgusting. <BR> <BR>-- <BR> <BR>&#62; The real extraction of blackletter
    <BR>&#62; from public life came after 1945 <BR> <BR>And most significantly to
    us today, the contemporary vilification of fraktur comes from those who have the
    most to gain from perpetuating the remembrance of Nazi attrocities, the most to
    gain from brandishing something to hate. That would be OK if they were still the
    underdogs, but that&#39;s no longer the case. <BR> <BR>-- <BR> <BR>&#62; all arguments
    that attempt to tie particular <BR>&#62; forms to particular ideologies are flawed.
    <BR> <BR>Eternally, yes, that&#39;s not possible. But treating forms are shapes
    devoid of cultural context is just as naive. <BR> <BR>hhp

    <BR> <BR>I&#39;m sorry, Hrant, but I can&#39;t agree with this. I&#39;m not aware
    of any organized political, social, business, or industrial movement attempting
    to keep fraktur out of the public sphere. In my experience, what keeps it out
    of sight and out of mind has been personal, individual gut reactions.

    -yes, individuals- with certain political agendas use whatever is in their field
    &#40;in Heller&#39;s case, a symbol, a typestyle&#41; as tools to further those
    agendas. Some people do it as a &#34;reflex&#34; of sorts, others do it concertedly
    - but the result is that the &#34;abused tool&#34; suffers, through no fault of
    its own, and hence people who&#39;d like to use that tool for good &#40;like you
    and me&#41; suffer too. <BR> <BR>Fraktur is a doberman, that has simply switched
    abusive masters. <BR> <BR>hhp

    would never claim that any artistic development happens in a vacuum; I was discussing
    the modernists&#39; aspirations more than reality. <BR> <BR>Speer&#39;s work reminds
    me of those 18th century designs for monumental mausoleums. Stasis and heaviness
    are built into the architecture so strongly that I really wonder how he expected
    people to live with his designs over the long term. Even Nazis, who presumably
    thought that sort of thing was cool. <BR> <BR>&#62; Coolhunter Hitler. There is
    no absolute bond between the folky-blackletter-German idea of Kultur, and Nazi
    political power. As the wind turns, so does the creative director. <BR> <BR>Good
    phrase, and accurate too. All I&#39;m saying is based on the evidence I&#39;ve
    seen, blackletter held onto its role in articulating the visual identity of Nazism
    to the public of the Reich for what seems to be the duration of their rule, regardless
    of Hitler&#39;s edicts. Given time, I&#39;m sure Hitler would have moved them
    on to something else, but he didn&#39;t have that kind of time. <BR> <BR>&#62;

    pile all this baggage onto Steven Heller. There&#39;s a certain broadness to his
    moral judgments and a kind of blithe &#34;America #1!&#34; attitude in how he
    discusses the Soviets, but it&#39;s not like he&#39;s some kind of SECRET ZIONIST
    VINDICATOR. He&#39;s just a Jewish New York art director who likes being a Jewish
    New York art director, which makes it entirely logical and not really axe-grinding
    that he has problems with totalitarian regimes, anti-Semitism, and Stalinism.
    I mean, accusing the art director of the New York Times as being a tool of the
    establishment is not picking a very tough fight. <BR> <BR>Picking on blackletter
    as a visual symbol of Nazism is a bit of a facile &#40;and unfair&#41; judgment,
    but as Dan keeps saying, in the grand scheme of things, it&#39;s really not Heller
    who&#39;s keeping blackletter down.'
