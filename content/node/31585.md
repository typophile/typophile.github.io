  body: "Thanks for you all. I already visited all the links.\r\n\r\nThanks Stephen
    for your welcome and the suggestion (funny one).\r\nActually I'm looking for stop-motion
    examples, but based mostly on animated letters than in words... I want to prepare
    an assignment for my students, and this is why I'm collecting some examples. \r\n\r\nLook
    at this site:\r\nhttp://nejib.uing.net\r\n\r\nInspired on Norman MacLaren movies,
    which I like a lot!\r\n\r\nlaura\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
