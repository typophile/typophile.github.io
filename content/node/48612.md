    project? What is the subject matter? Who is your audience?

  body: "I would recommend something along the lines of Copperplate Gothic, an extended,
    all-cap look, for maximum contrast.\r\nFor instance, <a href=\"http://www.shinntype.com/beaufort.html\">Beaufort
    Extended</a>, with lots of letterspacing.\r\n\r\nIf going upper and lower, something
    equally spacious, i.e. with lots of leading and a small x-height, such as <a href=\"http://www.fontbureau.com/fonts/Nobel\">FB
    Nobel</a> or <a href=\"http://www.shinntype.com/figgins.html\">Figgins Sans.</a>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
