  body: "This kind of \u201Cfont\u201D usually resides in the memory of the thermic
    printer that uses it. So it\u2019s very unlikely you can find a digital equivalent.\r\nThere
    are some fonts that imitate the style, for example:\r\nhttp://new.myfonts.com/fonts/t26/ticket-de-caisse/\r\nhttp://new.myfonts.com/fonts/k-type/ticketing/\r\nAlso
    on Fonstruct.com (where you could make it yourself)"
