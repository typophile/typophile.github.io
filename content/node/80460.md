  main page layout]]\r\n\r\nMy book at present seems to be quite dull, also something
  about it looks off (I know a couple of lines end on 2 character words, I forgot
  to fix those before i made the jpeg.)\r\n\r\nI was wondering if anyone has any ideas
  to get some more interesting page layouts within this book....as the format is driving
  me quite barmy.\r\n\r\nImage pages are structured like this:\r\n[[http://www.flickr.com/photos/44380060@N07/5537208077/in/photostream/|Hunger
  page]]\r\n\r\nAlso older version of one of the other pages:\r\n[[http://www.flickr.com/photos/44380060@N07/5537678063/in/photostream/|Hand
  page]]"

  body: "Looking good!\r\nIs it possible to rotate and/or skew the triangle but keep
    all text horizontal?\r\nIs it an option to place text outside of the triangle
    (keep the triangle white)?\r\nYou've put the page numbers inside the triangle,
    how about putting those outside it?\r\n\r\nIt seems to me that - since your client
    is in to this kind of design - you've got a lot of freedom. Use it!\r\nGood luck!"

  body: "Actually this is a personal project for my course X) I wish I had a client
    like that!\r\n\r\nThough the restriction I have now placed on myself, is that
    the book is that shape, and that the triangle is the edge of the page. So it folds
    on that white diagonal line which goes through the middle of those two text blocks.\r\n\r\nThe
    reason for this shape, is that the book itself is a graphic illustration of an
    object from this horror/fantasy story. So the pages need to be like this for the
    main object to work.\r\n\r\n\r\nSo would you say play more with the direction
    of the text?"

  body: Ah, I see! Varying text directions is certainly an option. I'd suggest you
    play with type, type faces since and images since the shape is already determined.

  body: Try the text ragged, aligned to the spine (the lines will end orthogonal to
    the spine).
