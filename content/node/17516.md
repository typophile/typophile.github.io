  it closer to optimal workflow.  The curve is slowly leveling.\r\n\r\nI'm wondering
  if the font naming conundrum has been addressed or discussed since FL5's release.
  \ Has there been any further simplification or demystification beyond Mr. Twardoch's
  13 Step Program?\r\n\r\nAlso, could we get a tutorial from a panel of experts as
  to what all these disparate name fields do... what applications make use of them
  and how... whether some might be obsolete in a fully OTF savvy environment?"
