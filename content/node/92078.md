body: "The Font Testing Page is a tool primarily intended for type designers and independent
  foundries. It can also be used by art directors, graphic designers, teachers and
  students interested in seeing how a typeface works on the web.\r\n\r\nThere is a
  short video at:\r\nhttps://vimeo.com/40296571\r\n\r\nOperation is simple:\r\n- First,
  you must accept the request from the browser.\r\n- Then drag the font you want to
  try to the upper area of the Testing Page.\r\n\r\nBelow you will find 8 buttons:
  Headlines, Text, Lowercase Only, Adhesion Only, Caps, All Caps, Layout and Kern.\r\n-
  Headlines: Displays examples: 72, 60, 48, 36 and 30 to 12.\r\n- Text: Displays text
  blocks, from 20 to 10.\r\n- Lowercase only: Displays examples of 72, 60, 48, 36,
  30, 24, 18 and 16 to 10.\r\n- Adhesion only: Shows examples using only 'adhesion'
  text. Intended for the early stages on a typeface design.\r\n- Caps: Displays examples
  of words in Sentence Case at 60.\r\n- All Caps: Displays examples of words in All-Caps
  at 60.\r\n- Layout: Displays examples of Headline, Subhead and Body text.\r\n- Kern:
  Displays examples of combinations of letters and miscellaneous signs.\r\n\r\nUse
  it freely at:\r\nhttp://www.impallari.com/testing/\r\n- Requires Firefox 3.6+/Chrome
  13+\r\n- 100% safe: Your fonts are only stored in your own browser 'localStorage'.\r\n-
  Nothings gets uploaded to the server.\r\n\r\nBy Pablo Impallari (impallari.com)
  and Pablo Cosgaya (omnibus-type.com).\r\nBased on Fontdrag (fontdragr.com) and Dave
  Crossland's FontTest.\r\n"

    like bold and italic, on the same line, will ultimately be needed. But this is
    good as far as it goes.\r\n\r\nAnyway, this testing page works extremely excellently."
