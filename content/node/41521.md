  work.\r\nI have licensed cs3 and so I know that I can use the Adobe collection.\r\n\r\nWhat
  about all the system typefaces that are by default on my mac?\r\n\r\nI'd hate to
  use a typeface without a license, knowing how much effort it is to create one.\r\n\r\nThanks"

  body: The technical answer is read each individual EULA, but, in general, if the
    typefaces came bundled with purchased software (your OS, your Adobe Suite, etc.)
    then you have a license to use it.
