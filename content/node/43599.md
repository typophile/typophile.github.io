  you will find plenty of well organized images from some of history's greatest graphic
  artists, graphic art movements and styles. It might not be hardbound, but it's still
  inspiring."

  body: "<cite>My write up was a bit campy, wasn\u2019t it?</cite>\r\n\r\nNot half
    as campy as 99% of articles on Design Observer, and this Flickr gallery is very
    deserving of the praise. These images could have been collected into another overpriced
    stock library or sold to art schools for use during lectures. Turning them into
    a free online gallery is pretty generous. It may not equal the establishment of
    a great museum collection in financial terms, but it does in spirit. For design
    students, tracking down some of these images would involve tracking down an obscure
    book to see it at the size of a postage stamp. Good luck scanning that up for
    re-use in a research paper. Having these images available on Flickr is going to
    free up a hell of a lot of time that can be spent reading, writing, and of course,
    designing."
