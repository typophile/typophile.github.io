  now i'm trying to extent that in to a usable font.\r\n\r\ni'm not to bad at spacing
  loose words, but doing it in Fontlab with the space before and after is confusing,
  i have been at it for a wile, but i just don't get it, i'm doing something wrong.\r\n\r\nso
  please could someone point me in the right direction, and be free criticise the
  design"

  body: It's really hard to crit spacing when there's no consistent pattern. I'm struggling
    with my own spacing, so I'm not sure if I'm the one to speak anyway.

    is to ask people for guidelines, and whether the font is too\r\nloose or tight
    overall.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: Amazing the way you choose for the tail of the Q. I wonder if that Q will
    work in a real situation. Although your spacing seems good, you will have to work
    on kerning. However, it's hard to give and advice without any sentence.

  body: i'm not sure about that Q either, but i'm focussing on the making all the
    characters, and i'll decide later what has to be adjusted, i haven't looked at
    the kerning either, but i need a basic spacing format to see how my characters
    are working. thanks for your advice i really appreciate it, shoot at it all you
    want!
