    have expected either a square or a route2  proportion. This nearly square seems
    out of character. I wonder how thwy chose it?\r\n\r\nChrisL"

  body: "@Chris: I mucked about with the logo in Illustrator and there is no system
    to this thing at all. The squares have a 7:8 ratio, the whole something like 2
    to not quite 1.\r\nBut this may be something to be expected: swiss is what became
    of Swissair after their bankrupcy. Somebody probably slapped this together in
    a hurry. ; )\r\n\r\n. . .\r\nBert Vanderveen BNO\r\n\r\nPS Swissair had a really
    tight identity\u2026 Too bad."
