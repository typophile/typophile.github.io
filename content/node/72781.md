  lot like using Adobe Serif) but I'm put off by the lack of italics.\r\n\r\nCan you
  suggest a font that looks very similar to it but also has italics?\r\n\r\nHere's
  what it looks like: http://cg.scs.carleton.ca/~luc/MasahikoKozuka--KozukaMinchoMedium--1997.jpg"

  body: "Using what are basically Adobe Serif faux italics will look too much like
    one of those cases where the PDF viewer is using it as a fallback for missing
    fonts.\r\n\r\n[[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/adobe/itc-cushing/|ITC Cushing]]
    is an example of the genre with true italics.\r\n"

  body: Actually, Kozuka Mincho Pro does include a full set of italics that correspond
    to its proportional Latin glyphs. They are at CIDs 9444 through 9737, and are
    made accessible through the 'ital' GSUB feature, which is supported by InDesign.

  body: That's weird. I have six different weights but no italics. I'm using iWorks
    Pages, though. Can they only be accessed by InDesign?

  body: "Unfortunately, unless an application supports the 'ital' GSUB feature, or
    allows access to unencoded glyphs, the italic glyphs cannot be used. I doubt that
    iWorks Pages supports either.\r\n\r\nAlso, while the Latin glyphs in Kozuka Mincho,
    including the italic forms, are Adobe Serif, they are based on specific multiple
    master weights and widths, and are also scaled to be slightly larger."

  body: "Pages (and other Apple apps like TextEdit) have a pretty decent OpenType
    support: Open the font palette (Format > Font > Show Fonts \u2014 \u2318T). Open
    the fly-out menu that is hidden beneath the gearwheel icon, and you will find
    \u2018Typography\u2026\u2019 and \u2018Characters\u2026\u2019. The former gives
    you access to the OpenType features, incl. Kozuka Mincho\u2019s italics. Via the
    latter, you can manually insert glyphs, incl. unencoded ones."
