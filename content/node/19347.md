      when i enter to night-club, from a chashier.\r\n\r\nthen, i ask to one of the
      staff of the club who made this sticker.\r\nbut i couldn't get any promising
      information...\r\n\r\nsorry. it's pretty disturbing because its actual size
      is too small\r\nto look at each letters.\r\n\r\nthank you."

    to close of the lower part of the S like that?\r\n\r\nI have posted it to a couple
    other forums for you. I'd like to know what this is myself.\r\n\r\nI wish I had
    a catalog of Dan Solo fonts, because that seems like a good place to look for
    something like this."

    just picked up an another image. \r\nthis is a sticker of the same material, but,
    not for a visitor gets, a performer gets it. I got it from a friend last night!
    \r\nhow I think that it is the totally same face.\r\nwe still can see the border
    on S, can't we?\r\n\r\n"

    \r\n\r\nI'm curious, do you mind if I ask what you plan to do with this? You aren't
    going to start faking back-stage passes are you? If so, people might work harder
    on this ID if you promise to let us know how it works out for you.\r\n: )\r\n\r\n"

    designing for flyer of night club party.\r\nit is like my big hobby.\r\ninstead
    of designing free, i get admission free.\r\ni'm just a party girl... (\xB4\u2200\uFF40)\u30CE\r\n\r\nanyway\r\n\r\na
    few months ago, a client(?) requasted me to design using this MUSIC ESSENCE font
    and\r\nbought this sticker.\r\nat that time, i told him that i don't have this
    font. and i used one of the most similer in my font list.\r\nthen, the fiyer-making
    was finished without any problems.\r\n\r\nactual problem is that...\r\ni've been
    having the unknowned ID font in my mind since i got the sample sticker.\r\nthis
    font is too cool and lovely to get off my mind.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\ni don't have any
    plan with this font.\r\ni just wanna know its ID...\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n"

  body: "I'm betting the key to this one lies in some old Dan Solo CD, but I don't
    have any of those. I checked the ones for sale I could find online with no luck.
    I did see something with a similar feel at Nick's Fonts, and I saw that a Dan
    Solo font was the inspiration. But between this and the other places are some
    of the sharpest ID-ers there are, but no luck. I haven't seen Mike Bowfin lately,
    so keep checking back.\r\n\r\nI have looked so much the C, E, S, and K/Rs are
    etched in my mind.\r\n: )"

  body: I looked twice through my copy of The Solotype Catalog. I can't say that it
    looks familiar, either. The weird thing is that it <em>looks</em> like something
    from the early '70s.
