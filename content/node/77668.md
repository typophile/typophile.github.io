  company called \"Natural Power\". This italian company sells solar panels, geotermic
  and wind mills solutions and needed a strong and expandable logo.\r\n\r\nI created
  the below concept focusing on their primary comunication needs: Eco friendly and
  Professional looking.\r\n\r\nThe logo needs tweeking here and there, but just consider
  the idea that's behind this concept. Also consider that this logo will be used almost
  Everywhere stamped on Cardboard, to maintain it's eco-friendly image.\r\n\r\n\r\nHere
  is it:"

  body: I think the leaf is far too subtle, and will be lost at smaller sizes. It's
    also been done to death and has nothing at all to do with solar panels, geothermic
    and wind mills. There's a wealth of imagery surrounding the subject. Why not suggest
    heat, movement, energy storage, etc.

  body: "While I do enjoy logos that have a hidden element, I would say this one is
    much too subtle. \r\n\r\nI also agree with Bloodtype about the leaf as a \"green\"
    element being a bit played out and a bit unrelated to the company. If you want
    to continue with the leaf, you could hint at the vein that runs down the center,
    and I would definitely make the stem wider. If not, I'd love to see some reference
    to solar energy, geothermic energy, windmills, etc. It would hep you work stand
    out from the sea of 'green' logos out there."

    "Power"? OK, maybe they are too contrasty together.

  body: "I think the original logo is great. The leaf is indeed too subtle and something
    needs to be done about it, but the modesty of the type decoration is exactly what
    makes the logo. It is also a nice play on the \"natural\" aspect - just the natural
    type with a slight tweak that's sufficient for its purpose (and in this it is
    different from Sevag's options that are IMO just way in-your-face obvious). Concept-wise
    I think it's fine too. Leaf = trees = nature, not a big stretch by any means.\r\n\r\nI
    would consider tightening Natural and perhaps using a bit heavier weight (to make
    the leaf stand out more).\r\n\r\n(edit) What could be an interesting thing to
    try is to build an Objectified-style logo out of devices/gadgets they are dealing
    with. Though I guess this could come out as clone of Objectified design... in
    any case, just a thought."

    would try to work toward something that speaks to the uniqueness of the organization."

  body: "Thank you to everyone!!\r\n\r\nIn the end my client wanted to maintain the
    leaf, so I adjusted it and made it more legible as suggested.\r\n\r\nIt still
    need some tweaking , but I think that the major part it's done.\r\n\r\n@ Sevag
    Blanc: thanks for taking the time to give me ideas! I will definetly take these
    in consideration but for the colour I guess I can't do much as the logo will be
    printed in cardboard most of the times :(\r\n\r\n@apankrat : thank you for the
    constructive comment, you got the idea perfectly.\r\n\r\n@Luma Vine: Damn, in
    this logo sea it seems that having an original idea is becoming more dificult
    day after day... I haven't seen that before anyway, but I'll stick to a different
    leaf style..  I have tight, really tight deadlines for this logo so , as the two
    companys are in different part of the world and, most important, they offer different
    services, I'll stick to this concept.\r\n\r\n\r\nAgain, thanks to everyone for
    taking the time and let me know what do you think of this upgrade!\r\n\r\nhttp://img210.imageshack.us/i/naturalpowerlogo2.png/\r\n\r\np.s.:

  body: I really do think we pander too much to clients these days. Time was, you
    would be able to say, "this leaf idea of yours has been done to death. If you
    want to stand out, I strongly suggest taking a more original path", and you'd
    be listened to. Respect for the design profession has taken a nosedive in the
    past few years, partly due to the proliferation of software and DIY possibilities,
    but also because we're willing to take it. I know I've been guilty of it in the
    past, but I hope I've learned from it. If someone says they can't see any difference
    between my work and some stock logo, or slideshow website, then I'm happy to let
    them go that way.
