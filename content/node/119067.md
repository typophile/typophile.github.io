body: "I'm designing a serif typeface, and I'm wondering what's the acceptable amount
  of latinization for the mu (\xB5) glyph? I'm talking about the \xB5 in the Latin-1
  Supplement block\u2014the one used for typesetting \"\xB5m\" & stuff, not the mu
  in the actual Greek block. Most fonts I've seen do the same for both glyphs, with
  no serifs, a curved spur and a blob at the bottom of the stem. But I don't know
  how well that blends when set next to a latin 'm'. I've seen many fonts where the
  microns just looked horrible. I guess the same issue comes up with the IPA lambda
  and phi.\r\n\r\nIs the following design acceptable?\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Screenshot

  of the '\xB5's bowl and the stem?"
