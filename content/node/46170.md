    Taboo \u2013 What are your feelings on stretching type?</a> (and, concerning newspapers,
    especially what Claus has written about [[Gerard Unger]]\u2019s works.)\r\nAlso:

  body: Some faces were designed to withstand squooshing (those of Gerard Unger, as
    Florian mentioned, are examples) but most will not, and Cheltenham is certainly
    one that should not be squooshed.

    fragility of the face of course, remaining firmly between 96% and 104% is prudent
    if finding/commissioning the correct width/weight you need is not possible.\r\n\r\nCheers!"
