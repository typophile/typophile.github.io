  body: It might be based on <a href=http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/ef/edwardian/>Edwardian</a>,
    which I found after being reminded of <a href=http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/device/sparrowhawk/regular/>Sparrowhawk's</a>
    curved bars and other parts. The N and H especially bear a resemblance, although
    other letters diverge in what seems to be a custom job (as Stephen and David said).
