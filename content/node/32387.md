  body: "You did fine on the CSS. The site has a nice design with nice, clean whitespace
    and good black-and-white contrast. I saw a few hyphens in a row on the home page,
    but that's more a matter of opinion than faith. ;-) \r\n\r\nIf your clients weren't
    so arts-oriented I'd say the emphasis on such things as Haas Grotesque being renamed
    Helvetica would be superfluous, since most clients are primarily concerned with
    the bottom line. At the same time, I'd still keep that in mind since such cultural
    institutions are usually the first to lose funding (in the U.S. at least). So
    you might want to add facts about how after this museum's annual review was published,
    contributions exceeded expectations by 120%, that sort of thing."
