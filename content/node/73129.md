  effect has been added. I think it may be the same or similar to the one Sky One
  used for their LOST promos.\r\n\r\nThanks for your help.\r\n\r\n"

    R's and A's are not the same. It is quite likely they were added with a graphics

  body: "It's definitely NOT Impact. Nonono. The kick on the R is more akin to Helvetica
    Inserat. Impact was, however, used for Lost promos and DVD boxart.\r\n\r\nI've
    had a look in all the usual places, but all the Helvetica variants appear to be
    too wide and/or friendly to be this. It's also not Hoefler's Champion, though
    it's closer; but bowl on the R is too flat on the vertical.\r\n\r\nBut enough
    about what it's not...what IS it?\r\n\r\n-NJ"

    work out what this one is! Thanks for the help so far...

  body: The R reminded me of H&FJ's [[http://typography.com/fonts/font_overview.php?productLineID=100013|Knockout]],
    but the <em>E</em> doesn't seem to match.
