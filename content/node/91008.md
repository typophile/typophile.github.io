body: "Hi everyone,\r\n\r\nQuick post looking for suggestions.  I will be going down
  to London for the day in the next couple of weeks and was wondering if anyone had
  any suggestions on good typographical things to do while I'm down there?\r\n\r\nBy
  typographical, I mean exhibitions, museums, book stores, any cool type/graphic design
  things to help fill my day that I wouldn't normally get to see.\r\n\r\nThanks in
  advance.\r\n\r\nSimon"

  body: You might try the St Bride Library on Fleet St. But I'm not sure if you might
    have to make an appointment. Search St Bride Library; they're bound to have a
    website.
