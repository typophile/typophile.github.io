  body: Personally, i'd like to see some more color. I think maybe a medium weight
    or at least something a little more bold for the headers, nothing big, something
    subtle.

  body: "Good luck with the jobs!\r\n\r\nI think that if you incorporate the above
    comments, you could easily lose all those guidelines. For a graphic desigener,
    they just read a bit insecure + a bit dated."

  body: "I agree with Rob as well... it needs something to break it up more visually,
    right now it's a lot of uniform text (very intimidating) -- but nicely done.\r\n\r\nAs
    for the resum\xE9 itself,\r\n\r\nA) Your \"objective\" is not one... it's a description.
    Needs to be changed to include the type of job you're looking for (can be modified
    depending on job). In other words, \"Designer seeks position as low-paid peon\"
    or whatever.\r\n\r\nB) Education - Lose the G.P.A. - if it's not 4.0, it looks
    bad, and if it IS 4.0, it looks like you're bragging.\r\n\r\nC) Employment - I
    feel kind of lost here, again because everything's the same weight. As an employer,
    I want to see 1) where you worked and 2) what you did... i.e., WEB DESIGNER, HORIZON
    MEDIA GROUP. I don't hink the address and phone are necessary, the city should
    be enough. And I think you need to make the \"descriptive\" text into more common
    english - a (short) paragraph, not bullet points. Include what the COMPANY did/was
    (i.e., \"Developed brand identities for clients of major design firm,\" or whatever).\r\n\r\nD)
    Software Proficiency -- this is tricky. Yous is fine, but you may want ot include
    versions too (Dreamweaver 6-MX, Mac OSX, etc).\r\n\r\nE) Selected Projects is
    OK, but i usually don't recommend this level of detail in a resume -- that's what
    a portfolio/interview is for. Since you don't have that much job experience, it
    may be OK here, but I'd lose it myself."

    guess you either love or hate it.\r\n\r\nI'll be fine tuning the resume tonight,
    so check back for an update. "

    (it gives the employer valuable info about you, after all) instead of an objective...
    Just label it \"Profile\" instead of \"Objective\".\r\n\r\n<em>No slams about
    it being in Helvetica Neue? I expected someone to groan.</em>\r\n\r\nMy own resume
    is set in two weights of Franklin Gothic... If it's clear, and legible, and you
    feel that a clean sans serif says something about you, then I say use it."

  body: "I'll slam the helvetica. Well, I won't SLAM it, but I'd really go for something
    else. \r\n\r\nIt's also crowded. It needs more white space...both in the margins
    and in the leading.\r\n\r\nThe lines...might be a bit much. If you stick with
    them, consider fading them back to a light grey, but maybe try a version sans
    the lines.\r\n\r\nSkip the objective because a) you don't actually describe your
    objective and b) what you did write really should be flushed out as a cover letter.\r\n\r\nIf
    you are going to force-justify your text, hang the punctuation. \r\n\r\nSoftware
    proficiency...not sure if you need the years in there. I'd just make that a comma
    separated sentence. \"Skilled with InDesign, Illustrator, Photoshop, etc... Familiar
    with...\"\r\n\r\nSelected projects...I'd pull that out as a separate sheet. Make
    it a mini-portfolio. That way you can show some visuals.\r\n\r\nGood luck! And
    I'm jealous that you are in Portland. Love that place.\r\n"

  body: I find the long lines hard to read, more white space is needed. People need
    to access the important information they want to see instantly so ask someone
    a question about something on your CV if they can find it without looking to hard,
    its doing its job.
