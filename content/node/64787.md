  optimization tool for minimizing the font file size by stripping out parts of the
  font not needed along with some freely available fonts.  The site also lists the
  \"The font-subsetting source code.\"  \r\n\r\nI was wondering if this type of function
  is available in any software usable on a Mac or is available as a web op that could
  do the same for a user with a particular font he is in posession of?\r\n\r\nHopefully
  I've made myself clear enough.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance\r\n\r\nPatrick Chuprina"
