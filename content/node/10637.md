    <BR>thing i noticed is the length of the extenders. the t throws me off the most.
    <BR> <BR>i dig the g, mostly for it&#39;s sheer oddity. funny how something so
    small <BR>can make such a big difference. <BR> <BR>the serifs on x and y seem
    a little sharper and more pronounced than the rest. <BR> <BR>this has been far

    thinks of your boumas.

  body: 'I don&#39;t think we&#39;re going anyone a favour discussing whether a &#39;g&#39;
    without an ear works while studiously ignoring the fundamental problems of weight,
    proportion, stress and consistency. It seems obligatory on the Typophile critique
    to find something nice to say about every typeface, and to limit criticism to
    details, but the fact is that this is a typeface with a hell of a lot of very
    basic problems. <BR> <BR>Graham, you need to go back and look at a lot more type
    much more closely. Begin with the uppercase letters&#42; and concentrate on proportion
    and stress &#40;pattern of thick and thin strokes&#41;. Letters in your design
    with extreme problems are A, J, M, N, P, R, U, and V. When you&#39;ve figured
    out better proportions and have the stress falling in logical places &#40;see
    especilly M and N&#41;, than start looking at details. Check the consistency of
    your serifs &#40;B, P and R all have problems&#41;. The uppercase R probably has
    more problems than any other letter. <BR> <BR>From looking at some features of
    your design, especially the E and L, I see that Goudy has been a inspiration.
    Fred Goudy was occasionally a genius, but he has very little to teach anyone else:
    his work is idiosyncratic, and when it succeeds its a happy surprise. As a beginner,
    you would learn more from a more systematic designer like W.A. Dwiggins, Matthew
    Carter or Walter Tracy, in whose work one can see the logic behind the design
    decisions. Goudy was a kind of freak of nature. <BR> <BR>I recommend that you
    pick up a copy of Gerrit Noordzij&#39;s <i>Letterletter</i>. Don&#39;t treat it
    as a text book, and don&#39;t accept everything that it has to say as gospel,
    but it will provide you with the mental tools to understand what is happening
    structurally in a typeface. <BR> <BR>&#42;I wouldn&#39;t nomally recommend to
    a designer working on a &#39;text&#39; face to start with the uppercase, but I
    think it is a good way for a beginner to cut his teeth because the number of issues
    to deal with is smaller than in the lowercase. I think everyone&#39;s first typeface
    design should be caps only.'

    you can see I avoided it entirely... :-/  On the other hand, I think maybe this
    is a design that doesn&#39;t appeal to John, and he&#39;s not appreciating that
    it might still appeal the others, and even make some money? Hey, frankly it doesn&#39;t
    appeal to my aesthetic either, but to me a good critique starts with putting yourself
    in the other person&#39;s shoes. <BR> <BR>Oh, and do read Letterletter, but with
    a 20 pound bag of salt under your right hand. Or your left hand if that makes

  body: 'Saying that the writing of left-handers writing in a particular direction
    &#40;left-to-right&#41; with a particular writing implement is not readable is
    very different from saying that left-handers are illiterate. Illiterate typically
    means unable to read, not unable to write readably. <BR> <BR>You ignore GN&#39;s
    statement that &#39;I encourage left-handed students to write with their left
    hand [as opposed to some teachers who still force lefties to try to write with
    the right hand], because they too should work under optimal conditions.&#39; This
    seems to me a very long way from saying that left handers are &#39;uncivilised&#39;.
    <BR> <BR>He goes on to to say that the broad nib is &#39;essential for <i>discussing</i>
    left-handed writing&#39; [my italics]; he is not saying that everyone must use
    broad nibs, as you seem to be suggesting, but that the broad nib reveals the difference
    between left and right hand writing <i>in the same direction</i>. His point about
    writing downwards is that this is the only way for left handed people to obtain
    the same stress pattern that <i>readers</i> expect and are used to recognising
    in, ahem, boumas. He does not say anywhere that the result of writing downward
    is unreadable to themselves or to anyone else: he says completely the opposite,
    that it is only by writing downwards that they can produce something generally
    readable. Rather than being contra-reader &#40;user&#41; as you seem to be suggesting,
    he is saying the opposite: that in order to satisfy the reader a lefty with a
    broad nib needs to write downward rather than left-to-right. <BR> <BR>Basically,
    I think you have completely and utterly misread every sentence of this short piece,
    perhaps because you have convinced yourself that it is &#39;cryptic&#39;. It is
    not: it is straightforward. <BR> <BR> <BR>I have not read Bilak&#39;s interview

    to them, but readable to anyone, because if they write from left-to-right the
    stress in their letters falls in an unfamiliar pattern that makes it difficult

    lc &#34;d&#34;&#42; is Bad, and even <BR>the dark weights of Ruse are more appropriate
    for text. Bull. <BR> <BR>&#42; John, you&#39;ve said that that glyph doesn&#39;t
    bother you. Good for you. You&#39;re not a GN-er. Admit it and stop evangelizing
    something you don&#39;t really even believe in! <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>

  body: 'Hrant, your basic misconception is that in attempting to <i> understand</i>
    something, I am evangelising it. My interest is in understanding what Noordzij
    has to say, which so far has turned out to be different enough from what Papazian
    thinks Noordzij is saying for me to reject your interpretation. But now the conversation
    has become silly: you quote Noordzij without context and pronounce an outrageous
    conclusion that cannot possibly be supported from the text that you quote; I point
    out that what you quote doesn&#39;t support your conclusion, and suggest an interpretation
    that is better supported by Noordzij&#39;s words; you ignore me and begin again
    by changing the focus to the Perpetua d or the weights of Ruse or some other thing
    <i> that is completely without reference to the original ideas under discussion.</i>
    I&#39;m sorry but I can&#39;t discuss this any more with you, since you repeatedly
    refuse to stick to what interests me, which is to understand. You say that I &#39;consistently
    side-step&#39; most of your points; this is because I believe most of your points
    are red-herrings and empty provocations thrown up to distract me from the one
    thread of the conversation that I&#39;m doggedly trying to follow.   <BR>   <BR>You
    wrote earlier that you argue because you enjoy it, not because you&#39;re right.
    I engage in conversations because I&#39;m interested in understanding the subject
    of discussion, and know that other people, even people I disagree with, can contribute
    to that understanding. It&#39;s a pity that, because of your hobby, almost every
    conversation with you becomes an argument.'
