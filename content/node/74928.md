  what\u2019s the source? A while ago I tried to find it in his <em>Unterricht in
  ornamentaler Schrift</em> (Vienna, 1905), and failed. "

  body: "If the quote is about the <em>term</em> \xABSchrift\xBB stemming from the
    <em>term</em> \xABSchreiben\xBB, \xABvon\xBB is correct. I've also seen it with
    quotes around the two terms, which helps this reading.\r\n\r\nI thought it was
    by Larisch, too. I'll be curious if anyone knows more."
