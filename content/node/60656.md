body: I bought the digital Monotype Centaur before finding that even on 300dpi laser
  output and at 14pt it looks (as I could have discovered at less cost with a little
  research) a bit skinny and undifferentiated compared to my distant memory of a Rogers
  example from metal. The intended book will be digitally printed, at higher resolution
  of course, so I don't think this will improve in the 'press'. Any thoughts on a
  better digital font in the same idiom?

    Adobe Jenson. Or also very interesting and fine is Rialto by Alois Karner/Giovanni
    de Faccio.'

    weight a bit heavy. Also, the ideosyncricities of Jenson bother me a bit, and
    to my eye, are different that those of Centaur. YMMV\r\n\r\n*Idiom* is a loaded
    word. You might take a look at Arno, another Adobe font."

  body: Many thanks all, I'm investigating these suggestions. The subject matter is
    the life & works of a Victorian/Edwardian boat designer/artist/writer, with far
    more pages of drawings than text, so I think it would gain from something slightly
    Arts & Crafts in feel, and at a large enough size to appear well-formed (since
    the readership will be mature & short-armed).

    doubt the boats were Arts & Crafts or historical revivals, which is what Centaur
    was.\r\n\r\nIMO Cheltenham is the most representative Arts & Crafts type of the
    Progressive era.\r\nKennerley was another popular type at the time, a new design
    in an historical genre, with a more old-tech vibe than Cheltenham.\r\nModerns
    were still predominantly in use for text, if a refined finish would be appropriate.\r\n "

  body: Thanks again each; I suppose I was being less than rigorous in my use of "Arts
    & Crafts" as shorthand for the feel I'm after. I have had a look at all the later
    suggestions, and am going with Adobe Jenson as it fits the bill for me both aesthetically
    and technically, and would get more use with me than the other candidates.

  body: "I\u2019m impressed by your careful traditional typography, which is appropriate
    to the era of the books\u2019 subject matter. However, I must say that I find
    the choice of typeface disturbingly anachronistic. The revival of Incunabula styles,
    and Jenson in particular, only began with Morris, and wasn\u2019t at all authentic
    until Benton\u2019s Cloister, c.1914 (and Adobe Jenson is nothing if not authentic).
    You should have used a Scotch Modern, to fully capture the flavour of the times,
    and that is what I would have recommended, had you mentioned the dates of the
    works/subject matter.\r\n\r\n<cite>Making an \u201Callusive\u201D format for a
    book\u2014that is, casting it in the style of the period of the original text\u2014is
    in a small way something like planning the stage setting of a play. An up-to-date
    style for an ancient text would compare with staging </cite>Hamlet<cite> in modern
    dress. However novel and effective in its own way, you feel it to be strange,
    and this sense of strangeness is an annoying distraction; you are forced to think
    of the setting and the designer, rather than the text. </cite>\u2014Bruce Rogers

  body: I somehow thought you'd be back Nick, and thanks. I am not of course a typographer,
    or a designer, I operate by moonlight, and try to absorb advice wherever I can,
    having no budget for professional involvement, plus of course I enjoy the execution
    & learning. The original material in the "Holmes" book dates from the 1880s to
    the mid-1930s, and that which was not in facsimile I set in Miller which seemed
    appropriate given the description of that face as derived from news and magazine
    workhorses of the 19th century (it originally appeared in a club journal). The
    text set in Jenson was new, written in 2008, but Centaur originating in the middle
    of the period described, I thought I might get away with it, and I needed to differentiate
    it from the original matter in the book. My use of Jenson in the little 1892 yarn
    by Lewis I knew to be slightly suspect but time and budget were short. The fact
    that none of my readers are bothered by any of this does not absolve me from a
    certain responsibility, of course. I hope and believe I'm a careful setter of
    continuous text, I 'buy' most of what Bringhurst says (not glyph scaling!). Display
    setting is something I am not yet confident with. There's a lot more in the works,
    and it should get better. Your comment re Scotch Modern is not at all invalidated
    by the existence of your own example, which I find lovely and will undoubtedly
    be using sometime.
