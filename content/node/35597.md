  of fonts (I gather we need to get Open Type fonts - I'm not a PC user so all new
  to me).  We are looking for a collection of popular fonts, with a variety of styles,
  around the $200 mark.  Also preferably one that we can download as international
  shipping seems to be very pricey.  Can you recommend anything ?\r\nThanks !\r\n\r\n"

  body: When I was looking for font collections recently, it seemed to be hard to
    find ones in the price range you mentioned. There are a few for approximately
    $500, but most are between $1000 and $2500, such as StormType's, Fountain's, and
    PSY/OPS'. StormType does have ~$500 packages, so that may be your best bet. $200,
    in my experience, would seem to be several individual fonts, a few font families,
    or one or two really comprehensive OpenType font families.

  body: You might want to consider picking up a cheap copy of WordPerfect X3, which
    has a goodly number of fonts as well, all OT(TT) format. Not many are enhanced
    for OT because WP doesn't really handle OT features. But it does give a good breadth
    of fonts to work with.
