    you'll have to manually kern it up the wazoo. If you can drift further I might
    look towards Bell as well.\r\n\r\nBTW, display Baskervilles generally come from
    the Fry's lineage, not the authentic JB branch. Just sayin'.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    doesn't seem to have any heavy weights. It has ornamented capitals, though, which
    may be suited for display use.
