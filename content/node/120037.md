body: "Hi, there!\r\n\r\nI have a problem with kerning using VOLT. \r\nI completed
  kern settings in VOLT and it works, but only in VOLT. When I ship the font it recognize
  only kerning between numbers, but not between numbers and some letters (isolated
  letters eg.). \r\n\r\nHow do you solve this problem if you have it?\r\n\r\nA."

  body: The Arabic language is written in right to left direction while numbers are
    written from left to right. So there is no way to do kerning between Digits and
    Arabic letters. Kerning only works when the direction of flow is same for both
    members of the kerning pair.
