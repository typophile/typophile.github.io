    speaking, Unicode doesn't use names, or if you want to insist it does, then the
    *name* is \"uni\" or \"U\" plus the Unicode number.\r\n\r\nPostScript Type 1 however,
    was dependent on names, and many operating systems had a hard-wired encoding vector.
    \"solidus\" \"full stop\" were not in that encoding vector; characters so named
    would not display.\r\n\r\nIf you want to say the names you've given were preferred
    in the UK before, say, 1990, that's fine. But he's asking a technical question."

  body: "@Michael_Rowley\r\n@charles_e\r\n\r\nDespite your observations, the most
    likely reason that the glyphs are marked in red is that they have two Unicode
    values assigned to them. In the case of fraction, probably 002F and 2044; in the
    case of periodcentered, probably 00B7 and 0387; and, in the case of hyphen, probably
    002D and 00AD. In all cases, clicking the green diamond next to the Unicode box,
    then clicking APPLY, will resolve the issue."

  body: "Nick, you're quite right, I was just remarking on the *name* game.\r\n\r\nBTW,
    it is fine to have two codepoints assigned to one glyph. Won't hurt a thing. Just
    a bit of red in a FontLab file . . ."

  body: "This indicates a mismatch of your glyph naming with the standard.nam file
    that maps glyphnames to Unicodes. The standard.nam file only \"permits\" a handful
    of double-mappings. Because of Adobe recommendations, FontLab Studio recommends
    to duplicate glyphs such as \"hyphen\" into two glyphs: \"hyphen\" and \"uni00AD\".
    \r\n\r\nThe mismatch would also be shown if the glyphnames and Unicodes would
    REALLY mismatch, i.e. if the glyph \"A\" had the Unicode of the glyph \"C\", for
    example. "

    last year, when I finished it I'm sure none of the glyphs were red.\r\nI had to
    look at the font recently and noticed the hyphen and omega glyphs are red.\r\n"

  body: 'charles_e (and others): the names I gave were the names given in Unicode
    5.0 for the glyphs matching the codepoints; I was rather surprised by some of
    them (e.g.full stop), but it can only give one name, though in the book it does
    give give alternatives. I do know that Unicode does''nt use English names, but
    it provides them for humans to identify the glyphs that are supposed to represent
    the abstract characters. Incidentally the hyphen-minus is misidentified as a ''hyphen''.'

  body: "I usually encounter this when renaming the commaaccent, Ibreve, and Greek
    math glyphs to use their unicode identifier as both name and unicode. (ibreve,
    uni012A, Ibreve, uni0218, Scedilla, uni0162, uni021A, uni012D, scedilla, uni0219,
    uni0163, uni021B, f_i, f_l, Delta, Omega, mu). The reason is that I am trying
    to fix a problem and have the same unicode index for two glyphs.\r\n\r\nuni021B
    and uni0218 are my worst offenders since they look nearly identical as names--the
    B and 8 are easily missread by me on screen."

  body: "Rachel, \r\n\r\nyou may have installed an updated standard.nam (e.g. through
    installing Fontographer 5 demo or full version on the same machine as FontLab
    Studio), or you've picked a different standard glyphname-to-Unicode mapping file
    in Preferences / General / Unicode and OpenType. \r\n\r\nBTW, if you feel your
    glyphnames are right but your Unicodes aren't, you can fix this using Glyph /
    Glyph Names / Generate Unicode. If your Unicodes are correct, you can generate
    recommended glyphnames using Glyph / Glyph Names / Generate Names. \r\n\r\nIn
    fact, you can fix most of these problems by first doing Generate Unicode, and
    then Generate Names. The first step will accept obsolete glyphnames to generate
    correct Unicodes, the second stem will use the corrected Unicodes and will generate
    new, recommended glyphnames in place of the obsolete ones. \r\n\r\nBTW, I should
    point out that installing Fontographer 5 demo will give you a new set of glyphname-to-Unicode
    mapping files, which will be also available in FontLab Studio. Along with new
    and updated encodings that also come with Fontographer 5, this will upgrade your
    FontLab Studio to year 2010 of \"proper\" glyph naming and encoding. \r\n\r\nBest,\r\nAdam\r\n"
