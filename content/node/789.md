body: Greetings Typophiles, <BR> <BR>This is my first font post to typophile.com.
  It&#39;s a silly little number called Hotcakes. I&#39;ve always wanted to throw
  a big, fat slab serif on a lower case &#34;o&#34;. The letterforms tilt and bounce
  on an uneven baseline. This is a work in progress so any thoughts or suggestions
  are greatly appreciated. <BR> <BR>The uppercase N makes me cringe. Anyone?? <BR>

  body: Hi Tom <BR> <BR>i like what i see, some few comments though... <BR> <BR>-.i
    think you should solve you &#34;n&#34; and &#34;m&#34; like you did it with your
    &#34;h&#34;, and maybe there you have a &#34;u&#34; also. <BR> <BR>-.i like how
    you close the eye of the &#34;9&#34;, maybe you should close that way your &#34;p&#34;
    an &#34;q&#34; <BR> <BR>-.your UC &#34;O&#34; and &#34;Q&#34; are too open <BR>
    <BR>-.your &#34;b&#34; looks like an &#34;h&#34;, maybe you should close it someway
    <BR> <BR>-.i think your &#34;W&#34; should be solve like your &#34;V&#34; <BR>
    <BR>good luck and good job <BR> <BR>CG

  body: It looks nice, but the serifs are too heavy, and makes the typeface too complex.  <BR>
    <BR>Resolve it with semi serifs, you need more white spaces.  <BR> <BR>Use more
    angles like on the A and V on all the upercases, those curves are pure distraction.

    by Tobias Frere-Jones, only using a more controlled vocabulary. Well, as controlled
    a vocabulary you can use for a bouncy display face, anyway. <BR> <BR>Regarding
    Miguel&#39;s comment, perhaps eliminating some of the serifs altogether in the
    more complex characters such as the 3, B, H, Q, M, m, W, w'

  body: 'Great suggestions all! My initial thought for the font was big honking serifs...but
    perhaps they honk too loudly. The characters seem to need some breathing room
    and minimizing the serifs will help. <BR> <BR>Grant: It&#39;s funny, I forgot
    all about Improv. I thought a serif O was rather unique. Perhaps I should think
    again? <BR> <BR>Is the font lacking a funk factor? Should I loosen it up a bit
    like Delores? <BR> <BR>I&#39;m going to upload another work in progress called
    Boneyard and would like to get your suggestions.'

  body: Well, I sort of started from scratch and no letter was spared. The face is
    overall more controlled and condensed &#40;and slightly heavier&#41;. The serifs
    are smaller and many letters were simplified. Most letters still jump and step,
    but in a less random manner. The Q, E and l each have an alternate. <BR> <BR>I
    experimented with sharp strokes for the UC, but it became more somber and seemed
    to lose it&#39;s playfulness. So I went the opposite direction and tried to round
    strokes where possible. I&#39;m wondering if I should take this approach with
    the X, x, y, V and v.  <BR> <BR>Any and all suggestions are welcome! <BR> <BR><img

  body: Hey Tom. <BR> <BR>I&#39;d really like to see a couple headlines or short passages
    set this version. The new loopy lowercase &#39;l&#39; and the alternate &#39;Q&#39;
    are nice departures.

  body: 'Hi Grant: I&#39;ve revised some of the letters because they seemed stiff
    and lifeless compared to other characters such as the &#34;l&#34; and &#34;g&#34;.
    There are also some weight issues I need to resolve.  <BR> <BR> <img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/15336.gif"
