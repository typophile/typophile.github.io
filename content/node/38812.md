body: "Okay. So this is probably going to sound crazy, but it makes sense in my head,
  so let's see if I can put it into words well enough to garner some conversation.\r\n\r\nI
  see personalities in type, as I'm sure most of you do. But I'm taking this to the
  extreme, and personifying a handful of typefaces, writing about them as if they
  were people. I've chosen one typeface from each 'category' (although I'm not using
  any official categorization standard for my basis. Kind of a cross between Adobe's
  and Bringhurst's, with a little bit of Doyald Young's, although not that extensive),
  and am talking about the typeface 'personality,' laying out a specimen of the typeface,
  and then examining the differences between that typeface and its close relatives
  (Bodoni gets compared to Didot, etc). I'm also creating motifs out of each typeface
  to help show type as image, which most people don't see it as (Nick Shinn's article
  on FF Oneleigh in Made by FontFont was really interesting on this subject), kind
  of like Emigre's [[http://emigre.com/EF.php?fid=98|Hypnopaedia]], which I didn't
  discover until I was halfway into the project.\r\n\r\nOkay, so all that being said,
  I'm trying to figure out exactly what to do with this collection of personalities.
  It seems to me that I have a group of representatives; each typeface represents
  a category of other typefaces. If there were an organization of these representatives,
  what would it be? Would it be like a Congress, or Parliament, even? Where the collection
  of all of them were important for the well-being of the general whole? Maybe Parliament
  would be better, as some members are there by birthright\u2014I don't really ever
  see Garamond being kicked out of this organization. Or is it more of a professional
  organization, like the AIGA, where several members come together on a board of directors?
  And then the question becomes, what exactly are they all coming together to <em>do</em>?
  To communicate is a good place to start ... maybe to serve designers? If you could
  imagine such a gathering/organization, what would it look like? What would the point
  of it be?\r\n\r\nI hope that's not too crazy, and that it makes some sense. I'm
  really interested to see what others have to say!\r\n\r\nP.S. This is a pseudo-school
  project. I'm working with a faculty advisor on it, but it is not an actual assignment,
  rather, something I wanted to do for my own fun ... yep, I'm a full blown nerd.\r\n\r\nThe
  main typefaces I'm including are:\r\nGaramond\r\nCochin\r\nHelvetica\r\nFutura\r\nJohnston\r\nRockwell\r\nBodoni\r\nsome
  sort of double-feature on Mrs Eaves and Baskerville (that one's going to be fun!)\r\nand
  a display or two, tbd\r\n\r\nSorry for the ridiculously long post....\r\n"

    You seem to assume somehow that all these typefaces exist in a peaceable kingdom.
    They hardly knew each other. I'd say Bringhurst is partly the blame for this kind
    of crap.\r\n\r\nGerald\r\n\r\nThe Bieler Press\r\nhttp://BielerPress.blogspot.com"

    some respectable graphology, which is not something that's much respected.\r\nA
    lot of them would end up with split personalities, especially blackletter, hanging
    out on Christmas cards and gangsta tattoos.\r\nNonetheless, types are cyphers,
    and we all have our special meanings and associations which we attach to them,
    so you can work with that."

  body: "Sorry if I was unclear. I'm not trying to assign each typeface a specific,
    limiting personality, but rather see possible, strong personalities in the typefaces
    and expose them. It's more of an exercise for fun than for serious explorations
    of the relationships of the typefaces and different movements in type. As you
    suggested, Nick, it has more to do with the special meanings and associations
    that I attach to them than assigning a definite character to each one. \r\n\r\nI
    been doing more work on the whole concept of the project today and have decided
    to go in a different direction. The political thing was not working, it was just
    too forced. \r\n\r\n>You seem to assume somehow that all these typefaces exist
    in a peaceable kingdom.\r\n\r\nI think that's why the metaphor of a political
    system did seem like it would work. While they all do coexist, not all can peacefully
    work together. But again, I'm changing direction, so it's a mute point.\r\n\r\nAgain,
    sorry for the misunderstanding, I should've been more clear as to my objectives.
    It was just kind of a \"what if?\", just a trivial look at the possible characters
    (no pun intended) that make up our visual language. Thanks for the input, though!"

  body: "I think I see what you're getting at. And I have an idea.\r\n\r\nIt seems
    to me that typefaces are actors, and the texts they are used in are their roles.
    And just as certain actors are better suited for certain roles, so are certain
    typefaces better suited for certain projects. You wouldn't cast Harrison Ford
    in a musical, for example, just as you would not use Impact on a wedding invitation.\r\n\r\nTherein
    comes your analogy: Sometimes you get directors (designers) putting the wrong
    actors (typefaces) in the wrong roles, and it shows. Similarly, you get actors
    who want to defy their traditional roles for fear of becoming -- dare I say it?
    -- <em>typecast</em>, so they take on something different. Sometimes it works
    (Leslie Nielsen doing comedy after a career of playing tough guys), but usually
    it doesn't.\r\n\r\nThink about it. Times New Roman, for seemingly forever, performing
    newspaper copy -- important, dignified work, yet not very exciting ... compare
    to a Shakespearean actor who does <em>The Merchant of Venice</em> and <em>King
    Lear</em> so well. Or Cooper, always has a fun role, but never very many lines.
    (Is Comic Sans the bad comedian who thinks he's funny but everyone just groans
    instead?)\r\n\r\nGive it a whirl."

  body: "Wow, Michael, thank you. I'm so happy you, too, thought of that. That's actually
    the new direction (alluded to in my post above) that I'm going in. I just wanted
    to develop it further before mentioning it here, since my lack of development
    in my first post caused a bit of confusion. I think I'm going to present the different
    typefaces as members of an acting company, or actors that will be performing in
    a specific theatre during the upcoming year. That will provide the opportunity
    for me (as \"director\") to explain why I'm including the typefaces that I am,
    too\u2014it's not that I feel those are the best, or most notable typefaces (although
    some may be), but each has its own reason for inclusion in this project.\r\n\r\nAbout
    personalities, though. Although I agree with the fact that typefaces definitely
    do not have \"intrinsic personalities,\" I think it is worth noting that we all
    see <em>some</em> sort of personality in type. Why do we make the choices we do,
    when chosing a typeface? Why is one more appropriate than another? It all comes
    down to the feelings one evokes more clearly than another. Johnston is \"friendlier\"
    than, say, Helvetica. Mrs Eaves is more \"feminine\" than, for example, Eurostile.
    Obviously, that is not the only thing that makes one typeface a better choice
    than the next, nor is it the only way to explain it, but it is definitely one
    thing (of many) I think of when making type decisions."
