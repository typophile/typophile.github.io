    but I may be wrong. If that is so, ITC Founders Caslon will get you a good antique
    look. I think the late Justin Howe did smaller sizes, which a newspaper would
    have been printed in, but they''re not on the ITC site.  '

    Style' you'll be needing British Neoclassical type. You might want to consider
    Monotype Baskerville (c. 1754), drawn by John Baskerville, Birmingham or Monotype
    Bell (1788), designed by Richard Austin, London.\r\n\r\n\"Thought is a thread

    is true, if you're being period specific.\r\n\r\nmy experience when doing prop
    research, however, is that the things people use are actually a little older than
    the period in which they exist. for example: a household existing in the american
    fifties, if brand new and owned by a fairly affluent character, would have all
    atomic-age artifacts.\r\n\r\nbut for most folks, the reality would be a mixture
    of atomic age, streamline, and maybe some late deco and nouveau -- not to mention
    classic revival, which seemed to be everywhere in america at almost any point
    during the twentieth century. there would also be a tatse of whateevr the local
    vernacular happened to be.\r\n\r\ni don't know if that would hold true to a period
    as far back as the 18th century since economics moved at such a different pace.\r\n\r\nyours

    very much for your swift replies. Baskerville looks like a good choice. I found
    some examples, it's the body text and smaller headings that I'm interested in,
    rather than mastheads."

    quote http://www.graphic-design.com/Type/typography.html:\r\n \r\n1725 - William
    Caslon the first British type standard\r\nWilliam spent his youth as an apprentice,
    journeyman and master in metal tooling. His specialty was gun-barrel engraving.
    During the early 1700s his concern grew to notariety and he became quite well
    known. He went on to found his own type foundry by developing his own variation
    of Garamond's classic type styles. His \"Caslon\" became so popular that in 1730
    it was adopted by British newspapers to become a standard. It was used for the
    printing of the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution of the United
    States. Today Caslon is considered one of the most beautiful of the Old Style
    families for its openness and its delicate yet uniform serifs."

    is a bit light, but otherwise much closer to the original, if you are trying to
    be close to the historical look.   '
