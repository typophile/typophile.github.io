body: It's a cursive font that's on my French textbook (first two pics) that I've
  seen used in many other applications. That's a tea from President's Choice, one
  of their more image-focused products. I've also seen it used on TV for fade-facades
  on shows as subliminal text.

  body: thanks.. finally took that off my head, it was bugging me for awhile. too
    bad it's a commercial font. I had no ideas fonts could be copyrighted commercially
    to be sold for a profit (well I did, but I figured most of them were scams). If
    they aren't recognized by the gov't as intellectual property, then why are they
    not being distributed freely but rather sold?

    when can the government be trusted to be <em>right?</em> :^D\r\n\r\n> <em>I had
    no ideas fonts could be copyrighted commercially to be sold for a profit (...).</em>\r\n\r\nWhy
    not? Designing a typeface is an artistic activity, just like composing music,
    painting or making a film. Why should it have any less rights than the others
    to be sold for profit? Type designers spend countless hours of hard work and a
    vast amount of skill and creativity in designing and producing a good working
    typeface. I can imagine they want to get paid for that.\r\n\r\nLife for a type
    designer is not free, contrary to popular belief. It's not like they haven't got
    bills to pay. \"Oh, you're a type designer? That's all right, you don't have to
    pay your mortgage.\" \"You say you're a type designer? No prob, the groceries
    are for free.\" \"Type designer, huh? Fill up your car, no need to pay.\""

    free (against the artist's will)? they can't lawfully be charged, so they can
    get away with it..

  body: "I always thought fonts (and most software) were subject to use under their
    EULA. Since you do not actually buy the font itself, only a licence to use it,
    you must use it according to that licence. In most cases, that involves not distributing
    the fonts for free.\r\n\r\nBut you're right, there's nothing to stop you from
    doing it, just like there's nothing to stop you from slipping a candy bar into
    your pocket at the grocery store (to use a tired analogy). A lot of crimes are
    hard to enforce because they are very hard to detect. That doesn't mean they should
    be committed.\r\n\r\n - Lex"

    I think if the words politics or politician are used you need to forgo giving
    any of them too much credit. ;^)

  body: ">they can\u2019t lawfully be charged\r\n\r\nYes they can, at least in civil
    court. In Adobe vs SII, this was done successfully. Also a publisher recently
    had to pay tens of thousands of dollars for using pirated fonts. And there are
    other cases. Do you expect type designers--or anybody else--to work for nothing?
    How are they going to eat?\r\n\r\n>fake democracies\r\n\r\nYves, what is fake
    about US democracy? \r\n\r\nAdmittedly, the legislative process in the U.S. is
    to a degree corrupted by money. However, when voters are fed up with people or
    policies they do make their voices heard. This past election changed both houses
    of congress. So to me American democracy looks flawed, but not fake.\r\n\r\nYou
    may not like the choices that the American public makes--and I often don't--but
    that is a different matter from democracy. "

  body: "Personally, I wouldn't call Democrats right wing because they support the
    welfare state--now often called the 'safety net'. \r\n\r\nNader represented a
    more left-wing approach in his run as leader of the Green Party in the 2000 election.
    However, he received a less than 3% vote. Not enough to make him a factor for
    federal funds for the next election--his goal--but enough to elect George W. Bush
    over Albert Gore.\r\n\r\nThere is definitely a left wing within the Democratic
    party. In order to understand US politics, you need to understand that it is not
    a proportional representation system. The parties tend to have a much broader
    range of views within them, and the compromises on policy take place within a
    party, rather than by coalition of parties. \r\n\r\nThat being said, it is true
    that the US has never had a large socialist movement or party. \r\n\r\nIn my view
    the results of this difference, internally, have been policies in the past 50
    years that have been in some respects better than Europe--leading to a more dynamic
    economy--and in some respects worse, in failing to implement a key feature of
    the welfare state, namely health security for all citizens. \r\n\r\nAfter the
    voting rights act of 1965, which empowered the African American vote, the South
    turned against the Democratic party. As a result, Republicans have been in the
    majority more often than not ever since. With the steadily increasing number of
    new immigrants (over 10% of US citizens are foreign born) this may change. My
    hope is that this past election represents the beginning of a new era, but time
    will tell.  "
