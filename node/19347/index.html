<div class=commentbody>this is a piese of sticker made of ordinary print paper,
and i got this, when i enter to night-club, from a chashier.
then, i ask to one of the staff of the club who made this sticker.
but i couldn't get any promising information...
sorry. it's pretty disturbing because its actual size is too small
to look at each letters.
thank you.</div>

<div class=commentbody>It's as if a border was added to each letter. Or could someone have meant to close of the lower part of the S like that?
I have posted it to a couple other forums for you. I'd like to know what this is myself.
I wish I had a catalog of Dan Solo fonts, because that seems like a good place to look for something like this.</div>

i thank you very much!!ヾ(･ω･)ﾉ
i just picked up an another image.
this is a sticker of the same material, but, not for a visitor gets, a performer gets it. I got it from a friend last night!
how I think that it is the totally same face.
we still can see the border on S, can't we?

<div class=commentbody>So far no comment on 3 other forums, so this seems harder than it appeared.
I'm curious, do you mind if I ask what you plan to do with this? You aren't going to start faking back-stage passes are you? If so, people might work harder on this ID if you promise to let us know how it works out for you.

<div class=commentbody>no~~!! i'm NOT gonna start faking it!
i just wanna know the font ID simply.
i'm designing for flyer of night club party.
it is like my big hobby.
instead of designing free, i get admission free.
i'm just a party girl... (´∀｀)ノ
anyway
a few months ago, a client(?) requasted me to design using this MUSIC ESSENCE font and
bought this sticker.
at that time, i told him that i don't have this font. and i used one of the most similer in my font list.
then, the fiyer-making was finished without any problems.
actual problem is that...
i've been having the unknowned ID font in my mind since i got the sample sticker.
this font is too cool and lovely to get off my mind.
i don't have any plan with this font.
i just wanna know its ID...

<div class=commentbody>I'm betting the key to this one lies in some old Dan Solo CD, but I don't have any of those. I checked the ones for sale I could find online with no luck. I did see something with a similar feel at Nick's Fonts, and I saw that a Dan Solo font was the inspiration. But between this and the other places are some of the sharpest ID-ers there are, but no luck. I haven't seen Mike Bowfin lately, so keep checking back.
I have looked so much the C, E, S, and K/Rs are etched in my mind.

<div class=commentbody>I looked twice through my copy of The Solotype Catalog. I can't say that it looks familiar, either. The weird thing is that it <em>looks</em> like something from the early '70s.</div>
