    Roman.</a>\r\n\r\nor <a href=\"http://www.identifont.com/show?1VI\">Carlton</a>"

  body: "I have an old type specimen catalog of this period from the Nebiolo foundry,
    Torino. This is a Romanian knockoff of their Radio series which was available
    in chiara, corsiva, corsiva nera, nera, litografica styles. This looks quite like
    Radio Nera (black) to me. Hard to forget that lowercase t. The chiara and corsiva
    companion are quite nice. The Romanian seems to differ only in that the bowls
    of the uppercase are slightly condensed and thus range a bit higher throughout.\r\n\r\nGerald

    send me (when you have time) the scanned page from that catalog. I like this font
    very much. \r\nOr you could post it somewhere I can see.\r\n\r\nThanks again."

  body: "I hate to subject that fairly fragile yet bulky specimen book to the back
    breaking scanner (the binding is a bit iffy the way it is, and it was an expensive
    purchase) but I'll give it a try. I've got a blog where I will put it up (temporarily)
    in the next day or so. I don't recall that there are full character sets though.\r\n\r\nhttp://TypeRoad.blogspot.com\r\n\r\nI
    also noticed, belatedly, that the Romanians had caned the lowercase f. A bit odd.
    It certainly funks it up a bit. Wonder if that was just a nationalistic thing.\r\n\r\n\r\nGerald"

    the font. I saved the scans from your blog, you can take them down now.\r\nDon't
    know the history of this font in Romania ... why they modified the f. The book
    I have is the only place I've seen this font."
