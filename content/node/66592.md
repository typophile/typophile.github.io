  body: This is actually (mostly) due to the sIFR Flash thing that formats the headings
    in a custom font. It doesn't seem to be able to handle anything outside simple
    ASCII. The fact that often when you post something (including topic titles) some
    auto-formatting takes place, converting dumb quotes to smart quotes and so forth,
    which sIFR can't properly display. I don't think this is inherent to the way sIFR
    works. Maybe it is.

    an em-dash etc., and also offer a decent language support.\r\n\r\nHowever \u2013
    IIRC \u2013, Typophile uses something different than sIFR (see <a href=\"http://typophile.com/node/35077#comment-213098\">Christian

  body: "The script errantly converts high-order characters to entities, then (again
    errantly) deletes leading ampersand (also number sign, if hex \u2013 I can\u2019t
    tell) and trailing semicolon. It then renders the remaining numbers."
