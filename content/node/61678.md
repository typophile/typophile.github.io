body: "[img:sites/default/files/old-images/30284b_5200.jpg]\r\n\r\nA while back, I
  released a free font call Zandvoort that featured numbers 0-99 in circles. I created
  the font mainly for diagrams I was working on at  work. There were several other
  fonts available that did similar things, but either the numbers were too stylized
  or the way the font was setup was cumbersome.\r\n\r\nSince then, I redrew all the
  numbers (with some good tips from fellow typophilers), added uppercase letters,
  and put everything in squares as well as circles. The result is a family of fonts
  called Fyra. There are eight styles available, and you can download one (Fyra-Numeric
  Circle Closed) for free.\r\n\r\nCheck it out here:\r\n\r\nhttp://new.myfonts.com/fonts/jonathan-hughes/fyra/\r\n\r\n\r\nJonathan"
