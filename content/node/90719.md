  bruce's Son & Co - 1882\r\n\r\nDo you know where I can buy it online?\r\nOr do you
  know any specialized bookshop that I can contact?\r\n\r\nSo far, I've just found
  Abebooks.com for buying first editions.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nVincent\r\n"

  body: "The French foundry I can't comment on; never seen it offered.\r\n\r\nThe
    ATF 1897 or 1912 -- watch eBay. The older ones come up about once every 12-18
    months.\r\n\r\nGeorge Bruce's Son & Co., 1882 -- not much chance of seeing that
    except rarely, usually at auction. Then you should be prepared to pay a hefty
    price for it.\r\n\r\nCheck Oak Knoll Books and The Veatches Arts of the Book;
    they usually have some specimen books for sale. You can find them through Google
    since they're both well known firms.\r\n\r\nYou might also approach a known specimen
    book collector to ask if they have duplicates.\r\n"

  body: 'I have a copy of the 1912 ATF catalog, numbered A3247, in better-than-average
    shape for a one-hundred-year-old book. One caveat: mailing it to France could
    in itself cost a tidy sum, since the book weighs over 5 kilos. Reasonable offers
    will be entertained, if you''re interested.'

  body: "Thanks a lot for your help!\r\n\r\nMajus, you're right: ebay is the best
    place, and I found a a ATF 1912 at 215$, not bad.\r\nLook forward to catch a 1897
    :-)\r\n\r\nGeorge bruce is untouchable, saw one at 17000$ !\r\n(and I guess that
    the french market was smaller than the american one, it should be so rare...)\r\n\r\nThe
    Veatches Arts of the Book is a excellent Book shop: found a Barnhart & Spindler
    at 150$ (year 1900).\r\n\r\nOldNick, your offer is super nice, thanks a lot :-)\r\nAs
    I got already the ATF 1912, no need to send it to me.\r\nBy the way, delive rin
    France is not that expensive, 50$ in priority box with USPS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\nVincent\r\n"
