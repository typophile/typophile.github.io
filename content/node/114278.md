  I'm not sure if the distressed look is inherent to the font design or an effect
  of stamping. On the same note, I'm not sure whether the character alignment is irregular
  or whether the letters have been stamped individually.\r\nAny help is very much
  appreciated.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/seventy_4864.jpg]"
