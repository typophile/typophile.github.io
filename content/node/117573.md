  body: "Linotype has a nice feature article about football jersey typefaces:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.linotype.com/2710/footballjerseyfonts.html\r\n\r\nHowever,
    they display a Paraguay jersey that uses the exact same typeface and the closest
    match they can suggest is \"Russell Square,\" which is similar, but only vaguely.
    I tried a \"What the Font\" search on myfonts.com and searched by letter characteristics
    on identifont.com, but came up empty.\r\n\r\nThe shirt you reference is from the
    2007-2008 season for AEK Athens, and appears to have been created by Puma. The
    typeface may be custom to the company, and not commercially available."
