  body: "Hi,\r\nDid you try to convert it on Fontforge? \r\nIn Fontforge you can export
    single path font (if I well remember you can choose it in font info). But then
    you can it just in illustrator.\r\nTo use in other way, you have to create parallel
    path in Fontlab or other.  \r\n\r\nIn Autocad, you have also this kind of single
    path font.\r\nYou can also find [[http://www.mrrace.com/CamBam_Fonts/| free CamBan
    ]] font on the web.\r\n\r\nGood luck.\r\nLet us know if you find a way export
    these fonts.\r\nSD\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Tried Fontforge. It did not see the pdf.\r\nIllustrator can extract outlines
    using the lasso tool and placing in a new file. Here is _G_ from the engraver's
    script pdf with scale transformed 4400%\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/EngravingScriptXpdf_G_5950.jpg]\r\nI
    note that this consists of straight lines.\r\nThe eps successfully pasted into
    Fontlab but the outline is repeated. You have to get rid of one of them before
    you can make a font.\r\nDon\r\n"

  body: "Thanks for the replies.\r\n\r\n@ryuk Helevtica Neue looks it is it! Thanks
    can you name and shame the other two?\r\n\r\n@ s.degeilh i am not sure what i
    can do with cambam? Fontforge won't open .chr files, so i can't convert them to
    ttf.\r\n\r\n@donshottype  i will post a new pdf without the outline, can you do
    something with that?\r\n\r\nThanks guys, i have got 20 more fonts, should i post
    them one by one or all together? I am new to this so please help me out. :-)\r\n\r\nTunes "

  body: "Hello Teunis,\r\n\r\nhave you found a way to convert chr into ttf yet? I'm
    having a similar problem at the moment. The font you posted above looks like \"Vanessa\"
    font to me, a typical engraving font for gravograph machines. You can find gravograph
    fonts here: http://fonts.gravostore.com/.\r\nI would appreciate, in case you know
    how to convert chr to ttf, if you could let me know, thanks.\r\n\r\nKind regards,\r\nKatja"
