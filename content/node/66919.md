  body: "I like very much this typeface since it was released as Quadratta. Its horizontal
    colour and the gliphs design are very readable. Hope you could improve even more
    the family with a bold italic style in a near future.\r\n\r\nI think the upper
    C-cedilla has the diacritic positioned too much to left. The ligatures for ll
    and ch are very interesting. Do you know if is there some historical usage of
    these ligatures in Spanish? In Portuguese the ch is common but I never saw a ligature
    for it.\r\n\r\n(I'd like to write in Spanish as you are from Uruguay and I live
    very near, in Porto Alegre, but preferred to use English due to other users.)\r\n"

  body: "Hi Freiberger!\r\n\r\nThanxs for the feedback!\r\nI'll take a look to the
    C-cedilla :)\r\nThere are many posts about \"ll\" and \"ch\" here,\r\nwhen I first
    did Quadratta I did some reaserch, \r\nthere are a lot of material about \"ch\"
    but not too \r\nmuch about \"ll\".\r\n\r\nhttp://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ch\r\nhttp://www.typophile.com/node/43879\r\nhttp://www.typophile.com/node/19376\r\netc...\r\n\r\nRegards!

  body: "Thanks for the links! Although I admire typography since many years, I did
    begun to design my first typeface just now and I wasn't aware of all these comments
    on d\xEDgrafos.\r\n\r\nA Qu/qu ligature is really interesting, although it must
    work much better in Qu than qu.\r\n\r\nDo you plan to release a bold italic of
    Quiroga?\r\n"
