body: "<strong>[[Indices]] : [[Terminology]] : Squoosh</strong>\r\n\r\nv. transative.
  A term used to describe type that has been horizontally or vertically stretched
  or condensed using graphic design software. Glyph scaling in this manner is almost
  always inadvisable and is often a sure sign of amateur typography. Space is best
  saved by reducing the type size or using a condensed (or extended) version of the
  font professionally drawn by a type designer.\r\n\r\n\u201CSquooshed\u2122\u201D

  a way to train the eye, we suggest that designers (and customers) take their own
  photo and distort it along with the font. When the distortions become visible on
  the face, it\u2019s time you stop disfiguring the font.\""
