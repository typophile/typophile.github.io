  body: Well crap Alex, I bought that program after you refered me to it the last
    time and tried using it to identify this font but it didn't find it by doing a
    web search or scanning my fonts and I have like 50,000 fonts.  Maybe I'm not doing
    something right.  Thanks for identifying it for me though!  I appreciate it!
