body: "I'm looking for a simple API or font-project-format or just font-format allowing
  to generate a font (font project) from my own program code with maximum ease.\r\n\r\nThe
  properties I'd like to set for each glyph are:\r\n- vector curves (eps/ai/svg/bitmap)\r\n-
  width/height\r\n- baseline\r\n\r\nThe other properties could be tweaked manually
  in a font editor.\r\n\r\nThus it should be either an open and friendly file format
  or well documented API.\r\n\r\nPlease let me know if you know such a solution. Thanks."
