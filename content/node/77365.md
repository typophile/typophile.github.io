  body: "just noticed the extreme difference in the descender of the /g/, /j/ and
    /p/, /q/, /y/\r\nfixed now, not updated.\r\n\r\ndo you think the /c/ and /s/ need
    serifs?"

  body: "bump.\r\nI added a meager contrast to the forms for a less formal appeal.\r\nAlso
    sloped the serifs away from something too angular and distant.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/test3_3799.jpg]\r\n\r\nthoughts?"

  body: the s feels a bit top-heavy to me. You may also want to consider increasing
    the size of the dot on the i and j. They will probably start to get lost at smaller
    point sizes.

  body: I like it. The new version is more distinguished. But this kind of thin contrast
    is tricky (see s, for example).

    - too dark/thick a bit\r\nj - descender could be smoother\r\nr - arm could be
    thinner near the stem\r\ns - needs some work\r\nI like it too :)"

  body: "the /o/ is very black compared to the weight of the /n/\r\nthe /s/ /r/ and
    /e/ will be easy fixes.\r\nI'll work on the /j/ and post updates.\r\n\r\nI've
    made sketches for the uppercase and have a lot more decisions to make.\r\n\r\nthanks
    for all the help."
