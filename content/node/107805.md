body: "I\u2019m trying to pick out a font that supports Vietnamese. I can\u2019t seem
  to figure out a way for Windows to tell me which fonts on my system do, and I can\u2019t
  even find a place on Adobe\u2019s website that lists which of theirs do. The best
  I\u2019ve been able to figure out is entering \u201Cg\u1ECFi cu\u1ED1n\u201D as
  the sample text in NexusFont and scrolling through a list of all my installed fonts
  to see which ones don\u2019t look funny.\r\n\r\nSurely there\u2019s a better way?"

    characters like \u1ED1, and go to the Font Variation pane, where I would see how
    this looks in each of the fonts on the system.  I guess that is about the same
    as what you are doing on Windows, and I don't know of any other way..."

    option in Office.

  body: "Try the MyFonts advanced search [[http://www.myfonts.com/search/charset%3Aviet/fonts/|using
    Vietnamese as criteria]]. To get reliable results, chose \"Enter your own text\"
    in Sample text drop down menu and enter some Vietnamese characters, as \u1EB3\u1EA7\u1EA5\u1EAB\u1EA9\u1EB1\u1EAF\u1EB5\u0111\u1EC3\u01A1\u01B0.\r\n\r\nAnother
    idea is to take a look on [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Font_management_software#List_of_font_management_software|font
    management applications]]. Maybe some of them could search your fonts by language
    support.\r\n\r\nThere is a recent font named Cadao which is focused on Vietnamese
    support. I am not sure if it was already released. In a near future, [[http://typophile.com/node/67787|this
    project]] will be available with full Vietnamese support, besides a sans serif
    companion."
