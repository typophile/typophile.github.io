  Condensed (see attatched), \r\nbut a distressed version. Anyone have any suggestions?\r\n\r\nOnes
  I am finding look a little tacky and cheap.\r\n\r\nNeed to be bold and be as close
  to 97 Black Condensed as possible[img:sites/default/files/old-images/TYPEFACE_3424.jpg]\r\n\r\n\r\nThanks
  in advance\r\n\r\nChris"

    interested.\r\nif you do chose that path, remember that the image has to be correct
    in ps, once the file is created you shouldn't scale it."
