    by Helmut Matheis. Notice the 'g' in particular. This isn't the same font, but
    I wonder if it could be his lettering.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: "I agree, Slogan is your best bet.\r\nThe extra loop in the \u2018g\u2019
    is not necessarily a signature style of Matheis, but a relic of German Kurrentschrift,
    see <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/ninastoessinger/4184236243/\">this
    lettering chart on Nina\u2019s Flickr pages</a>. So is the stemless \u2018d\u2019."

    of the early 16th century?

  body: "Of course! This form of \u2018d\u2019 is not unique to Kurrent; for example,
    it can also be found in the French Ronde and typefaces inspired by it, like <a
    href=\"http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/gando/?refby=mfde\">Gando</a>, <a
    href=\"http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/agfa/fling/?refby=mfde\">Fling</a>, or even
    <a href=\"http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/adobe/cochin/?refby=mfde\">Cochin Italic</a>.
    For 1940\u2019s Germany, Kurrentschrift is just a much more obvious source of
    influence."
