  body: "I recognize what has happened to it.  It was scanned and run through a poor
    auto-trace program with lousy settings. This used to be done on purpose to get
    a \"distressed\" effect.  Try stepping back and just identify the face.  Then
    you can try a really poor autotrace\r\nof the font after scanning to tif format."

  body: I have just recalled that sometimes type images were run through an auto-trace
    program more than once.  Sometimes after being angled. All of this was to get
    a really degenerative effect of great distress.  Often it would become unrecognizable.  Ugh.
