  talking about the miscellaneous ones.\r\n\r\nIs it Windows 7 fonts? Is it Chrome
  rendering? Is it some configuration I should tweak? Any help is welcome!\r\nI've
  just checked that UTF-8 was selected in Chrome codification, and it was. Strangly
  I can see more symbols in IE 11 (!)"

  body: You can only see what is in your fonts, and no os comes with fonts for everything
    in unicode.  If you give specifics, someone could tell what font you need.  Utf
    is irrelevant.

  body: "Some software may be better than others at finding fallback fonts to supplement
    the empty slots in your main fonts. I have noticed this happening on rare but
    frequent enough occasions where a startlingly different font appears where there
    is a recently introduced glyph, like capital sharp S or one of the newer currency
    symbols that many common fonts haven't yet been updated to support.\r\n\r\nIf
    you don't have any installed fonts with those characters, they won't show up.
    If you do have at least one such font installed, your software may make the substitution
    automatically, or you might have to make a settings adjustment."
