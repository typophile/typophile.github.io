    target="_blank"> a whole thread about striped typefaces</a>, though I  <BR>don&#39;t
    think there&#39;s an exact match amongst the suggestions  <BR>made. Have a look
    there and come back to us if you need  <BR>more information.

  body: No, they didn&#39;t really match. Almost all striped typefaces I have seen
    are roundish, like lc &#34;a&#34;. What I look for is the strictness in this one,
    more like an striped futura.  <BR> <BR>/f

    other font, or maybe a photo type thing. Either way <BR>they have the same source
    design. Nice find, Jan.
