<p>I&rsquo;ve never liked the kind of comparative ad that shows the wrong product choice, without having the guts to go head to head with a competitor. It seems counterproductive to devote most of an advertisement to a screw-up, and then attach one&rsquo;s brand to it.</p>
<p>Usually Stupid Dad is mocked, but here the object of scorn is rocking grandmas. Sexist and ageist.</p>
<p>Typographically, the error is compounded with what appears to be a selection from 1001 Free Fonts.</p>
<p>The only fonts that should appear in an advertisement are the corporate fonts, anything else corrupts the identity.</p>
<p>Telus has recently made the same mistake, after an awesome 15-year run of pure Helvetica 25 and 35, with this:

<p>That&rsquo;s a very old-fashioned approach to brand standards. Something I have been wondering lately is if using the same identity forever just leads people to take it for granted and not notice it. For example, I can&rsquo;t even remember the last time I saw any promotions for American Airlines because the brand standards have been the same for almost fifty years. Everything AA does just blends into my environment. I don&rsquo;t see the Coke logo much, either. Logos and type standards may have worked well in the twentieth century but I think we are moving into a world where brand standards are less important than meaningful customer interaction.</p>
<p>That said, a halfassed grannies-with-guitars gimmick is not even close to meaningful customer interaction!</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s a different argument. Sure, perfectly good designs wear out.
I&rsquo;m not advocating never updating, merely adhering to whatever the brand identity is at any given point in time.
Also, some brands may incorporate a multiplicity of type styles, if the varied styles are associated with distinctly branded products. But that isn&rsquo;t the case with Network Solutions, because they are not presenting the non-granny product, whatever it is, as such.</p>
<p>Black Knight is &ldquo;my&rdquo; brand, so I have their racquets and bag. But I&rsquo;m kind of confused at the moment, as they are mixing a techno look with their longstanding Cooper Black Italic:

<p>At least Telus has remained true to their legacy high quality television advertisements.  It&rsquo;s a shame that their paper and internet advertisements have slowly deteriorating.</p>

<p>I could be taking this completely out of its proper context, but are you implying that it is far better when companies bash other companies in advertisements?  If not, disregard this next part.
I am just curious if that is the manner you meant it in because I always found when companies do that, it makes their advertisements weaker.  My choice example is Pepsi, most of their commercials are them bashing Coke and frankly it&rsquo;s quite unprofessional and ineffective when they do so.</p>

<p>Comparative advertising can be done well.
In business-to-business, it&rsquo;s quite legitimate to compare one&rsquo;s product features and benefits with that of a competitor
