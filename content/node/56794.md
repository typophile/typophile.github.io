  do to frustration. And maybe I should just move on, but I thought I'd give this
  community one more try... maybe some fresh eyes would help save it.\r\n\r\nAny ways,
  it's an ambigram of my last name MELO. I'd hoped to use it as a personal logo but
  I don't feel it's complete or attractive enough at this point.\r\n\r\nAny suggestions
  and/or feedback would be much appreciated. "

  body: "Oh wow, it's so refreshing to see this done differently. I've always thought
    the LO together would look like a W but you pulled it off... I'm definitely going
    to work on it in this direction.\r\n\r\nThank you so much. Finally inspired to
    work on this again!"

- body: "\r\nI'm with Ratbaggy. I've never understood the appeal of ambigrams. The
    truth is, the only people that \"get it\" are the designer and other designers.
    Unless the ambigram is appearing alone on products (like skateboards, or toys)
    an ambigram serves little purpose."

  body: Yeah, you're all probably right. Just something I wanted to finish though.
    Back to the drawing board in regards to my personal logo.
