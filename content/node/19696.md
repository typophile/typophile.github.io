body: "I'm working with an AI file I downloaded off the Adobe Exchange Server, it's
  a map of the United States. Very accurate with every state individually outlined,
  but as I work I'm noticing a few of the states don't have a continuous outline stroke.
  Because of the intricate nature of the state's shapes there are easily a thousand
  points used to create this outline stroke. That's a thousand points a state (give
  or take a few hundred).\r\n\r\nIs there a way that I can automatically highlight
  the beginning and end of a continuous line segment to make it easy to see where
  the breaks are in hopes of completing the path?  \r\n\r\n"

    it's selected and all the blue are the individual anchor points. Somewhere along
    this shape there's a gap, I need to find it to complete the shape. \r\n\r\nIs
    there a way to have the beginning and end points of a continuous path highlighted?

  body: You could hide the guides and colorize the stroke instead of the fill. Perhaps
    that would show you.

  body: "Do as Miss Tiffany says and put a coloured stroke on the outline, then make
    sure that the rounded ends option is selected in the stroke panel. If you make
    the stroke weight thicker it should show up where the gap is (You may need to
    make it quite thick).\r\n\r\nHope this works - haven't tested it in practise."

    I would try Object-Path-Simplify\r\n\r\nThis is obviously an autotracing that
    is far more complicated than it needs to be. At a certain point a RIP is not going
    to want to process this many points. \r\n\r\nBest of Luck!\r\n\r\npeace"

  body: "Ignore the above, this is easier...\r\n\r\njust apply a brush style from
    the arrows selection. The start and end points will become obvious as they'll
    be at the head and tail of the arrow . Remember where the gap is and remove the
    brush style using the appearance palette before joining the gap. "

    the culprit. I had completely forgotten about the join command...

    work equally for two paths?\r\nWhat I mean is \u2013 if you had two states that
    shared a border (which, presumably, would be the identical path for each) and
    you apply Object-Path-Simplify would the border still be the identical path or
    would the number of other points in each state affect the simplifying?\r\nTim"

  body: "I didn't think to do a stroked brush application, that's a brilliant idea.
    \r\n\r\nAs far as anchor points go, you're probably right to say it was an autotraced
    image, but in CS2 there isn't a limit on the ammount of anchor points you can
    have in a continuous segment. I haven't gone thru a rip for printing (just direct
    network to the printer.) but I don't think there would be a problem anymore. \r\n\r\nI
    appreciate all the ideas. I knew this collective braintrust would come up with
    a solution in a little time!\r\n\r\noh, and <em>Then if I were you I would try
    Object-Path-Simplify\r\n</em> doesn't really work well..."

  body: "There wasn't a limit before on points either, causing endless headaches for
    prepress folks receiving files that wouldn't RIP, for example people turning selections
    into paths in Photoshop. A laser printer will print just about anything but then
    you throw it at a postcript RIP and things get serious.\r\n\r\nHave not tried
    simplify on two very complex objects sharing a segment. Of course they can't be
    truly sharing it unless it's a compound path.\r\n\r\nSimplify works really well
    sometimes, depending on the path\u2026\r\n\r\nc'est la vie\r\n\r\npeace"
