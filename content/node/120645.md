body: "I\u2019m designing my portfolio website and am thinking that I should brand
  myself with a combination of two typefaces. I fervently love Sabon and will be using
  Porchez\u2019s Sabon Next, but now I\u2019m in the struggle to find another typeface
  to pair it.\r\n\r\nI have thought of only using Sabon itself, but that would look
  too antique and delicate \u2013 a sense, although beautiful, not appropriate for
  the mood I want to achieve. I do want it to look modern and neat, but not the kind
  of \xFCber-sanitized cleanness that you see in Swiss designs (yeah just go away,
  Helvetica). I would very much appreciate some contrast in both typefaces\u2019 personalities
  (i.e. one tender and one powerful, one contemplative and one welcoming, etc.) It
  seems that humanist sans may be a good way to achieve, but I\u2019ve already tried
  Myriad (regular 18 as title with Sabon 14 as body, in my browser reader) and it
  doesn\u2019t work well.\r\n\r\nOf course I know that I can just find a whatever-neogrotesk
  to pair, but I don\u2019t want to just stop at that point. I am also thinking if
  I can find another serif to pair, but I really have no experience at all with how
  to pair two serif faces.\r\n\r\nAny suggestions?"

  body: "A few humanist sans that might work: Scala Sans (Martin Majoor), Calluna
    Sans (exljbris), Cronos (Robert Slimbach) (but this might have a bit too much
    personality of its own). You could also go with something like Futura for greater
    contrast. Something grotesquey like Shinn's Figgins might be a possibility. Be
    wary of pairing two serifs. Unless they are very different, this often doesn't
    work \u2014 and if they're too different, it can also not work. You'll want to
    find two faces that speak a similar idiom but where one is an exaggerated form
    of the other \u2014 like Century Schoolbook and Clarendon. Problem is there's
    not really such a thing as an exaggeration of Sabon, which is a muted version
    of Garamond. You could try Sabon for text and a more refined Garamond for display,
    but the sizes would need to be very different."

      the same author\u2019s creation so I came across Porchez\u2019s Parisine. But
      too bad it\u2019s hosted on different webfont services than Sabon Next, and
      I cannot afford buying individual licenses."
