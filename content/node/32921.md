  body: "Gerry and Klimis walk into a bar in Warsaw. The bartender speaks to Gerry
    in Polish. Gerry promptly orders drinks and dinner in perfectly spoken Polish.
    Klimis, looking awed and impressed at Gerry,  says, \"How do you understand Polish
    so well?\" Gerry replies, \"It's all Greek to me!\" :-P\r\n\r\nChrisL"
