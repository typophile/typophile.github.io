body: I need to buy Gotham Book for a particular job that requires it, and I'm tempted
  to buy it in an assortment of other weights too for future use.  I know it's trendy
  now, but do you think I'll get a lot of use out of  it long-term?  Any thoughts
  on Gotham would be appreciated.

    meanwhile, but still a safe bet. Hard to do anything completely off with HFJ fonts."

  body: The condensed weights look *very* nice and perhaps less familiar than the
    regular.

  body: Interesting enough, I am on a project and I use Gotham... Has anyone mixed
    Gotham with other typefaces? Care to share experience on "What goes well" with
    Gotham?

  body: "Hoefler & Frere-Jones recommend Gotham together with Mercury, Numbers, Whitney
    and Didot. I like the last idea. Gotham and Didot. But perhaps that\u2019s just
    since I am such a sucker for Didot."
