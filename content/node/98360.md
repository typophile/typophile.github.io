body: I'd like to find and purchase this font used in a British Airways ad. I like
  the small swish at the top and bottom of the upright characters.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/BA_ad_5642.jpg]

  body: Until a few months ago, the NY Times Electronic Edition included T Magazine.
    Since one could download pdf's, it was relatively easy to see what fonts were
    in use. However, for some reason, T Magazine is no longer included in the Electronic
    Edition.  Otherwise, I'd be glad to try and answer your query! (Unless BA posted
    their ad as a raster image, that is).
