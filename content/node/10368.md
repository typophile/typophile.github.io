body: What is the rule for hanging punct? Is it always in justified text? I tried
  reading some of the archives, but they don&#39;t mention a rule, rather an instance.
  <BR>Thanks.

  body: Gil <BR> <BR>I doubt if you will find &#34;a rule&#34; in regard to hanging
    punctuation prior to the digital era. It was more often used as an optical adjustment
    and not often applied consistently, in either manuscript work or in the work of
    the early printers. <BR> <BR>And, unfortunately, even though page-layout programs
    like InDesign provide for it, it really does need to be adjusted per differing
    punctuation instance and on a per face basis, which they do not provide for. You
    can obviously adjust it manually, but we live in a world of &#34;button pushing,&#34;
    and manual adjustments, bit of an absurdity, huh?

  body: Gerald, could you explain on what principles you think the hanging punctuation
    should be adjusted with different punction and different faces? You can globally
    adjust the spacing of hanging punctuation in InDesign using the &#39;font size&#39;
    specification.

  body: '1. The only known rule for how to use hanging punctuation is good taste.
    <BR> <BR>2. My personal rule is, if you can notice it, you&#39;ve gone too far.
    That rules out the default settings for InDesign, which push emdashes so far out
    into the margin that they look a piece of hair you accidentally shed onto your
    old-fashioned mechanical. Right gives me the creeps! <BR> <BR>It&#39;s easy to
    see why Adobe did this: if you can&#39;t see it, you don&#39;t know you have a
    feature, and if you don&#39;t have a feature, why would you buy the program to
    start with? So it&#39;s way overdone. The feature needs to be rethought. In the
    meantime, the only way to get good results is still by careful attention to each
    line of text - for those with the time to do a job right. If you don&#39;t have
    the time to do this, you shouldn&#39;t be worrying about hanging punctuation.
    It can&#39;t be done well automatically, at least not with the software we presently
    have available.'

  body: William <BR> <BR>I think Bill has given pretty much the same response as I
    would have. Mechanical-based global adjustments won&#39;t get you to where you
    want to be. It&#39;s based on the eye &#40;and, as Bill points out, typographic
    good taste&#41;. The goal is to find settings that are visually correct. Invariably
    each glyph that is to be hung is going to require a specific adjustment. And then
    are adjustments for optical illusion. This is not something that can be spelled
    out but it can certainly be learned. <BR> <BR>But as Bill also pointed out, and
    as my old instructor used to admonish, &#34;if you don&#39;t have the time to
    do it correctly, when will you?&#34;

  body: 'The OpenType specification includes layout features for optical margins,
    which allow one to specify beginning and end of line alignment for any glyph in
    a font: a GPOS adjustment of left or right sidebearing. The attractiveness of
    this model is, of course, that hanging puctuation -- and other refinements of
    optical margins such as compensations for letters like A T V W -- can be dealt
    with in a design-specific way. The only downside is that it cannot be size-specific&#42;
    for scaled type &#40;although, obviously, could be for specific size masters&#41;.
    <BR> <BR>At present, this OTL feature is not supported in any apps, but would
    be a welcome addition. I suspect support is most like to appear from Microsoft&#39;s
    side. <BR> <BR>You can add support for this feature to fonts using VOLT, but the
    UI isn&#39;t really conducive to it because there is no way to view vertical relationship
    in the GPOS window or in the proofing tool. I&#39;ve discussed this with MS, but
    I&#39;m guessing that a dedicated little margin alignment applet capable of generating
    a VOLT lookup file might be the simplest short-term approach. <BR> <BR> <BR>&#42;Device-dependent
    adjustments are available for low resolutions, so there is some size-dependent
    support. This would be desirable for controlling the amount of hang on screen,
    where rounding errors may result in more or less hang than one might want at specific
    sizes.'

  body: 'back to the topic &#34;rule&#34;: <BR> <BR>I found &#34;hanging punctuation&#34;
    in the following books: <BR>James Felici, The complete Manual of Typography, 2003,
    p. 191 &#40;paragraph about &#34;Hanging Characters&#34;&#41; <BR> <BR>&#34;Hanging
    punctuation is ... used ... to give the right-hand edge of the text block a smoother
    appearance. Because punctuation characters ... are graphically weak, lines that
    end with them appear to be slightly indented ... By letting such characters hang
    out somewhat past the nominal margin of the column &#40;... the edge of the text
    frame&#41;, the margin looks straighter, as the characters that precede the punctuation
    come closer to setting flush right. <b>The idea is to find a happy medium in which
    the margin looks smoother but without the appearance of having whiskers, with
    all those hyphens hanging in space.</b>&#34; &#40;bold setting by me, ms&#41;
    <BR> <BR>A &#34;happy medium&#34; is a very fine term for what has to be achieved
    by the feature &#34;hanging punctuation&#34;. <BR> <BR>I remember to have read
    more times about that, but at the moment can&#39;t find. I think it was in german
    books too and have to translate. <BR> <BR>One with a detailed dicussion of benefits
    and the too-much of outdenting is: <BR> <BR>Friedrich Forssman / Ralf de Jong,
    Detailtypografie, Mainz 2002 &#40;but there is an improved 2nd print&#41;, p.
    116-119 <BR>Under the term &#34;Randausgleich&#34; &#40;they mean more balanced
    justification&#41; they discuss hanging punctuation or better well balanced justification
    in normal text size and display sizes.  <BR> <BR>Balanced justification also has
    to take account f j J in some fonts when they have wide horizontal strokes. &#40;Forssman/de
    Jonge discuss that as well&#41;. <BR> <BR>&#40;In Ventura you could even do this,
    just insert &#34;J&#34; in the list for hanging punctuation and specify the amount
    of outdenting&#41;. <BR> <BR>The different approach between InDesign and Ventura
    may result from different kind of work: <BR>Ventura has been used for setting
    large amounts of text and books, where a sophisticated hanging-punctuation-feature
    is essential if you want to achieve a justification/column of high quality &#40;or
    the &#34;invisible job&#34;&#41;. <BR>InDesigns first jobs weren&#39;t books,
    and for display setting the results of its feature maybe appropriate &#40;as I
    sometimes like the &#34;visible&#34; manner of its feature for emphasizing citations
    in quotes&#41;. <BR> <BR>But as InDesign &#40;for me&#41; is the very best application
    regarding typography - see it&#39;s far better justification, using open type
    features and so on, it would be great if its feature &#34;Optischer Randausgleich&#34;
    &#40;the german name of the &#34;hanging punctuation&#34;-feature in InDesign
    - I don&#39;t know the english term&#41; could get the functionality of Venturas
    hanging-punctuation/characters-tables.'

  body: This is a great summary which shows what Ventura could do if it had OT support.
    But you know, even without OT support, I think I might start using it? The only
    real advantage I can see in InDesign is multi-line justification, and since I
    am never going to set anything without spending a few moments to examine each
    line individually anyway, it really isn&#39;t a big deal for me. <BR> <BR>One
    thing I think worth pointing out is that it is a little presumptuous to speak
    of &#39;rules&#39; for hanging punctuation when there aren&#39;t any, and there
    has been so very little experience with it. When James Felici writes, using that
    terribly impressive passive voice, hanging punct IS, etc. he gives a very false
    impression. Hanging punct IS nothing at all. Hanging punct MAY BE or MIGHT BE
    or COULD BE. <BR> <BR>In other words, we have to treat hanging punct as what it
    really is, something quite new in typography, with which nobody has much experience,
    and to which we must apply a lot of common sense. Adobe has not done this, and
    has configured it in a manner which is not just unhelpful, but actually  harmful.
    If people once get the idea that there is something &#39;right&#39; or &#39;correct&#39;
    about the way InDesign does hanging punctuation, we are in real trouble. Fortunately,
    nobody really does seem to have that idea. What InDesign is doing with hanging
    punct actually does look wrong to people, hence this thread. I am very grateful
    to Michael for bringing Ventura back into the picture. I am just amazed that the
    Ventura team thought this feature through so carefully. Why aren&#39;t Quark and
    Adobe doing the same?
