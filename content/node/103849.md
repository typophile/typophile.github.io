  since then I've restructured my entire font library and I can't seem to recall which
  font I used here:\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/Zn311Dv.png\" />\r\n\r\nI
  know it was an opentype \"small caps\" set, so it's relatively modern. That gap-toothed
  N and the apostrophe should be enough, I hope.\r\n\r\nThanks"
