  Can anyone point me to a book/text/site, where this difference \u2014 or similarity

  body: 'From what I gather, sans were originally labeled "Grotesque" and "Gothic"
    to indicate  (what was seen as) their garish, barbaric nature. They were also
    called "Egyptian" until a confusion in terminology applied the term to slabs. '

  body: The term Gothic, as used by American typefounders beginning in the nineteenth
    century, refers to sans-serif type. The term is often misused to classify Blackletter
    typefaces.

  body: "Medieval blackletter being called Gothic was a disparaging term from the
    Renaissance applied to most, if not all Medieval art and architecture, associating
    it with the European tribes that had destroyed Rome and the classical civilization
    the Renaissance was trying to revive. I presume pre-blackletter calligraphy such
    as uncials was also considered gothic.\r\n\r\n\r\n19th Century sans-serif type
    got called Gothic by people who thought it resembled blackletter and Grotesque
    by people who thought it was ugly. I'm not sure if the term gothic was being used
    for type and lettering before the Victorian Gothic-revival style of architecture
    and decorative arts.\r\n\r\nBlackletter tends to be called gothic in the context
    of calligraphy rather than type. Blackletter type being called gothic is often
    simply due its association with gothic music and fashion, eg. on free font sites."

  body: "> <cite>I have not been able to find out why san serif fonts such as Franklin
    Gothic are called Gothic</cite>\r\n\r\nLinguistic explanation:\r\n\r\nIn order
    to describe a new phenomenon, at first, various already existing words denoting
    something else are used metaphorically to describe the new phenomenon.\r\n\r\nUsually,
    one of these words used metaphorically to describe the new phenomenon becomes
    the predominant word, and the others words often fall into disuse.\r\n\r\nIn the
    case of the new phenomenon of the sans serif typefaces at the beginning of the
    19th century, three metaphorical words describing something else were used to
    describe the new phenomenon of sans serif typefaces:\r\n\r\n- \"doric\"\r\n- \"grotesque\"\r\n-
    \"gothic\"\r\n\r\nThe metaphorical word \"doric\" fell into disuse both in America
    and in Europe and is no longer used for sans serif typefaces at all, but it is
    still mentioned in Webster's Third New International Dictionary of 1961.\r\n\r\nThe
    metaphorical word \"grotesque\" became the predominant word in Europe, especially
    in Britain and Germany, for describing sans serif typefaces metaphorically.\r\n\r\nThe
    metaphorical word \"gothic\" became the predominant word in America for describing
    sans serif typefaces metaphorically.\r\n\r\nIf you look into the British encyclopedia
    \"Glaister's Glossary of the Book\", second edition 1979, sub voce \"gothic\",
    \"grotesque\", \"doric\", you will discover\r\n\r\n- that the word \"gothic\"
    is not used metaphorically for sans serif fonts,\r\n- that the word \"grotesque\"
    is used metaphorically for sans serif fonts,\r\n- that the word \"doric\" is no
    longer mentioned at all.\r\n"

    the \"Dictionnaire de l'\xE9dition. Fran\xE7ais-Anglais. Anglais-Fran\xE7ais\"
    by Philippe Schuwer, published in 1977, did not yet contain the word \"sans serif\"
    as a French word.\r\n\r\nThe expressions \"Sans\", \"Serif\", \"Sanserif\", \"Sans
    serif\", \"Sans-serif\" etc. were not listed at all in the French section of this
    bilingual dictionary of 1977.\r\n\r\nThe expressions \"Sans serif\", \"Serif\"
    and \"Sanserif\" were only found in the English section of this bilingual dictionary,
    with translations into French words.\r\n\r\nThis means that before the computer
    and internet age, the French did not use the so-called \"French\" expression \"sans
    serif\".\r\n"

  body: "To increase the complexity of the problem and partially explain what Justin_Ch
    wrote above: \u201CGothic\u201D as a denomination for blackletter (handwritten
    or printed) only refers to a certain form of blackletter, which is also termed
    Textura or Textualis (see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blackletter#Textualis).
    Fraktur is another branch of broken letterform. \r\nFor a start in books on the
    topic I'd recommend \u201CBlackletter: Type and National Identity\u201D, ed. by
    Peter Bain/Paul Shaw, or if you read German, Albert Kapr\u2019s \u201CFraktur.
    Form und Geschichte der gebrochenen Schriften\u201D. For the sanserif Gothic,
    James Mosley\u2019s \u201CThe Nymph and the Grot. The revival of the sanserif
    letter\u201D was already mentioned. "

  body: "@Ivan: <em>\u2026these new barbaric types\u2026</em>\r\n\r\nThey weren't
    types then (1805), only lettering.\r\nThe sample you show is a block cut inserted
    into type matter, and the artist responsible has created a deliberately crude
    parody.\r\nSuch was the opprobrium attached to this putatively primitive style
    that type founders were slow to render it in print, long after its use had become
    widespread in other media.\r\n\r\nIs there a term for the phenomenon whereby somebody
    or something acquires the term by which it is derided, as a badge of honor? It's
    an ancient practice; the Cynics of Ancient Greece were quite literally dogs.\r\n\r\nI
    suspect there was an element of irony at play, as type founders proudly adopted
    the name Gothic, by which their clients half-mockingly referred to the new style.\r\n"

  body: The use of "Gothic" to refer to blackletter is attributed to Lorenzo Valla
    (in his <em>De elegantiis latinae linguae</em>) by Elizabeth Eisenstein (in <em>The
    Printing Press As an Agent of Change</em>, 1979, citing earlier authors such as
    Paul Frankl).

  body: In Latvia blackletter started to fade out around 1930. So the books and newspapers
    printed before were and still are referred to as printed with "Gothic letters"
    - Gotu burti. And if you mention to anybody "gothic" the first association is
    "Blackletter". Sans Serif were usually referred as Block letters - Bloka burti.
