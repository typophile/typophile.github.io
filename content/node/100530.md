  body: "Very clever, and the 3D imagery is spectacular, but I \uFB01nd the effect
    of parallel visual-spoken text to be trite (fol-low the boun-cing ball) and annoying,
    like subtitles in the same language or teletext captioning if you don\u2019t require
    it.\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s dif\uFB01cult to pay attention to both visual and spoken
    text at the same time. Hit over the head with redundancy\u2014a dilemma.\r\n\r\nIf
    one or the other or both were at the threshold of comprehension, then they would
    each have a raison d\u2019\xEAtre.\r\n\r\nI would be quite happy with the pacing
    provided by the music, as the text unfolds, and no spoken verse.\r\n"

  body: "Hi Nick,\r\n\r\nI'm aware of the \"follow the bouncing ball\" problematic.
    I usually don't appreciate much the usual kinetic typography videos for the same
    reasons.\r\n\r\nSo yes, you definitely put the finger on the kitschy side of this
    work. Hopefully, I hope the work will be appreciated for its \"other qualities\"...\r\n\r\n\r\nLet's
    take in count that this is experimental. By definition, the goal is to explore
    new directions and eventually make some interesting discoveries.\r\n\r\nOne aspect
    that I wanted to explore is the mapping of a recorded speech into some visual
    representation:\r\n\r\nFor that purpose, I used the concept of bricks: those are
    are either empty (corresponding to music or a pause in the speech) or filled with
    a word. Basically, the whole spatial layout is a direct representation of the
    soundtrack...\r\n\r\nEach of the 4 episodes is proposing a different spatial layout
    and a different unfolding of the intersection between the spoken and the written.\r\n\r\nI
    don't know of any other work exploring this direction (the artist Gary Hill have
    worked in the 80's on speech and visual representation, but without text rendering...)\r\n\r\nAnyway,
    I feel that the potential is huge, and that I have only scratched to top of an
    iceberg...\r\n\r\n\r\nA last parenthese: How did the idea of using bricks originated?\r\n\r\nSome
    strophes in the poem of Apollinaire's are metaphors based on the Bible: the narrator
    is like Pharaoh, pursuing his love, who is like the Hebrews...)\r\n\r\nThe passage
    in the Bible treating of this episode is known as the Song of the Sea. Quoting
    Wikipedia:\r\n\r\n<cite>It is one of only two sections of the Sefer Torah that
    is written with a different layout to the normal simple columns. The layout is
    similar to bricks in a wall: the alternating words are supposed to represent the
    two walls of the split sea with Israel walking down the middle.</cite>\r\n\r\nI
    find it fascinating that a couple of thousand years ago, scribes already used
    some kind of metaphorical text layout (which is what I'm trying to achieve in
    my work for a decade...)"
