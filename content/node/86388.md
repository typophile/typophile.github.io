  After all crazy design exploration, I ended up picking the simplest one.

  body: I'd get a bold or something similar somewhere, everything is a little bit
    too much on the same level. It's Garamond right? I always liked garamond.

  body: "Thanks for your comment. Maybe I should bold the name? and It's actually
    Sabon, which looks just like Garamond.\r\n"

  body: "I quite like it, the calmness, is that what you are going for? Does that
    represent you personally and your business approach? \r\nBut i think you should
    place it upwards slightly. Now it seems to \"fall down\"."

  body: I've just updated another design image. I felt like keeping less of decorative
    elements makes this name card look more professional for Therapist.. What do you
    think? Since It's just types..I feel nervous and not sure if this looks ok..

  body: I personally like lowercase for the email address. All caps just looks odd.

  body: It's a very nice card, considering that all the elements used in its design
    are simple and straightforward. I also agree that small letters work best for
    the email address and I think that your name should be emphasized just a little
    bit more. Otherwise, it's a really effective card for a therapist.

  body: You  really don't want to have "Master of Arts" appearing twice.  If it's
    your degree, it probably shouldn't even be there once. It looks pompous and self-aggrandizing.
