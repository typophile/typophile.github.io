Certainly, those who are professional graphic designers or design educators, or in the font business, care about typography, but these days anyone with a computer that has a font menu and options for type size etc. may be considered a typographer—just as anyone who uses a pen may be considered a writer—and many amateurs therefore also care about typography and the fonts they use.</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I think we get wound up by the misuse of certain typefaces and typographic abuse firstly because we&rsquo;re passionate about where our knowledge and skills are at and secondly because we have to protect centuries of typographic progress. When typography takes centuries to develop and the invention of the typewriter annuls a lot of that progress, that hurts. It&rsquo;s part of our heritage. When the invention of the keyboard is then based on the typewriter, that also hurts. Functions have been added back later but are not well accessible for most people. People consistently write 50x50cm to denote dimensions while that makes absolutely no sense, as you mean to say &ldquo;50 times 50&rdquo; and not &ldquo;50 ex 50&rdquo;. People say it right, but typographically there is a loss. When I see people just don&rsquo;t care about spelling anymore and don&rsquo;t use proper punctuation, not only do I get frustrated but I feel embarrassed and I can&rsquo;t take them seriously.I don&rsquo;t expect everyone to have the same affinity with typography I do, but I do expect people to care about the way they present themselves and how they perceive the world. It does matter which typefaces are used and how they&rsquo;re used and what they should or would conjure up in terms of feelings and associations. It&rsquo;s the reason brands work, why marketing is allowed to work, why your book is comfortable to read, why your website functions as efficiently as it does. You&rsquo;re asking us why we care like it&rsquo;s a very specific question, but I&rsquo;m a perfectionist because I care about how the world looks and I have clear ideas on how it should look and in what way I can improve things — not only typographically. I just care, generally speaking. People who don&rsquo;t care I don&rsquo;t understand..</p>
<p>People consistently use hyphens for all kinds of purposes that have nothing to do with hyphenating words, and the en dash and em dash they should be using in their appropriate context are alien to most people, while I would argue it&rsquo;s the same kind of regress as when you would suddenly abandon the comma and only use dots, or remove 1000 words from your language because you figure you will do fine without them. Yes, you might, but the point is that you&rsquo;re losing part of your vocabulary so the range in which you can express yourself is restricted. How is that a good thing or even something to be indifferent about? I suppose we care because we want to protect our heritage and try our best to keep improving and expanding typographic practice.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I think that there is a somewhat hostile mentality against the typographic community that typographers and type designers nitpick typographic minutiae (like using inch marks for quotations) are merely for vainglory because nitpicking shows how these type people can discover minor details that the public won’t be able to recognize. “You guys pick those innocuous things and rant about it just to show how good you are. Those innocuous things actually doesn’t matter; even if they go wrong nothing serious would happen – it’s not like people die from bad type or something.”</p>
<p>My response is this:</p>
<p>People really could possibly die from bad type. This may be less relevant when you are reading a book, but it is definitely important when you are reading a signage when you are driving on the highway, or when you are trying to find a route to escape a fire in a complex airport. Bad typography obstructs information, and people can die in these dire and contingent situations where information is urgently needed. If I recall right, FF Info is designed in the aftermath of a transportation accident in Germany.</p>
<p>One potential objection would be like this: “Okay, I’ll give you the point that typographic nitpicking is justified when in serious situations like signage and way finding systems. But if you’re still nitpicking while reading a damn pamphlet, you’re just showing off.” To this my response is that it’s very hard to determine what a “serious situation” is (“a serious situation is where people die” is apparently not a good enough criterion), and a pamphlet can also be serious – assume that this book is to be read by a dyslexic child who can’t read normal text. Therefore, instead of distinguishing between “serious situation where we need to be picky” and “casual situation where picky is vainglory” why don’t we just be always picky? Won’t that solve the problem straight? After all, typographers and type designers are titles made for those who specialize in this field. What’s wrong with them if they are just doing their jobs? On the other hand, if I use a slanted comic sans with tight leading and negative tracking and multiple consecutive hyphens to set a bible, would you (my imaginary opponent) still want to read it and buy it? Wouldn’t you (assume you are a Catholic/Christian) call it a serious invasion of God’s divinity?</p>
<p>I will avoid the common defense that “it’s the details that matters.” This is not because I don’t believe in this motto; in fact I increasingly realize that sometimes a small change in one stroke can affect the whole typeface, and a small increase in leading can change the whole composition. I don’t use this defense because it’s been so commonly used that it has lost its merit to stand up against those unfamiliar with this field – “Meh, he’s just posing the routine, old-fashioned talk about how details matters. We all know that.”</p>
<p>My punchline lies in here: to claim that attention for details only matters in “serious” situations is to claim that everything that do not substantially relate to the subsistence of mankind is innocuous (I’ve already stated that “serious” is very vague, but for the sake of my argument I am assuming that “serious” means “vital for the subsistence of mankind”). Not only type, but also anything that does not have immediate utility (like food production and water, etc.; please bear with my crude use of utilitarianism). To accept and advocate this claim is to mount a hostile aggression against art (i.e. Van Gogh’s painting), against design (i.e. Dieter Rams’s pocket radio), against music, against the study of philosophy&hellip;</p>
<p>To call typographers as “nitpickers” is not an argument; it is a character assassination.</p>

<p>I know it&rsquo;s frustrating when a client thinks you&rsquo;re &ldquo;nitpicking&rdquo;, but part of the job is dealing with clients and being able to explain why some things are important.

<p>It may well be so that the guy in a signage shop prepares the actual signage plate, but isn’t the typeface of the signage still a result of the type designer’s work? To my knowledge, the US government commissioned its Highway and Clearview typeface for signage use (TFJ does his Interstate based on Highway). There’s also the Wayfinding Sans and FF Transit.</div>

<p>But I was speaking more of the everyday directional signage that you find in hotels, office buildings, etc. I was staying in a nice hotel last week and the emergency signage was awful.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t get me wrong, there are good sign companies. In fact I have a relative who works at one. But outside of transportation hubs and upscale buildings, I don&rsquo;t think directional signage gets a whole lot of attention from designers.</p>
