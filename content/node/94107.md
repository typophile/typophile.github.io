  are the same font. I think. Can anyone confirm?\r\n\r\nhttp://goodeveningeurope.com/fonts/2000logo_2numbers.JPG\r\n\r\nThese
  examples are from the year 2000, a show in Sweden. I am not sure if that helps.\r\n\r\nThanks
  very much in advance for your help. If you need some more samples of this font do
  let me know.\r\n\r\nIs the font available online? Can I read about it and its designer
  anywhere?"

  body: DPape I am not sure if it is my machine but I cannot read what you have written.
    I can only see your username and latest post on top of each other. I guess it
    is how my browser displays this forum when there is an attachment in the post.
    Please can you repeat the name of the font? Thank you so, so much for your help.

  body: "So you could see the preview?  Good.\r\n\r\nClose is not the name. I meant
    \"this font looks close to your sample\".  Font name is PF Terminal Square Bold.
    I could not find this font being offered today by Parachute Fonts. Perhaps Google
    could help you further.  Perhaps you could contact Parachute Fonts for info."
