    sure one of the resident type historians will be able to salt it down to a particular

  body: "Agree this is some sort of Scotch Roman -- with rather short descenders --
    but I can't find a digital match. Not a lot of distinctive letters, with the possible
    exception of the question mark which is like some Caslons. This Scotch Roman seems
    fairly austere, so for a substitute, I would be tempted to use Cyrus Highsmith's
    Escrow Light http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/fontbureau/escrow/ although the ear
    on the _g_ is too high.\r\n\r\nDon\r\n"
