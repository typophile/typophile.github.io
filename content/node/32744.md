  consideration when you tell me your thoughts. This is the final sketches before
  going to fontlab. The name of the font will be called \"mizzet\".\r\n\r\nThank you
  very much!\r\n\r\nLindaGK\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Mizzet_4003.jpg]"

  body: "I think you should take the sizes of the letters into consideration. Right
    now there are a lot of different sizes and this will cause certain letters to
    stand out more in text. \r\nWhat if I want to spell zebra? z_____ebra.\r\n\r\nI
    really like the numbers but I feel they don't match the rest of the set very well.
    They feel more controlled."

  body: I haven't seen the FontLab results in class, but I like the flow of the letters.
    I agree with Haley that some of the letters have really deep ascenders or trail
    too much. Otherwise, I'm looking forward to seeing it...

  body: You may want to loosen up and try "!?$" again; they're rather rigid as compared
    to your alphanumerics. Actually, don't bother drawing a new dollar sign, just
    put a stroke through the big S you have and that would look great. Try to draw
    a question mark that looks appropriate next to your P.

  body: "The tail of the lower case z could descend below the baseline if it has a
    curve like the first cap, and be spaced so that it underscores following letters
    - it's not a problem.\r\n\r\nNick Cooke"
