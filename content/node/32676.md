body: "I must have read this idea somewhere. If anyone could suggest where, let me
  know. The idea is this: The variations in appearance of script over the centuries
  \ prior to the invention of moveable type (in the European West, that is) were due
  to a number of factors (e.g., what was considered appropriately \"official\"), but
  NOT to any overt theory of visual \"ideals.\"\r\n\r\nThen along came moveable type,
  and in fairly short order (the decades immediately following 1440) the mechanical
  possibility of creating many different kinds of very sharp, tiny and delicate lines
  and shapes-- something not really possible when writing by hand but very much within
  the capabilities of somebody good with the tools and skills of a jeweler, goldsmith,
  machinist, etc. And along with this, the ability to lay those fine lines and shapes
  on paper quickly.\r\n\r\nThis shift in what could be accomplished mechanically,
  so the argument goes, actually created the conditions which made it possible for
  type \"theories\" such as rationalism and romanticism (and later, modernism) to
  emerge and flourish. So, and here's the clincher, if any of this makes any sense:
  the mechanical technologies made the <em>theories</em> possible. That's just such
  a sweet conclusion, but I am afraid maybe it's a little bogus. \r\n\r\nThoughts?"

    a pair of book historian who spar academically over the whether the printing press
    was as a causal, revolutionary force in history (making possible, as you mentioned,
    critical type theory) or simply  part of a natural evolution. That's putting it
    crudely. Eisenstein's most popular book is called \"The Printing Press as an Agent
    of Change.\"---I think she'd be making the argument to which you refer.\r\n\r\nIt's
    an interesting argument. I would say that manuscript-era \"theories\" existed
    but in more nuanced, non \"ism\" form. Certainly visual ideals existed, as plainly
    as pleasure did---why else illuminate? Why use the golden ratio? I could hardly
    think that it was because of any official demand. "

  body: "G. Noordzij in 'The Stroke' argues that changes in writing drove changes
    in type styles, at least through the early 19th century. And a number of people
    have pointed out that a lot of new types of the 19th century, including slab serifs
    and sans were developed first by sign painters. So I doubt that you will win type
    historians to your point of view as far as letter styles go. \r\n\r\nI'm sure
    that punch cutting instead of writing, and designing a fixed shape alphabet in
    metal also had big effect on actual execution, and was responsible for key innovations.
    But as far as it being the dominant driving force in changes in style, I don't
    think that will fly.   "

    type, I might point out the use of stoichedon spacing in classical Greek inscriptions.
    But for the most part I suspect the theorization of type design has more to do
    with the convergence of art education and typography, starting toward the end
    of the nineteenth century. '

  body: "The mistake has been to confuse the Modern movement, a discete historical
    phenomenon of the 20th Century, with Modernism as a general occurrence. In Post-modern
    theory, Modernism is paradoxical, because it supposes a break with an organic,
    pre-modern past; the paradox is that whatever point in time one chooses, the break
    has already occurred, so the concept is infinitely expandable.\r\n\r\nPerhaps
    the most \"rational\" of visual theories is that of mathematical, linear perspective,
    attributed to Brunelleschi in the early 15th century, <em>before</em> the invention
    of moveable type.\r\n\r\nNonehteless, the technology of moveable type was strongly
    deterministic, in many ways. For instance, empirically: it may be argued that
    the ability of type to represent words with greater clarity produced a more profound
    understanding of a page of text. Economically: the printer's reduction of alternate
    sorts and standardization of editorial proofing, served to create a more logical
    orthography. Metaphorically, the mechanical systematization of typography is extremely
    suggestive. And of course, the proliferation of books made possible societies
    which are almost completely literate, totalizing intellectual synergy."

  body: "Thanks for the useful responses so far!\r\n\r\nI would agree that any human
    practice embodies some sort of \"theory,\" if by that we mean a network of values
    and assumptions about how that practice out to be done. I guess the argument (not
    mine, just whatever it was that I'd picked up) was framed more in terms of the
    \"isms\" and how they play out specific typeface designs-- most specifically,
    the developments of stroke-width variations and geometrical relationships under
    \"rationalism\" and the sort of counter-intuitive (in light of where we seem to
    be now) view of fraktur under \"romanticism\" (e.g, that the little nooks and
    crannies reflect something like organic growth and naturalism, rather than anything
    dark and \"scary\"). Nick's last post is especially eloquent and substantive as
    usual (not to knock the others, which are all helpful).\r\n\r\nAnyway, I knew
    this was the place for a reality check. Any more thoughts are more than welcome!
    Thanks."

  body: 'Actually, this sounds like, or at least related to, Robin Kinross''s argument
    in <em>Modern Typography</em>: that ''modern'' typography does not exist until
    printers and typecutters began to rationalize what they were doing in the form
    of theories and manuals, including disquisitions on style and artistic judgment.
    Kinross''s is not a causal argument, though, as I recall; if it were, it would
    be a circular one.'
