body: I am using FontLab to design a type family and trying to create small caps.  First,
  I am confused about what glyph numbers and names to use.  I can find the Opentype
  &#34;feature&#34; &#60;smcp&#62; and a VOLT description of how to code the feature
  swap but I don&#39;t know the Opentype numbering scheme for small caps.  I assume
  I would add a feature in FontLab but need help with the specifics.  Any enlightenment
  would be appreciated. <BR> <BR>ChrisL

    the book Learn FontLab Fast: <a href="http://www.logofontandlettering.com/" target="_blank">http://www.logofontandlettering.com/</a>
    <BR> <BR>I don&#39;t want to sound like on a trade show, but I think in this book
    you will find quite a few handy tricks for making OpenType fonts.  <BR> <BR>Regards,  <BR>Adam

  body: Thanks Adam.  I got the book and it worked.  Redrawing the glyphs correctly
    to my satisfaction is far more complicated than Leslie&#39;s simple vertical reduction
    method but the way he describes groups worked as slick as can be.  I&#39;ll post
    my results soon as a PDF. <BR> <BR>ChrisL

    <BR>There is Greek and Cyrillic as well as small caps in the most recent post
    there. <BR> <BR>ChrisL'

    highly recomend it to everyone.  There are excellent chapters by Adam Twardoch
    on diacritics, John Hudon on Unicode, Cyrillics by Maxim Zhukov and Vladimir Yefimov,
    and Greek by Gerry Leonidas. There is much more but I have just begun to read
    it.  This book and the publication TYPO &#60;<a href="http://www.magtypo.cz/"
    target="_blank">http://www.magtypo.cz/</a>&#62; are terrific help in type design.
    &#40;see Diacrtitics CE by Filip Bla?ek in TYPO 10&#41;.  <BR>I wish I had read
    them before I started my typeface. <BR> <BR>ChrisL'

  body: Charles, <BR>I tried tightening the space on my ligs but the difficulty is,
    when it looks good at a larger size, it looks tight at smaller sizes.  I wish
    there was a way to swap out ligs by type size. <BR> <BR>Thanks for your comments,
