  I&#39;ve come to as close as Bitstream&#39;s <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/bitstream/normande/"
  target="_blank"> Normande</a>. Yet, as not too sure whether it is indeed Normande
  &#40;particularly the &#34;L&#34;, the &#34;E&#34; and the &#34;P&#34; keep me in
  doubt&#41; or actually may perhaps be an other font, I would appreciate the opinion
  of you... &#40;Then again, could it be that those which appear to me as being differences
  between those letters in the pic and in the <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/bitstream/normande/normande/testdrive.html?s=SOUL%2BDEEP&amp;p=36"
  target="_blank"> test-drive</a> may just result from the quality of the scan itself,
  and maybe I&#39;m paying too much attention to such details?...&#41; <BR> <BR><img

  body: It&#39;s probably an older version of Normande. Both Haas and Bauer had versions
    of it in metal. The version in my old Formatt &#40;cut-out type&#41; catalog,
    for example, looks closer to your sample than the Bitstream version in your link.
    I&#39;m not sure which foundry&#39;s version it is, though. The Bitstream version
    may be as close as you&#39;re going to get without drawing it yourself.

  body: How about the <a href="http://www.philsfonts.com/detail.html?sku=BQ90084001P1"
    target="_blank">Berthold Normande</a>?  Sometimes Bitstream&#39;s versions may
    be a bit different. I think this looks very much like the sample, and I think
    you need to allow for the fact that black on white looks different than the reverse.

  body: Thank you, both, for your precious replies. And yes indeed, Berthold&#39;s
    version of Normande does look to match even closer to the sample than Bitstream&#39;s.
    Also thank you yet for the tip on Phil&#39;s Fonts site, an other addition to
    my bookmarks. :-&#41;
