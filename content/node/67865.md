  nature. \r\n\r\nI've asked a couple of questions already, and folks have been absolutely
  fantastic. Some answers have come in the form of referencing previous discussions
  here at Typophile. I have tried to do searches with no success. Is there a trick
  to finding previous discussions?\r\n\r\nThanks in advance.\r\n\r\nRob"

    time; it\u2019s a frequent subject of posts. I don\u2019t know why Punchcut doesn\u2019t
    just remove the field until they have time to address it properly.\r\n\r\nYou
    should do as Darrel (aluminum) suggests and use Google with the \u2018site:typophile.com\u2019
    delimiter in your search terms so that it only searches this site.\r\n\r\n"
