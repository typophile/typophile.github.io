body: "'Lavigne Display' is the first release of a type-family aimed at publications
  such as interior design and women magazines\u2014anywhere a touch of distinction
  is to be desired. In the opinion of its designer, glossy magazines have been boring
  us with the same type families for years, with only a small group of fonts being
  used to denote refinement and sophistication.\r\n\r\nThe philosophy behind 'Lavigne'
  is to achieve the high contrast and other refinements observed in classic 'modern
  serif' typefaces, without borrowing too much from history. Accordingly, the main
  source of inspiration, was careful observation of pointed-pen calligraphy and sketching.\r\n'Lavigne'
  is planned as an ambitious family with 2 main divisions, Display and Text. The range
  will cover every type-hierarchy required in modern magazine design.\r\n\r\nThe six
  distinct styles in the Display version are published in OpenType format, featuring
  small caps and four sets of numbers (proportional old style, tabular old style,
  proportional lining and tabular lining), as well as matching currency symbols.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.re-type.com/fonts/fonts-lavigne.html\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/lavigne-newsletter3_5651.png]"

    love the '&'.\r\n(Okay, maybe I should make the 'love' a 'like', it looks waaay
    too emotional, otherwise. ;)\r\n\r\n<em>(Saw it already mentioned on Twitter,
    and of course I had to 'retweet' it.)</em>"
