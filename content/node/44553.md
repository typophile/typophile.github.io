  body: This is almost certainly hand drawn. You will only be able to find similar
    forms in a font. Robert's Solo idea is a good one. Also <a href="http://letterheadfonts.com/fonts/bostontruckstyle.shtml">Boston
    Truckstyle</a> and <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/singles/fountain/vitus_regular/">Vitus</a>
    (though without the swashiness).

  body: Yeah, actually, I should have clarified that I'm looking for something similar.
    The image is from a scan of an actual vintage postcard, c. 1910. Thanks for the
    suggestions! (And keep 'em coming...)

  body: All great suggestions. I ended up deciding to just generate the feel of the
    period rather than to try to replicate the font itself. The Boston Truckstyle
    suggestion led me to Letterhead Fonts (I'm new at this), which then led me to
    [[http://www.letterheadfonts.com/fonts/billhead.shtml|LHF Billhead]], which worked
    wonderfully in my project. Thanks again!
