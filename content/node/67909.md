body: "Some time ago I found myself reading an article, not sure if it was a downloaded
  PDF or online, and it made a statement something to the effect \"\u2026we are no
  longer climbing corporate ladders, breaking glass ceilings\u2026\"\r\n\r\nI think
  I ended up there following a discussion thread here, but without a working search
  engine I cannot find it.\r\n\r\nI spent an hour or so with Google and came across
  this article\u2026\r\n\r\nhttp://peoplethings.com/andblog/is-graphic-design-dead/\r\n\r\n\u2026which
  I believe I came across on my way to the afore mentioned article.\r\n\r\nCan anyone
  direct me to this mystery article?\r\n\r\nThanks in advance."

  body: Thank's for the link. I'll keep that in my back pocket. The article I'm looking
    for  was more of a Newsweek style article. Not so academic.
