  symmetrical things happening.I'm not happy with the translation of the flower, it
  resembles a Clip art flower. The typeface face choice is ms eaves which i'm not
  happy about. Can somebody help out?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nalso,\r\n\r\nthe company does
  flowers for most occasions with an exception to funerals..( i think)\r\nan excuse
  for the bright colors perhaps...\r\n"

    smaller. Those on the left, the way you've got the type lined up creates point
    of contention in between the two lines. \"girl\" reads bigger than \"layla\" because
    of color, size, and spacing. The way the y and the i line up is very uncomfortable.
    \r\n\r\nI really like the colors."

    of the flower. \r\n\r\nIf you're not happy with the type ... why'd you use it?\r\n\r\nthey're
    not sketches. just saying.\r\n\r\n:)\r\n\r\n\"with an exception to funerals..(
    i think)\" ... you should really know the answer to that too.\r\n\r\nLook forward
    to seeing your next steps.\r\n\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n----------\r\n<strong>Paul

    smaller ... then write next to\r\n it layla .... maybe would look better... got
    me??\r\n\r\nbut i think if the company does flowers... it must has more floral
    shape ..."
