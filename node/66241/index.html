It's not supposed to be a "logo" per se, more like a keyvisual/character sort of graphic for a web site, but I need to quickly check what it "reads" as.

Perhaps that its head looks like that of a whitefish, but the fin is from the shark. Also the fin sits way too far back on its spine.</div>

Yes, mostly. They don't need to be super-readable – they're supposed to be somewhat illustrative – but I'm happy if they manage to communicate that they «say» something besides being fish.
BTW, these would be used on the same web site, probably repeatedly; so whoever sees the exclam fish would likely have seen the question fish before.</div>

Frode, mismatch in shape? Interesting – and I'd be curious how/where you see that, because honestly I don't. If you mean that the fish is sharper / more detailed / more clearly defined, then yes, but to my eyes that doesn't make them mismatched (not in execution; not any more than a fish with anatomical details would have to be different from semi-dissolved floating junk).
And funny that you see the cross in the "a": It's in the font, and I was going to remove it because I thought it was too obtrusive/visible, but the client liked it as a semi-hidden mini-reference to the fact that this blog is written from a specifically Swiss perspective. :)</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I agree with Frode about the mismatch. And the header with the waterline complicates it further: 
water=3-d, realistic
fish= 2-d, graphic/iconic
lettering= 2-d, abstract/biomorphic
I'm left confused: are we to think of the fish being in that water, and reacting to that stuff?

Did you try sharper edged pollution?</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I like the fish punctuation. I like the type treatment for pollution. But both are very strong visuals and seem to be a bit much when put side-by-side. I think each would be stronger on its own.

As for the fish punctuation...just a thought...what if the dot was a drop (of water). That'd allow you to disconnect the fish and might make it a tad more readable as a punctuation mark on its own. </div>

		<div class="commentbody">To be clear: this thing is final, it's live, and I'm really happy with it (and so is the client), so I'm not expecting to make any changes. I do however appreciate the discussion; I'm aware that I'm breaking some conventions with this. 

The fish is not: «a logo»; and it's also not a piece of punctuation that happens to be shaped like a fish, sort-of matching the style of the rest. That's primarily a fish looking at that crap and wondering. He's also shaped like a question mark, because he's wondering. (The fish could maybe be described as a «mascot» for the blog, if a word is needed.)

Piecing the fish together from junk would be wrong conceptually. The fish is inherently something else than the junk. They still inhabit the same design space, at least to my eye. The friction between them is the friction that <em>must</em> exist between fish and junk, which by the way isn't always clear-cut: For instance, fish eat this micro-plastic trash (when it's red or orange) because they think it's shrimps. 
So I don't think the 2 elements can really co-exist quite «harmoniously» – not even contrasting enough to be nicely harmonious again! This entire thing is meant to be slightly off-harmonious at second glance. There is micro-friction, and there are little contradictions, and that is deliberate. It's part of the message.

To me it does work, just not exactly the same way as such logos/graphics often do. And if it were more conventional, more clear, more balanced and comfortable (not that I honestly believe it's <em>that</em> jarring!), I believe that might well make it prettier, but likely also worse at conveying the message I need it to convey.</div>

Another completely unrelated issue you might want to look into is how the gills and the eye look like two cartoonish eyes when the maskot is so small.</div>
