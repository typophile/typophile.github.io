  body: "<em>Something that would match this?</em>\r\n\r\nI think you really want
    something that will complement your logo - which I quite like by the way (reads
    fine to me as long as I'm not too close or it's too large) - not \u2018match\u2019
    it. I'd suggest trying a humanist sans for the text face, coupling it with a display
    face that has a latinesque feel.\r\n\r\nIf you do want to go with something reminiscent
    of your logo then I think Loreto would be great, if it's available. "
