    I'm sure you've already tried this extensively, Thomas. What are the shapes that
    aren't matching for you? S? a? It does seem like the tails on 'a' and 't' are
    angled rather than flat, but it's hard to tell with the ink spread."

    UC letters are spaced out a bit and pairs: r, y. are also spaced out.\r\nVersion

  body: Jan may be on to something with Swiss 721 - my Bitstream catalog from back
    in the early 90s shows a variety of condensed weights. Since it is Bitstream's
    version of Helvetica the question is are the differences enough to make up for
    what we see. The issue of ink spread in printing is also a question.

  body: "I can only confirm what Renko and Stephen said. I see nothing that could
    lead to another font than Helvetica. Squooshed surely but still Helvetica. To
    me, all differences and minor details are due to scanning process and original
    printing. That's also why I can't be 100% positive but still believe it is Helvetica.\r\nRegarding
    PDF properties, can't explain why but don't think they should be taken in consideration.
    This is probably due to the OCR process used for scanning this document. When
    opening document under Ai, there's no text, only the scanned image."

    a typeface to fit it in the grid doesn\u2019t use some exotic font. Maybe just
    the apple built-in Helvetica \u2026 "

  body: "Florian emailed me less than an hour after I posted about this, so I am pretty
    sure he was first, yes.\r\n\r\nGood thing, too, because I already sent him his
    $200, so it would have been very unfortunate if I only realized now than Jan beat
    him! Congratulations to Jan on being first runner up. If he makes it to ATypI
    in Amsterdam I will gladly buy him a drink.\r\n\r\nI will be doing more thorough
    testing starting tonight, but so far it really does look like Swiss 721 Medium.
    At least, I have enough evidence to arrest and charge the suspect while I look
    for more, and I have paid Florian his reward. (Hmm, if I continue that analogy,
    I guess I should have waited for a conviction first.)\r\n\r\nI would love to talk
    more about the analysis and such, but as this is an active case and is expected
    to go to trial, I should wait until afterwards. Sorry!\r\n\r\nIn this particular
    case, the font ID is only part of the puzzle, but it was the one that was giving
    me the most trouble. Given that I have two cases going right now, and they both
    have immediately looming deadlines, I couldn't afford to noodle on it further
    on my own. I am thrilled by the response! Thank you to everyone who contributed,
    not only Florian and Jan!"

  body: "No, it was Swiss 721 Medium. Now to be clear, there are no design differences
    worth mentioning\u2014Swiss 721 is a Helvetica knockoff. But there <em>are</em>
    some slight differences in the advance widths, which make it impossible to get
    an exact match with Helvetica.\r\n\r\nBut it is exactly that level of certainty
    one wants in these high-stakes legal cases. Crazy stuff!"
