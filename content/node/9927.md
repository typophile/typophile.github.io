  checked and the Berthold version is a litttle bit &#39;heavier&#39; <BR>I&#39;m
  almost sure it&#39;s a monotype version. <BR>The only hint i have is a font ID:
  2424 <BR>I am not very good at this but i know most of you guys are. <BR>Someone
  who produced this Baskerville and where it is available? That would be a great help.
  <BR>I thank you typogods!!!<img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/68014.jpg"

    it is marked as dfont in my suitcase&#41; <BR>The problem is I need it for Mac
    and PC. So the new question that rises is: <BR>Is it possible to buy the Baskerville
    delivered with macos for PC? <BR>I never thought a Baskerville could be so complicated

  body: Thanx. <BR>Finding a &#40;decent&#41; open type version of the Baskerville
    sounds easier than it is. And in fact, i exactly need this typo. <BR>Not just
    &#39;a&#39; baskerville, if you know what i mean.
