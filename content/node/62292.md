    of Underware. Not near as good though. Sorry for not being of any help identifying
    this one.\r\n\r\nCheers"

  body: "Well you wouldn't be able to identify it - I did it. Thanks for your criticism
    - I do like Underware but I'm not trying to copy their style. And really, it's
    not that bad for a first draft.\r\n\r\nI just wanted to know if it resembled anything
    else, and if it's worth persevering. I am looking at the idea of an italic crossed
    with a script. I'll carry on on anyway.\r\n\r\n\r\nNick Cooke"

    away that familiar Underware look, I'm sure it can \"stand on its own feet\".\r\nGood
    luck.\r\n\r\nCheers"
