  more books about the history of type, what an ascender is, etc. I would like a book
  that explains line length, leading, tracking, but not what they are, but what the
  rules are for using them and how to best break them.\r\n\r\nthanks!"

    Novel. Erik Spiekermann...not easy. I am trying abebooks next. I am sad to say
    I never heard of any of these except Bringhurst...so I am really looking forward

  body: "A Type Primer by John Kane would be right up your alley, but you\u2019ll
    have to either pay a lot or order it from the UK. For some reason the American
    publishers think that when a type book sells out and the price doubles for secondhand
    copies, they shouldn\u2019t publish more."

  body: "Thanks again. I am looking forward to curling up with some good type books
    this holiday season. I was unable to get the Rhyme & Reason: a Typographic Novel.
    Erik Spiekermann but several others are already on their way from Amazon.\r\n\r\nI
    am just developing \"my style\" but I am starting to think that I am one of those
    people that likes to work with only 5-10 fonts but really, really get to know
    them well and I hope these books can help me with that. Right now I am obsessed
    with Whitney not only because it is \"museum-like\" but also because it has an
    amazing array of weights which for my publication work is a godsend. It also seems
    sort of like a classic in the making which I love.\r\n\r\nDo You have long term
    \"favorite\" fonts or do you switch all the time?"
