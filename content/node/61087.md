  so darned fast?!?!?!\r\n\r\nI graduated with an Associate's Degree in Graphic Design
  this past January and git hooked on typography when a took that class just over
  a year ago. Typophile became an instant favorite for me after reading <a href=\"http://typophile.com/node/12902\">this
  thread</a>.\r\n\r\nNow, I am just trying to keep up with everyone and try to learn
  as much as possible and I believe this site will be a fantastic help! So, if anyone
  out there wants to help a newbie, feel free to throw me a couple of links or send
  me any tips or tricks you might like to share!\r\n\r\nKeith"

  body: Maybe you've already heard this, but whatthefont.com is a very handy site.
    just submit an image of the font you want to know the name of, and the website
    will give you suggestions of which font it might / could be. (It's not always
    right, but it's a start anyways)
