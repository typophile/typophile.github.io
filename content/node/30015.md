  body: Hmm. Buddha implies something that Yves is not. ehehe. He's definitely on
    the condensed side of things. But it did make me laugh. Imagine rubbing Yves belly
    to get your typographic answers. ehehe.

  body: "Tiff is right. I am anything but Buddha-like -- rubbing my belly feels like
    stroking a xylophone. :^P\r\n\r\nI confirmed the Minion/Warnock identification
    after examining the samples, but that doesn't mean I can't be wrong. Contrary
    to rumors perpetrated by Conor and the likes, I'm only human after all. :^D"
