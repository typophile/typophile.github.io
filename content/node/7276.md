body: Hello, everyone. I belong to the group of people who&#39;re showing their very
  first typeface on this forum . So here it is.. It is based on letterforms drawn
  with a brush on paper, which I then outlined and made more uniform. The inspiration
  behind the typeface was originally based on shapes in nature - the curves that occur
  in plants, leaves, etc &#40;hence, the name &#34;Organica&#34;&#41;. It was conceived
  as imperfect, but based on aesthetically pleasing shapes, which strive for symmetry/ideal
  shape, but never quite reach it. Now that I&#39;m simplifying the shapes more, it
  seems like it&#39;s evolving into an exploration of calligraphy, something humanist,
  done by hand &#40;I just heard a great talk by Robert Bringhurst at the Design Thinkers
  in TO <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif" ALT=":-&#41;"
  BORDER=0> &#41;.  <BR> <BR>Please give me critique in this typeface- any kind of
  feedback will be very much appreciated. <BR> <BR>Kristina. <img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/51744.jpg"

  body: Never seen a &#34;q&#34; or &#34;g&#34; like that before, very original.  <BR>I
    think the name&#34; organica&#34; is taken. I can&#39;t place <BR>where I have
    seen it, but do a bit of research before you stick with this name. Very nice work,
    reminds me of something Mark Von Bronkhorst/Kanna Aoki could have done back in
    the mid-90&#39;s &#40;mvbfonts.com &#41;. Could benefit from some unique ligatures.

  body: Thank you for your comments. I will try to integrate some swashes/looping
    descenders into y and f and maybe other letters.. Making a typeface that is unnecessarily
    ornamental&#40;if that&#39;s the right word here&#41; was one of my concerns,
    so I will see how these changes work out..  <BR> <BR>And thanks for letting me
    know that the name was taken.. I should&#39;ve done more research on that! <IMG
