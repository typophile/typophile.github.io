  ago I found a website where buy fonts where there was a great widget that it helped
  you to choose the best fonts to combine together, I remember that there was for
  example the possibility to create a fake newspaper or a magazine to see immediatly
  how it appear with the fonts that you choose, it was very simply and very interesting,
  it helps a lot to advise what to buy, but I don't remember on witch website I found
  it, so may be someone knows and can help me a lot.\r\n\r\nthanks\r\nSwanina"
