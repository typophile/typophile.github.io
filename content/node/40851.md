body: "I set up this font (called Memoir) so that beginning and endings of words are
  substituted contextually and beginning of lines as well. That all works fine. Then
  I also set it up so that some start glyphs come in after capital letters that aren't
  set up to connect. This uses a class I titled @Cap_uncon. This works as well except
  for some odd reason it doesn't work with certain caps even though they are in the
  class. While typing this I did a check and found out the default caps that do connect
  are the ones linked to the swashes in the @Cap_uncon that don't work. I'm a bit
  puzzled as to why those aren't working. \r\n\r\nAny ideas?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/class_4766.jpg]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
