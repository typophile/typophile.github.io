  body: "To me and even if it's not matching perfectly (mainly /T top slab serif arm
    pits), I probably go for a [[http://www.myfonts.com/search/clarendon|Clarendon]],
    customized a bit maybe like artificially emboldened and rounded. But that's probably
    more [[http://www.myfonts.com/search/Egiziano|Egiziano]].\r\nSo more Egyptienne
    alternatives: [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/fontbureau/giza|Giza]] (FiveFive

  body: "Good finds Ryuk.\r\nTo my eye the closest match would be somewhere between
    Aldogizio Heavy [img:sites/default/files/old-images/AldogizioHeavyAsATCO_6060.gif]
    \ and Aldogizio Black [img:sites/default/files/old-images/AldogizioBlackAsATCO_5834.gif]\r\nAmong
    the runner-up candidates I like HWT Slab Columbian \r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/HWTSlabColumbianAsATCO_5282.gif]
    despite its lighter weight.\r\nI also like OL Egiziano Classic Black \r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/OLEgizianoClassicBlackAsATCOb_6205.gif]\r\n
    but find that its serif treatment is too harsh and heavy.\r\nDon"

  body: Thanks Tom and Don. Best choice here to me is Egiziano Classic mainly of because
    /T arm pits and /C dug counter. Adding an outline stroke and rounding it a bit
    should get the job very close.
