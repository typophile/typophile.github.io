    \ I assume you know that IE doesn't grab favicons unless you add the link to your
    favorites, right?\r\n\r\nPerhaps it's cached on my computers, though. If you have
    the <a href=\"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/search?q=favicon&status=4>favicon
    plugin for Firefox,</a> maybe you can grab it with that. \r\n\r\nEileen\r\n\r\n<a

    can view the Gmail favicon.  It is not there.
