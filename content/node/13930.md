  before or not.\r\n\r\nAnyway, I have this client I do some work for who likes to
  put either a (R) or a ^TM after EVERY company name or product.  As you can imagine,
  this results in quite a few of these things.  (It's not just his company, it's EVERY
  company he mentions or does business with.)\r\n\r\nMy question is what effect, if
  any, this has on readability and comprehension.  I mean, it seems like \"Microsoft
  Windows\" is going to be easier to grasp than \"Microsoft\xAE Windows\u2122\"   \r\n\r\nAny
  thoughts?  Any studies or actual facts on this matter?\r\n\r\nThanks.\r\n\r\nsteve"

    - which means maybe it's not so bad. A valid readability concern though is the
    \"textural distraction\" that such marks have <strong>before</strong> the reader
    gets to that point of the text (sometimes from many lines before).\r\n\r\nAlso,
    a big issue in something like this is Familiarity, specifically here how quickly
    it's gained with something jarring like this; maybe with a proper name the reader
    has to learn the bouma <strong>anyway</strong> so again it's not so bad. Nobody
    really knows though... So I might work the aesthetics angle (as in, it's ugly);
    and/or look for a font with discrete marks, to reduce the textural distraction.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

      outperforms Linux\u2122 based sytems on Dell\xAE Opteron\u2122 boxes using FakeSofts\xAE

      not a real sentence, but it demonstrates the kind of density of bugs I'm talking
      about.  If I superscripted them, well, then there is just a dot after every
      other word.  Hrant got the idea - it's not \"what can I do about it\" or \"do
      I have to do it\" it's \"How can I convince my client not to do this without
      saying 'Because it's flipping hideous!'?\"\r\n\r\nRe: Reading this immersively
      - what exactly qualfies as immersive reading?  We're talking 250-1000 words
      of product descriptions.  I don't really have a problem using these things in
      display text or headlines, but in the body it really seems to break up the flow.
      \r\n\r\nTell me more about this \"textural distraction\" thing, that sounds
      like a promising avenue.\r\n\r\nsteve\r\n\r\n(the other thing that gets me is
      he likes to put them where they totally not required, like after IEEE or UNIX.

      respond to without lapel-shaking)\r\n"

    only the first use of a mark on any given document. \r\n\r\nAs for marks not owned
    by the client, unless there's some legal requirement between the owner of the
    marks and the client, they may be able to avoid bugging and just put a standard

    they should talk to their lawyer before doing this.\r\n\r\nCheers, Si  \r\n "

  body: "> what exactly qualfies as immersive reading?\r\n\r\nGood question. There
    isn't necessarily a clear threshold. In fact in this case if somebody has decided
    to read the thing, he'll get through it before getting a headache. The question
    though becomes: do you want to make reading this thing so unpleasant than the
    reader just gives up?\r\n\r\n> Tell me more about this \u201Ctextural distraction\u201D
    thing\r\n\r\nBasically, when there's enough of a \"spike\" in the texture or color
    of text, the eye wants to jump directly to it to quickly figure out what this
    \"special\" thing is. When this happens, the eye then has to go back to where
    it was; this is wasteful and tiring. When a paragraph is littered with such spikes,
    it become quite unpleasant to read.\r\n\r\n--\r\n\r\nBut here's a possibly stronger
