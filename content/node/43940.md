  design trade hasn't yet passed muster with Unicode, neither having been accepted
  by an official institution, nor having become demonstrably widespread in vernacular
  usage (aszszelp).\r\n\r\nCould a code number have been assigned, even if there is
  not yet an officially sanctioned glyph form?"

    in English? :^P\r\nseeing that no one (not least of all the Russian Central Bank)
    actually uses this symbol, i'll give an answer to my own question. it's too early
    to encode a ruble symbol which has no currency. (sorry for the pun)"

  body: At least there are some codepoints left in the currency symbols page. One
    could put the Ruble mark in the next available one and correct it later if it
    gets assigned elsewhere or if the official design changes from what appears to
    be the leading candidate.

    of two private studios (ArtLebedev and Paratype) and is rather unlikely to become
    an official symbol. Reserving a place in Unicode seems a bit hasty.\r\n_____________________________________________\r\nPersonal
