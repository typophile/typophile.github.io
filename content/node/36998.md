  I have begun planning an exhibition on the theme of type design and national identity,
  1900-1960. I am pleased to report that we have a venue: the exhibition, \"Face the
  Nation: How National Identity Shaped Modern Typeface Design,\" will take place beginning
  next summer at the <a href=\"http://mnbookarts.org/index.html\">Minnesota Center
  for Book Arts</a>.\r\n\r\nI am now trying to round up objects to display that will
  convey the case studies I plan on having as parts of the show. Can you help? <!--break-->I
  am looking for offers to lend objects (specimens, other printed examples, type,
  matrices, etc.) related to:\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>GENERAL: typecasting and -setting
  technology 1900-1960\r\n<li>NORWAY: Gerhard Munthe, medieval letterform revivals\r\n<li>GERMANY:
  Koch, new blackletter designs\r\n<li>GERMANY: 20s sans-serifs: Futura, Erbar, Kabel\r\n<li>ENGLAND:
  Gill Sans\r\n<li>FRANCE: Deberny & Peignot sans, e.g. Bifur\r\n<li>SWITZERLAND:
  Helvetica, Univers\r\n<li>USA: Goudy\r\n<li>CZECHOSLOVAKIA: Vojtech Preissig\r\n<li>IRELAND:
  Colm O Lochlainn, new Irish/Gaelic script types\r\n<li>JEWISH DIASPORA: Hugh Schonfield,
  \"New Hebrew Typography\"\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\nI can give assurances about security,
  insurance, climate control, etc. All loans will, of course, be gratefully acknowledged
  on exhibition labels and the checklist.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance for any offers
  or leads you can provide. I appreciate the help, and I invite you all to come to
  Minneapolis next year to see the show."

    are currently closed down, so their exhibits (not that they ever managed to get
    much exhibited) are sitting around gathering dust but they do have a wealth of
    specimens, type and matrices, including a monowidth Gill Sans developed for timetables.\r\n\r\nTim"

    was never digitised and destroyed in a bombing during world war 2. I have never
    seen an actual sample but only reproductions. They would have to come from somewhere
    though. Let us know how you go. I would love it if you found some actual samples.
    \r\nAny found samples should really be placed in a museum here in Norway afterwards."

  body: "@Tim: Thanks for the tip.\r\n\r\n@Endre: Yes, my best hope for telling Munthe's
    story, I imagine, is displaying some of his earlier book designs that, though
    not made with type, document his interest in older regional letterforms."
