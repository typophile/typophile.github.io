    tell Lauren and Ollie I am flattered, even if I got itchy and scratchy due to
    cat allergy :-)\r\nThanks, poet laureate Linda, for your hairlines of verse--Yves
    knows where I am coming from on that one :-)\r\nHiroshige, yours takes the cake
    for biting sarcasm and Florian, that was just a scream! Chris Rugen gets the rimshot
    requested. Special thanks to my dear friend Andr\xE9 who will soon have his sans
    released.\r\nTo that OTHER old Fart Norbert, I about blew a gasket after seeing
    your old codgerism cartoon, dude! (my wife wanted to know who the young tart was
    though).\r\nGrazie, Lore and to Tiff, Patty, Haley, Sharon, and Tamye. Hi fivin
