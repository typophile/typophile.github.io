  body: There&#39;s another pay font like this, I think from the <BR>URW or Linotype
    collection. For some reason, it might <BR>have the word &#34;jelly&#34; in it.
    Or am I just hungry ? <BR> <BR>it&#39;s not jellybelly or whatever that image
    club font <BR>was called. If Jill can&#39;t find it, I&#39;ll do some searchin&#39;.
