  body: Nope. Not Myriad. See vertical stems of M and missing curved top of R and
    P. Not Frutiger or Foundry Sans either.

  body: Sorry Jan you are right, how about [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/bitstream/humanist-777/|Humanist
    777]] also designed by Adrian Frutiger!

    right. It\u2019s Humanist 777, Bitstream\u2019s version of Frutiger.\r\nGood catch."

  body: "Hi, Mike.\r\nHumanist 777 is based on Frutiger, but like many Bitstream interpretations
    it\u2019s not exactly the same. What made me think it\u2019s not Frutiger is the
    slightly too light weight (for bold) and the angled terminal of the \u2018G\u2019,
    basically.\r\n\r\nTop: Humanist 777 Bold\r\nBottom: Frutiger Bold\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Hum777_Frutiger_4109.jpg]"
