  (fair warning, it's a little slow) and remembered I never posted it on typophile.
  So here it goes, brace yourself for marketing copy:\r\n\r\nThe Harriet Series is
  a rational serif family. It\u2019s a contemporary reflection of the serifs popular
  in mid-20th-century American and English design. Harriet draws inspiration from
  both transitional faces, such as Baskerville, and modern faces, such as Century,
  at the same time it is unburdened by any particular historical model. The display
  styles give it just enough exuberance to sparkle while the diligent, sturdy text
  styles make it a true workhorse.\r\n\r\nThe Harriet Series was awarded a Certificate
  of Type Design Awesomeness (or whatever it's called) from the Type Director's Club
  in 2012.\r\n\r\nAvailable exclusively at Okay Type: https://www.okaytype.com/harriet/series\r\n\r\n<img
