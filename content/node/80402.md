  (postscript flavor) or TTF doesn't matter. On a mac baselines sit higher in the
  text box than PC. The flash devs are telling me this is a \"known issue\" with flash.
  But I'm wondering if there is something I'm missing in the Font Info panel in Fontlab.\r\n\r\nOr,
  if you'd suggest a workaround that wouldn't suck in a multi-platform team environment.
  (Ditching flash is not a workaround in this case, sadly)"

    \r\n\r\nTurns out it was not the font metrics or a mac/pc problem, but a dynamic
    text field bug when using shared runtime fonts in flash. Specifically if someone
    touches the field who does not have the font locally for preview. Nuke the fla
    and install the font on the offending machine for preview... fixed in the build.\r\n\r\nCheers!"
