  body: Top one has killer looks, but it might possibly suffer  <BR>from &#34;a tad
    too close to the armpit&#34; syndrome.  <BR>That&#39;s <a href="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/15095.html#POST30987"
    target="_blank"> what I meant</a> Hrant. <BR>Bottom one I like a lot too, but
    I&#39;m not sure if  <BR>everyone will &#39;get&#39; it.

  body: while 007 and 005 are really nice, they don&#39;t seem to address the rather
    course resolution of a T-shirt.

  body: 22.001/22.007 &#40;It&#39;s mislabeled 007. Doh!&#41; is definitely  <BR>among
    my personal top 10. I kind of think it suffers from  <BR>being somewhat overdesigned...
    I&#39;d suggest just printing  <BR>the back only. Maybe?

  body: Yves, you really should talk to a shrink about your armpit fobia.

    <BR>&#40;Mine tend to smell not so good when we come to the  <BR>encores after
    an hour of unrestrained rocking, maybe  <BR>that&#39;s why.&#41;

  body: i like 22.005. It has a design that would look strong from a distance but
    it also has some finer details that are saved for when you are up close.  Its
    not arrogant but its still in your face. I love the &#34;thriller&#34; style type.
