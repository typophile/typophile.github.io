  font is a geometric sans serif type family, but what makes it unique is that the
  condensed weights are straight-sided, not squished ovals like all other geometric
  type families out there.\r\n\r\nPlease pass the word along to your designer/type
  loving friends! I really want to be able to create this cool new typeface but without
  the funding there is no way I will have the free time to work on it.\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\nRichard

    given me the new one yet, so I can't pledge. But I'm tweeting it to my followers.\r\nGood
    luck!"

  body: "Nice project!\r\n\r\nOf note: Uniform is a typeface already, although it
    is custom and proprietary to UniformWares (the watch company). You can see it
    in use here: http://www.septemberindustry.co.uk/madebysix/\r\n\r\nUnfortunately,
    they seem reluctant to credit the type designer in the above mentioned portfolio
    showcase -- Micheal Hernan. \r\n\r\nIn this case I'm not sure if the name over-lap
    matters, but I thought you would like to know. I'm not sure if Mr Hernan will
    release this font one day due to licensing and other extenuating circumstances.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nTodd"
