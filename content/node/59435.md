  attachment to the glyphs.\r\n\r\nHere are some confusions I have regarding Cursive
  attachment:\r\n\r\n1. Do I need to define cursive attachment to all INIT, MEDI and
  FINA glyphs to all the other INIT, MEDI and FINA glyphs. (I think that is a lot
  of tedious work).\r\n\r\n2. What will happen to the marks attached to the glyphs
  e.g. will they move up with glyphs or stay in there place, potentially colliding
  with the base glyphs.\r\n\r\nPlease suggest links to any step-by-step detailed tutorials.
  I have seen all the material provided by VOLT site, but can't find the answer.\r\n\r\nI
  would humbly request Mr. John Hudson to write a detailed tutorial on cursive attahment
  in the context of Arabic fonts.\r\n\r\nThanks."

  body: "[Moderators : this discussion probably belongs in the Build forum.]\r\n\r\nFirst
    the easy part: in answer to your question 2, the mark positioning lookups should
    be ordered after the cursive attachment lookups (mark-to-base/ligature and then
    mark-to-mark positioning should always be the last GPOS operations). The mark
    positioning will be relative to the cursive attachment positions.\r\n\r\nHere
    is an image of a VOLT cursive attachment lookup for Arabic attachments:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/msatcurs_5026.gif]\r\n\r\nI've
    chosen the yeh_meem ligature for illustration purposes, since it has the most
    dramatic height adjustment in this font (MS Arabic Typesetting). Let's look at
    the image carefully, as the way VOLT handles cursive attachment positioning isn't
    very intuitive.\r\n\r\nThe first thing to note is that we're only defining \u2018exit\u2019
    attachment points, and the adjustments are all being applied to the second glyph
    (the left glyph in this case, since we're dealing with a RTL lookup direction).
    The values are positive, but visually the glyph in the GPOS window is moving left
    and down. If you have designed and spaced your glyphs appropriately, the dx ajustment
    can always be equivalent to the advance width of the glyph, which is helpful and
    saves time.\r\n\r\nYou don't need to define cursive attachment for all the initial,
    medial and final combinations in your font: only those that require something
    other than default positioning. However, note that any glyphs that do occur in
    the cursive attachment lookup must be provided with attachment positions to every
    other glyph in the lookup to which it might be expected to connect in text. Beware
    of stray default values within the lookup, as these will produce collisions and
    overlaps.\r\n\r\nAs you can see from this lookup image, it is possible to use
    glyph groups as you would for mark positioning.\r\n\r\nThis is somewhat less than
    a \u2018detailed tutorial\u2019, but hopefully it is helpful. Once one knows how
    to set up the VOLT lookup, the rest can be learned from trial and error."

    has boosted my moral, and I'm looking forward to dive into cursive attachment.
    I would request you to post a couple of other screen shots from the lookup you
    have shown, so that everyone gets a good feel of it.\r\n\r\nPlease explain the
    below statements in more detail.\r\n\r\n<em>You don\u2019t need to define cursive

  body: "If a glyph occurs in either the first or second glyph column in the cursive
    attachment feature, then you must define an appropriate exit attachment point
    for this glyph relative to all glyphs in the other column. You can't leave the
    dx and dy values for that exit attachment point at 0,0 because this will be interpreted
    as an exit attachment point with those values, not as default positioning. So
    to avoid more work than you need to do, only put glyphs in the cursive attachment
    lookups if they need to be there, i.e. if they need to connect to another glyph
    in something other than default positioning.\r\n\r\nI'm going to bed now, but
    I will revisit this discussion tomorrow. I will also bring this to the attention
    of Sergey Malkin, the VOLT programmer, who may have other advice."

  body: "Here are some more images, showing the stages of defining a cursive attachment
    lookup in an Arabic font. In illustration 1, we have created the lookup and defined
    it as a cursive attachment lookup from the drop down list of GPOS lookup types.
    This automatically creates the two column layout for 1st and 2nd glyph and the
    'exit' attachment point. We have also set the lookup display direction to RTL.
    At this stage, all the values are still at 0, and you see that the two glyphs
    are overlapping, this is because the values are saying that the exit attachment
    point at 0,0 is the same as the entry point.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/msartcurs1_5286.gif]\r\n_\r\n\r\nIt
    is helpful to remember that entry and exit are not directional concepts within
    the GPOS lookup. When designing Arabic glyphs, we may be thinking about them in
    terms of right-to-left connections, but just as all positive directions in glyph
    space are reckoned from left-to-right (and bottom-to-top), so entry and exit are
    reckoned in terms of left side and right side. So even though, from an Arabic
    script perspective the connecting stroke enters from the right and exits to the
    left, in VOLT we are actually defining an 'exit' attachment that is on the right
    side of the 2nd glyph. [I think I've got that right: it confuses me too sometimes!]\r\n\r\nNow
    here's illustration 2, in which we have defined the dx position of the exit attachment
    point. In this font, this is equivalent to the advanced width of the 2nd glyph
    (344 units), which is convenient. In other words, the glyph has been spaced so
    that the horizontal position of attachment point is directly on the right sidebearing.
    You see that when this is applied the 2nd glyph shifts to the left. In effect,
    you are saying that the horizontal position of the exit on the right side of this
    glyph is aligned to the left sidebearing of the first glyph, whose own dx value
    remains 0. [If you had not designed and spaced the glyphs so that they fitted
    together neatly when the sidebearings align, you would need to make many more
    adjustments to dx values for both 1st and 2nd glyphs, which gets very messy. In
    order to make cursive attachment positioning easy, it is important that the initial
    spacing be appropriate and consistent; this is also true, of course, for mark
    positioning and other kinds of GPOS.]\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/msartcurs2_4909.gif]\r\n_\r\n\r\nFinally,
    here is illustration 3, in which the dy coordinate has also been specified. This
    says that the attachment position is 508 units <em>up</em> on the right side of
    the 2nd glyph. So of course this means that the glyph shifts <em>down</em> relative
    to the first glyph.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/msartcurs3_5917.gif]\r\n\r\n-\r\n\r\nAlthough
    we are always looking at two glyphs together, and can scroll through the 1st glyph
    column to see the 2nd glyph in context of all 1st glyphs in the lookup, it is
    important to remember that there is only one exit attachment point on this second
    glyph. If you change the values when looking at one pair of glyphs, it will affect
    all the other pairs of glyphs involving the same 2nd glyph. In other words, cursive
    attachment positioning is similar to mark anchor attachment positioning, not similar
    to kerning pair adjustments."

    attachments are like mark anchor attachments: once you set them in one lookup,
    the values are inherited by any other lookup containing the same glyph in the
    same column. If you change the exit coordinates for a glyph in one lookup, it
    will also affect the same glyph in other lookups."
