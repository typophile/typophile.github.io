  body: It depends what it is, I guess. If it is important to impart an &#39;olde
    worlde&#39; flavour for a parcitular project, then go for it. If it&#39;s a bread-and-butter,
    everyday kind of job, then I think the discretionary ligatures look a bit achaic
    and in the way. General readers are simply not used to them and probably won&#39;t
    even know what they are.

    their original &#34;et&#34; ligature roots?'

  body: 'Isn&#39;t it about time to redefine what discretionary ligatures are? It
    sounds like maintaining even the most basic discretionary ligatures used to be
    a monumental task, and as such, little experimentation with additional ligatures
    was practically possible. <BR> <BR>But today with Opentype, I think inevitably
    someone will bring us new ideas about what discretionary ligatures should include.
    The first step could be to implement all the f&#43;ascender ligatures, ex: fh,
    fb, &amp;c. After that, why not move on to very common two character combinations
    of your target language? english examples: th, ch, ll, ed. Of course these new
    ligatures wouldn&#39;t be generally accepted but could be the thing to give that
    edge to magazines more indiscrete in their typography. Out of this experimentation,
    the more useful discretionary ligatures could be identified and implemented more
    widely. <BR> <BR>This seems to be one of those areas where typography could push
    forward and escape some of the tradition it&#39;s mired in. Why are &#39;ct&#39;
    and &#39;st&#39; the only standard discretionary ligatures? Shouldn&#39;t we have
    more?'

  body: When I discovered what I could do with ligatures and automatic substitution
    in OpenType, I nearly wet my pants. I&#39;ve been conceptualizing a face that&#39;s
    almost entirely ligatures, with many 3 character and a couple of 4 character composites.  <BR>
    <BR>My first attempt will be, most likely, a display face but a closely-related
    text face is a possiblility. The only problem I forsee with text faces is letterspacing.
    If you&#39;re opening up a bit to air out the paragraph, a ligature with its set
    width is going to clunk like the liberty bell. &#40;And no, I haven&#39;t stolen
    sheep in a long time.&#41; <BR> <BR>This may be the future of typography.

    automatically break ligatures apart if the text is tracked more than 20%. It would
    be nice if the user could set the tolerance.

    <BR> <BR>BTW, it would be even better if the <i>font</i> could set the cutoff.

  body: I&#39;m not sure, Hrant, you&#39;d have to play around in InDesign and see
    what happens. The &#39;20%&#39; figure was mentioned by David Lemon during an
    ATypI presentation a couple of years ago. I presume it means expanding the default
    spacing to 120% of normal.

  body: Yeah, Brennan, I read that just a couple of hours before in &#34;Stop Stealing
    Sheep and Find Out How Type Works.&#34; They say, &#34;We&#39;re not sure how
    &#39;black letter&#39; in this anecdote got changed to &#39;lower case,&#39; but
    we&#39;ve always know it to be the latter; whichever way, it makes infinite sense.&#34;
    &#40;page 7&#41; <BR> <BR>I also read it as lowercase in Bringhurst&#39;s book
    and had always heard it that way. <BR> <BR>Hmm... <BR> <BR>Graham

  body: I thought this was a ligiature post which need to be judged on a per-job situation.  <BR>
    <BR>But on the letter spacing issue, I don&#39;t have a problem  with letter spacing
    if it is done with discetion. The Goudy quote has always been &#39;blackletter&#39;
    and i think the modern mis-quote is redundant and somewhat disresectful. <BR>
    <BR>Plus after reading &#34;The Elements of Typographic Style&#34; &#40;Robert
    Bringhurst&#41;, I have had a lot of modern myths &amp;practices dispelled. <BR>
    <BR>One more thing though, i want to use Ligatures but my typeface is not an &#39;opentype&#39;
    font. Is there any sotware of plugins i can use?
