  body: "Awesome! Thanks so much for your help everyone. I'm creating a logo for a
    press club and my client loved the \"w\" in that logo and sent me a link to it.
    I also like that it's loose and informal so I thought I might give her some options
    with that font. It never occurred to me that it might have been created just for
    that letter.\r\n\r\nThanks again!"
