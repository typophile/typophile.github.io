body: "Hi -\r\n\r\nI'm maintaining a website designed by a third party that uses Macromedia
  Flash. When I open the .fla source file, Flash tells me that I am missing 2 fonts
  that are used in the flash object. It refers to the missing fonts as:\r\n\r\nAdobe
  Corp ID MinionBd\r\nAdobe Corp ID MyriadRg\r\n\r\nMinionBd font: I located the text
  using this font and according to Flash no bold or italic attributes have been applied
  to it. I went to www.linotype.com and I didn't find a font with this exact name.
  I did find a font called Minion Display Bold that looks correct. Could the MinionBd
  nomenclature be referring to Minion Bold Display? ... is that the same as Minion
  Display Bold? You can see typeface here:  http://www.mylep.com/partners.jpg  (I've
  also attached the image)\r\n\r\nMyriad font: I located the text using this font
  and according to Flash there is a bold attribute applied to it. In order to purchase
  the font, should I assume that the reference to MyriadRg is really Myriad Bold?\r\n\r\nThanks
  so much,\r\n\r\nSaratoga Sam"

  body: Minion and Myriad come bundled with Adobe Creative Suite. I think Minion Display
    might be a bit too thin.
