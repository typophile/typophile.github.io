  body: "The sun was setting just past the x-height of the horizon. Bodoni had been
    pressing on since daybreak, tracking was getting narrower, and he knew his bounty
    lay over the next hill. The bitter grit of ampersand was coating his throat, and
    he was thirsty for a resolution. At the top of the hill he looked out. All of
    Rosewood lay below him. \r\n\r\nA pica jumped out from behind a bush, startling
    him.\r\n\r\n\"A bit jumpy, ain't ya Serif?\" Bodoni turned to see Helvetica standing
    behind him, gun in hand. \r\n\r\n\"So we finally get to meet face to face.\" Bodoni
    had seen his type before. The rigid lines and smooth angles. Yea, Helvetica was
    easy to read, but so common he left no impression. The kind of man that lives
    a hard life, taken for granted. Growing up, he was probably cast away by the ladies
    in favor of new money, someone from a family like the Futura's or Univers's. Yes,
    Bodoni would have found Helvetica's appearance comic, sans the gun in his hand.\r\n\r\nThe
    two men locked eyes, measuring each other up. \"We have rules in these here parts.
    You can't just run around opening up the lead on any typeface you want.\"\r\n\r\n\"I
    didn't do it, Serif.\" Helvetica gritted his teeth. Someone was going to see a
    bullet before the sun sets.\r\n\r\n\"Why don't you come along quietly? No reason
    to make a big display out of this.\"\r\n\r\n\"That won't be happening. I got a
    large family to feed. You take me in and I won't get a trial of fair design. And
    with what you've accused me of, no lawyer would take my case.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't
    intend to take you in. You've been sentenced to the death, and I am here to watch
    you bleed.\"\r\n\r\n\"I did not shoot Caslon, and I'll be damned if your going
    to put my face on the murder!\" \r\n\r\nBodoni knew he could not match Helvetica
    for speed. He was a legend, but at the end of the day still the same old character.
    No, despite his popularity Hevetica would have to die if there was to be prosperity
    for the Bodoni family. Guilty or not, for too long the Helvetica's had run rampant
    in these parts. It made it hard for another man to find a purpose. Bodoni would
    have to open up first. Someone was going to take a bullet, and he couldn't leave
    Arial as a widow, not now. Killing Helvetica was right, justified.\r\n\r\nThe
    Serif pulled out his revolver quick as an em dash and squeezed the trigger. He
    missed wide, letting out a cursive as he dropped to his left. Helvetica fell to
    his knees and drew fast. Bodoni took a bullet in the neck and fell backwards.
    He rasped for breath, reaching for the gun that lay just a few points too far
    from his hands. \r\n\r\nHelvetica stared down at him, pity in his eyes. \"It didn't
    have to be this way. I may have shot you Serif, but I did not shoot your Century.\""

    else. I think it would make a great t-shirt, especially with Eds comment as a
    back line.
