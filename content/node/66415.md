  in Leipzig, where Dan Carr made some glyphs to demonstrate the craft of punchcutting.
  It was just beautiful, and gave me a better perspective, when I went to visit Ensched\xE9
  Type Museum a week after.\r\n\r\nI had a chance to hold in my hands the original
  punches of Didot Non Plus Ultra, and also the matrices made with them, and the final
  product: a catechismus printed in that font. The book was the size of a matchbox.
  I think that the type was between 2 and 3 points. Matrices were not individual,
  but instead they were made in single lines of text. Most impressive was the fact
  that I could easily recognize Didot even in that size and the rough paper.\r\n\r\nIt
  was made by Henry Didot somewhere after 1860, and was one his last works. It's too
  bad, that I could not bring my camera in the museum, because Ensched\xE9 is still
  printing money, so they are pretty pernickety about the rules\u2026\r\n"

    get a tour by Christian Paput of its various marvels, such as 120 pt as well as
    4 pt punches! Even more memorable was my 5-hour visit to Jim Rimmer's place in
    2008*, where the highlight for me was cutting a punch and striking it into brass.
    Jim was so gracious.\r\n\r\n* http://www.flickr.com/photos/48413419@N00/sets/72157622668087871/\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
