body: Is this even available anywhere?  It&#39;s part of a client&#39;s logo, I have
  no other characters available, WhatTheFont et al. found nothing, and I&#39;m about
  to go cross-eyed from browsing through lists of fonts...  Does anyone recognise
  this baby? <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/24850.gif"

  body: BTW, this was originally a freeware or shareware face. You may be able to
    find that version on line. I&#39;m not clear what the differences are, or on the
    legality of all that.
