body: "I have designed a novelty font with only square letters  that all flow into
  each other with horizontally and vertically with consistent spacing in either direction.
  There are no accents. Now I am trying to decide how to make the vertical metrics
  work across most software without too much trouble. Do I:\r\nA \u2022 Design the
  glyphs at 700 ems high so that they are easier for designers used to standard type
  heights and set very narrow vertical metrics that allow the type to just work when
  set solid. I am using this method with the UPM at 100 and a WinAscent of 718, WinDescent
  of -7, and TypeLineGap of 35).\r\nB \u2022 Jump up to 1000 unit high glyphs with
  appropriate vertical metrics so the design is more in line with the real height
  of most fonts.\r\n\r\nDoes it even matter, or am I just paranoid?"
