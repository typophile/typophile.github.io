  point me in the direction of any similar examples. I've found a few not quite as

  Also, how would you describe typefaces of this style, is it Art Nouveau style typography?\r\n\r\nSorry
  for the poor image - I've lost the original!\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/french_type_4428.jpg]"
