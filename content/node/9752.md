  <BR> <BR>and this one by Adam: <BR> <BR>&#34;Mac OS 9 and Adobe applications use
  Adobe software &#40;ATM/CoolType&#41; to render the Type 1 fonts. Mac OS X uses
  Apple&#39;s own ATSUI renderer. The most obvious differences are visible with hinting.
  Mac OS X displays some extreme deterioration of screen display of Type 1 font, which
  is &#34;ironed over&#34; a bit when the type is antialiased. But it&#39;s thoroughly
  possible that other aspects of the fonts, e.g. metrics, kerning, or special treatment
  of particular characters, is realized differently in the ATSUI model by Apple than
  in the ATM/CoolType model by Adobe.&#34; <BR> <BR> &#42; can I have more info about
  this issue &#40;i.e an article&#41;? <BR> <BR> &#42; Mac OS 9 and Adobe applications
  use Adobe software &#40;ATM/CoolType&#41; to render the Type 1 fonts....  - what
  about TT fonts? and Open Type? <BR> <BR> &#42; Mac OS X uses Apple&#39;s own ATSUI
  renderer. The most obvious differences are visible with hinting. Mac OS X displays
  some extreme deterioration of screen display of Type 1 font......  - what about
  TT fonts? and Open Type? <BR> <BR>Thank you!'

  body: OS X does its own new rendering thing with fonts of all formats. Whether or
    not this is a good thing depends on who you talk to. <BR> <BR>However, below that,
    it still has rasterizer code inherited from previous OSes, including Adobe&#39;s
    rasterizer for Type 1 / OpenType CFF that Adobe licensed to Apple. Either Apple
    has deleted/changed pre-existing code, or they are mostly doing additional processing
    to get to their end results. The distinction is a bit of a moot point, I suppose.

  body: '&#62; that is why I can run classic with OS X? &#40;I mean to use the &#34;old&#34;,
    classic fonts with OS X&#41; <BR> <BR>I don&#39;t actually understand the question
    here. Other than dfonts, which are just a repackaging of Mac TrueType fonts, there
    is no difference between &#34;old&#34; fonts and &#34;new&#34; fonts. The font
    &#42;formats&#42; haven&#39;t changed, but how they are supported has, and additionally
    Apple has changed how they are rendered &#40;which is a separate question&#41;.
    OS X adds support for Windows-style TTF and TrueType flavored OpenType. It integrates
    Type 1 and OpenType CFF support that used to require ATM as an add-on. <BR> <BR>I
    hope that somewhere in there I answered your question. <BR> <BR>T'
