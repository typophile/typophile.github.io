  wondering if anyone could help me figure out what type of don't or any similar fonts
  near this? \r\nI'm looking for the font in the title \"ZIG-ZAG\" [including the
  hyphen]. As well as the font for \"Qualite Superior\" which I believe is the same
  font as \"Braunstein Freres\" just the bottom lines seem they're just in bold. "

  body: "The picture of \"Zig-Zag man\" shows a 19th century French soldier uniformed
    as a \"Zouave.\" The French, British and Turks fought the Russians in Crimea in
    the 1850s -- an era when politicians were prepared to stand up for principle rather
    than to channel Neville Chamberlain and appease the Russian bully and aggressor.\r\nAt
    the battle of Sevastopol a Zouave's clay pipe was shattered by a bullet. So he
    rolled his tobacco using a piece of paper ripped from his gunpowder bag. Thus
    was born the filthy habit of cigarette smoking.\r\nThis package design is from
    before the era of digital fonts. The lettering of ZIG-ZAG is Victorian with median
    spurs, some Tuscan, i.e. fishtail, terminals on G,  and some ball ornaments on
    G and Z.\r\nThe package label is widely counterfeited and I expect that someone
    might have made a font based on ZIG-ZAG. But I didn't find it.\r\nFor the Tuscan
    aspect, there are crisp renditions as Pointedly Mad\r\nhttp://www.greywolfwebworks.com/fonts.html\r\nSaloon
