  But I need something atleast similiar, or something that has been adjusted to suit
  their logo.\r\n\r\nThanks a bunch!\r\n\r\nRobbie"

  body: "If you'll notice the 'o' and its to serif's/decorative strokes, on only the
    right side, the 'h' and its point reaching beyond the bottom line, aswell as the
    single storey 'a', it's obvious that more than half those fonts arnt similiar.\r\n\r\nAlso
    those two dots above the 'o', this is seriously hard.."

  body: "More particularly, you could search for 'fraktur' and 'textura' as these
    are the historical models for the majority of heavy metal lettering (why is that?).
    The m\xF6torhead logo has been extensively worked over, however, particularly
    in the way the m h and d angle away below the baseline, and quite possibly the
    h and the a have been borrowed from some other font altogether, so you won't be
    able to match it exactly with anything straight off the shelf.\r\n\r\nWhy not
    use Adobe Ironwood instead? Or, if you can find it, Cloister Black? Or go mangle
    up your own setting of Monotype Old English Text?"

  body: It's for a Type ID Index I'm working on for a university assignment, not for
    personal use. But thankyou anyway, hopefully I can find another record cover somewhere
    with a more distinctive blackletter typeface, as it's the last thing I need to
    cross off my list!
