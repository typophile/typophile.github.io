  \ ca. 1935 that is available for purchase today? Does it go by another name? \r\n\r\nI
  am also looking for a version of Butterfly Bold by Willy Schumann ca. 1927. Both
  typefaces were produced by the Schriftguss Foundry. If anyone has page scans, or
  maybe posted on a Flickr account I would love to see a more complete specimen.\r\n\r\nI
  have the small samples from the Encyclopedia of Typefaces, but would like the entire
  specimen.\r\n\r\nKind Regards,\r\n\r\nBL "

  body: "Hi Sans Sleep, \r\n\r\nyour versions of Aktuell/Penflow & Butterfly are not
    the same versions in the Encyclopedia of Typefaces. I'm not sure which is the
    proper one? Maybe a derivative? The ones you have definitely look more modernized.
    Your Butterfly looks more like Edwardian Script. \r\n\r\nBL "
