body: It bothers me to see letter forms with a 3-D or shadow effect mixed with letters
  that do not have this feature. Furthermore, I feel that if you are going to mix
  font sizes with these fonts, the depth of the shadow or 3-D effect should remain
  the same depth (rather than in proportion to the letter form). Does anyone else
  feel the same way, or am I alone on this?

  body: "I'll go along with that. I used to think 3-D and drop-shadows were the coolest
    thing there was (all my early fontplays used both effects), but along the way,
    I realized they cut down legibility, and didn't really do justice to the letter
    shapes, and that seemed counter-productive. Now they usually bug the heck out
    of me when I see them used by others. The only way I like a dropshadow now is
    when I don't really notice it.\r\n\r\nAlong with that, when I look at the fonts
    I bought years ago, I wonder what the heck was I thinking. "

    edges, fake small caps, and every other crappy instant gimmick around like water.
    On the upside, he is constantly derided for doing so.
