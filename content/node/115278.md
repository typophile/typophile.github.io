  the main title. The book combines training exercises with stories from the author\u2019s
  life. I\u2019m looking for a serif for the subtitle and author\u2019s name that
  complements Ex Ponto\u2014ideally, it would work for the interior main text as well.\r\n\r\nAny
  suggestions would be greatly appreciated.\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n"

  body: "Hopefully not an issue for you, but it does come up with bookwork -- One
    face you've chosen, Ex Ponto is an Adobe font family, so it's license likely covers
    digital publications -- either ePUB or pdf--as well as print. You'd have to check
    to be sure, but likely. It can even depend on the year you first licensed it.\r\n\r\nAgmena
    looks to be a lovely font family. Maybe, just maybe, I'll get to use it someday.
    But is from Linotype (now owned by Monotype).With the Monotype conglomeration,
    for any digital publication, you have to license (pay for) each separate font
    used (e.g., roman, italic, bold, etc), for each and <strong>every</strong> ebook
    <strong>title</strong> you produce using the fonts. This in addition to the \"desktop\"
    license needed for the print edition. For small publishers, this can be a factor.
    The publishers I work with --university presses -- now frequently instruct their
    designers to use only Adobe fonts purely for this reason. Saves a lot of bookkeeping,
    in addition to the extra cost. Such decisions come from management and the IT
    guys of course, not the designers. Sadly, they're higher up the food chain than
    designers.\r\n \r\nIt would be nice if the industry as a whole could come up with
    something like the ASCAP system (for music) for fonts, so the designers and even
    font publishers could get continual compensation. But until that time, the per-each
    use fees for fonts in digital publications, from <strong>some</strong> font publishers,
    are high enough to rule out their use without the designer checking with the publisher.\r\n\r\nEdit:
    This reaction by the management is so strong I sometimes have trouble convincing
    them it's OK to use a font licensed under the SIL OFL license -- which, of course,
    says anyone can do anything they want, no charge. Management and IT rule the publishing
    world, it's all about bookkeeping and metadata now..."

    an ebook edition for this title\u2014it contains a large number of photos and
    diagrams that won\u2019t translate well to that format. But I\u2019m sure I\u2019ll
    use Agmena for other projects, as well as other Monotype fonts, so I\u2019ll have
    to keep their expensive licensing requirements in mind.\r\n\r\nFor the horse book,
    we\u2019re using a coated paper, and based on what I read, the Agmena book weight
    will work nicely with that. I\u2019m excited to try it!\r\n"

    well to that format.</blockquote>\r\n\r\nDon't know what trim size you going to
    use, but it is probably largish? 8x10? 9x12? We've spent the last year looking
    at the feasibility of using pdfs rather than ePUB for digital books. The downside
    is you have to make about 4 different ones, to work well from the smallest phone
    to a larger 8-inch iPAD, or even bigger. \r\n\r\nBut making multiple pdfs is cheap,
    relative to the work needed for a single ePUB, depending on how much the text
    is woven into the images. The less, the better. Using liquid layouts in InDesign
    makes this relatively painless. Plus you don't have to worry about a pdf breaking
    on some devices (as any ePUB will), or some bizarre reader settings. With a pdf,
    you keep control, and can use that control to the best advantage.\r\n\r\nSo, assuming
    you don't have to pander to the phones, the entire size range would be something
    like from the Kindle to the larger tablets -- well, not as large as my 18-inch
    tablet, but say 13 inches. You could get by with one, maybe two pdfs. \r\n\r\nAnd
    if you ignore the 7-inch (diagonal) readers like the Kindle Fire, one of those
    sizes could likely be the print pdf, with different margins & of course, different
    ICC profile for the images.\r\n\r\nIt could well be a stunning digital book, done
    that way. \r\n\r\nWhy bring this up? Because commercial distribution of a PDF
    can also take you into the extra fee licensing situation.\r\n\r\n^ ^ ^\r\n\r\nBeen
    my experience that a coated stock can take a heavier font, say Merlo, and work
    well. However, with an uncoated sheet, IMSLTHO Merlo at anything over 10-point
    looks too heavy. On the other side of that coin, things can get too light with
    a coated sheet. Agmena, if it will have any issues (& I haven't seen it printed)
    will fall on that side. \r\n\r\nMy instinct tells me to carefully compare the
    regular weight with the book weight -- in the link below, the \"regular\" seems
    to be slightly heavier. Harder to judge the relative contrast though, and you'll
    also want the one with the least contrast.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.linotype.com/6951/agmena.html\r\n\r\nFor
    a coated sheet, I'd pick whichever is heavier, but without so much contrast the
    fine line are distressed.\r\n\r\nShouldn't be that hard to find someone who will
    send you -- or advise you of a library copy -- a  printed sample on a coated (probably
    matte coated) sheet.\r\n\r\nGood fortune with it."

  body: "A further thought...\r\n\r\nActually, when you think on it, there is no reason
    an ePUB has to use the same fonts as the print edition. You could well use Agmena
    for print and something else for ePUB -- or any digital edition -- if the extra
    licensing fees were an issue.\r\n\r\nThat said, if one plans on this <cite>ab
    initio</cite>, things could go more smoothly. One reason, perhpas, to bring back
    the old characters-per-pica data we used to have with fonts.\r\n\r\nFor similar
    sertwidths, Arno is close, and has a favorable license\r\n\r\nhttp://misc.iks-design.net/tag/Imprint:%20Print%20Magazine%27s%20Design%20Blog\r\n\r\nIn
    passing, I'm reminded again of just how good Minion is. If you owned and saved
    the old PostScript Multiple Masters Minion, much can be done."

      in case we pursue the PDF ebook option. \r\n\r\nYou mentioned in another post
      that you were disappointed with Arno on uncoated paper. Have you had experience
      with it on coated paper? We're using a matte coated paper (70#).\r\n\r\nI have
      several samples of other horse books. The text is generally too weak or too
      heavy, and I'd like to avoid falling into either camp!\r\n\r\nThanks.\r\n\r\n"

    Jovica Veljovi\u0107, offered these comments:\r\n\r\n\"I decided to incorporate
    subtle tone differences between Book and Roman. My concept was that Roman should
    be used for lined paper. Book is designed to work better on plain paper, in other
    words, on publishing paper. The other thought I had was that both could be used
    in combination, with Regular in the point sizes 6 to 8 to set footnotes and Book
    in the point sizes 9 to 14 to set the text.\"\r\n\r\nWhat does he mean by \"lined

  body: "<blockquote>In my view type for reading should be darker than what people
    generally consciously prefer these days.</blockquote>\r\n\r\nWe agree on something
    after all. Though as an interesting experiment, see if <cite>American Literature</cite>
    from the late 1960s - early 1970s is available in a library near you. As it is
    a MLA publication, it probably will be.\r\n\r\nIn that era, <cite>AL</cite> was
    set letterpress (by Heritage Printers), in Granjon. Lord, is it thin -- and this
    is true letterpress, the printing is from Linotype as cast. A good example, I
    think, of Dwiggins note that as papers and dwell impressions changed, the characters
    needed to be slightly redrawn to accommodate the changed printing and papers.
    \r\n\r\nAnd just perhaps that as the availability of printed matter grew, most
    of us who grew up reading \"hot metal type\" were really reading printing from
    either stereo plates, or offset, from repro pulled on a proofing press, then made
    into mechanicals, photographed, and printed lithographically. We were not truly
    reading \"letterpress\" printing.\r\n\r\nAnother factor, with photocomp & digital
    fonts, is one master size is used for a number of setting sizes. There is usually
    a size beyond which most digital text fonts just don't work well. More than a
    matter of weight, it is at least equally a matter of spacing, though weight is
    certainly a factor.\r\n\r\nFinally, a psychological factor: Likely there is a
    range of type weight that each generation reads whilst coming of age, and that
    seems to them to be correct. As I learned to read in the 1950s, I probably find
    metal type, with the weight achieved with printed from stereo plates or offset/repro,
    most familiar and natural.\r\n\r\nGiven all this, I still find Arno, printed on
    an uncoated sheet, too heavy for it's letterforms -- just like Merlo with any
    size over 10 point on an uncoated sheet.\r\n\r\nBut everyone has their own eye
    on such things, go and look at printed books. As they say, YMMV. But make this
    judgement by reading a sample, not by reading some reviewers report.\r\n\r\n"
