  body: Of course, there&#39;s <a href="http://www.linotype.com/6-1808-6/optimanova.html">Optima</a>,
    but that&#39;s probably not really what you mean by &#34;typefaces found on currency&#34;

  body: Technically, currency doesn&#39;t use typefaces at all. They are engraved
    &#40;except for the serial numbers and certain other elements&#41;. I don&#39;t
    know what the process is today, but at one time it was all done by hand with some
    kind of pantographic engraving tool to transfer and reduce the artwork to the
    plates. <BR> <BR>Some of the letterforms on currency look like familiar typefaces
    &#40;Copperplate, for example&#41;, so maybe they start from type in some cases.
