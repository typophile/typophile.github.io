body: "Hello,\r\ndoes anyone recognise this? It's the typeface used in the titles
  of the BBC series The Trip, starring Steve Coogan and Rob Brydon. \r\n\r\nNoteworthy
  are; the angles of the strokes in the uppercase generally, and in the foot of the
  R stem, the J with crossbar, the curl of the C, the proportions of x-height to cap-height,
  and the distinctive g. If anyone can help, it would be much appreciated, as it's
  driving me nuts and I've spent a good afternoon chasing dead ends. "
