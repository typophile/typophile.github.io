  \ and was wondering if any of you clever people could recommend a book on this subject.
  something that really goes in depth with the subject and shows/explains all the
  different typeface classifications etc.\r\n\r\nthanks in advance\r\nanders\r\n"

    from Linotype. It used to be free with every order - I got one hanging here, and
    it gives you a very quick overview how a typeface might be used. Like it very
    much.\r\n\r\nConcerning books, Elements of Typographic Style is a good one, I
    definitely would agree!! :-)"

    its in german. But very easy to understand 'cause you'll find enough examples.\r\nHere
    you can find approx. 300 more examples:\r\nhttp://www.bleisetzer.de/cms/front_content.php?idcat=41\r\n\r\nHere
    is another nice poster:\r\nhttp://cgi.ebay.de/Plakat-Schriftgiessereien-in-Deutschland-seit-Gutenberg_W0QQitemZ280114856927QQihZ018QQcategoryZ78238QQssPageNameZWDVWQQrdZ1QQcmdZViewItem\r\n\r\nAnd
    if someone tells you this would be old stuff:\r\nHow can you understand where
    you are going to without knowing where you are coming from?\r\n\r\nGeorg\r\n"
