  has got to be my favorite project at the moment. Seriously steppin' into the Goth
  side of life with this project, it's due out in limited numbers spring 2012 :) \r\nWorking
  with the fountain pen manufacturer, the main design challenge is trying to keep
  the barrel size as close to actual bone size as I can (redesign of standard cartridge
  seems to be required).\r\n\r\nIt'll be simply awesome when the pen (both ball point
  and cartridge) and pencil (mechanical) prototypes are done!! A detail I really want
  to pursue is to have the upper nob created in the shape of a crown, I think it would
  compliment the Gothness of it all :)\r\n\r\nThought I'd share...\r\n\r\n\r\n "

    Four Redheads of the Apocalypse. We have have books out with Yard Dog Press. I
    write the Death character -- and I so want one of these to do Redhead signings.
    We have a new book coming out in early 2012 - I know they won't be ready then,
    but I can't wait.\r\n\r\nDo you have a price point for them yet? I will start
    saving pennies now."

  body: "Four Redheads of the Apocalypse ... lovely!\r\n\r\nI'll get one together
    for you as soon as possible, shoot me an email: neil @ graphicdeclaration dot
    com, fair exchange if you could send me a couple photos of the pen in use during
    a book signing.\r\n\r\nOver the weekend I finished up the calligraphy model (with
    interchangeable nibs) ruff proto. Crazy cool dipping it into the inkwell and seeing
    the excess ink drip off the nib of the entire design.\r\n\r\nNext step is to nail
    (no pun intended ;)) down the cap designs...\r\n\r\nThanks for your comment! "
