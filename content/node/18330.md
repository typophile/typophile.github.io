body: "Hi there,\r\n\r\nWondering if anyone can identify any of the four fonts on
  display here, please? They're all from the Nuttelex factory in Melbourne, Australia.
  Nuttelex was first manufactured in 1932, but I don't know when the signage went
  up. \r\n\r\nIncidently, I posted the bottom one a while ago, but no one was able
  to name it. Thought as I was posting some new ones, I may as well try it again...\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n/stephen"

  body: "I did quite a search for the NUTTELEX typeface, and I couldn't find anything
    that had that stepped X. The bracketed vertical serifs on the E and T suggest
    a Clarendon, and my suggestion would be to use a medium weight Clarendon, with
    a modified E (remove the middle serif) and X (to step the legs).\r\n\r\nFor the
    script 'Solidified', this looks like a hand-drawn sign painter script that was
    made into an illuminated sign. A similar example is 'Blaze' from Art & Sign (signfonts.com)
    shown with other sign scripts <a href=\"http://bowfinprintworks.com/Script07Pg8.html\">here</a>.
    The style of 'f' is common in sign painting scripts for some reason, and that's
    what made me look at these.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

    body: "Thanks a lot for your efforts, Mike. Yes, it's quite a unique X. The only
      one I could find that was close was Clarendon Bold Expanded, so yes, I think
      that's a good place to start.\r\n\r\nThanks also for the links.\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n/stephen"
