  It reminds me of  Bil'ak's 'Fedra', or something by Luc(as) de Groot, or a little
  bit of Mark Jamra's 'Kinesis italic', but I have had no luck finding it. The 'f'
  and 'g' and the triangular serifs seem like obvious earmarks.\r\n\r\nThanks for
  your help,\r\n- Mike"

  body: "I have just finished hunting through the book 'Dutch Type' and a weird theory
    is forming in my mind. This looks like a slightly backslanted, and widened/flattened
    modification that started with <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/typotheque/fedra-serif-a/medium-italic/charmap.html\">Fedra
    Serif A Italic</a>.\r\n\r\nLet me explain my reasons, even though this will seem
    really funny if someone finds the font. Fedra has very distinctive foot serifs
    on its italic face, and they match this sample. It looks like the same serifs
    have been copied and pasted on the top of stems, like the p and m. A base serif
    was also added to the p. The triangular serifs on the ascenders might also be
    add-ons. Notice also that the 's' and 'c', as well as a number of other letters,
    are very much like Fedra Serif Italic letters. The biggest mismatches in this
    theory seem to be the 'f', 'g' and 'y', but I can see using the tail of the true
    'g' to make the ends of the 'f' and the new 'y' (made with a 'u'). The only re-drawn
    feature might be the tail on the new 'g'.\r\n\r\nIf I had the font I could try
    this, but does anyone think this seems plausible? Or am I just seeing things,
    after looking at too many type samples?\r\n\r\n - Mike Yanega"

    'i'.
