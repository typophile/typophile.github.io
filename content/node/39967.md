body: This should be mind boggling easy, but I just can't put my finger on it.  I'm
  a Mac user and this font is from a PC.  Can anyone help please, to identify this
  font?

  body: "Yes, you're right.\r\nI've looked up Calibri and I've found that it's a proposed
    substitute for Ariel, or at least it'll take over the old font as a desired choice
    by the masses.\r\nAs yet, I can only find it in TTF format, but no doubt will
    find a postscript version as the most horrendous price somewhere!\r\nThanks for
    your help."

    can count on the Ascender Corp to do that \u2026 :^/\r\n\r\nAnd Arun, I totally
    share your feeling. :^D"
