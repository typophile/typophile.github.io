  i can buy/steal/make/acquire for my graphic designer girlfriend for the holidays
  this year - any ideas?  i have already been through the Veer catalog, as well as
  some of the foundries, and a T-shirt is not really what i am looking for. something
  unique, beautiful, and made of or insipred by typography. It does not neccesarily
  need to be super cheap - id like to get her something nice. jewlery? handmade typographic
  clock? i am at a loss here.\r\n\r\nany thoughts?"

    and assign one to each hour (ransom note style). Or make all the digits in the
    same one. Or no digits at all -- assign letters and reinvent her concept of time.
    I'm sure she'll be into meeting you for a date at L:RC o'clock. Plus, making it
    yourself beats anything you'll find for sale at veer (sorry veer).\r\n\r\nThe
    best typographic gift I recieved was the \"CTS Photo display catalog\" (a phone
    book sized type specimen collection). Not the most obscure collection, but for
    graphic designers, seeing a face in print helps with type choice far better than
    screen previews. Plus, there's a perverse collection of swashes and unseemly ligatures."

    up for auction at ANY given time. There's something charming and captivating about
    these "artifacts," and they can make quite attractive decor as well. Of course,
    going the auction route is always hit or miss -- someone else may REALLY want
    that item that has caught your fancy but, as often as not, some real gems gets
    overlooked and can be had at a VERY reasonable price.

  body: "Re. Gill. Yes, a badly broken man in many, mostly sexual, respects. My friend
    Alan Wall described Gill's attitude as 'priapic adventurism', which I think is
    a fair assessment. To be fair to Gill, his diaries do indicate remorse over what
    he did to his daughters, and they for their part seem to have forgiven him and
    not ceased to love him. [One of Gill's grandaughters, Petra's daughter, lives
    in Vancouver, by the way, and sent me a very nice catalogue of the paintings,
    drawings and engravings that David Jones had done for her mother.]\r\n\r\nI was
    disappointed in the article to which Chris linked, since the author seems intent
    on using Gill's pedophilia and Penty's socialism -- which he clearly thinks on
    par morally -- to dismiss the distributist movement. In fact, neither Gill nor
    Penty were 'founders' of the distributism, as the article claims, and the economic
    philosophy was formulated in England by Chesterton and Belloc and based on Leo
    XIII's encyclical <em>Rerum Novarum</em> and other Catholic social justice teachings
    of the 19th and 20th century. What Gill and others tried to do was apply this
    philosophy in the particular context of rural communal life: a kind of Catholic
    back-to-the-land movement. The philosophy of distributism, particularly its dual
    critique of both capitalism and socialism, shouldn't be dismissed because of the
    moral failings of one of its advocates. [Also, as someone who has recently moved
    to a rural community and is giving a lot of thought to the differences between
    life here and in Vancouver, I think the critique of industrial urbanisation in,
    for instance, Fr Vincent McNabb's <em>The Church and the Land</em> has a lot of
    merit.]"

  body: 'Hrant, I think you might find very little to rebut in <em>The Stroke.</em>
    While some of what Noordzij wrote in the occasional pieces that comprise <em>Letterletter</em>
    may be taken as a kind of chirographic design advocacy -- although I''m not convinced
    that it is intended as such --, in <em>The Stroke</em> he is explicit in stating
    that what he is outlining is a way of analysing and describing what one is looking
    at in writing. There is almost nothing in the book about type design or typography:
    it is really presenting a new methodology for palaeography and other studies of
    specifically written forms that focuses on deciphering how strokes were made during
    writing rather than on the classification of the resulting letterforms. There
    is an adaptive functionality available to type designers from this methodology,
    that <em>can</em> be utilised to aid judgements that affect, specifically, uniformity
    or harmony of structure <em>as it contributes to the overall style of a typeface</em>.
    That is, it is a methodology that assists in aesthetic decision making, and is
    not intended or promoted as something that overrides or undermines other methodologies,
    whether focused on the aesthetic or functional aspects of type. Noordzij doesn''t
    even go this far -- this is my own formulation of what I find useful to my work
    in his analysis --; as I say, he barely mentions type at all.'

  body: "John, I do need to read the thing.\r\n\r\nBut you seem to again be invoking
    the \"GN doesn't prescribe, he describes\" escape clause, which I don't buy: he
    makes fonts in a certain way, and he has encouraged others to do likewise via
    the classroom. Of course, it's only natural for somebody to teach what he believes;
    but I hope it's also natural for people to look beyond the charisma and intelligence
    and see the anti-typographic emotions fueling the whole operation.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "You were talking about a rebuttal, specifically, to <em>The Stroke,</em>
    and this is what I think you will find, when you read it, a misplaced notion,
    because <em>The Stroke</em> is not a book about type design or typography. It
    is a much more narrow piece of work than <em>Letterletter,</em> which covers a
    broader application of Noordzij's theory. I think there is stuff in the latter
    to which your critique applies, but I think you will not find it so in <em>The
    Stroke.</em> It is a much less polemical work than <em>Letterletter</em> -- excepting
    when he briefly gets onto the subject of how reading and writing are taught in
    schools --, and basically consists of an analysis of a number of different stroke
    patterns <em>in writing</em> to determine how they are made and how to describe
    them. It is a book about looking at written forms.\r\n\r\nBecause Noordzij's books
    have been published by typography and design oriented publishers (Hartley & Marks,
    Hyphen) and he has taught in a type design programme, I think we are tempted,
    as a community, to presume that we are Noordzij's audience and that he is telling
    us something about how we should do what we do. But what strikes me about parts
    of <em>Letterletter</em> and basically all of <em>The Stroke</em> is that he directly
    addresses palaeographers and students of writing systems. If you drop the presumption
    that he is talking to type designers, and read the books as a critique of assumptions
    and methodologies in the study of the history of writing, I think you get a truer
    picture of Noordzij's engagement."
