  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>Excoffon’s Calypso now free for download!</p>
<p>During research for my book Letter Fountain many typefaces passed my eye. Most of them designed with meticulous precision and based on the knowledge of readability and technical perfection achieved in hundreds of years. But sometimes fascination strikes when a designer leaves the common path. Roger Excoffon was one of them and for me one of the most striking typefaces was Calypso, a typeface that has a terrible readability, and you can even ask yourself why it is made in the first place. Marcel Olive, owner of Fonderie Olive saw Excoffon experimenting with an enlarged print of a half-tone screen at Olive studio. He was rolling it up and looked through it like a kaleidoscope. A metal type with half-tone dots was not done before and a technical challenge to achieve. Marcel Olive saw the chance to profile the technical capabilities of his foundry and earn a worldwide reputation and gave Excoffon permission to execute the design proposal.</p>
<p>After establishing the angle and size of the dots by Olive Studio each character was drawn dot by dot using a pair of compasses. According to José Mendoza y Almeida, who lead the team at the studio, Excoffon made sketches of the outlines of each character and in the studio shading was added by airbrush. The airbrush shading was converted to a dot-screen that went from deep black to white. It was quite a challenge to transfer the drawings with a pantograph and to scale this complex drawings in different type sizes to the matrices. Then it had to be milled, retouched and casted in lead reproducing all the dots of the dot-screen. Calypso was cast in four sizes: 20, 24, 30 and 36 pt and had 26 capitals, a period, an apostrophe (used a lot in French), and a hyphen.</p>
<p>Most of the typefaces ever made have been digitized. Calypso was no exception. I found and downloaded Calypso Boy from Scootergraphics (Digitized by Marty Pfeiffer) and Calypso by Profonts (digitized by Ralph Michael Unger). Ralph Michael Unger has added numerals, a question mark, an exclamation mark, ligatures and a lot of other useful characters, making it a complete digital font. By comparing the capitals I saw that they where quite different and it seemed to me that they were based on the Calypso silkscreen-printed rub down Letraset version because the dots were not round like on the original drawings I had seen in several publications and advertising for this typeface.</p>
<p>Of course the original drawings were also not exactly the same as the metal type. As earlier written the punches that were cut by the Benton pantograph were retouched and because of that there were differences compared with the original drawings. So the final design had to be found in the actual cast type. I went looking for this type and found the site of D. Stempel GmbH that got the original matrices of D. Stempel AG and all the takeovers Stempel made during their existence. One of them was Fonderie Olive. I ordered a set of newly cast type from the original Olive matrices and found out that it was indeed quite different from the digital fonts that I bought. At that time Marjolein Koper was working as an intern at our design studio Polka Design and I asked her to digitize Calypso. The result was better than the fonts I bought but still I was not satisfied. After she came back to work at our studio on a steady base we photographed the metal type with a Micro Nikkor on a D800 to get the sharpest enlargement we could get. With this pictures Marjolein established the exact angle of the grid and we decided to begin again from scratch. Although it still is not an exact reproduction of the original metal type it has more detail and it can match almost the big reproductions seen in the first advertising in the French printers’ yearbook “Caractère Noël 1957” and recent publications with original drawings. You can download the result of our effort free on our site as TrueType font for Mac and Windows: <a href="http://www.letterfountain.com/extras_e.html">http://www.letterfountain.com/extras_e.html</a> 
Please tale advantage of this utterly useless font in your work and send me some results!</p>

<p>In the picture you see above left the original sample of the &lsquo;C&rsquo;  from the Calypso from 1960 in the yearbook Caractère Noël. Below right you see our version. The other two are existing digital fonts from 1997 and 2005. Above the 24 point metal type our version is based on. Of course together with other sources that show original drawings and enlarged type.</p>

		<div class="commentbody">Today I received the yearbook Caractère Noël from 1957. In this yearbook the first advertising came out for the Calypso. Calypso was launched in 1958. The yearbook of course was published also in 1958 but the work shown in the book should be dated 1957. Enclosed two pictures from the advert, one with a transparant page in front. Probably the airbrushed and shaded &lsquo;C&rsquo; was the original for this character on which the dot screen was based.<img src="/images/old-images/Caractere57_3_LR_4915.jpg" alt=""></div>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Very impressive. Your dedication is commendable! And that photo of the metal version is amazing. BTW did you try scanning the original (maybe after inking the face) instead of photographing it? I would think the latter method would introduce parallax. And what was the effective resolution of the photos?</p>
<p>BTW, a side question: do you know whether Monotype (via Linotype) now owns the rights to Calypso?</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>We did not scan it. I think that inking (or like they did it in earlier years blackening it with a candle) would not make a better image but I did not try it. We have corrected the pictures parallax and because we made a grid (look at our YouTube video) and the fact that this grid fitted on each character we presumed that we corrected the parallax. The Micro Nikkor we used is not a zoom lens so has not much deformation in the lenses so I think that it is quite accurate. The Nikon D800 has a 36 megapixel resolution and is by that almost a scanner (almost 100MB files). You have to remember that the drawings by Almeida where of course made by hand and so was also the following of the contours on the pantograph done by hand. So in that stage there is also some inaccuracy. I think also that their goal the mechanical look was and not a handmade look. We considered to scan it on our Epson V750 Pro which is also a top scanner but also works with  lenses (deformation). My other consideration was that you can create shadow and a sharper difference between side and top of the metal letter with photography while a scanner does not create shadow because the light source is almost where the scan unit is.</p>
<p>I think that Monotype has officially the rights after Olive, Haas, Stempel, Linotype and Heidelberg. But the Profonts Calypso was also not published by Monotype (and the Calypso Boy was also a private project). When Monotype makes a better one I will take it of the website of course. The only goal is to have a proper and usable Calypso.</p>

		<div class="commentbody">Don&rsquo;t get me wrong about the legal rights of intellectual property. All the fonts we use in our commercial projects of Polka Design and Fontana Publishers are bought and licenses are paid. The making of the Calypso is a tribute to Excoffon and has to be seen like that. The license holders have had more than twenty years to publish a good digital font but decided, I think on commercial grounds, that it was not interesting enough to do so. On the other hand I think that the legacy of Excoffon and Almeida is important to the typographical community and for young students that have to be confronted with the mind set of designers like Excoffon.</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>It is a complicated discussion about licenses and intellectual property. There are always two parties involved. One is the holder of the rights and one is the maker of the work and his or her heritage. Just like paintings and other art the common opinion among collectors and museums is that you may buy a work of Van Gogh for several millions but you never own it. You pass it through to the next generation and you even have the obligation to take good care of it. Some time ago a Japanese businessman had put in his will that he wanted to take his painting of Van Gogh with him in his grave. Legally it was not possible to do so because of the reason stated above. It was public heritage. I think that Excoffons work belongs to our graphic heritage and that it has to be excessible for study and use. Preferrable by the rights owner of course.</p>
<p>You are right John. There are still some design flaws in our Calypso. Anchor points can still be reduced and there are some overlaps. We will make the font better in the coming time but I think that this still is a big step from what we had. We tested it and we had no problems with it.</p>

<p>About the copyright of the typefaces from Olive, I found info in the book &lsquo;Roger Excoffon et la Fonderie Olive&rsquo;. On page 67 the following is mentioned: Haas did not obtain the copyright for the typefaces but was granted the permission to cast selected typefaces. Therefore Olive sold the casting machines, pantographs, matrices and 100 tons of typefaces to Haas. Until his death in 1990, Marcel Olive retained control over the rights of the typefaces. He granted several foundries the non-exclusive reproduction of typefaces. Among them: Bobst, Compugraphic, Itek, Mecanorma, Letraset, Hewlett Packard, Linotype, Agfa, Adobe and Scangraphic. This information is said to be found in the archives of Marcel Olive (as mentioned in this publication).</p>

<p>I think, if a design has overlaps, the only format with overlapping contours legal in the spec, is TT. Removing overlaps in a design like this to assure correct PS output could introduce distortions in scaling.</p>

<p>Why scale down? You can do an OpenType font with PS outlines and leave the PPEM at 2048. FF DIN Round has a ppem size of 2000 units/em. During testing it in 2010 one of the PDF-Writers made a mistake because the programers had forgotten to look into the FontMatrix. They had simply assumed that TT-flavoured OTF is always 2048 and PS-flavoured OTF is 1000 units/em. Luckily they took notice of this and updated their PDF writer. AFAIK, FF DIN Round has never caused any trouble ever since. Adobe also produces Arabic OTFs with a ppem-size of 2048 units, so there are at least two manufacturers which took care that the pavement has been cleaned. So my advice is to stay with PS outlines, remove the overlaps and avoid scaling trouble by sticking with the ppem-size of 2048 units/em. I think that users who import your outlines in Illustrator will appreciate that too.</p>

<p>AJ, I did not suggest scaling the em in the development process. My comment was related to the scaling done during use, which is as likely to be down as up. So, go back and think about the removal of overlap when not required, and what that would do to hundreds of previously perfect circles, now conglomerated into point lumps, then scaled during use.:)</p>

<blockquote>BTW is the assumption that a TT font must be 2048 rarer than the assumption that a PS font must be 1000?</blockquote>
<p>From my anecdotal evidence, yes. TTF seem to work anywhere with any upm (allowed are 16—16384)*. For a typeface like Calypso I’d have gone for at least 4096, because you can see in the 1000 upm version the circles can’t be constructed very faithfully.</p>
<ul>
<li>There are some issues in Word on Windows with high upm + high coordinate values (very wide glyphs), the font smoothing is disabled in this combination.</li>

<p>Hello Hrant, my answer to that I gave before: &gt;I think that Excoffons work belongs to our graphic heritage and that it has to be excessible for study and use. Preferrable by the rights owner of course.&lt;
As long as this is not the case our effort should serve the ones who wants to study and use it. However, I understand the point you are making ;-)</p>
<p>As suggested I tried to scan the metal type on a resolution of 4800 dpi to see if it is better than the pictures that I used made with the Micro Nikkor and Nikon D800. The scan is sharper but does not give more detail. I think because it is already an enlargement and I have reached the (lack of) sharpness of the casting.

Maybe you get some loss from punch to matrix and from matrix to letter. It could also be that you loose some sharpness when a lot of letters are made in the same matrix. But I think that Calypso is not cast in the same quantity as Times New Roman :-)
I will look at your links. Shortly I will get also a Letraset sheet with a 72 pt version of Calypso. I hope that I still can rub it down. I will make some pictures of it as soon as it arrives!</div>

<p>I don&rsquo;t know - type metal molecules are pretty small.  :-)
But of course there were/are coarser limits in the production process. What&rsquo;s the coarsest limit, the pantograph? BTW what point size was the metal type you used?</p>

<p>Several manufacturers were in the habit of handing out promotional souvenirs with the Lord’s Prayer engraved on a single 6-, 8-, or 12-pt em square, cut with a Benton punchcutter and cast as a type sort, as a demonstration of technical prowess. I’ve heard of these from ATF, Monotype, and Linotype. There may have been others.</div>

<p>So I took some measurements in Photoshop and the smallest visible feature in that sort on Flickr (which I think is the closed counter of the &ldquo;A&rdquo;) is about 0.7% of the Em. If the Em there is 4mm that comes out to just over 1/1,000 inches. So twice the resolution that Giampa states in that other thread. But still much coarser than Joep&rsquo;s scanner or camera.</p>
<p>Now, 4mm is about 11pt - presumable it was actually 12pt. If they did go down to 6pt that doubles the resolution. However we don&rsquo;t know if things like the counter of the &ldquo;A&rdquo; survived at 6pt. And 2000 dpi is still less than half the resolution Joep is working with.</p>
<p>Also, it&rsquo;s possible they used an especially thin cutter for that project - so thin as to break too often to be practical for real work.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Thanks for posting those pictures of highly accurate pantographic punch cutting demos. I&rsquo;ve never seen those and miss Benton&rsquo;s dearly. I&rsquo;m sure it was the best in field.</p>
<p>Hrant &ldquo;David, if anybody&rsquo;s guesswork is wrong please explain how it&rsquo;s wrong, so we can learn. And -as Joep reminds us- the Olive foundry had a technical advantage over its competitors &quot;</p>
<p>Is that required, no matter how ridiculous the guess, or how persistent the insistence?  and, is Joep &ldquo;reminding us&rdquo; of a fact, or a claim?</p>
<p>So, let me put it this way — the &ldquo;exactly the same way&rdquo; above means drawing negative (wrong reading), patterning positive (right reading), punch cutting negative, matricing positive, type casting negative, so one can be printing positive.</p>
<p>The first three steps, where a pantograph may be used without recklessly abandoning economic sense, are only constrained by the required result, not the tool. The Calypso producer had access to the final design, (per letter), in the drawing, the patterning, and the punch cutting. So, some letters might have been drawn exactly to the punch, and others you would only recognize completely as a punch.</p>
<p>But ultimately there is not restriction on what a skilled one with a hand tool and zoom capabilites could do to the punch. This has been discussed several times here.</p>
<p>I think, you were suggesting that they drew Calypso positive, patterned negative, skipped punch cutting, and cut thousands of matrices directly via an undisclosed direct matrix cutting process that left the face clear? Is that it? Besides showing me the shape of the cutting head, Why? What would make a founder abandon a normally barely profitable process as it was, for a rare display face they could do the exact same way as everything else with no apparent problem?</p>
<p>Believe it or not, Hrant, there is nothing unique in the history of type, to be found in Calypso except for Calypso itself. There is no little space, no little shape, and no mystery combination of them that had not been punch cut before, though in different combinations than those that yielded Calypso.</p>
<p>Hope that helps.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>You&rsquo;re not <em>required</em> to educate. But assuming that everybody but me knows all the answers is irrational. And I don&rsquo;t see how my guesses are &ldquo;ridiculous&rdquo;; they&rsquo;re based on my years of listening to experts and my -limited- experience using a pantograph (at Rimmer&rsquo;s studio). Could I be wrong? Duh. But guessing is all I can do, and &ldquo;ridiculous&rdquo; is mean-spirited hyperbole. That said, I do appreciate you taking the time to explain your thoughts.</p>
<p>I chose the word &ldquo;remind&rdquo; carefully. Do you think Chamaret, Gineste, Morlighem and Rault are all wrong to trust their sources? If not, what <em>was</em> that technical superiority?</p>
<blockquote>there is not restriction on what a skilled one with a hand tool and zoom capabilites could do to the punch.</blockquote>
<p>The diameter of the pantograph&rsquo;s cutter is a restriction. Did they not use one? If you&rsquo;re saying they cleaned up after the pantograph (like that one guy in the Tetterode photo at the end of that thread I linked to) wouldn&rsquo;t <em>time</em> be a restriction? There&rsquo;s a reason that guy ended up losing his job&hellip; And remember that Excoffon was all about speed, for example producing Banco in two months.</p>
<p>Using a pantograph to directly cut a matrix (without making punches) is not mysterious; it&rsquo;s something little ol' me has done under Rimmer&rsquo;s guidance:
<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/48413419@N00/4099731186/in/set-72157622668087871">http://www.flickr.com/photos/48413419@N00/4099731186/in/set-72157622668087871</a></p>
<p>What I&rsquo;m suspecting is there was some kind of twist to the conventional production you describe in order to get Calypso&rsquo;s sharpness of both inside and outside corners. But I admit I haven&rsquo;t yet taken the time to fully wrap my head around that idea. Luckily being wrong in public is the fastest way to learn!</p>
<blockquote>cut thousands of matrices</blockquote>
<p>Why thousands?
And why would the punches be far fewer? It&rsquo;s not like any design element in Calypso can be reused.</p>
<blockquote>there is nothing unique in the history of type</blockquote>
<p>Unless we&rsquo;re using a contrived definition of &ldquo;unique&rdquo;, I don&rsquo;t buy that at all. Even if we&rsquo;re limiting it to manufacturing technology, there have been periodic inventions that have qualitatively changed some aspect of the result. The invention of the pantograph is an obvious big example; it caused the demotion of optical scaling (no matter how hard the Bentons tried to educate people).</p>

		<div class="commentbody">Hrant, Jim cut matrices rather than punches because he was making small amounts of type for his own use, used a display caster that took a particular kind of thin brass matrix, and lacked the machinery for finishing punched matrices. His workshop process was a craft one, not an industrial one. A commercial foundry producing type in volume for sale would need mechanisms to produce multiple matrices, which is where the punch comes in: it provides the master that you only need to cut once, from which you can produce any number of matrices. The largest number of matrices would, of course, be required for hot metal systems, in which the matrices were the font. But even for foundry type you&rsquo;d want to be able to produce more than one matrix for each character.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Nice that Hrant mentioned Jim Rimmer. Sadly he died in 2010 but Richard Kegler from P22 made a fantastic film of his work before he died and released it in 2011: <a href="http://www.p22.com/products/makingfaces.html">http://www.p22.com/products/makingfaces.html</a>
With the film comes a metal type of a &lsquo;k&rsquo;. Its production can be seen on the DVD. Buy it! You can also see in the film the principle of working with a pantograph. I compiled some pictures (stills from the film) so you can see the process. In the first picture you can see the stages from hand drawn original to an outline made in Ikarus software, a cut out original for the pantograph, an engraved matrix half the size and a matrix (copper) that is again made from the first matrix that is fifteen times smaller. In that small matrix he has cast the &lsquo;k&rsquo; that can be seen in the last picture photographed from the metal type that is supplied with the DVD. I have visualised some stages (not all) so you can see the process. In the second picture from below you can see on the left the guiding pin and on the right the engraving tool that is very sharp and  that can make very detailed engravings. However you can also see the toolmarks it leaves on the surface of the casted metal type below. When he had made a punch he could have smoothened the surface and the result had been smoother on top of the metal type. This is the &lsquo;lack of sharpness&rsquo; due to the mechanical process I talked about before. It has also influence on the contours of course and not only on the surface.

		<div class="commentbody"><p>John: AFAIK you only need to make multiple sets of matrices if you&rsquo;re selling the matrices (and not just cast fonts). Did Olive sell Calypso matrices? I thought that sort of think was limited to punchcutters who didn&rsquo;t cast their own type (and yes, hotmetal necessarily). But I can certainly appreciate that Rimmer&rsquo;s production was not industrial-grade.</p>
<p>And/but here&rsquo;s the thing: Do you think a Calypso punch could have been producible with the conventional method (which is what I&rsquo;m presuming Olive&rsquo;s competitors were stuck with, hence couldn&rsquo;t have made Calypso). Aren&rsquo;t the details (which as Craig pointed out are at both the &ldquo;positive&rdquo; and &ldquo;negative&rdquo; sides) too fine/labor-intensive to have been made by a pantograph + manual cleanup only at the punchcutting stage? Maybe it was done at <em>two</em> stages - one positive, one negative?</p>
<p>The main things I&rsquo;m after:</p>
<ul>
<li>Is the claim that Olive had some critical technical advantage bogus?</li>
<li>What could have been the &ldquo;resolution&rdquo; limit of Calypso?</li>
</ul>
<p>Joep, nice stills.</p>
<blockquote>This is the 'lack of sharpness' due to the mechanical process I talked about before.</blockquote>
<p>But -as John implies- how much of that could have been the case at Olive?</p>

<p>And in the unlikely event someone is making commercial type without punches, then how many matrices would they need? The type wouldn&rsquo;t even need to leave a foundry to become unsupportable without punches with less then 3-4 sets of matrices, just for Paris.</p>
<p>&ldquo;However you can also see the toolmarks it leaves on the surface of the casted metal type below.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Oops, i see the router bit too. That ain&rsquo;t workin', its not the way one normally does it, even if one is forced to.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And remember that Excoffon was all about speed, for example producing Banco in two months.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Really strange for a guy on speed to design a font like Calypso. You have proof that he was always on speed, or was it just on the way to the Banco?</p>

<p>So David thinks that Olive had no technical advantage over its competitors that made the production of Calypso anything special. I think that&rsquo;s entirely possible. But that does mean: some people, somewhere, lied; and the authors of the two recent Excoffon books (not to mention a bunch of other previous authors) were duped.</p>
<p>David also thinks that Joep and I are wrong that Calypso might have had a &ldquo;resolution limit&rdquo; (at least below the scanner/camera used) even though a pantograph was -presumably- used (which is only done to save time, and not cleaning up after it saves more time). This I find harder to agree with.</p>
<p>You heard it here first, thanks in large part to my ridiculous, persistent insistence&hellip;  :-)</p>
<p>So, as an aside, I have to wonder what&rsquo;s worse: My willingness to have my catalytic speculation be misconstrued as &ldquo;insight posturing&rdquo;, for the sake of learning more stuff faster? Or the fact that most people only share their insights for proving others wrong?</p>

Don&rsquo;t bother me, I&rsquo;m trying to figure out if &ldquo;Tide gets clothes cleaner&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Sooo&hellip; You think a revolutionary founding invention so remarkable as to make Calypso possible, died with Olive. He had no interest in selling it, or licensing it, or doing anything but burying it. He didn&rsquo;t even patent it. And at the same time, companies like Linotype, Monotype, Stemple, and every other foundry in the world knew from the advertising, but said, &ldquo;Okay, whatever&rdquo;.

		<div class="commentbody"><p>No, I just think there might be something we might take for granted now that Olive had but its competitors (remember, post-war France) didn&rsquo;t. Could it have simply been the pantograph? Dunno. The alternative is your liars and dupes. Which, like I said, is not impossible. But that idea wouldn&rsquo;t have come out -in public- without both of us. Appreciate that. And hope that the Excoffon/Olive aficionados will take note and react.</p>
<p>I do have too many interests to be able to follow through with enough of them; most of all it&rsquo;s hard to make money with cultural progress - as I&rsquo;m sure you can attest yourself bringing home the bacon usually involves much more boring stuff (coincidentally as Excoffon himself once said). But I wouldn&rsquo;t trade too many interests for too few. And I wouldn&rsquo;t trade publicly contemplating ideas for making yet another font that a corporation can use to dupe people into buying its junk. This is partly because that&rsquo;s just how I&rsquo;m made (which means there&rsquo;s no use criticizing it - I&rsquo;m not criticizing your make-up or life goals); but also because it&rsquo;s not just about me, it&rsquo;s about us: I give people ideas (and I appreciate receiving them).</p>

You don&rsquo;t make real money selling it, you use it to sell the normal stuff more. Like the Audi R8. Calypso&rsquo;s weak market penetration actually reinforces the view that it was mostly seen as a way of flaunting Olive&rsquo;s -now disputed- technical superiority. At least if you buy into the generally accepted idea that Marcel Olive was very good at gauging sales potential; because it could simply have been a flop&hellip; and maybe that&rsquo;s when they invented its halo as its raison d&rsquo;être!  :-)</p>
<p>Henk, nice to see you back! Question: is there a way to measure the smallest feature of that Tetterode sort? It would be nice to figure out what was the smallest pantograph cutter that they/people used. Is Giampa&rsquo;s claim of 1/500 inches accurate?</p>

<p>The idea of Calypso as a technical showpiece makes sense to me: it&rsquo;s surely a typeface of limited application &ndash; how many jobs would call for such a design? and after it had been used a few prominent projects, would anyone else want to use it? these are the problems of all strongly flavoured display types &ndash;, but it&rsquo;s visually so impressive and its materiel so unlike anything else that compositors would be handling. Perhaps this is where &lsquo;technical superiority&rsquo; lies, not in any superiority of technique or process, but simply in being able to say &lsquo;Look what we can make that no one else has made&rsquo;.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>John, here&rsquo;s my translation* from Rault&rsquo;s book: &ldquo;Marcel Olive, a commercial genius, commissioned it not because of its aesthetic attributes but because at that time only the Olive foundry had the technical means necessary to create such a typeface with hatched surfaces, making it a global benchmark for such a venture.&rdquo; So no detailed explanation, but a pretty firm claim, especially coming directly from a straight-shooter like Excoffon. Marcel Olive, I would expect to &ldquo;embellish&rdquo; the facts for appearances - but not Excoffon.</p>
<ul>
<li>For reference here&rsquo;s the original French: &ldquo;Marcel Olive, qui avait le génie du commerce, me le commanda non pour ses qualités esthétiques mais parce qu’à cette époque, seule la fonderie Olive avait les moyens techniques nécessaires à la conception de ce type de caractère, avec ses surfaces tramées ; lequel devenait alors une référence mondiale pour son entreprise.&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
<p>If the above is true, it goes beyond the simple &ldquo;design novelty&rdquo; that you&rsquo;re -understandably- speculating. Another reason it was probably not merely design novelty is that those foundries were notorious for copying each other&rsquo;s ideas: we would likely have seen something like Calypso produced by Olive&rsquo;s arch-rivals D&amp;P soon afterwards, but there&rsquo;s nothing. So maybe Olive produced Calypso because it was beyond being copied.</p>
<p>Pantograph limits: From what I know its use in type was particular enough that I&rsquo;m not sure I could trust any generic/official numbers. For example a manufacturer might say they have a 1/4000 inch cutter, without realizing/admitting that it would be too brittle (and maybe too labor-intensive) for type production; I remember breaking a not-particularly-small cutter at Rimmer&rsquo;s studio (although of course most of that was inexperience). Plus we&rsquo;re talking about pantographs 50+ years ago; I have to assume precision and materials have improved. So I think it remains that asking people here (and probably on ATypI) is a potentially fruitful avenue.</p>
<p>Mark, what&rsquo;s the most elaborate such design? But here&rsquo;s the thing: ATF was not in France.</p>

<p>Yet here you are, trading ideas about a font company that made a font they can use to dupe corporations into using it to dupe people into buying, believing, or understand junk.</p>
<p>Mark: &ldquo;Surely those were at least as detailed as Calypso&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure there are plenty.</p>
<p>The width of the smallest router used is the tool&rsquo;s limit, but not strictly the limit of the process. In some versions of the process, touch up a six-pattern, a punch, or ten punches, or all the hairlines of the U.C.  patterns. In other versions of the process the router was twice the end, as the &ldquo;success&rdquo; of the process was judged by getting from one letter drawing to several sizes of patterns and or punches without any manual intervention other than adjustments to the pantograph, and following the drawing and  the pattern dutifully.</p>
<p>These latter fonts usually were not such great junk, but they were being used primarily for smaller size junk in more insideous mass media duping, like newspapers, magazines and other free press activities. But the longer a Merg-like junk producer had to futz with the process, the closer they could get to better junk like Benton&rsquo;s. So by the time of founding of the font in question on this thread, most big founders were capable of many different qualities of junk, using a variety of possible duping processes.</p>
<p>Clearly, underlying all of this is that we are discussing a founding period not far removed from a war France had begun as an horse-powered, fort-seeking, agricultural nation, and ended understanding that they had to be on the road to the high tech nation they are today, or get clobbered every 20 years by a gas-powered, blitzkrieging, industrial &ldquo;neighbor&rdquo;. I think maybe there was no invention here other than there were few better ways to say, &ldquo;We&rsquo;re back&rdquo;, than Calypso.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Joep, thanks for that photo. I&rsquo;ll take some measurements now&hellip;</p>
<p>David, you know very well that my speculative efforts concerning an archaic production process (with the goal of understanding it better) will not help anybody sell anything; I contrast such stimulating cultural activity with ho-hum financial activity (with everybody striking a different personal balance between them).</p>
<p>You might have reason to think Excoffon was lying; I instead suspect -that&rsquo;s all- that we are still missing a piece of the puzzle (which might simply involve a deficiency among Olive&rsquo;s competitors rather than an exceptional technology at Olive). The most practical way to reveal this potentially missing piece is what I&rsquo;ve been doing.</p>
<blockquote>The width of the smallest router used is the tool's limit, but not strictly the limit of the process.</blockquote>
<p>Indeed, and that&rsquo;s something I&rsquo;ve referred to (for example via that Tetterode photo) a few times here. However once people have started paddling down the pantograph river they have often given up on using their oars for small course corrections and simply gone with the flow, even when they could tell the output was being visibly degraded. So you could call it the &ldquo;spiritual limit&rdquo; of the process; and that&rsquo;s where the minimum -viable- size of the pantograph&rsquo;s cutter stands up from the crowd of other factors (when it comes to nailing down Joep&rsquo;s &ldquo;(lack of) sharpness of the casting&rdquo;).</p>
<p>As for Calypso being a &ldquo;we&rsquo;re back&rdquo;, I think by that time: the French had already rebuilt their confidence, and developed their -sometimes grating- &ldquo;we don&rsquo;t need to prove anything to other people, they need to prove it to us&rdquo; attitude; Mistral -and other designs- had already done all the necessary proving, with foreign font houses eagerly licensing it.</p>

<p>I highly doubt they only used punches for Calypso - there are too many things stacked against that possibility. They probably used some sort of pantograph (in fact maybe that constituted the Olive foundry&rsquo;s technical superiority that allowed the production of Calypso) and the limit there was the size of the cutter (which IIRC is on the order of 1/500 inches for the smallest one*). What&rsquo;s interesting here is that a pantograph&rsquo;s cutter is circular&hellip; a perfect fit for Calypso! No loss of &ldquo;resolution&rdquo; due to the size of the cutter, <em>if you cut directly into the matrix.</em> However I&rsquo;m not sure how the &ldquo;shearing&rdquo; of the circles (by the swooping curves) would end up working in such an approach&hellip; Maybe there was another step (actually there might have had to be two, two back to &ldquo;negative&rdquo; after a &ldquo;positive&rdquo;) before the matrix.</p>
<ul>
<li>They used bigger ones for clearing out large patches first (without breakage) then switched to a small one for details.</li>
</ul>
<p>Related: <a href="http://typophile.com/node/1083?page=1">http://typophile.com/node/1083?page=1</a>

<p>Letraset: Do you have to rub it down to scan/photograph it? BTW another angle might be phototype - did Calypso ever have a photo version?</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m guessing the French foundry scene was a small world. Plus he was good at &ldquo;espionage&rdquo; - here&rsquo;s another passage from Rault: &ldquo;We learned that the Deberny &amp; Peignot foundry was preparing a new advertising typeface by Jacno. An article with a photo showing Jacno drawing his alphabet had appeared in a trade magazine. I’m going to be honest: I carried out industrial spying – I took my magnifying glass and examined that photo as carefully as possible. The print quality wasn’t very good; nonetheless I formed an opinion on the alphabet style.&rdquo; But I certainly agree that it&rsquo;s not all clear enough.</p>

<p>Apparently not. The claims that were made about this font, were not made about those fonts. The previous fonts had been design problems,  while Calypso was a production issue from the sketches to the printed page, you see. And, as we&rsquo;ve covered, no other use, patenting, sale or further claims were made about any technology or process or any other use on any other font&hellip; ever.</p>
<p>“So you could call it the &ldquo;spiritual limit&rdquo; of the process…”</p>

<p>Good point.</p>
<p>However your &ldquo;proving themselves&rdquo; speculation remains quite incongruous, at least when it comes to doing so on a national level; what does make sense is that Olive wanted to market its superiority to D&amp;P (so on a local level, which does not jive with what you opined).</p>
<blockquote>the limit was a real value to be minded in the design process</blockquote>
<p>Sure, on a theoretical level. On a &ldquo;spiritual&rdquo; (hence eventually practical) level, once the pantograph is saving you effort, it quickly starts seeming inefficient to combat what the pantograph &ldquo;wants&rdquo;. This is something the Bentons quickly discovered: as much as they tried to educate the customers of their systems that having a large number of masters (each for a narrow size range) was important for quality, their customers preferred to save as much time/money as possible; after all, readers weren&rsquo;t complaining&hellip; Eventually even ATF itself gave in to that.</p>
<blockquote>loaded with a published article and a magnifying glass, he decided which founder to work with?</blockquote>
<p>?
That was about Banco. And he was already an Olive employee (in fact one with a controlling interest). Plus AFAIK he never worked with any other foundry (except for his -aborted- final effort).</p>
<p>My point was that Excoffon was not a hermetic, insular designer; in fact he was highly active on all fronts of French type and graphic design. So John&rsquo;s &ldquo;How did he know?&rdquo; seems to have a highly probable answer: he was paying attention. This BTW is something Rault&rsquo;s book does better than the one by Chamaret/Gineste/Morlighem (which <em>is</em> however a fabulous effort): it conveys superbly what made Excoffon tick (allowing one to make better speculations).</p>
<p>BTW it seems that your goal has become to aggressively doubt every single thing I say. OK, let&rsquo;s try this one: Font Bureau makes some great newspaper fonts.</p>

It measures 10 pt with the Lords Prayer. The dutch version has 380 characters. So it is smaller and has more characters than the one from Haas. Tetterode made 13 metal types for the smallest book in the world (in 1951) that contained 6 intro pages and the Lords Prayer in 7 languages. The page size was 5 x 5.3 mm. The engraving was done during the night because Tram line 3 in Amsterdam caused trembling during the day that could influence the engraving by the pantograph. The book and metal type is still available at the Gutenberg Museum in Mainz. Many thanks to Henk for sending me the metal type and the nice story that came with it.

		<div class="commentbody">Letraset sheets were printed using silkscreens, but the silkscreens were of course produced from films. The production method may have gone through several stages, but at a certain stage, the films were produced from red masking films (such as Rubylith by Ulano) which were either cut by hand or by a plotting machine. I recall a small booklet which describes that production process, also colleagues reported this after having visited Letraset in England. Around 1983, Letraset switched from cutting by hand to Ikarus, which meant that the artwork was digitized and corrected and then output on the aforementioned plotter, typically an Aristo flat-bed plotter. Of course the film cutters tried to compete with the machine output for some time … In the case of Calypso I think that the film cutting part has been left out. I think the characters were printed on baryte paper, then photographically enlarged, retouched and then again films were used to create the master film from which the  films for the sheets were produced. Anyway, there is no reason why a former Letraset typeface should show screen outlines.</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Albert Jan, What I mean is that a line in silkscreen has always a jagged edge (I hope this is good English!). I don&rsquo;t see that jagged edge on the Letraset sheet. On the pictures the most recent limited edition Slanted (Cuba) packed in a wooden cigar box with photocards and some silkscreened cards. The one I enlarged is situated at the top (the wing of the bird). You can see in the enlarged part almost which screen is used to print. I do not say that you are wrong but I am curious which screen Letraset used. After all the original film that is used to expose the light-sensitive layer can be as sharp as a knife but always the screen will be visible because it stays as the carrier of the exposed layer. Or do I make a wrong assumption? -Joep</p>

From the catalogue for the <em>This Is Tomorrow</em> exhibit in London, 1956, designed by Edward Wright.

<p>Joep — I should think that, in general, the degree to which evidence of the screen might remain would have a lot to do with the viscosity of the ink and the absorption of the paper/substrate.</p>
<p>In the case of Letraset sheets, this was certainly no ordinary ink (and probably plasticized). It needed to cover relatively thickly and remain somewhat flexible, and it was not absorbed into the substrate, obviously (otherwise, how would it transfer?).</p>
<p>I can imagine — and this is pure speculation — that with enough viscosity, any effect from the screen could have disappeared as a result of surface tension after the screen was removed.</p>
<p>Whereas, in an example like the postcard you showed, with thin ink and absorbent paper, edge effects from the interaction of the screen with the mask are more likely to remain evident as the ink sets almost as soon as applied.</p>

<p>Kent – so you think that the material they printed was like an oil stain that formed from itself a fluent edge. It is of course an explanation that the jagged edge is gone that is normal with silkscreen printing. I thought that there was a possiblity that it could be done with offset and a special ink but Albert Jan Pool said earlier that Letraset was silkscreen printed. He mentioned also that it probably was printed first with lead type (or maybe phototype?), in the case of Calypso at a maximum size of 36 pt and then enlarged with the repro-camera to 72 pt. That is why it isn&rsquo;t as sharp anymore because the original was printed type. I thought that they would work from the original artwork (or a copyproof of it) and had it reduced to 72 pt with the repro-camera.</p>

<p>I think that has been the case. Concerning Letraset, this is what I heard through other people. In the mid-eighties, an older silk screen printer in The Hague showed me some of his old stock of larger ‘wet-transfer’ letters that had been produced through silk screen printing. He also told me that it would be rather easy to produce such letters oneself. As far as I remember, the letters did not show rough edges. He told me that this kind of transfer letters had disappeared from the market because of the dry-transfer system and the headline phototypesetting systems. The advantage of the headline machines is that they could produce headlines in almost any typeface and size needed, whereas wet-transfer letters were only available in a limited range of designs and sizes.</div>

<p>You are right, even when one would stay with ppem 2048, removing the overlaps would cause a lot of extra trouble. I have seen TT fonts with overlapping outlines (Ccedilla) causing incorrect (PS?) output though, so at least some testing and a closer look at rendering methods might be useful in order to get a clearer picture of the pros and cons.</p>

		<div class="commentbody">Karlgeorg Hoefer (father of Linotype&rsquo;s Otmar Hoefer) was one of the lead type designers in Germany. Like Excoffon he was very much interested in handwritten type. A typeface that he made in 1965, called Zebra, could be influenced by Calypso. It has the same boldness and the gray parts are not translated to dots like Calypso, but are drawn as thin lines. Typical is also that Linotype did not make a digital font of it, maybe just as with Calypso for commercial reasons. So also there is a similarity. In 2007 P22 made a digital typeface based on the original drawings. A statement you can find on the site of P22:  “Hoefer was, and remains, the king of brush lettering in Germany. Nobody even came close”, seems also to point at being the German counterpart of Excoffon. 
Check out the site of P22 (<a href="http://www.p22.com/terminal/hoefer.html">http://www.p22.com/terminal/hoefer.html</a>) and the site Otmar Hoefer made for his father&rsquo;s work (<a href="http://www.kghoefer.de/English/KgHoefer_Typefaces.html)">http://www.kghoefer.de/English/KgHoefer_Typefaces.html)</a>. -Joep

		<div class="commentbody">Hrant asked what the resolution was of the pantographs Tetterode used to create &lsquo;The Lords Prayer.&quot; 
The answer is: &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo; 
I started at the Lettergieterij Amsterdam in 1963. At that time the management saw that letterpress would be replaced by offset and hot metal typsetting and manual typesetting by photocomposition. In 1963 LA sold Morisawa and Intertype fotosetters. The importance of the type production was decreasing and the transfer from the old artwork to photocomp artwork just started. Later on LA/Tetterode produced artwork for a.o. AM, Berthold, Film-Klischee, IBM, Intertype, Linotype, Compugraphic, Bobst, Letraset, Mecanorma and the ATF-Hadego Photocomp System. The ATF-Hadego artwork was prepared by ATF, Tetterode and Hadego.
Most of the manuals, most of the artwork and all the Tetterode typface specimen books are now part of the Tetterode Collection. That is part of the &ldquo;Bijzondere Collecties&rdquo; of the UVA University of Amsterdam.
See <a href="http://www.bijzonderecollecties.uva.nl">www.bijzonderecollecties.uva.nl</a> 
It&rsquo;s in the same building where Warren Lee has his famous book store!
I will try to find an answer on your question.</div>

Such could have been applied to relatively soft, blank working metal, then the counters etc., removed, and sterotypes made. This method, of putting the lines down ﬁrst, would have made it easy to ensure that all the serifs were the same number of lines, and the overshoots were integral. Does that make sense?</div>

<p>Imagining they were sick of hand work by then, and with the semi-industrial revolution on them, I think they would do anything to &ldquo;mechanize&rdquo;. I&rsquo;m pretty sure they knew the dimensions of everything before they started cutting — so, my guess would be they cut the letters on the punch first, or locked up type in a chase A-Z, e.g, and then repeatedly rolled or dragged a jig bearing 19 incisor points along the chase, incising the whole set  of punches as the jig above moved along the line. A screw or two could control the depth of the cut, they could proof in place, change incisor depth, type and width, rotate 45 degrees, have a ball, show the boss later when he was in the mood to find out you modified some of his stuff, a little.</p>

That it was not always done with such craftsmenship one can see in the 1827 specimen from Laurent et De Berny (At that time owned by Honoré Balzac). The lines and white spaces are very irregular. Although I think that this was wood type and not metal type. In the specimen this is not mentioned specifically.

		<div class="commentbody">Or maybe it was done by using a more inventive approach. When you take lines and stack them you can easy cut out a letter. See the illustration where I layered two characters of the Figgins type on top of a line specimen from 1827 by Laurent et De Berny. Of course you have to define the right thickness of lines and white between them.

		<div class="commentbody"><blockquote>He mentioned also that it probably was printed first with lead type (or maybe phototype?),</blockquote>
<p>Please do not mix up design and production methods for artwork with the production methods for the Letraset dry transfer sheets. I did not mean to say that the sheets themselves have ever been produced from metal type. In some cases, the artwork for the typefaces was based on baryte prints from metal type. This method was not exclusive to Letraset though, the artwork for many typefaces from the photocomposition era was based on baryte prints, which were photographically enlarged and then retouched. Scangraphic has done some typefaces that way and late Bernd Möllenstadt, the former type director of Berthold, told me a few months ago that the Berthold type studio also has been using this method. They even had to work this way for typefaces from their own library because in WWII the Berthold type foundry had been bombed and many (if not all) matrices had been destroyed. At the beginning of phototypesetting, the only access they had to many of their own typefaces was through printing offices that had Berthold typefaces in their type cases.
Concerning phototype setting in the process from artwork to the sheets: I recall someone telling a story that (at least for some years) phototypesetting was used for the production of the films from which the screens for the sheets were produced. After the artwork for a typeface was completed, a 2,5 Inch film font was produced from the artwork with the use of a ‘step-and-repeat’ camera. The 2,5 Inch font was then used to manually phototypeset the artwork for the films (with a machine like the [[http://www.flickr.com/photos/kupfers/8318050188/|Berthold Staromat]] or a [[http://www.flickr.com/photos/albert-jan_pool/8596990195/|Dr. Böger Copytype]]) for the various screens. They had to produce about as much films/sheets as there were sizes to be made available. The production of the 2,5 Inch font was an extra production step, but ‘typesetting’ the artwork (line-by-line) was faster than accurately mounting all letters individually.</div>

We have to consider though that for a producing foundry the matrices are the most important part when it comes to being able to keep the business alive, so that is probably also the main part of the story that is being told. For designers, it might be more interesting to (also) look at things such as punches, sample letters (for the spacing), artwork, pattern drawings and settings for the engraving machine.

<p>After comment from John Hudson we reworked the design of Calypso the last couple of weeks. So we removed anchor points, cleaned paths and we looked at every character and reworked it again by looking at material we received recently.</p>
<p>Because the generated .ttf fonts still showed a lot of deformation we decided to make a PostScript (.otf) font –that gave better results and less deformation– with a base drawing of 1000 pt and we generated a TrueType (.ttf) font at a base drawing of 2048 pt (em-square). The otf is 179 KB and the ttf is 322 kb so for larger text amounts and headings that are less than 100 pt the .otf should be good enough. For large display purposes the .ttf font should be better.</p>
<p>The download of the TrueType font has the same name as the previous font so you should replace it before using.</p>
<p>Below in the picture on the left the first design and deformation caused by generating the first TrueType font. Our original drawings had perfect round dots. On the right the reworked TrueType font based on a 2048 pt drawing in the font software. The detail is the above left part of the &lsquo;T&rsquo;.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I found interesting information about Calypso at Skyline Type Foundry that seems to have matrices from Dimension, a copy of Calypso. According to him it are rip offs that were probably made in Japan for Chas Broad&rsquo;s Typefounders of Phoenix. He further writes: &lsquo;Interestingly, they are all stamped with the name “Calypso” except the 48pt, which is stamped “Dimension”. We cast and offered the 24pt in March of this year, and it was a colossal dud!&rsquo; (It is not strange that the 48 pt is not stamped Calypso because the biggest size from the orignal Calypso was 36 pt –Joep)
Before they were bought by Sky they were bought by Los Angeles Type Founders (LATF) from Typefounders of Phoenix. Below page 4 of the &lsquo;Antique Types&rsquo; (not dated) specimen by LATF. Interesting is also that they offer also figures that were not included in the original Calypso. I asked today Rainer Gerstenberg who has the original Calypso matrices but he writes that there are no figures available from Calypso. Were they made in Japan?</p>
<p>It is funny that as you can see the D, N, B and C are upside down. How that could happen I don&rsquo;t know because you can&rsquo;t do it like on the computer. Maybe they were delivered to the (Japanese) engraver on film and that he took the wrong side of the film copying them?

In the 55th Anniversary Edition of the standardwork Encyclopedia of Typefaces from Jaspert, Berry and Johnson the Calypso also is present on page 258. This is a reprint of the last revised fourth edition of 1970. In this picture also some strange things happened. In the first row the K is forgotten but the B, C, D and N are correctly printed. However, on the second row something strange happens with the G and H!

		<div class="commentbody">Today we make our Calypso complete with ornaments (in French ornements). These ornements where also presented in the 1958 specimen of Calypso. On the fourth page (back page) a number of ornaments where printed. I have never seen them on the market or know of special made matrices. It can be presumed that they where made by turning the metal letters. It would have taken some work to position them in metal type. So now we made a font of the characters presented on this first specimen. We made it easier to type them because we have positioned the characters in the middle of the cap height in the ornement weight of the font.
The TrueType ornement font (also based on 2048 pt design) is now included in the download. An example of the characters is also included as PDF. The typing is easy: the counterclockwise rotated character is placed under the uppercase key and the clockwise rotated one under the lowercase key. Some characters like K and A are placed normally and under the uppercase key they are rotated 180°. The second L (that is normal) is placed under the bracket key and the rotated version you can find under the other bracket key.
Have fun!

Maybe that number is referring to the mechanics, without factoring in the thickness of the cutter? I&rsquo;m pretty sure the cutter was the &ldquo;resolution bottleneck&rdquo; since it was prone to breakage (plus the smaller cutter you use the longer the work takes).</p>

		<div class="commentbody">I think that you must separate two things. Accuracy is something else than making the smallest detail. As you can see below (in the drawing) you can work with different tools. One tool on the left to make the large flat parts. That tool can be large as well and flat at the bottom with a large diameter. The other tool has a sharp point and gets thicker to the top to make it a stable working tool without to much vibration and with enough cutting capacity. With this tool you get a bigger radius when you go further into the material. You see on the small engraved metal letters from Tetterode with a whole text on a 10 pt letter that they are not deep engraved to reach this detail. When you engrave deeper as done on the second picture below you have to sharpen the corners manually as you can see in this picture where a machine engraving gets the finishing touch.

		<div class="commentbody"><p>A picture shows more than 1000 words. Here some examples of engravers cutters. You can see in the table on the right that the tip diameter can be extremely small (0.001 inches). Depending on the diameter of the shaft it can quickly get bigger. So I guess that for removing the biggest shunks they used a big cutter and for the detailed work where you had to remove less material a cutter with a small shaft. I think that the fact that you had to rework the punch or matrix was for a lot of German typefounders the reason why they began to use the pantograph engraver much later than in America. In America around 1893 and for instance Berthold began to use it in 1910. They had the idea that the letter got a mechanical look and you still had to finetune it after engraving. It was more the idea of craftsmanship that played a big role. It is the same as in around 1986 when typesetters and graphic designers had the idea that typesetting on the mac was not as good as the other (also digital) forms that where used on the Linotronic, Scangraphic etc. More a mindset than that it was reality.</p>

		<div class="commentbody">To show the difference between hand engraving and machine engraving I made two pictures. The first is a picture from the book &lsquo;Souvenirs brouillés du Palais typographique&rsquo; with photographs from Olivier Doual from the material of the l&rsquo;Imprimerie Nationale in France, published by Des Cendres. You can see that the counter of the letter on this punch almost looks like it is shoveled out. And it is &hellip;
<img src="/images/old-images/DesCendres_S_6359.jpg" alt="">
In the second picture a detail of the 36 pt Calypso where you can see the huge difference in machine engraving. All surfaces are smooth and even and you can see also that the smaller details and dots are engraved less deep to keep as much the sharp corners you want. You can also see the conical angle of the tool in how the diameter of the dots grow to the base.

		<div class="commentbody">Hrant– What I learned during this process was that mechanical is better than on a computer! Of course you can draw perfect dots in Illustrator (or Freehand) but in font software your grid only has 1000 pt in the normal situation. So the software forces anchorpoints on the available grid and almost no dot is round anymore. That is why I had to choose the 2048 pt grid that would create a much to heavy font for use in large text books for example. You maybe can&rsquo;t get it out of your printer or at least a lot slower. For a font like Calypso that is used only for headlines this should be not a big problem. However, also in this large version, when you would blow up the letter you will see deformation because it still forces the anchorpoints to the 2048 pt grid. With a normal typeface that has almost never perfect circles this is not a big problem but you will always have some lines slightly of your initial drawing.
So what is the nice conclusion of this, just because you have no restriction with a grid: MECHANICAL IS BETTER</div>

However, I found it a relieving thought that sometimes things were not so bad in the metal age. It was a lot of work composing even a single page but sometimes in the fast an even faster layout and print culture of today (when you want even alltogether in a single day) you maybe can believe that people with or without an burnout begin to look back to the time everything had to be checked three or four times before getting it on paper because it had to be perfect.

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Yes of course Hrant. All over the planet metalworkers prove what you are saying. Our aluminium cases of our Imacs, Macbooks and Ipads are made with computers that control CNC machinery on a high level of accuracy.</p>
<p>But with fonts we are not talking about a certain simplicity in construction that is mostly the case with metal work. I talk about the PostScript language that has to translate all information on a page in 1 and 0 digits to the printers were a limit is in memory and the deformation begins. I think that you also have had problems in the past when you made an Illustrator drawing with to many anchorpoints. When your printer has not enough memory to store the description of the PostScript file it will simply not print. I have had it several times and sometimes changing the printer brought some relief.
And that has always been the heel of Achilles (I hope in English it is a good statement) of computer generated pages. And that is why the grid in font software is restricted to a certain amount of points. So you get a distorted letter like in my case with the Calypso on a 1000 pt grid. Because the mechanical method has no grid restriction it can be exacter than the digital font. Of course other things like worn bearings or shaking of the hand that leads the pantograph can bring distortion but in theory it is is more precise.
Look again to my magnifications of the metal type and enjoy the detail &hellip;</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>To complete my story about Calypso I ordered a set 24 pt and 48 Pt Calypso/Dimension at Skyline type Foundry who took over the matrices of Typefounders of Phoenix as I wrote before. I thank Sky Shipley for his quick shipment and his efforts to find the 48 pt metal type he had and which was ‘old stock’ and was casted by Charles Broad when it was still Typefounders of Phoenix.
As you can see in the pictures below the 48 pt version of Dimension is actually the same as the Olive Calypso 36 pt, which was the biggest version Olive produced in metal type. The 24 pt version of Skyline is actually the 20 pt Olive version. So I prosume that the range 20, 24, 30 and 36 pt of Olive became 24, 30, 36 and 48 pt in the Dimension version. The 48 pt was not mentioned in the brochure I showed before.
It is not as strange as one can think. The Didot point used in Europe was 0,376 mm (0,0148 inch) and the Pica point used in the US was 0,351 mm (0,0138 inch). Not to confuse of course with the computer pica which is 1/72 of an inch. So the body of the metal type of 36 pt from Olive is 13,54 mm and the metal body of 36 pt in the US is 12,64 mm, So about 1 mm or 0,0394 inch less high. So the 36 pt does not fit on an American 36 pt metal body!
As you can see a part of the 48 pt metal body is not used. Also the Dimension ‘N’ is upside down. I placed it upside down to compare the form and dots better. As you can see the detail is a lot less than the one from the Calypso.
The second picture shows the ‘A’ which is not upside down (compare with the ‘N’). But here some creativity was used on the cross bar of the ‘A’ by engraving an extra line.</p>

		<div class="commentbody">Here another picture taken from the side. I think that the copy is not made by electrotype but by etching from a (copyproof) film that is taken from printed matter. I think that that is why there is a lacking in detail and deformation. I think that you can see it also at the convex cone beneath a dot at the Dimension on the right. The Calypso on the left is much more the result of mechanical engraving I think. As i said before etching could also explain the flipping of some characters. What do you think?

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Also as a completion of this thread an overview of three versions of Calypso that you can get at this moment (leaving out the Calypso Boy and the metal version from D. Stempel/Olive). The Skyline box sticker contains all characters of the Calypso/Dimension in metal type available. On this sticker I placed a red dot at the characters that are flipped. In the digital version of the Profonts Calypso only one character is still flipped as mentioned also before in this thread. Note also that Unger made an alternative version for the zero. In the Skyline version it is the same as the ‘O’. The 1 is a flipped ‘I’ both with Skyline and Profonts. The 4 had no eye in the metal version of Skyline and looked quite dark because of that. Unger made it a better match. Also the 6 in Ungers version is better in my opinion than the metal version of Charles Broad (Skyline). Although I think these additions are not matching in even grayness with the alphabet Excoffon created at Olive. I think you can see that clearly on the box sticker of Skyline.
The shown version of Unger is not complete and has more signs and diacritics than I have shown in the picture below. A complete character set can be seen on <a href="http://www.linotype.com/search/Calypso#6abad67f4cff65a7aa3a8f0bf4f162c6">http://www.linotype.com/search/Calypso#6abad67f4cff65a7aa3a8f0bf4f162c6</a>
In have no full printout of the metal version of Olive Calypso so I could not complete the pictures below with that.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Although I closed this thread for myself a week ago I today received a specimen that I could not resist to place on this forum. It is called Mr. Antique Volume 10, Ornate &amp; Antique Type by Typefounders of Phoenix. I earlier showed a similar colored specimen by Los Angeles Type Founders that took over Calypso/Dimension matrices from Typefounders of Phoenix.</p>
<p>The type specimen shown here is probably from the early sixties. The information on page 2 says: &lsquo;These type faces are from the early 19th Century from the Old Type Foundries of &hellip;&rsquo; followed by a list of American type founders like Bruce, Barnhart, Dickinson etc. Olive is not mentioned in this list but beneath every specimen the former foundry is mentioned.
As you can see in the picture beneath the Dimension is written: &lsquo;A French Styling of the Late 19 Century&rsquo;. As we know the Calypso was a new design by Excoffon from 1958 so it was only a couple of years on the market when Typefounders of Phoenix made a copy. Together with the mirrored characters and the typo in the first line I think it is a gem and real &lsquo;camp&rsquo; of the sixties.</p>

I have another clue that can support that. In Caractère Noël 60 the picture below can be found in the story about Excoffon. This cartouche did he make for an advertisement. The only thing that it is not dated and it could be made after he made the Calypso. But still the fact that he used a modern form of a cartouche in his type specimen of Calypso indicates that he had special interest for that art form.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>The first time cartouches were seen were in Egypt. The oval frames in the top picture. They are architectural frames. But you can even see them on the Rosetta stone, of course cut out in the stone! The map with sheets that contain drawings of cartouches I showed before in this thread were inspirational drawings for architects. So it were 2D drawings that were really meant as 3D examples for cartouches like you can see in the picture on the bottom. In this example it is made from wood but mostly they were carved in stone. You can find them all over Europe but mostly in France and Italy. The interesting thing is that, as you say, you can also find them on cigar bands and more luxury goods were they have also a blind embossing and are in fact also a 3D representation.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>The interesting thing however was that Excoffon turned it around. He made cartouches that looked like 3D but were meant as 2D. Just like he did with Calypso. In the picture below you see some more examples of how he was experimenting with that concept. But more to fool the eye than to make it too serious like the old cartouches we used on our postcards. It is a bit like M.C. Escher did. Do you really see what your brain tells you?</p>
<p>In fact, I read that the name cartouche comes from the Italian ‘cartoccio’ that means ‘rolled paper’. It was the form of rolled paper or leather that was carved in sand stone. It was used around a round window, as a frame for the founding year of a building and as a frame for text. During the years they became more extreme in form and appearance. Excoffon went with his cartouches and with his Calypso back to the early form of these cartouches, that of rolled paper.</p>
