  body: Dav, I didn't realise the relationship between the two until I read the information
    on the die-gestalten site, it does seem suspectable. I'll try and dig up that
    old typophile thread for myself. :^)

    Geoff, That currently seems to be the only way to purchase. Contacting 'The Foundry'
    and buying / licensing from them, directly.\r\n\r\nBy the way, the text mentioning
    'Gridnik' on the 'Die Gestalten' site is new. Soo, Maybe someone over there read
    some of the remarks over here. :)\r\n\r\nDav"
