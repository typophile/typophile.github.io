  picture.\r\n\"restaurants\" seems to be a typeface very similar to Clarendon, but
  the lower case \"t\" is quite different. \r\n\"BEST\" also seems to be a different
  face altogether, but the former is driving me crazy.\r\nAny help would greatly be
  appreciated. \r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/DSC00002_4596.jpg]"
