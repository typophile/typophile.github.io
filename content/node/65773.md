  every thing was ok, when i write with the fonts using size less than 14, the characters
  look so bad; i know that i need some hinting justification.I am very blocked and
  this make me so nervous and stressed due to its hardness, I do really apreciate
  your help if you can send me some tutorials links or VTT ( it sounds that it is
  good hinting editor), or i can even send you the fonts for helping doing hinting
  process. my e-mail is :z_tito(at)hotmail(dot)com.\r\n\r\nMany thanks"

    I felt I understood hinting from it.

  body: "TrueType or PostScript flavored fonts?\r\n\r\n<strong><a href=\"http://typophile.com/files/hinting.pdf\">The
    PostScript hinting tutorial by David Lemon</a></strong> is good. It only misses
    the information about how to set the stem weight values. But a while ago Ken Lunde
    and David Lemon have provided useful information in the thread <strong><a href=\"http://typophile.com/node/59506\">PostScript
    hinting -- number and weight of standard stems</a></strong>.\r\n\r\nBy the way,
    Adobe works on a new tutorial. I hope that it will be released with the next version
    of the AFDKO (Adobe Font Development Kit for OpenType). Or is it already available?
    That would be very cool.\r\n\r\nThe AFDKO contains an excellent autohinting program.
    But the alignment zones and the stem weight values have to be chosen manually.\r\n\r\nIf
    you want to hint a TrueType font, I can\u2019t help. I only know one tutorial.
    There is a link on the myfonts website. But as far as I remember it is not about
    Delta hinting.\r\n\r\nYou also should have a look into the FontLab manual."

    tuto, or if you do not mind i can share with you the fonts.\r\n\r\nI have to finish
    that in teh near future, i can pay some charge if convinient.\r\n\r\nWaiting for

  body: "@ adilturbo\r\n\r\nDavid Lemon\u2019s tutorial is a step by step tutorial,
    but for PostScript flavored fonts only.\r\n\r\n1. Set the alignment zones with
    the help of the tutorial.\r\n2. Set the standard stem values with the help of
    the auto function of FontLab. It is in the font info panel. (You have to use the
    autohinting function of FontLab first [F7].) Later you can manually tune the standard
    stem values.\r\n3. Remove all hints.\r\n4. Hint the fonts with the AFDKO autohinting
    macro. (There is a bug in the macro, which I have corrected. You can download
    it <strong><a href=\"http://forum.fontlab.com/adobe-fdk-for-opentype-afdko/bug-in-autohintscript-belonging-to-the-afdko-25-21898-t7057.0.html\">at
    the FontLab forum</a></strong>.)\r\n\r\nThere are a few FontLab options, that
    you should deactivate:\r\n\"Use subroutines to compress outlines in the CFF table\"
    and \"Autohint unhinted glyphs\".\r\n\r\nPostScript hinting is much easier than
    drawing the outlines. So, if you have designed the typeface, you are for sure
    able to hint it.\r\n\r\nI never have hinted a TrueType font. I don\u2019t know,
    how difficult basic TrueType hinting is, but Delta hinting seems to be a science.
    I have heard, that only a few people have the knowledge and the abilities to set
    Delta hints."

    taking size in ppm, point number to  move,  distance in fractions of pixels as
    arguments, and applying them according to the settings of the  graphics state.\r\n\r\nLet
    me know when you understand the functions of the preprogram, font program, control
    value table and graphics state, and I will fill you in on the other glyph hints...\r\n\r\nCheers!\r\n
