  here had any recommendations? Good book shops (1st/2nd/antique, anything) or any
  good galleries, just anything you think is good and worth seeing.\r\n\r\nThanks
  a lot,\r\n\r\nTL"

    (Poster Collection), although it seems they are in limited service these days.\r\nhttp://www.museum-gestaltung.ch/en/collections/poster/\r\n\r\nThere
    are some great museums and galleries in Zurich (and even more in Basel, which
    is an hour away).\r\nIf you want some printing/type/book-historical background
    I highly recommend the Swiss museum of paper, type and printing, which is in Basel:

    or Geneva? It's been so many years, I forget. It's my favorite museum in the world.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    & Militeria Collection]] at the National Museum?\r\n\r\nI enjoyed Zurich a great
    deal but visiting with my father we spent a great deal of time in places he had
    hung out in when he lived there aged 18-20, which is to say we sampled a great
    deal of beer and food. I did manage to get him over to the [[http://www.museum-gestaltung.ch/|Design
    Museum]], which was cool and does have at least [[http://www.museum-gestaltung.ch/en/exhibitions/annual-program-2014/weingart-typography/|one
    typographic exhibition]] coming up."

    getting my wife to take a picture of me grasping a halberd, and 5 seconds later
    the security guy showed up...\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
