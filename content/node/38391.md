  of symbols brings a new perspective to age old tradition with the introduction of
  66 striking icons.\r\n\r\nYou may have seen these same symbols in various GAP and
  Product (RED) campaigns...but now is your chance to have your own set of these unique
  symbols with just a simple keystroke...\r\n\r\nChoose Adinkra Calabash for the hand-hewn
  quality found in African art, Adinkra FineFine for a clearer and more contemporary
  look or Adinkra WantaWanta to achieve a wax print/batik-like effect that adds a
  certain touch of West African authenticity to any project.\r\n\r\nWould you like

    appreciate any feedback from the design community...\r\n\r\nYes as a matter fact
    there will be interpretations coming with the release of the OpenType Version

    the freedom of using them by just clicking on a ligature tab or alternate tab...Look

  body: 'Sorry, I was asking the meaning of the symbols - or are they purely decorative?
    I recall working on a Tamil font here at work and some of us really liked one
    of the characters, and we suggested making t-shirts. The native speakers we were
    working with objected to this idea over this as the particular character had some
    religious significance.   '

  body: "Oh I understand what you mean...and the answer is yes they are decorative
    but they also have meanings...most of these symbols while they are for decorative
    purposes also have meanings about man's relation to God, nature and the world
    around him/her. And wearing these symbols is part-in-parcel of the creation of
    them...They are customarily worn in Ghana for all occasions on hand-printed cloth
    (that was the inspiration for Adinkra Calabash) so the worst that you would probably
    get from a person who knows about these symbols would be a smile and a casual
    coversation about the symbol used...\r\n\r\nBut since you asked the question about
    meaning...we will be putting out a PDF with the names and meanings of the symbols
    soon so that others can understand the symbols and use them with the knowledge
    that they know what it means. \r\n\r\nFrom the desks of the friendly folks {at}
