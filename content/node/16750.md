  body: "Alex\r\n\r\nModifications to the mold to create kerning is done by altering
    the set-width of the mold at the casting machine. Letters that are normally cast
    flush to the sidebearings can be undercut on the right side to kern onto the shoulder
    of the following letter. This subtraction of width is at the discretion of the
    casterman and can be overdone. All characters have a set-width designation stamped
    on the matix. When followed these widths create proper fitting and in the case
    of letters like f (roman) a kern is automatically created. In italic matrix suites
    there are many letters that kern on the right side and make tight fitting in a
    line.\r\n\r\nJustification is the term given to the process of trimming the extra
    depth that results when a steel punch is over-depth into the matrix metal blank.
    Matrices are always over-driven since it is not really possible to strike the
    depth dead accurately. As a result the strike is made a couple of thousandths
    of an inch too deep and the face of the matrice is trimmed off to make the depth
    consistent over the entire suite of matrices. In bygone days this was done by
    rubbing the matrix on a file and trial casting until the height of the lead type
    was correct. I have two Ludlow Super Surfacers that I have adapted to trim as
    little as one quarter of a thousandth at a time, and this saves a lot of sore
    thumbs.\r\n\r\nSome people use the term Justification to mean the side fitting
    of one letter to another, but the more common meaning is the trimming of the matix
    to depth.\r\n\r\nJim"

  body: "<w=em>3)Does broadnib pen equal the quill pen?\r\nWhat is a split-nib pen?
    Does it equal a quill pen with disposable metal nib?</em>\r\n\r\nBroad nib and
    split nib refer to the way in which the nib of a pen, whether quill, reed, metal,
    etc. is shaped and hence the characteristics of the ink flow and kind of strokes
    and contrast patterns that can be made with the pen. A broad nib has defined width
    that determines stroke contrast. A split nib is thinner, pointed and much more
    flexible, so stroke contrast is determined by pressure rather than by the shape
    of the nib: the more pressure you apply, the heavier the stroke. As you apply
    pressure, the two sides of the split nib move apart from each other, but the surface
    tension of the ink means that the stroke itself does not split (unless you apply
    too much pressure; this has sometimes been exploited by calligraphers). Split
    nibs are usually made of metal, since it is stronger and can be flexed without
    fear of breaking. It is possible to make a split nib from a feather or from a
    reed, but the material is is less durable and, in the case of the feather, too
    brittle to last long."

  body: "While this thread is nearly ten years old, and our friend Jim Rimmer is no
    longer with us, it might be worth adding a few comments.  \r\n     (1)  Jim's
    response is absolutely correct regarding modern casting machines, in which the
    matrices are often of a fixed overall dimension (these are frequently called 'flat
    mats' or 'display mats').  In such cases the type caster dials in the correct
    'set width' of the intended character and the design of the machine will make
    a type of that width. Adjustments for alignment are also a frequent part of the
    casting process.\r\n     In pivotal casting machines, or the traditional hand
    mould, the foundry style matrix varies in width according to the character it
    carries. An i matrix will be narrower than a W matrix by the difference in the
    set width of the two sorts.  In the hand mould the substitution of one matrix
    for another automatically changes the set width, because the hand mould closes
    against the sides of the matrix for each cast.  In the pivotal caster this adjustment
    is made by loosening a large bolt and shifting the relationship of the two mould
    halves.  The pivotal caster was the first machine for casting type and its mould
    shares many of the features of the hand mould.\r\n     Regardless of the specific
    mould or machine, the kern is formed when the casting cavity is narrower than
    the letter sunk into the matrix, so that a portion of the matrix overlaps the
    bottom of the mould.   Metal flows into the overlapping portion and results in
    an extension of the letter that protrudes beyond the body of the cast type.\r\n\r\n
    \    (2)  Fitting or justifying a foundry matrix is a delicate task that involves
    a variety of steps.  (a.)  Fitting for depth of drive is described by Jim above.
    \ Driven matrices, made with a punch are often slightly uneven in depth as well
    as being 'over driven'.  So the matrix must be adjusted to make the face of the
    'eye' of the matrix parallel to the surface, and of the proper depth:  ie. A common
    depth of drive for display faces is .050\".  (b.) Matrices must also be adjusted
    so that the letter appears upright or vertical, or in the case of italics it must
    have the correct slope.  Even when great care is taken in driving the punch a
    letter may be struck out of vertical.  Special 'squares' are used to check this,
    but in many cases it is finally a matter of using one's 'eye' to determine if
    a letter is standing up straight. (c.) The head bearing must be adjusted in order
    to align the types.  With the matrix's depth established and the letter made upright,
    one cuts away the end of the matrix, above the eye, so as to raise the position
    of the cast letter. Little by little metal is cut away and trial casts made until
    the base line of the letter is aligned with the rest of the font.  A special tool
    called an alignment gauge is used for this task. The visual requirements involved
    are the same as are now requisite for a digital type face.  (d.) The side bearing
    must be consistent from one matrix to another, while also establishing the proper
    'set width' for the letter.  Side bearing is the metal margin on either side of
    the 'eye' (struck letter) of the matrix. It is critical that the proper amount
    of metal be removed, yet not too much. This is a highly subjective element in
    the process and fraught with peril, as it is quite easy to take off too much metal
    from the side of the matrix.  In the event that too much metal is filed or milled
    away the fitter can 'botch' the side of the matrix, raising a series of 'burs'
    with a chisel. These act to make the matrix wider, although they are not attractive
    and can wear down with frequent use.\r\n     So you see, the traditional methods
    of fitting a foundry matrix to be cast with a hand mould or pivotal caster require
    hours of diligent, skilled work -- usually at least two hours per matrix.  Modern
    flat mats also require meticulous fitting, with only a few variations in the specific
    standards needed for the 'modern' caster. \r\n    See \"Fournier on Typecasting\"
    translated by Harry Carter, for detailed information on this subject.  "
