    call &#34;trouble&#34;?

  body: Also, what version of Bickham Script? The old Type 1 MM version &#40;Bickam
    Script MM&#41;, or the newer OpenType version &#40;Bickham Script Std&#41;? <BR>
    <BR>There&#39;s also a Bickham Script Pro in the works, which exploits OpenType
    technology to the max. It is very very nice indeed. <BR> <BR>T

  body: If you&#39;re talking about the OpenType version, as far as I know, you can&#39;t
    utilize the swashes, etc. unless you have a program that can read its&#39; Unicode
    encoding. Quark won&#39;t. So far, the only ones I&#39;ve found that will are
    the new Adobe CS products. &#40;insert glyph under the type menu&#41; <BR> <BR>Anyone
    else finding the same thing?

  body: i&#39;ve always had a problem with the old type 1 MM version. specifically,
    the swash caps. i usually have to convert to outline in order to print. it sucks,
    but i gave up trying to figure it out...

    it takes them at least 4 years to make a revision, it is unlikely that they will
    be in business long enough to discover Unicode.  So to quote assorted Valley Girls,

  body: 'Thomas: so now that i&#39;ve opened my big mouth, i&#39;m wondering if i
    don&#39;t just have a corrupt file or somesuch... <BR> <BR>i purchased bickham
    as a download from veer.com and, on my creaky old mac with shamefully old software
    &#40;we&#39;re talking pre system 8.5, G3 upgrade card, Illustrator 8...&#41;,
    i get the &#34;can&#39;t print... missing outline file/ATM not turned on&#34;
    error when trying to use swash caps - even though i seem to have all appropriate
    files and ATM is turned on. plus, i can &#34;create outlines&#34; in Illustrator.
    i don&#39;t have this problem with any other fonts, but given the vintage of my
    system, i figured tech support would tell me i&#39;m SOL. <BR> <BR>i did have
    a friend test it on her whizzy G4 a while back, and from what she said, it sounded
    like she saw a problem as well. though, in rereading her description &#40;&#34;disappearing
    text&#34;&#41;, i&#39;m wondering if she just didn&#39;t type in any actual caps.
    doh! <BR> <BR>in any case, if you have any suggestions &#40;other than buy a new
    computer&#41;, i&#39;d love to hear &#39;em! like i said, converting to outline
    works, but it would be nice to not have to do so. <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"

  body: hrm... Chris&#39; set up is similar to mine. i use suitcase as well &#40;probably
    terribly old version, but i also think i tested bickham by putting straight into
    the fonts folder&#41;; however, i&#39;m on an older version of the OS &#40;8.1,
    anybody? &#42;cringe&#42;&#41;. but if bickham is circa 1997, it should work,
    yes? it&#39;s just odd because i&#39;m limping along fine with all my other fonts.
    my vote is for corruption of some sort...

    I use ATM Deluxe to manage my fonts. I don&#39;t happen to use &#40;or have&#41;
    Illustrator, so I can&#39;t verify that it works there. But it works fine in Quark
    4.1, FreeHand 5.0, and FreeHand 8. <BR> <BR>Is it just the swash caps that give

    actually work on my OS 8.1 machine. Just to be on the up-and-up, though, I would
    want to see some proof of your Veer license/purchase. Contact me off-forum, if
    you want to pursue this. <BR> <BR>But if the fonts are showing up properly on
