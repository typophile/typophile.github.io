  product models which looked like this: <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/43012.jpg"
  alt="Nakamichi&#39;s Dragon-CT logo"> <BR> <BR>Ignoring the fact that there&#39;s
  an outline variety present too; the &#34;A&#34; is obviously very distinctive as
  is the overall character squareness. The curved upwards-tapers on the the end strokes
  of the &#34;G&#34; and &#34;T&#34; are also noteworthy. <BR> <BR>Anyone reconise
  this one? or do you think that it might be a custom-face?? <BR> <BR>cheers, and
  thank you for reading.'
