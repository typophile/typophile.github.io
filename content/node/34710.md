  body: "The question of the appropriate side bearings of the em dash has been discussed
    here several times. Traditionally, at least in the US I believe it was as near
    to a full em as the metal type would allow, and was set with no additional spacing.
    Nowadays I believe it is usually designed with say 5% space on either side. Just
    checking one face, Minion has a em dash that is totals 922 units, including side
    bearings 50 either side--this is on a 1000 unit em. Thus the dash is about 90%
    of the advance width, with 5% side bearings on either side. \r\n\r\nKent Lew has
    explained that Matthew Carter favors an em dash that is 75% of the em, with the
    side bearings taking up the rest of the em. Kent has followed this practice, also
    negatively kerning the em dash with itself, so that a line of em dashes will form
    a continuous line. Note that Minion's em dash is actually 822.\r\n\r\nCarter's
    practice makes a compromise between the British and American practices for parenthetical
    dashes. The British practice is to use en dashes with thin spaces either side.
    The American practice has been a full em with no extra spacing. Bringhurst rails
    against the American practice, decrying it as a relic of bad Victorian typography.
    Whatever the merit of this complaint, the current American practice moves toward
    the European style. "

  body: "As Bill pointed out, for an em dash, the tradition in metal was a full em
    wide with the dash generally extending to the edges (i.e., zero sidebearings).
    Typesetters had different conventions (in conjunction with Editorial standards)
    of spacing these dashes. In the U.S., the most popular style is \"closed\" --
    that is, without space on either side. However, careful compositors would often
    insert a thin space to hold the dash away from rounds.\r\n\r\nNowadays approaches
    vary among type designers. I've outlined the thinking behind my approach in the
    notes of the <a href=\"http://www.kentlew.com/Type/WhitmanSpecimen.pdf\" target=new>Whitman
    PDF specimen</a> at my site.\r\n\r\nIf you choose to outfit your em dash with
    positive sidebearings, then I recommend the kern that Bill mentioned above (at
    least for any serious text face). In bibliographies, it is common practice to
    use a 3-to-em dash to signify a repeated author entry, and this is usually set
    (not surprisingly) as 3 consecutive em dashes. If an emdash-emdash kern pair is
    not present, your unfortunate designer will find herself with a \"dotted\" 3-to-em
    dash (and will likely incur the wrath of the editors).\r\n\r\n-- K.\r\n\r\n"

  body: "I've been using a 3/4 em dash on an em body (or dash 75% of the em width,
    with the rest of the space as sebearings) as long as Fontographer existed. I also
    make up a \"twoemdash\" and a \"threeemdash\" character with no sidebearings,
    so that I can get any length dash (2,3,4,5 ... n). In Type 1 fonts, you had to
    be able to write a custom encoding vector to use them, but if you could, it was
    a character assignment well spent.\r\n\r\nWith OpenType, you simply add them to
    your liga feature.\r\n\r\nsub emdash emdash emdash by threeemdash\r\nsub emdash
    emdash by twoemdash\r\n\r\nWhen you think about it, the tradition of no sidebearings
    came about, at least in part, so you could set a two- or three-em dash. The large
    \"case\" of OpenType has changed that.\r\n\r\nWith the endash, you might want
    to give it the same sidebearings as the hyphen. While endashes are used more with
    numbers, both the hyphen and endash are used with both letters and numbers, and
    your kerning work is eased if they have the same sidebearings. In truth, you can
    make the sidebearings on the en about 5 to 10 units greater than the hyphen &
    still use the same kerning values; I think the overall fit with this is a bit
    better.\r\n\r\nAs for hyphen sidebearings, I make them to work with n m h etc.
    and use kerning for the fit with other letters. If your overall spacing of letters
    makes words with a certain characteristic (lose, tight), you will want that same
    characteristic with the hyphen.\r\n\r\nFWIW "

    and probably more right to kern the dash after a previous one to get rid of the
    space between.</cite>\r\n\r\nWell, that's why they race horses, I guess. But to
    me, they are different characters. Consider that a 3-em dash in a bibliography
    starts flush left. But you're not going to kern an em-dash with a .125 em sidebearing
    flush left, at least, in InDesign.  I'd rather use a different dash that starts
    without a left sidebearing, measures a full three ems, and, since it is usually
    followed by a period or comma, doesn't have a .125 em right sidebearing. Bet on
    the gray if you want.\r\n\r\nThe two- and three-em dashes have various uses, such
    as to replace a persons name (e.g., Mrs.----), but all the uses I know of are
    different than the use of the em-dash.\r\n\r\nUsually, the em-dash both separates
    and joins two somewhat related thoughts. Whether you think of it as \"separating\"
    or \"joining\" is at some level a word game, but graphically, the British word-spaced
    en dash follows the \"separating\" notion; the American closed-up em dash is in
    line with the \"joining.\" Some British designers who have worked in the States
    for a while, like Richard Eckersley, began to favor the 3/4-em dash in the full
    em space, and from this thread, it seems that Matthew Carter also signed on.\r\n\r\nAnother
    way of looking at an em-dash is that it replaces a pair of parentheses for expressing
    a thought that is related, but not grammatically connected to a sentence."

  body: In InDesign (CS1) I will if necessary kern an em dash (or other character)
    that I want "flusher" left, into a preceding space. Has to be at the beginning
    of a new paragraph or after a forced line break, so works fine for bibliographies.
    I suppose a kern pair could be made in the font itself of space-em dash, though
    this would foul things up if putting a space-em dash somewhere else. Choice in
    a font of both em dash with no side bearings and em dash with them would be my
    desire.
