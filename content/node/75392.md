  body: Don't know the exact name of these typefaces but I think you could have a
    look to [[http://new.myfonts.com/foundry/Blambot/|Blambot]] and [[http://www.houseind.com/fonts/monsterfonts|HI
    Monster]] collections. Try also some keywords/tags at MyFonts like "[[http://new.myfonts.com/tags/comic/|comic]]"
    or "[[http://new.myfonts.com/search/horror/fonts/|horror]]".
