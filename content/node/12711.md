    you may not be able to properly encode, transfer metrics, etc. You end up with
    a junk font. For that matter, even with commercial programs, if you don't pay
    attention to the proper sequences, you end up with junk.\r\n\r\nGerald"

    FontHopper online somewhere for free is no more legal than finding any other retail
    program online.\r\n\r\nAdobe didn't continue any Ares software after acquiring
    the company; it was bought exclusively for its \"Chameleon\" font compression
    technology, which was an option in PostScript 3 devices. Look up \"Type 14 fonts\"
    for more info.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\n\r\nT"

    told me this was because of the \"chip mafia.\" Meaning, I guess, there is no
    reason any software can't be backward compatible; it's just that the powers that
    be like to have their control, and would like to have your money. I guess they
    need it more than you do. Don't know why. Ever read the book (or see the movie),
    The Time Machine?\r\n\r\nGerald"

    And re-reading Chad's post, I realize that it was probably referring to exactly
    that. Sorry for any misinterpretation.\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\nT"
