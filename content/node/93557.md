body: "I hesitate to ask, but do I really need font management software on my computer?
  I'm running the latest update of OS X Lion. I'm \"new\" to Macs, having switched
  in 2008. At that time, I bought Extensis Suitcase Fusion 2 and upgraded to 3 when
  they released it.\r\n\r\nMy memory is nothing but a confusion of fearfully trying
  to move the fonts they said I should by following the suggestions they made. Then,
  they were never ready after Adobe upgrades. Also, I was constantly finding my files
  missing or turned off somehow and I spent hours researching and troubleshooting
  issues and managing the app instead of the transparent effortless font management
  I expected it to provide.\r\n\r\nNow, they've released v4. I've already upgraded
  to Adobe CS6 and I heard that the Suitcase Fusion is not able to work with that
  version.\r\n\r\nIs font management a necessary evil, or can OS X Lion handle my
  fonts for me. I own most of Hoefler and Fr\xE8re Jones typefaces and some others
  besides. I don't know if that qualifies as too many or as not even close to taxing
  OS X. I don't want to put up with the hassles I had with Suitcase Fusion 3 (and
  earlier). It made me want to reinstall the OS and start from scratch with only fonts
  Apple includes (and maybe a few others). What a horror that was.\r\n\r\nAnd if I
  must install something, is there something better than Suitcase Fusion? If not,
  is 4 better than 3? I assume there is no work around if I do install 4 and it doesn't
  work with Adobe? That was also intensely annoying. Perhaps I should use 4 and not
  use the Adobe plug-ins?\r\n\r\nI have a vague recollection that somewhere Hoefler
  made a comment about font management software in general (or Suitcase Fusion in
  specific?) perhaps in the sense that they were no longer needed and more problematic
  than helpful?\r\n\r\nMy apologies for the length of this post, but I'd really love
  to resolve this issue if possible.\r\n\r\nThank you so much for any advice!"

  body: "For most needs the current version of Font Book is probably sophisticated
    enough. It might be worth removing any other management software, experimenting
    by adding a few families at a time and seeing how that works for you.\r\n\r\nIf
    taking this approach you should probably keep the file and folder structure as
    clearly organised as possible and before adding fonts to Font Book make sure that
    you have not placed them in one of the live font folder structures:\r\n\r\n/Library/Fonts\r\n/System/Library/Fonts\r\n/Users/username/Library/Fonts\r\n\r\nSome
    Adobe products also have an application specific font folder that overrides fonts
    at the system level. I am familiar with this in CS4 but not later versions."

  body: "If you have, say a couple of hundred fonts maximum, and you often use the
    same fonts over and over, it is probably unnessesary to use font management. But
    I have a bit more, and use many different fonts for many projects, so it is indispensible
    for me. I would not be able to keep a proper overview of the fonts I have, and
    it is much more difficult to compare them. I have used Fontexplorer (FEX) by Linotype,
    first the free version, now the Pro version, and it has always worked well for
    me. It is intuitive, the auto-activation works fine with CS, and it is easy to
    keep an overview of the fonts. I used the option of the 30 day trial, which I
    recommend.\r\n\r\nI haven't used Suitcase in like 10 years (when I hated it),
    so I can't say how it is in comparison. I also tested FontAgent Pro on a trial,
    but it was not on the same level as FEX in my opinion. Plus FEX is the cheaper
    option, so that helps... "

  body: A large number of font ID requests here are from designers who have forgotten
    what fonts they've used for some project.  A font manager, if used to group fonts
    by project, could completely eliminate that problem.

    fine, but I wouldn't want to depend on that long-term to keep track of font sets
    for hundreds of jobs over many years. People change computers, change font managers,
    etc. I think a better method is just to archive each project properly, which a
    designer should do routinely anyway. "

    Explorer X Pro includes a tool (Detect Fonts in Documents)  that can generate
    font reports from a wide variety of file types including: InDesign (CS2 and later),
    Ilustrator (CS3 and later), pdf, eps, rtf, rtfd, svg, svgz, pages, key, idml,
    icml and icmt. Reports can be generated in text or XML (plist) format.\r\n\r\nThis
    is a very useful way of tracking what fonts have been used in a project and gives
    you the option to create sets based on those fonts."
