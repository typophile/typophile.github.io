  but I just can't seem to find it. I'm looking for the R in this font.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.rockinroadies.com/06/home.php?q=lq\r\n\r\nCan
  anyone help me find the R's in the top left logo? Once upon a time I had this font
  somewhere, but my font collection has doubled and even sitting through over an hour
  of going one by one in photoshop couldn't find it.\r\n\r\nAny help is greatly appreciated!
  You will be font MASTERS if you do!"

  body: "This logo was converted into vector graphics, but was previously a font.
    The two R's are customly intertwined. Please notice that the top left of the Top
    R and the bottom right of the Bottom R, create the \"true\" R.\r\n\r\nThis is
    definately without a doubt a font."

  body: I'd have to agree with Patty on this one. And even if it were definitely without
    a doubt a font it could still have been custom made and not commercially released.
    Hard to imagine that R being useful in too many instances.

    one of the free fonts. \r\n\r\nI can't really help you with this one, it's crude
    and seems custom-drawn to me as well."
