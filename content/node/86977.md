  are no longer valid, the .PDF downloads are still there.\r\n\r\nIn reviewing the
  unit arrangements for a few of the well-known typefaces, I found out that in Poliphilus,
  the capital letter W was 21 units wide, which is more than 18 units. In fact, looking
  at the unit arrangements document, I see that several other typefaces go over 18
  units; several have characters that are 20 units wide, and a few go up to 25, 28,
  or even 29 units."

  body: If you're asking how this is possible or how it is implemented, it's necessary
    to type a "high space" before these characters, because they obviously kern off
    the lefthand edge of the type body. If that wasn't your question or you already
    knew that, sorry.

  body: "Thank you for the answer; this is my question: how characters above 18 units
    were handled.\r\n\r\nI'm surprised, though, that this was done so... routinely.
    I would have thought that the characters would have been scaled to fit 18 units
    (not by changing their general size - a higher set would be used) so as to avoid
    anything as cumbersome as that. Even several sizes of Caslon Old Face, I've found,
    had this property."

  body: "You're very welcome. I learned this working on a Monotype caster this past
    summer. They also have two different keys for a, e, and o: one set sets the letters
    with a negative left kern, for using after T, V, etc. A lot to remember. So to
    type \"Wa\", you had to type a high space, then W, and then remember to use the
    alternate \"a\" key. But yes, it is strange that you need to use a high space
    so frequently. I think the reason they couldn't just make the character bodies
    wider is that the lead would take too long to cool and mess up the caster somehow.
    This is why I was told that you can't type em/em/em/em etc to fill out a blank
    line. You need to type en/en/en/en because having too many wide characters in
    a row causes problems as the metal cools.\r\n\r\nJosh"
