body: "I've only ever seen Runic (Adobe) as \"Runic MT Compressed\", but I'm wondering
  if there was ever a non-compressed version of Runic, or if there's a recent uncompressed
  equivalent? I look for the distinctive ends on the capital C and G...\r\n\r\nSearching
  the forums here I found a few references to Runic apparently being stretched manually
  for book covers, logos, etc, but I wondered why this would need to be done at all
  - usually a demand for a particular typeface doesn't go unsatisfied for very long.
  So I can't help feeling there must be something already out there..."

  body: I have two folders in my font collection for Runic - One says condensed the
    other says regular, but they both contain Runic MT Condensed.  Does not seem to
    be a regular.
