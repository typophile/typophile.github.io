body: 'Ijust recently got a new computer and the main programs I have is Photoshop
  7, Image Ready, and Paint shop pro.  Anyways, I have been creating fonts that can
  be scanned into the computer.  I know I don&#39;t have the appropriate software,
  but is there anyway I can just work with what I have and not have to get Font lab
  or Fontographer?  Now, sure I would love those programs but there is no way I can
  afford that stuff now.  Maybe someone can give me some helpful advice as far as
  how can I create the fonts using the programs that I have if it is possible.  '

    deal with vectors &#40;which is what fonts are&#41; except in a very limited fashion.
    <BR> <BR>If you don&#39;t want to spend the money on Fontlab or Fontographer,
    you can try FontTool from the people who make Fontlab.  It&#39;s a &#34;light&#34;
    version of Fontlab, perfect if you don&#39;t need to take advantage of all the
    high end features.  You can check it out at <a href="http://www.pyrus.com" target="_blank">www.pyrus.com</a>.
    <BR> <BR>If you know German, there is a free tool out there called Manutius.  <a

  body: TypeTool is a good place to start as its cheap, good, and there is an upgrade
    path to the full FontLab for when you get more adventurous. You&#39;re also supporting
    an active developer community, unlike Macromedia&#39;s shameful treatment of Fontographer.
    <BR> <BR>Incidentally, if you are pondering stealing font software, do bear in
    mind the people who produce it. In the case of FontLab, its a few eager enthusiastic
    developers who want to create a great product for the type community and hopefully
    make a living from their efforts. In the case of Fontographer, its a bunch of
    idiotic short-sighted suits with a cash cow who they never feed. <BR> <BR>Give
    some money to the nice Russians, thats what I say.

  body: Don&#39;t let the lack of font software stop you from using your  <BR>fonts.
    <BR> <BR>If you want to use your type in a limited way - to set a  <BR>headline
    or a logotype - you can treat your glyphs &#40;each  <BR>individual letter&#41;
    like you would line-art or illustration. It  <BR>just requires that you compose
    them as individual shapes,  <BR>instead of using it like a font &#40;with the
    type tools&#41;. But, like  <BR>Chris said, you&#39;ll most-likely want Illustrator
    or Freehand if  <BR>you go that route. <BR> <BR>Of course this is not an ideal
    long-term solution, but it will  <BR>save you having to buy and learn font software.
    Unless of  <BR>course, you&#39;re willing and ready to do that, then don&#39;t
    let  <BR>me discourage you!

  body: thank you to all that have responded.  Thanks to David for his list, I do
    appreciate it, but I don&#39;t have illustrator or freehand.  My computer only
    has Photoshop 7, Image Ready 7, Paint Shop Pro for only 30 days trial run, and
    that is it.  So, instead of me going out and buying software with what little
    amount of money I have, I am going to work with what I have.  I really appreciate
    everyone helping me out.  I will take your suggestions DAvid and get the books
    and study and read and do all that good stuff.  Thanks again.

  body: 'Sarah, <BR> <BR>yesterday i was at a friend&#39;s house and saw the latest
    MacAddict &#40;i think it is the August issue, #84&#41;. it has a tutorial on
    TypeTool, and at the end there is a sidebar about a &#42;free&#42; font editor
    you can get on the web. this program is called PfaEdit and it is open source &#40;i
    think the article said it was UNIX-based, but i&#39;m not sure&#41;... according
    to MacAddict this program is very buggy and even the author of the program recommends
    saving often. the website includes a manual and many comments on installing, etc.
    this program lets you create new fonts or edit existing ones. i have not tried
    it myself, but if you are interested, here is the link: <BR> <BR><a href="http://pfaedit.sourceforge.net"
