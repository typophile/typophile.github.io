  body: "Margaret, I guess I can answer your e-mail here. I think this is probably
    customized too. If you took a wide sans like ITC Blair and were able to round
    the corners of the B and D, you would be very close, I think.\r\n\r\nUse an upside
    down U for the N in INC.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
