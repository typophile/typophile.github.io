  body: Unicase can be very fun, youthful, with an energetic rhythm, but it looks
    amateurish here. GQ is more classy than that.

    that.\r\n\r\nI've always thought GQ was a little hit-and-miss with their typography.
    This doesn't look too pretty, it's like a unicase Helvetica. :^x\r\n"

  body: "Sorry not intending to hi-jack this thread, but how can one turn amateurish/not
    so pretty unicase into good looking unicase? Is this dependant on the typface?
    What typeface characteristics support generally considered good looking unicase?\r\n\r\n"

  body: Maybe they loved the photo and wanted to use it but realized anything other
    than all caps would disappear next to all those white teeth. But, they didn't
    <em>want</em> to use all caps so the next best thing is unicase.

  body: "Nathan, I don't really have the type design expertise to answer your question
    but have a look at Licko's <a href=\"http://www.emigre.com/dp/getfontpage.php?PFilU.html\">Filosofia
    Unicase</a> and Jeremy Tankard's <a href=\"http://www.typography.net/type/disturbance.htm\">Disturbance.</a>
    I think serifed types works better at unicase than sans, which just doesn't look
    right IMHO.\r\n\r\nPrevious threads on unicase <a href=\"http://www.typophile.com/node/15035\">here</a>
    and <a href=\"http://www.typophile.com/node/6699\">here.</a>"

    At least they are willing to try out different fonts though. '

    r in a unicase font is wrong, wrong, wrong though.

  body: I was noticing this morning that Bodoni 26 is $19.95 at p22. I could swear
    the last time I looked it was something like $100. Anyway for $20 that one is
    ripe.
