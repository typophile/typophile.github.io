  font of the handwritten text?\r\nI need to reproduce this old 'logo' for a miniature

    of type books with good script collections and could not find this style. The
    strange 'l' was one letter I used as a key, along with the rather vertical style,
    but nothing was very close that I found.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
