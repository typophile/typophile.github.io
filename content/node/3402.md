  body: ' Martin, you&#39;re on the right track. It looks like Transmission, a 1983
    Letraset font. I think it was based on the font, rather than set in the font.
    The original font had fake scan lines. Some of the characters have been changed--serifs
    removed or added. The N is completely different. The M is identical. The rest
    of the letters are very similar. '

  body: ' most art supply stores still have the Letraset catalogs in their back shelves
    - some with boxes of transfer sheets in storage...but go quick quick...Letraset
    is discommisioning alot of the transfers - once the set is gone - its gone gone.
    they only sell digital products now. '
