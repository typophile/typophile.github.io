  body: There was an alphabet known as Osmanya, but Somali is now &#40;since the early
    1970s&#41; written with Latin &#40;and I believe it is a subset of ASCII&#41;.

  body: Generally speaking, the Latin orthographies of southern and eastern African
    languages tend to be simpler than central and western orthographies, and use very
    few diacritics or special letters. See <a href="http://www.culturalorientation.net/somali/slang02.html"

    an overview of the official, 1972 orthography.
