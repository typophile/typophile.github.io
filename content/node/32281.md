  material..good stuff ;)\r\n\r\nNow on to the beginning logo sketches;\r\nClient
  is a company describes themselves as a design,marketing and advertising company.
  \ It's a local startup with hopes of attracting small to mid-size business with
  a decent budget for advertising. In short, between mom and pop shops and big corporate.\r\n\r\n-some
  (rather philosophical) guidelines they gave:\r\n-The name they have is Dynamis Media\r\n-definition:
  strength, ability, power, \"inherent power, power residing in a thing by virtue
  of its nature, or which a person or thing exerts and puts forth\" \r\n-Red is a
  power color\r\n-Red was crucial to alchemy. Preliminary stage to the \"Philosophers
  Stone\" - a magic substance which was capable of converting cheap metals into gold.
  \r\n\r\n\r\nI'm in the beginning stages of sketching and concepts....some help would
  be greatly appreciated :)  Attached are a few I picked, leaning towards the first
  and last ones. your thoughts?"

  body: "I think you might need to start again - the typeface itself doesn't feel
    powerful to me.\r\n\r\nOne final thought on the Philosophers Stone - true alchemists
    understood that this was a metaphor and that what they were really trying to do
    is convert themselves to \"gold\". In essence the purification of the self. Of
    course there were a lot of charlatans\u2026\r\n\r\nIt seems like they want more
    red than you have given them. That being said I think it's good to sketch out
    your ideas in black and white and then worry about colors.\r\n\r\nFind what you
    consider to be a powerful typeface and then go from there\u2026\r\n\r\nAlchemists
    used alembics, crucibles and fire to conduct their experiments. It is also the
    forefather of chemistry. There might be something there, perhaps a chemical symbol\u2026\r\n\r\npeace\r\n"

    body: "Paul,\r\n\r\nthanks for the advice.  Forgot to say that they had mentioned
      they would like the font serpentine included somehow.  Perhaps a variation of
      another stronger font for the name and media in serpentine would work better.\r\n\r\nI
      really like the idea of alchemists tools, but I thought if use something like
      that it might take on a whole other meaning visually, so i meant to keep something
      a bit more abstract. I like the idea of the fire...a spark, phoenix, rebirth?"

  body: "Well if they asked for serpentine then that is what they shall get\u2026
    :)\r\n\r\nI think your idea about the stronger font for Dynamis and then media
    in serpentine makes a lot of sense.\r\n\r\nThe fire - yes - now there's a spark
    - and the phoenix fits in perfectly as does rebirth - that's what real alchemy
    was really about.\r\n\r\nNice\u2026\r\n\r\nBest of Luck!\r\n\r\npeace"

  body: "\"they had mentioned they would like the font serpentine included somehow\"\r\n\r\nSet
    a long line of type set in serpentine. Shrink it to .5 pt. Use it as a rule. Problem
    solved!\r\n\r\nSorry, I know that isn't much help. I just don't have any clue
    how to make Serpentine tolerable. "

  body: just put up a new version with a modified version of Magnesium.  At this point
    I'm going to go my own route and present to them what I end up with.  If any of
    you have any other font suggestions to help portray a strong, sleek and modern
    version for 'dynamis' let me know :)
