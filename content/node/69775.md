  their logo. So I designed my own, and it's a solid, aesthetic replacement, if perhaps
  a bit bland.\r\n\r\nI put together [[http://userscripts.org/scripts/show/74838|this
  GreaseMonkey script]] that replaces the logo (and favicon) on bing.com and discoverbing.com.
  I hope you find it useful.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/better-bing-logo_4015.png]"

  body: "Dunno, to my eye this appears to lack a number of necessary optical corrections.
    (\"g\" join clotty, stem-to-curve transitions unhappy, weights of rounds and straights
    don't match, and what's up with the weight in \"b\"'s bowl?)\r\n\r\nAlso, maybe
    it's just me but I've always thought the concept of the \"g\" (not the execution
    mind you) is actually one really nice thing about the present Bing logo."

    looks like. I tried it after it first came out...and I was not impressed. I looked
    up the same thing twice, once on google and once on bing. The results from Bing
    were worse than google, i.e. I got more hits to get anywhere. Then, I had to go
    to page two to get to the original page that I wanted to get to. Google, on the
    other hand, showed me where I wanted to go, first link. So, for my time...I'll
    stick with old faithful, google. That all stated...\r\n\r\nI hate the bing logo.
    Yours could use a little work, as has been prior noted. But, all in all...I think
    the whole site stinks. So....I don't know.\r\n\r\nPut me down as not a fan of
    the site, period.  "

    from [[http://www.microsoft.com/typography/fonts/family.aspx?FID=148|TW Cen MT]]
    (e.g. the b is a 6 that has been rotated), so perhaps [[http://typophile.com/user/3834|Nick]]
    and [[http://typophile.com/user/13487|Nina]] should let Monotype know that the

    aesthetic replacement\xBB, and on Typophile at that.\r\n\r\nBTW, the Bing \"g\"
    is not \xABripped off from Kabel\xBB, it's simply following a similar basic structure,
    which is indeed named after Rudolf Koch (who drew Kabel). Many other fonts (most
    of which have nothing to do with Kabel) do too, in fact this structure is getting
    pretty hawt nowadays."

    or worse, but my problems with the Bing logo are all about the execution, and
    this shares all those flaws as far as I can tell. So I don't see the improvement.\r\n\r\nAnd,
    if one is familiar with these issues and knows what one is doing, one could do
    this *with* corrections within half an hour. The optical corrections at least
    at a basic level could be done in two to five minutes, starting with a vector
    logo. Seriously.\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\nT"

    in fact designed typefaces. I've done about 18,000 glyphs for Adobe, albeit all
    in one typeface.\r\n\r\n2) It's like you went into the arena for the first time,
    and some experienced boxers watching pointed out afterwards that you need to actually
    punch with your left as well as your right. This is really basic stuff in type
    design that you haven't learned yet.\r\n\r\nI've recently been designing some
    commercial logos for my employer, in collaboration with our lead in-house graphic
    designer. It's been a great experience, because she has some fine ideas and we
    work together at that level, but she lacks any experience with exactly these sorts
    of optical correction issues, so I fix all those things along the way, and avoid
    at least one kind of complete logo failure that I see in the logos for, say, Bing
    and Nook.\r\n\r\nBy the way, another very specific point which I see in your re-design
    of Bing, as well as (for instance) the Nook logo: in order for your logo to *look*
    monoline (that is, the lines are all the same thickness), you need to make the
    horizontal parts slightly thinner than the vertical parts. This applies to the
    top and bottom of round shapes compared to the sides, as well. Even 5% difference
    may do the trick.\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\nT"
