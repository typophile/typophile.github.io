  body: Yeah, it is really out of place an unrelated to the rest of the design in
    any way.  Maybe there is a meaning to it in the movie we don't know about it...
    Otherwise it's just bad judgement.  Well, it gives me hope for my professional
    future.  If they hire someone  on such a big budget to do something so lame, I
    could beat that.

  body: 'I don''t think it looks that bad... I''m not sure what font that is, but
    it appears to be Titling Caps and regular caps and small caps. Seeing as the story
    was originally published in 1922, the type seems very appropriate, almost elegant.
    Though I wish the U was a bit wider and the kerning on Benjamin was better. '

  body: Context? Is this a movie about fly-fishing? If so it seems reasonable.

  body: "yeah the J is annoying and so is the TT in my opinion... the U and N as asvetic
    mentioned could have been a little wider...\r\n\r\nasvetic also mentioned that
    given the context/ time period that the story was released in, the title might
    work but i think that there are some quirks that are lets just say unforgivable...
    notice the point size of the words 'the' and 'of' in relation to the words 'curious
    case'... i think that needed a LOT more work!\r\n\r\n--\r\narjun"

  body: "I feel like it\u2019s entirely appropriate for a period piece. Pre-computer
    lettering was often rather wonky and not shackled by the mechanical regularity
    of what goes on in the digital age. Getting back to that imparts a warm feeling
    that might work very well, especially for a winter movie."
