  X, it shows it in the menu, BUT when you click on it it switches to the font next
  to it in the list instead and refuses to make it work.\r\n\r\nThe font works perfectly
  in Adobe programs and in TextEdit (I'm using Mac OS X).\r\n\r\nI have heard many
  people have problems with Microsoft programs loading various fonts, but I would
  like to sell this font sometime soon and don't want to have to tell anyone that
  it doesn't work in some Microsoft programs. \r\n\r\nSo far I have only heard people
  saying a font of theirs doesn't show up in the menu because they have the wrong
  printer drivers installed, but this is something different than that because it
  does show up in the menu - it just doesn't work!\r\n\r\nAnyone know something I
  could try?\r\n\r\nTHANX"

    your problem font, then generate and install a TTF version, and see if you have
    the same problem.\r\n\r\nEdit: I just read your previous post. What are you \"trying\"
    when you attempt to generate a TTF? Did you use the Tools &gt; Quick Test as &gt;
    TrueType font?"

    2: Download and run the FontQA macro. Run it and review the results. Fix the problems.\r\nStep
    3: Download and run Microsoft\u2019s font validator. Run it and review the results.
    Fix the problems.'\r\nStep 4: Validate the font with Apple\u2019s FontBook tool.
    But be careful, FontBook is a buggy POS and problems it flags might not actually
    be problems."

  body: "Sorry for getting back to this post so late. I forgot about it after I found
    a solution.\r\n\r\nI HAVE FOUND THE SOLUTION! I threw away the Microsoft Word
    Font Preferences file on my mac, and then it loaded into Word just fine! It was
    that corrupted font preferences file that was causing it. A very important lesson
    to all!\r\n\r\nThanks Dunwich. I will use this advice if I ever have a similar
    problem in the future. I never heard of the FontQA macro before. I will definitely
    try that next time I have a problem. Never heard of Microsoft\u2019s font validator
    either. Great advice! Thank you. I use Fontbook a lot but I almost forgot about
    it's validation abilities. Great idea. And I'll take what it says with a grain
    of salt if it's buggy.\r\n\r\nBTW:\r\n\r\noldnick - I just updated that post.
    Basically, I have decided that I must not be converting the right thing to truetype
    first, before generating. I'm working in opentype right now, and when I'm ready
    I'll convert instructions, contours, and hints to truetype and try it again. Then
    I will report the results.\r\n\r\nI have never tried the Quick Test before.\r\n\r\n"
