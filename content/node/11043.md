  using light and shadow, which then deteriorated the letterform.  <BR>This is my
  first typeface design. Please let me know what you think.  <BR> <BR> <img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/9100.jpg"

  body: It looks like wrinkled tinfoil.  I&#39;m not sure if the name &#34;remnant&#34;
    works, since the majority of the letter is still there.  It&#39;s definitely something
    that can be used as a display, but if you just took an existing typeface and applied
    filters to it, there may be legal issues.  It&#39;s a good start though.

  body: Sorry I haven&#39;t gotten back to all of you sooner. I was just reminded
    by a friend of mine that I had some responses.  <BR>I guess I need to explain
    my process a little more. To start with I took a typeface, made some alterations,
    crumpled the paper, took digital pictures of each individual letterform in 3 different
    light settings. Then I took these images and manipulated them in Streamline. The
    high contrast and conversion I applied helped erase my letterforms to my goal.  I
    hope this helps. Also, in response to Eduardo- I actually think the Frothy typeface
    looks very similar to a fellow student&#39;s design-Tetanus. I think it is also
    posted on here. Both Frothy and Tetnus remind me a lot of Baskerville.  <BR>For
    legallity purposes, I&#39;m not intending to sell this. Just for personal use
    and for my class project. Thank you!

  body: Hi, Beth. <BR> <BR><i>&#62;I actually think the Frothy typeface looks very
    similar to a <BR>fellow student&#39;s design.</i> <BR> <BR>I didn&#39;t mean that
    your Remnant <i>looks</i> similar to Frothy. <BR>I just put those links above
    just as &#34;reminder&#34;. Taking an existing  <BR>typeface and changing it,
    it&#39;s not as innovative as it may sound. <BR> <BR>Can I ask you a question?
    Why did you choose Stone Sans to <BR>play with? It was the same typeface used
    in Frothy. <BR> <BR> <BR><i>&#62;Both Frothy and Tetnus remind me a lot of Baskerville.</i>
    <BR> <BR>I don&#39;t wanna be picky, but how can a modern serif typeface <BR>remind
    you of a nineties grunge one? ;-&#41; <BR> <BR>

  body: Eduardo- I understand you were sharing with me what you thought was similar.
    I also understand that changing an existing typeface is not so good. What I wanted
    to do, was to work with it and to create a typeface that appeared unwanted, used,
    and all that remained was this new design. I didn&#39;t realize that I along with
    the Frothy designer had such a pull to Stone Sans. Just kind of odd I guess. I
    thought Tetnus looked a bit like Baskerville because I think that is one of the
    types she used to base her typeface on.  <BR> <BR>On another note, any suggestions
    on what to use this typeface on? I&#39;m trying to brainstorm for my specimen
    posters......just looking for open feedback from everyone. I am hoping for a better
    idea than for a landfill flyer. Thanks!!!
