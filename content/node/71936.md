  body: The first one is some version of Helvetica Bold. Hard to say which for sure.
    If it's not Helvetica, it could be Arial. None of the characters that distinguish
    the two are present, but it feels more like Helvetica to me.

  body: That you, Lex, for identifying something that I certainly should have known,
    Times New Roman Bold. Thank you.
