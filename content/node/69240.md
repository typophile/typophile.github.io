body: "Here's a logo that we designed for a client who's going to be selling luxury
  goods online. Since the main thing was \"luxury\" we wanted to use a mink to create
  a kind of \"monogram\" with the D. \r\n\r\nAs it turned out, minks aren't very pretty
  so we kept using a squirrels as reference. When it was done, it looked nothing like
  a mink anymore, but we had all fallen in love with it, so it's staying.\r\n\r\nWhat
  I am really curious about is what you guys think about the choice of typefaces.
  The client is a big believer of polls and I want to see if there is a difference
  between his results and mine. Just for fun. \r\n\r\nPlease tell me which of the
  three options you like best. I'm hoping to get as many votes as possible so that
  there's a halfway decent sample size. Thanks!\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/options_4527.jpg]"

    stem heights of versions two and three, and going with the didone for the name.
    Also, the logomark feels unbalanced where it is. Could we see an example of the
    <em>d</em> centered? (keeping the squirrel where it is relative to the <em>d</em>.
    In other words, don't center the bounding box of the letter and varmint; just
    the letter.)"

    thought that the first one, which is centering the d to the words below looked
    worse. \r\nThe second one is done optically, is that better?\r\n\r\nI think there
    is something tricky about the two words below. Whenever I center align anything
    to the words, they never look centralised."

    wouldn't pay too much attention to a poll of typophiles on such issues."

    Have you considered centering DOORSTEP LUXURY between the left part of the d and
    the squirrel's tail, which would move the d to the left? J. Tillman"

  body: "I'm quite surprised. The didone was my first instinct, but I started to turn
    against it because I felt it was a predictable choice for fashion and luxury and
    quite staid for a store that was going to be selling purely online. \r\n\r\nThe
    slab felt right to me. Maybe I've been reading too much Esquire, <a href=\"http://www.wmagazine.com/w/blogs/editorsblog\"
    target=\"blank\">W</a> and pretty much just about everywhere. Slabs feel bold,
    current, even slightly brash (or had an immediacy which I felt was suitable for
    the online target audience). \r\n\r\nBut I was worried that it might be faddish.
    And I started having second thoughts when I saw the Burger King logo. It became
    hard to justify using such a sporty kind of face for the brand.\r\n\r\nI wonder
    if anyone shares my opinion about \r\n1) the didones being predictable, safe and
    staid for luxury fashion? It's far too sameish. \r\n2) that the slab is more suitable
    than the didone, because despite being chunky and pedestrian (on its own), the
    overall brand still comes across sophisticated because of the colours used?\r\n\r\nAluminium:
    funny you should say that. In some parts of the brand application, I actually
    lean towards dropping of the d. But in the nascent stages of the brand development,
    we will want to use the DL monogram as much as possible. The squirrel looks very
    good on its own though, scurrying across the bottom of a letterhead. \r\n\r\nJ
    Tillman: Yup, that's the client's pick as well. The first two were the options
    provided (one radical and one safe). And the third one was the clients request,
    based on Georgia's proportions!\r\n\r\nNick Shinn: Yes, this is purely for the
    sake of discussion. I'm curious to see if there is a big difference between designers
    (who think about type a lot) and lay people (who judge type on instinct). As it
    stands now, there does not seem to be much of a difference. Most people prefer
    the second option and the client likes the third one. Between the second and the
    third, I prefer the second option because the proportions are more \"display\"
    compared to the third one which just looks like enlarged bodytext.\r\n\r\nI do
    need to work on the alignment, and any tips here would be most appreciated.  "

    font with a high x height. And if you can find one with an expressive y all the
    better :)\r\n\r\nI don't like any of them.\r\n\r\nThe play from the logo-ized

  body: Thanks all for your comments. I think the consensus is generally for the didone
    and the sans. Similar to what the client's straw poll revealed. The only difference
    is in the x-height. :)
