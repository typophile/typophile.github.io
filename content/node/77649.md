body: "This might seem too simplistic, but believe me when I say any answers or observations
  would be GREATLY appreciated.\r\n\r\nI think everyone here has their own little
  shortcuts, tricks, and other maneuvers allowing them to save time when \"drawing\"
  a typeface on-screen. For example, though it might not be a \"trick,\" per se, I
  don't think it's particularly criminal to take a high-contrast circumflex and flip
  it horizontal and vertical to make a high-contrast caron. Others might even draw
  an \"h\" and then proceed to make an \"n\" by chopping off the ascender; in basic
  sans typefaces, I mean.\r\n\r\nThat said, I'm thinking now of the letters \"S\"
  and \"C,\" and their lower-case siblings ... specifically the part from the top-center
  nodes (or bottom center) to the finials. That curve between the two. How do people
  here go about creating that part? Mathematical equation? Plain-old eye-balling?
  Extreme BCP lengths emanating from particular nodes?\r\n\r\nI'd love to hear a variety
  of answers if there are any, because this can really be a burden for anyone mildly
  OCD afflicted. And I'm not even going to get started on how people manage to draw
  the curves in 2s and 8s."
