body: Does anybody know who owned Adcraft Typographers out of New York City? I have
  a set of killer specimen binders from this firm; literally hundreds of 13"x8" pages
  showing great metal type in many sizes. I would like to digitize them all to post
  on Flickr, but not without permission from whoever owned the firm. If anybody knows
  anything please help me out!

  body: I have a bunch of 9" x 11.75" pages from AdCraft and they are indeed nice
    specimens. Mine came in file folders marked A to Z from some now long  designer
    friend. No idea when they date from.
