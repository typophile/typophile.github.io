  body: Nice, serious, but not very rock'n'roll, although that is a tricky combination.
    I don't like the white space between L & I. Is that space meant to represent something?
    L looks like it is from a different, wider face. I'd also widen V a bit so its
    counter comes down lower.

  body: L is too wide and the counter of V should be moved down. Spacing is also a
    bit tight and it's hard to distinguish EVA and LINGON as two seperate words.

  body: With the VA combination, you could emphasize a slanted line throughout to
    insert some energy (might meet your "rock n' roll" criteria).  It feels overly
    structured and rigid right now to me, too much of a technical grid.  I think it
    can be serious without being so staunchly rectangular.

    too unbalanced. The mark will work better above the type. I think the two words
    need to stay together.

  body: Wow, you are going to have to really work to fit all that stuff into the logo.  In
    my opinion, it is too much focus on the images and not enough on the concept that
    is communicated.  Maybe a beaver wearing a raspberry beret means something to
    you, but what does it mean to anyone else?  Lingonberry, Beaver, Rock N Roll,
    Serious,  Ingmar Bergman, Awarded films, etc.  It is just too much for this logo
    to bear, I'm afraid.

    it hard to see that it's an animal at all. But if you really want a beaver, maybe
    you should do something with the tail, so at least it's clear that it's a beaver.
