    not the same font. \r\n\r\nHmm This one also looks like it, but on the other extreme
    of dirty typewriter: [[http://www.dafont.com/my-old-remington.font|My Old Remington,

    of 'used'\r\n\r\nAlso see Inspire Graphics Remington Portable and Remington Streamline.
    Both by Lettering Delights (a scrapbooking co.). Some of their fonts may have
    been discontinued but widely available - need to go to their site and also search
    for them.\r\n\r\nThere may be more.\r\n\r\n"
