body: "Hello all,\r\n\r\nI've been studying type for several years now but haven't
  sat down to begin designing a full font until recently. I got my hands on Fonts
  & Logos by Doyald Young and have been working my way through that, and as a compliment
  to what I've been reading and learning I started designing a font based on lettering
  I found at local historic locations.\r\n\r\nI've sketched a few of the more complex
  lowercase letters (to get an idea about caps height, diagonals, bowls, widths, etc)
  but now when I look at them as a group I feel like I'm looking at totally different
  fonts.\r\n\r\nAny advice about what I'm naively missing to tie all these together?
  Or additional pointers? Any critique is much appreciated.\r\n\r\n-Sean"
