  body: "These factories stop doing interesting work at least when they grow over
    a critical size. Typically over five employees I would say. The whole system of
    getting new large business to keep the employees busy kills any form of design.
    It turns into lowest common denominator: charts, charts, and more charts, a dull
    new logo, an unexciting new colour palette, a generic corporate stock-photo library
    and so on.\r\n\r\nThese big corporate entities do not have the guts to rise out
    of mediocrity, and the design factories are certainly not going to rock the boat
    they are in. It's design by committee, so bland it disappears in background radiation.\r\n\r\nIn
    my list the usual suspects at the 'top' are the really the bottom. I don't even
    think they should be allowed to be called design agencies."

    about making a difference. So, the only logical ranking would be by revenue, but
    who needs another wealth list?

    curious.\" It seems very odd that this ridiculous question would draw forth such
    negative blanket statements from Clauses and Gary Long.\r\n\r\nNow, the question
    itself is ridiculous, and was obviously just lobbed out there to spark some conversation.
    You may as well ask who the best classical violinist is, or the best chef. At
    a certain level, any rankings will be subjective. (Yes, Joshua Bell is a better
    classical violinist than my niece Joanie, but is he better than Gidon Kremer?
    Depends who you like better.)\r\n\r\nAnd Mr. S\xF8rensen's statement that any
    design firm larger than 5 people doesn't do interesting work is patently ridiculous.
    His further statements just increase the idiocy of his original statement. Mr.
    Long chimes in with stupid statement about big design firms not \"making a difference,\"
    what ever that is supposed to mean.\r\n\r\nIs it the duty of design firms to serve
    their clients? Yes, of course. Is it their duty to do so in a way that brings
    interesting conceptual and formal solutions into the world? No, but it's probably
    what most designers are striving to do, wherever they work, and whatever their
    level of talent. Is it the duty of design firms to \"make a difference\"? If they
    want to do that, they should open soup kitchens.\r\n\r\nThere are PLENTY of corporate
    design agencies making good work AND doing good works. And there are plenty filled
    with money-grubbing hacks. Like any profession, there are those who are in it
    for the love of the pursuit, and those who just want to get paid. If you are hoping
    to make a big pile of cash in graphic design, then corporate identity is probably
    the way to go.\r\n\r\nHere are questions for Mr S\xF8rensen and Mr Long: Have
    you risen out of mediocrity? Are you making a difference?\r\n\r\nMr. S\xF8rensen,
    you are a student - or maybe a recent graduate - so your idealism is the arrogance
    and ignorance of youth. What work have you done in the profession which raises
    you out of mediocrity?\r\n\r\nMr. Long, according to your Typophile profile, you
    work at a vanity publisher: http://www.foxmeadowbooks.com/production.html I'm
    sorry to say that this activity doesn't seem to be terribly difference-making.\r\n\r\nJN"

  body: "I think we should really think twice before making these type of silly blanket
    statements. There are a lot of firms out there \"doing great work\", \"making
    a difference\" and \"making a living\" at the same time.\r\n\r\nIf your boss came
    to you next week and said: \"Well, we are going to change the direction of this
    firm. We are now doing only pro bono work. We want to start 'really making a difference'.
    What that means is that you won't be getting a check anymore because we simply
    can't afford to pay you\".\r\n\r\nIf you desire to be involved in strictly non-profit
    work, then start a non-profit company. But don't chastise the rest of us you are
    trying to make a living and support our families while doing what we love--and
    hopefully whenever possible, \"making a difference\".\r\n\r\nThe notion that you
    (or big firms) can't produce good work while making a profit is just preposterous.
    \ \r\n\r\nEnough on that, back to the original subject.\r\n\r\nPentagram, Duffy
    & Partners, FITCH and Sandstrom Design are just a few that pop into mind.\r\n\r\n"

  body: hildebrant's right. it seems pretty arbitrary to condemn a firm once they've
    passed the '5 designer' limit. pentagram, duffy, and sandstrom are all terrific.
    i might add willoughby design group http://www.willoughbydesign.com/  for some
    of their branding work.

  body: "I did not expect this to become as heated as it actually did;-) \r\n\r\nHaving
    said that I have to agree with much of what both New guy and Hildebrant says.
    I don't think it is impossible to combine great work with making a buck while
    sticking to a budget and a time constraint. I'm not saying it is easy but deffinetly
    possible.\r\n\r\nA lot of designers today come up with great ideas even in a corporate
    setting however many ideas gets discarded by the client due to poor knowledge,
    from the team, of the clients standing. If we all got better at wearing the clients
    shoes, understood their challenges and used this as a basis for the design it
    wouldn't be as hard a sell. Form should always follow function. We as designers
    have a lot to learn from the industrial design scene.\r\n\r\nSo what is good design?
    In my world something that is solved under a time constraint, within a budget
    with the user in focus, addressing the correct social group and is visually stunning
    within this market section (and allows me and my familly to eat at night). It
    doesn't mean I don't love what I do!\r\n\r\nTo answer Hildebrant's first question
    \"What qualifies as top? Best Work? Highest Revenue?\" I would say the combination
    of these 2 pluss trying to make a difference;-) \r\n\r\nSome of my favourites;
    \r\nhttp://frostdesign.com.au\r\nhttp://pentagram.com\r\nhttp://spiekermannpartners.com\r\n\r\nThen
    again most of my favs are crossovers or within the industrial design field: Ideo
    is one example.\r\n\r\n"

    Mr. Long, except in reverse, when you state that, \"you can hardly be relevant
    in a global context with five people in your firm.\"\r\n\r\nStefan Sagmeister
    is one example of a designer with a very small office making \"globally relevant\"
    work. Paul Rand was another. (As an aside, many of type's great innovators worked
    alone, or with one or two assistants, including Eric Gill, Frederic Goudy, and
    W.A. Dwiggins.)\r\n\r\nThe only rule is that there are no rules. A single person
    or a team of 100 can make something extraordinary. A single person or a team of
    100 can make something terrible.\r\n\r\nJN"

    are very successful at staying relevant with over five people because of their
    HR strategies.\r\n\r\nOne company I deal with has a practice that once HR has
    approved someone, they then have to be approved by *everyone* in the department
    they will be working in. The reason I know this is that it seemed odd they had
    so many very nice people who get along so well, and asked who did their hiring.\r\n\r\nI
    guess if someone is \"full of it\" this gives more of a chance to sniff them out."
