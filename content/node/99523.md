body: Hello there. I know I already posted this in the "Logos / Corporate ID Design"
  section, but I will delete whichever gets feedback first because I thought it qualified
  for both. Ok, so this is a new logo for an Islamic TV station. The name in English
  is Qubaa (which is a reference to the first mosque built in Islam). After going
  through a number of different iterations, the client chose a Kufic script (like
  the one in the first image), which I fine-tuned into what became the fourth image.
  The client requested that I transform the first letter, the "qaf", into the Dome
  of the Rock, the Medinah mosque dome, as well as the Kaaba (in Makkah) respectively.
  The reason for this is because these three sites are the holiest in Islam. I abstracted
  them and added them instead of the first letter, but kept the two dots of the letter
  qaf above each symbol to retain a certain degree of legibility. I also changed the
  "alef" letter in the logo because it kind of looks like the mi'thanah (the tall
  structure you usually find in mosques). The point of these three versions, according
  to the client, is to have the logo change every 10-15 seconds when on-air. As far
  as Latin typography is concerned, I decided to go with H&FJ's Verlag (different
  treatments are in image 6).
