  and I need a sans serif text font that fits snugly and unobtrusively next to Times,
  under Futura and which can be read easily at 8pt.\r\n\r\nAny ideas most, most welcome."

    the fascinating typophile thread on the subject, but I\u2019m not convinced its
    a good idea."

  body: "Although it's an obvious choice - a geometric sans serif, like Futura, but
    humanized by some oldstyle features - I would definitely say that you should not
    use Kabel.\r\n\r\nA sans-serif face that might be used in a dictionary, with a
    large x-height - I don't know any by name. [[http://www.fontspring.com/fonts/fontsite/antique-olive-fs|Antique
    Olive]] certainly has a very large x-height, but it is usually thought of as a
    display face. In a thread here on a related topic, [[http://www.identifont.com/show?1N2|Century
    Gothic]] was recommended, but for your specific case, it seems to resemble Futura
    too closely.\r\n\r\nI suspect you should go for something wide, not narrow, and
    lighter rather than bolder, so Bell Gothic is out, even though it's legible in
    small sizes, and has the additional useful property of clearly distinguishing
    between I, l, and 1."
