body: I&#39;ve been working on a museum catalogue for an exhibition related to art
  from the kingdom of Ayutthaya in Thailand. The interior design is going well I think,
  but for some reason I&#39;m stuck on the cover. I will post a couple of my rather
  uninspired versions here in two posts. The text font is Jenson, the display font,
  which you see here, is Industria, used on the inside in this same yellow color.
  I&#39;m set with these faces for the interior. I&#39;m also committed to this manuscript
  image for the cover. Can anyone help me to think more creatively about this?  <BR>

  body: Thanks, Daniel <BR> <BR>I was thinking about this last night, and I finally
    came up with some ideas to improve it, I think &#40;starting from the first version
    but insetting the art and adding some rules&#41;.  <BR> <BR>Regarding the rounded
    fonts, I wanted to avoid the curvy look you see at Thai restaurants, which I think
    is kind of a cliche. My feedback at the museum is that this font does -- strangely
    -- evoke a bit of Thai quality. <BR> <BR>Tom

  body: 'Tom a couple of ideas: 1. Try making the color image smaller and offset it
    a bit asemtrical. Create some tension don&#39;t justify everything it looks like
    a text book. 2. Think matt/gloss use an aquious coating and then print a matt
    varnish leaving only the color image glossy. 3. Make the image smaller and instead
    of a solid background use a ghosted version of the color image full bleed in one
    color. 4. If you have it in your budjet, think in terms of embossing or stamping.'

  body: Nice of you to say, Paul. I&#39;ve done a few more since these. Still can&#39;t
    find one I like. Eventually it will get there if it marinates long enough I guess.
    <BR> <BR>But I like your &#34;The Light at Montauk Point, Long Island.&#34;  <BR>
