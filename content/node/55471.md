  body: "Well, do you want it to be clean (digital data) or realistic/\"haptic\" (filming
    a printed sample); immersive or conceptual; dynamic or meditative; informative
    or exciting\u2026? I'd say how to \"film\" a font depends on a multitude of variables.
    Consider the type of font, the font itself, the concept of the video, the target
    audience, target resolution/compression/platform, run time, and audio.\r\nSorry
    I don't know of any examples. But it might help to compile a list of adjectives
    or a description of what the finished video should \"feel\" like, & then dive
    into film/video theory if necessary and figure out a way to achieve the desired
    result from there."

  body: "<em>\"The concept of the video is to show/teach (to studantes or type designer
    aspirants) the development of the typeface. The options taken by the designer,
    etc\u2026\"</em>\r\nInteresting. So more of a documentary/educational type thing
    than a flashy promo piece. \r\nI like your idea of combining digital data with
    actually filming printed pieces. After all that's the abstract-to-material process
    that all people using a font will go through. \r\n\r\nWhen filming the printed
    stuff, make sure the image quality really shows off the pieces. Avoid sacrificing
    quality before going to DVD. Shallow depth of field tends to look aesthetic to
    people in macro (which is probably because it makes sense when compared with our
    own visual apparatus). Do you have a good camera at your disposal, with a macro
    lens? Even better, do you have a good cinematographer at your disposal? And an
    editor?\r\nAlso, select the samples very carefully, as even the texture of the
    paper might be quite visible. Think about focus and blur, and about still or moving
    camera (and be aware that doing moving camera well &ndash; especially if this
    is going to be macro shots &ndash; will require some equipment (besides training
    and/or lots of luck), at the very least a really good video tripod). Also, be
    prepared to spend a lot of thought and time on lighting. \r\n(Sorry if I'm obnoxious,
    and/or stating the obvious. I've been doing a bit of video work, and I'm not aware
    of how much experience you have with all of this.)\r\n\r\nAnyway: So are you just
    going to show the fonts and nothing else? It might be way cool to actually interview
    the respective designers (or maybe just one or two). Maybe you can get them to
    talk about one or two individual glyphs in depth, and juxtapose/overlay that footage
    with the actual glyph \"coming together\"? Or maybe even show them showing/explaining
    some sketches! \r\nThis may be way beyond your budget or options. But, consider
    that connecting / getting captured is easier with human faces than typefaces for
    most people. And if you can't actually travel and meet the designers, talk to
    them on the phone or have them record a few musings on tape (assuming they're
    alive today), and play that while you show off the glyphs. "

    No budget studies yet, but It will not be a huge production and the designers

  body: "<em>\"I cant change the texture of the paper\"</em>\r\nObviously not, but
    you can pay attention to it (which samples you use, how you light them, how close
    you go). I've sometimes taken macro shots of stuff I printed out myself on my
    cheap laser just because I was infatuated with the font used. Then at second glance
    the print quality (or lack thereof) and cheap paper really ruined those shots\u2026\r\n\r\n<em>\"thats

    isn't networking all that much. \r\nNice!"
