body: I&#39;m working on my first set of true small caps.  I see that in a few fonts
  the small caps are a little taller than x-height, although theoretically they should
  be the same as the x-height.  Are there any guidelines for this?  I can see how
  it might be helpful if a font had a smallish x-height &#40;mine is average&#41;.  For
  my first version I made the stems of the small caps the same thickness as those
  of the lowercase letters, but I think this is not quite enough.  I&#39;d be grateful
  for any pointers on this topic. <BR> <BR>David

    told you that? <BR>To me it&#39;s exactly the opposite. The main reason is that
    some acronyms&#42; &#40;like &#34;OS&#34;, or &#34;SC&#34;!&#41; will look like
    lc if the smallcaps are as short as the x-height - throwing off the reader. <BR>
    <BR>&#42; Which is essentially the main use of smallcaps these days. <BR> <BR>hhp

  body: I did test printouts using Adobe Garamond Pro and Warnock Pro, which I happen
    to own and which contain true small caps; in both cases the small caps were as
    I describe, just slightly higher than x-height.  Palatino Linotype had the small
    caps the same as x-height.  I do not remember where I learned this principle about
    small caps, but it has been in my head for a while. <BR> <BR>I am speaking of
    small caps designed to go with traditional serif book faces, if that makes any
    difference.  I have used small caps in the past for entering names of Unicode
    characters in documentation &#40;e.g., LATIN SMALL LETTER THORN&#41; when they
    occur in running text, and I think that this use does look better with small caps
    at x-height size &#40;more or less&#41; than it would with taller ones.  I have
    also seen a word beginning with a cap and the rest in small caps, where a larger
    size small cap works better.  I&#39;m not sure about all this, which is why I&#39;m
    asking . . .  <BR> <BR>David

  body: '&#62; just slightly higher <BR> <BR>Just slightly higher, <i>visibly</i>
    higher, is great. But the same height: sucks. Look at an issue of Eye magazine:
    acronyms often become confusing in Proforma &#40;otherwise one of my very favorite
    faces&#41;. <BR> <BR>&#62; I have used small caps ... <BR> <BR>Well, thank you!
    <BR>But you&#39;re the exception. Look everywhere around you: even when smallcaps
    are right under their noses, most designers just use the caps at different point
    sizes - when they want to pretend they&#39;re classy, that is. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>'

  body: The small caps in AGaramond and Warnock are perhaps 5-6% higher than x-height.  I
    don&#39;t think most people would consciously notice this at text sizes &#40;but
    the Adobe designers must have felt it important&#41;.  I had to do printouts at
    large sizes to see it.

    an interesting thing, that &#34;consciously&#34;. <BR>I think there are different
    levels - and different ways the levels apply in context. <BR> <BR>For example,
    in this case, if you were to directly ask people something like &#34;Are these
    letters taller_than/shorter_than/the_same_as those?&#34; and they mostly gave
    the first answer, then to me the smallcaps are tall enough. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>'

  body: There are some small caps versions that have different points of view. Personaly
    I have a curiosity to understand better some combinations and aspects. This AGaramound
    that have the l/c align to 5-6% than x-height are design to big sizes? Perhaps
    they have few legibility to small sizes?. Probably the better way is you define
    a size and try to experiment some tests with different sizes betten x-height and
    the capital line.  <BR> <BR>What the typophile community think about the figures,
    punctuation, basic characters?  <BR> <BR>Ricardo <BR>

    <BR>But it might indeed be useful for each of us to air some of our <i>unorthodox</i>
    views about each of those. Like my view that the period needs to sit &#40;basically,
    float&#41; higher than the baseline, and specifically the comma. Or that numerals
    should have vertical stress &#40;at least in display faces&#41;. <BR> <BR>What
    else? <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>'

  body: I am an author who occasionally makes his own fonts. I am currently using
    MS-Word2000 going all the way through to colour-pdf separations for film. I want
    the whole book to be in a single font--it&#39;s working OK, except that when I
    select small-caps through the format command, Word just makes the small-caps a
    smaller point-size. I want to embed a smallcap alphabet in my trutype font which
    MS-word then knows to select. Is this impossible? Is this what open types is for?
    I only have fontographer version 3 and the cheaper &#39;font creation program&#39;.

  body: if you&#39;re not going to be using a bold in your book, you can make a smallcap
    font, and assign it as the &#34;bold&#34; style of your regular font.
