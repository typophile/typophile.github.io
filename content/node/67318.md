body: "I am working on a redesign for a science magazine/journal and we need a sans
  serif font with as big a glyph set as possible, including Greeks and quantum symbols
  and as much math as possible.\r\n<!--break-->\r\nIdeally this font would also look
  amazing as a display face, however I think we all agree that this is basically impossible.
  \ \r\n\r\nSo....what I am looking for is a sans serif with a million bazillion characters
  that will work well in italic, regular, bold and bold italics (because each of those
  things means something in science).  I am going to try to use it for any sans serif
  body copy and then insert it in if it needs to be in the display area.  It would
  help me if it had a condensed weight too since I am using one of the more condensed
  widths of Knockout for the display copy right now and don't really want to change
  it if I can help it (I'm rather attached to it actually).\r\n\r\nAny ideas?  \r\n\r\nHelp
  quadruply appreciated....\r\n\r\nthanks,\r\nryan"

  body: Something like Lucida Sans may work. Lucida Sans Unicode has Greek, and there's
    a Lucida Math that provides mathematical symbols that harmonize with the Lucida
    superfamily. There's also a Lucida Sans Narrow, but it doesn't comes with the
    same extended glyph coverage.
