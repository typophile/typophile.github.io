"<em>Quick Poll: Facebook has introduced a way to include their "Like" buttons on other websites. Should we add them to FontShop.com pages so you can show your love for your favorite typefaces?</em>"

I say no for the following reasons:

1. It will create another piece of information to process, digest, enter &c. when looking for fonts.

2. People will find a way to game the system to put more "likes" on fonts.

3. It will perpetuate the success of already successful typefaces and put newcomers at a disadvantage.

4. "Like" is so subjective that it's useless information. Typefaces should be selected based upon fitness for purpose, not weather you, or anyone else "like's" them.

IF implemented, users should be required to provide a valid reason. This reason will then need to be moderated and accepted (= hours of work) because people will simply say "just because." Just because McDonalds sells a lot of hamburgers doesn't make them "good."

Cast your vote by becoming a fan of the FontShop profile and then commenting on the question.</div>

John - I'm very sensitive to these issues and I assure you we'll take them into account when considering any use of their service. This is very exploratory at this point.</div>

They can still do it from within their social network of choice, without the need for other people browsing fonts to see a button which, in fact, is an ad for a specific social network.</div>

well, um, no, actually, it isn't.  it isn't nearly that trivial at all.

it's data-collection, for the purpose of collaborative filtering.

collaborative filtering is the _ultimate_ "killer app", because
it solves the ever-growing problem of information overload,
pulling your personal needles out of the content haystack,
as quickly and efficiently as a super-turbo-charged magnet.

the big question is whether we want this "killer" functionality
tied up by a private company looking for a revenue-stream,
especially one which values neither our privacy nor our data,
and has been slippy-slidey when it comes to telling us that...

i say no.  emphatically.

this technology needs to be owned collectively, by all of us.

		<div class="commentbody">BTW, I can't cast my vote since I'm not on Facebook, but seeing how the Anti-Facebook backlash has really been gaining momentum lately, I'd warn that including that «like» button can also be perceived, quite negatively, as a statement of solidarity with a company that more and more people turn away from. See for instance this current comment – http://www.wired.com/epicenter/2010/05/facebook-rogue/ – which specifically mentions the «like» button «littering the internet».</div>

Stephen, is this system through FaceBook or proprietary?
