  any good High-School level\r\ntextbooks that teach the basics of graphic design?\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "I would recommend:\r\n\r\nLidwell, W., Holden, K. & Butler, J. (2003). <em>Universal
    principles of graphic design: 100 ways to enhance usability, influence perception,
    increase appeal, make better design discourse and teach through design</em>. Rockport
    Publishers Incorporated, Beverley, MA, USA.\r\n\r\nIt's weak on the type side
    so I would also have them read Bringhurst."

  body: 'I would recommend two books, one from Willi Kunz "Typography: Macro- and
    Microaesthetics", the other from Phil Baines and Andrew Haslam "Type & typography".
    But for High-School level they probably go too much into details.'
