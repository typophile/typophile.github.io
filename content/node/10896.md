body: It is a script I wrote to create and size object within an illustrator document
  in the ratio of the golden section. <BR>It will work under os X on a Mac with illustrator
  and applescript active. <BR>prior to running the script you need to install the
  ScriptingAdditions from Satimage, in their readme file they tell you where to place
  the additions. <BR>Inside the script there is different value that will let you
  modify the polygone shape. <BR>Every time you hit run there is one new polygone
  created in the sequence. <BR> <BR><a href="http://www3.telus.net/~martinga/goldensection.sit"
