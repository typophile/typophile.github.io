  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Hey. Do any of you know whether you can create a text style that has three layers of type? <BR> <BR>I am designing a DVD menu system and each menu item has a top layer, a middle outline layer, and a bottom offset layer for a drop shadow effect.  I have to translate this system into three languages and it&#39;s turning out to be a big pain in the &#149;&#149;&#149; to edit three type layers for every item x three languages! <BR> <BR>I tried making a text style but it only works on one layer of type. <BR> <BR>Any suggestions? <BR> <BR>Thanks, <BR>peter </div>

   <div class="comment card m-3">
	<div class="card-body">
		<div class="commentbody">I think maybe you&#39;re going at the problem backwards. <BR> <BR>There&#39;s no reason you need to use more than one layer for this. Use a stroke on the type, and use Illustrator&#39;s own drop shadow capabilities. <BR> <BR>The stroke will tend to erode the type. If Illustrator doesn&#39;t have the option to simply place the stroke behind the object &#40;not sure&#41;, you can set the path offset to half the stroke thickness, and that should eliminate the problem. <BR> <BR>Regards, <BR> <BR>T</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Huh. I&#39;ve been playing around with this in Illustrator and you <b>can</b> do exactly what you want.  <BR> <BR>The key is to modify the appearance of the text by selecting it as an <b>object</b> &#40;using the arrow tool&#41;, not as <b>text</b> &#40;using the text tool&#41;. When it is in object mode, you can change the stacking order of the stroke and fill in the appearance palette. You can&#39;t when the text is selected as text.  <BR> <BR>Doing it this way means that the effects will apply to the whole text block, but that would only be a problem if you wanted to use the style within a text block. It doesn&#39;t sound like that&#39;s the case.  <BR> <BR>You change the stacking order of the strokes and fills by dragging them up and down in the Appearance palette. Also, you can add as many strokes and fills as needed and modify them with the Effects menu. With the appropriate stroke or fill selected in the Appearance palette, use Effects -&#62; Distort &amp; Transform -&#62; Transform to do the dropshadow effect.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I tried it in both 10 and CS and it works the same. Try this: <BR> <BR>1. Set some large text. <BR>2. Switch to the solid arrow tool. &#40;The text should now be selected as an object.&#41; <BR>3. In the Appearance palette, do Add New Stroke and set the stroke thickness to 6 points and the color to red &#40;to make it easier to see what&#39;s going on&#41;. <BR>4. Illustrator automatically adds an empty Fill layer to the appearance palette. Click on it and change it to yellow. <BR>5. In the Appearance palette, drag the yellow Fill layer to above the Stroke layer. You now have the Fill in front of the Stroke, just as if you had pasted a stroked copy of the text behind the filled text. <BR>6. Switch to the text tool again, select the text and type something else to see that it worked. <BR> <BR>Of course, use whatever attributes you want for colors, etc. The ones I chose were just to show how it works. <BR> <BR>To add a dropshadow: <BR> <BR>1. Swith back to the solid arrow tool. Make sure the text block is selected. <BR>2. In the Appearance palette, do Add New Stroke. <BR>3. Change the color of the new stroke to black. <BR>3. Rearrange the layers in the Appearance palette so the new stroke is below the other stroke and fill. <BR>4. With the new stroke selected in the Appearance palette, do Effect &#62; Distort &amp; Transform &#62; Transform. Type 3 pt and -3 pt in the Move area of the dialog box and click OK. <BR> <BR>Now you&#39;ve got a dropshadow. Here&#39;s what mine looks like: <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/30/36865.gif" alt="foo"> <BR> <BR>Here&#39;s the Illustrator CS file: <BR> <BR><!--attachment: foo-36866.ai*attachment_icon.gif*application/postscript*444.2*foo2*foo%2eai --><center><table border=1><tr><td><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/icons/attachment_icon.gif" align=left alt="application/postscript">foo2<br><a href="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/30/foo-36866.ai" target="_blank"><b>foo.ai</b></a> (444.2 k)</td></tr></table></center><!--/attachment--> <BR> <BR>You can also change the stroke characteristics, transparency, etc. Just be sure to select the proper component in the Appearance palette first. <BR> <BR>Once you have everything set up, you can drag the appearance into the Style palette so it can be applied to other text.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Thanks Peter for alerting me to this thread! <BR>My book &#40;<a href="http://www.logofontandlettering.com" target="_blank">http://www.logofontandlettering.com</a>&#41; was completed just as Adobe released Illustrator CS. I was able to acknowledge--somewhat in passing--that the new AI version had 3-D extrude tools, but I couldn&#39;t say more.  <BR> <BR>I just played around with Appearance and 3D extrude with ambient shading in AI CS and yes, they add a whole new dimension. It&#39;s a miracle!  <BR> <BR>There are a few problems, though. The shading gets put in as bands that are too low res. Each band is an individual object which makes editing difficult &#40;too many points flying around&#41; and gets us into issues of trapping if we&#39;re doing this for publication.  <BR> <BR>Also, I tried a couple of layers of fills and strokes followed by a 3D extrude and when it was done, 3 of my letters ended up behind the top fill layer, so this is a bug, I presume.   <BR> <BR>The revision of my book--eventually--will have to cover these new AI features, though! However, I&#39;m thinking that I would still very likely build my own shadows because there&#39;s always a superficial feeling to out-of-the-box features like these. But maybe  <BR>I&#39;m just futilely trying to resist progress. <BR>Leslie <BR> <BR></div>

		<div class="commentbody">Leslie --- more important than the 3D extrude &#40;because I do agree that it has less of a manual feel for whatever reason&#41; is showing people how to appreciate the use of &#34;appearances&#34; in illustrator. i don&#39;t remember reading about those in your book. i hope i&#39;m not sticking my foot in it.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Also, one caveat about the &#34;cast shadow&#34; effect I did in the second sample... It&#39;s made of individual copies of the black stroke layer, so if you zoom in or print it out you would see tiny stair steps. One way around this is to increase the number of steps and reduce the distance between them. The other would be to not rely on such a short cut and actually draw it. The 3-d extrude can do it too, but it tends to be a little imprecise for this kind of shadow and the artwork you get when you expand the appearance is a little, I don&#39;t know, messy.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">great tips here. <BR> <BR>I like the stairstep method, but often, it can work with just 2 stairs. It depends on the shapes <BR>sometimes. <BR> <BR>If you do a 20 stairstep and you do <BR>have extra stairs, you can delete <BR>stairs 2-19 and get a straight line from 1 to 20. <BR> <BR>the most efficient way to delete is to open lasso the <BR>extra points, hit delete, then Pathfinder &#62; Unite <BR>and move to the next staircase. <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif" ALT=":-&#41;" BORDER=0> <BR> <BR>here is a pdf _ should be openable in Illustrator. <BR> <BR><!--attachment: type-36920.pdf*mime_pdf.gif*application/pdf*99.1**type%2epdf --><center><table border=1><tr><td><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/icons/mime_pdf.gif" align=left alt="application/pdf"><br><a href="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/30/type-36920.pdf" target="_blank"><b>type.pdf</b></a> (99.1 k)</td></tr></table></center><!--/attachment--></div>
