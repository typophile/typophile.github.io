  I try... \r\n\r\nTry...\r\n\r\nto design a typeface. Since I've never been one to
  do stand alone art, I figured I'd design a typeface for my school, Emory University
  of Atlanta (in mock. Though in a perfect world, maybe I can get them to accept it...)\r\n\r\nCurrently,
  they use Goudy Old Style (which for the word \"Emory\" is gorgeous). It's a tough
  act to follow, but I'm going to swirl it in my mind for awhile.\r\n\r\nI just wanted
  to get some feedback on various Serif Typefaces that have, among, the Best Es, and
  Ys. (I supposed R would have to be in there). All in your opinion, of course.\r\n\r\nThanks!"

    to design a typeface, you need to design a system of glyphs where everything holds
    together. A great E won''t salvage an otherwise bad typeface. '

    find \"acceptable\" as well as get some inspiration. \r\n\r\nI have ALWAYS believed
    in Functional Design. While I can do what I \"desire\" so to speak, if it's functionally
    terrible it's a waste of my time.  That said... I just want to see what's out
    there. "
