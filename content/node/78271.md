  body: The handwriting, in general, from the time is something to enjoy. Gill, Morison,
    all of those people had the most beautiful penmanship.

  body: "The Monotype Corporation had appointed Stanley Morison as typographic advisor
    in 1923, and he used the Monotype Recorder and Monotype Newsletter\u2014the firm's
    main advertising mediums\u2014as a vehicle for publicising new designs. Morison
    instigated the production of Monotype broadsides displaying the full range of
    a new design in multiple sizes, which could serve as sales literature for printers
    to show their customers, or be framed for display in their reception rooms. Among
    the designers whose work the corporation adopted were Eric Gill. His Gill Sans
    of 1928 was widely acclaimed and was followed in 1932 by Perpetua titling capitals,
    modeled on the lettering on Trajan's Column in Rome. Beatrice Warde penned her
    famous broadside This is a Printing Office, to show this typeface off. It has
    since been found on the walls of numerous printing offices, has been cast in bronze
    and is mounted at the entrance to the United States Government Printing Office
    in Washington, D. C., has been translated into numerous languages and has been
    parodied.\r\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beatrice_Warde#Beatrice_Warde.27s_writings\r\n\r\nIf
    anyone knows of any such parodies, please post them here.\r\n\r\nPictures of the
    original broadsheet are hard to find on the Web; found one here:\r\nhttp://observatory.designobserver.com/entry.html?entry=4527"
