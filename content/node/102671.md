  font with FL?\r\nI recall there was a tool few years ago that could change the setting
  in a batch of files.\r\n\r\nTIA"

    body: "hrant: At one time there was a bug in Fontographer that defaulted ALL fonts
      to 'no embedding'. If the font creator even knew about it, finding the fsType
      entry to set the bits properly wasn't clear either. That's why there are thousands
      of older fonts that routinely need this fix.\r\n  - Herb"

  body: Is it ok to give a script online? It is just a few lines of python with AFDKOPython
    installed (last version of AFDKO).

  body: "On the mac, to change to 0x0008 the value of fsType of all otf and ttf files
    in the current directory and subdirectories, all you need to do is to type in
    the terminal window \r\n<PRE>\r\nfind . -iname \"*.[to]tf\" -exec chngfs {} 0x0008
    \\;\r\n</PRE>\r\nprovided the call <code>chngfs fontfile 0x0008</code> changes
    the fsType of fontfile to 0x0008. The following code for <code>chngfs</code> does
    it if <a href=\"http://www.adobe.com/devnet/opentype/afdko.html\">AFDKO 2.5</a>
    for Mac is installed:\r\n<PRE>\r\n#!/usr/bin/env AFDKOPython\r\n\r\nimport sys,
    os\r\nfrom fontTools.ttLib import TTFont\r\n\r\nf=TTFont(sys.argv[1])\r\nf[\"OS/2\"].fsType=int(sys.argv[2],16)\r\nif
    len(sys.argv) == 4:\r\n  f.save(sys.argv[3])\r\nelse:\r\n  f.save(\"tmpfil\")\r\n
    \ os.rename(\"tmpfil\",sys.argv[1])\r\n</PRE>\r\nprovided  <code>chngfs</code>
    is made executable and put in your path. \r\n\r\nAs for Windows, the Python 2.7
    \ documentation says  it is not possible to rename with os.rename a file to a
    file name that is already in use. That is why <code>chngfs</code> above was written
    to take an additional, optional, argument. If AFDKOPython is made available at
    the command line on Windows then the command\r\n<PRE>\r\nAFDKOPython chngfs fontname.ttf
    0x0008 newname.ttf\r\n</PRE>\r\nproduces a new font with the chosen fsType (works
    the same on the mac).\r\n\r\nYou can also call <code>chngfs</code> with 0x0002
    and 0x0004, 0x0008 as well as 0x0000 and variations 0x01?? and 0x02??; cf http://www.microsoft.com/typography/otspec/os2.htm#fst.\r\n\r\n\r\nMichel"

  body: There is a small PC command line program named 'embed' that does what you're
    looking for, very simply. Unfortunately it's not compatible with more recent versions
    of Windows such as Windows 7. I'm not sure whether the Windows 7 Professional's
    compatibility mode would solve the problem.

    it executable and put it in a directory that is in your path on the Mac then\r\n<code>\r\nfind
    . -iname \"*.[ot]tf\" -exec fstype {} \\;\r\n</code>\r\nwill list all ttf and
    otf files if the current directory and subdirectories with their fsType. I guess
    that should also work with Cygwin on Windows but I have no way to check."
