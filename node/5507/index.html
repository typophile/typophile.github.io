The simplest case is to open Kerning Assistance, click on the left classes list, click on &quot;Select All&quot;, click on the right classes list, click on &quot;Select All&quot;. That's a 5-seconds job.  <BR> <BR>Then, you can go and manually deselect the appropriate side of the class for those that are noth both-side classes (if you have such classes).  <BR> <BR>&gt; Why isn't there a feature in FL that  <BR>&gt; does connect the accent characters  <BR>&gt; automatic ( with an option to turn it  <BR>&gt; off)?  <BR> <BR>This can be done with a Python script. Such script is in development at Fontlab Ltd. and will be available as an add-in for FontLab Studio 5.  <BR> <BR>Regards,  <BR>Adam Twardoch <BR>Fontlab Ltd.  <BR></div>

		<div class="commentbody">Thank you Adam for you quick answer. <BR> <BR>&quot;That's a 5-seconds job.&quot; <BR> <BR>Usually I prepair these things in advance but it couldn't be done this time. The font is a bit special so usual kerning pairs doesn't apply. That's why I hoped to keep the kerning pairs I've made in FOG &amp; just apply the same settings to the diactritics - AccentKernMaker would've done the trick.  Making right classes will take a while (long time) in this case. Maybe I should just print the atm- file and go through which pairs need to be fixed? <BR> <BR>&quot;add-in for FontLab Studio 5. &quot; <BR>Looking forward to it's release&hellip; many nice features. <BR></div>

		<div class="commentbody">Peter,  <BR> <BR>make up just a few classes, then save the classes into an .flc file from the Classes panel. Open the .flc file in a text editor. You will see that the font has a fairly simple structure. Of course the other classes still need to be added, but editing this text file should be fairly fast.  <BR> <BR>Note that in the Kernig Assistance dialog, you are also able to save a .flk file which has a similar structure but in addition contains information on left-side, right-side and both-side classes. So perhaps you may want to edit this one.  <BR> <BR>Best,  <BR>Adam <BR></div>
