  body: 'ahh... damn. Thanks Mike, <BR> <BR>Its a really nice loose slab.  <BR> <BR>I
    found this on their site: <BR><I>- Our &#34;Severance&#34; font was originally
    hand drawn by our former Design Director &#40;and named after her&#41;. As the
    company grew, she couldn&#39;t keep up with all the writing, so her hand lettering
    was converted to a computer format so we could type in the lettering rather than
    keep her up 24 hours a day. It is a proprietary font, owned by Ben &amp; Jerry&#39;s
    and is <B>not available for sale or downloading</B>.</I> <BR> <BR>boo-hoo... <BR>

    <BR> <BR>I have seen a few newstyle slabs being designed. Cam &#40;http://www.testpilotcollective.com/&#41;
    is a great example. And dont you just love FF Zapata? &#40;http://www.letterror.com/foundry/zapata/index.html&#41;
    Hey Gringo! ;&#41; <BR>and last, that crazy Machine Slab from HTF, Acropolis.&#40;http://www.typography.com/catalog/acropolis/index.html&#41;
