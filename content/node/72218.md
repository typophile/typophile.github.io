  body: The premise of the article, as I see it, is that Design has become the province
    of smug philistines. Perhaps this is simply an affirmation of Hannah Arendt's
    observation that, at least in the US of A, culture and commodity have become synonymous.
    Andy Warhol definitely proved that to be the case; perhaps all art which follows
    him reinforces the observation...

    rather than anti-corporate or pro-creativity. So now we all spend time bickering
    about that instead of thinking about the message.\r\n\r\nI'm so tired of these
    periodic \"manifestos\" from graphic designers. Don't lecture people about consumption
    and technology with a superior tone. \"We have exchanged freedom for peace. What
    we need is Liberation.\" What? Liberation? From what? Creative habits? Are we
    gearing up for the next deconstructivist, anti-legibility movement in design that
    can be used sell <a href=\"http://ericking.tv/wp-content/uploads/2008/10/pepsibottle.gif\">Pepsi</a>?
    Graphic design has its mouth open beneath the spigots of commerce. It's how we
    buy all of our nice stuff. It's what we use to fund our other work. Some of the
    biggest names on that list have served large corporate clients.\r\n\r\nTake the
    nine days for creative release and refreshing. I bet it will be fantastic. Lord
    knows we could all use a bit of that from time to time. And I love and respect
    the work of many of the names associated with this event. But *please* stop turning
    these things into something more than they are. It's an art and design event sponsored

  body: "I like it it. I don't know exactly what they're on about but it sounds good
    to me. Just because we have the time and the paint doesn't mean we need to decorate
    our caves. Should we design because it's good? Because we just should? Should
    we consider the option of not designing? Maybe there are times when it's better
    not to. Maybe our eyes need a break from design. \r\n\r\nI escape from design
    nightly. I've got interfaces on my phone, my iPod, my TV, my DVD players, my media
    box, my Wii, my DS, GPS. Every web site is a new interface. But when I catch up
    on my favorite sites, I do it through an RSS reader. No matter how a site is designed,
    it's all the same Helvetica on a white background to me. Sure, I'm on a sofa that
    was designed using an iPod that was designed with and app that was designed. But
    I'm insulated from the design on those 100 or so sites that I visit. I don't experience
    100 different color schemes. 100 different menus. 100 different layouts. There's
    a case where I think eliminating design is good. Maybe it's not the same as what
    they're talking about but I think I understand the desire to think critically
    about whether or not design is needed in every situation.\r\n\r\nOh wait. This
    won't help me sell more fonts. I meant to say \"f&#117;ck you, anti-design!\""

  body: "<em>Art for art\u2019s sake was sacrificed for entertainment and bums on
    seats. Ideas became cliches and anything different was viewed with suspicion and
    disdain.</em>\r\n\r\nWhere is it written that we can't have \"art for art's sake?\"
    Anyone can make art for art's sake\u2014just don't expect it to sell! What, they
    want me to pay money (or complments) for art that I don't like just because the
    \"artist\" is absolutely enamored with it, and it's brimming with emotional significance
    for him? Somehow I get the feeling that kind of art wouldn't make it far even
    in the \"anti-design festival.\" There's a place for that kind of \"art:\" next
    to the grocery list on his parents' fridge.\r\n\r\nAnd since when does commercialism
    or capitalism regard things that are different as bad? I come from a film background,
    not a graphics background, so my examples are only tangentially relevant, but
    I'd like to point out that 3D animation (even animation in general) is very much
    new and different. Films like <em>Toy Story</em>, <em>UP</em>, <em>The Incredibles</em>,
    and <em>WALL-E</em> didn't earn near-unanimous popular and critical acclaim for
    being the same as everything else\u2014it was being different that made them competitive!
    If anything, consumerism <em>rewards</em> artists who dare to be different. \r\n\r\nWhy
    else do we have positive connotations with words or phrases like \"visionary,\"
    \"groundbreaking,\" or \"defies convention?\"\r\n\r\nMy philosophy is that, as
    artists (who intend to create art as a living, not as a hobby), we get paid to
    make things for people that they find beautiful (or thought-provoking, or meaningful).
    To successfully and truly defy convention in art is not to reject what we already
    know to be beautiful, but rather to create something nobody before knew was beautiful.
    And many times, it's more the case that someone once, found it to be beautiful,
    and the artist is merely reminding us.\r\n\r\nI would submit that failing to kern
    a \"VA\" pair on a website banner is <em>not</em> progress in art. It is not a
    Dangerous Idea nor a thaw from the Deep Freeze. It is not Freedom from Freedom,
    and it is not Liberation (on a side note, does making proper nouns out of your
    own lingo make it more effective?).\r\n\r\nJust my two cents....\r\n\r\n\r\nEDIT:\r\n\r\n<em>Maybe
    it's not the same as what they're talking about but I think I understand the desire
    to think critically about whether or not design is needed in every situation.</em>\r\n\r\nBut
    isn't the conclusion that \"design\" is unnecessary in a given situation a design
    decision in and of itself?\r\n"

    that such exploration itself constitutes design. I mean, if you're thinking about
    how best to accomplish something\u2014even if that happens to mean plain, unadorned,
    black Helvetica on white\u2014I'm inclined to call it design.\r\n\r\nNow if we
    want to deliberately <em>not</em> think out how best to accomplish something,
    I'd call that non-design. It's also non-intuituve, but I suppose I can see how
    it has its place.\r\n\r\n<em>The anti-commercialism angle is just standard student
    fare . . . </em>\r\n\r\nAh! I suppose I should have seen that. It's just that
    the manifesto practically invites others to pick it to bits! I couldn't resist
