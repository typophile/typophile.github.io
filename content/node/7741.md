    actually already is the name of a, rather famous, world wide stock photo company..
    <BR><i>Maybe you want to take a look at their &#40; current &#41; logo.:</i> <BR>

  body: Lynn is it a local, only one location, camera shop? Do they develop/print
    film/pics also? Is the building which they are in inspire anything? Modern? Arts
    &amp; Crafts?

  body: Lynn, you might want to make sure it doesn&#39;t look anything like the stock
    photo companies logo. I bet they have a battery of lawyers. The first thing you
    might do is make sure it reads Image Bank as two words. As for the business could
    you give more background on what they do?
