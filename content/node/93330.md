  for the rest of my days. \r\n\r\nThis font had been used to brand our store and
  the company that created the branding went out of business long ago. I'm hoping
  to find this font so I can continue to use it in our marketing materials. "

  body: "I doesn\u2019t look like a font. Compare the three \u2018o\u2019 glyphs:
    Each of them is different from the two others. You would get that by applying
    an erosion effect to a typeface, in this case maybe something like <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/singles/process_type_foundry/klavika_medium_ot/?&fg=000000&bg=ffffff&sample_size=96&sample_text=Bookstore&ft=liga&acs_pt=32\">Klavika</a>
    or <a href=\"http://www.stormtype.com/typeface-etelka-narrow-medium.html\">Etelka</a>."

    if you use the Edit link to move the thread up to the main Type ID Board, others
    could chime in with suggestions.\r\n\r\nEdit: R., I suspect the \u201Ceroded\u201D
    effect is due to reproduction of a poor original sample."
