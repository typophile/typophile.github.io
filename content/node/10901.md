body: Impressica is a distressed face I did for the 25th annual Seattle International
  Film Festival poster. I think that most distressed computer generated faces lack
  detail when printed in large size so with Impressica I have an average of 130 elements
  in each letter. This however became problematic when importing and  generating postscript
  in Fontographer, as there is too many points, so it was left as eps files and I
  hand set it when I use it. There is 2-3 alternated for each letter.  <BR><IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/your_image.gif"

  body: ' Hey Ole. I like this. I enjoy distressed faces where you can see that the
    designer had to work a bit  to arrive at a finished product. In other words, it
    takes a lot of work to make the font to be distressed and more work to pathfinder
    the interior of these suckers. Nice job. <BR> <BR>I&#39;m curious if anyone&#39;s
    counted the maximum number of points or elements that Fontographer can comfortably
    handle without graying to eps.  <BR> <BR>Also, IN GENERAL, I think that distressed
    faces &#40;not grunge, let&#39;s retire that font description&#41; speak to a
    younger audience better than non-distressed, especially younger males. I have
    some anecdotal information about this, but I&#39;d like to see if it holds true
    over a wider number. <BR> <BR> <BR>Your background image, like in some of your
    other posts, is nifty. <BR> <BR>Of the 100 ways to make a distressed face, I like
    the sponge technique with white out or white paint and a rescan. Next time I do
    it this way, I&#39;m going to try a Brillo pad, too. I was thinking that might
    yield some cool results. <BR> <BR> <BR><IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"

  body: ' Hi Brian, yes it sure is fun getting &#34;hands on&#34; manual work / off
    screen. Impressica was partially designed with old dry rub-off lettering. The
    SIFF poster features a poor bastard with the camera mounted into his head &#40;who
    happens to be myself&#41;  I did this job with Robin Bartholick a good friend
    and and excellent photographer. We shot 13 rolls of 4x5 and had the best shots
    drum scanned. Final piece was 23 x 32 inches as I recall. You can see more of
    Robins work at www.bartholick.com. <BR>As far as maximum points, I believe it
    is around 2000 '

  body: ' What I find cool about Impressa is that it combines a distressed effect
    on an already &#34;progressive&#34; &#40;in this case: partially serifed&#41;
    foundation, so the result seems &#34;extra-futuristic&#34; so to speak. Nice.
