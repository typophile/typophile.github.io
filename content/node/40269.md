    me of Laszlo Moholy-Nagy's experimental \"Light-Space Modulator.\" (In motion

    crappy one here in the US. It reminds me of Microsoft\u2019s derided Silverlight
    logo. If they animated that thing, it would be so awesome. Of course, the animation
    would need to be done in Flash so people could actually watch it\u2026"

    but I'm fighting the urge... I'm supposed to be making pizza after all. I think
    there is a difference, but is in the 'tail' because one ends normally and the
    other just carries on. But what about the guy on the ladder... Government worker
