  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Hey there! <BR> <BR>Forgive any noobie questions, but I&#39;m at a bit of a loss and I don&#39;t know where to turn... Here&#39;s my situation: <BR> <BR>I work for a book publishing company. We&#39;ve set up a system where researchers enter information into an online database which we can then export, import into Quark, run some formatting programs, and have a fully-formatted book. The only thing that&#39;s holding us up is handling icons.  <BR> <BR>Currently, we have to hand-place icons in the book. I would like to fully-automate the process by creating a custom font that has these icons in it. Then all I&#39;d have to do is have the database spit out a string of letters and the row of icons would pop up, correctly spaced and formatted. <BR> <BR>If the icons were vector, I don&#39;t think I&#39;d have any troubles. However, since the icons are hand drawn and do not lend themselves to vector design, I need to do them as bitmaps. Here&#39;s where I&#39;m running into troubles. <BR> <BR>I&#39;m using Fontographer, and I&#39;ve figured out how to create the necessary bitmap version of the icons, but whenever I export the font and try to use it, the bitmap doesn&#39;t show up. It&#39;s as if the program is looking for a vector version of the font that doesn&#39;t exist and won&#39;t see the bitmap version. <BR> <BR>So basically my question is: is there any way to create a bitmap-only font using Fontographer? <BR> <BR>Thanks very much! <BR> <BR>--eric</div>

		<div class="commentbody">What&#39;s Fontographer?  <BR> <BR>If at all, BitFonter should probably be your choice for bitmap fonts &#40;<a href="http://www.fontlab.com/html/bitfonter.html" target="_blank">http://www.fontlab.com/html/bitfonter.html</a> &#41; as it supports the widest range of bitmap font formats. However, I think most bitmap fonts work on screen, but not necessarily in print.  <BR> <BR>Adam</div>

		<div class="commentbody">&#34;True&#34; bitmap fonts &#40;either stand-alone like FON or NFNT, or embedded like in a TT font&#41; have sort of become bastard children, especially on the Mac side. Your best bet is to make what are called pixelfonts: outline fonts that mimic a bitmap font when used at a certain single point size. They contain blocky paths that snap to the &#34;intended grid&#34;, causing the outlines to render out exactly as the bitmaps would be. They&#39;re supported better than true bitmap fonts because the OSes can&#39;t tell they&#39;re anything besides outline fonts and hence can&#39;t discriminate against them. <BR> <BR>Note: another option is to use hinting to get an outline font to render well onscreen, but that&#39;s a lot more work, although it allows a single font file to address more than one size. <BR> <BR>-- <BR> <BR>If your application is narrow enough to accomodate true bitmap fonts however, you can either use BitFonter to generate a FON&#42; file &#40;Adam, is that a supported format?&#41;, or if you&#39;re stuck with Fontographer you can generate a BDF, embed it into a dummy &#40;or even legit&#41; TrueType font using the SBIT utility &#40;free from MS&#41;, and use that TT file. <BR> <BR>&#42; There are cheaper options to do this than BitFonter &#40;possibly including other Pyrus products&#41;, but BF is the most complete, powerful true bitmap font product out there. <BR> <BR>If you get stuck, and you have a budget for consulting, give me a ring, since I&#39;m in LA too.  :-&#62; <BR>818.507.6907 <BR> <BR>hhp</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Thanks very much for all your help! It looks like the best bet is for me to recreate the icons in Illustrator, since the bitmaps probably won&#39;t look good enough for print, no matter what I do. <BR> <BR>Thanks everyone for your input! And hhp - I&#39;ll hold onto your number; we may need consulting on other projects in the future ;&#41; <BR> <BR>Best,</div>
