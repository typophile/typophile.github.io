body: Hey, I'm looking for a unique pixel font to accompany a soft rounded corner
  style design. Something not too small, very legible but with a little more style
  than the standard pixel font. Maybe a bit rounded feel or a few pixel flourishes.
  Something with a nice zen feel or camping woodsy feel could be nice? I will be using
  Akzidenz bold for headings. And am looking around myself but there are tons of fonts
  available.

    Superscript of the former and 04b-30 of the latter are killers! ;\xB0)"
