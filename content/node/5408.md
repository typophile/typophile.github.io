body: We use a specific dingbat to end articles for our monthly magazine. Ten years
  ago, when we went digital and purchased Macs, the person who installed the equipment
  was able, somehow, to digitize the dingbat and create a font. We use Quark to layout
  the magazine and this font has worked well over the years. <BR>Now, we are going
  to switch to InDesign and this font is causing major problems. None of Adobe&#39;s
  CS applications will recognize it. Highlighting the typed &#34;B&#34; character
  and switching to the logo font causes Illustrator to quit; Photoshop reports an
  error but stays active; and InDesign justs thinks the font is not available even
  though it shows up in the font listing. BTW, we are using MasterJuggler to manage
  fonts. <BR>I&#39;m thinking that the dingbat was not properly digitized and hinted
  and generally, wasn&#39;t done right. I now need to find someone who can create
  a new font for us that will work with our new software. We are in the DC area &#40;northern
  VA&#41;--does anyone know of a font design/foundry house that could do this for
  us? <BR> <BR>Thanks, <BR>Kathy

    the ugly ones but they are easier than the beautiful ones. So either way. <BR>
    <BR>The question I would have to ask first is this. Are you planning to copy an
    existing font &#40;dingbat&#41;? That is where intellectual property rights comes
    into play. <BR> <BR>Dingbats fall into a higher level of copyright protection
    because they are not a letter of the alphabet. What they are is &#34;artwork&#34;.
    <BR> <BR>We were ripped off by a very large printer company who made that mistake.
    They redigitized a font of ornaments claiming we did not have protection because
    fonts were not protectable. They font out that ornaments are. They sent us $30,000
    and stopped using them. <BR> <BR>You can write me a message by clicking on my

  body: Kathy, I don&#39;t want to steal Gerald&#39;s thunder but you may want to
    try opening and resaving the font with a tool like TypeTool or FontLab or Fontographer.
    It sounds like there is something incomplete about the font file. There may be
    nothing wrong with the digitization of the artwork itself, but with the settings
    that are present or not present in the font file. <BR> <BR>By all means seek expert
    help and pay to have it done if you don&#39;t want the technical headache of sorting
    this out yourself. <BR> <BR>Jon

  body: Yes, the best way to fix this would be to give the problem font to somebody
    who has the right tools and knows how to use them, and let them do it. Probably
    won&#39;t take them long &#40;less than an hour in all likelihood&#41;, and probably
    less expensive than buying the tools yourself. <BR> <BR>T

  body: Could be a bug of some sort in our applications. But Kathy said it affected
    all the Creative Suite applications, so it&#39;s more than just an InDesign glitch.
    <BR> <BR>In my experience, these sorts of things are usually font bugs. Overwhelming
    majority of the time, in fact. Sometimes they are bugs that don&#39;t affect other
    applications because they don&#39;t use the fonts in the same way. <BR> <BR>For
    example, this month I ran into a problem where some Type 1 fonts from a major
    second-tier font vendor were behaving improperly in the CS apps for a major New
    York/national paper trying to deploy the Creative Suite. Turned out the problem
    was that they had messed up in the PostScript FullName, where they had left out
    the style as part of the name and made the FullName just equal the family name.
    Turns out that the PostScript spec itself says the style should be part of the
    FullName, and our apps were relying on it as part of making consistent cross-platform
    menu names for Type 1 fonts. <BR> <BR>Anyway, just goes to show that there are
    obscure things about how fonts are supposed to be made, but often these are easy
    to fix. <BR> <BR>Cheers, <BR> <BR>T

  body: Thanks for all your advice. Thomas, I think my font problem just might be
    what you mentioned. The font is named AUSA Logo &#40;suitcase&#41; and AUSALog
    &#40;printer font&#41;. In ID, it shows the name just fine but I can&#39;t select
    roman, italic, bold, bold italic, regular or any other style; it&#39;s blank.
    PS and AI don&#39;t care so much about that initially but ID sure does seem to.
    <BR>The dingbat is one that we created--a little cannon! How cute! So we don&#39;t
    have any copyright or intellectual conflicts, just the font  problem. So, someone
    who has the proper tools could look at the parts, including the name, and fix
    it with little or no fuss? <BR>How would I go about finding someone to do this?
    I&#39;ll definitely contact Gerald and see what he says but I could just post
    here &#40;in this forum or another&#41;? <BR> <BR>Thanks again. <BR>Kathy

  body: 'Kathy, if the problem is just the names, I think anyone with a font making
    program can correct it. Opening it in FontLab, under the File/Font Info dialogue
    box you can correct the names so they are consistent, and re-export it as a font.
    I assume you can do this in Fontographer also. '

    it is the same problem &#40;amusing co-inky-dink, that&#41;, then it&#39;s pretty
    darn trivial to fix. With testing, maybe 15-20 minutes. If you want to keep the
    format as Mac Type 1, you&#39;ll just need somebody who has the right tools, on
    a Mac. <BR> <BR>T
