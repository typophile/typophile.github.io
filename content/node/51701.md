  within the last year. It might have been reminiscent of Black Slabbath, but I can't
  remember if it had slabs or not.\r\n\r\nMaybe it was done by a student or novice,
  not sure.\r\n\r\nIt seemed to have something clever happening with negative space,
  if I remember correctly.\r\n\r\nI thought it was in the critique forum, but I can't
  seem to find it there or anywhere else. :/\r\n\r\nthanks\r\n\r\n"

  body: "I'm also looking for a thread from these forums without much luck so far,
    and we might be looking for the same thing.\r\n\r\nIf I remember correctly, there
    were two weights representing the extremes of ultra-heavy and ultra-light. The
    stem width of the ultra-light weight was equal to the counter width of the ultra-black.
    Furthermore, most of the glyphs had the same width in both weights.\r\n\r\nDoes
    anyone else remember this?"

    wonder if this answers Beejay's question as well."
