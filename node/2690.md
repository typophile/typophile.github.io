  body: Very Nice italic, I  like it very much, specially the joined script one. <BR>
    <BR>I think that the ascenders and descenders can be a pixel longer, this can
    be a matter of taste but I think that at least the &#34; l &#34; and the &#34;
    t &#34; do need it. Also think that the spacing can be a pixel tigther. <BR> <BR>I
    edited the central column of the poem &#40;it has a mark&#41; to show how the
    color is enhaced by these modifications. <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/24003.gif"
