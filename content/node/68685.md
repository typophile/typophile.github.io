  [[Arabic]] fonts.\r\nFor a long time I was looking for a design guide for Arabic
  fonts on internet for accomplishing my own design of nastaaliq-shekasta, but didn\u2019t
  find ANYthing else than a few companies that just sell their products. I have many
  troubles with Arabic OpenType features especially mkmk, mark and kashiada[?].\r\n*Could
  you introduce me a free guide or handbook about Arabic fonts, or a complete OpenType
  features guide?\r\n* How can I learn about mkmk and mark? could you help me?\r\n*
  Which programs you are using to design OTF tables? \r\n* Can I ask some more questions
  here? or this forum is just for experts?"

    forum</a> a useful place to ask such questions.\r\n\r\nAlso check out the <a href=\"http://forum.fontlab.com/microsoft-visual-opentype-layout-tool-volt-b24.0/\">MS
    VOLT tool forum</a>. VOLT is the preferred tool for building OpenType Layout tables
    for most Arabic font development.\r\n\r\nDo you read Persian? The best book on
    the writing of Persian styles is <em>Ta\u2019lim-e Khatt</em> by Habib-ollah Faz\u0101eli.
    This is a calligraphy manual, but does a better job than most of describing the
    grammar -- the rules and permitted variations -- of the nastaliq and other styles,
    and understanding the grammar of a script style is the first step in being able
    to faithfully represent that style typographically.\r\n\r\nThe OTL mark and mkmk
    features are fairly easy to understand, I think. These features dynamically position
    combining marks such as vowel signs to letters (mark) and to other marks (mkmk).
    This is done by defining anchor attachment points on the mark and on the base
    letter or mark. This can be done in VOLT."

    about the \r\n\u062A\u0639\u0644\u064A\u0645 \u062E\u0637: \u062D\u0628\u06CC\u0628\u200C\u0627\u0644\u0644\u0647

    ligatures by scanning its pages and converting they to Bezier curves. (but finally
    the book was destroyed :-(  and I bought another one!)\r\n\r\nand about mkmk and
    mark: I know what they do and how they work, but do you think it\u2019s so difficult
    to mark each haraka on each letter? I\u2019m looking a python macro for automatically
    calculating position and creating top and bottom anchors in FontLab. \r\nanother
    problem: anchors of FontLab 5.0 are not generated when outputting ttf file\u2026
    \r\nand a personal question: your name is not Iranian or Armenian, but your icon
    in site is in Nastaliq Style; do you read Farsi?  why you learn?\r\n"

    and creating top and bottom anchors in FontLab.</em>\r\n\r\nI'm not aware of any
    macro to do this within FontLab, and am not sure that it is possible. <a href=\"http://www.sakkal.com/\">Mamoun
    Sakkal</a> offers a service for automatic mark positioning that some of my clients
    have used. He uses proprietary software to analyse and calculate mark positioning,
    and provides the result as a VOLT GPOS lookup .vtl file.\r\n\r\n<em>another problem:
    anchors of FontLab 5.0 are not generated when outputting ttf file\u2026</em>\r\n\r\nYes,
    this is a limitation of the current FontLab. It relies on Adobe FDK code for OpenType
    Layout, and uses an earlier FDK that did not support GPOS anchor attachments.
    This is one of the reasons why VOLT remains the preferred tool for Arabic font
    development. I understand that FontLab Studio 6.0 will support this feature.\r\n\r\n<em>your
    name is not Iranian or Armenian, but your icon in site is in Nastaliq Style; do
    you read Farsi?</em>\r\n\r\nNo, I do not. I design make fonts for lots of different
    writing systems -- sometimes in collaboration --, and can't learn all the languages
    involved. My icon was a gift sent to me by a colleague: my name written by a calligrapher.
    I liked it so much, I made it my Typophile icon."

    consider not making ligature glyphs but, instead, breaking them down into smaller
    components that can be contextually substituted and arranged using the 'curs'
    feature. This will make your font much smaller and more flexible."
