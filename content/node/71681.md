  Al. My boss and his wife were watching TV last night and a Pamprin commercial came
  on. \r\n\r\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CYRXo-KjTok \r\n\r\nMy boss LOVED the
  grayed out 'Pamprin' logo in the commercial and my job is to find out what the font
  is. I called around a little and used whatthefont.com and it gave me similar results,
  but nothing exact. The 'a' is what he really likes. Can you help me? :) \r\n\r\nI
  contacted the actually company and they left a message with their ad agency that
  created the commercial, but they may never contact me back. I know it is a weird
  request.\r\n\r\nYour site is very interesting by the way!!\r\n\r\nThanks for any
  help at all :)[img:sites/default/files/old-images/logo_pamprin_lrg_4021.jpg]"
