    references), as for actual themes you could look at climate change, extinction,

  body: "You could also go for a set of proportions from nature such as a Fibonacci
    sequence, which happens to approximate the golden section closer and closer as
    the sequence progresses. Or what about a font based on human nature? 'Nature'
    can be a lot of things.\r\n"

  body: "Wow...thanks a lot guys, timb, cool links, i looked them over, and all of
    them were real inspirational. Stephen, the sites you posted were good stuffs too
    (the kids are gonna love the Zoo site), and clauses, although your post are a
    bit off-topic, because i made a mistake of not mentioning 'simple objects of nature
    i.e. animal shapes, ornaments', but your recommendation got me pondering the most,
    about a brilliant concept of using 'unfelt' sense of nature into my design, i'll
    look it up. More importantly, you guys showed me the true meaning and the fun
    of exploring various concepts when trying to come up with innovational but meaningful
    inventions. \r\n\r\np.s. My English is kinda broken, so forgive me... "

  body: What about jugendstil style letters. I'm not suggesting you design a jugendstil-font,
    because that's most likely kinda cheesy, but the shapes in that particular style
    were inspired by nature. Maybe you can adopt certain things of that.

  body: "the problem with all of these fonts is most of them (except tulip) are actual
    representation of ornaments or natural things that are inspired of nature. so
    they are more like photos, than typefaces.\r\n\r\nthe thing is, you need to look
    at pictures of the nature and not copy a flower per-se, but to seek a kind of
    \"graphic language\" or \"behavior\" in the nature. for example, i can take a
    metal spring. take pictures of it, bend it, stretch it, in order to see how it
    \"behaves\" in different poses. then make a design of typeface that emulates that
    springy behavior, but never forgets the legibility and the graphic nature of the
    latin type. \r\nit's like a hybrid."

    would say organic. With the idea of organic in mind maybe you would expand your
    thoughts beyond something totally literal.
