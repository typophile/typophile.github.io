body: Hello, <BR> <BR>Hello, I am new to this group and need some help! <BR> <BR>My
  problem is that I am using a font within a dynamic text field in Flash. This setting
  means that I can&#39;t reduce the letterspacing within the programme and I need
  the letterspacing to be very tight. To get around this problem, I am going to create
  a variant of the typeface that I am using which has the reduced letterspacing encoded.  <BR>
  <BR>I don&#39;t want to have to alter kerning pairs, but actually want to keep the
  original kerning of the typeface and reduce the spacing across the board - to emulate
  what programmes like Photoshop and Flash do, but in the font. <BR> <BR>Is this possible
  to do? Which programme should i use? Any advice would be great.  <BR> <BR>Thanks
  in advance <BR>Will

  body: If you have Fontographer, you can do it with the Set Metrics command. Select
    all characters first, then do Set Metrics, check &#34;Right sidebearing&#34; and
    &#34;Selected Characters&#34; and under &#34;What to do&#34; choose &#34;Decrease&#34;
    with an appropriate value in em units. &#40;An em unit is one thousanth of an
    em usually.&#41; <BR> <BR>In FontLab, you can do the same thing using Tools &#62;
    Transform... &#62; Metrics &#62; Adjust metrics, checking the box that says &#34;Apply
    to whole font.&#34;

  body: Thanks for your reply, that&#39;s great.  <BR> <BR>Would you suggest only
    reducing the right sidebearing rather than both left and right? <BR> <BR>Will

  body: Yes, that&#39;s essentially what happens when you kern &#40;at least with
    left-to-right-reading scripts :-&#41; .
