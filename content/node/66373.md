body: "Morning all,\r\n\r\nI have  been set the task of coming up with a nice large
  website header, as you can see Im going down the typography path. The first obstacle
  I have encountered is that I am limited in terms of typeface choice due to it needing
  to be web safe. I am a big fan of typography that mixes sans and sans serif and
  also the quirkiness of playing with the reader in terms of where the eye goes.\r\n\r\nWhat
  I would like to ask you pros is despite my limitation regarding choice of typefaces
  does arial and century work well together? Are there any issues that jump out? Overall
  whats your opinion?\r\n\r\nThis site is a godsend, thanks alot.\r\n\r\nPhil.  "

  body: It might look better if the x-heights of the letters were similar. The moving
    x-height in the first word disconcerts me a bit.

    rather than arial?

  body: "I think there's a bit too much going on there. I like the idea of overlaying
    the phrases, but I'm not so sure it works in implementation. It's a clever idea
    but is getting in the way of clearly communicating. \r\n\r\nI'd suggest keeping
    the two typefaces, but actually split the phrases (so that 'we are' is in a sans
    face, but not mashed into the 'welcome' phrase)\r\n\r\nEDIT: ah, you are wanting
    to web-safe faces. As such, I'd definitely suggest not mixing the faces in the
    same phrase, as you will have little control over x-height given the variety of
    flavors the faces you choose may come in.\r\n\r\nAlso, there's no reason you can't
    also spec Helvetica and then let Arial be the fall-back. I'd suggest letting Georgia
    be a fall back for Century as well.\r\n\r\nAlternatively, maybe use this as an
    excuse to play with @font-face. "

  body: "Many Thanks for the posts,\r\n\r\nI really like playing with the double phrase
    and double faces, but i also agree with the communication issue. I need a way
    to keep the quirky double message but also clearly communicate 'welcome to redup
    digital media' and 'we are ...etc'.\r\n\r\nwhatever sans-serif face is used (arial
    or helvetica) will be continued throughout the site as body copy, i may use the
    serif face for menu items and headers, call outs etc. therefore continuing the
    mixed face theme throughout the site.\r\n\r\nIn this example I have used colour
    to identify between the 2 phrases but kept welcome as century.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/typeidea2_3688.png]"

  body: "I think double phrase idea is A-Ok, it is trivial to recognize both parts.
    I agree with aluminum in that there is too much going on, but I think there's
    an alternative to what he is suggesting. Differentiating parts using both color
    <em>and</em> type is what is excessive. I would stick with the color difference
    and keep the type the same. It should work just fine that way.\r\n\r\nAlso, as
    a side note - I <em>really</em> do not like this new trend of highlighting parts
    of the content by using different background color. Your version is probably one
    of the better ones, done with taste and restraint, but this still has too much
    of <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuro-linguistic_programming>NLP</a> context
    to it. Like 25th frame kind of thing. I am left with an impression that you are
    trying to hard to <em>force</em> me to notice things. If you want to highlight,
    do it conventionally, through italics or text color variation. Just my 2c, feel
    free to ignore."

  body: "I think it's working out better with we and lcome being the same face.\r\n\r\nAlas,
    that leaves 'are' sticking out a bit much. I'd suggest setting 'are' in the serif
    face as well.\r\n\r\n@apankrat, I think the highlights are to indicate links.
    As such, italicizing them wouldn't be enough to indicate that they are links.
    That said, I'm not sure the background color shows they are links either. I'd
    \ look at working on some sort of traditional underline or going with an actual
    color. "

  body: "again thanks for the feedback, i have amended the 'are' to century and it
    does look alot cleaner. the colour alone suggests the double phrase. Another idea
    i toyed with is changing the phrase to:\r\n\r\n'welcome.\r\nredup digital media\r\nare
    etc...'\r\n\r\nthis then eliminates the 'to are' which obv makes no sense...\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/type3_4365.png]"

  body: I'd move the 'are' up to the second line, and put the 'web developers' underneath
    that. Now the name is the thing that disturbs the 'we are'-design (that looks
    most important), which is not what you'd want.
