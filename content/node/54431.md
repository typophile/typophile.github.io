  Aurora Grotesk, an old metal face used a lot in the early 20th century. I emailed
  the webmaster and he directed me to <a href=\"http://www.urbanfonts.com/fonts/Reservoir_Grunge.htm\">this
  link</a>.\r\n\r\nHas someone done a digitisation of Aurora Grotesk before, making
  this just a rip off, or has someone genuinely made a digital replica of this old
  metal family?"

    genuine digital replica in this case?

  body: The Berthold AG made PS Type 1 fonts of 7 different Staromat styles (light,
    bold etc. etc.) of Aurora in the years 1991 and 1992. This was shortly before
    the bankruptcy. The Hunt ripoff outfit does not sell these due to trademark conflict
    with the name Aurora which could not be registered by Harvey and Melissa Hunt.
    The Bitstream outfit made PS fonts of two narrow Aurora styles selling them also
    under the name "Swiss 939" (see http://www.sanskritweb.net/forgers/bitstream2.pdf,
    page 2).

  body: "I am quoting from the blurb on Myfonts website\r\n\r\n\u2018\r\nAnnonce is
    a digitization and expansion of a 1912 Johannes Wagner Foundry classic called
    Aurora Grotesk, which also circulated later on in metal under the name Annonce.\r\n\r\nBold,
    extended and clear as a bell, Annonce stood out as the definite big sign font
    long before Helvetica and Venus.\u2019\r\n\r\nI am not sure that you can be clear
    that it was an original design of Johannes Wagner; the same typeface appears under
    a multiple of names in the Handbuch der Schriftarten, p210, 1926:\r\n\r\nKrupp-Hallo,
    \ Wagner & Schmidt and then Ludwig & Mayer\r\nVenus-Grotesk, Breite fette, Bauersche
    Gie\xDFerei\r\nAkzidenz-Grotesk, Breite fette, Haas\u2019sche Schriftgie\xDFerei\r\nSiegfried-Grotesk,
    D. Stempel\r\nKolo\xDF, Breite, J. John S\xF6hne, Hamburg\r\nKlassische Grotesek,
    Breite fette, J. D. Trennert & Sohn\r\nEdel-Grotesk, Fette, Ludwig Wagner\r\nProgre\xDF-Grotesk,
    C. E. Weber\r\nFavorit-Grotesk, Otto Weisert\r\n\r\nNow which is the original?
    It seems to me that the design is quite different from the regular width and weights
    of Aurora, suggesting that is not part of the original design. More likely that
    it was added to the family at a later date, and then given the name Aurora to
    benefit from the \u2018brand name\u2019\r\n"

  body: "Thanks for all the information!\r\n\r\n@twardoch i wondered if anyone had
    already made a digital version which this Reservoir Grunge ripped off, or if it
    was the first digital version of the font to pop up.\r\n\r\nIt seems that the
    font has been around digitally for a while as Annonce though.\r\n\r\n On another
    note, it seems that many old faces held a multitude of names credited to a multitude
    of different designers. Was this because of laxer copyright rules back then, or
    because of a different attitude to sharing and collaborating and/or the need to
    claim the credit?"

    to find the origins for this for a couple of years now, and indeed we came upon
    most of the faces you mentioned.

  body: "Hello Rafe, Antonio addressed me to this thread.\r\n\r\nAs Uli already said,
    Aurora is a C.E. Weber typeface. I have not been able to determine a precise date
    yet, the earliest records I have found would state a date around 1912. The narrower
    weights came later.\r\nThe cut of Aurora Grotesk you are looking for is the boldest
    version of the extended weights: Aurora-Grotesk Breitfett (\"Garnitur V\").\r\nThe
    Aurora family has been generically credited to Johannes Wagner, but the family
    is described in Weber specimens (I have two) as an \"Hauschnitt\" (in-house) design.
    While I'm pretty sure the original version is Weber's, at the time the design
    was so widespread that almost every German foundry had its version (some with
    very small differences). It may even be that some of them were produced as authorized
    versions after the original. In Italy we had Nebiolo's own version, Cairoli, and
    in Spain they had Grotesca Ideal, produced by the Gans foundry.\r\n\r\nIt's quite
    difficult to find faithful digital versions of the Aurora family outside the two
    condensed weights mentioned by Uli, which are well done and available from Bitstream
    in Type1 and Truetype format. Optimo's Dada Grotesk is an interpretation steering
    towards a less geometric and late 19th century feeling, but not really faithful
    to the original.\r\nI don't know about the quality of Annonce; in general Canada
    type's digital versions do not look accurate to me.\r\n\r\nEDIT: A thank you to
    Henning Krause, Erik Spiekermann and Elena (from Spain) for the help in my research
    so far."

    that the fonts depicted were photocomposition fonts, perhaps drawn from some of
    the old Berthold Staromat photo-typesetting fonts, but Berthold offered twelve
    Aurora alphabets, not only seven."
