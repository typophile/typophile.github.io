  noticed, in a paper in the second of two volumes bound in the tome (volume 8), equations
  like this:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/limit_pound_5059.jpg]\r\n\r\nIt
  turns out that the British pound sign, being a stylized L for \"librum\", was here
  used instead of the usual abbreviation \"lim\" for limit.\r\n\r\nSomewhat later,
  out of curiousity, I looked for examples of the early development of the integral
  sign, and I found out that its very first  use was in the paper in which Leibnitz
  explained this newfangled thing called calculus. It was signed \"G. G. L.\" - Wilhelm
  was Latinized to Giugielmo, as in Marconi, and it was signed by his initials since
  he was one of the founders of the journal, Acta Eruditorum, in which it was published.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/first_integral_4883.jpg]\r\n\r\nThis
  was from July, 1686. Note that while the long s was indeed used as a symbol with
  the meaning 'summation', it was a normal Roman long s rather than an italic long
  s in its first appearance."

  body: "And here's a very early example of the modern notation for the definite integral,\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/definite_4831.jpg]\r\n\r\nfrom
    Fourier's Th\xE9orie Analytique de Chaleur.\r\n\r\nExcept for putting the du first
    instead of last, and putting a period after the abbreviation for the sine function,
    this differs little from modern notation. However, in other places, there are
    bigger differences; an integral from 0 to X of an integral in dx appears in one
    spot - today, the use of the upper and lower case of the same letter would be
    considered confusing, and avoided sedulously - and while some integrals are shown
    as going from -\u221E to +\u221E, at other points in the book 1/0 is used instead
    of the infinity symbol."
