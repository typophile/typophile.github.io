  body: "The text below could be set in Stephenson Blake\u2019s Guildford Sans.\r\nThe
    logo, although it's probably customized, is tied to the style of lettering of
    Frank Lloyd Wright, which was adapated as a digital typeface by P22 and Monotype,
    in different ways.\r\n\"Fine\" is probably handwritten."
