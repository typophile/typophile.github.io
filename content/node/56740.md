  for all glyphs for all fonts. \r\n\r\nI'm thinking of something like 'Paste Special'
  where you can select all glyphs, copy the unicode from one font and paste special
  to all other weights thus ensuring consistency.\r\n\r\nIs there any way of making
  it the same for all fonts?\r\n"

  body: "<a href=\"http://www.fontqa.com/\">FontQA</a> can help you making sure that
    all weights have the same character set by comparing glyph names. When your glyph
    names are the same, use \"Glyph \u2192 Glyph Names \u2192 Generate unicode\" in
    FL Studio to regenerate the unicodes, and they will also be the same in every
    weight."
