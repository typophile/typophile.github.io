  artist used a couple of years ago.  Unfortunately I can't contact him as he's no
  longer in business.\r\n\r\nIt appears that either the font is a modified version
  of the JLR Chinese Love Letter font (see attached image or url below) or vice versa.
  \ I would be most greatful if anyone is able to identify this font.\r\n\r\nThanks
  in advance.\r\n\r\nSteve\r\n\r\nhttp://www.tmas.us/"
