  me nuts.  All I can really say is that it's not a recent font, as the picture I
  cropped this from is about 11-12 years old.  Any help is greatly appreciated.\r\n\r\nhttp://i65.photobucket.com/albums/h207/xponchx/fife.jpg"

    Condensed MT</a> with a touch of custom work on the "W". The font dates back to
    1935 so no problem with your timeline. ;)
