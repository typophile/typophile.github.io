  body: 'Can you tell us more about it? The spacing on the word computer doesn''t
    quite feel right to me in versions 124&5. The R feels cramped. This design feels
    hasty to me. I think you may want to keep going but before you do come up a clear
    idea of what the logo should mean or perhaps feel like to customers. Before you
    choose something you need to know why you are choosing it. I hope this is helpful. '

  body: "In this instance, it seems that the combination of an italic font and a straight-up
    enclosure doesn't work. \r\n\r\nI agree with Eben regarding the R in the computer
    enclosure.\r\n\r\nAll that said, I like number five the best.\r\n\r\nGood luck!"

    by 10 system </cite>? \r\n\r\nTo be clear; we are not giving a rating to the design
    just saying the last example ( number 5) looks best to us. Maybe you understood
    this.\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Put that way I would have to say I don't know. Maybe it's perfect. Maybe
    it's a huge mistake. I don't have enough context/information to judge. \r\n\r\nMy
    impression is that this design is being made as an abstraction with no relationship
    to the goals especially the marketing goals of the company. Maybe that's not true
    but it is how it will seem without more context. \r\n\r\nIf that is the case;
    if there is no clearly identified goal; then you are just throwing your design
    dart randomly. You might succeed in the design but the chances are very low!\r\n\r\nDesign
    is an applied art - as in with a purpose. It's not effective if it just copying
    the popular design tropes or is made as self-expression like fine arts. "

  body: The logo feels fine to me but you need some marketing attached to it initially.
    Explain the business with a tag line. Is it hardware or software or a service?
    You can see how a potential customer could become confused. Make it clear and
    straight forward, once the brand is established you can drop the tag line.
