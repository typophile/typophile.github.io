  body: Interesting. It's like a narrow <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/singles/elsner_flake/diamante_regular/&sample_text=ATLAS%20SHRUGGED&sample_size=60">Diamante</a>
    with contrast.

  body: Once upon a time there was a typeface called <a href="http://www.itcfonts.com/fonts/font/pid/411997/URW+Viking+Gothic+Normal/detail">Viking</a>,
    or at least that is what I knew it as. It had an alternate cap-A. This seems super
    close, albeit a bit [[squooshed]].

    Raleigh Gothic </a> from Grouptype.It has the right R, which the <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/redrooster/raleigh-gothic-rr/\">Red

  body: "I'm pretty sure Mike is right about it being Raleigh Gothic. I would just
    add that it was stretched.\r\n\r\nWhen I designed the audiobook package (the one
    that Stephen linked to), this was the paperback design. We used the same illustration,
    but I wanted to do something a bit different with the design and typography, something
    that fit the illustration style better (in my opinion). "
