  of interesting publication layouts. I found more examples on flickr than trying
  to randomly google things, but its good in some ways since I can look at the work
  and ideas of my peers that are not neccessarily published pieces.\r\n\r\nI like
  the hand done aspect of this one, while still being organized:\r\nhttp://www.flickr.com/photos/curiousmouse/2567037893/\r\n\r\nSimple
  and clean:\r\nhttp://www.flickr.com/photos/willemkitshoff/3055889456/\r\nhttp://www.flickr.com/photos/willemkitshoff/3055053483/\r\n\r\nClean,
  but still interesting:\r\nhttp://www.flickr.com/photos/jeope/976757992/\r\n\r\nI
  like this one a lot. Going outside of the typical confines of a magazine to actually
  make a further product going with the concept:\r\nhttp://www.flickr.com/photos/aeddabaedda/2175766492/\r\n\r\nNice
  use of color and photo/story separation (I like pretty much all of this user's work!):\r\nhttp://www.flickr.com/photos/yonilcom/2973502253/\r\nhttp://www.flickr.com/photos/yonilcom/2974358220/\r\n\r\nLots
  of white space:\r\nhttp://www.flickr.com/photos/juliankleyn/3145576820/\r\n\r\nI
  like the strength the photography has in this layout, as well as the different way
  of doing an interview:\r\nhttp://www.flickr.com/photos/40897889@N00/2760044770/sizes/o/"
