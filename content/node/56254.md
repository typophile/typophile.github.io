  variety I believe...) and I really don't understand it.\r\n\r\nIt certainly has
  appeal because it's much more readable than some of the older fonts out there, but
  I still am having trouble determining if its useful for (concise) paragraphs.\r\n\r\nIt
  sits so delicately on paper that I'm also reluctant to use it for something other
  than a header. Thoughts?\r\n\r\nAny general advice on transitional fonts, period? "

    just too light in the 8-11 point range. MT Baskerville (comes with Mac OS) is
    a little better but still not great. Storm\u2019s John Baskerville and ITC New
    Baskerville are both much better options for text and the lighter Baskervilles
    can be used at display sizes. And there\u2019s also the new Mrs. Eaves XL from
    Zuzana Licko, designed just for text settings, which I\u2019ve only seen onscreen
    and won\u2019t comment on further."

  body: "You make a good observation about how delicately Baskerville sits on paper;
    John Baskerville created it in the 1750s for use on calendared papers, which were
    new at the time. 18th-Century critics wailed that it would cause blindness in
    readers accustomed to Caslon.\r\nIt's difficult for modern readers to understand
    how Baskerville could once have been so controversial. Nowadays it falls into
    the limbo of Transitional types, neither as graceful and warm as the Aldine types
    that preceded it, nor as elegant and dramatic as the Moderns that followed it.
    \r\nFor decades Baskerville was a workhorse for book and publication composition,
    though now there are many better choices. It suggests a quiet dignity, that quintessentially
    British virtue, and it's right for certain jobs. One of my clients used it on
    their holiday cards last year, and it was the perfect choice. "

  body: "@James Deux \r\nYour observation, and James' comments, should help you to
    understand that types listed in Type 101 books are general, and cannot replace
    direct observation. Text faces in particular are hard to fully understand until
    you see a solid chunk of text using a particular cut of a particular font family,
    Baskerville in this case.\r\n\r\nBut you're going to have to qualify the \"it\u2019s
    much more readable than some of the older fonts out there\" statement, since the
    typefaces prior to that, IMO, were much easier to read.\r\n"

    THAT is a statement I'm going to have to chew on for awhile! Which font is quintessentially
    Briton... that's an interesting question and it has me puzzled.\r\n\r\n<cite>But
    you\u2019re going to have to qualify the \u201Cit\u2019s much more readable than
    some of the older fonts out there\u201D statement, since the typefaces prior to
    that, IMO, were much easier to read.</cite>\r\nFor my own purposes I've just done
    a quick comparison of Time, Adobe Garamond, and Baskerville and it becomes immediately
    apparent that the contrast in the strokes of BV are much greater than either of
    the other two fonts. For that reason, there are sizes were you can barely notice
    the letters are present. At least that's my theory; I haven't copyset a book with
    it lately!\r\n\r\n\r\n"
