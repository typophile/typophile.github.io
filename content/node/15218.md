  undecided between [[Storm Type Foundry|Storm]]'s John Baskerville and [[Fountain]]'s
  1757. I am tilted toward Storm, as it does not botyher with bold, which I never
  use, and purports to be close to the original. Any thoughts?"

  body: Thanks, Brant, I'll go for it. Actually, I am pleased you say this, as the
    Storm version comes packaged with the bold variants (as one package). If you want
    smallcaps, you have to buy a whole other package. Fountain just has roman, italc,
    smallcaps. As I don't like bold variants, but want smallcaps, this suits me fine

      No, I go with Fountain

        (the designer of Baskerville 1757) for a while -- his historical motivations
        keep me interested in his work. Bergquist's Baskerville seems a little stiff
        compared to Storm's, but besides the small showing in Indie Fonts 1, I haven't
        seen a printed sample of Baskerville 1757. I've seen Storm's version in a
        printed specimen and it's beautiful -- that's why I'd like to compare the
        two."

      is never the end of the story: it's also a matter of interpretation. We are
      no longer in 1757. I'm starting to think period v modern instruments in classical
      music. The same argument?\r\n\r\nNevertheless, I do like the Fountain. it's
      immensely readable and, despite that stiffness - surely part of the appeal of
      Bodoni, for example? - a great face.\r\n\r\nBut still, do have a look at the
