  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">I&rsquo;ve been looking here and Google for a little while now, and I am still having trouble finding what font was used for the logo on MacGyver.  Was this one of those custom hand-drawn logos, or is it a font (based on a font)?  Any help/answers are greatly appreciated.  Thanks in advance everyone!</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>The show was on starting in 1985, which is mostly pre-digital for fonts, so I looked in books of film types (even though I don&rsquo;t know if this logo dates to the start of the show). I can&rsquo;t say I found anything that jumped out at me as the answer. The G and C are sort of like Copperplate Gothic, but with a Latin-looking serif, although the other letters seem to have only the barest suggestion (if any) of serifs. The closest typeface I found with a slightly similar G (Orchard Wide, in the Photo-Lettering catalog) was similar in general feel and letterforms, except that it had an A that was flattened on top, or had a top serif, as did most of the A&rsquo;s in other similar fonts. Many of these other fonts also had a leg on the R that was more separated from the stem, unlike your logo.</p>
<p>I know my collection of film type references is far from comprehensive, but I was at a loss to find anything very close. This makes me want to say &lsquo;custom&rsquo;, and yet I wonder whether they would have cared enough to pay for custom lettering, given the transience and riskiness of TV series. Maybe someone with a better selection of older typefaces can pin this down, but if I was given the task of re-creating it, and the condition that I had to start with an existing font, I think I would use <A href="http://www.treacyfaces.com/050806_TFArrow_2c5a.html">TF Arrow</a>, which I think was the closest in general shape I could think of. I&rsquo;d have to modify the C and G, but I think it wouldn&rsquo;t be too much work, and might give something close enough to pass casual inspection.</p>
