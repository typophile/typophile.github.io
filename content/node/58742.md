  body: "Build a test file around your standard encoding that shows every letter and
    punctuation mark set against every other letter. You can generate these with Metrics
    Machine if you have it, or just use Indesign\u2019s find and replace within selection
    ability. Run a page of nothing but random number combinations, set up all your
    math and fractions, etc. Make sure to break these into sections or smaller files.
    For diacritics, run at least one paragraph from the UN Universal Declaration of
    Human Rights in every language the font supports. Run Leslie Cabarga\u2019s Kern
    King tests. \r\n\r\nAnd test everything turned sideways. I am convinced that looking
    at Lithuanian text sideways in bad lighting will show off just about every problem
    at once."

  body: The idea is that the lettershapes become more abstract, so you can see the
    space better, because you aren't reading. I think it works better for some people
    than others, though.

    effectively about what you're seeing. ;-)\r\n"

    can read backward and upside down without much trouble, that\u2019s why I go with
    a language I don\u2019t know. But flipping letters around does change the way
    we perceive the balance of spaces whether one can read it or not, so it\u2019s
    a great way to spot spacing problems and wonky curves."

  body: "What altaira said... I would add that you're not just looking at the space,
    but at the overall type color as well (one affects the other)... It will be easier
    to check for a consistent color if your eyes are not distracted from trying to
    read the words...\r\n\r\nEDIT: I posted at the same time as James! What James
    said, too."
