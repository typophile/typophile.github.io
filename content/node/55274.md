body: "Hi,\r\n\r\nI'm after a bit of help and guidance on this one please. The logo
  for the couple is an eternity symbol, and so I'm trying to work it into their names
  (their names being Wesley and Leanne). Attached is the concept, but I'm struggling
  to make it look at all good and legible. Just wondering if anybody had any suggestions,
  any typefaces that would work well etc. Would appreciate any feedback.\r\n\r\nThanks\r\n\r\nDave\r\n"

  body: I could read it with a slight effort, but, yeah, I agree with ^ it <em>is</em>
    somewhat illegible in its current form. Clever concept though, it's certainly
    worth exploring further.

    the symbol.)

  body: I like the idea of the names sort of merging together, but I really feel that
    by connecting the nn to the w the letters on the sides create an imbalance in
    the whole. My suggestion is to stick with the "loops merging"-idea but use the
    z at the end of wez and the l at the beginning of leanne to do it. As you have
    chosen a handwritten kind of type, this should be fairly straightforward.
