  body: It looks kind of like a cross between Handel Gothic and Stainless by Font
    Bureau. I tried a web search for Rangers related PDFs (to see if something like
    it might be embedded for a quick ID) but didn't find much -at least not anything
    with that type in it.

    the only other image I could find at the moment.\r\n\r\nStainless looks pretty
    close apart from slight differences in the R, G and S."
