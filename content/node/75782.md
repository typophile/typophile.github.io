    a Mac?

  body: "@ oldnick\r\n\r\nAnd how to remove all global guidelines more comfortable
    on PC? Is there a command in FontLab? By the way, random guidelines. Does this
    mean the same as global guidelines?\r\n\r\n@ Chris\r\n\r\nWith each new Mac user
    the Mac becomes more attractive for virus programers. It\u2019s not safer, because
    it is so much better programed, as far as I know."

    \r\n\r\nI'm on a Mac, running the Mac version, but I seldom get crashes or run
    into serious bugs. I have run into the exploding guidelines bug maybe two or three
    times ever. (FWIW.)"
