body: "I'm bracing to tackle a redesign of my (fairly small ~2000) school's newspaper.
  I've been looking around at potential typefaces, and thought I'd throw the question
  out to a more experienced crowd.\r\nI'm hoping to pull some bold moves with the
  paper's look and layout, and I don't anticipate anyone being upset if I break tradition.
  I'm generally disappointed with what I've found to be a low readership at school,
  and while I realize it might not be my place as art director to pretend that I can
  make the paper \"better,\" I'm hoping that I can inject some new life into the vision
  and scope of the publication. Especially before it goes the way of other college
  papers\u2014poorly organized websites and blogs.\r\n\r\nAdmittedly, I am an HFJ
  addict, and should probably broaden my vision, if only for budgetary reasons.\r\nRight
  now I'm loving their:\r\n\r\nChronicle Display Compressed Black Italic (and the
  other displays)\r\n(http://www.typography.com/images/productLineImages/chrondispcomp_black_i.gif)\r\n\r\nGosh
  I'm such a sucker, but I even love their suggested combo with Knockout. Ha.\r\n(http://www.typography.com/images/suggestionImages/chrontext-knockout.png)\r\n\r\nMaybe
  before I list off other potentially unrealistic choices, I should open it up more
  generally...\r\n\r\nAre there choices I should stay away from?\r\n\r\n I like to
  think I can have fun with this. This is a paper that is freely distributed. It doesn't
  rely on single issue sales. The content is not vast, and so I think I can be fairly
  luxurious with the layout. To me it sounds like a great opportunity (and probably
  a rare one) to have a lot of fun visually.\r\nAny suggestions? Any interesting typefaces
  that won't break the bank?\r\nAs far as text faces go, I realize that newspaper
  text faces are a science unto themselves, but if you have any solid recommendations
  that might border on edgy (??), that would be cool.\r\n\r\nAlso\u2014don't laugh\u2014would
  HFJ's Acropolis Black Italic be too crazy ???\r\nI'm brand new to the newspaper
  game, and I'm discovering it's another breed of editorial design. They don't mess
  around. Ha\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\n\r\nLuke"

    have no idea if it's a good match. But personally if had the chance i would try
    print af few test spreads with Fred Smeijers's Arnhem typeface and maybe together
    with Fago or DTL Argo. \r\n\r\nMight be too must magazine in looks and feel. But
    hey, just an idea. "

  body: I was going to suggest Arnhem, but I see someone beat me to it. Arnhem is
    a very nice newspaper type, or text typeface for that matter. A fairly recent
    [[http://www.fontshop.be/details.php?entry=226|redesign]] of the Dutch newspaper
    Het Financieele Dagblad uses it very succesfully.

    newpaper design in Europe:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.ted.com/talks/jacek_utko_asks_can_design_save_the_newspaper.html\r\n\r\nInspiring
    and hopefully you'll find something to propel your art direction. :)\r\n\r\nTake
    a look at <b>Galaxie Copernicus</b> (http://www.vllg.com/Village/GalaxieCopernicus/mudTyper+Weights/)
    from <b>Village</b> (http://www.vllg.com/).  Make sure to download the PDF on

    heart. Really beautiful. The sans-serif version is nice too, but the serif family
    is stunning.\r\n\r\n"

    my company to use Galaxie Polaris (the san-serif) as our representative typeface
    but there are too many Helvetica Neue-lovers to combat!\r\n\r\ndaniel"

    just throw this out there as an additional question\u2014\r\ndoes anyone know
    how fluorescent ink (or even white ink) works on newsprint?"
