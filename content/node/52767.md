    Manual of Style</a> set in Scala and Scala Sans is very nicely done. Wish they
    had some images of the interior. I'll have to take some when I get back to the
    office."

    It's on my (rather long) list of books to get. Photographed copy just may move
    that book up the list...\r\n\r\n"
