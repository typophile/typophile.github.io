  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">I am looking to parachute old-style numerals into Helvetica, as part of an effort to use a modified version in a Corporate ID.  

So far, I've been looking at kerning pairs, quote marks, parentheses, ampersand, etc etc in FontLab, and I would love to have proper numerals but I don't quite presume to be able to draw up my own at this point—especially given that they will see heavy use in text applications. 

But I wouldn't mind playing with the size and placement of existing numerals, which I have enough time and confidence to attempt.

Thought Typophiles might find this interesting - - any suggestions? </div>

To Terminal and others whom this thread may tempt : Respectfully, I have no interest in anyone's opinions on Helvetica - the parameters of the job are what they are ( and happen not to be up to me ) 

Yes, I realize there are historic reasons against old style numerals in Helvetica, running text is counterintuitive etc : let me point to the initial post and say that the final result will not be your grandmother's Helvetica, and politely ask everyone to stay on topic.  : )</div>

I would advise you however, that if you are modifying existing Helvetica font data for a Corporate Identity, you may be asking for some very severe licensing/legal headaches.

And as you say that the final result will not be my grandmother's helvetica. I will remind you that if you start with my grandmother's helvetica font data and modify it with your soon-to-be beautiful oldstyle figures, you will, most likely, be legally required to license my grandmother's helvetica if you want to distribute your new and improved version.</div>

Terminal, thanks for the legal advice and looking out for me. I will look into it further and advise my client to as well, but it is my understanding that as long as they own the license to Helvetica, they can use our mod. I am not selling them a font, nor am I representing it as my work, I am rendering the service of modifying its functions AS Helvetica, which is tantamount to adjusting kerning, baseline-shifting, letterspacing and using it along with other fonts, in the case of switched ampersand, numerals and other characters. This would be  what we are getting payed to do as relates to that font. </div>

		<div class="commentbody">Riccard0 - thanks for that; very cool find indeed. A cursory look at the numerals has me convinced that their starting point is the same as my own proof-of-concept : i.e. they've shifted most numerals up or down, used the <em>lc</em> ‘o' as the zero, shortened the 1 and winged a 2.. 

I will have to take a look at its behavior, because the snags I ran into upon investigating my own 'faked' versions is that there is no end of trouble arising from the 1,2, 3 & 7 in terms of their tone in a body of text and 'visual' x-height—especially apparent at smaller sizes. I see their 2 is dramatically different. It's either that they compressed the 2 or that they know something I don't. I'll take a look - thanks;

[img:sites/default/files/old-images/HelveticaOldStyle_5319.jpg]

BTW : I wouldn't want to discourage other suggestions. The idea that there will be numerals that ARE Helvetica is not necessarily the end-goal here... Otherwise, I'd be fighting that battle and not be asking typophile.. It would be valid just to arrive at a selection of numerals that function in the same way as an italic, or a different language, might inside latin text..

Thanks again Riccard0

Yes. The cumbersome but [sufficiently] safe solution would be to draw
them from scratch, and make a separate font for just the new numerals.

Yes, shifting up and down, especially as this was a quick job for an exhibition's signage (the rationale for using lc figures with Helvetica in the first place is given in the above thread).

Basically they're superior because they better match the overall vertical "center-of-gravity" of the lc (when letter frequency is factored in). With the Anglo scheme the chances of ending up with a numeral string that visibly sits too low is much higher.

		<div class="commentbody">I for one don't like the look of tabular lining numerals shifted up and down, I've seen it in one or two fonts before, but it just looks clumsy to me. Anyway: if you want to pursue this direction, I would definately not take the lower case "o" as zero. Rather I would use a perfect circle to make it clearly distinctive. BTW, for another example of gothic with oldstyle figures look at ITC Franklin Gothic book condensed. 

But why not go for another alternative. [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/urw/bell/|Bell]] uses numerals that are ±75% the height of the caps, therefore making them stick out a lot less. It is a rather easy modification to make, and I think it works well in texts. There's probably other examples of this (and a fancy name) but I can't come up with them now.

Miss Tiffany : believe me, I hear you... To assuage some of the skepticism a bit further ( and save some face, lol ) let me explain that the thinking behind this has been to co-opt the, yes, commercial, ‘inclusive' qualities Helvetica can imbue, yet arrive at a singular and unmistakable application of it. There is an element of fun and irreverence intended, which is central to the brand being developed : a fashion house’s lower-cost product line. 

As I said, the Helvetica mandate comes straight from the client, but not out of a place of ignorance : the very idea is taking generic, base elements which may not be ‘ideally suited for the job' and elevating them through decisions made in their use and juxtapositions. A certain level of garishness will ensue if all goes to plan, which will hopefully be part of the charm. That said, we also need good function and so I find great value in a lot of the information here - - the French scheme and Bell scale are both very appetizing indeed...

Thanks again to all! </div>

I find that way too jarring. The problem is that -unlike in a font with weight contrast- in a monoline font your options are limited. This is actually another reason to go with hybrids*, instead of OS nums that fit within the x-height.

* Like in Bell, but up & down too.

		<div class="commentbody">I don't think that using the "French" scheme of numerals would be such a good idea. By applying OsF to a grotesque, you're making a statement - ironic, perverse, whatever. This statement should be clear, so as to become somewhat unobtrusive after the first moment of surprise. By using that quite unusual scheme of numerals you're introducing a second level of typographic sophistication, if you will, that muddles the original point and makes the solution rather less efficient (unless your target public is the Typophile crowd).

Agree with Hrant about the inappropriateness of the perfect circle. That's a Neogrotesque, not a Geometric Sans.</div>

I'm not sure. But looking at this, I think I'd agree that people 
probably wouldn't notice anything funny with the French scheme. 
In a way, I think it even seems more befitting of a "modern" face

Classic, shmlassic. That's so British, subverting functionality to Ye Olde Rules. If you're <em>that</em> close to making the widths the same, you might as well make the two styles uniwidth, which can be helpful. The thing is a slanted-Roman anyway - get real.

Agreed, that width difference is nothing to get excited about. But the bit that made me smile was the weight names: <cite> Off White, White, Light, Medium, Bold, Black.

The cap widths and barless fractions look funky/weird/wrong to me, and I like that effect.

When I've added OSF to a grotesque sans, it's been a non-statement, purely because the InDesign OpenType menu palette calls for it. A default, to avoid the application suggesting that something is missing from the font. Figgins figs:
