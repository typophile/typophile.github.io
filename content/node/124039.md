  \r\n\r\nI've been trying to find this font or something super close to this tirelessly.
  I tried what the font and I ask numerous graphic designer but we've seem to hit
  a dead end. \r\n\r\nIf anyone knows where or how to find this font I would greatly
  appreciate your help! Notice that the capital 'A' and  'G' are so special. \r\n\r\nThank
  you "

  body: I would add, even though, as Theunis rightly says, this is the wrong forum,
    that I am now quite sure this is a typewriter (prob. daisy wheel but could be
    golf ball) and that I have seen the same used on other LP covers of the period.
