  preferably a web safe font for use on a web layout. Not fussed whether it\u2019s
  serif os sans serif, just something that looks clean and contemporary. The logotype
  is VAG rounded light, I\u2019m looking for a secondary font for headers/subtitles
  etc.\r\n\r\nAny recommendations?\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\nRory"

    little less 'personality' so as not to steal the limelight from VAG, maybe something
    a bit more neutral. Cheers for the help though, much appreciated."

    can think of about 10 \"web safe\" fonts, so the choice isn't that huge. But someone
    has asked about webfont embedding just a couple threads up, right here:\r\n\r\nhttp://typophile.com/node/72809\r\n\r\nMaybe
    that helps :)"
