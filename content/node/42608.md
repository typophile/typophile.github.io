  a better solution?"

    called WinSoft. This will let you work with scripts that are right to left running,
    like Hebrew and Arabic.\r\n\r\nAlternatively, you can make a PDF from Word and
    place this as a graphic."

    and then to InDesign?"

    or something that I need to run after pasting the text, or should it work if I
    just copy and paste?\r\n\r\nI'll try your suggestion about copying the text to
    TextEdit and then to InD.\r\n\r\nthanks."

  body: "Hello guys, \r\nI need you help. I am using InDesign CS6 (ME version) and
    I have the following problem when importing text. Namely, whenever I am importing
    text in English or any other left-to-right languages the text is imported right-to-left
    instead. Is there any way to change this? I tried everything but I could not find
    the solution. It brings the whole text and pages right-to-left even though it
    should be left-to-right. Any suggestions? Please, I need your help. I just occasionally
    use Arabic for small amount of text. I was hoping the ME version will work as
    an ordinary one just that I will have more control over Arabic text.\r\nThanks
    in advance!"
