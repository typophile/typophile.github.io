body: "I am completely new to Font Creation/Editing. I don't have any training or
  education except for trial and error.\r\n\r\nI purchased a Handwriting Style Font
  complete with Ligatures and Contextual Alternates, and the product works just fine.
  However I was not happy with some of the Characters of the Font, and also the lack
  of Vowels with Diacritics. So I wanted to modify some Characters and add Characters.
  \r\n\r\nI started out using FontLab Studio and I was seemingly successful in Editing
  everything I wanted but the program wouldn't generate the Font in OTF complete with
  errors, I couldn't find solutions to those issues so I decided to start from scratch
  with Fontographer and I made a few Edits and tested it by attempting to generate
  the Font and it seemed to work, no errors, Font was created, however, when I attempt
  to use the font, the Ligatures and Contextual Alternates don't work. I have those
  settings activated and they work perfectly with the Original Font that I purchased.
  \r\n\r\nI started from scratch again, but before I actually made any changes to
  the Font I again generated the Font through Fontographer as a base line and the
  Font generated by Fontographer still does not work correctly.\r\n\r\nAm I missing
  something? Are there settings or features I need to activate in Fontographer for
  it to make the Font compatible with Ligatures etc.?\r\n\r\nAny ideas or help would
  be greatly appreciated. Thank you."
