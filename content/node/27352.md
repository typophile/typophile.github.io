  The original is from the 1880s and I'm guessing hand-lettered. So I'm looking for
  a font that shares most of its characteristics, especially its width to height ratio
  (on the wider side), stroke thickness (relatively thin), and its very small curlique
  embellishments. Thanks in advance for any suggestions.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/sutro_5640.jpg]"

  body: Your sample (particularly the R) made me think of <a href="http://www.linotype.com/907/kismet-family.html">Kismet</a>,
    which dates from 1879, but its embellishments are perhaps more over-the-top than
    what you're after?

  body: "Hi Stephen, \r\n\r\nThanks for your comment. Yes, one thing I'm looking for
    is the relative smallness/sparseness of the embellishments...so that the letters
    almost look undecorated at first glance."

  body: Thanks for your comments. Maybe what I need is a more neutral typeface with
    alternates, something like <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/wiescherdesign/ela-demiserif/">Ela
    Demiserif</a> and <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/wiescherdesign/ela-swashes/">Ela
    Swashes.</a> Any suggestions?

    target="_blank">Blue Point Normal</a>. Perhaps a similar "feel"?
