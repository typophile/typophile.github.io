body: "I work as a technical writer at a security firm. One of the documents our firm
  uses in all government contracts is called PVT Procedures. This document contains
  test procedures that our installation technicians use during equipment testing events.
  Whoever designed said document was more familiar with the equipment concerned than
  they were with principles of typography and document formatting. I am now redesigning
  the PVT Procedures layout and so seek directive input from you all regarding what
  I've done so far. I've attempted to attach sample before and after images. Hopefully
  you will be able to tell which is which. Note that I'm limited to working with MS
  Word on all documents.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/PVT v1_5341.png]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/PVT

  body: "5.1 Card Reader Tamper Test\r\nThese things go together, so put them together.
    Eliminate the unexplainable space. If these two things are together, the reader's
    eye will be drawn to Card Reader Test, which is what you want. Putting Card Reader
    Test in the event column serves no purpose.\r\n\r\nI would consider putting Event
    and Expected Results beneath 5.1 Car reader Tamper Test. The Event and Expected
    Results are part of the Tamper Test, not floating above it. Then you could put
    Event even with the event column just as Expected Result is (already) even with
    the expected result column. Then rename Event with something more clear, like
    Tester's Actions.\r\n\r\nReal time communications.....\r\nWhat does this mean?
    Shouting? Each person has a cell phone? What?\r\n\r\nMiscellaneous hand tools.....\r\nSo
    the first writer had no clue either. Can you reference something here?\r\n\r\nIn
    the Expected Results Column, The system should not allow...\r\nWhat does this
    mean? What is actually supposed to happen?\r\n\r\nSomething that jumps out at
    me overall is the stilted, third person style. Most instruction is now written
    in an informal second person style. For instance: \"Real time communication with
    the operator should be established.\" Now writer's would tend to say: \"You must
    be able to talk to the operator during the test, such as with a phone line...\"
    \ Maybe that's beyond the scope of this project.\r\n\r\nAll of this is just my
    opinion.\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: "I would do something similar as well.\r\n\r\n<pre>5.1 Card Reader Tamper

    long as the installation techs know and understand the jargon, second v third
    person is hardly vital.\r\n\r\nBy the way, what is supposed to happen in the first
    case is that the system must not/never ignore the tamper switch tripping. To \u2018mask\u2019
    something is to cause it to be ignored.\r\n\r\nReal-time communications\u2026
    Whatever it takes, man. Shouting may do at one site, but the next may well require
    a mobile phone or a walkie/talkie. Some things just can not be nailed fast. Same
    with the handtools. They depend on the hardware the switch is fixed to the case
    with.\r\n\r\nAside: I would change the Initial Conditions from \u201Cshould\u201D
    to \u201Cmust\u201D as the test requires tech and op to be in contact, right?"

  body: I'd designed "event" and "expected results" as floating headings to try to
    streamline. Because there are often several test sections (5.1, 5.2...) within
    a test, one floating heading can take the place of four or five fixed headings.
    I'll move the headings in with the test sections, though, and see how the two
    formats compare. Thanks to J. for pointing out that inexplicable space, and Te,
    you're right about "not allow mask" vs. "ignore," and "should" vs. "must."

  body: "As a science guy, the first draft looks depressingly like one of my undergraduate
    lab reports. I don't have an education in design, but I would consider introducing
    some hierarchy by using two contrasting fonts. Headings in a big thick sans and
    body text in a plain serif will emphasise the text's structure. Definitely agree
    with you that eliminating the columns at the top would be nice. \r\n\r\nHere's
    my redraft, using your text more or less (though I agree second person would be
    better). The spacing of the document is a bit erratic - you could tighten it up.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Test
    Number 5_4844.png]\r\nWith Actions/Expected results, you have a problem: do you
    put it under or over the first test heading? I put it under, you expect to find
    it under the heading. Then for future test sets I didn't bother putting it in
    again, since you know what the columns mean after that.\r\n\r\nYou could also
    put the test instructions in sans-serif to make them stand out, which might help.
    But I felt that made the document a bit blocky and awkward, as the linespacing
    of the test instruction and test result won't match. \r\n\r\nFor fonts, I've used
    Twentieth Century MT and Garamond, both fonts included with Office, since a chunky
    geometric sans and a plain serif make a good contrast, I think. Twentieth Century
    is called Tw Cen for some stupid reason by Microsoft. As Microsoft's Garamond
    is a bit lame, I actually used the much nicer [[http://www.georgduffner.at/ebgaramond/|EB
    Garamond]], which you can get for free. (Obviously there are many premium fonts
    nicer than either of those, but I thought I'd go with ones I'm sure you have already.)"
