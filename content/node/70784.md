  body: "I have not had much luck locating this, partly because these letters are
    not too helpful. It is most common for brand names to be custom designed, rather
    than stock fonts, and i think that's where I'm leaning on this one.\r\n\r\n- Mike

    Triplett Light</a> is rather close. This is a font I always thought of as Friz
    Quadrata without the Friz details.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: "I'm not 100% sure, but I think it was Mr. Karl-Erik Forsberg. During his
    active time as a graphic designer/type designer he made a huge amount of corporate
    logotypes for many big Swedish companies. MAny of them are still around. In some
    cases slightly refined. I have some of his books at work and I'm pretty sure I've
    seen Electrolyx logotype in there.\r\n\r\nCheers"

    house, and the moment I finally realized the logo was a massively over-serifed
    'E' I was completely awestruck. Admittedly I was stoned at the time but still\u2026"
