  It looks similar to Frutiger, but alas, it's not. That uppercase \u201CJ\u201D breaking
  below the baseline got me in the right ballpark, but I suspect I'm just missing
  the obvious. Thanks in advance for any direction / help.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/JMBH_C_Blk_5846.jpg]\r\n\r\nMatt

  body: "Thanks fvilanakis. I reviewed Lucida Sans Bold as well, and noticed the same
    inconsistencies. Stroke weights are off for the lowercase v (right side is thinner
    than specimen), but that might be one cut vs. another. I suspect (and as you mentioned
    re the manually slanting) that the letterforms have been altered.\r\n\r\nThanks
    for the assistance."
