  \ I have been playing around with font-embedding on web pages and how they render
  on the variety of browsers and operating systems available.   Two questions have
  been left unanswered in my research, and it was recommended to me by a member of
  your community to pose them here.  Forgive their newbie-ish slant, but I have tried
  to find answers, and can't seem to find them.\r\n\r\n1) I have noticed that some
  fonts (like Microsoft's Consolas) look *horrible* on a computer screen without any
  anti-aliasing technologies turned on.  Is there some way to use FontForge to improve
  the hinting on these fonts so they look good when not anti-aliased?  Consolas is
  a bad example since it is not a font that has a license to allow editing or remixing,
  but there are other fonts (like Graublau Web) where this happens as well.  How easy
  is it to do this?  \r\n\r\n2) When converting fonts to one format to another using
  FontForge (e.g. .otf to .eot) the converted fonts have subtle (and sometime not
  so subtle) errors in them.  I understand that this has to do with the spline algorithms
  the different formats use.  Are there any tips you can give to somehow minimize
  the errors in conversion?\r\n\r\nI would like to point out I am only looking at
  doing conversions for fonts in which the license allows font-embedding.  \r\n\r\nThanks
  in advance,\r\nZoltan.\r\n\r\n"

  body: "You need to distinguish a couple of things:\r\n1) Allowing font-embedding
    does NOT necessarily imply @font-face linking.\r\n2) Allowing @font-face linking
    does NOT at all imply that conversion is allowed.\r\n3) And the fact that a font
    is for free also does NOT necessarily mean that conversion is allowed.\r\n\r\nThe
    current situation, roughly, is this:\r\nMany foundries do allow font-embedding
    of their TTF/OTF fonts if this involves some level of protection. Usually this
    kind of allowed font-embedding refers to old technology and includes PDF or Flash
    -- but NOT @font-face linking of TTF/OTF fonts. The latter effectively means uploading
    a font and exposing it so it can be easily downloaded and used locally, which
    is the opposite of the required protection.\r\nMost foundries do NOT allow conversion
    of fonts, e.g. into web font formats like EOT or wOFF. (I know that online-converter
    are out there already and that this of course invites to use them. Yet the fact
    that these exist does NOT mean that you are allowed to convert each and every
    font you like.)\r\nMany foundries will, it seems, produce EOT and wOFF versions
    of their fonts themselves. This way they can make sure that the quality is right.
    (It implies removing of unnecessary glyphs to make files smaller, hinting to make
    type look better, etc.)\r\nOthers, like Typotheque, provide a web font service,
    hosting fonts themselves.\r\n\r\nYou mention Graublau Web in connection with editing
    or remixing (reverse engineering, conversion, etc). If you follow the link \"End
    User License Agreement (EULA)\" on <a href=\"http://www.fonts.info/info/press/free-fonts-for-font-face-embedding.htm\"
    target=\"_blank\">this page</a> which refers to <a href=\"http://www.fonts.info/shop/pub/W-EULA.pdf\"
    target=\"_blank\">this PDF</a>, you will see that although Graublau can be downloaded
    for free, you are NOT allowed to convert it.\r\n\r\nIf in doubt, check a font's
    EULA (usually a link is exposed next to the download button or during the purchase
    process) or ask the foundry of a typeface you like to use. Perhaps they can tell
    you if and when they will offer web font versions of their typefaces.\r\n\r\nBest
    wishes, Karsten"

  body: "Zoltan, \r\n\r\nthere are certainly some fonts that are available under liberal
    licenses that do allow conversion and unlimited use as @font-face web fonts. For
    example, there is a number of fonts that are available under the GNU Public License,
    the SIL Open Font License, the RedHat GPL+exception license, the DejaVu license
    or the GUST Font License: \r\nhttp://delicious.com/adamtwar/gratis+liberal+web+font\r\n\r\nFor
    those fonts, you need to pay some attention regarding the trademarks (if you modify
    the fonts, you need to change the font names) and the availability of the source
    code (though it is not necessarily clear what can be considered source code for
    fonts \u2014 some claim that the OpenType format *is* the source because there
    is no single \"source code language\" for OpenType fonts). \r\n\r\nAs far as the
    screen quality is concerned, careful treatment of hinting is the essential element.
    I don't know much about FontForge's abilities to deal with hinting in a flexible
    way, though. \r\n\r\nCheers,\r\nAdam"

    confuses the design world, and delights the legal world. \r\n\r\nIf the W3C accepts
    a format that requires we mark out fonts as \"embeddable\" in order to be linkable,
    we will be on them like a virus that loves stupidity. \r\n\r\nCheers!"

  body: "EOT has already been rejected.\r\n\r\nA spec for CWT (EOT-Lite) is apparently
    being drafted for consideration, and there is the opportunity to clarify that
    embedding bits do not imply permission for web use or format conversion. Embedding
    bit fields will likely remain in the CWT header, because otherwise the format
    won't be recognisable as an EOT-compatible format in older IE browsers, but these
    will be considered padding by CWT implementations and simply ignored, just as
    embedding bits in TTFs and OTFs are ignored by Firefox and Opera."
