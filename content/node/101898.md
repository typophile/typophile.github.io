body: "<strong>Hi Typophiles!</strong>\r\n\r\nI'm designing a typeface in Latin Ext
  A, and I was wondering if there's any Unicode for the following characters:\r\n\r\n(longs+acute)
  /longsacute \r\n(longs+caron) /longscaron\r\n(longs+cedilla) /longscedilla\r\n(longs+circumflex)
  /longscircumflex\r\n(longs+commaaccent) /longscommaaccent\r\n(longs_i) /longs_i\r\n(longs_l)
  /longs_l\r\n\r\nI know that Long S is part of LatnExtA, that's why I want to also
  design the diacritics for \"s\" when it's long s.\r\nIs this useful? I's it still
  only a Hist form or does some CE language use it?\r\n\r\nThank you!"

  body: "I don't find them in Unicode 6.2. I have never seen them or had a request
    for them. The fact that they are not needed probably has to do with the rules
    pertaining to Long S usage, but that's just a guess.\r\n\r\nThat doesn't prevent
    you from including them in your fonts if you want to do so."

  body: "No, they're not in Unicode as precomposed characters. There are a couple
    of ways you could handle this.\r\n\r\n1. If you are relying on the long-s character
    to differentiate this form from the regular lowercase s, than these diacritics
    would be best encoded using the long-s character followed by an appropriate combining
    mark character from the 0300 range. These combinations could then be mapped to
    precomposed glyphs in the font using the {ccmp} layout feature; alternatively,
    you could rely on GPOS mark positioning.\r\n\r\n2. You could instead handle the
    long-s as a glyph variant of the regular s, invoked by e.g. the {hist} feature
    or a stylistic set feature. In this case, you would handle precomposed long-s
    diacritics in the same way.\r\n\r\nNote that a single font could support both
    approaches.\r\n\r\n[George mentioned rules for long-s use. It's tempting to try
    to use contextual lookups in the {hist} feature to apply these rules, but be aware
    that the rules are not uniform across languages or, even, time periods.]"

  body: "Also, your first five glyph names are not AGL (or AGLFN) compliant. Better
    glyph naming would depend on which method you wish to use to access the glyph:\r\n\r\ne.g.
    /scaron.long vs /longs_uni030C\r\n"

  body: "I have \u017Feen long s with dot above u\u017Fed at \u017Fome point, but
    I don\u2019t remember where. That\u2019s the only diacritic I recall having ever
    \u017Feen used \u017Fpecifically with long s.\r\n\r\nIf you\u2019re \u017Feriou\u017Fly
    thinking about long s then you should read up on its u\u017Fage patterns \u017Fo
    that you under\u017Ftand how it was u\u017Fed and in what contexts. Andrew We\u017Ft\u2019s
    BabelStone blog has two po\u017Fts on it: [[http://babelstone.blogspot.ca/2006/06/rules-for-long-s.html|The
    Rules for Long S]], and [[http://babelstone.blogspot.ca/2006/07/long-and-short-of-letter-s.html|The
    Long and the Short of the Letter S]]. Note that the di\u017Ftribution of long
    s changes over time, and al\u017Fo that it\u2019s different between languages
    in the same time periods.\r\n\r\nI presume by longs_i and longs_l you are referring
    to ligatures with tho\u017Fe lowercase letters? Then you should al\u017Fo con\u017Fider
    doing a ligature with /t/ depending on the \u017Ftyle, and po\u017Fsibly also
    with /b/, /k/, and /h/ depending on how \u2018French\u2019 you expect u\u017Fers
    to be \u017Fetting their texts. A ligature with another long s is probably a good
    idea too, unle\u017Fs you are u\u017Fing a more \u2018buttonhook\u2019 \u017Ftyle
    like in Linotype typefaces."

  body: "The italic /\u017F_t ligature is really weird the way the ascender of the
    t is elongated.\r\nI mean, there is no functional reason for this ligature (i.e.
    to avoid a collision).\r\nIMO it\u2019s made to echo the quaint /s_t roman ligature."
