<div class="post-content e-content" itemprop=articleBody>I've got the impression there are hardly any women using typohile. This impresssion is only based on the nicknames and on the few profiles I've looked at.
– Is the gender ratio on this website the same as in the "real life" world of typography?
– If women are underrepresented, why?
– If women are underrepresented, what can be done to adjust the ratio? How would the typographic community benefit from this?
I think more female discussion participants would help calm down the competitiveness sometimes emerging in the forums. </div>
<div class="comment card m-3">
<div class=card-body>
<div class=commentbody>There are certainly more male graphic designers, but the most dramatic gap is between the numbers of men and women in <em>type design</em>. There are probably fewer than fifty women who have created commercial fonts. Women are not scarce in calligraphy and lettering classes, and the number in type design programs at Reading and KABK are all far greater than those who become font makers. No one has adequately explained to me why this is. </div>

I absolutely agree, when I did my degree in design, the ratio of women to men was around 3:1! I think things has definitely changed in the past decade or two as with everything else.

<div class=card-body>
<div class=commentbody>I studied graphic design in both the US and in Germany. In both countries, the male:female student ratio was 1:3. This was very recent, though.
Frightening was the teaching staff ratio. In the states, there were female professors, but not as many as there were men. Where I was was studying in Germany, there were no female professors in the design department at all, despite the department having recently hired several new professors, and the student body ratio. (I think that this might have improved though in the year that I've been out…).
I can't speak to the working environments back home in the States anymore. In Germany at the moment, lots of designers are graduationg and not getting jobs for a long time. Many of these graduates start working freelance, or try to found their own studios (out of desperation?). Since there are more female and male gradutes, it seems like there are more women not entering the workforce… but demographics play some role here. The average German design graduate is not 21 but about 28–32, I'd say. Some women opt straight for motherhood once their studies are complete. <em>Some</em> of these women who become mothers will, if the impression from the past decade is to be believed, never enter the design workforce at all, other than in a part-time/freelance capacity.
Still, since there are so many new female designers in comparison with males, there should still be more women getting new jobs than men, even if you factor in possible career and life choices.</div>

<div class=commentbody>There are women here using Typophile <waving hand>, but I know that I use Typophile for information - what's new that I may want to check out, where people see trends, what typeface pairings people like since I am not an expert at these things.
Lately, there have been a couple of posts that have rather discouraged me from posting lest I end up in an argument I had not intended - not posts that says women aren't welcome or anything, but posts that are openly derisive of people and their situations, questions, issues. (George is so right on this one.)</div>

My intention is not to protect anyone, Lady or Gentleman, from harsh discussions. I have worked in both all-men and all-women environments, and I must say, neither is an advantage. Reading some of the forums/threads on Typophile, I recognise the "male" patterns. These discussions evolve in a direction of who's right and who's wrong, and that's not very interesting, if you ask me.
Saying this, I find most discussions here very interesting. And I can not point to specific threads, this is just a general notion. </div>

So women prefer being covertly derisive? :-)
--
In my type design class, 5 out of 7 students are women. And I actually think that's typical of graphic design as a whole these days. On the other hand, while the women seem to go on to become professional graphic designers, they don't do the same with type design. My explanation is that women have more sense.

<div class=commentbody>Yes, type design is such a lucrative profession--it even pays less than being a school teacher. :-)
I do think most young people going into design these days are women. Perhaps the next generation will bring more women to type design.

<div class=card-body>
<div class=commentbody>Maybe it has something to do with the perceived technical nature of type design? I double-majored as an undergraduate, getting degrees in both English Lit and Physics simultaneously (though I work as a designer these days). My English classes were 70% female, while my Physics classes were 70% male (at a university that was circa 60% female overall). I had a chance to observe the stereotypes that members of each discipline held for the other. Male physicists often characterized literary criticism as a wishy-washy field, lacking any real rigor or organization. But the lit girls thought physics was all about crunching numbers and complicated math, stuff that was basically meaningless to their lives. They assumed physics was inaccessible, even though they'd never really been exposed to it. When a field seems innately technical, it generally appeals better to men; when it seems organic or humanistic, it generally attracts more women. At least, that's what I've observed.

Nick, it's not you, it's me: when I see somebody
say something too wrong, I have to counter it.
Well, maybe it's partly you as well, since you
exhibit the lion's share of what [I think] is wrong.
Now, if you need to keep pushing this thead in the
direction of macho-wars (which I assure you is mostly
one-sided) and reply to this (probably with something
passive-aggressively caustic) go ahead, and I'll gladly
let you have the last word (as I've been doing often).
Or maybe you'll allow yourself to look better by not
doing so. Your own behaviour is really only up to you.

I'm not complaining that there aren't any woman around, I know there are. I was just wondering if they are underrepresented in this forum. If so, it could mean that a disproportionate amount of female graphic/type designers are excluded from the networking going on this website.</div>

Well, considering the crushing majority of them avoid type design
like the plague, that might in fact be an accurate description. ;-)

Except I generally have no problem with women on these boards.
My main problem has always been with a very narrow demographic:
the middle-aged Anglo male. Think objectively why that's the case.
BTW, feel free to deliver warnings about the Dark Side, but I in
turn feel no need to counter that, since I'm confident that nobody
never ever wants to go the Whiny Side. BTW, women <cite>hate</cite> that.

<div class=commentbody>such a fascinating thread....I go to undergrad design school and this is a constant topic of discussion as the ration of women to men is often 15-17:1 as a single class may often have just one male in it, some none at all. In any case, that seems to be the general rule about design schools as of late.
I don't really know what that means—perhaps the scales will swing drastically within the next decade—perhaps not. At the same time, what does it matter?
I find that gender is much more of a broad gradient than it is a black and white definition. Anyway, it's all about categorization of body shapes and generalizations that don't really have anything to do with those letters that we fiddle with all day....right

And why are YOU (hrant)talking on women's behalf? I might need Nick as a spokesman, not because I need a man (or anyone)to defend me but because he seems to be waaaaaaaaaaaaaaayyyyy more diplomatic than you with your "divine interventions" and unrequested "pearls of wisdom".

In fact I apologize about 50 times more than Nick (and I don't make nearly as many as 50 times more mistakes). You've only been here 6 weeks, and you think you've figured everything out about everybody, eh? It's OK, I will tolerate your naive arrogance.

He is. He's from your island. Both geographically and psychologically.
Typophile is not the UN - it is a place to learn,
and that's best done with tolerance (but not the
kind you stomp your feet about) and a spine.

I was waiting for you to throw on my face the number of weeks I've been around...actually it took you a long time! Given how territorial you are, it was all very predictable. Which is why it took me only few weeks to figure out about you. You are such a darling simple transparent person that I almost feel like hug you. BTW...I am not originally from the "island" (but I luv it!) and we don't need to be the UN but it would be nice to consider that people here come from all sort of countries, minority groups, races, gender, sexuality etc. and a bit of love and affection and good manners would be nice. It would improve a lot the learning environment ;)
Shall we now move on and talk about the issues that really matter, namely "equality at Typophile" if I well remember...or you might as well be "hranting" alone.
peace out homeboy, we are all in the same boat (looking like the Titanic at least in this forum...)

If she said that probably she knew (2 decades in the profession)what a male world is Graphic Design. She said that. Not me.

<div class=commentbody>While I think that everything matters (especially age, although not absolutely). It's not a matter of ignoring aspects of reality, it's a matter of treating people (including third parties who will be affected by a particular hiring decision for example) fairly. That said, it's understandable to try to bypass unfair imbalances in the system - as long as we admit it, and not hide behind a veil of relativism.

<div class=commentbody>Yo babe! Glad you're back in shape.
I don't agree with the age thing. Age in graphic design means experience and good solid education. I see lots of kids with talent nowadays that are just worried about what's trendy now and are just producing ephemerous work (oh jeeesss...where are you george? I don't know how to spell ephemerous in English...) stuff you look at and forget about it after 5 secs. I don't believe it's absolutely necessary to know how to use the latest technology if you are creative enough. I mean, obviously if you can't cope with the technology developments, you are missing a lot of things...type design for example? </div>

I assimilate you.

?
Make up your mind!
BTW, it's funny you thought I meant that young = good.
In fact I meant no such thing - if anything I meant the
opposite. Think about why that happened; such intro-
spection is a key to growth.

Wow... thanks for the off-handed compliment.
But age can produce wine, vinegar and very stinky cheese!
As for women in type design, the ones you learn about are the ones that outclassed many of the males. The same holds true for art. Very few males are still willing to admit that Mary Cassatt was a "better" painter than most of the Impressionists, and that Georgia O'Keefe was in a class by herself.

Back in the '50s the only (times have changed) Mexican girl in our So. Cal. school was Nadine. If she drank out of a certain faucet, no one else could use that faucet for the rest of the day, or they got the cooties too. This type of behavior went on for the entire year. I wish I could see that she wasn't emotionally scarred for life.</div>

The ethnic reference in your anecdote is in poor taste and is not needed to tell the story. You might want to remove it and avoid offending people.

Please tell me you are kidding? That is what puts it in context. Simply for being Mexican we emotionally tortured a girl. I only spoke out about it because I had just been wondering about her Sat. But I feel bad about it. I am married to a Mexican citizen.
I won't jump to conclusions about you, but a big problem in today's society is how quickly so many people get offended. Unless someone is urinating on some Christian icon, of course. Then it is free speech.
I bare my soul, and someone nit-picks. This week isn't starting out good. I'll hope things get better at the office.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Ephemeral! Of course...how embarrassing, I'm mixing the languages you see (or it's the age) thanx! Now I'd love to know what a cootie is...
I realised my comment about age equal experience/solid education wasn't very fortunate the moment I wrote it..I knew nobody would let me get away with it! Anyway, I was trying to avoid this thread too because it's all very vague (starting from me...). It would be best to gather statistics and figures and then try to come to some conclusion. Maybe Typophile can provide that? </div>

<div class=commentbody>A "Cootie" is something invented by young children in elementary schools years ago. It is some sort of an evil ficticious bug creature that can infest you. Children can be cruel so at times, they would hurl the biggest insult that they could muster at someone they disliked or were jealous of. That remark was "You have Cooties"!. At which point a chorus of "Ehhuuuuuu!!!" would chime in by the rest of the 3rd graders in earshot.
Since at that age boys and girls are "enemies" (until puberty strikes), the Cooties insult was often blasted at members of the opposite sex.

Indiscrimitely applied by third-graders. As an aside, (I hope no one is offended), about that age, I once called a white boy the "n" word. I didn't know what it was, but I knew it was "bad". I sure the meeting we had with the boy's parents that night would be comical if it could have been video-taped.</div>

<em>1949 THE GAME OF COOTIE Schaper</em>
Yes, "<em>So-and-so has Cooties!</em>" was one of the earliest insults you could fling recalling early school years from the fifties.
I also remember the board game, shown above dated 1949, so it must have been used as an expression many years before that.
