  like &#189; on there own are working as expected in Indeisgn\r\n\r\nIf I try 1&#189;
  I get 11 as the top of the fraction and 2 as the bottom of the fraction.\r\n\r\nI
  know the code is meant to work like this but how would I get 1&#189;\r\n\r\nShould
  a number followed by a fraction have a space between the number and the following
  fraction.\r\n\r\n\r\nttmt"

  body: I reckon you could hack it to accept other spaces and nonjoiners and replace
    them with your own choice of space or nonjoiner.

    the \"\xBD\" makes it into \"11/2\", I think is what you meant. Which of course
    would cause \"one-and-one-half\" to be incorrectly read as \"eleven-halves.\"
    But in plain text, you'd almost always have a space (or something) between the
    \"1\" and the \"1/2\" for precisely that reason. Tal noted the pros and cons in
    his [[http://talleming.com/2008/04/16/fraction-fever/|original post of the code]],
    and the \"space\" compromise is mentioned in both categories."

    get them to work in the Fraction feature in both InD and Quark, so just implemented
    the basic fractions as pre-composed.\r\n\r\nHowever, I have since thought of a
    better way to do nut fractions in the feature\u2014but haven\u2019t had cause
    to  implement it, as all my subsequent faces have had \u201Cslash\u201D fractions,
    not nut."
