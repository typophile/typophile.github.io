    for is <a href=\"http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/adobe/vag-rounded/\">VAG Rounded</a>.
    As far as I know, that's still the typeface on all of the unibody \"chicklet\"
    keyboards too. I think they started using it some time after Steve Job returned
    to Apple -- before that their keyboards were set in Univers."

    has remained the same.\r\nhttp://images.apple.com/macbookpro/images/overview-gallery2-20090828.png\r\n\r\nI'm
    probably thinking about the Titanium Powerbook G4 models' black keys, which do
    seem like Univers.\r\n\r\nhttp://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Apple_PowerBook_G4_Titanium_close-up_hinge-2006-07-24.jpg\r\nhttp://www.sfmoma.org/images/artwork/large/2001.397.jpg\r\n\r\nThanks
    for the type ID!"
