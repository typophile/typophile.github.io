  body: "Not too amazing--my first guess was wrong, but tantalizingly close. I've
    been a fan of Mackintosh's architecture since college, so I recognized the style.\r\n\r\nSo,
    I went to identifont.com (a great resource) and looked up fonts similar to Rennie
    Mackintosh. Chelsea Studio was on the list.\r\n\r\nPrivate liberal arts colleges
    have fallen out of favor these days, but I'm very glad to have attended one--the
    experience taught me how to do research."
