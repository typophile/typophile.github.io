  body: "More than modern, I'd say futuristic! ;-)\r\nThe second one is too abstract.
    The first one works better, but the \"a\" predominates, which maybe isn't the
    best effect for a wedding...\r\nHave you thoght something constructed like \xE6?"

    more apparent. Other than that, I think you're on the right track with this second

  body: "Love the second set. I think the left one reads better as initials, since
    the letters are upright, but the right hand one makes sense tilted in a heart
    shape. I think it is OK that the initials are more subtle when tilted to make
    a normal heart shape.\r\n\r\nI can totally see this repeated as a faint pattern
    in the wedding stationery, napkins, etc. \r\n\r\nVery appropriate that it makes
    a heart, and the letters are intertwined / woven together. Great concept.\r\n\r\n____________________________\r\nwww.coroflot.com/kate_dawson"
