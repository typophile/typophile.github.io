body: "Hey everybody,\r\n\r\nI noticed that Fontlab doesn't include interpolated sidebearings
  (spacing) or kerning values in instances from a MM file. Does Superpolator do that,
  or is there any other way?\r\n\r\nThanks in advance,\r\nJasper de Waard"

  body: If Fontlab isn't interpolating spacing and kerning values in instances you
    have done something incorrectly. Either that or your masters have matching values.

  body: OK. It does interpolate sidebearing values, but it just deletes all kerning
    pairs from the instance. Any idea what I'm doing wrong?

    values are messy and don't make much sense, but that shouldn't stop Fontlab from
    interpolating kerning values."

  body: I'm not sure why your kerning pair has been removed but I wouldn't trust the
    interpolated kerning too much from a Fontlab MM file. In the past - previous to
    Superpolator - I've found the desired instance via MM and then done a straight
    blend (not MM) to have some better kerning to start with. Superpolator does a
    super job with kern pairs if you're wondering.

  body: "<cite>Superpolator does a super job with kern pairs if you're wondering.</cite>\r\n\r\nI've
    found that Superpolator is that answer to all my Fontlab interpolation problems.
    And I have been told that Glyphs also handles everything quite well.\r\n\r\nAnd
    if you're handy with Python the Robofab site explains how to just interpolate
    directly between two fonts with a script. "

  body: I don't know what you are doing wrong Jasper, but I have never had a problem
    with FontLab interpolating side bearings and kerning data. But then I use that
    really old Mask-to-Master process rather than the Blend Fonts.

  body: "I think of what I do in FL as master to master. I that the mask to master
    process you speak of here? Or is there yet a 3rd way? Blend fonts is definitely
    different.\r\n\r\nI have superpolator now though. I think that will take over.\r\n\r\n-e.\r\n"

  body: I used 'blend fonts'. But I guess I'm just gonna buy superpolator.
