body: "Hi,\r\nI use PageMaker (7.x) several years. Unfortunately PM (at printing)
  can only read the first 256 char from OpenType char table (the Western code page),
  so the Central European chars used by me are missing at printing.\r\nThis is only
  the situation with modern multi-codepage OpenType fonts (like Windows system fonts),
  the old TrueType CE fonts (with only one 256-char code page) works fine.\r\nIs there
  any way (program?) to export only the Central European char set/table from the multi-codepage
  OpenType font file into the old-style single-codepage TrueType font file?\r\nThanks
  for help"
