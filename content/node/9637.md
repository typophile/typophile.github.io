  body: The only real way to measure font legibility is to create some sort of human
    factors cognitive research study.  <BR> <BR>Identify the font you want to test,
    and develop a hypothesis that you will test. <BR> <BR>Create a set of stimuli
    that will be simple enough to clear response from your test population so you
    may test your hypothesis.  <BR> <BR>Assemble a test population and give them a
    pre-test that is designed to leave you with a fairly uniform population so any
    results can be attributed to that population, this will help future researchers
    working on similar material.   <BR> <BR>Administer the test and and do a statistical
    analysis of the results. <BR> <BR>Rinse and repeat.

  body: I think it&#39;s certainly <i>possible</i> to do sensical testing, but it&#39;s
    also extrememly difficult to do it <i>right</i>, at least in the realm of immersive
    reading &#40;as opposed to just individual letters/words&#41;. And the main thing
    is that, in the absense of reliable empiricism, a typographer still has to make
    design decisions, he can&#39;t put his head in the sand. This is where plausible
    theorizing can be more useful than to &#34;measure font legibility&#34;. That&#39;s
    what I&#39;ve been trying to do in various ways myself, and my article in TYPO
    is a representative culmination of it all. <BR> <BR>hhp

  body: 'I think the style of the typeface is fine and an interesting contribution
    to the argument of your article. The obvious conscious design decisions about
    letterform are generally reasonable, but the execution seems uneven, and some
    letters create a sense of arbitrariness, e.g. the splayed and imbalanced lowercase
    w, and I find it hard to consider that you might have intended them that way,
    since they don&#39;t seem to contribute to the readability of the face. The lowercase
    s seems too light. The open lower bowl of the g is fine, but the upper right transition
    of the same bowl is both heavy and awkward and is contrary to the &#39;movement&#39;
    of the other letters. I don&#39;t think you gain anything from the lower right
    termination of the d that you would not gain from modelling it on the same area
    of the a. I think the top bowl of the e is a bit too large: I understand your
    desire to make it taller than &#39;normal&#39;, but I think you&#39;ve overdone
    it a bit: the bar is optically pressing down into the lower part of the letter,
    an effect strengthened by the straight transition on the right. The giant white
    space in your fi ligature seems to me problematic in terms of &#39;bouma&#39;
    shape; if you want to preserve the dot on the i, why not consider what Jelle Bosma
    did in Cambria and have a contextually substituted narrower f before i? I don&#39;t
    understand why the external serifs on the m are so much shorter than on the n:
    are serifs important to readability or not? Some letters are very nice: I especially
    like the lowercase c.'

    think I&#39;ll &#34;reflow&#34; this tangent to the Patria thread. Again, thanks.

  body: Hrant, I was very pleased to see Patria in print. I noticed it instantly when
    I picked up the print edition, and I must admit that I couldn&#39;t get through
    your article because I kept stopping to look at your letters. <BR> <BR>I don&#39;t
    mean to say that your letters impede legibility; I do not think that they do.
    I just mean that I was so thrilled to see Patria in use that I lost interest in
    the text. This happens to me a lot

  body: Hello, <BR> <BR>For legibility, is anyone have some suggestions or nice research
    papers for character spacing setting?  <BR>I read one paper wrote by mark Jarma
    about the basic character spacing in type design. &#40;Link as follow&#41; <BR>
    <BR><a href="http://www.typeculture.com/academic_resource/articles_essays/pdfs/tc_article_20.pdf"
    target="_blank">http://www.typeculture.com/academic_resource/articles_essays/pdfs/tc_article_20.pdf</a>
    <BR> <BR>So, apart from the basic idea, when typeface desiger design the character
    spacing of fonts, is there any other rules or considerations? <BR> <BR>Or is there
    more suggestions from the psycology field?  <BR> <BR>Thanks for any advice!! <BR>

  body: By the way, In the paper above, the author mentioned that after the basic
    idea of spacing setting, the fine-tuning should be considered. But each font design
    looks like have too much difference in character spacing setting, how comes? <BR>y

  body: '&#62;is there any other rules or considerations? <BR> <BR>Mark Jamra&#39;s
    theory considers white space -- the area between characters. While this is most
    useful, there are other parameters of spacing, such as &#34;near-point distance&#34;.
    <BR> <BR>The extreme instance of near-point spacing is the setting, popular for
    advertising headlines set by phototypositor in the era c. 1965-85, known as &#34;tight
    but not touching&#34;. <BR> <BR>Some typefaces, in particular Goudy&#39;s Old
    Style &#40;1920s&#41;, were designed for a tight fit, in metal setting, in text,
    so they excelled in the TBNT setting. <BR> <BR>The light weights of Helvetica
    Neue &#40;done in the TBNT era&#41; are tightly fitted, with near-point spacing
    having a greater role to play than white-spacing. <BR> <BR>It&#39;s also interesting
    to compare the metrics of the original Univers &#40;not much kerning there&#41;
    with the new version, especially concerning the lower-case &#34;r&#34;.  <BR>
    <BR>Jamra rightly identifies the primary importance of using the judgement of
    one&#39;s eyes to determine &#34;even rhythm&#34;, and, to continue the analogy
    musically, bear in mind that there are many different rhythms, some simple, others
    complex. Sure, you need a basic rhythm for legibility, but beyond that, the question
    is will the type march, skip, dance or drag its feet?'

    is his discussion of spacing. It is based on the most often cited discussion of
    spacing, Walter Tracy&#39;s chapter in his <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/1567922406/qid=1111668277/sr=1-1/ref=sr_1_1/102-7091979-3133744?v=glance&amp;s=books"

    here on Typophile, you will get a many interesting comments, such as Nick&#39;s
