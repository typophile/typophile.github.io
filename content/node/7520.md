  <BR> <BR>My proposed change is: <BR>p { font: 10pt &#39;Lucida Grande&#39;, &#39;Lucida

  body: Despite hearing warnings against deleting Windows&#39; &#34;core&#34; fonts,
    I took a chance and deleted Arial and Times New Roman awhile back. Surprisingly,
    nothing broke. Web pages use the brower&#39;s default serif or sans serif fonts.
    Global UI elements that call for Arial are substituted with the much more eye-friendly
    Lucida Sans Unicode. So, if you&#39;re as sick of looking at Arial as I was, it
    appears that deleting it won&#39;t screw up Windows XP. &#40;No guarantees, try
    at your own risk!&#41;

  body: phpBB or vBulletin would be nice, but the current &#34;upload files to server&#34;
    option that typophile has really makes it an excelent place with no broken images
    links, so normal on the other foruns. I don&#39;t think this option is available
    on those softwares, is it? <BR> <BR>Yes, skip arial <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"

  body: Believe me, we&#39;ve looked into alternate board software. PHPBB is  <BR>enticing
    because it&#39;s free &#40;opensource&#41; and because PHP is so  <BR>powerful
    &#40;customizable&#41;. However, one of our main problems  <BR>with considering
    a move to another board is that we&#39;re sitting on  <BR>3.5 years of archived
    &#40;searchable&#41; content. <BR> <BR>So, any discussion about moving &#40;upgrading&#41;
    to new forum  <BR>software has to include strategies about porting or archiving  <BR>the
    existing content. PHPBB looks most promising - again  <BR>because it&#39;s customizable.
    And of course, the ability to post  <BR>images is a must that we have to build
    in. <BR> <BR>The CSS is another matter entirely... The current Discus software  <BR>and
    CSS go together like hammers and screws. Discus is built <BR>with proprietary
    tags that make any CSS usage like covering a  <BR>bad hair day with a band-aid.
    Suffice it to say, with an updated  <BR>board will come a revamped CSS. <BR> <BR>And,
    yeah, Lucida Sans is really nice and Trebuchet is nice in  <BR>small doses. Have
    you Mac OS users noticed that you can  <BR>spec Hoefler Text and Myriad with your
    HTML &#40;for Mac users of  <BR>course&#41;?

  body: Start a new phpBB forum from scratch, and then keep this one around, locked
    to new posts of course, for the archive. <BR> <BR>Even if you have to get rid
    of all the posts, phpBB is worth it...vBulletin is even better if you don&#39;t
    mind paying for a licence.

    on how Dicuss stores it&#39;s messages it could be as simple as a well planned
    and tested SQL query to dump everything into the new format.

  body: Instead of porting everyone&#39;s account info over to a new system &#40;I&#39;m
    going to get flogged for this&#41; just make everyone sign up again.  It&#39;s
    a good way to set everyone off on equal footing with a fresh start on a fresh
    board, and it purges the database of all those people who signed up and never
    posted
