<div class="post-content e-content" itemprop=articleBody>This is a personal brand for a design company I've started with my brother. We're pretty set on the mark, but the type needs work.
We don't really have a big budget at this point, so something in the $0 to $40 range would be nice, but not required.
The .pdf contains both horizontal and vertical versions. We'll probably be using the vertical version more often, but the horizontal at small sizes.
This is the horizontal version:

<div class=commentbody>Thinking out loud: would an abbreviated "Apt." be possible? If not, you've a long one there {if you know what I mean ;)} I'm immediately thinking of using a complimentary tall 'face such as Linotype Univers. It's out of your budget, but perhaps someone could set it for you for a reasonable fee? Then again, this might be a great opportunity, considering your budget, for a custom-designed type job! Might be a great exercise, matching a custom face to your icon. Moreover, what could you do to mesh the two (icon and typeface)? Something to consider.

I was thinking of doing a custom typeface - maybe i'll just have to bite the bullet and do that.

P.S. I've got the Bitstream version of Univers (Zurich) which is what this is set in. I could go with a condensed weight to see how that looks.</div>

<div class=commentbody>I like the Univers but I am having trouble with your alignment it seems just too high on the horizontal version, I would also slightly increase the size of the numerals to cap height. The vertical version seems like the mark is crushing the type could you get away with just the numerals or maybe make the type two lines and increase both?
I'm sure that somebody is going to ask why the "light" is on the ground floor, some people can be so literal :)

<div class=commentbody>I assumed there was a concept behind that light on the ground floor...guessing it was in relation to you guys...'getting in on the ground floor' or something. What's the scoop?
And agreed about the alignment. Doesn't look intentional. Either align along the bottom or jack it up enough to look intentional and more asymmetrically balanced.

<div class=commentbody>hello,
like Dylan, I am also intrigued with teh light, as dylan asks, does it have something to do with the placement of your office, if not, and it does not reflect such things as starting from the bottom etc, then maybe the light could be at the very top floor, the penthouse if you like, always associated with quality and all that jazz.
Just a thought,

<div class=commentbody>I've added a new pdf with a few changes. The first is just the vertical logo with 32 under it. I'm not sure if this would say "Apartment 32" to someone unfamiliar with our business.
The second is the horizontal with the type brought closer to the mark and raised so the baseline is aligned with the top of the window instead of the bottom.
The third is the same as the second, with the baseline aligned to the bottom of the mark.
And as for the light, you'll notice that there are 32 windows in the building. The last one - apartment 32 - has a light on.

<div class=commentbody>yeah, I definitely love the mark.
I immediately realized that it was apt 32.. but the idea of the placement of your studio would have been a nice branding element as well...
props on the mark, you have my vote.

Also, I think that apartment spelled out is fine. I think the placement, and the size of the lettering is fine as well on the image you had originally posted...

<div class=commentbody>What about Atrament? It's a relatively new typeface with a bit of character, and it's condensed. Price is reasonable (well, it was to me) at $165 for a decent set of weights. I set your name in the attached JPEG quickly to give you an idea of what it might look like.
The font is available at MyFonts.com if you're interested.

The way I read this image, apartment 32 would be the 4th square on the "top floor" (topmost row). I see a light on in apartment 4. I also think that metaphorically positioning yourself at the top is probably a better idea.</div>

Erik has a good point though.

Well, we don't read buildings the same way we read roman script. The convention is that apartment number 1 will be on the first floor, and 10 on the tenth floor (if there's only one unit per floor). Anyway, this is not the biggest issue in my opinion. If after considering the options you decide that being on the ground floor, metaphorically speaking, is a good thing, that's what matters most.</div>

<div class=commentbody>When I first saw it I was confused because I thought the light was on in apt. 4 as well (apt. 32 being the top rightmost room), So i changed the logo to put the light where apt. 32 seemed like it should be, and it didnt seem to do good things graphically. I'd suggest you keep the light on the bottom. It seems like metaphorically it works either way, and your office is on the bottom. Plus, having the light on the bottom makes it easy to notice (2nd window, 3rd floor is really confusing to look for), and grounds the whole logo. If you put it in the far upper right it makes the building look like its going to tip over. (to me at least).</div>

<div class=commentbody>hey lex..
generally you've got a nice mark there but i agree that the font shouldn't be the ultimate solution.
I also agree that logically apartment 32 should be rather on the top floor than on the ground floor but i understand your justification due to the general reading habit..
have you considered making the other windows rather grey than white? it would symbolise that everbody's already gone home but apartment 32 is still working?
just my 2 cents

<div class=commentbody>Maybe flip the word Apartment to vertical reading down with the 32 beneath it.
Another way is to just let your graphic imply the word apartment and just put the number 32 below the graphic without typesetting "apartment" at all?

<div class=commentbody>hello. I am a new-comer here, but i stumbled upon this and thought you could use input. The simplicity is good. I also agree with the aforementioned crits about putting the light at the top of the building.
if you did something like that your eye starts at the top anyways and travels natually downward, which would probably allow for an easier read. I agree with the person right above me to a degree only that Apartment 32 should contain a little touch of color as to relate back to the "light" in the window.</div>

Yes, but apartment 32 would be on the ground floor. Apartment 532 would be on the 5th floor....at least that's what I've always noticed, and I've lived in a lot of big, ugly apartment buildings.
