  \r\n\r\nI am back\u2014full time too.\r\n\r\nPlease list all the foundries in the
  world that give discounts to students, so I and my fellow students can get our font-shopping-on.\r\n\r\nMike
  Diaz :-)\r\n\r\nPS... I have to replace my PowerPC G5 tower that I love so much
  too. I wish Apple had put an i3 core chip in the new Mac Mini so I can the get latest
  and greatest architecture from Intel, but oh well. When I buy Adobe\u2019s Master
  Collection, I\u2019ll get the Mini and replace the paltry drive included with the
  Mac with a 1TB drive (7200 2.5 SATA inch drive if that conditions even exists.)"

  body: "Linotype.com offers a 30% discount on all font products. I am pretty sure
    that this applies to all the third-party fonts that we sell in our webshop, too
    (Typejockeys, TypeTogether, ParaType, etc.). But you should check it out yourself
    (I am not a student anymore!).\r\n\r\nYour account at Linotype.com has to be \"studentified\"
    for this to work. Just email Linotype a copy of your student ID (you could also
    fax it), and your account will be \"upgraded\" so to speak, so that this discount
    is taken off of purchases in your shopping cart."
