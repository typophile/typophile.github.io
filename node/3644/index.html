		<div class="commentbody">Very nice start. Reminds me a lot of Bernhardt (Agfa) or Bernhard (Font Company). I think overall your spacing is a little tight. (Although you probably aren't addressing spacing just yet.)  I agree with the remarks made by Jens overall. It looks as if you are designing a monolinear design, but I think the main vertical strokes on all the characters (which have them) would benefit from a little modulation. I'm interested to see your version of UC for this style of face. Post soon?</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Jens&hellip; having not benefited from an eductaion in typography of any kind, your remarks at first were slightly confusing.

You are right. <BR> <BR>&gt;BTW: the angel of the 't' down-stroke <BR> <BR>Am I right in thinking you meant to say &quot;angle&quot;? <BR> <BR>anyway, will fix the 'm' and 'n'. I can see what you mean about the 'd' in the gif, but in fontographer it seems OK. strange. <BR> <BR>anyway, here is the font so far.. <BR><IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/2879.gif" ALT="blit"> <BR> <BR>m still needs work, as does s</div>
