  will be printed in smaller sections. I\u2019ll be working with the printer from
  the start to avoid borking the project, but I want some advice from anyone else
  who has done this.  I know that I can\u2019t do something like this without specialized
  software, so would it make sense to develop the sections as individual Illustrator
  or Indesign files and create a large Indesign document (to scale, anyway) for the
  entire wall and place the files into that to put the whole thing together for comps?
  Or should I just do one scale piece and then break it up when I print? Also, are
  there any good books on graphics at this sort of scale?"

  body: 'I''ve done billboards in Illustrator and Photoshop before. We''re talking
    the large 14''x48'' bad boys. (Sorry couldn''t resist.) I usually work at 10%
    of final size. The final output for the dealers I print through for this dimension
    is 10 dpi. For highway driving that is plenty of dpi. So I usually work at 100
    dpi or more if I have it. Working at a final percentage is never a  problem or
    shouldn''t be. What matters is the math. '

  body: 'I''ve done some large exhibition design/graphics (30x14). I started with
    the architectural drawings and got some proportions from the building''s design,
    and then set up the Indy doc grid to match the surface areas at scale. I made
    all my output files 100% because I didn''t know/trust the person doing the output.
    Turns out my biggest problem was with the installation/building crew that was
    less than precise with their sheet-rock work. Elevations drawings were at 1/2"
    = 1'', and also 1" = 1''. '

    out from them exactly what they need to do this.\r\n\r\nIf you are going to work
    full scale then Photoshop is the only option (yes, it's possible). You can also
    work to scale - 1/12, 1/48 are common. (Beware that 1/48 is called 1/4 scale in
    the signage industry because it is 1/4\" - 1').\r\n\r\nBasically let your printer
    guide you through this - they will tell you what scale and what res at that scale
    they expect.\r\n\r\npbc"

  body: When I did billboards we used to mock them up on little tent cards and have
    the client view them from the other end of a boardroom table. It sounds a bit
    silly (shades of Spinal Tap), but there is actually some correspondence between
    those little tent cards as 3D objects, and the way large signage is observed in
    the environment, perhaps to do with the motility of the viewpoint.

  body: I thought one of the benefits of vector-based artwork was that it was infinitely
    scaleable. Then why the photochop stuff? I guess if you want anything bitmapped,
    but I've seen a super-cool method of taking a pixelized bitmap (at like 30 ppi,
    but just the physical size changed, not the actual resolution) and converting
    THAT into vector art.

  body: "I deal with pop stars so large photos are necessary. You can Live Trace photos
    with amazingly good results but the outlines are far too complex for most RIPs.
    I forget the exact number but there is a limit to how many points can be ripped
    and a limit as to how close they can be (if I remember correctly they cannot be
    closer than 3px).\r\n\r\nMost billboards aren't really that large in PS - 1/2
    a gig or so. All vector is delivered as shape layers.\r\n\r\nI have had many billboard
    vendors ask me for layered .psd files. I don't argue with them I just deliver
    it. Most final output res on billboards is 18-25ppi. A typical size is 48' x 14'.
    So you're talking 576\" x 168\" @ 20ppi or so. 11520px x 3360px if 20ppi is what
    they are looking for, large but not crazy large. Certainly not .psb territory.\r\n\r\nI
    have 18\" x 24\" posters that are much larger than that (16bit RGB layered files)
    before they are converted. \r\n\r\nDo I prefer to work in all vector and in ID
    or Illy? No doubt. It's just not always possible.\r\n\r\nThe real problem is getting
    quality information. I have been quoted some really bad specs over time. I get
    the number of whoever is going to print it, call up and ask a question that the
    receptionist or salesman can't possibly answer. Then I am transferred to a production
    person who actually speaks my language.\r\n\r\npbc"
