body: "Hi all,\r\n\r\nMy name is Charlie, i\u2019m a graphic designer doing a Typography
  Master at Eina (Escola de Disseny i Art) in Barcelona. \r\nNow I\u2019m preparing
  the Master\u2019s thesis and I\u2019m being helped by [[http://www.laurameseguer.com|Laura
  Meseguer]] who is my tutor.\r\nThe work it\u2019s about <strong>\"Commissioned Type\"</strong>and
  I\u2019m doing a big research that i hope will be joined in a book. \r\n\r\nSo,\r\nI\u2019ve
  been reading about Commissioned Type and corporate typefaces and I consider Roman
  du Roi as the first commisioned Type of history (Do you know any other before?).
  I have a list of interesting cases but I also would love to know which cases you
  consider as the most famous in the history of this subject.\r\n\r\nBut the thing
  i am really concerned about it\xB4s to find why commissioned fonts are usefull (or
  not). \r\nIs it only because of the worth of the licenses or legal problems? Or
  you consider that there is really much better to have a commissioned type (for a
  corporation or a magazine) for a \"better and customized\" communication?\r\n\r\nI\u2019ve
  made a really small questionary for send to type designers and I\u2019ll post it
  here. If someone have a free time for answer, it would be very helpfull for me:\r\n\r\n1)
  When do you think it\xB4s necessary a commissioned type?\r\n2)Do you think it contributes
  to the identity of a corporate or magazine?\r\n3) Which is your opinion about that
  designing a commissioned type it\xB4s only a comercial trick to sell sofisticated
  \"design packages\" to the clients, and that sometimes it\xB4s better to use a good
  existing type than creating a new one?\r\n4)Do you think people detects the little
  changes (if it\xB4s a modification of an existing type) made on customized typography?\r\n5)Talking
  about communication, which are for you the top five commissioneds types of the all
  history which really solved a problem?\r\n6)Could you list four advantages and four
  desadvantages of this.\r\n7)If you had to put in a few words the true reason why
  it\xB4s better or not to apply and create commissioned type, what would you say?\r\n\r\nWell,
  I\xB4ll continue working on that!\r\n<strong>Hope to hear your opinions, suggestions,
  thoughts!</strong>\r\n\r\n\u2014\r\nCharlie."

  body: "Hola Charlie.\r\nThe term 'custom type' is used in english, primarily, to
    identify type, such as in a wordmark, that does not belong to any established
    typeface.\r\nExample:[img:sites/default/files/old-images/nytlogo379x64_6710.gif]\r\n\r\nWhat
    you're discussing sounds more like what is called in english <em>commissioned
    type</em> for exclusive use."

  body: "I can't answer the whole thing right now, but will add something.\r\n\r\nAside
    from the specifics of type, any kind of custom element distinguishes a company
    or publication even if it's on the subtle side. This can include a logo, trademark,
    a music jingle, lettering, type and so on. \r\n\r\nAn example of not so subtle
    would be the Coca Cola logo. It is so ingrained into culture that just small elements
    of that design are recognizable to non-designers. An example of subtle is the
    background music of McDonald's TV ads. Little hints of rhythm and melody allude
    to it and then you already can hear it about to resolve into their trademark jingle.
    The subtle look of a typeface that may not jump out at you right off becomes familiar
    after a while thus reinforcing the brand."

  body: "Hello David,\r\nYes, you are totally right. I\xB4m talking about comissioned
    type! My mistake. I\xB4ll correct it.\r\n\r\nStephen,\r\nIt\xB4s true that the
    Coca Cola logo it\xB4s recognized by people who have no relation with design,
    but it would be useless to make an alphabet  from that lettering. At least as
    a corporate typeface. What do you think. Hope to know your answers!\r\n\r\n\r\nI
    corrected the post from \"Custom type\" to \"Comissioned type\". Thank you David!"

  body: A commissioned typeface can certainly help support a brand identity, but a
    big reason that typefaces are commissioned nowadays is to save money. A site license
    of an off-the-shelf typeface for a large company can be quite expensive, and can
    have legal ramifications if it is improperly done. Commissioning a typeface can
    cost less in many cases and take care of the potential legal issues.

  body: Types have been commissioned nearly as long as printing has existed. The first
    punchcutters were artisans who cut punches for stamping letters and images into
    coins, jewelry, and other stuff, and printers started commissioning them early
    on. The earliest example I can think of is Aldus Manutius commissioning Griffo
    to cut type for him, but it seems likely that printers in Mainz were doing the
    same thing before it was sacked and everybody left town.

  body: "Hello James,\r\n\r\nI had the same thought as you. We could say that the
    letters commissioned by Manutius to Griffo could be the first example, but i continued
    thinking and I realised a commission like that was more a request as a craftsman
    than as a designer of letters. Those designs were already made (or like history
    says: copied from Petrarca by Manutius) and Griffo cut them.\r\nSo, it\xB4s interesting
    you point but, i think Roman du Roi continues in the first place.\r\nWhat do you
    think?\r\n\r\nAnd i would like to add something quick because my quiz had not
    succeed!\r\n<strong>Could somebody list five of the most important commissioned
    types in history?</strong>\r\n\r\nMy list:\r\n<strong>1692 </strong>Romain du
    Roi for la Imprimerie Royale\r\n<strong>1905 </strong>Behrens Antiqua for AEG\r\n<strong>1914
    </strong>Johnstons for London Underground\r\n<strong>1938 </strong>Bell Gothic
    for AT&T\r\n<strong>1968 </strong>Frutiger for Charles de Gaulle\r\n<strong>1986
    </strong>Meta for Deutsche Bundespost\r\n<strong>1996 </strong>Georgia and Verdana
    for Microsoft\r\n\r\nI know there are a much more examples, but i\u2019m just
    looking for the relevant ones. Could anyone add another?"

  body: "Hello Charlie,\r\nWhat do you think about Herbert Mayer's Bauhaus typeface?
    Maybe it could be included in your thesis. It had done as an experiment to try
    to construct an universal alphabet but nowadays it is considered the official
    (and custom) Bauhaus type.\r\n\r\n"
