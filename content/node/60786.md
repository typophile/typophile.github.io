body: "Hi! \r\nI'm a newbie at identifying typefaces and was wondering if anyone could
  identify any of these fonts on the package. I know the nutritional information face
  is Trade Gothic, the Nestle logotype is a form of Helvetica, but the rest I am not
  sure about.\r\n\r\nI'm particularly looking for the typeface of the Milo logotype
  and the subtitles (\"Made from Malted Barley ...\")\r\n\r\nHope you can help :)\r\n\r\nPS:
