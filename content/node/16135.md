  body: 'I have to apologize, I meant the menu lists after you click on either of
    the 2 links for Spavia or Nema. It''s a flash site so I couldn''t make a direct
    link to what I was talking about (and I clearly didn''t explain that well.) I
    appreciate that speed that you answered in though, it''s impressive and definitely
    IDing fonts/type is a pure art. '

    an example. In that case you would've seen the other weights right away.\r\n\r\nYou

    should ever blame one for. ;^)"
