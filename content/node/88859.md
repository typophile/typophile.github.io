body: "Before I design more than one letter ;-) (using ff) I should also ask here,
  if anyone already had created this font digitally.\r\n\r\nIt's the \"Letra Redonda\"
  proposed by \"Juan Claudio Aznar de Polanco\" in the book \"Arte nueva de escribier\"
  (Madrid 1719), (can be found at books.google version <a href=\"books.google.de/books?id=A5BzFAEBqyIC&pg=RA1-PA128&hl=de&source=gbs_toc_r&cad=4#v=onepage&q&f=false\">one</a>
  / <a href=\"http://books.google.de/books?id=j410msYull0C&pg=RA4-PA128&hl=de&source=gbs_selected_pages&cad=3#v=onepage&q&f=false\">two</a>)\r\n\r\nThe
  scan below shows:\r\n\r\na b c d e f l g h (described as y???)) (i, not described
  in text) m n o p q r s t u (alternative p????) v x y z\r\nA B(+R+P derived from
  it) C D E F G H (I? described as L in text?!) M N O Q (alternative R) (another alternative
  R?!) S T V-Corazon (alternative V) X (alternative L??) (J??? looks more like Z)
  (alternative F?)\r\n\r\nSome letters are missing, some should be modified, that
  readers of today can read them ;-) But it looks as a font that it is worth to digitize,
  if no one else has done it yet ..."
