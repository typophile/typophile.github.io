  Can I provide them the fonts we use for our brand? Should they sign an agreement?
  Is there usage documentation anyone can provide me concerning this?\r\n\r\n\r\nThank
  you!"

  body: "All depends on the arrangement you have with the foundry that supplied the
    branding fonts. \r\n\r\nIf you acquired them under a standard license, then probably
    not, as you'd be limited to a set number of workstations on your company premises,
    and you won\u2019t be allowed to share them with suppliers.  \r\n\r\nCheers, Si
