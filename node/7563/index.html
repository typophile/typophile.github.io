  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">So, there's a videogame called <a href="http://half-life2.com">Half-Life 2</a>. Its interface uses what appears to be <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=catalog.fontdetail&amp;displayfontid=FF.9467.11.1">FF DIN Light</a>. I'm a huge fan of both. <BR> <BR>Well, as most fans of a game or movie are inclined to do, they want to get their hands on the font. Being the foolish typophile that I am, I chastised the people running the site for allowing font piracy on their site, while they berate game piracy. <BR> <BR>Here's a response I got from a fan on the site: <BR> <BR>&quot;<i>as for &quot;the amount of effort it takes to make a font&quot; please.. dont make me laugh. Making a font is EASY. There are fonts out there that cost thousands of dollars, just so you have the right to use it publicly, its a joke. <BR> <BR>Fonts are not hard to make, stop kidding yourself. and FF DIN is a very basic looking font, clean lines, nothing fancy. I bet it didnt take long to make at all. It would be like me making signatures for people and charging them $1500 a go.</i>&quot; <BR> <BR>I've already blasted him for his ignorance and explained (briefly) that he's wrong, but what I'd like to know is if anyone here knows how long <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=catalog.fonts&amp;searchID=692&amp;searchby=designer">Albert Jan-Pool</a>'s FF DIN <i>actually</i> took to make? <BR> <BR>This is why people pirate fonts. Why non-designers do. I'm just throwing fists against the castle walls in an attempt to change maybe one of their minds.</div>

But I'll point Albert here and see if he thinks it's worth a bother. <BR> <BR>BTW, Linotype Maral took about 800 hours for the Regular and Bold (no italics). But it was my second outline font - I can do it a bit faster now. But not in an hour, like those guys probably think. <BR> <BR>hhp</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I've never made a font, and I've only made small promotional games, but I'm guessing that a game like half-life 2 would have taken many many times more hours than FF Din. I haven't checked the prices of either, but I would guess that FF Din costs more than a copy of half-life 2. <BR> <BR>But its not really about the hours, is it? <BR>You would assume that game designers feel that their role is a creative one, and probably the programmers do too. Designing and creating a typeface is also a creative role. The cost of both products includes a premium for the creativity of their designers. The size of the potential market is also a factor, as well as the composition of that market in terms of individuals or businesses. <BR>There are so many other factors that determine the price of a product that to reduce it to how many hours it took to create is irrelevant. <BR> <BR>Now Mr. 'FF DIN is a very basic looking font' has to answer the question: <BR>If it didn't take very long, and its easy, why did he want to steal someone else's work instead of just knocking up a clean, basic font himself?</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Well, it looks like they're only posting the font resource that comes with the game files anyway, which I believe doesn't have a complete character set. So, while that's not great, it's not terrible. <BR> <BR>My little tirade on the site was meant to be an indirect heads-up to the site moderators to cover their asses and quash any piracy, but we'll see. <BR> <BR>Ironically, Half-Life 2 can cost from <a href="http://www.ebgames.com/ebx/product/235059.asp">$55</a> up to <a href="http://www.ebgames.com/ebx/product/243836.asp">$80</a> depending on which version you get via retail outlets (the collector's version has all sorts of goodies). <BR> <BR>Another interesting note, Valve, the developer, is spearheading a new online content distribution method called <a href="http://www.steampowered.com">Steam</a>. On this platform, there's a $90 version. The interesting part is that it's an actual application that runs on your machine. You actually have to have a web connection to activate their products which is done via an application on your PC. A bit of remote DRM on their part. Considering how open these gamers are to letting Valve crawl onto their PCs and control their software, and the amount of $$$ it takes to get a PC to even play the game decently, I'm surprised they're so defensive about $40.</div>
