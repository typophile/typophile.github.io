    in Genesis was created in the twilight of the 6th day, just before creation was
    finished. This includes script, letters, the stylus, and the actual writing on
    the tablets of the Ten Commandments--which awaited discovery by Moses many centuries
    later. The writing on the stone would have been in either Aramaic (language of
    Abraham) or some Egyptian dialect, as they may not have understood Hebrew, which
    developed from the language of Canaan. Of course this account would not be accepted
    by Christians, but that's as close as you're going to get to an answer to \"In
    the beginning was the Word\". Of course that's Christian phrase--actually originally
    Stoic, but by this point you've lost interest :)  \r\n\r\n   "

  body: "Bill: <em>\u201CIn the beginning was the Word\u201D. Of course that\u2019s
    Christian phrase\u2014actually originally Stoic...</em>\r\n\r\nThe original Greek
    is \u1F18\u03BD \u1F00\u03C1\u03C7\u1FC7 \u1F26\u03BD \u1F41 \u03BB\u1F79\u03B3\u03BF\u03C2,
    and although 'word' is the traditional English translation of \u03BB\u1F79\u03B3\u03BF\u03C2
    in some respects it isn't a very good translation. Aristotle and other classical
    authors use \u03BB\u1F79\u03B3\u03BF\u03C2 to mean 'sentence'. \r\n\r\nIn the
    beginning of John's gospel, \u03BB\u1F79\u03B3\u03BF\u03C2 very obviously refers
    to the second person of the Holy Trinity, i.e. to Christ. You only have to read
    the rest of the sentence and the following sentences for this to be perfectly
    obvious. \u039B\u1F79\u03B3\u03BF\u03C2 is a kind of title and a way of saying
    that the Son comes from the Father as the word/sentence comes from the mouth of
    the speaker, i.e. that the two are as inseparable as speaker and utterance.\r\n\r\nThe
    particular formulation \u1F18\u03BD \u1F00\u03C1\u03C7\u1FC7 \u1F26\u03BD \u1F41
    \u03BB\u1F79\u03B3\u03BF\u03C2 is Christian, leaning on Greek terminology from
    Hellenistic philosophy but, more importantly, consciously referencing passages
    in the Jewish scriptures e.g. Genesis 15 and 1 Samuel 3, that refer to 'the word
    of the Lord' in ways that indicate a distinct person.\r\n\r\n\r\nJames: <em>I
    always took that at its word, that the concept of God etc. did not exist until
    language evolved.</em>\r\n\r\nHow is that 'taking that at its word'? What about
    the rest of the sentence? What about the following sentence? The phrase occurs
    in the midst of a huge book that begins with the premise that all things were
    created by God, which is a pretty good clue that this phrase is not a comment
    on the the linguistic basis of an abstract concept of God. What the beginning
    of John's gospel is saying is that both the Father and the Son were present 'in
    the beginning': \u1F18\u03BD \u1F00\u03C1\u03C7\u1FC7 \u1F26\u03BD \u1F41 \u03BB\u1F79\u03B3\u03BF\u03C2,
    \u03BA\u03B1\u1F76 \u1F41 \u03BB\u1F79\u03B3\u03BF\u03C2 \u1F26\u03BD \u03C0\u03C1\u1F78\u03C2
    \u03C4\u1F78\u03BD \u03B8\u03B5\u1F79\u03BD, \u03BA\u03B1\u1F76 \u03B8\u03B5\u1F78\u03C2
    \u1F26\u03BD \u1F41 \u03BB\u1F79\u03B3\u03BF\u03C2.\r\n\r\nNote, by the way, that
    Greek verb used here is in a conjugation -- imperfect active indicative -- that
    has no direct parallel in English. The traditional 'In the beginning was the Word'
    isn't a very satisfactory translation, because it doesn't capture the sense of
    that conjugation. A more accurate, if less rhetorically dramatic, rendering would
    be 'In the beginning the Word was being'. The imperfect active indicative conjugation
    indicates an action in the past 'in progress' as it were, i.e. at the creation
    the Word already existed. The Greek makes explicit the Christian belief that the
    Son precedes creation, is himself uncreated and, as the rest of the sentence makes
    plain, is consubstantial with the Father."

    serious response to my attempt at humor. I am often amused at sacred works that
    encode multiple meanings into a text. As you might have suspected I was aware
    of the general gist of the Bible. What I find a bit of delight in is that if we
    proceeded from a premise that there was no diety directing affairs we could find
    this verse, the preceding verse, and the one that follows to be essentially true.
    I believe the \"God is light\" verse carries some of the same nuances."

  body: "John, on \"logos\" as alluding also to Stoic and other Greek ideas, that
    is what St. Augustine held, as have many other Christians following him, and I
    think it is likely--though not that the Greeks were proto-Christians, as many
    medieval Christians held. I read that in the 20th century people have tried to
    find ancient Hebraic sources, such as you mention, as referring to concepts similar
    to the Greek 'logos' but frankly that is forced, and not credible for things that
    were written down before the Greek conquest of Judea (332 BCE, IIRC). \r\n\r\nIn
    the passages you refer to, the Hebrew of 'word of the Lord' (devar YHVH) in itself
    does not imply any \"distinct person\", as you seem to think. 'Devar' has many
    meanings in Hebrew, including 'thing' and 'declaration' or 'utterance', as well
    as 'word'. For example, the \"Ten Commandments\" are called in Hebrew, in the
    Torah, \"aseret devarim\", the ten \"words\", meaning ten statements or utterances.
    \r\n\r\n\"Devar YHVH\" is an extremely common phrase in the Hebrew Bible, occurring
    270 times. (I just did a search--aren't computers wonderful!) It is regularly
    used to refer to any message from God to a prophet. You can of course read it
    as some secret code intended by God to refer to Jesus, unknown to the writers
    who wrote it down or readers until the time of Jesus. But it's by no means the
    plain meaning of the text. \r\n\r\nYou should be aware that it is irritating for
    Jews to be told by Christians who do not know Hebrew what the Hebrew really says,
    when there is a continuous 3000 year history of interpretation by people who could
    read the text in the original. Unfortunately many of the polemical Christian readings
    of the Hebrew Bible are downright dishonest. If you are interested in the literature
    debunking these tendentious interpretations, by people who know the Hebrew text
    very well, you can see, for example, the work of [[https://www.outreachjudaism.org/OrderForm.aspx?selected=study|Tovia
    Singer]], a current Orthodox Rabbi who has specialized in unmasking these fraudulent
    polemics. I find this guy amusing as he sounds just like the comedian Jackie Mason--he
    has tapes, but I'm sure the book will do. You should know that many Christian
    scholars who do indeed know the Hebrew text do not find this stuff credible either.
