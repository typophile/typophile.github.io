  body: "Joe, A suit for a junior position? I actually don't think so. I had this
    conversation with a lot of art/creative director friends and we all agreed that
    a suit sets a weird message. Unless you are fashion driven and you wear suits
    (and good ones) most of the time, then it is OK. When I have interviewed junior
    designers, I want to see who they really are, what's their style and what stuff
    they like. Be clean and a little bit more \"dressed\" than normal but be yourself.\r\n\r\nMy
    advice is: if you don't have enough works to show  on your portfolio or you're
    not happy with the few projects from school or work, just make your own projects
    and be serious about it. Research a lot about the company you're having the interview
    and if you know who's interviewing you, research more...\r\n\r\nAnd yeah, bring
    a positive attitude and ask for feedback."

    University</a>, c. 1993, <a href="http://www.gdc.net/about/fellows/articles71.php">Tony
    Mann</a> (scroll down a bit to see Anthony Mann), told us a story of one of his
    old colleagues. He went to an interview with not much of a portfolio at all. Instead
    of showing them what he had done, he gathered examples of what he wanted to do.
    He got the job.

  body: "Regarding clothing, you probably want to dress at the same level of formality
    as other folks in the company.  Most companies have a relaxed dress code these
    days, but some are more formal, especially if they're meeting with a client. \r\n\r\nIf
    the interview is important to you, swing by the company at a time when people
    are coming or going (lunchtime, for instance) and observe how folks are dressed."

  body: Also consider bringing some physical copies of some of your work. I.e. if
    you have designed a few beautiful books, I often think it's better to bring them
    with you, instead of only showing them as a photo in your portfolio, so that the
    person you are interviewing with can interact with the book (feel the paper, see
    the binding, etc.).

  body: Walk a mile in your prospective employer's shoes.  If you were hiring someone
    for the kind of position you seek, what would you like to see or be impressed
    by? One of the greatest skills needed to do design work is the ability to "see"
    the clients problem. This is something you will never find in a pull-down menu.
    Role-play out how an interview might go.  Read everything you can find out about
    the company. Do your homework. What would impress me is if someone could demonstrate
    their problem-solving skills.  You are hired to solve problems, not just to flash
    your glitz.

  body: A little humility never hurts, either. Assuredly, you want to stress your
    strong suits but, if you are presented with a question to which you do not have
    an answer, DON'T try to fake it. Admitting ignorance--humankind's natural condition--is
    better than trying to BS your way through it. "I don't know, but I'm a quick learner"
    goes a lot farther with prospective employers than a fusillade of BS...

    Really, after a week of not hearing what should one do? Just an email? Is that
    all I can do?\r\n\r\nHm, in my experience these things always take longer than
    anyone expects. Employers in small businesses especially don't realise what an
    important decision recruiting someone is, until they're actually trying to decide.
    So I'd wait another few days and if there's still no news then my approach would
    be a quick, polite call."

    to people making initial inquiries by phone, like calling and asking \"Are you
    guys hiring?\"\r\n\r\nBut if you think it also applies to follow-up calls after
    an interview, you might want to follow up with an email instead of a call."
