  workflow makes any sense:\r\n\r\n<ul><li>draw all glyphs</li>\r\n<li>determine left
  offset</li>\r\n<li>determine right offset</li>\r\n<li>make kering pairs</li>\r\n<li>rinse
  and repeat</li></ul>\r\n\r\nDoes this make any sens or am I forgetting something
  or...?\r\n\r\nYour thoughts/experiences please!\r\n"

  body: I usually determine the side bearings when I draw each glyph, not after all
    the glyphs are drawn. Some refinement is usually necessary as more glyphs are
    drawn. Or I may change my mind about the spacing after the glyphs are all drawn
    and make global changes. The key thing is that I work on the spacing at the same
    time I'm drawing the glyphs, not as a completely separate step. The design of
    the glyphs are affected by the spacing and vice versa.

  body: "Okay, you're right of course. Designing glyphs isn't just about the color,
    but more so about white. However, how does one determine offset? Is it about looking
    at the text aligned left, and then right? And then accordingly determine kerning?
    That would seem logical, doesn't it?\r\n\r\nBTW, the design was already made in
    AI, I'm transferring it to FL."

  body: "Determining spacing is a big subject. You might want to look here:\r\n\r\nhttp://typophile.com/node/27804\r\n\r\nDrawing
    in Illustrator may seem like an easy way to design a font, especially if you know
    Illustrator well, but it significantly increases the number of steps towards a
    finished font. And it's hard to work on spacing in Illustrator. Better and faster
    in the long run to draw right in the font editor."

    glyphs in AI, but now I'm all for FL!\r\n\r\nThanks again!"
