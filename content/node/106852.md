  body: "Nike is well-known for its bespoke typefaces and particularly the people
    at [[http://typophile.com/node/103278|Nike Bowery Stadium]] where this photo shoot
    comes from. \r\nThis sample is very close to [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/coniglio/nomad|Nomad]]:
    straight oblique /S transition above median line, low /A crossbar, pointy /M centre
    vertex above baseline, 3 upper terminals /W, straight oblique /R leg. But Nomad
    is bolder and /R is rather off... Some more alternatives: [[http://www.tendollarfonts.com/strassenbahn|Strassenbahn]]
    (/M and /W off), [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/chank/nicotine|Nicotine]] (/W
    off), [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/t26/tempus-gothic|Tempus Gothic]] (/S, /M,
    /R off), [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/virusfonts/bourgeois|Bourgeois]] Condensed
    (mixing Regular/Alternate, probably my candidate for customization as it offers
    a maximum of flexibility), [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/sentinel/primex|Primex]]/[[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/sentinel/big-noodle-titling/|Big
    Noodle Titling]], [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/k-type/enamela|Enamela]], [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/capearcona/ca-geheimagent|Geheimagent]]\r\n\r\nEDIT:
    after further inspection, [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/marksimonson/refrigerator-deluxe|Refrigerator
    Deluxe]] Light might work pretty well..."
