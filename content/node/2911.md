  body: Bottom one looks like a imitation of Neuland &#40;perhaps it&#39;s an artificially
    weighted down version?&#41;.

  body: The top one looks like a pen script, similar to Agfa&#39;s <a href="http://www.fonts.com/findfonts/detail.asp?pid=203120"
    target="_blank">Lisbon</a> or <a href="http://www.fonts.com/findfonts/detail.asp?pid=206274"
    target="_blank"> Amanda</a>. <BR> <BR>I can see that neither of these is exactly
    the same, but if we don&#39;t come closer those may be substitutes.

  body: The top line looks to me like Post Antiqua, only with the &#34;M&#34; digitally
    squished and the rest of the characters slightly extended.

  body: Franko Luin&#39;s <a href="http://www.identifont.com/show?2P6" target="_blank">Ad
    Hoc</a> is alos fairly similar, as are some of the fonts Agfa has of Philip Bouwsma&#39;s
    like <a href="http://www.identifont.com/show?5JF" target="_blank">Trieste</a>
    and <a href="http://www.identifont.com/show?5EB" target="_blank">Corvallis Sans</a>.
    <BR> <BR>I&#39;m afraid I&#39;m running out of places to look. It may also be
    hand-lettered &#40;not a font&#41;, as another possibility to consider.

  body: I agree with Patrick. Post Antiqua is the best match I&#39;ve seen. &#40;I
    was working on my post when that came up&#41;.

    Post Antiqua</a> and <a href="http://www.identifont.com/show?27E" target="_blank">
    Neuland</a> look like.
