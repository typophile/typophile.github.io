  body: "Yes, it's possible in the Character pane. It's the icon with the cap T and
    the arrows beneath.\r\n\r\nI tend to rely on a combination of condensing and negative
    tracking so it's not so obvious."

  body: You can just set the horizontal scaling to 97% in the character panel, or,
    if copy fitting is your goal, you can allow glyph scaling in your justification
    options.
