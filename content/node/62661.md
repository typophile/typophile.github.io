  agreed to become my fiance. Now, I am into wedding design. Any recommendations?
  Please? Things to think about? Best way to get things printed, pressed, embossed,
  whatever reasonably and economically? The wedding is for 50 so we can visit with
  the people we love. The wedding is in Sonoma, CA. We have agreed to have it at Landmark
  Vineyard: http://www.landmarkwine.com/\r\n\r\nI would appreciate some expert advice.
  \r\n\r\nI am going to break out the broad nib pen and do some handlettering. I love
  doing that. Alternatively, I am also looking for some great typefaces for a really
  contemporary, sophisticated, classy wedding look. Our wedding colors are like red
  and orange dahlia. "

  body: "hi Caleb,\r\nhow's the designing going? I recently got engaged and am also
    looking at having the wedding in Sonoma area. I in in Toronto and my family is
    coming from all over, so California is a good middle ground for us. Trying to
    find stylish, graphic designer-friendly locations that will make gorgeous photos
    as well as have little details that we can pick up in the design of our stationery,
    tables, colors, etc. I started collecting some links to wedding invitations that
    other people have done. There's so many letterpress people in San Fran, so I imagine
    any of those firm's online portfolios would be good inspiration. Also designSponge

    so she did a lot of coverage on wedding design materials. Here's a start:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.chewingthecudweddings.com/\r\nhttp://blackpearlpress.com/index.php/\r\nhttp://www.invitesite.com/\r\nhttp://www.oncewed.com/11878/inspiration-blog/inspiration/erin-jang/"
