  in the USA or maybe elsewhere, geared towards post grads and professionals?

  body: This isn't a workshop, but Lynda.com has a huge number of professional graphic
    design video tutorials, including a "creative inspiration" series in which design
    professionals talk about their work. It's a subscription site, but they have free
    sample videos and you can sometimes find a free 3-day pass via Google.

    schools - they sometimes have shorter seminars. I.E. \r\n\r\nhttp://pce.massart.edu/courses/summer/graphic-design/index.shtml\r\n\r\nThe
    Tufte seminar is really amazing, although it's just him talking (nothing hands-on).
    You also get copies of his books as part of the deal.\r\n"

  body: "The TypeEd site does look pretty good. As does its content. While I understand
    it\u2019s presently fashionable, and the design of the site is in itself a marketing
    piece, I <strong>strongly</strong> recommend setting your body copy to black instead
    of grey. When viewed from even a slightly oblique angle it becomes very difficult
    to read on certain monitors such as my MacBook Pro. The primary navigation almost
    entirely disappears and I need to adjust my seat or screen in order to use the
    site at all {I didn\u2019t even notice the braces around the wordmark until half
    way through composing this}. While my eyesight a little less than average\u2014irregular
    astigmatism in both eyes, corrected to normal as best as possible with glasses\u2014even
    with direct viewing I need to increase the type size by ~200% in order to read
    the majority of your content without squinting and straining my eyes (and deepening
    the wrinkles in my forehead ;). I\u2019m confidant a salient typographic hierarchy
    can be achieved without resorting to grey text."

  body: "Chris, I'm also using a MacBook Pro and while their gray type is light I
    can read it, even when viewed at an oblique angle. And I'm in my 50s and wear
    bifocals. So perhaps your monitor is a bit lighter than mine, or your astigmatism
    is a factor. \r\n\r\nBut I agree that it's too light (I especially notice it on
    the \"We're not referring...\" line). Normally I'm okay with gray type (for example
    I think Apple uses it well at their site), but TypeEd went a little too light.\r\n"

  body: "That aside, I\u2019d still be curious to know <em>anyone\u2019s</em> rationale
    for reducing contrast on key typographic elements such as body copy and navigation.
    I can\u2019t wait until \u201Cbig and easy to read\u201D becomes trendy."

  body: 'Gray type usually doesn''t bother me, but small type does. I usually set
    my browser to bump up the type size, but I''ve seen business cards and other printed
    pieces where the type is so small I can barely read it. I suppose my age is a
    factor. '
