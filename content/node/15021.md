  Laser Printers?  I have a used HP 8000n w/JetDirect card, and I'm having trouble
  getting it to print.\r\n\r\nThe printer sees the network card, and the computer
  sees the printer via networked (through a hub). I send a print job, and it acts
  like it's going to print, and nothing. It sends the job, and POOF, amazing disappearing
  print job.\r\n\r\nIf anyone could help, I would be grateful...\r\n\r\nEric"

    might be able to see through a reporting function. Also check for updated drivers
    at HP. Is it with all jobs? Try a photo from P-Shop with no vector as a test.\r\n\r\nLooks
    like a patch for 10.4 is available."

  body: Ok, i tried what James suggested. But then I realized what I asked about whas
    what happened with a straight-thru e-net cable, before I plugged it into the hub,
    now it can't connect to the printer at all.

    printers. Try posting on dealmac.com and you will get a more coherent response.
    Check the apps that came with the printer. See if there is a network sniffer app."

  body: "\"How do I tell what the new IP is?\"\r\n\r\nIf you are plugged in to the
    network,the router will assign an IP to your printer.  This should be visible
    in the digital info window of your printer.  You may have to cycle through to
    get the right one on your printer's LCD readout.\r\n\r\nChrisL"
