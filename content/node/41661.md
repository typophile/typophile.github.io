  body: It looks eccentric enough in enough places that I would call it essentially
    custom even if there is something similar. I hope you get a useful ID. I like
    the way the 9 tucks gently down like a reluctant old style figure.

  body: These are all hand painted with a brush. They might not even be true to any
    typeface at all.

  body: Yes even if they tried. On the other hand maybe there was handbook/sourcebook
    they were meant to copy from.

  body: "Look at the two a's in the lower image. The top looks like DIN, and the lower
    one like Interstate :-)\r\n\r\nActually, these letters look like really ugly,
    bad uncaring attempts at rendering DIN. If you have to try a font to recreate
    this, DIN is a good bet. DIN has been around since the 30s and is the \"official\"
    catch-all engineering font. German architect and engineers' stencil guides are
    DIN\u2026 I have some, and they are beautiful objects (I'd never actually use
    them though)."

  body: "Handlettered. The fat numbers could have been inspired by something like
    Lo-Type.\r\nBTW: Mr Fokker was the ultimate opportunist. Being Dutch he took the
    German nationality to further his interests during WW I and made a fortune during
    that war, using a lot of other people\u2019s ideas in his products (as in building
    the first inline, synchronised machine-gun). After the war he moved his assets
    to Holland, started a plane factory there and was (amongst other things) the first
    to build a monococque passenger airplane (beating Mr. Douglas by years, my US-friends).\r\nHe
    appears to have been not a very nice person.\r\n\r\n . . .\r\nBert Vanderveen

  body: Slightly surprising they weren't using stencils. Btw that's quite a lovely
    set of brackets up there.
