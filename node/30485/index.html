<p>i am using InDesign - 
the top line is letterspaced 10, while the bottom is letterspaced -33.
i did this to line up the outsides of the top and bottom lines, but since both are letterspaced differently, it feels unbalanced.</p>
<p>what would you suggest i do?</p>
<p>incidentally, this is the client&rsquo;s preferred type treatment, not mine.</p>
<p>thanks for your assistance.</p>

<p>There are so many great display fonts that can tell and do so much more for that book cover. No offense, but it looks like your client only has Helvetica and Times Roman on their machine - and so that is what they use.</p>
<p>Couldn&rsquo;t you take some time and actually design a cover marrying the type to the cover art and present that to your client?</p>

<p>The original brush lettering, and its size, made the whole cover look like a parody.
However, now you still have parody proportions, but as you say, that doesn&rsquo;t look right with the mod font.
So perhaps you need to do something to put some more semantic contrast between the setting style and the picture style, to clearly signal that this is not a parody. Perhaps something as simple as knocking the type out of a bar that bleeds off to the right.</p>

<p>Sorry - but it really is difficult to tell the difference when casually looking at Helvetica Neue Thin 35 and Chateau Paris 1960. Take a look for yourself.

<p>nick - i see what you mean about the original design looking like a parody. my take on the book was that the publisher was interested in this for its kitsch value. the majority of the illustrations throughout are of the &ldquo;so bad it&rsquo;s good&rdquo; variety. it wasn&rsquo;t until yesterday that i was informed of the intention to position the book in a &lsquo;museum&rsquo; context.</p>
<p>jackie - i too liked the original placement of the introduction name better and agree that now it feels like i didn&rsquo;t know where else to put it (which is pretty much true).  i sent a few more comps based on nick&rsquo;s suggestions, but the client still prefers the lowercase chalet version. so, i guess that is it.</p>

		<div class="commentbody">oh boy!
now, the client wants the uppercase version again.
at what do point do you tell the client that you think they are making a mistake?
there has just been so many last minute revisions, that i think i should just say ok and go with a design that i think doesn&rsquo;t work.</div>

<p>Rereading my last post, I didn&rsquo;t type quite what I was thinking, I meant the author line knocked out of a bar. Sorry.</p>
<p>As you say, maybe this isn&rsquo;t one for the portfolio, but at least you can take some solace in spacing, leading, and positioning your type nicely.</p>

<p>so, since the title will be set in uppercase, do we think i should go with miss tiffany&rsquo;s suggestion and not full-justify the title? i think that probably looks the least problematic to me.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Nick,</p>
<p>What you can do if you want to justify it - and still have it look fine is for MEXICAN - make if a few point sizes larger so it fills the space.</p>
<p>If you look at the sample I posted on Hel 35 and Chalet &ndash; you&rsquo;ll see that&rsquo;s what was done.</p>
<p>And please, don&rsquo;t forget to Kern!!!!</p>
<p>Good Luck.</p>
<p>And it is always difficult to tell a client back off. Last year, in the middle of an ad campaign for one of my clients, I was pulling my hair out. Hours upon hours doing one ad for one local paper. Even after approval and shipped off, more changes. I reminded him that he hired me to do a job, and he had definitely turned down a wrong path. (Not something a client always wants to hear.)  I was fine with that, however, he sent me a nasty note with a check. I put it aside to look at on a &ldquo;clear&rdquo; day—and never got around to it. Six months later, he was back, apologetic and replaced the check I never cashed. We work very well together now. Maybe 1/2 hr. to put the ad together, I send him home to his wife with it, and even though he&rsquo;ll call with a change an hour later, I don&rsquo;t talk to him. I make him sleep on the job and contact me with ALL changes the next day. It works, we get along very well now. It is not a friendship, but a working business relationship.</p>
<p>It is really okay to remind a client that you are the designer and you were hired to do your job. You created your work listening to all the input the client has given you. It is time for the client to decide which direction, and if too wishy-washy, it is probably time for you to speak  up.</p>
<p>And of course, find yourself a replacement for them&hellip;that is, if they are driving you insane!</p>

		<div class="commentbody">I wonder where your client got the idea that this kind of typeface and setting would seduce the museum store crowd. I ran a museum bookshop for a long time, and the Chalet/Helvetica is not what I would think would grab the customers for this book. It drains the energy from the subject-matter. The type looks like it has accidentally slipped off the cover of another book, say one on 1960s architecture, and is now wondering what it&rsquo;s doing in the land of Mexican kitsch. And I agree with Patty—go with something more meaty, more energetic, like your original design. The title deserves it.</div>
