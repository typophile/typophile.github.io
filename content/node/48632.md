  october, and I was wondering where I should be strolling around in order not to
  miss some typographic hidden - or not - treasures.\r\n\r\nAny ideas warmfully welcome.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\ndr"

    all over this fair city, Broadcasting House (BBC) can be found in Portland Place
    and has one of his sculptures (Prospero & Ariel). \r\nAlso, hit the tube! Some
    of the stations have some beautiful typography from a bygone day, the finish to
    some of the stations; tiling, murals etc might catch your fancy. The outsides
    of some stations still have some old school type too. Check the big ones, Waterloo,
    Charring Cross, Great Portland etc.\r\nA little morbid, but damned grand, is Highgate
    Cemetery - lots of type chiseled into over the top mausoleums.\r\n\r\nAlso, as
    a Londoner, a nice stroll is from Waterloo, past the wheel, over a bridge up through
    embankment and onto Trafalger Sq, There you'll find the National gallery, St Martins
    in the Fields (a real nice building, just finished renovating), and if you want
    you can carry on past Leicester Sq and into the West End proper. You'll see lots
    of type! Sounds complicated, but you just keep heading north. Easy. Just stay
    north of the river. No further south than Victoria!\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    who is both intimate with London and comes from the typographic industry. Tours
