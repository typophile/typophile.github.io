  a hard copy  I found on this  [[http://deniskitchen.com/Merchant2/merchant.mvc?Screen=PROD&Product_Code=PO_RC.ordinary&Category_Code=PO|Robert
  Crumb poster]]. I went through thousands of online fonts (which isn't a <em>chore</em>,
  exactly) and uploaded it to the various automated type ID sites but am still without
  clue. I've also seen it a lighter variant.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance. You guys are
  great.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/phono_5514.jpg]"
