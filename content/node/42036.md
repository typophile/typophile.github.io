body: "Folks \u2014 this a newbie question. \r\n\r\nI have an open type font and I'm
  really unhappy with how they have kerned the question mark. It is hard up against
  the preceding letter. When I have used it I have had to do a clumsy search and replace
  to add 1.25 points between the last letter and the question mark. But I would like
  to be able to edit the font to make this change the default. How can I do this?
  I have Quark and Indesign but not Fontlab or anything that can be used to construct
  fonts. Is it possible to edit these values in the fonts using what I have?\r\n\r\nthanks
  in advance for your help\r\n\r\nEl."

  body: Somehow asking a question makes one look for for the answer. I have just now
    downloaded Font Forge and opened it up, but am still probably some way from understanding
    how to use it. But I guess this is the way. There must be some way to edit the
    kerning against all letters from within this program.
