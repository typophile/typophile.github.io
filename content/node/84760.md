  that crashed and we saved all the files except the logo files for each site. I pulled
  a small version of the FB pagge we created for the client but it is too small to
  use and I now just need to redo the logo so we have a fresh PSD for future reference
  and can readd it to the site and get rid of the crappy version that is on the site
  now. Please help. YOU an see the file on http://anthemfighting.com it is the first
  image in the dcg. i have also attached the file below. '

    I want to say it's part of Adobe CS so you might already have it."

    out though thanks. Ok just checked and that is close, but no cigar. The font was
    not modified just gussied with effects hence the shiny. I apologize for my lack
    of technical speak I have been up over 24 hrs with no sleep and sadly no coffee.  '

    one. I wish I knew how to create a font. Would make our job way easier. '
