  body: the Miller logo is a custom job, but you can pick up <a href="http://www.fontmesa.com/draft_beer.htm">Draft
    Beer</a>, designed after the logo&#39;s letterforms, at FontMesa. It&#39;s not
    free, but you can get it along with all his other fonts for a very reasonable
    $9.95 registration fee &#40;just the cost of a couple MGD&#39;s!&#41;.
