  body: It doesn&#39;t look squashed to me. If it was, the horizontal part of the
    S curves would be thinner. Unless it was corrected after squashing it. But I think
    it&#39;s more likely custom.

  body: Oh you&#39;re so right, Mark. I really passed this off too quickly as  <BR>mechanically
    scaled.

  body: Hmm. Interesting. First I&#39;ve heard of the company. The ID was a  <BR>FontShop
    customer request.
