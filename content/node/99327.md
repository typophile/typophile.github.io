  but unfortunately it's out of my price range. \r\n\r\nAny suggestions are helpful.
  Thanks!"

  body: My suggestion would be to do a Search on Myfonts for 'prismatic' You'll get
    lots of hits many of which are multi-part fonts. Nick Curtis offers a couple that
    are truly inexpensive.

    think it came down to it being free for commercial use but you can't embed it
    (so no web font usage). "

    typefaces]]. They are designed by a professional and are free to download. You
    will have to fill in a form to get the download link, though. Also, the license
    is rather confusing, so be careful of how you use the fonts. '

  body: "Thanks everybody for the replies. I'm attaching an in progress version of
    what I'm working on. \r\n\r\nIn the example I have something very western looking,
    but the weight of the 'W' is off compared to the other characters (too light at
    the bottom), and so I'm looking for something else. I've tried manually creating
    the effect on several fonts I already have, and it just hasn't been working out.
    I've also been through dozens of western fonts to no avail, so I've decided to
    open it up beyond that. \r\n\r\nThe way Boink Drop Shadow and Cameo Antique utilize
    the drop shadow is what I have in mind technique-wise but the characters aren't
    the right fit style-wise. \r\n\r\nI'm looking for something that will fit the
    style of the illustration, so I was thinking something that is bold, uniform,
    and somewhat lighthearted. It could be something really stylized like what I have
    in the example, or something more neutral like Prismatic, just as long as it fits
    with the illustration. \r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/stl-inprogress_4851.png]"
