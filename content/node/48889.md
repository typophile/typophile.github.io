  body: "The closest I can find to this is Canada Type's [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/canadatype/sterling-script/|Sterling
    Script]] which is a revival of Stephenson Blake's \"Youthline\". At least I think
    the lower case is a very close match.\r\n\r\nI actually think your lettering was
    done by hand, but it seems very close to the style of Youthline and other copperplate
    scripts, but in a more condensed form. The initials are the things that I cannot
    match anywhere, and to me this gives weight to the hand-drawn theory.\r\n\r\n-
