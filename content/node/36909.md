body: "I have a client who sent in grayscale images placed in Illustrator CS2.\r\n\r\nMy
  problem is the original psd file is about 8-9 percent darker than it is after placed
  in illustrator. It is looking a little washed out and lighter in illustrator.\r\n\r\nI
  saved it as an eps and rasterized it in photoshop and it is indeed 8-9% lighter
  in the \"black\" areas.\r\n\r\nIs there any way to fix this? Is something not set
  right?\r\n\r\nThe file is to be output in cmyk mode, it looks ok if I convert the
  grayscale to cmyk, but if the printers equipment is slightly out of calibration
  I can't have a color cast in the black/gray areas. The file also has spot colors
  in it, but they are concerned about their gray images.\r\n\r\nThanks for any help.\r\n\r\n"

    preview the percentages of the colors, you need Acrobat pro to do this, or in
    InDesign you could place the AI file then check it in separations output. Sometimes
    Illustrator renders diffrent than PS than Quark than Freehand, etc.\r\n\r\nI would
    not change a greyscale to CMYK, cause your gonna get press issues, like very inconsistant
    greyscale balance, or MUD.\r\n \r\nThe Truth shall set you free"

  body: Check if the greyscale image is profiled or not, and then check if the colour
    settings in Illustrator and Photoshop are correct for your workflow and synchronized.
    If the greyscale image isn't profiled, Illustrator might tag it with a profile
    that in effect transforms the greyscale values eg. making it darker in the shadows.

  body: This is definitely a conflicting color profile. Check your color settings
    in Adobe bridge and make sure all your adobe CS apps are in sync.

  body: "I just re-read my question, sorry, I got it backwards.\r\n\r\nThe original
    image (in psd) is darker which is what the client wants. Illustrator is making
    it output lighter.\r\n\r\nIt that still a color profile issue? Sorry if I sound
    ignorant on this, I've never had this come up before."

  body: "It's most likely a profile problem, yes.\r\n\r\nJust check your color settings
    in Illustrator and Photoshop (Edit -> Color Settings). They should be set correctly
    for your workflow, and both be the same. Also make sure you set the Color Management
    Policies right, probably set to Preserve and check all tickboxes (if the embedded
    profile is different, it will ask you what to do with it) You should probably
    do Adobe RGB (1998) for RGB, and whatever CMYK profile is default where you are
    at (I use Euroscale Coated/Uncoated v2 as default). It's not waterproof colormanagement,
    but at least it will be consistent.\r\n\r\nI am always amazed when I check the
    settings at other designers computers, to see they have it set completely wrong.
    Or not at all.  :)"

  body: Good one. Always check those settings, for example if you're working on a
    different workstation or something. Otherwise all kinds of surprises might turn
    up later. :)

    - that way you will always be synchronized.\r\n\r\nIlustrator preview is not to
    be particularly trusted. Make the PDF like was suggested and measure it - you
    can open it and rasterize it in Photoshop if you don't have Acrobat Pro or InDesign.\r\n\r\npbc"

    resaved the ai file as a pdf and rasterized it in photoshop, then checked it against
    the original image that was palced in ai. Thats is how I checked the percentages
    to make sure they were correct."
