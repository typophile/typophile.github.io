  body: I did a search and my guess is modified font(s). The distressed tail of the
    F swings further around than ones I saw. Walbaum Fraktur had a similar F, but
    with tapered right side on the the top cross stroke. Most 8's that I saw were
    either more modern looking rounded versions or angular, but stiff looking. This
    8 is much nicer than those. It could be hand drawn, but is likely one or more
    fonts adjusted in Photoshop.
