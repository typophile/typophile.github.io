    the dateline. Don&#39;t know about the 2003. '

    isn&#39;t it. Of course, it&#39;s  <BR>tough to tell without previews at  <BR>www.testpilotcollective.com.

  body: Hello, <BR> <BR>I know where the typefaces can be previewed. <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"
    ALT=":&#41;"> but, I can&#39;t tell- yet. <BR> <BR>The new and improved Test Pilot
    Collective site will go up on January 1st, 2003. It&#39;s been a long time coming.
    I&#39;m very sorry for the lack of font showings on our current site. I suck,
    I know. The new site will have new fonts with multiple showings, 2 new designers,
    some posters and tshirts, and a secure online ordering and download system. <BR>
    <BR>I used Cam on today&#39;s firstpage- <BR><A HREF="http://www.testpilotcollective.com/firstpage/12_04_02.html"

    <BR>enjoy. <BR> <BR>thanks, <BR>Joe
