body: "This is part of a Logo I helped design back in 2009 for friends. Now they want
  to update / change and I'd really appreciate finding that Font again. The logo itself
  has about 50% oversize (taller b/l/t stems) but not remembering exactly how much
  I added, the current example may or may not match the original font proportions.\r\n\r\nMy
  best guesses so far (using various online type-Id services)\r\n\r\nITC Bauhaus (by
  Benguiat; open types, logo has closed types; t has a tail, logo has straight bar)\r\nBryant
  Pro Alternate (by Eric Olson; not slanted e crossbar, closest match so far)\r\nKabel
  (by Linotype, two-storey a, t with tail)\r\n\r\nThanks in advance for any help!\r\n\r\nLewis\r\n"

    remember if it was an unmodified font, or if you customized any of it. To me,
    this looks either like it has been customized, or else mixed from several fonts.\r\n\r\n-

  body: "Mike, \r\nIt's difficult. They say I did all of it, while I just remember
    adding the lengths and the swoop around the text. If no typeset can be found,
    I'll take this as answer and attempt to reconstruct... Or I'll just take the image
    data and work around that...\r\nThank you all the same!\r\n-Lewis"
