body: "[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Central_5166.png]\r\n\r\nHi All,\r\nI've
  searched all over and I can't find what typeface this is. It has elements of a Bodoni
  like the 'f' and 'T' but I can't find anything that has a similar 'S' or 'C'.\r\n\r\nIf
  anyone knows what it is or has any suggestions of something similar I'd love to
  know.\r\n\r\nThanks so much in advance."

  body: all the lc 'a' letters look different, so my guess is, this is hand lettering.

  body: Thanks. I figured it was custom. Thought it might have just been based on
    something.
