  I\u2019m using bits and pieces from here and there, and I have a slide show (in
  an iFrame), an audio player and some fancy MouseOver moves, all of which call for
  the latest release of jQuery. The navigation buttons will swap out the iFrame contents,
  most of which will also have jQuery scripts.\r\n\r\nWill one call for the jQuery
  file on the main(index) page cut it, or do I have to include additional calls on
  each of the iFrame HTML pages?"

    iframes? I thought I was outdated \u2026 There is no need to load a new HTML document
    in an iframe. You can easily load just the content into a div tag without reloading
    the page. It sounds very much like you need a developer."

  body: "Frode,\r\n\r\nThe new site will have a play-pause button for the music, so
    visitors can kill it if they want.\r\n\r\nFrameset is dead meat, which is what
    my site uses now, but iFrame is fully HTML5 <a href=\"http://www.w3schools.com/html5/tag_iframe.asp\"
    target=\"_new\">A-OK</a>. I chose to go with an iFrame because it will allow me
    to edit a smaller file when I update. Plus, the extra jQuery scripts for each
    new iFrame won't need to be loaded until (or unless) someone navigates to those
    pages."

    includes to have every page include the repetitive elements. \r\n\r\nIf you want
    to stick with the iFrame, if the iFrame, itself, needs jQuery then, yes, that
    page within the iFrame needs to reference the same jQuery files as the other page. "

  body: "Darrel,\r\n\r\nThanks for reminding me about SSI: I haven't used it in about
    ten years, but\u2014yes\u2014it does help keep files tidier. The problem is, the
    site will have a main staging area that will swap out content, depending on the
    menu link clicked, and most of the content has a lot of overhead, in terms of
    images, text blocks, additional styles and scripts. The only real candidates for
    SSI would be the header and footer, which take up less than twenty lines of code.\r\n\r\nWhat
    I want to end up with is an editable file similar to the XML file used to change
    images and text in my old site: I didn't have to wade through yards of code, and
    all the data categories had logical names. iFrame seems the most sensible solution.\r\n\r\nAnd,
    FWIW, some people like the music (they write me and tell me so0, but I will put
    a kill button for the audio on the next version.\r\n\r\nDu\u0161an: The site is
    all hand-coded\u2014all those years of using SGML (HTML\u2019s grandaddy) marking
    up copy for dedicated phototypesetting came in handy. CMS and eCommerce will probably
    figure in to the next version.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Since I did our website recently (a couple of months ago), I'd like to share
    you my experience since I think you'll put a lot efforts in HTML website and in
    maybe a year, you'll decide to swap into CMS.\r\n\r\nWhen we started, we had an
    HTML/CSS/JS based website that, at first, seemed easy to maintain. After each
    new font, I had to edit around 50% of existing pages to make possible for new
    font to conceptually follow the other fonts in website. It takes time, you'll
    always something forgot to do and you'll notice that after days/weeks/months and
    in one point you'll end up probably disappointed or just sick of it. And you'll
    always lack for something. Simple, it's not it, it's not good solution for longer
    run.\r\n\r\nMy advice is to go straight to CMS.\r\nMake template, define all the
    pages/sections, prepare content, hire developer who will do it for you, pay what
    it costs and be happy for next a couple of years. If you use some stable CMS,
    that develops all the time, there's a good chance you might be able, for some
    next website layout change, to just do new template and keep same CMS, database....\r\n\r\nIt
    costs more, but it's more effective, more easier, more functional and more practical
    solution then HTML.\r\n\r\nCheers."

    eventually wind up. For the present, I simply want a placeholder site that\u2019s
    not Flash-based, so it isn\u2019t invisible to some Mac users.\r\n\r\nAlso, keep
    in mind that your product line is relatively limited compared with mine, which
    now numbers of 600 families and more than 1,000 separate fonts. I'm in the process
    of slowly updating all of them and building a single, comprehensive database\u2014both
    of which are necessary first steps before calling in the coders."
