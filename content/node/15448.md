body: "Hi all, it's been a long time since I last posted on Typophile, but at least
  I lurk here regularly whenever I have time.\r\n\r\nI am currently working on a stationery
  system redesign, and obsessing on a typographic detail.\r\nIn setting type on a
  main single column, it makes sense to divide it in logical blocks with vertical
  space, like this:\r\n\r\naddress block\r\n(more than one line)\r\n\r\nphone\r\nfax
  number\r\n\r\ne-mail address\r\nwebsite URL\r\n\r\nI am wondering if the best solution
  is to separate the paragraphs with hard returns but keeping the leading constant,
  or opt for vertical space lines with reduced leading. For example: let's say my
  text blocks are set at 8/10 pt, but my space lines have only a leading of 6pt.\r\nIs
  the asymmetrical leading a faux pas in this case? I wouldn't think so, since it's
  not running text, and the column certainly looks more compact than with the other
  solution. Is there a rationale in deciding how much to reduce leading, like dividing
  it by half maybe?\r\nI could provide my own screenshots, but I found an example
  of asymmetrical leading in a stationery system here also:\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.irisassociates.com/notts_dev/stationery_examples.html\">University
  of Nottingham stationery</a>\r\n(the business card link is probably the best one
  to see what I am talking about, on the right column)\r\n\r\nWhat is your opinion
  on this? Would you separate blocks with simple hard returns instead?\r\nThank you
  all for your answers."

    leading in a proportional increment is a good practice in running text but in
    this case I would agree with anything that works.\r\n\r\nH\xE9ctor"

    it shouldn't be a problem.

  body: "I really think that the guide has to be the appearance other than any set
    spacing rule in cases where it isn't running text, but rather separate groupings
    of information. It must make sense optically instead of numerically, in other
    words. With a business card, where several related but distinctly different groupings
    of information have to be conveyed, I don't even think that the driving concern
    should be consistency. The goal is to move the reader through the info at the
    pace YOU intend.\r\n\r\n"

  body: "With the blocks that you suggest, the space between numerals and email address
    might appear more due to the absence of descenders on aligning numerals, unless
    like the link you provided you have an uppercase postcode. If the last line of
    the address contains upper and lower case you could work on a percentage of leading,
    you could, for example, specify half line space after address block and third
    line space after the numerals. However, because aligning numerals are the same
    height you could also consider greater leading for the two lines of numerals.\r\nTim"

  body: "Thank you all for your imput.\r\nActually, the column of text has 5 blocks
    total, all consisting of two lines: so it is symmetrical already.\r\nTim, I have
    to confess that I am doing something a little against the rules: I am using old-style
    numerals, even though it's not running text. Would that be a mortal typographic
    sin in a stationery system?\r\nI know you're supposed to use lining figures when
    you stack lines of numbers, but I am using small caps in two blocks, and I hate
    the way lining figures look with them (I have T and F for telephone and fax in
    small caps, plus IVA and CF in the last block also, which are the Italian equivalent
    of VAT numbers). The CF line is actually a mix of numbers and letters, and I think
    small caps + old style figure look great in this case.\r\nSo, with 10 lines of
    text stacked in blocks of 2, the column is quite tall: I like the way it looks
    with line spaces of reduced leading instead of simple hard returns. It adds a
    certain variety, and the column looks much more compact.\r\nI think I'll opt for
    that solution, reducing the leading by half in all the space lines since my numbers
    do have ascenders and descenders."

    posts have said <em>if it looks good, it is good</em>, essentially you are trying
    to present your client's information in a useful* and attractive way. Personally
    I prefer the look of old style numerals.\r\n\r\n*by useful I mean that the recipients
    of the letter/business card can pick out the details they might need.\r\n\r\nTim"
