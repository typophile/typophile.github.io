  body: "Pssst: If you would have taken a closer look at industrial-organic.net, which
    I just did, you would have noticed that <a href=\"http://www.industrial-organic.net/workpages/html/type/type_motter.html\"
    target=\"_blank\">Justin Kay actually 'created' a digital version of 'Ombra'</a>,
    but that one may not have been authorised and therefore not available.\r\n\r\n<em>(
    But, as it says on the site, Some of the pre digital Motter types may be available
    in the future by / from his sons ( ? ), at <a href=\"http://www.motter.at\" target=\"_blank\">www.motter.at</a>.
