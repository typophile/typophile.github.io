body: "Howdy Typophiles! \r\n\r\nIn my Indesign document I have a page of images that
  are numbered and would like to have a list of captions with corresponding numbers.
  Some of the images will share the same captions so I'd like to have two to three
  numbers listed with commas separating them I'd like the numbers to be right justified
  :\r\n\r\nHere is a sample:\r\n<a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/58054945@N05/5338110059/\"
  title=\"Numbered List Example by mell_wall, on Flickr\"><img src=\"http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5049/5338110059_5335fe2374.jpg\"
  width=\"393\" height=\"500\" alt=\"Numbered List Example\" /></a>\r\n\r\n   \r\nI
  tried setting up my numbered list, set the numbers to right alignment so that the
  single digits would be right justified with the two digit numbers. I then saved
  as a paragraph style and from the character styles pallet clicked on \"Convert numbering
  to text\". However when I try to add another number and comma to the mix is throws
  off the spacing between the numbers and the captions. \r\n\r\nThe only other way
  I can think of achieving this is by creating two text boxes: one with the numbers
  set to right justified and the other with the captions set to left justified. The
  tricky part is getting the leading to line up and I'll be using this style throughout
  a fairly large document.\r\n\r\nDoes anyone know of a fix for this problem or a
  good tutorial they can point me to?\r\nThanks for your help!"

  body: 'For correct leading use the baseline grid and the numbers and the items should
    be separated by a tab stop. There is no need to create multiple columns as long
    as the numbers don''t have more than one line (then use a table). '

  body: You will need to use a right aligning Tab, a left paragraph margin and a negative
    first line margin.

    numbers.\r\n\r\nBTW, did you know there is a version of Gill Sans with \"1\" that
    doesn't look like \"I\"?!"
