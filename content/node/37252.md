  the glyph, and then have to type lots of numbers into the Metrics window so that
  P\xC1T\xC1V\xC1W\xC1Y\xC1O\xC1G\xC1C kerns the same as PATAVAWAYAOAGAC does, and
  hope I haven't forgotten any pairs. I'm not looking forward to doing this too many
  more times. Is there a way to copy all the kerning-pair information from a character
  and put it into another?"

  body: It's my understanding that TypeTool 3 will generate OpenType fonts (TT2 doesn't),
    so I would assume (perhaps foolishly) that it also supports class-based kerning.
    If it doesn't, however, you can generate a PS Type 1 font, open the .afm file
    in a simple text editor, make changes there, then import the new metrics back
    into your .vfb file. Admittedly, it's a pain, but it may be less painful than
    coming up with the cash to upgrade to FontLab Studio...

  body: Well there's also kerning classes in FontLab. Basically when you set kerning
    for key letter all others get the same values automatically as well.

  body: "Searching the TT3 manual for the word \"class\" gives me a description of
    class-based kerning in \"what is kerning\" and lists it as a feature in \"the
    advantages of OpenType\", but it is mentioned nowhere else. Opentype support in
    TypeTool is basically limited to exporting a font in Opentype format with no Opentype-specific
    features. I haven't acquired VOLT yet; maybe it does class kerning as well as
    lookup tables?...\r\n"

  body: "I fiddled around with VOLT for a little while before deciding it was a little
    too challenging for (lazy) me, but I'm fairly sure that, while it can add OpenType
    tables and features to a font, it won't generate those features (although there's
    an active VOLT forum in MSN Communities, and someone among them may have developed
    add-ons which they are willing to share).\r\n\r\nAnother option--if you're not
    up to tackling the .afm file editing mentioned earlier--is to set up a kerning
    pairs text file that makes the task a little simpler, such as...\r\n\r\nAV\xC0V\xC1V\xC2V\xC3V\xC4V\xC5V\r\n\r\n...and
    so on. Once you determine the first value, you can simply tab over and fill it
    in the same value for the remaining pairs. Or upgrade to FontLab Studio..."
