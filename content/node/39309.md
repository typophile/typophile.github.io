    more \"square\" Sans Serif could be [[http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/linotype/univers_lt_std_65_bold_ot/|Univers]],
    but it is not exactly \"squared\". It appears more \"square\" when compared to
    Futura or Helvetica. The \"square\" parts of it are the counters and the bowls,
    but still, like I said is only has the subtle nuance of \"square-ness.\"\r\nAlso,
    [[http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/fontfont/ff_din_ot_bold/|DIN]] might
    fall into this as well.\r\n\r\nIf you are looking for a square typeface might
    want to try:\r\n\r\n[[http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/bitstream/square_721_bold/|Square
    Bold]]\r\n[[http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/linotype/eurostile_lt_std_bold_ot/|Eurostile]]\r\n\r\nThese
    faces are as far as you can get before moving into perfectly geometric characters
    or \"techno\" fonts (I hate using that term as a classification):\r\n\r\n[[http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/font_bureau/agency_bold/|Agency]]\r\n[[http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/elsner_flake/bank_gothic_medium/|Bank

    [[geometric sans]]. These are typefaces based on a perfect circle.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/monotype/futura_std_ot/\">Futura</a>\r\n<a
