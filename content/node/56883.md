  fuzzy.\r\n\r\nWhat I want in my prints is dark and crisp text.\r\n\r\nWhat type
  of printer do I need to achieve super crisp text? And what type of paper? I'm not
  looking to buy anything super-expensive, just the proper stuff that will meet my
  needs.\r\n\r\nI'm printing mostly high school coursework. Cost-effectiveness is
  also a plus, I'm sick of replacing my ink so often."

    inkjet printers. Just stay away from color lasers, as I\u2019ve found that consumer
    models are prone to breakdowns."

    cartridges are expensive, but if you're only printing text (no large solid areas),
    a cartridge should last 12 months.\r\nYou can also use less expensive paper."

  body: "<cite>\"Just stay away from color lasers\"</cite>\r\nIn the budget/consumer
    market, color lasers also tend to have worse resolution than b/w lasers. So if
    you mainly need/want high quality in text, definitely go for a b/w laser."

  body: 'I recently purchased an hp p2015 for a couple hundred bucks from newegg.
    It''s 1200x1200 dpi and the text quality is really nice so far. My only complaint
    is that really thick black areas (+.5") lose density in the middle but I''m running
    garbage thin recycled paper through it. A smoother, brighter and more opaque paper
    would look great, try some Hammermill Great White if you want something decent. '
