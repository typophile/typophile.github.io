  in New York by Scottish immigrants [[George Bruce]] and his brother [[David Bruce]]
  in 1813, later joined by David\u2019s son.\r\n\r\nIn 1838 the foundry made a major
  advance in typefounding: [[David Bruce, Jr.]] patented the Pivotal Typecaster in
  1845. It made 6,000 pieces of type per hour, a rate that so threatened the employment
  of many handcasters that a group of them plotted to destroy the machine. The device
  was used by other typefounders, notably [[Miller & Richard]].\r\n\r\nThe foundry
  was acquired by [[ATF]] in 1901."
