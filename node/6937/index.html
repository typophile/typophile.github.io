  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">So here is the situation. <BR> <BR>I am 26 years old and I live in Baltimore, MD. I am a graphic designer for an Engineering Firm and I absolutely HATE my job!! The trouble is that in the 4 years that I have worked here I have produced no interesting work for my portfolio. I would like to become a better designer, but I don't know how. I read books and magazines on design all the time to try and improve myself, but without any clients or direction I seem to just be treading water. I barely have any work to do at my current job so I have plenty of free time to do stuff, but I Just don't know where to go for inspiration. <BR> <BR>This place has pretty much sucked every ounce of creative drive out of me and if I don't get out soon, then I might as well just choose a differnt career because I will be so far behind the curve compared to other designers. <BR> <BR>I know that this is a type website, but it seems like there are quite a few truly amazing designers on these boards who might be able to shell out some advice. <BR> <BR>Any help would be greatly appreciated.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">One good exercise is to look around you and try to  <BR>find interesting stuff that's been poorly designed. <BR>Then consider it as a job to make something better  <BR>out of it.

		<div class="commentbody">Honestly Eric you have three options . . . <BR> <BR>1. (safest) Find opportunities within your company to grow into a new position because after 4 years you should have some goal where you'd like to be in the organization instead of grunt boy. <BR> <BR>2. (safe) Continue to work there full time and look for a new full time job, then jump . . . <BR> <BR>3. (unsafe) Quit! - There is nothing more self-inspirational than not knowing where  your next meal is coming from. I have long held a personal philosophy that if the present isn't as good as the uncertain future, it's time to move on. I've taken my own advice many times and never had a regret once. <BR> <BR>It's your own decision so listen to your gut and make sure you're not being influenced by outside forces you may resent later, discussion forums included . . . <BR> <BR>:D</div>

Wether it is night classes or a graduate program, it's a great way to reconnect and also make contacts and develop collaboration.

What you can do: <BR> <BR>1. talk to your boss. tell him what you're thinking - but be the smart  not the right guy. do that with big smile (even you hate your place). use the big words: you want more responsibility etc etc. <BR>what is the worst thing that he can do? tell you to go home? anyway you want to do that. <BR> <BR>2. that is to say - don't burn your bridge. maybe the new place is going to call your boss and ask about you.  <BR> <BR>3. never ever say - if you're looking for a new job - that you hate your place etc etc. People don't like to hear that. <BR>and your new boss can ask you: if your place is too bad - what you're doing there for 4 years!!! <BR>and every job there is a &quot;gray&quot; area. <BR> <BR> <BR>4. jump and swim - use creativehotlist.  <BR>talk to your friends. tell them that you're looking for a job. if you don't talk - people can't hear you.</div>

I took a little inspiration from Stephen King who worked 4 hours everyday after he got off of his day job. I made sure to set aside a certain amount of time every week where I could do my own thing, and catch up on what I was neglecting. <BR> <BR>I did couple pro bono pieces for a community radio station and a local magazine, and I used those to headline my portfolio and find something a little more satisfying. Or at least less soul crushing. <BR> <BR>Still, I have to say that work is work. Didn't Hunter S. Thompson say something like, &quot;As soon as it becomes work, it's no longer fun.

		<div class="commentbody">I do a bunch of awful work for the money right now. My wife is the one making big strides. Pro-bono work has landed me a spot in a design annual, which helps while I'm putting financial pieces in place. <BR> <BR>If you have a long-term plan, goofy money work can be more tolerable. And, what is less than satisfying work for me is making my clients very successful and competitive in their worlds. <BR> <BR>Start in on a self-promotion piece, and save the money to make it happen. Send your pro-bono work in to competitions, and if you get in, and they send you an interview questionnaire, write something nice and send it back in promptly. You might get some free press.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I think quitting and finding something better is the best way to go. <BR> <BR>However, the most realistic way (I'm relating it to my experience here) is freelance/pro-bono. I've got one of each, and it keeps me in a position where I A) make a bit more money (not much more, but whatever) and B) have some creative autonomy and grateful clients, along with variety in my portfolio. <BR> <BR>Also, I've got a blog to vent a little creative steam. Eventually, I'll turn it into something more design-oriented. It's nice to have the option there for something more. That's what a lot of those feelings are about. I'm 25, and I had a <i>similar</i> epiphany about 6 months back. It lead to some fun and interesting design work. I've had to adjust to a different way of living (a somewhat unpredictable flow of work) but it's been worth it.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">What a lot of excellent advice! The only bit I might well add is a reinforcement of this thought (and others like it): <BR> <BR><i>if yer not doing anything interesting at work, make projects for yourself. design yourself a logo for your personal studio, design yourself a website, a business card, some stationery, etc.</i> <BR> <BR>To make such self-assigned work as useful as possible, I would try to base that work on subject matter with which you are already familiar. Reasons: <BR>1) Familiarity with the subject might make more research unnecessary&hellip; less research, more time to design. <BR>2) For those subjects about which you have pre-existing knowledge, you <i>might</i> be able to generate more genuine enthusiasm&hellip; more enthusiasm, better quality product. <BR>3) To those who have knowledge about a particular subject, factual mistakes might be more noticable (and, therefor, more likely to be corrected), than to one who is new to the subject. <BR> <BR>Some examples: cd packaging for a musician or group that appeals to you; advertisement or poster for a sport or activity that you enjoy; promotional material for a charity that you support. <BR> <BR>I hope that this small addition to the other great ideas is helpful. <BR> <BR>cheers, <BR>Dana</div>
