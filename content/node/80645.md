  year?) where somebody showed some glyphs (I seem to remember an \"O\" or \"o\")
  where once the outer and once the inner contour was \xABugly\xBB/uneven, and discussed
  the effects; which, IIRC, were essentially that faults in the inner contour were
  noticeably more prominent and jarring than in the outer one. Now I can't for the
  life of me remember who/where this was, but I hope I haven't only dreamed it because
  the effect was really interesting, and I'd like to find out more.\r\nDoes anyone
  know what and/or whom I'm talking about, and can point me in a direction to find
  out more? Many thanks."

    did the same thing once to the inner, once the outer contour (FL: Action > Add

  body: "Here's a theory: when you look at a shape, you tend to look at its center
    point (or maybe its \"center of gravity\"), and the closer something is to the
    middle of the fovea the more detail you see in it. Since counters tend to be closer
    to the center than the outsides, you notice the defects more.\r\n\r\nBut this
    only applies to individual large shapes (deliberative, non-immersive reading);
    in the case of boumas (which kick in during immersive reading) it must be more
    complicated.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    on again. Agree the inner contour distortions are way more jarring. I'll come

  body: Here's another theory. Inner counters are much smaller, therefore distortions
    are proportionally greater than the same distortions on the outer contours.

    a [quick] version where the distortions on the outer contour are proportionally
    equal to those in the inner one (the outer contour of the right hand glyph is
    a scaled-up version of the inner contour of the left hand one).\r\nI agree the
    effect is less pronounced, but isn't it still visible? (Although now another effect
    kicks in too, because in the right hand one the thickness of the stroke varies
    more. Uh oh, I see this getting complex.)\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/innen-aussen-scaled_5391.gif]"

    (And obviously the disturbance in the outer contour is much bigger in the x-direction
    now, due to the unequal scaling.)\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/innen-aussen-scaled2_4862.gif]"

  body: "Thanks for letting us judge that. For me the same thing holds true, that
    the left example is more anxiety inducing (even when looked at with the head sideways).
    Funny, when I let the eyes defocus the opposite is true, probably because the
    stroke width changes more as you mentioned before.\r\n\r\nSomething I read somewhere
    argued that rather than the counter being background to the black shape, it is
    more perceived as a second layer of foreground, above the black shape. Perhaps
    this would account for the more profound effect as disruption of the fore-foreground.
    I wonder how one could prove or disprove this. \r\n\r\n"

    is that, since the inner contour is the relationship between two defined black/white
    areas, our perception of \u201Cerror\u201D is greater than the one where (the
    outer contour) this relationship is between a finite area and a virtually infinite

    or something.\r\n\r\n@James (Dunwich Type): What I meant was, I suspect this effect
    might not be as obvious/relevant/applicable in text (1) because of scale: at text
    sizes, the distance and hence the difference between acuity/sharpness with which
    we perceive inner and outer contours won't be as big as when staring at these
    huge glyphs; and (2) because of context: depending on where we fixate in the context
    of other letters, the (sharpest) focus does not need to lie in the center of say
    an \"o\", as it sort-of automatically does here. (That's what I make from what
    Hrant said, and it seems to make sense.)"

    putting more on the outside actually the opposite of what Nina is getting at?

  body: It might be a function of our primal being back when we were intensely interested
    in seeing both food and predator in our horizon.  I theorize that the outer boundary
    is akin to the forest mantle and acts to frame what is inside our point of view.  We
    would not be alarmed to see foliage surrounding our viewpoint, but if a predator
    or an enemy were to become framed by that vegetative outer area, we would have
    reason to be quite alarmed and surely more attentive to that potential danger.
    Although not impossible, it is certainly less likely that a predator or foe could
    position himself as part of the framing foliage than to intrude on the space that
    it surrounds. This also may partly be why humans attend more to figure than to
    ground in things they see. I think we just focus quickly on what we are conditioned
    to think is crucial to life and sustenance, even if we just ignore all other visual
    stimuli.

    sure that I understand the difference between weathered and distressed. I think
    they are terms that have been invented to describe what I call edge texture...
    interior or exterior. Other terms in lettering include notching, cutting, roughing
