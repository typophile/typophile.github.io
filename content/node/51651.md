  body: "Thank you. Do you think someone constructed the font using letters from different
    fonts and assembled them using a font creation software? \r\n\r\nI'm putting together
    an ID for a client and think it would be perfect for there headline font. The
    thought of having to construct it every time from different fonts sounds to time
    consuming. "

  body: I've just discovered it was designed by Acne Art Department. Any new info
    on the Byredo Parfums typeface would still be great.
