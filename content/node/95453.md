  body: "This was probably produced in the 60s, so it must have been instant lettering
    (Letraset or similar), or photo-set. Look how the 'T' and 'o' are kerned back.\r\n\r\nThere
    were a few phototypesetting systems around at the time.... Diatype/Diatronic being
    one (if my memory serves me well), and sometimes, they had their own cuts of particular
    fonts.\r\n\r\nI've been back through all my old catalogues and I can't get a match....
    but I'll keep looking."
