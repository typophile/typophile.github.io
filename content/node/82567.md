  sent this open letter to Monotype.\r\nThe purpose of this letter is to generate
  a dialogue around the issue of reinterpreting material sources in a predominantly
  digital culture.\r\nWe are Looking forward to hear your opinions about this matter
  on this thread or directly on our  [[http://ospublish.constantvzw.org/news/sans-guilt-it-looks-like-the-story-continues|blog]]\r\nOSP
  \r\n\r\n======================================================\r\nFrom:\r\nOpen
  Source Publishing\r\nRue du Fortstraat 5\r\n1060 Bruxelles, Belgium\r\nmail@osp.constantvzw.org\r\n\r\nTo:\r\nMonotype
  Imaging headquarters\r\n500 Unicorn Park Drive\r\nWoburn, MA USA 01801\r\nus@monotype.com\r\n\r\nBrussels,
  11 April 2011\r\n\r\nDear Monotype,\r\n\r\nWe are writing you because we just published
  Sans Guilt [1], which is a reinterpretation of the Gill Sans released under an Open
  Font license.\r\n\r\nWe are OSP [2], a design collective based in Brussels that
  has been working with Free and Open Source software since 2006.\r\n\r\nWe believe
  that the 71th anniversary of the death of Eric Gill implies that his work is now
  in the public domain. To mark this anniversary we decided to liberate the Gill Sans
  and make a free and open source release of it.\r\n\r\nWe created three variants
  from different sources. One was scanned from original drawings (Sans Guilt Drawing
  Based \u2014 DB), another from hand-printed letterpress (Sans Guilt Lead Based \u2014
  LB) and a third had a digital file as a basis (Sans Guilt Monotype Based \u2014
  MB). The work was done in collaboration with students from the Royal College of
  Art in London.\r\n\r\nOur liberation of the Gill Sans raises legal and ethical questions
  surrounding proprietary font software and works of typography that are in the public
  domain. As designers, we can not answer those questions theoretically so the Sans
  Guilt project is an attempt at finding practical answers.\r\n\r\nTo us it seems
  that the central question about any font reinterpretation is that of identifying
  and transforming material sources. Throughout history fonts have always been adapted
  from previous renderings, often transposing the design from one technology to another.\r\n\r\nIn
  order to explore this historical context and to understand how to work with this
  complicated matter, we released Sans Guilt. The DB-variant is based on original
  drawings by Eric Gill that we found in the RCA library. The images were scanned
  and then traced using a custom software to produce PostScript outlines. The LB-variant
  started from the Gill Sans letterpress available at the RCA printshop. Students
  manually printed the movable type and than scanned the result.\r\n\r\nThe third
  variant is possibly the most problematic. Because to us the digital is material
  too, we wondered if we could use a digital source as a starting point for liberating
  the Gill Sans. For the MB-variant we set a text in a page layout software with a
  licensed Monotype Gill Sans. This text was then turned into a bitmap and ran through
  a software that converted each glyph back into a PostScript outline.\r\n\r\nAlthough
  Gill Sans as a design work is in the public domain, the font software that we used
  to create the material sources for our reinterpretation is not. In the case of computer
  fonts there is a blurring of boundaries between technology and visual design. By
  turning the text into a bitmap image we did not reuse any part of the digital information
  of the Monotype Gill Sans itself. We believe that the bitmap is solely a representation
  of the design work of Eric Gill which we consider to be in the public domain since
  2010.\r\n\r\nWith the creation of Sans Guilt and by writing you this letter we are
  trying to clarify the complicated legal matter around typographical heritage, technology
  and intellectual property and we are looking forward to discuss the implications
  with you.\r\n\r\nKind regards,\r\n\r\nOSP\r\n\r\n[1] http://ospublish.constantvzw.org/foundry/sans-guilt\r\n[2]

    area where I can see some disagreement by many parties, and a case begging for
    a legal precedent.\r\n\r\nI\u2019ve read some unofficial legal interpretations/opinions
    based on U.S. law that say you cannot legally do what you\u2019ve done, i.e.,
    print and scan a digital font to retrace the shapes to then create a new digital
    font. Some say the patent law regarding digital fonts protect the outlines (the
    shapes) even after they are printed. I disagree. Once you print the letterforms,
    they are no longer software. There is no legal protection from that point on.
    Patent and copyright law in the U.S. do not protect typefaces. You can legally
    scan and retrace the letters to create new outlines. You did not copy the protected
    software. You copied the analog shapes of the letters which have no legal protection
    in the U.S.\r\n\r\nThe form of type design appropriation you describe is not new
    to the digital world. It\u2019s been practiced since the beginning of type.\r\n\r\nI
    think the name Sans Guilt is exceptionally clever, and am eager to see how this

  body: "This is not quite so epochal as it is being touted.\r\nGill Sans cannot be
    liberated, because it is not imprisoned.\r\n\r\nThere have been many interpretations
    of Gill Sans, by various foundries, often riffing on his name.\r\nFountain has
    one (Eric Sans), so does Typodermic (Jillican) and K-Type (Gill New Antique).
    And Softmaker/Fontsite (Chantilly).\r\nAnd how about Jan Tschichold's rather blatant
    1933 appropriation, now published by Pr\xE9scence as Tschichold?!\r\n\r\nAs long
    as one doesn't engage in point piracy, or copy a recent, distinctive style of
    type design too closely, there is not really an issue here\u2014certainly not
    for a design as old as Gill Sans, whose designer is long gone. Or unless you want
    to get into an argument with someone like me who actually designs new typefaces.\r\n\r\nThis
    is not a design issue, but a business and legal matter.\r\n\r\nThe process of
    automatically scanning, bitmapping and auto-tracing seems a bit apologetic and
    half-hearted, as a way of challenging copyright and license restrictions, and
    not worthy of debate: scanning is not the manipulation of digital data, but a
    form of photography, and therefore a mechanical, analogue process. To really challenge
    the law, one would have to perform and publish a bit-to-bit transformation.\r\n\r\nSans
    Guilt MB is a dull student project, a technical exercise masquerading as critical
    design.\r\nThe technical quality is poor, it doesn't look like the students are
    picking up much technique or learning anything practical about the aesthetics
    of line and weight.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/eeee_3492.png]\r\nDesign
    is not the uninspired manipulation of an exisiting work, serving as second fiddle
    to prop up a written treatise.\r\nDesigners should design. But artists don't have
    to, and the students involved were from the RCA.\r\n\r\nGuilt Sans LB is a paltry
    offering in a well-worn genre. Metallophile, for instance.\r\n\r\n<em>Throughout
    history fonts have always been adapted from previous renderings, often transposing
    the design from one technology to another.</em>\r\n\r\nThat's incorrect. Throughout
    history, fonts have been made from both new type designs, and as revivals from
    older designs\u2014not necessarily from specific \"renderings\".\r\n\r\nBodoni
    revivals, for instance are rarely facsimiles or straight media transpositions,
    but are usually new works based on the designer's knowledge of various interpretations
    within the Bodoni genre, a synthetic assimilation. Neither is the postmodern Bodoni
    Egyptian an adaptation, although it is pointedly informed by the Bodoni archetype.
    \r\n\r\nRevivals have generally sought to perpetuate the use of typeface designs
    by transposing them from older technolgies to new, and also to give cultural relevance
    to new media.\r\n\r\n"

    since Gill Sans would or could be considered public domain. However, I think the
    gray area is massive and arguable regarding making a copy of type using mechanical,
    analog processes. There is an opinion held that if the appropriation originated
    from the digital font, then it\u2019s a violation for fonts with patent protection
    (based on U.S. patent law). While I think that is the way it should be, I don't
    think that is the actual, standing legal basis of the typographic design patent.
    I interpret the design patent to only protect the digital points and curve algorithms
    in their digital form.\r\n\r\nHere\u2019s a quote: \u201CThe Lucida font family
    (designed by Bigelow and Holmes) were some of the first digital fonts to be given
    a patent. If a designer were to copy them, even by redrawing them from scratch
    using pencil and paper, he would be in serious legal trouble.\u201D\r\n\r\nThat
    came from this source: [[http://scripts.sil.org/cms/scripts/page.php?item_id=UNESCO_Font_Lic|http://scripts.sil.org/cms/scripts/page.php?item_id=UNESCO_Font_Lic]]\r\n\r\nHas
    that opinion of a typographic design patent ever been challenged and/or legally
    upheld? While Sans Guilt may not be the ideal test case, it does present an interesting
    question regarding legal ownership of type and fonts. "

    a little: when I use the terms, \"typeface\" means the abstract design and refers
    to potentially an entire family, and \"font\" means the instantiation of a single
    style of that design, these days in a digital outline format such as .otf or .ttf.
    This is ~ the most common usage of the terms in the type industry, though there
    is no universal agreement on correct usage.\r\n\r\nAs I understand it, a design
    patent applies to each individual style of a typeface, as instantiated in a font.
    What's being patented is the abstract design, but it needs to be instantiated
    in something (a font) to have something to attach the patent to.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\n\r\nT"

    model of rights licensing that by its very openness permits but does not presume
    particular modes of development and distribution. Ergo, there are open source
    fonts that have been made according to traditional modes of design and production,
    which are distributed in a variety of ways by divers organisations or individuals.
    It should also be noted that \u2018open source\u2019 is not a singular model of

    a tip of the hat to Nick Shinn, John Hudson, Thomas Phinney.\r\nAnd just a question
    for OSP: what do you mean by \"font reinterpretation\"?\r\nIt all starts here,
    for me. As long as you try to faithfully reproduce a drawing, or a curve you have
    previously traced on paper, this is not a reinterpretation of anything, it\u2019s
    \"striving to get as close as you can to the design\", or to what you had in mind.\r\nI

    as anything else. Important parts of the overall \"quality\" of the font. Price
    is one aspect of quality. Licensing permissions are another aspect of quality.
    On a par - or even more important - than the visual design.\r\n\r\nYou might feel
    I'm stretching the word \"quality\" beyond it's ordinary meaning. I am, but there's
    ample precedent for it: it has a professional and philosphical meaning as well.\r\nI'm
    using the word in the sense that it is used in manufacturing. For instance, in

  body: "\"Typefaces, yeah. Their digital incarnations, no.\"\r\n\r\nWell, I think
    quality is related to the technical format of a given historical moment, sure.
    But what I was suggesting in an implicit way was related to the care, you may
    say the attention, you put into a product. Which, in the case of a typeface involves
    an aspect which I think can\u2019t be reduced to one of its parts (i.e. \"aesthetic\",
    \"technical\", etc.), but to the whole of it.\r\n\r\nTo make you an example, I
    take the type on your website.\r\nThe typeface you used in your logo seems to
    be derived by autotracing (I may be wrong, given it's tiny, but I suppose so).
    Autotracing is a thing I find mostly inappropriate, since \u2013 in my opinion
    \u2013 there isn\u2019t a piece of software following faithfully complex curves
    and transitions.\r\nThis is particularly noticeable at bigger point sizes, but
    on paper looks unpleasant also in small sizes. And that\u2019s just one aspect,
    I am not getting into spacing, kerning and overall evaluations of the typeface.\r\nPlease
    note I have taken as an example a typeface which is irregular in its vocation,
    but I criticized (in this instance) an aspect which I do not consider only technical.\r\n\r\nScrolling
    down your page: aliased type, now that we can use webfonts, to me it becomes more
    problematic than ever. In my browser I have difficulties to read the summaries
    of the articles, because the point size is small, the typeface you choose is quite
    light and tightly spaced. In many cases, small point sizes would be infinitely
    better aliased.\r\n\r\n<cite>Business and technology enable design up to a point,
    but then they get in the way.</cite>\r\n\r\n@Nick: I agree, although each technology
    has its advantages in defining a part of its value. There is to say that digital
    designs are somewhat \"disincarnated\" as long as they don\u2019t get printed.
    And I wouldn\u2019t live in the world of \"Freejack\". :)"

    I disagree with the \"useful way\" part of that statement, yes, it's a symantic
    stretch, but a succesful one, historically, in other contexts with other work
    products. However, I really didn't expect (and now I REALLY don't expect) the
    idea to fly with frequent commenters and readers of Typophile. What you consider
    external, I consider instrinsic. And that's fine.\r\nI certainly have no problem
    dealing with the aesthetic elements of a font as a thing separate and apart from
    other qualities it might have. How you define your work and the purpose of your
    work has consequences - is what I'm saying.\r\n\r\nNick Shinn says:\r\n\"IMO the
    shape of a curve is more important than licensing permissions.\"\r\n\r\nNow, I
    think the licensing permissions are ten times more important - but that judgment
    arises from an underlying definition of what you are trying to achieve with the
    font in the first place.\r\nIn the next few years, what's more important than
    what will be tested in the marketplace and we'll see.\r\n\r\nA question for Nick:
    I always found Jimi Hendrix's onstage histrionics a turn-off. But audiences loved
    it. (In fact, rock impressario Bill Graham - who certainly had a stake in keeping
    the audience happy - considered Hendrix's stunts - like playing guitar behind
    his back, or with his teeth, or lighting the guitar on fire - undignified pandering.
    He told him to forget that stuff and just play.)\r\n\r\nWas Hendrix's guitar playing
    more important than the stage antics? And if so, why was it more important?\r\n\r\n@jamesT:\r\n\r\n>For
    some reason, I thought you had a stake in \"Open Source Publishing\".\r\nNo moreso
    than everybody does with \"open source publishing\" as a general category.\r\nWhat
    do you mean by stake? And - I'm curious - how'd you link me with \"open source
    publishing\"?\r\n\r\n@picicc\r\n\r\nAs far as the web fonts on my blog: I'll have
    to come back to get into that.\r\n\r\nrich\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
