  section for selected financial services providers in the LA area...i'm looking for
  some opinions on what a good text face might be? \r\n\r\ni'm leaning more towards
  sans serif but serif is not out of the question...\r\n\r\nright now, there's some
  ITC Franklin Gothic small giving address/phone number etc, but that is flexible
  depending on the textface chosen....opinions would be greatly appreciated\r\n\r\nthanks\r\n\r\nw|m"

  body: "If you're setting tables of financial data and blocks of text, a face with
    lining and oldstyle numerals is probably a good bet. That's more common in serif
    faces, but is becoming more common in contemporary sans.\r\n\r\nWithout knowing
    more, that's as specific as I can get."

  body: "a little more....\r\n\r\nit's not going to use tables or speak on financial
    data, for the most part, it's mostly a piece (6 to 12 pages) that's highlighting
    certain \"wealth management firms\"\r\n\r\ni guess it's a little bit about the
    people, the office, their specialties, some of their past clients...\r\n\r\ni'm
    just having a hard time zeroing in on a text face that conveys assurance, confidence
    and longevity in dealing with this subject\r\n\r\nw|m"

  body: "I would think <a href=\"http://terminaldesign.com/retail_specimen.php?ID=1176&viewFam=1\"
    target=\"new\">Giacomo</a>, a sweet sans by Terminal Design, might be ideal. It
    has tabular lining figures as well as proportional oldstyle figures, and looks
    great in a magazine.\r\n\r\nEdit: I just missed your second post. In that light,
    here are two more that might fit the bill: <a href=\"http://thirstype.com/fonts.php?font=ApexSans\"
    target=\"new\">Apex Sans</a> from Thirstype, and <a href=\"http://lux.thirstype.com/fonts.php?font=Section\"
    target=\"new\">Section</a> from Lux Typographics. To me, each conveys strength
    but with a modern flair."
