body: "here's a common problem when constructing geometric glyphs (glyphs based on
  basic geometrical shapes):\r\n\r\nthere's a given point A on the canvas and an unknown
  point B on a curve (circle). that's the case for example when drawing a \"6\".\r\n\r\nthus,
  we need to construct a tangent -- but how? we can do it approximately, but how to
  do it precisely, so that the transition between the curve and the tangent flows
  smoothly  but still geometricaly?"

    the case. One would have to place B on another spot on the circle. Or lower A.\r\n\r\n.

    B resides on a circle, point A can be anywhere outside the circle/curve.\r\n\r\n@bert\r\nthe
    tangent doesn't have to be a 100% precisely constructed. but it should flow smoothly
    into the circle/curve. approximation would be OK."

  body: "Since illustrator does not let you draw circles according to non horizontal
    or vertical diameter you must use a combination of Thales' and Pythagoras' Theorems
    in order to do this geometrically:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/thales_4050.gif]\r\n\r\n*
    construct a line from the center of your circle (we call this X) to your point
    B. We'll call this line a\r\n* in order to construct the Thales circle which will
    intersect with the original circle at the tangent-point we need the length of
    a\r\n* create a rectangle with X and B as corners. note the height and width of
    this rectangle. We'll call those b and c\r\n* In the example picture, applying
    Pythagoras to find a = sqrt(b^2 + c^2) = 228.89 pt gives the diameter of the Thales-circle\r\n*
    Create a circle with a for its height and width and drag its center on the center
    of the rectangle you constructed on X/B \r\n* The points where this circle intersects
    with the original circle are the suitable tangent points.\r\n\r\n"

  body: The naming of a,b and c above is a bit off. Normally one would call the line
    X/A c and use a^2 + b^2 = c^2... But it works either way it's just naming ;)
