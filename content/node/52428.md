  details as per forum guidelines...\r\n\r\nI'm a newish designer, working with a
  great client. They're called Sins Invalid, and they do performance and political
  organizing around disability and sexuality, etc. I've been designing most of their
  new materials over the past few months, and now I'm working with them to redesign
  their website. Here is their current site: http://www.sinsinvalid.org/events.html.
  They are very attached to their current logotype, which is just the group's name
  in Futura Condensed (see below). I have no formal typography training, but the condensed
  font for this use just rubs me the wrong way! My feeling/guess is that condensed
  fonts should only be used when space is really at a premium, not for a display purpose.
  The Futura condensed letter shapes just scream \"smooshed\" to me. I am trying to
  convince them to at least use a non-condensed Futura (also see below), which to
  me is elegant, especially by comparison.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure if there's anything
  I can do to convince them, but perhaps your pearls of (more experienced) wisdom
  will help me either a)realize I'm wrong or b)give them solid typographic reasons
  that they should switch logo fonts.\r\n\r\nThanks! Micah\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/sins_invalid_logo1_6470.gif]\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/sins_invalid_logo2_6264.gif]"

    think it's more important to be consistent. Just be glad they didn't settle on
    Comic Sans ...\r\n\r\n"

  body: "I agree that there is no reason not to use a condensed letter style for a
    logotype. But I can see a few problems with Futura condensed in this particular
    instance. The nature of the cap S is to be beautifully balanced, but arrayed against
    the lower case i the upper and lower counters appear too balanced and the S becomes
    somewhat unstable. I would be tempted to make a minor--and carefully crafted--adjustment
    to the S, slightly enlarging the lower space. The caps in Futura condensed can
    appear slightly too heavy and, in my opinion, the weight of the S, I, and extended
    l need adjustment. The spacing also needs some fine tuning. Ironically slightly
    open space may work better with Futura condensed, and especially in cases where
    it is a stark white on black, and may be all that is required to make the font
    work for this application\r\n\r\nGood luck."
