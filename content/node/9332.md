body: I was contacted recently by someone who is looking for a home for an old but
  only slightly-used Typositor machine. I&#39;m not sure what I would do with it,
  at least without taking it apart. It seems like it would be better for him to donate
  it to a museum or something. Any thoughts?

  body: I&#39;d give it a home in an instant... However, the cost of shipping a beast
    like that to Canada would cause my wife to question my sanity.

  body: Yeah, I told him nearly the same thing. :-&#41; I&#39;m a little closer. He&#39;s
    in Springfield, Ill. and I&#39;m in St. Paul, Minn. He&#39;s only looking to cover
    the costs of shipping.

    that might be interested. I&#39;m worried that this beast will end up either in
    this guy&#39;s dumpster or my basement.

    Every technology seems to go through a period when it becomes obsolete and nobody
    wants it. And then, some years later, after most of it has been discarded, destroyed
    or recycled, the few remaining examples end up in museums. I have a feeling that
    the Typositor hasn&#39;t quite reached the museum stage. I wonder how many still
    exist?

    I used to set on one of these and the display was out so you had to remember your
    strokes and not make a mistake.

  body: No, you&#39;re thinking of the kind of phototypesetting machine that was primarily
    used for setting text.  <BR> <BR>A Typositor was designed for setting display
    type &#40;from 18- to 144-point&#41;. There was no keyboard or display. It had
    a 2&#34;-wide strip of negative film with 72-point character images and worked
    sort of like a photographic enlarger, so you would crank it up or down to get
    the desired point size. To set type on it, you had to peer into a narrow slot
    where the characters would be projected in red light onto a strip of photographic
    paper. When the character was positioned properly, the red filter would be removed
    briefly to expose the paper. Since the paper was actually sitting in the developing
    solution, the exposed character would immediately turn black. You then moved the
    strip to the left to get ready for the next character. Characters were selected
    by cranking the film font reel back and forth.  <BR> <BR>Spacing was entirely
    dependent on the skill of the operator. Typositor film fonts had no spacing indications
    at all, although baseline alignment was very acurate. A skilled operator could
    produce very high quality results with the machine, especially compared to other
    techniques available at the time. Digital type is the only thing that has surpassed
    it in terms of image quality for display type.

  body: I have fond &#40;or not so fond&#41; memories of working with a Typositor
    at my first job in a NYC type shop. You had to be quick and consistent with your
    setting otherwise the individual characters would develop to different levels
    of black. <BR> <BR>The problem with using these now is the supplies. Process photo
    devleoper is easy to come by, but those two inch rolls of photo-sensitive paper
    are hard to find.  <BR> <BR>Peter Bain has done a lot of research into Typositor.
    He has one, with a large library of film fonts. He has popped in here from time-to-time.
    He is the one to ask.
