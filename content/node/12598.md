body: "Ok. I have had ZERO replies from the Apple forums. Calling Sonnet Tech was
  absolutely useless. Equally useless was calling MacMall's tech support. So, I turn
  to you, my fellow typophiles, because I trust that you might have an answer that
  rings a little more clear for a tech-newb like myself. I hope no one minds this
  non-typographic topic.\r\n\r\nRecently I upgraded my AGP G4 400 with an Encore/ST
  G4 1.2 GHz processor and an ATI Radeon 9000 Video Card. I also happened to upgrade
  to CS2, but I really doubt this could be a problem.\r\n\r\nShortly after doing all
  three of these upgrades my machine starting crashing. Two specific kinds of crashes.
  Total lock-up plus the polyglot screen and total lock-up full-stop. I didn't keep
  a log so I can't say with total certainty , but, it almost always happened when
  saving for web in Illustrator while enlarging the image or after enlarging and saving.
  \r\n\r\nI want to guess that it is some sort of heat issue as my computer, while
  it did spiral to crash rather quickly, seemed to get worse over time. How many apps
  I have opened didn't seem to make it better or worse. \r\n\r\nDoes any of this sound
  familiar or feasible to anyone? "

    with CS2 though.  In Illustrator, the keyboard commands (command spacebar or command
    option spacebar) quit working.  Quitting AI and reopening it cures it.  A friend
    of mine who had moved fonts around as suggested by Suitcase had CS2 die and crash
    on him.  He ended up trashing fonts and reinstalling system from scratch to resolve
    it.  I would say that you should try to isolate your problem.  First, go back
    to CS1 and see if that cures it.  If not, swap back your old processor.  A pain
    in the Tuchas, I know.\r\nSorry I can't be of much help.  I just felt you needed
    at least some human response to your cry for help  (and you are \"Special\")  :-)\r\n\r\nChrisL"

  body: "This does sound like a hardware problem, but it's not necessarily a serious
    one. If you installed the Sonnet card yourself, you might try opening up your
    computer and firmly pressing down all its connections (but not <em>too</em> firmly,
    you know what I mean). Same goes for the Radeon. Whenever you put in a new CPU,
    or RAM, or anything else with an edge connector, it's possible for components
    to shift position slightly as they heat up, and then they'll wiggle out of their
    sockets and start getting flaky.\r\n\r\nIf that doesn't work, you can try pulling
    the CPU upgrade and graphics card and putting them back in, just to make sure
    the connections are all tight. The technical term for this is \"getting out of
    the car and getting back in again\". Sadly, unlike in a real car, sometimes this
    fixes the problem.\r\n\r\nIf <em>that</em> doesn't work, and you still haven't
    pitched your computer out the window (which I don't recommend, as that's not likely
    to fix the problem), then you can try only having one of the new components installed
    at a time (assuming you held onto your old CPU and graphics card) and see if you
    can isolate which is causing the problem.\r\n\r\nAlso, if you're running Tiger,
    make sure you upgrade to 10.4.1. It has updated ATI and nVidia drivers, which
    may or may not make a difference with your card."

  body: "Thanks, Chris and Forrest, for replying.\r\n\r\nChris, I had the hairbrained
    idea that it might be font related. One of the places that I could predictably
    crash/lock-up was \"saving for web\" in Illustrator. But, only if I enlarged it
    within \"save for web\" would it lock-up. \r\n\r\nForrest, we did try \"getting
    out of the car and getting back in again.\" Great analogy. I didn't want to throw
    the CPU out, but I was tempted to shot-put the processor upgrade after taking
    it out.\r\n\r\nI am back running the 400MHz and am totally stable. Isn't this
    pretty much a guarantee that it is the processor with the problem? "

  body: I would recommend returning the upgrade and getting a mac mini. It'll only
    set you back a couple hundred more, and It'll be much quicker. Old hardware has
    more bottlenecks than just processor speed. I upgraded my beige g3 to g4 back
    in the day. By the time I got done buying piece after piece I had bought a new
    ATA controller, a new video card, a new processor, a usb card, a 100mbit ethernet
    card and more. I finally ran out of pci slots. If I had sold the old machine and
    put down another couple hundred I could have had a shiny new graphite g4 (with
    a faster bus and new world ROM).

  body: "Hector, that is very nice of you. My IT guy said the same exact thing. I
    now understand why it is easier to buy the machine you intend to use instead of
    trying to manipulate and/or upgrade to the machine you want. \r\n\r\nI am half
    thinking about looking at the OWC processors as a friend of mine had complete
    success with her upgrade. The OWC comes with the added bonus of being able to
    manipulate the jumpers. But, this is down the road. G5s are so inexpensive, relative
    to my situation, that I might just wait for my boss to get a clue. "

  body: "(If I keep the discussion about hardware & avoid talking OS's, will it still
    degenerate into a holy war?)\r\n\r\nHector and Tiff, the big difference between
    Macs and PCs are that Macs are designed as a closed system and PCs are an open
    system. PC users are allowed to pick their processor, their motherboard, their
    video card and their sound card. All these components have to be compatible, so
    a system of standards are in place to ensure that. The good news is that open
    systems promote competition and drive down prices. The bad news is that the standards
    are always written for yesterday's components. Apple computers, however, aren't
    really designed to be upgraded: apple does everything in-house, and sets their
    own standards. The bad news about this is that there is no competition, so the
    prices remain high. The good news is that Apple is not shackeled by outdated standards,
    and dump any that are getting in the way. This allows them to design a system
    who's components are maximized for working synergistically. The bad news is that
    this synergysm does not allow for easy upgrades. Tiff, it sounds like your new
    processor is 4x faster than your old one? If the sewer pipes in your home were
    optimized to carry all your wastewater -- all you used and no more -- imagine
    what would happen if you suddenly started flushing your toilet 4 times more often.
    \ (Sorry about that metaphor: I've been drinking coffee all morning.)\r\n\r\nThere
    are benefits to both systems; I'm not advocating one or the other. There is room
    on the road for custom hot rods, stock Porches, station wagons and buses. You
    just have to remember to avoid putting 35 people into a Porche."

  body: "Tiffany, for upgrades, I'd recommend leasing your hardware. Then you get
    a new machine every 2 or 3 years, rather than the dilemma of upgrading or replacing
    every 2 to 3 years. We just made that policy here and it seems to be a lot more
    scalable, rather than having 3 year old PowerBooks that we feel stuck with.\r\n\r\nThere
    may be some tax benefits that will help convince your employer. =)\r\n\r\nAlso,
    for upgrading OS and software, I like to wait until the .1 or .2 release (rather
