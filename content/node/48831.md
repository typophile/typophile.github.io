  body: "<cite>Again, it\u2019s all in the wiki:</cite>\r\n\r\nWell, yes and no. I'd
    disagree with a bit of it, & some detail is lacking. ITC Baskerville is the same
    as Linotype \"New Baskerville.\" Linotype created New Baskerville, and in the
    days of the Linotron 202, sold it to ITC & then re-licensed it. So us 202 users
    were in the position of being able to buy \"New Baskerville\" from Linotype, or
    \"ITC Baskerville\" from Linotype for $20 more, but they were in fact essentially
    the same fonts.\r\n\r\nTo my eye, the digital version of ITC Baskeville looks
    very similar to the older photocomp version, perhaps the x-height has grown a
    touch larger. But it has been used for extended text for years, by many award-wining
    designers such as Rich Hendel, Richard Eckersley, etc. A different generation,
    I know.\r\n\r\nMonotype Baskerville, in digital form, is as the wiki says. The
    letterforms were never adjusted for the difference in ink spread between letterpress
    printing and offset printing, and this is exacerbated with direct-to-plate offset
    printing.\r\n\r\nThe Berthold Baskerville doesn't have the character weight problem
    of Monotype -- and to a smaller extent, ITC -- but to my eye, somehow lost the
    quality of \"Baskerville.\" I haven't used the Storm version, so can't say anything.\r\n\r\nMy
    main gripe with the wiki is that it gives the impression the \"New Baskerville\"
    is unsuitable for book-length text. While not one of my favorites & while it does
    have some weaknesses, it has been successfully used for years, in both photocomp
    & digital forms."
