  body: "David, Skeleton (font listed as C4 above) was my initial guess as well. But
    since I don't have specimens for lead fonts, the closest one I could compare was
    \"Skeleton Antique\", from the book American Wood Type:1828-1900. Please notice
    the slight changes. It is possible that the font was re-designed as it was converted
    to lead-type.\r\n\r\nSkeleton Antique. By William Page in his 1865 specimens.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Skeleton_Antique_6141.jpg]"

  body: "No lowercase for A6, but someone on another forum suggested Franklin Gothic.
    <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/ortizlopez/olfranklin/wide-regular/?s=abcdefghijklm&case=upper\"
    target=\"_blank\">This extended digital version</a> is pretty darn close, but
    there's no extended style in my copy of the ATF \"Big Red\" of 1912.\r\n\r\nSuggestion
    for B7: ATF New Caslon Italic, but the \"C\" isn't right.\r\n\r\nC4 is definitely
    a \"Skeleton,\" but I can't find the \"Modern\" variety that David mentioned (only
    \"Skeleton Antique,\" which isn't quite it).\r\n\r\nBB has been identified as
    Dietz Text (which I've finally finished cleaning and sorting)."

    don't mind, can you email me a PDF of the full character set and any info you
    have on the type & designer?"
