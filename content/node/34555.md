    \ :-)\r\n\r\nJosh, pixelfonts are outline fonts that render out specific bitmaps
    when used at a specific point size (pseudo-standardly 8). FontLab can make them.
    FontLab can't make \"true\" bitmap fonts - that's what BitFonter is for. True
    bitmap fonts are harder to deliver, not least because OSX ignores them...\r\n\r\nNote
    that good ol' Fontographer used to be able to make both pixelfonts and true bitmap
    fonts, altough its latter ability might have been removed now that FontLab owns
    it... Can anybody confirm/deny this?\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
