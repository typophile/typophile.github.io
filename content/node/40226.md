body: "I have two fonts I can't quite identify, and both have several that come close
  but aren't it. For instance, the one attached isn't Scythe or Chesterfield or Trifles
  Regular (I think). I would appreciate if someone could tell me which one it really
  is, just for curiosity's sake.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd then there's an Art Deco-like font
  that looks a bit like most Art Deco typefaces but isn't any of them that I've checked:
  the header font at the top <a href=\"http://tealight-rookie.livejournal.com/\">here</a>.\r\n\r\nThanks
  for any help! :)"

  body: Your first typeface was originally known a Truffles. See <em><a href="http://www.myfonts.com/WhatTheFont/forum/viewthread.php?threadid=97422"
    target="_blank">here</a></em>. I know of no other digital version than the Duffy
    that Philippe mentions in that MyFonts forum post. If you manage to find a copy,
    though, it has all of the characters that are in your image plus several of the
    original alternates.

  body: "elfee,\r\n\r\nMy name is Judy Pearsall and I designed the typeface you're
    asking about.  It is definitely Truffles.  I designed it in college, in 1984,
    and it was bought by Chartpak, the dry transfer-lettering people.  Where did you
    get the copy you posted?  To my knowledge, it is not a computer font.  If it is,
    I like to know about it.\r\n\r\nCan anyone tell me where I can get the computer
    version?\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\n\r\nJudy"
