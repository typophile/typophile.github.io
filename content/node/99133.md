  \ \"The Elements of Typographic Style\". I am curious to find out what family of

    don't have a copy of whatever it is you have. I happen to have a copy, but have
    no idea whether it's the same edition, or the same printing, or whether the hardback,
    or its dust jacket and the paperback versions are the same.\r\n\r\n[Just giving
    you a hard time!] MY copy, which is the paperback edition, Version 3.1, published
    by Hartley and Marks, printed by C&C in Hong Kong, appears to have the book title
    in some version of [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/alcuin-lt/light/|ALCUIN]]
    or Alcuin Light.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Bringhurst_3954.jpg]\r\nIt's
    surprising that the colophon doesn't include the book cover information.\r\n -

    body: "@hrant: Bringhurst calls Alcuin \"admirable\" in his first reference, where
      he's suggesting fonts designed by women (in this case, Gudrun Zapf-von Hesse).
      He later decribes it as \"a strong and graceful Carolingian face\". So I doubt
      that Bringhurst would find its use embarrassing. YMMV.\r\n\r\n - Herb"

  body: Thanks for the info. That is the same typeface as is on my edition, version
    3.2. the author's name is in the italic, I assume?
