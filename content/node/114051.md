  to order a new stamp, but only bigger. Unfortunately we don\xB4t know the font that
  was used for it.\r\n\r\nThe shop that made the stamp for us does not exist anymore.\r\n\r\nIt
  shows the following information:\r\n\r\nJPX\r\n2125\r\n\r\n\r\nThank you very much

  body: "Thanks for your help.\r\n\r\nI guess the stamp should be 6 or 7 years old.\r\nIt
    is currently in a shop that tries to figure out to copy it, but can\xB4t find
    out which font is used.\r\nThat\xB4s why I was hoping to get help here.\r\n\r\nWe
    are using it as security stamp for our products and our staff is used to the look
    of the stamp when checking the products so that we want the exact same font.\r\n\r\nI
    tried Helvetica Narrow, but it seem that it is not the font.\r\n\r\n"

  body: "The quality & resolution of the picture is good enough. \r\nWhat I was asking
    is a photo of another physical sample i.e. if you have the old stamp you could
    try to make a new sample by laying out the stamp carefully on a smooth white paper
    to show us as many details as possible.\r\nIf this is your only sample, then we
    can only make general assumptions and Helvetica Narrow still looks good enough
    for me.\r\nTake also into account that if the stamp is \u03C4\u03BF\u03BF old
    [i.e. 10, 15, 20 years] the technology used to create it could vary and the fonts
    used (which were proprietary at some point back in time) may not correspond to
    any modern digital font."
