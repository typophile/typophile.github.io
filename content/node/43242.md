body: "Hi all,\r\n\r\nMy question is: what OT tag to use, when creating alternate
  numbers? I mean, I guess I can use Old Style Figures (although I don't know it's
  abbreviation, but some reading probably will help), but I'm not sure if it's correct.
  The font in question is the New Deco I was talking about previously, and it will
  consist of filled glyphs as well as stenciled ones, that's why I need to define
  the alternate numbers. Any help will be appreciated and I really hope you guys understand
  what I mean.\r\n\r\nThank you."

  body: "If the alternatives are *not* Oldstyle Figures, Tabular Figures, ... but
    merely stylistic variations of the original figures, I would assign them to a
    stylistic set (SS01 to SS20).\r\n\r\nIf you assign them to a tag a user would
    expect something different, you \"dissappoint\" him if he chooses the feature
    and does not get what he wanted, but something different you placed there due
    to lack of an other feature which could be more fitting."

  body: "Thank you for your help. The problem that occurs is that I named those alternate
    numbers as follows:\r\n\r\none.ss01\r\ntwo.ss01\r\nthree.ss01\r\n\r\nand so on\r\n\r\nthe
    ss01 feature looks like this:\r\n\r\n\r\nfeature ss01{\r\n  sub one by one.ss01;\r\n
    \ sub two by two.ss01;\r\n  sub three by three.ss01;\r\n  sub four by four.ss01;\r\n
    \ sub five by five.ss01;\r\n  sub six by six.ss01;\r\n  sub seven by seven.ss01;\r\n
    \ sub eight by eight.ss01;\r\n  sub nine by nine.ss01;\r\n} ss01;\r\n\r\nBut I
    keep on getting this message:\r\n\r\nERROR: There was a problem while compiling
    OpenType font. Final .otf font is not saved. Please, check OpenType features definition
    for errors\r\n\r\nWhat's wrong?"

  body: "No, it's not a space problem. Save your features from the OpenType panel
    into a .fea file, open it in the text editor, clean up any empty lines, and open
    it back in the OpenType panel. \r\n\r\nAlso, I'd recommend doing it as follows:
    \r\n\r\n<code>feature ss01 {\r\nlookup ss01digits {\r\nsub [one two three four
    five six seven eight nine zero] by [one.ss01 two.ss01 three.ss01 four.ss01 five.ss01
    six.ss01 seven.ss01 eight.ss01 nine.ss01 zero.ss01];\r\n} ss01digits;\r\n} ss01;</code>\r\n\r\n<code>feature
    salt {\r\nlookup ss01digits;\r\n} salt;</code>\r\n\r\nIn other words, if your
    font has a ss01 feature, it should also have a salt feature because different
    apps expose different features (e.g. InDesign has ss01 but no salt while Illustrator
    has no ss01 but it has salt). \r\n\r\nAdam"
