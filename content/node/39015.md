body: "I'm setting a christmas card with greetings in 6 languages, and I'd like some
  help with the russian (I pressume it's russian). The attached screenshot shows the
  text as I've copied it verbatim from a faxed manuscript. The manuscript looks a
  bit amateurish, so I want to make sure that the Cyrillic text is correct.\r\n\r\n[[http://typophile.com/files/Billede

    not every beginning of a word is uppercased. So use uppercase only for the \"\u0421\"."

    We just talk here in this way.\r\n\r\nAnd there is no matter about uppercasing.
    Cause it depends on final text style, using in your greeting card.\r\n\r\nAnd

    Andreas, there is no Cyrillic language.\r\n\r\nOne serious\u2014<em>typographic</em>\u2014problem
    with your <a href=\"http://typophile.com/files/Billede%203.png\">test setting</a>
    is that the <em>Russian</em> version is set in upper and lower case, except the
    <strong>\u0416</strong>, whereas the caps-and-small-caps style is used in other
    language versions\u2026\r\n\r\nYour French is misspelled. It should spell <em>Meilleurs
