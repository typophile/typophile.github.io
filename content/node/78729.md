  any doc/file/video of someone talking about that?\r\n\r\nMany thanks,\r\nNuno"

  body: I'd be interested in this too. Great examples (or examples which we should
    hold as great) of different languages written with the same family of typefaces,
    that is.

  body: "Thanks for the plug Riccardo.\r\n\r\nThis is a very complex issue, and many
    people disagree even on the basics. The good news is that the dark ages of blind
    Latinization seem to be winding down (although we'll surely be encumbered by legacy
    junk for a while) and most people are now observing and thinking instead of trusting
    some hermetic sense of design formalism (which can result in the dysfunctional
    grafting of full serifs on a non-Latin script for example).\r\n\r\nI have an article
    entitled \"Latinization: Prevention and Cure\" which was published in a couple
    of places (with a third coming up later this year) - it might be useful to you.
    I can also suggest you look at my Nour&Patria system which covers Armenian and
    Latin (and is the first ever \"multilateral\" multi-script typeface family) -
    here's a spread from a magazine that shows it:\r\nhttp://themicrofoundry.com/ad/CR.pdf\r\n\r\nBut
    most of all: we should all just keep talking.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
