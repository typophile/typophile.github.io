  is now <a href=\"http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/djr/manicotti/\">available for licensing
  on MyFonts</a>. It was honored by the Type Directors Club in 2007, and since then
  I've expanded it to include lowercase, unicase, more swash variants, and ornaments.
  Manicotti was a whole lot of fun to draw, so I'm hoping that it is equally fun to
  use!\r\n\r\nWarmly, David\r\n\r\nhttp://www.djr.com/typefaces/manicotti\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/djr/manicotti\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/manicotti_590_1_5624.png]\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Thanks to both of you! \r\n\r\nNina, glad to see you found the manicules
    and unicase. Don't forget about the contextual alternates and discretionary ligs
    as well, if you really want to go over the top...\r\n\r\n<em>> Hey, now we can
    all have business cards like you!</em>\r\n\r\nIf you like to see a wide variety
    of looks on people's faces when you hand them your business card, then by all
    means set the whole thing in this font!"

    quality drawings are more important than just banging out a font. Great work!"

  body: It's funny how this style, invented in England in the 1860s (as a moderation
    of the completely bizarre "Italian"?), has come to signify the American Wild West.

    of New York or Boston, created by Scot, German, and English immigrants, all on
    the covers of books about cowboys. I think it probably has something to do with
    the American Wild West being largely mythical to begin with."

  body: "Many thanks to all of you guys for your kind words about Manicotti.\r\n\r\nI
    agree that it's funny, and at the same time a little sad, that this style has
    been pigeonholed to the extent that it has. While Manicotti doesn't follow the
    old French Clarendons very closely, it does take almost every opportunity to play
    into that faux-Western stereotype.\r\n\r\nThis is the exactly the kind of thinking
    that encouraged me to return to this style and draw <a href=\"http://www.fontbureau.com/fonts/trilby/\">Trilby</a>.
    Among other things, it was an attempt to cast off some of the long-held associations
    of reversed-stress slabs."
