<p>When I am reading a book in the Kindle app, iBooks, Google Books app, etc. I often wish it would scroll like a web page. One thing I like about the scrolling model is that I can keep the text I&rsquo;m reading in the upper part of the screen, especially when I am lying on my back with the device propped up on my chest.</p>
<p>Nick: The location/memory thing doesn&rsquo;t work that well with book readers. If you can change the font size, it completely changes the way the text breaks from page to page. (It does work for PDFs.)</p>
<p>I would prefer some sort of scrolling model for electronic books. Perhaps there could be virtual page numbers along the side to help with orientation. Maybe paragraph numbers. I could also see sideways scrolling used to go to the next chapter. Running headers could be fixed at the top, again to help with orientation.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>One problem related to paging that&rsquo;s really huge is citing the source in academic papers. (christopher should be familiar with this one.)
My wife is in both a PHD program and a post-grad nurse practitioners program and the problem occurred early on: if you&rsquo;ve bought the ebook version of a text, how do you refer to the page number(s)? Also, in order to keep the dollars flowing, academic publishers play a page number and chaptering game - they keep coming out with new editions that add and subtract a bit of content here and there solely to change the page numbers. That way, instructors and students have to keep buying the latest editions just to keep things straight. If you don&rsquo;t, you might just end up reading the wrong pages for next week&rsquo;s assignment, and that&rsquo;s not cool.</p>
<p>So, for a number of reasons, she gave up and stuck with the p-books. Thankfully, the web has also given us an easy way to resell via ebay and craigslist. And those books that can&rsquo;t be resold I just lift a few times a day to maintain muscle tone and build strong biceps. (The size of some of these medical books is just beyond belief.)</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m wondering if any of the proposed standards deal with these page numbering issues?
(Kindle does have location numbers I believe, which do remain fixed even when font size repaginates, like Mark mentioned. Sold my Kindle so I can&rsquo;t double check. Anybody?)</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Now that PDF is an open standard, electronic publications can go two directions: push HTML/CSS in the direction of PDF, or push PDF in the direction of HTML/CSS.</p>
<p>The web standardistas have had 15 years to make the case for HTML/CSS as the foundation. They have not made the case. Web development is still an infuriating process of debugging 15 platforms simultaneously (namely, the individual web browsers). Apparently &ldquo;standards&rdquo; are not as standard as they look. And seemingly simple tasks are still impossible: try putting two page elements in a web page side-by-side, or in adjacent columns. Ugh. Why is this so complicated?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because we want the web to be based on open standards.&rdquo; Great, but open standards aren&rsquo;t much use if they overly limit what creators can do with them. For instance, the idea of semantic markup is nice, but as a publisher, it&rsquo;s not always what you need. Sometimes you need to say &ldquo;THIS THING goes THERE and THAT&rsquo;S THAT.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Worse, though the standardistas have always claimed the high ground — &ldquo;our way is better because no one company can hijack the standards process&rdquo; — that process has still been repeatedly hijacked. For instance, the canvas element. That was something invented by Apple so its developers could avoid Flash, while ignoring the existing open standard for vector drawing, SVG. And then it somehow got shoehorned into HTML5.</p>
<p>As for ebooks in particular, the situation is even worse, because ebooks are built on a rudimentary subset of HTML/CSS. [[http://fontsinuse.com/typography-for-lawyers/|As I&rsquo;ve said elsewhere]], today&rsquo;s ebooks are at the sophistication level of a website circa 1993.</p>
<p>Respectfully to Håkon Lie et al., I&rsquo;m not sure that electronic publishing needs another round of turd-polishing, i.e. taking HTML/CSS standards that are woefully inadequate and making them slightly less inadequate. That sort of plodding incrementalism has defined the last 15 years. I shudder to think of plodding along the same way for another 15 years.</p>
<p>Turning to PDF. Publishers who went onto the ipad with PDF versions of their publications were pilloried for being Luddites and idiots. But here&rsquo;s the thing. New York Magazine in PDF is a much more satisfying reading experience than the New York Times app, which freezes every time it shows an ad. Though at least the NYT makes an effort — most of these news / magazine apps are a joke. Meanwhile, PDF works because a) it requires zero compromise and b) it&rsquo;s intrinsically low-tech. After all, why is it we want companies like the New York Times to be in the app-building business? To annoy us?</p>
<p>How about we let print companies do what they do best — make print publications? I mean, the iPad and similar devices are at their best when they&rsquo;re playing content made for other media — music, TV, movies. Why not just let print media be what it is, rather than forcing it to be what it isn&rsquo;t? PDF captures this reality. Martin Scorsese did not have to develop an iPad app so you could watch his movies on the iPad.</p>
<p>PDF has many virtues. I, for one, would like to see more effort go toward making PDF a more interesting and capable publishing format, instead of primary attention going toward HTML/CSS. PDF is far from perfect, but in its current state, it&rsquo;s a lot closer to the ideal publishing platform than HTML/CSS. That&rsquo;s not an argument for abandoning HTML/CSS. It&rsquo;s an argument for recognizing that just as digital music and digital video have their own specialized file formats, digital publishing also deserves a specialized file format.</p>

<p>Just to clarify for you, instructors don&rsquo;t buy texts. Nor do their schools. Publishers flood us with textbooks in the hopes that we might adopt them for a course. If we do, they sell dozens to hundreds of copies.</p>

<p>That is only if you approach those 15 platforms each as an instance of fixed media.</p>
<p>Fixed Media versus Laxed Media.  If one simply takes the stick out of one&rsquo;s behind and accepts that onscreen, the designer has very limited control, that the designer has partners: the device manufacturer, the user, and who knows who else, then all is well. Learning to hang loose is hard.</p>
<p>PDF is still geared, totally, to fixed media, any way you slice it. But for that, it has a firm place.</p>
<p>Removing the stick is very, very difficult.
We are all, because of when we were born - trained to think fixed. Trained to think, &ldquo;What is the size of the space I need to fill?&rdquo;
But what if you don&rsquo;t know? How do you design for a size unknown?
To me, trading that certainty for the ability to publish at least my words, instantly to the entire world, is more than fair.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t have the tools and concepts yet. I watch my five-year old grandson use the iPhone, iPod, and iPad - it&rsquo;s amazing to watch - he might be of the generation that &ldquo;gets it&rdquo; naturally. A change in the Zeitgeist is required.</p>
<p>If you are deeming the standards movement a failure because we do not have absolute uniformity of implementation after only fifteen years of the web&rsquo;s existence, well, I say that in the light of history, fifteen years is nothin' considering the task and also that your measure of success is faulty.

		<div class="commentbody"><p>As a print designer I tend to agree with Darell (Aluminum). If a client approaches us for a &ldquo;digital&rdquo; version, there is nothing simpler than to tell him &ldquo;well you already got a PDF&rdquo;. On request, I can even pimp it up with bookmarks and the occasional hyperlink.</p>
<p><em>However</em>, even fancy hyperlinking does not intrinsically <em>add</em> to the user experience; or, indeed, make any publication move &ldquo;up&rdquo; to a fully qualified e-publication. For that, we rebuild the document from scratch into The Best We Can Offer in HTML3. For the odd novel or something like that, the results are &hellip; adequate. But any serious publication, including tables and illustrations, HTML3 as displayed in iBooks on the iPad (to name the one platform I am acquainted with), is not good enough.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t care for page-flipping. What I <em>need</em> is more typesetting control: proper hyphenation, justification the way I want (the iPad seems to object), Keep With Next and Keep Paragraphs Together options for headings, figures which automatically float to the top or bottom of a page. And it goes without saying, I do like reader friendly options such as adjustable Font and Font Size. Hell, if I&rsquo;d object to that I&rsquo;d might as well stick to PDFs.</p>
<p>What the industry needs is nothing like &ldquo;more HTML controls&rdquo;, or &ldquo;better CSS support for print-type media&rdquo;. What the industry needs to see is that an eBook reader is .. not a web page and neither a 1-to-1 translation of printed pages. It needs a new Reading paradigm. Something in between.</p>

<p>During the endless previews of the Spider-Man musical in NYC, a reporter asked director Julie Taymor &ldquo;what do you think of people who say you&rsquo;re controlling?&rdquo; Her response was along the lines of &ldquo;I&rsquo;m a director. That&rsquo;s WHAT I DO — control things.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Absolutely right: Stage directors control things. TV writers control things. Novelists control things. And designers control things. Control is good. Control is what we like about the movies, musicals, TV shows, books, etc. that these people create.</p>
<p>In this case, the control — the &ldquo;stick in the behind&rdquo; that you refer to — is the tradition of print typography. And you know what? I like that tradition. I imagine we all do. And if &ldquo;removing the stick,&rdquo; as you say, had led to a new approach to the design of electronic publications, I&rsquo;d be all for it.</p>
<p>But it hasn&rsquo;t. Mostly what it&rsquo;s led to is a state of no control, a state of non-design. If the ebooks that I got from Amazon looked like the ones I saw in Harry Potter, I&rsquo;d say great — no reason to worry. But they don&rsquo;t. They stink. Whereas the PDFs I get from O&rsquo;Reilly? They look great. They look like books. They read like books. Sure, I wish they had better functionality. But they&rsquo;re a lot closer to the mark.</p>
<p><cite>If you are deeming the standards movement a failure because we do not have absolute uniformity of implementation after only fifteen years of the web&rsquo;s existence</cite></p>
<p>I deem the standards movement a failure at honoring the skill set of graphic designers and typographers everywhere, and thereby failing to preserve an important part of the pleasure of reading. Typography is getting washed away by the tide of declining expectations.</p>
<p>Or, if you disagree, what other conclusion should I draw from the available evidence? For instance, webfonts. I mean — where are they? I don&rsquo;t see them on any major websites. I don&rsquo;t even see them on Typophile.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not looking to pick a fight with you in particular Richard. I just think that at some point, the HTML/CSS standards crowd has to be held to account. No, I don&rsquo;t think 15 years is too soon.</p>

<p>The best explanation of the difference between print and web design I ever heard:</p>
<p>Print design is about dictating the solution.
Web design is about suggesting the solution.</p>
<p>As a graphic designer, I love great design on paper. Books are amazing.</p>
<p>As a consumer, I love the flexibility I have in how I consume content online and on my iPad.</p>
<p>Sometimes that&rsquo;s a conflict of interests, admittedly. ;)</p>
<p>&ldquo;For instance, webfonts. I mean — where are they?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Infinitely further along than they were 15 years ago.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>@butterick - The best web design can do is suggest the solution, anyway. There are too many variables to consider, plus there is no way to tell beforehand what the next site user is running. FF6 half-width on 1600×900 screen? IE6 fullwidth on a 1024×768 screen? Android phone? Opera on a 300dpi prototype bilevel screen?</p>
<p>Oh, I like control – as long as that control is <strong>MINE!</strong></p>
