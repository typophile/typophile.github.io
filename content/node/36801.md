body: "Hi all. We all know that apple developers use Lucida Grande and Myriad Pro
  for most OS X  apps, but how come, when I try to create some photoshop mock-ups
  of the next version of my client's app, I get no results? I'm looking at the application
  Checkout, developed by the company Sofa, and getting nowhere trying to match their
  fonts.\r\n\r\nI'd love to know what these are:\r\n[[http://www.easylowdown.com/checkout1.png]]\r\n[[http://www.easylowdown.com/checkout2.png]]\r\n[[http://www.easylowdown.com/checkout3.png]]"

  body: "The rendering difference between the system and photoshop is staggering.
    I've created some examples. Check it out:\r\n\r\n(this one is the closest actually,
    but still, far from acceptable)\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/checkout1_6448.png]\r\nYuck.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/checkout2_4970.png]\r\nWhere's
    that juicy, friendly Lucida Grande Bold we all know and love?\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/checkout3_6136.png]\r\n\r\n\r\nDoes
    anyone know of a solution to bridge the font rendering gap? I'm quite new to application
    development. How are people using fonts to create buttons and other static UI
    elements?"

  body: "Did you try the different anti-aliased rendering modes in photoshop? That
    might make a difference.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/anti-aliasing_5590.jpg]\r\nAbove
    are two examples of rendering Lucida Grande at 24 pt. two different ways."

  body: Yeah, I had been mucking about with the anti-aliasing modes. Maybe I need
    a different version of Lucida Grande. My 'smooth' version doesn't come out nearly
    as juicy as yours. Thought that seems ridiculous, considering it is a standard
    system font... Thanks for your help. I'll return if I find a way pump up my Lucida
    Grande!

  body: The text color also matters. To get a <em>juicy</em> result make sure to set
    the color to R-0,G-0,B-0, (pitchblack).
