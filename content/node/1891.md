body: I&#39;m looking for a font for a technology company <BR>&#40;logo and text&#41;.
  I love FF Dax but it seems to be coming into overused and the narrowing of the stroke
  at intersections makes large letters look more like a font for commercial shops.  <BR>I
  really want to keep the stemless &#34;m&#34; and &#34;n&#34; as well as the general
  open shape of the &#34;a&#34;. So far, I&#39;ve only found two fonts that have the
  same feel as Dax. Marten and Modula. The first one isn&#39;t very readable &#40;rounded
  endings&#41; and the second one is polluted by extra stems everywhere. <BR>Any suggestions
  for something like FF Dax? <BR>Thanks. <BR> <BR>Here&#39;s a sample of Dax by the
  way. <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/19563.gif" alt="FF

    a copycat of Reichel&#39;s Sari. <BR>Prokyon, I didn&#39;t know about that one.
    It&#39;s the closest to what I want so far. Yes, pretty expensive. I&#39;m looking
    at the PDF right now. It doesn&#39;t seem to flow as well as Dax in text. Maybe
    it&#39;s a spacing issue. I&#39;m no font expert. What&#39;s the deal with the

  body: My point about the Bauhaus-style fonts is that even though many of the samples
    in the Guide are modern fonts, their simplified geometric forms owe very much
    to the styles of Herbert Bayer and his stylistic movement. Sans serif styles were
    already a measure of simplification over serif fonts, and the Bauhaus-style carries
    it further by reducing many of the forms to as simple a shape as possible. Bayer
    even wanted to reduce the alphabet to <a href="http://bowfinprintworks.com/BauhausFaces7.html"
    target="_blank">uncials</a> to simplify it to its limit, I guess. The arc-shaped
    &#39;n&#39; in so many of these styles is one of the earmarks to me, but the stemless
    &#39;n&#39; &#40;as in Dax and Bernhard Gothic&#41; is a stylistic compromise
    to retain a bit more of the familiar form. The &#40;to me&#41; grotesquely ugly
    square &#39;tech&#39; look takes this simplification to the direction of avoiding
    curved lines, and I think begins to lose contact with anything human &#40;hence
    the &#39;tech&#39; label&#41;. You can have it, if it means draining all the life
    out of the letters. Cunieform letters also avoided curves, but for a reason related
    to the medium &#40;clay&#41; and the writing tool &#40;stylus&#41; that makes
    much more human sense than today&#39;s computer-drawn squares. Sure, LCD technology
    &#40;and it&#39;s predecessors&#41; depended on straight line segments to render
    alphanumeric characters, but that is now 20-30 years old. How does a style derived
    from that look become symbolic of &#39;high tech&#39;? And while I&#39;m ranting,
    how about the fact that &#39;Eurostile/Microgramma&#39;, which is apparently the
    epitome of the Tech-Look, is over 40 years old!

  body: Thanks Mike, I have had your bauhaus page booked marked for some time now.
    It&#39;s nice to see you pop up like that. You actually identified Marten for
    me a few months ago. <BR> <BR>I think that the context has changed enormously
    these past 10 years for so called tech fonts. They seem to have been appropriated
    by the youth scene in particular &#40;rave, clubs, parties, dj events, sci-fi
    tv and movies, etc&#41;. <BR>The more established ones like Eurostile and Handel
    are now widely seen in shops everywhere &#40;even my laudraumat uses Eurostile
    for signage&#41;. <BR> <BR>Parallel to that, the real high tech field has changed
    dramatically during the same period. The desired image of dynamic, young, fun,
    and hip from the 90&#39;s &#40;Yahoo, Amazon, eBay, Marimba, ...&#41; has now
    been changed back to the more conservative image of serious &#40;restrained&#41;,
    professional and efficient.  <BR> <BR>In that context, I think that its now very
    tricky to use a &#34;tech&#34; font for a tech company. Bauhaus lines &#40;stemlessness
    for one&#41; conveys efficiency and modernism to me. The tech side must still
    be present as a somewhat &#34;square&#34; look, although it must be much more
    subtle than before. Most important though, the conservative, professional but
    forward looking image must comes from a well balance &#40;humanist?&#41; body
    type font with clean lines &#40;sans-serif&#41;. <BR>These are the parameters
    I&#39;m trying to play with. <BR> <BR>For reference, I&#39;ve played with latest
    suggestions. Here we go... <BR> <BR>Infinity, Armada and Prosper are too squarish.
    They could easily be used for rave ads. <BR>Infinity <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/19647.gif"
