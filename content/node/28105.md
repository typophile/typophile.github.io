  of Fournier? I remember trying to sell him on doing this in two conversations some
  time ago, so I'm delighted to see he bit. Though there are lots of subtle differences
  versus Monotype Fournier, as there would have to be (including his tail on the cap
  Q that just isn't salacious enough!), nevertheless the Fournier feel and overall
  look are there. I do wonder, however, whether Josh considered incorporating the
  Tall Caps--in Monotype you had a choice of two kinds of caps, and I remember when
  Penguin Books used Fournier, it was always with Tall Caps, a type choice I grew
  up quite fascinated by...\r\n\r\nhttp://www.joshuadarden.com/shop/corundumtext.php"

  body: I've been waiting for a digital "re-creation" of Fournier for some time and
    what little I've seen of Corundum I like a lot. Incidentally, I seem to recall
    that the tall capitals were part of Monotype's original hot metal version, and
    it was Francis Meynell of the Nonesuch Press who asked them for a version with
    shorter capitals.

  body: "It's an attractive font but I don't think I'd use it as a substitute for
    Fournier. It's heavier for one thing, and the italics lack the character of Fournier's
    - they are tighter, have a higher x-height, and are at less of a slant. Fournier's
    italics are much of why I use it, they are so beautiful and distinctive. \r\n\r\nBut
    it does look quite complete (altho where are the fractions???), and looks solve
    the HUGE Fournier caps/smallcaps problem."

  body: Joshua Darden's Corundum types are not based on Monotype's Fournier typeface,
    but are based on Pierre-Simon Fournier's actual work. Joshua owns some Fournier
    specimens which he used as reference when developing Corundum.

    body: We know Josh went back to original source material to re-think the Fournier
      look...somebody had to at some point and Josh was the designer worth waiting
      for, it seems...If Monotype were smart, they would recognize the need and get
      someone really good to carefully complete the weights of their version, offering
      both tall and regular caps...we still get new type families released every month
      with no bold or bold italic...how many years before Hoefler finishes bold and
      bold italic for Requiem? Do they mind restricting their market so much on the
      initial release? Can't understand that...

  body: "the v and z are so gorgeous in the italic! makes me wish i had one or the
    other in my name! and the rest is just lovely and feels very historic, and i just
    wish there were swash caps for it. Fournier must have made swash caps, hadn't
    he? wasn't that always done in old type? but some of the ornaments are dodgy aren't
    they? i suppose the pointing hands and arrows could be quite useful but i can't
    think of a time when i'd have a need for a serpent man or a sun suffering from
    indigestion. \r\n\r\nif this is the Text can we reasonably expect there to be
    a headline version soon????"

  body: "<em>Do they mind restricting their market so much on the initial release?</em>\r\n\r\nBear
    in mind that retail is only part of their oeuvre, which is driven by custom work
    for periodicals. One tends to do what is requested by clients, and use that as
    a barometer of what is viable, therefore I suspect that no publication has commissioned
    them to fill out that particular family. H&FJ are no slackers in creating mega
    families, so they have certainly not absconded that responsibility. But in one
    sense it seems to me they are more interested, in their retail projects, in cutting
    new territory, in hybrid/niche formats such as the numbers fonts, the two-part
    fonts, and the graded fonts. So filling out families with the usual weights is
    not a priority. Perhaps, after H&FJ has bought Monolino, their production staff
    will be able to attend to such details.\r\n\r\nSorry, this is Josh's thread. What
    do I think? I'm impressed by the respect for the original design, and the Pi fonts
    are awesome! Thumbs up for the Age of Enlightenment."

  body: "Well perhaps not new (being couched in history), but unusual for a digital
    era foundry.\r\nSpeaking of Requiem, there is the banded version with a variety
    of ends. Not too many fonts with that feature.\r\nA suite of two-colour fonts?
    And not like the typical \"outline with fill\". What other foundries even have
    one offering like that? Well, some FontFonts. So perhaps not new territory, but
    a consolidation.\r\nNumbers? Again, a \"traditional sort\" kind of idea, but no
    other digital era foundry has, AFAIK, developed new design packages in this genre.\r\nAnd
    while the graded Mercury family may not be, strictly speaking, retail, it was
    developed for the news trade in general. That (grading) is an unusual idea, continuing
    the Poynter fonts idea. It's not the same as optical size, of course."
