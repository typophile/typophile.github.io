  body: I visited the web sites and looked for more key letters, but it seems not
    to be one of the Sans Serif fonts I have in my <a href="http://bowfinprintworks.com/SansIDPage.html"
    target="_blank">Guide</a>. It resembles <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/t26/flux/"
    target="_blank">T-26 Flux</a> and also their <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/t26/leger/"
    target="_blank">Leger</a>, but neither is exactly right. It also resembles DIN,
    but the stemless bowl on Telenor&#39;s &#39;b&#39; does not match. <BR> <BR>It
    seems to be a Sans I have not catalogued, so I&#39;m curious about it too.

  body: Look what happened while I was off hunting! Thanks Fabio. I guess that explains
    why I haven&#39;t collected it yet.
