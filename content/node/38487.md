    favourites, which works in most cases, are Scala and Nexus."

  body: I've just set a poetry book in [[http://www.underware.nl/site2/index.php3?id1=dolly&id2=overview|Dolly]]
    (and in 9 pts. too). It worked out really well.

  body: "I have yet to typeset a book, but I have read more than I can keep track
    of, and I have come to prefer books set in Adobe Garamond, Adobe Caslon, or Monotype
    Didot. That\u2019s right, Didot. I don\u2019t care how many books about type say
    that modern typefaces are inappropriate for running text, when the designers and
    printers do their jobs right, I can read it just fine."

  body: "Agreed. Selecting a book font is pointless unless the intended audience,
    book design, and subject matter are addressed first. For example, I love Utopia
    and ITC Garamond for a junior high school social studies text; for a scholarly
    article in a science journal though, not a chance.\r\n\r\nIf you don't care about
    such things, you could set your book in Fraktur and Caxton, that would be interesting....\r\n"

    say Baskerville.

  body: 'There IS such a thing as a best general typeface for book text. My picks
    are Sabon and Janson, always with oldstyle figures. You will NEVER go wrong with
    these two perennal winners, and it doesn''t matter what the subject is. Scala
    is surprisingly clear and beautiful and is beginning to turn up more and more
    in stylish books. And NuSwift with oldstyle figures is a very crisp choice, by
    no means over-exposed. Bitstream Arrus, also with oldstyle figures (available
    as a separate bundle), is also strong and not used much. My tastes run to fatter
    faces, which leaves out Minion, Quadraat, and Kepler, just a tad too condensed
    for me; Warnock is right on the verge of being too condensed also. Germans use
    Adobe Garamond a great deal, always with plenty of leading, and it always looks
    great--but at 11 pt. or larger. For any subject in the mid-19th century, use ITC
    Bodoni Twelve, so clear, stylish and subtle, really outstanding. Others worth
    checking out: Celeste, Aries, Zingha (fantastic!), Buccardi, ITC New Baskerville,
    Storm''s Regent II (very strong), Esta, Filosophia, Haarlemmer (as superb as Sabon),
    and Storm''s Walbaum Text. Requiem would be ideal but those morons never released
    it with bold or bold italic! Mrs. Eaves looks like crap with those absurd proportions:
    forget it! But Joshua Darden''s new Corundum is the next big thing: at long last,
    a re-think and completion of Fournier, which never had bold or bold italic...nice
    fat counters and overall a true classic! Just remember that oldstyle figures are
    an absolute must with books: when I see liner figures I just want to puke!   '

    heavy. And, oldstyle figures are standard. But...it may become over-exposed because
    every new system has it installed--you might want to consider that aspect. '
