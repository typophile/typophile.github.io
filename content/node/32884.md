body: "Hey Guys,\r\nI need a recommendation for a gorgeous numerals for a 25th Anniv
  card. The closest I could look into was the numerals from ITC's Bodoni 12 and Clarendon
  numerals but they just don't feel right with my Caslon's. \r\n\r\nI'm willing to
  pay for the entire typeface as long as it isn't too bad, but I want the 2 and the
  5 to really catch someones eyes (flourishes/swashes perhaps). The numerals 25 is
  the only thing visible on the front of the card so it needs to hold its own.\r\n\r\nOh
  yeah and it has to go with my Caslon's.\r\nhttp://prakashnair.com/ext/25.jpg\r\n\r\nThanks
  for the help."

    terminals</a>. Maybe one of those will do.
