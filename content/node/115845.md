    by David F. Nalle [1995, Scriptorium Fonts]\r\nalthough  there is also a font
    called <strong>Ferdinand</strong> digitized by Dan X. Solo.  [1998, Dover Publications]
    which looks like much better quality to me"

  body: "This a squeezed version of a typeface cut by Herman Ihlenburg in 1892 and
    sold by MacKellar Smiths and Jordan as Ferdinand. If you want a fairly good quality
    digital version it's included in the book by Dan X. Solo, _24 Victorian Display
    Fonts - CD-Rom and Book_ (Dover Electronic Display Fonts S.) Google didn't produce
    a link to the U.S. Amazon. Here is the U.K, Amazon http://www.amazon.co.uk/24-Victorian-Display-Fonts-Electronic/dp/0486999564
    Google also suggested some other U.S. sellers.\r\nDon"
