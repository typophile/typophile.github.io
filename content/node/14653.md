    in both cases.\r\n\r\nBut, seriously if you're looking to include the font or
    a derivative in your game (say for UI use) you'll need to work out licensing rights
    with the font owner. I've not seen a standard off-the-shelf EULA that allows distribution
    of fonts or derivatives with games. \r\n\r\nIf the font is going to be used to
    generate a static bitmap logo then almost any font will do - almost all EULAs
    allow you to make complete logos and redistribute them in bitmap form with products
    like games.\r\n\r\nMore info on the type of game may help us guide you towards
    some good font choices. Are you looking for fonts with rivets? \r\n\r\nCheers,
    Si\r\n"

    your needs for an identity and/or interface, without resorting to the destruction
    of something else, (not to say that this method doesn't work for some people).
    There are a lot of questions to be answered first in order to give a proper recommendation.
    What kind of game is it?*\r\nI have looked at a lot of new game promos recently,
    and much of what I have seen in the logos don't exactly fit a distorted, or even
    a grunged out aesthetic. Many of the darker games are using [[Blackletter]], and
    I see a lot of clean, sans serifs being used for war-based games and fantasy RPGs.
    I guess I just hate to see game design fall into such a generic style.\r\n\r\n*sorry,
    I missed the Wrestling part earlier"

    we had airbrush artists do the logos, often basing the designs on stuff in the
