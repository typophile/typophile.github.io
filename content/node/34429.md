  if anyone could identify this font for me:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/img_5913_6220.jpg]\r\n\r\nI
  know that it is very similar to, but not the same as, Berber (http://www.letterbox.net.au/store/order_fonts_berber.html).\r\n\r\nAlso,
  if this font can't be identified, can I go ahead and draw my own version? Or would
  there be copyright issues?\r\n\r\n\r\nMany thanks in advance,\r\n\r\nTom. "

    like my very first date all these years ago. :^P We usually don't bite people's
    heads off for asking questions, don't worry. ;^)\r\n\r\nThe letters on this shop
    front were obviously hand painted, but there are a number of digital typefaces
    that convey that same style and atmosphere."

      it would have at least been based on an exisitng font?\r\n\r\nThanks for the

    or H&FJ's Knockout.
