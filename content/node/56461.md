  I found this vid which seems cool about the basics of kerning classes and I follow
  it with my own font, building the exactly same sample he used in the vid (oTo, aTa,
  etc). It works quite well but when previewing the font (in the preview panel) or
  even building the font and testing in other software the kern didnt show ok -  It
  only works with the 'oTo' (the main of the class group). What i'm doing wrong here?\r\n\r\nThis
  is the video.\r\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UhDMmIJE-BQ\r\n\r\nThanks in advance"

    OpenType before exporting the font. The kerning classes section of the Fontlab
    manual covers this in reasonable detail.
