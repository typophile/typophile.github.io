body: I have performed a complete &#34;font doctor&#34; diagnosis/create new library
  on my font library, but my FFIL and LWFN fonts are still mixed in the same folder.
  Is there any way to batch process removing or at least identifying the True Type
  fonts so my library is completely PostScript? Any ideas welcomed, thanx

    window you will see that you can diagnose mixed font types. You can also have
    it remove the others to the trash. Once finished, if you want to keep those trashed
    fonts, simply put them in a folder named so you know what is in there. '

    formats! FFIL is a font suitcase, and LWFN is a LaserWriter font.
