Tiffany:

I have attached a PDF with some variations on the lowercase t. Which reads best to you?

I like your suggestion about keeping the font for personal use. It has actually been used once already in the new logo I created for the design firm I work for. I'll post a link when we unveil the new logo.


Mårten:

Originally my intention was to create a font with only squares and wedges. The challenge came when I came to the 3, 8 and &. I applied the hybrid shape to the w and W. I think that helps lighten them up some. I've attached a PDF - let me know what you think.

- What if you remove the gap in your ampersand? Does it need that space?
- What if the bottom facet on the question mark was moved to the right side instead?
- What if the bottom facet on the exclamation mark was also curved like the question mark?
- What if the bottom right facet on the lc_z was flopped?

Tiffany:

I removed the gap in the ampersand. In theory I would like for the shapes to be closer together, but I'm not sure that it reads better this way. Seeing both of them, do you think it needs a space?

Take a look at the question mark. Is this what you meant? I think it falls apart at this point.

I changed the bottom facet on the exclamation mark. I like it better. Strangely, it kind of looks like lipstick.

What do you think about the z? It's kind of interesting like this. Not sure it is as clear of a z.

Thanks for all of your comments.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Hey Everyone, 

Below are two lists. The first is a list of the changes I've made since ty_psychology_01.pdf and the second is a list of concerns that I still have with ty_psychology_04.pdf   Please give your thoughts on my concerns.

Changes Made: 

- flipped lowercase t across verticle axis
- flipped lowercase t's bottom right wedge across verticle axis
- added hybrid shape to W
- added hybrid shape to w
- narrowed the gap in &
- made the bottom facet of exlamation mark rounded

Remaining Concerns:

- Is the G too bulky?
- Does the K look top heavy?
- Is the T too wide?
- Is the W still too heavy?
- Does the X look top heavy?
- Should I add additional characters to the set? If so, which ones?

All changes and correction to now are improvements. I think. 

- z - crazy character either way. I prefer the latest version, but could see instances where the other might work better.

- ! - Love it.

- X - Is it upside down?

- G - Not bulky.

- K - Might be upside down too.

Ligatures? Crazy if it worked.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I've added a file entitled "ty_psychology_05.pdf"  I have added an extra row at the bottom of the file with ideas for changes:

• lowercase l - It would look the same as the uppercase I (eye) and number 1, but I thought it helped the flow and perhaps will make future ligatures easier

• uppercase K - It becomes top heavy instead of bottom heavy. I think it's an improvement

• three capital Xs - I'm leaning to the last of the three, as unusual as it looks

• fi ligature - I decided to attempt a ligature. I'm not sure what others would work

• star shape - Simply a decorative element that I thought looked interesting

		<div class="commentbody">I hadn't noticed the -l- being the same I guess that is the fun of these. I'm sure once you start making words you'll notice others things. 

- X - 4th glyph from the left, bottom row is working. 
- fi - crazy! 
- star - nice touch

The fun of this will be, like I just said, when you do go to use it. You'll be able to keep it modular and move bits around to work better within word shapes.

I've added the K, X, fi & star to the set. 

I still think the M and W may be too heavy. So, on the bottom row I have added an alternate M and an alternate W for you to check out.

What do you think?</div>

		<div class="commentbody">This is a funny design :) I like the idea, and it's very well done. I haven't looked at it before, so I can tell what doesn't work for me on first glimpse:

- H  (can't tell why, but I didn't recognise it)
- i: no dot? What about mirroring the upper part upwards (so there is a quarter circle with the round part on the lower left side)?
- j: like i?
- z: what if the upper left block was a square?

I think things like & and fi-lig work if they stand alone (i like the idea to do such things), but I don't believe that they will within words. And i fear that they would disturb the recognizability of the other letters, as there are "unknown" elements between them, making the viewer insecure about the rest.

I like the alternative W better, but I would stick with the old M.

The hybrid element is an excellent idea. And I specially like the "flaming" characters like E, F or N.</div>

- w - top version works best, but the letters that don't rely upon a mutated shape are preferable, right?

- W - second from top.
