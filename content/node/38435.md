body: "Good afternoon, my name is Teunis and this is my first post.\r\n\r\nI have
  been asked to submit an \"interactive\" PDF to a client. Basically, the client will
  personalize each PDF for a specific customer. The tests that I have run so far have
  not faired well. When using the advanced text tools and editing the copy this way
  the text is not wrapping properly and in the end the PDF looks terrible.\r\n\r\nI
  am wondering if there is a specific way to build my Quark file and/or export my
  .ps file so that this copy can be personalized and as editable as possible? Do I
  need to exempt this text box from the Quark file and build it directly in Acrobat
  Professional?\r\n\r\nThank you for your time and help. It is grealty appreciated.\r\n\r\n_teunis "

  body: You have to make the editable text fields in Acrobat Pro using Form-fields.
    You can make a 'background' in Quark, and then add the Form fields in Acrobat
    Pro after that.

  body: "Clauses, thank you for your response.\r\n\r\nI was just reading about Form
    Fields. I have not been able to figure out how to change the font from Arial to
    Frutiger, and change the font size. Is this possible?\r\n\r\n\r\n... I have now
    figured out how to edit my font. Still stuck on leading, justified and having
    two fonts in the same text field e.g. frutiger light and frutiger bold."

  body: There are embedding permissions issues here - you need to use fonts set to
    'editable' embedding which means Adobe originals and system fonts (I think).

  body: "When you first create a text field in Acrobat, you can only assign one font
    to the entire field. You can, however, set up the field to allow detailed editing
    of the field after it's been created:\r\n\r\n1. When you create or edit the text
    field in Acrobat and have the Text Field Properties dialog open, click the Options
    tab. Check the Allow Rich Text Formatting box.\r\n\r\n2. Now, when you're in either
    Acrobat or Reader, do one of two things:\r\n\r\nA. Type some text in the field
    and then, on the keyboard, press CTRL+e. You'll get a floating Form Field Text
    Properties toolbar. (Actually, you can press CTRL+e at any time, but the toolbar
    will be greyed out unless the cursor is in a text field with the Rich Text Formatting
    permission applied to it.) Select the text you want to modify and click the appropriate
    button on the toolbar (font, font color, point size, alignment, bold, italic,
    underline, strikeout, superscript, subscript). If you click More... and then Font,
    you get some of the same options, but if you click on Paragraph, you can adjust
    paragraph alignment, indents, and spacing (leading).\r\n\r\nB. To modify a blank
    field, simply put your cursor anywhere in the field and press CTRL+e. You get
    the same floating Form Field Text Properties toolbar.\r\n\r\n3. When selecting
    text in a field, you can select just the characters or words you want to modify."

    complex Word Templates would be better (and have them saved off as PDFs) for the
    people to use, IMHO. Definitely easier to maintain. Even better if they are Mac
    folks...give them Pages or something.\r\n\r\nEvery time I have to modify a PDF

    that the problem is the PDF format. The problem is that Acrobat Professional is
    one of the worst-designed pieces of publishing software on the market. Acrobat\u2019s
    interface is the stuff of nightmares at best, and the help system is terrible.
    I have never been able to understand why a company that has done so much for software
    design keeps releasing such a dreadful piece of software."

    fair, PDF as a rather static 'end of life' format for paper document archiving
    is fine. But the whole concept of 'interactive PDF' just seems both dated and
    pointless in this day and age. Combine that with the atrocity that is the Acrobat
    UI and it's just scary.\r\n\r\n*If* a custom front end were to be used (anything
    other than Acrobat...perhaps a web interface) then maybe. Otherwise, let them
    use software they know/understand, and have that save off the PDFs."
