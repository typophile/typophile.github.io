body: "I've been offered some work with a system called Pageflex, made by Bitstream.
  Has anyone any experience with this package, or any like it? I'm giving it some
  thought and wondered if anyone here is uses it or any similar systems (e.g. Quark
  Server). I'm trying to weigh up whether this system is likely to be in demand or
  if it will simply vanish whenever Adobe decide to incorporate it into InDesign.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.bitstream.com/publishing/\r\n\r\nAlso
  I'd also be interested to hear some opinions on how this kind of server technology
  impacts on font licencing. For example, a font is likely to only be installed on
  one computer but used by 100s of users to create documents via a web browser. In
  theory this will eventually lead to the end of large multi-user licences that companies
  must buy at the moment. Any idea how Bitstream licence their fonts for this?\r\n\r\nBy
  the way, for anyone who can't be bothered to read through Bitstream's rather dull
  webpage, Pageflex is a server based application whereby all layout files, images,
  EPSs and fonts are stored on the server and users are able to make low level changes
  themselves (edit text and images) via a web browser. It can be used for everything
  from mail merge type usage for letters and business cards at one end of the scale
  (which currently doesn't require multi-user licencing) to being used by whole marketing
  departments for the upkeep of corporate literature at the other (currently requiring
  a multi-user or site licence).\r\n\r\nAt the minute its looking like font companies
  are going to have to change from one-licence-per-CPU to one-licence-per-user licencing.\r\n\r\nAny
  thoughts?"

    terms for them, similar to what has happened with firms requiring a special license
    to embed fonts into PDFs.

  body: "I have been working with Pageflex for a few years now. The draw back to the
    system is it's price tag and the fact that you need to create a web application
    around it if you do not have PageFlex Storefront. Training from PageFlex is minimal
    and most companies that have even purchased Storefront do not know how to use
    it and end up shelving the software. So, most companies who have a license and
    have the knowledge on how to use it are setting up applications to offer a solution
    to other companies to be able to utilize the capabilitites PF offers without having
    to purchase their own licenses which can range $100,000 upwards once you add in
    the additional software and hardware needed for it. I have my own company and
    we have an online application which does just this. We can set up multiple Accounts
    with multiple users to be able to utilize the power of Pageflex for variable data
    and also manage documents, inventory items, Promotional items, PURLs, Landing
    Pages, etc. We have found that there are other types of softwares that do similar
    data merging but are more limited than PageFlex. One is XMPie and this works with
    Adobe's InDesign. \r\n\r\nAs companies have become more informed on variable data
    and marketing techniques utilizing more personalization the need for this type
    of a software has grown. Most companies realize now more than ever that consumers
    are getting harder to reach and that their messages need to stand out more to
    catch the attention of the consumer. Companies want control over their brand marketing
    and reduce costs. An application set up utilizing PageFlex gives companies an
    a way to control brand marketing, increase their ROI, and reduce costs, one template
    can service many users with text, images and even design aspects easily changed
    on the fly inaccordance to rules set up either based on user profiles or databases.\r\n\r\nI
    can't tell you much about how Bitstream manages the font licensing or how I think
    this will effect licensing. Fonts are stored on the Pageflex server which is Windows
    based. Fonts do need be be able to be embedded into PDFs since this is one of
    the print output formats. If you think about it, don't companies provide their
    fonts to vendors every time they package pieces for print now and wouldn't this
    effect licensing also?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    and only looked into it when your thread bumped it up to the top of the list.\r\n\r\nNice
    to know the rough price of the software ... I was looking through the brochures
    at bitstream, and was thinking this might be a nice tool to let users muck around
    and make changes to their project, without messing up the entire Quark or ID file.
    Of course, with that kind of price, this is not something the average business
    will buy for proofing work.\r\n\r\n> If you think about it, don\u2019t companies
    provide their fonts to vendors every time they package pieces for print now and
    wouldn\u2019t this effect licensing also?\r\n\r\nIf they do, they are violating
    the majority of foundary licenses."

    have you looked into InCopy for InDesign?  It lets users change their text without
    running amok as well.  I did a couple of projects with it, and liked not being
    bothered with \"replace this word with that word\" requests.  Unfortunately, they
    can still do some silliness that might not be wanted in the document.\r\n\r\nFrom
    my brief look at the Bitstream site, I can see similar pros and cons...."

  body: "Indeed.\r\n\r\nI think products like this can (and \"can\" is the operative
    word) be very useful in the right circumstance, but I'm not sure I'd recommend
    using InCopy as-is out of the box.  \r\n\r\nPart of that stems from the defaults,
    I think: my experience is that unless the InDesign person sets things up so that
    when the InCopy folks change files, they don't automatically update the InDesign
    one. I'd set them up to proof the InCopy files the same way I do with Track Changes
    in Word, so I can see what exactly they've done.  Would be nice if that was the
    default, but it isn't, and you need a fair bit of knowledge up front to do it.\r\n\r\n(Had
    one client that insisted on making style changes in a document that they weren't
    supposed to tinker with, and every time I got the file back from them, I had to
    reset the styles.  This went on for months....)"
