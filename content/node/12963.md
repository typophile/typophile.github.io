    This kind of poster would totally fit right in. Status Quo was the thing on that
    train. No noise permitted. After so many complaints to the conductors, a \"quiet
    car\" was set up. No children allowed in that car.\r\n\r\nThat must have gone
    over real well witha ll of the parents to took had to take their young children
    with them (wierd day care drop off hours, I suppose). But your average business
    person is not to be woken from his nap by a crying baby.\r\n\r\n__\r\nwww.typeoff.de"
