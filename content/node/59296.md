  body: Well, the good news is that I can ID your font. It's an old typeface called
    Olympian. The bad news is that the only digital version I know of is on the Dover/Dan
    Solo 24 Victorian Display Fonts CD and, for some reason, <a href="http://search.store.yahoo.net/cgi-bin/nsearch?catalog=doverpublications&query=24%20fonts"
    target="_blank">Dover</a> dropped it from its 24 Fonts offerings some time ago.
    You can find it on Amazon.com, but at greatly inflated prices due, no doubt, to
    its unavailability otherwise.
