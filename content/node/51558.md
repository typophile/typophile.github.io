  of both \"good and bad type\". He also told me that there was so much of Optima
  that it was like it was the Helvetica of Mexico!\r\n\r\nWhat do type specialists
  say about this? Is there any Mexican here to back this up? I'd really like to know
  more about this."

    for the Canadian vote, by using Optima in his campaign he was pandering to Mexican
    voters.   "

    to be 90 and to have people protesting the ubiquity of my work :)\r\n\r\nOptima
    is great, and more readable in text by far than Helvetica. Not that I want it
    everywhere, but rather it than Helvetica. "

  body: I agree with James, can't say I've ever noticed an Optima boom in Mexico.
    Might be one of those cases where once you beginnoticing something you find it
    everywhere :)

  body: "As a Mexican designer I have to accept Optima is abused in many logos in
    Mexico. I even used it (Zapf Humanist actually) in a graphic cleaning operation
    for a major bank. Not only Optima but Brody's Industria is very alive and used
    in open air markets in Mexico City. \r\n\r\nJames I wished hand painted black-letter
    was still used as often as you say. It is a fantastic hijack, with an unique personality.\r\n\r\nBut
    no, I have to say that Mexico's Helvetica is Helvetica (or was it comic sans?)"
