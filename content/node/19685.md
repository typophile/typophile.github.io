body: "For my Environmental Design class I revamped the wayfinding system for the
  Pennsylvannia Academy of the Fine Arts ( http://www.pafa.org ). These are pretty
  much final revised system boards from class, so more of just a showcase rather than
  a critique. I'll answer questions as I don't really know what else to explain other
  than I drew my ideas from the architecture of the building, the different arches
  and the patterns on the architecture. I did this system in 3 weeks so it wasn't
  comprehensive of the whole building but more of fixing problems and unifying the
  system as much as possible.\r\n"
