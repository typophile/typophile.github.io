  <BR> <BR>Is my new image OK? <BR>I try to make rune-styled inscription. However,
  as you know, runes don&#39;t use horizontal lines, but I can&#39;t avoid them. <BR>Any
  suggestions are welcome! <BR>Thanks. <BR>Tim <BR> <BR>P.S. I am from Ukraine.'

  body: looks good to me.  all i would say is that the second part, the four-letter
    word, seems more spaced out then the first word.  try pushing the letters a bit
    closer &#40;kerning&#41;, and spaced out visually even.  for example, the D seems
    farther from the Y then the Y to the R.

  body: it&#39;s not just moving one letter.  i mean take a step back and look at
    all the letters together.  the whole first word seems tighter-spaced than the
    second word.
