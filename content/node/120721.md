  2_6505.jpg] \r\n\r\nI visited Mission San Diego de Alcal\xE1, the first Catholic
  Franciscan mission in San Diego, California. Beside doorway entrances I noticed
  this beautiful calligraphic brush work. You can tell this was freshly painted within
  the past 10 years. Probably an old style that is recreated by a skilled painter
  every decade or so. I'm really curious if someone has recreated this in digital
  form. \r\n"

  body: "Don - Looking at more characters, it's clear that both are terribly made
    fonts (the Sam Wang TTF must be a conversion from his Mac original. I don't know
    how much error that introduces). Hard to say which is worse, though.\r\n\r\nFont
    validation yields 96 glyphs (all of them) with errors in Columbus. Validation
    of Beaumarchais yields 24 glyphs with errors - some with multiple errors and more
    serious errors than Columbus. That doesn't catch all of the straight lines where
    there should be curves - and both fonts suffer greatly from that.\r\n\r\nThrow
    in that both fonts stray far from the original and, yeah, I guess there's no reason
    not to go with the freebie."

    See my next post in this thread regarding quality."

    version is taking forever top see the light of day. It's tempting to simply go
    ahead and produce a clean version based on the old specimen books.\r\nDon"
