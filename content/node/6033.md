  body: '&#34;Sexta Feira&#34; looks like the long lost Blippo Bold. The only digital
    version I know of is called &#34;Graphics&#34;, from the Quick Brown Fox &#40;formerly
    B &amp; P Graphics&#41; <a href="http://www.qbf.de/dceng.htm">Designer Collection</a>.
    There may be other versions floating around, but I don&#39;t know about them.
    Most major foundries only have Blippo Black.'
