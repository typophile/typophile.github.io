  we ported over the forum discussions from the previous system we created a static
  (non-database driven, non-editable) version of the forums. Google's efficient bots
  have catalogued the forums and you can search them. \r\n\r\nWhen the new search
  is implemented (it's in testing now) all of the forums, wiki, blogs, news and content
  will be searchable.\r\n\r\nTo search with Google, type <em>site:Typophile.com your
  keyword</em> into the search field."

  body: "I've created a handy dandy little Favelet that you can add as a bookmark
    in your browser toolbar that gives you one-click access to a Google-powered Typophile
    search. I would post it here, but the Punchcut Brotherhood\u2122 have eliminated
    the ability to post any JavaScript snippets to the forums. (Smart move, maliciousware-wise
    actually.)\r\n\r\nThe Favelet can be nabbed from my weblog <a href=\"http://www.splorp.com/blog/archive/2005_05_01_archive.html#111578113043418502\"
    target=\"_blank\" title=\"Googophiling.\">here</a>.\r\n\r\nIt currently works
    in Safari and Firefox and should be fine for users of Internet Explorer as well."
