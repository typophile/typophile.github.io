  \ I'm working on my first commercial project, a small, animated film, incorporating
  fonts I found in Microsoft and Adobe fonts. \r\n\r\nThe film itself uses a lot of
  text with varying fonts in certain spots and if we were to sell t-shirts of the
  characters, it would have to include some of these fonts as they are a part of the
  characters.  It probably sounds stupid, but it makes sense in the context of the
  show.\r\n\r\nAnyway, the fonts will only be used in a film and printed format.  Maybe
  in a logo as well.  But never distributing fonts for use by other users, etc.\r\n\r\nI
  can't seem to get a straight answer if I can legally use these fonts without further
  licensing in this way.\r\n\r\nAny advice would be appreciated.  Thank you."

  body: Most font licenses would allow these uses. Check the EULA that came with them.
    If you are talking about fonts that came with Adobe or Microsoft products, I'm
    pretty sure you're fine.

  body: "Well that's the thing, I've looked through XP and Office EULA's and they
    don't explictly state your right to use with the fonts.  I don't think Word 2003
    even mentions fonts in the EULA, but 2007 gives a sentence that's really vague.\r\n\r\nI
    even asked a few questions to font licensing companies (and MS, but no response
    yet).  One company told me I needed to buy an additional license because the license
    I got for using MS fonts only applied to personal use.  Another said I was okay
    under MS's license and did not need further licensing unless I was sharing fonts,
    etc.  Which seems to be the real issue in font licensing from what I can tell.\r\n\r\nI
    did notice that the embedding license restrictions seems to kinda spell out usage,
    for exporting and so on.  I guess I'll have to go by that.\r\n\r\nI just want
    to play it straight, not violate anyone's rights, and compensate people where
    necessary.  You'd think MS and other companies would kinda spell things out a
    bit more...\r\n\r\nThe last thing I want to do is get my project finished after
    what seems like an eternity, start selling it, and end up with a lawsuit over
    something that can be so ambiguous. "

  body: "Si,\r\n\r\nI doubt Plastic Pencil consulted an attorney in this matter. That
    would cost money! But I'm pretty sure it will cost a bit of money to license the
    fonts for the usage described. The fact that the fonts are being used outside
    the normal use described by most EULA, makes me think this. Hey but I'm not a
    lawyer. When I have questions like this, I consult my attorney.\r\n\r\nI can say
    that if our fonts were used in this way, additional license fees would apply."

    not clear about this is after you view the permissions of the fonts in the MS
    viewer, what they really mean.  Even the most permissive use doesn't exactly spell
    out the full extent of the use permitted.  Also in Word 2003, there's much less
    in the EULA regarding fonts.\r\n\r\nBut I got an answer back from MS though which
    did clear things up:\r\n\r\n\"Providing the fonts, or derivative fonts, are not
    being redistributed, commercial use of the fonts supplied with Microsoft software
    is permitted.\"\r\n\r\nThat's good enough for me.  It would probably help if they
    put that on their website...\r\n\r\nAs for consulting a lawyer, I did speak to
    some through my day job and through friends and while none thought it would require
    further licensing, none could give a definitive answer.  "
