body: "Hello, I've been trying to find this certain font, but no luck so far. It is
  a san-serif unicase font. This is it on these sites:\r\n\r\n[[http://blog.pelerin.info/patrimoine-en-blog/upload/2008/04/Affiche%20Cedhec%202008%202.jpg|On
  This poster]]\r\n(it is the font written as Devenez architecte...\r\n\r\nand\r\n\r\n[[http://www.citechaillot.fr/|In
  this site in images]]\r\n\r\nFrom what I can tell, it is not, Social Gothic, Los
  Alamos or Gala. Even though it is close.\r\n\r\nThanks for all the help"
