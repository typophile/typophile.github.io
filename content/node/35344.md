  body: Thanks for the help. You know, often as I've heard that name; I've never actually
    looked that one up. Can anyone provide me with typefaces that have a similar feel,
    I'm looking for a typeface for a marketing company that does a lot of web based
    things and wants to be seen as progressive but solid and trustworthy. If you have
    any other suggestions for a different feel I would appreciate those as well.

    are confronted with? That would make link lists like that a lot more useful \u2026
    Thanks."

  body: I wish I could wave a magic wand and it would be fixed, but because Germans,
    Norwegians, and Austrians each have their own FontShop site there are jurisdiction
    issues. Fortunately, you should be able to reach FontShop.com if you click the
    link a second time.

  body: "Thanks for the answer. Yeah, I know about that \u20182nd click trick\u2019,
    and yes, the purpose of the redirect is well understood\u2014still I find it annoying.
    Find myself rejoicing everytime a font reference on typophile is made to myfonts,
    Vllg, Linotype &c. That isn\u2019t in the interest of neither FontShop.com nor
    FontShop.de, I bet."
