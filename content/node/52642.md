  that ive been reading lately. Hopefully these posts will be a regular occurance,
  with a specific theme (depends really it could be totally random)\r\n\r\nwell as
  you can tell by the title of the post.. Ive been reading up a lot on helvetica vs
  arial and the pros and cons of these typefaces and i started off with an article
  called [[http://ilovetypography.com/2007/10/06/arial-versus-helvetica/|Arial Vs
  Helvetica]] on [[http://ilovetypography.com|i love typography]] (my favorite typography
  blog  but i digress). \r\n\r\nDont Like helvetica?  check out this article [[http://fontfeed.com/archives/helvetica-and-alternatives-to-helvetica/|helvetica
  and alternatives to helvetica]] on [[http://fontfeed.com| font feed]] and get an
  answer to the question, is there really alternatives to helvetica? \r\n\r\nOh my
  god... is there a scourge in the typographical world? apparentally there is according
  to this article called [[http://www.ms-studio.com/articles.html|scourge of arial]]
  on [[http://www.ms-studio.com|mark simonson studio]] website\r\n\r\nlast by no means
  least.. found an article on use and misuse of period type in the movies... check
  out [[http://www.ms-studio.com/typecasting.html|typecasting]] check it out... he
  also did a groovy trailer for the article which can be also found on the page.\r\n\r\n\r\nwant
