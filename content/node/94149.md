  for a scientific book design. It will be on string theory. Any suggestions would
  be great. \r\n\r\nThe fonts I like are:\r\n\r\n[[http://usfonts.gestalten.com/t-star.html]]\r\n[[https://ourtype.com/#/try/pro-fonts/fakt/]]\r\n[[http://usfonts.gestalten.com/blender-pro.html]]\r\n\r\nBut
  I need to use a type with a sans serif and serif version rather than using two typefaces."
