  It seems the writer \u2013 or perhaps editor \u2013 are using the em-dash as some
  kind of ellipsis. Here are two examples, the second one make use of both an em-dash
  and an ellipsis (and I think there should have been a space before the em, as in
  the first example).\r\n\r\n<strong>\u201CMayella Violet Ewell \u2014!\u201D</strong>

  matter how much they cussed and drank and gambled and chewed; no matter how undelectable
  they were, there was something about them that I instinctively liked \u2026 they

  Perkins, born hypocrites,\u201D Mrs. Merriweather was saying.</strong>\r\n\r\nCan
  anyone more familiar with the language enlighten me on this?\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    a space before the em, but unfortunatelly I'm not 100% sure about it.\r\n\r\nMaybe
    this helps:\r\n\r\n<cite>\"An ellipsis may also imply an unstated alternative
    indicated by context. For example, when Count Dracula says \"I never drink \u2026
    wine\", the implication is that he does drink something else, which in the context
    would be blood. In such usage the ellipsis is stronger than a mere dash, where
    for example \"I never drink\u2014wine\" might only indicate that the Count, not
    a native English speaker, was pausing to get the correct word.\"</cite> <ul><a

    least in this case there is no space before the em."

  body: "The use of the em-dash to signify a pause or trailing off at the end of a
    sentence may be an American phenomenon. Emily Dickinson used dashes everywhere
    in her handwritten manuscripts, and in some editions, editors left the poems that
    way rather than substituting more conventional punctuation. \r\nWhen you're writing
    with a pen or pencil, it's often easier to make a dash than to choose between
    a comma, semicolon, or ellipses. I don't know if Harper Lee wrote <em>To Kill
    a Mockingbird</em> on a typewriter or not, but if she wrote in longhand, she may
    have simply defaulted to dashes, and her editor chose not to change them.\r\nI
    was always taught that in type, em-dashes should be \"tight,\" but that may be
    discretionary, like the spacing after a period."

    second example is Scout(the main character)'s thought, disrupted \u2013 and completed
    \u2013 by Mrs. Merriweather speaking. It's a mighty fine example of writing skills,
    I'd say! Just finished the book way past bed time. It is remarkable!\r\n\r\nI
    usually set em-dashes with a thin or hair space on each side. I've found myself
    using them more often, as a way to cleary separate supplementary information from
    spoken sentences. \r\n\r\nRarely used details like these has a certain charm to
    'em. I can't wait to incorporate a pause like that next time I'm doing editorial
    work!"

    I guess I'm too tired right now to make any sense, but I was cleary thinking of
    incorporating an interruption, not a pause. "

    ago than today. For some reason, this style of punctuating has fallen out of favor.\r\n\r\nBut
    <em>The Chicago Manual of Style,</em> 15th ed., still covers this usage:\r\n\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    \xA76.90 <em>Indicating sudden breaks.</em> An em dash or a pair of em dashes
    \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; may indicate a sudden break in thought or sentence
    structure or an \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; interruption in dialogue. (Ellipsis
    points may also serve this purpose; \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; see 11.45.)"

    me, and this is the first I've seen of it.\r\n\r\nProbably I just haven't read

    French in Ottawa-Hull in the mid-80s, we had a transcription convention no doubt
    derived from the "interruption" function of the em dash: a "false start", where
    the speaker would start and then stop and restart their thought, was signalled
    by a double hyphen (our closest approximation at that time, when the Macintosh
    128 was the new gizmo on the block). '
