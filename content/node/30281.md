  is:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/dirt_3777.jpg]\r\n\r\n\r\nof course,
  i'm curious about the \"i.\" here's a show synopsis:\r\n\r\n\"Courteney Cox stars
  as Lucy Spiller, the hard-driving Editor-in-Chief of tabloid \"Dirt\" and \"Now\"
  magazines. Lucy has a maniacal dedication to finding the truth, for reasons even
  she has yet to fully fathom. With the help of Don Konkey, a schizophrenic paparazzo
  blessed with a genius for getting the money shot, Lucy exposes the hidden truth
  behind celebrity lives - and also determines their fate.\" (from fxnetworks.com)\r\n\r\nany
  thoughts on why the \"i\" is upside down?\r\n\r\njarrod"

    create an 'exclamation point' recalling the sensationalism of tabloid press.\r\n\r\nInterestingly,
    the 'i' is shifted down, putting the dot below the baseline, perhaps a metaphor
    for something buried or underground, reinforcing the dirt. I was pondering this
    already, thanks to heavy advertisement featuring 'Digging in the Dirt' by Peter
    Gabriel.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<A HREF=\"http://www.chozcunningham.com\">Choz</a>\r\n<A

  body: I could swear this is a play on a British tabloid. Perhaps someone can comfirm.
    I see it as an exclamation point as well. In the media nothing can be big enough
    or bold enough. So, of course, they use lots of exclamation points thinking this
    is another way to emphasize the point.

    tabloids here are called red tops (all coincidentally use red for their nameplates)
    but I don't think they would use as \u201Csophisticated\u201D a typographic device.\r\n\r\nThe
    i could be an exclamation point (I saw it as that), could represent something
    buried by dirt, but I like the digging the dirt view as well.\r\nTim"

  body: I can't seem to find it now, but there's a dropped out version of this logo
    as well with a red background. It looks sort of like a torn raffle ticket, with
    the dot of the "i" as a half circle.
