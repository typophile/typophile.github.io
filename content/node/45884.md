  body: Is that a 6x3 grid? It is cool that it 'suggests' the missing parts of the
    letters. I guess your idea will end up with a upright version as well.

  body: The grid is merely implied here. (I haven't learned how to use them yet.)
    These were drawn just to give me an idea of how to achieve uniform weight across
    the styles. I'm redrawing the non-italic version right now as well. I'll show
    it off once I get something working.
