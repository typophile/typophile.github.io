  anyone help, I have seen this a few times and never quite figured out how get it
  right. Colour overlayed with a slight transparency, here are what I see as potential
  issues with applying it (In Indesign):\r\n\r\nMultiply is just a full over print
  - too much\r\n\r\nReducing the opacity - compromises the full colour over white\r\n\r\nHard
  Light - this is the closest I have got but over white it makes the colour brighter
  than over nothing\r\n\r\nI wanted to use this for a corporate job but don't want
  to specify something that I don't fully understand.\r\n\r\nAny help is much ablidged.\r\n\r\nThanks\r\nSteve."

    which would explain why the black underneath is far more muted. A way of achieving
    this in 4 colour process would be to reduce the opacity of the colour underneath
    in the area that was being overprinted.\r\n\r\nSee image below.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/goldonblack_4919.jpg]"

  body: "Thanks but the problem is that it needs to be used over photography, and
    as a corporate guide, so not always me applying it. So it needs to be simple,
    maybe it isn't possible.\r\n\r\nHere is an example of the actual work i'm doing:\r\nhttp://img139.imageshack.us/my.php?image=picture30xo7.jpg\r\n\r\nIt
    shows how the red reacts with the white, when it should stay the same as the solid
    colour rather than brightening it. This causes a problem with changing a brands
    corporate logo colour!\r\n\r\nAny help?"

    solution and then simplify it. Sometimes you\u2019re lucky and a simple solution
    presents itself from the beginning.\r\n\r\nIf it needs to be applied by a monkey,
    create one big shiny button \u2013 in this case a custom Action, Plugin or your
    own transparency filter, which can be included on the guidelines CD or website
    for download."

  body: "Yeah I hadn't thought of that, thanks it definitely works across the board.\r\nI'll
    have to apply it throughout the work and see how it fares, many thanks for that.\r\n\r\nAhh,
    just applied it again and now because of the multiply the copy goes greyish over
    any black. It means the text box would have to be an additional layer, so White
    60% then Red multiply then text box. Hmm quite a lot of layers per text box?\r\n"
