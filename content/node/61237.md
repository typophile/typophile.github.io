body: A while ago someone posted some photos of signs and maholes in Poland. The ogoneks
  were sometimes drawn as a horizontal rectangle or a small square positioned where
  the hook would normally be. I suspect that this was either the product or foreigners
  or was done to save vertical space. Would such a design ever acceptable with sans
  types, or is it just wrong?

    to 20-30's avant-garde tradition. Look at FF DIN. Because until nowadays many
    bad fonts used in Poland don't have polish diactrics, people add them \"by hand\",
    with various effects - using bars, commas, triangles... ;)"

    accents are really, really tiny and rudimentary--as graphic designers sometimes
    relegate accents to that status for layout reasons.\r\nAre there any like that?"

    you can see Aogonek and Eogonek which are acceptable in the context, although
    they look weird and too small*. (The top line contains also interesting, flipped
    Nacute).\r\n\r\n*) Making accents too tiny can cause some grammar/language problems.
    For example: in spoken polish, spelling the final \u0119 as an e, sounds quite
    loutish. So a text containing almost invisible eogonek would often create a real
    ornery feeling.\r\n"
