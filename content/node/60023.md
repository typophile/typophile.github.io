    some technical problem with them?"

  body: "Nice concept!\r\n\r\nI think b d g p q work very well and show that this
    thing has potential.\r\n\r\nThe m is also a bit tricky, the w is better but needs
    some weight taken out in the centre (maybe assymmetrical?). Same for the x, and
    also the k (maybe just move the diagonals away).\r\n\r\nThe h needs a lacuna,
    either on top or at the bottom of the joint (which would be less conventional
    and fitt better, I assume).\r\n\r\nThe o seems a bit too heavy, maybe it could
    do with an opening (at the botom or left) or at least a lacuna. You have done
    the right thing with the y there.\r\n\r\nThe e is much better than the a.\r\n"

  body: wow, so sorry I never got back to this one. Thanks for the input Tim, those
    are some very good suggestions. I've changed the a since then. The m is tricky
    indeed. Some reason m always seems to be my weakest character. I'm somewhat rusty
    on my typography terms, I have an idea but could you explain what "lacuna" means?
    no reasonable google results were found.

  body: Lacunas are often referred to as ink-traps, or sometimes "crotches". Christian
    Schwartz' Amplitude is an example where they are so pronounced they become stylistic
    elements.

  body: Thanks again Tim. I'll try to get an update, in the next few weeks revised
    with your suggestions considered, once I get caught back up with all the various
    projects I have going on.
