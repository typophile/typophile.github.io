<p><img src="/images/old-images/rect2606_3804.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Milka is a display font meant to be used large and for short phrases, not entire sentences. For now it&rsquo;s lower case and minimal punctuation only, I haven&rsquo;t started on the numbers.</p>
<p>I would like some critique and suggestions, there are some characters I&rsquo;m not too thrilled with (particularly r, v, x, z, and ?) and it would be good to have some input. I attached a specimen pdf.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Thank you for the suggestions. Some of the peculiarities are from the rules I gave myself at the start. All the shapes are made from circles or parts of circles, and vertical and horizontal lines. As a result, there are no diagonals anywhere&hellip; which means sloping the s would break the rules&hellip; but if keeping with the rules means I have an s that looks like an r, then I have no choice but to break them!</p>
<p><img src="/images/old-images/s_4942.png" alt=""></p>
<p>How&rsquo;s this? I think it looks more s-like. I thought sloping it would ruin the linking between letters, but it works out. I updated the specimen to the new s.</p>
<p>mk2: I made the current r the way it is because I had designed one and thought it looked too much like an n:</p>
<p><img src="/images/old-images/rr_3564.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Maybe the old one (in red) is okay, and I&rsquo;ve just been looking at all this too long?</p>
<p>I agree with what you say about the c and the v. I think I&rsquo;m going to do something like what I did with the s.</p>
<p>I previously attempted to make a regular z, but I couldn&rsquo;t figure out how to squeeze in two horizontals and a diagonal into the space of the x-height, so I made a cursive z. The x was the last letter I made, it was really tricky, for the same reason, but I think I can use it to make a regular z. I&rsquo;ll have to work on that.</p>

		<div class="commentbody">There you go. The s updated in the pdf looks different than the s in the little red image; I much prefer the one in the image. I don&rsquo;t really see significant problems with the other characters mentioned, but if you&rsquo;re looking for r alternatives, one possibility would be to eliminate the left vertical stroke altogether. And your current z would be improved by retracting the middle left so it&rsquo;s not as long as the top.</div>
