body: "Together with Amsterdam based agency Mainstudio, nr0000 is working on a publication
  'Font-O-Matic'.\r\nThis is a small booklet with \xB1 20 selfmade fons. All based
  on transient fonts. This means all fonts are subject to change.\r\nThink about the
  moon, icecubes, melted chocolate, and more of those processes. Most created fonts
  come in two types: The 'before' and the 'after'.  Hopefully we will get a publication
  allowance wich is enough to get the booklet printed properly.\r\nThe fonts will
  be offered as downloads on http://www.font-o-matic.nl\r\n\r\nThis site will be online
  as soon as we're finished.\r\nKeep you posted.\r\n\r\nIn the meanwhile you can take
  a look at some of our work so far..."
