body: "<strong>The international [[Typo Magazine|magazine TYPO]] dedicated to typography,
  graphic design and visual communication celebrates fifth anniversary. The first
  issue of 2008 brings a number of improvements: the content structure changed as
  well as the size, layout, paper, and, last, but not least, the periodicity: from
  a bi-monthly, TYPO becomes a quarterly journal.</strong>\r\n\r\nThe scope of information
  contained in each issue increased rapidly: just published 31st issue in the new
  design has 84 pages in 230 \xD7 250 mm, as compared to the original 32 pages. The
  magazine is now divided in two sections: first features key articles, the second
  contains short notes, font reviews, columns of editors and contributors, and information
  about contests and conferences. Instead of the editorial, the table of contents
  features short annotations of articles. All articles are printed in English and
  Czech language.\r\n\r\nThe 31st issue is dedicated to <strong>Korean design</strong>;
  articles were written especially for TYPO by top South Korean designers, researchers
  and lectures in typography and design. The readers will learn about the historic
  evolution of Korean type, about the present trends in Korean graphic design and
  its most important representatives, about the Korean calligraphy and the design
  of Latin fonts designated for setting with Chinese, Japanese and Korean type.\r\n\r\nIn
  the following issues of 2008, the readers may look forward to an overview of contemporary
  graphic design and typography in Italy, the design in the countries of the Visegr\xE1d
  Group, and the work of Jan Tschichold.\r\n\r\nSometime this year, the website of
  the magazine is going to change, too, as the TYPO magazine website will be incorporated
  into the Typo.cz web server, thus creating an extensive, modern website dedicated
  to typography, with a number of new features. You may look forward to discussions,
  online shop, RSS, archives, etc.\r\n\r\nYou may subscribe to the TYPO magazine at
  www.typo.cz/shop, where individual back issues are also sold.\r\n\r\nThe schedule
  for 2008 is as follows:\r\n\r\n31- currently selling\r\n32 - July\r\n33 - October\r\n34
  - December\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/typo-cover-31m_5161.jpg]"

    and paper! It is easier to read and fits better on a shelf. Congratulations on
    putting out a beautiful and informative journal on typography that appeals to
    a type-savvy audience!\r\n\r\nChrisL"
