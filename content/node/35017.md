body: Answered some email for a request for typeid on Lettpress list, they send me
  a direct email. Suddenly, in my email, web browser, etc, the default screen font
  is a what I think Wiescher font called designer. How can I shake it, I run searches
  and it's not visible installed on my system?

    are capable of changing the system font?  \r\n\r\nCould you post a screen shot
    that shows exactly what is happening?"
