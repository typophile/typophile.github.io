body: "Hi again. :)\r\n\r\nAlso, and while I'm here, I wonder if I might take the
  chance to request for another type id?...\r\n\r\nI've been trying but having a hard
  time identifying this font family (have, also for this one, asked about in other
  forums, yet so far no luck), and I'd very much appreciate it if someone might please
  help...\r\n\r\nFor bigger display of the logos I attached to this thread, please
  see: <a href=\"http://www.rtp.pt/web/rtp_nova_imagem/holding/logotipo/rtp_holding/h/RTP%20RGB%20positivo%20horizontal.jpg\">RTP-logo1</a>
  and <a href=\"http://www.rtp.pt/web/rtp_nova_imagem/rtp/logotipos/rtp/h/RTP%20RGB%20positivo%20horizontal.jpg\">RTP-logo2</a>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n(In
  the samples I provide, I know there is more than a single weight of this font, yet
  don't mind about identifying each specific weight, no need for all such trouble,
  I only wish and very much will be happy to find out the name of just the font family
  for this typeface. Also, if additional samples would be required, I can provide.
  Or alternatively, you can browse through the site of <a href=\"http://www.rtp.pt\">RTP</a>,
  where you'll find more samples of this font.)\r\n\r\nThank you greatly, once again,
  for any help. :)\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/rtp.jpg]"

    in-house. AFAIK, it was not even converted into a font, as they work with Freehand
    outlines.\r\n\r\nBTW, logos and guidelines for their usage can be found here\r\nhttp://tv.rtp.pt/wportal/press/identidade_rtp/index.php"

    body: "Oh so it's custom made, hmm, so I see... (Such a pity then, though, as
      I really liked that type style...)\r\n\r\nThank you so much for your replies
      and clearup!\r\n\r\nAlso, still thank you, Miguel Sousa, for the link to RTP's
      documentation regarding their logos and usage of them. (Been through all those
      documents already before, throughout my search. :-))\r\n\r\nCurious though,
      before deciding to post, I had previously searched over the forum, for \"RTP\",
      yet it had returned no results, thus why I started this new thread. But so there
      was actually a previous thread about it! Ooops, sorry for having asked again,
      then. :-/ Yet, the funniest, I just searched the forum again, and still it returns
      no results for \"RTP\"... :-S This has me wondering, does the search only go
      through the texts within threads, and not the title lines, is that it?... Or?...\r\n\r\nThank
      you again, for your patience. :)\r\n"
