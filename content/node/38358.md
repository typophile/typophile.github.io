    ask for knowledge in Flaxisign. What is advantages of Flaxisign over Illustrator
    ? What is differences? Or they are same kind of vector graphic softwares?\r\n
    Thank you very much!\r\n    Boris"

  body: Flexisign is made by Beacon Graphics. It is a dedicated program for making
    signs. There are several variations, from fairly expensive to really expensive.
    It is possible to design signs with Illustrator, but additional software is required
    to send files to something like a vinyl cutter. Dedicated sign programs tend to
    have a lot of ready-made effects that might have to be done manually if done in
    Illustrator.

  body: I should mention that I work as a designer for a sign company. I prefer to
    do my designing in Illustrator and then send the files to other programs for cutting
    and printing. We use Gerber's Omega software to take care of the same functions
    that Flexisign would do.

  body: "I used to work in a sign shop too. While you could do most of the design
    work in illustrator, FlexiSign does have precise numerical controls for giving
    things specific sizes and positions a bit more easily than the equivalent functions
    in Illustrator. Also the maximum document dimensions are much greater, allowing
    one to design in full scale for very large signs. \r\n\r\nThe \"Pro\" version
    has the most complete array of drawing tools, while more limited versions only
    import designs from other programs like Illustrator and allow scaling and positioning
    and other very simple edits along with supplying the plotter/vinyl cutter drivers."

  body: Due to the expense of the FlexiSign family of programs, it is unlikely for
    anyone to gain experience with them outside of being employed in a sign shop.

  body: "Thanks to everybody for particular explanation! Now I have idea what it is.
    \r\n So I understood that I also have an option to continue making design in Illustrator
    and afterwards transfer graphics to Flexisign. May be you can tell me if Flexisign
    recognize PDF or Illustrator \"ai\" files?"

  body: "we use Flexi for it's plotter and thermal printer drivers, as well as the
    numerical controls. We design in Corel (in part, because you can work size-as
    up to 150') and then we import into Flexi for out-put.\r\n\r\nIf you already know
    Illustrator or Corel, some plotter basics  and know a bit about how signs are
    made, it's not difficult to figure out how to get around in Flexi.\r\n-- \r\ngotta
    love that editing feature here at Typophile that moves your post to the front
    and out of sequence every time you fix a spelling mistake :o\\\r\n-- \r\nR"

  body: Older versions of flexisign (or casmate, depending on how far back you go)
    were unable to import .pdf's at all. The .ai files were tough, but still possible
    as long as everything was converted to curves (outlines). Newer versions such
    as 7.5 through the newest 8.6 can import and even convert to .pdf's with relative
    ease. I have found in my 15 years of sign work, that I tend to gravitate toward
    FlexiSign Pro 8.0 more that anything else. Occasionally, I use Corel to do autotraces
    and certain color fill operations, but immediately export the design to Flexi
    to do the real chopping and sewing. And as mentioned above, you can't send stuff
    to cut or print to actual sign-producing equipment without some kind of sign software.
    I had the Gerber Omega, but just as Microsoft builds things to work together,
    Gerber makes life difficult if you are trying to output to machines other than
    their own. Drivers are more thoroughly checked out in Flexi. I ditched Omega,
    Illustrator, AnaGraph, CAD, etc...Now I use Flexi and Corel in tandem and can
    pretty much do anything required very quickly, except activate or load fonts...Flexi
    still drags on that issue.
