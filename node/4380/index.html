<div class=commentbody>My biggest peeve right now is not being able to <b>easily</b> accomplish <b>dynamic</b> relative sizing so when your browser window changes size or elements in the window change size the type will resize too. <br> <br>Another is the paucity of widely distributed multiplatform type. It's been awhile since Microsoft released their web fonts. Adobe, Macromedia, Apple, MS (again ) could take a run at it, and even greater would be an Alliance of all these companies all distributing the exact same fonts with sw installs and from their websites. For *nix too! Alternatively all the independent founderies could team up to do the same. Reach is critical and free is critical. <br></div>

<div class=commentbody>"My biggest peeve right now is not being able to easily accomplish dynamic relative sizing so when your browser window changes size or elements in the window change size the type will resize too." <br> <br>But, as an end user, why would I want that? FYI, you can have the page elements/objects resize in conjunction with the type by using percentages or ems or other relative measurements. However, I usually find this a usability/accessibility hindrance rather than benefit.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Darrel, I'm well aware of the usability issues that this could present and I am also aware of a lot of issues around the re-sizing of type on the web. FWIW IE can't resize text if it's set at a pixel dimension but Mozilla (and derivatives and Safari can). An of course there is a lot of information in the web development sphere about this. <br> <br>I just think sometimes it would be nice to say "make this type be 75% of the height of its enclosing box (no matter what the size of that box is) for things like headlines title blocks or section pages, or even things we have never imagined.</div>

<div class=commentbody>I'll say it. Comic Sans has overstayed its welcome in comics too. This is not to say it's a bad comic font when used as intended; it was obviously designed for U&lc. But cartoonists, in thrall to tradition, invariably set it in ALL CAPS. And ALL CAPS is rather unflattering to Comic Sans.</div>

<div class=commentbody>this probably goes without saying but I still see it everywhere. image text! when the designer is so into their type - decides they absolutely have to use some obscure face but can't feed it to the server - and flattens everything into gifs. extra bothersome when its a transparent gif of text with some custom matte to match the background. no text selection - hell to edit. </div>

<div class=commentbody>nick, i agree with you about the crude level of paragraph styling. people just stick with the default -- they take the default space above and below a tag, say a &lt;p>. <br> <br>joe public might now be able, through their web building application, to set font, size, colour. and even leading if we are lucky. but its only those that know (and care) that would start to play around with either first line indents or space around paragraphs. just like with dtp... <br> <br>but i'm glad that we don't see more justified text online. justified text only works when done right (as we all know), which is far beyond the capability of joe public...</div>

<div class=commentbody>funny that nobody mentioned this in this thread: one of the biggest problems in web-type is that there is no flexible type family for screens*. <br> <br>* flexible type families for print are there since frutiger's revolutionary univers system. there are a lot of other examples of this kind of type families today: stone, rotis, scala, thesis, fedra, fago, zine, compatil and many many others. <br> <br>well, there *was* no flexible type family for screens... the elementar system was designed to finally fill this gap. ;-) <br> <br>the elementar fonts are being released little by little at ultrafonts. take a look at it </div>

<div class=commentbody>thanks for the link dan, i did not know this font. <br> <br>but lomo does not have 37 *weights* - it has 37 *variations*, which is a completely different thing. <br> <br>the lomo fonts have names which are, for me, confusing - 'zigg', 'butt', 'sall' and so on. the elementar fonts are organised with a nummerical system which is much easier to understand (imo). <br> <br>and yes, fonts from the elementar system are ultra pixel (grayscale) fonts, what makes a big difference... </div>

<div class=commentbody>Now, I'm just the marketing intern, but I suspect that Lomo is not shown at actual size because its sample was automatically generated, just like all of the text fonts. <br> <br>Lomo may also be Linotype's only pixel offering to date, hench the lack of special treatment. Also, unlike many other pixel fonts, I think that Linotype hopes that people will use these for print as well. <br> <br>I'm sorry for calling them "weights." The lingo is already getting to me.</div>

<div class=commentbody>When it comes to Flash-compatible, bitmap fonts I dig the stuff over at <a href=http://www.miniml.com/ target=_blank>Miniml</a>. The Standard family is in use on <a href=http://www.typophile.com target=_blank>our home page</a>. Most vector screen fonts are crisp in Flash, but for some reason when pulling dynamic text into Flash most of them get fuzzy. The Miniml ones don't. <br> <br>For what it's worth, this appears to be a Flash bug, not a fault of the various font makers out there. If anybody knows of other screen fonts for use with dynamic Flash I'd be happy to know of more.</div>

I use dynamic bitmap fonts all the time, most of the time from Miniml, but don't run into this problem. All about keeping the text field on a whole pixel, but I'm sure you knew that. <br> <br></div>

<div class=commentbody>Sometimes I type a long paragraph, and then think, am I really saying anything? So I'll summarize what I had. ;) <br> <br>Can anyone provide some links of medium to long length paragraphs of HTML text using indents? <br> <br>I really haven't thought much about issues using spacers. There's two things I'm aware of. One is that you can see the outline when they are loading, and the other is that they don't resize with text. So that's probably enough to never use them, but what other issues have you run into? <br> <br></div>

<div class=commentbody>[quote]So that's probably enough to never use them, but what other issues have you run into? [/quote] <br> <br>It's another hit on the server (albeit a small one). The bigger issue is that if you add spacer images to the HTML, you are mixing the presentantion with the content more than you really need to. Typically, CSS can be used, and, when it is used, it allows the content to remain free of any particular style...meaning it is much more portable and re-usable than markup full of things like spacer images.</div>

<div class=commentbody>"Justified text is possible with Cascading Style Sheets (CSS), a major initiative of the WWW consortium." <br> <br>As has already been pointed out this can be done. The problem is that hyphenation isn't automatic, you have to insert hyphens manually, which is no use whatsoever. <br> <br>"For what it's worth, this appears to be a Flash bug, not a fault of the various font makers out there." <br> <br>That shouldn't be happening, try setting your movieclip holding the text field to 99% (myMC.myText._xscale = myMC.myText._yscale = 99;) <br> <br>"If anybody knows of other screen fonts for use with dynamic Flash I'd be happy to know of more." <br> <br>Personally I favour <a href=http://www.fontsforflash.com/ target=_blank>http://www.fontsforflash.com/</a> particularly FFF corporate, which I've relied on countless times. <br> <br>What really really drives me mad is the amount of hacks you have to go through just to undo the basic styling (I'm not going to say design as that would imply some level of thought process) applied by a browser. For example, to hang punctuation you need to remove the automatic margins on the blockquote, insert your quote entities and then use a first-line indent of about -0.5em. You end up with 100 odd lines of code just to get to what you can consider unmolested copy. It's just such a runaround that I don't find it surprising that people just don't bother. </div>
