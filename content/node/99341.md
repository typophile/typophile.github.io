  can Windows users quit caring about ClearType and anti-aliasing?\r\n\r\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_displays_by_pixel_density\r\nA
  13\" MacBook Pro has a resolution of 89 ppcm  or 227 ppi. My iPhone 4s, which is
  starting to seem old, has a ppi of 128 ppcm/326ppi. This is no longer 'bleeding
  edge' technology...millions of people have these devices. \r\n\r\nhttp://blogs.msdn.com/b/b8/archive/2012/03/21/scaling-to-different-screens.aspx\r\n\r\nThis
  answers some of my questions. However, I'm wondering if there are any typophiles
  who are using, say, a Windows 8 desktop with a high-pixel-density display. I'm having
  trouble Googling what options are actually available. \r\n\r\nWhat I think I want
  is an external display that I can connect to a reasonably current PC and get 200+
  ppi with Windows 8. Is this possible?\r\n\r\nI don't care if its of physically smaller,
  I just don't want to be able to see text pixel edges on my PC anymore. Its 2013.

    to physically discern. That's essentially all I'm asking for. Ancient ClearType/anti-aliasing
    disputes are probably irrelevant at about 4ooppi, at least for this human.

    crisp next to any schenanigans used to improve things at 150ppi. It seems like
    some display maker should step in and provide this for people who want it... Win

  body: "<em>To my original question; this seems like a business situation and not
    one of technological limitations.</em>\r\n\r\nAs has been discussed here and elsewhere
    many times before, there are good reasons why we're seeing increases in screen
    resolution in smaller devices and not in larger monitors. The more device pixels
    in a screen, the higher the likelihood that one of them will fail; the attrition
    rate for high resolution monitors has been too high to entice manufacturers. IBM
    was making 200 ppi screens for a while, but the pricing was high, and they were
    mostly marketed for medical imaging uses. Apple is just now pushing the size of
    high resolution screens with their 13\" MacBook Pro retina laptops and, just announced,
    15\" refurbished models. These are the largest screens of anything like that resolution
    that I am aware of, and I'll be surprised if even Apple can push it much further.
    There comes a point when the cost of all the failed screens that have to be trashed
    makes it economically unviable. Unless someone develops manufacturing processes
    that very significantly reduce the attrition rate, high resolution screens are
    going to mostly exist in the smaller devices.\r\n\r\nBy the way, I was quite serious
    about getting a larger monitor and sitting further back. I have a 30\" Dell screen."

    as an option (the display is sold separately). \r\n\r\nThe Mac Pro is their most
    expensive model and they don't sell huge numbers of them, so the low yield and
    higher cost of the retina display wouldn't be such a problem.\r\n\r\nBut for their
    consumer desktop, the iMac, I don't think they're in any hurry to give it a retina
    display. Like you said, it would be expensive and the rejection rate is too high
    at this point.\r\n\r\n"
