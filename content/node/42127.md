  it with my old avatar. Is there a problem with the way I'm doing it?

  body: Got rid of temporary internet files. Wasn't anything to do with that though.
    Just refreshed and the old one was replaced by the new one. I feel very silly.

    The graphic came along with the confirmation from Typophile.

    got my receipt about a month ago but nothing has been transfered from my bank
    account yet. I guess paypal just sucks."

    check there, or else contact Typophile. You should wear your badge proudly!

    here. After Patty's comment, I just went and checked my confirmation e-mail, but
    there is no attachment. Hmph."

  body: I'm having the same problem. I think the problem is that I cannot get my file
    size down below 24 Kb. I've made the image extremely small (30x30) but the file
    size will not get smaller than 52 Kb. I'm obviously not a web guru. Any suggestions?

    for me:\r\n\r\n1. In Adobe Photoshop, start with a new image that is 60 pixels
    wide x 60 pixels tall, and has a resolution of 300 pixels per inch. Alternately,
    in Adobe Illustrator, make a square that is 60 points x 60 points. This will equal
    60 x 60 pixels later, when you save your file for the Web.\r\n\r\n2. Make sure
    you are in RGB mode (in either Photoshop or Illustrator), and that you have the
    color palette set to Web-safe colors (to make sure your icon's colors will look
    the same on a Mac or on a PC).\r\n\r\n3. When your icon is ready, go to <strong>File
    > Save for Web</strong>. This will open a window that gives you a preview of your
    icon, and lets you choose different image formats (JPEG is best for color, GIF
    is best for black and white). This window will also show you what size the final
    file will be, and let you choose different variables for image compression and
    quality. Once you hit the Save button, you will get a chance to change the name
    of your file, if you wish.\r\n\r\nI hope this helps!"

    the way it works is that jpeg is good for photos and GIF is fine for color as
    long as it's flat color. Mine is a gif I think. It should be anyway."
