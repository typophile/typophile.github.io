  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>You guys all have seen them I&rsquo;m sure: The dreaded Real Estate business card. Full address, cell / mobile #, fax #, 1-800 #, home phone #, work #, website, email, maybe even a father company like ReMax and their address and THEIR phone #s - how can all of this fit well on a business card?</p>
<p>My question is this: is there a typeface that works well in a small type size that can convey all of this information (or at least half of it)?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve used Scala Sans in the past and love it but I start to cringe when it gets below 7pt. There&rsquo;s also Unibody by Underware but it seems too tech-y.</p>
<p>Sorry for the long-winded post, thanks in advance!</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Uh, sorry but why are you setting that text at 7pt? I wouldn&rsquo;t go any smaller than 9-10pt tops.</p>
<p>There are 2 types of business cards&hellip; fancy ones and useful ones. Sadly, Real Estate cards fall into the latter category. So, you&rsquo;ll have to get clever if you want to create a well-designed but still useful business card.</p>
<p>Have you considered icons or abbreviation, instead of extra text? Also consider condensed versions of a font over a reduced type size. Business cards need to be readable, sadly that is one of that caveats of designing them.</p>
<p>You might also want to consider a font with a fairly large x-height and contrast, so you can use a smaller text size while not reducing readability.</p>
<p>Have you tried a vertical layout as well? There are also options when it comes to printing&hellip; a folded card, doubles the amount of space&hellip; and allows for a more stylish design. Even printing double sided can open up room.</p>
<p>Consider your other options before resorting to reduced readability.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Thanks Asvetic. Those are great ideas!</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t mean to let that on that my intent was to reduce readability as to fit everything. That&rsquo;d be silly / poor design. Sorry if that was confusing. Instead, I have found typefaces that work in small point sizes (e.g. 7pt) AND are still highly readable (like Unibody). I was wondering what other fonts there like that. I feel as though that must be a category of fonts that I am just unaware of.</p>
<p>I like the condensed idea, and I hadn&rsquo;t considered looking for a typeface with a large x-height and contrast - any specific recommendations?</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Well, if I were to suggest some fonts, I think Hoelfer &amp; Frere-Jones have a few nice ones. Like Mercury or Chronicle. I also like Gerard Unger&rsquo;s Swift. All have nice large x-heights and suitable contrast.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re looking for a sans I&rsquo;d suggest, Jeremy Tankard&rsquo;s Bliss or Benton Sans by Morris Fuller Benton, or even Vista Sans at Emigre.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure the direction you&rsquo;re going style wise, so it&rsquo;s hard to really suggest something and know if it&rsquo;s suitable for what you&rsquo;re trying to do. I know you said you like Scala Sans, that has nice contrast, but the x-height isn&rsquo;t super large, so going small like 7pt will be difficult to read.</p>
<p>A word to the wise, if you mix condensed with regular, you can get some very nice contrasts between information. A line like &ldquo;Phone: (123) 456-7890&rdquo;, you&rsquo;d use a bold condense for the &ldquo;Phone:&rdquo; and a regular non-condense for the numbers, if they&rsquo;re old-style numbers, even better.</p>
<p>Well used color, even muted, can also help make important data pop.</p>

<p>And perhaps some of the words on the card could be turned into icons?  A mobile phone, a fax machine, etc.  Maybe that would reduce the word clutter and give you an opportunity to make the card interesting?</p>
