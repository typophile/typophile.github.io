  bringing bumpers stickers featuring the typeface onto the Late Late Show and sticking
  them on Craig Fergusons desk:\r\n\r\n[[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAYxXg1YkDI|Youtube

    a freeware type I made 10 years ago while in college called \"Jammed Toaster\",
    as it was a tribute to the logotype for software maker Adaptec, which at the time
    published two CD authoring programs, \"Toast\" and \"Jam\". \r\n\r\nIt's an awful
    font, with crumby letter forms and non-existent spacing, and no capital letters
    (which is why they must have thrown in the 'D' from Bauhaus in there).\r\n\r\nMusic
    Choice is a collection of music offerings from cable providers like Comcast, but
    I'm assuming it's used nation-wide. Which is kind of cool, as I've never had any
    of my work get that kind of exposure before."

    into Waterstones yesternight and there was a huge display with 60 times the same
    book. It bore a font of mine on the cover. Unfortunately, it was a beta version
    of the font (I can tell from details). Furthermore, the font is not released yet.
    So it must come from a pdf I sent to two or three people for beta testing... My
    bet is: it will be on dafont before even being released and all the time spent
    on kerning and hinting properly will be wasted! '
