  answer.\r\n\r\nFrom what I understand, in Turkish the uppercase form for the dotted
  i is Idotaccent. Similarly the uppercase form of the dotlessi is a undotted I (a
  normal uppercase I in latin script). If this is true then building a c2sc and smcp
  should have a language specific variation to cover this. I have examined a number
  of OpenType fonts that have shipped with my Adobe apps, and I can't say that I have
  found any that do this. A normal lowercase dotted i transforms into a normal small
  cap I even when using a Turkish keyboard as imput. \r\n\r\nHow is this being handled
  by those of you developing OT?"

    feature file for Minion Pro</a>, all the necessary programing code is in there.
    i'm not sure why this isn't working for you. Maybe Thomas will explain...

  body: "I definitely use a Turkish language system tag and appropriate special mappings
    in the <smcp> feature (<c2sc> doesn't need special handling for Turkish). Adobe's
    view, I believe, is that the application should do buffered case conversion before
    applying the <smcp> feature, so it technically should not be necessary for fonts
    to handle this in lookups. The idea is that when the user applies <smcp>, the
    application will perform character based conversion to uppercase, taking into
    account special casing rules for Turkish text, and then apply the <c2sc> lookups.\r\n\r\nI'm
    not convinced, either by the idea or by the likelihood of it being implemented
    in this way outside of Adobe apps, so I continue to handle this directly in the
    <smcp> feature. The nice thing is that implementing it directly in the <smcp>
    feature for Turkish does not interfere with the buffered casing approach, so either
    implementation can be performed with the same font."
