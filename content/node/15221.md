body: This one has me pulling my hair out. I've authored cross platform versions of
  the same OpenType font in TTF and OTF versions. The OTF versions work on both Mac
  and PC. The TTF version works everywhere on Mac, and in Word on PC, but not in InDesign.
  Does anyone know if there are InD + TTF gotchas on PC?

    thoses files are located. I had a similar problem? The preview doesn't work on
    suitcase, neither on Xpress, Illustrator or Photoshop. That proble happen few
    days ago. I did a search and the only file I found is Office Font cache.\r\n\r\nI

  body: "We had something that may be similar -- A Helvetica.TT font came with my
    machine, & resided in the \\Windows\\Fonts folder. I made up a Helvetica.otf font
    & put in in the InDesign CS2 fonts folder. (\\Programs\\Adobe\\Adobe Indesign
    CS2\\Fonts). InDesign wouldn't see the .otf font until I took the .tt font out
    of the \\Windows\\Fonts folder. Bit of a nuisance, and surprising since the .otf
    font was in a subfolder of the program.\r\n\r\nFWIW "
