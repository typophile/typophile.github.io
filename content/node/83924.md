    side of the stem seem to be more connected (i.e., the taper follows through as
    though the bar is one piece)."

  body: 1, but in the case of the f I think you need to give more sense of connection
    between the stroke on the left and right. The t works better in this regard.

  body: "I agree with Andreas, there is enough cleverness in this (very interesting)
    typeface already, no need to make the f and t problematic.\r\nA less prickly,
    fairly even crossbar with the sense of connection John mentions would be better.\r\nApply
    your gimmick with discretion.\r\n\r\nIt doesn't hurt to have a \"third stem\"
    weight in a high contrast face\u2014sticking rigidly with stem weights is not
    a very sophisticated way to design types. Just look at how Frutiger skinnies up
    the diagonals in the bold weights of his eponymous face.\r\n\r\nOne of my efforts:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/defeaten_4546.png]"

    me as true. Seems a bit discontinuous as it is. And maybe a little overdone, as
    Nick seems to feel.\r\nBut I kind of like the basic idea, though. Tone it down,
    smooth it out?\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Thanks a lot. \r\n\r\nArg. When looking at 'defeaten' as shapes rather than
    letters, which I always do when I try to create a good texture, 2 wins. On the
    other hand, I must admit that the discontious bar is not very logical, structurewise.\r\n\r\nIn
    low contrast fonts, I like the bar to be thick (garamond). In high contrast typefaces,
    such as my own example above, and yours Mr. Shinn, it just doesn't feel right
    to me to have a \"third stem\" suddenly popping up. Hence, my idea of the tapering.
    \r\n\r\nI guess what all you guys are looking for is something like this:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Picture6_3541.png]\r\n\r\nBetter?"

  body: 'Well yes. I mean, basically: make both the thinnest and the thickest parts
    slightly bigger, instead of just thickening up the thinner bit near the stem.
    Could that possibly work? 2 is nice but a bit puny.'

    on the left. t-e seems to stand a bit wide \u2026\r\n\r\nThe a looks very charming.
    \r\nYou may want to tryout some of this: make the middle hairline of it a *little*
    bit stronger. Take a little of the right part\u2019s thickness and lend it to
    the left-side bowl. Grant the down-right ending a little bit more swing (the same
    to e; look at t!). Increase the hight of a by a half percent.\r\n\r\nthe f looks
    as being not as high as the d \u2026"

  body: 'You might try thickening the cross bar on the left of the f and t. I think
    maybe the difficulty in "solving" this is because a free-standing cross bar is
    visually something different from either the crossbar or the terminal of the e,
    and can take more weight. The left side of the f looks particularly weak. You
    could try removing it also. '

  body: "A little more on the difference between terminals at different angles, joins.
    The diagonal terminals along the NE-SW line (thin diagonal) are naturally thinner
    with the broad pen, which by habit of viewing many typefaces affects what the
    eye accepts. Also joins often benefit from thinning because of optical effects.
    A horizontal is thicker with the broad pen than the thin diagonal. So, again,
    we tend to accept it. None of this is a rule that can't be broken, but it is something
    you can play with. \r\n\r\nSo I'm guessing that you can make the left part of
    the crossbar on the f, t, thicker without violating the wonderful liveliness you've
    got going here. And it will make it easier to have the stroke go \"through\" the
    stem visually. "

    what my 'eye' tells me is more important than the theory behind it. Maybe my eye
    is just not as sophisticated as I thought it was, but somehow it doesn't allow
    me to make it thicker. A little vague, I know.\r\n\r\nI guess I'll just keep on
    staring and editing, untill my 'eye' gives up ;-P\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\nJasper"
