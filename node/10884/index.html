		<div class="commentbody">It looks to me that, once again, any similarities are simply a consequence of there being only so many ways to design a font based on a strict grid structure. It's easy to see the grid structure underlying both Feynman and Lust Pure, and it looks like they have both used an identical or very similar grid. That, of course, does not imply plagiarism any more than Avant Garde Gothic can be said to have copied Futura. The ground rules are the same, but the path to completion is different. <BR> <BR>Having said that, I should add that of the two samples, I prefer Feynman; although I do like the quirks of Lust Pure. I could easily see myself using either font. <BR> <BR>One suggestion for Feynman: I would shorten the height of the lc &quot;t&quot; by one stroke-thickness (or one grid block, if you prefer). It looks unnaturally tall, especially next to a full-height lc &quot;h&quot;. <BR> <BR>You also might consider shortening the overhang of the lc &quot;r&quot; by the same amount. <BR> <BR>Nice work! <BR> <BR>David</div>

		<div class="commentbody">On the topic of remixing typefaces, De-construction, Revivals, etc. I think that it is nice to see old work reworked into something new. A good example would be the work of Swiss designer Cornel Windlin who created a rough typeface called FF Magda (fontshop/Lineto) which was the reworked into Magda Clean by Critzler. I believe it was later reworked into something else altogether. I would like to see more of this, as long as the original designers are getting the proper credit and fees. I would like to interest anyone in this type of collaboration with a couple of my own typefaces. (see Unicratica posting in SanSerif section)</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I took a little time to stydy the letterforms again and think I see something that could use a little improvement. I noticed the counters on the thicker weights seem to have too confined counters which offsets the visual balance in the letterforms.I believe this is one of the drawback from generating multiple weights with software solutions such as Fontographer. I think the best way to correct this is to actually redraw the thicker weights so the letters are actually a little wider. This is obviously very time consuming so I guess it depends on what level you wish to take this to. Alias's Gareth Hague and David James's Metsys is a good example of what I am talking about. I spent $180 on this 5 weight face, which is more than I am normally willing to spend on a non-text family, but I have used it on lots commercial work, and in my opinion it was worth it. I think it would be worth the extra effort if you want to sell this font commercially. <BR> <BR><IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/843.jpg" ALT="metsys.jpg"></div>

		<div class="commentbody">Of course, sorry&hellip; <BR> <BR>Concerning interpolation, what I did in the case of Patria was the following: <BR>1. Drew and digitized a weight close to what I thought Regular *would* be. <BR>2. Made the two extremes by modifying that weight (starting with an automatic FOG weight change but then making the Light's thins thicker and the Bold's thins thinner*, for starters). <BR>3. Cleaned up the two extremes to make them look nice on their own. <BR>4. Dumped the original Regular. <BR>5. Made two intermediate weights (the exact &quot;location&quot; of which depended on many things). <BR>6. In order to maximize continuity, I did *not* clean up the intermediate weights, instead going back and modifying the two extremes to get the intermediates that I wanted. <BR> <BR>* Although maybe I should have made the thicks thicker, considering the Bold might not be bold enough&hellip; I didn't leave myself enough room (maybe even on the light extreme), that's for sure. <BR> <BR>Example of #6: If I saw that the lc &quot;k&quot; in the interpolated Regular had an upper arm that was too thin, I'd look at the two extreme &quot;k&quot;s to see which one was causing the problem (sometimes it was both), and did the modification(s) there, and then regenerate a new Regular. <BR> <BR>So the eventual Regular was a little different (and ended up lighter) than my original design, but it wasn't really worse, and it was a &quot;clean&quot; interpolation.
