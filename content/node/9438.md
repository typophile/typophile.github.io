body: Hi, from what I understand there are different categories of italic typefaces,
  including basic italic, format italic, chancery italic, and cursive italic. Id like
  to find out more about this, does anyone know details about this or know resources
  where I can learn more about this..

    target="_blank">this book</a> to be a great resource to understanding how the
    different calligraphic scripts are related. it might be a bit overkill for your
    question though. <BR> <BR>Also, don&#39;t forget the sloped roman category of
    italics.

    cursive &#40;of varying degrees&#41; and sloped-roman. <BR> <BR>Paul, nice looking
    book. Check out Mediavilla&#39;s too. <BR> <BR>hhp

  body: 'going back to what you first posted, i believe &#40;but could be wrong&#41;
    that the formata italic is the same as what you meant by &#34;basic italic&#34;
    and then chancery is a more swashy version of the formata. From &#34;The Art of
    Calligraphy&#34; by David Harris: &#34;Formata letters are distinguished by the
    wedge serif to the left of the stem, corsiva by the swashes to the right of the
    stem.&#34; &#40;p. 96&#41; <BR> <BR>A &#34;cursive italic&#34; i would consider
    a script face. or did you mean something else?'
