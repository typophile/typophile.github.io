  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Hi, I am in the process of sorting through my companys extensive font collection and I am trying to get rid of duplicate fonts. I have Avenir and Avenir LT Std as open type fonts.
My question is which one is better to keep, and what is the difference between the two?
I know I'm going to have the same problem when I get to Helvetica. I have searched online with no luck so far. Thank you for any advice given.

		<div class="commentbody">Without knowing the source of your fonts, this question is impossible to answer.

'Avenir LT Std' is most likely Adobe's version (which is also sold by Linotype among others). 'Avenir' could be from anyone. What does the font's copyright information indicate?

The copyright info for the LT Std is as follows:
Copyright © 1989, 1995, 2002 Adobe Systems Incorporated.  All Rights Reserved. © 1981, 1995, 2002 Heidelberger Druckmaschinen AG. All rights reserved.

And the copyright info for plain Avenir is as follows:
Copyright (c) 1989, 1995 Adobe Systems Incorporated.  All Rights Reserved.Avenir is a trademark of Linotype-Hell AG and/or its subsidiaries.

The reason I ask which is better to use is because some designer friends of mine have said that the LT Std version of some fonts has strange spacing.
I dont really know what the difference is supposed to be, if any.

Thanks for your time.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I would assume that 'Avenir' is simply a conversion to OpenType of Adobe's Type 1 version of Avenir since AFAIK all of their fonts had 'Std' appended to the name when they released their library in OpenType format.

Some of the Standard versions might have had spacing problems introduced, but then some of the standard versions might also have corrected spacing problems which were present in the earlier versions. I don't think you can make any inferences based solely on the fact that 'Std' is appended -- this is simply what Adobe uses to designate OpenType fonts which have standard Western European Character sets (as opposed to Pro fonts which also include Central European as well as Cyrillic and Greek in some cases).

Basically, if you want to choose one version over the other you'll simply have to experiment and see which offers the better quality. And of course there's no reason why you can't keep both if in doubt. After all, if you get rid of either, you're going to run into problems with any existing documents which use that font.

I think I will keep both as there is sure to be work done in one or the other.
