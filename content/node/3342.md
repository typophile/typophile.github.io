  The two-story g did not close and the foot of the R did not touch the stem. <BR>
  <BR>Thank you <BR>

  body: If there is any way you can show a sample, that would help a lot. Some people
    make notes about the title typefaces &#40;presumably&#41;, but I am not one of
    them, and I didn&#39;t see the movie anyway.

  body: What I usually do is to sneak a small digital camera into the theater. I sometimes
    have to sit through several showings to get good shots of the main titles, not
    to mention any other type that is used in a film--especially if it is used badly.
    <BR> <BR>As you might imagine, this is rather time consuming. Fortunately there
    are several theaters I know of that are in range of a WiFi hot spot. &#40;It&#39;s
    more common than you might think, but, considering the density of Starbucks, not
    that surprising.&#41; So, what I do is sneak my TiBook in as well. That way I
    can keep up with the Type ID Board and not miss out on getting the jump on anyone
    else here. <BR> <BR>I can usually ID fonts on sight, but there are many times
    I wish I had my type specimen books with me. &#40;I used to bring Jaspert, McGrew,
    FontBook, and a few others, but it was killing my back.&#41; Fortunately, with
    the WiFi connection, I can at least check the online specimens at MyFonts and
    the rest. <BR> <BR>Right now, in fact, I&#39;m sitting through the second showing
    of The Haunted Mansion. It&#39;s really bad, but there is a scene near the beginning
    of the third act where they are looking at this &#34;old&#34; book and the title
    is set in Matrix &#40;can you believe it?!&#41;. I would have gotten it in the
    previous showing, but an usher was standing nearby. It would have been too hard
    to explain. <BR> <BR>I should cut this short since the scene is coming up pretty
    soon. What&#39;s really annoying is, I bought a box of Milk Duds at the snack
    counter. I tried to eat too many at once and now I can&#39;t seem to get my tongue
    out of my cheek. <BR> <BR>Anyway, I haven&#39;t seen Kill Bill yet, so I can&#39;t
    help you with that one.

    probably too blown away by the film. <BR> <BR>I seem to remember that the text
    titles between the chapters were set in Futura, although I might be confusing
    this with another movie.. And that&#39;s probably not the face you&#39;re looking

    at all. There are people who bring video cameras, in fact. Back in college in
    the mid-seventies I brought a 35mm camera into a showing of 2001: A Space Odyssey
    and took a dozen or so pictures. I was a little obsessed with that movie at the
    time. <BR> <BR>I have to confess, my little story was partly inspired by a chapter
    in the book &#34;A Year At The Movies&#34; by Kevin Murphy. Murphy went to a different
    public showing of a movie every day for a year, and then wrote a book about it.
    On Thanksgiving, he managed to smuggle an entire Thanksgiving dinner into a theater
    under a very large overcoat. Pretty funny stuff.'

    for the proverb, a bit of Busorama for the studio titles... pause for the prelude...
    okay there&#39;s some Friz Quadrata &#40;bold&#41;, then I&#39;ll be damned if
    that&#39;s not Bookman &#40;bold, ITC?&#41; for the film title. Followed by some
    more Avant Garde and Friz, throwing in a bit of Palatino to mix things up, then
    more of the AG/FQ combo, then back to Palatino, and finally Avant Garde for the
    Chapter titles.  <BR> <BR>Certainly one of the more, er, &#39;typographically-rich&#39;
    title sequences in recent memory. <BR> <BR>So the &#39;R&#39; could be either
    Friz Quadrata or Palatino, but the non-closing &#39;g&#39; could only be Friz,
    even though I don&#39;t recall seeing any lowercase...? <BR> <BR>Oh, and the end
    credits are Bookman again.
