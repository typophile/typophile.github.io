  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>Hello everyone.</p>
<p>I have been working on a personal typographic/composition project. It is an advert for the typeset Adobe Caslon Pro. This was created in inDesign so I tried to make all the spaces typographicaly correct. All comments and critics are very welcome as I would like to add this piece to my portfolio.
Thanks.</p>
<p>Regards,
David</p>
<p>Attached is a small preview image and a pdf.

<p>edit: Hmm while exporting I see the last sentence was cut off, hope you get the idea though, will fix later.</p>

		<div class="commentbody">The first thing I would expect from an advertisement for a text face is to see it in use in a number of sizes and measures, that is to say I don&rsquo;t see the need for the text image on the right. As for the paragraph you have set it is suffering from being justified, especially the two lines starting &lsquo;Constitution were…&rsquo; and &lsquo;1770. The…&rsquo; where the word spaces looks huge after the full stop. I think you should look at a wider measure and see if ranged left, right ragged is better, if you intend to stick with justified you could look at overhanging punctuation and hyphenation. Another point to consider is the type of numerals, I find non-aligning work better in text situations. In short I would look at presenting (at least) a line of text in 6, 8, 10, 12 and 14 point (which I don&rsquo;t think needs hyphenation), try setting your copy ranged left and limit the image area and try to make it more related to the product.

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I like having graphic artwork with type specimen. If you would replace the alphabet (above the black bar) with different size samples in the same area I think that may work.</p>
<p>Also, it is boring the have a bar exactly in the middle of the page. Go 3/4 of the way. I would move it down to give more room for a wide range of size samples. Great start!</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Thankyou for the comments everyone. I will be changing the page soon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think you should look at a wider measure and see if ranged left, right ragged is better, if you intend to stick with justified you could look at overhanging punctuation and hyphenation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I was trying to make its width typographically correct (or so I have read) with the right amount of characters per line but I will try this.
I will have to read up on some of the terms you mentionned as I didnt find them in my french version of indesign :)</p>
<p>&ldquo;Also, it is boring the have a bar exactly in the middle of the page. Go 3/4 of the way. I would move it down to give more room for a wide range of size samples.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Great advice, I completely agree.</p>
<p>Thanks again.

David</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>If you do have problems with any of the terms, post them and someone will be able to explain them clearer than I.</p>
<p>Essentially I was saying –
Range left rather than justify (straight vertical margin on the left, uneven margin on the right);
if that doesn&rsquo;t work for you or you prefer justified try having the full stops (periods) and commas and parts of the hyphens go beyond the width of the column;
and introduce hyphenation into the copy to reduce the chances of wide spaces.</p>
<p>Also the point you make about typograpically correct number of characters per line, these are only guidelines and while useful they are open to all kinds of (ab)use and interpretation.</p>
<p>Hope I haven&rsquo;t confused you further:)
