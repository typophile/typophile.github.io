"Squooshability" is exactly the background of Adrian Frutiger's design of <a href="http://www.linotype.com/48493/icone-family.html">Icone</a>. If you have access to the Frutiger monograph ("Complete Works"), there's some interesting discussion of that in there.

There's also a brief mention of it in this thread (search for Icone): http://typophile.com/node/55783</div>

In the early days of DTP, I would stretch Adobe Garamond to 150% in Quark (for text), and it looked great. Really!
Diagonals are the sticking point, so square faces without diagonals may be compressed lots without apparent distortion.
But no, I haven't designed any faces with squooshability as a parameter.</div>

Couldn't open the Quark file, but here's a scan of a proof, from 1989.
So, I'm not quite sure precisely what are the percentage of stretching, they vary, but it was a lot of fun.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I bet it was fun. Doesn't look half as bad as I pictured, and not nearly as bad as <a href="http://typophile.com/node/60755">this</a>. You may be right that stretching horizontally is less detrimental than condensing – at least the contrast pattern stays comparably comfortable. The variance in stretch maybe seems almost more disturbing than the stretch itself (like comparing the two bottom lines – "biologically" seems a lot more "normal" than "determinations" no?).
I think it also looks "good"/"fun" in a very 1989 sort of way. Dunno – looking at that headline (and those O l i g o n u c l e o t i d e s ! ) today, and as a type designer, would you still do that?</div>

Yes. I'm trying to reconstruct my design process. 
I think that I was using the variety of stretching to "massage" text blocks to fit the layout, and the variety of stretching, and type styles, served to disguise that "cheating".
For instance, the really wide drop cap was done to optimize the justification of the first paragraph.
And the three squared-off items were stretched to fit the space they're in, with nice margins.

<em>...in a very 1989 sort of way...</em>

Yes, it was supposed to look new, advertising a new piece of scientific equipment, and stretched type signified new at the time, the DTP meme. Also the spectroscope itself was long.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Gosh, indeed! Thank you, Kent. Apologies, I had a quick glance only at the big samples in the right column.
Although I now see that Sumner Stone himself seems to endorse slanting, it still looks like a mere makeshift to me: Silica might withstand the slanting better than other faces do, but some characterforms (especially ‘a’ and ‘g’) do suffer. Also, it seems to affect the otherwise balanced spacing.

The slant factor in the specimen seems to be ~10°, with additional condensing (~92%). Stone has also recommended pairing Silica with the Italics of his Magma.
