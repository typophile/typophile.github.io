  that time, much of the stuff I've seen here has inspired me to finally chase the
  dream of putting my own font together. Over this weekend, I had a few sketches that
  stood out and I decided to run with them. The attached image is the lower-case result
  of those.\r\n\r\nI know I'm still a bit early in the process, but I really wanted
  to get feedback right off the bat. I'm still trying to grasp the technical details
  of font design and would appreciate input in that regard. I'm sure there's at least
  a few faux paus here.\r\n\r\nOverall, the style started its inspiration from the
  [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/yellow-design/verb/|Verb font family]]. I liked the
  more angular feel it had to it, but wanted my own spin and something that leaned
  toward a serif rather than a sans.\r\n\r\nSo, with that, I'm excited to hear everyone's
  thoughts and input."

  body: "Where the thins branch off the stems, they look too thick, as if they thicken
    as they go in. This may be an optical illusion, but to counter it you may want
    to make them taper thinner as they join. \r\nThe horizontal terminal on /r/'s
    arm is awkward and doesn't really fit with the rest of the font (e.g. descender
    of /g/). Perhaps it should also be narrower.\r\nThick/thin pattern of /v/w/y/
    feels backwards.\r\nCrossbar of /f/t/ might be too thick. \r\n/e/ looks too wide.\r\nAre
    the right stems of h/m/n/u/ the same width as the left?\r\nLots of awkward curves
    but if you can work that stuff out there's promise in this. "
