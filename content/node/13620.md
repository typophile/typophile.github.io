body: "fontBoy was launched in the summer of 1995 to manufacture and distribute fonts
  designed by [[Bob Aufuldish]] and [[Kathy Warinner]] of the design office, Aufuldish
  & Warinner. The foundry has released fonts ranging from the quirky and handmade
  to the geometrically precise. The current direction of fontBoy\u2019s work incorporates
  more classical elements into the fonts. The designers try to stay focused on what
  interests them rather than trying to chase trends. Derided and celebrated as being
  part of the early 90\u2019s grunge movement, the designers see themselves connected
  to the wide-open early 20th century version of modernism rather than the formulaic
  high modernism of the international style.\r\n\r\nSince its founding, fontBoy\u2019s
  award-winning fonts have been published widely, included in: [[Indie Fonts]] 1,
  Critique Magazine\u2019s Big Crit, Graphis Digital Fonts 1, [[Typology]], by [[Steven
  Heller]] and [[Louise Fili]], Extreme Fonts, by Spencer Drate, emotional_digital,
  by Alexander Branczyk, The Designer\u2019s Guide to Web Type, and The Designer\u2019s
  Guide to Symbol & Icon Fonts Online."
