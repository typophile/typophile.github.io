body: These are examples of the Font Oldsmobile puts on the Rear of their cars with
  Chrome Lettering that shows the &#34;Model Name&#34; of their vehicles.  <BR> <BR>I
  especially like the &#34;G&#34; and &#34;R&#34; characters. <BR> <BR>1.  Does anyone
  know what the Font Name and Foundry is for this typestyle? <BR> <BR>2.  If not &#40;if
  it is a custom made font&#41;, is there a font extremely close to this? <BR> <BR><img

    this Oldsmobile Model Name Font style.   <BR> <BR>I guess that means you identifying
    this one &#40;or one extremely close to it&#41; will be quite satisfying!'

    border=0> <BR>When I don&#39;t find it straight away - which is the case as this  <BR>is
    a custom designed proprietary font - I need to free up  <BR>some time to research.
    I&#39;ll get back to you later.

  body: 'I am not sure if this was a custom designed font or not- although it certainly
    could be. <BR> <BR>Even if it is, I am kind of surprised that none of our typofile
    experts has been able to suggest a few &#34;alternate&#34; fonts that are a &#34;fairly
    close match&#34;. <BR> <BR>The font certainly is somewhat distinctive, but it
    is also quite plain and simple in design. <BR> <BR>Does anybody know of any fonts
    that come &#34;close&#34; to the sample? <BR> <BR> <BR>PS:  Yves- Well said!'
