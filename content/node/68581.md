body: "Hey Guys, we were asked to make a font under these conditions:\r\n\r\n- Use
  only Horizontal and Vertical Lines\r\n- Cannot simulate a curve leaving pixels white
  on the corners.\r\n- Uppercase Characters and Numbers Only.\r\n\r\nThis is what
  i have so far - http://fontstruct.fontshop.com/fontstructions/show/nepo_3\r\n\r\n-
  Height is 7px and Width is 10px\r\n\r\n- Small Version\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/nepofont_4319.PNG]\r\n\r\n-
  Medium\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/nepofontmedium_6016.PNG]\r\n\r\nSome
  of my thoughts:\r\n\r\n- The D looks weird\r\n- Is my X Valid?\r\n- Other ways to
  make the M, N and W ?\r\n- The S and the 5 look too much alike?\r\n- Help with Spacing"

    \"U\", which would look a bit like a lowercase \"n\"? Might work in such a font.
    Also, for the \"M\", I'd maybe try reducing the middle stem to one line (a bit
    like what you do in the \"B\").\r\n\r\nOne idea for the \"D\" (which I agree looks
    funky), although this would likely necessitate changes to other letters too: Have
    you tried giving it \"serifs\" on the left side \u2013 i.e. moving the left vertical
    stem a bit to the right and letting the top and bottom lines protrude out to the
    left? Don't know if it'd work, but it might be worth a try."

    makin it either 9 or 11 pixels in width; symmetry would get lot easier.\r\n\r\nD
    is weird, and N is only 7 pixels. X is cool; very Space Invaderish. \r\n\r\nMake
    numerals two pixels narrower, and you skip that problem.\r\n\r\nSpace the with
    two pixels, and things look a lot more natural. T,F,L and such only need one.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/nepofont_5187.png]"

  body: "Wow! Thanks for all the constructive criticism!\r\n\r\n@altaira - The Serif
    idea worked amazing! Thanks! I tried the flipped U but it does look like a lowercase
    N... in which case is invalid for the font.\r\n\r\nTomi from Suomi - Fixed the
    D, looks cool now. I liked the X as well, also thought of Space Invaders when
    i made it Hahaha. I'm going to increase width by 1px so that its 11px for the
    characters, then reduce the numbers to 9px width so the difference is more apparent.
    I'll check the spacing as well.\r\n\r\nCris B - Thanks Cris, thats good reference!
    -saved!\r\n\r\nHere's the Link to the 11px Width Nepo. - http://fontstruct.fontshop.com/fontstructions/show/nepo_11px\r\n\r\nI
    fixed the D, the M, N and W. Let me know what you think! :D\r\n\r\nSmall\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Nepo

  body: "this is not bad.\r\nI agree w/ cerulean. I think that putting the line for
    the \"Q\" on pointing up from the bottom would look good.\r\nAlso, you said you
    could only do uppercase characters, and I may have scrolled over this, but are
    you allowed to use descenders?"
