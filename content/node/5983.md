  body: Heinz Schumann&#39;s <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/urw/stentor/t/testdrive.html?s=farbband&amp;p=48"
    target="_blank">Stentor</a> has a similar feel, but without the quirky angularity.
    <BR> <BR>I&#39;ve skimmed through the Jaspert &#39;Encyclopaedia of Type Faces&#34;
    and that&#39;s about the closest I saw. I wonder if someone like Dieter Steffmann,
    who didgitizes a lot of German and old typefaces, has seen this one. I will try
    writing to him about it.

  body: Just heard back from Dieter Steffmann, and he says he has never seen it.   <BR>
    <BR>So now, once again, my lack of older European type books grinds my search
    to a halt. <BR> <BR>Sigh.
