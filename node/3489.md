body: Hola amigos typophiles, <BR> <BR>this is my first non latin greyscale pixel
  font. The challenge was to develope a Yummy bold caps font for titling, who can
  work well for Japanese language readers. <BR> <BR>If anyone can read or recognize
  if this first designs sketches works, maybe someone who know about Katakana or Hiragana,
  can make some critiques here..every help is welcome! <BR> <BR>Muchas gracias, <BR>

  body: Hi, Miguel. <BR> <BR>I&#39;m Japanese. It is a very pretty nice font. Is the
    resource of this font the sketch of the handwriting style? <BR>The font of the
    handwriting style is in fashion in Japan. <BR> <BR>Well, There are some wrong
    points. <BR> <BR>&#34;SU&#34;, &#34;SE&#34;, &#34;SO&#34;. The right-hand side
    upper part point &#40;Its name is &#34;DAKU-TEN&#34;&#41;  is unnecessary. <BR>Not
    &#34;ZU&#34;, &#34;ZE&#34;, &#34;ZO&#34;. <BR> <BR>&#34;HO&#34;, The top of right-hand
    side does not cross. It is not &#34;MA.&#34; <BR> <BR>And as my opinion, <BR>
    <BR>I cannot distinguish &#34;SO&#34; from &#34;N&#34;. <BR>Note that angle of
    stroke. Right-hand stroke of &#34;SO&#34; moves top to bottom, the other, stroke
    of &#34;N&#34; moves bottom to top. <BR>Although, Japanese people sometimes mistake.
    <BR> <BR>Distinction of &#34;SHI&#34; and &#34;TSU&#34; is good! <BR>Japanese
    people sometimes mistake too. <BR> <BR>&#34;NU&#34; and &#34;ME&#34; are too wide.
    <BR> <BR>&#34;GA&#34;, Upper double point &#34;DAKU-TEN&#34; should be most in
    right-hand side. <BR> <BR>from KYA,KYU,KYO to HYA,HYU,HYO <BR>Right-hand side
    character is too large. <BR> <BR> <BR>I am looking forward to completion of this
    font. <BR> <BR>

  body: 'It&#39;s nice, Miguel, but there&#39;s too much &#39;stylistic&#39; divergence
    between the Latin font and the Japanese fonts. The Latin font is squarish, geometric,
    clean, &#39;cool&#39;. The Japanese fonts, as Kunihiko said, look handwritten,
    maybe a bit &#39;childish&#39; too. <BR> <BR>I&#39;d try to make the Japanese
    fonts more squarish and geometric like the Latin, but that&#39;s a personal preference.
    They&#39;re still nice fonts in itself. <BR> <BR>&#42; &#42; &#42; &#42; &#42;
    <BR> <BR>I mostly agree with Okano&#39;s post, of course. <BR>And I&#39;d like
    to add that: <BR>- &#39;N&#39; &#40;h&#41; is too short, make it taller; <BR>-
    &#39;KA&#39; &#40;k&#41; is not just the &#39;KA&#39; &#40;h&#41; without the
    little stroke, the hiragana should be rounder/softer ; <BR>- the descending strokes
    of &#39;KO&#39;, &#39;RO&#39; and &#39;YO&#39; &#40;k&#41; are too long; <BR>-
    &#39;A&#39;, &#39;WA&#39; &#40;h&#41;, and &#39;TA&#39; &#40;k&#41; are too big;
    <BR>- &#39;YA&#39; &#40;both h and k&#41; is too small; <BR>- &#39;RU&#39; and
    &#39;RO&#39; &#40;k&#41; are too exaggerated. <BR>&#40;h=hiragana, k=katakana&#41;'

  body: '&#62; 1&#41; Where did you get the template - is it complete? <BR> <BR>Well,
    you can get this kind of template in any Japanese &#39;learning&#39; book. I think
    this template is complete, yes. <BR> <BR> <BR>&#62; 2&#41; Is Kanji really not
    needed? <BR> <BR>What do you mean? <BR>I guess this face is intended for some
    sort of &#39;small-size-display&#39; &#40;like interface buttons or something&#41;,
    and in this case you can choose to work only with Kana. I&#39;d say that when
    you have single words or pairs of words, you can use only Kana. But when you have
    a whole paragraph or sentence, you should use Kanji too. <BR>Both Kana alphabets
    are phonetic, so you can write anything &#40;that you&#39;d write with Kanji&#41;
    with them.'

  body: But is it &#34;socially unacceptable&#34;? In what contexts? <BR> <BR>-- <BR>
    <BR>BTW, Miguel, I&#39;m realizing that maybe there&#39;s too much color variance.
    Although Japanese text with Kanji does have an incredible amount of color variation,
    I suspect the Kana sets need to be more uniform? If so, I&#39;d try to compensate
    by making the strokes of the more complex letters thinner. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>

    words&#41;.  <BR> <BR>I think so too. <BR>In the case of a packaging design, Sometime,
    a brand name and company name may be displayed in kana. A font of only kana is
    popular. <BR> <BR>There are some fonts of only kana. <BR>for example... <BR>GrayGraphics&#40;FreeFont
    1byte&#41; <BR><a href="http://www.orange.ne.jp/~den7/index.html" target="_blank">http://www.orange.ne.jp/~den7/index.html</a>
    <BR> <BR>Almost all the fonts in this site consist of only kana. <BR>It is used
    as a display font. I use often. <BR> <BR>While, There is also a kana font which
    replaces full set Japanesefont&#39;s kana. <BR>For example, Adobe&#39;s Ryo is.
    <BR> <BR>Adobe Ryo &#40;PDF&#41; <BR><a href="http://www.adobe.co.jp/products/fontfolio/pdfs/ryo.pdf"
    target="_blank">http://www.adobe.co.jp/products/fontfolio/pdfs/ryo.pdf</a> <BR>This
    textsetting replaced Kozuka Mincho&#39;s kana with Ryo. <BR> <BR>&#62;One more
    thing.. any kerning text or  <BR>&#62;Pangram to start to write in japanese?  <BR>
    <BR>Kana may adjoin all characters. So, a huge quantity of a kerning pair is needed.
    It is infinitely. <BR>It is better to have been able to set without depending
    on kerning as much as possible. Therefore, in this case, it is better to equalize
    character width of this font. <BR>'
