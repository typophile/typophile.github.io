  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Heya, im brand new to typo so please be kind :)
basically im finishing school in a few weeks and would need to make a portfolio for the future. I have a few questions. so please answer what you can.

1. Whats the best way of printing for me laser or inkjet?
2. Whats the best in terms of quality for print and easy to edit(ability) save output on photoshop?
3. Can anyone recommend a good printer for under £100?
4. Can anyone recommend a good printers on the internet or in britain that is affordable and good quality?
5. Is it appropriate to write a page number at the bottom of a portfolio?
6.What is the best way to present a portfolio?
7.Is helvetica a good font to use in a portfolio? :/ (i know helvetica's good but it doesn't exactly show typographic knowledge)
8. How often should you update a portfolio?
9. What is the best dpi to print with? (i hear a lot about printing in 300dpi but is 600 better).
10. Should you provide extensive info about each project or keep it simple and clean?
11. What kind of contact details should a student provide? (Is a address appropriate?).

thankyou, please be nice im only 16.

-Oliver

1.) Inkjet has more tolerance for different stocks with a uniform quality. Laser does not.
2.) Consistency is a matter of choice I find Illustrator as the final assembly software provides the maximum opportunity, especially as it is very compatible with the PDF format which you will no doubt need.
3.) Choose either Epson or HP the two is a matter of size and price range for you. Some Epsons can print on CD/DVD's also.
4.) I do not know, but seldom recommend Online Printers. The best Customer service will be you best choice if this is your first time.
5.) Not really, you should be able to customize your showing based on the audience. Page numbers/folios are not useful for this approach.
6.) In a sturdy case or case binding. (Post binding is flexible)
7.) Helvetica is notoriously bad (difficult to read) with light weights in small sizes... it will all depend on size. This is an opportunity for you to form an opinion. Let me know what you settle on.
8.) At your age 4 times a year, as you get older you'll do it less. I promise.
9.) Prepare your files at 300 dpi for many applications, however the inkjet printers often do a good job with less.
10.) A sentence will suffice. Practice your speaking points for interviews to extend past that.
11.) These days an address is less valuable. Keep it digital. Phone and e-mail.
I have strong opinions that a card is inappropriate (for a student seeking employment). However, as a freelance designer the card is the ideal format for such contact info.

These are a lot of questions I hope I'm helpful. I'm trying to be nice, but I'm so old and challenged.

All the best.

Ow by the way im thinking Chapparel Pro (For any block of writing over a few sentences) and probably Avenir LT for just 1 liners.

I have just a few more questions if thats alright with you?

Is it more economical to print 250 full colour flyers from a home pc or send them to the printers? in your opinion.
also...
Is there anything i should need to know legally and just generally about becoming a freelancer?

Im thinking about this printer http://www.ebuyer.com/product/144880

thanks for your time.

Join a professional organization, to help navigate the business nd of the stick.
Probably sending it out is cheaper if it's a lot of ink.
The printer is ok...the printers at the apple store are a good guide for designers. This may not handle graphics well...It could be a business machine.

Fine type choices...you'll find it's all a matter of taste.

	<div class="card-body">
		<div class="commentbody">1. Inkjet. Even if you pay a good shop to do prints on a super-high-end Xante the colors will be screwed up.
2. Photoshop’s native file format.
3. No. Don’t print a portfolio on anything under $500 if you want to be taken seriously. 
4. -
5. Your portfolio should be customizable so you can show more relevant work for each job, so leave page numbers out to save time when rearranging.
6. In the format preferred by the managers of each employer. Find out what they like from someone else. Personally I use a $5.99 Muji plastic photo presentation album. People who don’t like it can kiss my ass, and people who know what it is adore me for buying Muji.
7. Yes, but use Neue Helvetica to look smart.
8. However often you have new work with using.
9. 300 DPI is fine, although if you have really amazing photographs and a 1200 DPI printer it won’t hurt to print at 1200 DPI. 
10. Don’t provide extensive detail unless you know that the job has very few applicants. In this economy design jobs get hundreds of applicants, and nobody has time to read long explanations. You can use longer explanations in print than online—I have had several people tell me they did not like the amount of text on my web site and so I cut back.
11. The URL of your online portfolio (you need a real URL, deviantart etc. are NOT professional!), email address, phone number, and permanent mailing address.</div>

I got through school with an epson c82. It was great. They probably have a similar low-end model nowadays. No matter how cheap your printer is you're still going to spend a ton on ink.

<cite>4. Can anyone recommend a good printers on the internet or in britain that is affordable and good quality?</cite>
Don't know much about printers over there but if you're looking for an offset printer I can recommend Beacon Press in Uckfield. I spent a week there last year printing a sustainability report and they were really great.

<cite>8. How often should you update a portfolio?</cite>
You want to keep your portfolio as flexible as possible. Like James said, you're going to want to be able to shuffle things around. This includes being able to add new things easily.

<cite>Is it more economical to print 250 full colour flyers from a home pc or send them to the printers?</cite>
It's going to be cheapest to send them to a digital printer.

<cite>Is there anything i should need to know legally and just generally about becoming a freelancer?</cite>
Too much. Good luck, = ).</div>

		<div class="commentbody">That’s not the kind of work that’s going to land you commercial jobs because most people aren't going to be interested in your technical experiments regardless of quality. Do a series of flyers and posters to go with the dance buttons and you might be able to land some work for bands and djs. The don't pay much (if at all), but it will let you build up a portfolio of actual commercial work and they might recommend you to people who will pay you.

It could work for getting into a school, however, because an admissions counselor might be impressed that you are experimenting with color theory and composition of your own volition, something art students tend to grouse about all freshman year.</div>

Are you asking because you are thinking of sending out flyers to prospective employers? If so, I think you will be throwing your money away. That type of advertising almost never works. The best way to get a job is to go door to door, introduce yourself, and ask if there is a possibility of making an appointment to show your portfolio to the person who does the hiring. Fifty visits of this type will be more productive than 250 flyers mailed out, or dropped off at places.</div>
