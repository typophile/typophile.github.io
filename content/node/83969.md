body: "I snapped a picture of this cast-iron grave slab (with my iphone, hence the
  crap quality, tried clearing it up a bit) while visiting the cathedral at Str\xE4ngn\xE4s,
  Sweden.\r\n\r\nThere are two names and a date, all in a sort of flared, glyphic
  style I guess imitating stone carving, and below that text I honestly can't decipher
  due to the rusting. And at the very top there's another text, saying \"MEMENTO MORI\",
  in a style which, well, take a look:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/fff_5144.jpg]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/jjjjjj_3963.jpg]\r\n\r\nIs
  this really from 1696?"

  body: I've been led to believe that lettering or inscriptional lettering in this
    style (ie. monoline, thin sans) did not exist that far back. Or have I misread
    something?

  body: 'I have no elements to agree or disagree. What I note: it tries to keep Trajan
    proportions and uses old Roman abbreviation system. Memento mori is Latin for
    "Remember you will die". Die is "day" and after 27 the word faded probably indicates
    the month in Latin numerals.'

  body: "The fact that this is cast iron leads me to believe that it is genuine. Imagine
    the technique required to produce this if it were done with a sand form. The craftsman
    would use a template (a blank slate with bevels and such), and paste the letterform
    onto that (maybe using rolled bits of clay \u2014 tightening up forms as needed
    wit a quick slash of a knife). Makes it feasible that doing serifs and other refinements
    was out of the scope of the persons\u2019 capabilities or even not very economical.\r\nMaster
    pushed into sand. Melted iron poured into that. Presto.\r\n\r\n@oldnick: Stone
    doesn\u2019t come into this : )\r\n\r\nAnecdotal: sans styles have been around
    before serif styles\u2026"

  body: "That makes a lot of sense as an explanation. I'm surprised there aren't many
    more \"sans serif\" letters from that era though. \r\n\r\nI do really like the
    Roman proportions on this, it makes it feel very 1920s neoclassical. :)"

title: The date "1696" on this surely can't be correct?
