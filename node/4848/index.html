  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Hi all. I could use some help - I&#39;ve been working on the redesign of a sports magazine, along with the redesign the title is changing as well. Here are a few masthead designs. The client initially wanted to empahsize the word &#34;Tennis&#34; and downplay &#34;US&#34;, now they want to see more of a balance between the words. Red and Blue will probably be the main color palette, however it may change from issue to issue depending upon the cover art. With that in mind the flag &#34;E&#34; versions might not work in a different color combo. Please, your thoughts on which of these is working. Am I turning it into too much of a logo? One big concern is it should not look similar to Tennis Magazine. see bottom attachment. One final note the magazine only goes to subscribers, it&#39;s not for sale on newsstands. <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/36351.jpg" alt="masthead 1"> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/36352.jpg" alt="masthead 2"> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/36353.jpg" alt="masthead 3"> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/36354.jpg" alt="masthead 4"> <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/36355.jpg" alt="tennis magazine logo"></div>

I think the &#34;E&#34; is less important than the other letters. Even if it was an empty space there &#40;please don&#39;t take that as a suggestion&#41; the word would still read as Tennis.

		<div class="commentbody">Thanks for the suggestions. I reworked the first two mastheads. I liked the interlocking letters and tried an extended version of the letterforms to give it a little more weight. I also created a version with the US and Tennis on one line, not interlocked. On the second masthead &#40;of the original post&#41; I lost the flag E and played with adding a graphic element to the type &#40;a ball&#41; I&#39;ll have to try this on some covers, not sure if the ball will be confusing with other balls that may be in the cover art. Final version I used a dot instead of a photographic ball.  <BR> <BR>Am I heading in the right direction with these? <BR>-Kirsten <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/36441.jpg" alt="masthead version 2.1"> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/36442.jpg" alt="masthead version 2.2"> <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/36443.jpg" alt="masthead version 2.3"> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/36444.jpg" alt="masthead version 2.4"> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/36445.jpg" alt="masthead version 2.5"></div>

		<div class="commentbody">I quickly worked on one of Andrew&#39;s suggestions. Attached is the serif interlocked version with a modified T. What I had liked about the version I first did was that the serif in the T also acted as the negative inner curve of the s  - which is squareish. Perhaps that&#39;s one of those design ideas that works in your head and not on paper. The modified T is sort of working but isn&#39;t quite there yet. Perhaps the rest of the letters need some adjustments as well or perhaps I should play with some other fonts. I also think version 5 of second posting with the yellow dot has merit too will work on both and post again soon.  <BR>-Kirsten <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/36458.jpg" alt="masthead version 3.1"></div>

		<div class="commentbody">Perhaps just me, but in the interlocking versions &#40;less with the serifs chopped&#41; I find the lower curve of the S tends to combine with the upstroke of the T to make a P shape, so I see both Tennis and Pennis. I much prefer the simpler versions. I think I&#39;d say &#34;What is the interlocking really adding?&#34;. For me at least its just adding confusion.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Thanks for all the terrific input.  <BR> <BR>a couple of specific concerns which were brought up that I didn&#39;t previously address:  <BR>It has to be US not U.S. <BR>The color choice right now is the Association&#39;s color palette. However, depending upon the cover artwork, the colors most likely will change from month to month. <BR> <BR>Here are three more designs. <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/36519.jpg" alt="masthead version 4"> <BR>  <BR>I find the ball inbetween the two &#34;N&#34;s creates a bull&#39;s eye effect in a part of the word that doesn&#39;t need the attention. I&#39;m sure there&#39;s some kind of interesting treatment to do to the double &#34;N&#34;s, I&#39;m just not hitting upon it. <BR> <BR>The 2nd and 3rd designs are essentially the same just one is outlined and the other is not. The client likes outlines, but it&#39;s use will more likely be determined by what else is on the cover.  <BR> <BR>I liked Garage Gothic from versions #3-5 of second posting but now I&#39;m thinking it looks too soft for a masthead.  <BR> <BR>What are the forums&#39; thoughts - on font choice? on keeping or droping the dot?  &amp; etc.? <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR></div>

		<div class="commentbody">kirsten -- what if the soft typeface were used &#40;as in that bottom version minus the feathers&#41;? could it act as a nice contrast to which ever typeface you do use as coverlines etc? It might allow for more versatility, ergo use of slabs, grots or even a heavier serif. hmmm. and it really is friendly.  <BR> <BR>however, and i&#39;m NOT a tennis fan or aficionado &#40;ok, guilty pleasure watch agassi&#41; but i do perceive that they want to be taking just as seriously as any other sport, so to make it too soft and cuddly could be bad.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">First, thank you all for your ideas and comments. After spending quite a bit of time in Border&#39;s magazine section I realized I was trying to do too much with this. Simplified the sans serif and slab versions. Did keep one version with the reversed N. I felt it illustrates the head-to-head competion of tennis. However &#40;and especially because it is an N&#41; I doubt I&#39;ll end up using it because it will be too similar to the Nine Inch Nails symbol.  <BR> <BR>The forum seemed split between the slab and the sans so I&#39;ll probably show both to the client. Funny I was favoring the slab, but now I like the sans with no space between the US and Tennis or the all blue with yellow dot version. Keep it simple.  <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/36678.jpg" alt="masthead version 6"></div>

		<div class="commentbody">I like the third from the top and the 5th from the top. However, the yellow ball is begging for its seams back.&#40;not the photographic version, but a simple graphic rendering would probably do. The addition of the seems would also imply motion which would be a good bonus.&#41; <BR> <BR>Have You tried an all Green Version?  <BR> <BR>Honestly, by having a specific set of colors you are potentially limiting your graphic pallette down the road.  <BR> <BR>What happens when you have a beautiful photograph that has a blue&#40;or Red&#41;background? You might feel the need to change the colors of your logotype.  <BR> <BR>I was always told that a logo should be able to work in black and white 1st, and color 2nd. <BR> <BR>You might want to try some versions with solid colors throughout. <BR> <BR>ps.Forth from the top feels Swedish.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Hi, I&#39;m back again with another revision to this masthead. It&#39;s negative space around the ball not a white line, so when the masthead is on top of the art, the art will show through. The colors will be dependant upon the cover photo/illus., but in looking over past issues, these were colors that were frequently used. I steered away from putting a seam on the tennis ball for two reasons 1. Tennis magazine used a seamed tennis ball as the dot over the &#34;i&#34; for about 25 years prior to their recent logo redesign. and 2. The more litteral ball depiction &#40;with seam&#41; looks odd when the ball is in a color other than yellow. <img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/37958.jpg" alt="masthead with dot e"> <BR>&#34;US&#34; looks a little tight to me and &#34;NI&#34; a little loose. Do you agree? Or should I tighten TENNIS to match US? And does anyone feel the perfect circle doesn&#39;t jive with the imperfect soft Garage font? I tried using period from the font as the ball but it looks like a mis-shapen blob to me.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Kirsten, I don&#39;t want to sound crazy, but I feel that having the circle on the E makes it look like a clowns nose. I kind of liked the circle as a divider between the two words. Maybe it is just that simple. A monochtomatic logo with a simple circle in between the two words implying transition, movement, and of course the tennis ball.</div>
