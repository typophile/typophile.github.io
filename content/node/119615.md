    a Lost Type typeface called Liberator on their site, so I thought maybe they used
    another Lost Type offering for Amelia. \r\n\r\nSo far, no matches.\r\n\r\nHopefully
    some other forum member will recognize it or know if it is a bespoke typeface."

    body: Wow, very good eye!!! I think you nailed it perfectly. Thank you so much
      for your help! The 'S' was was bothering me on this on since it was missing
