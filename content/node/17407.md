body: Are my eyes crooked or are the descender of <em>q</em>'s slightly shorter then
  that of the <em>p</em>'s? It is quite striking with strong serifs such as slab serifs.
  Try Clarendon for exemple and tell me if you also see this!

  body: Clarendon certainly looks even to me, and in FontLab, the descenders are equal.
    Are you by any chance looking at this on-screen, where hinting might be screwed
