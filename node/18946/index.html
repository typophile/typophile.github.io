  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">I am currently working on the design of a photography book on gay parades.
All photos are black and white and all photos are portraits of gay men (from the drag to the handsome boy and the big guy with piercing and moustache...). 
The cover should be mainly black and white and I am currently experimenting with different typefaces.
It should not be to "sombre", too dramatic or to circensian, also not too grotesque...
I'm trying to find the perfect typeface, one that evokes celebration but it's sober at the same time...and one which reflects the context (gay, diversity, celebration...)but not in an obvious way...
Any suggestion? Please?
Thanks!!</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I was working on some materials for a pride organization a while ago and ran into a similar dearth of options. While some faces might be historically appropriate (based on designer, philosophy, or geographics) they didn't communicate what was needed. The creative director eventually settled on something futuristic because it fit our mission statement of "looking forward," though it wasn't to my personal liking, so I won't recommend it here.

Have you considered the option of having something custom-lettered? It sounds like you have a clear enough idea of what you're looking for to give some good direction and, with a photography book, you're probably just using lettering for headings and titling, right?</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Now, now...that was quite an interesting little brainstorming. Thanx everyone. I am trying to avoid being literal here, I'm not looking for a typeface that looks "gay"...( whatever that means)but I thought it would be cool to "honour the content" as Bringhurst says (or was it someone else?)and use a typeface designed by a gay person or that has some kind of androgynous feel (or at least avoid a major gaffe by using some catholic, puritan typeface (I guess there are loads around). It's more what Mich431 wrote: something that is historically, philosophically appropriate.
I'll have a look at the suggestion you guys gave me and see if that works. Thanx a lot and keep posting. </div>

I don't know about gay, but there is a typeface that looks androgynous, and has been used to great effect in a book about a transvestite artist ("John Kelly", typeset by Pentagram-NY) - that font is FF Avance by Bloemsma, and it's not difficult to see why it works so well for that.

Well I say I like Futura extra light really really big printed in a fifth colour or maybe I could use one of those lovely butch Grotesques by the Font Bureau or Hoefler & Frere-Jones. But then again I am rather taken by Mr Dardens new creations, just need a place to use them.

		<div class="commentbody">my two cents:

I agree with dan_reynolds. I think that choosing a face that "looks" gay might be the worst thing you could do. I am a believer in connecting the text or content with the look of the type, but, I do believe that the gay community has far too many stereotypical labels as it is. You might accidentally irritate one that you were unaware of. In choosing a typeface that was designed by a gay designer, you could debut this somewhere cleverly, by citing the designer, and relating a little about his life as a "gay" typographer. I suppose that many people would not find this, or they would not care, but I think this subtler approach at connecting content with type is far better then choosing something that "looks" gay.</div>

No: I am NOT looking for a font that "looks gay" but for a typeface that can contribute to the spirit of the project, which is to emphasise DIVERSITY and "OTHERNESS" (That's for you fontplayer!). I appreciate the input, William Berkson, but fonts like "hairspray" for example, is not what I had in mind, I'm afraid. That would be a huge stereotype. 
What I could do is to play with 2 different fonts, like using a classic one and then insert something completely different to subvert it a little, like insert something hand-made to give it a human touch...dunno...would that give the idea?</div>

If you were to force me to answer (c'mon, make me!)... I'd say for gender ambiguity/shifting/borrowing, I've always liked Bodoni (or anything closely related) because of the contrast in line, the Masculine/Feminine, the sort of posed-ness of it. 

If you're addressing both lesbians and gays, I really like Rockwell because it is playful and hits both crowds well.

		<div class="commentbody">Rockwell? Really? I Thought it was one of these typefaces reminiscent of American Highschool/collegea bit like Princeton? Or am I totally out of my mind? Isn't it why they used it for the Kings and Queens' book in the first place...?[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Rockwell.gif]

(thanx for the link)...dunno...a bit too geometric, maybe. In fact, farao does have this american-highschool-feel too, there's a version of farao that really looks like princeton. Coincidence? [img:sites/default/files/old-images/farao college.png] 

(I like it though...)But Bodoni, you can't go wrong with it, can you?

I am getting quite attached to this Coolvetica by Ray Larabie...for some reason, it's kind of simple but it's got a little twist, which is probably why I liked it. 

[img:sites/default/files/old-images/coolvetica.gif]

Any opinion about that one? (forget about the pinky flowery thing...it's not because of this that I think it might fit...)
Thanx!

Perhaps "new", "forward thinking", or simply "open", as opposed to "old" and "closed" or "traditional." Maybe that's the key. Don't ask what it should be... ask what it shouldn't be.

I like the idea too, of ultra thin Helvetica, or something along those lines. A cover? Lately I've been a huge fan of Bernhard Fashion - in an all caps setting though. Take something from Avant Garde ligatures too maybe? Voila.

Of course, this is all sooooo subjective... Especially here, with "The Nerds." (I mean that in the best way.)

If that was the only strange thing they tried to foist upon me, then as long as we don't talk about the sky, I could have a nice conversation. (because I have found that the lime-green sky people can be very nice, otherwise)</div>

I'd say on the contrary that in living a life that resists cultural sterotypes gays might be forced to cultivate more empathy. I'd hardly call the evangelical bigots that run my country (USA) either empathetic or moral. Or compassionate.</div>

Not an irrational vice, certainly.
But the more one strays outside one's village, the more it's counter-productive.

Why? Typographers spec type for all kinds of readers who they may or may not have anything in common with. A professional opinion is different from a "focus group" opinion.

Having said that, I don't believe that there is such a thing as an inherently gay type, or that sexuality should be prescribed by cultural norms, although it does become associated with them, in the form of stereotypes and cliches.

It's in the context of specific usage that typographic form acquires meaning.</div>

Good point.

And Graham, what if you're creating a design for starving Africans?
You're going to round up some type designers from amongst them?!  :-/

> It’s in the context of specific usage that typographic form acquires meaning.

Although I don't believe there's a specific shape that
conveys "homosexual", this is certainly unrealistic.

Shapes, like colors, do have inherent meanings. Red means things that green doesn't; an inverted triangle means things that a circle doesn't. This is simply because we live in a physical world with certain fixed attributes, and furthermore we interpret this world with a brain wired in a fixed way. We're not abstract beings living in an aether.

i don't believe these meanings are "inherent." i believe that these are culturally learned and vary from individual to individual. just like to me farao can say sexy while to lorenza it says goofy. it's like those commercials that show an image of an wrinkled woman and overlay words like: old, wise, frail, beautiful, &c, highlighting that we can all see different things in the same thing.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">OK, enough lurking for me... The typeface, in the case of a book cover, can COMPLETELY dictate the meaning of the words. There was a great ad in cmyk magazine a few years ago from a student for a type foundry, the gist was that if you set the words "will you marry me?" in a horror typeface it changed the meaning quite signifigantly.
I choose not to lob an opinion on the "gay" issue, or the "beer" issue, although I find it ironic they are coexisting. I am Junged out right now with joseph campbell's "hero of a thousand faces" and I get less sympathetic with each read.
At some point, someone mentioned American typewriter, and I am inclined *ahem to agree.
[img:sites/default/files/old-images/American Typewriter Test.png]
IMHO the photography has to speak, so let the flavor of the images dictate to you how they want to be represented. Don't hot-button the gay thing.

		<div class="commentbody">Yes... You are correct. Written language is fairly rigid when put beside the spoken word. Inflections on the spoken word can purposely alter the perception of a statements meaning, with the intention of actually say one thing while meaning another. I suppose I am being a bit pedantic(?) about it, but I put that down to my acerbic nature. It isn't too good to focus upon one narrow section and block out the surrounding information. As, after reviewing the previous messages on this thread, I seem to have done.

Unfortunately we dont have the emotive variety available to us in the typefaces that we can produce vocally. Maybe we can come up with some emotion accents to add in the new opentype format :) Sounds like a challenge to me.

To get back to the book, I feel a typeface that looks festive and partylike, while retaining a clear visual readability would probably suit.

Yes, I did call it A GAY TYPEFACE? because I wanted to draw some attention to the forum but I think it was pretty obvious that I wasn't looking for a "spiteful, frivoulous and sophisticated" font...I mean nobody can seriously think it is possible to give fonts human attributes, right? 
However I do agree that you can somehow subvert the meaning of a text with the use (or misuse) of a specific font style. You can't probably change the meaning but you can affect the reading experience. Nothing new about it. 
Party celebration, festive is all useful not because of the cliche of gays dancing at the sound of Abba but because it is about GAY PARADES. But I am so not convinced about typewriters...I really don't get it.</div>

Like a typeface can be gay. I've used a few fonts that were trying to poke parts of themselves where they don't belong in another letter, but that was a quality problem.

That why it reminded me about the joke: "Is that chair saved?" ...

But one problem is I failed to note the obvious; that there might be a lot of gays in graphic design. I madew a few off-hand comments, and then I had to dig a deeper hole, so to speak, trying to explain something.

I was trying to examine my thoughts on the matter this morning, and realized, that aside from any moral issues involved, my gut feeling is that male gayness is disgusting to me (if I start trying to imagine). Not much I can do about that. But a female being attracted to a female is not. Women are soft and cuddly. Who wouldn't want to get with that? - This is mainly to clarify how I personally feel, not to instigate a bunch of people to gang up on me.

On the other hand, if I keep on going this thread could pass the Typophile Beta Bug Report in number of responses. 

But back to the matter of fonts, I saw these heavy Bodoni variations in another thread which I couldn't find (I looked up the links in browser history), but I think they looked great for a festive titling. I even had two of them. See what you think:

* Although this should ideally extend to speaking your mind whether the
group/person in question is present or not (although I admit that can be hard).

And really, nobody should feel guilty for his emotions. But we are all responsible for our actions, so for example not giving somebody a job (at least one that isn't inherently heterosexual) because some aspect of his own emotions disgusts you is not good. Human society cannot be harmonious under such draconian standards.

Agreed, and I am capable of forgetting about that aspect of a person in order to hang and work, although I haven't been challenged with anyone "over the top".

You mean the photos? it probably won't give you an idea because the great thing about it is the diversity of types, all sort of people, pretty, ugly, dressed up, totally normal...I do admire people that fight for their rights and go through a sometimes quite painful process until they actually come out. </div>

But much better than hiding it (which I'm
sure is the case with many people here).

Progress relies on open communication,
and open minds, but not covert feelings.

Better for whom? Yourself. Otherwise, it's assuming the
the person in front of you is in fact the intolerant one.
Tolerance is much much more than fake civility. Just
observe the mess the Netherlands is in now - and it was
triggered by a completely irrelevant incident! It was all
a veneer, all this time. That to me is disgusting.

I'd like to clarify that I didn't say that. I do like some gays. Just like I like some of those WASPs. My real judgementalism comes from other traits like people who prey on the helpless, and men who beat up on women, etc.

Oddly, much of the worst untempered condemnation of gays is from Christians, who can't hang with people who they consider "sinners". Which is ludicrous, in that it ignores the glaring fact they are (continue to be) sinners too. And as if hatred & hypocrisy are represetative of God's love. (see white-washed tomb analogy)</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I recently used <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/emigre/suburban/">Suburban Bold</a> for a jewellery fashion promotion aimed at gay men and women. You might find it too circensian (thank you for introducing me to that word btw) or working against the photography, my use was for type only. It strikes me that thin faces or didones might be too "fashion". <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/ef/clarendon/">Clarendon</a> might be a more solid alternative.

I think we are getting really close here...thanks for that. Tim: true that thin faces can be too fashion, I hadn't thought of that. Very useful stuff, thanx.
That suburban bold is interesting although some rightly say that I shouldn't use a font that compete too much with the images and maybe this one tends to get too close to an image (sorry I can't explain that too well)...look at the Y for example. </div>
