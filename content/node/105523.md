  body: 'Excellent! Thank you. Base on that knowledge, two very different digital
    versions: http://www.myfonts.com/person/Douglas_C_McMurtrie/ Pity they both lack
    the graceful stricture of the metal type. :)'

  body: "SG & RR digitizations both acceptable in my opinion. If you prefer a more
    hairline effect go for the RR. If you prefer less contrast go for SG.\r\nTo compare
    with original check the <a href=\"http://archive.org/details/LudlowTypefacesEditionD1140
    \"> Ludlow Typefaces </a> book at archive.org. Ultra Modern regular and bold is
    at pages 166 to 169. Note that Ludlow also produced an italic.\r\nDon"
