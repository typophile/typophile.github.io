body: My friend Neven has just finished the new version of his <a href="http://mrgan.com/isaac"
  target="_blank">Isaac</a> file and directory browser. <BR>It&#39;s a really handy
  tool for web photo galleries, even if you have them in multiple directories. No
  geekness required to configure it - all you have to do is edit 2 or 3 lines and
  drop it in your pictures dir. <BR>And it also lists other file types! <BR> <BR>Just
  spreading the word... <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"
