  body: Cheers Lex, but that font doesn't seem to have that 'worn' look of the one
    I've posted. I can't seem to find the name of this anywhere...!

  body: "Actually, if the \"worn look\" were made with Photoshop, it would have looked
    better! ;-)\r\n(Here the same letters have the same exact look. So, either someone
    modified the Bernhard MT font file, or modified single letters and then pasted
    them together.)"

  body: "It seems that this design calls for the rubber stamp look.\r\nFrom the description
    at MyFonts:\r\n<cite>The outlines of the capital and lowercase alphabets are slightly
    roughened and the edges rounded, giving it the appearance of being rubber stamped.</cite>\r\n\r\nTwo
    examples, sadly not the right ones.\r\nhttp://new.myfonts.com/fonts/paratype/bernhard/pt-bernhard-rough/\r\nhttp://www.dafont.com/raven.font"
