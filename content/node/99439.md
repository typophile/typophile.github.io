  body: 'Reminds me of this [[http://www.typophile.com/node/95364|previous discussion]]
    about a Max Bill clock typeface. Could also be a specific typeface never digitized.
    Anyway, some suggestions for similars or base fonts to customize (hardest work
    would be on /4) [[http://www.typophile.com/node/95364#comment-518376|here]]. '
