    googled:\r\nfeijoa font\r\nfeijoa typeface\r\nfeijoa \"set in\"\r\nfeijoa body
    text\r\n\r\nI searched through lots of blogs, forums, etc and picked up additional
    clues to see who's been using Feijoa.  And that led me to these two samples.\r\n\r\nTherese
    also wrote: \"This reeks of someone on the payroll.\"\r\n\r\nHave you ever listened
    to a band that was so good you told your friends they HAD to listen to them?\r\n\r\nHave
    you ever seen a movie that moved you so much that you told your friends they HAD
    to see it and that you'd be willing to go with them to see it again?\r\n\r\nHave
    you ever read a book that blew you away so much that you bought several copies
    for your friends and family?\r\n\r\nNow: did that band or that movie studio or
    that author ever send you a paycheck in the mail to thank you for your unsolicited
    efforts in marketing their product?\r\n\r\n\"Marketing your product\", you might
    say, \"sounds so clinical and cold.  No, no, I just got so excited about it, I
    just wanted to share it with other people and encourage them to support you so
    that your company can keep making stuff of this quality into the far future. The
    last thing I want you to do is stop what you're doing because you weren't able
    to make a living off of it.\"\r\n\r\nIt's in that spirit that I hunted down samples
    of Feijoa via google and clues left on various typography forums, blogs, etc.
    and in that spirit that I made this post to encourage people to license Feijoa
    so that Kris can keep doing what he loves and we can be benefactors in the future
    of his amazing creativity.\r\n\r\nAlso, I haven't yet mentioned the fact that
    I'm a writer so I'm also coming at it from the angle of an artist supporting another
    artist's work.  \r\n\r\nI'm not on Kris's payroll.  My evangelism for his work
    is simply an extension of my gratitude for his creative efforts.\r\n\r\n(Don't
    you know a few people who are evangelistic about a certain computer company with
    the logo of a fruit who are crazy about that company, buy everything from that
    company, love to talk smack about that company's biggest competitor, though none
    of these die-hard fanatics have ever received an evangelism paycheck from Mr.
    Jobs?)\r\n\r\nRahim\r\n"
