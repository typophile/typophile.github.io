  been working on this for two months now, so I wanted to gather some additional critique
  before I start with the bold cut.\r\n<blockquote class=\"imageWrap\" href=\"http://imgur.com/56AF0\"><img

    be a bit less steep, and the spacing of closing \xAB is too tight."

  body: "Proportions generally look good!\r\nThe horizontals of /E/F/L/T/ may be a
    little too stiff?\r\nI don't get the ear on the /8/.\r\nThe varying near-horizontal
    angles on the bottom half of /g/ get kind of noisy.\r\nFor this style, I think
    a little horizontal connector at the join of /k/K/ might be suitable.\r\n/e/ may
    be a little too tightly wound in the middle."

  body: "Don't start with the bold cut yet.\r\n\r\nBowls of /a/ and /e/ should be
    about the same size. I would make the bowl of /e/ larger.\r\n\r\nThe tails on
    /h l n/ don't make sense unless you carry it through in the entire font.\r\n\r\n/g/
    needs to be cleaner.\r\n\r\nThe stroke endings on /v w x y/ just don't do it for
    me.\r\n\r\nCrossbar of /f/ and /t/ could be longer (to the right)\r\n\r\nCaps
    need to be cleaner. /H U/ are too narrow. /V/ is too wide.\r\n\r\nThe ascender
    on /t/ is a bit too tall IMO.\r\n\r\nYou have too many different concepts going
    on. For example the dots on /i j/, the dot in the /zero/ and the dots on /divided
    by/ are all different. A typeface needs to express unity.\r\n\r\nGood luck!\r\n\r\nCheers,
    jasper\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Thanks guys! \r\n@1996type:\r\nRegarding the tails of /h l n/, I had them
    on more letters previously but on some characters the looked forced and introduced
    spacing issues ( e.g. /i f/ )\r\nBut you're right about the points, I changed
    them on the /i j/ but forgot to mirror that change across the other chars"
