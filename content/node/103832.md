body: "Hello all\r\n\r\nSlightly odd question; I'm going in cold to a client briefing
  for a redesign of their annual research publication. Currently they use a combination
  of Umbra for headers, Swift for body and Verlag for anything else.\r\n\r\nMy understanding
  is they want a major overhaul but I don't know where they want to go typographically
  - so I'm fishing a little.\r\n\r\nCan anyone make some alternate suggestions, pairing
  options or suggest contemporary 'versions's or fonts inspired by the above? I'm
  anticipating they may want to keep one or more to maintain branding - so if they
  retain Umbra (which is a big statement font) can you recommend options to pair with
  it?\r\n\r\nAny thoughts gratefully received!\r\n\r\nthanks\r\n"

    to appear highly font-savvy during your meeting, frankly it might too late. :-/
    \ Get some details, buy some time, ask here again. But hopefully do give credit
    where due.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "yep taken onboard. Thinking here is really if they say we want to keep one
    of the set, my question is why change any of the others? The design is very much
    based on the use of the shadow of umbra (i.e. the sheared serif of swift) and
    the graphic elements are all based on that - so I wanted to have a convincing
    argument to make wholesale changes.\r\n\r\nMy thoughts at the moment is that given
    the art deco feel of the current set we move them on to the next decade of style
    fonts. I was thinking maybe an inline font like (H&F's) landmark might be one
    way forward.\r\nThoughts?\r\n"

    be a major consideration in choosing the typeface.
