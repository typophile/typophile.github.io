  body: 'That page was my personal project and unfortunately I cannot maintain it
    anymore. It only had one Python macro on it, which did not quite work on FontLab
    Studio 5 anyway. I hope that with FontLab Studio 6, we can simply include more
    useful Python macros right with the app. '

    did a great job on those and there\u2019s nothing similar out there. "

  body: "Christoph, Arno, \r\n\r\nthe content on e-font.de is the most up-to-date
    content available. This page was originally developed by Andreas Eigendorf (who
    runs e-font.de), I helped him, I first hosted it on dev.fontlab.net but now he
    is hosting it. Of course we do have plans... etc. :/ I hope those get realized.
