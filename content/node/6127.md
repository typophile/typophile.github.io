  body: 'Thanks to answer Dan, <BR> <BR>Question No. 1: Oh yes it is!  <BR> <BR>-Nice
    to know. <BR> <BR>Question No. 2: It can be, especially when one considers where
    to submit/not to submit one&#39;s typefaces for possible sale.  <BR> <BR>-Especially
    important if you want to think about build your own indie foundry, and follow
    the demand on public font customer tendencies. <BR> <BR>Question No. 3: I am not
    aware of any statistics other than the best seler lists &#40;links posted below&#41;
    <BR> <BR>-It looks like there are not a statistics about best seller foundries
    and fonts..i wish to be wrong..because this stats can be useful! <BR> <BR>Question
    No. 4: This sounds vague. Can you be more specific with your question? The selling/marketing/buying
    of typefaces does change dramatically over time, not in the least because of technological
    changes. <BR> <BR>-Type selling demands changes in time? if changes dramatically,
    how are these changes in the last 50 years? BTW i was not thinking about technological
    changes.. <BR> <BR>mh.'

  body: 'Miguel, it will be exactly the technological changes in the industry that
    will change the way fonts are bought and sold over the next 50 years, IMHO. <BR>
    <BR>The Internet for instance. 15 years ago, we didn&#39;t use it. Today, the
    multitude of good &#40;and bad&#41; indy foundriesis only possible because of
    its buisness. FontShop predates the interent: they used mail order catalogues
    to sell fonts when they first started up. Jonathan Hoefler sold custome typefaes
    directly to his New York clients, and then put out a catalog. The internet made
    it easier for the people where were not Eric Spiekermann or Jonathan Hoefler to
    launch small businesses and reach customers directly and cheaply. <BR> <BR>It
    was Free fonts, over the internet, that perhaps destroyed the independent existence
    of a few of the larger type sellers/foundries. <BR> <BR>In 50 years, I&#39;m sure
    that we&#39;ll see several changes that will impact our lives and business just
    as much as the internet has.'
