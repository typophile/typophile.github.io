  know I tired you with all those theatrical posters&#41;. <BR> <BR>The customers
  already chose this solution; sorry,  <BR>there was no time to show you the roughs  <BR>&#40;I
  had only two days&#41;. But, even now, just before  <BR>I send it to the printer,
  I would like to hear your comments. <BR> <BR>The play '

    but soft under the roots. <BR> <BR>BTW, Aristophanes was the man. <BR> <BR>hhp

    it? You are  <BR>everywhere and always have something  <BR>substantial to write.
    <BR> <BR>I am flatered of your comments, but when  <BR>you write &#34;Aristophanes
    was the man.&#34;,  <BR>what do you mean?  <BR>And the last question: do you recognize  <BR>the
    frog&#39;s legs in the tree roots?'

  body: '&#62; how do you make it? <BR> <BR>It comes and goes. Soon I&#39;ll need
    to recede a bit. <BR> <BR>Everybody should read the Aristophanes comedies. They
    reveal how little has changed. They reveal for example that there can be no New
    World Order imposed from one end of the globe onto the other. The Greeks struck
    a great balance, they were actually as much easterners as westerners &#40;unlike
    the Romans who were essentially the first true westerners&#41;, and Aristpophanes
    embodies that so well, and in such an entertaining manner! He was a unique genius.
    I remember how almost 8 years ago I arrived at the Epidaurus theater in the Peloponnese
    a day late to catch an Aristophanes play - I&#39;m still kicking myself. <BR>
    <BR>&#62; do you recognize the frog&#39;s legs in the tree roots? <BR> <BR>The
    problem is you told me/us what they were, so I couldn&#39;t have missed that!
    :-/ Looking back, I can only guess, but I think they&#39;re OK. Plus you don&#39;t
    need to be too literal. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>'

  body: It&#39;s a very nice poster, Christos. <BR>All those names and the big logo
    in the middle of the poster disturbs a little, but that doesn&#39;t matter. <BR>Colors
    and type are great. I don&#39;t have much more to say, the visual metaphor is
    beautiful. ;-&#41;
