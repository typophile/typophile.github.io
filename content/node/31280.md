body: "I just modified an Adobe font for a client for their in-house use. But then
  they asked me to work on two weights of Helvetica. Of course I said I think that's
  not allowed & sure enough that's right. So then I asked my fine pals at FontShop
  about this & they told me that; yes, almost everybody wants to either prohibit that
  now or do that work themselves - which is their perogative. But I still have this
  client & I am bound to ask on their behalf: \r\n\r\n- If they bought the font before
  the EULA changed and can prove it, where am I?\r\n- Can you think of a Helvetica-alike
  with at least two weights whose EULA is more Adobe/Shinn type like? I would prefer
  they used an indie font anyway. \r\n- What if they buy various Helveticas from Adobe?
  Does the Adobe EULA apply?\r\n\r\nCertainly if there is no legal way to do they
  work I will refuse and refer them to Mono-Lino.\r\n\r\nBut if there is a legal/ethical
  way to get this done I would like to do that.\r\n\r\nThanks!"

    a reseller of Linotype fonts, just like FontShop. But I am not certain of this.
    Perhaps there is some sublicensing agreement that allows Adobe to apply their
    EULA.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/fontfeed/archives/helvetica_alternatives.cfm\">Helvetica
    Alternates</a>, just in time. Consider URW's <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=verity.search&searchstr=Heldustry\">Heldustry</a>
    or E+F's <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=verity.search&searchstr=Folio\">Folio</a>.
    E+F is particularly flexible with this sort of thing."

  body: "Thanks Stephen! That's great. \r\n\r\nI talked to Adobe sales today who said
    it was their own EULA that applied. I just sent a Typophile-IM to Thomas. Maybe
    he can confirm or deny for sure. "

  body: "Stephen:\r\nThis has been discussed numerous times. The EULA offered by the
    vendor to the buyer is the EULA that the buyer agrees to: if you enter into an
    agreement with Adobe, it's Adobe's terms you've agreed to, not Linotype's. \r\n\r\nThat's
    a major reason to buy from Adobe: they often have better terms than the original
    foundry.  Take MVB Celestia\u2122 Antiqua: license it from Adobe, and you can
    embed it for print and preview (see <a href=\"http://www.adobe.com/type/browser/legal/embeddingeula.html\">this
    list</a>); get it from MVB themselves, and \"if you have purchased a Basic License,
    you may distribute a PDF containing the subset-embedded Font Software to not more
    than five (5) computers at your one geographical location.\" See more <a href=\"http://www.mvbfonts.com/html/info/contents/eula.htm\">here.</a>\r\n\r\nMajor
    players like Adobe and Microsoft manage to negotiate more favourable terms for
    their clients: that's why you can find editable embedding versions of fonts in
    Microsoft products that, if purchased from another vendor might not allow _any_
    embedding. That's how Simon Daniels explained it to me.\r\n\r\nSee <a href=\"http://www.adobeforums.com/cgi-bin/webx?14@@.3bc319b0/0\">this
    </a> very recent thread on Adobe's forums.\r\n\r\nAnd, unless the EULA has a clause
    saying that the agreement is subject to future unilateral alterations (and, sadly,
    such EULAs _do_ exist!), the agreement you made when the money changed hands is
    the agreement you have.\r\n\r\nIt pays to shop EULAs!\r\n\r\nNow can you modify
    Adobe's Helvetica? Well, that's one for the lawyers! Maybe it is easier to go
    with one of your alternates.\r\n\r\n\r\n"
