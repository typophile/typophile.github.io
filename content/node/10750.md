body: With the new pc-tablet, and the comming 2003 new Mac- Tablet computers with
  a recognize-handwriting software, the concept of typography changes to the new tecnology,
  as always in the history of type, maybe the keyboard never works better than the
  hands &amp; pencil, just take a look here <BR><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windowsxp/tabletpc/evaluation/tours/default.asp#"

  body: This isn&#39;t actually new. It was introduced over ten years ago by Apple
    on the Newton, which introduced the concept of the PDA. <BR> <BR><a href="http://www.oldschool.net/newton/">http://www.oldschool.net/newton/</a>

  body: Well, at the beginning the first was Newton, but now the direction on pc-home
    users aroun the world seems to be tablet pc, that combines the traditional characteristic
    of the notebooks, with the tecnology of electronic handwrite ready to replace
    our copybooks for this, before you see the new comming i-tablet of mac, and the
    typography users will change comic sans with is own handwriting to write emails,
    thats not Newton but mac

  body: As I understand it, wasn&#39;t Newton handwriting recognition resurrected
    in the form of Inkwell, OS X&#39;s handwriting recognition? If you have a tablet
    plugged into a machine running X, you can pretty much write as you normally would
    and Inkwell understands.

  body: I tried Inkwell and it&#39;s really accurate. My handwriting is not joined
    very much &#40;italic hand&#41; so that might be why it works well for me. But
    I think it&#39;s still a lot slower than typing. I find that I can&#39;t write
    properly any more on paper &#40;I mean composing something&#41;, because I type
    much faster than I can write, and the speed of typing is closer to the speed I
    think. So I write more coherently on the computer. <BR> <BR>Chinese handwriting
    recognition has been around for over a decade &#40;if not longer, I&#39;m not
    sure&#41; and it has been quite popular, as you can imagine typing in Chinese
    is much slower than you would in other alphabetic languages. Yet I still forced
    myself to learn to type in Chinese, because I still find writing on the tablet
    really unnatural. <BR> <BR>Somehow I don&#39;t think handwriting recognition is
    going to change typography/type design very much. In the end, what we write down
    is still converted into conventional typography. So you think the trend is going
    to be more fonts based on handwriting?!
