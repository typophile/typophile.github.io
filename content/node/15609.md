  Frutiger's [[Frutiger]] typeface has been an extreme success since its initial release
  in the 1970s. In 1999, it was revised and updated by Adrian Frutiger himself (together
  with [[Linotype]]) to include true italics among other features. This typeface is
  called [[Frutiger Next]].\r\n\r\nThe <a href=\"http://www.linotype.com\">Linotype</a>
  website has overview pages showing all the weights of the <a href=\"http://www.linotype.com/469/frutiger-family.html\">original
  Frutiger type family</a> and <a href=\"http://www.linotype.com/53781/frutigernext-family.html\">Frutiger
