body: "I recently got a program called ObjectDock for my PC, which is basically a
  port of the icon dock on the Mac, that can magnify your icons when you move over
  them and all that. But the Fontlab icon on PC is only 48 by 48 pixels or something
  like that, so it looks horrible when you move over it and it's magnified.. I've
  searched every resource I know of for a high quality version of it without any luck.
  Does anyone with Fontlab 5 on a Mac feel like helping out (if it's not too hard
  to do)? I'm looking for the icon in 128 by 128 pixel size or larger, in either .ico
  or transparent .png format.\r\n\r\nThank you."

    and you can edit one of its existing icons for FontLab. \r\nBecause fontLab is
    not the photoshop, mean its not that widely used software..and thus its very difficult
    to get a readymade icon for this.\r\n\r\n:) "

  body: The thing is that I want the official Fontlab logo/icon. I just prefer it
    that way myself. and I figure it's easier to ask if someone on a Mac can port
    it over (assuming that the icon for the Mac version is higher quality) instead
    of me having to redraw the icon in Illustrator or something like that.

    else could send the original image."

    the background transparent so it can be used against any background. your image
    does prove that the Mac version of FontLab has a higher quality icon though. there
    isn't any .ico file in the FontLab installation folder?"

    whave 512 pixel icons to look at in some applications. This may seem silly because
    no one would set their dock to be that large. However, in some aspects of the
    UI, like coverflow, one will see icons displayed at a large size. \r\n\r\n"

  body: Apple really is designing icons for ultra-high res monitors. There was a high-end
    icon design contest a year or two ago where Apple had design students produce
    massive 3-D rendered redesigns of application icons and made job offers to some
    of the winners.

  body: "For more recent applications (SigMaker 3, BitFonter 3, ScanFont 5, the upcoming
    Photofont WebReady), we actually do have our icons in the size of 1024x1024 pixels,
    so I think some future releases will include the new 512x512 icon size. The FontLab
    Studio 5 icon only exists in 128x128 but we already have a 1024x1024 icon for
    the next version of FontLab Studio (not that we're going to release one shortly
    -- that's still a while ahead). \r\n\r\nBest, \r\nAdam\r\n"
