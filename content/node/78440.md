  body: "I know some Esperanto and while this does not bother me, I think it would
    be wiser to put the \u0134circumflex more to the left. Keeping it on center could
    confuse people after all. It would be kind of like taking the tilde in Spanish
    and making it off-center. People will know which letter it is but it would look
    strange. "

  body: That may be, but it seems odd to me. What about a face where the J drops below
    the baseline and hooks to the left under the adjacent letter? If you center it
    over the entire J, then it will be centered over the space between the letters.
    Would you also prefer to see the dot on the lowercase j more to the left, centered
    on the width of the letter? It seems to me to be more consistent to treat the
    circumflex (or any other accent) as you would the dot, centering it over the stem.
    I also checked and the vast majority of fonts installed on my computer have it
    centered over the stem, only a handful don't.

  body: "I stopped centering on the \u0134 stem because an Esperanto enthusiast told
    me it was supposed to be centered over the letter, not the stem. Where's an Esperanto
    enthusiast when you need one?"

  body: "I am not an Esperanto enthusiast, but I would tend to think that the intent
    was to harmonize with existing European typographic practice, rather than for
    Esperanto to be radically different.\r\n\r\nCentering over the stem would, as
    noted in this thread, be mandatory for typefaces like Caslon or Baskerville, where
    the bowl of the capital J is a kern. I strongly suspect that it is the usual practice
    in other typefaces as well.\r\n\r\nAlthough, what would I know? I thought that
    Esperanto used the caron, not the circumflex. But, checking, it is the circumflex
    that it uses. Ah: and Czech uses a caron on the J; - no, it doesn't, I had interpreted
    the Wikipedia article wrongly... it is used in some phonetic transcription schemes
    and in the Wahki language - it centers the caron over the stem on the lowercase
    J, as Esperanto does with the circumflex, but some fonts, at least, put the caron
    inside the capital letter J for Czech.\r\n\r\nAt least there's a basis for comparison,
    if Esperanto texts aren't easy to find."
