    is to string together narrow white hexagons as counters and inter-letter spaces,
    defined by vertical stems and triangular serifs. The interior spaces are at least
    as important as the strokes that make up the characters.\" ([[http://www.justanotherfoundry.com/Lapture/index.htm]|source]])"

  body: "While people typically associate typography, the backbone of graphic design,
    with the shape of characters, it also concerns the space around and between them.
    Ever since Gutenberg invented movable type, printers have set text in crisp, justified
    columns. To achieve this effect with letterpress, the typesetter would insert
    additional spacing material between elements (as well as hyphenating words where
    possible). Today, software does the same work automatically. When done well, the
    variable spacing between characters is so subtle the reader fails to notice it.
    When done poorly, gaps erupt across the text like wormholes in a damaged universe.
    To see examples of choppy spacing firsthand, take a look at the print edition
    of nearly any city newspaper.\r\n\tEllen Lupton, http://elupton.com/2009/10/white-space/\r\n\r\nThe
    American book designer Bruce Rogers considered proportion \"the most important
    element of beauty in bookmaking,\" and found a thousand uses for it in his work.
    [10] Rogers wrote of the subtle relations of such things as letter shapes and
    page shape, letter widths and word space increments, of text area and page area.
    At the same time he thought \"mechanical perfection\" to be \"inimical\" to art:
    typographers should be artists and not engineers.\r\n\tDespite his commitment
    to a modernist aesthetic, the Swiss typographer Emil Ruder also argued against
    a rigid or mechanical application of proportion in typography. \"No system of
    ratios, however ingenious, can relieve the typographer of deciding how one value
    should be related to another.\" [11] Ruder thought that the well-spring of sound
    proportion lay in feeling and intuition alone. In creating shapes and delimiting
    spaces for letterforms, typographers must intuitively gauge the rhythms and the
    kinds of harmony that such shapes and spaces will create.\r\n\thttp://www.lib.uiowa.edu/spec-coll/bai/amert2.htm\r\n\r\nThe
    other day, I was watching a documentary called Helvetica. It's a great watch for
    any typography  nuts out there.\r\n\tAt one point, they're interviewing typography
    designers and someone says that when you're designing a letter, it's not about
    what you put in. It's not about the shape of the letter at all, but rather the
    shape of the white space around it. It's the emptiness that gives the letter its
    beauty, its grace, its structure. Anyone can draw a letter; it takes greatness
    to draw what's not there.\r\n\thttp://www.strategictext.com/2009/02/write-whats-not-there.html\r\n\r\nTo
    my mind, beautiful typography is based on selection of a typeface in resonance
    with the text, the sensitive use of space between letters and words, the length
    of lines and their alignments, the space between lines and between paragraphs,
    and the placement of type on the page. The overall effect further depends on clear
    typographic delineation of the different levels of information, the color, light,
    and texture of the type as it sits on the page, the paper on which it is printed,
    and the quality of the printing.\r\nMalcolm Grear, http://www.peachpit.com/articles/article.aspx?p=664662"

    along those lines. Maybe it was Horowitz who said it; can't recall."
