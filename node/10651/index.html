In fact it's <br>an experiment: to create ink- and light-traps <i>through blurring</i>. <br>How did I do it? <br> <br><img src=http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/7244.gif alt=Tyson> <br> <br>Tyson looks tough but is quite delicate in fact.

<div class=commentbody>> ink- and light-traps through blurring. <br> <br>Funny - I tried some experiments exactly like that, about a year or so ago! I was looking for automatic incorporation of trapping. But in the end I had to conclude that it doesn't really work... <br> <br>You're doing a Gaussian blur then a cutoff, right? <br>Well, it <i>looks</i> cool! <br> <br>hhp <br></div>

<div class=commentbody>Hrant - what i meant to say was he did something to bow the straight areas *before* the blur/bitmap. The blur/bitmap alone will round corners and clog counters, but won't make the "wavy" effect. <br> <br>He might have also used the "wave" filter in photoshop.

<div class=commentbody>Grande Capeto, <br>Novamente, mandou muito bem! <br> <br>I found that the ridge of the base of the G in <br>the A version, was very exaggerated (Would be <br>inktrap?) and that the S, has in its starts/end <br>leaving for the edges.

<div class=commentbody>Wait, you're using Photoshop to <i>auto-trace</i>? <br>I didn't even know it could. But tracing algorithm quality varies a lot (even -no, especially- within the products of a single company), so try Streamline, or even FontLab. And data from digital processing (like you're doing) tends to be <i>very</i> "clean" - it should trace exceptionally well, if you have enough bits - try 1000. <br> <br>hhp <br></div>

<div class=commentbody>I think even Fog's tracing would be adequate, with enough resolution (by "1000" I meant the height in pixels). <br> <br>hhp <br></div>

<div class=commentbody>Regarding Stephen's name database idea, I think this is an excellent thought and would be very welcome. The main problem with the Goudy Center database is that they wanted to charge money for name searches, which put people off using it or even bothering to submit to it. <br> <br>FontLab now has a nifty 'Check at MyFonts.com' button in the FontInfo naming panel, which goes off and checks to see if MyFonts lists any fonts with the name you are using. This is handy, but of course is limited in that it only checks the one source. If another freely accessible database were available, FontLab could check multiple sources and so provide more reliable feedback. <br> <br>Regarding the kind of abuse that Hrant suggests might happen (people submitting cool names for as yet non-existent typefaces to prevent other people from using them), you can only legally claim trademark on a name that you are actively trading goods or services under in the marketplace. You are also legally obliged to defend a trademark: there is no automatic protection. So if I start selling a pair of fonts called Nour & Patria, Hrant would be obliged to sue me or lose his trademark on the names. I suggest that names should be accepted for the database <i>only</i> if the submitter is claiming them as trademarks, i.e. submission to the database constitutes a trademark claim.</div>

<div class=commentbody><i>Right. I've got a lot of the data, I just need to put <br>a (inter)face on it.</i> <br> <br>BTW, Stephen, in what format is this data? This would <br>be a really great resource if the persons or company that <br>would give you technological support created a flexible <br>database format where one can hang pieces of data of <br>several types on each register. I mean, at least: an URL, <br>maybe an image, links to other related registers in the DB <br>(with a flexible definition of what a "relationship" is), a text <br>field with references, etc. And of course everything <br>searchable according to a number of possible query "views". <br>Wow, now I'm dreaming! ;) <br>Maybe you could get <i>tovarich</i> Yarmola into the idea? ;)</div>

<div class=commentbody>This topic probably needs a new thread, but I'll briefly <br>describe the project: TypeTracker is more than a <br>database of font names, but a general reference <br>directory of fonts, designers, foundries and resellers. <br>Each of these 4 databases will be cross-referenced and <br>searchable with links to font samples and other <br>relevant pages on the web. <br> <br>The owners of each entity will be able to modify their <br>entry a la the directory at <a href="http://www.briarpress.org/cgi-bin/briarpress/showdirect.cgi?db=direct&uid=default&sb=2&view_records=1&Category=Type%2Ffoundries&view_records.x=10&view_records.y=2" target=_blank>Briar Press</a>. (I've been hoping to <br>speak with the creators of BP about working with me to <br>develop TypeTracker, but I'm open to ideas and <br>collaboration from other designers and database engineers.)</div>
