body: Dear Type Geniuses! I'm trying to identify this typeface used for a Robert Crumb
  exhibition in Paris last summer (image attached). I tried researching it on my own
  and the closest I came up with was Blackoak but it's still not quite what I had
  in mind. Your input is greatly appreciated!
