  body: 'Purely out of historical interest, I would like to know more about this font.
    It was owned by one of the biggest 19th century Brussels printers. Was it used
    elsewhere? Is it a copy (Belgian printing industry was notorious for its illegal
    copying of mainly French books)? Would you consider it original (Belgium was one
    of the first industrial countries in the world: they certainly had the technology).
    Thank you in advance.'

      style. I could make extra scans if you want or lend you the booklet.\r\n"
