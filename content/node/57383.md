body: "I attached an example, posters are going to be as long as the one on the right
  at the most. I wasn't sure if I should align them all on the bottom and rag on top
  or otherwise. This will be a twin-loop / double-wire binding so the pages will be
  spread apart ~1/6th\" when opened opposed to a perfect bind which would obscure
  the middle.\r\n\r\nQuestions\r\nHow do I decide where to place the image, the text
  (inc. colophon)\r\nSome thoughts about text hierarchy\r\nMaintaining some sort of
  order between posters that vary in size (width kept the same)\r\n\r\nThe book is
  11x17, bound as demonstrated by the spread\r\n\r\nThanks!"

  body: "2\xA2: I would align the posters at the top, and, if all the details are
    the same depth, (a) align at the bottom (and perhaps drop the rule?), if different
    (b) hang after the poster at a standard drop as a caption. Alternating author
    and title recto/verso and incorporating the folio design might be better in (a),
    to avoid the repetitiveness of a fixed layout."

  body: Hmm that seams interesting, would that survive a hardcover? Without a lay-flat
    binding the inner margin might be too narrow for this stiff a paper. I'll give
    it a try. Oh and Is there a book that you would recommend for book designing?
    I'm taking a class on in next quarter but wouldn't mind some preliminaries.

  body: Derin, look at a lot of books, old and new. And, whatever rules and prescriptions
    you find, do not take them too seriously. BTW, hardcovers or cases are meant to
    open easier and flatter than paperbacks. Good luck.

  body: "Not when you get them done overnight :D. Especially when the paper is 300gsm
    with rag content. We'll see, I'll probably get some bound to lay-flat with hinges.\r\n\r\nI
    weren't looking for rules to stick to, more for rules to start from in basics
    such as margins, which side they are greater on and things as such"

  body: 'The rules of thumb are as in Ivan''s pic (minus the strict placing of corners
    on the diagonals): less in the gutter than outside, less on top than bottom. The
    more pages and harder to open, the larger the gutter has to be.'
