  identify them? I&#39;d be delighted.                                       The first
  is from the Icelandic newspaper Morgunbladid: <center>&#60;img&#62;                                                                             The
  second comes &#40;oddly&#41; from some sort of herb advert. For ages, it was wonderfully
  used in the british <i>Total Film</i> magazine though I could never figure out what
  it was. <BR>&#60;img&#62;</center>  Thanks so much for the help!'

    the bodoni look. I wonder why it isn&#39;t used more. '
