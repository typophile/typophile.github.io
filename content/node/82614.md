  what are the preferred fonts for the Scandinavians. I end up reading about Vikings
  or rotten shark delicacy. Perhaps my key words are not creative enough.\r\n\r\nEvery
  country has some preferred font that you would recognize it by. Like for example
  Germany is full of DIN family fonts. From railway stations to administration building,
  road signs or car number plates. Are there any typefaces that are very Denmark or
  Swedish ? \r\n\r\nThank you for taking the time to read it.\r\nAnd appreciate your
  feedback\r\n\r\nregards\r\n\r\nSebastian"

  body: "I remember seeing some Scandinavian stuff from the early 20th century using
    German typefaces, Grotesks (Akzidenz, Venus, Block/Hermes etc.) and geometric
    Grotesks (Erbar, Futura), but in a quite unique way. I\u2019m sorry I can\u2019t
    remember where I\u2019ve seen it. But you might find similar examples in corresponding
    Flickr Albums etc.\r\n\r\nAlso have a look at these:\r\nhttp://new.myfonts.com/fonts/sofiebeier/ovink/\r\nhttp://www.a2-type.co.uk/html/tram.html\r\nhttp://www.a2-type.co.uk/html/klampenborg_light.html\r\nhttp://www.a2-type.co.uk/html/danmark.html\r\nhttp://www.a2-type.co.uk/html/dane_light.html"

    where do you study, who are your faculty and what it the purpose of the project?\r\n\r\nYou
    will probably have to start with a broader search on Scandinavian design in general:\r\n\r\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scandinavian_design\r\n\r\nAs
    well as Scandinavian graphic design history:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.google.ca/search?q=scandinavian+graphic+design+history&ie=utf-8&oe=utf-8&aq=t&rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&client=firefox-a\r\n\r\nLooks
    like there are few really good books there. I\u2019m confidant that your professor(s)
    would be able to direct you to a source for them. From there, you will be able
    to develop a greater sense of culture, history, politics and philosophy behind
    their work (including industrial, architectural &c). There should be more than
    enough material there to develop a sense of typographic flavour.\r\n\r\nSee also:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.1stwebdesigner.com/design/worldwide-graphic-design-2/\r\n\r\nYou
    will most likely need to narrow your research to a specific time period."

  body: "First of all, thank you so much everyone for taking the time to reply. Great
    links and very interesting read. I'm going through one by one as we speak. Once
    again, thank you.\r\n\r\n@Christopher Dean \r\nMust be my poor English comprehension
    that makes me sound so young :) \r\nI'm close to my 40s, and this is just pure
    personal interest. I suspect you won't care much for the details, or a long read,
    so I try to make it quick.\r\n\r\nPolish born, living in Malaysia - Kuala Lumpur
    for past 18 years. I'm a (reluctant to use the word here) \"designer\". I worked
    with Macromedia for many years, before it was absorbed by Adobe, and my specialty
    has been Flash design, an interactive content, since Flash's incarnation in 1996.\r\n
    \r\nI don't usually deal with typography, as most of my clients are from automotive
    industry, and they have custom made, or certain standard typeface I'm provided
    with, along with guideline manuals on how to use it. I only put things together
    and make it interesting for the visitor to explore. But I love looking at text
    and I find it fascinating. I don't know whether you could call it a \"gut feeling\",
    but whenever I see text, I can tell whether it works on not. Perhaps some basic
    design taste and common sense? Recently I was part of a team working on Mercedes
    project under Swedish agency. I spent some time there, and while being so close,
    I stop by Denmark to say hello to my favorite pipe maker. I was amazed with some
    really great looking typefaces used all around town, from banks to public transport,
    signage etc... It's not a typeface I come across often, but many of them seem
    to be quite similar to each other. As if they follow some certain source and were
    built based on that.\r\n\r\nRight now I'm doing some work for Malaysian property
    developer. Online application, mobile smart home (on/off air-con from your iPhone
    etc...) and website. Their branding designer is very local. Don't mean that in
    negative way, but given Malaysia is made of Malays (Muslims), Indians and Chinese,
    there is very strong tendency to use cursive fonts for everything. The Arabic,
    Tamil and Chinese influence, results in Papyrus, Comis Sans or Lucida being the
    primary choice. To the contrary, the developer aims at the young generation, and
    all his projects are very modern, minimalist, Scandinavian design inspired. Hence
    I find the use of Papyrus to be a really bad call, and I'm doing research, trying
    to find more suitable typeface for that kind of design he does, as substitute
    to what they have so far. \r\nI couldn't stress enough how important is to hire
    professional to do that job, but the mentality in here is very different and branding
    is never on priority list. I feel guilty and obligated to help, to make best out
    of it and at least find something that doesn't read the property name in Papyrus
    :) The least I can do.\r\n\r\nI would welcome very much your suggestions or links
    where I could read a little more about typeface suitable for this particular job.
    \r\n\r\nSorry for the long read, and again, thank you all so very much for such
    valuable input. Appreciate, and I do mean it.\r\n\r\nregards from Papyrus, Comic
    Sans land...\r\nSebastian"
