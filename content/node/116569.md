body: "I have been dropped in the deep end and was recommended by someone to ask here
  for help.\r\nMy predicament is that I created a typeface/font a while ago and wacked
  it on dafont for free for personal use and left a note saying email me about commercial
  use not expecting anything. I have now received an email from an award winning ad
  agency asking for a quote for 15 users, print and web use. This is pretty great
  news to come out of the blue but I am really stuck on how I'd price this. It's just
  a singe weight font with a small amount of glyphs(bare essentials). I also would
  love help on how I'd find create an appropriate licence for this.\r\n\r\nI really
  need help from someone with a lot more experience than me and this seems to be the
  place to be.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance,\r\nxTeraa"

    there are many similar fonts out there, you can't ask for too much... Could you
    show the font in question?\r\n\r\nIn terms of authoring a license, I recommend
    emulating \u2013but not copying\u2013 my favorite:\r\nhttps://monokrom.no/page/about_us/licensing_terms\r\nSee

  body: "This is the font http://www.dafont.com/lovelexiehandwritten.font\r\n\r\nIt's
    nothing amazingly unique in terms of style just a handwritten typeface. It be
    nice to get something from the work I did. I don't even know the ballpark for
    something like this since I'm more of a Graphic Designer than a Type Designer.\r\n\r\nThank
    you for the links on licencing I will start reading through and creating one for
    this. Should I do a licence specifically for the deal (specifying 15 users and
    use on web/print)."

  body: "Normally handwriting is unique, but there are <em>so</em> many handwriting
    fonts out there, including free ones with no commercial restrictions...\r\n\r\nMy
    gut feeling \u2013that's all I can offer\u2013 says under $1000.\r\n\r\nSomething
    else BTW: your font is pretty unlikely to render well onscreen, at least at smaller
    sizes, FYI.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "Thanks for the sizing tip, I'm guessing this is something inherent with the
    font design and not the way it was made?\r\n\r\nAnd as for pricing I was thinking
    around \xA3300 for it all and that is way under $1000. I think it is a good price
    since as you said there are tons of other free commercially usable fonts or is
    this underselling it? I didn't even think it be close to $1000 and thought \xA3300
    might be pushing it.\r\n\r\nI can't thank you enough for the help by the way."

  body: "Fonts have to be what's called \"hinted\" to appear well in low resolution,
    and few free fonts do that. You might eventually get an email from your client
    complaining, so make sure you cover your back on that (and tell them to have it
    professionally hinted if need be).\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: Ah, I've heard of pixel hinting and am guessing it's something similar where
    you line it up on the pixel grid so you don't get the sub pixels making it look
    out of focus. I will have to look into it and will also mention the sizing problem
    when emailing them back.

  body: I have no idea what a fair price is, but if this is an agency in a large city
    (New York, London, etc) they probably charge very high rates (I've been charged
    a couple hundred bucks just to have a logo emailed to me), so I might ask on the
    high side for the font.

  body: Yh they are a pretty large agency but the only thing is I don't want to push
    a large amount because it's not that unique

    agency is probably charging an arm and a leg for their own services. But I certainly
    understand that you don't want to lose the deal.\r\n\r\nHrant, a large, successful
    agency is used to working with very talented people and paying top prices. But
    as I said, I can understand the OP's concerns."

  body: I recently did a job for a corporate client and their New York agency had
    to get involved a little bit, and their fee was just astronomical. When I mentioned
    it to my client, she just sighed and said "I can't believe it either but that's
    what they charge."

  body: One factor is you are often not dealing directly with the person who does
    the work. You go through a rep who passes the work to a supervisor and then it
    goes to the designer, then it's given to the proofreader, and you get billed for
    each of their times. And each of those folks is billed at a high rate, and even
    if it takes 3 minutes they probably round their time up to 15 or 30.
