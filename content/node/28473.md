body: "Hello,\r\n\r\nI'm just curious about how you all make typeface decisions for
  clients when you dont have a licence for a particular typeface?\r\n\r\nI know that
  Fontshop and most foundry websites have functionality to preview any text with a
  choice of sizing etc. This is helpful for having a quick look, but its not really
  flexible in that there is no kerning control, and nuisance backgrounds make them
  hard to work with for mocking up a design.  I understand that foundrys can't be
  distributing typefaces in the hope that people will buy licences if they actually
  use it, because we all know that a lot of people simply wouldn't.\r\n\r\nI have
  a logo to redesign for a business, and I dont know how to go about making the choice.
  \ I cant develop finished artwork with different faces without buying the licences,
  and the value of the job means that I cant afford to buy several.  \r\n\r\nI guess
  I can present type samples and gauge which one they like, and work from there.  Is
  that something designers often do?  Or are you lucky enough to have a wide range
  of typefaces at your disposal?\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nJonny\r\n\r\n"

  body: "I tend to receive the requests, not make them, since I design fonts and rarely
    touch the stuff myself. :-)  The requests I get rarely mention other shortlisted
    fonts, for whatever reason. And I almost never decline; my philosophy is that
    the font scene is too competitive so the most one can hope for in the retail market
    is to hook people onto your product by letting them use it a little bit. By the
    same logic, I never cripple my live online samples, and I believe that any font
    house that does that probably isn't thinking straight.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "So, speaking of font previews...\r\n\r\nAbout an hour ago here at ATypI,
    Adam and Yuri previewed their soon-to-be updated BitFonter software. It started
    out as a showcase the new capabilities of the app, but slightly turned into a
    \"be careful what you put on the web\" lecture. In about 30 seconds they showed
    how you can take a bitmap image from MyFonts showing the character set of a typeface
    and basically auto generate a working font. Obviously there are numerous implication
    of this feature; surly there are many legitimate uses where this would be great.
    On the other hand, it might make designers/distributers think again about how
    they showcase their types.\r\n\r\nr.k"

  body: As an inde typedesigner I try to meet every request in it's best way. It could
    be a set up of words as a pdf/eps. Sometimes my pdf-specimen will do the job of
    convinsing the client for a purchase. If a bigger and more complicated project
    needs a few"try-outs" that could be fixed as well. It vary a lot from case to
    case. I agree with Hrant you have to be customer friendly as much as possible
    in order to get new clients.
