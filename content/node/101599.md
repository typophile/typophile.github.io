    from YouWorkForThem\r\n\r\nFrom their site:\r\n<blockquote>Jackson is a font design
    released for the Mecanorma Type Collection. Copyright 2004 Trip Productions BV.</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<strong>Edit:</strong>
    There is also  <strong>Jackson MN</strong> released by Mecanorma International
    (1991) but I can't find any legitimate source to acquire it"
