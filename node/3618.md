  body: This looks like it was done by ComicCraft, and possibly based on the widths
    of their font Achtung Baby &#40;<a href="http://www2.comicbookfonts.com/e/env/0001NePEV58GtkopN4175z6/fonts/font_list.html?link=/fonts/DL/catalog.html&amp;item=fonts:dl209"

    but it&#39;s been altered quite a bit. If it was done by DC Comics&#39; usually
    letterers, they tend not to work on the computer, so it would have been done by
    hand. Some of the folks who letter for DC do use the computer, so it could be
    custom drawn on the computer as well.
