body: "I'm looking for interesting/unusual RSS feeds for an experimental type-related
  project. I want feeds that have random but interesting words or phrases as the title
  of each entry.\r\n\r\nThis one works pretty well for my purposes (and it's funny
  too).\r\n<a href=feed://www.overheardinnewyork.com/index.xml>feed://www.overheardinnewyork.com/index.xml</a>\r\n\r\nI
  don't want things that sound like news headlines or have the name of the feed in
  all of the titles.\r\n\r\nMaybe a feed of famous one-liners? Or a good \"word of
  the day\" feed? (all the ones I've found so far have the name of the dictionary
  or some other additional text placed in the title)\r\n\r\nIt'd be an added bonus
  if the feed uses proper punctuation\u2026 smart quotes, etc\r\n\r\nAny suggestions?"

    myself... I should've thought of that one earlier.\r\n\r\nAnyone else?"

  body: "Thanks Ernie, that's a great one!\r\n\r\nI'm still looking for some slightly
    longer ones... roughly sentence length. Maybe famous last words? The <a href=feed://api.flickr.com/services/feeds/groups_pool.gne?id=30104124@N00>Six
    Word Stories</a> Flickr pool is pretty good."
