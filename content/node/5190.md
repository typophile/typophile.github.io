body: I have a logo to design and it&#39;s just begging me to use quote marks as the
  eyes of a smiling face. But I think I may have seen this before, or something too
  similar at least. <BR> <BR>Has anyone seen this or something like it? Post an image
  if possible. <BR> <BR>And while we&#39;re on the subject, it&#39;d be cool to see
  any creative use of quote marks anyone knows of. <BR> <BR>Thanks

    about. <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/4100/39068.gif"
    alt="quote"> <BR> <BR>Okay, really this is the one I designed. If this spurs up
    any more responses that would be nice, but thanks to all who responded previously.
    <BR> <BR>Comments on the design welcome too, but not suggestions, it&#39;s done
    as I could do. The company is going to be an to be an online travel booking site,
    just like, hmmm... let me see, travelocity ;&#41; <BR> <BR> <BR>
