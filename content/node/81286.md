  i would like to use the same font in my adobe after effects project, unfortunatly
  it's almost impossible for me to find out what kind of font was used there. I'm
  looking for the exact name, but a simillar font would be just fine as well.\r\nThank
  you in advance for your help (and I want to apology for my broken english, it's
  not my native language)"
