  but I can\u2019t find anything on the Berthold font site. Does someone know anything
  about this font? Is it still available for licensing?"

  body: 'There are quite different text and display versions (reflecting substantial
    differences in the metal) (making this one of the first digital families with
    ''opticals'' to use that ghastly Adobespeak). It''s miles better than Monotype''s
    own, very poor digital adaptation. Berthold''s photo and digital adaptations of
    Monotype faces are, by and large, much better than Mono''s, but there must be
    some sort of licensing difficulty which prevents them from being sold. I guess
    the only way to do it is to get an existing licenseholder to transfer his or her
    license. But it won''t be me! Interestingly, I couldn''t get the pdf you reference
    to render on Acro 8 Win 7. The design of the display (i.e something like 16 pt)
    version is much, much, niftier! With enormous and utterly gorgeous ascenders.
    A fabulous type to use for large text.  '

    . . . TextEdit. Not the easiest font to use, I'd say. Worth it, maybe, but definitely
    a lot of work for the designer. This being Berthold, there are of course no f-ligs.
    Like I've often said, the easiest thing, sometimes, as well as the best, is to
    get someone to set your piece in Mono metal - - which can be, surprisingly enough,
    not that expensive. \r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Van Dijck display_3635.jpg]"

  body: 'Worth noting as a footnote, van Krimpen''s opinion that van Dijck should
    not be revived as being too difficult to get right either philosophically or practically.
    I must admit I find that the spirit of van Dijck seems singularly absent from
    the spiky, narrow, and strangely Victorian-in-feeling Elzevir and the plodding,
    humourless, charmless Custodia, which looks like Quadraat crossed with Adobe Garamond.
    The problem is van Dijck. Everyone who has revived it has been phenomenally talented,
    phenomenally well-informed. Yet somehow the typeface slips out of their grasp. '

  body: "Well - - and the italic seems too dark and too tightly spaced.\r\n\r\nIt
    would be interesting to see some informative (extensive!) comparisons between
    the metal and Berthold digital. I think the general feeling about Mono Van Dijck
    is that it was one of their more flawed revivals. But you would have expected
    Berthold to deal with those problems. Why release Van Dijck at all if you aren't
    going to get it right? One would really like to know Berthold's approach to the
    revival, why they did what they did and who they expected to use it and why and
    when. Is there anyone still around who would know? I would hesitate to guess anything
    - - . It's hard to imagine Berthold saying 'this is freaky, we love it, we don't
    care what you think - - up to you to figure it out.' Given the cost of producing
    one of their photo typefaces - - well, they simply must have thought it out.\r\n\r\nIt's
    interesting puzzle to try to figure out what is wrong with a typeface that almost,
    but doesn't quite, make it. And it's quite possible that something that looks
    dreadful as shown here could somehow just work when used by someone who had figured
    out how to use it. "

  body: Bill, it's possible that Berthold's Van Dijck might have been produced at
    the request of a particular customer, as happened more often during the metal,
    photo and early digital period than we might think. Compared to the cost of the
    typsetting machines, development of a new type family was relatively inexpensive,
    and would sometimes be undertaken in order to seal a contract for purchase of
    the machine. [A good example of this was Mike Parker's commitment to provide Greek
    versions of any Latin typeface requested by Linotype's Greek sales rep in the
    1970s, supporting a practical monopoly in the local typesetting machine market.]
    If this were the case, then it is also possible that the project had external
    deadlines that might have affected the quality of the revival.

  body: I think you could be right on this one. I'm still so hypnotized by the Berthold
    PR . . . but the fact is, they did do a lot of careless work, as I've discovered
    whenever I've dug deeply into the library. I guess it's like everyone in type
    - - sometimes you get it right, but mostly you have to compromise because there
    just isn't enough time. Also, I haven't compared this to photo, and it is just
    possible that the digital conversion was very badly done. What baffles me here,
    though, is to find so many things done right among so many done wrong. <em>Why?</em>

  body: I suppose the other question to ask is what their sources were? Were they
    looking at Elsevier originals? For what sizes did they have references, and for
    which were they making stuff up and extrapolating?

    whether it is that way on purpose, and if so what it is meant to represent are
    all mysteries to me.
