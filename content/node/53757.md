  maybe News Gothic and Garamond?

    Text</a> (and Hoefler Titling)?\r\nAnd maybe Knockout as a sans partner for Hoefler
    Text, H&FJ have an example on their website.\r\n"

  body: "Those may look good, but are they suitably neoclassical (18th century)?\r\nHoefler
    Text is an oldstyle, and knockout is Victorian.\r\n\r\nCaslon or better yet the
    definitive transitional face, Baskerville, would be the obvious choices for the
    serif face.\r\nFor the sans, something anachronistic such as Sebastian or Eureka
    Sans.\r\n\r\nThis is just theory, I haven't actually put the faces side by side
    to see waht they look like, it's just the principle of historical allusion, that
    faces from the same era may be good pals. Something about shared aesthetic concerns,
    according to Hudson."

  body: I like the way you think, Nick. I am yet to pair them, but I would think that
    they would do fine.
