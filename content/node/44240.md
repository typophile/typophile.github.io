  Illustrator end up on? For example, I often end up with a point in a position such
  as \u201C42.289 px\u201D and would much rather be able to stop it at the second
  decimal place and even then only at five and zero. It seems like Illustrator and
  Indesign used to work this way, and then sometime after the Intel Macs came out
  Apple release an OS patch that suddenly allowed software to calculate all kinds
  of kooky locations for points. "
