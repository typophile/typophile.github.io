body: I have this logo for a client that needs to be re-created for wide format use.  The
  problem is the logo is extremely low-res.  I must re-create and cannot figure out
  what this typeface is.  I have found the "Angie" family, and that is VERY close,
  but not quite.  The logo was created by a small company, and have heard it may have
  been done in Publisher.  I've checked some of the Microsoft fonts, but no luck as
  of yet.  Please, any help would be appreciated, been stuck on this for a couple
  weeks.  [img:sites/default/files/old-images/CCTLogo_5203.jpg]
