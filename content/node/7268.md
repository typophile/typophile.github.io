    knockoff of Optima, but no way it&#39;s really a different font.'

  body: There are two outline fonts in old Adobe Optima files, one hi-res and another
    low-res. If you can open the font file with Fontographer &#40;maybe with FontLab
    also, but I&#39;ve never tried to do this on FontLab&#41; you can generate a &#34;low
    resolution vector font&#34; that is exactly what you are looking for. <BR> <BR>jmc
