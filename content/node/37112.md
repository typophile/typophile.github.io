body: "I am testing a font from Juan Pablo De Gregorio to see if it works on mac (he's
  on PC at the moment) and cannot get it to work properly. He has supplied me with
  three weights Bold, Regular and Light which shows up in Suitcase X1 as three different
  fontfiles with working preview. The problem arises when I try using them in InDesign
  and Illustrator CS3. The regular comes doesn't show but comes in as an another light.
  So I get 2 lights and one bold but no regular. What can this be caused by? Is the
  problem in the building or export of the fontfile in FL or in the Adobe software
  interpretation of the fontfile?\r\n\r\nAnyone know?\r\n\r\nJuan Pablo informed me
  that he is using fontlab 5."

    at? Where in FL? I'm not very skilled in FL so what can I tell Juan Pablo?\r\n\r\n"

  body: Not that I'm a big pro, but I think that one of the names is just filled in
    wrongly. Not very strange, since it's a big hassle to get it right, hyphen, no
    hyphen, abbreviation here, space there. [[http://groups.msn.com/fontlab/tipsandtricks.msnw?action=get_message&mview=0&ID_Message=2843|Here
    ]] is a post on the FontLab MSNGroup (horrible site, but ok) from Twardoch about
    naming fonts. I usually do it like that, and it has worked for me. Maybe Juan
    Pablo can use it.

  body: "You probably have a naming issue.\r\n\r\nIn FontLab, (with the font(s) open),
    choose \"Font Info...\" -- there are a LOT of choices here, but the important
    ones are on the first screen: Family name, weight, width, style etc. Set these
    up for the weights you have, and then go thru the SEVERAL following screens (you
    can use the little arrow at the top to advance. FontLab is very good a \"auto-filling\"
    these (the little diamond icons) for you, but you have to set the initial values
    up right to begin with. If a auto-fill comes up weird, check your initial values
    and try again... you CAN override the auto fill, but you should consider using
    it as a \"test\".\r\n\r\nFor example: Yous set the family name to \"Wacky\"; then
    use the pop-up to set the weight to \"Bold\" (you can type anything here, but
    if you want to be consistent with the thousands of faces out there, use one of
    the pop-up values); tehn set the width to medium(normal). Now use the \"Build
    Style Names\" auto-fill to finish the other values, then click to the next screen
    and click \"Build Opentype Names\" and so on and so on.\r\n\r\nThis should solve
    your menu problem.\r\n\r\nNote that you COULD be having problems with Illustrator/InDesign's
    font menu cache as well. Find a copy of Font Finagler and clean out your \"old\"
    cache files to fix any lingering menu issues (I have ot run this every month or
    so to clean out phantom menu items)."

  body: I have noticed if I use the 'build style names' to auto-fill the fields, whatever
    pops up isn't right. At least it differs totally from what Adam Twardoch has written
    on the FontLab Group.

  body: "Yes, if you have more than two weights in the family, the auto-fill stuff
    will never work as well as I'd like - it will generate multiple families even
    in OT-savvy Adobe apps.\r\n\r\nT"

  body: Yeah, exactly. I have followed Adam Twardoch's little description on that
    (horrible) MSNGroup, which works fine for me. OT family with weights.

    easy as InDesign did with PDF-files. I have never understood why this can't be
    inbuilt into FontLab now that the answers on how to do it are available.\r\nI
    want to be able to trust the green diamond ;-)"

  body: Yeah, the method Adam described should be built in FontLab. Or, at least it
    could definitely be made more easy.
