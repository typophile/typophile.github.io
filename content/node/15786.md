  body: The onslaught of everything Avant Garde w/ Alternates of course! Hopefully
    it won't be as bad as I imagine, assuming the new ITC AGGpro is the first time
    the alternates have been available in digital form.

    available as <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/?fuseaction=catalog.fontpackage&searchby=manufacturer&displayfontid=EF.101895.0.0\"
    target=\"new\">separate fonts</a>; this is the first time they're all in one feature-rich
    OpenType font. Unfortunately the new ITC Avant Garde Gothic Pro sucks big time...
    What a lousy job they did on it. :^("

  body: The only two things, afaiac, which the ITC has going for it are that it is
    opentype and it has more of the lovely goodies. I spoke to Veronika about it at
    ATypI and with any luck those of us whom have licensed E+F Avant Garde and E+F
    Avant Garde Alternates from Fontshop will be able to upgrade.

    that one word when reading your comment. Sorry'boutthat Eric. You're absolutely
    right.\r\n\r\nBTW I absolutely love your icon. It makes me chuckle every time
    I see it, but on the other hand I can't help feeling a little nauseous near the
    end. Though that's just me, I'm over-sensitive to blood."
