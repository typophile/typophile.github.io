body: "Hello, Typophyles.\r\n Could you please help me out? I'm in love with a typeface
  and I even know it's name, but it doesn't quite fit me, so maybe you suggest an
  alternative or two?\r\n The font is Adobe Fangsong, I've attached a sample, I believe
  it comes with Photoshop. The thing, however, is that it\u2019s main feature is a
  full set of some 30,000 chinese hieroglyphs and everything else seems to be non-essential
  and only halfway there: of the German umlauts only \xFC is present, and while all
  the Cyrillic characters are included, their side bearings are left on the default
  0-1000, which results in enormous spacing and renders them useless. \r\n Now, the
  problem is that I am absolutely in love with the Latin part of the typeface. Never
  in my life have I once paid any attention to any font, but this one seems to have
  got to me. I've just spent two sleepless nights trying to find an alternative that
  would have functional German and French accidentals, or maybe even a Cyrillic character
  set. All to pretty much no avail. So maybe you could, please, help me out? \r\n
  I can't believe that such gourgeous typeface was only made to be thrown on top of
  a thirty-thousand-glyphed Chinese mammoth, so maybe there is an original somewhere?
  \r\n Thanks ever so much."

    also the same design for their latin parts. [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myriad_(typeface)#Kozuka_Gothic|I've
    also discovered]] the latin part of [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/adobe/kozuka-gothic-pr6n/|Kozuka
    Gothic]] (sans-serif compagnion of Kozuka Mincho) was adapted from Myriad. Unfortunately,
    I don't know any serif compagnion for Myriad.\r\nFor what it's worth, the only
    one that comes to my mind when looking at this sample is [[http://www.myfonts.com/search/bookman|Bookman]]
    (Light) or its recent revival by Mark Simonson called [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/marksimonson/bookmania/|Bookmania]]."
