  pairs document here at typofile long time ago, usefull info. I see in Fontlab -
  Kerning Assistance - that one is able to open Kerning Assistance files and .txt
  files as well. How do I do this? And can I use the kerning pairs.txt?

  body: Select WINDOW, NEW METRICS WINDOW, and click the KERN &#40;green K&#41; button.
    Then find the button that has an ellipsis &#40;...&#41; on it. Click that, then
    click OPEN, and you can load your kerning pair text file, and it will become you
    default kerning file. <BR> <BR>If you want to use the Auto-Kern feature, select
    the option of &#34;All the pairs from the following list&#34; &#40;or words to
    that effect&#41;, and Auto-Kern will use you default file as well.
