  more specifically in the nameplates of the Vipers. Since my own inquiries produced
  no results, I'm turning to you for help.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance."

  body: I imagine this was a custom-made font. There are plenty of fonts inspired
    by the one used in the show's title, but I haven't been able to find anything
    like this one.
