  body: Way too many to list - but if my font purchasing habits are any indication
    then [[http://christianschwartz.com/|Christian Schwartz]] and [[http://blog.positype.com/|Neil
    Summerour]] are at the top of the list. I have quite a few of their faces.

  body: "As Simon says - too many to list - so just some random picks: [[http://klim.co.nz/|Kris
    Sowersby]] (National), [[http://new.myfonts.com/search/scaglione/people/?view=list|Scaglione
    & Burian]], and many of the designers at [[http://www.ourtype.be/|OurType]] including
    Smeijers (Ludwig and many other superb designs), Thiemich (Alto). Dan Reynolds'
    [[http://www.linotype.com/5831/malabar.html|Malabar]]. Some of the work of [[http://www.felicianotypefoundry.com/main/|Feliciano
    Type Foundry]] (Merlo, Rongel, Stella). [[http://www.linotype.com/793/adrianfrutigertraces.html|Adrian
    Frutiger]] has done great work his entire career - more recently, new releases
    of classics like Univers Next and produced new designs such as Frutiger Serif.
    [[http://www.gerardunger.com/|Gerard Unger]] is notable (Swift).\r\n\r\nFor broader
    surveys see [[http://typographica.org/2009/features/our-favorite-typefaces-of-2008/|Typographica's
    Favourites of 2008]], and [[http://tdc.org/tdc/tdc2-2009-winners|TDC Best of 2009]]

  body: "To me, [[http://christianschwartz.com|Christian Schwartz]] because he consistently
    delivers outstanding designs, [[http://www.ludwiguebele.de|Ludwig \xDCbele]] because
    his designs are much more ineresting than most stuff designed at the moment, [[http://www.lucasfonts.com|Lucas
    de Groot]] simply because he designed TheSans, and Robert Slimbach, who has given
    us some of the most useful types available today. And, last but not least, Adrian
    Frutiger, the greatest master of all."

  body: "<a href=\"http://www.ourtype.be\">Fred Smeijers</a>. One of the most versatile
    and inventive designers.\r\nAll his fonts are supreme, for instance I love <a
    href=\"http://www.teff.nl/fonts/renard/index.html\">Renard</a> and <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/designer/fred_smeijers/\">Arnhem</a>.
    And his classic Quadraat of course."
