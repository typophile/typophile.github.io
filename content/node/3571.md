  body: i was searching for some indic fonts a couple months back and found C-DAC
    has some really beautiful fonts. If yer familiar with Luc&#39;s pages, he has
    a link on his Indic page to their typography website. unfortunately, i didn&#39;t
    find any designer information in conjunction with their excellent faces. but they&#39;re
    worth looking at!
