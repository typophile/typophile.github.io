  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Hi all.

What with web fonts becoming more viable, I'm revisiting the sans-serif that's paired with my client's serif, Century Schoolbook. It was Arial.

I did my homework and it suggests something nicely grot/gothic, so I'm trying out News Cycle (which, I think, shares DNA with News Gothic and Franklin Gothic). It's holding up well in print (sans for headers, serif for body) but not so well on-screen (News Cycle for body text is very thin and light).

Of course I'm experimenting with other options, and Frutiger-like / Avenir-like faces are working out gorgeously. So it's got me searching for the good serif to pair with them.

More homework, of course: I learned that there's Meridien and similar. Problem is, that's too much of a departure from Century Schoolbook. I may have leeway to update the main logo/identity, but only in an evolutionary kind of way (rather than a clear departure).

<strong>Bottom line: what looks like Century Schoolbook, but more up-to-date and more matchable to Frutiger/Avenir?</strong>

Thanks, in advance, for your brains.

Yours,
Amado</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Simply because a typeface falls "out of fashion" does not mean that it does not remain a good, attractive and serviceable typeface. Furthermore, Century Schoolbook <em>actually</em> shares DNA with News Gothic and Franklin Gothic, because all three were designed by Morris Fuller Benton. Is it possible that you're overthinking this, and finding a problem where none exists?</div>

		<div class="commentbody">The Font Bureau's <a href="http://www.fontbureau.com/fonts/BentonModern/styles/">Benton Modern</a> would be a compatible text face that works well in print; Their 'Reading Edge' version of Benton Modern was drawn specifically for screen & is available through their web service, <a href="http://www.webtype.com/font/bentonmodernre-family/">WebType</a>.
Nick Shinn's <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/shinntype/scotch_modern_full_family/">Scotch Modern</a> comes in a variety of cuts (quite handy for book work) and looks fine on most screens when set at a reasonable size. Both these suggestions come with companion sanses, I might add: Benton Sans (drawn in the vein of News Gothic) and Figgins Sans, respectively.

If you're looking to depart from the high contrast of the moderns a bit, I might suggest Kent Lew's <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/fontlist/families/whitman/">Whitman</a>. It makes for some very, very approachable text.</div>

Excelsior—in the Century vein, but little used today (should count for some cachet); its proportions have a similar grandeur to Avenir.

		<div class="commentbody">All,

I've gotten some fantastic direction here, thanks so much.

Nothing against Century Schoolbook - it has served this client well, and I would probably prefer to find a Franklin/News webfont that I think I can make work on-screen as body text, and go with that. Fewer things to change. 

But if the client asks for a sans that's more Frutiger-esque (rather than FranklinNews-esque), I want somewhere to go.

For this application, I find both Whitman and Mondegreen wonderful. But Kinney is, I think, perfect. The kind of face that the client might not even recognize as changed, but that will go well with a sans more geometric than gothic.

So, thanks again. Feel free to weigh in if you've got anything to add.</div>

<cite>Avenir (1988) is "up-to-date"?</cite>

Times Roman (1932) is up-to-date, and even Goudy Old Style (1915) hardly seems dated. On the other hand, Century Expanded (1900) is starting to show a little age.

Of course, current revivals of Garamond and Baskerville are still going strong. But, sadly, in my admittedly inexpert opinion, Cloister Lightface (1924) for some reason does seem to have a slight tinge of the period in which it was designed, rather than being a pure and timeless revival of the original Jenson.

And so Optima (1955) is still daring and modern.

Thus, a typeface being designed in 1988 is no barrier to being up-to-date. Even if ITC Stone, from 1987, is described as an "ITC Classic", I think it is quite novel.</div>
