  be interested to find out why is the serif font typeface not deployed on computer
  keyboards, laptops and netbooks keyboards,  computer printers, telephones and other

  say from a colour design perspective or better still if you have had keyboard projects,
  why are the vast majority of the computer keyboards, laptops and netbooks keyboards
  black coloured these days as if they were a London taxicab?\r\n\r\n"

    because it's simpler and unobtrusive. Plus sans forms are closer to what we make
    when we write (not too relevant these days though) and they're easier to decipher
    individually.\r\n\r\nAs for them being white-on-black: note that a lot of laptops
    have lighted keys...\r\n\r\nBTW it's very interesting that most keyboards use
    oblique type. I couldn't figure it out until I used a late-model Mac (which uses
    upright type) to type something: the letters on the left looked like they're falling
    backwards, and there's an overall impression of inconsistency - quite disconcerting.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

      because that's what IBM used on the original keyboard for the IBM Personal Computer.\r\n\r\nOther
      keyboard makers today will imitate the Macintosh, and use an italic sans-serif
      typeface.\r\n\r\nBefore the IBM PC, while there were exceptions, the standard
      for keyboard keycaps was Leroy lettering. For those who are unfamiliar with
      this, it's a type of lettering guide so that a drawing pen will move in the
      shape of a letter, made by Keufel and Esser."

    keys...\r\n\r\nYes I think that's a factor. And on laptops, which are frequently
    a silver color, the contrast of darker keys looks nice. Another factor might be
    that Apple switched to black keys on their MacBook Air and Macbook Pro a few years
    ago, and since those models have sold very well the look may have influenced some
    other laptop makers."
