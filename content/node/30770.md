body: I need to analyse a series of printed adverts of the same product or company
  from the past to the present. I was wondering what adverts have made you stop and
  look. What adverts did it for you. Which ones do you think are the best and why?
  I have to choose just one product or company and analyse the past ads to the present
  and ho wthey worked in those days and have they kept up their style or status of
  the product and if so why? Was it a celebrity they used in those days due to the
  fact that he/she was famous  but could not be used today because they are ether
  not around or famous anymore etc. I have to analyse the style, the layouts, the
  message, the images etc and what they are trying to put across etc. In brief everything.
  Any suggestions on where to start? Benneton ads are good to analyse but anyone got
  any other ideas? Thanks.

      a product?

    since their inception was from PT Barnum - one of the most famous marketers ever
    in America.\r\n\r\nI don't like him but he's very influential.\r\n\r\nAnti-smoking
    ads also seem like a likely candidate.\r\n\r\nThe milk campaign.\r\n\r\nTarget
    pre-cool and present.\r\n\r\nApple computers.\r\n\r\nThere's plenty of opportunity

  body: "Hi MissG\r\n\r\nThis sounds very similar to a project called 'Zeitgeist'
    that appears in the History Culture Context programm in year two of the degree
    I teach on; students are required to analyse pictorial advertising for the same
    product from three different decades of the twentieth century.\r\n\r\nIn that
    advertising practice mirrors wider cultural concerns, my advice would be to pick
    something that has either always been quite consistent in it's presentation (i.e.
    products like life insurance or holiday packages) or shows a changing public perception
    over time (i.e. products like condoms or cigarettes). Generally the differences
    in the ads, and therefore the analysis you can wring out of them, are more pronounced
    between the very old and the very new, so you need to choose an advertising category,
    product or service that's been around for quite a while.\r\n\r\nI personally think
    Benetton ads said everything about the advertiser and nothing about the product;
    at the height of Toscani's 'reign of infamy' my heavily pregnant co-worker (expecting
    for the first time, a pair of twins \u2013 which she was understandably apprehensive
    about) had to daily endure the very messy and unsettling visuals of the 'new born
    baby' poster and press campaign. I remember thinking how unfair that was."

    body: Thanks Ben, I'm in yr 2 of my degree too. I will take your advice on board
      and decide after much research. I was thinking of another idea that popped up
      whilst doing research was to write about the print ads that were banned and
      the reason for it or adverts aimed at women in the 1960's as housewives and
      how women are targeted now i.e. what kind of products etc and how attitudes
      have changed throughout the decades. What do you think? We can either choose
      a product and see how it has changed throughout the decades or choose a product
      and compare and contrast with another product that is of the smae kind i.e.
      perfume against another perfume or anything like I have mentioned above.

  body: "Actually the last time I stopped to talk with a year 2 student specifically
    about this they ended up very much more confused than they were before I offered
    my tuppence worth! Research like this raises all manner of questions that necessarily
    don't always get answered within the project scope or timeframe.\r\n\r\nI seem
    to remember there is a handy essay on this kind of thing in <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Design-Writing-Research-Ellen-Lupton/dp/0714838519/sr=1-1/qid=1169434747/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1/104-6251580-6773560?ie=UTF8&s=books\">
    Design Writing Research</a> by Ellen Lupton and J Abbot Miller. The essay deals
    with images of race in 1960s American advertising.\r\n\r\nIf you're wanting to
    do a gender-specific focus or look at the impact that 60s/70s feminism had on
    advertising I think you could profitably do a formal brainstorming session on
    this to see what you <em>really</em> want to look at... and it strikes me that
    it would be better not to try contrasting product A against product B. Good luck."

  body: Definately true. Better to choose the safer option than struggle. I may do
    the idea I mentioned above or Mcdonald adverts that have changed through out the
    years to more healthier advertising i.e. encouraging fruit etc or benneton ads.
    I like to follow advertising of one company and one product but analyse how it
    has changed than contrast and compare. Too much to take on board, specially when
    there's lots more work to be done. Thanks for you help Ben. Thank you.

  body: Go to some weekend flea markets, with all the nostalgia stuff. There are usually
    one or two vendors who have old magazines. Look through the magazines until you
    come across a brand that is still around. IMO that's better than getting your
    material second hand from art director awards annuals or graphic design history
    books. You get a lot more context.
