  attached are details of an inverted c and e sporting odd hook-like\r\ndiacritics.
  The final attachment has the e in context -- raised slightly\r\nfrom the baseline
  and a little smaller than its arguments. \r\n\r\nAny thoughts on these hooks?"

    an abbreviation for ae and has been used since the early middle ages. \r\nhttp://www.decodeunicode.org/w3.php?nodeId=383&page=1&lang=1&zoom=&prop=\r\n\r\nas
    2-001-002 shows, Frege seems to have used any odd shaped glyph for his equations.
    And he used them upside down to prevent any misinterpretation as a letter; remember
    the thread about the pound abbreviation. \r\nhttp://typophile.com/node/31818\r\n\r\nc-spuro2
    (also upside down) looks vaguely familiar to me, but I can't find an example.
    It is not a c with a cedille.\r\n\r\nWolfgang\r\n"

    body: "Hello again Wolfgang -- thanks for the reply. I initially\r\nthought an
      ogonek too, but now I'm not so sure: It looks too\r\nbig, it does not curl around
      to the right-hand side of its\r\nhost in the same way (or left, overturned)
      instead it sort\r\nof dangles. Also, the end is rather blunt. \r\n\r\nAs a indicator
      of nasality in vowels it certainly doesn't \r\nbelong on a c, so I though it
      might be a diacritic from \r\nsomewhere else grafted onto them both. \r\n\r\nAs
      to \"any odd shaped glyph\" I can agree with the \"odd\",\r\nbut Frege seem
      to me rather systematic in his symbolism.  \r\n\r\nCheers\r\n\r\nJim\r\n--\r\nhttp://pdfb.wiredworkplace.net/pub/jjg/"
