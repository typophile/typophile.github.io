  of VIER Magazine.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.slanted.de/eintrag/vier-beziehungen\r\n\r\nTake
  a look at the S, M and C. They are very characteristic for this typeface I think.\r\n\r\nThanks
  in advance!\r\n\r\nJuergen"

  body: "Thanks, frode frank, for the pictures!\r\n\r\nThank you, Queneau, for your
    post. Neuzeit looks almost like that typeface. But still the S is different. Maybe
    it's modified?\r\n\r\nAny other hints?\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\n\r\nJ\xFCrgen"
