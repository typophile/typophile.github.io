      Catalog? Is it available online? \r\n\r\nI tried Google-ing \"Dempsey Bold\"
      but it didn't really pan out. I'll keep looking, though!"

  body: The Phil's Photo catalog (phototype) called it Dempsey Medium. The only other
    digital version I'm aware of is Thomas E. Harvey's 'JoeLouis'. That was from 1992
    and may be tricky to find. It also uses what was Dempsey's alternate 'S', which
    is different from the default 'S' in your image.

    photolettering typefaces, I have one of their catalogs, it''s a good resource
    for identifying typefaces from before the computer era.'
