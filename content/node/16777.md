body: "Hi there, I was wondering if anyone had any ideas of a typefaces that are suited
  to body copy for corporate literature. Previously the designs in question used arial,
  but they are keen to 'push the boat out'(!) and go for something a little more contemporary
  and funky. any suggestions?\r\n\r\nI'm talking about a company involved in finance
  etc so a suitable typeface should evoke solidarity and dependability, not too 'fun'
  for want of a better word.\r\n\r\nAny thoughts at all are greatly appreciated.\r\n\r\nR."

      the sans serif avenues first though."

    about Myriad? Do you think it is too similar to Arial?

    most demanding corporate material.\r\n\r\nAnd what about <a href=\"http://www.vllg.com/Village/GalaxiePolaris/mudTyper+Weights/\">Galaxie
    Polaris</a>? More generous in width, a nice tension in the superellipse curves,
    has all the feature-rich OpenType goodness, and it's very subtle in its modernity.
    A sure winner."
