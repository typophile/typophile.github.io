    know, it&#39;s hard to ID one of those only with 5 letters. ;-&#41;

  body: Hi Sam! Sorry I didn&#39;t have time to help you  <BR>earlier on. That&#39;s
    why I quickly posted the link  <BR>to the typewriters thread so you could already  <BR>take
    a look for yourself. Now that I&#39;ve had the  <BR>chance to double-check the
    Vintage Type samples,  <BR>it dawned on me that my previous post proved to  <BR>be
    pretty pointless <i>&#40;howzat for an alliteration? ;&#41; &#41;</i>.  <BR> <BR>I
    hoped you would find a match amongst them, but  <BR>alas, no such luck. There
    must be more worn-out  <BR>typewriter fonts, but once we get off the beaten  <BR>path
    and enter the realm of free/shareware, it gets  <BR>a lot tougher to locate the
    goods. <BR> <BR>Let&#39;s hope somebody else recognizes your sample...
