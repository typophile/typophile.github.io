  typographers and type designers?\r\n\r\nCalling a type designer a typographer...\r\n...is
  like calling composers musicians.\r\nOr choreographers dancers.\r\nOr authors writers.\r\nAnd
  so on.\r\n\r\nI suppose it could have been worse.\r\nAt least we weren't identified
  as font developers :-)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    smell? :-)\r\n\r\nChrisL"

    that he would loose a long held secret. His sixth tool from the top, in the examples,
    proves that Helvetica was in fact derived from the scripts of Zaner himself with
    influences from the tablets from Ugar.\r\n\r\nBy the way, the term typographer
    originated in Ptolemaic times and was spelled with a P. They were the center of
