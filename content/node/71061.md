  No games here, but apps that help me stay productive and get the job done.  I am
  interested in hearing from other dorks.  I dabble with sound, film, design and productivity
  apps and these are a few that I can't live without. How about you?  \r\n\r\nAbleton

    Photoshop, but I wouldn't be happy.\r\n\r\nAlso, I guess if I really think about
    it, I could live with either only Illustrator or only InDesign, since I <em>can</em>
    do vector graphics in InDesign, and I <em>can</em> do layout in Illustrator. I
    think I'd prefer to live with only Illustrator. But again, I wouldn't be happy.\r\n\r\nActually,
    a piece of software that makes a huge difference in my productivity is Leopard,
    because of searchable menus. My workstation at my university newspaper was still
    running Tiger when I graduated (a month ago), and I always kept my laptop open
    next to it just so I wouldn't get lost in Creative Suite's sea of menu items."

  body: "thamilton -\r\nawesome- never knew about art directors tool kit - looks like
    something i need.\r\njazzhustler - \r\ni never learned reason but i have friends
    who love it. Cubase is great but Logic Audio is pretty similar, and I've spent
    more time with it thatn Cubase.  I also love Pro Tools but only with the Waves
    software package. As far as Ableton- I love the Live aspect of it and now it works
    with Max/MSP which is unbelievable.\r\ndrdoc-\r\nI really only use Photoshop,
    InDesign and Illustrator from the CS5 collection.  I use the others from time
    to time but those two are a have to have in my book.  The stability offered on
    Leopard is a huge reason I am a mac fan.  I've removed all Corel from my computers.
