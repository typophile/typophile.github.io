  believe that \"non-transformable\" glyph shapes are inherently more legible than
  those which can be transformed into other characters simply by rotating or flipping.
  Which gives serifed type the advantage.'\r\n\r\nI would agree with this, but can
  anyone suggest any non-transformable serif typefaces that fit this task? \r\n\r\nThanks\r\n\r\nR"

    it's something that makes type easier to read, which can't be measured (just as

    did a good job marketing it, but the construction... There have been some books
    marketed towards dyslectics printed with the typeface though. And they seem to
    sell to schools. (which doesn't please all the dyslexia specialists)\r\n\r\nThere
    has been heaps of research into legibility and the serif vs sans battle, but real
    conclusive research is found sparsely, and most of them contradict each other
    again. But that distinctive letters aid reading does help, and for dyslectic,
    breaking the rhythm does as well."

  body: Read Regular was a Helen Hamlyn research project instigated by a Dutch student
    at the RCA some years back. It was never released because the designer did not
    want it in the 'wrong hands'. The typeface was tested to be used for optimal legibility
    purposes only in conjunction with 'correct' typesetting. I guess the only person
    to be able to typeset it 'correctly' was the student herself. Although I am not
    dyslexic myself I have read a book typeset in Read Regular and I find it incredibly
    easy to read. I don't find it 'ugly' at all and I think it's a fantastic project
    with a real purpose of trying to improve people's lives and their experiences
    of reading... It may not be perfect, but opens up a lot of debate and avenues
    for other type designers to explore.
