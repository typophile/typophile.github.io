body: "Heya everyone,\r\n\r\nI'd really appreciate any feedback you feel like give
  on this online photographic portfolio.\r\n\r\nSo far its been through a few rounds
  of changes, and i'm starting to feel like it is nearly done.  The client is pretty
  happy with it, but i'd really like some non-biased critique.  \r\n\r\nUnfortunately
  i dont have the luxury of an artistic director, so it can be really difficult to
  recognise potential problems and find ways to make things better.\r\n\r\nIts worth
  noting that i've used raster previews of Relay Regular and Fresco Script from Fontshop
  and removed the watermarks.  This means i have no tracking/kerning control.  Of
  course, i'll buy the faces when i know they'll definitely be part of the website.\r\n\r\nCheers
  for all your input!\r\n\r\n~ Update ~ \r\nAlternative compostitions (refer to post

  body: I find "PORTFOLIO" out of place, and I wonder why it is condensed.

  body: "Yep, i agree that it is out of place.  Everything else is trying to be organic,
    and the word \"PORTFOLIO\" seems a bit to clean or geometric.  I guess it doesnt
    really add anything.  It just kinda sits there.  Maybe it would be best to leave
    it out all together?\r\n\r\nAs far as being condensed, well there was no particular
    reason for that.  I've noticed that I tend to lean towards condensed faces though,
    not entirely sure why, maybe because i feel like they have more impact. \r\n\r\nWhat
    is the traditional use for condensed faces?  I always thought it stemmed from
    newsprint where column widths are narrow and the space is expensive, so bold condensed
    faces are used at hight point sizes than copy to make the biggest impact in the
    smallest space?   "

  body: "Given the organic nature of the design I would look at redrawing the tabs
    so that little nick in the top left doesn't repeat. As discussed Portfolio is
    out of place and not really required. I wonder about the overall composition the
    tabs and the picture select boxes hem in the top and right, if the tabs pulled
    from the bottom of the image (or under the picture select boxes) and Portfolio
    was dropped you would be able to show the images at a larger scale and give you
    room to manoeuvre when it comes to pictures with different proportions. the \"stitched
    edged\" type in the background also seems a bit extraneous the point of a portfolio
    is ultimately to show the work to its best and the neutral oatmeal background
    is probably enough.\r\nTim"

  body: "Yeah, absolutely re: nicks on the tabs.  At construction time, these will
    be made unique.\r\n\r\nGood ideas about navigation alterations too.  I think the
    navigation needs to have proximity to the photo display area otherwise it might
    start feeling like a regular website with normal menus etc.  I'm not sure about
    pulling tabs 'down' though, it doesnt seem right.  In reality, if you were looking
    down at a desk, it would be easier/more natural to reach over a photo and pull
    away from the body as opposed to pulling one towards your body.   Maybe pulling
    them left to right from behind the image select boxes could work.  It would offer
    the same sort of flexiblity for different orientation (which i hadn't even thought
    about!  What am i going to do with portrait?)\r\n\r\nHm, this raises many questions...\r\n\r\nI'll
    shuffle some things around and post again soon...\r\n\r\nCheers Tim!\r\n"

  body: "Ok, here are a few alternative compositions.\r\n\r\nFirst up, i've tried
    to maintain navigation that is attached to the photo.  It's hard to accomodate
    portrait and landscape orientation because unless the whole lot moves around (which
    is a nav/usability nightmare) the different orientations leave very different
    whitespace.  So its hard to balance the page.\r\n\r\nHeres the results:\r\nportrait:

    more flexibility, if I detach the groupings from the actual photos, that means
    photos can be arranged a bit more elegantly, something like this:\r\n\r\nportrait:

    \r\n\r\nWhat do you think (and apologies for getting off topic a bit, i guess
    we're talking more about layout than typography now... sorry!)"

  body: "003 seems the best way to go, something I might look at though is the portfolio,
    about, contact tabs, might be more user friendly at the top (as 002). \r\nDon't
    worry about layout vs type, one needs the other for both to function.\r\nTim"
