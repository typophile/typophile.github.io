body: "Hello,\r\n\r\nI have a new MacBook Pro (intel) laptop. The OS is Mac OS X 10.5.
  The installed version of Python is 2.5.\r\n\r\nI wanted to install RoboFab, but
  RoboFab's site states that it only works with versions 2.3 and below. I went to
  a MacPython site to download an older version, but the builds say that these'll
  only work with PowerPC processors.\r\n\r\nIs there a way that I can replace my version
  of Python with an older version that will allow me to use RoboFab?\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\nDan"

  body: "Try this double click installer <a href=\"http://www.iro.umontreal.ca/~boyer/typophile/getpython-2.3.zip\">getpython-2.3.zip</a>;
    this will compile from the sources and in the end, you need to provide your installation
    password. Some patience is required. If this works tell me (I am on a powerpc).

  body: I'm running FLS5 in 10.5 on an Intel Mac, and Robofab seems to work, although
    I haven't used it much since upgrading. FLS doesn't tell me what version of Python
    is installed. I didn't do anything special in FLS when I upgraded to 10.5.
