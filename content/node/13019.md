  the style of type used for the teams name \"BICYCLEGROUP\". They need a type that
  can be seen clearly. The attached image shows what I have now which is the over-used
  and boring (to me) Futura font.\r\n\r\nthanks for any and all feedback."

  body: "Hi Esteve, I too have designed a Bicyclist's Kit. I have samples at my site.
    What I would change is make the main name on the front and back solid white. When
    your sprinting to the line at 30+ mph you need simplisity to be read at the line.
    The red is to close to the blue in the tonal range to be distinctive even with
    a white stroke.\r\n\r\nOne other thought, its popular now to put the name on the
    back of the shorts. Its very visible especially if you have a dot com."

    body: "Thank Dan.\r\n\r\nI'll take your advice and change the red text to white.
      In regards to the shorts. The members of the team wanted to go with a lower
      cost short. This lower cost short does not have the space to put a logo/text
      on the back of the short.\r\n\r\nThanks again for your input.\r\n\r\nSteve"

  body: "Hi Esteve,\r\nI'm a bike-rider myself and I designed the jerseys too. \r\nHonestly
    I don't think it's a good design, it not very clear, try keeping it simple, bigger
    typo maybe, probably better in white. Loose the globe, that's no good.\r\nTo lower
    the cost I used plain blue shorts, which you can buy anywhere.\r\nTake a look
    at this link, I used a The Mix from Luc(as) De Groot.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.vosreinaert.be/wielrennen/fotos.shtml"

      logo and I cant touch it. I like the idea of bigger text.\r\n\r\nG'day"
