  times\r\nthrough the history. Its for a project im working on\r\nconcering colonialism/post
  colonialism \u2013 and I would like to use\r\nthe different cuts over time to emphasise
  the change and influence over time.\r\n\r\nIm really looking for sans serif examples
  (how far does it go back - 1850s?) \r\nI know also Caslon has been recutted many
  times over time,\r\n\r\nI would really like to have some advise concerning this\r\nquestion
  and also if you could recommend typefaces\r\nthat has been changed over time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n/

  body: "This is tricky because when they re-cut a design (which was certainly done
    a lot) they also usually renamed it! And in a way that was part of the natural
    cultural transition of the day. So maybe it's better to look at the transformations
    of type design as a whole - which is of course of a very broad and fuzzy subject
    (and well presented in Lawson's Anatomy). Maybe you could narrow this down by
    choosing a \"lineage\" that's long and relatively focused (even if it's had offshoots).
    In the sans realm this is especially hard because the history is so much shorter
    (in typography if not lettering). Maybe the ?...AkzidenzGrotesk...Helvetica...Unica...?
    lineage.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    to compare I guess?\r\n\r\nBTW, the \"original\" was unlikely to have actually
    been 13 point. Most likely, since I'm guessing it was an all-caps font, the baseline
    was not followed, the caps filled the height, and so it was probably a 12 (or
    maybe even smaller) in physical size.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: I don't know, to my untrained eye these two sanses look quite different. That
    S in the old print is so funky and not just from the roughness, and the R and
    B are so light in the middle. It's quite odd! Are there any fonts like this that
    I could buy? The rough edges are rubbish but I suppose one can't avoid them in
    something so old. Is the type in the ad the very first sans serif? 1843 was quite
    early for sans serifs wasn't it?

  body: "Thanks alot, these are all great tips. \r\nIm doing a small book for my school.
    And basically, the theme is post-colonialism. Never mind how exact the translation
    of the nature of the typeface is, i dont think its so important. I think it will
    make it too complicated and confusing. \r\n\r\nThe idea is basically that I will
    use one typeface, that was redesign over time. I now have Caslon, which ive dated
    back to its original state in 1725, and its been redesigned/digitized at the latest
    in 93 i think. Whats interesting for me is the reason for all these redesigns,
    and the difference from its original state. \r\n\r\nSo im looking into one type
    family, because i think if i start looking into types that has been heavily influenced
    by eachother, like akizdens-helvetica-helvetica neue-pragmatica , that it might
    become a bit arbitrary, or less clear in the design. What are your thoughts on
    this?\r\n\r\nIm quite happy with my different Caslons, but another question remains,
    the difference between when it was first designed, and the digitalization of it.
    there is a difference... Most of the cuts were originally designed pre 1900, but
    digitzed only recently. I wonder how much got lost in the process.\r\n\r\nNick;
    this example is very nice,\r\nI would lvoe to find out more about if there exists
    a family of sans serifs which also has been redesigned over time. (where does
    the border go from redesigned to a new name, and keeping the same name but  making
    new version? (like helvetic and hevletica neue/ Akzidens grotesk/Helvetica...)\r\n\r\nwould
    love to hear your thoughts on this...\r\ndag\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Dag, as I am working on a new revival of Caslon, I have looked in to the
    history of the revivals. One of the things I found, as I explained in my talk
    at TypeCon this summer, is that all of the revivals from the second part of the
    19th century on have recut characters in them, particularly in the italic. None
    of the revivals is in fact a replica of the original, including Founder's Caslon,
    though most, including Founder's, have claimed to be 'authentic'. (I am not aiming
    to be authentic, just good!) \r\n\r\nWhat happened, as historian James Mosley
    explained to me, is that in the mid-19th century machine casting of type came
    in, and this burned out matrices in a way that hand casting had not. And punches
    break. Consequently there was a lot of recutting in the 19th century, generally
    none of it admitted. To track and sort out the whole story would take a year's
    work, at least. \r\n\r\nATF's versions are regularized compared to Caslon's original
    (especially in digital versions of course, such as digital Caslon 540). Monotype
    had to work with the limitations of their 'unit' system, and Linotype their 'duplex'
    system, both of which limited in different ways how accurately they could reproduce
    the originals that they had--which were not actually original in many cases, as
    I said. Also they often shortened descenders, which was the fashion then for economical
    setting. The most recent versions of Caslon are, I believe, Founder's Caslon,
    and Paul Hunt's redigitization for P22 of Lanston Monotype's version. Also P22
    issued a 'Franklin's Caslon' based on things Benjamin Franklin had used.  \r\n\r\nThrough
    all this, Caslon has retained an elusive magic and fascination that has continued
    from its first revival in 1844. "

    \ Even though the revivial of the old meant that it changed face from how the
    type was originaly intended, it still meant that- or maybe even more interesting,
    means that the foundry that revived it added elements which they saw fit to the
    current time. \r\n\r\nHrant,\r\nthats great, ill look into that! \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThanks

    regarding akzidenz grotesk (AG) and helvetica: \r\noften people say that AG is
    a direct ancestor of helvetica, but this is wrong. as far as i know, akzidenz
    grotesk itself is derived from various sources, mainly royal grotesk by theinhardt.
    many cuts were added over time (AG Schulbuch, AG Schoolbook, etc.) and werent
    part of the original design. more about this <a href=\"http://typophile.com/node/17643\"

    on the other hand, especially the redesign of it by linotype (helvetica neue),
    is a very clean, neutral grotesk with way less character than AG - which was the
    aim back then but seems like a negative point to me nowadays. both Credit Suisse

    the credit it has regained over the last years.\r\n\r\nfran\xE7ois rappo, swiss
