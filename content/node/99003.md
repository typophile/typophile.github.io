body: "Hi guys!!\r\n\r\nSo I'm a graphic design student and a huge fan of type, and
  for some time, I've been wanting to splurge and buy FontLab. I'm doing a directed
  study course on type design next semester, so I felt it was time. Thus, I went on
  the website to find the student pricing.... and found that the only option was for
  a year license. Honestly, I can't justify paying $119 for what basically amounts
  to a rental!!\r\n\r\nSo, I thought I'd ask you guys- do you know anywhere that offers
  the full FontLab academic pricing for STUDENTS? All the websites I've looked at,
  only offer the academic pricing for colleges and faculty.\r\n\r\nI have a personal
  policy of never pirating software- however, I can't help but feel, if there isn't
  a student pricing option out there, that FontLab is encouraging it! Honestly- what
  student can afford FontLab at full price?!"

  body: For my students I use TypeTool (30 euros for academic version). No vectorisation,
    no class kerning but anything else...

  body: "Not <em>quite</em> 'anything' else... no hinting/instructions either (other
    than auto-hinting, and some minor control over per-character Type 1 stem hints),
    no optical sizing or scaling transformations, no other OT features like stylistic
    alternates.  But it is excellent value for money, and you can upgrade to the full
    FontLab later for a roughly equivalent discount. \r\n\r\nI still use TT for almost
    everything.  I've decided it's about time to get FL but I, too, wanted to wait
    and see if there was some kind of academic pricing (I'm planning on going in for
    grad school soon).  \r\n\r\nI admit I don't understand this 'rental' concept.
    \ Shouldn't paying installments at least get you a discount on the eventual purchase?
    \ But I can't find any indication of that on FL's website.  I mean, if I pay over
    $200 to use FontLab for two years as a student, and then decide to buy the whole
    thing later, does that previously-paid amount count for nothing?  Because otherwise
    I'll end up paying a lot <em>more</em> than I would if I'd just bought it at the
    start...\r\n"

  body: Fontlab used to offer a 45% discount for students but they changed the license
    policy earlier this year for some reason. Being unaware of this upcoming change
    I had just purchased the software with discount four days before they made the
    announcement...

  body: "Kailene, \r\n\r\nyou say \"Honestly, I can't justify paying $119 for what
    basically amounts to a rental!\". Most educational licenses are like that (not
    just FontLab's). A \"student license\" typically means that you can use the software
    as long as you're a student. When you graduate, you should upgrade to a full commercial
    license. \r\n\r\nAll, \r\n\r\nAt Fontlab Ltd., we changed our student pricing
    policy for several reasons. There are many more font editing and type design applications
    on the market today than there were a few years ago. If you're studying to become
    a type designer, you may likely need several applications, e.g. FontLab Studio,
    RoboFont, Metrics Machine and Glyphs. Therefore, we felt that a much lower entry
    price for students for our applications would allow them to use their budget more
    reasonably. On the other hand, if you don't study a full type design course but
    rather need a font editor for a type design class within a graphic design course,
    you'll most likely need the application for less than a year. Also, we found that
    quite a few students purchased a student license and continued to use it after
    they finished studying without upgrading to the full license. \r\n\r\nThat's we
    switched to a model for annual licensing. So Fontlab Ltd. currently offers one-year
    student licenses at US$119 for FontLab Studio 5, US$79 for Fontographer 5 and
    US$23 for TypeTool 3. \r\n\r\nAfter your one year licensing period expires, you
    can renew your license for another year. Also, at any time you can upgrade to
    the full license by *just paying the difference*. If you keep paying for the annual
    licenses, after 5.5 years your license will be converted into a full license anyway.
    Therefore, you'll *never pay more than the full price*. (I now realize that this
    is not really clearly stated in the information on our web page, so we'll add
    this clarification.)\r\n\r\nPreviously, a student license for FontLab Studio used
    to cost US$357. Now the same price gets you a three-year license. So the new model
    certainly has advantages and disadvantages: if you study shorter than for three
    years, the new model clearly is better; if you study longer than for three years,
    then indeed the older model was better. However, we felt that the advantages of
    the new model outweighs the disadvantages, especially since it offers a very attractive
    \"entry pricing\". If you just want some simple font-related work done for a semester
    project, then $23 for a one-year TypeTool license really is very affordable. \r\n\r\nHope
    this helps! \r\n\r\nBest regards,\r\nAdam Twardoch\r\nFontlab Ltd."

  body: "@Adam,\r\nThank you for the explanation.  The website was indeed not very
    clear before, so the clarification is much appreciated.  It does in fact seem
    like a sensible policy, now the ambiguity is ironed out."
