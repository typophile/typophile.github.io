  I completely removed the kerning, and re-kerned the entire font. (That part was
  completely intentional.) But when I test the font in InDesign CS2, the kerning is
  not correct. For example, the period/quotedblright pair should be -130. When used
  in InDesign CS2, that kern pair comes out as -50. An AFM exported from the generated
  font doesn't match the VFB in number of kern pairs, either.\r\n\r\nI tried starting
  fresh by making a new empty VFB, and copying each character into the new font (kerning
  not copied with glyphs), then importing a good AFM, then generating a new font with
  a new name, and it still doesn't work.\r\n\r\nI have tried generating the font in
  different ways, and only MacOS Roman encoding seems to solve the kerning issue.
  However, when I use MacOS Roman encoding, the \"space\" character is highlighted
  in InDesign as a missing font (InDesign applies a color background to text that
  is using a missing font). When I test in Illustrator CS2, the spaces appear as question
  marks. The final format for these fonts is supposed to be Macintosh PostScript Type
  1.\r\n\r\nI also tried removing the space characters (regular and non-breaking),
  and just starting fresh glyphs without pasting anything by setting the space width
  in the metrics window. That produced the same result (missing font in InD).\r\n\r\nPlease
  note that this is just one of three fonts, and all three fonts exhibit this same
  behavior. That period/quotedblright kern pair comes out as -50 in all of them. I've
  tried a variety of encoding schemes and different formats. OpenType does work, the
  kerning comes out correct. I've tried changing the name of the fonts and installing
  them on different machines, and they all have the same problem. I also tried testing
  them in TextEdit (under Mac OS X 10.4), and they don't even show up in the font
  menu!\r\n\r\nI've been making fonts with FontLab for ages, and have never seen anything
  like this. OMG!! WTF am I doing wrong?! This is driving me insane! If anyone out
  there can help, I desperately need it.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nAlan"

  body: "Alan,\r\n\r\nPerhaps you encountered the bug in FLS which was reported and
    confirmed about 2 months ago. It concerns kerning and the FontInfo option of reordering
    glyphs on export. But this bug shouldn't affect export in Macintosh PostScript
    Type 1 format.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\nJohnych"
