    newspaper typeface, Universal book typeface, Universal signage typeface etc. All
    of that with in fact only one typeface family, Univers. Remember boring Newspaper
    design ragged left, asymetric layout, composed with strong grid in Sans serifs.
    The Guardian was like that longtime ago I think? no? <BR> <BR>So, I see three
    approch: <BR>John rationnal approch who tend to analyse anything, then do it.
    <BR>Swiss, no analyse, just applies universal rules. <BR>jfp, you design typeface
    in your image, you can&#39;t go another way. Vive la diff'

    <BR> <BR>I&#39;m basically like John: I try to analyze a lot, to clarify what
    design problem I&#39;m actually trying to solve. But -like John implied- cultural
    issues have to be taken into serious consideration in parallel to functionalist
    ones. <BR> <BR>In fact I was struggling with this myself, after I made Nour &#40;an
    Armenian font&#41;, and wanted to make a &#34;counter-balanced&#34; Latin. I ended
    up realizing that any <i>single</i> compromise  design would simply either make
    one half happy and the other happy very unhappy, or make both of them a little
    bit unhappy! And that&#39;s when I realized I needed a &#34;network&#34;, with
    primary and subordinate style in each script. Like this: <BR><a href="http://www.themicrofoundry.com/ss_rome2.html"
    target="_blank">http://www.themicrofoundry.com/ss_rome2.html</a> <BR> <BR>On the
    other hand, languages in the same script &#40;like what I&#39;ve been calling
    &#34;Latinate&#34; here&#41; might be close enough that it doesn&#39;t make sense
    to add such complexity, and it&#39;s better just to &#34;snap-to-grid&#34;, to
    some intelligent average. But I have a feeling that some Latinate lanaguages are
    just too different, for example German. <BR> <BR>&#62; Alejandro lo Celso <BR>

    key factor, Jared. As previously say: English suited typefaces, generally show
    quite wide bdpq. I generally made them narrow to save space and give more rhythm
    &#40;to my view, I don&#39;t know how you -- English speaking guys -- can see
    that effect invisible or not?&#41; <BR> <BR>Also, there is a very strong factor
    we need to take in our discussion. 80% of major classical faces has been made
    for Linotype-Monotype will all widths constraints. Just look at Times and check
    widths, many are same number to fit in Lino and Mono. Same for many others, such
    past Sabon... So, perhaps Dwiggins, Tschichold and others have some whishes about
    that question that they never find a way to achieve. no?'

    If it help to explorate the various letters widths we can do in a new typeface,
    its already very interesting. no? Why follow usual rules to lc widths, when for
    caps, there is at least two main one, Roman inscription proportions, and Didone/Grotesk
    proportions.
