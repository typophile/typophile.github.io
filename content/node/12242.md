  Zapf von Hesse is a master book binder and lettering artist in pre- and post-WWII
  Germany. In the late 1940s, she started teaching at the St\xE4del School of Art
  in Frankfurt. A typeface that she had been working on since the 1930s, [[Diotima]],
  was released by [[D. Stempel AG]] around this time. Somehow, she must have met the
  chief in-house type designer there ([[Hermann Zapf]]), as they were married in the
  early 1950s. \r\n\r\nIn the 1980s, Gudrun Zapf von Hesse began designing typefaces
  again. She released several typefaces through [[URW]], [[Bitstream]], [[Berthold]],
  and [[Linotype]].\r\n\r\nShe lives with her husband in Darmstadt, Germany. The Zapfs
  have a beautiful house, full of typographic treats.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.linotype.com/7-647-7-16331/gudrunzapfvonhesse.html\">All
  of Gudrun Zapf von Hesse's Linotype faces are available on this overview page at
  the Linotype Website</a>"
