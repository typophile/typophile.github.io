  body: i like what you&#39;re doing especially on a prefix like <i>post-</i> with
    so many varied connotations; also i love this typeface. personally though i find
    it too heavy in the bold with the tight letterspacing as it makes my eyes work
    very hard, especially at the o and s, and at a smaller point size &#40;below,
    my bad recreation at 24 pt&#41; and with any dot gain.. lighter perhaps &#40;hell
    bold shown at 48 pt&#41;?  <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/4981.gif"

  body: 'I didn&#39;t have a problem with the tight kerning on the first draft; I
    had more of an issue with the hyphen, feeling like it was floating too much, creating
    too much of a gap between it and the <i>t</i>. I hope you don&#39;t mind -- I
    tried messing with it a little. See what you think of this: <BR> <BR> <img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/5014.gif"

  body: I like 4 and 5 better than 6. It would be nice, though, to see it roughly
    in context. Do you have any page layouts you could try it out on?

    the white insides is the correct one. plus the ligatures works better. <BR> <BR>CG

  body: 'hmm... I agree that that setting the title in different type would give it
    a more unique look.  <BR> <BR>However, I must say that old logo creates much more
    interesting negative shapes: circles in p, o, and s which give it nice sense of
    unity. You achieved that sense too throgh the quality of lines in the new logo
    but the negative shapes there remain inactive. I think that messing around with
    the lighter weight can help a lot. [God... I sound just like my professor <IMG

    <BR> <BR>My personal fauvorite is #6 if it was letterspaced just a tiny bit more.

  body: I keep seeing &#34;oost&#34;-- <BR>You may want to mess with that a little
    bit. Eventhough you have a descender, there isnt much &#40;other than the sharp
    upper left corner of the p&#41; to discern the 2 from one another. The descender
    seems to be getting lost amongst the fluid horizontal motion you have set up.
    So as my eye is swept from left to right, it completely misses the p.
