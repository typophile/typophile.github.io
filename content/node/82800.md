  you can see, many foundries have \"their own\" thread there.\r\n\r\nThe reason why
  I ended there is cause in statistic of our page, I saw a reference link to thread
  where someone is asking for one our font. After that, I tried to register twice,
  but it says the moderators have to confirm the registration and that still didn't
  happened. So I tried to email webmaster@mininova.org with polite and reasonable
  request to delete that thread cause what they are doing is illegal and it's not
  fair cause some guys invested their time and money to make those fonts.\r\n\r\nStill
  got no answer from them...\r\n\r\nI guess many of you would be interested to find
  a way how and where to react against cases like this, so I'm wondering if anyone
  had any success and would be so kind to share with us the way how he/she/they managed
  to make Mininova remove thread/files... if any of you succeed that.\r\n\r\nI've
  read that some Dutch NGO 1-2 years ago succeeded to won the fight against them,
  probably there are some other (less known) cases where license owners won somehow,
  pressuring Mininova to remove illegal content.\r\n\r\n- Dusan"

    BTW: On other sites you will get lots of links to share hosters, so you can download
    directly. Why I know it? They often link directly to my foundry site for the preview

    you considered that having this additional exposure may ultimately be beneficial
    to your sales? Not trolling, just curious.

    \"plan\" behind everything. \r\n\r\nWebsites such as Mininova... they end up probably
    to be really relaxed when it's about sharing software, cause for example, if Adobe
    or Microsoft has their softwares on Mininova (probably not by their own will),
    the question is who the hell are we, font producers, to complain about?!? Why
    should they \"respect\" our requests when big companies are not saying a word
    about it (at least, not in public).\r\n\r\nMaybe foundries should group behind
    one email, threatening that they will hire legal team to deal with it."

  body: The piracy process starts with one of your paying customers. They 'lend' it
    to someone, who 'lends' it to someone else. I don't see why it would be so hard
    to embed the order number into the font, so at least you could trace the source
    of the leak. Sure it could easily be hacked by anyone with fontlab but I think
    most piracy is not so thought out. It starts with one person not really knowing
    that lending the font is piracy. In reality, what kind of person would pay for
    your font then share it with everyone else for free? Some weird philanthropist?!
    But yeah, mininova is a bad site for bad people. Console yourself with the fact
    that anyone who values their time so low that they'd rather spend hours searching
    to get a font free than cough up for it is never likely to pay for it anyway and
    even less likely to do much commercially profitable with it.

  body: "No. That there ought to be an easy way to find out who is leaking our fonts.
    Don't misunderstand me, it pisses me off just as much as the next foundry to see
    people trading MY stuff like they own it. When you see people asking on twitter,
    that's when you realise people don't even think of it as wrong. They wouldn't
    be so brazen otherwise\r\n"

    OS could request an ID/password when you want to install an font on your computer
    and that ID/password could be available only when you buy a license. But whatever
    it's made, all kinds of protection, it will leak anyhow at the end.\r\n\r\nI'm
    not smart to suggest anything on this topic... seems pointless even it hurts."
