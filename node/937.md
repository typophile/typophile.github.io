body: I know this has been done before, but this is my &#40;second&#41; attempt at
  a font that is all ligatures. <BR> <BR>Oh -- it&#39;s based on my Equanimity Stencil
  font except not stencillated. <BR> <BR><IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/1419.jpg"
  ALT="equan"> <BR> <BR>It is, as you can see, in its earliest stages. So, do you
  guys think I&#39;m wasting my time or is there something here worth pursuing?

    better than the word written... The spacing is a bit tight IMHO, but it looks
    promising, I like ligatures '

  body: I did a similar experiment with a font called Motorcar Atlas. <A HREF="http://fontdiner.com/fdlbfont07.gif"
    TARGET="_top">http://fontdiner.com/fdlbfont07.gif</A> <BR> <BR>I was overall pretty
    happy about the face until I began setting copy in it. I designed the face with
    connectors on BOTH sides of the lowercase so I doubled my pain when I was creating
    it. <BR> <BR>It was a good excersise and I do intend on reworking the face further
    to totally trouble shoot the workings of the ligature system and overall letterspacing
    of the font which will give to you most hassel as you can see with the IT ligature.
    It&#39;ll technically work properly, but visually have some odd moments. <BR>
    <BR>Can&#39;t wait to see the lowercase! Good Luck! <BR>Stuart :D

  body: ' If there&#39;s one lesson I&#39;ve learned in fontmaking it&#39;s that imposing
    ONE schtick on your typeface -- whether it&#39;s a repeating shape or, in this
    case requiring every letter to be a ligature -- just guarantees failure. As the
    Arby&#39;s ad goes, sometimes you just have to break the rules, including self-imposed
    ones. <BR> <BR>I think for me, having this font work will require that the ligatures
    be optional, not recommended -- an added bonus, not a dreary requirement. By having
    three different connections I&#39;d hoped to achieve something in that direction,
    but I don&#39;t think it worked. '
