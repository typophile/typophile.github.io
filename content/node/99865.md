  body: "I'm curious about the bitmaps:\r\n- I assume they're color BDFs. How did
    you make them?\r\n- How did you embed them?\r\n- How do you get them to render?
    :-/  Even just in b&w. Contemporary OSes block bitmap rendering.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "Love it. By the way - the Fontspace download includes the 26 .png files,
    but the Dafont zip file does not include them (even though the text on the page
    says that the archive contains bitmap files).\r\n\r\nhhp - I'm also curious about
    that!  I know that there are some utilities that allow you to select characters
    from appropriately set up bitmap alphabets with the keyboard. Scrap'N'fonts has
    one that works with THEIR raster alphabets.\r\n\r\n - Herb"

  body: No, but it's all pretty bad! Lots of original assembly line fonts, mostly
    themed, at $1 to $3. They're associated with InspireGraphics/LetteringDelights.  A
    side note on terminology - to me, a "Bitmap font" is a windows .fon file or some
    of the Mac fonts.  It it's essentially just images, I call them alphabets.  Not
    great, but it works for me - I try to avoid the word 'font' if it's NOT an installable  font.   -

  body: "I was mostly trying to figure out if they're redistributing fonts that -if
    they're outline fonts- are clearly derived from commercial outlines. (The bitmaps
    might actually be copyrighted too, but that's too small a fish to fry.)\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    I modelled the sword in 3D app then instanced it / arranged into typefaces. The
    sword is the Knight's sword in our upcoming animation <a href=\"http://okwad.101craft.com\">Of
    Knight, Wizard and Dragon.</a>\r\n\r\nPhotofont plugin for Photoshop or Indesign
    will allow you to use fully colored fonts on the same basis as .ttfs are used.
    There's the editor (which requires a commercial license) and client plugins (everyone
    can use these in order to use fonts made by license holders). I'm considering
    purchasing the product but at the moment it seems slightly too costly. Instead
    you can arrange .pngs found in the archive a slower but more convenient way since
    you can transform bitmaps too (eg. rotate, scale them).\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.fontspace.com/mch/swordlings\">Swordlings
