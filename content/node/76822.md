  attempting a typeface based on a logo designed for our company - a design studio
  in the UK. Attatched is the typeface which is to be printed in a black foil and
  embossed, but for the moment i have added some lighting effects to give you the
  idea of the final outcome. Here i am attempting to create a typeface that is of
  a heavy weight and resembles latex when used as a logo.\r\n\r\nI have developed
  the typeface for a mailout and am now extending the face into a full working typeface.
  I believe it could be fairly interesting when completed. The face uses influences
  from rhythmic calligraphic stokes and from heavy weighted Caslon faces. I have added
  a humanist element to the face as well. \r\n\r\nI am doing okay with square based
  characters such as M and N, however v,w,s are all proving difficult and wondered
  if I could get a critique and advice from you all. Ill supply more artwork too when
  i can. Cheers! \r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/filthyoriginal_4469.jpg]"

    have both ball terminals (as with f) and teardrop terminals (r, v, y, w) - maybe
    try using just one kind. :)\r\n* The top of the t is very pointy.\r\n* The round
    glyphs need to overshoot upwards and downwards mathematically from the non-rounded
    ones to look right optically. Try moving those up or down until they look \"equal\".\r\n*
    Maybe try pulling the point at the extrema at the bottom of the e leftwards a
    bit?"

  body: "Ooh, Brighton...me too!\r\n\r\nI'd agree with the previous post \u2014 and
    I think the teardrop terminals are much more interesting. I can see why you had
    the ball terminal in the logotype but the key in type design is harmony. \r\n\r\nRe
    overshoot, you'll need to make sure the arched letters and in fact any curves
    overshoot the x-line and baseline until those shapes appear the same size. Oh
    yeah, that was already mentioned.\r\n\r\nCounterspaces of /e/ are not happy. Crossbar
    of /t/ should not come to a point \u2014 square-ended would look stronger.\r\n\r\nIt's
    a bit difficult to judge when the letters appear in different posts. Could you
    set an alphabet and post a pdf?"

  body: I understand why it's thinner in the logo, but in the typeface it's probably
    a good idea to match the crossbar of f to the weight of the serifs.

    \u2013 Re: Ball terminal-I cant find a good example of an 'f' with a half decent
    tear-drop terminal, would you suggest using a similar tear-drop terminal to the
    v, r and w? \r\n\r\nThe pointed t - would you match the top of the 't' more to
    the solid width of the l and h rather than coming to a point? \r\n\r\nThe round
    glyphs - the e, o and t - these overshoot the x height by 2% at the moment- is
    that enough? maybe it doesnt show in the visuals. I will play around with them
    though. \r\n\r\nThe extrema of the 'e' - do you mean pulling out the bottom left
    area? its already pretty weighty?\r\n\r\n<strong>to Bendy</strong> - Greetings,
    im on kensington gardens, glad brighton is being well represented here. \r\n\r\nDo
    you not thing the rounded shapes are optically correct? any area in particular?
    \r\n\r\nthe e - Is the counter space too wide/large? \r\n\r\ncross bar of the
    t - I agree, I think ill try to match it to the serif, still not sure what to
    do at the top though, it looks ugly if I match the top of the 't' to the vertical
    stem of the 'l'\r\n\r\nI will amend the f crossbar too. Ill send out a pdf of
    the typeface to date later on tonight, got a few other projects to busy myself
    with today. My personal website by the way is www.breakandassemble.com if people
    are interested. Thanks. "

  body: "<em>would you suggest using a similar tear-drop terminal to the v, r and
    w?</em>\r\n\r\nNo. While it needs to flow in similarly, I'd recommend starting
    by smoothing that ball terminal into a teardrop shape. If that needs work still,
    you can put the other teardrop terminal glyphs on another layer and compare them
    to see what's up. Minion and Garamond probably have something similar to a teardrop
    terminal by the way. :)\r\n\r\n<em>would you match the top of the 't' more to
    the solid width of the l and h rather than coming to a point?</em>\r\n\r\nYou
    could try adding another control point and sort of softening the pointy top area.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/t_bold_4546.png]
    [img:sites/default/files/old-images/t_reg_4097.png]\r\n\r\nNote the top on both
    glyphs has softened apexes.\r\n\r\n<em>The round glyphs</em>\r\n\r\nPlay around
    with them. :) The problem is most especially with, say, the r - it's arm looks
    much lower than the stem. Step back a few feet. Squint. Do the tops and bottoms
    of letters look equal?\r\n\r\n<em>The extrema of the 'e' - do you mean pulling
    out the bottom left area? its already pretty weighty?</em>\r\n\r\nIt looks \"lumpy\"
    in a way, you can pull the bottom point a bit to the left and open open the inside
    some if you think that's a problem."

  body: "Great progress! \r\nHere are my observations; I'm not a professional so be
    wary of taking my comments too meaningfully.\r\n\r\nWidths: /s/ is rather wide
    especially next to /h/ as /h/ and /u/ are quite narrow. I'd recommend previewing
    more words with those letters and bring the widths into harmony a bit. Look at
    the relative counter sizes. /r/ may be a bit wide, but it's a great design.\r\n\r\n/f/
    and /t/ I think I'd make the crossbars wider and define the foot of /t/ more.
    It looks a bit shy. Could you add more weight to the teardrop of /f/?\r\n\r\nLove
    the curved downstroke of /v/ and /w/. I think you should draw /y/ the same way.
    Also that downstroke starts below the x-line, making it look low. Try putting
    the vertical centre of that entry stroke on the x-line. Love those big blobby
    terminals. Perhaps pull in the final upstrokes, it's pulling the counter to the
    right somewhat. Put some overshoot at the baseline of all these (perhaps not /y/).\r\n\r\nYour
    hyphen seems large enough to be an emdash.\r\n\r\nPerhaps a hair more overshoot
    on the rounds?\r\n\r\nSome swash alternates would look very groovy. \r\n\r\n"

  body: "I'd second everything Bendy said.\r\nOn weight, thicks of the rounds need
    to be thicker to optically match the thickness of the straight stems (e.g., /o/
    looks much lighter to me than, say, /h/). Diagonal letters are also relatively
    light compared to the vertically dominated glyphs. (Or, of course, you could narrow
    the vertical stems instead of widening the curved and diagonal strokes.)"
