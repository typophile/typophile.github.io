    (hot metal) and digital. I thought I was good at font identification. It always
    amazes me how you guys figure out these obscure typefaces.\r\n\r\nThank you so
    much!\r\n\r\n@kthomps5: I am indeed close-ish, but there is a small matter of
    the Monadhliath Mountains (Grey Mountains) and Loch Ness between us :o) . . .
    You have a very illustrious Scottish background indeed! The MacDonalds were the
    Lords of the Isles. For many centuries a very powerful Scottish clan. Urquhart,
    or more correctly Glen Urquhart (including Castle Urquhart), has a very prominent
    position in Scots history. Your ancestors probably settled there over 600 hundred
    years ago. Hail to a fellow Scot!\r\n\r\nCheck this page:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.historic-scotland.gov.uk/index/places/propertyresults/propertyabout.htm?PropID=PL_297&PropName=Urquhart%20Castle\r\n\r\nOnce
    again thank you both for your efforts."
