body: "Looking for a script font to replace the currently used font for the content
  here:\r\nhttp://theolivebranchchurch.org/personal_devotions.asp\r\n\r\nIt would
  be nice to fit the religious theme, but since the church will be paying for it it
  would be nice to give them a well rounded font family that they can use for other
  purposes as well. And price will most likely be a factor. Any ideas?\r\n\r\nI also
  probably need to redesign the page for them so if u have any sugguestions off the
  bat let me know. (I need to fix the menu first off i think).\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\n-Jesse"

  body: I would not set that length of text in a script font. Go for legibility instead.
    You can always use a script for the headings instead.

  body: "Ahh it doesn't have to be script or at least not cursive, I just meant that
    they want it to look hand drawn. \r\n\r\nBut I will sugguest that they use a font
    anyway. What kind of fonts would suit such a purpose?"

  body: "Another you could compare along the same lines as Brioso is <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/alcuin-lt/\">Alcuin</a>.\r\n\r\nIn
    a different direction you could look at <a href=\"http://fontbureau.com/fonts/Minah\">Minah</a>,
    which has a soft hand-written quality, but is much more readable than scripts.
    Note that it has less curly alternatioves for the bep. I am also curious what
    others think of Minah.  "

  body: I wouldn't set this much text in flash. The web is about being open and readable
    by all kinds of devices. you're cutting out mobile and accessible readers for
    the blind.

  body: To follow up on Ken's point, there is no need for the text to be in Flash.
    If you want the part at the top with the navigation, keep it as Flash, but have
    it load HTML text in the lower area.

    a more graphical site than a text based one. The whole site is a bit different
    like that."

  body: Brioso and Corvallis seem a bit hard to read at small sizes no? Alcuin and
    mariposa look pretty well rounded and I like minah. Truesdell is nice and Goudy
    is a bit expensive for them probably.
