  on underground experimental electronic music. Trying some different variations here.
  I colored #4 because that's the one I'm leaning towards at the moment. Strikes a
  nice balance compared to 2/3 & 5/6 I think.\r\n\r\nLooking for some feedback. Thanks."

    are using a more narrow U that matches the L and G, while 4-6 are using a wider
    U which matches the P. I think I like the wider U. Seems more balanced to me.
    Also, 1 is using a different face for \u2018research\u2019 than 5."

  body: Very nice. The wider U definitely. I think the whole mark could be heavier.

  body: i like the logo as well. I might be repeating logosam, but I think a  heavier
    stroke for "PLUG" to give it some more weight and provide a little more contrast
    to "research"

  body: "I don't like number 1. And 2,3,4,5, and 6 as well. They all look like something
    done by the guy who owns the corner hardware store. I don't get <em>'record label
    focused on underground experimental electronic music'</em> from that effort. They
    seem flat and trite. \r\n\r\nTry saying Plug without showing a plug... nothing
    more boring than a literal interpretation."

  body: "I agree with Hiroshige...looking at them, I felt they were all fine for an
    electrician or the like, but then realized it was for a record label.\r\n\r\nKeep
    this on the options list, but I'd suggest some more brainstorming as well."

  body: Eeblet's right. For an underground record label it's got to be something out
    there. Her images would be a good starting place.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/plug_3799.jpg]

  body: "Ha. Love it eeblet.\r\n\r\nI don't really see how depicting an outlet would
    be any more \u201Cedgy\u201D than a plug per say. Just as \u201Cflat and trite\u201D
    as jsgh would say. I listen to quite a lot of music and most of it is on indie
    labels. These labels, the ones with well designed identities, are usually not
    very edgy, but more subtle/sophisticated/modern for the most part.\r\n\r\nI get
    the idea though. Back to the drawing board. May just drop the visual element all
    together and stick with typography.\r\n\r\nThanks again for the insight/suggestions."

  body: "I never said the outlet would be edgy - only \"more fun\".  I think you can
    play with the imagery in this one, although of course a nice typographic treatment
    would be fine, too.   For starters, just let your drawings run free - don't be
    too anal.\r\n\r\n(OMG I AM SORRY)"
