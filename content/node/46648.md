body: 'When it comes to fonts that remind me of family, nothing fancy or exciting
  comes to mind. I tend to picture and see in my mind a typewriter font, as though
  every certificate and letter from or about my family has been created on a typewriter.
  I do not see this as a bad thing but I feel it does not inspire or give inspiration.
  Maybe it is this constant bombardment of plain jane typewriter font that I tend
  to be okay with plain jane fonts as well or maybe that is the reason why I choose
  big elaborate fonts to represent me, to be better remembered. '
