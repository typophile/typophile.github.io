body: Hi, <BR> <BR>If you&#39;re a type designer specializing in bi-level bitmap fonts
  I&#39;d like to hear from you. I&#39;m looking to acquire some new designs for our
  SPOT product line &#40;<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/resources/spot/default2.mspx"
  target="_blank">http://www.microsoft.com/resources/spot/default2.mspx</a>&#41; which
  currently uses a bitmap font derived from Matthew Carter&#39;s Nina design.  <BR>
  <BR>If you&#39;re interested in working on this project please drop me a line, or
  if you have any recommendations as to those who are doing the best work in this
  field please pass on their details. <BR> <BR>Cheers, Si <BR><a href="mailto:simonda@microsoft.com">simonda@microsoft.com</a>  <BR>

  body: Hi Mike, <BR> <BR>A number of designers contacted me directly, and we&#39;re
    moving forward with a few ideas.   <BR> <BR>I&#39;m still interested in hearing
    from other designers, especially those who do most of their font work in the bitmap
    field. <BR> <BR>We&#39;re looking to acquire a bunch of designs, not just one
    or two.  <BR> <BR>Cheers, Si  <BR>
