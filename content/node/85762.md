body: "I'd like to request a change on Typophile that doesn't seem like it would require
  much work\u2014maybe just a change to a setting somewhere?\r\n\r\nAs it is, if I
  don't visit the site for about a day (which can easily happen on devices or computers
  I don't use constantly), I have to log in again. I would like to stay logged in
  indefinitely until I log out. \r\n\r\nI can't think of what good this \"feature\"
  does. It doesn't seem like it's for security. If I forget to log out at a \"cyber
  cafe\" my account will be vulnerable to all but the slowest and laziest hackers
  (better hurry\u2014only 18 hours left before automatic log out!). Or maybe it's
  just to help me remember my password?\r\n\r\nSorry. I'm being sarcastic. Seriously:
  would it be hard to change this?"
