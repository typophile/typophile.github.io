body: "I'm the designer of an academic magazine that uses Fairfield for the main text,
  and have been looking for an alternative. \r\n\r\nThere's a desire to simply freshen
  up the look with a new typeface, but there are also practical considerations, mainly
  relating to stroke weight and contrast. The high contrast between the thick and
  thin strokes have impelled some readers to complain about readability, and the thin
  strokes make it particularly sensitive to very minor variations in ink density when
  on press.\r\n\r\nWhile I'm evaluating Sabon, Adobe Garamond, and Minion at the moment,
  I've also been looking for a font that has the precision and cleanliness of a Modern
  such as Bodoni without the drawbacks of stroke contrast. Walbaum and Centennial
  have the same drawbacks that Fairfield does. \r\n\r\nI know that all of you are
  far more aware than I of what's new \u2014 or old! \u2014 out there, and I'd appreciate
  any and all opinions and recommendations.\r\n\r\nThanks.\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    these."

    bold? both? small caps?

  body: "Thanks for all of your suggestions so far.\r\n\r\nre: Typequake's questions,
    the magazine is published by the school of public health at the University of
    Michigan, so the content is focused on public health in relation to the school's
    program, staff, and students.\r\n\r\nI need to have something with a range of
    weights, italics, small caps, and lining and oldstyle figures. That's one reason
    I'm considering Adobe Garamond and Minion. To me, though, both lack a certain
    kind of refined elegance that a Bodoni or even Fairfield has.\r\n\r\nI realize
    that what I'm looking for may not exist, but I've come across a whole load of
    interesting stuff during my search, so it's been a valuable effort regardless.\r\n\r\ncircleh\r\n\r\n"
