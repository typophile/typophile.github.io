  I feel that its all screaming at the same volume but I'm not sure how I should change
  it. Any advice is more then appreciated, the meaner the better. \r\n\r\nThanks !!

  body: "It doesn't look like any grid is in use, and a grid is paramount with this
    kind of aesthetic. Weights of fonts are all so close, that nothing stands out..
    there is no sense of hierarchy.\r\n\r\nHere is what I would do if I were you:\r\n\r\n1.
    Create a grid (something that is flexible enough to allow for plenty of modularity).\r\n\r\n2.
    Pay attention to spacing. Keep all the spacing even (or at least visually balanced)\r\n\r\n3.
    Use variety in weight, and add color LAST. Color is often a false sense of hierarchy.
    If it doesn't work in B&W, it won't in color.\r\n\r\n4. TEST your hierarchy by
    taking a screen shot, putting it in photoshop and adding a Gaussian blur. You
    should be able to pick out your 1st 2nd and 3rd levels, even though you may not
    be able to read them.\r\n\r\nMaybe also try adding some solid or dotted rules
    to cut up the space. And don't be afraid of white space.\r\n\r\nHope that was
    mean enough ;)\r\n\r\nevan m\r\n\r\n[[http://www.evanmade.com]]"

  body: Big gap after the first line annoys me. The ampersand can hang, but why do
    the two THEs at the top not follow the left margin of the other bit. 2009 would
    probably look better if it matched the baseline and cap height line of the rest
    of the date. I wouldn't use oldstyle figures in a poster that is all uppercase.
    OSF are really upper and lower case numerals. NEW YORK is the largest type on
    the page. Is it a key fact? (IS there really only one P in Shepard?
