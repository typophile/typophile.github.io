  a photographer -- it's very clean, white, gray type, lots of imagery) I'm thinking
  of bagging the helvetica route and going with a nice pixel font. \r\n\r\nJust to
  throw it out there, how do people feel about pixel fonts on screen? Do people have
  any favorites?\r\n\r\nI'm not talking anything fancy or gnarly - just simple - something
  rather than helvetica or myriad. This is the first website I've designed myself
  and I'm literally melting down about the type usage.\r\n\r\nThanks.\r\n\r\n"
