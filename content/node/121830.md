body: "Hi! I work a bit with type but not in type buying, so I have a bit of a dilemma.
  I do some freelance teaching work in my spare time. I have a tax credit because
  of that and am thinking about buying a nice body text font for my own teaching work-lesson
  plans and the like-that\u2019s got more range than Garamond. \r\n\r\nI have a couple
  of criteria I\u2019m looking for, in descending order of importance. No choice about
  foundry-in fact I\u2019d be keen to support a small one doing something really good.
  \r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n  <li>Budget: not more than $200 for the family unless it\u2019s
  something amazing. One-computer license, no web use envisaged.</li>\r\n  <li>Old-style
  font would be my preference; something less hard than a Times. Should be very friendly
  and readable.</li>\r\n  <li>I\u2019d <strong>really</strong> like something that
  plays nice with Word and apps that don\u2019t understand OpenType. Separate small
  caps fonts would be extremely helpful.</li>\r\n  <li>Ideally reasonably tight linespacing.</li>\r\n
  \ <li>Optical caption/titling variants would be nice too.</li>\r\n  <li>Bold style
  that\u2019s clearly bold but not too thick. Needs to not stand out against quite
  small headings.</li>\r\n  <li>Swash option would be nice, again ideally as a separate
  font.</li>\r\n  <li>Needs lining figures for maths.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\nAny thoughts?"
