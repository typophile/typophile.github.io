    shot of it. Why do I feel like this is a dumb system font or something?"

  body: "This is a super heavy Clarendon style (Slab serif), but offhand I cannot
    find a specific font to match it. I'm afraid there are so many versions of slab
    serifs around that isolating this may be a chore. I'd suggest searching for ultra
    or heavy slab serif fonts and getting one that is close enough for your purposes.
    you may have to add the 'erosion' yourself. I checked Dafont in Serif and Eroded
    categories, but did not see this as a font there.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: Yeah, I'm pretty sure the erosion is not part of the font. Thanks for the
    help!
