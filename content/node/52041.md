  body: Since nobody else is posting, here's what I have so far. It may be cheating,
    as the original type came from a book cover, and may be an actual font... don't
    know.  It still needs allot of work, especially the four and the six.  I'm new
    to this so feedback would be appreciated. (and I apologize for the poor scans,
    I have yet to do a clean copy)[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Numbers_5713.jpg]
    Okay, can't get the second image to post, here's a link to an copy. http://www.fantasticfiction.co.uk/images/n49/n248669.jpg

    those numerals get my vote, they came out really great. I like the crazy 6. well
