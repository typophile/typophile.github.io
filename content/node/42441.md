    <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/urw/stiletto/\">Stiletto</a> by URW++ (Designer:
    Ralph M. Unger) \u2013 that looks very similar. And then there\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/bergsland/adieu/\">Adieu</a>
    by David Bergsland; also quite close. He claims that \u201CAdieu is an old-fashioned
    display font traced and modified from a group of Victorian fonts.\u201D\r\n\r\nF"

  body: "Per URW: \"Stiletto was designed for the URW++ FontForum.\" & \"Design date:
    2006\"\r\n\r\nRight ... This appears in two predigital catalogs as Chevalier,
    with the 1980 VGC Typositor catalog marking it as a VGC original (but that was
    sometimes misleading)."
