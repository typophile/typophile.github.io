    magic wand on the area to change. go to edit and use fill\r\nbackground and then
    click on the color swatch for the desired color."

  body: Outline color and fill is always black in TypeTool, but you can change handles
    to be colorful. It is in Preferences > Glyph window > Black/White nodes.
