body: Can anyone suggest something similar to Neuzeit S, only with small caps and
  old style figures?

  body: There aren't many of these grotesques with small caps and OSF. <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/mark_simonson/proxima_nova_complete/">Proxima
    Nova</a> is about as close as I can get.

    It could work...

  body: I can strongly recommend Proxima Nova, though. Been using it for more than
    a year for magazine work and the range of weights and OTF options has been great.

  body: I really dislike Proxima Nova's <strong>a</strong>. I know there is an alternate,
    but the one story thing doesn't do it for me in this typeface. Galaxie Polaris
    is interesting!

  body: If that's the only issue, write to [[Mark Simonson]]. He'd probably whip up
    a Neuzeit 'a' for you at a reasonable rate.

    has small caps and osf, too. But it comes only with the single-storey \u2018a\u2019,
