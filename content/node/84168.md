  body: "I'm not clear on what you're asking here, but I suspect it actually concerns
    substituting Tcedilla with Tcommaaccent rather than vice versa.\r\n\r\nAs far
    as I know, Tcedilla does not actually occur in any language. However, it is included
    as a distinct unicode code point for legacy reasons.\r\n\r\nIn Rumanian, we find
    both Scommaaccent and Tcommaaccent. However, these were originally encoded as
    Scedilla and Tcedilla as the comma accent was viewed simply as an alternate form
    of the cedilla despite the fact that some languages (e.g. Romanian, Latvian) prefer
    the former form and others (e.g. Turkish) prefer the latter form.\r\n\r\nThis
    means that originally Turkish scedilla and Rumanian scommaaccent were assigned
    the same code point despite the fact that they have a different appearance. These
    were later disunified and both scommacccent and tcommaaccent were given their
    own code points distinct from scedilla and (non-occuring) tcedilla.\r\n\r\nOne
    will commonly include a substitution rule as follows:\r\n\r\n<code>feature locl
    {</code>\r\n\r\n<code>\_\_\_\_script latn;</code>\r\n\r\n<code>\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_language
    ROM;</code>\r\n\r\n<code>\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_lookup Romanian {</code>\r\n<code>\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_sub
    Scedilla by Scommaaccent;</code>\r\n<code>\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_sub
    scedilla by scommaaccent;</code>\r\n<code>\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_sub
    Tcedilla by Tcommaaccent;</code>\r\n<code>\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_sub
    tcedilla by tcommaaccent;</code>\r\n<code>\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_} Romanian;</code>\r\n\r\n<code>\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_language
    MOL</code>\r\n<code>\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_lookup Romanian;</code>\r\n\r\n<code>}
    locl; </code>\r\n\r\nThis will ensure that the form with the comma is used for
    Rumanian regardless of whether the actual text uses S/T cedilla or S/T comma accent.\r\n\r\nThe
    Tcedilla should still be included despite the fact that no language uses it as
    its preferred form because a t with a commaaccent will look strange in rumanian
    if it occurs alongside an s with a cedilla.\r\n\r\nNot sure if this is very clear
    or if it addresses your question.\r\n\r\nAndr\xE9"

    the comma accent form, rather than literally substituting the default glyph for
    one codepoint by the default glyph for another codepoint. The latter kind of substitution

  body: 'Thomas, in this case though, since the purpose of the substitution for ROM
    and MOL is to visually correct an encoding issue, one could make the argument
    that having the parseable glyph name point to the desired character rather than
    the originally encoded one makes some sense. This depends very much, however,
    on the desired behaviour of parsed PDF text and how it is likely to be used by
    native users: even if the newer disunified Unicode characters are technically
    preferred, they won''t help anyone used to working with the older unified encoding.'

  body: "I would buy that argument more if all PDF creation would give the same results
    and if indeed the font could affect the underlying text in general. But that isn't
    the case here. When creating a PDF from a document using this font, you'll get
    a transform of the text encoding in some cases, but not others, depending on the
    workflow used to create the PDF. That seems undesirable.\r\n\r\nIt seems to me
    that you don't want changes in what characters work in (for instance) a search
    when going from source document to PDF, and especially not if the occurrence of
    those changes is unreliable and inconsistent. (From a typical end user POV, at
    least; I know that you and I know how to trigger them.) So I'm suggesting is that
    \"always give the desired visual appearance, but never change the text encoding\"
    is a good rule of thumb. Let a sophisticated user do such transformations by search
    and replace if they need them, but don't sneak transformations in corner cases
    of PDF creation.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\n\r\nT"

  body: "One could conceivably have a Romanian text that includes a Turkish name that
    uses the S cedilla, like \u015Eahin. In this case, the S cedilla would be the
    correct character and it would be wrong to replace it with the S comma. Indeed,
    it would be wrong even to change only its appearance to look like the S comma.
    Unfortunately, there's no way of dealing with this kind of thing automatically
    at the font level. Someone will just have to deal with the encoding of the text
    manually.\r\n\r\nIt is indeed highly unfortunate that so much Romanian text is
    incorrectly encoded.\r\n\r\n<cite>As far as I know, Tcedilla does not actually
    occur in any language.</cite>\r\n\r\nThat may be true, but it does occur in specialist
    contexts. The phonetician Luciano Canepari uses the small t cedilla in his own
    extension of the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA) to represent the sound
    that would be written t\u02B2 in the usual IPA. He similarly uses b, d, h, m,
    n, p, z, and some other phonetic symbols with cedilla."

    This became the initial source of my confusion. But now is clear.\r\n\r\nHowever
    I still need a little opinion for the conclusion.\r\nIn your opinion which one
    is better: glyph Tcedilla (uni0162/uni0163) remained drawn and further substitution
    is still being done on the feature LOCL. Substitution tag looks something like
    tags:\r\n<ol>\r\n<code>\r\nfeature locl {\r\n#Latin</code>\r\n\r\n<code>language
    MOL exclude_dflt; \r\n    sub [Tcedilla tcedilla Scedilla scedilla] by [Tcommaaccent

    scommaaccent];</code>\r\n\r\n<code>} locl;\r\n</code></ol>\r\n\r\nOr only drawn
    as glyph Tcommaaccent at uni0162/uni0163 without substitution? So the tags were
    following are:\r\n<ol>\r\n<code>feature locl {\r\n#Latin</code>\r\n\r\n<code>language
