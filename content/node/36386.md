body: "Hi all,\r\n\r\nI'm looking for sans serif faces that have a \"curled foot\"
  (for lack of a more precise description) on the right leg. Examples include Priori
  and Tarzana Wide from Emigre.\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/r_6457.jpg]\r\n\r\n\r\nNot
  interested in legs that have an convex, or outward curve, like many other sans (e.g.,
  Myriad) and slabs.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance for your suggestions!"

    leg as device to activate/engage/fill/gently invade the white space in the shade
    of the Y's outstretched arms.

  body: That's certainly an option, James. But I want to see how other designers have
    handled that sort of curve.
