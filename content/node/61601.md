  \ Typography is far from my specialty, but I know enough about it to know how important
  it is in the branding of a product.\r\n\r\n\r\nMy name is Kristen and I am currently
  putting together a user experience web page.  I work for a company who has traditionally
  been a market research company and is now starting up a user experience department.
  \ There is going to be a logo, headings and body text, and I'm not sure if they
  should be the same or different.\r\n\r\nHere is as much info about my page: \r\n\r\nAudience:
  Primarily, any company that has a product or service (e.g. cell phones, web portals,
  any company with a web page, etc.) and second, other user experience experts and
  interaction designers.\r\n\r\nI'm looking for a type face that is very open, easy
  to read, lots of white space, etc.  Something that is clean but also gives the feeling
  of modernity and design excellence.\r\n\r\nAny ideas?  Is there a standard I should
  be using and can I change fonts within a page or should they all remain consistent?\r\n\r\nAny
  advice would be GREATLY appreciated.\r\n\r\nThank you!!!\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Kristen, the \"get a designer\" opinion above is doubly relevant because
    you say your target audience includes designers! They will pick apart any design
    that's not highly accomplished, and never trust you with anything. That said,
    from our end we can certainly recommend typefaces that will help you achieve your
    goals, while hoping that the suggestions will be used wisely - because for one
    thing it's not just what fonts you use, it's how you use them.\r\n\r\nOne thing
    we need to get out of the way first: will you be rendering the type as images?
    Because if not, you either have to use special font \"embedding\" technology or
    stick to fonts that are available on most systems (since the text will be rendered
    on the user's computer) which is highly restrictive.\r\n\r\nBTW, the size declaration
    of the logo image at the top-right of your web page (http://www.pmgintelligence.com/)
    is wide by one pixel, causing the \"M\" to be broken like that.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
