  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>Some weeks ago URW++ published a typeface called Revis by Coen Hofmann. On the website it states: &ldquo;Revis is a formal script based on Daphne, a typeface that was originally designed by German type designer Georg Salden. Coen Hofmann re-designed, completed and digitally re-mastered the font.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Daphne was designed in 1970. For 12 years Bethold had the rights to use it on Staromat, a phototypesetting machine. Salden never published a digital version of his typeface Daphne (although he digitized it and still plans to publish it). Now, Georg Salden is still very alive and he still works active on existing and new typefaces. Hofmann never asked for permission to &ldquo;redesign&rdquo; the Daphne typeface, nor he has any rights on the design.</p>
<p>So what do you think about this? I find it quite rude to copy a typeface of a still active type designer, do some changes and label it &ldquo;revival&rdquo;.</p>

<p>To my mind, the degree of departure from the model may be about the same, but this case bothers me more because of the particularity of the letterforms. I can imagine somebody coming up with Metro when charged to make a monoline geometric sans even without taking a look at Futura, but nobody would ever come up with Revis without looking directly at Daphne.</p>

<p>The last three years me and Georg Salden digitized, reworked and completed 15 of his typefaces: <a href="http://www.typemanufactur.com">http://www.typemanufactur.com</a>
There are still plenty to go, including Daphne. Anyway, I don&rsquo;t think only because a typeface is not available digitally, that allows anyone to do their own digital version.</p>
<p><cite>it is clearly based on &ldquo;a/the concept&rdquo; but several letterforms have been improved</cite></p>
<p>I showed Revis to Georg Salden. Here is his reaction:</p>
<p>&ldquo;At first glance, it&rsquo;s Daphne, the second one sees a lot of change for the worse. New to me is the phrase &lsquo;revival&rsquo;. Literally it means &lsquo;revive&rsquo;. Now, Daphne was never dead, neither the author. I am just very amazed at the words &lsquo;based&rsquo; and &lsquo;reinterpreted&rsquo;. One interprets something that otherwise would not be understood.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ah, good. And it sounds like he has a large œuvre and
it&rsquo;s hard to keep up with those who want to swipe this
or that design. It would have been good to have started
in the late 80s :-) but better late then never.</p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>I myself am a pragmatist; I think taking human nature into
account is better than being a crazed Japanese soldier in a tree.
For example if Salden had little intention of re-releasing his
designs in a currently usable format and simply enjoyed
squatting on them, I wouldn&rsquo;t at all mind seeing somebody
else reintegrate them into culture. I believe everything anybody
makes belongs to Mankind at least a little bit (and sometimes
quite a bit) and there&rsquo;s more to it than simply making money.</p>

<p>My take: 
If an author has NO intention of having his/her creation around forever, that is a choice one has to respect. Who are we to decide what has merit or not? 
Culture is also about the stuff that is not around anymore, and the things we will never find out. Mankind has to learn to live with that.</p>

<p>No, I respect something else: reasonableness.

<p>Right.
Having had a similar thing happen to me, I have to say that what grates even more than the appropriation is the “improvements”.</p>
<p>One has the right to cock up one’s own earlier designs with V.2s, but others should have the good grace to wait until one has passed on!</p>

		<div class="commentbody">Just to let you know: URW finally no longer offers Revis. And more good news: Daphne is now available digitally. Georg Salden and me worked hard to get all the great features of the original typeface into OTF. Because what Coen Hofmann ignored, is that the original Daphne had a large number of swashes, which optionally can be added to many letters via OpenType feature. I prepared a little GIF animation to show Daphne: <a href="http://www.typemanufactur.com/eng/index.html">http://www.typemanufactur.com/eng/index.html</a></div>
