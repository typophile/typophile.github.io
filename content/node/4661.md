body: 'I have Windows XP Home with Arabic Languge turned on, and thus can copy/paste
  Arabic words from an online English &#62; Arabic word translation sites and see
  Arabic on websites via IE 6 browser, HTML files, and even Outlook Express.   <BR>  <BR>For
  example, copy/pasted into Outlook Express, Arabic words show as being &#34;Arial&#34;
  font.   <BR>  <BR>But if I change font, it all turns to &#34;?????? , ????????&#34;.  <BR>  <BR>The
  same thing happens when I copy words from where I can see the Arabic &#40;such as
  &#34;Arial&#34; within Outlook Express&#41;, then paste them into Adobe Illustrator
  &#40;8.x&#41; or Corel PhotoPaint &#40;7.x&#41;. <BR> <BR>[I know, I know... old
  versions of programs, but I live on a tight disability income and cannot afford
  to upgrade.] <BR>  <BR>I DO have WP Arabic and one or more True Type Arabic fonts,
  but I still get the &#34;?????....&#34; etc. <BR>  <BR>I only need to include a
  handful of Arabic words for a logo, not create documents or webpages in Arabic.  I
  need to do this in Illustrator for I they have sit/be on the outline or spine of
  an invisible circle created with Bezier. <BR> <BR>_______________ <BR>  <BR>&#62;&#62;&#62;
  Q: Is there any way to work around this obvious code problem, font language, or
  whatever without having to resort to buying software, expensive fonts, and so on?   And
  which type of font types WOULD work in Illustrator &#40;TT, PS, Open, or...?&#41;.
  <BR> <BR>I&#39;d like to be able to also do such in PhotoPaint, but at worst, I
  can always rasterize the .bmp logo &#43; type in Illustrator.   <BR> <BR>_______________
  <BR>  <BR>Any advice, suggestions, rand/or eferrals at earliest onvenience very
  much appreciated. <BR>'

  body: Windows XP is handling Arabic as Unicode text, but it is possible that some
    of your applications are not. Question marks generally indicate that an application
    is unable to recognise the pasted character code. <BR> <BR>You may also have another
    problem in that some of your Arabic fonts may not themselves use Unicode encoding.
    This would explain why changing fonts from Arial, which is a Unicode font, to
    another font might not work. <BR> <BR>In order to handle Arabic in Illustrator,
    you would need the Middle East version of that application. The regular version
    does not support right-to-left text or Arabic script shaping. <BR> <BR>Since you
    don&#39;t need to handle text per se, one easy option might be to make a custom
    font using a hacked 8-bit encoding, e.g. putting Arabic glyphs in ANSI Latin decimal
    positions, and then enter the characters manually in Illustrator. You could do
    this with the relatively cheap TypeTool.

  body: Thanks, John.  A tad over my head ragarding ANSI and decimal points, etc.
    but perhaps I&#39;ll figure it out.  In the mean time I&#39;ll try to find sme
    cheap font tool. <BR> <BR>Any suggestions?  Freeware would be nice <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"
    ALT=":-&#41;" BORDER=0> <BR> <BR>And/or perhaps I&#39;ll go and Google around
    for some Unicode Arabic fonts. <BR>

  body: '&#60;font class=&#34;dontLookLikeCrap&#34;&#62;Thanks.  I checked out the
    developer&#39;s page for the app you use, and frankly, all of this is getting
    way to complex for me.  Having to learn a whole new technology.  Kind of like
    a total newbie starting to learn PhotoShop - LOL.  I may have to change my strategy
    here and find some other solutiuon.  But thanks to all for help.  Ciao.&#60;/font&#62;'

  body: 'Maybe you could just copy paste the outlines from the glyph windows into
    illustrator, and then just assemble the words there. You could typeset the text
    in Word just to see what it looks like &#40;that is if you&#39;re not familiar
    with the language&#41;. You&#39;ll also need to watch out for the alignments of
    certain characters since some of them don&#39;t sit on the baseline. <BR> <BR>I
    think this would be simpler than building a new font but I wouldn&#39;t know if
    you would be violating any copyright laws with this or not. You will probably
    need to make certain adjustments to the outlines &#40;especially the baseline
    strip&#41; if you want the text to sit on a circle. '

    $100 on TypeTool :-&#41; you might have to resort to bartering. <BR> <BR>Nadine,
    what you propose sounds totally legal - and ethical. <BR>&#40;BTW, please say

  body: Yes definitely. I went to the first one and I&#39;ll attend this one as well.
    I&#39;m looking forward to it. The program is very interesting and there&#39;s
    so many people from Reading. It brings back good memories :-&#41;
