  start a magazine and I'd like to use Bodoni for the text (it's an example) would
  it be legal? The font was included in the laptop when I bought it, but to be honest
  I'm not sure if I need a license to use it in my magazine.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance!"

  body: No, you need a license agreement to do that. Even if it's a free font, you'd
    still need to find the license agreement.

  body: "Gotta buy it. There is a possibility that the font was included with software
    that you bought, i which case you can dig around the documentation for a license
    agreement. For example, with Photoshop & InDesign a bunch of fonts are included.
    I don't usually install the fonts that come with software so I'm not sure.\r\n\r\nShop
    around at a font site like MyFonts, FontSpring etc. You might find something you
    like even more that costs less."

  body: If the font came pre-installed on your computer, and you bought the computer
    new, and you are the only person who will use the font to design your magazine,
    then you most probably don't need an extra license to use it.

  body: Ok, what if for the magazine's logo I used bauer bodoni (which I don't have)
    that is illegal right? And I'd need a licence, or is there no trouble for logotypes?

  body: The latter is "bauer bodoni". The first Bodoni is a Bodoni that comes with
    an OS, say, Bodoni MT if Windows.

    agreement.

    I don\u2019t know half what you know about these matters. I\u2019m just trying
    to tell the guy he should purchase a license for the fonts he\u2019ll be using,
    unless he already owns one (via Windows for example). \r\n\r\nPersonally, I\u2019d
    be looking at one of the more expanded moderns with opticals sizes (like [[http://www.typejockeys.com/fonts/Ingeborg|Ingeborg]],

    Didot]] or [[http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/fontfont/ff_holmen_ot/|FF
    Holmen]]) or something a bit more quirky (like [[http://new.myfonts.com/search/ambroise/fonts/|Ambroise]]
    or [[http://www.optimo.ch/pages/departement/index.php?id_categorie=1&id_font=9|Didot
