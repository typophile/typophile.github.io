  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">At a used bookstore just outside Philly, called Walk A Crooked Mile Books, I found some typophilic books that my be of interest to some of you. <BR> <BR>1.  <i>This Fortunate Man: Edward DeWitt Taylor</i> <BR>It's a 1948 AIGA &quot;keepsake&quot;, 1200 printed. It's a small, 32pg book, letterpress printed (I presume) by Stanford Univ. Press in Linotype Caslon Old Face and English Caslon (for the titling). It's only $10 and is in very good condition. Something for the AIGA completist. <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif" ALT=":-&#41;" BORDER=0> <BR> <BR>2. <i>American Typestting Corporation Specimen Book</i> <BR>It's a tall, narrow book. Bound with a plastic comb binding, the cover's a bit worn, but the interior is in good condition. It has sections titled: Linotype, Monotype, Ludlow, Foundry, Copy Casting, along with an index. It's about 130 pgs, with 2 brochures from Bertsch + Cooper inside. <BR> <BR>Those 2 are interesting finds, but not anything amazing. The next book is very impressive. <BR> <BR>3. <i>Specimen Book of Type Styles: Mergenthaler Linotype Company</i> <BR>This is massive tome, around a foot wide and about 8 inches tall, was published in 1915. It has 1,078 pages of what appears to be <i>every</i> bit of type Linotype had to offer. It's got a stamp in the front matter designating it 'Copy No. 138'. It's got a great hard cover that's well worn, but the interior is in very good condition. This is clearly a luxurious resource, because it features multi-color printing at various points, to showcase the multitude of layouts and design possibilities that the Linotype library can make possible. It also includes a comprehesive 'foreign types' section with Hebrew, Arabic, Armenian, Russian, 'German' (meaning blackletter) types, and others. The price on the interior cover is $200. I couldn't find an example of this publication on <a href="http://www.linotype.org/bibliography.html">Linotype.org</a>, so I don't have any info on it. I didn't have my digital camera with me, but I can go back and snap some shots if anyone would like. If I had the $$$, I'd buy it for myself. It's pretty astounding. <BR> <BR>Here's the info for the seller: <BR><b>Walk a Crooked Mile Books</b> <BR>Devon at Gowen Street <BR>Philadelphia, PA 19119 <BR>215-242-0854 <BR> <BR>(By the way, I'm not a representative of the store, I'm just posting this for the benefit of Typophile readers.)</div>
