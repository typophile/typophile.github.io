body: "Is it possible to add more hyphenation dictionaries to InD? I like to test
  type in foreign languages but Adobe does not supply all of the. They have Library
  files such as \"rus.hyp\" which I assume do the trick.  Are there others available
  and if so where?  Is it possible to just drop a new \".hyp\" file in the library
  and have that language supported and show up in the InD \"Language\" pop-up?\r\n\r\nChrisL"
