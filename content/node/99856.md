  body: "It doesn't look like a font, in the sense of letterforms that you could specify
    for printing. It looks like an alphabet that was purpose-built for those white
    plastic letters with tabs on the back to insert into black grooved signboards.
    It might not even have a name, if it's the only style of letters that manufacturer
    makes. \r\n\r\nIf you want a font (i.e., letterforms that you can specify for
    printing, the web, etc.) that looks like this, [[http://www.identifont.com/similar?60N|Cooper
    Old Style]] is pretty close."

  body: "Victor,\r\n\r\nI think you're half-right: the typeface is probably proprietary,
    but for engraving machines rather than prefab signage. In this instance, the letters
    themselves most likely appeared in the form of templates, similar to Leroy lettering\u2026"

  body: "I'd guess from the image that they're really peel-and-stick letters such
    as those now widely sold in stores that cater to scrapbooking. Made by Avery,
    EZ Letter Quikstick (if they still exist) and others.\r\n - Herb"

  body: "Apparently it depends on how your brain interprets the image as to whether
    you view the letters as stuck-on or engraved. I think Nick's right about this
    being engraved, it matches a common 3-line Roman style.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.silversuperstore.com/engraving/323.html\r\nhttp://www.groomsshop.com/roman-3-line.html"
