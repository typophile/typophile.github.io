  <BR>We are doing now simple work &#40;by simple I mean just few letters, titles-movies
  etc etc &#41;, an original work. <BR> <BR>Each time - when we open the Font ID dialog
  box - we have : &#34;TrueType vendor code: pyrs&#34;.  <BR> <BR> <BR>2. Do I/we
  have to, or need to &#34;Type 1 Unique number&#34;?  Or how do I know that there&#39;s
  no problem with Adobe/PS printers? <BR>Or - just leave 0?'

  body: You can invent your own vendor code, but you have to leave it lowercase unless
    it&#39;s registered. It&#39;s either Apple or Microsoft who does vendor code registrations.
    <BR> <BR>You can leave the UniqueID number blank, and should do so. Adobe, who
    invented UniqueIDs, no longer uses them in new fonts. There is a successor, the
    XUID, which we also mostly no longer use in new fonts. <BR> <BR>Regards, <BR>

  body: '&#34;pyrs&#34; stands for Pyrus, the former company name of the FontLab distributor.
    Pyrus never made any commercial fonts, so fonts with the &#34;pyrs&#34; vendor
    code are probably fonts where the real vendor did not replace the default value
    with a custom one. The vendor codes can be registered with Microsoft: <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/typography/links/VendorList.aspx"
