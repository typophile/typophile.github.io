  body: In the future, they actually will use Microgramma and Eurostile on spaceships
    so that everything looks like it did in the classic SF movies, thereby fulfilling
    the prophecy of the art directors.

    Interesting story! \r\nThe director is David Bowie's son Duncan Jones and beautiful
    music by Clint Mansell.\r\nSam Rockwell is terrific + and Kevin (with the perfect
    SF-name) SPACEY is the voice for a nicer version of HAL \r\nI was impressed"

    they've done in this movie (with its references to classic SF movies) will bleed
    over into the real world. Just kidding, I hope.\r\n\r\nReally meant to see this
    when it was in theaters, but missed it. Now I'll have to wait for the DVD."
