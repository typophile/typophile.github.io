  body: "Looks like felt marker lettering turned into a font. Not an old time design
    as far as I can determine -- not in Jasper's _Type Enclyopaedia (1970)_ . No results
    checking the usual digital sources. Interested in anyone else's thoughts.\r\nDon"

  body: "Hi Pablo. Is it possible that the bar is still operating under the same management?
    If so perhaps you could ask them what font they used for their menu. \r\nThe tone
    is like a fusion of Mistral or Choc with Blackletter -- a welcome relief from
    the flood  of thick creamy food fonts. After at least seven years of obscurity,
    this font font deserves wider circulation.\r\nI am surprised that none of our
    Typophiles -- most of whom who have played the font ID game for longer than me
    -- have no leads on this mystery marker.\r\nBTW, do you have any more letters?\r\nDon"

  body: "Hi Don, the problem is that the design was made by a company that was gone.
    I attach the complete menu. The brown words are Brush Handwriting Italic but the
    black words we don't know which type are.\r\nThanks again, waiting for a miracle
    to know this secret.\r\nPablo.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/CARTEL CAFETERIA_6457.jpg]"

  body: "Hi Pablo, the menu gives an idea of how the font treats much of the alphabet,
    and even includes the ampersand and half the numbers.\r\nIf you do not see any
    suggestions from any of the other typophiles within the next few weeks, you might
    do best to consider this to be a \"lost font.\" \r\nIf you really want to get
    the font you might have to invest in recreating something similar. If you don't
    make fonts yourself, an efficient approach would be to show the menu to someone
    with some ability to use a felt marker to replicate the lettering and add the
    missing letters. You could then have the alphabet scanned and edited by a \"starving
    fontmaker\" for a relatively small amount. The supply of fontmakers with sufficient
    skills far exceeds demand for their services.\r\nDon"
