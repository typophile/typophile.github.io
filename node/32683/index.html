  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Those of you who have tried the <a href="http://labs.adobe.com/technologies/photoshopcs3/">Adobe Photoshop CS3 Beta</a> have probably noticed that, unlike InDesign and Illustrator, Photoshop does not have a Glyph palette. And it will probably be of no surprise if I say that you won't find such feature in the released version as well.

As the Photoshop team is planning the future version (the one after CS3), [[Thomas Phinney]] and I are trying to convince <a href="http://blogs.adobe.com/jnack/">John Nack</a> (Senior Product Manager, Adobe Photoshop), how important a Glyph palette is to Photoshop users. And this is where you all come in: we need your examples and arguments to show John that you need such feature in Photoshop.

John says that his inbox is already bloated with feature requests, so I believe that what we should do is post our reasons in this thread. Helpful things are testimonies like:

-- If Photoshop had a Glyph palette, I wouldn't have to open Illustrator just to insert that alternate Z from Zapfino that I need for the visual I'm doing. I haven't updated my old (2 years) computer, so having one more app opened really slows down the whole system;

-- With a Glyph palette I can easily browse the glyph set of the font(s) I'm using, and insert other glyphs that are not accessible via the OpenType submenu, neither via the operating system's Character Palette (Mac)/Character Map (Windows);

-- Being able to see the complete glyph set of a feature-rich typeface like Bickham Script or Poetica right there in Photoshop, helps me to be more creative and saves me time;

-- Without a Glyph palette in Photoshop, I don't have the ability to pre-visualize how a particular glyph will change into when I apply OpenType features, so I have to resort to Illustrator, like in this video, http://av.adobe.com/russellbrown/OpenTypeSM.mov  The problem is I don't work seamlessly in Illustrator as I do in Photoshop, so I avoid it as much as possible. I feel that my work would benefit from the retouches in Illustrator, but with the projects' tight deadlines I can't really afford that time.

Arguments like, "Having a Glyph palette in Photoshop would make all the apps in the suite more consistent" are also valid, however they don't really justify the need for implementing such feature.

Remember, your input is really invaluable, so please try to give as much as you can. Thanks!</div>

		<div class="commentbody">— If Photoshop had a Glyph palette, I wouldn’t have to open Illustrator just to insert alternate (any number of characters) from (any "pro" font) that I need for the visual I’m doing. Even with a newer computer and OS, this is clunky. The inconsistency in CS app features make it less of a suite and more of a co-dependant set of quirky tools with odd workarounds.</div>

For a company that once actually made tremendous strides in interface design and usability, Adobe is now falling all over itself. Not putting a feature as useful as a glyph palette in Photoshop is best described with cruel insults and profanity that I’m not going to spew out on Typophile. I really miss the days when Adobe was leading the pack in this area, as opposed to just knocking off Apple and paying little attention to user wants and needs.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">It makes absolutely no sense for PhotoShop to be without a glyph palette. I don't know the keyboard combinations for every glyph in every language so it is imperative that there be a visual way to get the glyph I need without dancing between programs. If Adobe is tauting there software as a creative SUITE, then why would you cripple one of the components? I want to be able to SEE all the alternates and ligatures. I should not have to find them somewhere else. Please include the Glyph Palette as well as opentype features in Photoshop.

That's not a problem, that's a feature! see point 9...

And this one is just great...

So all we need do is offer Mr Nack free type ID help for life and a typophile membership (I'll chip in $5.75) and we get the palette!

		<div class="commentbody">Photoshop is a graphics tool, at this stage of web design. I use Photoshop more to make web graphics than anything else. Sometimes those are just photographic images, but a lot of it is also type-based. Photoshop offers several rasterizing methods for type; so it doesn't make sense to me to not include the other type tools there. Since I can't choose those rasterization options on imported EPS files, It's no help to be able to set any glyph in Illustrator. Sometimes I choose a different rasterizing method for different lines of type in the same image. I find it an inappropriate limitation, given the typographic support in the other programs, to not have all the glyphs in OpenType fonts available. Adobe offers some of the most robust OpenType font families, and glyph selection, as part of the other CS apps, seems like a baseline tool.  </div>

		<div class="commentbody">I tried offering John a <em>dozen</em> type IDs plus naming my next kid after him (hi, this is my daughter, her name is John), but that was no go.

Seriously though, it's not that John doesn't think a glyph palette would be useful in Photoshop. But all new features go through the same process: they rank the features and look at how much work they'd take to implement and test, and compare that to how many people they have in the given time frame.

Now, I'm not intimately familiar with every new feature in Photoshop CS3  - nor, even if I did know all the new features, do I know the user base well enough to judge their importance or demand. But I actually know the InDesign CS3 feature list pretty well. There are tons of things that have been common user requests and are otherwise clearly badly needed. Sure, there are a bunch of things I'd like to see that aren't there yet. But looking at the new features it's very clear indeed that they are paying attention to what users need and ask for. It's just that the number of exciting potential new features always exceeds the available resources by a multiple of several times.

I'm quite certain it's the same for Photoshop, and I know how hard John works. So comments like <cite>"I hope he knows what is accountability — send him home"</cite> are neither called for nor helpful.

		<div class="commentbody">While I try to avoid doing mass quantities of type in Photoshop I am right there with everyone else who wishes there was a glyph palette. When I do find myself working with type in Photoshop it is usually for display purposes. With most display settings you can usually go a little crazier and that is where the glyphs come into play. Up to now I'm amongst those people who do the type in Illustrator and copy/paste it into Photoshop. I'm used to it, but it would be lovely (and time saving) if I didn't have to.

I didn't because I really hate the lack of usability of the Adobe User to User Forums. Nonetheless I asked the question in 3 Photoshop forums (<a href="http://www.photoshopcafe.com/cafe/viewthread.php?tid=40830">The CAFE</a>, <a href="http://www.photoshoptechniques.com/forum/showthread.php?p=190898">Photoshop Techniques</a>, <a href="http://www.retouchpro.com/forums/software/16910-who-wants-needs-glyph-palette-photoshop.html">RetouchPRO</a>) and you guys here have been the most responsive.

Alright, I'll go post on the Photoshop User to User Forums... both of them :^/ (Mac and Win).

And Adobe, don't forget following versions of Flash, there is text and type too.

I am astonished to find there is no glyph palette in PS CS3. I skipped version 2, and somehow assumed that it would be in that version. Now I'm not sure if maybe I shouldn't wait for CS4.</div>

As others have said, when two applications for the same vendor both have similar functionality, there is a hope for UI consistency. I've always predicted that Adobe products would eventually merge into a single uber-application, where any graphics app would simply access the Adobe Type Palette, much like OS X's font pane. </div>

<cite>But because Illustrator now shares a type engine with Photoshop</cite>

If the type engine is "the same," why is the access and the interface different between the two? Doesn't make sense. 

Someone above mentioned access to dingbats. I wanted to create a favicon using a fleuron, but I had a heck of a time finding one in Photoshop. I was using a machine without Illustrator, and so I had to use OS X's built in character pallet, which constantly crashed.

Give me a glyph pallete! (By the way, FontExplorer X works as a great glyph pallete for everything BUT Adobe products. Just go to information, go to characters, select the glyph, and hit Copy. Works great!)</div>

Nuclear bombs and nuclear power plants also use the same 'engine' but the interfaces are different - different tools might reasonably need different interfaces? </div>

Put in another way, thanks Adobe, I will save money and not upgrade Photoshop CS3 until the glyph palette appear and the same unique palettes through all Adobe applications. :)

PS. I just discovered that Illustrator CS2 have the SC OpenType feature just last week, just because its not with all others OT features on the dedicated palette. Its via a local/submenu menu on the Character palette rather than the OT palette. pffu. We learn everyday.

		<div class="commentbody">I submitted another request. But I also requested a glyph palette for the last two versions. I’m tempted to request that all of Illustrator run as a Photoshop plugin. This would be a great way to improve Photoshop’s weak vector tools, get a glyph palette, and it would satisfy the Photoshop team’s requirement that Photoshop consume inordinate amounts of RAM.</div>

The person in charge of prioritizing features at Adobe needs to read 37signals' software manifesto, [[http://gettingreal.37signals.com/toc.php|Getting Real]].

It’s on the list of reasons I have not and will not buy the CS4 suite. Remember that awful image extraction plugin that Adobe dumped when it went to CS4? The one that just duplicated existing masking functionality, but was buggy and had performance problems and never worked right? If the Photoshop team had time to waste on crap code like that, they had time for a glyph palette. </div>
