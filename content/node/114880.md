  brand refresh we want to add a serif which compliments Ideal and has also a decent
  set of styles and weights.\r\nThank you in advance.\r\n"

  body: Fantastic typeface hrant, I personally do love it and will buy it for my own
    collection but, alas, I feel its too characterful for the institution and what
    we are after is some thing with more regularity/geometry than Avance. Thank you
    again hrant.
