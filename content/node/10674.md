    BORDER=0> <BR> <BR>Do you pronounce the &#39;p&#39; preceding the &#39;f&#39;
    or not? And is the &#39;Z&#39; an even sound or is it more like &#39;tz&#39;?

    she wanted her bold headlines set in &#34;Gheel Sahns.&#34; I asked her if that
    was the same thing as Gill Sans, and she said yes, but that I was mispronouncing
    it. I replied that I didn&#39;t know Eric Gill was French since he was from England.
    That shut her up.  <BR> <BR>In retrospect, though, I don&#39;t know how Eric pronounced
    his last name. Soft G or hard? '

    and he didn&#39;t pronounce the &#39;G&#39; at all. <BR> <BR>But in France he&#39;s
    &#39;Gilles&#39; and there&#39;s no changing it. In the end, though, who cares.
    There are much more important things in life than the correct pronunciation of
    the names of typefaces.  <BR> <BR>Matha

  body: I&#39;ll let you in on a little secret, Andrew, if you promise not to tell
    anyone.  <BR> <BR>All over the world there are a hell of a lot of Graphic Designers
    using typefaces with exotic/foreign names every day. A high proportion of them
    don&#39;t pronounce &#39;Gill&#39; exactly as Gill himself would have done. What
    does that change? Do they respect his work any less that you? And what about non-French
    designers trying to pronounce French names? I don&#39;t think they&#39;re going
    to win any pronunciation contests. <BR> <BR><i>Not if &#40;a&#41; you deal with
    these names everyday, and &#40;b&#41; respect the people who designed them.  <BR>By
    your answer, it&#39;s apparent that you do not</i> <BR> <BR>This is total hypocrisy
    coming from someone who admits to shutting up an uptight know-it-all because she
    mispronouned a typeface name. Try a little more respect for people, Andrew, and
    a little less for typeface names. <BR> <BR>And I advise you to reread your posts.
    Do you really mean to suggest that there is <b>nothing</b> more important in the
    world that correctly pronouncing a typeface name? <BR> <BR>Don&#39;t be a chauvinist.
