body: "First time I've posted anything like this before, so here goes.\r\n\r\nJust
  got this new job in to re-design a logo for a Medical Care product. The name is
  going to be (PEC) (Premier Electromedical Care)\r\nDue to the nature of the product
  the client doesn't want anything to complex, so we have agreed to apply just typographic
  treatment to the name.\r\n\r\nI wanted to get your views on any appropriate typefaces
  that in your opinion would suit this? in particular a face that has a certain unique
  stance in uppercase? I'm thinking Sans Serif will be better suited for this job
  but am open to suggestions otherwise.\r\n\r\nI've done a bit of leg work on this
  already, Initial sketches found me to be leaning towards the geometric form with
  the letters sitting well in lowercase, but this style used way to often.\r\n\r\nFor
  those interested you can get some background info on the product from this link.\r\nhttp://www.pec-equipment.com/
  \ (and yes I'm in talks to design the website too :)\r\n\r\nI will be posting the
  progress of this design through out course.\r\n\r\nHere's a quick Myriad visual
  of what lettering is involved.\r\n\r\n\r\nCheers.\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Picture8_4298.png]"

  body: Given that you have such a round open shape in the C and a nice flat in the
    P the shape of the logotype is always going to be a little odd. You might be best
    served by something strictly geometric or at least with more rigid shapes. Something
    with the C being more closed even.

  body: "As much as i try to stay away from applying this geometric form to the logo
    I find myself coming back to it, although my original sketches did find this to
    work well. I created this example just using the circle and pen tool. It does
    have a certain pleasing aesthetic look about it but I'm not totally sold. One
    can find suggestions of the pulse waves that display on the product, on the contours
    outlining the logo.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Picture10_4887.png]\r\n\r\nThis
    is the product the logo will also be displayed on.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Picture11_5160.png]\r\n\r\nPatrick;
    I haven't got serif black but it seemed to remind me of (PMN Caecilia) even tho
    thats a slab! I'll get a mock up of that and see how it looks.\r\n\r\nThanks for
    your input so far guys!"

    maybe an \"E\" with a double-round structure, like in Tarzana.\r\n\r\nI'm also
    getting a slab-serif vibe out of this.\r\n\r\nOr maybe try a pixelfont aesthetic.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
