  adding to this legacy, I am proud to announce that today marks another milestone
  as Adobe makes yet another type resource freely available by releasing the Source
  Sans Pro family as our first-ever open source type family.\r\n\r\nThe brief & development\r\nThe
  primary need for type in Adobe\u2019s open source applications has thus far been
  for usage within user interfaces. A second environment of perennial interest to
  Adobe is the realm of text typography. Thus the immediate constraints on the design
  were to create a set of fonts that would be both legible in short UI labels, as
  well as being comfortable to read in longer passages of text on screen and in print.
  In thinking of typeface models that accomplish these tasks well, I was drawn to
  the forms of the American Type Founders\u2019 gothics designed by Morris Fuller
  Benton. In particular, I have always been impressed by the forms of his News Gothic
  and Franklin Gothic, which have been staples for typographers since their introduction
  in the early twentieth century. While keeping these models in mind, I never sought
  to copy specific features from these types. Instead, I sought to achieve a similar
  visual simplicity by paring each glyph to it\u2019s most essential form.</blockquote>\r\n\r\nhttp://blogs.adobe.com/typblography/2012/08/source-sans-pro.html"

    exactly you think that. I tend to agree, but also think there's infinite opportunity
    for re-invention. So are you thinking that the 'New Retail Sans' is a 'dead end'
    now more because of 'design' reasons or more 'market reasons'? or both?  I opined
    in Istanbul that 'free-ness' was now a technical aspect of a font, as important,
    or more important, as 'legibility' or 'language support'. Adobe's ambitious release
    of the Source Sans design under a free software license, i think backs that up.
    It's going to be interesting whether other large foundries identify the same need
    for 'free-ness' as Adobe have done with SourceSans, and if so, what more free
    fonts will we be seeing? and what effect this could have?\r\n-v"

    i'm interested what relationship these 'other ideas' may have towards the 'mainstream'
    and also interested in what relationship they may have towards 'free software'
    fonts? We are very used to the argument from some that free fonts and/or open
    source fonts are bad because they cannot be of of highest quality, aka they lower
    standards. The epitome of that stance could well be Mathew Butterick's (http://typotalks.com/blog/2012/05/19/matthew-butterick/).
    But when a major foundry puts it's resources behind the design of free fonts,
    those arguments should be redundant (i would say), and we are just left with not
    wanting stuff to be free. Is there some inherent threat in 'free-ness', to type
    designers?\r\n-v"

    thinking on the nature of \u201CFree\u201D in the digital realm (<em>Wired</em>,

    new Adobe face goes, I don\u2019t see it as competition to the kind of design

    he has put that on hold while working for the Man. Actually, no man at all, compared

    be quicker if it\u2019s just one font ;) But who else, especially average users,

    you misunderstood :) \r\nI meant that 'free-ness' is now an important technical
    aspect of typeface design. Free-ness is one more aspect of a typeface that must
    now be considered by type designers, alongside those other aspects, like legibility,
    language support, etc. If i'd said that 5 years ago, it would have sounded like
    pure nonsense to most type people. Oh i remember, it did! ;) Now though, it seems
    like the evidence of it should be fairly obvious. It's irrelevant whether individuals
    think their own (or any) fonts should be free or not, the fact is 'free-ness'
    is becoming a central technical consideration of type."

    at that talk was that <em>Turks</em> (and what I meant by extension is any ethnic
    group, that wants to stand out as such) shouldn't be making generic sans fonts;
    that they should be exhibiting their own culture (although subtly, not in an in-your-face
    way) instead of trying to act like generic Europeans. Here's an image I used to
    illustrate that:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/blrand_5587.gif]\r\nYou
    can't tell who made that, where. What is that good for? Maybe making more money
    for a faceless multinational. But it's not good for culture.\r\n\r\nBesides the
    latching-on I mentioned, another good thing about Source might be that it further
    weakens the retail market for the generic sans (even though -having that America
    grot pedigree- it's actually far less generic that something like the font in
    the image above) forcing designers to wake up and contribute something people
    should be paying for. Source seems to be exactly the sort of design that should
    be free.\r\n\r\nConcerning \"libre\" versus \"free\" versus \"gratis\" versus
    whatever, could we get a nice little explanation of how to accurately understand

  body: "@hrant. Ahhh i see. I remember your talk in Istanbul, and what you say now
    is the same as what i remember :) I have to agree with you, the local and the
    vernacular can so easilly get swept aside by the 'International Corporate'. This
    is why grass roots cultural diversity is so often a good thing, it usually breeds
    better alternatives to the 'a few models fit all' approach. It's tricky though,
    for example, the face in your example, i don't see as particularly 'faceless',
    even though i guess it's maybe meant to be.\r\n\r\nRe - the terminology of 'libre',
    'gratis', 'free' etc. The key to all this is licensing, it is not about how much
    money is paid/not paid.\r\n'Libre' is a term used more and more because it helpfully
    underlines the 'freedom' of 'free software', that unfortunately 'FREE' in English
    fails to do :)  because 'free software' sounds only about not paying for it. Other
    languages usually don't have this confusion, trust the English language to equate
    'freedom' with 'not paying'.\r\n\r\nSo... one major point of Libre / Free software
    is that it's licensing ensures that it is non-proprietary, it can never be sole
    property, it can 'belong' to anyone who uses it, and anyone who uses it also has
    the freedom to alter it, add to it, share it, etc. Of course in order to be fully
    free to be altered, added to, shared etc the software must also be freely available
    in it's source form. So with fonts - a compiled truetype font, with machine level
    hinting code, quadratic curves and OpenType tables etc etc etc does not enable
    the user the full freedom to alter the original design and function of the font.
    To give full freedom to the user, the user also needs the original source files
    that the truetype font was compiled from.\r\n\r\n'Open Source' is a technical
    approach to this scenario, literally meaning that the source code of software
    should be open. However, there's a philosophical difference here, as there are
    other reasons for opening up source code. Some people open their source code because
    they believe that software should be totally free (as in Libre) and that only
    free software allows people control over software (instead of giving software
    corporations control over people), but others do it for far more 'technical' and
    less 'ideological' reasons.\r\n\r\nI'm guessing Adobe is in the latter camp, and
    that their reasons for releasing Source Sans under a free software license is
    technical rather than ideological.\r\n\r\n"

    separate product (the UFL (Ubuntu Font License) allows this, IIRC), but one can
    certainly toss it into a bundle (say, an OS or app distro) and sell that. So,
    you could combine or even integrate GIMP, Fontforge, Inkscape and Scribus, shovel
    on a bunch of OFL fonts and sell the resulting package.\r\n\r\nOne thing I have
    not tried but which Fontforge claims it can do is add a table (PfEd) with the
    info needed to recreate the original SFD source file from just the OTF file."

    1.6 Why won't the OFL let me sell the fonts alone?\r\nAnswer: The intent is to
    keep people from making money by simply redistributing the fonts. The only people
    who ought to profit directly from the fonts should be the original authors, and
    those authors have kindly given up potential direct income to distribute their
    fonts under the OFL. Please honour and respect their contribution!</blockquote>\r\n\r\nI
    think that idea is a little outdated nowadays, but it's fair enough. I tend to
    think that if someone was ambitious and smart enough to actually manage to sell
    individual 'free' fonts, they probably deserve whatever they can get ;) plus a

    It seems like a requirement that's been lowered from a distant office, and i've

    or I might consider a programming language, and hence what constitutes a computer
    program, and the legal definition of a computer program according to the registrar
    of copyright or other intellectual property protection in a given jurisdiction.
    So, for instance, the US Copyright Office defines a computer program very generously
    as 'a set of statements or instructions to be used directly or indirectly in a
    computer in order to bring about a certain result', and extends protection 'to
    all the copyrightable expression embodied in the computer program'. The inclusion
    of statements as well as instructions in the definition, and the allowance of
    indirect as well as direct use in bringing about 'a certain result', opens a pretty
    wide door.

    really. In this sense, the stroke model would only be useful for a purely geometrical
    design, with no optical compensation, modulation, or visual interest. Once you
    start trying to make a real typeface based on a stroke model you end up with something
    like Metafont, which is the opposite of easy for an end user. I think this conception
    of type design fails to appreciate the painstaking skill type designers need,
    and the thousands of decisions that go into a typeface, or how to add weight to
    make a bold. It's a thinking process that cannot be satisfactorily reduced to
    mechanics."
