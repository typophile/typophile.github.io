body: "For this work I\u2019ve used a set of rules to create a programme that would
  give a diferent typographic grid. The basic though was to create circles out of
  the rotation of a square. The smallest square is 10 cm and is rotated in angles
  of 5\xBA. The midle square is 20 cm and rotated in angles of 10\xBA and the bigger
  is 30 cm and rotated in angles of 20\xBA.  I\u2019ve then choosen angles 20\xBA
  and 80\xBA for the magenta and 30\xBA and 150\xBA for cyan, that created the grid.
  The text was divided in colors acording to each sentence. Each sentence takes the
  color of the grid line it\u2019s placed upon and each sentence only begins when
  the line it is upon is intersected by a line of the oposite color. The question
  takes the gray color and is the only sentence that is placed out of the grid. This
  messy look gives the anwser to the question, you have to turn around and to be prepared
  to take chances and changes to stand out and be heard.\r\n\r\nI'd love to ear your
  comments on this.\r\n\r\nPedro Monteiro\r\nhttp://whatype.wordpress.com/\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/squares_5399.jpg]"

    the intersection point? Or \"heard?\". I mean, if you follow the logic of the
    grid \u2026\r\n\r\nAnd can you show your result without the underlying grid."

  body: "The 'o' should start in the intersection all right. I kind of cheated on
    that one because it looked better this way.\r\n\r\nI can show it without the grid
    but it looks a little 'naked' because it was done to show the grid.\r\n\r\nAs
    for the 'heard' its in gray therefore it is the question which is outside the
    grid :-D"
