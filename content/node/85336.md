  body: The arc by Paint.net looks more jagged.  Is that the problem you are talking
    about?  Maybe you could explain the graphic a bit more, for example what the text
    is indicating.

  body: "Hmm, just taking a stab in the dark here. Because like Luma pointed out,
    your description of the problem isn't terribly clear. \r\nFor example, the circle
    labelled \"Illustrator\" looks mighty clear to me. \r\n\r\nAssuming that the two
    circles are from different ai files, the jagged file might have have View > Pixel
    Preview turned on.\r\n\r\nAnd to make it render more smoothly when it's exported,
    when setting up a New Document, \"Align New Objects to Pixel Grid\" (under Advanced
    options) should be checked.\r\n\r\nAnti-alias should always be turned on, unless
    you're using bitmap fonts or something.\r\n\r\nHope this helps. "
