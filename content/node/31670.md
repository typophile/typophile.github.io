  body: Interesting but breaking down the sample into individual characters is much
    more work than going to Whatthefont or posting an image here.

  body: This is an oldie, predating MyFonts' <a href="http://whatthefont.com">WhatTheFont</a>
    by a few years I think. But nearly every one of the foundries in their database
    is on MyFonts.com, so I don't see how they can compete with the convenience and
    accuracy of WTF.

    for <a href=\"http://www.eeicom.com/eye/index.html\"><em>The Editorial Eye</em></a>
    about using software grammar checkers and how they simply couldn't compare with
    us lowly hu-mans for accuracy.\r\n\r\nAnd let's not go anywhere near how terrible
    spell-checkers are!  :-P"

    we are generally pretty friendly, and sometimes even informative. It's also  a
    real bargain. We have even been known to express opinons. What software does that?\r\n\r\n-
