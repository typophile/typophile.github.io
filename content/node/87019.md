  body: "There are only about nine languages that read right to left.\r\n\r\nHebrew,
    Arabic (and Farsi and Urdu) - and Chinese, Japanese, Korean, and Mongolian.\r\n\r\nThe
    latter four read left to right most of the time nowadays. But when they are read
    <em>vertically</em>, the vertical lines then proceed right to left, and thus books
    laid out in the traditional way for Chinese will have the front cover located
    on what appears to be the \"back\", just as books in Hebrew would.\r\n\r\nSo,
    east of Jerusalem, we have Hindi, Thai, Malayalam and Tibetan, for example, that
    read left to right."

    is a property of script not language, e.g. Azerbaijani used to be written in Arabic
    script, switched to Cyrillic in the Soviet era and then Latin post Soviet.\r\n\r\nSimilarly,
    many African language used to be (and still to some extent) written in Arabic
    script (Ajami) and now written in Latin script.\r\n\r\nThere are more right to
    left scripts; Syriac, Thaana, N'Ko. Old Italic can be written write to left. Egyptian
    hieroglyph is written in any direction, its derived scripts are always right to
    left.\r\n\r\nAnd there boustrophedon where each line is flipped in the other direction."

    vertically and always in columns left-to-right, not right-to-left."

  body: Mongolian is even more interesting, it is a descendant of Sogdian script which
    is written from right to left but rotated 90 degrees, that is why it columns start
    from left to right unlike other vertical scripts.
