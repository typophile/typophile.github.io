body: "Hi everyone,\r\n\r\nI've been working on my first san-serif typeface [[http://typophile.com/node/89023]]
  - and have included a handful of additional ligatures in typetool: f_i / f_f_i /
  f_l / f_f_l / f_j / f_f_j / f_b / f_h / f_k / s_t / c_t / t_t\r\n\r\nI've named
  them as above in the glyph properties, and left the unicode blank. When I set some
  sample text in illustrator in one weight, these glyphs are fine, but then if I change
  the weight of the same text some of these don't render. If the glyphs are named
  the same, and neither have an assigned unicode, is there any reason why they would
  be assigned differently?\r\n\r\nAlso, if I open the glyph window in illustrator,
  I can manually put these glyphs in - so they're there, just not properly assigned.\r\n\r\nIs
  there a trick to getting these additional glyphs assigned correctly? I'm not looking
  for them to auto populate at this stage, i'm just trying to have them render correctly.\r\n\r\nI
  posted this in the critique thread for the font, but thought it might help to add
  it here.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\n\r\nDale."

  body: "I'm a bit unclear on what you've done, but when you say <cite>I'm not looking
    for them to auto populate at this stage</cite> does that mean that you don't currently
    have an opentype <code>liga</code> feature which inserts these glyphs?\r\n\r\nIf
    not, and you're using the glyph palette to insert these, some applications (not
    sure about illustrator) will use the GID (glyph ID) to reference glyphs with no
    unicode value. If this is the case, you won't be able to change weights and preserve
    the glyphs unless the different weights contain the exact same glyph complement
    in the exact same order.\r\n\r\nYou really want to enter these ligatures as sequences
    of two (or more) characters and then let the <code>liga</code> or <code>dlig</code>
    features convert them to ligatures.\r\n\r\nAndr\xE9"

    body: "Hey Andr\xE9,\r\n\r\nI was under the impression that you can't add opentype
      liga features in typetool - ultimately this would be ideal, but I think i'd
      need to upgrade to fontlab. It looks like typetool doesn't let you change/order
      the glyph ID's either..\r\n\r\nAt the moment i'm just creating the glyphs as
      you've said, using the glyphs palette. And i'm guessing the ordering must be
      wrong.\r\n\r\nShort of creating a new font, and copy/pasting in the same order
      for each weight, i'm not too sure what my options are.\r\n\r\nThanks for your
      help.\r\n\r\nDale."

    can\u2019t add features and you didn't want to spend the $$$ on upgrading to FontLab,
    you could always create your font in FontTool and then use AFDKO to add the features
    (or FontForge).\r\n\r\nAndr\xE9"
