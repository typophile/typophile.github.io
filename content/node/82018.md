body: "[img:sites/default/files/old-images/IMGP8319_5627.png]\r\nThe idea is presumably
  to pre-empt grafitti and postering (the previous ones were the same object with
  a plain paint job), but apart from that concept this \"postal code collage\" is
  a nicely done design."

  body: "The graffiti version is, in my experience, quite underwhelming. The only
    fun one near my home is gold spraypainted with a completely illegible scrawl but
    for some inexplicable reason includes a Legend of Zelda triforce logo.\r\n\r\nThe
    postal code collage does seem to be working. I have yet to see any of them with
    graffiti."

    a piece of art.

    fragments on the new Canada Post boxes encode a hidden message.

    way entire cities would look gift-wrapped, and all way-finding devices get hopelessly
    lost.

    one of the new ones, only using a different typeface.

    be covered in graffiti, it will also be destroyed.
