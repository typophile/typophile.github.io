body: I have created a design in Adobe Illustrator & Photoshop using "Sinhala MN"
  font and it looks as an occidental font type when it should be in hindi format.
  Why??? (I attach the difference))

  body: "Many fonts include glyphs for the basic ASCII characters in addition to the
    characters of the writing system they are primarily intended to support.\r\n\r\nSo
    whether you see characters in Sinhalese script or Latin characters depends on
    what text you type to be displayed in the font.\r\n\r\nSinhala MN, I see, is one
    of the standard fonts included with OS X 10.6 and greater."

    be sinhalese; if your software cannot handle indic script, the characters may
    come out in the wrong order)."

  body: I just checked and Sinhala MN on my mac is an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Advanced_Typography">AAT</a>
    font. I don't know if Illustrator supports AAT fonts (for which ligatures, reorderings
    etc. are performed by finite state machines).

    Photoshop and Indesign (CC 2014) on Mavericks, and it displays correctly. But
    you have to enable Adobe Word Ready Paragraph Composer on Indesign, Show Indic
    Options on Illustrator and Middle East and South Asian on Photoshop. See attached
    sample.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Sinhala_6029.jpg]"

  body: "You could try the fonts on the ICTA (Information and Communication Technology
    Agency of Sri Lanka) site: <a href=\"http://www.icta.lk/en/programmes/pli-development/104-local-languages-initiative-/1090-sinhala-stylized-fonts.html\">Stylized
    Sinhala Unicode Fonts</a>. They appear to be opentype fonts and are likely to
    behave better with Adobe products than AAT fonts. I tried WARNA.ttf. It does not
    work with textedit. Here is what I get with XeLaTeX.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/warna_xelatex_5245.png]\r\nTo
    select it, I had to call it \"ICTA Large Font\". I don't know where the system
    finds that name;  I had to use the command <code>ftxinstalledfonts</code> to find
    that. Here it the trace of execution in a terminal window:\r\n<blockquote>\r\n%
    ftxinstalledfonts -f -l | grep -i warna\r\n824\tICTA Large Font\t/Library/Fonts/1090_WARNA.ttf\r\n</blockquote>\r\n
    Here is the XeLaTeX source code\r\n<PRE>\r\n\\documentclass{article}\r\n\\usepackage{fontspec}\r\n\\setmainfont{ICTA
    Large Font}\r\n\\begin{document}\r\n\u0DC0\u0DD2\u0D9A\u0DD2\u0DB4\u0DD3\u0DA9\u0DD2\u0DBA\u0DCF,

    \u0DC0\u0DD9\u0DAD\u0DD2\u0DB1\u0DCA\r\n\\end{document} \r\n</PRE>\r\nWeird!\r\n\r\nCorrection:
    if I replace \"ICTA Large Font\" by WARNA in <code>setmainfont</code>,  XeLaTeX
    actually takes it. I just don't see WARNA listed in the fonts when I use TextEdit
    which only knows about \"ICTA Large Font\" but can't render it properly. "

  body: "I don't know the sinhala script nor where to find tests. The font Bhashitha
    looks interesting because it contains both AAT and opentype tables; Malithi contains
    only opentype tables. Both fonts may work fine with Adobe applications but Bhashitha
    appears to also work with TextEdit. Here is a grab from textedit; I just used
    the sequence of characters \u0DC0\u0DD9\u0DAD\u0DD2\u0DB1\u0DCA.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Bahitha-Malithi_5360.png]\r\nAs
    you can see the first two characters are not reordered by TextEdit with Malithi
    as they are with Bhashitha and Sinhala MN. Any further comment should be made
    by someone that knows the fonts and the language or at least the Sinhala script."
