  knowledgeable!\r\n\r\nI was wondering if you have any feedback on this logo for
  Sprinkles Cupcakes. It looks like it was a font that was just created, but I thought
  some of you might know if it was based on an actual font.\r\n\r\nI'd love to know
  your thoughts.\r\nIsabella[img:sites/default/files/old-images/logo_3681.gif]"

  body: "Isabella, it's very hard to know whether something 'script' is a font, or
    hand-drawn, unless there are enough letters to see some duplicates. Even then,
    it can be hard to be sure, because with OpenType fonts it is possible to have
    alternate characters and ligatures that vary the letters. Offhand I do not recognize
    this, although I know there are a number of Casual or Everyday Handwriting fonts
    that may be similar.\r\n\r\nIf you look at the Casual Flowing Scripts in <a href=\"http://bowfinprintworks.com/Script07Pg1.html\">Part
    7 of the Script Font ID Guide</a> you will see a large selection of this category
    of script. The other part of the Guide is <a href=\"http://bowfinprintworks.com/Script09Pg1.html\">Part
    9, Everyday Handwriting</a>. You may find this font, or something similar to it.
    Then use the <a href=\"http://bowfinprintworks.com/ListPages/ScriptListAB.html\">Script
    Font Reference List</a> to see where it comes from.\r\n\r\n - Mike Yanega"

    Pro</a> which can achieve a natural flowing look using the OpenType features that
    Mike mentions.

  body: It looks more rounded to me... but maybe I'm incorrect. More like a Gothic
    font. But I could be wrong and looking foolish :)

  body: "It might be easier to tell if you had some other letters, like a G, M and
    R. These would separate some of the possibilities out, but I agree that Helvetica
    looks consistent with your sample. So would Arial, I think, but those upper case
    letters would separate them.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

    Keep in mind that a font at this size can look very different (as the 'e's are
    here) depending on the antialiasing technique.\r\n\r\nWhat do you mean by the
    terms \"rounded\" and \"Gothic\"?"
