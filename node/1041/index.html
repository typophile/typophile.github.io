<div class=commentbody>Thanks Dmitry. Now that I haven't looked at this for 8 hours I see what you mean about the W. Is it the top left serif that makes it look unbalanced? I'd to maintain that serif, but it does need some work. <br> <br>Hmmmm. Not sure what to do.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Tiffany, <br> <br>That is exactly what I want to achieve. I tried that with the R, there is a notch (albeit subtle) on the diagonal. I guess that needs to fleshed out some more? <br> <br>Before I had the crossbar on the A not meet, as well as the left side of the W separate from the right. But I didn't want to go the 'stencil' route. <br> <br>I will do some more 'notching' and repost, but does the W seem awkward in terms of balance to you (or anyone else)? I want the basic letterforms to be solid before I start embellishing them. <br> <br></div>

<div class=card-body>
<div class=commentbody>I like Z a lot too, Peter. Maybe if you make the notch (or "crotch") in the R a bit bigger, it'll lighten up the joint in the middle. I think that's one of the reasons it looks so much darker. I also think the reason the W seems unbalanced is the difference between the two apertures at the top - and the counter space. The left counter is much smaller and has a smaller aperture. Maybe it'd help to widen it some.</div>

<div class=commentbody>looks like you've forgot to round out the corner bezier on the connector there to the top right serif on M. <br> <br>Its a yummy Z, I'd make the notch in the R the same as Z for consistency <br> <br>yep, I'll say it too - the R is a bit thick in comparison to the rest. Looks like you might need a hairline planned out like you do in the M, A, K and W. <br> <br>in fact wait a second - you might want to make all those hairlines appear the same thickness come to think of it. <br> <br>The A looks uncentered. think the apex should shift a bit more to the right. <br> <br>yep that's it.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Generally it's a bad idea to mix two similar faces. Either use a sans or a script for the "photographs" but don't use a Serif face for it. Unless you want to expand your little alphabet to include the letters in "photographs" too.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Peter, I prefer the sans as well. However, I think you need something geometric. -- The spacing in Mark Zarnow is off. The two words need less word spacing, and then you need to work with the separate letter spaces more as well.

<div class=commentbody>I like the new changes too Peter. And I think these two comments from Chris and Tiffany will do a lot to point you in the right direction: <br> <br>>Generally it's a bad idea to mix two similar faces <br>>I think you need something geometric. <br> <br>I.e., use a sans serif, but a sans like Gill is still too close to classical letterforms (too much like MARK ZARNOW). Hence Tiffany's suggestion of a geometric. Well, I think - I certainly don't want to misrepresent anyone. <br> <br>One thing about the letters in MARK ZARNOW: the "R" is still too heavy to my eyes. Is it possible to widen it slightly - or make the tail thinner (more like "K") - in order to create more counterspace?</div>

<div class=commentbody>Tiffany, <br>You were so right about the spacing. Thank you. I think I have tightened it up now. I still am not sure about the NOW though. Is the W too close to the O? <br> <br>Chris, <br>I knew that. What the hell was I thinking ;) <br> <br>And Nathan, <br>Great suggestion on the R. Though I was a little concerned that the counterform of the A was too small so I enlarged it a bit. <br> <br>re: geometris sans <br> <br>I was using Apex for this very reason, but I guess it is too techy/contemporary for this context.

<div class=commentbody>Loosen the "RK" and the "RN". <br>Tighten the "AR"s a hair. <br> <br>Maybe do something more with the "Z". <br> <br>Try Bank Gothic for the sans.

<div class=commentbody>Not every font is Madonna. I think the type expresses plenty, but in subtle ways, as opposed to screaming <br>"Look at me, look at meeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee - I'm more important than the text I'm set in!!!" <br> <br>That's not some bland text face - the R, Z and W especially are full of character. <br> <br>hhp <br></div>

<div class=commentbody>I think the type is very strong also. I don't know about the left diagonal on the M, which would normally be heavier in relation to the right stem. If you haven't tried it yet, You might try thickening it and see if you like it better. </div>

<div class=commentbody>Hrant. Good call on the spacing, though I wasn't so sure on the AR tightening, but did it anyway so we can have a look. <br> <br>I love Apex, I think I may go with it. Bank Gothic could work too, I like it's horizontal appeal, but not into those terminals on the G and S. <br> <br>Daniel, I disagree with you for the following reason: The client wanted something classic and sheik, yet humble and unpretentious (maybe a little pretentious). He's a fashion photographer, and this logotype is based off of elements of the Prada logo (see the A) and an old letterpress small caps font I found. <br> <br>I think I am acheiving exactly what I set out to do. <br> <br>Show me an example of the requirements I had that has more "emotion" and isn't as "forgetable" as mine, and maybe I'll reconsider. <br> <br><img src=http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/15078.gif alt></div>

<div class=commentbody>I think you went a bit too far in the spacing tweaks - maybe pull them back by half. Almost there though! <br> <br>hhp <br></div>

<div class=commentbody>Ok...pulled back the spacing. widened the crossbar on the M and N (good suggestion william, I think it helped balanced out the thickness across all the letters). <br> <br>still not sure on the NOW. I think NO is fine, just not sure about OW. Is MA a bit loose? <br> <br><img src=http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/15088.gif alt></div>

<div class=commentbody>You have greater evenness in spacing now, but I liked the wider spacing you started with. The heavy letters, widely spaced, have a striking look. Generally, I think widely spaced caps give a kind of monumental feel. I don't know about the photographer, but if he is aiming at that kind of look - like Karsh used to do in portraits - it might be appropriate. </div>

<div class=commentbody>I agree in part with daniel, if this is a logo you have to make it memorable too. The notch could grow bigger, but there can be many other options</div>

<div class=commentbody>Make the "Z" just a bit wider. Most people make <br>"Z"s too narrow. "Z" should usually be a bit <br>wider than "N", especially in more classic fonts. <br> <br>By contrast, I would try making the "A"s very <br>slightly narrower -- but not by too much. <br>You have some nice diagonals going. <br> <br>This is looking very nice! <br> <br> <br>David</div>
