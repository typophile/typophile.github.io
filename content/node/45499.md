  - Gujarati)\r\nI opened \"Guajrati MT\" in FontLab but didn't get any type of tables
  like open type table we see in an OTF font.\r\n\r\nCan any body guide me where the
  table is saved or based up on which information the ATSUI handles the proper display
  of glyphs in conjunct chartors?\r\n\r\nThanks in Advance\r\nHimanshu"
