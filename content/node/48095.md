  such as tails? \r\n\r\nApologies for the newbie question, I am not exactly sure
  when a san-serif becomes a serif?\r\n\r\nI am trying to create a logo that has a
  nod towards the traditional aspect of the company, as well as the forward thinkingness
  of the company.\r\n\r\nAppreciate any help to get me on the right track.\r\n\r\nThanks"

  body: "something with more serif attributes I think, I am still learning, looking
    through a book I have, they say the classification is slab-serif. I guess I didn't
    explain too well, wanted something serifs, square serifs.\r\n\r\nNow I have found
    a category for the type of face, should make i easy. \r\n\r\nPlease post any nice
    slab-serif faces though."

  body: Wow- Finnegan is a nice suggestion based on the original need. I was thinking
    Optima, but the need for slab serifs leaves me a bit confused. Is it the fatness
    and squareness that you want?
