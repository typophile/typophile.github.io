body: I am designing packaging for chocolates and I want to get the message across
  as them having a luxury feel to them. They are aimed at women, maybe over 25 who
  want to relax and enjoy eating these luxurious chocolates. I would like feedback
  on the choice of typeface I have chose but not sure which one works the best. Please
  feel free to give feedback.

  body: Fourth down on the "easter egg" image. Cursive seems the way to go to me,
    and that option isn't crazily nuptual-looking.

  body: "Futura's also quite interesting (3rd on 557). It perhaps doesn't cue chocolates
    as much as the cursive options, but for the same reason it's less predictable
    too.\r\n\r\nIt might be worth trying Cochin.   "

  body: Am I being silly using the top one on 557? I thought it would give a modern,
    contemporary feel like Arun mentioned above? Hmmm...now thats a hard choice. Cochin
    seemed too uneasy for me because of the baseline where the letters sit. It doesn't
    seem too happy in its place using Cochin. It doesnt do it for me for this but
    thanks for the feedback. Much appreciated.

  body: "That's quite nice too. I'd loosen the spacing a little - ab and at in particular.\r\n\r\nProbably
    redraw the forms so that even in on-screen applications (if you expect to have
    any), the lines remain well-defined."

  body: I was wondering what kind of type would be suitable for body copy in conjunction
    with thrid one down on 577? Should I have small caps for ingriedients on my easter
    egg packaging? Or should it be a light font but remember it is going to be printed
    on a brown background. Therefore, I need it to be legible and not have the ink
    bleed on to my white type. Any suggestions?

  body: "What exactly is easter egg packaging? \r\n\r\nThe safe option, I imagine
    would be to use Futura for the back-of-pack too. But maybe not small caps. \r\n\r\nIf
    the text is not too small, wouldn't a rather fine serif work? I'd try Weiss (...
    and why do I keep thinking of Cochin?)  "

  body: I don't know. Does it depend where in teh world you live? I mean we all have
    different tastes etc but we could all see one font working well in a different
    light. Like Eric and Hrant have mentioned that the typeface they pointed out would
    definitely work but so would the one you mentioned that I had on my images. Nevermind...maybe
    it would work for some people and not for others. Its always debatable I guess...but
    I don't think it works as strong as them two if you know what I mean but nevermind.
    thanks for the advice though. Much appreciated :)

    vary from country to country in clothes, design etc. I'm not sure whether you
    agree. Something might look sophisticated in one place but not so sophisticated
    in another. Does age and taste determine design solutions too to some extent or
    does it not? I'm not sure. What do you think? I'd like your opinion. \r\nPS noway
    you lived in a placed named Cochin. haha :)"

  body: "I hate to be a sour puss, but it's really hard to make any call from only
    a stripe + text. Any of these typefaces could work in some context to accomplish
    your goal. But here we have no context. It feels like you're starting with a typeface
    instead of a direction. And there are so many directions that would fit your demographic.\r\n\r\nIf
    the packaging had line illustration, that might dictate a certain type choice.\r\nIf
    the packaging had watercolor illustration, perhaps another type choice.\r\nIf
    the packaging was wrapped in sassy fishnet stockings a very different choice.\r\nIf
    the packaging was a just a stripe, I'll take the fishnet.\r\n\r\nAll that to say...
    show us the packaging. Show us your direction so we can help you.\r\n\r\nAs a
    lover of chocolate I admire the shelf appeal and taste of the following:\r\nhttp://www.charleschocolates.com
    (hip contemporary - especially their bars)\r\nhttp://www.scharffenberger.com (old
    world with a twist - love the nibby bar)\r\nhttp://www.vosgeschocolate.com (juicy
    couture meets tiffany's over truffles)\r\n\r\nFWIW, Sabbath Black is the type
    of choice to go with the fishnet :-)\r\nGive your chocolate a voice...\r\n\r\nBest
    of luck.\r\nRandy"
