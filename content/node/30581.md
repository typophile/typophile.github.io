body: "Which typeface do you think suits the whole idea of an agriculture show? The
  agriculture show has been going on since the 1770's in the Northwest of England.
  It is usually attended by the elder generation and people into the farming industries/husbandry
  skills etc. Although it has started to become into a family day out for all, i still
  want to target and inform the original target audience in the poster i am going
  to be using this type for. So what do you think? Which one should I go for?\r\nPS
  the patron for the agriculture show is the Queen Elizabeth of UK."

  body: "I live on a farm in the northeast of the U.S., in an agricultural district
    (one that by our young U.S. standards, is very old -- settled since late 1700s.)
    Somehow the northwest of England feels as if it would be pretty similar in its
    values and traditions. \r\n\r\nAll of the samples you posted feel to me like things
    that my neighbors would not relate to. They feel elegant, stylish, and \"downtown\"
    or \"High Street.\" \r\n\r\nSeems to me you might try for something with these
    qualities -- earthy, practical, straightforward, strong, not geometric, not modern
    \ -- as a way to relate to the fairgoers, rather than thinking about the Queen
    and going for elegance. But that's only my Yank interpretation of what your event
    is all about."

    body: Hmmmm, i suppose and the qualities you have mentioned seem right. Could
      you please recommend any typefaces that you think would be appropriate for me
      to get an idea of what sort. Thanks.
