body: I have some files said to be in &#34;Melior 9 and a half pt and 13 pt&#34; that
  cannot be read in Windows/Word Office 2003 without much garbling and loss of format,
  eg loss of apostrophes.  In the font window they show as &#34;Adv Mel&#34;.  Obviously
  it tries to use the &#34;nearest&#34; font, which is not very near, and no other
  font selection works either. <BR> <BR>Please can anyone suggest a way to launder
  the files into Times New Roman without any loss of detail?   <BR> <BR>Thanks <BR>Clive

    change the type definition from &#39;Melior&#39; to &#39;Times New Roman&#39;,
    in Word, is there no option to specify a different, alternate font.? &#40; I am
    also not too sure about &#39;Times New Roman&#39; being such a good alternate
    successor, replacing &#39;Melior&#39;, concerning the formatting / setting / spacing
    / aligning of the original Word file.. &#41;</i> <BR> <BR>But, just in case you

  body: Clive, can you remove all formatting and change it to plain text? If so you
    could then change it to Times New Roman
