body: "It's my first time in this forum and I'd like to thank you all beforehand for
  your collaboration. I'm involved in an art commission project for a hospital that
  involves type. The design concept propose to use poems in the corridors of the emergency
  area. It's an  environmental graphic design project and excuse me if I'm not in
  the right forum.\r\n\r\nI have done some research to find a typeface that will suit
  the project. So far, the chosen font is PraxisEF Small Caps, which I believe, it
  works quite well. It looks quite formal yet friendly and not as industrial as, for
  instance Helvetica. We decided on Small Caps because they reduce visual noise as
  they don't have ascenders and descenders; it is very important to avoid visual noise
  as the hospital is a place for healing and calm.\r\n\r\nWe would appreciate some
  feedback regarding the font (we are still in process designing the layout) as we
  are still in time to choose a different typeface. Any suggestion will be welcome.
  \r\n\r\nThanks \r\n\r\n(colours in the images appear quite different from the ones
  we'll be using)\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/In hospital visual_4_4949.jpg][img:sites/default/files/old-images/In

  hospital visual_1_4845.jpg]\r\n\r\nThis is more like it should look like regarding
  the colours and yes it is not the right excerpt of the poem I chose for the example
  sorry.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/In-hospital-visual_3712.jpg]"

    I would go with an all-(small)-caps setting."

  body: "Thanks for your comments\r\n\r\n@Sim Yeah, migration sans looks quite formal
    and friendly although I can't find a the small caps to try them (on screen) it
    might be that fontshop doesn't allow that feature or I can't find it. I'll be
    glad to hear any other suggestion similar to this one.\r\n\r\n@Riccard0 Sorry
    I might not explain myself quite well. What I mean is that using small caps create
    blocks of text that could be easily place one on top of the other without descenders
    and ascenders touching. Glad to hear you would also go for an all small caps setting.\r\n\r\n\r\n@Will
    I know I didn't choose the right excerpt of the poem for the sample ops. Totally
    agree rhythm doesn't equate noise. "

    it easier to set headlines tight.

    anyway.
