body: "Background: The client is an agent for study abroad language learning. The
  purpose of their company is to help students research and book study aboard language
  courses. The media is mostly web, although I suspect biz cards will follow. Message
  should portray a reputable and trustworthy source for honest comparisons of language
  schools and their courses. The typeface will be for display. There might be illustrations
  with it, most likely a friendly looking \"agent\" or \"counselor\" type person.\r\n\r\nHere's
  what I have in mind so far.\r\n\r\nLooking for something friendly like Comalle...\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/MLG-Comalle_5607.png]\r\n\r\n\r\nPlayful
  like Bello pro...\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/MLG-Bello-pro_4893.png]\r\n\r\n\r\nReadable
  (and a little more serious) like Museo...\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/MLG-Museo_4254.png]\r\n\r\n\r\nAsking
  for suggestions on which typeface might do the job well. As well as some inspiration.
  \r\n\r\nI greatly appreciate any feedback/questions. Thanks very much!\r\n\r\n(First-time
  post, long-time fan of Typophile! =)"

  body: "Scott,\r\n\r\nGreat suggestion! However, I'm looking for something a bit
    more informal than Archer.\r\n\r\nArcher italic does have the well-rounded friendliness
    I desire, but it's not quite playful enough. A worthy adversary on Museo's playing
    field. Although not close enough to the hand-drawn feel of Comalle. Definitely
    going to keep Archer in mind.\r\n\r\nSo glad you reminded me of H&FJ. Thanks!\r\n\r\nJason

  body: "I think Comalle is really fun, but dangerous for an identity as it's not
    going to perform any smaller than you display it here. It was not made for business

    the task if you're not experienced as a letterer or type designer. Museo ain't

    Not sure if I like the weight of the caps in relation to the lowercase.

  body: "Thanks everyone, awesome suggestions! You didn't let me down.\r\n\r\n\r\n@Stephen:
    Good point, I was thinking that about Comalle as well. No smaller weights either.
    I'm a newbie type designer, so any modifications I make will be minimal.\r\n\r\n@Jos:
    Yep, I agree. Rayuela Chocolate italic is right up my alley. Yea, I see the lack
    of contrast in the caps to lowercase.\r\n\r\n@Stefan: Yes, I plan on it! Thanks
    for the reminder and encouragement as well. (I promise I won't hack up anyones
    hard work. If I must, I will contact the type designer directly and ask for their
    help.)\r\n\r\n@poms: I'm considering Sauna, although it looks a little too \"fat
    kid eating marshmallow's\" for this identity. ;)\r\n\r\n<strong>Omnes</strong>
    is a great suggestion, I'm digging that a lot! Will seriously consider.\r\n\r\n@Sharon:
    Thanks for the sample! I'm not quite sure a slab serif feels right. Appreciate
    the suggestion, of course. =)\r\n\r\n\r\nI'll keep you updated on which I decide.
    Thanks again!"

    Have you thought about the color?"

  body: "@Pentapus: I have thought about color schemes for the identity, but not specifically
    for the logotype, yet. The overall identity will most likely be blue, green, yellow
    or a combination of one of them. Reinforced with tinted whites and blacks, probably
    not straight white or black though.\r\n\r\nI'll whole-heartedly consider Oxtail,
    although it wasn't love at first sight (for this identity). I've added it to the
    sample type wall.\r\n\r\n\r\nI'm leaning more towards <a href=\"http://www.dardenstudio.com/typefaces/omnes\">Darden
    Studio's Omnes</a>, at the moment.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Darden-Studio-Omnes_6399.jpg]\r\n\r\nThanks
