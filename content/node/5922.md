body: ' This is a logotype I created for the US office of this fine cheese. Parmiggiano-Reggiano
  is about 800 years old, and far tastier and more nutritious than any aerosal cheese
  product. The giant wheels of cheese are incised with the name in pindot lettering
  all along their sides. This lettering cannot be used as the logo for trademark resons.
  I handlettered the same letterforms as solid lines. The curve on the &#34;O&#34;
  resembles the arc of the cheese wheel&#39;s side. I&#39;m entertaining creating
  the rest of the font in Fontographer, but would appreciate feedback from those who
  can spare it. Thanks. '

  body: ' Thanks guys. There is a bolder, slightly more openly letterspaced version
    version for web use. I&#39;m currently working on the &#34;S&#34; for the Americanized
    word &#34;Parmesan&#34;. It sadly looks like a backwards &#34;Z&#34;, but give
