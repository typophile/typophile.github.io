body: Does anyone know of good resources for finding early back-issues of typographic
  magazines (such as Dot Dot Dot, Eye, Emigre, and others)? Apart from ebay and abebooks,
  are there other resources or forums for rare issues?

    no single source, but bookfinder.com, which is a meta searrch engine for all the
    major antiquarian book searches (including abebook.com) is probably your best
    bet. eBay is also a necessary place to check."

    had a bit of free time to explore. Ended up in the <a href=\"http://www.kunsthalle-berlin.de/\">Kunsthalle</a>.
    Saw they had a large collection of books and magazines by the front door, naturally
    presumed they were for sale, saw they had issues #1, #2 and #3 of [[Dot Dot Dot]].
    Strolled up to the girl at the counter to pay for them only to be told it was
    an <em>archive</em>. She sent my red-faced Irish behind back over to put them
    were I found them.\r\n\r\nSo I know they have them there, should you ever want
    to read them."

    in DDD issue 1 belongs to me. That has to earn me double rarity points. :-)

    I found this: www.centralbooks.co.uk - prices seem quite reasonable for what''s
    available (which is a lot, but not the very earliest and rarest issues).'
