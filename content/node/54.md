  create the lowercase letter &#34;o&#34; with a macron &#40;horizontal line&#41;
  over it. I realize this can be created using a program like Fontographer, but was
  hoping for a quicker, easier solution. I haven&#39;t been able to figure it out.
  Thank you in advance, and please feel free to e-mail me your response: <A HREF="mailto:kenny.eicher@imgusa.com">kenny.eicher@imgusa.com</A>'

  body: ' I&#39;m not sure about the PC solution, but on a Macintosh, the macron can
    be accessed by typing &#91;option&#93;&#91;shift&#93;&#91;comma&#93;. It is an
    independent character &#40;where it is included in a font&#39;s characters set
    at all&#41;, and must be manually kerned over the character which it accents.
    <BR> <BR>To get the effect you requested, you would have to type an &#34;o&#34;,
    then type &#34;&#91;option&#93;&#91;shift&#93;&#91;comma&#93;&#34;, then kern
    the two together. Yeah, it&#39;s lame, but I haven&#39;t found any other way to
    do it other than to create the accented character in a special auxilliary font.
    <BR> <BR>Anyone else have another solution? <BR> <BR>David '
