  is a testing tool that is part of the Adobe Font Development Kit for OpenType (AFDKO).
  As of version 2, it's a command-line only tool. AFDKO is available for OS X and
  Windows.\r\n\r\nCompareFamily does a large number of different little tests. Many
  (though not all) are aimed at testing the relationships between fonts in a family
  to look for unexpected inconsistentcies. For example, if one font in a family has
  a different copyright or trademark statement, that will get flagged with a warning.
  CompareFamily also looks at style naming, style linking and weightclass settings,
  all of which need to be coordinated within a family."
