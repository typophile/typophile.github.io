    own look subtly. Can you tell us some of design ideas that guided you, and differentiates
    this from other humanist sans?  '

    Since I know him, he is working on it. The real world specimen - a printed one
    in German and English is in the works and will hopefully available in a month
    or two, saying more about the concept behind the typeface.\r\n\r\nFor the monent
    a very short German text is available only.\r\nhttp://www.germantype.com/cms/info_phoen.htm\r\n\r\nWe

  body: "Oh, congratulations then to Ingo. What I get from the German text is just
    that this is a development of ideas from Bernard Gothic, which evidently was the
    first to remove the stems from the mn etc. \r\n\r\nIt is interesting to compare
    this with Daxline, which is also an optically monoline, stemless sans. I prefer
    Phoenica. "
