body: Looking to correctly I.D. this font.  Looks like Neuland Inline, but with a
  few differences, namely the placement of the inline markings and minor discrepancies
  in character shapes.  Could it be an older or more specific version? Thanks.

  body: Neuland was also cut under the name Othello, and there could be differences
    across foundries, perhaps this particular sample is that.
