    the left, then flipping it and moving it to the right to create wings. Just a

    chorus of this church. \r\nTraditional but contemporary.\r\n\r\nI have used the
    chorus name into the musical staff, because the chorus is the music, the musical
    notes.\r\n\r\n"

  body: "utt73-\r\n\r\nthose are beautiful. I'm not sure of your level rose, but this
    might be a pretty good idea for a direction. I think the design you have is too
    static. Also, maybe try another typeface. I think you might want a lighter face,
    possibly script face?. it's just that now, the lines of the \"staff\" and the
    lines of \"CORO\" are practically the same width. Think contrast in scale.\r\n\r\nAlso,
    just one small thought about the staff, it doesn't read musical staff yet. Because
    it's wavy...it reminds me more of water...or the more obvious...waves ;) Maybe
    add the end vertical bars at the end? (The thick and thin lines that are at the
    end of the sheet music.) Again..,just a thought, but ya know :D\r\n\r\ncourtney"

    100% done yet, I think it works.\r\n\r\nThe first thing that popped into my head
    is a sheet music book my sister used to have, Chopin and others I think.\r\n\r\nYou
    certainly communicated something with class, something musical and also something
    that's current.  Those are all what you seem to be going for, just finish up the
    details and I think you'll be golden!\r\n\r\nEDIT: ah, and I got that it was a
    staff because of the number (5) of lines, I'm not sure you need more than that,
    but I do find the ends of the lines too abrupt. a tapering of the lines at the
    end might soften them and make them feel more calligraphic.  Just my 2\xA2"
