  that I kind of lied on Typophile. :-(  It wasn't intentional, honestly \u2013 my
  memory failed me. I'm not sure that constitues lying, but I'm not particularly proud
  of it, and I apologize.\r\n\r\nI said Ernestine is my first font. Now, while I did
  vaguely remember that I dabbled around a bit in Fontographer a number of years ago
  but quickly realized I didn't know what I was doing\u2026 I just discovered that
  I actually completed wonky lc, UC, and numerals, and <a href=\"http://groups.google.com/group/alt.design.graphics/browse_thread/thread/c4fd1f9cdcad081\">put
  \"my first font\" up for crits on alt.design.graphics</a> in 2001!\r\n\r\nKids,
  don't do drugs or you won't remember what embarrassing things you did eight years
  ago. :-|\r\n\r\nWell it looks like there was reason enough to forget this, too.
  What better way to atone for past sins than to show this off in all its glorious
  ugliness? (Feel free to point your fingers and giggle.) Thanks to WayBackMachine
  I just managed to retrieve an archived copy of a .ttf off my long-defunct old web
  site. So this is what it looks like, complete with strange unintentional overlaps,
  mirrored bpdq, and an \"A\" that took too many blue pills.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/identb_alphabet_5888.gif]\r\n\r\nI
  guess from now on I'll call Ernestine my \"first serious font\"\u2026"

  body: I think we all do this. I call Castor my first font, but in fact, it's something
    like my fourth. In college I did two bitmap fonts (one Runic, one Cherokee), but
    those files are long gone. Now in the outline era, I did one before Castor (used
    on the cover [[http://www.beechstave.com/jasanoff.htm|of this book]], but I'm
    not entirely happy with it, and it's never been released. (And as for Castor,
    look for it soon in the critiques section...)

  body: "Fun thread! I decided to dig up some of my really old stuff and play too.\r\n\r\nHere's
    one of the first fonts I ever designed, for an old <a href=\"http://www.nefec.org/UPM/printers/mepf80.htm\">Epson
    FX-80</a> dot matrix printer. The basic resolution was 72 dpi, but by taking multiple
    passes you could amp it up. I also, of course, wanted proportional width, which
    was a big deal back then. I don't have an exact date, but suspect it would have
    been around 1984, maybe 85. It wasn't my absolute first font (that would have
    been making new 8x16 bitmaps for the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tandy_1000\">Tandy
    1000</a>, which was programmable that way), but the first for print.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/dotmatrix1_5891.png]\r\n\r\nI
    also did a Hebrew, and got started on a shadowed font too. Oooh, special effects!\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/dotmatrix2_4631.png]\r\n\r\nBut
    the first scalable font I ever designed was Zaltbommel, intended to be an industrial
    design, but with very open apertures so it would work in small print. My dad and
    I called it \"Shmuro,\" as a kind of riff off Eurostile, before he chose the final
    name. As you can see, it was designed on a grid. I wrote the font editor myself,
    but that's not so impressive, everything was based on bitmaps at 256 to the em,
    and then scaled entirely in bitmap space. It looked pretty bad in large sizes.
    Anyway, the date on this one is \"Thanksgiving Day, 1986\".\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/zaltbommel_4543.png]\r\n\r\nThankfully,
