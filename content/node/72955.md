  would go with Sentinel. I know the rule with pairing is to not have the fonts too
  closely related .. Sentinel is a slab and miller a somewhat Scotch serif. Hoefler
  Frere Jones is the foundry.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure if they're too close and have enough
  contrast. I could go radically different font for pairing with Sentinel as well
  .. or if I've made a good choice ... if anyone has any ideas. \r\nThanks in advance.\r\n"

  body: "A natural companion for a Clarendon (such as Sentinel) would be a realist
    sans (Helvetica). But I don't think it's a crime to use it with Miller. See how
    they work together.\r\n\r\nWhere do you intend to use Sentinel: in text or for
    titles? You could use Trade Gothic Bold for titles. Or one of H&FJ's sans."

  body: "I think Miller is a fine choice: They both have similar skeletons, and even
    the italics have a lot in common. The lighter weights of Sentinel, though, may
    look a bit close to Miller if you're pairing them at the same size. I'd recommend
    using a nice different in weight or size to properly differentiate them.\r\n\r\nAs
    more evidence, H&FJ's own recommendations are always effective, and <a href=http://www.typography.com/fonts/font_overview.php?productLineID=100034>for
    Sentinel</a> they suggest pairing it with Chronicle, a Scotch like Miller."

  body: "Ionics/Clarendons and Scotches are fine companions. The earliest examples
    of both arose around the same time and region. \r\n\r\nUsing a Clarendon as a
    bold companion for a Scotch in running text can have overtones of period typography.
    As in this example of Belizio (a Clarendon) with Miller Text (a Scotch):\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Belizio-MillerText_3714.png]\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\nI
    agree with Reed: keep the contrast in weight or size sufficient to differentiate
    their use."

  body: "Kent, your example is anachronistic -- Miller is too transitional (especially
    the italic \"v\") to be paired with a Clarendon and evoke an historic moment in
    time. The Scotch Modern is the \"correct\" historical partner for Clarendons.\r\n\r\nThis
    image was originally posted at Typophile by James Mosely:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Clarendon_5599.png]\r\n\r\nHowever,
    because its slabs are not bracketed, Sentinel does evoke the earliest slab serif
    types, just as Miller evokes an early Scotch Roman, so the two go together historically.\r\n"

    Agreed. When I said \u201Covertones of period typography,\u201D I did not mean
    to imply that the pairing would have authentic verisimilitude or be genuinely
    allusive. Just that it would be evocative, as you say.\r\n\r\n\u201CI\u2019ll
    bet these two might really learn to like each other. Y\u2019know, their great
    grandparents used to hang out together back in the old country, back in the day.
    Whaddaya say let\u2019s get these kids together down at the local pub for a meet-up.\u201D"
