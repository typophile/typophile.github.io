  body: "Rather the original Helvetica (not Neue). URW has a Poster version that \u2013\_regarding
    proportions and details \u2013 appears to be a slightly better match than others;
    <a href=\"http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/urw/nimbus-sans/bold/?refby=mfde\">Nimbus
    Sans P Bold</a>.\r\nIn case you need to reproduce the soft edges and don\u2019t
    want to do it manually, you might like Alte Haas Grotesk. Although I generally
    \ try to avoid such knock-off freebies, it might serve valuably in this particular
    case.\r\n\r\nBack to the Garamond: again, URW\u2019s <a href=\"http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/urw/amsterdamer-garamont/?testdrive=custom%3D0%26dock%3Dfalse%26size%3D72%26w%3D720%26src%3Dcustom%26text%3DThe%2520ragazzi%26fg%3D000000%26bg%3Dffffff%26goodies%3Dfit%26seed%3D32?refby=mfde\">Amsterdamer

  body: "Nice one, Florian. Glory, Nimbus Sans is a dead ringer for Helvetica! I don't
    know anything about the history of Nimbus Sans. Is it an Arial-esque \"interpretation\"
    of Helvetica or something? \r\n\r\nAs for whether the sample better matches Helvetica
    or Helvetica Neue, the roundness of the characters and the very shallow descender
    on the G all say Neue to me. "

  body: "Stephen, unlike Arial, Nimbus Sans actually <em>is</em> Helvetica. When digital
    type was still in its swaddling clothes, URW digitized typefaces for other companies.
    In return, they obtained the rights to use this data and license these fonts to
    others. As the original names were trademarked, they only had to come up with
    pseudonyms \u2013 like Nimbus Sans.\r\n\r\nHere\u2019s more information:\r\n<a
    href=\"http://www.typophile.com/node/4573\">Deja Vu Helvetica (Research + Identification)</a>\r\n<a
    href=\"http://typophile.com/node/49127\">Are there differences between Nimbus
    sans and Helvetica?</a>\r\n\r\n<cite>all say Neue to me</cite>\r\n\u2026 but this
    is a book cover from 1968, and Neue Helvetica was born in 1983. :-)"

  body: "Mariano, if the cover is from 1968 I strongly doubt it's Alte Haas Grotesk.
    See me getting it wrong for the same reason with Helvetica Neue above. :) I imagine
    the typeface used here would pre-date anything found on Dafont. \r\n\r\nThanks
    for the info and links, Florian. Very interesting. I've finally got around to
    buying the Helvetica film (which I missed in the cinema), and am looking forward
    to learning more about good old Helvie. I'm hoping they cover the whole cloning/licensing
    issue."
