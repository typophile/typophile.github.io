  body: "You can do this in FontLab with the Paste Special command. Select the base
    glyph in the font window and Copy. Then select all the component glyphs and select
    Edit > Paste Special and choose Left Sidebearing, Right Sidebearing, and Adv.
    Width from the dialog.\r\n\r\nNote: you may want to check the Use Measurement
    Line While Copying Sidebearings option at the bottom if you have diacritics that
    extend horizontally beyond the base glyph (and set your measurement line somewhere
    in a \u201Csafe\u201D zone beforehand, obviously).\r\n\r\nOf course, if you have
    a large number of glyphs that you want to operate upon, then a Python script will
    work better, and I\u2019m sure someone has probably written one."

    to do this: \r\nSelect the component, right click and chose \"Copy Metrics\".
    Done.\r\n\r\nNote: This is only helpful if there is just one component in each
    cell. "
