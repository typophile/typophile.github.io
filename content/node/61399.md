  that we let you know that Will Powers, MHS Press Design & Production Manager, passed
  away yesterday (Tuesday) afternoon. He was vacationing at a family cabin in Canada
  with his wife when he unexpectedly had a massive heart attack.<cite>\r\n\r\nWill
  went by the user name *Powers* on Typophile. Before becoming a designer, he was
  a printer. Not a monitor-watcher, but an old-fashion printer. I will miss Will and
  his ironical sense of humor.\r\n"

    about ten years, running into him now an then through various professional and
    typographic concerns.\r\n\r\nI first heard of him when he wrote a column about
    typography for Advertising Techniques* magazine back in the early '80s. At the
    time he worked at a typesetting house in Minneapolis.\r\n\r\nLast time I saw him
    was at TypeCon in Buffalo. I participated in the Ludlow workshop he gave there.
    He couldn't make it to Atlanta this year, but was hoping to do more Ludlow workshops
    in the future.\r\n\r\nWow. So sad. He will be missed.\r\n\r\n(*Sister publication

    the pamphlet he printed for his erudite 2003 TypeCon presentation, <em>New Types

    know that a master typographer was an advocate of new typeface designs.\r\nNow,

  body: "I'm stunned and saddened. As kind and generous in the handful of times I
    got to meet with him in the past few years as he was in posts here.\r\n\r\nEarly
    last October, Will wrote me an email with two items. First was that he had decided
    the beautiful two-volume Deberny & Peignot 1927 specimen he had dug out of his
    treasure trove and loaned to me for my Face the Nation exhibition needn't be returned;
    he was offering it to my university's library as a gift.\r\n\r\nThe second item
    was that somehow he had arranged to commandeer the 6:30 am slot at a small local
    radio station the following Monday, and he invited me to listen is as he would
    be playing Ray Charles's early jazz recordings. I listened; it was fantastic.\r\n\r\nAnother
    memory that makes me smile is Kent Lew at Buffalo TypeCon announcing to convention-goers
    that Will had left but wanted everyone to hear his advice to place the lead Ludlow
    slugs he'd given out as souvenirs of his workshop/presentation in an easily accessible
    location within luggage lest they raise the eyebrows of airport security.\r\n\r\nWe've
    lost a knowledgeable resource and a generous friend. "

    know his name it was because he was a man much more interested in promoting his
    craft than promoting himself. Like John, I always had a good feeling about and
    around him.\r\n\r\n<em>New Types for New Books</em> is well written and so insightful.
    Every typographer, and especially every type designer, could learn something from
    it. It's great evidence of his enthusiasm and expertise."

    and I first met in 2003 at TypeCon in Minneapolis. Since then he has become a
    good friend as well as an esteemed colleague. I remember sitting down to that
    first beer together and the invigorating, wide-ranging conversation, discovering
    all our many shared interests. \r\n\r\nIn addition to our love of type and typography,
    the history and the craft, Will and I shared an interest in birds and wildlife.
    We would periodically send reports to each other of the local changes of season
    -- Will: the flights of snow geese and pelicans up the central flyway or the first
    kinglet in April; or me: a fallout of spring warblers or a bittern \"singing\"
    from a nearby swamp.\r\n\r\nLast year he invited me to be on the jury to select
    book interiors for the AAUP's annual competition. We had a wonderful time talking
    about books and hanging out in NYC, where the judging took place. Later, in July,
    at the AAUP annual conference in Montreal, I fondly recall skipping out on the
    Saturday morning sessions together to spend 4 hours tramping around the Parc du
    Mont Royal instead, investigating the local birds and enjoying the trails.\r\n\r\nI
    was looking forward to hearing tales of this last month's grand tour around the
    Rockies and back across the Canadian plains to the cabin in Ontario. Will had
    confided in me that after his return, he was planning to ease into retirement
    from the press. He was looking forward to time for personal projects.\r\n\r\nThis
    sudden and permanent retirement is not what any of us had in mind. He will be
    sorely missed. \r\n\r\nMay he rest in peace.\r\n\r\n-- Kent.\r\n"

    he wrote, here and elsewhere, seem like a refreshing breeze that swept out the
    nonsense. \r\n\r\nHe was one of that small number of practitioners who care intensely
    about the details of book typography. Like so many of those, he came out of the
    craft of book production, so his design was grounded in the realities of typesetting,
    printing -- and reading. I will very much miss his side of this ongoing conversation.\r\n\r\nWill
    was looking forward to coming to this year's ATypI conference in Mexico City,
