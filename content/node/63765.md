body: Hi, I have to do an installation of words from a poem onto a large Library window,
  at the mo I am thinking of using vinyl lettering, yet the project is part of the
  X-mas lights fest the town has.... anyone got any funky ideas of how to do some
  kind of illuminated or X-mas words thing on the cheapish.. vinyl letting seems a
  bit obvious.
