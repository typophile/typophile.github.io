body: "One group of fonts I've always found fascinating is fonts used exclusively
  by a single corporation as part of their \"corporate identity\" programs.  There
  are a number of such fonts for which I'm trying to find good quality printed copies.\r\n\r\nCurrently,
  I have a printed copy of the official logo font of IBM (without the stripes).  The
  main ones I'm looking for are the following:\r\n\r\n*GTE (1971-2000 logo):\r\n--Squarish
  font resembling lettering on a CRT screen.  Used mostly during the 70's in division
  names, such as:\r\n----Sylvania (also used in newspaper ads for Sylvania TV sets,
  sometimes even on the sets themselves)\r\n----Lenkurt\r\n----Automatic Electric
  (Laboratories)\r\n----General Telephone Directory Company\r\n----General Telephone
  Company of (xxx)\r\n\r\n*3M (1961-78 \"Mondrian\" logo by Gerald Stahl)\r\n--Font
  colloquially referred to as \"Plumber's Gothic\".  Comes in upper and lower case
  with numerals.  Bears a very strong resemblance to the Georg Trump font \"City\".\r\n\r\n*Fisher
  Price (1971-)\r\n--Serif font derived from the turn-of-the-century ATF newspaper
  font \"Schoeffer\".  UC/lc, numerals, most punctuation.\r\n\r\n*CBS Sports (1981-)\r\n--Franklin
  Gothic Italic, with block serifs added.  Currently can be seen in the NCAA logo.\r\n\r\nWould
  anyone happen to have any of these companies' CI manuals?  Or know of a way I could
  get my hands on them?"

    by hand for the specific logo in question.\r\n\r\nI know for a fact that's how
    Doyald Young created the Prudential logo: he did the lettering based off a condensed
    version of Century Schoolbook (I think) and made customizations where he saw fit."
