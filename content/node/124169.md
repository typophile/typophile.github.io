  is a more mathematical, consistent and logical formula for selecting which typeface
  size to use in any given situation. I'm just seeking a bit more harmony in layouts.
  If anyone has any insight on this, I would greatly appreciate it. \r\n\r\nThanks
  in advance.  "

    you'll notice that newspapers go for less words per line than books on serious
    matters, fashion magazines mostly aren't concerned about this issue at all because
    their art directors consider text to be subordinate and a hindrance to their creative
    expression, book publishers pump up short texts to be big books by doing bad things
    to text sizes, websites are still in the dark ages, and that serious graphic designers
    are in a minority when it comes to facilitating easy reading.\r\n\r\nIn other
    words: experiment and see what works. For you, but mostly for the reader."

    this restaurant is just for teenagers, make sure the type is large enough for
    older folks.\r\n\r\nIf there's any doubt, print a test menu and ask a few retired
    folks if they can read it. Do it in the restaurant at night so it's a realistic
    test."
