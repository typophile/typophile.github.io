  body: "I was joking of course.\r\n\r\nRachel, any font choice should consider the
    rest of the design.\r\nWhat can you tell us about it (especially the other fonts
    used)?\r\n\r\nBTW, what would also help is being willing to spend a little bit\r\nof
    money (possible even just $20) on a non-free font, since that\r\nwould open you
    up to greater choice and higher quality.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "Well I found papyrus for free on a website. It could be a different font
    though.\r\nThe three sections of the book are mind body and spirit.\r\n\r\nFor
    mind we are using Didi and AHJ Function Reg\r\n\r\nFor body we are using Trade
    Gothic CT Bold and Avant Gard\r\n\r\nAll with the Body Copy being Cheltanham Light\r\n\r\nNow
    we're working on the Spirit Section..."

  body: "> I found papyrus for free on a website.\r\n\r\nWell, if it looks anything
    like this\r\nhttp://new.myfonts.com/fonts/letraset/papyrus/\r\nit's an illegal
    copy. More significantly -especially\r\nwith the religious angle here- it's an
    unethical copy.\r\n\r\nBut anyway you shouldn't be using Papyrus - it's cheese
    central.\r\n\r\nAbout the other ones you mention, I'd be curious to find out if
    you\r\nown them (maybe from before?) or if you casually \"acquired\" them.\r\n\r\nYou
    might only be 17 or so, but it's not too early to learn\r\nabout copyrights etc.,
    and I would suggest your school might\r\nbe OK with spending a little bit of money
    on fonts, and might\r\neven be impressed if you told them it's the right thing
    to do.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    of free fonts out there, who is supposed to know which are actually supposed to
    be bought? That's anyones excuse if you haven't noticed.

  body: "\"spiritual\" isn't a descriptor that really applies to a font. How do you
    define 'spiritual' as an aesthetic? \r\n\r\nSince this is for captions, I'd say
    the primary goal should be legibility. \r\n\r\n\"The problem with fonts is that
    not every fought has to be bought, unlike music and songs.\"\r\n\r\nNot all 'music
    and songs' needs to be purchased. "

    mind body & spirit. Instead of a caption headline, it would be more helpful for
    the actual headline font.\r\n\r\n\"Not all 'music and songs' needs to be purchased.\"\r\nFonts
    are different than anything else, and it's difficult for someone that isn't a
    graphic designer or expert on fonts to know which one's need to be bought!"

  body: hopefully no one will put you on blast about this post :) typographers are
    a sensitive lot. many of us spend an inordinate amount of time on a font only
    to be rewarded by someone casually using it for personal gain without any compensation
    offered. how would you feel if after all the time and effort you put in producing
    your yearbook, someone comes along and takes a copy, not knowing or not caring
    if it needs to be purchased? educate yourself about the use of fonts - unless
    it says free, you need to pay for it; if free and asking for a 'donation' give
    something. additionally, many fonts may be free except for commercial use - if
    you're charging for your yearbook (directly or indirectly), that's commercial.
    there are many free font websites, you have the burden of researching and finding
    the font that is right for your project. best of luck.
