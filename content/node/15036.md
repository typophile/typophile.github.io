    Caslon 224 Black</a>.\r\n\r\nThough the weight looks closer with <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/itc-caslon-224/bold/testdrive.html?s=Diefenbach+Set&p=36\"

  body: "From what I can tell from the BIG ITC Book of 1980, Caslon 223 is a display
    cut with really fine hairline strokes for the thins. The overall shape of the
    characters don't differ too much from <a href=\"http://www.linotype.com/13088/itccaslon224bold-font.html\"
    target=\"new\">Caslon 224</a> which had been modified by Ed Benguiat in 1982 for
    text (why???).\r\n\r\nIn both cases the bowl of the lowercase \"e\" isn't as small
    as the provided sample. Here's a really bad sample of <a href=\"http://www.datascan.co.uk/fontlib/fonts/caslon223lscbold.gif\"
    target=\"new\">Caslon 223</a> found at Datascan UK.\r\n\r\nOne thing to notice
    is that the tittle of 224 is much closer to the sample than the 223 tittle (display
    face).\r\n\r\n-----------------------------------------\r\nYes, I'm old, but I
    tittle in style!"
