body: I've been getting requests for a variety of font licenses and I'm starting to
  realize that I should probably get professional help for this kind of stuff. Can
  anyone recommend a good lawyer that would know how to do this? Does anyone know
  what the typical EULA costs to write?

    and various foundries.

    re-use it? I'm sure Bill Gates would be okay with you doing so.  ;-)
