    the kind of envelop you fold. You could even close it without glue or wax by folding
    the ends together. '

    paper covereing one side.\r\n\r\nI quite like Pritt stcks, too, but the surface
    you glue on has to be changed often. I usually use old magazines for that."

  body: "I agree with Mili.  I don't do any paperwork like this now but it was the
    standard for connecting and mounting  the slips of paper we made for my color
    theory class.  If you cut the paper properly you could get a seamless edge to
    edge connection.\r\n\r\n<em>\xABEl futuro es una l\xEDnea tan fina que apenas

  body: "The secret of gluing paper:\r\n\r\n1. Use Sobo craft glue. It\u2019s very
    similar to bookbinding glues, but a little more all-purpose\r\n2. Apply a thin
    layer of glue to both objects using a piece of matte board or bristol with just
    a little glue on the tip.\r\n3. Sandwich everything between layers of paper.\r\n4.
    Press in a book press overnight. Since you don\u2019t have one (and who does?)
    just pile a bunch of heavy art and design publications on it overnight.\r\n\r\nSince
    you\u2019re doing a bunch of these, the best thing to do is have one person glue
    while another person sticks the envelopes under the books."

  body: "If you've got some sitting around from other projects, you can also use matte
    polymer medium -- it's a well known substitute for PVA among bookbinders, and
    reasonably priced as well. \r\n\r\nFor just a few envelopes, a toothpick works
    well for spreading a very thin layer of glue (a small, cheap paintbrush works
    great too), and you should probably decant a small amount of glue at a time into
    a disposable container. I bought a sock of .75 oz plastic food service tubs (250
    of 'em for $3) at a warehouse store just for this purpose, and they work great.
    \r\n\r\nAs James said, pressing overnight makes them nice and flat -- put a sheet
    of wax paper between them so they don't accidently stick together (or to whatever
    you're using for weights!), and you can pile a bunch up."
