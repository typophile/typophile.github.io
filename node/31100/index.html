Does this have anything to do with DSIGs?

		<div class="commentbody">Are you referring to users having the ability to move fonts around with their user accounts? Because that's something people have been doing on networked computer systems for decades. Right now I could stick my OS X user account on a network share and be free to use my fonts at every single machine capable out mounting said share. Plenty of Windows users do it in large enterprises. Any font designer who tries to fight networked home directories will be on the wrong side in a battle he's guaranteed to lose, because it's going to get his designs locked out of most Windows and Unix networks.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Nope, not LAN WAN stuff and I ain't talkin' about accessing your CPU remotely rather I think it's much closer to the direction Google is headed in terms of creating web based apps accessible via a browser or integrated into an OS and if part of that spec means the ability to access licensed fonts not part of the default app font set, that means there will need to be some technology in place to validate the font licensing.

I don't think we'll see this sort of thing actually happen for 2-5 years but I do suspect we may be looking at an evolved application platform that will sync with a DRM system. Simon am I smokin' crack here or is this totally plausible?

		<div class="commentbody">Hi Stuart!

To be honest, I don't know exactly what this is referring to. But I could imagine that a user's 'setup' and files could be mirrored securely on-line in some way and a 'session' to that virtual machine could be established in much the same way as you might TS (terminal server) into your work computer from home. 

Traditionally when you TS into a machine I don't think there's any font specific licensing issues if the host machine is locked while the client machine accesses it. Where things become more tricky, with respect to licensing, is when you have multiple concurrent sessions connecting to the same machine - but that applies to apps, and other things as well as fonts.   </div>

It's this statement that really puzzles me the most because it's not the same type of TS into say a home or work desktop but the fact that files, apps, fonts, favorites can be accessed from anywhere and everywhere this ability is offered really challenges the idea of CPU based licensing if not turns it upside down.

I think CPU licensing is already in trouble due to the prevalence of multi-proc computers, processors in printers and displays. I think most modern licenses talk about users - and apart from rare cases where you have two or three people working with a font at the same time (maybe one on the left side of the keyboard, one on the right and one on the mouse) I think it's pretty bulletproof. </div>
