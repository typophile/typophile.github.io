body: "Not to start another Best Legible Didone thread, but: \r\n\r\nLooking for a
  substitute for Bodoni MT Book in a 170-year-old scholarly journal. As you know Bodoni
  (even MT Book) is not ideally legible in small print on white and slightly glossy
  paper. I was wondering about <a href=\"http://www.suitcasetype.com/page.php?lmut=en&section=font&font=teimer%20Std%20OT\">Teimer
  Antiqua</a>. Only thing that worries me is that it would have to be set even smaller,
  at least nominally (9?) if it isn't to take up too much space compared with MT Bodoni
  10/12, on 12 cm lines. And wide letterforms might otherwise produce awkward spacing
  or word division, and so on. \r\n\r\nI have also toyed with the usual distinguished
  substitutes, Storm's Walbaum, Hoefler's Didot, Licko's Filosofia, even Paperback
  from House Industries, which is actually an excellent didone, despite its understated
  name. Love them all but in each one my editorial board  finds something just too
  special for academic work (especially in the figures), or just too different from
  the usual face. Kepler, conversely, is certainly well crafted and well behaved but
  what's the use of having a didone if it looks so dull? (I admit I haven't actually
  seen a good print-out of it).\r\n\r\nOther tempting possibilities, with somewhat
  similar proportions and none of the offending peculiarities, but further removed
  : FB Whitman, FF Scala, Utopia.\r\n\r\nTeimer could make everyone happy, since it's
  actually even closer than Bodoni to the Didot we started off with in 1839. So does
  anyone here have any experience setting text in Teimer, or any further suggestions?
  Thanks in advance."

  body: "Yes, ITC is another one I tried: a serious possibility, but in 10 points,
    compared with MT book I find the 6 pt cut too wide and thick (fine for footnotes
    though), and the 12 pt a wee bit too narrow and contrasted...\r\n\r\nP.S. I should
    have mentioned my current favourite is Teimer's Antiqua <strong>Light</strong>
    (lower contrast than Regular).\r\n\r\nSorry again, Yves, and thanks for cleaning
    up the mess. (But editing does have one or two strange side-effects.) And as long
    as your photo keeps smiling, you can't sound too cross."

  body: "There's also Frutiger's Iridium. A didone built for photocomp (so it can
    handle digital). \r\n\r\nAny modern face is going to become unreadable below a
    certain pointsize. Is it necessary to have a modern, just because it's an old
    journal? Couldn't you switch to something more Scotch, which still looks \"olde
    fashioned\" but isn't so harsh? Look at some of the faces FontBureau have for
    newspaper setting. "

  body: "Carl, many thanks for Iridium, I had never looked at it closely, it really
    is interesting. Pity it lacks proper small caps, but very tempting all the same.\r\n\r\nActually
    I would like to find something reasonably close to a didone BUT more contemporary
    and legible, so as to lure the more traditional members of the board away from
    ye anciente looke without their even noticing. As you know, legibility/readability
    is difficult to explain, as soon as you mention it people start looking hard at
    the letters instead of just reading them. If I could choose off my own head, I
    would just as well go for something completely different, like say... Beorcana.
    Cheers!\r\n\r\nMarc"

    isn't in the top ten yet... maybe a further reason to try it out. Cheers.
