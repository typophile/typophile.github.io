    with the sans.

    machines.\r\n\r\nGeorgia is great, but it does look a bit weird on the page. When
    I get the page built, I will test out some different faces (including Lucida)."

    looks ok at text sizes. Here's a screenshot taken from Windows XP, cleartype turned

    about the spacing  is just more readable.\r\n\r\nThe only time I use Helvetica
    is for headers, or large point sizes."

  body: "True, most of the haters overlook the screen-hinting aspect of Arial - which
    is funny because the literature at the time focused on the hinting rather than
    the metric compatibility with Helvetica - suppose there were so many clones back
    then vying for attention that it didn't seem worth mentioning.\r\n\r\nAnyhow if
    it\u2019s being avoided for religious reasons surely \u201CHelvetica, Tahoma,
    sans-serif\u201D would work?\r\n"

    with Univers. I am looking at Arial and Lucida now. One of those will probably
    win.

    uses a PC on a regular basis.\r\n\r\nFWIW, most of the windows xp users i know
    have cleartype turned off anyway, so everything looks really pixelated. Under
    those conditions, arial actually looks better than most of the other options.
    I believe Vista has cleartype or its equivalent on by default."

  body: "Vista does indeed have Cleartype turned on by default, and in XP it is done
    by going into the appearance tab of the display properties dialog, and then clicking
    the 'Effects...' button and there's a dropdown box in there.\r\n\r\nThere are
    a huge host of fonts which render poorly without cleartype on at small or even
    text sizes, so when doing web work it needs constant checking because, as brendanm
    noted, most XP users wouldn't have a clue what cleartype was or how to turn it
    on.\r\n\r\n-Rafe"

  body: "99% of the people in the world cannot tell Univers from Helvetica. 99% of
    the of the same people probably couldn't tell Helvetica from Arial.\r\n\r\nAt
    body copy size, with Cleartype turned off, that means that most of the people
    in the entire world won't even notice if you use Univers, Helvetica, and Arial
    all in the same word, let alone the same page.\r\n\r\nSo if you're going to go
    sans, stay with Arial.\r\n\r\nAlthough... I like setting Lucida at 13 point, since
    that's the same size as the UI of the computer (XP and OS X. Sii? Correct me if
    I'm wrong.). \r\n\r\n"

    that Arial is not set too small by default. I know you cannot say that, but Arial
    set in 10px by default is too small.\r\nThere is another option, Verdana. Which
    reads and looks better in small sizes.\r\n\r\n"

  body: When you get down to that size all of the characteristics are squished down
    anyways. In that case, I'd say that Verdana always wins due to the nature of the
    beast.
