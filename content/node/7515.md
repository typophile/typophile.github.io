  my ultimate purpose I thought I&#39;d post this here. <BR>I&#39;m presently working
  on a research project which requires the design analysis of about 200-300 books.
  One of areas I&#39;m looking at is typography and I&#39;ve been looking for a simple
  way of classifying typefaces that is neither too general &#40;ie. plain ole serif,
  sans serif etc.&#41; nor too detailed &#40;down to the exact typeface&#41;.   <BR>The
  closest I&#39;ve come to something that would work for me is the system that classifies
  type under 11 different categories: Humanist, Garald, Transitional, Didone, Mechanistic,
  Lineal, Incised, Script, Manual, Black Letter and Non-Latin.  <BR>However, some
  of the books I&#39;m analysing have typewritten and handwritten elements. Now, I
  know these aren&#39;t &#39;typefaces&#39; but their intention is take on the role
  of a typeface - so it would be nice if there was a system that did account for these
  as well. <BR>Or is that asking for too much?! <BR>Any advice would be greatly appreciated.  <BR>

  body: Hello Rathna. What you&#39;ve described is the Vox system, but I bet you knew
    that already. Aren&#39;t you doing this through Uni of Reading? Have you talked
    to Eric Kindel? Perhaps he &#34;loan&#34; you his system that he worked up. I
    still wish they were producing that. You could also look at sites, such as <a
    href="http://myfonts.com/" target="_blank">http://myfonts.com/</a> to see how
    they are breaking things down.

  body: Hey Tiffany, <BR>I did check out the categories used by myfonts, fontshop
    etc. but they were a bit too &#39;creative&#39; for my task. I didn&#39;t realise
    Eric had his own system - many many thanks for that - I shall now go about nabbing
    him! <BR> <BR>R

  body: 'The topic of this thread is near and dear to my heart. I have struggled with
    trying to understand the &#39;classic&#39; classifying systems and have found
    that they are most useful when talking about text typefaces. After several years
    of frequenting font newsgroups what I found was that very few ID requests were
    ever concerned with text typefaces, and most display types that were not just
    super bold or compressed versions of text faces, defied any of the classical categories.
    What was more, the conventional &#40;classical&#41; systems did not agree always
    on terms, and were hardly equipped to deal with typefaces that were devised since
    those schemes were created, if they were not based on classical letterforms. In
    other words too many typefaces wouldn&#39;t fall in any categories that existed
    in the classification schemes that are usually described &#40;which by the way,
    do not all agree with each other either&#41;. <BR> <BR>My own answer has been
    to try to define type in categories that go in heirarchies, with the goal that
    special knowledge or training should not be necessary to use the system. The top
    grouping &#40;SuperGroup&#41; is based simply on how the type appears to have
    been created: either by hand &#40;Script in my broad definition&#41;, or with
    tools &#40;ruler, compass, calipers, etc.&#41;. The latter category includes almost
    all text type and many kinds of display type, but nothing that looks like it was
    hand-drawn, even if all the same tools were used to make it -- appearance is the
    key. <BR> <BR>The next tier is the main one for me, and it expresses the Style
    Group. There is a relevant mnemonic for this: F.A.C.E.S. = Formal, Artistic, Casual,
    Elegant and Strange.  Those of you familiar with my <a href="http://bowfinprintworks.com/ScriptIDGuide.html"
    target="_blank">Script Font ID Guide</a> will see how I have applied these Style
    Groups, and broken them down into Style Categories. That Guide essentially covers
    the whole Script SuperGroup. <BR> <BR>The other SuperGroup, which doesn&#39;t
    have a handy name &#40;Non-Script seems closest to my idea&#41;, has the same
    Style Groups &#40;F.A.C.E.S.&#41;, but will have different Style Categories &#40;
    I say &#39;will have&#39; because this is still taking shape&#41;: The Formal
    Style Group is lettering for extended text purposes. Categories within it will
    be based on serif type, including semi and sans. These will be the Roman forms  &#40;not
    italics&#41; and only in weights normally used in books, magazines  and newspaper
    text &#40;not headlines&#41;; The Artistic Style Group will include Geometric
    Types &#40;not meant to be text -- see the <a href="http://bowfinprintworks.com/BauhausFaces.html"
    target="_blank">Bauhaus-style Font ID Guide</a>&#41;, Very Heavy weights of Formal
    faces, Ethnic or Historic styles &#40;including Futuristic&#41; and other Display
    designs that do not look hand-drawn; Casual will be for the Italics of the Formal
    faces, as well as lettering that resembles Formal type, but has a more relaxed
    style that would make it unsuited for extended text; the Elegant Style Group would
    be the Ultra thin and very narrow versions of Formal Text faces, as well as Titling
    faces that are all-caps; the Strange Style Group would have grunge faces and other
    non-hand-drawn types with erratic letterforms and baselines. This would probably
    include experimental faces with marginal legibility. <BR> <BR>Within the Formal
    Non-Script faces I have already developed an identification aid &#40;<a href="http://bowfinprintworks.com/SansIDPage.html"
    target="_blank">Sans Serif Font ID Guide</a>&#41; for the Sans serif faces that
    is based on the configurations of 7 key letters. My Key for the Serif faces is
    still being developed, but the goal is to use a limited subset of characters and
    match the combinations of distinctive characteristics to rapidly narrow down the
    choices for the font. <BR> <BR>Sorry, for the endless response, but this seemed
    like the right time to spell out my own approach, for what it&#39;s worth.'
