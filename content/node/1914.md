  <BR> <BR>I&#39;ve spent hours trying to find a font with all the little serifs right,
  especially on the E, S, and R <BR> <BR>Thanks!

  body: Very similar, but the S doesn&#39;t get thinner at the ends and the middle
    part of the E isn&#39;t correct among other things. Thanks though

    <BR> <BR>They don&#39;t provide any more information about it, but it appears
    to match your sample. Looks like an old German face. No idea if it&#39;s available
    now. Perhaps they scanned it.'

  body: Whoa, you guys are amazing... seriously, amazing... <BR> <BR>I&#39;m almost
    positive they did not scan it because it appears in several different weights
    looking very sharp. If I can&#39;t find it soon, I&#39;ll try making a font out
    of Mark&#39;s scanned page. <BR> <BR>Thanks!

  body: Jameson, If you have a budget just hire Mark to create it for you. He&#39;d
    probably do a better job in half the time of you scanning Marks page. Dan
