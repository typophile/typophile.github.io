  body: Jimmy Buffet? There is a font called Margaritaville (http://www.fonts101.com/xt_fontdetails.asp?FID=7907),
    although it seems a bit more well-suited for a kids' coloring book than the king
    of casualness. Maybe Mistral? Or Hobo? Those fonts embody a laidback summer evening
    playing a saxophone in a lifeguard tower.
