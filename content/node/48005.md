body: "Hey Everyone,\r\n\r\nI'm looking for a font similar to the type Apple used
  for \"me\" in the <a href=\"http://www.apple.com/mobileme/\">Mobile Me</a> logo.
  Something scripty that looks handwritten, but still very clean and readable. Also,
  it's essential that the letters connect, because the text itself will be the word
  \"Connect.\" Thanks in advance!\r\n\r\nMatt\r\n\r\nEdit: Nevermind... since I know
  exactly what I'm going for I think I'm going to roll my own. Let me know if you
  want to see the end result.\r\n"

  body: "This may not get you very far, but if you are on, or can access a PC running
    Vista, one of the new fonts included there is called Segoe Script. It is in a
    very similar style and is built to connect, as well as use stylistic alternates
    by default, so your 2 n's would be different. \r\n\r\nMight save you some trouble;
    have you made a connecting handwriting typeface before?  ;)"
