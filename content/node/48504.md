    Gutenberg Bibles</strong></a> exhibition at the Morgan Library and Museum... It's
    on until September 28.\r\n\r\nAlso, you might want to check out some of the bookstores
    listed <a href=\"http://typophile.com/node/30036?\"><strong>here</strong></a>."

  body: "All I know is that they're moving to a new space, and will be opening soon.
    The first <a href=\"http://www.tdc.org/events/salon.html\"><strong>Type Salon</strong></a>
    will be in October, but that's not the same as an exhibition. The TDC usually
    has work on display, and in addition, you can visit their library during office
    hours. Just make sure you call or write in advance.\r\n\r\nThere is also the <a
    href=\"http://www.underconsideration.com/speakup/archives/004949.html\"><strong>Herb
    Lubalin Study Center of Design and Typography</strong></a>, which is located within
    Cooper Union. You can probably arrange a visit there, too, if you call in advance.\r\n\r\nOne
    more place you can try is the <a href=\"http://www.centerforbookarts.org/\"><strong>New
    York Center for Book Arts</strong></a>."
