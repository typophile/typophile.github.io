    imagery, sounds and motion all complement each other very nicely.  I was very
    happy that the snatched up words actually had a point to being taken away.\r\n\r\nBad:
    Please, please, please don't use Google images.  That is stealing, even if it
    is only for a student project.  I'm not sure exactly what images you used, but
    most schools have academic access for collections such as Getty and the like.
    \ If you try to use this project in your portfolio after graduation, someone might
    get a little irritated.\r\n\r\nI was also a little jarred by the bright color
    of the legal pad paper at the end.\r\n\r\nOther than that, great work!"
