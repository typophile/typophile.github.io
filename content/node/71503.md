body: "Good evening/morning,\r\n\r\nI'm drawing an italic to accompany an old-style
  face (drafts <a href=\"http://typophile.com/node/70139\">here</a> and <a href=\"http://aldusleaf.org/specimen.pdf\">here</a>),
  and slanting + cursify-ing the Roman just doesn't do. My <em>o</em> looks like an
  easter egg.\r\n\r\nApart from <a href=\"http://typophile.com/node/13743#comment-79043\">this
  wonderful comment</a>, I couldn't find any specific tips on how to do optical correction;
  neither here nor via Google (Books). So here's the newbie asking for your help:\r\n\r\n<strong>1.</strong>
  How do you \"push out\" and \"pull in\" curves, e.g. in <em>o</em>, <em>c</em>,
  and <em>e</em>, without ruining the slant, to make round curves round again? Do
  you, to be precise, just shift control points back and forth til' you're happy?
  Is there a mathematical function of angle, thickness and contrast factor? \u2014
  Or could I establish such a thing and become rich?\r\n\r\n<strong>2.</strong> What
  are good guidelines for slant variation? My <em>f</em> seems like it's tipping over.
  Again, I can't find numbers, and I don't completely trust my eyes (yet). Then again,
  I personally dislike the un-slanted capitals in Arrighi- and Granjon-inspired fonts.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately
  \u2013 I'm an engineering student, not a designer \u2013 I don't own any literature;
  and the few fonts I've looked at failed at teaching me an efficient way of consistent
  correction.* \r\n\r\n(Recommendations are more than welcome though, there are libraries
  after all.)\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nOne other, unrelated question to the book designers
  here:\r\n\r\n<strong>3.</strong> Bringhurst \xA75.3.2 recommends, among other things,
  upright parentheses in italic text. While I don't disagree with the look of it,
  I was surprised at the very least. Is this normal practice?\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\nSebastian\r\n\r\n\r\n*
  I'd open the Roman, slant it, paste it onto the italics and look at the differences."

  body: "<cite>It is the best practice when an italic word/phrase within a paragraph
    of roman text is parenthesized.</cite>\r\n\r\nMost publishing houses have style
    guides regarding this. There are a handful of schemes, usually referencing either
    the surrounding text or the enclosed text, then sometimes adding specific guidance
    regarding mixed styles.\r\n\r\nNick describes a circumstance where the style of
    parentheses follows the surrounding text regardless of the nature of the enclosed
    text. This approach certainly has many adherents. I believe this is more or less
    <em>Chicago Manual of Style</em>\u2019s current practice. \r\n\r\nBut Bringhurst\u2019s
    rule is advocating something slightly different \u2014 <em>always upright, regardless
    of context </em>(<em>surrounding or contained matter</em>)<em>, even if all italic,
    like so.</em> \r\n\r\nBringhurst\u2019s own sidenote explains \u201CThis rule
    has been broken  more often than followed since the end of the 16th century.\u201D
    It is worth noting that the period prior, when this \u2018rule\u2019 was more
    often <em>followed</em>, is also a period wherein the capitals used with italic
    are still largely upright as well.\r\n\r\nI\u2019m not arguing that one should
    or should not employ this approach. The point of my terse reply to the third point
    in the initial post is simply that this strict approach is not what most compositors
    would consider \u201Cnormal\u201D practice today.\r\n\r\n"

    this is where you would likely run into the problem Metafont has. Sure you can
    do it all with math, but then the font designers also need to be mathematicians,
    and people who can be both are rare."

    getting the initial weight and condensation correct, get the slant by doing half
    of it via obliquing and the other half by rotation. One catch on the rotation
    is that it affects the height, so you still can't get away without doing at least
    a few manual corrections.\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\nT"

    that the Harmonizer does not modify the shape as a matter of principle. How much
    a glyph gets modified glyph depends entirely on the deviation from the required

    extreme slanting, or if there are too many additional (diagonal) control points

  body: Nick, the RMX Slanter and Tuner only correct nodes that connect two curves,
    not connections of straight line and curve like in your example. In that case,
    would you simply add nodes at the extremes? That can be done with FontLab's built-in
    tools. Or, would you maintain the orthogonal extrema by converting the straight
    to a curve and then adjusting everything? This would be a bit complicated, I am
    afraid, and it involves design decisions. The Slanter, like all RMX tools at the
    moment, does not insert nodes or change the node structure. Not treating the outline
    is the only sensible thing I can think of in the above example - do you have an
    idea for a better behaviour of the tool?

    as advertised. Thanks for the personal attention in this matter."
