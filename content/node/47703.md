  about TypeCon on the front page of the arts section. It has it's assortment of font
  jokes, several quotes from Shelley Gruendler and Erik Spiekermann and I think it
  gave a pretty good impression of the conference.\r\n\r\n"

    would snag a copy or two of today's Arts & Life section for me. It'd be great
    to have something for the SOTA archives.\r\n\r\nIf anyone is willing to send a
    copy, let me know.\r\n\r\n-- Kent.\r\n\r\n"

    denim and plop haircuts.\"\r\n\r\nCan't blame them; there's a disproportionately
    high number of photos of him on Flickr tagged under typecon."
