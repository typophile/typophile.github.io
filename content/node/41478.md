body: "One thing I find funny, (without being funny at all) is that there few typeface
  designers who can actually achieve good work with their own created typefaces. I
  mean the graphic design part...\r\nTypeface designers produce an essential tool
  for graphic and editorial design, but the work they produce in those areas is far
  from having the same kind of quality that they achieve with their \"glyphs\".\r\nWhat
  I can actually find is some good text composing and good editorial details or very
  well written essays... but as for web and graphic... well, that's another story...\r\n
  \r\nIs this just an impression? Am I being unfair?"

    and architecture. Most architects suck at Web Design. Most Web Designers suck
    at Fashion design... ;o)\r\n\r\nI think we assume all to often that 'design' is
    some universal skill that applies easily to any medium, which isn't always the
    case."

  body: "Maybe I wasn\xB4t clear enough... I didn\xB4t mean to as radical as graphic
    design vs architecture (and I believe that an architect IS a designer, either
    they like it or not, and designers aren\xB4t frustrated architects as many people
    think... but that's another issue). What I wanted to point out is that typography
    is complex and in order to draw typefaces, the designer needs to have some knowledge
    on editorial design, text composing, format, layout... in order to achieve a certain
    goal of drawing a specific typeface for a specific usage, and consider perceptual
    issues and \"laws\" of graphic design. It reminds me of using wonderfully designed
    stones and build a horrible house with it... or play tecno with a gibson guitar...\r\n\r\nIt
    doesn\xB4t sound right.... of course there are remakable examples of good layout,
    but sometimes I get really disapointed."

  body: "Do you know many graphic designers doing typefaces of the quality of the
    ones from H&FJ as example?\r\n\r\nA typeface designer draw more, think about forms,
    counters, in a human sense, a graphic designer do that but also play with concepts,
    meanings, etc. Indeed booth do the same, but not at the same proportion in their
    everyday job.\r\n\r\nThis is particularly true for students: you can have a great
    student in use of typography but suddenly very bad in typeface design, when the
    student from Illustration section is very good in typeface design. Clearly not
    the same skills.\r\n\r\nBut this sort of \"Rules\" can't be true for all, Erik
    Speikermann is the best example of a great designer for everything, even if for
    typeface design, he always point out that he is bad when its time to finish or
    expand an idea."

  body: "seml...I guess I'd argue that typeface design is as unique a design discipline
    as is graphic design or architecture design. People that get really good at one
    particular aspect of design tend to focus solely on that one aspect/medium. \r\n\r\nA
    heart surgeon and a dermatologist are both doctors, but they really live in their
    own subset worlds of medicine."
