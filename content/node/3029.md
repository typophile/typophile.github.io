  body: Adriano,  <BR> <BR>The w looks like T-26 <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/t26/euphoric/"
    target="_blank">Euphoric</a>, but many letters look quite different. I haven&#39;t
    seen anything that matches all of these letters. Can we suspect a &#39;manufactured&#39;
    or mixed font?

  body: There is a small foundry which always comes to mind for modular <BR>techno
    fonts like these. I always forget to bookmark it and now have <BR>forgotten the
    name. <BR> <BR>Perhaps somebody will recognize it from a description. It&#39;s
    done, as <BR>I recall, entirely in black and white. The fonts are organized by
    year, <BR>with all of the fonts for a chosen year loading &#40;too slowly&#41;
    in small <BR>flash samples stacked one above the other toward the right side of
    <BR>the page. Some free fonts, mostly pay fonts. <BR> <BR>Ring any bells? <BR><br>
