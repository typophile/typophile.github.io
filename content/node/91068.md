  working on a mac OS10.2 with CS5.\r\nThe bold font has true small caps and the relative
  heights can be edited in 'preferences'.\r\nHowever the regular and semibold weights
  only seem to have 'all small caps', but not 'small caps' \u2013 When using the 'small
  caps' function the result is a large 'first cap' letter which is uneditible as a
  relative size to the rest of the 'small cap' letters in the word.\r\nI have read
  several web forums and Adobe info, but nothing is particularly clear to me.\r\nIf
  this is just the way of things with this font, so be it.\r\nThe only practical workaround
  seems to be in using an alternative compatable Caslon that has small caps.\r\nIs
  this the best way to go? Any advice?\r\n "

    Caslon, you might consider\r\ncommissioning the customization to fill in the missing\r\npieces.
    Adobe is rare among font houses in being highly\r\nliberal concerning modifications,
    and there are a number\r\nof people here who could do it for you. Including yours\r\ntruly!

  body: "Of the 6 fonts in Adobe Caslon Pro only the regular and semi-bold have true
    small caps. Neither the bold nor any of the italics have true small caps. You
    can verify this by [[http://store1.adobe.com/cfusion/store/html/index.cfm?store=OLS-US&event=displayFontPackage&code=1712|clicking
    on the individual fonts here.]] Also I checked by opening the fonts in Font Lab.
    \r\n\r\nSo I think what is happening is that you are getting fake small caps for
    the Bold, as you would for any of the italics, small caps that are constructed
    by InDesign by formula from the caps. And what you are controlling for is the
    size of fake small caps. InDesign defaults to the real small caps when they are
    present in the font. Real small caps are not adjustable\u2014but they will look
    better than fake small caps. \r\n\r\nWhen you click on 'small caps' in Indesign
    you are only *supposed* to change lower case into small caps. To get all small
    caps open the character dialogue box, hit the top right corner, then choose \"open
    type\", then choose \"all small caps\". That will turn both caps and lower case
    into small caps. Then you will get real all small caps in Adobe Caslon Regular
    and Semi-Bold, but not the four other styles. \r\n\r\nIf you want true small caps
    for a Caslon italic, check out [[http://www.fontbureau.com/fonts/WilliamsCaslonText/|this
    version of Caslon]]. I think both the roman and italic are better in text than
    Adobe Caslon, but I'm a biased source.  \r\n\r\n "

    that the natural form of the 'small caps' for Reg and SB has a proportionally
    large initial cap ... was expecting it to be less so. Open type 'all small caps'
    was being used in my document hierarchy, but was just looking to add something
    a little more 'busy'. Will continue working within the font set and see how it
    goes.\r\nChecked out Williams Caslon \u2013 an elegant cut. YES, VERY BIASED!\r\n\r\nHrant
    \u2013 thanks. I rarely link to typophile ... only when desperate. I always smile,
    seeing your inciteful words in whatever forum I end up in. "

    are a few fonts* with two or more sets of small caps ( usually Regular and Petite),
