body: "I'm trying to generate a font so I can layout a decent proofing sheet. Two
  problems:\r\n\r\nI am able to generate a Win TrueType/OpenType TT file, but when
  I try OpenType PS, it gives me this message: \"ERROR: There was a problem while
  compiling OpenType font. Final .otf font is not saved. Please, check OpenType features
  definition for errors.\" Does anyone know what this is referring to? I looked through
  the fonts features panel, but didn't see any red flags. Feel like I'm missing something
  on how to preflight these files before generating.\r\n\r\nAlso, when I use the Win
  TrueType/OpenType TT file in InDesign, the small capitals and old style numerals
  are not accessible through InDesign's OpenType menu, however, I can access them
  in the Glyphs window. What steps need to be taken to create files that work seamlessly
  with InDesign\r\n\r\nAny help or direction would be greatly appreciated. Thank you."

  body: Your "Also" suggests that your Opentype features indeed do not work. Although
    it's a mystery why your font <em>does</em> compile without errors as OTF TT file
    but not as OTF Type 1. (Which begs the question, by the way, why you are doing
    that?)

    it is only one gefuched feature -- always risky -- there is a faster way than
    one at a time. Dump half of them. If that complies, try the other half. Keep splitting
    in halves. You'll find the bad one a lot quicker this way."

    set of classes and (2) a set of instructions as to what to do with the classes.
    You can put both in the features file, or you can use the classes file to \"define\"
    them. I prefer to have everything in the features file. In fact, I prefer to have
    that file written off so as to be able to use a text editor on it.\r\n\r\nYou
    might have to read the manual...\r\n"

      finding where to start with that though. This helps a great deal though. It
      looks like they start dealing with this topic on page 833. My plan is to use
      the manual and some other font's code as reference to move forward with this.
      Thanks so much."

    body: Thanks for this. I've downloaded it and am figuring it out. Seems to be
      a bit ahead of where I am in the process, but I can see it being useful down
      the road. Right now, I'm still troubleshooting and learning how to correctly
      code the OpenType features.
