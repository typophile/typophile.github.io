  been digitized, and usually ampersands like this only appear in the italic set of
  typefaces.  I will say that when I see this out in the world, it is usually with
  a title face that looks like Bodoni Poster Compressed but I'll keep my reservations.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/peoples-birds-ampersand_3810.gif]"
