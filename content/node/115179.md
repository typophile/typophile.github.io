  body: Looks a bit distorted and fuzzy, can't see details. To me, same vein as [[http://www.myfonts.com/search/Din|DIN]]
    but don't think that's it (main concern on /a). What's your sample origin? That
    could make the search easier (PDF, website...).

    PDF</a> and it\u2019s FF DIN."

  body: Thanks R. for finding the PDF resource. Hadn't taken the time to search for
    it. This sample was heavily distorted... Luckily I was not so far from the answer.
