body: Hi all! I need help understanding how you are meant to use one san serif font
  with another san serif or serif? I tend to use them in families i.e. for headline
  I may use Gill Sans and for the bodycopy, i might use Gill Sans Light or Helvetica
  for headline and Helvetica Nue or Helvetica Neue Light for bodycopy etc but how
  do I use another typeface instead of choosing from the same family. Please help
  and how am I meant to understand how to use a serif font with a san serif. Please
  show me examples. Thanks :)

    like Quadraat and Quadraat Sans, etc. Have a look at <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/features/newsletters/jun2006_b/\">this
    article</a>. \r\n\r\nAside from that, you have to exercise your artistic and typographic
    sensibilities and pick a pair that work well and look good together."
