  on this, however about a week ago my hard drive failed. Anyway, I am trying to catch
  back up on it now. Here is the lower- and uppercase. Numerals, punctuation, and
  ligatures will be here extremely soon.\r\n\r\nI started a font earlier called <a
  href=\"http://typophile.com/node/63834\">Recut</a>. It wasn't that great but I learned
  how to use Fontforge. I took a couple months break from font-making, and now I've
  got a new serif that's hopefully better.\r\n\r\nTell me your thoughts and criticisms!\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Screenshot-1.png]"

  body: "Much better than your previous font.  Here are my amateur critiques, to be
    taken with a grain of salt:\r\n\r\nThe bottom serifs of A and X make them look
    pigeontoed, and the same effect plagues the top serifs of W, X, and Y.  X also
    seems kind of wide.  I'm not crazy about the middle join on the K or the \"shelf\"
    of the G (what is that thing called, anyway?).  The right side of the bottom serif
    of F has a bracket; I see that rounded feature elsewhere in the font but not on
    any other serif (P, for example).  Speaking of which, I quite like your P.\r\n\r\nIt
    would be nice to see some sample words.  On the whole, it looks really promising.
    \ Keep it up."

  body: "@aric, You may be right about the serifs on diagonal letters. My thought
    was that it would lessen the big gap those characters tend to create.\r\n\r\nI'm
    not crazy about the K join, or G stem serif either... In fact I had a lot of trouble
    with both letters. The G seems almost right though. When I made the F I couldn't
    get it to look right without the bracketing. My thoughts was that it's a bit like
    it's friends E and L.\r\n\r\n(The word samples are on the first post - I can't
    seem to find how to add images here.)"

  body: You've made a lot of good progress; the join of the K is much improved.  You
    should probably make the leg of the K extend slightly farther than the arm.  You'll
    have to experiment to see whether the best way to accomplish that is to nudge
    the leg outward or the arm inward (or some of both).

    considerably wider than the rest of the characters.\r\n\r\n- The \"M\" feels quite
    a bit heavier than the others (thicker strokes, that is)\r\n\r\n- The joins on
    the \"L\" and \"E\" (bottom left) seem very heavy. I can't tell if it's because
    of the stem or just the join.\r\n\r\nWould you consider tracking out your next
    specimen a little bit? It will allow for a critique of a slightly more \"realistic\"
    setting of all caps.\r\n\r\nHope this helps. Keep up the great work!"

    Also, the left single quote is awkward in the setting. Seems like it should be
    mirrored along the vertical axis. The tail of the 'y' is also heavy. I wonder
    if the ear of the 'g' could gain some weight.

    but I like the way it's drawn.\r\n\r\n/s/ is too narrow.\r\n\r\nThe little bit
    at the northeast corner of /q/ is too indecisive - either forget that little flip,
    or make it more prominent.\r\n\r\n/z/ looks a little topheavy to me.\r\n\r\nThe
    way the diagonal at the top of the left side of the /f/ crossbar goes much higher
    than where the crossbar comes out on the other side of the stem looks a little
    odd to me.\r\n\r\nThe vertical of /G/ seems short; that is, the crossbar seems
    low. \r\n\r\n/4/'s \"descender\" vertical is too long; that is, its horizontal
    should be lower.\r\n\r\nCould /V/ and /v/ be a little wider?\r\n\r\nI like the
