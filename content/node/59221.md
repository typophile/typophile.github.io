body: "I'm working on some packaging and was using Banque Gothique (BoldExCond) for
  some elements and the client just isn't feeling it.. The specific issue stated was
  the 'rounded corners.'\r\n\r\nBasically, I'd like any suggestions you guys may have
  as I feel like I've gotten into a bit of a rut, idea-wise..  Something with similar
  weight, vintage appeal is a plus, and it has to look good going around a circular
  path. \r\n\r\nThe other display type being used is Block Gothic, the text face right
  now is Gothic 720 but that could change to suit whatever replaces Banque. So, older/older
  looking faces with sign/wood type feel are preferred but not required.\r\n\r\nRight
  now I'm liking LHF Old Block, Powerstation Solid, a modified version of Borgstrand,
  and maybe even just customizing Banque.\r\n\r\nScreenshot:\r\n\r\nBanque Gothique:

  replacing)"
