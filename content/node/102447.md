body: "I wonder how <em>Roboto</em> should be classified. Is it a grotesk, a geometric
  sans serif, a humanist sans serif? In any case it is a lineal sans serif, but I
  am wondering about the contextual category.\r\n\r\nIf you ask me, it\u2019s a hybrid,
  with classicist grotesk (lowercase a and as, and uppercase S, C, G) with elements
  of a humanist sans serif (lowercase e, g, etc.). What do you think?\r\n\r\nhttp://www.fontsquirrel.com/fonts/roboto"

    couple of weeks ago, but I didn\u2019t know the source and couldn\u2019t find
    it.\r\n\r\nWith what exactly don\u2019t you agree, the harsh judgement of its
    author, my comments above, or the ugliness (or beauty) of Roboto?"

  body: "Well, one thing I don't agree with is obsessing over classification. :-)
    \ But mostly -like I said in my Typographica comment- when I see it on my Galaxy
    Note 2 it just works - at least in that context. Hunting down \"historical impurity\"
    is for inquisitionists. Everything is hybrid.\r\n\r\nThere's also something quite
    awesome about Roboto: it's under the Apache license, not OFL; the former allows
    the selling of modifications. In the end this means more designers can justify
    helping more people.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "I posted it in context of my own work on Hikari and criticism my announcement
    received, about it being a \u201Cneo grot\u201D. I found it refreshing and interesting
    that other designers are not caring too much about classification and more about
    design principles they apply, a result of research and conclusions they draw while
    examining the environment where their fonts will be used. I find this approach
    similar to my own goals, as I am designing Hikari for screen applications and
    not just for print. I have even thought about a user interface version for mobile
    devices."
