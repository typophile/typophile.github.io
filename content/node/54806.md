body: This was a sketchbook assignment my design professor had us do. We had to pick
  a letter and create a composition using 20 different forms of the letter and 20
  images that started with the letter that we chose. I obviously chose the letter
  S mainly because it had so my different choices as far as imagery goes. There wasn't
  any specific inspiration to my composition.I arranged it a couple of times before
  I pasted it into my sketchbook to see which composition I liked the most. This is
  the one I chose. I really like the scale of the images and letters that I chose.See
  if you can figure out what word is used for each image. One of the images that I
  chose has more than one "S" word tied onto it. Oh, and sorry about the size, that
  is the biggest I could do. Enjoy! [img:sites/default/files/old-images/Untitled-2_6487.jpg]
