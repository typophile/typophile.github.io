body: "Hi,\r\n\r\nI am looking for recommendations for a good script or calligraphy
  or handwriting font.\r\n\r\nA type that is interesting and personal yet legible
  and clear. Nothing too formal or ornate like something that would be used for a
  wedding invitation. The primary use will be for my name at the top of my resume
  and on my website. (I don't want it to look like it is actually my signature but
  hope that it projects some individuality.) The other font that I am using on the
  resume is Gill Sans and the other font that I am using on the website is LTC Twentieth
  Century Medium.\r\n\r\nAny suggestions would be very much appreciated!!! Thanks:)"

    browsing through myfonts.com might be a good start. Here are a few I saw that
    have some calligraphic roots, but also are handwriting influenced. The font Nothing

    fell in love with that old New England folk stuff years ago. Montague is name

    dart shot with a standard dart at a standard dart target in the dark of a moonless
    night, underwater, in one of those old diving bells and heavy suits, in the midst
    a school of medium-sized squid, arguably perhaps, wouldn't one? :)\r\n\r\nCheers!"

    it when I see it. You know it when you see it. We each know it when we see it.
    No argument there. The question is, how many questions does it take to see it
    for someone else. I think the number is greater than zero, while our local script
    shriekers think otherwise. (Or call a blue whale, I think).\r\n\r\nCheers!"

    Do you know if it is available for purchase?\r\n\r\nThere're so many great options

    going to be choosing two or three different fonts now (one for the resume, one
