  searching for the fontface that is featured on Martha Stewart's new magazine called
  BLUEPRINT.  I really want to find this font or one similiar to it, to use on my
  wedding announcement.  Does anyone have any suggestions?  I am not really a font
  expert, I just saw this type treatment and fell in love with it, and I think it
  would be perfect my a wedding announcement.\r\n\r\n\r\nI would appreciate if you
  had any suggestions for a similiar font, or any other typeface that would be great
  on a wedding announcement!\r\n\r\nTHANK YOU!\r\n\r\n\r\nbrice\r\n\r\n"

    Both are lovely faces, but why they use two different upright scripts I cannot
    explain.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/bryce1.png]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/bryce2.png]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/brice.png]"

  body: Could anyone ID a second font in Martha's premiere issue of Blueprint.  It
    is an open font with frills. She also uses swashes in the magazine that look as
    though they are from the same font family.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/font_4954][img:sites/default/files/old-images/font2_5101]

  body: hmmm...I'd be very interested to find out too. The screened-back typeface
    (in white) from Yagra's photos has these nice flourshes but not found on Fling.
    If it's added on, what typeface could it be?

    body: Thank you Miss Tiffany for your astute identification of this obscure font.  I
      had tried other sources, who even had the Emgire catalog, without success.  The
      ornament (below), included with the font, will be useful text adornment.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Blueprintpage_4583.jpg]

    you set it.

    so good in the right context.
