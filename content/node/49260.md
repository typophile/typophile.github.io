  body: United Serif Condensed from House Industries is very close if not the actual
    font.

  body: Yes, thank you. It's very similiar indeed, though the R is a bit different.
    I am still interested in knowing the actual font used!

  body: This is actually an old Fontalicious font called Academy. It hasn't been available
    for a while and I don't know where you can find it currently. Font Bros. has been
    re-releasing the Fontalicious fonts, but apparently haven't got to this one yet.

  body: Ah, yes. Same thing. I think the name was changed to avoid confusion with
    Academy Engraved.
