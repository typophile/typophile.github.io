  body: Funny, I think they are using <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/singles/monotype/plantin_schoolbook/">Plantin
    Schoolbook</a> and phonetic characters perhaps found in a predigital version of
    the font. You can also find similar glyphs in <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/singles/monotype/bembo_pro_semi_bold/">Bembo
    Pro</a> and <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/monotype/bembo_infant_std_vp/">Bembo
    Infant</a>.
