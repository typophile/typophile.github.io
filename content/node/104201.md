  Pen</a></strong>, the latest addition to the Sudtipos library.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/tumblr_inline_mp14i8gVyk1qz4rgp_4752.gif]\r\n\r\n\r\n<strong><a
  href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/sudtipos/rolling-pen/?refby=alepaul\">Rolling
  Pen</a></strong>. A new typeface by Ale Paul.\r\n\r\nAfter doing this for so many
  years, one would think my fascination with the old history of writing would have
  mellowed out by now. The truth is that alongside being a calligraphy history buff,
  I'm a pop technology freak. Maybe even keener on the tech thing, since I just can't
  seem to get enough new gadgets. And after working with type technologies for so
  many years, I'm starting to think that writing and design technologies as we now
  know them \u2014 we and now being about 2.5 post-computer generations \u2014 keep
  becoming more and more detached from what the very old humanity arts/tasks they
  essentially want to facilitate. In a world where command-z is a frequently used
  key combination, it's difficult to justify expecting a Morris-made book or a Zaner-drawn
  sentence, but accidental artistic \"mutations\" become welcome, marketable features.
  When fluid pens were introduced, their liquid saturation influenced type design
  to a great extent almost overnight \u2014 an influence professional designers tend
  to play down. Now round stroke endings are a common sight, and the saturation is
  so clean and measured, unlike any liquid-paper relationship possible in reality.
  Some designers even illustrate their work by overlaying perfect circles at stroke
  ends, in order to illustrate how \"geometric\" their work was. Because if it's measured
  with precise geometry, it's got to be meaningful design.\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/typophilerolling_6177.png]\r\n\r\nAnd
  once in a while, by a total freak accident, the now-cherished mutations prove to
  have existed long before the technology that caused them. <strong><a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/sudtipos/rolling-pen/?refby=alepaul\">Rolling
  Pen</a></strong> was cued by just such a thing: A rounded, circular, roll-flowing
  calligraphy from the late nineteenth century \u2014 seemingly one of those experimental
  takes on what inspired Business Penmanship, another font of mine. Looking at it
  now it certainly seems to be friendlier, more legible, and maybe even more practical
  and easier to execute than the standard business penmanship of those days, but I
  guess friendliness and simplicity were at odds with the stiff manner business  liked
  to present itself back then, so that kind of thing remained buried in the professional
  penman's oddities drawer. It would be quite a few years before all this curviness
  and rounding were thought of as symbolic of graceful movement, which brought such
  a flow closer to the idea of fine art.\r\n\r\nEven though in this case the accidental
  mutation just happens to not be a mutation after all, the whole technology-transforms-application
  argument still applies here. I'm almost sure \"business\" will be the last thing
  on people's minds when they use this font today. One extreme example of that level
  of disconnect between origin and current application is shown here, with the so-called
  business penmanship strutting around in gloss and neon.\r\n\r\n<strong><a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/sudtipos/rolling-pen/?refby=alepaul\">Rolling
  Pen</a></strong> is another cup of mine that runneth over with alternates, swashes,
  ligatures, and other techy perks. To explore its full potential, please use it in
  a program that supports OpenType features for advanced typography.\r\n\r\n________________________________________________________\r\n\r\n<strong><a

  Visual poetry by Tom\xE1s Garc\xEDa.\r\n\r\nTomas' approach on the reveal of Rolling
  Pen is inspired on the enlightenment given by neon lights in the dark, through the
  power of words.\r\nThe neon lights were originally created to conceptually narrate
  over darkness. That's why the collection has been coined \"Underlight\"; a way to
  represent light in neon form as the underliner of something important through light.\r\nTo
  embody this, he selected different words that enforce the eternal misbalance between
  darkness and lights, and that serve as a metaphor to narrate and reinforce the Concept.\r\n\r\nFire,
  Breast, Silence, Forget, & Happiness\r\nFire as energy, Breasts as diversity in
  birth, Silence as in the silent individual, Forget as evolution given by forgetfulness
  and Happiness, not as a goal, or achievement, but as a result of our lives, where
  light or dark don't particularly prevail.\r\n\r\n<strong><a href=\"http://www.behance.net/gallery/Rolling-Pen-Underlight/9417861?fb_action_ids=10151677242915306&fb_action_types=og.likes&fb_source=aggregation&fb_aggregation_id=288381481237582\">Underlight</a></strong>
  is a poetry inspired by the battle between light and dark, struggling to generate
  a Concept.\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/tumblr_inline_mp18pkhOwj1qz4rgp_6359.gif]\r\n\r\n________________________________________________________\r\n\r\n\r\nMore

  body: "Very cool, Ale! Love the neon presentation, too.\r\n\r\nIf you don't mind
    my asking, I'm assuming you drew the font as open paths and then stroked it to
    get outlines? If so, what software did you use for the stroking?  I'm also working
    on a stroked-path font at the moment (<a href=\"http://typophile.com/node/103594\">here</a>),
    but I'm having lots of trouble finding a good stroking application. \r\n\r\nDid
    you do any optical corrections afterwards? Or manually add some contrast?"
