		<div class="commentbody">If you want specimens of old American typefaces, Dan X. Solo&rsquo;s Alphabets series, as published by Dover, are a great supplement to the foundry specimen books. He started to digitize some of these but the project seems to have ended a decade ago. Many font-makers mine his books for alphabets to digitize. There is also an online encyclopedia of his Solo Catalog, called the Solopedia,  which is an first class finder&rsquo;s guide to digital fonts based on the fonts mentioned in the Solo catalog, including digitizations based on other sources. <a href="http://abfonts.freehostia.com/solopedia/">http://abfonts.freehostia.com/solopedia/</a>

The font information on Emerge BF says that it was inspired by Admiral from the Keystone Type Foundry. Here is a sample of the original Admiral from Keystone&rsquo;s specimen book of 1906.
[img:sites/default/files/old-images/AdmiralKeystone1906SM1_4739.jpg][img:sites/default/files/old-images/AdmiralKeystone1906SM2_6428.jpg]
There is a faithful, but unpolished, recreation of Admiral in the free font AdmiralDavyJones. Available at <a href="http://abfonts.freehostia.com/">http://abfonts.freehostia.com/</a> Follow the link in the third paragraph to the &ldquo;list of all fonts&rdquo; then find &ldquo;Admiral Davy Jones&rdquo; on the Alphabetical list and click on the entry &ldquo;Admiral Davy Jones&rdquo; for the font and descriptive information. Also enjoy the tongue in cheek history of the font.

Serifs in the &ldquo;Latin&rdquo; [triangular] style, broad pen nib terminals, the height of font fashion for the era.
&mdash; end quote &mdash;
The phrase &ldquo;the height of font fashion for the era&rdquo; refers mainly to &ldquo;broad pen nib terminals.&rdquo; In the sample, note the terminals on the letters <em>E</em>, <em>F</em>, <em>S</em> and <em>T</em>, although the comment includes fonts which have both these terminals and Latin serifs. Regret any confusion. I probably should have expressed the idea more clearly.

		<div class="commentbody">Thanks for clarifying. I was just curious how you (or anyone) discovers what the fashion in fonts is for an era. I found the book &ldquo;Graphic Design Before Graphic Designers&rdquo; and found it helpful, and I&rsquo;m sure there are similar books. Ideally, I&rsquo;d find a list of &ldquo;most popular fonts&rdquo; for each decade for, say, the USA. I imagine the most accurate approach is to just look at many samples from the period.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I agree the best way is try and find fonts in use. An academic looking for a research project could go though the advertising in magazines, leaflets etc for the era and compile a data base what were used most frequently year by year. A rather time consuming project requiring some familiarity with the fonts available. AFAIK nobody has yet attempted this. The usual way to do this would be for a prof to put his students on the task and publish the results under the prof&rsquo;s name. 
The foundry specimen books can be misleading. Many fonts were offered but few became popular. The main use of these books is to identify fonts that were offered for many years &ndash; popularity in terms of duration if not necessarily in terms of extent of use.

		<div class="commentbody">I suppose one use of the specimen books as a measure of popularity of a typeface is to look at the degree to which &ldquo;me too&rdquo; typefaces were created.
Designs that were popular with customers were quickly mimicked by very similar fonts from competitors. Not identical but the same fashion features.
Takes some judgement and digging to find these, but they are a good index of popularity. A good job for an academic with some money to spend and a publication credit to get. For example look at 1890s ATF fonts, then at the creations of Inland and BB&amp;S. Tantalizing info.

<p>Have you ever seen body text (which I hope means text other than headlines) from that time period that was in some font other than something that looked really similar to Times New Roman, such as a sans serif?</p>

If you look in the old specimen books you will see a section of smaller scale type which is for body text. Some are very different from Times. For example check Ronaldson with its big sweeping terminals on letters such a E,R, L and S. Or French Old Style, Lightface etc. Off hand, I don&rsquo;t recall any sans-serif for use as a body text. This is not to say that a sans-serif was not offered for that purpose.

<p>I like that Ronaldson is different and was described as being the &ldquo;best selling&rdquo; in the 1900s at Myfonts. I imagine most folks who aren&rsquo;t into graphic design just wouldn&rsquo;t notice much of a difference between it and other transitional or old-style typefaces.</p>
