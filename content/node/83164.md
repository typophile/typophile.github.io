  body: "OK Here is a Bigger image... This font is very similar to Bernard MT Condensed
    but it is not. I had it on my Mac at one point but my hard drive failed and now
    i can remember the name or where i got  it. I would love to repurchase it if i
    only had the name. The reason i know the erosion is NOT aftermarket is because
    i created this image and used no effects such as erosion...[img:sites/default/files/old-images/font3_6155.png]\r\n\r\nNotice
    the effect on the \"O\" and \"R\" they are in the exact same place....\r\nThanks
    again...."
