body: "Mrs. Eaves is a great font. However I have a client who doesn\u2019t see it
  that way. I am looking for an alternative with a taller x-height and possibly a
  bit more condensed. Mrs. Eaves has some very nice and sensitively designed letter
  forms like the lowercase u, m, etc. The criteria is an easy-to-read, approachable,
  friendly, warm, smart but non-intimidating atypical font.\r\n\r\nFonts I have eliminated:\r\nAtma\r\nBaskerville
  (all versions)\r\nDeepdene\r\nDolly\r\nFairplex\r\nGoudy Old Style\r\nPerpetua\r\nSherwood\r\nTribute\r\n\r\n\r\nThanks.\r\n\r\nps.
  This is technically reposted from the design forum. Sorry, but I'm desparate."

  body: Californian is a great font. However I would say it's dress jean with a tucked
    long-sleeved dress shirt. I'm looking for a jeans and short sleeved golf shirt
    with a hint of flannel.

    Oldstyle</a>, but you've nixed that already. Let me think...\r\n\r\nI think <a
    href=\"http://www.stormtype.com/andulka.html\">Andulka</a> has some of the features
    you're looking for, maybe a bit too sophisticated for what you're looking for
    (if i'm reading you right).\r\nHave you looked at <a href=\"http://www.houseind.com/index.php?page=showfont&id=171\">Paperback</a>?
    I think that has all the qualities you've said you're looking for. I'll try to
    come up with some others..."

  body: "maybe, but is it hard to be more condensed than [[mrs eaves]], brah?\r\n\r\nalso,
    i think the more condensed you get the less \"approachable, friendly, warm\" you
    get. but maybe that's just my feelings."

  body: "It's small on the body, not condensed. In fact the x-height region is pretty
    wide. All this means that if you equivalence apparent size with a font with a
    larger x-height, the set-width for Mrs Eaves will probably be greater.\r\n\r\nI'm
    thinking Octavian, or Stone's Print.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    too. We're definately on the right track.\r\n\r\n\r\nIs there anything that is
    more handmade looking or letterpress like?\r\n"
