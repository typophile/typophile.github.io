  body: "The \"Boston\" fonts are Poster Bodoni forgeries formerly sold by Weatherly
    Systems Inc in the USA, and also by Christine Mauerkirchner and Rainer Grunert
    in Germany, and by other font forging companies.\r\n\r\nOpen the huge PDF file
    f31000i.pdf downloadable from my website here\r\n\r\nhttp://www.sanskritweb.net/forgers/#F31000\r\n\r\nAfter
    opening the PDF, search for \"Boston\".\r\n\r\n(I intentionally do not mention
    the complete download link here, because this 30,000 rip-off fonts documentation
    is downloaded like crazy by freaks in gigabyte quantities.)\r\n"
