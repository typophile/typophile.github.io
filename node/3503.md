  body: The third sample, with its two very different u&#39;s, may have been handwritten.

  body: I think I agree with Chesh that the swirly script is handwritten, but for
    another place to see a lot of swirly designs, look in Part 5 <a href="http://bowfinprintworks.com/Script05Pg1.html"
    target="_blank"> &#40;Designed Scripts&#41;</a>, Part 7 <a href="http://bowfinprintworks.com/Script07Pg1.html"
    target="_blank">&#40;Casual Flowing Scripts&#41;</a> and Part 8 <a href="http://bowfinprintworks.com/Script08Pg1.html"
    target="_blank">&#40;Casual Non-flowing scripts&#41;</a> of the Script Font ID
    Guide. I counted about a dozen curly fonts in the first 8 pages of Part 5, including
    Scriptease, Gigi, Dollhouse, Clover, Giddyup, Yellow, Riva, Marguerita and Curlz.
    &#40;Be warned, if you look through them all it will be nearly 50 web pages.&#41;

  body: Thanks for helping me out!  I looked at your link suggestions, and found a
    lot of fonts I have never seen before.  And thanks to Mike, I won&#39;t be bored
    for the next hours! <BR> <BR>Also, I think you may be right that the &#34;about
    us&#34; pic above is handwritten, as it is from an illustrators site.    <BR>
