  similar, for their logo.  In particular, they like the letter \"R\" and how it looks
  like it could be a person in motion.\r\n\r\nAny idea what this font may be or if
  there is a similar one that would give the same \"in motion\" feeling?\r\n\r\nThanks
  in advance for any help you can provide, Sharon[img:sites/default/files/old-images/CORE1_5224.png]"
