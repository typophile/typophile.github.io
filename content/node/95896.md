  I am looking for the two fonts used in the two attached logos.\r\n\r\nI haven't
  found anything suiting on my font library yet. If you know a font which comes pretty
  close or is the exafct one let me know.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance!\r\n\r\nkind regards,\r\nChristian"

    like [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/fountain/nordic-narrow-pro/|Nordic Narrow]]
    for the first one and [[http://www.ffonts.net/Romeo-Giulietta.font|Romeo Giulietta]]
    for the second one (even if outlines would need to be cleaned up).\r\nFor the
    second one, there'd probably a way by considering it as a mix of fonts. Even if
    it sounds odd, I would probably start with [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/itc/bauhaus/|Bauhaus]]
    (mainly because of the /S), redrawing almost everything starting from this base.
    I like also [[http://www.myfonts.com/foundry/TipografiaRamis/|Tipografia Ramis]]
    fonts (mixing them)."

  body: "Hello Ryuk,\r\n\r\nthanks for your input. Nordic Narrow is getting close
    to the first one, but needs quite a few alternations. I had Hobo Std. on my mind
    too, but it's not close either. I guess its a custom font?\r\n\r\nBauhaus and
    TipografiaRamis for the second one look quite good. A few minor changes and it
    should match quite good.\r\n\r\nMore input is welcome! :)\r\n\r\nThanks once more.\r\n\r\nChristian"

  body: "Hello.\r\n\r\njust another inquiry regarding the Alaska Airliens retro font.
    I am looking for your input regarding the font used for this text.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/alaska_airlines_75th_4929.jpg]\r\n\r\nI've
    already tried using the different online recognition tools. But the results weren't
    too satisfying. Plastik Bold seems to come pretty close. The shape of the 'A'
    and 'S' give me some headache.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance!\r\n\r\nBest regards,\r\nChristian"

    when all you were doing was asking a perfectly reasonable question.
