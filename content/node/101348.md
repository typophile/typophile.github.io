  (1915-1922), I am considering the possibility of including hanging punctuation marks
  (quotes, periods, colons, hyphens and the like) in the OpenType implementation.
  I was thinking of using contextual alternates to substitute punctuation marks at
  the begining/ending of lines with the corresponding hanging (null-width) marks.
  However, I haven't been able to figure out how to detect within the \"calt\" feature
  a begin/end of line event. Is this possible? Or, more generally, is there any way
  of implementing mechanically this type of substitutions?\r\n\r\nThanks in advance
  for your advice.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/hanging_5718.png]"

  body: I actually applaud you for trying to do this within the font itself, though
    unfortunately I can't give you any practical advice. InDesign's "optical margin
    alignment" does a whole lot more than just hang punctuation, so in fact there
    isn't simply a way to get all your commas and quotes in the margin without other
    things ending up in the margin as well.

  body: "Another possible approach just occurred to me. I haven\u2019t thought through
    all the possible ramifications.\r\n\r\nYou could probably deploy a certain amount
    of hanging punctuation using a series of space-punctuation / punctuation-space
    contextual substitutions, combined with backstopped kerning pairs.\r\n\r\n<pre>
    \   sub space @punct' by @punct_hang_left;\r\n    sub @punct' space by @punct_hang_right;
    </pre>\r\n\r\nYou\u2019d need relevant sets of <em>.calt_hanglft</em> and <em>.calt_hangrt</em>
    alternates with sidebearings adjusted accordingly. And you\u2019d want to put
    in positive kerning pairs between space and these alternates to restore \u201Cnormal\u201D
    spacing, since they\u2019ll be substituted throughout the text. But then, when
    they occur at the beginning or end of a line, the kerning won\u2019t be relevant
    and the adjusted sidebearings will create the hanging effect.\r\n\r\nHowever,
    it might not be possible to account for hyphens in automatic hyphenation. You\u2019d
    have to test applications to see whether or not they respect a separately encoded
    u+00AD soft hyphen in a font, along with any subsequent gsub (which would just
    be a single subst in this case, not a contextual subst).\r\n\r\nAnd this approach
    won\u2019t work on any punctuation at the beginning of a paragraph \u2014 opening
    quote, as a primary example \u2014 since there\u2019s no preceding space, obviously.\r\n\r\nIt
    would take some tinkering to cover all eventualities. But there might be potential
    in this approach.\r\n\r\n"

    hard return is a boundary for both OT backtrack and lookahead input sequences.
    Now that I think about it, it\u2019s probable that any line end, soft or hard,
    bounds both the backtrack and lookahead also. And layout engines generally treat
    the intermediate space as belonging to the previous line, which is how this would
    work for end-of-line. \r\n\r\nBut, like I said, I didn\u2019t test this overall

    it would if one made a composite of each Uppercase letter with a hanging \u201C,
    and sub for each \u201C-Cap typed, for a Cap with a hanging \u201C attached...

    have to go through the trouble of composing all those <em>quotedblleft_capital.hanging</em>
    \u201Clogotypes\u201D and then kern the space to them all. Could be scripted,
    I reckon.\r\n\r\nI\u2019d probably approach beginning-of-line with the <em>ignore

    you cannot achieve the effect of traditional hanging punctuation, as shown in
    the example, with InDesign\u2019s Story > Optical Margin Alignment setting. Basically,
    that is not a Hanging Punctuation feature.\r\n\r\nIn Quark 8, however, you do

    was alive, he flirted off & on with using hanging punctuation. Richard was enamored
    with the constant text page, preferring to card rather than run long or short
    pages. While he'd never presume to tell a compositor how to set type, he even
    preferred to card over ending a page with an orphan, or either ending or beginning
    a page with less than a full line of type (including paragraph indents).\r\n\r\nWe
    tried all manner of hanging punctuation -- left side only (only quote marks),
    and both left & right sides. We kept running into tricky constructions on the
    right, How about period-closequote (now quotedblright)? Hang both? How about quoteright
    followed by quotedblright? And when that's preceded by a period? Always hang hyphens?
    How about en-dashes. Etc.\r\n\r\nUltimately, Richard gave up on the notion, Nice
    in theory, often too awkward in practice.\r\n\r\nWhile Richard's fame was probably
    for <cite>The Telephone Book,</cite> he was the consummate designer; in a restrained
    way (usually), he considered every detail. Before pretty much abandoning hanging
    punctuation, we worked with it a number of years, and with varying kinds of texts.\r\n\r\nHere's
    a link to a web site built by his son, Sam.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.richardeckersley.net/\r\n\r\n(With
