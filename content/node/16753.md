  body: "Joe,\r\nMy son is Autistic. He is 17 years old now. There is a very broad
    spectrum of deficiencies in Autism.  Many of them are sensory. My son was 4 before
    he had any language and was late in reading as well. For him, there did not seem
    to be a problem with letter formation and typefaces except he did always prefer
    Sans Serif faces though. He would always change defaults on programs away from
    Times to Helvetica or Arial.  This was not because he liked the fonts in particular.
    \ When I asked him about it, he just said, \"The extra things stuck on the letters
    [serifs] were too loud.\" To this day, he will not type his homework in a serif
    face.  Understand that this is just my son and not a scientific survey. \r\n\r\nI
    have not seen any studies that spell out type preferences for Autistic children
    but I do know that many such kids begin with sign language as my son did.  \r\n\r\nLet
    me know if you find anything more about type and Autism.  \r\n\r\nChrisL"

    understands that this is a single individual and may not be indicative of Autistic
    children as a whole. There is a broad range of differences among people in the
    Autism spectrum.\r\nAlthough my son prefers to write in sans serif faces, he reads
    seriffed faces now with no problem and without comment.\r\n\r\n ChrisL"
