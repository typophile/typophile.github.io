  The question that comes to mind now is what's the real Robert Granjon \"roman\"
  available on digital format: \r\n\r\n<em>Granjon</em> (George William Jones)\r\n<em>Plantin</em>

    to Alexander Lawson, 'The name Galliard stems from Granjon's own term for an 8-point
    font he cut about 1570. It undoubtedly refers to the style of the face, for the
    galliard was a lively dance of the period.' \"\r\n\r\n\"<em>Galliard</em> has
    robust strokes and sharp details. According to Lawson, 'While the designers of
    the regenerated Garamonds were attempting to bring fidelity in their copies, Carter
    preferred simply to bring to <em>Galliard</em> his interpretation of the spirit
    of a Granjon original. . . . <em>Galliard</em> thus possesses the authentic sparkle
    that is lacking in the current Garamonds.' \""

    Hrant, you do at least use the pilcrow what it's meant for. If you're going to
    add a line break you don't need a pilcrow. It's one or the other, not both. I
    guess I'm a bit too concerned with original intentions of the characters. I've
    always had mixed feelings about Fournier's use of the pilcrow in comments, as
    it seems to be a gimmick, but I must admit I love seeing the pilcrow and the way
    he used it in his original post is \u2014 now that I've re-evaluated it \u2014
    the first time I see it adding to the functionality, as the pilcrows denote that
    the list of typefaces belongs to the second paragraph and is not a new paragraph
    as might be implied to some extent by using the line break.\r\n\r\nHrant, why
    don't you update your website though? The 90s look aside, shame on you for using
    hyphens where you should be using dashes. Don't take this too seriously."

    one, or perhaps just the first one who started using the pilcrow within the context
    of a forum. In a way it's his invention. Copying him probably couldn't be taken

  body: "Ah, the midpoints are those little dots, like British decimal points. Not
    some design feature.\r\n\r\nI was going to say that lower-case letters had serifs,
    in imitation of the capital letters in Roman inscriptions, because they ought
    to harmonize visually with capital letters... even though they originated from
    something so different. I suppose we could have stuck with Carolingian script
    as the central point of origin for mixed-case texts, using Roman capitals as a
    basis only for all-caps typefaces...\r\n\r\nbut the temptation to use the prettiest-looking
    historical model as frequently as possible was too much to resist.\r\n\r\nA world
    in which nearly all (Latin alphabet) text typefaces are highly calligraphic, and
    Roman types are a specialty item - like Copperplate Gothic, or Trajanus, all-caps
    only. That's hard to even imagine. Presumably it would be a world where historical
    authenticity overrides other values - or one where the activity of typography
    is stunted by economic constraints. Be that as it may, alternate choices - including
    the opposite, a world where typography is less bounded by tradition - are useful
    sources of new ideas.\r\n\r\nAs one trivial example... imagine a world where typefaces
    aren't classified by their serifs. Serif versus sans-serif would still be a significant
    distinction, but, for example, hairline serifs wouldn't imply that the rest of
    the letterform follows Bodoni and Scotch Roman - hairline serifs or wedge serifs
    (fonts like Latin Bold) could be stuck on an old style body just as easily, and
    so the other features of the letter like the degree of stroke contrast would be
    the classifiers.\r\n\r\nFor historical reasons, the mainstream of type development
    has been in a <em>very</em> narrow subset of the possible design space. Hermann
    Zapf's famed Optima stands almost alone as a foray outside that zone suitable
    for text, rather than just display, use."
