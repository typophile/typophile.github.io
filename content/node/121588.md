  I am pursuing a degree in graphic design with a minor in typography. I have recently
  just completed the design of my second typeface. And would like to know what you
  think abut it, What I can improve on and what you like about it.\r\n\r\nModern Glyph\r\nDesigned
  By: Emy Dalsted\r\n\r\nThe classification of this font is a modern san serif that
  is based on a modular square grid with circular rules. There is nothing complicated
  to this font it is created to be simple and legible at any size. \r\n\r\nThe primary
  purpose of this font is to be used as body copy, although it can be scaled to any
  size and still look great. This font will be good for solving issues where there
  is hard to read body copy or redundant font choices. Put Modern Glyph in place of
  any font choice and it will give your project a sharp, clean and sophisticated look.
  \r\n\r\nA fun attribute of this font is that there are optional letter forms with
  knockouts and fun glyphs that give the font some room to play with, when it is used
  as a headline type. This will spice a piece up, if that\u2019s exactly what you\u2019re
  looking for.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/typophile_modern_6199.jpg]"

    this for body copy and focus on making it a good display face (for example by
    adding a darker weight).\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    body: "Awesome advice! Great idea on giving this typeface a thicker weight. Or
      maybe even numerous different weights so the designer has the choice for their
      display copy. Thanks for the input, I appreciate it.\r\n- Emy"

  body: "I suspect the /S would look a lot better if its spine were diagonal rather
    than horizontal in the middle.\r\n\r\nThere's a lot of variation between letter
    widths \u2014 /C strikes me as particularly wide, /N particularly narrow, for
    example. Could be intentional, though, for all I know."

  body: "That is great feedback, thank you! I also received that feedback from some
    fellow students. I did do it intentionally, but I am seeing that most people are
    not finding it pleasing to the eye. So there are a few letters that I can manipulate
    a bit.\r\n\r\n"
