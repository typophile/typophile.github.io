  body: "The _H_ is handlettered.\r\nIt is a Tuscan style letter with \"mustache terminals.\"
    \r\nAmong fonts in this category are Hessian http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/madtype/hessian/
    and Lynchburg  http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/fontmesa/lynchburg/\r\nYou will have
    to add the special \"demi-mustache\" crossbar. Suggestion: take an _I_ clip off
    half the mustache and rotate 90 degrees and use it as the basis for you crossbar.
    Do some more editing and you are there.\r\nDon"
