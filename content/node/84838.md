  is similar to Futura, but with the exception of the \"C\" and \"a\" characters.
  It has a closer feel to Caslon's Egyptian, in that the aperture of the \"C\" curls
  inwards, instead of being \"cut-off\" vertically as does the \"C\" in Futura.\r\n\r\nPlease
  let me know if you know the name!!\r\n\r\nAlso, on another note, are there any contemporary
  typefaces designed in a similar style to this one that you know of?!\r\n\r\nThanks
  very much!\r\nBest,\r\nJH"

  body: "Thank you, type addict and mimimalista!\r\n\r\ntype addict: this one is extremely
    close, although I think the lowercase \"a\" is somewhat different. I have seen
    this font (not the one you suggested, but the one I am looking for) on old clocks
    from... the 1920s - 30s ? I think...\r\n\r\n\r\nBest,\r\nJH"

  body: "I wouldn\u2019t say Erbar. From the image, which is low quality, but it shows
    enough, I would say it\u2019s Wagner & Schmidt\u2019s Kristall Grotesk, of which
    I am unaware if a digital version exists.\r\n\r\nIts feeling on the page is very
    different from Erbar, and also from Futura, especially due to the peculiar form
    of the lowercase [a] and other letters."
