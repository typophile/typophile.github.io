body: "Hello Typohilers,\r\n\r\nI'm hoping someone can help.  I have been looking
  for info on how to change the font menu display in Word 2007.  The default setting
  is for the actual style of the font as well as the font name to be displayed.  This
  is quite advantageous for most users, but we want to turn that feature off and revert
  back to the old display where the font menu just displays the font name in a standard
  font for all fonts listed.\r\n\r\nHaving searched high and low, we can't seem to
  find an answer. \r\n\r\nWe work a lot with barcode fonts, and it is proving problematic
  just seeing the barcode characters in the font menu rather than the font name.\r\n\r\nAny
  help is appreciated?\r\n\r\nMany thanks\r\nNeil\r\n\r\n"

    then you should see a checkbox for 'WYSIWYG Font Menus' uncheck this. You maybe
    have to restart the application. \r\n\r\nI only checked this in Word:Mac I have

    Apps are the only ones that have this anomaly. All the Adobe and Apple apps (and
    all others I have seen) look correct. \r\nI am using Mac Office version 2008.\r\n\r\nChris"

    reports to the MacBU from time to time. \r\n\r\nMy guess was for Windows versions
    of Office, and I could be totally wrong for all I know. It could have a hard coded
    list of symbol fonts (Wingdings, Webdings etc.) and not be identifying them based
    on font properties. \r\n \r\n"

    not sure if what you want is here, but you find Tools by going to the Windows
    thingy in the top left (where you go for Print or Save As). At the bottom of that
    is a button for Word Options (next to Exit Word). There is a customize option
    in there, which may have what you want.\r\n\r\nNo, I'm not a Word expert. (I hate
    Word 2007). But I had to use help this afternoon to find the options on Excel,
    and just looked and see it is the same in Word.\r\n\r\nHope this helps."
