  by the above mentioned designers.\r\nUnfortunately the source is from a Typophile
  chapbook dating from 1946, and their biographies are far from complete. And what
  I've found on the internet has not been very helpful, so far.\r\n\r\nHas anyone
  something to chip in here?\r\n\r\nYours,\r\n\r\n\u0192"

    Logo, Font, and Lettering Bible</em> and also gave a conference presentation which
    someone might have video of.

  body: "I've included manicules in Fontesque, Figgins Sans, and Scotch Modern.\r\nThey're
    original designs, except for one of those in Scotch Modern, which is a revival.\r\nThose
    in Scotch Modern Display (and the upcoming Fontesque OT) are optically scaled.\r\nThose
    in Figgins Sans italic are italicized.\r\n\r\nCheck out the PDFs at shinntype.com
    to see what they look like."

    after seeing your Scotch Modern display manicule in St Petersburg. I'll be in
    touch.\r\n\r\nHere's the Zamboni manicule in all its Dick Tracyesque glory:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Zamboni_5476.png]"

    his paintings--he painted all of his life in addition to being a graphic artist.
    I have attached the link here  http://halzamboniartistgallery.com/   and you will
    find a biography of him on the site. I hope this helps you and introduces you
    to another side of my father. In turn, I would be very interested in learning
    more about the manicules that he did.  You can respond to me at maryelizabethzamboni@hotmail.com.
    \   I hope you enjoy the website                                                 MaryElizabeth
