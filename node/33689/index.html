I've been using zip drives, and have been having trouble with them breaking and not storing info right,

but now I' shocked to see you can get 160 GB [!!!!] for only $100. My computer only has 60 GB.

Is this right?

Anyone recommend them?

I like this.

Actually, the don't have anything other manufacturers don't have too, except knowing you have a "lacie", and nice design, and paying for this. They use the same components, others will work just as well.

100$ for 160gb are quite expensive. Look at the 320gb model. It's just 40% more expensive, offering 100% more space.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I think I got a Lacie a few years back, 250 GB for under $200. . . can't remember. . . just bought a Western Digital 1 TB. . . I was Lacie friendly firt, hesitant at WD because I had seen cheap models. . . You want to put your money into saving your work right. But yea, the TB was considerably more, and it's there top of the line. I had a Maxtor 500 gb that went bunk after a few months, only thing that ever happened to it was it gettin bumped on my desk. . . It would register on my computer (mac) therefore losing 500 gigs worth of music. Ive still got it just not sure how to fix it. 

I guess the only thing you should look into is the warranty. I never use the software that comes with them. . . I have my own regiment of back up to various locations. I spit all of this out because I have lost tons of stuff with my comp crashing and reinstalling the os.

		<div class="commentbody">Personally, I use Iomega external HDDs (I have several, I take one on photo shoots, I use one on each of two main computers as external backups, and a spare). I've never had a problem with one. For about $185US, you can get a 500GB drive. 

Maxtor and Western Digital both make a range of HDDs, from consumer to professional. If you buy pro, you get pro quality. 

James, if your Maxtor is still registering, and the bump is the only thing that happened to it, it's likely a mechanical failure, and not a media failure. That's fixable / recoverable (although perhaps at a price, of course). Have you contacted Maxtor?</div>

		<div class="commentbody">LaCie are OK and they look pretty but don't be fooled into thinking the actual hard drive is any more reliable than any other brand. They don't make their own drives, just the pretty case.

<strong>they all die.</strong>

anything you have on a hard drive should be backed-up somewhere else – I know too many people with external hard drives as their main storage, with no back-up of that data (do they think the external drive will last forever?)

So, presuming you have everything backed-up, the one thing that would sway me when I choose a hard drive is brand warranty.

Seagate offer internal 'Barracuda' drives with a five-year warranty.
Western Digital offer the My Book <em>Pro</em> with a three-year warranty (other versions of the MyBook range have one-year warranties).

most other brands offer one-year warranties.

These warranties don't stop them dying but they will get you a new drive if they do (and if everything is backed-up it's not such a problem)

Did I mention how important it was to back-up your back-up?</div>

The ATA drives from my old G4 (which won't work in the Mac Pro's) are now in Firewire 800 enclosures - fast as heck. That's the other thing, if you have a Firewire 800 port on your computer it is MUCH faster than Firewire 400 or USB 2. Enclosures with the Oxford 912 chip (which has FW400,FW800 and USB2 ports) are about $99 at Other World Computing.

Even if it comes preformatted for Mac or PC, reformat the drive on your computer before you start using it. I used mine with the built in cross platform formatting and it was a little wonky. File creation dates would be wrong, and preview icons would be switched/missing. Very confusing. Once reformatted, they work perfectly and reliably. Very fast and very lightweight.

You can't buy a hard drive that won't fail. So buy a cheap one that will fail, and design your work practices so that when it does fail, it won't impact your life.

I always thought it sounded strange (and pathetic) that someone claiming to be a professional whines in some group that he had lost all his fonts and files, because he had never backed up. It makes complete sense even for us amateurs, since backing up is a good way to ensure that Murphy leaves you alone.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I think it is true, as someone mentioned, that LaCie doesn't manufacture hard drives as much as it packages them. Very good connections, fans, housings, etc., which contribute to long life. I had one for over nine years, long past its usefulness, and it never failed.

Also it is true, to a degree, that it doesn't matter what the hard drive is designated as, SCSI, ATA, SATA, FireWire, USB, eSATA, it is only the connections that make them what they are, so yes, you can house whatever externally with the right connectors.

I run my internals off of a multi port hard drive controller card and use FireWire for externals. I use an internal drive as the main system and everything else drive, a second as a scratch disk, and a third as a document backup. The externals are all full drive back ups, including a portable (OWC Mercury) and a large multi-partitioned (for sequential back ups).

SuperDuper (a cloner) is great for backing up everything to the external drives, quickly and reliably, and has saved my butt a couple times now.

The word of wisdom with a drive is, "not if, but when" it will fail. And yes, back up your back-ups. Likely, your whole creative, and in some case, financial, life is on these drives.

To get back to you. Those old Syquest and Zip drives and disks were a god-send, and quite costly. Today, you are far better off with an internal/external hard drive combination, plus DVD/CD-ROM back ups. Don't necessarily recommend the latter for long term reliability, but, can't hurt.
