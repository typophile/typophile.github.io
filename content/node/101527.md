  will ever be part \u2013 at least \u2013 of standard body face character sets? \r\nI
  need it very often, especially for corporate profiles, annual reports and brochures.
  I know that it hasn\u2019t been encoded as a character. \u2013 However, this shouldn\u2019t
  be an obstacle for type designers to add it.\r\n"

    and scaled and how the use of the logo is approved as part of a greater process,
    including it in a font would likely not meet with the requirements of the standard,
    as shown and described below:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/ce_marking_logo_3689.jpg]\r\n\r\n<em>The
    various components of the CE marking must have substantially the same vertical
    dimension, which may not be less that 5 mm. If the CE marking is reduced or enlarged,
    the proportions given in the above graduated drawing must be respected.</em> (http://ec.europa.eu/enterprise/policies/single-market-goods/cemarking/professionals/manufacturers/affix-ce-marking/index_en.htm?filter=12)"

  body: "Thank you so much for this essential information, Karl! Nevertheless, the
    specified minimum vertical size is \u2013 as I learned now \u2013 5mm, which means
    ca. 14 DTP points (hopefully I\u2019m right). I think the set point size (as specified
    in vertical mm) should be user responsibility and not responsibility of the type
    designer, foundry or reseller. \u2013 Important is the availability of this character
    in the character set of a body face."

  body: Your number of 14 is correct, rounded; the point size to set would be 19-20
    pt depending upon the font.

  body: "It doesn't look like it has a Unicode position, plus since it's so strictly
    defined that a font's style will have no bearing on it. So it's not very desirable
    as a character in a font. Why not just have/use it as a stand-alone EPS? It's
    not like you need to type a bunch of them at a time.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, there's
    a risk concerning that minimum size, possibly leading to a textbook frivolous
    lawsuit, which is how people roll these days, at least here in the US. If a font
    publisher says something like \"it must be 14 point to meeting the 5mm minimum
    requirement\" some people will think the font has to be set at 14 point, but as
    George said that's not true, because type designers don't make their glyphs span
    the full height, so the mark will end up too small, and the lawsuit cascade might
    lead to the font designer... And for a type designer with a large library of fonts,
    unless he does decide to make the CE mark the whole height of the Em for all his
    fonts, he'll have to figure out the height proportion for each one of his fonts...
    Messy stuff.\r\n\r\nBTW is that thing spaced horribly, or what?! But if you try
    to make it look nicer by bringing the \"C\" and \"E\" closer, Interpol might come
    after you!\r\nhttp://www.electronicsweekly.com/blogs/test-and-measurement/2011/02/which-ce-badge-have-you-got.html\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: It should be encoded, and I'm surprised if it is not already in Unicode. Even
    though I don't think it is something that needs to be included in more than a
    handful of fonts, since the shape is standard, being able to include it as a text
    entitity rather than as an embedded graphic seems useful. The estimated symbol
    is also a standard shape, but is encoded in Unicode and hence included in at least
    some fonts.
