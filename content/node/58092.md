  body: FYI, a lot of those fonts were first designed and released earlier than 1979.
    In some cases, I think it perhaps indicates when it was first digitized, or when
    it was licensed or acquired by a particular font manufacturer.

  body: Ricardo, where did you get the information about New Caledonia? I thought
    it was digitized in 1982 (the original Caledonia was released in 1939). And I
    don't think David had anything to do with it.

  body: "Hi, Kent. The info for all 3 typefaces is from Neil Macmillan's 2006 edition
    of <em>An A-Z of Type Designers</em>. David Berlow's entry appears on page 47.
    Here's a brief passage: \"His career as a type designer began in 1978 at Mergenthaler,
    Linotype, Stempel & Haas, where he was involved in a number of major projects,
    including revisions of Dwiggins's Caledonia and many of the ITC faces released
    by Mergenthaler.\"\r\n\r\nMaybe the year 1979 is the year David worked on it,
    or maybe the date in the book is wrong."

    You know, after my last comment I checked a previous edition of that book (<em>Rookledge's
    International Handbook of Type Designers</em>... different authors), and the same
    date (1979) is given for New Caledonia. "

  body: "Based on back issues of U&lc. and <em>Typographic Communications Today</em>
    by Edward Gottschall (1989), here are some that were released that year:\r\n\r\nWalbaum
    (Linotype revival)\r\nITC Zapf Chancery\r\nITC Benguiat Gothic\r\nITC Novarese\r\nAuriol
    (Linotype revival)\r\nITC Clearface\r\nQuadriga Antiqua (Berthold)\r\nVladimir
    (Alphatype)\r\nGarth Graphic (Compugraphic)\r\nRomic (Letraset)\r\nPraxis (Hell)\r\n\r\nThe
    pages on MyFonts and FontShop aren't as far off as I first thought, but they are
    not very complete, either."
