  body: "Good suggestions Kevin. \r\nGrange is the name used for a circa 1900 [just
    a guess as to date] Art Nouveau font found at p. 53 of Dan X. Solo's big catalog
    of his typeface purchases, but I don't know if this was the original name or the
    original designer or foundry. The unusual word \"Grange\" seems to have originated
    as a term for  a farming estate belonging to a monastery but in the context of
    circa 1900 it may have referred to \"The National Grange of the Order of Patrons
    of Husbandry\" See wiki at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_National_Grange_of_the_Order_of_Patrons_of_Husbandry
    which includes a link to a colorful poster from 1873. Unfortunately Wiki says
    nothing about a font called Grange.\r\nDon"
