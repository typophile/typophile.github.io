body: This is my first post to this forum. I have designed a logo for a local wellness
  center and I am not quite happy with it. <BR> <BR>I am pleased with the overall
  design but I think I need to tweak it just a bit more. The company has an existing
  logo of a heart with an olympic flame over it. I decided to update their image with
  a new design. <BR> <BR>They did&#39;nt really ask for a redesign but I took the
  initiative to put something together for them. They have actually used the logo
  on a drink bottle but nowhere else. I think they are afraid to change their identity
  because they might look too &#34;successful&#34;. <BR> <BR>The logo would eventually
  be applied to stationary, bus. cards, etc. Any critiques would be great at this
  point. I&#39;m very happy with the concept but it still needs a little something.
  <BR> <BR>Thanks for the help <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/56490.jpg"

  body: The concept is okay, in my opinion. But the overall feeling lacks finesse,
    subtlety. The capitals are rather insipid in contrast with the flowing forms of
    the central heart-piece.  <BR>The way the H sits against the heart leaves this
    little angle in the top-right corner. This needs to be corrected. Also, to my
    eye, the W sits to cramped in the heart. Due to all the diagonal lines of that
    letter, you need to orchestrate a fine balance between form and counterform here.
    <BR>Have you experimented with other fonts, or a narrower heart, smaller letters?
    Might be usefull.

  body: Jay what is a wellness center? Is it a spa? Is it commercial business? My
    first impression is the mark is powerful but not warm and friendly. It might make
    a good emblem for a car.

  body: The wellness center is a workout facility. I thought the heart would be a
    good metaphor since it is so necessary to good health. Here&#39;s another variation
    on the logo. I took the letters out of the heart and made them serif to warm them
    up some. <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/56533.jpg"

  body: That last version is much easier on the eye, Jay. Now that I know what a wellness
    center is, I think the color might be too &#39;medical&#39;. And, in this version,
    the two elements are too seperate. Try to integrate them into a logo that is one.

  body: I get the &#34;I heart NY&#34; feel to this latest version. I don&#39;t read
    the flame as a flame and I don&#39;t know why you have it at all. At this point
    I would work on the type. This face is kind of dull.

  body: Okay so the flame is the heart does not work. Here is another version. I put
    the original flame over heart in the middle of the type. I also changed the type
    to Adobe Jensen. I really like the feel of this type better. Thanks for the advice.

    alot better now too. Now work on the relationship between the type and the mark.
    I think the mark is to large.

    Houston Wellness Center means nothing to the average person. Its not necessarly
    your job, but make it your suggestion.

  body: I had already thought up a couple of taglines. One was Houston Wellness Center.
    Wellness is our middle name. One of the owners thought it was great. <BR> <BR>I
    was able to talk with the other owner last week and he liked the new direction
    I was going in. I will follow up with him soon and see what he thinks of this
    new direction. I got the feeling talking to him that he is ready for a new design;
    it just has to be something that he is comfortable with.

  body: I like the direction your logo is taking, but you might want to look at the
    flame shape and maybe make a small adjustment. As it is now, it is very similar
    to the shape of a descending dove, in that case it almost certainly gives a quasi
    religious feel to it - especially in some evangelical circles in the south. Perhaps
    another toungue on the flame would help or rounding the bottom a bit more. Unless
    of course it is associated with a church group or religious movement - in which
    case it would be very appropriate - right now it kinda seems to say Mercy Hospital
    of the Sacred Heart to me. As far as any ambiguity of the word wellness center
    - in Louisville almost ALL of the new health clubs are called &#34;Wellness Centers&#34;
    so I think that aspect is clear - is that a regional thing maybe? I do like the
    tagling though - very snappy. Is it possible to shift them to a deeper red - less
    bloody and more soothing? I think that will cut down on the medical feel - also
    maybe incorporate a softer color into the text to help even it all out.

  body: 'I don&#39;t think I would go with a &#34;deeper red&#34;. To me, that is
    even more bloody. If anything, I would lean more in an orange direction, which
    has no relationship to blood or medical institutional imagery. Also, I don&#39;t
    mean to be intentionally contradicting Hugh on all accounts, but the dove thing
    seems to be a pretty far stretch. Anytime a heart is used as imagery, my first
    concern is avoiding the image of breasts or a butt. In this case, the only alternative
    image I can see beside the intended one is a flaming fart exiting a butt. <BR>
    <BR>I can&#39;t say I like the tagline at all. &#34;Houston Wellness Center: Wellness
    is our middle name.&#34; It is redundant and doesn&#39;t add any explanation or
    description. Something like &#34;Houston Wellness Center: Live a longer, healthier
    life&#34; or &#34;...Be stronger, live longer&#34; makes a suggestion about what
    the wellness center is about. &#34;...is our middle name&#34; is an old school
    clich'

  body: yikes - forgot about the whole error thing - been three months since I posted
    &#40;ugh&#41; if a mod could just delete one of those.  <BR> <BR>LOL - Scott -
    boy oh boy I must be way out of practice at critique &#40;heheheh&#41; - Instead
    of deeper I should have said cooler reds- not quite as far as a rubine, but something
    of that more calm feel - but orange is an energy color so if you can get them
    to make enough of a shift to be an actual orangey &#40;is that a word&#41; red
    then you cold inject a ton of energy into the logo.  <BR> <BR>Scott you are probably
    right - it is a bit cliche, but I think that is what appeals to me - it seems
    like it is coming full circle. There are a lot of taglines for hospitals around
    here that are those kinds of statements. Norton - Experience. Better Care.; Baptist
    East - Feel Better. Maybe it was just the whole going for the cute punch line
    that got the nostalgic side of me. <BR> <BR>As far as the dove - I swear I see
    it, but that may be the fact that I am from the south and you can&#39;t swing
    a dead cat without hitting a church down here. And I know of a couple that are
    actually called Hearts of Fire Church &#40;one was located in an old firehouse
    so it was always a bit corny&#41;. All I am saying is I have seen logos for churches
    that maximize the similarity between a flame shape and a downward dove - &#40;i&#39;ve
    even designed one or two&#41;. If I am the only one who sees it - then you are
    probably safe. - Just thought to mention it.

  body: The flame is really up to debate right now. I only put it in my logo because
    it was in their former logo. I don&#39;t see how I can avoid a &#34;negative&#34;
    feel of having a flame over a heart. So the flame will probably be gone soon.
    <BR> <BR>I think just a heart would work fine and I like the suggestion of a differant
    red. When I first did the logo I was thinking really modern and progressive but
    now I think they need more of a sedate and passive feel.

  body: Jay the first one reads Houston Center Wellness. Not Good. I like the second
    one but I have a suggestion, Houston and Wellness are about the same length, try
    stacking the name on 3 lines &#40;keeping center small&#41; and let the heart-o
    work in the negitive space  of the upper and lower case letters.
