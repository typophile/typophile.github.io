body: "I am in the market for a lazer printer / writer, etc. Something I can print
  really sharp typography from. I have been printing on an epson 2200 ink jet for
  a couple of years... its just not cutting it. Before that the studio i worked at
  had one of those big xerox color lazer fiery docucolor stations about the size of
  a pickup truck... with a flat panel kiosk, it was sweet. but i am looking for just
  b/w, really crisp type, under $500... the cheaper the better. any ideas? i would
  love one that printer 11x17, but it is not totally necesary.\r\n\r\ni am on a mac,
  needs to be firewire or usb 1.0\r\n\r\nso what do you guys think? what are you using?\r\n\r\ncheers\r\nj"

    2400dpi output that were around your price range. Brother and HP IIRC. Might be
