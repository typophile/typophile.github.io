  beautiful, slightly condensed modern serif text face, makes a first appearance \u2013
  at least to me \u2013 in beautiful new book \r\n'Buch gestaltung in St.Gallen' \r\nby
  Roland Fruh\r\npub. VGS, 2008\r\nISBN 978-3-7291-1116-7. \r\nCan anyone help? \r\nBTW,
  the other font used is Futura, also beautiful, but that I know! \r\nThanks. \r\n\r\nHonestly..."

    the author\u2019s name is Roland Fr<strong>\xFC</strong>h (may help with searching?)\r\n\r\n\u2018Legenden\u2019
    means captions, underlines, legends. Could it be that this is not the name of
    the typeface, but rather an annotation that the captions are set in some typeface?
    (Of course it could be a typeface, too, but \u2018Legenden\u2019 would be a very
    generic name, like \u2018Headlines\u2019)"

    but neither of them currently contactable hence my (first ever) approach to Typophile.
    \r\n\r\nAnyway, through a little detective work I worked it all out. The font
    is called Collis and is designed by Christoph Noordzij, available form the Ensched\xE9
    Foundry. Check http://www.teff.nl/fonts/collis/collis.html for more details \u2013

    am glad you solved your puzzle, but you might have done this on your own more
    quickly with the [[http://bowfinprintworks.com/SerifGuide/intro.php|Serif Font
    ID Guide]], as long as you had  sample of the type you could look at. Collis was
    in there, along with about 1600 other serif type families. \r\n\r\nI know this
    seems like some sort of shameless self-promotion, but I get nothing if people
    use my Guides. I just think this one in particular is a helpful tool, which works
    pretty well once you learn how to select the attributes. It's what I use for the
    serif questions.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: "Again, thanks for all the help \u2014 I'll have a look at the 'Serif Font
    ID Guide'. \r\n\r\nOkay, the red herring of 'Legenden' comes from my less than
    complete grasp of German. On the colophon of the book (see initial posting) it
    said 'Text der Legenden, Auwahl der Abbildungen...' I was grasping at straws but
    could just about decipher that the rest was about the printer, the papers used,
    etc. As it turns out, and rather uncharacteristically for a book with Hochuli's
    involvement, the typeface is not mentioned."
