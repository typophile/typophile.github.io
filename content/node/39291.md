  the central two degrees of vision in which information is processed during a [[fixation]].
  \r\n\r\nThe parafovea is the five degrees of vision either side of the fovea, and
  the peripheral is the remaining vision either side of the parafovea. The majority
  of the information processed is done so in the fovea. Only low level information
  is able to be garnered by the parafovea and the peripheral."
