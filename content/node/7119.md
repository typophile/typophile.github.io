  body: There has been at least <a href="http://typographi.com/000344.php" target="_blank">one
    attempt</a> to round DIN&#39;s terminals. <BR>It was a custom job. Where is this
    sample from? <BR> <BR>FF DIN Rounded will be released sometime soon, but I&#39;m
    sure it <BR>will look better than this.

  body: Looks like ITC Conduit. <BR> <BR>It&#39;s a bit ropey, my font &#39;Chevin&#39;
    is better if you want something rounded along the lines of Din. G-Type through
    Veer.

  body: Thanks C, you can call me Nick - no need for formality. <BR> <BR>See Mcfont
    post. <BR> <BR>You&#39;re right about Conduit, although it does have a similar
    crudeness.
