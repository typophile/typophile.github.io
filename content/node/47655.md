    in me wishes that the creators knew something more about the typefaces they mentioned
    beyond their names :-)"

    Sans the hero! Who would have expected that? \r\n"

  body: Yeah, it would be nice if they knew there are fonts that didn't come with
    their computer. It's a damn shame to start a sketch about typefaces having a debate
    and then miss the chance to depict Helvetica stating his complete neutrality on
    the issue.

  body: I also wish they had fleshed out the characters with more than just their
    names. Baskerville should have been English. Futura's portrayal bothered me the
    most. But I guess they were trying to appeal to a wider audience (it is, after
    all, posted on CollegeHumor). Courier New saying "do we really need Courier?"
    was awesome, though, and Wingdings was hilarious. "Mailbox! Mailbox! MAAILBOXX!"

  body: "Even though it was supposed to just be a joke on \"Narrow\", depicting Arial
    as ignorant trash was a nice coincidence.\r\n\r\nThe real Futura would be a slim
    German in a black turtleneck and little round glasses. Comic Sans would be a drunken
    middle-aged woman with an annoying laugh trying to sell homemade crafts. Since
    he was mentioned, I picture Zapf Dingbats as a cheerful portly man with a handlebar
    moustache wearing a monocle and bright purple tuxedo with white gloves, communicating
    entirely in mime."

    with Akzidenz-Grotesk.

  body: "A former student of mine sent me this when it first came out.  My first curiosity
    was wondering what typefaces they chose.  When I saw the selection I knew that
    the director or writer's only knowledge of \"fonts\" came from Microsoft Word.
    \ All the chosen faces are readily available and constantly mangled by the PC
    users of the world.  Obviously the target for the piece was those very users,
    not designers.\r\n\r\nI'm curious what it would have looked like and how inside
    the jokes would have been had it been written and produced by true typophiles.
    \ Not to mention the palette of faces.\r\n\r\nNot type related, but if you've
    never seen the first couple of installments of \"Truth in Advertising\" you'll
    appreciate the industry inside humor: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j50Xd40EfJg
