  I am certain the typeface selected for these landing pages has been used somewhere,
  sometime in a logo for a drugstore item like denture paste, pain cream, or something
  else, and maybe even something gross. \r\n\r\nBut I can't place it, can you? \r\n\r\nIt's
  Dharma Slab Extra Bold Italic. \r\n\r\nThanks, \r\nLauren Vandervelde"
