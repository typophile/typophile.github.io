    I don't know of any folding equipment that is \"perfect\" -- trimming either,
    for that matter. I think the old standard was 3/64 (inch), but you don't see much
    even that good these days.\r\n\r\nI'd also note that book printers usually specialize
    into very short run (under, say, 600 copies), short run (under, say, 5,000 copies,
    sometimes 3,000), and long run. Most of the long-run printers will have binding
    equipment at their plant, but some of the short-run printers have to sub out casebinding.\r\n\r\nIf
    the book is under 5,000 copies, you might make an inquiry of Thomson-Shore\r\n\r\nhttp://www.thomsonshore.com\r\n\r\nBe

  body: "Your web page says it is printed at Sheridan. Is that just placeholder copy?\r\n\r\nWith
    today's platemaking/imposition equipment, back-up of pages is generally excellent.
    But as Charles points out, the folding is the problem. This is the least precise
    operation in the book printing process. Those big press sheets go through that
    folder at lightning speed, bumping into the {I'm not sure what the proper term
    is for this machine part, so I'll call them . . .} \"guards\" and onto the next
    fold. So while pages may back up perfectly, the alignment of running heads or
    first text lines from one signature to the next, and within signatures will be
    less than perfect.\r\n\r\nYou do not get perfection from a printer such as Sheridan
    or Thomson-Shore. You get damn good commercial book printing at good prices and
    reasonable schedules. But you will not get your casebound book in less than 5
    weeks unless you do some special pleading. If you want perfection you'll have
    to try one of the really top-notch German or Italian printers. Take a big bag
    of money with you.\r\n\r\nI designed and managed production on an Oak Knoll book
    a few years ago. I was under the impression that they always used Sheridan. The
    printing on that book came out well. I also work with Transcon: prices not so
    good as Sheridan or T-S, but the work is good. Also try Friesens in Altona, Manitoba
    or Maple-Vail, an excellent shop.\r\n\r\nI gotta catch a bus. I may have more
    to add in an hour or so when I get to the salt mine.\r\n\r\npowers"

  body: "I think all of us who routinely deal with Thomson-Shore, Sheridan, Friesens,
    Maple Vale, Edwards Brothers, etc. have our favorites. Our reasons are almost
    never ones that point to a \"clearly better\" printer. \r\n\r\nFor example: some
    have an excellent price, but a relatively untrained person on the preflight program.
    That can cost you time; in fairness, it can also save you problems in that you
    get to review EVERYTHING the preflight program kicks out. 90+% of what's raised
    in preflight is trivial, you'd tell them to run the job, but you'll spend time
    tracking the thing down. Some printers, like some comps, make reasonable assumptions.
    That cuts down the number of issues raised, but at a slightly increased risk of
    miscommunication or error. Etc.\r\n\r\nFor example: some printers don't publish,
    or won't work with you, on dotgain. Saying the dotgain is \"20%\" doesn't tell
    you much about the shape of the total curve. Yup, it is 20% at 50% black, but
    the curve is far from a straight or \"pre-definable\" line. Etc.\r\n\r\nFor example:
    some printers routinely stock the paper you want. Etc.\r\n\r\nFor example, some
    printers use a slightly grayer ink -- pluses and minuses.\r\n\r\nEtc."

    Yes, it says Sheridan and it may still be Sheridan. It started when they wanted
    to charge for a press check. Then the samples they sent weren't very good (Oak
    Knoll said). I just found today they're going to send more (different binding)
    samples to Oak Knoll. Though I'd like to approve everything, my hands are tied.
    I didn't think it would be necessary to negotiate quality control into my publishing
    contract.\r\n\r\nWe're attempting something difficult with these thumb margin
    bleeds, but someone has to be able to do it. I'm worried about that part more
    than ink coverage since you'll be able to see it en masse down the foreedge. I'd
    like to keep those thumb tabs if at all possible.\r\n\r\nAt this rate, within
    ten years, American printing's \"allowable margin of error\" will reach 30%. The
    equipment will be made entirely of old used up pressman's thumbs and elbows.\r\n\r\nThanks

  body: "Theodore,\r\n\r\nWhat Will and I (& others) are trying to gently say is that
    what you ask is impossible -- That was my wife's term; she's been involved in
    book printing even longer than I, and specializes in helping people who lack some
    area of knowledge in bringing a (book) project to it's end. Sometimes, when the
    project & budget require it, she winds up making the trip to Europe for a press
    check, sometimes the need is to deliver 100 copies in a few days for a museum
    opening, the rest to be printed conventionally for sale. There are all kinds of
    *perfects*.\r\n\r\nAs to negotiating quality control in a contract, you first
    have to know what is possible, then what is reasonable, esp. for a certain cost.
    I know a lot of people who specify certain composition standards who do not in
    fact know what is possible with setting a text -- they try to impose limitations
    on spacebands in H&J along with rules about what can and cannot be hyphenated,
    number of hyphens in a row, on & on. There are all kinds of tricks I can play
    if a customer is willing to pay for the handwork, but in the end, you will always
    have compromises with a text; you reach a point where you either have to set the
    text as written or rewrite it.\r\n\r\nWell, that is composition, where I defer
    to few. Will Powers has the hands-on expertise in printing, so I'll defer to him
    there.\r\n\r\nAs for your current problem with Sheridan, ask what their standard
    is -- ask what they can hold. If it is 3/64ths, that means your thumbnail bleeds
    are off by a maximum of a touch over 3 points, & what shows is on the edge away
    from the binding. Binding & paper have flex, even if it could be perfect imposition,
    folding & binding, it wouldn't always *appear* that way.\r\n\r\nOak Knoll, like
    other publishers, use Sheridan for a reason. That reason is price. "

    \"digital blues\"? Or when you're at the plant, see a sample of each sheet as
    it first comes off the press (after running enough sheets to get the inking right),
    approve it, or make changes, sometimes meaning a new plate, before running that

    Glossary of Typesetting Terms</em> is a great book. It was indispensable for fact
    checking and comparison while writing my book.\r\n\r\nThanks for bringing that
    to my attention. Thinking down that line, I'm now looking at the thumb tabs on
    Eckersley's <em>The Telephone Book</em>.\r\n\r\nI meant your latter idea of press
    check: stepping foot in the press room. Make friends with the pressman, break
    out the loops, get my hands dirty, shoot the shit, and take smoke breaks.\r\n\r\nI
    like your term \"digital blues.\" The first time I received one of those, I thought
    it was a joke, then I got <em>blue</em>.\r\n\r\nI like press rooms. Plants, not
    so much (but I guess they're necessary for the jumbo jobs). My favorite small
    shop unfortunately had to close its doors a few years back after the junky pressman
    went on a bender and never came back. Three different freelance pressmen couldn't
    get the press running correctly after his departure. They found the press had
    been fixed, or rather rigged to work by cramming screwdrivers and bubble gum in
    it.\r\n\r\nFueled by cocaine and smack, my man the junky played that two color
    Ryobi like a violin. We printed a <em>four</em> color job with flawless registration
    and sent it off to the binders. In the end, it was masterpiece. I sure do miss
    him.\r\n\r\n"

  body: "REGISTRATION: Now I see what you are getting at. You have thumb tabs that
    have to back up since they show on versos and rectos. So, OK: you can get them
    backed-up well on the sheet. But there will be some variation from page to page
    in each section the thumb tabs define. That's inevitable because of folding variances.
    As we've said earlier.\r\n\r\nI'm looking right now at a book we published that
    has two-color thumb tabs (printed on rectos only, on a web press). As soon as
    the designer came up with the idea, I pointed out that there'd be some variation
    within the 25-30 pages called out by each thumb tab. Fine with me. I had no problem,
    and no one else squawked. It was part of a trade-off involving money and time.\r\n\r\nPRESS
    CHECK: Are you sure they did not say they'd charge $400 for a \"press test,\"
    meaning that they'd print a sample sig for you ahead of the full run so you can
    make sure the thing will come out as you want it to? That is a common practice;
    it is what I do when I print a book of duotones in North America: I have them
    gang lots of the art onto a sheet, with some type, and have them run that. The
    usual cost is indeed about $400. That's a \"press test\" in my jargon.\r\n\r\nBut
    when I am in the press room with the pressman, checking the first sheets of each
    sig, that's a \"press check.\" No printer worth its salt should charge for that.
    In fact, the really good ones will have an apartment with a kitchen stocked with
    food basics, a wireless set-up, and a good TV available for you over the days
    you'll be there. At Transcontinental's plant in Beauceville, Quebec, they have
    a sweet suite right in the printing plant. It make a press check so easy. But

    when you look at the foredge. The book was notch bound, so, yes, sigs were notched
    and folded as they came off the web. All this is acceptable for this title.\r\n\r\nWeb
    is cheaper and faster than sheetfed; that can often be a factor. In general web
    work is not as good for halftones as sheetfed, but many printers are getting better
    results on web presses. I do not have a general attitude about whether to print
    web or sheet. Each book is judged on its own needs. \r\n\r\nALSO: I just checked
    with my man at Sheridan. They do not charge for \"press checks,\" when you are
    in the press room while the book is running. They do charge for \"press tests\"
    as I described them above. They will help folks get discounts at hotels.\r\n\r\nI
    never do a press check on a single-color book. You are going to have to live with
    some bounce on the back-up and registration of those thumb tabs if you work with
    any of the standard North American book printers such as those mentioned earlier
    in his thread. And a press check will not reveal the extent of the bounce. You
    will only see that when you see sample bound books. \r\n\r\npowers"

    good, not perfect. This was a 2-color job; I assume sheet-fed, but could have
    been web, I suppose -- too long ago to recall.\r\n\r\nThe variance is probably
    going to be greatest when crossing actual signatures. \r\n\r\nThe other thing
    to consider is not to make the tab element too shallow or too narrow. The deeper
    (i.e., taller) the tab, the less the bounce will seem. Also, if a tab element
    is too narrow, then you're more likely to notice the variations in edge trim.
    Binding creep and how many pages in the signature will affect how much variance
    in trim. I would be prepared for as much as 4&#150;6 points difference there too.\r\n\r\nSo,
