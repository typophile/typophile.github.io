body: I am submitting a file to a printer who does not do trapping and I know very
  little about it. I'm wondering if I can get advice from anyone out there about how
  to manually set a trap. I'm using Adobe Illustrator. Basically, I've got a cmyk
  blue knock-out square adjacent to a 100% black knock-out square. There's small reversed
  type in the black square, so I want to leave it 100% black. Is the solution simply
  putting a thin overprinting blue stroke (same cmyk values as the blue specified
  above) right where the colors touch? Any advice would be appreciated.

    how to trap but just not want to offer that service? You might want to shop around
    for a different printer.\r\n\r\nIf you are not experienced with trapping, I would
    leave it to someone more experienced.\r\n\r\nTry to find the book \"Getting It
    Printed\"."

    I'm not sure why they don't trap, but the specs specifically say they won't. The
    budget was spent on art, so there's nothing left for a service bureau....\r\n\r\nI'm
    attaching a gif of the situation.\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/trap_5579.gif]"

  body: "Hi Caj, \r\n\r\nYou're spot on with your proposed solution above. A small
    overprinting stroke in the blue will do the trick. Just apply it to which ever
    shape is on top in your artwork. Also make sure that your Black settings in Illustrator
    aren't set to auto overprint, or auto generate rich blacks. (See preferences)."

  body: "Thanks! Good to know.\r\n\r\nFYI, I noticed Illustrator CS has a trapping
    tool in the pathfinder palette that seems interesting... \r\n\r\nDidn't see anything
    about auto generating rich black or auto overprinting in the preferences, though.
    Maybe that's a different version of Illustrator.\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: Forget the stroke, change the 100K to 100K 68C and 38M youll get a nice rich
    black and you can forget about trapping problems.
