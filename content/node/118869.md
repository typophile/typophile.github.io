  body: Just a sidenote now after Dick's brilliant identification of 'Cyclones'. 'Cyclones'
    is an exclusive typeface for [[http://www.cyclones.com/pdf3/91103.pdf|Iowa State
    Athletics]] and can't be used for any purpose else. Now judging by the complete
    alphabet, 'Cyclones' is definitely based of Berthold City.

  body: "Ryuk: I generally always agree with you, especially on the \"brilliant\"
    part, but it was unclear whether this font was digitized from the university pdf
    or stolen from the athletic department. \r\n\r\nThere is also some controversy
    whether their alumni accept this design or not.\r\n\r\nCould still be based on
    City, of course.\r\n\r\nD"
