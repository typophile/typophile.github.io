  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">I've been working on a logo for a friend's small architectural firm&hellip; only I haven't been doing much. All I've done is set their name in a typeface that I thought they'd like&hellip; is that common? I feel like I'm getting off really easy on this one, but, the examples of logos they showed me all looked like they'd been done the same way. Here it is : <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/7737.gif" alt=""> <BR> <BR>So, there you have it. Your thoughts/comments are welcome.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">It's conservative, if that's the impression the client wants to project. It is closer to what I might expect from a law firm. <BR> <BR>Architecture is an interesting field to design for (I made some signage for an architect who had her office next to Tiro for several years). On the one hand, architects need to project competence and reliability &ndash; to reassure people that their buildings will stand up &ndash;, which suggests a conservative treatment, but on the other hand they need to be seen as creative and innovative. <BR> <BR>What kind of architecture does this firm practice? If it is mainly domestic, the appropriate design might be quite different from that for a firm that specialises in offices or commercial properties. Do they favour particular construction techniques or materials? <BR> <BR>Whatever the answer to these questions, I suspect that Minion is a poor choice of typeface. I would look for something less common and with more presence. Minion is not a bad text typeface (although it is overused), but it has too little character for a logo. Andy Crewdson memorably called Minion 'the typeface without qualities'. <BR> <BR>Personally, I would be tempted to deconstruct the fleuron. You could render it as an outline, in pencil, as an architectural plan, perhaps including some guidelines or measurement lines. You could even get a bit cubist, and try to combined a plan and elliptical projection of the fleuron into a single image. Lots of possibilities.</div>
