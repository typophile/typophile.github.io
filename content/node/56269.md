body: I have a client that needs to be able to visualize a pagination and shuffle
  things around for a multi-page publication. ONLY page numbers and page titles. It
  has to be extremely easy to use. Can anyone recommend a solution for this? I'd think
  it could be done in MS Word. But i get greatly frustrated with that program within
  minutes of opening it.

  body: Ben's low-tech method is by far the easiest method. But if you require asynchronous
    collaboration I'd say Tiff's approach is a viable solution. However it's success
    would depend on how familiar your audience is with using Acrobat Pro and knowing
    how to move pages around within it.

  body: "Like it or not, you can also do this very easily in PowerPoint, which allows
    you a variety of ways of looking at page thumbnails.\r\n\r\nFor the magazine layouts
    at work we have sheets of paper with post-it notes citing article titles. These
    are in plastic sheet protectors in a binder. The page protectors have numbers
    on them in marker and we just shuffle the contents around between the protectors
    until we get an structure we like. You don't really need the sheet protectors
    (you could write the page numbers on the paper), but it keeps the post it notes
    safe when moving it around."
