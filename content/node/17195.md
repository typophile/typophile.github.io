body: "Hello everyone\r\n\r\nI am new to Typophile and this is my first post. I am
  glad to be here. I have an OpenType features related problem. I want to make the
  following substitutions:\r\n\r\n1 + 0 with a glyph called 1_0\r\n1 + 0 + 0 with
  a glyph called 1_0_0 and\r\n1 + 0 + 0 + 0 with a glyph called 1_0_0_0\r\n\r\n(1
  and 0 can be replaced by any digit - see code below)\r\n\r\nI work in Fontlab Studio
  5 and I at first I wrote the following code:\r\n\r\n# glyph classes\r\n@digitsnozero=[one
  two three four five six seven eight nine];\r\n@digits=[zero one two three four five
  six seven eight nine];\r\n@twodigits=[X X_X X_X_X X_L L L_X L_X_X L_X_X_X X_C];\r\n@threedigits=[C
  C_C C_C_C C_C_C_C D D_C D_C_C D_C_C_C D_C_C_C_C];\r\n@fourdigits=[M M_M M_M_M M_M_M_M];\r\n\r\nfeature
  liga { \t\r\n# substitutions for two digits\t\r\nsub @digitsnozero' @digits by @twodigits;\t\r\n#
  substitutions for three digits\r\nsub @digitsnozero' [@digits @twodigits @threedigits]
  @digits by @threedigits;\r\n# substitutions for four digits\r\nsub [one two three
  four]' [@digits @twodigits @threedigits] \r\n@digits @digits by @fourdigits;\r\n}
  liga;\r\n\r\nThe problem is that when the first rule is activated the other two
  are ignored. As a result I only get the first substitution (1 + 0 -> 1_0)\r\n\r\nI
  solved the problem by putting each rule in a different feature (the first in onum,
  the second in smcp and the third in liga - it works).\r\n\r\nSo now I have the following:\r\n\r\nfeature
  onum {  \r\n# substitutions for two digits\t\r\nsub @digitsnozero' @digits by @twodigits;\r\n}
  onum;\r\n\r\nfeature smcp {\r\n# substitutions for three digits\r\nsub @digitsnozero'
  [@digits @twodigits @threedigits] @digits by @threedigits;\r\n} smcp;\r\n\r\nfeature
  liga { \t\r\n# substitutions for four digits\r\nsub [one two three four]' [@digits
  @twodigits @threedigits] @digits @digits by @fourdigits;\r\n} liga;\r\n\r\nI read
  in the OpenType specification about the Chaining Context Substitution but I did
  not understand how am I supposed to do it.\r\n\r\nCan anyone tell me if I can put
  all the three rules in one feature (e.g. in a liga feature)? Can I do anything with
  'lookup'?\r\n\r\nGeorge Triantafyllakos - backpacker.gr"

  body: I believe the solution is to reverse the order of your substitutions. Start
    with the longest (1_0_0_0) and work down.

    body: "Oh God! It worked ...\r\n\r\nI can't believe it was so easy!! (I thought
      I tried it but I didn't and I 've been trying for the last 6 hours for a solution)\r\n\r\nMark,
      thank you very much!\r\n\r\nGeorge Triantafyllakos - backpacker.gr"

    not always obvious.

    first, which is why "ffi" and "ffl" are before "ff", "fi", and "fl". (Which is
    pretty much the opposite of what happens when you''re typing. Which is why you
    should always write OT code while drunk.)'
