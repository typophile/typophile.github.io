  to the city of Manchester (UK). Recent history is easy - Peter Saville etc, but
  I've drawn a blank with anything that might speak to the city's Victorian and early
  c20th history - \r\n\r\nCould anyone suggest any typographers, typefaces, etc that
  might be relevant?\r\n\r\nMany thanks in advance!"

  body: "GJ\r\n\r\nOne of the finest lettering artists and teachers from Manchester
    was Tony Forster. He also designed, as well as consulted on, type with the likes
    of Phill Grimshaw (deceased), also from Manchester and Colin Brignall with Letraset.
    Tony passed away only weeks ago, sadly. Many are indebted to Tony; and, his work
    is/was Brilliant, and not in the overused sense. You might wish to contact Timothy
    Donaldson who is also in the area.\r\n\r\nThis may not speak to the city's Victorian
    ethos but he definitely was a Manchester titan. Thank you for posting this as
    it has suddenly helped me, as I am struggling with his obituary this week for
    an international publication... titan is appropriate.\r\n\r\nMichael"

  body: "Michael\r\n\r\nWhat sad timing. Sincere thanks for introducing me to Forster,
    and for the reminder of Grimshaw - it certainly seems appropriate to reference
    them in the work we're doing. Willow is already a very familiar typeface to me
    as a resident of the city - I shall look for its unforced decorative sopistication
    particularly fondly in future.\r\n\r\nFor me of the great strengths of the city
    is the way it reconciles its heritage with a very modern attitude, so this kind
    of work is highly relevant... though I'm still very much hoping to dig up some
    earlier typographical reference as well.\r\n\r\nOne again, many thanks for your
    kind help\r\n\r\nGuy"

  body: "You may want to check out the Washington Calligraphers Guild. I did several
    editions of Scripsit and highlighted the work of Tony, Phill, Stephen Raw and
    Peter Horridge, Stayed with Tony a couple of years ago when I taught in the North
    and then went to Roehampton to lecture/teach. His studio was incredible. Six foot
    piles of paper and books everywhere and a tiny path to his table.\r\n\r\nHe was
    a wonderful man. After I did the article we became great friends and talked every
    other Saturday for 12 years. What a wealth of info he was and OH what a prankster!\r\n\r\nMichael"

    about the close correlation between studios knee deep in *stuff* and genius...\r\n\r\nHe
    sounds like quite an inspiration. On the strength of your postings here, I don't
    think you need worry that the obituary you're writing will communicate the depth
    of your warmth and affection for him :-)\r\n\r\nvery best regards, condolences
    on the loss and thanks again\r\n\r\nguy"

  body: "Hi I have just registered on this site and the first posting I see is that
    Tony Forster had passed away back in June. Is this the same Tony Forster who was
    from the UK, and taught at Bolton College of Art, Bolton, Greater Manchester UK
    starting back in the 70's and then for 25 years?\r\n\r\nIf yes can someone confirm
    this for me as it would be greatly appreciated. Tony was my Tutor/Mentor at college
    between 77 - 81, and then in the early part of my career.\r\n\r\nIs there somewhere
    where I could send a message of condolence?\r\n\r\nThanks."
