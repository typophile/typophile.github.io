body: "Hi everyone,\r\n\r\nI graduated last year in Digital Media at London Metropolitan
  University and really want to work in graphic design and illustration.\r\n\r\nI
  have some freelance experience creating new website for a law firm, creating all
  graphical content (service logo, letterheads, business cards etc) for an NHS Mental
  Health Service. They now want me to develop their web presence and I've just bagged
  another client - an indie venue in North London.\r\n\r\nI am also working on two
  personal projects: SCHOOLYARDRULES! An online graphic novel based on three characters
  from Hackney which is due to go live soon. This can be viewed on my online portfolio
  (www.daveyrockstar.co.uk) or through a Facebook Search: ShoolYardRules!\r\n\r\nThe
  other is a Gonk's Tale, An interactive children's book, again, accessible at my
  online portfolio: www.daveyrockstar.co.uk.\r\n\r\nI'm in the process of putting
  together my CV but am a bit stuck, as apart from the recent freealnce work, I don't
  have agency experience. I currently work in IT Project Management and have done
  throughout my studies, but now really want to make the jump...\r\n\r\nCan anyone
  help? Offer advice or even a job?\r\n\r\n\r\nRegards\r\n\r\nDavid McDonagh\r\nPortfolio:
