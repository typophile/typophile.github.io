  body: "1) True\r\n\r\n2) False - It's being used for a commercial business, it's
    a commercial use . . . Even if you're not getting paid for the logo (which you
    likely are if they're a client), a commercial use license is required.\r\n\r\n3)
    True"

  body: "Thanks, just wanted to clarify.\r\nI guess it depends on the font designer/foundry
    then. \r\nGenerally speaking, making a logo is considered as commercial use, but
    some designer/foundry might consider making a logo as personal use."

    any foundry that would consider logo design work different than any other commercial
    design work.\r\n"

  body: Indeed. Insofar as some foundries consider logo design to be different from
    other types of commercial design work, it is usually considered a premium. Some
    foundries require special licensing for a font to be used as a substantial part
    of a corporate identity.

    or PDF-files.

  body: "Actually, I'd say 1) false, 2) false (since in that question you were asking
    if it was personal use), 3) false. Because while 1) and 3) are definitely not
    personal use, they aren't covered by authorization for commercial use either.\r\n\r\nIf
    you have a license for commercial use, you can do (2): make a logo for a client
    for which you get paid.\r\n\r\nIf you have a license for commercial use that also
    permits PDF embedding - <strong>reasonably</strong> common, but not true of all
    commercial use licenses, you can do (3): embed it in a PDF that you distribute.\r\n\r\nIf
    you want to do (1), use the font internally in some software you will distribute,
    you will have to negotiate a special contract with the font provider in most cases.
    (I've run across one company that charges $69 for a font and $690 for a license
    to do this, so there <em>are</em> cases where this type of licensing is routine.
    I believe the company makes fonts of comic book typefaces.)"

  body: I believe that Adobe Acrobat (the application that pros would use to make
    a PDF in many situations) doesn't permit the embedding of fonts unless that font
    permits it; that menu option is automatically grayed out.
