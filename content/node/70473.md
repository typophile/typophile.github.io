  body: "It looks a lot like a customized <a href=\"http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/ef/caslon-black/\">Caslon
    Black</a>, with the serifs flattened at the top of stems, as in the n, i and r.
    \ It may be another typeface, but that would let you reproduce this, with a minimum
    amount of tweaking.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega\r\n\r\n"
