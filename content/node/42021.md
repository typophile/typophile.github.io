body: "hi there\r\nI'm currently working on a catalogue for a client of ours.\r\nThe
  used font family is tobias frere-jones' gotham.\r\nIt all works fine until i have
  to create tables with \r\nnumbers. None of them seem to line up (as in full-stop\r\nand
  the numbers). Is there a special version of gotham \r\nto fix this problem, or does
  anyone know of a good \r\nworkaround? Is it possible for me to change the spacing\r\nin
  the font itself?\r\n\r\n\r\nThanks a lot\r\nJ\xF6rg\r\n\r\n"

  body: What software application are you using? There are different workarounds for
    different apps. The first one I can think of is to insert a tab stop before each
    and every digit/number, and manually set the tabs very close together... a pain,
    but do-able in a pinch.
