You really should consider getting a professional graphic designer to help you out. Perhaps one of your customers is a designer, or some fellow business owners could suggest someone. It's money well spent. And perhaps they'd even be willing to do some of the work in trade.

		<div class="commentbody">Number 1 or 2 for me, but I agree with what others said about you needing to rein things in a bit. Try actually sketching out ideas on paper (if you haven't already) before looking at typefaces. Get a feeling in your head of how you want it to look first before actually looking. 

It appears that you're suffering from typeface paralysis—you have a ton to choose from and the more you wander through your type library the less and less certain you are about your choices. I didn't see any after page one that did anything different or useful. </div>

		<div class="commentbody">It would help to see it bigger, but my first impression is that the 2 lines are fighting for dominance, with the 1st line (sugar) being larger, but the 2nd line being bolder.  If the words are not identical in importance, then you want to have a clear hierarchy of importance. So if you want "sugar" to be the focal point of the logo, I would tone down "bakery & cafe", perhaps by making it less bold.

Also the letterspacing needs work. For example, compare the narrow space between SU with the wide space between GA.

The vivid pink stripes in the background seem overpowering.  I know you use them as a background on your website, so perhaps they aren't part of the logo itself, but either way you might want to experiment making them more pastel.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I like it. I agree with JamesM that you need to make BAKERY & CAFE thinner so it doesn't outcompete Sugar. Also, try looking at the logo without the striped background - you won't always be able to use it with the background (unless you can afford fancy full-color-printed paper bags, cups, stickers, etc., and only advertise in full-color publications).

Also, the dotted outline collides with the solid outline in a few places. Try printing the logo very small and see how those dots look. You might need to make the dots bigger/farther apart/farther from the solid line. Are you doing this in Illustrator? At some point you'll have to convert everything to outlines, so if your borders are single vector lines with a thickness and/or dotted pattern applied, you'll need to settle on a relative dot spacing/line width that will work at all sizes. (I didn't explain that very well).

If/when you do place the logo over the stripes, it might look nicer if the edges of the logo don't collide with the edges of the stripes (i.e., make the edges of the logo fall in the middle of a stripe).

The logo will be on our stickers, our business card, and web site which are full color so they will appear with the pink stripes. I will certainly tweak the size/scale of the stripes to minimize the awkward positioning. the "bone" color will simply be toothy natural stock, and so because we're using that paper, the stripes will also hopefully look a bit more rustic or distressed. </div>

As Frode Frank said it's a little generic.  Personally I'd emphasize "sugar", or emphasize "sugar bakery"  and make "and cafe" subordinate.

Are you trying for a rustic or distressed look?  At your site you posted 3 style examples you admired and they had more of an ornate victorian look.</div>

I'd suggest making "Sugar Bakery" larger within the oval. And make "& Cafe" larger (maybe starting it around the middle of the "k").

The URL and phone number are too small (unless the whole logo is printed very large, like on a sign); I'd move them below the oval and make them larger. If you do that, you may need to change the proportion of the oval or add a decorative element where they were.

The line weight of the oval looks slightly heavy to me relative to the type.

Okay. If you haven't tried this already, print some actual-size mockups and ask a few folks if the small type is legible. If any of your customers are middle aged or older, include those age groups in the test. 

Also keep in mind that there may be situations were you must print the logo very small, like in a small web ad or newspaper ad. You may need an alternate version for those situations.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I'm feeling like I'm not being understood, which is sometimes tricky on a forum. I"m designing for 2 different instances of the logo.

The pink/pink stripes are part of my brand, so I THINK I want them on my sticker, but then on the WEB SITE, I'd rather have the stripes exist on the background. 

My question is, does it make sense to have these different versions of the "logo"? [img:sites/default/files/old-images/logo_2011_6_5058.jpg]</div>

One suggestion — In the top one the type fits comfortably in the oval; in the bottom one there's a tad too much white space.  You might consider moving the type up to the same place it is in the sticker version, and then placing a decorative swash at the bottom (to occupy the same space that the 2 lines do in the sticker version). Or some other adjustment to reduce the white space a bit. </div>

		<div class="commentbody">I understand the difference between the two — the version for the website feels better to me. I'm not sure I agree about there being too much white space. 

What color are the boxes / bags you use at the bakery? (How will the sticker look on the packaging as background?) 

Another question regarding the sticker: is a web address / phone number necessary? If after deep thought on that question, your answer is yes, have you thought about just putting the web address and phone number on the sticker alone? (sans logo?) Just floating some ideas out there.</div>
