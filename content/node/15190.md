body: "Hello everybody. \r\n\r\nCould you please tell me your opionions and critiques
  about this logo?\r\nIt is made for a Bulgarian organization, which is focused on
  house music. \r\nTheir site has a forum, a lot of information about parties and
  articles about the mucis.\r\nYou could say that they are sort of lika a serious
  fan club...\r\nI decided that this is (so far) my best idea for this project, but
  I am interested to know your opinions as well.\r\n\r\nIn a general outline of a
  house (word-play), I've drawn a prespective view of a music speaker, in order to
  establish a connection with the music. On the other panel of the speaker I've drawn
  the bold letter \"H\", to \"suggest\" the name of the \"House\" music.\r\nThe logo
  has to be both serious to a certain degree, and fun. This is why I've used triangular
  element as well as a square.\r\n\r\n\r\nThank you in advance for your help!\r\nCheers."

    of a house shape and the perspective of the speakers works well, and it feels
    both a little fun and serious. \r\n\r\nThe only thing that bugs me is the concentric
    rings for the speakers in your black and white version. The line weights are so
    thin and so close together that it creates a lot of tension. This is especially
    true for the top group of circles.\r\n\r\nThe tension doesn't happen in your color
    version because 1) you have less rings, 2) the line weight is heavier, and 3)
    it is grey instead of stark black and white. \r\n\r\nMaybe use less circles in
    your black and white version?"

  body: "Thank you for your time, bluealgae!\r\n\r\nYes, the detail might be a little
    too much in the speaker part.\r\nI will try to simplyfy the detail, withou losing
    the \"shape\" of the speakers. This way in the black and white version as specialy,
    I'll elminate the problem with the thin lines close to each other...\r\nThank
    you for your advice :)"

  body: "They are working well, the cone perspective of the speakers needs a bit of
    work, at the moment they look a bit like flat circles on the side rather than
    indented. I get the feeling that you should try 3 point perspective, the sides
    are parallel at the moment if the bottom narrowed, you could get a more monumental
    feeling.\r\nTim"

  body: The speakers currently make the shape look like a box camera. Loose the circle
    shapes that make them look like lenses. I also suggest testing the logo in its
    smallest size you will use it and see if the speakers hold up as speakers.

    here are the changes I've made.\r\nI personaly like it better now.\r\n\r\nhttp://i13.photobucket.com/albums/a269/ByteSize/Logov2.jpg\r\n\r\ntimd,
    I did try a 3 point prospective, but the house siluet started to look more like
    a tribal hut :)\r\n\r\nC&C are welcome :)"

  body: My only comment is the mark gets lost in smaller sizes. Try using just the
    name and the speaker circles that you modified. Nice stuff

  body: "A good improvement, the speakers are much clearer, it might be my monitor
    but the grey is looking overall very dark, you might want to introduce more contrast
    in the tints. And the stroke on the right of the H isn't reflected on the left
    (the leading edge), I think on the colour version you could do without the stroke.
    Definitely almost there.\r\n\r\nA tribal hut would definitely lose impact:)\r\n\r\nTim"

    the next update (hopefuly) soon, if I'm not to busy with some other projects ...\r\n\r\nI
    have one question though.\r\ndan weaver, what do you mean by \"the mark gets lost\"?
    \r\nDo you mean that the details are lost? \r\nAnd also: Do you suggest that I
    should use the \"old\" (the once from version one) cyrcles instead, in the smaller
    versions of the logo? "
