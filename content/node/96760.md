  to find any information on it. It seems like the kind of font you'd see in a logo
  for  businesses related to construction/hardware/trucking; I've seen it used in
  such a manner, but I can't recall any specifics. It has a very distinctive A; so
  distinctive that I'd bet an expert would be able to identify the typeface from the
  A alone.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://dl.dropbox.com/u/8656753/stype.png\">"
