  I didn't know of any digital type, but I thought something could be found in the
  work of Boris Schatz's original Betzalel School, or perhaps something could be engineered
  from the work of Arthur Szyk. But I also thought that a few of you who enjoy this
  forum might share your knowledge of art nouveau Hebrew type and whether any digital
  fonts were ever made.\r\n\r\nAharon"
