    Silva is an award-winning graphic and typeface designer based in Monterey, California.
    He has received national and international recognition for his work, including
    a Bronze Cannes Lion for his collaboration on the graphic production of a campaign
    directed by JWT Buenos Aires.\r\n\r\nNicol\xE1s graduated with honors from the
    University of the Andes in Venezuela with a BA in graphic design. Later, he received
    a postgraduate certificate in typeface design from the University of Buenos Aires
    in Argentina. For his final project, he created the font Poly, which was selected
    for display at the Ibero American Design Biennale and listed as one of the Behance
    Most Appreciated Projects of 2012.\r\n</blockquote>\r\nAnd from the font itself\r\n<blockquote>\r\nPoly
    is a medium contrast condensed serif font. However unlike many serif fonts, it
    has very short ascenders and a very high x hight. Poly is very efficient in small
    sizes. Thanks to its careful balance between the x height and the glyph width,
    it allows more economy and legibility than standard web serifs, even in small
    sizes. This font was originally designed to compose texts in agglutinative languages,
    which contain very long words. The goal was to develop a typeface that would tolerate
    cramped tracking and that would increase the number of letters that enter in a
    single line.\r\n</blockquote>"

    reduce unpleasant surprises. Sort of how using an EM of 1000 for PS and 2048 for
    TT is <em>still</em> a Good Idea (barring force majeure).\r\n\r\nNow, if it's
    a <em>production</em> file that's meant to be easy to modify: it must be made
    crystal clear that it's not supposed to be deployed as-is; and one would expect
    <em>all</em> glyphs with potential overlaps (like the \"M\") to feature separated

    must be ways to avoid unnecessary roadkill on the way to a better type design

    that you think is based on plagiarism, you could privately alert others to it
    and see if any of them can shed light on the matter. You could additionally approach
    the designers of suspicious typefaces themselves and see what they have to say
    in their defence. And: Is there any type design forum with restricted access that
    is not indexed by search engines? If so, that might be a place to discuss such
    cases. Typophile, I think, ranks fairly high on Google & Co. and a thread on plagiarism
    is not what you want on the first page of results as a young type designer\u2014particularly
    if you did not plagiarise. Also, I suggest to let go cases in which you cannot
    substantiate your instinct. I understand (and support) your inclination to name
    and shame actual offenders, but I think there is less to be gained from each copycat
    exposed than to be lost when rashly publishing allegations that have to be dismissed
