  a magazine... (a student magazine, mostly related to (classical) music). \r\nTwo
  images for two solutions... The first one uses Myriad Pro (+ Minion Pro for the
  body), and the second one uses Fertigo. \r\nWhich combination do you prefer?\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/fus_01_5616.jpg][img:sites/default/files/old-images/fus_02_5717.jpg]"

  body: "1. On #1, I wouldn't go with Myriad simply due to the fact that it's a default
    fonr for Illustrator thus it has somewhat of a generic look.\r\n\r\n2. On #2,
    it is traditionally considered poor typographic practice to use two serif's (or
    two sans) on the same page. If you want to go with a serif headline, simply use
    Minion. It's a great family.\r\n\r\n3. If you like Myriad as a sans, [[http://www.linotype.com/610683/neuefrutiger-family.html|Frutiger]]
    may be an alternate choice. Selecting \"humanistic\" looking sans' is somewhat
    tricky. Traditionally, [[http://www.linotype.com/1226/meridien-family.html|Meridiene]]
    is considered a good pair for Frutiger. And while writing this, I just discovered
    that [[http://www.linotype.com/|Linotype]] has a font called [[http://www.linotype.com/288768/frutigerserif-family.html|Frutiger
    Serif]]. I have not inspected it, but seeing as they're both designed by [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adrian_Frutiger|Adrian
    Frutiger]] (designer of [[http://www.linotype.com/53226/linotypeunivers-family.html|Univers]])
    and have the same given name, I am confidant they are good (and compatible) typefaces.\r\n\r\n3.
    [[http://www.linotype.com/searchresult?q=gill%20sans|Gill]] may also be another
    choice for a humanistic sans (I am not familiar with all thease versions). Traditionally
    [[http://www.linotype.com/1334/perpetua-family.html|Perpetua]] is considered to
    be a good pair.\r\n\r\n4. Understanding that the text is still [[http://www.lipsum.com/|Lipsum]]
    at this stage, you still want to be mindful of your hyphenation. Traditionally
    it is considered poor practice to have two hyphens in a row. You might also want
    to consider I prefer to hyphenate manually. Additionally, if possible, avoid hyphenating
    proper nouns. This can make for a pretty funky rag at shorter line lengths. Here's
    an example I use to illustrate hyphenation gone wrong:\r\n\r\n<em>I grew up on
    2536 Su-\r\nsex drive</em>.\r\n\r\n5. With capital letters, it is considered good
    practice to letterspace (track) them to assist in character recognition.\r\n\r\nOverall,
    the work looks great. A strong hierarchy, subtle and sophisticated and I applaud
    the setting of flush left as opposed to justified. I'd say you're 99% of the way
    there."

    makes a great pair for Minion.

  body: 'I agree with Christopher that Myriad looks a bit generic, it''s nice, but
    generic. I think Minion is a fine choice for your body copy, and would stick to
    picking a display face that pairs well with it. I think Frutiger is so close to
    Myriad, that it may not get you away from that generic look. I wouldn''t go with
    Fertigo, so if I had to pick one of these options, go with #1. Maybe use Myriad
    in all caps, or something to spice it up a bit? '

  body: "Thank you so much for your replies! I agree with Myriad beeing too generic,
    and Fertigo looking somehow wrong as the second serif... The problem for me always
    was finding a typeface with eastern european version (so that's why I stick to
    Myriad often :)).\r\n\r\nGill looks really  nice, it was one of my choices. But
    still, I find it a little bit too serious for this kind of magazine. What do you
    all think of Scala sans? Never thought of it until today, but I like the looks
    of it. Here's the sample...\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/fus_03_3598.jpg]"

  body: "I think Scala Sans is great for this. It's fairly neutral, but still has
    some character and is not overused.\r\n\r\nConsidering it will be mostly classical
    music, you could also try [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/adobe/poetica/|Poetica]],
    which works well with Minion, for pull quotes, and perhaps some display (like
    the name in your example, Mendam Paripse). The additional flavor might be good.
    Poetica has lots of alternate letters, and a nice set of small caps, with swash
    variants, if that's needed, though I usually like it without that.\r\n\r\nIt all
    comes in one Opentype file, and at about 30 dollars it's a great price.\r\n\r\nBri\xE4n"
