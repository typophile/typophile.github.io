  am really wide-open in terms of design here.

  body: Think <a href="http://www.mp3.com" target="_blank">www.mp3.com</a> or something
    similar.  A place where independent artists can go, talk to each other, promote
    their bands, etc.  I was thinking modern sans serif type fonts, clean design,
    etc., but I don&#39;t want to limit the discussion by saying so.  As I said before,
    I am wide-open in terms of design.
