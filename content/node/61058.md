  major release, \u2018Crewekerne\u2019-in the meantime we\u2019ve been having some
  fun trying it out in \u2018real-world\u2019 applications and we'd be greatful for
  any feedback or suggestions.\r\n\r\nCrewekerne offers a hand drawn Roman family
  intended to be in the best traditions of the \u2018Arts and Crafts\u2019 movement
  of the early 20th century.  Here are two specimens of Crewekerne in action:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Crewkerne_4214.png]\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Crewekerne_Gallery7

    of the early 20th century. Could be a very cool boutique logo design, or old packing
    design.\r\n\r\nI've seen the new comeback style of the 80s and earlier in the
    music, design, art and such ... and since the Woodstock movie coming out, I seen
    a lot of 80s hippy too.\r\n\r\n"
