  hoping you can help me name this font? I was watching Aliens again last night, and
  when this scene came on, I suddenly decided I must know the name of this font! :)\r\n\r\nAfter
  reading through some of the other font id threads, there is some serious talent
  on this board, so I have high hopes that you guys can help me.  =^D\r\n\r\nAll the
  best,\r\n\r\n\r\nKc"
