  can't find any MIME types for any font formats. The IANA registry list does not
  include any\r\n   http://www.iana.org/assignments/media-types/\r\n\r\nI see at one

  I presume that has since foundered as nothing seems to have come of it.\r\n\r\nSo
  are there any existing standards I can't find?\r\nIf not, would\r\n<ol>\r\n   <li>application/vnd.opentype\r\n
  \  <li>application/vnd.truetype\r\n   <li>application/vnd.pstype1\r\n</ol>\r\nseem
  reasonable MIME types to try and register?"

    fonts generated (or both?)\r\n\r\nSince FontForge's file format is cleartext,
    the MIME type could any of the following I think\r\n\r\ntext/x-fontforge\r\napplication/x-fontforge\r\napplication/vnd.fontforge-sfd\r\napplication/vnd.fontforge.sfd\r\n\r\nAlthough
    I think one of the latter two would be prefered in modern day coding.\r\n\r\n<em>\xABEl

  body: "Well the thing which started me looking into this was someone involved with
    freedesktop asking about fontforge's sfd. That seemed pretty simple, something
    like application/vnd.fontforge-sfd.\r\n\r\nBut if there were a convention for
    font types, then I should follow that. And if there is no convention for font
    types there should be.\r\n\r\nAnd that is really my question:\r\nNo one seems
    to have registered MIME types for the standard font formats with IANA. I think
    that should happen, otherwise there will be a proliferation of \"x-\" types with
    no consistency. Given that no one has done this, should there be a standard format
    like\r\n\r\napplication/vnd.font-truetype\r\napplication/vnd.font-opentype\r\n...\r\n\r\nor
    should things be just\r\n\r\napplication/vnd.truetype"

  body: "George, \r\n\r\nI think application/vnd.font-truetype is somewhat superflous.
    application/vnd.font-opentype obviously applies to both .otf and .ttf, and I can't
    think of a font that would need to have the MIME type application/vnd.font-truetype
    without it just being application/vnd.font-opentype. \r\n\r\nOn the other hand,
    PostScript Type 1 is by no way a standardized data structure. You have the Mac
    FFIL and LWFN resource fork structures, you have the .pfb and .pfa data fork structures
    along with the auxiliary files .pfm, .inf and .afm. \r\n\r\nI think it would do
    good to just forget any attempt to clean the old Type 1 mess up and just proposed
    one MIME type for the one font format that is currently of interest, that is ISO/IEC
    14496-22 (Open Font Format), also known as OpenType. \r\n\r\nAdam"

  body: "Thanks Adam, that's a good point. \r\n\r\nApple might disagree, since their
    TrueType 2.0 extentions are not part of OpenType, but for most purposes an 'sfnt'
    is an 'sfnt'. Best to avoid proliforation of MIME types. \r\n\r\nI still think
    there is a use to having a MIME type for type1 pf[ab], because there are still
    a lot around and the distinction between ASCII and Binary doesn't affect most
    font consumers (and the less common formats are ignorable).\r\n\r\nBut you are
    right that an OpenType MIME is the most important."

  body: "The \"x-\" namespace is inappropriate for opentype. It is for experimental
    stuff. And OpenType does not qualify as experimental.\r\n\r\nYes, a better approach
    would be to get someone from the ISO opentype group to register\r\n   application/font-opentype.\r\nAnd
    even better approach would be for someone from the ISO group to register a top-level
    MIME type for fonts and then register\r\n   font/opentype\r\nBoth of these require
    someone in an established standards group to spearhead the effort. The IANA will
    not accept requests from random people for such things.\r\n\r\nWhich is why I
    suggested \"vnd.\" -- because it is something which I could do without depending
    on others."
