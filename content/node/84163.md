  body: "It seems spaced a bit tight.\r\nMaybe a bit too mechanical in construction.\r\nNice
    Q, though! :-)"

  body: "The /u/ and /y/ are the only glyphs that loop. The /y/ looks like 'er' or
    'ej' or 'ejr' and the /u/ looks like 'ei'. I think it would be more consistent
    and more easily interpreted if they both had solid decorative tips instead of
    the open loops. Some of the confusion may be due to the very tight spacing that
    butts both of these letters up against their predecessor.\r\n\r\n"

  body: "I would say same thing as others on the \u201Cmechanical construction\u201D.
    For instance, the /D its a reverse /C with a bar. Same for the /a,n,d. Do not
    overuse the mirror effect. Some letters are pretty /Q,i,j,f,y.  Keep going."

  body: "There are not enough space between letters and the tail of the \"a\" and
    \"n\" is too close to the stems.\r\nThe \"U\" is very interesting."

  body: "imo it is too curvy and sexual. the downward stroke on the minoscule n has
    been re-used on too many of the other letters. I suggest you design a secondary
    way to give the curved strokes to the glyphs, such as m or x or whatnot, so that
    this large downward stroke on the n and in some other places is not recuced in
    value and beauty.\r\n\r\nimo\r\n\r\n\r\nmost of the capitals are pretty awesome,
    however."

  body: Agree with others - the spacing is uneven. The word spacing in your sample
    is much too large and the letter spacing too small. Hand-written forms need to
    have a strong rhythm, and that means considering the spacing of verticals as well
    as balancing the open counters. Agree with others that the repetition of the inner
    tendril is too obvious, needs more variation. But then I think you'll have something
    very interesting and worth-while.
