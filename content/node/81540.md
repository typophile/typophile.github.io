body: Examples are Barnbrook's "Newspeak" and the Monster Energy drink logo. Does
  this have any sort of historical background, or is it purely based in style?

  body: "The form of phi \u2013 \u03A6 \u2013 from the Greek alphabet is an historical
    antecedent for these English alternates. I don\u2019t think it has much to do
    with the letter O, though."

  body: "Plus, it helps to structure the inner whitespace. This way, you can have
    a larger (wider) O that doesn\u2019t look out of place when standing next to darker,
    denser letters like M. \r\nA dot would serve the same purpose, see for example
    Barnbrook\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.emigre.com/EF.php?fid=104\">Mason</a>, or
    Tiemann\u2019s <a href=\"http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/canadatype/orpheus-pro/\">Orpheus</a>
    (revived and extended by Canada Type). CastleType\u2019s <a href=\"http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/castletype/goudy-trajan/regular/characters.html\">Goudy
    Trajan</a> offers an alternate O with a cross in the counter.\r\n\r\nIt might
    also be worth looking at the \u2018O\u2019s in blackletter typefaces, e.g. <a
    href=\"http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/ef/alte-schwabacher/\">Alte Schwabacher</a>,
    <a href=\"http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/preusstype/fleischmann-gotisch-pt/\">Fleischmann
    Gotisch</a>, <a href=\"http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/adobe/goudy-text/\">Goudy
    Text</a>, <a href=\"http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/wiescherdesign/royal-bavarian/\">Royal
    Bavarian</a>."
