  fitting yoga short. Think speedo meets boxer briefs.  I have been beating my head
  against the wall and maybe someone here can open a door for me???? My problem is
  the x and whether it is x enough or not.\r\n"

  body: "I have Max shorts with 2 different versions of the logo, neither of them
    the one discussed here. \r\n\r\nI've gotta say the logo is the one thing I don't
    like about this short. The old version, shown here on the model: http://www.shopmaxnyc.com/about_max.html
    is unpretentious, maybe a little feminine-looking. But the newer version overcompensates
    with a retro-metal concept (similar to the logo design shown on the upper left
    on that page). I've seriously contemplated snipping the logo embroidery off my
    shorts. "

  body: "Yeah, it doesn't read as an x. It should be one piece, not 3. Two longer
    horizontal lines on the sides, and two shorter vertical lines on the top and bottom\r\n\r\nThat
    said, I think the concept might need to be addressed. Right now the lettering
    makes me think that this product might bend and squish my vital part into a rather
    uncomfortable position. Especially from the looks of that m--ouch!\r\n\r\nDavid"

    turned upside down and having legs dangling from the M because the M upside down
    looks like a pair of boxer shorts anyway. haha. '

  body: "I agree with adnik the logo conjures up the image of a fat butt squeezed
    into an uncompromising space. This is maybe true for many taking up yoga initially,
    but I am sure the overall projected image should be what those going to yoga aspire
    to. Fit, sleek, this doesnt necessarily mean slim, but always well formed. \r\n\r\nRemember
    this is more than typography this is branding, Stefan hit on another good point,
    the baseline for clothing branding is people have got to want to wear the brand,
    be seen wearing the brand, want to buy the brand and want to show off the brand.
    This is the premise clothing brands are built on, and when you have a particular
    focus like yoga pants, or indeed yoga, there is an aesthetic to aspire to. As
    a designer this is your target, to build, with what you create, as asset for your
    client."
