  body: What does that mean &#34;digitally rendered?&#34; I wonder why Parkinson&#39;s
    RS Logo on Ortiz-Lopez&#39;s site? The curly logotype above is obviously way before
    digital and bears distinct differences to the &#34;digital&#34; rendering. It
    would be interesting to know who originally drew it. Can you shed any more info
    on this, Mike?

  body: Aha. Thanks Mark. So it appears that Ortiz-Lopez&#39; role was simply one
    of digitizing the existing logos, eh? <BR> <BR>I wonder if that&#39;s the case
    with the several major league baseball team logos that he shows as well ...

    have forgotten to do something so I am doing this indeed again. If this follows
    my previous posting then assume that I stutter when I type...&#41; <BR> <BR>The
    logo in this thread is the work of Rick Griffin. The works that appeared in Rolling
    Stone Magazine were drawn on deadline which meant I at best I had three days to
    finish them. Fred Woodward hired me to mimic the works of Rick Griffin and Jim
    Parkinson; my versions are designed renderings and not digital tracings &#40;please
    note the lopsided &#34;o&#34;s in Parkinson&#39;s logos and the symetrical &#34;o&#34;s
    in mine&#41;. The logo drawn for Vincent Winter&#39;s &#34;Book of Rock Lists&#34;
    is another example of this mimicry. None of these logos exist in the form of a
    font. You can view them at the following URLs: <BR><a href="http://ortiz-lopez.com/Plate04.html"

    fonts drawn for Major League Baseball Properties were designed and rendered from
    a few samples sent to me to base my work upon. There was nothing to scan and the
    type is original. My favorite is the Boston Red Sox font: <BR><a href="http://ortiz-lopez.com/OLP06.html"
