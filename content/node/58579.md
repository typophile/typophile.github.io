  graphic there are two separate typefaces (probably originally customized) and in
  the \"DREMIE\" graphic, that typeface is actually \"Dremie\" from Flat-It Foundry
  but I need a very similar one, and not Angie Black Open (too flare-serif). Of course,
  everyone's help is much appreciated :)\r\n\r\nsdaris[img:sites/default/files/old-images/cassandre-nord-express_4372.gif][img:sites/default/files/old-images/dremie_4946.png]"

    Deco era. See [[http://www.moorstation.org/typoasis/designers/curtis/pages/q_r.htm|Rialto]],
    which has serifs, and [[http://www.moorstation.org/typoasis/designers/curtis/pages/p.htm|Park
    Lane]], which doesn't. The collection at TypOasis are his early free fonts.\r\n\r\n-

  body: Thanks for the Nick Curtis and TypOasis leads - very nice. I'm really curious
    about the "Nord Expres" fonts though - that big R is distinctive as well as the
    flat top/sharp bottom "N". And the last S in "Expres" is special too. I suppose
    I could customize Futura for the "Expres" type, but I'd really like to find the
    perfect typeface matching "Nord". Vonnes Black Extended is similar, but not enough.
    And WhatTheFont online NEVER finds matches! Any help appreciated.

  body: "That NORD EXPRES lettering looks hand-drawn (the E's in EXPRES don't even
    match).In NORD, the O is the smallest letter, and the N has an odd mix of flat
    and pointed vertices, and the R and D look as if they have been squashed. I can't
    think of any font with such features, but maybe someone else can.\r\n\r\n- Mike
