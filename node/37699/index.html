  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>In the past few days, I have been plagued by a weird screen problem. It shows up on Mac interface items like Desktop, icons, menus, splash screens, etc,. A weird pattern of hash marks superimposes it self over the above items driving me nuts!
So far, I have booted from other volumes, run a plethora of utilities, zapped my Pram, rebooted all to now avail. None of my utilities show any problem. Except for where the mouse is pointing, all application windows look fine. Anything on the desktop or any navigation item including the Dock gets whammied, though. The splash screen gets a full dose for all aps.
The problem began after waking from sleep last friday (not my sleep, the computer&rsquo;s sleep).</p>
<p>Here are a two screen grabs:</p>
<p>[img:sites/default/files/old-images/drive-icons2_5359.png]</p>
<p>[img:sites/default/files/old-images/inDsplash2_6546.png]</p>
<p>Anyone seen this before or know how to fix it?</p>

If you can send a normal video signal to an external monitor that’s a good sign, if external output does the same stuff, the video chip is fried and you’ll likely need a new motherboard. If you have a desktop, try replacing the display cable.</p>
<p>In my experience, the Apple store in Clarendon will probably be the easiest in the area to get a repair appointment at. If they’re booked up, try logging in at midnight to get an appointment.</p>

The files should be called &ldquo;Picture 1&rdquo;, &ldquo;Picture 2&rdquo;, etc. To me, it looks like a hardware problem, like a short in the monitor cable or some sort of interference. However, software screenshots are captured from the video buffer. If the screenshots look bad, it&rsquo;s something I haven&rsquo;t seen before&hellip;</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>The thing is, it was working for him before. So, I was thinking that the system was now in a state of temporary weirdness. Safe Boot is often recommended by Mac techs because it is an Apple-designed, safe, mechanism for resetting certain specific settings. My guess is that if you&rsquo;re already running 10.4.10, you&rsquo;ll be in a position where you might need to start swapping bigger things out to diagnose the problem&ndash;really stuff that&rsquo;s outside the scope of this type of forum. The fact that these are standard screen shots implies that the issue is software related. Apple&rsquo;s support forums might be a good bet because there may be people who see far, far more Mac issues than we do. With more eyeballs there&rsquo;s a better chance someone has seen this before.</p>
<p>If it were me, I would probably also try resetting system caches using a free utility called OnyX. I&rsquo;ve never known <a href="http://www.apple.com/downloads/macosx/system_disk_utilities/onyx.html">OnyX</a> to cause any problems, but there are lots of options to do goofy things.</p>
<p>I also obsessively back up my hard drive with a free cloning utility called Carbon Copy Cloner. It creates completely bootable backup partitions. That would be handy in a case like this because one could boot a recent backup and test to see if the problem occurred. I recently survived a hard drive failure on my laptop without losing any data.  My backup disk was a month old, but my email was still on the server and my other backup files had copies as well.</p>
<p>I guess my final comment on this is&hellip; yeah, it&rsquo;s weird. Gremlins maybe?</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>If I had to guess, I&rsquo;d say the video card&rsquo;s dead (possibly its memory) or overheating. Best bet would be to run the Apple Hardware Test from the OS DVD that came with the G5:
<a href="http://www.thexlab.com/faqs/aht.html">http://www.thexlab.com/faqs/aht.html</a></p>
<p>Run the extended test. This may or may not be able to diagnose a bad video card – it may appear to function correctly to the computer, but produce a garbled visual output – but it should rule out other things, such as bad system memory (though you&rsquo;d most likely be getting kernel panics with bad memory).</p>
<p>Assuming that comes up fine, it&rsquo;s the graphics card. If memory serves me correctly, the G5&rsquo;s had an Nvidia FX5200 64MB dual DVI. Here&rsquo;s a guide for swapping out the card (it&rsquo;s really easy):
<a href="http://manuals.info.apple.com/en/PMG5_AGP:PCI_Card_DIY.pdf">http://manuals.info.apple.com/en/PMG5_AGP:PCI_Card_DIY.pdf</a></p>
<p>Before you go out and buy a replacement, try this: switch off the G5 at the plug (but leave it plugged in so it&rsquo;s earthed) open up the case, take out the graphics card and <em>use an air duster to thoroughly clean out its heatsink</em>. Put it back in, boot up and check to see if the corruption&rsquo;s gone. Frequently the heatsinks clog up after a couple of years under a desk, making the card overheat and causing this sort of visual corruption. Give the rest of the G5 case a good blast of air while you have it open, too.  Oh, and make sure to keep the air duster vertical, you don&rsquo;t want to spray freezing propellant everywhere ;) (Though it shouldn&rsquo;t be harmful.)</p>
<p>If you do have to replace the graphics card, you can use a good few different models as long as OS X has the drivers for them, but it&rsquo;d probably be easiest to use the same make and model again. You should be able to pick up a cheap retail FX5200 128MB dual DVI (non–Mac–specific) for around $50 at the most.</p>

<p>The graphics card&rsquo;s chip is probably toasted then, I&rsquo;m afraid you&rsquo;ll have to replace it. Looking into this a little, it seems that you DO need to get a Mac–specific one otherwise it won&rsquo;t work, which is a shame as the PC equivalents are much, much cheaper for what is basically the same card but flashed with a different firmware.</p>
<p>A quick trawl of eBay turns up the following:
<a href="http://computers.search.ebay.com/9800_Apple-Macintosh-Computers_W0QQ_trksidZm37QQcatrefZC12QQfromZR40QQsacatZ4599">http://computers.search.ebay.com/9800_Apple-Macintosh-Computers_W0QQ_trksidZm37QQcatrefZC12QQfromZR40QQsacatZ4599</a></p>
<p>Including a card that exhibits the same problem as yours (looks like they tried replacing the fan but it didn&rsquo;t help):

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Sorry I&rsquo;m late getting back to this, Chris!  If money&rsquo;s tight and you don&rsquo;t mind a bit of work, try this:
<a href="http://www.giantmike.com/G5_9800_fix.html">http://www.giantmike.com/G5_9800_fix.html</a></p>
<p>Back when I did PC repair I noticed a lot of machines would have far, far too much thermal compound placed between the heatsink &amp; CPU, which would subsequently gunk up, go off and actually make the heat transfer worse! I wouldn&rsquo;t bother with the fancy silver or ceramic stuff, though, tests have shown that it&rsquo;s no more effective than normal compound, it just costs ten times more and looks prettier in the packet.</p>
<p>Remove the heatsink, clean off all the gunk, thoroughly clean the fan &amp; heatsink (if the fan still even works?), apply a tiny amount of thermal paste (scrounge it off a geek friend) and reapply the heatsink. Leave the side of the case off if you can, so the heat doesn&rsquo;t build up and you can see if the graphics card&rsquo;s fan still works.</p>
<p>If it seems to make a difference, it may be worth shelling out for a new heatsink such as this:
<a href="http://www.arctic-cooling.com/vga2.php?idx=125">http://www.arctic-cooling.com/vga2.php?idx=125</a></p>
<p>(Though I&rsquo;m not sure that&rsquo;ll fit in the G5 case.)</p>
<p>Worth a try on the off chance it fixes it? If it works you&rsquo;ve wasted a bit of time but saved $150, assuming you can send the unopened card back.</p>

I am not much into fonts but I am facing this exact same issue. Googling led me to this thread. I too have an ATI 9800. I have had this video card for over 4 years now. It has never given me a problem till one fine day, last month when the bar codes started scrawling around the screen. I wonder if ATI had a bad batch of cards or something. (I have a PC.) Methinks: Something worth following up with ATI?

It&rsquo;s not really ATI&rsquo;s fault per se - blame marginally faulty memory that finally degraded into failure. Without an electron microscope there&rsquo;s no way to tell just how it failed, but it did. 
Had it died within the warranty period or right out of the box that would be something else. There might be a recall of 9800&rsquo;s but more likely the fan is going bad or died long ago, leaving the card to overheat and produce glitches, that&rsquo;s the other possiblity next to memory failure. Open the PC and check if the fan can move. Bet you it&rsquo;s stuck solid, and you&rsquo;ll burn your fingers on the heatsink. :)</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Well, I cannot figure it out&hellip;.. if I put a brand new video card in, It seems logical it has to be something else. I just got it in the States this past week and now back in Europe they are hard to find and ATI service is non-existent. I am not sophisticated enough to understand why it would be the monitor, and the logic board or something scares me. Anyone w/similar problem you hear about especially software problem let me know!

		<div class="commentbody"><p>A few days ago I updated my Leopard to 10.5.2, rebooted the system, worked a little, turned my Mac to sleep and when I turned it back on I also had this problem.</p>
<p>By googling the ROM Revision (113-A14401-117) a finally found this thread. It is the only case that exactly describes my problem with the exact same hardware.</p>
<p>Did Devodoc eventually solve the problem or did he give up after wrecking another card? I&rsquo;m affraid to buy a new video card because of his case. Dezcom could resolve his problem by replacing his old card but he was still using Tiger. Did he eventually saw the problem return? So if anyone could tell me the conclusions of this &ldquo;video-card-destruction-epic&rdquo; I would be very glad.</p>
<p>I would like to use this Power Mac G5 (first gen) for a little longer. And eventually when I buy a MacBook (Pro) it could serve for holding at least one copy off all my precious data. Or it might be just for a shorter term because I might end up with an all brand-new Mac Pro where my old hard drives can live their second live and leaving the old one hard drive&rsquo;less.</p>
<p>So now I&rsquo;m in the stage where I&rsquo;m thinking of fixing my until-a-couple-of-days-ago-very-loyal Power Mac so I could hang on a little bit longer for buying a new Mac and eventually use the old one as a back-up beast or leave it as it is and go to the store to buy a MacBook (Pro) or Mac Pro. It all depends on the availability and price of AGP 8x video cards in Europe and the risk I could be taking because the new card good get the same problem.</p>

<p>3art, No, my problem has not returned since I got a new video card. I am still running Tiger and probably will untill the next bugfix comes out from Apple. I can&rsquo;t imagine that Leopard would be the issue anyway. It is hard to find a workable video card any more so I hope mine hangs in there for a couple more years. I wish you the best of luck solving your problem. Let me know how it all turns out.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Thank you very much.  I went through the same process as you did:</p>
<ol>
<li>Ran a Apple Hardware Diagnostic check from the Startup disk - hold down the Options key, Select Hardware Diagnostic and then select Extended. This confirmed that it was the Graphics board (Video (RAM)) and not the Logic board (contrary to the view of Apple and TechServe - both of whom wanted me to bring the G5 in for their diagnostic &hellip; $150 +)</li>
<li>Purchased the new board (from B&amp;H Photo):
<a href="http://ati.amd.com/products/Radeon9600/Radeon9600propcmac/index.html">http://ati.amd.com/products/Radeon9600/Radeon9600propcmac/index.html</a></li>
<li>Installed the new board - 5 minutes - remove one screw - carefully remove cooked 9800 board - install new board - replace screw.</li>
<li>Install new 9600 software (which the manufacturers suggest you do first) - it automatically overwrites the necessary 9800 files.</li>
<li>Purchase and connect the ADC-to-DVI converter.</li>
<li>Reboot</li>
</ol>
<p>Normal serve resumed.</p>
<p>ChrisL thank you again for this page - took me some time to find it but my problem is now solved.</p>
<p>BTW - the ATI service support is about as useful as a chocolate fire guard.</p>
<p>Best</p>

		<div class="commentbody">Just last night the ATI 9800 Pro Mac Special Edition in my G5 started exhibiting the same symptoms that Chris saw last October. A brief Google search led me to this thread. When I scrolled down and saw a couple of references to the error messages I ran the Apple Hardware Test and got a nearly identical error message. I&rsquo;ve put in the 9600 that came with the G5 and it works fine. I also called ATI as my dead card is about 2 weeks out of warranty. I scanned my original invoice, e-mailed it while we were still on the phone and it looks like they&rsquo;re going to help me out. I wasn&rsquo;t even going to bother contacting them. I had started looking around last night for prices on a replacement. We&rsquo;ll see what happens. Anyway, thanks everyone for the helpful info.</div>

The hardware test indeed shows 2ATI /1/4:113-xxxxx-117, but how can the problem go away then sometimes ?</p>
<p>Is this really a hardware problem with the ATI.  Since the ATI is fixed on the logic board, I&rsquo;m looking at a EUR 700 repair since my imac is out of warranty.  Help anyone ;-|</p>

I&rsquo;m glad you could resolve your video issue by replacing the graphics card. From you&rsquo;re screen shots I can tell I have the exact same issue. Does anyone know if it&rsquo;s possible to replace this graphics card chip on an iMac G5? Im presuming it&rsquo;s soldered on to the logic board thus it&rsquo;s impossible to replace?</p>
