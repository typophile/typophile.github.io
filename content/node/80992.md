body: "Hello everyone. I am hoping someone can help identify the names of the type
  found on posters and playbills in Dawson City Yukon during the goldrush...1898-1904
  roughly. There were 2 newspaper printing presses here, and I believe many print
  jobs would have been done in Seattle. The distance and freight charges to get here
  would have made metal or lead type very expensive to stock.\r\nI am hoping to identify
  the name, the foundry, and an equivalent font available today. The only one I think
  I have identified is #6 \"Shoeffer Old Style\".. but I have been unsuccessful finding
  a replica font on the market today. Any help would be most appreciated...we are
  trying to develop a toolkit for businesses and individuals to mimic and replicate
  the poster styles of the past, with as much authenticity as possible. \r\nJ\r\nP.S.
  I read the FAQ and it said the upload size could only be max 590 pixels wide, so
  if this sample is too difficult to see, I could upload the samples separately."
