body: "hello,\r\n\r\ni had posted a critique thread for this type family i'm working
  on now code named Stitch Gothic (shameless, i know). i accidentally deleated the
  node when i tried to delete my previous pdfs. i had about 450 viewings but only
  1 person gave me feedback. i hope it's not because it sucks\u2026 \r\n\r\nthis is
  for display, and i want the letterforms to have an almost hand lettered quality.
  two typefacess that i was thinking of when i started this were Franklin Gothic and
  Interstate (or Highway Gothic). the figures are based on the types of numbers that
  are used for license plates. i also wanted to throw in an italic for a friendly,
  comsumer edge. there are a lot of things going on, but i want it to reflect the
  eclectic nature of the Southern California region.\r\n\r\nthis is my first attempt
  at a <em>real</em> typeface. i've messed around with a few other designs in order
  to learn Fontographer.\r\n\r\nso, i apologize for starting a second thread about
  the same topic but please have a look. any feedback would be greatly appreciated.
  thank you.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.istitch.net/typophile/StitchGothicV16.pdf\">PDF

  completion.\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: "I like your letters. They are developable. Especcially the italic has a nice
    look.\r\n\r\nBut before criticise your letters you have to improve some things.
    First off all: your upstrokes have the same width like the downstrokes. Thats
    wrong. Even in the constructed DIN the upstrokes are thinner. Even if it doesnt
    look so. You can prove it by putting circles with the same radius into the stems!
    Round strokes are a little bit wider too have the same optical thickness as straight
    strokes. Your approach was correct but a bit too much. And you have to pay attention
    that both sides of the strokes on the C, O, Q etc looks identical.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/AC-stitch.jpg]\r\n\r\nlearn
    more about it here:\r\nhttp://www.kleindaten.de/kaech/\r\n\r\nAlso your counters
    looks a bit too eggy.\r\n\r\nI like trapping flowers. But when you use them pay
    attention that you use them continuous. They are missing in the V, W, M etc. But
    you have done them incorrect.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.themicrofoundry.com/ss_trapping1.html\r\n\r\nGreetings:
    Steven"

  body: "1) I think the lowercase f's would be a bit easier to read if the ascenders
    continued a little bit further than they do.  It jumped out at me in the italic,
    and then I looked at the roman and saw it there too.  Maybe if the ascender curve
    were a little squarer and less oval it would help in that regard, even though
    there isn't much precedent for it in the rest of your face.\r\n\r\n2) I agree
    with Steven about your round lc letters.\r\n\r\n3) I think your round uppercase
    letters -- or maybe just C and O -- have  the opposite problem, though, and look
    optically a little shorter than what I would expect them to be.\r\n\r\n4) Have
    you considered a tail for the italic g instead of the loop descender?  I think
    it might fit better with the other short descenders.\r\n\r\n5) Does your $ harmonize
    with the numerals?"

  body: "Thanks Jim,\r\n\r\ngreat feedback. i'm looking at the \"f\" right now and
    i see what you mean about it. do you think that it should extend further on the
    tail in the italic as well?\r\n\r\ni like tail of the italic \"g\" so i'd like
    to keep it. however, perhaps there is something i can add to the italic in another
    letter that would go with the tail of the \"g\". maybe a looped \"k\" or something
    like that\u2026 any thoughts?\r\n\r\nI think i'm going to play with the \"$\"
    a bit to see if i can make it work. it's definately not there yet. i want to finess
    the punctuation after i get the core characters set.\r\n\r\n------\r\n\r\n"
