I posted a thread a few days ago with two logos in it. I decided to redo one.

This is for a production company that makes action b-movies. We decided to make it look as serious as possible even thought the movies are made for fun.

I've haven't really found a font that I like yet. So I thought that some of you might have some suggestions. The two fonts I've used here are Utopia and Sabon.

Utopia makes it look like a newspaper logo :)</div>

Yeah, one of my teachers also mentioned that it looks like a ladder, not good. Gonna try the melting thing and put it horizontal with the same explosion.

Probably not as much flex as the photoshop tutorial, just enough to stop it looking ladderish. I would stick with the vertical format the horizontal is (even in the current digital camera boom) too like stills film.

If you have the opportunity, try jamming some film in a projector, the heat of the bulb melts stationary film, and take shots of the screen as it goes – quite spectacular, (unless it’s a major part of your final degree show then it’s heartbreaking).

You could also try animating the explosion or a spark travelling along the fuse before exploding from the frame, I see that following the name of the company.

I don't think a photo version will work that well and I'm gonna animate the logo at some point when I have enough free time, then it will be alot easier if it's not a photo. I had had in mind something like timd suggests, a fuse that is lit and the silm explodes.

I made a version in photoshop from the photos. It's a little rough still. I don't know yet how much I'm going to straighten it out when I draw it, It looks kinda cool when it's a little rough. I cut out the "photos" in the negative. I think that I might make it look even more cut-out and add some small cuts and scrapes. Other then that I need to work on the explosion some more.

The type that I think fits best at the moment is Sabon.

I'll welcome any more feedback that you can give, thanks for all opinions so far.

I rotate the shot area and remove the sprocket holes on the top side so I get a 8mm or 16mm film, and maybe make them remove a few. Like that http://www.ischool.utexas.edu/~alpa2500/filmsize.jpg http://www.ischool.utexas.edu/~alpa2500/SmallGauge.jpg

Thanks for that Tim, it will probably look alot better.

I still think that the logo is a little empty, started thinking that maybe I should add something in the shot area, a gun or something. Something to think about atleast.

I'm gonna edit it so much that I don't think it will look good as a photo after I'm done putting it together.

Well, technically that would be right, however, for ease-of-recognition purposes you might keep them in and just rotate the area, nearly every image representing film uses two sets of sprocket holes and the general public will recognise that best. A photographic image might be best if you can achieve it. When considering the ‘emptyiness’ try reducing the logo to the size it might appear on a business card before you add to it and make it too busy.

Update.

Still rough in the shot area, haven't edited it properly yet, I'll do that when I'm happy with everything and start drawing the filmstrip in illustrator. 

Still content with Sabon.

Might take until next week for more changes, have some work I need to get done over the weekend.

post your thoughts if you have any, thanks for all replies so far.

I have a few thoughts ...  Simplify; IMHO five film frames is too many - just three may be adequate.  The best design advice I ever got was that "perfection is achieved when there's nothing left to take away, not add." 

The flame explosion feels too stiff compared to the film. Have you tried giving your flames some organic curves? 

And lastly ... To everything, Kern, Kern, Kern, I swear it's not too late  ...  :)

As for the explosion I haven't tried making it more organical yet. It can't be too wavy either, then it probably won't look like an explosion anymore.

After that I'll start kerning ( I had too look up kerning in my freshly purchased typography book :) )

Three versions and I'm not really happy with anyone.

1. The filmstrip on top, vertical. Works but hte explosion look so cluttered when it goes over the strip and monotone explosion under it.

2. The backgrund behind the text it joins with the filmstrip very nicely but there's something here that bothers me, don't know what, might be the font.

3. This just looks crap. When you cut it too three frames and put it horizontal it dosen't really look like a film strip.

Perhaps some sans serif typeface suggestions would be in order.

grateful for more feedback

This is exactly what I was picturing in my head, Paul. Thanks!

I like numbers 2 & 3. Number 1 would cause a problem because it would look like a ladder again and the explosion would just make it look like a fireman's ladder. 

I like the wavy flames that you added. Did you try a version like #3 but with the filmstrip to the right of the wordmark?</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I had the third versions text at all kinds of places. I didn't really like any. The problem that I have with two and three is that they don't look like filmstrips to me, number one does but not two and three. I'm starting to think this is something that the person who I'm making it for should decide.

Anyway I've worked some more on version one. Replaced Sabon with a condensed Avant Garde and added some white spaces around the explosion and it's really starting to pop out, I also made the top of the strip, where it's cut, more jagged so it would look like it broke. I must say that I don't see the ladder at all anymore.

I'm still gonna try a round explosion similar to the photos that Paul posted and see how that looks on version one and three.

I drew a round explosion in illustrator but when I scale it down it starts too look like a star instead of an explosion, especially the monotone explosions.

So now I'll work some more on number one, I'm gonna do another test with number three and skip number two.</div>

Can you post a monotone version of the logo you're working on? I'm interested to see how you're handling it - especially since I love the contrast between the brown film and the bright explosion.

		<div class="commentbody">Had some work I needed to get done so It took a while since my last post.

Anyway, The type I've picked now is Futura Heavy and I quite like it. I tried some variations with the strip horizontal but nothing turned out good. I haven't yet made a real effort at the round explosion since my last try, I'm going to go to a bookstore at the end of the week and look at some manga comics, tried googling it but didn't get much.

This logo is soon finished, I can't work on it forever. If you have any suggestions on a sans serif heavy or extra bold property let me know. I also tried Bauhaus but that didn't work, it can't be too special.

I also tried fixing the space between the letters trying to make it nice and even. First i had the text centered with the strips borders but it didn't look centered so I moved the text to the left so know it's centered to the strips left border and the right edge of the explosion.

These three versions is a variation in the little flames that are around the explosion. I'm not sure yet if I'm going to leave them out or not. I just started thinking that maybe the text needs to be smaller.

All feedback welcome, thanks.

I know have it in completley black, a little darker red and the last one got the same red color as the outer edge of the explosion. I fixed the kern issues, does it look alright? The red visaul arts gives it a nice thouch but maybe the last one is a little bright, I don't know yet. I have to think about it.

		<div class="commentbody">I like the darker red over the lighter, the red used on the explosion has more an orange feel to it, than a red anyway. 

Also, you might want to consider tightening the space between VISUAL and ARTS, it's about a double space wide now. 

The blacklooks nice, it really gives your explosion punch. I should have mentioned earlier, but the film that's to the left of the explosion probably should be thinner, it would be the first to melt anyway because it's closer to the heat. And I'm not sure the "breaks" at the top of the film are necessary, might want to make that a clean slice, it'll give a better balance to the mayhem that's happening at the bottom of the film. 

All in all, an impressive development. </div>

I don't know why I didn't notice before, but I like the very, very slight gradients in the explosion. (Either that or my eyes are playing tricks on me.)

The only think that bothers me know is the part where the film "melted" on the left side of the filmstrip (see image - I hope you don't mind me playing with it). I think you should play with it a little more or more it lower on the filmstrip. As Andrew suggested, that would make it thinner.

I've been loking at the left side for a while but haven't really done anything about it yet. I think it needs to be fairly solid on the left side otherwise I might be too much if it's gonna have heavy melting and distortion on both sides. As for the cuts at the top i added then because somehow the clean cuts didn't seem right.

Going to do some revisions today.
