  chance to leave lameville. Lameville was a comfortable safe place to visit compared
  to shitsville, but I'm really glad to leave both in my rear view.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://www.graphicdeclaration.com/images/NPB_YEAH_redgold.jpg\">\r\n<img
  src=\"http://www.graphicdeclaration.com/images/NPB_YEAH_bluesilver.jpg\">\r\n\r\nThe
  dollar symbol was created by outrageously scaling a Helvetica cap /S/ and then adding
  some vertical lines ...lool!!! I then created a brush and laid down a grid of six
  $ under which I added a blue/yellow/red gradient and duped the layer a few times
  on various blend modes. Then I desaturated all added some noise for texture and
  laid a colour layer on top of all to get the depth I was trying to achieve. Old
  school stuff!!!\r\nTo create a contrasting drama its all being held down with a
  pure layer of color, to which I added typography set in Impact.\r\n\r\nPersonally
  speaking I'm diggin'  the blue/silver one ...that's the one I kept for myself :)!!!\r\n\r\nI'm
  also groovin' to this one...\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://www.graphicdeclaration.com/images/NPB_YEAH_3.jpg\">\r\n\r\n...which
  feels kinda wanting/thin, but yet is still awesome. \r\n\r\nBut one thing I know
  for sure ... my graphical style has left lameville and shitsville back somewhere
  in the dust ...\r\n\r\nn.\r\n\r\n"
