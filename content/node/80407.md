body: "Devout readers will recall my numerous bug reports about Typophile. Quite a
  few of them argued that Typophile should do what is known to work and <em>not</em>
  do what is known <em>not</em> to work. A great deal of knowledge about what works
  comes from <a href=\"http://MetaFilter.com/\" title=\"MeFi\">MetaFilter</a>, the
  community Weblog that is the model for such things. It\u2019s more of a success
  than any remotely comparable site \u2013 11 years old, 70,000 active users, a million
  pageviews a day; profitable; employs four people in tech development and moderation;
  moderated 24/7; includes the most important feature of all, <a href=\"http://metatalk.MetaFilter.com/\"
  title=\"MetaTalk\">MetaTalk</a>, a forum to discuss MetaFilter itself.\r\n\r\nNow
  let\u2019s talk about typography. Logged-in users can choose the \u201Cclassic\u201D
  white-on-blue configuration for MetaFilter proper or white-on-black. My query is
  not about page design or colour choice, so don\u2019t derail onto those topics,
  please. What I take issue with is MetaFilter\u2019s uncontrolled line length.\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s
  very simple: Lines are as wide as your window. Attached is what MeFi looks like
  on a 24\u2033 monitor (<a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/joeclark/5553705590/\"
  title=\"Flickr version\">Flickr version</a>).\r\n\r\nEveryone here knows this is
  insane. You can<em>not</em> read text that wide. In the past, it has been impossible
  to get the ordinarily quite intelligent owner and developer of MetaFilter \u2013
  <a href=\"http://www.metafilter.com/user/1\" title=\"Matt Haughey, User 1\">mathowie</a>
  and <a href=\"http://www.metafilter.com/user/191\" title=\"Paul Bausch\">pb</a>,
  respectively \u2013 to understand that measure is actually a problem, let alone
  do something about it. All it needs is one declaration in CSS (<code>max-width</code>
  on the appropriate <code>div</code>).\r\n\r\npb will not even add a unique <code>id</code>
  to the <code>div</code> in question so that, in a last-ditch effort, one could set
  up user CSS in one\u2019s own browser to do the job. (Nobody should have to do that,
  but they refuse to make it possible.)\r\n\r\nmathowie and pb seem to believe that
  every aspect of the appearance of MetaFilter is a component of its success. Changing
  anything amounts to tinkering with what works. That belief comes from a misadventure
  in which  mathowie paid for a redesign that tanked in user testing. People don\u2019t
  want the overall design to change, it seems; that\u2019s fine, but it isn\u2019t
  my issue. When you try to talk to these people about typography, they hear something
  else and they get defensive.\r\n\r\nSo: What I would like Typophiles to do in this
  thread is to explain, ideally with references, why unlimited measure like this is
  reader-hostile and why it needs to be fixed.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/MetaFilter-linelength_5027.png]"

    day narrowing and widening your browser window (there\u2019s only one at any given
    moment, is there not?) to accommodate Web designers\u2019 failures? (I assume
    you don\u2019t mind when a Flash site, as from a photographer, takes over your
    window and resizes it for you?)\r\n\r\nWe both know you\u2019re just being obstreperous.

    or even entire words at once, while simultaneously examining the shapes in our
    parafoveal vision to both consider what is coming up and to reconsider what was
    just in focus. As we do this our eye jumps across the page in movements called
    saccades. After around six or eight saccades the head starts to move instead of
    just the eyes. Little head movements are tiring and annoying and as lines lengthen
    the eye tends to jump up and down to other lines. This is why a good line length
    tends to fall in the range of 55\u201375 characters per line, depending on the
    font and size it is set at.\r\n\r\nI\u2019m pretty sure that Unger covered some
    of this in <em>While You Are Reading</em>. Bill Hill also brought it up at Typecon
    2007, I\u2019m not sure if he has written about that somewhere."

    the speed of reading and the ease of comprehension: a line of text that is too
    short can slow reading and cause eye fatigue as the eye must move more often from
    one line to the next, whereas a line that is too long may cause the eye to skip
    to the next line. With respect to long texts, the ideal length of a line is between
    50 and 70 characters.\"\r\n\r\nSee: http://lois-laws.justice.gc.ca/eng/PDF_full.html\r\n\r\nI

    \r\nIt lets you write your own CSS change to a site, and every time you visit

    the problem for the whole world, but at least for yourself.\r\n\r\nFirebug is
    another great add-on and almost goes hand-in-hand with Stylish, it makes it easier
    to identify the CSS class or ID or tag that needs to be changed.\r\n\r\nWith stylish
    installed, visit metafilter --> right click the S icon --> write new style -->
    for this site. Give it a name at the top. Paste this line just before the final
    }.\r\n\r\n.copy { width: 500px !important; }\r\n\r\nChange the 500px to whatever

    can't speak for Nick Shinn, but if I'm uncomfortable with the line length on a
    classic HTML web site, I'm much more likely to just narrow the window than attempt
    to change my browser's default font settings.\r\n\r\nI <em>do</em> mind the fact
    that I can't adjust the proportions of the page used by this forum because of
    how the HTML is set up. Not much, as the line width is passable, and the page
    fits my current browser window size on my current screen resolution without scrolling
    side to side, but I would prefer it if the page design could flow with the size
    of the browser window and accommodate smaller window sizes.\r\n\r\n<cite>your
    browser window (there\u2019s only one at any given moment, is there not?)</cite>\r\n\r\nHuh?
    Why would there only be one browser window? This is another annoyance I have with
    the Typophile site; because the front page uses Flash, I can't just right-click
    on FORUMS to open it in a new window; I have to lose the front page, and the opportunity
    to check out the items indicated there as new or hot, in order to get to the main
    Forums menu. (Of course, there's the browser's back button, but then I lose the
    main menu, and the page has to be rendered again.) I even find tabs cumbersome
    - it's much better to have the actual page present on a window, so one knows right
    away which one it is."
