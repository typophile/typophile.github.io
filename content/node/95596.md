body: "Hello\r\n\r\nI want to begin a research on Latin type design. to begin I need
  to read one or two books which give me a general view to the basic principles of
  Latin type design. because I have worked on Persian type design and my own language
  is completely different from English or other Latin languages , I'm not familiar
  with forms of Latin letters.\r\n\r\nI would be happy if you introduce me some books
  which help me know the rules and trends in Latin type design. It's so important
  for me to read a book that is an authenticated reference in type design. I want
  to know the methods which have been used and developed to design a type family ,
  and also the methods to teach designing type.\r\n\r\nThank you\r\n\r\n"
