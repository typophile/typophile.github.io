<div class="post-content e-content" itemprop=articleBody>I need a printer, pretty much to preview type designs. I <br>understand that a b&w laser is almost perfect. But I have <br>also been looking at photo-quality printers and they seem <br>to have excellent image quality, but nonr of the shops <br>could print me out type samples. <br> <br>So, what do the typophiles recommend? What is everyone <br>else using to print out type-in-progress? <br> <br>kris</div>
<div class="comment card m-3">
<div class=card-body>
<div class=commentbody>Some high resolution inkjets (especially HP ones) can create excellent type when used with special inkjet coated papers. This is because they are coated with (I seem to recall) a ceramic-derived coating that absorbs and dries the ink immediately, stopping ink from spreading through to the fibres of the paper itself. However, the paper is very expensive, and so its not really practical as a medium for testing fonts, as you should be making LOTS of print outs through a face's development cycle. <br> <br>Far better to use a laser printer, where it can provide good quality results consistently and inexpensively. Then, when its close to completion, sent it to an imagesetter at an output bureau for the final tests.</div>

<div class=commentbody>>as you should be making LOTS of print outs through a face's development cycle.&lt; <br> <br>I think the more experience you have the less you print out. <br> <br>FontLab's high rez preview also helps a great deal. <br> <br>Also I think the subject of printers has been discussed in other threads, but if you want a recommendation, Xante's 2400 dpi laserprinter is terrific, though a tad expensive.</div>

<div class=commentbody>I was the one who started the other discussion about laser printers that James mentioned. I wound up getting the Minolta/QMS PagePro 9100. Here's why: <br> <br>1. 1200 dpi <br>2. Prints 11 x 17 <br>3. Well reviewed (now by me also) <br>4. Network Printer <br>5. $799 at <a href="http://www.tigerdirect.com/applications/searchtools/item-Details.asp?EdpNo=305828&sku=Q200-1252%20P">Tiger Direct</a> <br> everywhere else it's $1300+ <br>6. Support has been great <br>7. Prints fast! <br> <br>The downside is that it's pretty big, which means finding a space in my home office was tricky and, shipping could be expensive </div>

<div class=commentbody>So I think I will be getting this: <br> <br><a href=http://www.minolta-qms.com.au/products/prod-netw/pp1250e/contents.html target=_blank>http://www.minolta-qms.com.au/products/prod-netw/pp1250e/contents.html</a> <br> <br>The Minolta PagePro 1250E. <br> <br>I gather it is the same thing as Randy's Minolta/QMS <br>PagePro 9100, except A4 max.

<div class=commentbody>Never used that particular model, but we have a Minolta QMS at my office. It's higher on the food chain (1600 dpi, 11 X 17, IIRC) than this one, but it works like a charm. I've no complaints. I've been thinking about getting the same model Randy has ever since a student sent me a link to TigerDirect a few months agao.</div>

The $30 coupon is only good for four more days (the $70 rebate until the end of the month), but if you want, I'll print some sheets, scan 'em, and send them to you. Not sure how long snail mail takes to reach NZ from the US, but I could mail some printed sheets too. I imagine I'll have the printer in 3 days or so.</div>

Here is the blurb from the <br>website: <br> <br>"Print speeds of up to 17 pages per minute mean the PagePro 1250E won't be late to deliver your important documents. <br>Connect your computer to either the parallel or USB interface. Whether you choose a PC or Macintosh, you'll start printing sooner on a PagePro 1250E! <br>Concerned about compatibility? With both PCL 6 and PostScript emulations, the PagePro 1250E works with just about any application you use."</div>

<div class=commentbody>So the 1250E has a processor with Postscript emulation, but the 1250W and 1350W don't, right? Where do the latter two do the emulation: in the software driver, or nowhere? If it's done in SW on the computer itself, is it then just a matter of using up the computer's time instead of the printer's, like spooling versus not?
