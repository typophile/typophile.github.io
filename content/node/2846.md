body: eKnowledge is a client of mine that is undergoing a major identity crisis, both
  visually and functionally. I am consulting them in all areas of marketing and communication,
  beginning with their visual identity. Their products and services &#40;which are
  too broad&#41; currently include everything from video production to website development
  to office infrastructure set up and maintenance to information management, and the
  list goes on. Like I said

  body: 'My opion Scott loose the techno look. The name is intimitating enough. I
    like the middle one because it feels accessable and you need as much warm and
    fuzzy as you can generate.  <BR>It sounds like they need to focus their business.
    At one point in my career I worked for a marketing agency that did direct mail
    for the banking industry. A very focused niche, so business wasn&#39;t hard to
    find. Do they do dishes too '

  body: 'Tell me about it. The CEO is having difficulty letting go of products and
    services that he knows the company is capable of providing. Myself, and many others
    from what I&#39;ve heard, have encouraged him to focus on one or two of their
    primary services &#40;preferrably ones that offer the highest ROI&#41; and dedicate
    all resources to them. Due to his stubborness to let go, I am taking a compromised
    approach by catagorizing his various products and services into comprehensive
    divisions. In the future eKnowledge will be marketed as: &#40;1&#41; eKnowledge
    - systems &#43; information management, &#40;2&#41; eKnowledge - training &#43;
    education, &#40;3&#41; eKnowledge - rich media marketing &#43; PR, or some similar
    catagorical divisions. At least that way, their will be added clarity to the customers.
    I&#39;m working on the proposal now, so hopefully, he&#39;ll buy into it. <BR>
    <BR>Oh yah, back to the critique. I am favoring the altered Georgia logotype also.
    I didn&#39;t want to say anything until I had heard from someone. Considering
    the broad customer base, I think it is the most universal of the options. The
    reason I included the Futana type was because I think it lends well to using a
    byline &#40;reason for including all that gibberish above&#41;, which will be
    a necessity if I am successful in my pitch. <BR> <BR>Thank you for the critique.'

  body: hi scott <BR> <BR>i add my vote to georgia. i do think that you should elaborate
    a better ligature between &#34;e&#34; and &#34;K&#34;, and i also think that the
    &#34;o&#34; is asking for another ligature with the &#34;w&#34;, a script one.
    <BR> <BR>i think the horizontal on top of your &#34;e&#34; should be thicker,
    in the actual weight you will have problems in small prints. <BR> <BR>keep us

  body: Scott brilliant idea making divisions of his business and marketing them separately.
    Do you have a variation of the logo with a division attached to it? It seems you
    could develope one based on the Georgia logo that every post seems to like.

  body: The Georgia is a good choice I think you should consider a ge ligature and
    work on the eK, there is an area of darkness at the join which disturbs the effect.
    The teardrop terminal of the g is not as elegant as that of the w. The horizontal
    bar and the divisions could be colour coordinated?  <BR>T

  body: I definitely agree that the Georgia version is the best choice.  It&#39;s
    strong, but not cold. It&#39;s also got a nice unique flavor. <BR> <BR>There&#39;s
    something about it that makes my eyes/brain try to see Greek or Cyrillic characters
    in the word &#40;I speak/ write neither, by the way&#41;. I don&#39;t know if
    this matters, or is something others see, but I can&#39;t seem to shake it from
    my head. I think it has to do with the terminals, the curve-terminal combinations
    that the italic makes and the custom ligatures. Again, this is really here nor
    there. <BR> <BR>I also agree with Cristian and Tim about the eK ligature needing
    tweaking to make it lighter, and Tim about the g&#39;s descender and trying a
    ge ligature. It didn&#39;t bother me, but once I caught the connections running
    through the whole word, the end e seemed left out.

  body: Of those three I like the Georgia the most, but I think it&#39;s still off-track.
    I think you need something squat, geometric and somewhat bland. But how can you
    make it <i>variable</i> too?... I got it! Wachowiak&#39;s Generation &#40;which
    I&#39;ve recommended before&#41;. Available through <a href="http://www.fontshop.de"
    target="_blank">http://www.fontshop.de</a> , but not cheap. <BR> <BR>BTW, is there
    a way you can make the logo modular? Like consisting of two parts - one that&#39;s
    fixed and another that changes depending on the &#34;department&#34;. <BR> <BR>hhp

  body: 'Thank you all for the great feedback. I apologize for not responding with
    anything of interest yet, but I wanted to acknowledge the helpful critique I&#39;ve
    received and provide a brief update. <BR> <BR>Last Tuesday &#40;1/27&#41; I submitted
    a proposal to my client using the Georgia concept. The existing logo &#40;as shown
    in my original post&#41; was proposed as a universal eKnowledge logo to be communicated
    to investors. Three market specific logos were also submitted, which included
    the eKnowledge logo, as shown, accompanied by the above mentioned descriptors
    &#40;from my second post&#41;. I believe this is the kind of approach Hrant was
    alluding to: eKnowledge &#40;static/fixed&#41; and descriptor &#40;dynamic/changing&#41;.
    In addition to having dynamic descriptors, these market specific logos are each
    assigned a unique color as well. I expect to discuss the project with my client
    tomorrow &#40;Mon 2/2&#41;, at which time I should have an idea of where I&#39;ll
    be taking this. <BR> <BR>You have all identified some flaws in the current typeforms,
    namely, the &#34;e-K&#34; ligature and the &#34;g-e&#34; relationship that is
    void of a ligature. Originally, I simply thinned out the stem of the &#34;K&#34;
    to offset its heavy base which is a derivitive of the &#34;e-K&#34; lig. Obviously,
    from the remarks that have been made I didn&#39;t quite pull it off. The horizontal
    line over the &#34;e&#34;, which I added after creating the logotype contributes
    to the heaviness also. I&#39;m still uncertain about whether or not to connect
    the &#34;g-e&#34; via ligature. Since my initial sketches, I haven&#39;t come
    up with a way to make it look natural, or rather, indiginous to the original typeface.
    <BR> <BR>I don&#39;t know how many of you were on board my personal logo critique
    for <a href="http://www.creativesqueeze.com" target="_blank">http://www.creativesqueeze.com</a>,
    but I shared my personal philosophy or practice of trying my best to maintain
    the integrity of typeforms when using what I consider to be classics. You might
    say that I will pursuade an existing typeface to conform to my logotype, but I
    will not ask it to give up its true identity. Georgia must remain Georgia, even
    if it is eKnowledge Georgia. There are fonts that I don&#39;t have as much respect
    for and I will treat them more liberally, but Georgia is not one of them. If my
    client allows me to continue in this direction, I will try my best to work some
    of your insightful recommendations into the logotype. <BR> <BR>Aloha! <BR>Scott'

    to be lower than the rest - plus I think one fancy ligature is plenty. <BR> <BR>&#42;

  body: Scott, spell out Public Relations the average person probably won&#39;t know
    PR. Plus its not consistant with your other divisions. A suggestion is to dump
    the word Rich, so it reads Media Marketing &#43; Public Relations. Other than
    that I think you have a winner.

    &#34;e-K&#34; and &#34;g-e&#34; have been my nemisis on this logotype. I have
    sketched out every connection/disconnection I could think of and come full circle.
    My current resolve &#40;unless someone here inspires something I haven&#39;t tried
    yet&#41; is to leave them as is, but with the applied tweaks: &#40;1&#41; slightly
    nudged the ending &#34;e&#34; to the left, &#40;2&#41; slightly nudged the beginning
    &#34;e&#34; to the left, decreased the base of the &#34;K&#34;, and slightly nudged
    the phonetic symbol over the &#34;e&#34; to the left, all to lighten the &#34;e-K&#34;
    connection a bit. As for color selections: &#40;1&#41; blue is appropriate for
    the targeted conservative corporate clients, &#40;2&#41; green is appropriate
    for conveying education, and &#40;3&#41; the third segment is where I thought
    I would implement a red, which would be appropriate for eye-catching marketing,
    but it seemed too hard for PR, so I toned it down to a red/blue &#40;a.k.a. purple&#41;.
