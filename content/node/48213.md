body: "Hi,\r\n\r\nI'm looking for a serif font similar to Clarendon (see ning.com)
  with a tail on the lower case 'z'. I love the 'g' in that font but my name doesn't
  have a g in it.\r\n\r\nCan anyone suggest a suitable font? Its for a masthead /
  logo on a website.\r\n\r\nthanks!\r\n\r\n<cC>"

    ask around if someone is willing to create a custom logotype if you are willing
    to make a job offer out of it.\r\n\r\nI for one would definitely be interested
    in developing those letters for you.\r\n\r\nAlso, a custom logo would be much
    more unique then setting the wordmark in a commercial typeface.\r\n\r\nBest regards\r\n\r\nSteffen\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: thanks. I know illustrator so can probably do it myself. The tail would be
    much more like the 'g' from Clarendon rather than the one from Weiss. Is there
    a technical term for this 'tail' so I can do some investigating?

  body: I don't think you'll find a typeface with 'z' that has what I would call a
    'g's "ear". This should be done by hand, as steffen suggests.

  body: Attached a (very) fast sketch of a letter 'z' from clarendon roman. Maybe
    it's a possibility to start if you decide to do it yourself. [img:sites/default/files/old-images/clarend_alt_z_5920.gif]
