  body: helvetica. <BR>You&#39;ll have to adjust the letterspacing to acheive the
    crappyness of the sample you provided.

  body: Stuart! I can&#39;t believe you would think this is anything but Helvetica.
    To be precise, it&#39;s not the version that we know and love/hate today, but
    the pre-digital display version from the metal/phototype days. If you&#39;ve got
    an old Letraset catalog you can see it in detail. <BR> <BR>There was a thread
    last year where I illustrated the differences <a href="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/30/7772.html"

    target="_blank">this</a> and <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/paratype/gothic-725/black-bt/testdrive.html?s=Subway&amp;p=72"
    target="_blank">this</a>. &#40;Gothic 725 is Bitstream&#39;s version of Akzidenz
    Grotesk. Berthold doesn&#39;t have a test drive feature on their site for the
    real thing.&#41;
