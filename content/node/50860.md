  know this whole concept about anachronisms\u2026 I know it\u2019s a game people
  like to play. And they know I\u2019m working my ass off to keep it from happening.
  Someone sent me something about how the font at the end of the show was Ari[a]l
  and was not period. I was like, \u201CThe show\u2019s over. Go home. I\u2019m allowed
  to do whatever I want.\u201D  <span class=\"grey\">[...]</span> \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nBut
  if you\u2019re person who loves fonts, fantastic. I\u2019m sure there are some mistakes
  in there about when these fonts came out.... I can tell you that almost everything
  you see in that show, especially the artwork, is cut and pasted out of old ads.
  Those fonts may not have existed on a computer or couldn\u2019t be typeset yet,
  but they were cut and pasted from old ads, so maybe they were hand-drawn or something.\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nThe
  American Airlines ad that they were most critical of had this very famous lettering
  and it was used by DDB about six months after the crash, and we put it in our pitch
  and I was thinking \u201CI\u2019m sorry, I don\u2019t have the freedom to do that
  with my fictitious ad agency? To have them get there before DDB did?\u201D  Maybe
  American Airlines saw it and told DDB they wanted it. Who knows?\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>\r\nI
  love that people are invested enough that they\u2019re fighting about it getting
  into it and doing that. I put so much ambiguity into the show if you say something
  about it that I didn\u2019t think of I don\u2019t say \u201CYou\u2019re wrong.\u201D
  I\u2019m just saying that\u2019s not what I meant or whatever. But I\u2019m fascinated
  that people get so much out of it. \r\n</p>\r\n</blockquote>"

  body: "Thanks for posting this, Joe (and for posting the link to my article on MetaFilter,
    which triggered an avalanche of traffic to my site). I sort of expected/hoped
    that someone (!) working on the show might see what I wrote.\r\n\r\nI've been
    doing this \"typecasting\" thing for a while now. I totally understand that it's
    trivial and that 99.99% of the audience will never notice such things. If they
    did, then people like Weiner would naturally give it more attention than they
    do. To me it's more about the fact that when you're deep in a specialized area
    like I am, you get a skewed view of the world. It's an occupational hazard. On
    the face of it, it looks like I'm criticizing the show (or movie or whatever),
    but I'm also making fun of my obsessions for the amusement of my own audience.
    I don't take it nearly as it might appear."

    \u201CUsually if it was paper, like a magazine or a newspaper, I would reproduce

    to find....  I\u2019m constantly redoing book covers. In one scene, a couple is
    reading in bed, and I couldn\u2019t find a copy of the book that looked brand
    new \u2013 the pages were yellowed or it was faded \u2013 so I found a new book
    and remade the cover based on the original.\u201D\r\n \r\n\u2014  \r\nJoe Clark\r\nhttp://joeclark.org/"
