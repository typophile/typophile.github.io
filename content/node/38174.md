body: "Hi.\r\nI'm planning to digitize this typeface, I was wondering if you have
  ever heard of, seen,  or  know any existing digital versions of it? \r\nMy quick
  searches have only found talk of a script called Splendid, so I assume that if this
  grotesk design has already been converted it might be under a different name.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/PICT0005_5318.jpg]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn
  the old type sample book I found, 'Splendid Grotesk' exists only in this \"extended\"
  form and in three different boldnesses. In the book there is separately another
  grotesk called 'Accidens' [sic] so I don't think it actually is from the same family.
  \r\n\r\nThis thin extended Akzidenz grotesk   [[http://www.bleisetzer.de/cms/front_content.php?idcat=57&idart=665|Here]]
  seems to come very close to 'Splendid', but is given away by the lower case 'e'.\r\nAlso,
  the bolder Splendids unfortunately not pictured here are even more distinctive from
  Akzidenz.\r\nThe Akzidenz also lacks this special retro grotesk vibe I find exciting
  and rare in digital fonts nowadays...which can also be a regional thing and common
  to unique finnish grotesks designed for an occasion in 1920-1950 or something.\r\n"

  body: It looks similar to [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/chank/adrianna/extended-light|Adrianna]],
    but the proportions look a little better. It's sort of like an Engravers Gothic
    that's been Gothamized.

  body: "Hi Erkki,\r\n\r\nThis looks like a typeface often found around 1900 under
    various names and from different foundries. They all got the \"pre-fab\" matrizes
    from Wagner & Schmidt, Leipzig (maybe they even made it to finland).\r\nSeemann's
    Handbuch der Schriften (handbook of typefaces) lists Splendid-Grotesk on p. 203
    as a face by the typefoundry W. Woellmer, Berlin. It is nearly identical with
    f.e. Breite halbfette Favourit-Grotesk (bold extended) by Weisert, Aurora-Grotesk
    by Weber, Edel-Grotesk by Wagner, Klassische Grotesk by Trennert, Elite-Grotesk
    by Poppelbaum Vienna, Viktoria-Grotesk by John, Merkur-Grotesk by Butter and Akzidenz-Grotesk
    by Haas, Switzerland. This last one should not be confused with Bertholds AG.\r\n\r\nThat
    is at least, what I can guess from the Word \"Hamburg\". \r\n"

  body: "Thank you all very much, Splendid does seem to be from Wilhelm Woellmer Foundry
    (marked \"W.W.\" in my type specimen book, and precisely credited in another).
    Narciso looks pretty much identical, plus the sample image Verbosus posted includes
    some lower case glyphs that my sample book didn't have.\r\n\r\nThis all has been
    very helpful. further comments are still appreciated of course!\r\n"
