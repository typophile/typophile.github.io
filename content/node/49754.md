  body: "In the Summer 2001, Vol. 10, issue of Eye magazine, there was an article
    about the introduction of Dave Farey and Richard Dawson's Times Classic (which
    I think has since been superceded yet again). \r\n\r\nOne illustration to the
    article shows part of a publicity piece that was produced to accompany the 1932
    introduction of Times New Roman and which compares TNR with its predecessor. It
    looks like some fairly non-descript Modern, typical of the period. I'd never heard
    that it was referred to as Times Old Roman; that strikes me as a questionable
    assertion. \r\n\r\n-- Kent."

  body: Sorry to resurrect an older thread, but I was just rereading Morison's <em>Tally
    of Types</em>. On page 15 of the 1999 Godine reprint, he specifically says that
    <em>The Times</em> used Monotype Modern 7 starting in 1908, replacing Miller and
    Richard Modern.

    of a common term. \r\n\r\nThat was the old roman typeface we were using, and this
    is the new roman. Oh, it's New Roman. Therefore, Old Roman."

  body: "I do not think that the term \u2018The Times Old Roman Type\u2019, for the
    paper\u2019s normal text type, was ever intended as anything but a visual joke
    when it was set for the image that appeared on the cover of the \u2018special
    issue\u2019 of Monotype\u2019s publicity journal, <em>The Monotype Recorder</em>,
    issued in 1932 to promote the new type. (Lawson\u2019s assumption that it was
    a term \u2013 so capitalized \u2013 that was in use before 1932 must indeed one
    of his blunders.) Most of the text of the journal is written in a gushing style
    that means it can only be the the work of Monotype\u2019s new publicity manager,
    Beatrice Warde.\r\n\r\n\u2018The Times Old Roman Type\u2019 of the image, which
    is shown below, does indeed seem to be Monotype\u2019s Modern Extended, their
    Series 7, a revision of Series 1, their first face, which had been derived from
    a type of the Edinburgh typefounders Miller & Richard. \r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/The
    Times New and Old Roman - MR 1932 500_3742.jpg]\r\n\r\nHere are details of the
    lower case and capitals of the 9-point size, from a specimen page printed by Monotype
    in 1971.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Mono Modern Extended 7 - 9
    pt - lc det 500_3954.jpg]\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Mono Modern
    Extended 7 - 9 pt - caps P to T 500_5536.jpg]\r\n\r\nSuch fine hairlines and ink
    traps might have alarmed the printers of mass circulation papers, but <em>The
    Times</em> was different, being set on Monotype machines rather than Linotypes,
    and its small print run was printed slowly on superior paper. It was, as the <em>Monotype
    Recorder</em> cringingly explained to its readers, a paper for \u2018people who
    count\u2019, who were \u2018a wealthy group; a group to which the executives and
    rulers in every walk of life are automatically attracted\u2019.\r\n\r\nBut it
    is worth noting that the note in the <em>Tally of Types</em> concerning the use
    by <em>The Times</em> of Monotype\u2019s Series 7 was almost certainly never written
    by Morison. It does not appear in the first edition, which was made to be \u2018privately
    printed\u2019 in 1953 for his friends by Brooke Crutchley, the University Printer
    at Cambridge, in order to tell the story in Morison\u2019s own words of the making
    of the types cut by Monotype and used at the University Press. Morison died in
    1967, before the \u2018trade edition\u2019 of the book was prepared and published
    in 1973. This edition was reprinted from the original pages by Godine in 1999,
    with the addition of an excellent new introduction by Mike Parker but omitting
    Crutchley\u2019s own preface of 1973, which a pity. \r\n\r\nFor the 1973 edition
    Morison\u2019s original introduction was \u2018revised and amplified by P. M.
    Handover\u2019, who was his research assistant based at <em>The Times</em>. She
    wove his words together with some from Crutchley\u2019s original \u2018postscript\u2019
    of 1953 (which was omitted), inserting not only many details of her own but some
    miscellaneous material that had been put together for the new edition, including
    a contribution of mine. Correspondence at the University Library in Cambridge
    suggests that some aspects of her editorial performance tried Crutchley\u2019s
    patience sorely. \r\n"
