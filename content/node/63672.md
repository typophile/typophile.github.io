    that \"t\" isn't much Helvetica-like. But there's always Handvetica.\r\nhttp://www.dafont.com/handvetica.font\r\n\r\nWhere
    do you found the sample?"

  body: "Woah, even the buttons and icons are custom sketched on the site.\r\n\r\nThe
    site was created by <a href=\"http://www.creative-jar.com/portfolio/case-study/carbonica\">Creative
    Jar</a> and I'd imagine that the font is a custom aspect of their brand.\r\n\r\nEDIT:
    I grabbed a SWF file off the site and took a closer look at how they were handing
    the sketched type. Below you'll see there are individual JPG for each letter.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/custom-letters_5464.jpg]"
