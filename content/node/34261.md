body: "I've stumbled upon an interesting brief: typesetting a translation of Alain
  Ehrenberg's <a href=\"http://www.amazon.fr/Culte-performance-Alain-Ehrenberg/dp/2012789722\">Le
  Culte de la Performance</a> to portuguese. My inicial thoughts are making the whole
  thing as high performance as a book can get* (within out budget constraints, of
  course). Except that brings up the obvious problem of what typeface (or combination
  of typefaces) to use. What would you guys sugest? (lets not get into a readability/legibility
  discussion though)\r\n\r\nShould I go for a sans that screams '20s modernism? or
  should I go for a good serif (arguably more readable, therefore better performance?)
  that we're all used to seeing in books everywhere?  I'm having trouble deciding,
  perhaps one of you can swing my decision either way. \r\n\r\nIt'd be around 260
  pages; so not too long, but not too short either. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n* Though I could
  be swayed the opposite direction and go for as low-performance as we can get to
  emphasize the books content. \r\n"

    Maybe something like Sabon and Univers because of Tschichold? I'd like something
    more contemporary though...\r\n\r\nEhrenberg brings up comparissons between companies
    and athletes alot in the book. So maybe something sportsy and corporate like Insider
    or FF Dax (Nike uses them... in some gear) for the headlines, but any suggestions
    for a serif to match with them?"

  body: "<cite>It\u2019d be around 260 pages</cite>\r\n\r\nEhrenberg's book is 323
    pages, about 63 characters per line, 42 lines per page. Most pages are just a
    block, with one or two indented lines, sometimes one line is skipped. I know that
    French translations of Portuguese litterature generally takes up much more space
    than the original, but it is unclear to me that a Portuguese translation of this
    particular French text would be that much shorter; how did you figure out your
    number of 260 pages?"

    was told the Word file was around 130 pages long, and using our house paragraph
    styles that usually works to be around half of what the final book is (give or
    take some). With around 2000-2100 chrs a page. It's just an estimate anyways and
    I havent seen the actual french print of it. I was told today it had lots of footnotes,
    from the original and some added by the translator... so that might make it grow
    a bit. \r\n\r\nSince you seem to <i>have</i> the original print: have you read
    it? what's it set in? can you suggest some typefaces I could use?"

    I just had a look at it through curiosity. As for the font, I am no expert; I
    could not identify it. My interest with fonts comes from my need to typeset mathematics
    (using pdfLaTeX). The best I can do is show you how the font looks like. Here
    is a picture with a ruler graded in points. This comes from the Calman-Levy edition
    (14x21 cm). The other version is just a reduction to 11x17.5cm.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/IMG_4418_6663.JPG]"
