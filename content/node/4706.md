  body: 'Neat idea.  <BR> <BR>One little nit to pick: The Bembo card states that Bembo
    was &#34;Released in 1495 by Aldus Manutius.&#34; I think this inaccurate and
    misleading.  <BR> <BR>First of all, Aldus&#39; typeface was not called &#34;Bembo.&#34;
    That&#39;s the name Monotype gave <i>their</i> version in 1922. It comes from
    the name of an author of a book printed by Aldus &#40;<i>De Aetna,</i> by Pietro
    Bembo, published by Aldus in 1495&#41;.  <BR> <BR>Second, he didn&#39;t &#34;release&#34;
    it in the sense that we mean today. Aldus was a 15th century printer in Florence,
    Italy. Several types were cut for his use by Francesco Griffo. &#34;Bembo&#34;
    is a modern revival of one of them. It was never made available to the general
    public in Aldus&#39; day the way fonts are today.'
