  still couldn't get to an accurate id for this one, anyone who could please help?\r\n\r\nMy
  first thought had been Times New Roman, yet I wasn't too sure as I couldn't quite
  find a version/weight to match the original... Now also at WhatTheFont again I was
  pointed to Times New Roman, though having been replied there that it \"looks condensed
  by hand rather than original condensed design (serifs are deformed)\".\r\n\r\nThus
  again I'd truly appreciate also your views over it please and thank you so much
  already for any further enlightenment.\r\n\r\n(And yet I\u2019m sorry that some
  of the letters in the image provided are not as legible, but unfortunately I couldn\u2019t
  make a better scan of them... :/)\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/surrender_6168.jpg]"
