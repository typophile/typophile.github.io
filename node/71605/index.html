<p>There is lots of great stuff there. One thing that may be really interesting for Typophile audience, is that it includes support for WOFF format!</p>
<p>In addition, we implemented support for extra properties of @font-face rule: multiple fonts in src property, format() hint, font-weight, font-stretch, font-style and unicode-range.</p>
<p>You can go to <a href="http://ie.microsoft.com/testdrive/">http://ie.microsoft.com/testdrive/</a> to install PBB3 and navigate through demos. Enjoy!</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s right. OpenType fonts are allowed when embedding bits are set to installable. And we implement same-origin restrictions as defined in current CSS3 Font specification, I guess this was not mentioned in release notes of this preview build.</p>

<p>Be thankful for bugs, without them what would little boys like you and me do? One of these days you need to send me your list of bug-report links so we can gang up on all the user-agent folks.
OK. So now IE supports EOT, WOFF and TTF/OTF (with the latter being restricted to fonts with embedding bits set to installable.)
Now we&rsquo;re going to need a Much Mo' Bulletproofer Bulletproof syntax. (Or a javascript switcher.)
More work to do&hellip;.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p><cite>That should describe the issue at hand.</cite></p>
<p>There are three pages in your report on Connect.</p>
<p>First page you mentioned on connect, with single line of text on it, is not downloading anything because this @font-face is not referenced in any element. This is what we fixed comparing to IE8. But if you change the page to reference this rule, you will see that fonts from both ‘src’ declarations are downloaded. We should ignore first one, but we do download it. This is simple bug, thanks for finding it. Overall effect is kind of merged list of fonts from all src declarations on the same rule, instead of using just last one.</p>
<p>Second one, your blog page, only downloads single font from Google. This is what I see in network monitor and under debugger. Let me know if you see something different. Cool mouse effect on canvas, btw.</p>
<p>I guess, main complaint of your bug is about spec compliance on page demoing Deutsch Gothic. Test page contains two fonts on the same ‘src’ list and IE downloads both even first one will sufficient to display the page. Although this may save bandwidth, I do not see this as violation of the spec. ‘Activate’ is not exact word, and it does not define moment when I should or should not start downloading the font, there is no way to prohibit speculative downloads. Said that, I agree that it may be possible to figure out better tuning for cases when we should start downloading particular font. This is not RTM yet, so there is time to work this out.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Sergey: <em>OpenType fonts are allowed when embedding bits are set to installable. </em></p>
<p>And so the notion that <em>document</em> font embedding and web served typography are somehow the same thing is perpetuated. I wish you hadn’t done this. The practical implications are limited, since so few fonts have the document embedding bits set to installable, but it is a misleading confusion of categories. Worse, by arbitrarily limiting the support to fonts with the installable setting, you are equating web served fonts with locally installable fonts, which is exactly the opposite of the impression that the web font standard (WOFF) is designed to promote.</p>

<p>As far as &ldquo;speculative&rdquo; downloading of fonts versus &ldquo;on demand&rdquo; loading - by way of a solution, perhaps something that acts like the &ldquo;defer&rdquo; attribute of the script element would be helpful.
I see three situations:</p>
<ol>
<li>Totally speculative - the font declared is immediately requested</li>
<li>Browser waits to determine if the font is actually used on the page and then requests.</li>
<li>Font is &ldquo;lazy loaded&rdquo; after the page is rendered - as some resources are so as to cache them or &ldquo;defer&rdquo; them. One example would be a font that&rsquo;s only used in a print stylesheet but has no bearing on screen display. Deferred loading would also be useful with italic and bold fonts that, when absent, are simulated by the browser and can thus be more subtly updated when the font arrives than can the &ldquo;normal&rdquo; text.</li>
</ol>
<p>None of this is being discussed in the Fonts WG, but there would be no violation of the spec that I can see, either. In fact, providing these options would enhance interop with Firefox, for one.
This might be worth running by the members of the WG.
Ease of implementation for such a thing? I&rsquo;d be interested to hear.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>@paul irish</p>
<p>I discussed this with Sylvain G and Ethan Dunham (not you too?) some months ago.</p>
<p>In IE9, as long as tagesschrift.ttf has the embedding bits set to installable, my understanding is that IE9 won&rsquo;t and should not &ldquo;double back&rdquo; and grab the EOT.
That not what&rsquo;s happening here?</p>
<p>@font-face {
font-family: tagesschrift;
src: url(&lsquo;<a href="http://paulirish.com/tagesschrift.eot');">http://paulirish.com/tagesschrift.eot');</a> <br>
src: local(&lsquo;☺&rsquo;), url(&lsquo;<a href="http://paulirish.com/tagesschrift.ttf'">http://paulirish.com/tagesschrift.ttf'</a>) format(&ldquo;truetype&rdquo;);
}</p>
<p>Anyway, to prevent such scenario, I was assuming the following would work for both IE9 and IE6-8, too.
@font-face {
font-family: tagesschrift;
src: url(&lsquo;<a href="http://paulirish.com/tagesschrift.eot');">http://paulirish.com/tagesschrift.eot');</a> <br>
src: local(&lsquo;☺&rsquo;), url(&lsquo;<a href="http://paulirish.com/tagesschrift.eot'),url('http://paulirish.com/tagesschrift.ttf'">http://paulirish.com/tagesschrift.eot'),url('http://paulirish.com/tagesschrift.ttf'</a>) format(&ldquo;truetype&rdquo;);
}</p>
<p>IE9 should pass by the first src descriptor and parse the second, stopping when it finds the first file it can use - the EOT.</p>
<p>Haven&rsquo;t tested nothin&rsquo; yet. But I saw this &ldquo;uninstallable TTF causing double download&rdquo; problem coming. IE9 can&rsquo;t know if the TTF is eligible until it downloads and inpects. Then - if you read the spec carefully - it&rsquo;s kind of/sort of OK for it to double back and take the eot in the first descriptor. (It&rsquo;s a little ambiguous but it can be interpreted to allow it. And Sylvain says it was drafted with this scenario in mind.)
Hence, the redundancy in the second version which should produce a single download in all versions of IE.
If not, something&rsquo;s buggy in Denmark. Redmond, too.</p>

<p>Who tells you they are ignored? And why exclusively by IE? AFAIK, font-size-adjust is only suppored by FireFox so far. Of course, we decide what to implement and in what order. But it does not mean we &ldquo;ignore&rdquo; them. In IE8 and even just 7 months ago in IE9, we ignored SVG, Canvas, ECMAScript 5, @font-face rules, WOFF, jscript performance, backgrounds and borders, you get the idea. Anyway, I guess you just missed the wink at the end of my reply.</p>
<p><cite> &gt;Anyway, to prevent such scenario, I was assuming the following would work for both IE9 and IE6-8, too.
<code></p>
<blockquote>
<p>@font-face {
font-family: tagesschrift;
src: url(&lsquo;<a href="http://paulirish.com/tagesschrift.eot');">http://paulirish.com/tagesschrift.eot');</a>
src: local(&lsquo;☺&rsquo;), url(&lsquo;<a href="http://paulirish.com/tagesschrift.eot'),url('http://paulirish.com/tagesschrift.ttf'">http://paulirish.com/tagesschrift.eot'),url('http://paulirish.com/tagesschrift.ttf'</a>) format(&ldquo;truetype&rdquo;);
}
</code></cite></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yes, minus the bug that Paul found. I guess syntax that will work with current IE9 and IE8 and Firefox will be to have three src declarations:</p>
<code>
@font-face {
font-family: tagesschrift;
src: local('☺'), ,url('http://paulirish.com/tagesschrift.ttf') format("truetype");
src: url('http://paulirish.com/tagesschrift.eot');
src: local('☺'), url('http://paulirish.com/tagesschrift.ttf') format("truetype");
}
</code>
<p>This way, IE8 will pick middle one, IE9 Preview 3 will use first, and FireFox+&ldquo;IE9Fixed&rdquo; will use the last. When IE9 Preview 3 is history, you can just remove first one.</p>
<p><cite>&gt; Then - if you read the spec carefully - it&rsquo;s kind of/sort of OK for it to double back and take the eot in the first descriptor.</cite></p>
<p>I assumed that last &lsquo;src&rsquo; is used, and all previous should be ignored. I did not see in the spec anything special said about src, so it should work as other CSS properties. It is a bug in IE9 preview that we request eot from first declaration.</p>
<p><cite>&gt; But I saw this &ldquo;uninstallable TTF causing double download&rdquo; problem coming. IE9 can&rsquo;t know if the TTF is eligible until it downloads and inpects.</cite></p>
<p>Same will happen for any non-compliant, corrupted files, or EOTs with root strings not allowing its use on particular site. I would say browser should be optimistic and expect page author to only reference fonts that can actually be used.</p>
<p>I think we are moving to spec issues that belong more to www-font than typography forum. Lets move further discussions there.</p>

Sergey</p>

<p>So, based on this document, I said what I said. 
I see IE is moving faster, and I am truly delighted!

You were actually looking at two year old Microsoft compatibilty chart. First, it is not saying anything about future plans. Second, more important, if you check last draft of CSS3 Fonts spec only font-size-adjust and font-stretch are still there. And one of them is already working in current preview.</div>

<p>It better be still there, if the W3C&rsquo;s precious @ff is ever going to make a dent in the size of the web.</p>
<p>Sergey, Microsoft let loose the optical sizing of fonts without giving users a clue.
MS invented CT and essentially disqualified the 12 point masters of the world as text on screens.
MS made the CT collection as 14, 16 and 20 point masters and won&rsquo;t fix it, or let others do so. 
MS supports @ff, I think, but then again support is incomplete.</p>
<p>Yes, the chart is old. Yes the future exists. Yes, font-size-adjust and font-stretch are still in CSS.</p>
<p>Any questions?</p>
<p>JC&gt; And so the notion that document font embedding and web served typography are somehow the same thing is perpetuated.</p>
<p>I greatly appreciate all you and some of the WG are doing to try to help Windows users&hellip; but I decided yesterday I just have to &ldquo;stop&rdquo; and &ldquo;wait&rdquo; for more &ldquo;help&rdquo;. I&rsquo;m not holding my or any else&rsquo;s breath on this, so don&rsquo;t worry;)</p>

<p>As I understand it, the font-size-adjust property is designed to adjust relative sizing of fallback fonts so that they match the x-height of the missing specified font, i.e. it is a way of specifying the aspect ratio of the desired font in the CSS so that when that font is not available at least some information about it is available and can be used to calculate adjusted size of substitute fonts. Since one point of @font-face and web served fonts is to reduce the instances of specified fonts not being available, and hence reduce the instances of font fallback &ndash; in an @font-face web, only browsers that don&rsquo;t support @font-face and the served web font format will need font fallback &ndash;, I don&rsquo;t see how font-size-adjust is critical to the success of @font-face. Indeed, I wonder if browser makers are looking at font-size-adjust as a fix for a problem that they expect to largely go away with @font-face web served typography, and hence something that they&rsquo;re not prioritising.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t get me wrong: I think font-size-adjust is a clever idea and one that the web would have benefited from since CSS first came along. Now, though, it looks like a barn-door-closing mechanism, and the horse is running free in a totally different field.</p>
<p>What we really need is a robust mechanism for auto-selection of ppem-specific fonts relative to the varieties of ways in which CSS allows web authors to specify type size (including, now, the 4/3 point virtual pixel!). Yes?</p>

<p>I would like to see something like this. (To the extent that I <em>think</em> I understand what you mean.)
Page Zoom is really a crude resizing mechanism but it&rsquo;s the kind of thing computers do so effortlessly. Recalculate and viola!
I don&rsquo;t think this kind of fine-tuned feature is high on the radar screen for browser makers at this time.
High pixel density screens might provide an impetus. And if those devices actually start giving the OS information about their physical size and the relationship of that size to the device&rsquo;s pixel count, maybe it&rsquo;ll even be implementable.
Right now, I wouldn&rsquo;t even know how to go about constructing a convincing proof of concept.</p>

<p>No. That solution will only work for businesses with the money to pay for ppem-specific fonts and it would also require experienced screen type designers to create said fonts. As nice as it would be for all of us to spend a few weeks on an island learning to create these great screen fonts from masters like you and David, it’s not a realistic option. We would run into the same problem we have with TrueType hinting: the resources to deploy it widely will not exist before the technology is obsolete.</p>
<p>Apple has already solved this problem: develop the best rasterizer possible without worrying about hinting or size-specific designs and get the engineers busy on better LCDs. What we really need is for Microsoft and PC hardware makers to get busy doing what they always do: admit that Apple was right and get to work on a knockoff.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>James, I&rsquo;m not suggesting a mechanism for size-specific fonts is a sole solution for web typography: the majority of web typography will continue to rely on rasterisation of scaled outlines, with or without some amount of hinting. The problem that I seek to address is <em>optimised</em> readability on screen within the context of the variety of rasterisation models now in use and emerging. The dominant rasterisation models, using sub-pixel rendering, decouple outline scaling and size-specific device-dependent outline and spacing adjustments (hinting), either partially, completely or in non-linear fashion. This means that the <em>only</em> way to optimise type for screen is to produce size-specific designs. Let me say that again, in case anyone missed the key word: the <em>ONLY</em> way to optimise type for screen is to produce size-specific designs.</p>
<p>Sub-pixel rasterisation and/or positioning, especially when combined with y-direction greyscale antialiasing, makes the majority of type <em>look</em> better on screen. But looking better is not the same as optimised for readability.</p>
<p>You mention Apple&rsquo;s rendering, but miss the point that by decoupling font scaling from size-specific outline and spacing adjustment, Apple oblige designers seeking to optimise for screen readability to do so at the outline design level, because there isn&rsquo;t any longer any other level. Sure, type on screen under Apple&rsquo;s full-fuzz rendering looks a heck of a lot better than unhinted type used to look, but it can only be optimal at, at most, <em>one size</em>. The only way to increase the range of sizes at which type is optimised for readability is to provide individual fonts for those sizes. That is the only mechanism available by which the designer can control the outline-to-raster-grid relationships, maintain stroke density and affect spacing.</p>
<p>Sure, a mechanism for auto-selection of ppem-specific fonts is something that presumes customers with money to spend on the development of such fonts, and isn&rsquo;t something that is going to replace rasterisation of scaled outlines. But such customers do exist, and it isn&rsquo;t intended to replace anything, only to make possible what is currently impossible: dynamic optimisation of type for reading on screen.</p>

<p>Related to this: IMHO, MSFT&rsquo;s enforcement of the bits will have exactly the opposite effect that I am assuming they think it will have. I just don&rsquo;t get their reasoning.
Because of the potential for causing either a &ldquo;double download&rdquo; or, if there is no EOT as a fallback, no font download at all, I&rsquo;ve been asking myself the question: &ldquo;Well, Rich, what would you advise webdevs to do?&rdquo;
The prudent, rational thing is to change the bits to installable as a matter of best practice. 
How can you ask someone who&rsquo;s trying to get fonts to work on their web page to add to their problems? Especially a problem that&rsquo;s difficult to identify?
If helping to enforce licenses is MSFT&rsquo;s goal, they will get exactly the opposite.
Just my expectation - that&rsquo;s all.</p>

<p>After seeing it, I came away thinking that a precise matchup between screen and print:</p>

I&rsquo;m now wondering how long it will be before larger screens of that quality make it to market.</p>
<p>(My right eye is highly disabled due to wet macular degeneration and I have always been astygmatic in both eyes. The screen on the new iPhone is so superior, I&rsquo;ve decided to sell my current model on Ebay and get the new one. These little smart phone screens drive me crazy, this is the first one that&rsquo;s close to tolerable. About as close to the sharpness of print as I can imagine. Better, really.

<p>As I’ve noted before it will be sooner than anyone thinks. What else is left for display vendors to market? Size, contrast, color depth, and energy efficiency have all become mostly irrelevant relative to cost. And now that LCDs have been selling with long-life lamps for a few years vendors can’t just wait for people to upgrade dead hardware. Hi-resolution screens are coming. The downside is that for the next ten years web designers will have to target screens ranging from 72 to 300+ DPI. Have fun testing that!</p>

<p>Making small high resolution screens for mobile devices is relatively easy and cost effective. But the larger a screen gets the greater the chance of a manufacturing error resulting in a dead pixel. Since such an error means that the whole screen needs to be junked, the attrition costs of manufacturing larger high resolution screens has been considered prohibitive.</p>
<p>I saw my first 200ppi screen twelve years ago. For much of the intervening period I worked daily on first 133ppi and then 144ppi laptop screens. I&rsquo;ve been waiting a long time for widespread adoption of higher resolution computer monitors, and it hasn&rsquo;t happened. Only when screen size came down did resolution start going up. But meanwhile, I&rsquo;ve gone in the opposite direction: my desktop screen is only 96ppi, but is it huge (30&quot;) and I sit further back than I used to.</p>
<p>Want high pixel density? Move your chair.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>At ATypI I raised the question regarding IE’s possible support for raw fonts, and the approach of using the installable embedding bit as an “opt-in” for web site designers using open source, freeware and custom fonts. Even though that concept hasn&rsquo;t been documented yet, I don’t see how it confuses things - Type Squirrel seems to get it. I don’t think anyone could claim ignorance in switching the bits in commercial fonts.</p>
<p>Although naturally type designers and foundries preference is that IE not support raw fonts at all, acting as a roadblock to raw font deployment, that wasn’t an option for the team. I mentioned Acid 3’s inclusion of raw font support in my talk, indicating non-support would be a standards “hole” competitors would exploit.</p>
<p>Certainly ignoring document embedding bits completely would be easier for all concerned. Happy to field type designer and foundry feedback on this question, here or off-list.</p>
<p>Seems as if the thread has taken a bit of a tangent. I for one would love to understand how web designers and users feel about the quality of the commercial fonts used in the demos, compared to the freeware alternatives. Do people consider the quality as something they’d be willing to pay for? Also feelings on DWrite vs other rendering environments.</p>

<p><em>To adjust the sizing of fallback fonts to the user&rsquo;s preference for text, as 1em, is what I understand it to do&hellip;</em></p>
<p>Who do you mean by ‘user’ in this context? The web author or the reader?</p>
<p>The CSS3 spec succinctly defines the role of font-size-adjust like this:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-fonts/#aspect-value">This property allows authors to specify an aspect value for an element that will effectively preserve the x-height of the first choice font, whether it is substituted or not.</a></p>
<p>In any case, even if your understanding were correct, this would still be something that relates specifically to fallback font mechanisms, not to web served typography.</p>
<hr>
<p><em>What, in this analogy does the horse, barn, barn door and field represent?</em></p>
<p>horse = type on the web
barn = locally stored fonts (requiring fallback font mechanisms)
barn door = font.size.adjust
field = web served fonts (no fallback font mechanism required except where web served fonts not supported)</p>
<hr>
<p><em>You can prove this?</em></p>
<p>I thought you had. :)</p>
<p>It follows logically that if the instruction set no longer does what it used to do, i.e. make size-specific outline adjustments relative to the grid, then such adjustments need to be made at the outline creation level, with size-specific fonts. Or, if you want a more precise analysis, with size-specific outline sets, which with present font format technology implies separate fonts. It is possible that the outline sets for different sizes could be incorporated in the same font, but there are drawbacks to this approach: a) outlines fit best to grid if the UPM varies to a multiple of the design grid for each size and b) it won&rsquo;t work for fonts with really big character sets, e.g. Chinese, because you&rsquo;ll hit the 64k glyph limit.</p>
<hr>
<p><em>But being coupled to a specific set of h-ware, makes a big difference. And, decoupling x font scaling from y font scaling does the same thing as yo u say, but in an open hardware environment, it&rsquo;s&hellip; different, don&rsquo;t chya know?</em></p>
<p>No argument from me there. Apple, Microsoft, Adobe, and anyone else using sub-pixel rendering/positioning and/or ignoring some or all of the instruction set are pushing optimisation of on screen type onto the outline. James was suggesting that Apple&rsquo;s rendering somehow solves the issue of readable text on screen. Leaving aside the fact that I think ClearType does a better job of maintaining stroke density consistency and, as you say, Apple has the advantage of (mostly) not operating in an open hardware environment (Safari on Windows is a wild rendering ride), I&rsquo;d say, rather, that by providing the lowest common denominator of instruction support Apple defines how size-specific outline creation needs to be done to optimise a design for a given size across the majority of rendering environments. In other words, if all sub-pixel rendering worked like ClearType, we&rsquo;d only need to optimise outlines horizontally relative to the grid, and could hint in the other direction. But Apple&rsquo;s rendering obliges us to optimise outlines in both directions.</p>

<p>I agree that the &ldquo;Retina display&rdquo; on the new iPhone is truly stunning. I will certainly upgrade. I am however wondering how long it will be before we see 300+ ppi on larger screens, and at what price. I&rsquo;m sure it will happen, but I&rsquo;m not so sure it will be next week. (Not that I claim any inside knowledge on this point, just skepticism.) I was surprised and disheartened when the iPad came out with only 1024x768&hellip; not much better ppi on that than on my 18.4&quot; HP laptop with 1920x1080, and noticeably worse than the original iPhone.</p>
<p>Embedding bits: You and Ethan may not care much, but I&rsquo;m sure that many font vendors will view modifying embedding bits as a violation of their EULA. I expect this is true even of some that otherwise allow modifications to their fonts. Then again, many of those same folks wouldn&rsquo;t permit their fonts to be self-hosted by customers on public web sites, either.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Si: <em>I mentioned Acid 3’s inclusion of raw font support in my talk, indicating non-support would be a standards “hole” competitors would exploit.</em></p>
<p>Except Acid 3 is not a standard and was not created by a standards body. It was created by WaSP, which is an industry advocacy group, and represents a cherry-picked selection of features that best apply the pressure members of that group wish to apply (apparently successfully in the case of IE9&rsquo;s raw font support).</p>
<p>I find little to disagree with in Eric Meyer&rsquo;s <a href="http://meyerweb.com/eric/thoughts/2008/03/27/acid-redux/">critique of Acid 3</a>.</p>
<hr>
<p>Rich: <em>The prudent, rational thing is to change the bits to installable as a matter of best practice.
How can you ask someone who&rsquo;s trying to get fonts to work on their web page to add to their problems? Especially a problem that&rsquo;s difficult to identify?
If helping to enforce licenses is MSFT&rsquo;s goal, they will get exactly the opposite.</em></p>
<p>And so it goes, Si.</p>
<p>You could have defined a new fsType bit for raw font web serving permission, which would have precisely targeted the needs of open source, freeware and custom font makers and users, without confusing document embedding with web font serving. Remember, one of the principle reasons for developing a dedicated web font format is to draw a line between existing desktop fonts and web fonts. You could have done the same thing for raw font serving permissions, and avoided the implication that any existing font with an installable document embedding bit setting is licensed for web serving. If you feel Acid 3 compels you to support raw font linking in some way, you have rather more say in just what way than most other browser makers. You do, after all, own the OT font specification. :)</p>

<p>It’s really going to come down to patents. If Apple developed something really amazing in-house to make Retina Displays we might have to wait for the lawyers to work everything out (and right now Apple can afford a lot of litigation). Hopefully this is licensed tech like multi-touch and Dell, HP, HTC, etc. can start going bonkers with it next year.</p>

<p>Since the moment format was standardized the version of the spec posted on my site follows the ISO version. As an example the current ISO amendment changes won&rsquo;t be reflected on my site until the changes are ratified by ISO.

<p>Which suggests that you believe that font-size-adjust has some crucial role in @font-face. My point is that font-size-adjust is targeted at font fallback mechanisms that will be of diminished importance as use of web served typography increases. I&rsquo;m not saying that font-size-adjust isn&rsquo;t important, I&rsquo;m saying that it doesn&rsquo;t seem to be important in the way you suggested it is important. It&rsquo;s a way of improving the current situation of locally stored fonts and fallback, and would only be relevant to @font-face where the latter fails due to lack of web font support.</p>

<p>In what sense is optimising vertically a given on the Mac?

<p>But those other browser makers are not respecting any fsType embedding bits with regard to web served fonts. As David points out, Microsoft is the only company that has produced an @font-face implementation that associates a document embedding bit with web served fonts. As you know, I&rsquo;d prefer MS not to support any sushi in Internet Explorer, and I disagree with all the reasons put forward for doing so, and I think browser makers and font makers alike should tell WaSP where to stick their Acid 3 test, but if you&rsquo;re going to support some raw fonts while at the same time self-imposing a limit on your support related to embedding bits, why not define a bit that clearly means &lsquo;web serving for Internet Explorer allowed&rsquo;, rather than assuming that a font that is technically able to be installed from a document embedded status is also allowed to be served on the web?</p>
<p>So now, people like Rich are going to change embedding bits to installable in order to make raw fonts work in IE, those raw fonts are going to end up in user caches, and, oh look, they&rsquo;re ‘installable’. Sure any number of licenses will be broken along the way, with the possibility of font makers pursuing legal action in response, but we have better things to do with our time and our limited resources. As I&rsquo;ve said for a year now: there is no way to support raw fonts on the web that does not expose all existing desktop fonts to casual unlicensed installation and use on recipient&rsquo;s computers and to unlicensed use as web fonts through circumvention of embedding bits or other limitations within the TTF/OTF. <em>So just don&rsquo;t do it.</em></p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>John H:</p>
<p>I think I disagree with you, if I understand what you&rsquo;re arguing.</p>
<p>Richard Fink is suggesting that web font processing tools should process existing fonts to change their fsType bits to &ldquo;installable.&rdquo; You take that as evidence that using the absence of the &ldquo;installable&rdquo; setting to mean the fonts are not OK as raw-TTF web fonts is a bad idea, and a new embedding bit should have been invented instead.</p>
<p>I have two problems with your line of argument.</p>
<p>First, if a new embedding bit had been invented, don&rsquo;t you think that Richard would be saying web-font-processing tools should be setting that bit? How on earth would that help?</p>
<p>Second, I don&rsquo;t see the use of the installable setting the same way you do. I see it as &ldquo;if the bits are NOT set to installable, then we&rsquo;re not giong to process the font. if the bits ARE set to installable, then we&rsquo;ll process the font&hellip; but that doesn&rsquo;t trump the EULA.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s exactly the way I understand the existing uses of embedding bits advising apps on what to do with fonts for actual document embedding, as well. A font may be set to preview and print embedding, but that doesn&rsquo;t mean it&rsquo;s okay for that under all circumstances. There may be additional strictures, and you still need to read the EULA. Maybe it has commercial PDF restrictions, or it requires extra money if you use the PDF anywhere outside the organization that licensed  the font in the first place, or it only allows you to embed fonts in documents if they are never viewed on Thursdays.</p>
<p>All that being said, I actually do agree that inventing a new bit would have been preferable to overloading the meaning of &ldquo;installable&rdquo; in this way (even though MS originally intended for these bits to apply to web fonts). I just don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s a huge deal, either.</p>
<p>The stakeholders in the Open Font Format (OpenType) spec could still rally &lsquo;round and try to get some such change through. I think it would be a fine thing. We&rsquo;d need to have a firm proposal: is the new bit a positive or negative one, do we need two bits just to get around the issue of existing fonts not having a setting, or do we rev the OS/2 table version?</p>

<p>well, let me put it another way: size of type and color of type are not things publishers want to have <em>this</em> unplanned forever. ;)</p>

<p>Well you&rsquo;ve all had several years to support this suggestion made long-ago. But instead, you&rsquo;ve used the same old excuses to create a techno-legal nightmare for publishers and placed a huge bleep of trouble into your own, Fink-ish, and user&rsquo;s hands.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Tom, I think you&rsquo;ve missed the train of my argument and have associated two distinct objections.</p>
<p>My first objection is to any support of raw fonts in web served typography. I believe it is both undesirable and unnecessary, and that the arguments made in favour of it are weak in light of the vulnerabilities &ndash; vis à vis existing desktop fonts and casual piracy &ndash; that it inevitably introduces. What Rich suggests is simply evidence of the vulnerability and the quickness with which it will be exploited. That he would, as you point out, presumably make the same suggestion re. any new embedding bit is simply further evidence of the inherent vulnerability in all raw font linking.</p>
<p>My second objection is that <em>if</em> Microsoft is going to implement support for raw font linking but with a self-imposed limitation, that limitation should not be based on associating an existing document embedding bit with web served typography. It perpetuates the confusion of document embedding and web font linking, introduced by EOT and now simply made more confusing by implying that web linkable = installable.</p>
<p>The first objection overrides the second one: the best thing is simply not to offer any support for raw font linking. It isn&rsquo;t necessary, especially not in a browser that already supports a legacy EOT format and a soon-to-be-W3C-standard WOFF format.</p>

<p>Could it be something Eve gave to Adam a bite of? But my suggestion is that IE9, before it’s released, should go back to what IE8 did for font linking. IE8 is still being advertised during &ldquo;That FIFA Show&rdquo;, so it’ll be a while before IE9 can go anywhere anyway.</p>

<p>And here is where we basically disagree(d). Any new format is an inviting gateway to copyright and trademark violation, as you see, as opposed to a simple licensing issue that’s solved more “naturally”. Any new format makes the browsers, (which employ the end user&rsquo;s device(s) to make derivative software), into agents of violation. Any new format spawns conversion programs to that format, and these can do &ldquo;whatever&rdquo; to “whatever” as you see. And, a new format splintered the effort to get one good format.</p>
<p>JC&gt; The first objection overrides the second one:</p>
<p>Objections overruled. There is no OT format, it’s just a name used by MS and Adobe referring to an ISO spec. That spec. contains the ClearType that’s mangling readability, and does not provide to users the results of hinting ISO sought when they started OFF. WOFF can’t gather meta-data alone (if ever), and whatever surprises were to be in the “Private Data”, WOFF is not “the web standard”, so no one will make conversion software that retains it, would you? And the CSS type spec. is not well enough informed to meet the challenges of real typography on the web, anyway.</p>
<p>I’d say this is actually better than watching baseball played with a butterfly and nets instead of a ball and gloves. It&rsquo;s just sad when young readers get in the way.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>(There&rsquo;s lots of good questions and points on this thread. I chose to focus on the following for now.)</p>
<p>Sprach Thomas Phinney:</p>
<p><em>Embedding bits: You and Ethan may not care much, but I&rsquo;m sure that many font vendors will view modifying embedding bits as a violation of their EULA.</em></p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t speak for Ethan but I actually &ldquo;care&rdquo; a lot. Contrary to popular belief, I&rsquo;m a stare decisis kind of guy and not naturally inclined to throw out a system that the industry has relied on for a number of years. Not without a good reason. Not without thinking things through.
But I think everybody on this thread realizes that the system as it stands isn&rsquo;t going to work on the web. Yet, in IE9, MSFT has decided to break with the pack, stick with the bits, and load only &ldquo;raw&rdquo; fonts set to installable embedding.</p>
<p>A couple of points:</p>
<p>Yesterday I found myself reading a short piece in the Harvard Journal of Law &amp; Public policy about the concept of &ldquo;necessity&rdquo; as a legitimate defense to all kinds of otherwise illegal activity. (The article was about &ldquo;necessity&rdquo; in regards to the seizure of private property for public purpose under Eminent Domain.)
The question it raised for me was: Under what circumstances might &ldquo;necessity&rdquo; be reasonably viewed as a valid rationale for infringement and/or the breaking of a EULA contract? Even in just a moral, if not strictly legal, sense?
IE9 puts web devs in a position where, if the embedding bits aren&rsquo;t a certain way, the font doesn&rsquo;t work interoperably across browsers. And it won&rsquo;t work in what will become the world&rsquo;s most popular browser: IE9. And, presumably, IE10, 11, and 12, too.
(Yeah, yeah, they can make a WOFF, an EOT, whatever. That&rsquo;s IF they know what their options are.)
At FontCONF in St. Paul last week, I led a session of about, I think, 40 or so designers. People who - even if they aren&rsquo;t web designers per se - are at least font minded or else they wouldn&rsquo;t have been at the conference. At one point I asked the entire group if they knew that there was such a thing as an embedding bit. Except for a small group of type designers and a few cogniscenti, all I got was a bunch of blank stares. Embedding bits? <em>They had no idea what I was talking about</em>.</p>
<p> *Before the web, enforcement of the bits was built into software. Why <em>would</em> anybody know about it - the software took care of it. But on the web it&rsquo;s different, and we&rsquo;ve moved to an honor system of sorts. Except that nobody understands there&rsquo;s even a system, let alone what &ldquo;honorable&rdquo; behavior is expected. This is the reality, folks. And in any rational strategy, it must be taken into account *</p>
<p>Once having purchased a license, which may or may not be refundable, what should a web developer do to get that font to work interoperably? How many hours should they spend? How many EULAs should they try to decipher? Everybody&rsquo;s got families to feed and bosses to satisfy and there is very much a &ldquo;necessity&rdquo; involved in getting the font to work right and load as efficiently as possible.
If there were no legal considerations at all, changing the bits to installable for every font would be considered a best practice. Period. And since the average web customer will probably be unaware that there are special restrictions expected of them beyond the payment of the initial license fee and the download of the font file, what do you think they are going to do?
They are going to <em>serve their own self-interests</em>, their own <em>necessity</em> and change the bits.</p>
<p>(I do think, however, that most web buyers will realize that redistribution is generally verbotten. But that&rsquo;s about it as far as prohibitions.)</p>
<p>Why put web developers in a position where they have to choose like this? Why force a situation where many will unknowingly break the fine print in the contract?
What&rsquo;s the point of this? I&rsquo;m missing it.</p>

<p>If IE didn&rsquo;t support any raw font linking, the options would be more obvious: WOFF for up-to-date browsers and EOT(-Lite) for backwards compatibility in IE6-8. The idea that a desktop installable font <em>might</em> be legitimately served to the web is the primary source of confusion over web font licensing, and this is why a distinct web font format greatly simplifies the situation for users: WOFF = made for web, TTF/OTF = not made for web.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>David, WOFF is going to be the web font standard in the only sense that anything on the web is standard: formally defined as a standard by the W3C consortium. WOFF is going to be the only web font standard; all other formats are, according to that standard, optional. WOFF is a container for an OT font. Both the OT font and the container may contain metadata. Metadata may be formally defined in terms of standard fields in the WOFF spec or formal additions to the OT spec, or it may be private and extensible (and some of your colleagues worked hard against considerable resistance to make sure that a structure for extensible metadata made it into the WOFF spec). Both the WOFF spec and the CSS3 spec are in process, which means that they are open to revision and subject to change, so dismissing either of these standards as ‘not well enough informed to meet the challenges of real typography on the web’ is premature. They will ultimately be as well informed as we strive to make them, which means engaging in the process. I suppose it&rsquo;s heck of a lot less work to criticise something as inadequate from the start, not engage with other people on improving it, and then say ‘See, I told you so’, but there&rsquo;s a well known analogy about a pot and what you should do or get off it.</p>
<p>Sorry. Part of me would love for the whole web typography bag to be put under your diktat, with everyone from system and browser makers to your fellow font designers simply saying ‘David’s right, and we should just implement whatever he says.’ But that isn&rsquo;t going to happen and if you want to influence what does happen then you either need to be engaged in the standards process or communicate your ideas <em>clearly</em> to someone who is. I volunteer. Seriously, I think you are substantially right about a lot of things, and I <em>try</em> to communicate what I understand you to mean and make sure that it is heard where it matters, but then you keep saying things that make me think I must have misunderstood you last time.</p>

<p>Microsoft deliberately retained control of the OT specification, which is maintained independently of the ISO OFF specification. There is, to my knowledge, no formal agreement between Microsoft and ISO that says these specifications must remain in sync &ndash; i.e. in the formal, legal way that Unicode and ISO 10646 must remain in sync &ndash;, only the will of the parties that being in sync is a good idea.</p>
<p>[Adobe? I&rsquo;m not sure anyone who wasn&rsquo;t party to the original Microsoft/Adobe OT agreement actually knows what Adobe&rsquo;s stake in all this is any more.]</p>
<p>Neither the Microsoft OT spec nor the ISO OFF spec ‘contains &hellip; ClearType’. ClearType is a Microsoft rendering technology (variously implemented in different MS products). It isn&rsquo;t mentioned anywhere in the OT/OFF spec, any more than Adobe&rsquo;s CoolType or Apple&rsquo;s Quartz are mentioned.</p>
<p>You surely know all this, so why are you making these bizarre and nonsensical statements?</p>

<p>Oh, you&rsquo;re such a pessimist. Again with the dead pixels!
Due to industry secrecy it&rsquo;s very hard to get info on upcoming advances in display technology.
Maybe sii, considering his vantage point, might be able to shed some light on when we might see some Retina-like displays at larger sizes.</p>
<p>One thing I found, too, with the Retina display, is that not only was I able to rely much less on Zoom to get to a readable text size but also, since I was able to read the type within the overall visual context of the page, it also helped in comprehension and navigation. I didn&rsquo;t feel like the fly that&rsquo;s landed on the portrait painting, like I sometimes do. (Wasn&rsquo;t there a game show that had a segment with that as the basis?)</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve always found having to pan and scan the page within a moving window of magnification to be very disorienting.
Much less of that with the higher res. An added bonus.</p>
<p>With regards to the technical issues you&rsquo;ve raised: you&rsquo;re absolutely right, of course. To the practiced eye, fidelity to the letter form IS compromised.
The question is how many people are going to really give much of a hoot about it.</p>
<p>The answer for those bothered by it might simply be the one DB mentioned. If you want that kind of resolution and fidelity: Print it! It&rsquo;s never been easier or cheaper to turn to print.</p>

<p>Sure. Absolutely. Happily. Creatively. But in a lot of cases they may not know what changes are being made. All they know or care about is that the &ldquo;software product&rdquo; they have modified now works, and before the modification it didn&rsquo;t. Broken versus not broken.
And in most cases they have an unquestionable right to do such modifications.
So, agreed!</p>
<p>If you or anybody or the &ldquo;one browser developer&rdquo; are looking for the embedding bits to provide some kind of lightweight DRM, that will only work if the embedding bits are preserved as is. The Catch-22 is that by breaking the font for IE9 unless it has the bits set to installable this helps ensure that the bits <em>won&rsquo;t</em> be preserved as is. A vicious cycle. Helps nothing. It will inconveniences many, though.
A great way to build a market for fonts.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Not so quickly.</p>
<p>Since you come up with this again and again, some quick notes on licensing fonts, EULAs, and &ldquo;necessity&rdquo; to violate EULA and modify fonts:</p>
<p><strong>1)</strong> Whenever you license a font, or any other software, an online shop will present you the EULA &ndash; and you cannot proceed with the order process unless you have (actively) clicked a checkbox to express your consent. If you haven&rsquo;t read the EULA, you haven&rsquo;t read it deliberatedly. There is no &ldquo;Ups, I didn&rsquo;t know.&rdquo; There only is a &ldquo;Hehe, I didn&rsquo;t want to know.&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong>2)</strong> You don&rsquo;t buy a font, or any other software, you pay a fee for the right to use it as specified in the EULA. If you don&rsquo;t like the latter, just don&rsquo;t license this font.</p>
<p><strong>3)</strong> Since agreeing to the EULA is part of the licensing process, and since fsType expresses in bits what the EULA expresses in words, it is not an option that the designer/user is surprised about the font unexpectedly not doing some things.</p>
<p><strong>4)</strong> If &ldquo;the font doesn&rsquo;t work interoperably across browsers&rdquo; as you try to argue for your right to modify fonts (changing fsType), then most likely the font was <em>never meant</em> to be used as a web font in the first place. No &ldquo;interoperability&rdquo; issue. Nothing &ldquo;broken&rdquo;. Obviously you decided to ignore the EULA.</p>
<p><strong>5)</strong> In the rather unlikely case that fsType has been set wrongly &ndash; if a font is advertised as web font but fsType settings prevent a browser from showing it &ndash; contact the foundry so they can correct this by themselves, probably library-wide. Foundries do communicate, provide service, etc.</p>
<p>In short, the &ldquo;problem&rdquo; which you are trying to construct doesn&rsquo;t exist. No need for a <em>designer/user</em> to modify or convert fonts which, again, is not and will not not be permitted by most EULAs. If you don&rsquo;t like that, avoid such fonts. Moreover, you are trying to reduce it to a mere technical problem (some bits set &ldquo;wrongly&rdquo;, font being &ldquo;broken&rdquo;) which it isn&rsquo;t. It is an agreement problem.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s pretty Janus-faced of you <strong>1)</strong> that you refer to &ldquo;them&rdquo; (designers/users) as people who just don&rsquo;t know about EULAs kind of as a cheap excuse while <strong>2)</strong> that it&rsquo;s actually you, on multiple channels (blog posts, articles, EOTFast manual), who tells &ldquo;them&rdquo; that fonts need to be fixed &ndash; and how to do it. It is not &ldquo;them&rdquo; who think fonts are &ldquo;broken&rdquo;, it&rsquo;s you who tells &ldquo;them&rdquo; so.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Karsten, re. your point no.3:</p>
<p><em>fsType expresses in bits what the EULA expresses in words</em></p>
<p>Part of the issue with fsType embedding bits is that they do not, in fact, express the EULA. Obviously a font maker should try to set the embedding bits so that they are not in conflict with the EULA, but there isn&rsquo;t necessarily a clean relationship between the relatively crude options in the embedding bits and the much more precise legal permissions of the license agreement. And the relationship only gets messier if, as in this case, Microsoft defines a novel software behaviour relative to the embedding bits. It is perfectly possible that a font might be installable from an embedded document, both in terms of fsType setting and EULA terms, <em>and not licensed for web use.</em> Similarly, a font might be licensed for web use and, for IE9 compatibility, have its embedding bit set to installable, <em>but not be licensed to be installed on a recipient&rsquo;s system.</em></p>

<em>Orthogonal to all this, I would point out that after installing the IE9 preview on my Win7 box, the difference between the Meta Web WOFF demo page in IE9 and Firefox 3.6 is night and day. IE9 is the best rendering I&rsquo;ve seen yet. FF3.6 is cross-eyed by comparison.</em></p>
<p>You&rsquo;re comparing underlying font rendering API&rsquo;s here.  IE8/Chrome/FF3.6 render text via GDI, the developer release of IE9 is using the Win7/Vista-only DirectWrite API which includes better font rasterization.  Support for DirectWrite rendering is already supported in nightly builds of Firefox and hopefully will ship enabled by default in the next version of Firefox.  XP users (60% worldwide OS share) will see the same font rendering as before.</p>
<p>As for Safari on Windows, it uses GDI rendering by default but switching a pref enables the use of a ported version of Apple&rsquo;s font rasterizer.  Although WebKit is open source, the font rasterizer is closed source so it&rsquo;s Safari-only.  In general, it does a far better job of rendering unhinted ttf fonts.</p>

<p>My take can be summed up by: Be careful what you wish for, because you just might get it.</p>
<p>MSFT will ultimately do what it sees as being in its own best interest, I suppose. I don&rsquo;t know what other motivation they would have. We&rsquo;ll see.</p>

		<div class="commentbody">David, letter drawing is where it&rsquo;s at. So who needs help at this point? Anyone who wants to get a letter displayed at the size for which it is drawn in a situation in which the person coding the web content has no way to know at what ppem the text will be displayed to the reader. That seems to me the critical issue for optimised web typography, because no amount of font use ‘recommendations’ and no amount of size-specific outline designs will do any good if there is no standard and predictable mechanism by which those designs are selected and displayed for the appropriate sizes <em>regardless of which of half a dozen or more different font size units are coded in the CSS.</em> And bearing in mind that even a pixel is, apparently, no longer a pixel.</div>

<p>&ldquo;Actual&rdquo; size, (more or less actual size) is needed. &ldquo;Relative&rdquo; is fine. There no other request besides that &ldquo;absolute&rdquo; be based on a reasonable register of sizes (with a 1.1 factor between sizes ala Firefox). This is a problem, but as you say nothing maeks any difference is capricious decisions are made at Redmond, where one month there is no way they&rsquo;ll support OT on the web, and next month they can&rsquo;t see any other choice, and next month.. and so on.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>David, what do you mean by actual size? I would take that to mean measurable size of displayed type, but perhaps you means something else?</p>
<p>The problem as I see it is that if one is drawing outlines sets optimised to specific pixel grids then ppem is the selection criterion for the desired outline set. That means one needs to know the ppem size of font to be displayed at a nominal/actual size*, which is of course resolution dependent. It&rsquo;s the familiar triangulation of nominal size, device resolution and ppem size. Knowing any two of these things allows you to calculate the third.</p>
<p>Now, what normally happens with scalable outline fonts is that the calculation to determine what ppem size to render occurs locally, at the point at which the text is rendered on the reader&rsquo;s device. That is the point at which the rendering engine knows the two parts of information it needs &ndash; the nominal type size and the local device resolution &ndash; to be able to calculate the ppem size to display.</p>
<p>Okay, so if we&rsquo;re envisaging a system in which a rendering engine, instead of scaling a single outline set to a particular ppem size, calls a size-specific outline set, then either the font delivery mechanism needs to be informed what the appropriate ppem will be and deliver the correct outline set, or the rendering engine needs to be able to select the appropriate outline set from available sets for the locally determined ppem size. Within this basic split of approaches, I can imagine numerous practical implementations involving various ways of packaging and delivering the different outline sets. A single font containing multiple outline sets, for example, obviously fits into the second model &ndash; post-delivery selection from available sets rather than requested delivery of s specific set &ndash;, but I can think of at least three reasons why this is a less than optimal model (and hence why I don&rsquo;t think GSUB is a good solution to size-specific type): TTF/OTF fonts have a built in limit to glyph set size; to truly optimise outlines to the pixel grid, different sets benefit from different UPMs; downloading all possible sizes for web fonts before making a selection for a particular size is a bandwidth issue.</p>
<hr>
<p>*For the purpose of this discussion, we might as well consider nominal and actual to be the same thing, taking into account your ‘more or less’. In other words, we&rsquo;ll presume that if a web designer has specified type in e.g. points in the CSS then the actual size will be something reasonably close to the nominal size, taking into account rounding of the scaled UPM to the ppem height.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>JH&gt; David, what do you mean by actual size?</p>
<p>ppm = dev.res./points per inch. the holy grid.</p>
<p>Just to reiterate, font size adjustment is just something peculiarly useful on the web vs. print. In print, when a designer executes a font style change to a document (of fixed-size), they recompose.</p>
<p>Here’s what’d happen, e.g., if Youtube wanted to just use Comic Sans as a Custom Web Font. . .</p>
<p><img src="/images/old-images/comicutube2_5806.png" alt="">
Comic Relief I, perhaps.</p>
<p>Some designs and some fonts, need not worry about a font style change requiring recomposition, but then again, lots of sites can’t afford to rewrite their css unless there is that little bit of leverage in the recomposition software to account for @ff&rsquo;s diversification of type metrics.</p>
<p>And the lack of this command is not just one thing, it&rsquo;s also another. ;)</p>
<p>Comic Relief II</p>
<p><img src="/images/old-images/MSVS_5925.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Now of course the type designer is at fault for not doing all the glyphs, but how&rsquo;s the user ever going to know that. I mean, it&rsquo;s Microsoft&rsquo;s fault as far as the user can tell, (even if this is on a Mac in Firefox. ;)</p>
<p>JH &gt;For the purpose of this discussion, we might as well consider nominal and actual to be the same thing, taking into account your ‘more or less’.</p>
<p>“More or less”, was in the context of the difference between the PS, TeX and Linotype versions of 72.xxx points per inch. We had this discussion a while ago — I said it’s pretty funny that one can select “smaller” in a browser, and if they already selected “smallest”, then their type will get bigger? The chorus said points are a dead measurment.</p>
<p>JH &gt;&hellip;the point at which the rendering engine knows the two parts of information it needs &ndash;</p>
<p>It never does ever know exactly, if one part is really distance of use, and the other part is actual size of type. The first is guessed at by the various developers, sometimes in concert, like in Apple environments, sometimes&hellip; not so concerted. The actual size, as we know, is unknown until the user sees it.</p>
<p>JH &gt;Okay, so if we&rsquo;re envisaging a system&hellip; to be able to select the appropriate outline set from available sets for the locally determined ppem size.</p>
<p>You can envisage this, but you cannot execute it, except forever. ;)</p>
<p>The bottom lines for me on IE9 is that it closes one loop-hole in the founder&rsquo;s need to worry about jumping through the hinting -hoop &ldquo;just so&rdquo;,  and IP-wise, it&rsquo;s the end of any sort of pretext of helping founders much.</p>

<p>Given that there are the traditional web-safe fonts, and web font subscription services (including—shameless plug—our own WebINK at Extensis), all of which avoid these issues and the &ldquo;need&rdquo; to modify fonts, an argument of &ldquo;necessity&rdquo; to illegally modify font software holds not even a ml of water. Neither legal nor moral necessity applies.</p>
<p>(I recognize that there are fonts for which it would not be illegal to make a modification to the embedding bits; the question at hand was that if such modification were forbidden by the EULA, could it be justified by &ldquo;necessity&rdquo;?)</p>
<p>Cheers,</p>
<p>T</p>
<p>P.S. The only plausible exception I could see would be a case where the text could not be displayed without a custom font (say, some really obscure language), <em>and</em> the display of that text on a web page was somehow vital to life and limb or at least general welfare. Then you might make a case of &ldquo;necessity,&rdquo; but it seems like a pretty improbable corner case. But sure, I&rsquo;ll recognize the theoretical possibility.</p>

Congrats on the WebINK Beta. Gonna check it out. Bought a Mac, too, so maybe I&rsquo;ll invest in Suitcase for it.</p>
<p>TP&gt;an argument of &ldquo;necessity&rdquo; to illegally modify font software holds not even a ml of water.
OK. But I&rsquo;m beginning to think I miswrote or wrote unclearly somewhere along the line on this thread.
Allow me a &ldquo;do over&rdquo;. Maybe I got too lofty for my own good.</p>
<p>All I am trying to say - and this is not overreach - is that word will get around that if you try to use fonts, because of IE9, there is a hidden &ldquo;gotcha&rdquo;.
Not TTF or OTF, JUST FONTS, PERIOD!
That&rsquo;s not good for font vendors who ask money for their product, not good for the &ldquo;free&rdquo; font people, not good for web designers and site owners, not good for frackin' anybody.</p>
<p>JUST ANOTHER BARRIER, JUST ANOTHER STUPID PROBLEM. JUST ANOTHER MISCONCEPTION TO EVERCOME.</p>
<p>And what a great marketing strategy for everybody concerned: LET&rsquo;S MAKE FONTS HARDER TO USE!!</p>
<p>Fonts for self-hosting are being sold now, today. How the heck do you know that you won&rsquo;t be totally on board with that a few years from now? 
You don&rsquo;t and you can&rsquo;t because if people ain&rsquo;t buyin' subscriptions to the fonts umbilically connected to your servers and the guys selling fonts for self-hosting are making money, you (or the folks who are your suppliers right now) are danged well going to do it. (One, I know of, already is.)</p>
<p>At that point, there are always going to be some customers who will host the fonts raw right along with EOT and WOFF no matter what your license says. (Are we going to live in the real world or not?) They&rsquo;ll convert to SVG without permission, too. They paid their money and F-CK YOU will be their attitude. Do you think IE10 won&rsquo;t have the SVG fonts module in it and this whole installability thing will become a joke?
Do you expect that customers will come back eager to pay for an expanded license?
As far as I can see, absolutely nothing is being deterred THAT&rsquo;S WORTH THE OVERALL COST.
Maybe I&rsquo;m missing it, what is being deterred that&rsquo;s worth the hassle to everybody?</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t see me complaining about same-origin restrictions, do you? Well, there are some people who <em>are</em> bothered by it. And they are as entitled as me to their opinion. It&rsquo;s their web, too, but I don&rsquo;t see it as an issue of principal.
But when you&rsquo;re talking about one browser breaking interop because of a hidden &ldquo;bit&rdquo; within the &ldquo;font software&rdquo; when the font software can&rsquo;t know what the heck my rights to the font are or aren&rsquo;t, well, screw that.
On the web, the free and the paid swim in the same pond and they all catch the same diseases.
It&rsquo;s stupid from a PR perspective for Microsoft to do it. Just another proprietary piece of bullsh-t from the folks that brought us IE6 - that&rsquo;s what will be said.
IT&rsquo;S NOT WORTH THE COST.
IE9 buys into the whole standards-based developer wish-list.
Why nickle and dime over this when it won&rsquo;t do a damned thing?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s it. I&rsquo;m taking my bat, my balls, and I&rsquo;m goin' home now.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I actually agree that it would be simpler and better if IE 9 just skipped raw TTF/OTF support altogether, that than to do it, but do it differently than everybody else. This is aside from any questions about whether the approach used by IE is &ldquo;reasonable&rdquo; or any such debates, just as a matter of practicality.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t necessarily see people taking existing TTF/OTF fonts and twiddling the embedding bits to make them work with IE 9, however. Why wouldn&rsquo;t they just use EOT (which they&rsquo;ll need to have for IE 8 and earlier)? Only after old versions of IE fade away could this become an issue.</p>

		<div class="commentbody">What I still don&rsquo;t quite understand is why it&rsquo;s not possible to create a font rasterizer that does a better job with unhinted TrueType fonts.  For example, unhinted Japanese TrueType fonts at default browser text sizes are still relatively unreadable, even with DirectWrite.  Apple&rsquo;s font rasterizer, which ignores hinting, does a much better job with these fonts.  Sure, it gives “fuzzy” results compared to a properly hinted version of the same font but hinting is a <strong>huge</strong> cost in the case of Japanese given the large number of glyphs that need hinting for a basic web font (at a minimum 3000-6000 glyphs) and the relative complexity of the glyphs involved.</div>

<p><em>The browser&rsquo;s standards conformance has been improved, too. It now earns a score of 95/100 in the Acid3 test. The five failing tests are all in areas of the SVG specification that are in transition; SVG fonts and SVG SMIL animation. The SVG working group is considering making SVG fonts optional, as WOFF fonts—which Internet Explorer 9 will support—appear to be the standard that has gained momentum. In a world with widespread WOFF support, SVG fonts are unnecessary. The Mozilla project is taking a similar stance.</em></p>
<p>In the penultimate sentence ‘SVG fonts’ can be replaced by ‘naked TTF/OTF fonts’ and the statement is just as valid. More valid, in fact, because unlike SVG fonts the use of naked font linking was never part of a W3C standard in the first place.</p>

<p>Clueless statement. Apples and oranges.
We can call it something else if Microsoft and Mozilla would prefer - IE supports a functional equivalent called &ldquo;Vector Markup Language&rdquo; (VML) right now and it&rsquo;s how Cufon generates fonts in IE.
It&rsquo;s been supported in IE for a very long time. I guess they feel the whole idea was a mistake to begin with. The &ldquo;Word Art&rdquo; feature in MS Publisher should be dropped, too, under the same principle.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>David, &lsquo;unnecessary&rsquo; as a web font format in browsers that support WOFF, as is perfectly obvious from both the general context of the discussion and the specific context of the parallel to SVG fonts.</p>
<p>Rich, it&rsquo;s the W3C SVG working group that is considering making SVG fonts optional to support of that standard. It&rsquo;s a decision that reflects two realities: the lack of interest from IE and Mozilla in implementing SVG fonts &ndash; IE&rsquo;s VML is similar, but similar doesn&rsquo;t count in standards compliance, which is the point of the Ars Technica comment &ndash;, and the standardisation of WOFF by the W3C. It&rsquo;s an acknowledgement that SVG fonts are unnecessary to a web fonts environment if there is a W3C web font standard that a) defines a better format (remembering that SVG fonts have no hinting) and b) has an explicit conformance specification that states that <em>all</em> web font formats other than WOFF are optional, which is the case.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>David, it&rsquo;s a simple enough and purely practical point: if a browser supports WOFF, there is no technical need for it to support any other delivery format for web served typography. The W3C sensibly recognised this when they made support for only one web font format necessary for standards conformance: you only need one to make it work. For backwards compatibility with existing browsers, web authors and web font services are going to need to continue to serve multiple formats targeting various browsers. <em>But the browser itself only needs to support one.</em> The browser doesn&rsquo;t gain anything by supporting more than one. Ergo, for any new browser that supports WOFF, any other format, whether it is SVG or naked TTF/OTF or EOT is <em>unnecessary.</em></p>
<p>The differences between these formats are irrelevant to the question of whether any of them is necessary in a browser that already supports WOFF.</p>

<p>Well, there&rsquo;s graphics, and SVG and ttf/otf being served. And that, I believe creates a technical need to support them all. Simple enough from a practical point, that point being, people serve what they serve and you can&rsquo;t change it with browsers, can you&hellip; technically? I&rsquo;m not sure wht practical point you stand at where you see otherwise.</p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>And new browsers will be forced to comply with the public&rsquo;s dirty old serving habits forever (with no path from those servings to WOFF).</p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>Just plain silly John, browsers must have something to gain by supporting beyond the 1 Technically Required format, ttf/otf, or we wouldn&rsquo;t be having a party.</p>
<p>Cheers!</p>

		<div class="commentbody">The fact that all browsers are, to date, picking and choosing which of the non-standard web font formats to support is evidence enough that no browser maker thinks it necessary to suppport whatever format a web publisher happens to serve. You have it entirely backwards, David: web publishers serve the formats that the browsers support, and they target specific formats to specific browsers. If this were not the case, if things were as you say, then Google et al would be supporting EOT; it is after all still the most widely supported web font format in terms of installed browser base. But obviously the fact that people are serving dirty old EOTs in order to target IE6-8 means nothing to Chrome and Firefox and Safari. The browsers don&rsquo;t need to comply with what the public serve, the public needs to comply with what the browsers support. It is in the interests of both the browsers and the public to agree on a <em>standard,</em> so that moving forward the requirements become fewer rather than more numerous and the cross-browser behaviour more predictable.</div>

<p>Lol, obviously, as there are legal reasons they don&rsquo;t and won&rsquo;t and never will support EOT. Is it dead yet?</p>
<p>But, technically (as if I were using that term literally, and not in some goofy context such as yours), the only font format browsers and founders really need to support is ttf/ot. WOFF is a &ldquo;trade&rdquo; that slows things down for browsers, users, and most of all, developers.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s hope that trade is worth it, eh (nod-nod-wink-wink)!? I&rsquo;ll get to that much later.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&hellip;browsers don&rsquo;t need to comply with what the public serve&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Really John, I don&rsquo;t think &ldquo;the public&rdquo; wants to hear this yet, so I have to give you a &ldquo;D&rdquo; in Explanations 101.</p>
<p>Cheers!</p>
