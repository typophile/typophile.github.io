  project - a magazine/newspaper for Israeli and Palestinian youth (ages 9-14) called
  \"Windows\" (Chalonot / Shababik).\r\nWe came up with this logo treatment, and we're
  wondering about the Arabic - is it readable as the Hebrew (which is quite distinguished)?\r\nAlso
  any other comments are welcome.\r\n\r\nThank you!"

    between the two scripts*, but the Arabic itself is plenty legible. The only potential
    problem (which the Hebrew probably has too) is the possible confusion with the
    circles; you might try making them different - maybe make the Arabic ones diamonds.
    A bigger problem however is how the logo will look without color, since you're
    relying on that heavily for legibility.\r\n\r\n* Which probably is only of academic
    interest however.\r\n\r\nBTW:\r\nhttp://typophile.com/node/32423\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
