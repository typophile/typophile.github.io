(If you can find an old one to point me to, I'd be glad to read that too) So here's the question:

What is a better term (if any) for Non-Latin scripts without using 'non' or 'Latin' to qualify them? I typically think of 'other' scripts as 'exotic', but I feel that maybe even that is a bit ethnocentric. Is there a solution to this dilemma?</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Because of the way in which I work, and the way in which Tiro is organised, I'm blessed not to have to worry about such terminology: we do multiscript type design, and Latin is just one of the scripts. The relative importance of one script over another is project-specific, not part of our general outlook. Sometimes, a client needs a typeface in which one script ‘sets the tone’, as it were, for harmonised companions, but we don't have a Latin type department and a Non-Latin type department. It is in the latter situation that I think the term originated. Traditionally, type manufacturers and typesetters alike, in Europe and the Americas, have distinguished between ‘our typography’ and ‘everyone else's typography’, with the latter sometimes referred to as non-Latin and sometimes as exotics.

Hrant, I don't think using the term non-Latin ever stopped anyone from Latinising a ‘non-Latin’ script. Rather, it maintains a status quo in which the identity of other writing systems are expressed relative to Latin.

Paul, I would look at it this way: if you find yourself needing a term with which to refer to ‘everyone else’s typography’ maybe you need to reorganise the way in which you work. When you lose the need for such a term, you can be fairly confident that you are treating the typographic citizens of the world as equals.</div>

‘Other’? Other than what? ‘Exotic’... (‘bizarre’? ‘weird’?). Are you joking? ‘Peculiar’ is another great way to define them non-Latins:<dl><dd>‘As we have divisions of mankind, so we also have similar divisions among letters. In general, type faces take five forms, as follows: Gothic, Roman, Italic, Block and Script.

Of course, when it comes to ‘LGC’ (or ‘GLC’) we are talking scripts, not languages, so the potential problems with ‘ranking’ could only relate to the genetic seniority, which is pretty obvious, not the perceived superiority. From the oldest—the ‘G’—to the youngest, the ‘C’. I don’t see it as an issue.</div>

Why would he be? "Exotic" is a common synonym
for non-Latin. In fact at least one font classification
system uses that (although I forget which it was).

BTW I'm currently working on a commission involving
Cyrillic and Armenian fonts, and the subject line of the
client's emails is "exotic fonts"!

"Peculiar" BTW suffers from being already used in type,
to mean -loosely- non-alphanumeric metal sorts (and by
extension glyphs). Being old-fashioned, I've used it here:
http://www.themicrofoundry.com/manademo/

> Definition by the absence of something is hardly reliable.

Reliability is only one factor, and nothing exists without
its opposite. In my case that "non" does in fact motivate me,
in giving me something to counteract, to refute, to improve.

I don't see what one gains from such an awkward formula. In any case, I would only use the phrase ‘the Latin alphabet’ to refer to the subset of letters used to write the Latin language and their order (as I refer to the English alphabet or the Finnish alphabet, etc.). What we call the Latin script would be better called the Roman script, but ‘Latin script’ is too ingrained in our usage for even me to try to change it.

		<div class="commentbody">I started out doing fonts in the Latin script, although I didn't think of them as such -- I just produced the standard encoding in my neck of the woods, at the time.

When Adobe started bundling fonts with Greek and Cyrillic characters, I decided to give it a try (not the bundling!)
My relationship with the Greek and Cyrillic scripts has become too intimate for me to think of them as "non-" anything, they are Greek and Cyrillic. 

At the ATypI conference in St Petersburg, I realized on numerous occasions that many of the Russians I was speaking with about type knew far less about the "exotica" of Cyrillic than I had recently learned, for instance, its history, and non-Russian Cyrillic characters, such as the Big Yus that Maxim had persuaded me to include in my fonts--one fellow though it was a funny looking Zhe.
Another young designer thought the 19th century form of lower case "p", with its forked extenders, was unusable today: a good understanding for me to have, but I explained to him that an authentic revival shouldn't have anachronisms--so this is the same situation I face in my own script culture, where there is often a tendency to compromise otherness, to make it more acceptable to convention.</div>

Good point. And it's worth pointing out that most non-Latin scripts have less of this baggage than Latin (which can be both good and bad - it depends how you use that).

		<div class="commentbody">Paul, I wonder if the CNN solution might work. They refer to everything as "International" and then label each country by name, the US, France, China, etc. Usually by 'International' CNN means non-American, but it's sufficiently flexible as to not alienate non-American viewers by calling them 'foreigner' in their own countries. It seems to work pretty well.

Incidentally I heard that CNN will fine a newscaster if they use the word 'foreign' instead of 'international'. 

So International Scripts, and then Latin, Greek, Arabic, Chinese, etc. Then if you want to you can label groups positively: European scripts (Latin, Greek, Cyrillic), East Asian (CJK), South Asian, Semitic, etc. Also if you know you are discussing with other native readers of a particular script, I don't see anything wrong with non-latin, non-cyrillic, etc.

I recall that this edict applied to all Turner networks, and for the time that they owned the WCW pro wrestling league, they referred to weapons brought into the ring as "international objects".</div>

Fines, in which currency? Also we need to reduce our dependence on international oil.

I’d also like to see “foreign man acting suspiciously” turn into “international man of mystery” and then get sued by Austin Powers.
