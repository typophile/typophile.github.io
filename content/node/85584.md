  by both Typeshop and Softmaker, i.e. [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/ef-typeshop/nashville/|TS
  Nashville]] (note the design owner is \u2018Quick Brown Fox\u2019) and [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/softmaker/nashville-serial//|Nashville
  Serial]].\r\n\r\nI did some research and read on a thread here the story about [[http://www.typophile.com/node/52651|Sean
  Cavanaugh]]\u2019s SoftMaker. And whilst doing more research I found this on another
  thread \r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\n\u201CTypeshop Collection\u201D, which, as it seems,
  is the former Quick Brown Fox \u201CSerials Typecollection\u201D, which is the former
  Brendel & Pabst \u201CSerial Type Collection\u201D.\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\nSo what's
  the story with TypeShop, are they both reselling old URW typefaces? And if \u2018Serials
  Typecollection\u2019 is from TypeShop, why is SoftMaker using the \u2018Serial\u2019
  suffix? And who are Brendel & Pabst and Typeshop (the description on myfonts didn't
  explain what I would like to know)?\r\n\r\nMany mysteries..."
