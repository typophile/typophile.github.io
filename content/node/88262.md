  body: "This is a sans-serif, and I think it is similar to <a href=\"http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/redrooster/radiant/\">Radiant</a>.
    Your samples are higher contrast than the font I found, but the style is quite
    similar.\r\n\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: "Looks closer to Bureau Empire Bold or Obelysk. I'll dig around, I know there's
    a font similar to Empire with that A.  \r\n\r\nhttp://www.fontbureau.com/fonts/Empire/\r\n\r\nhttp://marketplace.veer.com/type/LST0000304#\r\n\r\nObelysk
    does have the pointy A as an alternative character, but Im not sure if it has
    a bolder weight"
