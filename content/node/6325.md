  body: No, Freehand MX does not support OpenType features, so the only way is to
    open your typeface in a type design program and generate an alternative version
    like you were forced to do with Type1. <BR> <BR>I&#39;m not sure about Unicode
    support, either...

  body: fi and fl ligatures are normally part of the standard 256 character set, that&#39;s
    why you can access them with key commands. That works for all types of font formats,
    as long as the font includes a full character set, that it. <BR> <BR>Other ligatures
    are not typically found in the standard character set, which is what makes unicode
    and opentype so appealing for the user. <BR> <BR>Many larger, older font families
    had alternate, or expert fonts that you could buy extra&#40;like Adobe Minion,
    for instance&#41;. This special font had 30 characters or so, many of which were
    cool ligatures. OpenType allows these to built into standard, single fonts.
