  body: franz I agree. How does that s work with the squared off elements in the other
    characters? On news the n seems to have a spur serif on thee top right. This smells
    of logo design and not a typeface. Is that what you were alluding to franz

  body: Yeah, pretty much. Eurostile-ish e, Helvetica-ish s, Din-ish w, etc.. Whatever
    it turns out to be, it doesn&#39;t work so great.
