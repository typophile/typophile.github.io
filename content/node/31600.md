  body: <a href=http://www.pizzadude.dk/home.php>Pizzadude.dk</a> is willfully freeform,
    but it is in Indie Fonts 3, so maybe it's not out there enough for you. As the
    creator, Jakob Fischer, says on the About page, "Don't expect me do re-do Times
    New Roman or Futura!" That's a far cry from a lot of type designers, who are always
    looking to create book types.

  body: it's not a foundry, but lots of experimental and fun things have happened
    for rick valicenti's playground project. most of it isn't downloadable anymore
    (it was all limited) but i'm sure you could contact the designers if you're interested
    in playing with anything.  (http://playplayplayplay.com/)
