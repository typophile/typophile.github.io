  body: 'This cannot be answered in a short forum thread. There are some many variables.
    You may be able to find a purely technical checklist, but then again this list
    may not be applicable to all cases. Sometimes even discarding the technical standards
    may be the best and only reasonable choice. You have to consider the medium and
    the task at hand: a typeface suitable for H Melville''s <em>Moby Dick</em> won''t
    necessarily be a "good" choice for a newspaper headline or a website. And, you
    cannot forget that the stylistic trends change all the time. So, what makes a
    "good" or "bad" typeface? The answer is: "it depends".'

  body: "<em>What makes a bad typeface?\r\nWhat makes a good typeface?</em>\r\n\r\nThat
    is not a very productive question.\r\nIt will lead into semantics, which is not
    really what you should be learning about typefaces.\r\nI suggest you qualify it
    with respect to a design piece you have produced, discussing why you chose the
    typeface you went with, as opposed to others, and what perceived qualities you
    exploited in it, and its strengths and weaknesses you discovered in experimenting
    with it. And/or do the same with the work of another designer\u2014either a peer,
    or a practising professional.\r\n\r\nDesign is practical and experimental, not
    academic and theoretical.\r\nNonetheless, in an academic context, practical work
    may be analyzed to reveal important principles.\r\n"

  body: "A story:\r\n\r\nMany years ago, in a galaxy far away called New York City,
    I took a course in sound recording through the New School.\r\nWe met at a small
    recording studio in the Village that did a lot of jazz recording.\r\n\r\nThe engineer
    there said this: \"There's no such thing as a 'bad' microphone. Just a microphone
    that you haven't found a good use for yet. Each has it's strengths and weaknesses
    and it's just a question of what sound quality you want.\"\r\n\r\nWith that, he
    turned and opened up a big cabinet filled with microphones - some of them dating
    back a lot of years. He <em>never</em> threw out a working microphone.\r\n\r\nSame
    with fonts, IMHO.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/richard.fink\">Richard

  body: "Bad in what way?\r\n\r\nI recently used a (free) typeface which had received
    quite a few favorable comments here on Typophile,. It worked well aesthetically
    for the intended purpose, but, being curious and able to do so I took a look at
    in FontLab, where I found that the way it had been drawn was simply appalling.
    Nodes on top of nodes, radii that resemble rough-cut circular saw blades and worse.
    \r\n\r\nThat's one way of being bad. \r\n\r\nFor me, that's the only real way
    a typeface can be bad, aside from one for which the designer makes ridiculous,
    unreasonable and unsupportable \"scientific\" claims of superior performance in
    some way similar to Tiresias, that dyslexia font, or that \"eco\" one that saves
    ink. And, in the end, my objections to those fonts is moral and not aesthetic.
    \ :o)\r\n\r\nParaphrasing Richard, <cite>There's no such thing as a 'bad' font.
    Just a font that you haven't found a good use for yet..</cite>. \r\n\r\n\r\nR\r\n"

    \r\n\r\n(And one probably could write a book about why there is a range of appropriate
    contexts for some typefaces, while others seem to have no appropriate context
    at all ;) !)\r\n\r\nOr\r\n\r\nA bad typeface is one that is rated bad by the consumers:

    in, asks question and gets an edumacation.\r\n\r\nLike most here I\u2019d guess,
    there are faces that I find monkey-butt ugly and that is one way of defining bad,
    but obviously that\u2019s largely an aesthetic response, ergo an opinion and someone
    could be found who\u2019d disagree (q.v. discussions on the overuse of Helvetica).
    \r\n\r\nA face that is poorly done technically as Russell mentions, that\u2019s
    one good definition of bad in this context and one of the only ways a typeface
    can be objectively bad; the other main one I can think of is the most obvious
    perhaps - poor legibility. Obviously some designers would not agree but IMB type
    has one main job to do and if it doesn\u2019t do that well what purpose does it
    serve?"

    Obviously it is to communicate. But winks and scowls can communicate more than
    words sometimes. If you're working on a design that calls for a grungy looking
    font, then that grungy look is communication."
