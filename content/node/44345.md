body: "I need to figure out color. I don't know whether I want white text. If I use
  white text, I'll need a hot pink rather than lighter pink shirt, so the red diamonds
  and hearts may not show up well. I also won't be able to print at Skreened. I'm
  probably sticking with gray type, light pink shirt and printing at Skreened, but
  I don't know which gray to use.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/20080415-chinchillas_kittens-colored-normalt_4665.png]\r\nI
  don't really want to use animals with the letter \"t\" because I don't like the
  lowercase t in the main font I'm using ([[http://www.1001fonts.com/font_details.html?font_id=2674|Catholic
  School Girls]]). I've never designed type at all, but I tried making a ligature,
  and it came out terribly.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/20080415-chinchillas_kittens-colored-ligt_6412.png]\r\nActually,
  that font isn't quite what I want exactly anyway. Maybe I'll try [[http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/shinntype/handsome_pro_ot/|Handsome
  Pro]].\r\n\r\nDesigning this is quite fun though."
