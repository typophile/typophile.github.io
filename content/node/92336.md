  pretty sure the sans face is Futura bold condensed, though the lower case \"a\"
  troubles me a bit. Although the Sun Times masthead resembles a number of faces I
  can't find an exact match.\r\n\r\nThanks for your help."

  body: Great article, thanks. However, the example in the image is from 1970 according
    to the writer, pre-dating the redesign. Still trying to identify the typeface.
