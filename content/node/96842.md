body: "<strong>Sometimes a surprise, sometimes as expected \u2013 MeM is an interactive
  type system with a wide range of individual personalities.</strong>\r\n\r\nThe eccentric
  experimental type system created by Elena Sch\xE4del and Jakob Runge in 2012. It
  produces many personalities, each individual and emotive. You will never know which
  of the alternating letters is going to occur next. Basically, at the heart of it
  all is MeM: four different weights and letter shapes melded together into one powerful
  font and shuffled with the sleek usability of OpenType.\r\n\r\n<iframe src=\"http://player.vimeo.com/video/49599252?title=0&amp;byline=0&amp;portrait=0&amp;color=db0909\"
  width=\"610\" height=\"328\" frameborder=\"0\" webkitAllowFullScreen mozallowfullscreen
  allowFullScreen></iframe>\r\n\r\nThe experimental uppercase font MeM blurs the boundaries
  between graphic and type design and prioritises style and creative flair over blatant
  legibility.\r\nThe many alternative letters of the typeface and the extremely different
  styles of the individual glyphs generate a vivid tension of geometric appearance
  and calligraphic shapes, as well as a contrasting mixture of highly expressive and
  highly delicate elements - Each letter is a small work of art itself.\r\nIt might
  look like an unique handset type but it is actually a rationalized font system!
  An automatic shuffle principle rotates the four alternate letters in all common
  design software to make sure no letter will repeat too soon. OpenType is the kicker,
  it not only shuffles the letters; it makes them easy to handle via the Stylistic
  Alternates: bolder and lighter letters can be used separately, or you can even strip
  down MeM to the four single weights. This gives you a powerful command over the
  artistic qualities of this unique font. From a complete random shuffle to careful
  selection of every character, the choice is all yours.\r\n\r\nThe font supports
  over 300 characters. Latin character sets from Western, Central and Southeast Europe
  and with the additional alternates, around 630 glyphs are rotating in the OpenType
  carousel.\r\n\r\nThe font is available at  [[http://www.youworkforthem.com/product.php?sku=T3676&affId=136315|YouWorkForThem]],

  information about design and features on [[http://mem.26plus-zeichen.de/|www.mem.26plus
  zeichen.de]]\r\n\r\nThe concept of MeM emerged at the end of 2011. At this time
  Elena Sch\xE4del was researching the subject of social trends. She experimented
  with capturing the essence of a particular trend through the language of lettershapes.
  One of these trends is the \u201Cselfness\u201D movement, which is expressed through
  extremely different, sometimes even spontaneous characters.\r\nThe development of
  these expressive vector graphics into a complete font may be questionable, however,
  the visual power of the letters and the wealth of character variants was an exciting
  incentive for Jakob Runge to embark on a daring type-collaboration: The planning
  of an experimental font with programmed random mechanism.\r\nDuring the transfer
  of the design idea into a functional font and the attempt to achieve it through
  programming a natural variance, it was imperative that the artistic style of Elena
  Sch\xE4del should stay - just with a few necessary augmentations.\r\nThe different
  disciplines of the two designers was a good foundation for the creative and technical
  implementation: Despite the experimental design, it took many hours Skype conferencing
  to select variants, adjust shapes, add symbols, and space the letters.\r\n"

    - this looks like it took some incredible amount of time and effort. Fascinating.

    I wonder if it is a good idea to use Ligature and Swash in such an inaccurate
    manner. The Contextual Alternates feature could have been employed instead of
    Ligature (and is also on by default).\r\n\r\nIf we don\u2019t respect the <a href=\"http://www.microsoft.com/typography/otspec/features_ae.htm\">Microsoft
    OpenType Feature Tags</a>, there is a danger that typographers will become confused.
    If we do implement them strictly, there is more likelihood of developing a mutually
    supportive culture of clever new typefaces.\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: "The principle of \u201Cnot telling lies\u201D with OpenType was drummed into
    me by Thomas Phinney and John Hudson, on this forum, several years ago.\r\n\r\nDon\u2019t
    you think it\u2019s misleading to use OpenType features to do things which aren\u2019t
    what they say they are?\r\n\r\nThe Ligature and Swash features, when applied in
    MeM, do not produce Ligatures or Swashes.\r\n\r\nWhat is the point of having Feature
    Tag de\uFB01nitions if font producers ignore them?\r\n\r\nI thought you were in
    favor of standards.\r\n\r\nI must admit, I do feel reticent about criticizing
    work in the Release forum, but hey, it\u2019s software, and can be updated easily
    if the designer feels my criticism has merit. I am also open to any rationale
    Jakob might offer to convince me that I am wrong.\r\n\r\nThis is an area of type
    design I\u2019m eager to discuss, having published several designs with pseudo-random
    features, and written about it as well: http://ilovetypography.com/2011/04/01/engaging-contextuality/\r\n\r\nAs
    you can see, I promoted myself in that article (people usually do, especially
    when they don\u2019t get paid for writing), but I also talked up a lot of other
    designers, and will no doubt do the same for MeM in future because, as I said,
    it\u2019s exciting to see creative uses of OpenType features.\r\n\r\n"

  body: "hej nick, \r\n\r\nthanks for brining up statements for the original usage
    of OpenType features.\r\n\r\nyour are right: the feature CALT is default as well
    \u2014 we decided to (mis)use the LIGA feature, which is supported by a slightly
    more version of Adobe CS, but its prevalence is neglectable to the CALT feature
    and Photoshop versions no one uses anymore. we could have spend more time on sticking
    to standards.\r\n\r\nConcerning to \"Swash\" and \"Titling Alternates\": we used
    this features as kind of workaround to make some features available in Photoshop
    as well (which does not provide \"stylistic sets\") \u2014 knowing that the <em>bolder</em>
    weights do not have northing in common with the common understanding of <em>swashes</em>.
    \r\nWe did made some good results with this workaround with [[http://www.26plus-zeichen.de/en/fonts/tj-evolette-a/|TJ
    Evolette A]], because the typeface is used by unusual much Photoshop users (may
    result to the typeface's <em>figurative</em> appearance)\r\n\r\n"

    something I will be doing in future, as I\u2019ve often thought that so many typographers
    don\u2019t ever bother diving down several levels of application menu to get to
    the features\u2014and Stylistic Sets are most obscure of all.\r\n\r\nFor instance,
    I have provided \u201Cschoolbook\u201D variants (single-storey /a and /g) as Stylistic
    Set alternates in several fonts, but I never see them in use.\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Nick, I gave a presentation to a group of (mostly) print designers recently
    about OpenType. Most were unfamiliar with the possibilities OpenType offers and
    of Stylistic Sets in particular. The clumsiness and non-visual nature of their
    implementation in Creative Suite products doesn't help matters.\r\n\r\nNot sure
    how I feel about separate fonts for alternate characters. I hated having to manage
    LF/OSF/Expert versions back in the day. But I suppose specifying a different font
    (via character/paragraph styles) to get at a particular alternate wouldn't be
    any more difficult than using Stylistic Sets for the same purpose."
