body: "I've seen fonts that were small caps due to the font's complexity. I've also
  noticed that other fonts with a standard lower case are sometimes release in a small
  caps versions. Are there any guidelines for creating a small caps version of a font.
  Are small caps version used, or are they redundant? Who thinks the question itself
  is redundant.  \r\n\r\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~\r\n\r\n[[http://www.thefontry.com|<em>...from

  body: It's arguable that small caps are even more useful in display settings, since
    the lack of descenders can make for a more compact line.

  body: "I use small caps when I design metal plaques.  My recent favorite for this
    is Jos Buivenga's Fontin.  I use it where mixed case might be used (especially
    lists of names) but upper case is more formal.  The larger first letter aids legibility.
    \ It is very satisfying to see my designs cast in bronze (and other metals, too).\r\n\r\n[[http://www.albanysigns.com/pictures/plaque_5.jpg|bronze

  body: Depending on how "showy" it is. If it's an ultralight Didone that would never
    be used for text, I'd say for sure. If it's Curlz, I'd say, What's the point?
