  body: "I think I agree with Patrick, because the e's seem different to me, and not
    only in size. The closest font I found to this is [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/sudtipos/cenizas/|Cenizas]]
    from Sudtipos.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: "Mike, I assume that\u2019s because you use the square brackets syntax, while
    Stephen seems to type regular HTML code.\r\nBoth approaches are valid and should
    result in regular (i.e. blue) links, like it used to be. The problem occurs since
    the recent overhaul, see my <a href=\"http://typophile.com/node/66119#comment-388634\">bug
    report</a>."
