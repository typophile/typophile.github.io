body: "Hey Everyone,\r\n\r\nI'm stumped. Does anyone here know how to detect reversed
  postscript hints using Python in FontLab? \r\n\r\nHere's what I tried:\r\n<code>\r\nfont
  = fl.font \r\nglyphs = font.glyphs</code>\r\n<code>\r\nfor index in range(len(fl.font)):\r\n\tglyph
  = fl.font[index]\r\n\tvhw = glyph.vhints.width\r\n\tif len(vhw) < 0:\r\n\t\tprint
  glyph.name, vhw\r\n</code>\r\n\r\nI find there are two things wrong here (but I
  don't know how to fix them).\r\n1. FL py reports width as not being an attribute
  of hhints\r\n2. <code>len(vhw) < 0</code> returns nothing even when I know those
  instances are present \r\n\r\nAny help is appreciated."

    it gives me an error that vhints is not an attribute of glyph (?).\r\n\r\nD\r\n\r\n"
