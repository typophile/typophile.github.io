  body: "Took some classes on diw\u0101ni in Cairo, it's a bit more swash than what
    he does there. It's the kind of hand you can use to make figurative illustrations
    or just really fancy shapes. I didn't get that far, though.\r\n\r\nIn western
    calligrahy you can get by with a sheet of paper showing a-z, A-Z, 1-0 and some
    basic punctuation -- in arabic, some of the letters could demand one such sheet
    just to cover all the necessary combinations."

  body: I don't have any knowledge of this calligraphy at all really, but it got me
    interested. I thought the tool he was using was great. I was surprised that it
    was not a brush and that it moved very slowly. Was this his personal approach?

  body: "It's the traditional tool, a pen made from dried reed: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qalam
    -- I learned using a metal nib, like in european calligraphy, only slanting the
    other way.\r\n\r\nI'm pretty sure there are no traditional hands in arabic calligraphy
    that use a brush. There's some very cool modern stuff though. Check out the work
    of Samir Malik or Nihad Dukhan, for example.\r\n\r\nSome calligraphers work very
    very slowly, some work very fast and use up a lot of paper before they get the
    strokes just right -- Denis Brown is a (european) example of a calligrapher of
    the latter kind, and you should check his work out as well :)\r\n\r\nI think it's
    usually an ideal in european calligraphy that the work should look swish and spontaneous,
    not sure if that's as often the case with arabic calligraphy. Just look at the
    Kufic scripts, for example."

  body: "Most of the Perso-Arabic calligraphers I have seen working write very slowly.
    This is in part because they spend more time pushing the pen than Latin script
    calligraphers, and this requires a lot of control.\r\n\r\nNote also in the video
    how he had rotated the page and is actually writing vertically. This is very common."

  body: "Pushing the pen as opposed to dragging it? Does that mean it staggers (lurches)
    more?\r\n\r\nFascinating for me, shame The Guardian videos expire so quickly."
