body: I found these plastic letters at an antique store and scanned and screenprinted
  them. The font is very familiar, yet hard for me to ID.  Would love tho get the
  whole alphabet (they were missing many at the store)[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Marquis-font_6000.gif]

  body: These are all close, thank you.  I guess I was wondering if it had a metal
    typeface origin or not. It looks more refined than any of these digital versions.  Even
    the Fantablock Beveled is not quite as nice I think.  The R is more balanced looking
    to me.

    'C' looks right, and a set of 50 is $55.  I may just go this route.  Still doesn't
    answer the question of what face it is exactly...but i suppose I'll ask."
