  body: EFN Kameleon  <BR>&#40;c&#41; Eurofont 1998  <BR> <BR>looks the same, except
    the B is totally different.  <BR> <BR>Kameleon is propably a copy if something
    else...&#40;?&#41; <BR>I have no idea why this font is on my computer, I have
    propably downloaded it from some &#34;free&#34; font site. Could not find any
    registering information from their site http://www.multifonts.com/ regarding this
    font...hmm? <BR> <BR>
