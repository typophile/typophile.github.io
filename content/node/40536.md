  body: '"Drive your Dream" and "www.ferrariofseattle.com" are in real Helvetica Condensed.
    I''d bet that in previous ads, the listings were too. Then someone had to update
    the ad without the source file, and they had to set and paste in new listings
    that were supposed to "look the same" while not having the condensed font and/or
    being ignorant of the difference. There''s also a good likelihood that it was
    scaled vertically to fill the space.'

    actually working with car ads at my part time job, and I refuse to distort type
    (and I even fix other people's mess, like adding en dashes to phone numbers...)
    anyway, I'm asking the same question as Dan, why distort type? I don't get it.
    There's a family of Univers, Frugiter, and even Helvetica in various weights and
    sizes, and yet instead of tracking, they have to distort. I don't understand it
    either."

    underpaid designers. this is what you get with a skimpy budget.
