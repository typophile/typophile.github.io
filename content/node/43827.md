  computers and the vague TrueType names in my old Font folder are too daunting to
  check each one. \r\n\r\n\"What the Font\" and \"Identifont\" were kind of dead ends
  because the lower-case letters are actually still capital, just smaller. I hope
  you fine people can crack the case. \r\n\r\nBesides the attached, more examples
  can be found here:\r\nhttp://honeybeemanor.com/ocontent.gif\r\nhttp://honeybeemanor.com/ocam.gif\r\n\r\nThese
  next two are mixed case.\r\nhttp://honeybeemanor.com/olinks.gif\r\nLinkFest\r\n\r\nhttp://honeybeemanor.com/foxbanner.gif\r\nHoneyBeeManor\r\n\r\nThanks
  a ton in advance!"
