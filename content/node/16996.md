body: "So here's a question I've been mulling over -- not exclusively related to type,
  but I think it relates, because I think there's creativity/artistry involved in
  type design and typography. Just looking for other perspectives on this.\r\n\r\nI'm
  a writer more than an editor. I find it extremely difficult to write poetry when
  I've been around others. I require a lot of solitary time to get my head and creative
  gears tuned to language, and if I'm not alone for long enough stretches, it just
  ain't gonna happen. Being busy doesn't interfere, as long as I'm alone.\r\n\r\nWhat's
  your take? Do you feel your creative work requires solitude? If so, what do you
  do to make sure you get it?\r\n\r\nKristina"

  body: "I don't need solitude in order to design type -- or write, for that matter
    --, but I think other people may want to keep their distance some of the time.
    When I get myself into the middle of a design problem, I'm liable to get irritable
    and cranky until I've found my way back out again. If I have to leave off work
    on something part way through, I'll be distracted and ill at ease until I can
    get back to it. But on the other hand I'm happy working away in the middle of
    a noisy airport terminal, and don't mind having other people around.\r\n\r\nIt
    is a long time since I have written any poetry, but I suspect this would benefit
    more from solitude than type design or, for that matter, other forms of writing."

      -- John, this is too true.\r\n\r\nIndeed, I also have to agree with Kristina
      that being in a busy place -- caf\xE9s, parks -- often stimulates the creative
      juices. I went on a week long canoe trip and packed a journal with the thought
      that all that open space would provide lots of inspiration, but in fact, I didn't
      even unpack the journal or my pen the whole trip. For me, spending time away
      from it all usually prompts me to do nothing at all, but sit and enjoy.\r\n\r\n(Though
      extended breaks have their own benefits.)"

  body: The way I work is to work on the project for a while with all its distractions,
    but then take a break and a long walk with my field glasses and bird watch. What
    this does for me is it allows me to work on the project in the back of my mind.
    I find I get good results this way.

    land on my hand to get a peanut. The best thing was when a downy woodpecker landed
    on my hand and stayed for a while. She couldn't manage a peanut or even a half
    and she was frustrated. I will have to break up peanut halfs to at least quarters
    to feed the downy woodpeckers. Its all part of the creative process.

    a weekend in a silent retreat monastery. I spent more of the weekend reading than
    working as intended on the writing. Hadn't thought of reading being un-silent,
    but of course it is a dialogue of sorts.\r\n\r\nJust last week I had 4 days straight
    without my kids, or anyone, around.  I cleaned, re-did the kids' room, started
    and finished a novel, and only managed to start writing in the evening of day
    3. Day 4 I was going batty, and mostly moped. There goes my solitude theory. Perhaps
    balance is the key. Outside stimulation to trigger ideas and the time and space
    to think them through. (Hey, wait a minute. Virgina Woolf already covered some
    of that... and the money to be able to do it...)  ;)\r\n\r\nSilas -- Yeah, beware
    the slobberingly drunk poetry. If you can decipher your writing the next morning,
    you have no idea why it seemed important. \r\n\r\nEngelhardt -- I'd be a horrible
    self-employed work-from-home person. Something about fluorescent lighting, and
    padded cubicle walls that makes me productive. Not to mention the exercise I get

    neither, and most importantly something else entirely. Poetry is linked to song,
    and hence to music, and like music and song it seeks direct emotional and epiphanic
    connection. What happens at the point of connection varies, but very often it
    involves a shared insight that is arrived at by the reader rather than, as in
    expository prose, explained to him. This could be considered a kind of communication,
    but it is a whole lot more powerful than most of our nattering to each other.\r\n\r\nFunnily,
    I've known a number of fine prose writers who wish they could do what poets do,
    and a number of good poets who wish they could do what composers do. I'm not sure
    who composers envy. Maybe angels."

    If you're not writing from the idea that someone else will read it -- an audience
    of some kind -- you're basically only \"journalling\". Yes, I write from the need
    to express, but the drive to connect with others is essential. (Thus my, and every

    languages were forced on me - the only dedication I needed for those was the desparate
    need -or maybe even just the automatic decision- to stay in school! Spanish is
    the only language I learned willingly. As for reading scripts without knowing
    the language, that's just plain fun.\r\n\r\nPaul, Indian musicals are nothing
    short of amazing - the energy and quality\r\nis just... wow. And this from somebody
    like me who normally hates musicals.\r\n\r\nBTW, the problems with sounding native
    are that: it's extremely hard, and even requires some innate talent - I certainly
    can't manage it with French... or maybe even English; and it's all about listening,
    not reading, so you can't learn it from a book. TV is actually good that way,
    so rent French movies like Kristina does... but turn off the subtitles, at least
    the first time you watch a given movie - you don't need the content to distract
    you (and reading takes up too much bandwidth to do both well - I think there was
    even a study that showed you can't really do both at the same time). Learning
    language is incorrectly considered by most people as requiring formalism - to
    me it's quite the opposite - it's about letting your brain figure things out on
    its own, otherwise you'll never really get it. Formal instruction of language
    could possibly even harm true learning I think.\r\n\r\n> have the TV on without
