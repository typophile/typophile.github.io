    in digital form. On that I may be mistaken but I did not find it. There are plenty
    of printed examples of it out there though.\r\n\r\nGood luck!\r\n\r\nMichael"

  body: "<cite>I do not think Carolus is available in digital form. </cite>\r\n\r\nYes,
    it is \u2013 as <a href=\"http://www.dafont.com/carolus-roman.font\">Carolus-Roman</a>
    and as <a href=\"http://www.abstractfonts.com/font/5215\">Carleton</a>. However,
    those digitizations don\u2019t exactly look inviting.\r\n\r\nFor a decent alternative,
    have a look at <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/singles/itc/itc_tiepolo_std_book/\">ITC
    Tiepolo</a> or <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/search/?q=alcuin\">Alcuin</a>."

    of the subtle qualities Forsberg designed into them. He was an incredible lettering
    artist/type designer and would have never signed off on those. I was fortunate
    to teach in Sweden and beheld his work all over the place. What an artist!\r\n\r\nMisa,
    Michaelangelo, by Hermann Zapf, might be a nice alternative.\r\n\r\nMichael"

    1992) on my computer. I really appreciate it!
