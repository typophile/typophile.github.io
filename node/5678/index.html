		<div class="commentbody">Steve, I like tabbed browsing because I can group my browsing in a subject-oriented manner, rather than in an unsorted mess. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->If someone on typophile links something, I can open it in a tab attached to the originating window, then Cmnd+Tab over to my email window which might have a tab for Hotmail and/or Gmail along with tabs for any links I got in emails. It's nice for research too, since I can run 4 Google searches in 4 windows and open links related to each in tabs under that originating Google search. I find IE to be laborious in contrast. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->This hits on a fundamental difference in the 2 big OSes (mac and windows) as well: logical/hierarchical segmentation. While tabbed browsing is possible in both OSes, in Windows every <!-- raw HTML omitted -->document<!-- raw HTML omitted --> gets its own Taskbar item (except in apps like Photoshop), but in Mac OS every <!-- raw HTML omitted -->app<!-- raw HTML omitted --> gets its own Dock item, then you can move between documents in the app you choose. There are benefits to both, but I prefer the Mac method of hierarchical segmentation (this isn't an official term, I'm just using it for convenience). Also, OS X allows document windows from different apps to intermingle, so you can pull your Illustrator work to Photoshop without having to move every window out of the way, so it's not too strict about the segmenting (OS 9 does not have this ability). <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I'm not a PC-hater, and I don't use every single widget and feature of my browsers, but even for me IE is behind the curve in a few siginificant ways. And, if I understand correctly, MS is ditching IE anyway (probably so they can just integrate browsing directly into the OS).</div>

My point which I may not have made clear is that those are simply browser stats. They say nothing about the preferences of an actual user. I use IE day-in, day-out at work. I hate it. But I have to use it. So, when I visit sites, I'm logged as an 'IE/PC' user, when, in fact, I'm much more of a 'Firefox/Mac' user.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->There isn't a lot of statistics based on this. I did a bit of research once and found a few folks that had access to large national web sites and were able to break down stats by time of day.

Did I say browsers had no bugs? Like I said, design to standards, fix the layout bugs in IE. Are there other bugs? Sure&hellip;but nothing major that will affect your site 99% of the time. If you have examples of this big Mozilla bugs that are a hindrance, please share them. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&quot;1. What's a major browser? &quot; <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Windows: IE 5+, latest Opera, Latest Mozilla(S), NN4 (I still check that one).  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->OSX: Latest Safari, Latest Mozilla(s), Latest Opera, Latest Omniweb <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->OS9: IE5 (blech) <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Linux: Konquerer <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Other: A text browser, JAWS, etc. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&quot;2. Five minutes. What kind of web site is that? &quot; <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Pretty much any. It takes me less than 5 minutes to run my page through all of the above browsers. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Again, if you're designing to standards, it's even less of a deal. When you do that, the only odd-ones out are IE/PC, IE/Mac and NN4&hellip;which there are plenty of well documented workarounds for their quirks. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I'm not trying to bash you Steve&hellip;I'm just trying to dispell the common myth that you (and many many others) perpetuate. This is part of the problem why you have to keep IE on your computer. Microsoft has developed a nice little catch-22 with their browser. Everyone uses because there are so many sites only developed with IE in mind. There are so many sites only developed with IE in mind because so many developers assume everyone uses IE on windows. This has pretty much enabled MS to not have to worry about fixing a badly broken and rather insecure browser.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Hrant, the idea with the Thunderbird/Firefox stuff (both parts of the SeaMonkey project) is that it's essentially a kind of modularised Mozilla, so you're not downloading and using one monolithic do-it-all application, but lightweight, fast programs that do one thing well. So Thunderbird doesn't as such 'come with' Firefox, but it's the mailreading arm of the SeaMonkey project. There are other side-projects, all being developed by community, such as the Sunbird calendar, which can also integrate with Thunderbird (although the last time I tried it it was still awful buggy). <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->And yeah, I can testify that the spam filtering in Thunderbird is great. From about ten a day I now get about one a month slipping through, and no false positives so far. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Steve &ndash; if you have the time (maybe a spare five minutes) you could report your non-working sites  on the Firefox <!-- raw HTML omitted -->forums<!-- raw HTML omitted -->? It's easier than filing a full bug report (for which you need to be using the latest nightly build etc.) and the developers do seem to read the forums.
