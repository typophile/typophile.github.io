<p>What does this mean for typography on the web? (Heck, what would this mean for typophile.com?)</p>
<p>How about motion graphics on the web? Or is this a VCR / Betamax situation—answerable simply by asking which does the porn industry support? There&rsquo;s an excerpt (the &ldquo;they&rdquo; refers to Adobe):</p>
<p>&ldquo;They are lazy, Jobs says. They have all this potential to do interesting things but they just refuse to do it. They don’t do anything with the approaches that Apple is taking, like Carbon. Apple does not support Flash because it is so buggy, he says. Whenever a Mac crashes more often than not it’s because of Flash.</p>
<p>No one will be using Flash, he says. The world is moving to HTML5.&rdquo;</p>

People don&rsquo;t write for Carbon for the same reason most viruses are for Windows: installed base! And that&rsquo;s also the reason Jobs can&rsquo;t kill anything as huge as Flash (although apparently he <!-- raw HTML omitted -->can<!-- raw HTML omitted --> kill good typography). If HTML5 does end up killing Flash, Jobs cannot take any of the credit.</p>
<p>And the crashing business is pure hogwash. No proper operating system can leave itself at the mercy of a browser plug-in!</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I think Steve actually has to sell a significant number of devices before Adobe has to worry about him killing Flash. Even if every Mac user buys an iPhone/iPad tomorrow Apple’s Flashless devices will still have a smaller user base than Opera or Chrome, neither of which is relevant commercially. And the iPad could very well be the next Apple TV, which, like the iPad, was great, awesome, amazing, and totally going to destroy a bunch of stuff, and has turned out to be little more than a hacking platform for basement dwellers who lack the social skills required to play WoW.</p>
<p>But I do think that all this speculation is a sign that Flash is on its way out. A few years ago Flash/Flex seemed to have a brilliant future ahead and now we’re all salivating at the thought of a web with no Flash at all. If this is an omen of how we can expect feelings about Flash to trend it seems like the Adobe/Macromedia buyout will be right up there with AOL buying Time Warner in the history of corporate takovers gone horribly wrong.</p>

<p>Steve Jobs and Apple will have little or nothing to do with the acceptance of HTML5 nor the killing of Flash on the web. Like any web standard, it takes years for adoption rates to catch up. IE6 was <em>just</em> bumped by IE8 in most-used browser in the world. HTML5 does not work in IE6, but it does play Flash. If a web browser nearly a decade old is still being used by this many people, it&rsquo;s going to take a very long time for HTML5 to completely replace Flash as a go-to source for video on the web. Flash is still a great platform for online games, as well, something you won&rsquo;t see replaced by HTML5 anytime soon. So while the battle lines may have been drawn by the outspoken Apple leader, it represents very little more than the frustrations of one man lashing out at a company he wishes would develop software that worked better on his OS. That gripe, of course, is a two way street.</p>
<p>HTML5 is here, it&rsquo;s great, and it simplifies a lot of things. But it&rsquo;s going to have to share the spotlight with Flash at best, and that&rsquo;s not going to change anytime soon.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Flash has been wallowing in the hands of Adobe for some time. They bought it hoping it was a magic pill but didn&rsquo;t do a whole lot with it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not dead, for sure, but HTML5, Canvas, jQuery and other solid JS libraries combined have all been gaining quite a bit of momentum as a solid replacement for a lot of what Flash currently does for us on the web.</p>
<p>Steve Jobs has merely lent a LOT MORE momentum to the cause.</p>
<p>&ldquo;People don&rsquo;t write for Carbon for the same reason most viruses are for Windows: installed base!&rdquo;</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s incorrect and I&rsquo;m not sure what that has to do with Flash.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And that&rsquo;s also the reason Jobs can&rsquo;t kill anything as huge as Flash&rdquo;</p>
<p>Not alone, of course. But there are plenty of folks more than happy to let Flash go by the wayside for a lot of things.</p>
<p>And the future of the commercial web is mobile. And mobile = iPhone, so people are definitely factoring this into the equation.</p>
<p>As for what it means for web typography? Not much. If anything, it just leaves more room open for @font-face support.</p>

<p>Chrome is based on webkit, as is Safari on the iPhone. It&rsquo;s also owned by Google. Google is more than happy to go they way of HTML5 (they&rsquo;re already rolling it out on YouTube as an alternative to Flash).</p>
<p>And, with 60 million+ iphones/iTouches out there, it&rsquo;s not necessarily a number to sneeze at.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Like any web standard, it takes years for adoption rates to catch up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Usually true. No so much with HTML5 though. I&rsquo;m rather amazed at how fast it&rsquo;s picking up speed&hellip;even as it&rsquo;s not a final standard yet.</p>
<p>I agree, however, that it&rsquo;s not a replacement for Flash. However, it will replace a lot of what Flash takes care of us for on the web. Flash will still be there for gaming, and, if Adobe is smart, Flash as an IDE will stick around and perhaps output HTML5/CSS/Canvas markup for us.</p>

<p>What Adobe hasn&rsquo;t done is rewrite Photoshop and the rest of their Creative Suite in Cocoa, which they&rsquo;ll need to do to make their apps 64-bit and for other technical advantages.</p>
<p>As for Flash, I&rsquo;d say the sooner it&rsquo;s forgotten, the better. What a blight. I suppose it can linger for games, but using it as a video player or, let&rsquo;s say, for inline font rendering is like using a flame thrower to light a cigarette.</p>

I wonder only what will be the future possibilities of using the very typeface I want in Internet not depending on what the user has installed on his system. For me, personally, that’s what it’s all about.
Because I definitely refuse to go on designing websites that show mostly Arial, Times, Georgia and so on.
Why are the no moves in this direction? To be able to set texts in whatever typeface (I mean that ones I have legaly acquired) I like without making a JPG of it or using Flash.</p>

<p>The interesting thing to me about this discussion is that Adobe font technology was good enough for Next, and a render-alike version was good enough for &ldquo;Quartz Type&rdquo; on the Mac. Yet when Apple put a lot of effort, they were not lazy, into developing TT, (font technology less lazy than Adobe&rsquo;s), where&rsquo;d ya put it Steve?</p>

Why are there no moves in this direction? <!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>There&rsquo;s plenty of moves in this direction. IE, Firefox, Safari, and Chrome all have reasonably functional implementations of @font-face. Opera, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->less so<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, but at least it seems to be on their minds. As it should.
Firefox 3.6 was just released with support for the compressed font-wrapper format WOFF. Plus a major bug regarding synthesized bolding was fixed. Looks pretty solid now.
Much more is known now as to how a cross-browser implementation needs to be handled in the CSS.
There are tools and test pages and how-to information on the way that will make it easier for web developers to compress fonts, subset fonts, and view fonts in the browser.
There are JavaScript techniques being developed to smooth out the differences between implementations.</p>
<p>I, too, am sick to death of looking at Georgia, Arial, and Verdana.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s plenty going on.</p>

<p>Please be citing actual facts and figures to back up your counter-claim rather than silly Fox News-esque punditry language.</p>
<p>While I have much respect for hrant on subject matters above and beyond type, the silly &lsquo;Mac people are snobs&rsquo; arguments are petty at best.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not trying to defend Apple, but am trying to defend rational debate.</p>
<p>henrypijames, as for Apple&rsquo;s influence, at least &lsquo;in the West&rsquo;, it&rsquo;s quite easily measured via sales and market penetration. One can certainly debate the charisma of the CEO and the hype that surrounds the products, but it&rsquo;s hard to argue against the facts and figures. If one is building web sites, indeed, Apple has a strong influence on things.</p>
<p>hrant, lust is, indeed, a big thing in the west. If it results in more people buying more Apple products, we can argue about whether that&rsquo;s a good thing or not, but the basic fact that it&rsquo;s influencing how the web works is harder to ignore.</p>
<p>And remember, this isn&rsquo;t &ldquo;just Apple&rdquo; that&rsquo;s going down this path. MS has little interest in pushing for Flash when they have their own SilverLight struggling to find a home. Google seems more than ready to shift away from it if they want to (they&rsquo;re already doing it with YouTube.)</p>
<p>Again, flash isn&rsquo;t going to disappear tomorrow, but there are going to be many more valid options to choose from sitting in the web developers tool box.</p>

<p>Again, I have no idea what&rsquo;s going on in Germany. Maybe Flash has a long and prosperous life ahead of itself there. Without a doubt, Apple doesn&rsquo;t fare as well in foreign markets with it&rsquo;s silly pricing over seas.</p>
<p>But in the US, that statement isn&rsquo;t that accurate. Apple is the leading mobile device company in the US. It sells more web connectible mobile devices than anyone else. It may not be in the MAJORITY of people&rsquo;s hands, but to say it doesn&rsquo;t have any influence is naive. It is also quickly becoming one of the most popular gaming devices (if not a console).</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>There was a recent news item about how Flash could be used to fill memory with repeaed patterns so as to largely vitiate a precaution Microsoft takes against buffer overflow exploits by locating parts of programs at random locations in memory instead of the same place each time.</p>
<p>Given that an iPad is a telephone, security is very critical on such a device; subverting its software could switch it into modes that allow intercepting other people&rsquo;s telephone conversations. On the other hand, surfing the web from a cell phone is expensive, and so I doubt that Adobe&rsquo;s Flash will disappear just because it is not accessible from one device.</p>
<p>Although many computer users find that it makes web sites annoyingly slow - and they value speed and usability over looking pretty. This is not an unreasonable attitude to take, and so web designers who use things like Flash excessively, or where it does not relate well to the purpose of the site, do so at the site&rsquo;s peril.</p>

Now Flash has become omnipresent, it requires at least a technologically equal alternative to displace it, even by a monopolistic platform provider. The problem is that HTML5, JavaScript and SVG are still no match for Flash in the visual department (vector animation, advance typography etc.), so there&rsquo;s no immediately available replacement in sight.</p>
<p>To summarize, the death of Flash by the hand of Apple would require (1) Apple becoming a monopolistic mobile provider (which isn&rsquo;t happening with Google joining the game), and (2) mobile becoming a deciding factor for the web (which will happen eventually, but not in the next few years), and (3) Apple starting to embrace competing technologies (which it hasn&rsquo;t so far &ndash; in fact, Apple was a major blocker of the recently failed HTML5 Video standardization attempt), and (4) the alternatives out-innovating Flash (which is extremely difficult given the snail pace at which W3C and co. move compared to Adobe) . None of those conditions is being met, ergo Apple killing Flash is simply a joke.</p>

<p>Again, I don&rsquo;t think anyone is saying Apple is killing Flash all by itself. It&rsquo;s just a fairly large straw sitting on the camel&rsquo;s back.</p>

<p>Because I&rsquo;m no expert on world wide mobile device platforms. That said&hellip;</p>
<p>A curious chart here on market share world wide:</p>

<p>If I read it correctly, Symbian is definitely the largest handset OS provider in the world. However, in terms of using the mobile device to access the web, iPhone is way up there.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not entirely sure what that means. Perhaps iPhone users waste too much time surfing the web or perhaps Symbian OS is installed on a lot of devices that aren&rsquo;t really suited for actual web browsing.</p>

Well, that is indeed happening (thank God), but the mobile market has extremely little to do with it. The driving force isn&rsquo;t Apple or even Google, it&rsquo;s Mozilla, who, until the recent arrival of Chrome, was the only open-architecture fast-innovator capable (both principally and technologically) of challenging Adobe.</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Well, I was, but I suppose the title of this thread DID use &lsquo;kill&rsquo; so perhaps that&rsquo;s what everyone else is talking about.</p>
<p>Mobile has quite a bit to do with hit, though. We recently rolled out a project where we needed a bit of animation and fancier user interface elements. We could have used Flash, but gave jQuery + Canvas/SVG a shot and found that it did everything we needed it to do.</p>
<p>So, all other things being equal, the fact that a) it didn&rsquo;t require a plugin and b) would work on all the bosses iPhones made it an easy decision.</p>
<p>I usually loathe the pace of innovation that the web browsers take, but between Google, Apple and Mozilla, it&rsquo;s rather shocking how fast things are changing (IE, aside, of course).</p>
<p>As an aside, note that Chrome is based on Webkit, which Apple uses for Safari.</p>

Content Management Systems like this one, vBulletin, IPB, and others have Flash banned from use by default and Admins are falsely co-erced by fear mongering that its devastating to a website&rsquo;s security. I do see that Typophile uses Flash, but Flash has a far greater capacity for community interaction than an animated header. Or even porn banner ads for that matter.</p>
<p>It has superior quality for web animation compared to .gif and can be used for avatars, posting custom text, scripting out and posting in-line animated ideas to your fellow community members.</p>
<p>Adobe is lazy. I think AIR was the greates software idea in recent years. The ability to integrate Flash &amp; Java to your desktop and the web&hellip; You could create huge, action intensive, websites that sit on the user&rsquo;s PC. All of the users posting here for instance, could be having a dynamic conversation with streaming video, simultaneous news articles, real-time instance based pictures, a whole lot can still be one with Flash&rsquo;s capability.

<p>Hrant, can you accurately translate the Droid screen into pixels per inch? I have a feeling (but can&rsquo;t confirm) that the difference isn&rsquo;t really that great. A clear, oranges-to-oranges comparison would be useful. I think the iPhone screen is around 163 pixels per inch, which is really not bad, and is capable of surprisingly clear image and text display.</p>
<p>I do think it&rsquo;s funny that you don&rsquo;t have any cellphone, considering all your opinions. For the record, I do have an iPhone, and I think twitter is a mess. [[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BeLZCy-_m3s|Waiting for &ldquo;Shutter&rdquo;&hellip;  ;)]]</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s about 280 dpi.
The difference is minimal if you&rsquo;re looking at a photo. The difference is huge if you&rsquo;re browsing or reading. This is largely from personal experience (I borrow smartphones all the time, although I almost never make calls on them :-) but also from common sense. Try setting the browser window to 480 x 320 on your computer and see how quickly your hair will fall out!</p>
<p>BTW, although I don&rsquo;t own a cellphone*, I do used them, and I watch people use theirs (which you can&rsquo;t do when you&rsquo;re using yours :-) and I read up on them all the time. And I will note here that I&rsquo;ve used computers since 1977, so I&rsquo;m no technophobe!  :-)</p>

<p>you don&rsquo;t need to &ldquo;kill&rdquo; flash to cause its downfall&hellip;</p>
<p>you just need to rob it of the ubiquity which has been
the primary reason for its uptake by web-designers&hellip;</p>
<p>and jobs is well on his way to disrupting that ubiquity.
once designers decide they need to provide alternatives
for non-flash users, they&rsquo;ll end up using an alternative
that will work on <em>all</em> platforms, like flash used to do&hellip;</p>

<p>I certainly hope so. Flash is the STD of the web &ndash; you get it by trying to be artsy. The only half-*ss reason to use Flash is for video, and that wouldn&rsquo;t even matter if the video codec area wasn&rsquo;t so screwed up &ndash; Quicktime is a PITA, RealPlayer and the ilk are badware, and there are far too many other competing codecs for consumers to make sense of &ndash; see the [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_codec|list]] on Wikipedia, for example. Websites that use Flash, especially for those annoying mezzanine pages and navigation menus, never get my business again.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve never had Mac OS X crash because of Flash, but many times I&rsquo;ve had a web browser running on Mac OS X crash due to faulty Flash. Sometimes what crashes Safari won&rsquo;t crash Opera or Firefox or Camino or iCab or Shiira, or it may crash any one or more of those. What is true that the Mac version of the Flash plugin has always run less efficiently than the Windows version on equivalent hardware. I&rsquo;ve seen Flash animation that still runs choppy on my year old iMac that ran smooth as glass on a Windows PC a decade ago.</p>
<p>But there is still a lot of Flash content on the web, and it is very unfortunate that it can&rsquo;t be accessed on mobile devices.</p>

<p>Yes, that&rsquo;s true. However, I think we&rsquo;ll see that remedy itself in short time.</p>
<p>For video, there are options now (provided web site is willing to implement them) and more options coming soon (HTML5 video support).</p>
<p>For animations, there are some options now (.js libraries) and some coming soon (webkit CSS transformations).</p>
<p>For complex animations, that&rsquo;s where flash might stick around. It&rsquo;d be nice to see that on a mobile device. However, I don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s a huge amount of content one would be missing.</p>
<p>For the typical use of flash&hellip;gaming, I&rsquo;m not sure a touch-based mobile device would even work for that. The standard keyboard and mouse interactions wouldn&rsquo;t apply to a multi-touch interface. So that might be moot. Fortunately, for that there are solutions now that help migrate a flash app into an iPhone app and, I&rsquo;m guessing, other mobile OS apps soon. In fact, that&rsquo;d be a great thing for Adobe to focus on&hellip;using Flash as an IDE for mobile OS apps.</p>

<p>You must be that guy who fixed the

<p>Like you say, there&rsquo;s tons of stuff made with Flash, and some of it is
valuable. A buggy OS* should not cause you to throw the baby out
with the bathwater.</p>
<ul>
<li>Apple should not depend on Adobe to satisfy
their users. They should make a proper OS.</li>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>I hear her laugh in my mind, and the emotive quality is much
higher than a laugh going through wires and a compression algorithm.</p>
<p>Just like how I think photography is just entertainment, it&rsquo;s not really culturally valuable. A photograph doesn&rsquo;t even convey 1% of what the mind is capable of; and if you need a photograph to trigger a memory, that memory simply wasn&rsquo;t memorable - you&rsquo;re fooling yourself. Which brings us back again to iTards.</p>

<p>On the one hand not depending on a cellphone deprives me from certain insights - I admit. On the other hand not depending on a cellphone -especially a specific one- gives me a broader and clearer outside view, like how when I&rsquo;m in a restaurant waiting area or ski resort chair lift I can observe instead of &ldquo;communicate&rdquo;.</p>
<p>But most of all my objectivity comes from being emotionally detached. I dislike all of these companies. MS, Apple, Adobe, to me they&rsquo;re all part of the problem*. This probably comes from my lack of faith in capitalism. The only computer company I really liked (and not for their management :-) was Commodore. The C64 and especially the Amiga could really do things. I was so emotionally attached I convinced my dad to buy stocks in Commodore&hellip; :-/  But I can&rsquo;t think of a computer company now that I like, and that&rsquo;s putting it mildly.

<p>I&rsquo;ve never heard of Flash causing OS X to crash. An OS crash (kernel panic) is a rare occurrence, usually related to low-level hardware driver problems (like installing an out-of-date audio interface driver).</p>

When a guest in your home misbehaves, you don&rsquo;t just watch.
Sometimes Flash has too much to drink. So you grab the vase

he&rsquo;s usually so much fun you invite him back again. If you

<p>Blocking Flash entirely is a good call when you have to make sure everything else stays up and running and you&rsquo;re certain that the culprit is indeed the plugin.</p>
<p>As for Adobe being lazy, the same can be said about any major software company. They rarely pay any attention to their support forums. The following website was on Hacker News today and it contains a Flash bug reported to Adobe in September 2008:</p>
<p><a href="http://flashcrash.dempsky.org/">http://flashcrash.dempsky.org/</a> [this web page should crash your browser, just to illustrate a point]</p>
<p>The bug should have been fixed in the latest beta, though.</p>
<p>Mozilla also disabled Flash by default on its Mobile Firefox, but besides some Nokia users that&rsquo;s not going to affect anyone yet. They listed the same reasons for doing so as Apple did, and they do make a valid point: if a piece of software they have no control over deteriorates the user experience to a level where the user perceives their product as somehow defective, they have a good reason for disabling it.</p>

<p>i dislike all corporations.  and most rich people,
especially if/when they feel <em>entitled</em> to be rich.</p>
<p>i hate apple less than the others, simply because
their products don&rsquo;t suck <em>quite</em> as much, and i
can&rsquo;t see why products need to suck at all, really,
except most people aren&rsquo;t too good at what they do,
and everyone&rsquo;s too busy being selfish to be <em>good</em>.</p>
<p>i hate adobe worse than the others, simply because
i have watched it buy out any competitors who had
better technology only to shelve that better stuff,
so they could then proclaim their worse stuff as the
&ldquo;de facto&rdquo; standard, and benefit from that falsity&hellip;</p>
<p>but when it comes to code running on my computer,
as long as it works, that&rsquo;s what i care about, no matter

it just so happens that it slogs my browser, <em>often</em>&hellip;</p>
<p>doesn&rsquo;t actually <em>crash</em> it, just gives me the spinning
beach ball for so long i force-quit it to avoid misery.
javascript often causes the same problem.  honestly,
i don&rsquo;t know whether it&rsquo;s flash/javascript, or stupid
scripters who don&rsquo;t really know what they&rsquo;re doing,
or smart scripters who are collecting info secretly
and phoning it back home, but in the long run, it
doesn&rsquo;t matter, as they all bog down my machine.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>There&rsquo;s definitely a movement among cutting-edge web designers and software companies — the same folks who led the way in the semantic web, XHTML-CSS design, AJAX, and now HTML5 — to abandon Flash. I&rsquo;ve been using the Click2Flash plugin to block all Flash except sIFR, and it&rsquo;s a godsend. Youtube videos now play as high-quality H.264 videos embedded in HTML5 pages.</p>
<p>In early 2009, 65% of global mobile web content was accessed by iPhones and iPods. It is as high as 92% in some markets, like Australia, and 78% in Western Europe. 32% of visitors to popular tech pundit blog Daring Fireball have Flash disabled (like I do). Firefox for Maemo (Nokia&rsquo;s mobile smartphone/tablet platform) will disable Flash due to performance issues. The release of the iPad will only serve to increase the percentage of web users who don&rsquo;t use Flash.</p>
<p>Other smartphone competitors will face the same choice Apple did. Do they ship with Flash, and leave a core part of their browsing functionality to black-box code by a third-party company known for its bugs and security holes, and thus have no power over compatibility and updates? Or do they rely on HTML5 and open-source Webkit, which can do everything Flash can do, as well or better?</p>
<p>My hunch is Flash is done for, and good riddance when it goes.</p>

<p>I can see why Jobs hates Adobe Flash, I&rsquo;ve had to work on OS X a few times before, and Flash does crash incredibly frequently. Moreso, Flash support on Linux is incredibly embarrassing (to a point where developers are trying to built their own interpreter). Everyone is moving towards HTML5 and javascript anyway. The death of flash is an inevitable consequence to open technologies advancing past it. I&rsquo;m rather glad Apple decided to acknowledge this.</p>
<p>I really do hope that Flash dies as a format, but as a program, may it live on.</p>
<p>Also, regarding more accurately the actual topic and attempting to steer my wild tangent, the death of flash on the web means little to typography. Viva la CSS3!</p>

<p>would i like higher-dpi devices?  well, certainly&hellip;

<p>but i don&rsquo;t see anyone selling such machinery.</p>

<p>i didn&rsquo;t hear about that.</p>
<p>and i&rsquo;m not sure a company from another continent
that was making &ldquo;clones&rdquo; would be preferable to me,
so i&rsquo;m not all that concerned.</p>
<p>i saw where a company in orange county was making
tablets out of macs a couple years back, and i was
quite interested in that, but their prices were too high.</p>

<p>yeah, that&rsquo;s probably one reason i hate the capitalism&hellip;</p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>you seem to have an axe to grind.  fine by me.
but there&rsquo;s no reason to make me the straw man.
i can register my own complaints about apple,
and mine hold water because i have no axe here.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s a good idea to like a
company more simply because it&rsquo;s clumsier.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>i don&rsquo;t think apple is &ldquo;clumsy&rdquo;.  quite to the contrary,
i think they are overly controlling, which is even worse.</p>
<p>microsoft, in these ballmer days, seems &ldquo;clumsy&rdquo; to me,
and if anything, it has endeared them to me of late&hellip;
(not enough for me to buy anything they sell, but still.)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>To repeat: your machine&rsquo;s software needs

</blockquote>
<p>i&rsquo;m surprised you&rsquo;d repeat something so stupid.</p>
<p>any time anybody&rsquo;s code can run on my machine,
it can cause performance problems.  by disallowing
flash, i&rsquo;m saving myself from people&rsquo;s flash code&hellip;
and so far, i&rsquo;m completely happy with the tradeoff.</p>
<p>and yes, there are times when i wish i could turn off
javascript as well, because there seems to be a lot of
buggy javascript out there now, most especially on the
websites of the legacy print-magazine publishers &ndash;
with &ldquo;wired&rdquo; being the worst offender in my experience.
but when i&rsquo;ve tried to turn off javascript, i haven&rsquo;t been
able to negotiate some sites that i like, so i was forced
to turn it back on.  but would i like a choice?  heck yes!</p>
<p>as for apple as a company deciding not to support flash,
they get crashlogs from a ton of users, so they <em>know</em>
with great certainty what is causing their machines to
suffer bad performance, and they tell us flash is bad,
so bad that they have made a point (and made it loud)
to say that they aren&rsquo;t going to support flash anymore.
it&rsquo;s a wake-up call to adobe, and adobe better wake up.</p>

<p>In most ways I agree. I was specifically talking about shutting down

<p>Agreed.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s not stupid.
A good OS is just very hard to make. And just like most any other company (especially a publicly-owned one), sadly Apple knows that saving money not doing a quality job can be cost-effective, especially when it can lay all the blame on another company rather than admit a failing.</p>
<p>In the end, it&rsquo;s not Apple that&rsquo;s annoying, it&rsquo;s people who get fooled by Apple. No other computer company has such berserker followers, and it&rsquo;s not healthy for anybody, not even Apple.</p>

<p>Although this notion is common from the peanut gallery, it&rsquo;s not quite correct.</p>
<p>There are two things that can be said about the core fan base, and neither makes these people (me included) &ldquo;berserkers&rdquo;:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Mac users love their computers and love using them. Is it really such a bad thing for Apple that people who love the computers they use tend to prefer Apple&rsquo;s computers?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Mac users are not delusional. On the contrary, they are more demanding than typical people and complain loudly whenever things aren&rsquo;t perfect. There is a strong correlation here between expectations and platform loyalty. If we weren&rsquo;t anal about everything working right, we&rsquo;d stick to Windows.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>every company should be &ldquo;envious&rdquo; of adobe in that arena.</p>
<p>they&rsquo;ve played the buy-and-dismantle-competitors game
<em>far</em> better than anyone else, at least in the tech sector&hellip;</p>
<p>and that&rsquo;s rather remarkable, because they aren&rsquo;t a <em>huge</em>
company.  but they do know their place on the totem pole.</p>
<p>they know that the big fish eat the smaller fish, and they
have successfully avoided being eaten themselves, a feat.</p>
<p>and they know their station in the pecking order, so they
make sure they&rsquo;re picking on a competitor of the right size.</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re also highly skilled at deception.  for instance&hellip;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Flash may be &ldquo;closed source&rdquo; (as in &ldquo;not open source&rdquo;, 
in the sense that the public has no way of getting 
involved in the development process), but 
the full spec has public for years, 
so it&rsquo;s not as bad as it once was.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>this is one of the biggest tricks they play on the public&hellip;</p>
<p>the make a spec &ldquo;public knowledge&rdquo;, so that &ndash; in theory &ndash;
anyone can make use of it.  but when you get down to it,
you discover all kinds of caveats.  for instance, you&rsquo;ll find
that you are specifically disallowed from making a player.
moreover, you&rsquo;ll find that there are all kinds of difficulty
in that spec, which make it extraordinarily complex to
code an authoring-tool.  moreover, because adobe is
in complete control of the spec, they can change it at will,
and they <em>will</em> change it if you <em>were</em> to manage to create
an authoring-tool that threatened their income-stream&hellip;
(they can also make sure their player will choke on any
content that&rsquo;s created by your player, making it worthless.)</p>
<p>they&rsquo;re currently pulling this type of charade with e-books,
where they combine their viewer-tool with their d.r.m., thus
making it impossible for anyone else to make a viewer-app,
which then makes it easy for them to control authoring-tools,
and thus manipulate what started out as &ldquo;an open standard&rdquo;,
the classic &ldquo;embrace-extend-extinguish&rdquo; model of microsoft.</p>
<p>(and, in case you weren&rsquo;t paying attention to e-books then,
this is what microsoft did with e-books in the late &lsquo;1990s,
with an earlier version of this  same &ldquo;open standard&rdquo; format.
publishers pulled out once they realized what microsoft was
trying to pull on them, but e-books suffered a bad setback.
now we&rsquo;re replaying the scene, with adobe in the ms-role.)</p>
<p>(also, in case you weren&rsquo;t paying attention to e-books then,
adobe also bought-and-shelved some competitors to .pdf in
the early 1990s, which is when i became hip to their strategy.
it&rsquo;s how they established .pdf as a &ldquo;defacto standard&rdquo;, which is
another trick they love to play, and repeated later with flash.)</p>
<p>i admire the craftiness of adobe in executing the strategy, but
they&rsquo;re sleazy, they&rsquo;re very sleazy, and i don&rsquo;t trust &lsquo;em a bit&hellip;</p>

It appears that the iPad OS is so closely controlled by Apple that it would be possible for Apple, remotely, to delete content on individual iPads; here&rsquo;s a brief snippet from the story&hellip;</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Apple&rsquo;s iPad could be game-changer in digital-media censorship<!-- raw HTML omitted -->	
Sunday, February 14, 2010</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->With the iPad structure, Apple is creating absolute control for product, delivery and even ownership that can be revoked at will. Apple allows or rejects the application (the container); it can remove all or part of any content from its servers; and it can even remotely delete the stuff you purchased.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>Pay no attention to the man behind the curtain&hellip;</p>

<p>Having total control, however, isn&rsquo;t the same as exercising it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Actually, it does (the ipad supports flash). Apple engineers built in Flash capability. Apple marketers published a demo video that unwittingly showed an iPad running a Flash ad on the front door of The New York Times website. But Jobs ordered Flash support removed, and had the video edited to remove the Flash scene.&rdquo;</p>
<p>“Flash would also allow iPhone and iPad users to consume video and other entertainment without going through iTunes. Flash would let users freely obtain the kinds of features they can only get now at the Apple App Store.”</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>&ldquo;Update: Apple expert John Gruber, cited below, wrote in to say his sources told him the Flash image in an iPad demo, now removed from Apple’s website, was a mockup, and that Apple engineers left Flash support out of the iPad from the start. I’ve removed a paragraph that claimed Flash already works on the iPad.&rdquo;</p>
<p>What happened to people researching their articles before hitting &ldquo;post&rdquo;?</p>
<p>As for &ldquo;consuming other entertainment without going through iTunes&rdquo;, the App Store is how we get paid for our work. Even if the devices supported Flash, I wouldn&rsquo;t be making free software for the users. I&rsquo;m getting pretty sick of every blog resorting to the App Store excuse without thinking it through.</p>
