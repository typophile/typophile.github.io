body: "Hello,\r\n\r\nI've been working on a thesis paper for the past two years and
  I'm about to defend it in a week or so, and consequently print the sucker. This
  thesis is in architecture and it is focusing on the open source, the authorship
  paradigm, network practices, and other issues of collaborative design.(arch1k.wikidot.com)\r\nWould
  someone be kind to suggest a good body/heading combination of fonts to me that would
  suit well the theme that I've described (if it makes any difference that is).\r\n\r\nSo
  far I've been using Fertigo Pro for headings and switching between Calibri and AGaramondLT
  for body. On screen Calibri makes more sense it seems and Garamond is nice on paper.\r\nI'm
  not even sure if there is a rule of using serifs for headings and sans for bodies,
  or vice versa.(Clearly I'm a n00b in the font world)\r\nI have Helvatica Neue, Universe,
  Frutiger out of the fancy sans, and Constantia, Garamond Premiere Pro for fancy
  serifs. I can also use the fonts that came with Office 2007 or whatever else I can
  find in my linux system.\r\n\r\nAlso, do all the cool kids use typesetting software
  or do the sometimes use OOo or MSWord and simply Find/Replace the all ligatures.\r\n"

    an idea &ndash; how about porting the open source issue over to your design, i.e.
    resorting to open source fonts only? One former fellow student of mine did that
    &ndash; her thesis focused (inter alia) on collaborative design / content generation
    and public domain stuff, so she ended up setting the thing in Linux Libertine.
    It wasn't perfect in terms of looking super-sleek and \"designed\", but it was
    a statement that was true to the content.\r\nUnfortunately I myself don't know
    enough about the OS font scene to make any cogent suggestions. Except you might
    look at <a href=\"http://scripts.sil.org/cms/scripts/page.php?site_id=nrsi&item_id=Gentium\">Gentium</a>
    for text.\r\n\r\n<em>\"I\u2019m not even sure if there is a rule of using serifs
    for headings and sans for bodies, or vice versa\"</em>\r\n\r\nMost of the good
    text fonts are seriffed. For headings, you have more liberties."

    open source fonts. I simply couldn't find a pro looking one yet.\r\nAndron and
    Gentium look great. The only thing that stops me is that they look rather tradition.
    I thought that maybe I could find a modern serif font.\r\nBut then again, maybe
    I don't know what I'm talking about.\r\n"

    angularity. But I'm not sure about it printing as a body."

  body: "Have you tried printing with Arno? It's a great text face, and has a nice
    color. But since you seem to be looking for something else, you could try Chaparral.
    It's a slab serif though, and it might look quite friendly. Or perhaps Warnock?
    They're usually packed with Adobe Creative Suites, so if you have InDesign or
    Photoshop, you'll probably have those that I mentioned.\r\n\r\nI haven't seen
    DejaVu Serif in print, nor Liberation Serif, but they're free. I think they also
    come with Fedora? Museo Sans could also be a viable header. Delicious kinda looks
    bad in print, though.\r\n\r\nAdobe InDesign doesn't compare to OOo or Word; it's
    great. You can even just load in the text from a source file. You can also access
    extra glyphs from your fonts (for example, Fertigo's F insignia, or Diavlo's little
    devil).\r\n\r\nBut, of course, OOo will usually suffice for papers. :)"

    well at small sizes, but its good that there are size specific cuts available.\r\n\r\n>
    <em>That said, I find it odd that Gentium is too traditional but Arno isn\u2019t?</em>\r\n\r\nyes,
    that's kinda odd. ;) Arno is of course a very traditional rennaissance like typeface.
    But I think it has enough contemporary features to make it very usable. I've set
    a poetrybook with it a while back, and it works beautifully."

    my suggestion would be to use a typeface that doesn't require ligatures. Also,
    since theses are usually required to be set at twelve points with ungainly wide
    textblocks, and you're probably not going to print at higher than 600pdi, you'd
    want something fairly sturdy looking. Constantia will work well under these circumstances,
    even without being able to use its more advanced features in OOo.\r\n\r\nIf you
    have Arno, then you either have Adobe CS3 or you some version of Adobe FontFolio.
    If you have CS, your thesis would benefit greatly from using it (provided you
    know how to use it!). I am presently typesetting my thesis in InDesign with Arno
    Pro, and it is possible to get a very good result this way. [[http://store1.adobe.com/cfusion/store/html/index.cfm?store=OLS-US&event=displayFontPackage&code=1717|Chaparral]]
    and [[http://store1.adobe.com/cfusion/store/html/index.cfm?store=OLS-US&event=displayFontPackage&code=1709|Warnock]]

  body: ">> Would simply substituting all the ligatures in OOo get a half decent result?\r\nUnfortunatley,
    no. In OOo you still can't use proper superscript numerals for footnotes, and
    the hyphenation and justification in Open Office is poor, to name just two reasons.
    You'd be better off setting the text ragged right with no hyphenation.\r\n\r\nLyX
    (LaTeX) will give you very good results, too. But importing a long document into
    tex format might not be quite seamless. I've never tried it. Depending on when
    your deadline is, I could help you set up your templates in CS to get things working
    well. After Wednesday, I would have time to help you with this. \r\n\r\nKeep in
    mind that if you didn't use styles consistently in your OpenOffice doc, much work
    will be involved in adapting it in InDesign. Depending on your time constraints,
    this is definitely a factor to consider."
