body: "I have just installed InDesign CS4 trial for Windows (normally I don't use
  this program, but I needed it to test my OpenType layouts) and was very surprised
  with the following odd effect: when I am attempting to stack several combining marks
  over a base character, they are lined up diagonally, each subsequent mark higher
  and further to right than the previous one. Thus the vertical positioning is correct
  but the horizontal is completely wrong. I have an impression there was just a typo
  somewhere in the source code, so that marks are shifted by the same amount of space
  both vertically and horizontally.\r\n\r\nThe problem can be reproduced with any
  font (e. g. SIL Doulos) and any combining marks for which proper mark to mark attachment
  points are specified.\r\n\r\nNow I am wondering, if anybody else has experienced
  this problem, and if so, if it is known to Adobe developers?\r\n"

    never <em>advertised</em> it was working. I tested with [[http://home.kabelfoon.nl/~slam/fonts/fonts.html|Rogier
    van Dalen's Legendum]], which has (AFAICT) proper mark and mkmk support. Just
    not for InDesign!\r\n\r\nSince you are testing, can you do this: type a base character,
    then a mark (which should go over the preceding character), then another character
    <strong>in another font</strong>? That fails just miserably in CS3 -- the mark
    feature loses all its magic properties, and the mark gets set as a spacing diacritic."

    shifted vertically from its default height, e.g. stacked above another combining
    mark; then type a word space; then change to another font and start typing. In
    InDesign CS3 ME, the text in the new word will be shifted off the baseline to
    a height corresponding to the height of the shifted combining mark in the previous
    font. This only happens when the last character in the preceding word is a combining
    mark.'

    Adobe's repairing their broken implementation. I tried FontForge, but my system
    doesn't like the Windows runtime for *nix proggies at all."

    Windows, you can also test mark and mkmk positioning in Wordpad and NotePad. The
    latter is particularly useful sometimes because it gives raw exposure of Uniscribe
    behaviour, without intervening layers of application or other text engine code
    such as RichEdit."

  body: "Theunis, John,\r\n\r\nI could not reproduce the bugs you have described in
    InDesign CS4. Apparently there are some improvements in comparison with the previous
    version. However the problem with 'mkmk' is quite annoying, especially because
    everything else seems to work as expected.\r\n\r\nBTW I have also noticed that
    marks are stacked properly if the base character is formatted with a different
    font (of course this usually means the first mark is positioned improperly)."

    CS3. ID CS3 had a nasty bug involving combining marks (described [[http://typophile.com/node/46665|here]])
    that got fixed. Perhaps that work triggered this new bug. I've logged it in our
    bug database and it's being analyzed. Thanks for reporting it."
