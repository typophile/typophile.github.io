  03A9, 2126\r\nNow, this is actually FontLab that creates two Unicode values, not
  me.\r\n\r\nThen I looked at the Unicode charts, and there IS two codes available

  take away one number or just let it be?\r\nThanks in advance, Font Maestro\u2019s"

  body: "The FontQA test tool represents FontShop's workflow and approach, so it flags
    a couple of things as errors which are not technically errors at all but simply
    reflect things that FontShop don't do in their own fonts (or at least think should
    be checked). This error message suggests that FontShop follows Adobe's practice
    of not double-encoding glyphs, so that there is an unambiguous path back from
    the glyph ID to a single Unicode characters (which Acrobat sometimes needs, in
    order to be able to restore character strings from a PDF created from a print
    stream).\r\n\r\nIt is, however, perfectly permissable to map a single glyph to
    multiple Unicode codepoints. It is a workflow decision not a font error."

  body: "Eigi, \r\n\r\nperhaps you could demote the error to something like warning.
    \r\n\r\nFontLab Studio 5.0.2 includes three glyphname-to-Unicode mapping tables:
    Standard Table, AGLFN 1.4 (old) strict and AGLFN 1.6 (new) strict. The AGLFN 1.4
    (old) table maps the human-readable glyphnames to the mathematical/scientifical
    Unicodes, while presuming that the Greek text glyphs would carry uniXXXX glyphnames.
    The AGLFN 1.6 (new) table reverses the logic: the human-readable glyphnames are
    mapped only to the Greek text Unicodes while the mathematical/scientifical glyphs
    would carry uniXXXX names. The Standard Table double-maps the human-readable glyphnames
    so there is no need to include the uniXXXX glyph names. \r\n\r\nIf you want to
    include both Greek text glyphs and scientific glyphs that differ in design, or
    would like to make sure that Acrobat always precisely guesses the Unicode of a
    glyph (i.e. it will never confuse the Greek text Unicodes with the scientific
    Unicodes when doing searches or text extraction in a PDF), I'd use the AGLFN 1.6
    (new) strict table. But this will mean that you will need to provide two glyphs
    for each of the characters. \r\n\r\nOtherwise, if you only want to design one
    set of glyphs, double-encode them (using the Standard Table). \r\n\r\nBTW, there
    some additional explanations in the .NAM files themselves. \r\n\r\nRegards,\r\nAdam

  body: "To sum up: \r\n\r\nIf you use the \"Standard Table\" as your default Unicode-Name
    mapping table in FLS5, your font should have three glyphs, each of them having
    two Unicode codepoints assigned: \r\nU+2206 U+0394 \"Delta\"\r\nU+2126 U+03A9
    \"Omega\"\r\nU+00B5 U+03BC \"mu\"\r\n\r\nIf you use the \"AGLFN 1.6 (new) strict\"
    as the default Unicode-Name mapping table, your font should have six glyphs, each
    having just one Unicode codepoint assigned; three of these glyphs can be composites
    of the other three: \r\nU+2206 \"uni2206\", U+0394 \"Delta\"\r\nU+2126 \"uni2126\",
    U+03A9 \"Omega\"\r\nU+00B5 \"uni00B5\", U+03BC \"mu\"\r\n\r\nFor new multilingual
    \"Pro\"-type of OpenType fonts, use of \"AGLFN 1.6 (new) strict\" (aglfn16.nam)
    is recommended. For other font work (such as fonts converted from older formats
    etc., plain/simple OpenType fonts without large character sets), \"Standard Table\"
    (standard.nam) is recommended. \r\n\r\nTo set your default Unicode-Name mapping
    table, go to the General Options / Unicode and OpenType section of FontLab Studio's
    Preferences (on Mac) or Options (on Windows). \r\n\r\nAdam"
