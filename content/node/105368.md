  body: Bellotti Bold is one font, but this one is another. The Bellotti Bold is ONLY
    used on the numbers within the current football jerseys. The University of Oregon
    should had named this modified Handel Gothic-like wordmark font something else
    before the Bellotti Bold had existed.

  body: "When the University of Oregon rebranded more than a decade ago, Melior and
    Akzidenz Grotesk were the two official university typefaces (the O mark is custom).\r\n\r\nhttp://des.uoregon.edu/getting-uo-fonts-1\r\n\r\nI
    was also able to get my hands on the U of O Athletics Style Guide, and they actually
    distribute the wordmarks that match this type as vector files. The font is is
    not commercially available.\r\nhttp://uomarketing.com/pdf/Athletics_Grahpics_Guide.pdf\r\n\r\nAccording
    to one of the databases I ran the sample through, the typeface is an 88% match
    to Akzidenz Grotesk, so I suspect the folks at Nike\u2014who designed the font,
    whose official name is OregonUniversity (no space)\u2014may have used one of the
    official university typefaces as their starting point.\r\n\r\nTo recreate the
    look, Ryuk's suggestions above are a good starting point. You could also mix and
    match Akzidenz Grotesk with the N and parts of the E from House Industries Girard
