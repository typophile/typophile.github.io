body: I'm looking for a logotype font. I was thinking of slab serif with rectangular
  form (such as Eurostile). Yet fresh, today's look... Can anyone help me out, is
  this mission impossible?

  body: Thanks Pieter! that was fast. Vitesse was very near what I was thinkg and
    it had several widths and italic, too, which is nice. Only I was thinking maybe
    even bolder than Vitesse Black.
