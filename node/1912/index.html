<div class="post-content e-content" itemprop=articleBody>Hey guys, that past few months have been tough (creatively), and this is not helping <img src=http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif alt=:-) border=0> <br> <br>I'm gonna pass this by you all, and see what you think. <br> <br>I very happy with the mark, we did that a short while back. It's the layout of the card I'm having trouble with. <br> <br>The card is two color, PMS 7542 (a muted blue)is used in the mark, in 100%, 80%, and 60%. The other color is a very dark gray. Faceplate sans (two points to whoever points this out from an earlier 'rejected' logo) <br> <br>I should ad, Sogno (pronounced sone-yo) is a textile import company, similar to IKEA but, more focused in the 'bedroom' side of the business. <br> <br>So feedback would be helpfull. <br> <br>Hildebrant. <br> <br><center><table border=1><tr><td><img src=http://www.typophile.com/forums/icons/mime_pdf.gif align=left alt=application/pdf>Sogno Business Card Layout<br><a href=http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/4100/sogno_biz_card_ideas-19691.pdf target=_blank><b>sogno_biz_card_ideas.pdf</b></a> (23.9 k)</td></tr></table></center></div>

<div class=commentbody>Kyle, <br> <br>I like the mark as well, although I must admit that I thought it was a paper company. Perhaps some sort of pattern integrated into the mark or background to allude to fabric/textiles? Also, I believe textiles are commonly distributed in round or flat rolls (imagine rolling up many many feet of fabric around something flat, like a yardstick). Just something to think about. <br> <br>In regards to the typography/layout/colors. While I like Faceplate sans, I'm not sure its the best choice for a company that does textiles. To me this face is a little too modern/techie/impersonal for the purpose. I would say the same about the color scheme -- the muted blue is okay, but I feel that the gray is does not work. What about something a bit warmer -- more natural fiber looking? Something from the off-white to medium brown range? <br> <br>Just some top-of-mind feedback for what it's worth. <br> <br> -t</div>

<div class=commentbody>Kyle, I like this. <br> <br>I kind of like Faceplate because it's kind of quirky and friendly but feels refined and modern enough. <br> <br>The mark is good, and I think you should stick with it. Pillows, rugs, curtains, and tablecloths? <br> <br>Tim's suggestion about the grey makes sense, but I haven't ever seen their range of product. A warmer grey almost brown could be pretty nice. Especially with the blue. Dark brown suit and a nice blue shirt. Maybe they're too cool for brown. <br> <br>You may have tried all this stuff already so take it for what it's worth: <br> <br>What happens when you layout the card horizontally? Could you hang the mark in the left corner and stack info underneath the sogno logotype aligned with the s? <br> <br>If you stay vertical what about aligning the information text with the imaginary centerline of the logo? <br> <br>Hang in there. Let us know what goes on. <br> <br>Jon</div>

<div class=commentbody>Hi Kyle, I like the font and the logo and the colours very much. But I'm not crazy about the while box right on top of the back of the card? Is it necessary? It seems to cut the card into two, and rather abruptly I feel. Would the design not be stronger without the white box? Just my two cents. <br> <br>Be sure to post the final. <br></div>

<div class=commentbody>Karen thats a really strong opion all ten times of it or so. Kyle, love the type but play with the layout some more, its so corporate. Maybe instead of printing the paper graphic you could stamp it or emboss it so it works on both sides of the card maybe even a diecut. Also think about using a textured paper. Its very stiff and needs to lighten up. Just my opion, Dan</div>

I just hit post, wait a few seconds, then hit the browser back button. <br>That seems to be the best technique. They probably just need to kill the email notifications for now. That would probably take a great tasking off the server. <br> <br>About all your comments, planning on addressing those in a bit. <br> <br>I do have a full color scheme developed. With gresy, blues, tans, and earth type colors. <br>I will post another .PDF here soon. (trying to actually get some work done) ;) <br> <br>hildebrant.</div>

<div class=commentbody>> go walk the dog <br> <br>Or shine those platforms. <br> <br>Kyle, the logo is totally a paper company. Try using a roll with a wavy sheet coming out. <br> <br>The other criticism I have is that the colors are a bit too muted. And what about putting a subtle background pattern (as in fabric) on part of the card? <br> <br>hhp <br></div>

<div class=commentbody>Hrant I've done work for paper companies If I see another paper roll graphic, I'm going to puke. They all use it. But texture is good. I also agree about the colors, most paper companies want to show off the brightness of their papers and how the ink jumps off the page, subtle colors and full coverage defeat that goal. Kyle you might want to be PC and use one of their recycled papers for the card and have the symbol and the percentage of recycling. The card, like an annual report can do more than post an url or phone number. Dan</div>

<div class=commentbody>Dan: I think you got side tracked, this is NOT for a paper company, but a textile company, more like IKEA, or HERMAN MILLER. Something onlong thos lines, very modern. De La Espda also is a good comparison. <br> <br>and Hrant: I hate you. ;) But I am working with adding some 'texture' to the card. A monotone fabric in place of this grey. <br> <br>I will post my next version soon. <br> <br>hildebrant.</div>

<div class=commentbody>"I kind of like Faceplate because it's kind of quirky and friendly but feels refined and modern enough" <br> <br>Jon - thats really how I felt about the text too. <br>I didnt want this to turn out 'fashion' looking. with a wide letter spaced, ultra thin face.

<div class=commentbody>Hrant, funny you should be one to talk. <br> <br>I was gonna say "I think everyone needs to stop reading malice behind every post. (Except posts by Hrant.)" <br> <br>But I thought I'd leave you out of it. Afraid you won't get the joke. <img src=http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif alt=:-) border=0> <br> <br>Now everything I post appears four times and I have to go to "Edit Profile" to delete three of them. And I even tried not leaving the page while posting. Just staying on the same page and waiting. <br> <br></div>

<div class=commentbody>1) I have a certain respect for the Kalashnikov. Even the Chinese-made imitation model. <br>2) You're right to think my sense of humor is whacked. I think it would have been the funniest thing in the world if Baby Jessica turned out to be the Anti-Christ. <br>3) I don't think you should bother deleting the duplicates. <br>4) Note the winkie in my previous post, and loosen up. I'd advise chewing gum but I understand that's become illegal there. ;-) <br> <br>hhp <br></div>
