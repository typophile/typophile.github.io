body: I&#39;m a Graphic Design student at MassArt in my sophomore year and I&#39;ve
  been going through my font collection and I find it to be very low quality.  I have
  quite a lot of professional fonts and such, but I&#39;m looking for some lesser
  known quality fonts to add to my collection.  There were a few that I thought were
  nice such as Akkurat &amp; Whitman, but can anyone suggest some others or at least
  point in the direction of a site that can help? <BR> <BR>Also how to most of you
  build your font collections, since I know I would go broke purchasing all the fonts
  I would love to have.  Do you &#34;trade&#34; with different designers?  I know
  that&#39;s probably pretty frowned upon, but I&#39;m just a poor art student so
  purchasing fonts for $180 is a bit out of my price range.  It would be a choice
  between food and fonts at those prices. <BR> <BR>Thanks in advance for any help
  you guys can give.

  body: '&#34;Trading&#34; is ripping off. It&#39;s endemic for software, and people
    usually justify it &#40;if they bother&#41; on the grounds that it&#39;s just
    some exploitative multi-national who&#39;s the victim, so stick it to the man.
    But the man has already given you the &#34;professional&#34; fonts you are dissatisfied
    with, so from here on, if you pirate fonts, you&#39;ll be ripping off designer-run
    foundries that don&#39;t make a stellar income off fonts. <BR> <BR>Does a graphic
    designer actually need a font collection? When I was an art director &#40;pre-digital&#41;,
    I would choose a new typeface every time I started work on a new campaign &#40;unless
    there was already a corporate face&#41;. Either way, the type was billed as part
    of the job.  <BR> <BR>For a student, what are your expenses for working on a project?
    I would suggest that purchasing a new font is a reasonable expense &#40;and you
    can be more canny than spending $180, learn how to stretch your budget and just
    buy the 3 or four fonts &#40;not typefaces&#41; that will do the job: &#34;economy
    of means&#34; certainly fits with Games&#39; credo &#34;maximum meaning, minimum
    means&#34;. <BR> <BR>I don&#39;t know about MassArt, but there may be licensing
    problems with using your own fonts on college/school computers.'

    <BR> <BR>I believe other founderies may have deals for students also.

  body: 'NICK:  Thanks I will think about building in buying typefaces per project
    basis.  Most of my budget for school goes into printing, books, and other art
    supplies since I take many other classes that aren&#39;t digital.  I&#39;m talking
    more about building a nice collection of fonts one by one, not a massive 3000
    font all in one collection.  I also only design on my computer at home and don&#39;t
    work in the labs so that is a non-issue. <BR> <BR>WARNER: Thanks will look through
    that now. <BR> <BR>WILLIAM:  Already have that, thank you. <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"

  body: 'I know how you feel, Keegan. At school there were always a few students that
    had extensive pirated discs with great and less-common fonts. <BR> <BR>Now that
    I&#39;m out a working, mine is slowly building from three sources: <BR> <BR>1.
    Fonts that come with design apps &#40;mainly Adobe&#41; or publications &#40;like
    <a href="http://www.buildingletters.org/">Building Letters</a>&#41; <BR> <BR>2.
    Free fonts <BR> <BR>3. Fonts per project <BR> <BR>I&#39;ve only ever bought two
    font families without a specific purpose &#40;and paying client&#41; or as part
    of something else, and they were pretty cheap &#40;$95 and $75&#41;.'

  body: Chris, <BR> <BR>I&#39;m in the same boat as you.  I&#39;m slowly building
    up my font collection... and I think this is a better way too instead of getting
    thousands of quality fonts illegally and then not having anything to look forward
    to.  You enjoy the fonts more if you don&#39;t get new ones too often.  You wouldn&#39;t
    want to eat chocolate mousse every day, would you?  &#40;I had some really good
    mousse today, mmm&#41;.
