  an 'art deco' inspired font. Has anyone got any ideas? Readability seems to be a
  problem with a lot of them.\r\n\r\nShrifteen is a favourite at the moment, but worried
  about readability. Any suggestions greatly appreciated!\r\n\r\nhttp://www.fonts101.com/fonts/view/Display/30165/Shrifteen.aspx"
