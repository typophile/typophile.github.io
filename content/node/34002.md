  body: I would gladly make an offer, but I have no idea what quantity/quality where
    talking about here & I'm afraid to make a complete fool of myself when doing so
    (I can't even think of the value of a single issue to be honoust) ;-) Ebay seems
    like the perfect solution! But please, sell the 80s & 90s issues separately (per
    decade, not per issue) since I'm mostly intersted in the 90s issues ;-) You can
    still include an all-in offer.

    there are sellers' fees. Both eBay and PayPal. U&lc issues don't go for much (somewhat
    of a hard sell). And their non-standard size is a negative factor in regard to
    shipping. They are what you might call a \"give-away.\"\r\n\r\nBut if you decide
    to partake, best word of advice: don't close an auction on a full moon. . . or
    during holidays. Or for that matter Fridays or Saturdays\u2014web traffic drops
    dramatically. For some reason Sunday night through Monday morning is prime time
    and it just drops off from there on, with Thursday afternoon as endgame. And if
    you don't believe that, monitor the daily usage statistics of Typophile (ain't
    nothing ever going on here on the weekends\u2014not sure what that reveals about
    type designers/typographers).\r\n\r\nGerald"

    I have an issue of U&lc up on eBay every week. \r\n\r\nFYI: In it's short period
    of reign ITC had a literal monopoly over the type industry and treated type designers
    like s**t. ITC was so arrogant \"it\" didn't get digital type and DTP. 1987 was
    the signal year and they were soon to be suddenly out of the picture. It took
    them years to finally figure it out.\r\n\r\nGerald\r\n\r\n"
