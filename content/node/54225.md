body: "This blog is about art work from three design movements. The three design movements
  that I am going to write about are Pictorial Modernism, The Modern Art Movement
  in America, and the New York School.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/p180466s_5914.jpg][img:sites/default/files/old-images/04363008_4534.jpg]\r\nThe
  first piece was designed by Otto Baumberger, and the second by Herbert Leupin.What
  I like most about these pieces is their realistic aspect. I can see the texture.The
  first time I saw it I had to double check to see if it was a picture or not. These
  come Pictorial Modernism and more specifically the style of Sach plakat. This design
  style is characterized by its simple, laconic, and realistic approach.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/01593001_6484.jpg]\r\nThis
  piece was designed by Herbert Bayer. It is a poster that encourages egg production.
  The thing I like most about this piece is the flat muted colors. What first caught
  my eye was the matter in this composition, and egg in front of a factory ablaze.
  I like the symmetry, I'm not really a person who goes for asymmetry for composition
  but I am working on it.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/gottschall_284_5744.jpg]\r\nThis
  is and advertisemet for Woman's Day by Gene Federico. My favorite thing about this
  piece is the use of the bicycle tires as text. I like the simplicity of the composition.
  The image is simple, but the way that it is used makes it more appealing."
