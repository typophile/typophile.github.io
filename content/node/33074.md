  body: I probably should assume that you're asking this because you don't want to
    use TheSans, which is made to work perfectly with the other members of the Thesis
    family, but just in case, here's <a href=http://www.lucasfonts.com/index_neu.html>TheSans
    Office</a>, made just for the purpose you want.

  body: TheSans would indeed be the most obvious choice. And a good one, in my opinion.
    But that's because I think it's one of the finest sans serifs available.
