  body: There's nothing wrong with this, and I wouldn't assume it to be inelegant.
    The OpenType Layout model explicitly allows this, and in some cases it may be
    the most elegant solution to a layout challenge. I regularly make fonts with staggered
    lookups.

    feature bloc as well? '

  body: You can have whatever arrangement of lookups achieves your purpose. You should
    try to be efficient, bearing in mind that the more lookups you have the greater
    the processing required during layout, but that doesn't always imply lumping all
    the lookups for one feature together; sometimes, staggering the lookups gains
    you efficiencies elsewhere.

    B by C;\r\n  } L2;\r\n} ss01;</code>\r\n\r\ncan be equivalently expressed as\r\n\r\n<code>feature

    interesting!"

  body: "Damn! \r\n\r\nScriptor, thanks for that. I've spent many years writing feature
    definitions code, and hit this problem several times, and never realized this
    simple solution. \r\n\r\nI have always assumed that in AFDKO syntax, it's not
    possible to write: \r\n\r\n<code>feature ss01 {\r\n  sub A by B;\r\n} ss01;\r\nfeature
    liga {\r\n  sub B by C;\r\n} liga;\r\nfeature ss01 {\r\n  sub C by D;\r\n} ss01;</code>\r\n\r\nBut
    actually, your post made me realize that it is possible, and correct. The AFDKO
    compiler (in FontLab Studio) will issue a warning (feature already defined: ss01)
    but it'll still compile. \r\n\r\nWhat this code does is, when expressed in AFDKO
    2.5 format, which is closer to what happens in the real font, it will produce
    three lookups: \r\n\r\n<code>lookup L1 {\r\n  sub A by B;\r\n} L1;\r\nlookup L2
    {\r\n  sub B by C;\r\n} L2;\r\nlookup L3 {\r\n  sub C by D;\r\n} L3;</code>\r\n\r\nand
    will map those lookups to two features: \r\n\r\n<code>feature liga {\r\n  lookup
    L2;\r\n} liga;\r\nfeature ss01 {\r\n  lookup L1; \r\n  lookup L3;\r\n} ss01;</code>\r\n\r\nSince
    in the font, the it is the order of lookups that defines the order of processing
    of the glyph stream, this will have the effect that if only \"liga\" is active,
    only the lookup L2 will be executed, if only \"ss01\" is active, the lookup L1,
    and then L3, will be executed, and if both features are active, then the lookups
    will be executed in the order L1, then L2, then L3. \r\n\r\nBrilliant. I never
    thought that this was actually possible to do in the AFDKO 1.6 syntax that FontLab
    Studio 5 is using. (In AFDKO 2.5, which is used by Fontographer 5 and DTL OTMaster,
    and will also be used by FontLab Studio 5.5, I assumed that this was only possible
    by placing the lookup definitions outside of the feature definitions. But I was
    wrong. The method shown above is also valid, and it works in AFDKO 1.6 already.
    Cool!)\r\n\r\nBest,\r\nAdam\r\n"

  body: 'My concern is about the two or three recompilations that might occur before
    it all comes up on an end user programme. How is one to know that a ''warning''
    such as you mention does not mean that a subsequent piece of programming might
    be too clever by half and decide to bring all the ''calt'' coding together into
    one block so that all of it ends up upstream of the ''salt'' feature anyway? '
