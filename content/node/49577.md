body: "We're pleased to announce the re-release of two breathtaking new fonts from
  the Filmotype Font Library.\r\n\r\nInitially designed in the early-to-mid 1950s,
  Filmotype Ginger helped usher in the Mod typographic stylings of the early 1960s
  visual aesthetic yet it retains a classic and timeless feel. This classic Sans Serif
  face joins the Filmotype Glenlake font as one of our Gothic revivals.\r\n\r\nAmong
  the very first handwritten script fonts offered by Filmotype in the beginning of
  the 1950s, Filmotype LaSalle was designed by Ray Baker, a former Lettering Inc employee
  at the time who named the face after LaSalle street in downtown Chicago.\r\n\r\nBoth
  faces were developed from the original filmstrips and include a full international
  character compliment, automatic fractionals, ordinals, and a host of alternate characters
  and ligatures to allow flawless typesetting in dynamic OpenType format. \r\n\r\nWe're
  pleased to share the re-release of these amazing original designs from the 1950s
  and hope you'll find them to be a perfect compliment to your design toolbox.\r\n\r\nYou
  can purchase, preview and discover more about these faces online exclusivly at Font
  Bros!\r\n\r\nSee 'em here: http://www.fontbros.com/filmotype.php\r\n\r\nWarmly,\r\nStuart\r\n"
