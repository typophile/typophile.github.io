  body: It's Fiedler Baroque Gothic 9 from Photo-Lettering. Looks like the top of
    the /a/ is pulled in a bit.

  body: Thanks! Looks like <a href="http://www.fonts.com/font/monotype/pl-fiedler-gothic/bold">Fiedler
    Gothic</a> and the <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/search/mansfield/fonts/">Filmotype
    M fonts</a> have a lot in common, which I guess is no surprise.

  body: "Hi Mark, I understand House Industries now owns the Photo-Lettering collection.
    Do you know whether HI will publish Fiedler Baroque Gothic 9 in the near future?\r\nI
    have not seen a complete specimen, but am I right in assuming that the fox-tail
    terminals, as shown in the sample, are also used for the uppercase and numerals?\r\nThanks\r\nDon"

  body: I have no idea, but the odds are probably against it given how many fonts
    are in the Photo-Lettering collection. You could ask them if you're interested.
    And, yes, some of the caps and numerals also have fox-tail terminals.

  body: "Thanks Mark. \r\nI did some web checking. Apparently all Photo-Lettering
    published in the way of specimens was a big book of one line phrases, each composed
    in a different design, that regular purchasers could use to order from.  Also,
    I seem to recall seeing such a book in a university library a few years ago. \r\nThis
    is just a guess, based on the 1963 book cover and your comment, that a Fox-tail
    Gothic design inspired by Fiedler Baroque Gothic 9 would use fox-tail terminals
    for:\r\n\u2022   2 3[top and bottom] 5 6 6 9\r\n\u2022   C[top and bottom] G[top]
    J Q S[top and bottom] \r\n\u2022   a c[top and bottom] e f j q r[book title shows
    ball terminal but I find it discordant] s[top and bottom] t y.\r\n\u2022   $[top
    and bottom] & ?\r\nDoes any of this look out of place? Did I miss some -- perhaps
    K k R?\r\nDon"

  body: "This is from Alphabet Thesaurus Vol. 2 (1965 printing), the \"one line\"
    specimen:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/FiedlerBaroqueGothic-oneline_6719.jpg]\r\n\r\nAnd
    here's the full character set from the index:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/FiedlerBaroqueGothic9-fullset_5564.jpg]\r\n\r\nBy
    the way, those nicks in the letters in the top row I don't think are part of the
    design, just production glitches. The full character set samples are tiny, about
    6 pt. size.\r\n\r\n(Man, I'd get a lot more fonts made if I only had to do that
    many characters.)"

  body: "Many thanks Mark!\r\nI appreciate your effort in producing a clean scan of
    the 6 point character set -- which omits only a few characters which seem seem
    generally obvious to predict. \r\nThis is gold to my eyes.\r\nIt's great to be
    able to confirm analytical design expectations and to discover where they erred.\r\nThe
    book title was misleading on the relative presence of foxtail and ball terminals.
    It showed only one ball or semi-ball terminal -- the r -- but I now see that there
    are actually quite a few of them.\r\nDon"
