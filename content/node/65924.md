  I forgot to mention. The logo type is in <em>uppercase</em>."

    . . . I never noticed before. Perhaps students deserve something less clich\xE9,
    so a slab might be a good choice after all."

    type of school is this?\r\nWhat is the history of the school?\r\nWhere is it located?\r\nAre
    the students and faculty more conservative or progressive? \r\n\r\nIn general,
    the education field tends to use classic, serif typefaces.\r\nUnless you're an
    art school."

  body: I never wrote "bane". I wrote "bland", in the sense that slab serif typefaces
    are overused for school identities. That said if you don't want anything innovative,
    go for it.
