    the veracity of all the information.\r\nThis isn't really a type timeline, as
    you don't include the start of printing, more the early part is writing, while
    the later are art movements and economic change and social development.\r\nYou
    might find this thread useful\r\nhttp://typophile.com/node/28219\r\n\r\nTim\r\n\r\n<em>[Edit:

  body: "Faz, I think your premise is wrong.\r\nThere was no type in the time of the
    ancient civilizations (which I presume is what you mean by Egypt, Mesopotamia,
    etc.)\r\n\r\nYour first step should be to:\r\n\r\nIdentify the major historical
    genres of type*\r\n\r\nand then try and correlate them with other historical movements.
    AFAIK, Robert Bringhurst is the only person to make a real good go of this, in
    his Style Guide otherwise known as \"Bringhurst\" - sort of a typographer's Bible).
    His little history only takes a dozen or so pages in the book, but is IMHO, absolutely
    crucial to your study project.\r\n\r\n*Perhaps the best book to do this is Geoffrey
    Dowding's \"An introduction to the histroy of printing types\" -- it is short
    and accessible to the non-specialist, and organizes by both phenotype (physical
    characteristics of type) and historical era -- so is very useful in associating
    those two different means of classification.\r\n\r\nIf you want to make it more
    about the evolution of alphabets in different cultures (which would perhaps be
    more inclusive and politically correct), that is a completely different story,
    but it is not the timeline of type. "

  body: "For European type the start date is the mid fifteenth century with <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johannes_Gutenberg\">Gutenberg</a>,
    so your study should probably begin there. As Tom Christensen says in this <a
    href=\"http://typophile.com/node/28219\">thread</a>  and his <a href=\"http://www.rightreading.com/printing/gutenberg.asia/gutenberg-asia-1-introduction.htm\">article</a>
    Koreans had a printing technology which <em>may</em> have informed Gutenberg.
    So, although the earliest European types were formed based on the contemporary
    and local writing styles, as the technology spread through Italy and Europe the
    style changed, to what is familiar to the modern lay reader.\r\nIt is technology
    rather than artistic developments that drove type evolution, although one cannot
    completely separate art movements from type design.\r\nTim"
