body: A distressed pixel font? Playing around with possibilities here. The top set
  is the hand-built original. The bottom three sets sport varying levels of &#34;decay&#34;.

  body: I like the possibility of taking pixel fonts in this unexplored direction
    &#40;to my knowledge&#41;. Naturally, they are niche typefaces at best, but they
    do have an entirely different feel to them than their parent typefaces. I like
    the raw feeling they have, and don&#39;t mind the knobby look that comes as a
    result of this technique. <BR> <BR>Any thoughts? <BR> <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/40629.gif"

  body: I like the idea of distressed pixel fonts, and I like the looks you&#39;re
    getting here. I suppose my question is what kind of distressed look are you looking
    for? I&#39;m not seeing much in the examples, but maybe i&#39;m not seeing them
    in the right way.

  body: I think he means that they appear to be worn down around the edges, ground
    down, sort of. When I think of &#34;distressed&#34;, I think of pock-marked or
    scratched, myself, but it ain&#39;t necessarily so.
