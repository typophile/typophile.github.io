    cover doesn't work for me, which is not the problem of Meta Serif of course. Thanks
    for sharing!\r\n\r\n<em>Didn\u2019t think about a coloured FF Meta Serif</em>\r\nHmm,
    why that? I think M. Serif is strong and neutral enough for a lot of different
    treatments. First i had to think of the (agreeable) use of Walbaum in children
    books, hehe \u2026 nobody will follow this comparison :)"

  body: "<cite>Hmm, why that?</cite>\r\nOkay, maybe not colored in that way with more
    than one color. But I like it and it demonstrates that FF Meta Serif is a real
    work horse. My favorite one at present. [I even use it for Apple Mail \u2026]"

    the font installed as well. I suspect that Ivo just prefers to read his own mail
    in Meta Serif."
