body: I created my logo about 3 years ago for my jewelry site and since that time
  have done a couple of repavings of my computers. I cannot find what font this is.
  I have tried using the online sites that can identify fonts but nothing even comes
  close. Please help me in determining what font I used. Thanks.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/foxdencreationslogo2_5751.png]
