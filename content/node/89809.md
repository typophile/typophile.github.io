body: "Hi, guys first time posting and i was wondering if can help me, i'm currently
  building my first typeface, and i can't figure out a solution to the problem in
  hand. Here's my process, if it helps:\r\n1 - created paths in illustrator\r\n2 -
  imported to fl\r\n4 - expand it \r\n5 - created the round endings on the straight
  lines.\r\n\r\nThe problem exists when i try to create the round endings on a diagonal
  line, it just won't look right, i've even tried to make a straight form and then
  rotate it, but the round endings deform, is there a way to make the round endings
  look good?"

  body: I don't know if this will help you. I've noticed that the square node instead
    of a triangle where the straight line turns into curve. The triangle node avoid
    to have a broken join between line and curve.

  body: Use a bigger UPM (like 4000). This will reduce the rounding errors that now
    cause your deformations. Or use Glyphs ([[glyphsapp.com|glyphsapp.com]]) where
    you can disable rounding altogether.
