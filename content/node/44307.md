body: "Hi,\r\n\r\nMy client is a job agency named \"TimeZeit\", a hybrid of the English
  \"time\" and its German equivalent \"zeit\". \r\n\r\nThe two founders want a solution
  that appeals to corporate clients but looks fashionable and stylish as well.\r\n\r\nThe
  first draft of their new website can be accessed [[http://timezeit.designbits.de|here]].\r\n\r\nAnd
  this is the first two logo drafts I came up with:\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/logo_uhr_1_6467.png]\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/logo_uhr_2_6644.png]\r\n\r\nPlease
  let me know which solution you think is better and how it might be improved. Thanks!!"

    much for me.\r\nHave you attempted to use the top typeface and clock hands in
    the same format as the second logo?"

  body: "Tintin,\r\n\r\nFirst off I think the logos look good but I do have a few
    suggestions.\r\n\r\nThe first logo looks a bit more playful and less upscale than
    the latter. I don't know the client like you so it may work for them. It feels
    like it's trying to look balanced on either side but it feels like there's a bit
    more optical space on the left.\r\n\r\nThe second logo has a more corporate feel
    like either the clock is too heavy or the type is too light. I like what you did
    for the hands on the clock but they may not really mesh with the serif.\r\n\r\nGreat
    work so far."

    \"time\" already two times in the name, I wouln't put an image of a clock on top

    echo Ralf's sentiments \u2013 I think involving a person or at least some human

  body: "Tintin, \r\n\r\nI agree with the previous comments, especially about the
    icon not being centered. Visually I think it needs to be either dead on or purposely
    off center.\r\n\r\nI don't understand the name either... time time?  A logo should
    immediately convey what the product is it's selling or promoting. Adding a clock
    is so literal and I think only serves to describe the name, not the profile of
    the company. It takes on the air of a watch repair company instead of a job placement
    agency... which I think is what the website appears to indicate. Perhaps a \u201Ctime
    card\u201D concept would be appropriate? Or if they really like the clock perhaps
    use the two words as arms of a clock?  Don't give up yet, you've got a great start.

    Don't worry, I am holding a license for every single one of those images. I've
    got them from [[http://www.istockphoto.com|iStockphoto.com]] which gives you far
    better value for money than Getty images.\r\n\r\nWhat's so bad about the name?
    I didn't come up with it but I like the sound of it and find it quite memorable.\r\n\r\n[[http://www.designbits.de|Webdesign

    a cultural thing\u2026 it's not unusual to see English words smattered throughout

    think there might be something in exploring the concept of time further - absolute
    clocks etc ... do they need to be shown?\r\n\r\nright now it's certainly not stylish,

    I think there's great possibilities to create the \"clock\" with the letters \"I\"
    of both words.\r\n\r\nI hope this helps. It's nowhere near finish product, but
    it may give you a good direction.\r\n\r\n- Manuel\r\n\r\n\"less is more\"\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/timezeit_6441.jpg]"
