    Is open-faced supposed to be a more professional way to describe the outlined

  body: "Not entirely, open face is more like an engravers style, it has thicks and
    thins and gives an impression of depth or being carved, while outlined is a literal
    outline of a face (imagine you had cut out a letter from a piece of card and then
    traced around it onto a piece of paper) which looks like <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/efscangraphic/princetown-sh/\">this</a>.
    To further confuse matters there is another effect called inline which looks like
    <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/search?search%5Btext%5D=inline\">this</a>.\r\nI
    hope this hasn't confused you too much.\r\nTim"

  body: I often hear people refer to OpenType as "open face". It drives me nuts.

  body: i always thought the "Recut" on Mona Lisa was confusing. why are there so
    many terms for such similar effects?

  body: " >why are there so many terms for such similar effects?\r\n\r\nI think it
    perpetuates itself. For instance, I wasn't aware there was only one correct way
    to name a face with a little bit of negative work done on it, so when I did such
    a face, I named it in a similar manner to one that had a similar effect. Hence
    Walburn Hand Tooled, after Goudy Handtooled. I was also aware that a number of
    ITC faces had that designation (Cheltenham, Garamond), so figured it was a reasonable
    precedent.\r\n\r\nThe main Open Face I knew was Bodoni, which has a different
    effect from the ITC fonts. "
