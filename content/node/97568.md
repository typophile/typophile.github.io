  body: To judge from the 1971 date, the text was most likely set on an IBM Selectric
    Composer using one of that machine's proprietary faces, probably Press Roman.
    I can't identify the sans-serif font in headline, but I think it's dry transfer
    lettering. The largest size on the IBM Selectric Composer was 12 point, and transfer
    lettering was a popular low-budget solution for display type in the 70s.

  body: "I used the Serif Font ID Guide and found that [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/gazette/?refby=bowfin|Gazette]]
    or [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/bitstream/imperial/?refby=bowfin|Imperial]]
    may be closer matches than Bookman. Both were designed by Ed Shaar in the 1950's,
    so would have been available as metal type.\r\n\r\nI don't think this book looks
    like it was done with a typewriter, because some rather awkward spacing was used
    to justify the margins. I don't think a typewriter would be able to do this.\r\n\r\n-

  body: "Sorry, I see Mojo was talking about an IBM composer, not a typewriter, and
    that might be right. I am not familiar with that equipment, but I do think digital
    versions of Gazette or Imperial might look closer to the type than Bookman.\r\n\r\n-

  body: Mike, Gazette looks like a winner. The IBM Composer could justify lines, though
    as the sample shows, its justification capabilities were limited.
