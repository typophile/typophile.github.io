  views on the relationships between calligraphy and type design.

  body: Calligraphy used to be the only way to make books until typesetting came along.  The
    first types were made to look very much like calligraphy.  After a while, type
    moved its own way and did not try to be calligraphy for mass production.  There
    still was a strong visual relationship for many years.  Modern tools did not require
    using calligraphic tools so type lost its dependence on calligraphy, but not its
    history.  Today's type can either mimic script writing better than ever or totally
    ignore any relation to it.  The tools have opened the possibilities to anything
    imaginable.  The tools are still slave to the human who uses them and directs
    them just as once upon a time when the human directed the pen.  The pen had certain
    limitations that the digital era tools do not.  Digital tools may also have limitations
    but they are much less predictable.

    production until typesetting came along (block printing of text existed, but it
    was never a very significant technology). Scribal text production shouldn't be
    called calligraphy, which refers to a particularly high quality of writing that
    is treasured for its graphic excellence. Some scribal book production meets that
    standard, but huge amounts was the written equivalent of what we would call jobbing
    work."

  body: "Type design will produce letter shapes that can be used in the process of
    typesetting. After the type designer's job is done, there will be other people
    doing the lay-out and the printing of the text.\r\nCalligraphy will reproduce
    text. Calligraphers may or may not design their own letter shapes, but in any
    case they will do the lay-out and the printing (as in: putting the letters to
    paper) themselves.\r\n\r\nFor type designers and calligraphers it may be interesting
    to discuss the letter shapes each of them comes up with. A conclusion will be
    that some calligraphers do not invent their own letter shapes. That's fine, as
    long as they do not claim the contrary. They may discuss kerning as well. A conclusion
    will be that some type designers do not kern their own letter shapes. That's fine,
    as long as they do not claim the contrary.\r\nFor graphic designers and calligraphers
    it may be interesting to discuss the lay-out issues each of them deals with. Most
    type designers will be laymen in these discussions. That's fine, as long as they

  body: Nick, let me clarify what I meant by 'block printing of text', and it not
    being a significant technology. By this I meant carving of entire pages of raised
    text in wood, which does not appear to have ever been a major technology in text
    manufacture in the West (it was more widely known in Asia). The transition that
    occurred in book publishing in the second half of the 15th Century is from predominantly
    scribal production to predominantly metal typeset production. Block printing of
    text existed both before and during this period, but doesn't seem to have been
    widely used enough to factor in the transition.

  body: Block printing made more sense in Asia where pictogramatic glyphs numbered
    in the thousands compared to phonetic Latin and Greek based glyphs numbered in
    the tens.  Repeated glyphs in Western languages were quite a bit more frequent.
    It was simply much more equitable for Westerners.

  body: Yes, the grid system of shapes would be helpful in sawing but distributing
    (and setting upright) would be quite a bit harder than Latin script.

    and calligraphy are two means by which a text can be presented to a reader.\r\n\r\nAs
    calligraphy, unlike typography, involves forming the letters used by hand, it
    can also be used as a method of type design.\r\n\r\nIt certainly is true that
    types may be designed in a non-calligraphic fashion. One may take [[http://fontsinuse.com/uses/1197/bifur-typeface-specimen|Bifur]]
    as a simple and obvious example.\r\n\r\nFutura, Optima, and Cooper Black might
    be cited as more conventional typefaces that really don't make one think they
    were written with nibbed pens.\r\n\r\nAlthough Cooper Black could be pulled off
    with the right Speedball point. And so could Times Roman, or Copperplate Gothic.\r\n\r\nBut
    Roman type, in general, while it owes something to calligraphy, also owes something
    to the <em>chisel</em> instead of the pen.\r\n\r\nSo, yes, I will agree that type
    design is not subservient to, or a branch of, calligraphy. However, despite that,
    I still also feel that calligraphy is a very useful influence on typography; it's
    a source of new, yet conservative, ideas that will lead to typefaces that will
    be readable and find ready acceptance.\r\n\r\nWhile I reject Fraktur as a desirable
    written style, I think - and hope - that among the various rotundas a starting
    point for a viable alternative to Roman may yet be found."

    think that was true only at the very beginning when type needed help being accepted.
    That was a long time ago. Now it's a very bad influence because it inhibits progress
    much more than it helps enrich this already overcrowded party. In fact the party's
    over, the alcohol and chips are all gone, but the damn slouch won't leave.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    to be cut on stone have almost always been either drawn or written on the stone
    first -- most famously, Fr Catich demonstrated how imperial Roman inscriptions
    would have been brush lettered before cutting -- it is hard to conceive of any
    characteristic of these letters that are owed particularly to the chisel. Stone,
    especially those kinds most favoured by letter cutters, such as the fine English
    and Welsh slate, is a high resolution medium: with a sharp chisel of appropriate
    size and shape, there is pretty much no form that one cannot cut in it."
