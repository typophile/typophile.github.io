body: "A while ago I released a typeface based on Unicorns, which found it's way into
  some weird places I never expected (think about yearbooks for heavily Christian
  school communities) Of course you can still find the font, including the horn-less
  sans and rainbow numerals [[http://www.arthus.nl/unicorns_en.php|here]].\r\n\r\nNow
  I was thinking: What could improve this? I actually was thinking of a new series
  of Unicorns since the last one wasn't that well-drawn. But there had to be more!
  So I thought: What could be better than Unicorns with Pegasus wings?\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/LUST_4130.jpg]\r\n\r\nNow
  I'm slowly finishing all the caps now, which will still require some work. I won't
  be vectorizing them, but they will of course need a good cleanup. They are meant
  as initials, but they should of course work just as well when placed next to each
  other.\r\n\r\nBitmaps aside, are there any good ways to implement these? I'm afraid
  I will be stuck with placable psd's (or transperant png's), making my main target
  group (sadly MS Word users) (almost) unable to use them.\r\n\r\nIdea's would be
  welcome!"

    body: "Yep, I know of Photofont, but it's already quite designer focused, which
      makes it not much different (for my use) than making a very good aligned PSD
      which people just can copy/paste (seeing it will mostly be used for initials
      and not full texts)\r\n\r\nThe issue is that about 75% of the users will stick
      to basic text editors such as MS word which doesn't offer a lot of possibilities.
      I guess the best solution is to let the user place the high-res images and then
      hope for the best, I just want to make it as easy to use as possible.\r\n\r\n"

  body: "The clipart is a good one! I forgot how Word used to handle it, will try
    out on a copy sometime.\r\n\r\nAnd yeah, it's easy to vectorize and make a font
    out of the drawings, that's what I did previous time. But I'm quite fond of the
    'drawn charm', it breaks a bit from the wingless version."

  body: Yeah, I will probably look into that a bit later, They will require some downsampling
    for the planned silkscreens anyway. Vectorization will have to wait anyway since
    another project is draining all my Bezier-energy.

  body: Maybe you should talk to a developer. It might not make sense to create a
    plugin for every possible application, but a small standalone tool that generates
    words or sentences with proper spacing as one image file would make it useful
    for more than professionals. This could also be done for web, btw.
