    and Helvetica are the first/most important. I sometimes think a neo grotesque
    is a grotesque drawn with the same mindset as Futura. '

  body: "This term is rather like Transitional.\r\nIt is a convenience invented to
    describe how a popular and in\uFB02uential typeface informs the historical narrative,
    but as a genre there were few members at the time.\r\n\r\ni.e. transitional =
    Baskerville, neo-grotesque = Helvetica, Univers and Folio.\r\n"

  body: "I'm a bit fuzzy on the details, but from past research I concluded there
    are actually virtually no Grotesque typefaces in use today. There weren't many,
    and only a few have been digitized. Akzidenz Grotesk is a grotesque. Helvetica
    and Folio neo-grotesque typefaces.\r\n\r\nAs far as I'm aware\u2014and strangely
    enough\u2014the distinction is in design date and not in design. Also note that
    slab serifs were initially considered grotesques as well. As \"grotesque\" referred
    to the ugliness of these typefaces at the time, it seems to have been a very wide
    style initially.\r\n\r\nNick, what do you mean with your statement? I wrote down
    some criticism but I first want to make sure I'm understanding you correctly."

  body: "Transitional and neo-grotesque are \u201Cphylogenetic\u201D terms, created
    to explain certain historical narratives, in particular the idea that typefaces
    evolve. \r\n\r\nAnother method of classifying typefaces is \u201Ctaxonomic\u201D,
    based on physical attributes, e.g. the PANOSE system.\r\n\r\n"

  body: I'm still not sure I understand you correctly, but let's try it. It seems
    you're implying neo-grotesque came about to distinguish between two time periods
    while stylistically they're the same, but this contrasts largely with transitional,
    which is quite a major deviation from garalde stylistically. So how is the term
    neo-grotesque like the term transitional?

  body: "No, what I\u2019m saying is that historians wanted to explain where Helvetica
    and Univers came from, as the type genre favored by the modernist international
    style, but could not term them revivals, because that was too old-fashioned. By
    adding the prefix \u201Cneo-\u201D they preserved the idea of historical continuity.\r\n\r\nSimilarly,
    when historians wanted to classify Baskerville, they noted that it formed a bridge
    between the old style (e.g. Caslon) and the didone (e.g. Bodoni), so they named
    it transitional. \r\n\r\nSo the issue with these categories is to disentangle
    whether one is referring to the physical appearance of a typeface, or where it
    \uFB01ts chronologically. \r\n\r\nHeadliners International (the North American
    phototypositor type house franchise) named a small x-height genre of its versions
    of the classics \u201CNeo-Mini-\u201D, e.g. Neo-Mini-Garamond, c.1980.  \r\n"
