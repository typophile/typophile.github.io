  body: It'd be nice if it just told you that you're missing a semicolon, but how
    does it know you meant to put one there? Instead, it keeps going past that point
    until it runs into something it doesn't understand, i.e., a syntax error. The
    missing semicolon was not the syntax error, but its absence led to one.

  body: "@ Claus\r\n\r\nI just checked, how informative the error messages of Makeotf
    (belonging to the AFDKO 2.5 21898) are. You wrote, that you wish a better error
    reporting. But in my test I was contented with the error reports of makeotf:\r\n\r\n\r\n<strong><code>syntax
    error at \"feature\" missing \";\" [TestFont.fea 1469]\r\nmakeotfexe [FATAL] &lt;TestFont&gt;
    aborting because of errors\r\nmakeotf [Error] Failed to build output font file
    \ TestFont.otf.</code></strong>\r\n\r\n<strong><code>Dr\xFCcken Sie eine beliebige
    Taste . . . (Press any key)</code></strong>\r\n\r\n1469 is the line number, in
    which the semicolon is missing. In this example it was the last semicolon of the
    kern feature.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd in the following example I have removed the last
    semicolon of a substitution rule:\r\n\r\n\r\n<strong><code>syntax error at \"sub\"
    missing \";\" [TestFont.fea 189]\r\nmakeotfexe [FATAL] &lt;TestFont&gt; aborting
    because of errors\r\nmakeotf [Error] Failed to build output font file  TestFont.otf.</code></strong>\r\n\r\n<strong><code>Dr\xFCcken
    Sie eine beliebige Taste . . . (Press any key)</code></strong>\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat
    was your problem with the report of makeotf? I am contended with the error report.
    It makes out the missing semicolon as problem.\r\n\r\nIn the following example
    I removed the word sub from the rule \"ignore sub a' @all_without_space;\". And
    the error message is:\r\n\r\n\r\n<strong><code>syntax error at \"a\" missing {
    substitute reverse position } [TestFont.fea 188\r\n]\r\nmakeotfexe [FATAL] &lt;TestFont&gt;
    aborting because of errors\r\nmakeotf [Error] Failed to build output font file
    \ TestFont.</code></strong>\r\n\r\n<strong><code>Dr\xFCcken Sie eine beliebige
    Taste . . . (Press any key)</code></strong>\r\n\r\n\r\nIn all three examples makeotf
    has posted the correct line number. And in all three examples it had been easy
    to make out the problem.\r\n\r\n---------\r\n\r\nI started makeotf with the help
    of a batch file:\r\n\r\n<strong><code>@echo off\r\nif exist TestFont.otf del TestFont.otf\r\nif
    exist current.fpr del current.fpr\r\ncall makeotf -f TestFont.pfa -ff TestFont.fea
    -gf TestFont_GlyphOrderAndAliasDB -ga\r\ndel current.fpr\r\npause</code></strong>\r\n\r\n---------\r\n\r\nJust
    a secret (Not anymore now!) tip for the case, that you find the AFDKO too uncomfortable:\r\n\r\nI
    am using it for the generation of the GPOS and the GSUB table only. When I have
    generated the OTF with makeotf I decompile the GPOS- and the GSUB-table (the GSUB-table
    as hexdata) with TTX, because TTX can damage the GSUB-table in certain cases.
    This requires, that you temporarily delete G_S_U_B_.pyc and G_S_U_B_.py (I have
    written a batch file for this, a switcher. Search for G_S_U_B_.pyc and G_S_U_B_.py
    in your AFDKO directory). And then I merge the two decompiled tables into the
    font, that I have generated with FontLab. It is absolute necessary, that the order
    of the glyphs in the glyph-order-file is matching with the glyph-index in FontLab,
    if you decompile the GSUB-table as hexdata."

  body: "The FM modules have a modified version of the AFDKO under the hood, hence
    the similarities between the <em>syntax error</em> messages.\r\n\r\nAs an alternative
    for compiling, decomposing and merging tables using FL, TTX and the AFDKO, there
    is the option in OTM to compile binary OT Layout tables using for instance an
    \u2018all covering standardized\u2019 GSUB features file, like <a href=\"http://www.typefaces.nl/Temporary/ClientDownloads/27052010/Typophile/features_OTM.txt\">this
    one</a> (my most recent file [I added some comments]; change the \u2018txt\u2019
    suffix in \u2018fea\u2019 for OTM) and a font specific (of course) GPOS file.
    One can test this with the <a href=\"http://www.fontmaster.nl/english/demo.html\">Light
    versions</a> of OTM (saving is disabled though).\r\n\r\nAn option for FL users
    is to compile the GPOS in FL and to add the GSUB with OTM. The character set does
    not have to correspond with the GSUB features listed; all obsolete features will
    be removed after compiling, just like in the FM modules. Of course, the naming
    conventions in the font and the features file should match.\r\n\r\nIf everything
    goes well, one of the coming versions of OTM will support this functionality on
    batch level via a command line.\r\n\r\nAdmitted, both TTX and the AFDKO are costs-free
    and OTM isn\u2019t, but when it comes to convenience, time saving, reproducibility
    and standardization, OTM clearly wins, I reckon.\r\n\r\nFEB\r\n\r\n"

    (the index!) likewise has not to correspond in the very most cases \u2013 except
    you make use of my trick. My trick with the hexdata is helpful in rare cases \u2013
    if the GSUB table contains names for the stylistic features for example. TTX does
    actually not support that, but the latest makeotf does.\r\n\r\nAnd with regard
    to OTM, it is unfortunately out of my budget as amateur. (And the money, that
    you wanted to have for the last update \u2013 no, that would be too much for me.)
    In relation to the time one needs for designing a font, compiling the features
    with the AFDKO is almost nothing. You only have to understand it one time. With
    a strategy the AFDKO is not really uncomfortable."

  body: "@ Karsten\r\n\r\nI don\u2019t directly contradict to you, but I would like
    to complement:\r\n\r\n1. In my opinion it is better to program the features in
    a text editor. I comment my features. If I import them in FontLab, it depends
    on the position of comments (before or after a feature), where they are displayed
    on the feature panel. Sometimes a comment is regarding to a group of features.
    But in FontLab it looks like the comment is regarding to one feature only.\r\n\r\n2.
    The languagesystem statement \"DFLT dflt\". FontLab is not able to compile it,
    isn\u2019t it?\r\n\r\n3. Stylistic set features and names for stylistic set ('ss01
    - ss20') features are cool, but not supported by FontLab.\r\n\r\n4. If you use
    the AFDKO only, if FontLab does not support a special thing, you need more time
    to make use of the AFDKO, when you need it. So why not directly use it? (The training
    aspect.) Doing anything from the command line is wrongly scaring for many people,
    because it is not difficult, but just a bit unwonted. It is not a loss, but a
    win of comfort, if you learn how to use the command line and how to program batch
    files.\r\n\r\n5. The AFDKO is free software and partly OpenSource. If you have
    not FontLab, but TypeTool or another font editor only, that is unable to compile
    features, you have to use the AFDKO, if you want to put OT features into your
    font. I would say, that the syntax, as it is expected by the AFDKO should be the
    standard, when code snippets are posted here. As more people use the AFDKO, as
    more people explore its possibilities. When others wait for a new version of FontLab
    with a later version of an OT compiler, you and me always have the latest. The
    AFDKO furthers the competition between the developers of software."
