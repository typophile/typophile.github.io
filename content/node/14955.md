body: Another designer created this logo and doesn't recall the name of the typeface.
  I have to produce other collateral for the project and need to know what the font
  is. Anyone have any ideas? I've seen it before, so I think it's fairly common. With
  all you experts, I doubt it should be too hard to locate. Thanks!

    recognised the Arthur Baker signature curves, so I whipped up his list and found
    it that way. Quite a few of them look very similar."
