body: This is a paint decal from a 60's vintage Alfa Romeo.  I can't seem to find
  a font that includes all the variables here, such as the arch top A's, the square
  O in Milano, and the numbers 3,4,7, and 9.  Any help would be appreciated.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Transformed_Italver2_4495.JPG]
