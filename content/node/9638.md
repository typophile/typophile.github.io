  what option three is but it looks good to me.  <BR> <BR>1 - shift  &#34; <BR> <BR>2
  - shift / otion / [     <BR> <BR>3 - shift / option / g     <BR> <BR>What is the

  body: Yeah, a screen shot of those three characters would help, Gerry, but &#40;going
    out on a limb&#41; chances are that your option 1 is an inch mark &#40;or &#34;double
    prime&#34;&#41;; 2 is a typographic &#40;or curly&#41; quote; and 3 is a Hungarian
    umlaut. Hungarian umlauts aren&#39;t inch marks, and they&#39;re not that common.
    E.g., the &#34;umlaut&#34; in the mathematician Paul Erd&#246;s&#39; name should
    be a Hungarian umlaut.  <BR> <BR>Don&#39;t quote me, though. All this is <i>assuming</i>
    that you&#39;re running a Mac, and your font is based on the standard MacOS Roman
    codepage.

  body: Option 3 is indeed the inch mark you&#39;re looking for. Shift-option-e is
    the corresponding foot mark.

  body: Are you sure Dave? I&#39;m certainly no expert, but I&#39;m pretty certain
    that proper inch and foot marks are supposed to be vertical, not slanted. Someone
    please correct me if that&#39;s wrong. Cheers.

  body: Cheshire, most typographers will disagree with you.  <BR> <BR>Option 1 is
    the double prime, also known as dumb quote, and is the proper mark for inches.  <BR>
    <BR>Option 2 is the typographic quotation mark -- or &#34;curly&#34; or &#34;smart&#34;
    quote &#40;as styled for Frutiger, not very curly, I grant you&#41;.  <BR> <BR>Option
    3 is the hungarian umlaut, an accent mark. &#40;Bringhurst prefers to call it
    double acute or long umlaut, as the Hungarian language also includes traditional
    umlauts.&#41; Your corresponding shift-option-e on the Mac yields the acute accent
    mark. <BR> <BR>Prime marks are usually vertical, but you will also find an occasional
    design which features slightly sloped primes. When they are, they look very similar
    to Frutiger&#39;s quotation mark. <BR> <BR>You can refer to Bringhurst&#39;s Appendix
    A for more description of each of these. &#40;The Elements of Typographic Style

  body: I had noticed that, too, but I checked other rules that had an <i>or</i> option,
    and in those cases, the <i>or</i> was in italics but the alternate option wasn&#39;t,
    so my guess was that the slanted primes really were slanted, not just italicized
    in that instance.

  body: 'I know I&#39;m coming late to the party here, but I&#39;ll just weigh in
    with what I know, and what I see around. <BR> <BR>While the glyph in most sans
    serif fonts is nothing but a pair of boxes, the correct mark to indicate inches
    is &#34;, the double prime. The prime is used for feet. <BR> <BR>The &#39;Hungarian
    Umlaut&#39; accent, as it is known to users of Fontographer and FontLab - that&#39;s
    likely the accent&#39;s official ISO name - is composed of two acute accents arranged
    close together, with an umlaut-like proximity. This is not a double prime, and
    the acute accent is not a prime. <BR> <BR>Close-quotation marks &#40;single and
    double&#41; are likewise not primes, and should not be used to indicate feet and
    inches, although your page layout software has a preference for &#39;Typographer&#39;s
    Quotes&#39; which will replace errant primes and double primes for their correct
    quotation mark. You can turn this function off in order to insert correct primes
    and double primes, but watch out that your apostrophes and  quotes don&#39;t revert
    to the &#39;email&#39; state of primes and double primes. &#40;For example, I
    have been using primes and double primes to indicate quotation marks, since this
    is HTML / ASCII text, and quotation marks are not supported.&#41; <BR> <BR>Every
    font&#39;s accents, prime marks, and quotation marks have been designed by the
    type designer, and so should be used where they should, even if an acute accent
    or close-quotation looks good. After all; what if you change your mind and your
    font at the last minute? You will end up with surprises... <BR> <BR>I don&#39;t
    have Frutiger loaded on my machine at the moment, but have made a little image
    showing the differences between the various glyph&#39;s in Adrian Frutiger&#39;s
    Univers font, and in my own ApexSans font. And I threw in the comma as well for
    further comparison: in some fonts, the comma and quotation marks are identical,
    in others they are not. <BR> <BR>Hope this helps somewhat. <BR>Best, <BR>c <BR>

  body: So should I take the CMOS rule to mean that they think inch and foot marks
    should be italicized primes rather than the accents? That doesn&#39;t really make
    sense to me, as I don&#39;t think that any other symbols are normally italicized
    when used with roman text, but I&#39;m willing to be swayed. <BR> <BR>I think
    the CMOS rule is meant, as most CMOS rules are, to avoid misunderstanding. The
    CMOS rule may stem from an era in which newspaper writers sent in typewritten
    stories wherein they didn&#39;t have the luxury of curly quotes, hence the opportunity
    for quotation-mark/inch-mark confusion. Thus, the CMOS rule may be outdated.

  body: 'Cheshire, your examination was more thorough than mine. I did not look on
    to observe that the <i>or</i> is not usually followed with italic.  <BR> <BR>Still,
    I find it hard to comprehend that the CMOS would dictate either accent marks or
    italicized primes over plain ol&#39; font-specific, designer-designed primes.  <BR>
    <BR>I don&#39;t have my copy with me now to try to find any other evidence to
    support my unswayed conviction that the slantedness of the primes in CMOS is not
    intended to be prescriptive. I have no further explanation. <BR> <BR>For those
    who may not be aware: in Quark on the Mac you can type prime marks without turning
    off the &#34;smart quotes&#34; preference by using the control key to override
    the substitution -- control-&#39; gives the single prime, control-shift-&#39;
    gives the double prime. <BR> <BR>-- K. <BR> <BR>'

  body: 'I guess it didn&#39;t seem unnatural to me to use accents for another purpose,
    as there are other symbols that do multiple duties as well: the tilde is used
    in Spanish or Portuguese in conjunction with other letters, but it&#39;s also
    used in English to symbolize &#34;approximately&#34;; the asterisk is used both
    as a footnoting device as well as a mathematical symbol; and the pi and delta
    symbols are used in mathematics but are also used as shorthand in the legal sphere
    to denote &#34;plaintiff&#34; and &#34;defendant.&#34; Though the marks in question
    here were primarily accents for languages other than English, I don&#39;t see
    a problem with reassigning them for use in the English language as marks to represent
    something else. Note also that the slanted primes &#40;which I&#39;ve always referred
    to as &#34;hash marks,&#34; by the way&#41; are also used to denote minutes and
    seconds, as mentioned <a href="http://www.fontsite.com/Pages/RulesOfType/ROT1097.html">here</a>.
    <BR> <BR>I would be interested to know the development of the primes in the first
    place. '

  body: 'Well argued, Cheshire. But going back to the original question: what is the
    correct way to show the inch mark? I maintain that it is the font&#39;s proper
    primes.  <BR> <BR>An aesthetic decision to press accents into service in the place
    of primes is a slightly different matter. I will confess that I don&#39;t care
    for the clunky design of the Frutiger primes &#40;most primes for that matter&#41;,
    but that doesn&#39;t change the fact that they are still the proper primes for
    the face. The long umlaut as double prime just looks strange to my eyes, at least
    in the Frutiger. Perhaps in another typeface, they could pass. <BR> <BR>I know
    that the prime mark is used in mathematics to distinguish . . . actually, I&#39;m
    not sure I can articulate just what it distinguishes -- two similar, but distinct
    entities? Something like that. I wonder if the use for inches and feet, or seconds
    and minutes, derives originally from a mathematical function. <BR> <BR>BTW, I&#39;ve
    always thought of the number sign, or octothorp, as the &#34;hash mark.&#34; <BR>

  body: 'I was going to make my hash-mark comment yesterday, but it suddenly occurred
    to me that I was no longer sure that was accurate, because writing it down for
    the first time &#40;as opposed to saying it, which I&#39;ve done for years&#41;,
    the word <i>hash</i> suddenly looked suspicious, as though it really deserved
    to belong to the octothorpe &#40;or, as I&#39;ve always referred to it, the &#34;pound
    sign&#34;&#41;. Then when I found the page I referenced above, it confirmed my
    original thought. Now that I&#39;ve done some more searching, I think consensus
    runs toward hash-mark-as-octothorpe, which of course makes more sense. Still,
    there are apparently a lot of people like me who have been running around pell-mell
    calling quotation marks &#34;hash marks.&#34; Well, I&#39;m stopping such nonsense
    right now. <BR> <BR>Anyway, back to the original topic: I guess we will agree
    to disagree. On simply aesthetic terms, I think that the long umlaut tends to
    look better in serif faces, a more elegant mark compared to the short wedges found,
    for example, in Helvetica and Futura. <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/30/6760.gif"
