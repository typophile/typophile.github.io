  body: These are definitely Helvetica bold shapes, but there being so many different
    versions of Helvetica and its derivatives I'm having trouble finding an exact
    match. Maybe it is Nimbus Sans L Bold with some Illustrator-type outlining in
    black.

  body: I think I might have been looking at the wrong picture sample, a photo of
    a sign saying "Georgia" in outlined letters. Now when I click the link again I
    see a simple black-and-white sample of "could", which does look like FS Albert.
    Maybe it was some cache problem. Sorry for the confusion.
