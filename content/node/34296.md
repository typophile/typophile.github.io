  Bulgarian painter, with later interest in typography. Works in collaboration with
  Georgi Kovachov, also involved in the same fields.\r\n\r\n<cite>\"...Book covers,
  stamps and postcards which they designed introduce a number of new values to the
  domain of graphic design.\r\n\r\nAt the competition for new typefaces of Cyrillic
  alphabet characters, launched in Bulgaria in 1960-61, Milka Pejkova and Georgi Kovachov
  received second prize for their design of a grotesque print script. While studying
  \ the features of old Bulgarian letters, Pejkova discovered its specific architectonics
  and its glyph rhythm. She began to create artistic letter signs. At the beginning
  she continued in the tradition of the Cyrillic alphabet and then, inspired by tradition,
  she began to create original letter images, composed with considerable fantasy...\u201D
