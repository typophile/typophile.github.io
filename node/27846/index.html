  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>So, after spending almost my entire evening, figuring out what was wrong with uploading my .pdf file on Typophile I finally decided to make a screen capture (i can’t believe how slow I can be sometimes…lol) so this is only 2 slighly different versions of the new design of my business cards…</p>
<p>And here is my first post :
“Guys, you made my day (refering to the Kursivschrift discussion in the tatoo icon topic <a href="http://typophile.com/node/27828)">http://typophile.com/node/27828)</a>!
I finally decided to purchase Kursivschrift from Linotype and I am very (very) happy about it.
Now, may I ask for your comments about this new business card of mine, I’m still hesitating between the different “versions”. It is going to be offset printed on transparent Cromatico™ paper.
Thanks in advance.
(I was also thinking to use Digital Kauno’s “@”)”</p>
<p>PS : The other versions I wanted to show you at the begining were not very different from these 2, only “DESIGN CARE” and my eMail address were either white on one or 50% yellow on the other. Well, anyway, let me know what you think… Thanxxx</p>

Te ornament is too clip art, is it adobe wood type? there&rsquo;s a cafe here in oslo, right around the corner that has exactly the same ornament. I think the photograph, the &ldquo;me&rdquo;/&ldquo;my website&rdquo; and the ornament are competing, not complementing each other. kill some darlings, and reenliven them for a project where they are useful.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Hey thank you Alex for your comments.
About the logotype : well, it&rsquo;s been my visual identity for 4 years now and I wasn&rsquo;t really considering changing it right now (I need my new business cards for a convention next week&hellip;) but you&rsquo;re absolutdely right about the ornament, it is based on an Adobe Wood Type one and I know that&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s not so classy nore original anymore but I&rsquo;m still very fond of it (I can get very emtional ;-))&hellip; I was wondering more about the layout of the bCard rather than the logotype itself. I am going to post the other color versions in an hour or so. I like better the first version too and I&rsquo;m just wondering about the arobase&hellip;
Anyway, other critics are welcome.</p>
<p>PS : At the begining Dr Duckling was the name of a (successful) graphic project that I did (print, web, tees) about taking CARE of the environment (nature heath care&hellip;) and I just kept it when I started my freelance activity as it felt right to&hellip;</p>

		<div class="commentbody">This may be because we haven&rsquo;t seen the comps in colour, but to my mind the design feels messy: the out-of-focus-and-cropped image, the quirky font used for the logotype and address, the skewed and jumbled glyphs, the scribbled notes, the arrangement and proximity/distance of the text elements. You might be shooting for quirky, but really it just seems messy to me. The thing with self-promo projects is that like attracts like, so a messy design will likely attract clients who are also messy, and those kinds of clients are nothing but headache (and usually cheap as well).</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Another way to translate the word messy, IMHO, would be no underlying structure. Even when David Carson was at his RayGun peek, there always seemed to be some sort of underlying structure. Business card design is a sticky-wicket. Very little space and if you choose to be assymetrical or random the lack of balance is exaggerated.</div>

<p>IMHO, the blurred background photo creates a hectic, hurried mood and the feeling that there is no underlying structure in the general layout heightens the sense of confusion.</p>

		<div class="commentbody">Well, guys, I have to say that I completely disagree with you.
First of all, yes I am a big fan of David Carson&rsquo;s work (among others&hellip;), and find particularly inspirational his compposition &ldquo;science&rdquo; and sensibility.
I have designed this business card working with ,well, certainly my own sensibility, finding this (maybe fragile) equilibrium, this warm feeling and humanist &ldquo;imperfection&rdquo; sense. And I was pretty happy with what came out of my research&hellip; Opposed to my usual alignment obsession which always kinda lead me to some sort of frustration. I just wanted to play with space and typefaces and basically with the whole thing&hellip; and had fun with this job. Although, you haven&rsquo;t seen the final touches&hellip;
But please show me what you think is a &ldquo;structured&rdquo; business card (opposed to my supposely unstructured/unbalanced one&hellip;)! I would really appreciate that&hellip;
And sorry, for my english, I hope I make myself understood.</div>

<p>I hope it is ok but I took the liberty of messy around a bit. I think the key is to find an anchor point, no matter how random, and work from there.</p>

<p>Thank you guys for your posts, I didn&rsquo;t felt offended, don&rsquo;t worry&hellip;
I&rsquo;ve just been a little touchy recently (lack of sleep I guess)&hellip;
I mean, I asked for your critics and this is what I get : critics&hellip;
So let&rsquo;s just say that I&rsquo;m a bit masochist sometimes!
Miss Tiffany, I like what you did with my bCard, I understand what you mean, but I thought that betting on the &ldquo;fer centré&rdquo; (visual vertical center, does that make any english sense?) would still give some kind of structure to the lay-out, my only problem with your lay-out is that &ldquo;design care&rdquo; is a part of my logotype and is usually aligned with the vertical axe of the second D, I also placed my eMail address aligned vertically with the end of design care and the &ldquo;arrow&rdquo; on top of the ornament and try to balance space around those block&hellip;</p>
<p>Anyway, I&rsquo;m gonna post my last touch-ups in a few hours (after sleeping&hellip;) and will also make new ones thinking of what yall have been suggesting or making critics about.</p>
<p>One more thing&hellip; I posted another thread the other day, proposing that everyone post his own business card, to have a little gallery of how graphic designers / typographes, etc introduce themselves nowadays&hellip; Would you like to participate? That would be fantastic!</p>

Do you mean : am I printing on brightly colored Cromatico™ Paper or am will I be using colors in the design?

		<div class="commentbody">Sorry Timd, my english isn&rsquo;t so good. I didn&rsquo;t understand the &ldquo;shifted up to centre&rdquo; part&hellip;
Also, what do you mean by &ldquo;When you are printing these are you using one of the bright colours?&rdquo;? Do you mean : am I printing on brightly colored Cromatico™ Paper or am will I be using colors in the design? I&rsquo;m probably going to print it on Curious Translucent Clear 285 grammes, both sides (only the picture will be printed on both sides) with the side (tranche) of the business card &ldquo;inked&rdquo; in black, (does this sentence make sense in english?)</div>

<p>About the printing I was wondering if the paper was going to be translucent and coloured but I see the weight of the coloured is limited to 100gsm. Your sentence makes sense if tranche is the edge of the card, but no need to apologise for your English it&rsquo;s better than my French:)</p>

		<div class="commentbody">ok, now I perfectly understand what you mean! Thank you.
Yes Cromatico™ colored papers stops at 200 grammes actually, which I personaly find not being enough for a business card. I&rsquo;ll receive other see-through paper samples from Antalis (<a href="http://www.antalis.com">http://www.antalis.com</a>) next week including a polyprene &ldquo;paper&rdquo; (which is actually not paper but plastic that I can make &ldquo;sérigraphié&rdquo; (what&rsquo;s the word in english?) or UV printed or golden (all those golden/silver/metallic, etc. heaten ink - please tell me the word in english for all these printing technics, I feel dumb&hellip;). Anyway this paper is called Priplak™ Super Crystal and seems interesting too.
PS : I think &ldquo;tranche&rdquo; is edge yes&hellip;</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>sérigraphié = screenprinting</p>
<p>I think the heating process is thermography (where the type is raised up by melting a plastic powder).</p>
<p>Some of these translucents (and I don&rsquo;t have huge experience with them) are prone to curling.
