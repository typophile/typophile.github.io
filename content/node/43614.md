    Mr. Rugen is a very pleasant, intelligent fellow whose <a href="http://currentconfig.com/">blog</a>
    is an undiscovered gem for designers and thinkers.

  body: Happy Birthday. Looking forward to meeting lots of people in Buffalo this
    year myself, and I don't think there are any guns allowed at the convention at
    all. We should be safe from everything but the rim shots that follow Mr. Lozos'
    puns.

  body: " Thanks so much for the kind birthday wishes, guys! I practically forgot
    my own birthday this year, as we've got our new little one in the family.\r\n\r\nIf
    anyone's wondering \"Who the heck is Chris?\" I should be in Buffalo this year
    for TypeCon (had to miss last year). Perhaps I'll print myself a t-shirt with
    my avatar on it, as I'm a little gun-shy at conventions. Always happy to meet
    the folks 'behind the Georgia' here on Typophile.\r\n\r\nAnd this year, I'll try
    to be <em>punkt</em>ual.\r\n\r\n::har har::\r\n\r\n(That was for you, Chris L.)"

    Oh yeah, and happy B-day too!
