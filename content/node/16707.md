body: "i'm another one of those City College of San Francisco type design students
  who have been posting on the forum. this too is my first typeface. it's also my
  first time postingon Typophile.\r\nthis is a work in progress, originally inspired
  by type styles from the 50s and 60s...but it seems to have evolved into something
  more personal, which is okay but unexpected. it definitely still needs work on the
  spacing so i'm well aware of that. some of letterforms need to be tweaked and adjusted
  as well. also, there's actually *more* consistency in the letters currently than
  i was originally shooting for and now i'm thinking about loosening it up a little.\r\nso
  i would love some feedback from people on anything about this typeface.\r\n\r\nthanks.

    lacks ''m''ness. The verticals in P & several other letters seem overly thin where
    your O is quite a bit thicker. This face has the quality of a doodle - so it feels
    really casual. Thats fine but I think it would be nicer & more versitale with
    a little more consistancy of stroke. I agree you can loosen it up but not randomly.
    It should be done to create distictiveness between letters and to help you recognize
    letters. Your numbers have this quality. They have more vivacity and are easier
    to recognize than your letters. If you can get more of the number feeling into
    the letters they will get better. '

  body: Very lively and fun. I disagree with Eben about the m, but in the capitals
    there is definitely a weight discrepancy between the straights and the rounds.
    And your capital M stands out as rather uptight; loosen it up and get it to join
    the party. I think your asterisk ought to be wilder too; try it with five or six
    of those slightly bifurcated triangular terminals instead of the rounded.

  body: "thank you all for your feedback, much appreciated. i definitely agree with
    the comments about inconsistency (and the uptight M) and will be working on that
    some more. i don't think that i want all of the letters sitting neatly on the
    baseline. that's part of what i meant when i said i wanted to loosen it up. i
    just need to think about how to approach that. my intention has been to design
    a really playful font. so i'm trying to find a balance between that and a sense
    of order and consistency for a useable design.\r\n\r\njill"

  body: i have been looking at other fonts and Fontesque is actually a favorite of
    mine. i wasn't familiar with Shinn's website though so thanks for the link. i've
    looked at P22 and Font Diner fonts as well. as this is my first font, i'm a little
    overwhelmed by all the details that are involved in designing one. i'm always
    struggling between developing and expressing the essence of the indivual letterforms
    and working within the constraints of having to establish and maintain a consistently
    through the whole alphabet. the process is really interesting.

  body: Are you designing the glyphs individially or in the context of other letters?
    In the first case you might design them abcdefg in the second case you would put
    the a in words & design the word with special interest in the a like 'bat' 'vat'
    'saavy' 'maintain'. I suggest that you re-rough your ideas in the context of words
    - the second route. It is as important to design the white spaces between words
    as it is to design the black. By designing in the context of words you will see
    the consequence of your design descisions and realize that you are really designing
    words - but in parts.

  body: "This is worth doing.\r\n\r\nThe one thing I would recommend is to consider
    the funky weight distribution very precisely, by taking into account frequent
    letter adjacencies in actual text. In fact as a general rule the more irregular
    a design the more it should worry about linguistic data. See for example the development
    of Excoffon's Mistral, where the vertical position of glyphs was determined through
    the analysis of French.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
