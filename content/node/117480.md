  body: No repeating letters (to confirm this is a font) and the overall style looks
    like handwriting - not a font.

    body: "Hi, and thanks for your response. It does have repeating characters which
      are identical \u2014 it's just that I edited out any repeating glyphs when I
      uploaded the sample to WhatTheFont. I'm sure it is in fact a font, though it
      could well be a digitised handwriting font from a collection or app install."

    all).

  body: "I spent a lot of time searching for this. I searched Dafont and AbstractFonts
    - no luck. None of the usual ID tools came even close, and keyword searches at
    MyFonts came up with some similar ones, but no matches. Similar, but not quite
    as random-looking: [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/t26/paquita-pro/?refby=bowfin|Paquita]];
    [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/hipopotam/mrs-ant/?refby=bowfin|Mrs Ant]]; and
    [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/tart-workshop/bookeyed-martin/?refby=bowfin|Bookeyed
    Martin]].\r\n\r\nMy guess is that this may be a custom made font, which anyone
    with no lettering skill and about $10 could create.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
