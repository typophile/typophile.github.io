<div class=commentbody>It will have Roman, Italic, Small Caps, Bold & Display cuts. All will have nice OT character sets, the language support that we all like to have and pretty little ligatures to spice things up a tad. So nothing too large, it is only my first one, and I don't want to go overboard. Keep it manageable, y'know?

<div class=commentbody>Kia Ora, Kris. Every time I think of New Zealand I think of racing yachts - those amazing "Kiwis" in that famous Defender's Cup black boat, Black Magic, NZL 32. Undefeated in competition. I always found that sport fascinating. I have a bit of education in that area: White Sail 3 certification. Nothing stellar, but give me a bathtub with a sail and I think I can make it to shore alright.
Anyway, I see that Feijoa is nearly complete - 91%, apparently. I eagerly await this gem. Are there any sample pdfs to tide us over until the release? </div>

<div class=commentbody>That lowercase "b" is quite an achievement. Very nice touch. And the i-n ligature is interesting. I think you pulled that off rather well. One doesn't see that sort of ligature very often.

<div class=commentbody>Kris,
I love this, and I eagerly anticipate its release. For that matter I'm dying for Salamanca, and Zinc looks worth focusing on as well. I know it's a juggle.
Please consider making all these ligatures available only on a discretionary basis. Some of them seem frankly gratuitous, and they would very much hinder extended reading. Especially in languages where lots of accents are present, they could really distract.
In that context, I do not think the unjoined b or q will be strong enough. Is there a reason not to join them, considering all the other shapes? They jar me. The serif version of Salamanca (it is coming, yes?...) might be the place for such experiments. Otherwise this has such nice color and a comfortable feel for reading. Don't stop!</div>

<div class=commentbody>Yo,
These are totally going to be discretionary & stylistic ligs—I was trying out uncommon combinations, and it seems to be working. Don't actually know if people will use them ,but it amuses me nevertheless! Only a madman would put them in as defaults. There is a very good reason for the b & q: I like it like that. Perhaps I could include joined versions as calts…

Nope, just looking at the visual scratchiness those areas create, which I think interrupts the smooth and comfortable feel elsewhere. They remind me of letterpress type with scratches and nicks.

<div class=commentbody>Carl, it's more accurate to say that I always go on about <cite><strong>trying</strong> to tame oneself</cite> ; and adding that I also always go on about the limits (not least in terms of benefits to the reader) of formal aesthetic control.

<div class=commentbody>Carl, I share your concern, but I don't experience the visual interruption you do.

<div class=commentbody>William,
I think Fedra Serif is a suitable environment for the variations that you mention, considering the other gaps, stub terminals, angles, and general eclecticism there. The b fits, in other words. In the sans, I do not think it fits.
Kris may have more to say about this, since we only exchanged quips, but the reason he cited ("I like it like that") sounds to me like he is attached to those gaps for no functional reason, and has not tried eliminating them yet. It might be that adding more gaps would somehow make these 2 fit. They could be all over: 4 6 8 9 0 A B D H K P Q R U a d e g k p, and that would change the design a lot. but given the way the design is working now (and it is working beautifully) they don't fit; they are the lone elements that interrupt the flow of reading in such an otherwise subtle and pleasing typeface; the soft bracketing, rich color, fluid curves, excellent spacing, and the other bowls which resolve differently all work on such a different, more subliminal level, that by contrast these 2 gaps look affected and showy. I invite Kris to try:
Put more unjoined bowls in the design throughout (though leave i-ligatures off while testing),
or
close these 2, and examine dispassionately whether anything of value is lost, or if something else happens. Is it really important they be there; do they contribute anything?
or
Turn the unjoined strokes in more, to match the flow of the strokes in the bowls of d and p.
Kris' design has so many strengths, and one way for typefaces to be resolved fully is for the designer to try many things, letting go of favorite elements, and as someone else put it here recently, let it become itself. Because of the many unnecessary (confusing? gratuitous?) i-ligatures, and because of Kris' stated reason for keeping these cuts, I had to at least suggest he try losing them. </div>

<div class=commentbody>For me, showy ligatures look horribly out of place and distracting within text. So, Carl, I share your distaste for Kris' i ligatures, at least in the sample usage. But since they are discressionary, I don't think it matters.
Your observation on Fedra sans vs serif is interesting. Bil'ak did a 'Fedra sans alt' replacing the more unusual characters, including the open b. I wonder if that was partly a response to requests from customers--which would tend to confirm your view. </div>

While I am no way near a typograher, and I understand that the overuse of ligatures can distort readability, I still find these visually charming.

Of course I haven't tried eliminating them, I see absolutely no problem with them. I read text set in type that has similar forms without trouble, I read text set in Feijoa without trouble! If they upset you then that is a shame. At this stage I am not going to change it. If there is overwhelming feedback that supports your concern, then I will consider changing the forms.
"The designer has to try many things, letting go of favourite elements."
I have tried many things, I have let go of favourite elements. But erasing every little quirk or detail I like that may not be deemed purely functional will render the typeface dull & overworked. I have already spent far too long on this already. I cannot help that I want parts of me in there, parts that I like, for designing type gives me great pleasure. I cannot work dispassionately, that would kill the buzz, especially when it is an uncommissioned typeface.
I suppose the function in these forms is to give me pleasure.
"Who would say that pleasure is not useful?"
—Charles Eames.
This is an interesting discussion. Here are some other forms that are 'unjoined':

<div class=commentbody>Kris, stick to your guns with this one. It is a fine face as is and needs to be out on the market. The world needs more type that pushes the envelope. We have plenty of classic go-by-the-rules broadly accepted faces out there already. It is one thing to respect the classic successes of the past; it is another to cringe in awe and fear of them. Make your own fonts; make your own pleasure. Be who you are proudly.
There are some people who only like their old sweater because they know from years of wear that it suits them and makes them comfy. There are plenty of other folks who would just love to have a new sweater to try on, break in, and grow to feel comfy in as well.

Agreed 100%. But some envelopes are better than others.
For a text face, a proper grasp and valuation of reading is
much more useful (or at least less banal) than that of style.

I think that among highly readable faces there is still room for variation in style. One can really only judge readability in the intended final use of the face, such as print or screen. But to me it looks like the open elements in Feijoa are no obstacle to readability and are pleasing stylistic features.
If I thought they compromised readability, as Carl thinks, I would say that they should be cut--or filled!--but they look fine to me. And Kris has a gift for beautiful letters, in evidence here, which is a great plus.</div>

This is backwards.

No, one can only judge readability via an indirect but firm understanding
of how humans read; because it relies so fundametally on the subconscious.

But Oliver, that's not the only design of mine, nor is it mine originally. I get credit for it, and for Adobe's woodtype 3 package, because I finished them, not because I originated them. Be careful going down that path, Oliver. On typophile, where people might seem anonymous, it's a minefield. For instance, which are your typefaces?.....
Chris, and Kris: Hrant is catching something I think you both missed: I'm not in any way critiquing the style of Feijoa. This design, along with Kris' other designs, absolutely sing with style, inventiveness and freshness. Honestly? Kris is one of my favorite new typeface designers. But here, where Kris has stated an intention to design a text face, style is of secondary importance: ALL my comments refer to the function, the performance of it in running text. The style of Feijoa would not be harmed by my suggestions. I'm making these comments, not out of cowering fear of breaking convention, but to ensure that the style of it is not marred by a flaw in structure.
Despite all this, It sounds like nobody else is having this issue, so maybe it will not be a problem after all. I also realize it was earlier this year, on a different thread, when Kris solicited free commentary, that I should have pointed this out. Apologies, Kris, for throwing a wrench in at the last minute. Carry on, and I will welcome Feijoa along with multitudes of others, I am sure. As I've said, this design has some qualities that are very rare and very desireable. Rich color, deep warmth, and sprightly proportions. Good luck when you get to the Village!</div>

<div class=commentbody>Great name, nice touch with the allusion to the fruit. And as to the font itself, what I'm seeing on your site now (the little passage about Siddhartha, most revered teacher), looks absolutely beautiful. It might perform slightly differently on paper, but just go with your gut on this one.
The more you second-guess yourself and over-tweak things, the more it will be to the font's detriment in the end. </div>

<div class=commentbody>Hi Paul,
Chester is working on the final font files at the moment. With any luck it should be out shortly, hopefully before Christmas! At last…
I also closed up the b & q after seeing it set in offset! So there you go, Carl, hopefully that will keep you happy!
