  body: Well, traditionally, serif typefaces have a lowercase t that is "spiked",
    and so sans-serif faces may, to a varying extent, preserve some of the traditional
    features of serif typefaces.

  body: "And the cut makes its shape more unique, i. e. more distinguishable.\r\nBest
    example is Univers, where all terminals are cut either horizontally or vertically."

    looks like?

  body: Is it correct to say that the slanted is termed grotesque and the flat terminal
    neo-grotesque (or am I oversimplifying)?

  body: The slant is one of the ways we can differentiate between i j t l f r and
    the like.  Think of its use (or lack there of) as part of a larger system that
    must sensibly create glyphs appearing as a family, adjoining harmoniously with
    neighbors, yet retaining a sufficient self image to not be confused with a cousin.  With
    sans serif, the historic slant of the pen is less important than shapes that fit
    and play nice together. It isn't a case of either always or never use the slant
    but a case of use it well and sensibly when you do.

  body: f and t design one another. When designing a font, there's always some back
    and forth play between which affects both forms. Lots of letters affect one another
    but ft and gy are special pairs with powerful relationships. Heavy, man.
