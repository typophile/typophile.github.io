It was two opinions:</p>

<li>
<p>Legibility should base on the ability to small differences between characters. The more equal the more difficult to read.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Even the smallest differences in the details &ldquo;separates&rdquo; letter from the word, draws attention to it and thus slowing reading.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I think it is about achieving a balance. The letters of a writing system should be ‘of one stock’, e.g. shaped out of some common ground pattern /model in order to form a unit. But the single parts need to be sufficiently different on the other hand, to make them distinguishable enough and avoid confusion. Both issues will distract the reader’s eye from comfortable recognition: too much similarity, and too much diversity.</p>
<p>I once found the thorough study of Bembo quite enlightening about those questions.</p>

		<div class="commentbody">I give you my opinion as a reader, as I am not working in this industry. I find a too “reductionistic” font bland in a way that the letter or words actually “blur” more. It is harder for me to read. On the other hand a font which is skillfully crafted but too fancy might seem inappropriate for the context, but was never hard to read for me. As far as I know we do not identify single letters after each other but word shapes or syllable shapes and so I think adding more character to the individual letters will help to distinct syllables and words from each other, and will not distract. This is because (afaik) we do not pay too much attention to the individual letter, but to groups of letters. 
This is based on my reading experience with serif fonts. With sans I find this question harder to answer. Do humanistic models have more diversity of letter shapes compared to geometric sans faces? Or do they follow different principles?</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Based on my own work and on the work I rediscovered of Matthew Luckiesh, I think that differentiation is important up to a threshold, but beyond that other factors become more important. For example, serifs help by differentiating the extremes of letters, which seem according to research to be more salient in recognizing letters. But beyond a threshold further differentiation of letters becomes &lsquo;noise&rsquo;, and doesn&rsquo;t help and can be distracting.  Above the threshold of adequate differentiation of individual letters, more important are issues of weight and rhythm of the characters and of the spacing.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>It&rsquo;s always nice to see a discussion where the opposition
of legibility and readability is discussed. It seems like a
paradox, but I&rsquo;ve believed in the difference between the
two for a while now. In terms of visualizing how they
relate, I find it useful to refer to geometry: imagine two
vectors at a right angle, so separated by 90 degrees. So
they&rsquo;re both pointing towards the same &ldquo;quadrant&rdquo; but
they also oppose each other to an important extent,
and the balance one needs to find depends on how far
one wants to push into immersive reading; the further
you push into it the more letters need to contribute to
divergent boumas, as opposed to merely being divergent
on their own.</p>
<p>So for example sans letterforms are easier to identify,
but serif forms &ldquo;talk to each other&rdquo; better, essentially
becoming less themselves. And if you look at Legato
for example, the whites of the letters talk to each other
instead of with their own blacks, creating what I see
as much stronger bouma bonding.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also important to realize that it&rsquo;s quite trivial to ensure
legibility: people can read almost any letterform if given
enough time. And this is where the expressive dimension
of type (think of display type) nicely comes in. This doesn&rsquo;t
mean text fonts can&rsquo;t be expressive, it&rsquo;s that they express
themselves more at the level of overall texture.</p>
<p>BTW, here&rsquo;s something light I once put together:

How much divergence is too much? To me this answer is simpler

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Can anyone point to empirical evidence that making letters less individually recognisable ever results in improved word recognition? Or vice versa? Or that making either letters or words less recognisable ever decreases reading fatigue? [Word recognition and comfort over time seem to me the cornerstones of any measurable notion of readability.]</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think there is an opposition between legibility and readability <em>if</em> one assumes spatial frequency and stylistic harmony, which is a general assumption of type design and typography: we don&rsquo;t make or use &lsquo;ransom note&rsquo; typefaces for reading, we make and use types which operate within single spatial frequency channels and that share stylistic features that allow the necessarily individuated forms of letters to be grouped without individual letters standing out. In order for legibility to be even independent of readability &ndash; never mind &lsquo;in opposition&rsquo; &ndash;, one first needs to throw out the spatial frequency and stylistic harmony, hence disrupting word recognition. In other words you need to throw out typography.</p>
<p>Hrant: <em>So for example sans letterforms are easier to identify, but serif forms &ldquo;talk to each other&rdquo; better, essentially becoming less themselves. And if you look at Legato for example, the whites of the letters talk to each other instead of with their own blacks, creating what I see as much stronger bouma bonding.</em></p>
<p>Less themselves? That would imply that the letters that &lsquo;talk to each other better&rsquo; &ndash; and I agree that this is one of the virtues of Legato &ndash; are less individually recognisable than letters that talk less well to each other and are, by your logic, more themselves. This makes absolutely no sense to me whatsoever. There is no opposition, there is no zero sum game in which working well to form recognisable words &ndash; or &lsquo;stronger bouma bonding&rsquo; if you insist &ndash; requires the individual letters to be less legible. There is no reason at all why better recognisability of individual letters and better recognisability of words do not go hand-in-hand.</p>

Legibility vs. readability is not a discussion worth having in general or theoretical terms, it only makes sense when applied to the instance.
One might just as well say strength vs. weight, with regard to cars or wine glasses.
It’s the designer’s task to optimize both, within the speciﬁc constraints of a product.</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>John,  your question about legibility raises the question of what &lsquo;legibility&rsquo; means. Luckiesh wanted to avoid the term because he thought is was too unclear. Tinker used it to refer basically to reading speed. Lieberman defines it (following some work in the &rsquo;60s) as ease of distinguishing individual letters. That could be tested by minimum time threshold for recognition of letters with accuracy to a specified level. Or you might mean something tested by a contrast threshold. There is also the question of what distance you can recognize a character. These might not all be the same.</p>
<p>Then speed of individual letter recognition and word recognition might be not totally go together, because of issue of coherence and spacing and rhythm in the font. And comfort in reading lengthy text is yet again a different question.</p>
<p>Above I wrote about differentiation of letters, rather than legibility, but I suspect that also legibility of individual letters affects readability up to a threshold, and then other factors dominate.</p>

<p>The differences between individual letters that people expect to find in order to distinguish them need to be readily visible. This is why, for example, learning to read Hebrew would be more difficult than learning to read Armenian - some letters have very tiny differences.</p>
<p>But any irrelevant differences are distracting. If the descenders are of different lengths on a p and a q, since descender length isn&rsquo;t one of the expected distinctions between the two letters, this difference will only be a distraction.</p>

<p>Oh, absolutely good recognisability of individual letters cannot compensate for bad typography. But as I said, typography presumes a lot of stuff that naturally bring letter recognition and word recognition into alignment: spatial frequency and stylistic harmony (coherence) and, of course, spacing and &ndash; duck, Hrant &ndash; ryhthm. The latter so much presumed that I didn&rsquo;t even mention them.</p>
<p>Yes, if you isolate and any of these normal features of text typography &ndash; if you change font weights suddenly in the middle of a word, or mix serif and sans serif letters in a word, or track out the spacing so that the letters don&rsquo;t knit together, or vary the spacing or widths of individual letters so as to break up the rhythm &ndash; then word recognition will fail long before individual letter recognition fails. But then we&rsquo;re not talking about typography any more.</p>

<p>As has been hinted at, there is empirical evidence that individual letters are recognized more accurately in time and distance threshold tasks when there is a more space between letters, but that reading speed is faster when there is less space between letters (but more between words).</p>
<p>In most cases I believe that faster and more accurate letter recognition will lead to faster and more accurate word recognition.</p>

		<div class="commentbody">Kevin, to clarify, when I referred to &lsquo;making letters less individually recognisable&rsquo;, I meant making their design less individually recognisable, not altering their setting. It makes sense that individual letters are quicker to recognise without crowding but that words composed of those letters are quicker to recognise when the letters are closer together and the words clearly spaced. But that is about the setting of the letters, not their individual recognisability. What I am suggesting  is that letters that are difficult to recognise individually will make words similarly difficult to recognise, and words that are easy to recognise individually will make words easy to recognise. What I&rsquo;m enquiring about is counter evidence to this, i.e. letters that are slower to recognise individually producing faster word recognition. Hrant&rsquo;s legibility/readability opposition hypothesis seems to suggest this possibility, even that is should be the case.</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>John, the confusion between the lower case l and upper case I in many fonts is an example of where legibility problems of letters don&rsquo;t seem to affect readability of words. I would expect that with additional ambiguous letters you would have more problems.</p>
<p>Peter Enneson&rsquo;s theory is that the way letters are designed the normal tightness of letters make them less recognizable individually, but the sub-letter units, arranged in a regular rhythm are more recognizable as a whole word pattern. If he&rsquo;s right, that it may explain why letters that are confusable in isolation don&rsquo;t pose problems within words. I&rsquo;ve seen this with fancy script caps also—no problem reading in context, but out of it you don&rsquo;t know what it is. The sum of the readability of the word is not the same as the sum of the legibility of the individual letters.</p>
<p>It might be that more differentiation would make an isolated letter easier to distinguish, but it may be harder to read in the crowded situation of words. For example some blackletter with a lot of hairlines, or some script fonts.</p>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t thought this through yet, but it&rsquo;s an interesting question, particularly as a possible way to test Peter&rsquo;s theory.</p>

<p>Abstract:
To assess the limitation on reading speed imposed by saccadic eye movements, we measured reading speed in 13 normally-sighted observers using two modes of text presentations: PAGE text which presents an entire passage conventionally in static, paragraph format, and rapid serial visual presentation (RSVP) which presents text sequentially, one word at a time at the same location in the visual field. In Expt 1, subjects read PAGE and RSVP text orally across a wide range of letter sizes (2X to 32X single-letter acuity) and reading speed was computed from the number of correct words read per minute. Reading speeds were consistently faster for RSVP compared to PAGE text at all letter sizes tested. The average speeds for text of an intermediate letter size (8X acuity) were 1171 words/min for RSVP and 303 words/min for PAGE text. In Expt 2 subjects read PAGE and RSVP text silently and a multiple-choice comprehension test was administered after each passage. All subjects continued to read RSVP text faster, and 6 subjects read at the maximum testable rate (1652 words/min) with at least 75% correct on the comprehension tests. Experiment 3 assessed the minimum word exposure time required for decoding text using RSVP to minimize potential delays due to saccadic eye movement control. Successive words were presented for a fixed duration (word duration) with a blank interval (ISI) between words. The minimum word duration required for accurate oral reading averaged 69.4 msec and was not reduced by increasing ISI. We interpret these results as an indication that the programming and execution of saccadic eye movements impose an upper limit on conventional reading speed.</p>

		<div class="commentbody">Bill, what I asked was whether there was any evidence that making letters less legible ever results in <em>improved</em> word recognition, i.e. made it <em>better</em> than when the letters were more legible. Yes, there are some difficult to recognise or ambiguous letter forms that, in the context of words, do not pose the same level of difficulty as in isolation, presumably because of linguistic context clues. But this is not the same thing at all as suggesting that less legible letters might improve word recognition, which seems to be the implication of Hrant&rsquo;s opposition of legibility and readability, or the converse: that optimising letters for individual recognisability might actually hamper readability.</div>

<p>Hmm. A saccade is a zero-input eye movement between fixations. The shorter the saccades and the longer the fixations, the slower the reading. The longer the saccades and the shorter the fixations the faster the reading. The upper limit of reading speed has always been comprehension: the longer the saccades and the shorter the fixations, the greater the chance of comprehension error and the more regressive saccades necessary to correct false readings. Even at these highest, most error prone speeds, though, the mechanism of reading remains the same: fixation and saccade. Not only do I not see grounds to consider &lsquo;saccade-free reading&rsquo; achievable, I can&rsquo;t even imagine what it would be like. If you&rsquo;re getting rid of saccades, that implies you are also getting rid of fixations, since the two are part of a single mechanism. So what is left? What is the mechanism of &lsquo;saccade-free reading&rsquo;? How does it work?</p>

<p>You put on eye tracking equipment, look at a dot, present words in an RSVP fashion, and ask the subject questions about what they just read. Look at the eye-tracker data, their eyes haven’t moved, and presto, saccade-free reading. It’s just one long fixation. It’s clearly possible to attend to a single location without eye movements, I watch people in a lab do this all day. If their eyes move, the trial ends, and they try again. Are we on the same page?</p>
<p>Regarding “<em>I would posit that the minimum duration a word needs to be exposed to be read with near-total accuracy is roughly proportional to some compound of its frequency and bouma distinctiveness.</em>” It is my understanding that frequency and semantics play the primary roles in determining duration. Again, I’d have to do a little more digging to find references to support this, but I know there’s a lot out there on just that.</p>

<p>Bouwhuis, D. &amp; Bouma, H. (1977). Visual word recognition of three-letter words as derived from the recognition of the
constituent letters<em>. Perception &amp; Psychophysics, 25 (1)</em>, 12–22.</p>
<p>Abstract:
Word recognition is one of the basic processes involved in reading. In this connection, a model for word recognition is proposed consisting of a perceptual and a decision stage. It is supposed that, in the perceptual stage, the formation of possible words proceeds by separate identification of each of the letters of the stimulus word in their positions. Letter perception is taken to be conditional on position because of interaction effects from neighboring letters. These effects are dependent on both position in the word and retinal eccentricity, which are of particular relevance in reading. The letter-based approach rests on the strong relationship between the results from single-letter recognition in meaningless strings and in real words. Next, in the decision step, the many alternatives generated in the perceptual stage are matched with a vocabulary of real words. It is supposed that the final choice from among the remaining words is made in accordance with the constant ratio rule; frequency effects are not separately incorporated in the model. All predictions of the model are generated by means of data from earlier experiments. Despite being not optimally suited for this purpose, the predictions compare favorably with responses in word-recognition experiments.</p>

<p>Abstract:
Our goal is to link spatial and temporal properties of letter recognition to reading speed for text viewed centrally or in peripheral vision. We propose that the size of the visual span — the number of letters recognizable in a glance — imposes a fundamental limit on reading speed, and that shrinkage of the visual span in peripheral vision accounts for slower peripheral reading. In Experiment 1, we estimated the size of the visual span in the lower visual field by measuring RSVP (rapid serial visual presentation) reading times as a function of word length. The size of the visual span decreased from at least 10 letters in central vision to 1.7 letters at 15° eccentricity, in good agreement with the corresponding reduction of reading speed measured by Chung and coworkers (Chung, S. T. L., Mansfield, J. S., &amp; Legge, G. E. (1998). Psychophysics of reading. XVIII. The effect of print size on reading speed in normal peripheral vision. Vision Research, 38, 2949–2962). In Exp. 2, we measured letter recognition for trigrams (random strings of three letters) as a function of their position on horizontal lines passing through fixation (central vision) or displaced downward into the lower visual field (5, 10 and 20°). We also varied trigram presentation time. We used these data to construct visual-span profiles of letter accuracy versus letter position. These profiles were used as input to a parameter-free model whose output was RSVP reading speed. A version of this model containing a simple lexical-matching rule accounted for RSVP reading speed in central vision. Failure of this version of the model in peripheral vision indicated that people rely more on lexical inference to support peripheral reading. We conclude that spatiotemporal characteristics of the visual span limit RSVP reading speed in central vision, and that shrinkage of the visual span results in slower reading in peripheral vision.</p>
<p>————</p>
<p>I think a simple series of RSVP word recognition tasks using trigrams and different fonts for individual letters would be a step towards answering this question.</p>

I don&rsquo;t know if it&rsquo;s true, but I can imagine that ornate, highly differentiated letters might be easier to distinguish, but do worse in word tests. By letter legibility I mean that the letters could be recognized in very short, millisecond times, without many errors.

		<div class="commentbody">Has there ever been any research or even discussion on what is &ldquo;readable enough for a given task&rdquo;.  One end of a continuum might be a phone book number and another might be &ldquo;War and Peace&rdquo;.  We could place things like brochures, ads, posters, etc.., wherever they may fall.
My point in this is that I assume there are points where the optimum for one task differs from another.  There is a place where the form of the typeface may aid communication of the message of the text yet reduce continual reading.  There may be a place where the form of the text has so little communication of content (beyond just as a letterform) as to be a non-factor.<br>
When designing a typeface for a given target use, it might be valuable to know where these breaks occur.</div>

<cite>I actually believe that saccade-free reading is not only
achievable, but also highly desirable.</cite></p>
<p>This comment might be more controversial than it deserves to be, on the basis of the fact that saccade-free <em>seeing</em> is not possible. If you stare at one point fixedly enough to suppress saccades, within seconds your visual field will narrow to a small point.</p>
<p>However, while <em>eye movement</em> is an essential component of vision, <em>and hence of reading</em>,  and, on top of that, the saccade is typically a largely <em>involuntary</em> motion&hellip; you&rsquo;re still not nearly as wrong as all this makes you sound.</p>
<p>Because, of course, when reading, one doesn&rsquo;t stare at a single word, with one&rsquo;s eyes wandering back and forth along that word, the way one watches a movie or TV screen, or even admires a painting or sculpture.</p>
<p>One&rsquo;s gaze is in constant motion, but even with occasional saccades, in general, over the majority of words, one&rsquo;s gaze <em>will</em> pass unidirectionally, if one is reading at a good speed. Only if one is reading very slowly will a saccade be likely to take place during the reading of the majority of the words, or, say, even the majority of the words longer than three letters.</p>
<p>Thus, despite the universality of the saccade, the time scale of that phenomenon needs to be kept in mind. Normal, healthy reading of extended texts (i.e. where the reader is not moving his lips) <em>is</em> mostly saccade-free, and proper typography will facilitate that.</p>
<p>@Christopher Dean:
<cite>You put on eye tracking equipment, look at a dot, present words in an RSVP fashion, and ask the subject questions about what they just read. Look at the eye-tracker data, their eyes haven’t moved, and presto, saccade-free reading. It’s just one long fixation.</cite></p>
<p>Possibly I misunderstood Hrant&rsquo;s comment, if in order to engage in the saccade-free reading of a book, it is necessary to somehow have its pages presented to me as one word at a time flashed on a screen.</p>
<p>But in checking, I see I misunderstood the word &ldquo;saccade&rdquo;, and was mistakenly restricting it to involuntary movements of which we are generally not consciously aware which allow us to look at a wider visual field than our fovea can handle.</p>
<p>Those shouldn&rsquo;t normally be part of reading, but the voluntary movement of the eye from one word or part of a word to the next also counts as a saccade - and, indeed, some words are long enough not to be contained in the fovea if presented in a legible size.</p>
<p>One <em>could</em> still see the whole shape of a word and recognize it without having applied acute foveal vision to every letter of the word, but I think it would take a dedicated speed-reading enthusiast to be able to employ such a technique to advantage.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Christopher, I wasn&rsquo;t talking about RSVP &ndash; and I don&rsquo;t think Hrant was either. Based on previous discussions going back several years, I understand Hrant to believe it is possible to massively increase typical reading speeds, not involving presenting text in new ways à la RSVP. So I&rsquo;m interested to know how Hrant sees &lsquo;saccade-free reading&rsquo; working.</p>
<p>[Personally, I consider RSVP a kind of parlour game, sort of interesting in that it shows that our word recognition skills are immediately adaptable to &lsquo;reading&rsquo; text presented in novel ways. But it doesn&rsquo;t seem to me very relevant to how we actually encounter text, to how we are likely to continue to encounter text, or to understanding a reading mechanism broken down into saccades and fixations.]</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Bill, I don&rsquo;t think there is a strictly linear relationship between letter recognition and word recognition, but I do think they are mutually supporting, not in opposition, and improve or degrade more or less in parallel. Linguistic context gives word recognition an advantage that enables some letters to be more easily recognised in words than in isolation, but  I don&rsquo;t see any basis to assume that such letters result in better word recognition than more individually legible ones would.</p>
<p>I do think, however, that individual letter recognisability probably gives diminishing returns to word recognition, which is why reading speeds seem only marginally affected across a significant range of typeface designs and styles. In other words, endlessly refining individual letter recognisability will obtain smaller and smaller gains in reading speed and accuracy. But the point is that they do seem to continue to move in the same direction, albeit at increasingly disproportionate rates. There doesn&rsquo;t seem to be a point at which improving individual letter recognisability <em>degrades</em> word recognisability.</p>

<p>Average adult reading speed in English is 250 words per minute. More significant to my mind is that average comprehension at that rate is only 70%. Comprehension demonstrably drops as reading speed increased, with tested &lsquo;speed readers&rsquo; averaging a mere 50% in comprehension.</p>
<p>Now, I&rsquo;m of the perhaps idiosyncratic opinion that the purpose of reading is to understand, so I&rsquo;m only interested in increases in reading speed that do not reduce comprehension, and most of the time wish that people would take the time to read more slowly.</p>

<p>Kevin may (or may not) be alluding to [[http://www.springerlink.com/content/l305450683505715/|this paper,]] which found that the word superiority effect disappears with very widely spaced letters. I predicted that this should happen on Peter Enneson&rsquo;s theory. Peter then did a literature search and found this paper, which had already demonstrated this. Kevin was kind enough to repeat some of the experiments, with variations, but his conditions didn&rsquo;t have the same precision as the early ones, done with a tachistoscope and printed matter, rather than on a computer, whose screen refresh is on the order of the times involved in flashing the words. And the results were not very clear. Peter&rsquo;s view is that to get more informative results we need a good control on what is called the SOA (stimulus onset asynchrony). But it&rsquo;s probably too much to try to get into this here.</p>

<p>Abstract:
The perceptual span or region of effective vision during eye fixations in reading was examined as a function of reading speed (fast readers were compared with slow readers), font characteristics (fixed width vs. proportional width), and intraword spacing (normal or reduced). The main findings were that fast readers (reading at about 330 wpm) had a larger perceptual span than did slow readers (reading about 200 wpm) and that the span was not affected by whether or not the text was fixed width or proportional width. In addition, there were interesting font and intraword spacing effects that have important implications for the optimal use of space in a line of text.</p>

<p>I just looked online but was unsure what

<p>John S:
That&rsquo;s the sort of thinking we need. For example if we really
want to test the idea that legibility and readability do exhibit
a digression and are not &ldquo;parallel&rdquo;, we could make a font
where the letters are hard to decipher but they come together
to form great boumas. Hmmm, what about Blue Island?

<p>Furthermore, taking John H&rsquo;s correct observation that your
example mainly emphasizes uniform elements (which means
it only hinders reading) to its terminus, one can only really
arrive at one place: alphabet reform! :-)  My dearest -if lately
mostly dormant- project.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I just couldn&rsquo;t resist to comment. Excuse my empirical and light hearted assumptions.</p>
<p>As I understand legibility is mainly concerned with what could be considered the efficient recognition of a given signal (message or part of a message). In order for a signal to be best recognized it needs to contrast it&rsquo;s ambient (noise) and to hold enough meaningful information in a simple way. Readability not only is concerned with the efficient recognition of signal but also with it&rsquo;s correct interpretation.</p>
<p>A message (signal or set of signals) can be very legible (recognizable a as a message) by contrast and simplification, but excessive contrast and simplicity (let&rsquo;s say a monocase, square modular sans serif) will often harm readability because it will hold low redundancy and probably low context. Also a set of highly contrasted signals (an irregular type style) will induce noise (meaningless or even distractive signals).</p>
<p>I had a big fire in my house last november, so I lost most of my books, but I recall reading one about legibility and semiotics (maybe by François Richardeau or Roy Harris but I&rsquo;m not really sure) that stated something like this:</p>
<p>As long as the type setting is fairly decent, there are many factors more important to readability than typeface style such as context and redundancy, because reading, as a perceptive process is the way the mind makes sense out of the chaotic set of signals it receives trough the senses. Basically our mind is always trying to guess, to anticipate and to connect the dots to make sense, to find meaning.</p>
<p>There are many theories about how reading takes place: letter by letter, phonetic recreation in the mind, by word shapes, by meaningful chunks&hellip; this book stated that our mind actually uses a mix of various strategies to read a text with the only purpose of guiding and feeding the perceptive process of guessing and confirming to build meaning.</p>
<p>So a text written in an engaging way (to keep interest) with a predictable sintactic structure (to aid anticipation) and with lots of contextualization and information redundancy will help readability more than a perfectly and painstackingly typeset text with let&rsquo;s say business financial babbling. This of course is highly dependant on the audience because different audiences will have different degrees of context, redundant information and interest in the text.</p>
<p>Now, there are also many reading levels as when we scan a list, or as when we are deeply engaged in a novel or as when we are scanning the columns of a newspaper. And it is true that different type styles aid each reading level in ways other type styles can&rsquo;t:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>A typeface for a phone book listing will try to make more individual standing out letters because you want to identify as fast as possible small signals that will help you navigate and find your information.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A typeface for a book will try to create a visually ease texture with high graphic redundancy (that is many dull and patterned cues that will help you distinguish different signals) to avoid fatigue and distraction and to help you focus your mind on the fast building and understanding of meaning rather than in the correct identification of every signal. I agree with John Hudson here that the limit to reading speed is comprehension.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A display typeface for a billboard or for magazine headlines will try to create more unique word contours to help you guess the words without having to go letter by letter because all the context you have (photos and graphics) does not directly relate to the linguistics of the word. So your mind may have a vague idea of the meaning of the words by the graphic context but needs visual cues as to which specific word it is.</p>

</ul>

<p>Yes, and that was my complaint against it. But since people
can read for relatively long periods using RSVP (just not very
realistically) John S&rsquo;s point about the &ldquo;collapse&rdquo; associated with
staring seems to be moot when the view is changing. I also
think blinking might have something to do with it (which Bill
will enjoy hearing, since it might tie in Luckiesh).</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Denis, reading a long text requires a big amount of mental effort and it is best done when the text has redundancy, that is that there are many cues pointing in the same direction. That is why serif types are commonly more comfortably read in long texts, they contain more visual information. That redundancy however needs to be part of a muted pattern because individually standing out features will draw attention from the process of understanding what you read into the process of identifying the quirk and even to the effort of systematically trying to ignore it.</p>
<p>However if you are not inmersed in a long read but rather scanning a list, a table or even reading a head line or a logotype, then you have more room for individuality among letters.</p>
<p>So my direct answer is: legibililty is not unidimensional, it depends on the kind of perceptive process because it is a part of readability and so there are ways of making a text legible that will hinder readability of long texts but also ways that will help it.</p>

		<div class="commentbody">Denis, I think your premises are mistaken, and hence lead to a mistaken contradiction. What is important to legibility of individual letters is not shape or size of particular details &ndash; a term I would reserve for features that contribute to the <em>style</em> of letter, e.g. terminal shapes, kind of serifs, etc. &ndash; but proportional positioning of structural features, i.e. shape. This is well demonstrated by the Fiset etc. <a href="http://www.mapageweb.umontreal.ca/gosselif/FISET_PSYCHSCIENCE_2008.pdf">bubble testing</a>, which reveals those structural elements that are relied on for letter identification. If this is paired with the conclusions of Denis Pelli&rsquo;s work on spatial frequency, and the presumption made that letters and their features within an individual typeface design will be handled in a way that keeps them within a single spatial frequency channel (unlike the heavy extenders type that Quadibloc illustrated), then there is no ground to think that legibility relies on differences in details that, if emphasised, would diminish readability. Legibility relies on structural features, which do not need to be emphasised in ways that detract from word recognition.</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><p><em>Not all words have letters with ascenders located in the same part of the word.</em></p>
<p>True, and there is a demonstrated role to extender position in <em>guessing</em> the identity of words at the edge of the fovea. But there&rsquo;s a trade-off in increasing the prominence of features to aid guessing about the identify of words at the edge of a fixation and doing what it best for word recognition within the fovea. Making the extenders significantly heavier affects the spatial frequency of the letters, pushing some letters or parts of letters into a different spatial frequency channel, which is one of the few things I am fairly sure is Not a Good Idea for readability.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I&rsquo;m not knocking guessing, which is clearly part of the back end of reading, albeit the least reliable part. I&rsquo;m saying that making changes to type to make correctly guessing the identity of words in the parafovea easier may have detrimental effect on word recognition in the fovea, or on reading comfort, or on overall speed, if these changes disrupt things like core legibility or spatial frequency. If it were possible to make these changes on-the-fly and only in the areas where they would help, then they might be helpful, but this introduces the same issues that I believe sink your AcTeD idea: you can only make such changes during a saccade, and until the saccade has ended you won&rsquo;t know where the fixation will be. Now, it might be possible to train text display software linked to eye-tracking to anticipate an individual reader&rsquo;s typical saccade length, and even to adjust for text content, e.g. lengthening saccades over short common words and shortening them for longer uncommon words, but I reckon that&rsquo;s the level of precision you would need to make the system at all viable, because morphing the appearance of text during fixations is going to be terribly distracting with, I reckon, a resulting major hit on speed.</p>
<p>By the way, important though guessing can be, I disagree that it is what humans do best. The inverse relationship of reading speed increase and comprehension accuracy indicates that we do pattern recognition better than we do guessing. The more we rely on guessing, the faster we can read but the more mistakes we make. The more we rely on pattern recognition, the slower we read but the fewer mistakes we make. We often favour guessing because it is faster, but it is a false economy if we&rsquo;re guessing correctly no more than half the time.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>It isn&rsquo;t absolutely better, only better relative to comprehension accuracy. For many kinds of texts, if you can increase speed while not reducing accuracy, that would be a net benefit on the grounds that our mortal time is limited, so by reading quicker we could read more or, indeed, have more time for not reading.</p>
<p>I say &lsquo;for many kinds of texts&rsquo; because I strongly believe that reading speed should vary according to what you are reading. Much depends on what you want to get out of the reading experience, and I can think of plenty of things that I&rsquo;d want to read slowly, including a lot that I&rsquo;d want to read out loud (most poetry is in that category).</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Wilkins' figure 9 is very interesting.  Distorting parts of words to the left of word center via Photoshop, or whatever they&rsquo;re using, without changing word length, helped literacy challenged subjects, reading Times by 4%.</p>
<p>Then they say that we, type designers, could make contextual substitutions available to help with gatherings of straight lowercase strokes at the focus point of a word. That&rsquo;s the problem, the in in ninja, the ini in minimum, and in itself.</p>
<p>So, I think we&rsquo;re supposed to make sure that the inter letter spaces between straight stemmed letters are clearly smaller than the counter space. None of this is particularly difficult in proportional fonts, but it&rsquo;s of course impossible in mono spaced fonts.</p>
<p>Additionally, assurance of picket-free reading is not possible in common low res environments and I&rsquo;ll leave that right there.</p>
<p>But these study results, and most reading comprehension theory has set up a conflict loop at the center of the readability/design circus; on one side, we&rsquo;re told to make lowercase with careful spacing and differentiation of letters without loss of familiarity – I call this serif text type.</p>
<p>On the other side, we&rsquo;re faced with applicatigons who don&rsquo;t want to know what widths the type designer wants in crude media at each size, renderacadors who&rsquo;ve made feature location a hinting epic and slowpoke adoption of contextual substitution – which I think all calls for san serif text type.</p>
<p>I did both serif and sans, small size designs with crowded inter letter spacing and open counters alREady. Which is my last point — using Times, a cruel Jobs joke,  to test reading, is ignoring five generations of design and four generations of technology — and I wish they&rsquo;d stop.  Times Roman is broken when it comes to picket fence avoidance and cannot be fixed without hints or a redesign.</p>
