body: I can only imagine the lot of you reeling in horror at the suggestion, but I&#39;m
  looking for a type &#40;or any vector&#41; distortion <BR>plugin for Adobe Illustrator,
  much like Kai&#39;s Vector Tools did <BR>or how &#40;GASP!&#41; Typestyler did years
  ago. <BR> <BR>No, I&#39;m not in the food packaging industry :0&#41; <BR> <BR>thanks
  in advance, <BR>Enrico
