  has urged me to act and to stand up for those who rather take the professional road
  and not comment on your nasty statements. here is what i blogged on the forum you
  all so lovingly created ([[http://typophile.com/node/55930]])...i shall echo my
  own sentiments:\r\n\r\nMay I just say, that as a student being targeted by this
  forum, our professors are not just \u201Ccollecting a paycheck\u201D nor our we
  just doing this for the \u201Cbrownie points\u201D. Our professors are merely trying
  to widen our horizons in the communicative and digital media regarding the art of
  typography. We are using this blog, yes as output for homework assignments, but
  we are also currently preparing work to be constructively critiqued by all you professionals.
  Constructive criticism is the best, no? I must admit that I am guilty of \u201Cposting
  and running\u201D, as Michael so cleverly put it, but with every passing class day,
  our professors inspire us to do more [we are only 1st year students, just so you
  understand]. It has come to our attention, that when an assignment is due, we do
  \u201Cflood\u201D the \u201CNewest\u201D forum, and for that we apologize, for our
  intentions are not to do so. I was just like to assure you all that our professors
  are not only instructing us in the art of graphic design, but also exposing us to
  different kinds of media, such as this blog. We have an amazing collection of professors
  who we are all very lucky to be learning from. Please do not insult the teaching
  methods of our professors [none of you are in the classroom with us, therefore none
  of you can truly begin to understand their motivation behind the assignments like
  we students can]. I do understand how you all would want us to have a separate \u201CStudent
  Forum\u201D, but I would also like to echo DanGayle\u2019s sentiments and concur
  that I would feel that the forum would make it hard if not impossible for professionals
  to view and constructively critique our work. But, some organization and content
  filtering is need. Well, that is all I have to say about that. Thank you for your
  time.\r\n\r\nPeace,\r\nGabi\r\n\r\n"

    repeat it. If the project description were given with the post then we would have
    more information and would be able to make better judgment and or just comments.
    Yes, there has been some flooding. But I think it felt more like a flood because
    there wasn't, again, information given along with the post.\r\n\r\nIt would be
    much more interesting to see all of the projects in the same thread where some
    comparison could be drawn. This would make it similar to a classroom critique.

  body: 'Very good suggestions, Miss Tiffany. We did speak with our professors on
    the matter, and they have the same sentiment: to write a description of the project.
    So, I believe you will be seeing this from now on. As for the thread, that is
    also a good idea. I''m sure our professors are on that as well. Thank you for
    your constructive comments!'

  body: "\"Please do not insult the teaching methods\"\r\n\r\nWe have no clue as to
    what they are teaching you. We can merely form an opinion based on what is being
    posted and, more specifically, how it's being posted. BASED ON THAT, there is
    plenty to be skeptical of. \r\n\r\nIt's been said many times already...no one
    is attacking you, the students. We're just a tad irritated by your professors'
    lack of netiquette.\r\n\r\n"

  body: "First of all, Jessica, a fellow student, <strong> was </strong> attacked,
    so there goes that argument. \r\n\r\nSecondly, what are the terms of netiquette?
    \ I am not going to lie, I have never heard of it until I read it the other day.
    But just out of observation, I am guessing it has nothing to do with common courtesy,
    nor the notion of being polite instead of being purposefully and <em>unnecessarily</em>
    harsh or cruel. Please enlighten those who you obviously think are oblivious to
    the phrase, so we can behave in a more appropriate manner. \r\n\r\nThirdly, the
    means as to which our assignments are being posted is the fault of us, the students,
    for not explaining ourselves well enough, and does not reflect on the education
    being provided by our professors. Trust me when I say there is <strong><em> nothing
    </em></strong> to be skeptical of. And if you all are <em> truly </em> concerned
    with our education, you need not be, for we are receiving the best education the
    gulf coast has to offer. And if you are <em>unsure,</em> voicing that in rude
    was is not helping the \"situation\". \r\n\r\nAnd fourthly, these posts, while
    open to everyone to comment on [and we do appreciate the fact that you all take
    out the time to critique our work], are <strong><em>blogs!</em></strong> I mean,
    I understand that blogs in general are for passionate people looking for a way
    to express themselves, but is it constructive or helping <strong>anyone</strong>
    when cruel remarks are being shared and exchanged?! I really don't understand
    what everyone is getting so upset about. I am defending the reputation of my fellow
    classmates and professors, but is it <em>really</em> such a huge burden on everyone?!
    I mean...seriously?\r\n\r\n"

  body: "There are too many threads to keep up with, but again I will say WE HAVE
    A PLAN. :)\r\n\r\nEveryone calm down and be patient. Gabi, the community is having
    a difficult time with this because suddenly the forums are being bombarded by
    unstructured threads which lack the information necessary to allow people to interact
    with the content and you (the author). This isn't necessarily the fault of the
    students, and part of the problem might be the underlying architecture of the
    site and the way in which we handle and surface content. Blogs have never been
    an integral part of Typophile and not so long ago, only paying members of the
    site used them. And really, no one used them until we opened it up to everyone.\r\n\r\nSurfacing
    blogs is a new thing here. It has become very popular in a short amount of time
    and is now causing us to re-think how the system needs to function, and how people
    use them. There isn't anything wrong with the way in which your class is utilizing
    this feature, as a matter of fact it is quite interesting and proposes some new
    opportunities. But it will require organization to do this in a more engaging
    way.\r\n\r\nNo one here don't dislikes students, and I apologize if our nastier
    community members are making your experiences at Typophile unpleasant. We are
    communicating with the instructors involved and will be proposing ideas to help
    solve some of these problems and promote collaboration and dialogue instead of
    negative criticism. \r\n\r\nIf you have any direct complaints or want more information,
    feel free to contact me directly. zara [at] punchcut [dot] com\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nZara\r\n"
