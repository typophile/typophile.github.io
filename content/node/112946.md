body: "Hi everybody,\r\n\r\nI am designing a book series of utopian novels. There
  will be some classics of the genre and some less known books. Most of the novels
  are late 19th century but not all. I have to decide on the main typeface that will
  be used for the text. The texts will be in English with no other language requirements.\r\nThe
  concept of an \"utopian\" book typeface intrigues me but I have not reached any
  conclusion yet so I would like some suggestions.\r\n\r\nI would prefer to use a
  relatively new typeface and so give some money to a living designer and not just
  Adobe. Also a kind of \"contemporary\" look (whatever that may mean) is part of
  the brief.\r\n\r\nFor no particular reason I am drawn to the idea of using something
  like Joanna..."

    been dead since 1940, and Joanna came out around 1930\u201331, so that wouldn't
    work out in terms of money to a living designer, nor in looking contemporary."

    body: "Hi Thomas,\r\n\r\nYes, I know that. It also will not do because of the
      italics. There are some occasional italics in the texts but they need to be
      much more subtle than Joanna's. Whitman is the classic alternative but then
      again it does not relate particularly to the concept of utopia, does it? \r\n\r\nUtopia
      makes me think more of timelessness and perfection which clashes a bit with
      the \"contemporary\" idea.\r\n\r\nIowan Old Style is a possibility...\r\n\r\nOne
      idea was to use Hypatia Sans for titles so the solution could be a serif that
      works well with Hypatia."

  body: "1. AFAIK Robert Slimbach, the designer of Utopia -- born in 1956 -- is still
    a \"living designer.\" I hope he still gets something from his work other than
    a payment long ago for completing his design for Adobe. But the font business
    seems to lack anything like the music business system of a levy for every time
    the song is broadcast.\r\n2. Should a utopian image be a contemporary fad, or
    a reflection of timeless perfection? I would see contemporary fads as being more
    appropriate for dystopian visions than utopian ones. \r\nDon"

    to the concept of utopia, not the typeface. \r\n\r\nThis idea of timelessness
    makes me think of a Garalde, which is a safe solution but does not sound very
    appropriate historically for late 19th and early 20th century. That's why I think
    of Whitman-Joanna.\r\n\r\nBut you seem to think Slimbach's Utopia is a good idea...
    It is suspiciously obvious..."

  body: "William Morris\u2019 <em>News From Nowhere</em> was set in his Golden Type,
    a Jenson revival of sorts. \r\n\r\nBut I don\u2019t think that any revival made
    today is really timeless, referring as it does to its original\u2019s time and
    place of conception.\r\n\r\nRather, I would say that a new design informed by
    traditional precepts is less tied to a speci\uFB01c time and place in history.\r\n\r\nTherefore
    I would recommend my own Richler, a \u201Cbook face\u201D that combines some contemporary
    principles of readability with elements of the classic old-style or antiqua genre.\r\n\r\nhttp://origin.myfonts.com/s/aw/original/211/0/108166.pdf"

      a specimen for Greek too? I will not use Greek in this project but being Greek
      I am obviously very interested in any good Greek typeface (and there are not
      that many)."

    \"contemporary\" you mean letterforms that aren't classical, take a look at Skolar.
    It's reasonable without being too abysmally clunky\r\n\r\n(See  http://media.caranddriver.com/images/12q4/492040/2014-gmc-sierra-1500-all-terrain-photo-497174-s-1280x782.jpg
    for an ostensive definition of \"abysmally clunky\")\r\n\r\nHuronia has a similar
    contemporary look, vis a vis letterforms. (Rosetta distributes Huronia, but it
    is a Tiro Typeworks design.) Both families have Greek, though I'm not competent
    to judge how good any contemporary Greek font is -- and Huronia had, as of 2012,
    Greek in the roman only.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.rosettatype.com/Skolar\r\nhttp://www.rosettatype.com/Huronia\r\n\r\nBy
    the way, be careful of fonts with newish letterforms -- IMSLTHO letterforms are
    less than half of what an effective font is about, unless you're selling a product
    and need brand identity or some such. General spacing and the way letters fit
    together is far more important. Of the \"contemporary\" fonts, the two above at
    least meet that test. \r\n\r\n<blockquote>For no particular reason I am drawn
    to the idea of using something like Joanna...</blockquote>\r\n\r\nWell, except
    for the fact that it's been described as \"so 1990s,\" Scala is quite reminiscent
    of Joanna. This, as with so many fonts designed for printing from repro-negative-plate,
    comes out a bit light with current direct-to-plate printing. \r\n\r\nMany examples
    of this effect, one I'm reading right now (set in Scala)  -- <cite>Mountains Beyond
    Mountains</cite>, Tracy Kidder's book about Paul Farmer, which any library should
    have. (See a Random House first edition, any printing.)\r\n\r\n<cite>Edit</cite>
    -- if the publisher is planing an ebook in a pdf version (unlikely) stick with
    Adobe fonts, or do some serious checking on EULAs. Aside from Adobe, almost everyone
    else charges extra for embedding fonts for commercial use, such as a pdf ebook.
