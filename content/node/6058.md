body: Hi all, <BR> <BR>Can you recommend any good text fonts to a student on a budget?
  <BR> <BR>I&#39;m currently writing a dissertation &#40;not on graphic design, alas&#41;,
  which I will have to typeset and make camera-ready myself. And I would really, <i>really</i>
  like to escape the Times New Roman purgatory of standard science dissertations.  <BR>
  <BR>My only problem is that it would have to be a free or cheap TrueType font -
  say, under $20. Alas, I can&#39;t afford anything from FontFont, no matter how much
  I like them. <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif" ALT=":-&#41;"
  BORDER=0>   <BR> <BR>So what do you think? Any recommendations? <BR>

    Lido at Storm Type</a>? It&#39;s probably the best free font I&#39;ve seen out
    there. <BR> <BR>

  body: It&#39;s a computer science dissertation - couple hundred pages, in chapters,
    sections and sub-sections, with occasional box-and-arrows diagrams. Unfortunately,
    the school requires a 12pt font and double-spaced lines &#40;!!!&#41;. So columns
    are probably out - it&#39;s just going to be wide and sparse lines of text filling
    a standard A4/letter page. <BR> <BR>My current fonts are what came with Windows
    and Office, including Book Antiqua, Bookman Old Style, etc. Right now I&#39;ve
    been experimenting with Book Antiqua &#40;thanks for the textism link BTW, it&#39;s
    very inspiring!&#41;, which looks fairly nice. It&#39;s got low x-height, though,
    which makes the long, double-spaced lines look funny. <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"
    ALT=":-&#41;" BORDER=0> <BR> <BR>By the way, thanks for the Lido link - I&#39;ll
    definitely give it a try! <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"

  body: If the school requires not just 12 point type and double spacing but also
    a fixed margin &#40;as I recall one inch was usually the magic number&#41; your
    main problem might be line length -- you might be getting too many characters
    per line. You might want to look for a wide face if that&#39;s the case &#40;and,
    yes, a larger x-height because of the big line space&#41;.

  body: The terms 12 point and double line space are meaningless. 10 different fonts
    rendered at &#34;12 point&#34; could appear as 10 different sizes. Lines space
    will also be affected by the various font ascent and descent values. <BR>
