  at Ohio University. I have been working on a bunch of geometric typefaces for my
  thesis project and have decided to put them out in the public.\r\n\r\nThese typefaces
  are based on my studies of modernism and constructivism respectively (largely based
  on the writing of Jan Tschichold and the Stenberg brothers). I'm starting with strict
  geometric designs, and developing the glyphs into a more legible forms.\r\n\r\ncheck
  'em out!\r\n\r\nhttp://www.1919type.com\r\n\r\nthanks!"
