  body: "In the CR article on The Observer's redesign, it is mentioned that Cyrus
    Highsmith's Stainless is the \"character\" type (display headers) and Tobias Frere-Jones'
    Whitney is the sans-serif for the body copy.\r\n\r\nIt is stated in this article
    that the nameplate/masthead was designed by Cyrus Highsmith under the direction
    of Carolyn Roberts. Perhaps the intention was to add the warmth of Whitney to
    Stainless. :^)\r\n\r\n"
