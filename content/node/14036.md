body: "<strong>[[Indices]] : [[Software]] : [[Design Applications]] : ConTeXt</strong>\r\n\r\nConTeXt
  is a document preparation system based on the [[TeX]] typesetting program. Being
  more recent than the other main [[TeX]] macro package, [[LaTeX]], it is both more
  modular in its conception and more monolithic in its building.\r\n\r\nThis system
  was developed from 1990 by Hans Hagen from PRAGMA Advanced Document Engineering
  (Pragma ADE), a Netherlands-based company.\r\n\r\nFor more on ConTeXt, see the wiki:\r\n\r\nhttp://wiki.contextgarden.net/Main_Page"
