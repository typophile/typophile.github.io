  contributor to this forum, particulary in the field of book typography. But I guess
  that everyone here - people who knew him personally and anyone else - should be
  interested in the book set by his wife, \"Type Works: Will Powers\"; I have found
  the reference to it in John D. Berry's blog:\r\n\r\nhttp://johndberry.com/blog/2011/07/27/type-works-will-powers/"
