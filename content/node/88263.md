  Any guesses?\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/31_dada04_5680.jpg]"

    the former Apply Design group has <a href=\"http://www.apply.de/Merz.php\">recreated</a>
    it in the nineties. Also available <a href=\"http://www.fonthaus.com/fonts/applydesign/Merz/AD10151\">here</a>."

  body: And the slanted crossbar of the E is to be found as a separate character (alternate)
    in the font. On the normal E-position the crossbar is horizontal. (There are other
    alternates, too.)

    \r\nSchwitters took the <em>name</em> of his art \"MERZ\" from a Commerz und Privatbank
    advertisement that he excerpted and included in a collage, but that was not in
    the lettering of the title of his later publication shown in the first post."
