  body: One word no repeating characters large differences in the size and shapes=
    Hand written. Don&#39;t dispare, go to Mikes type Idenification Guide and look
    under Scripts and see if he has something listed that has that feel. I don&#39;t
    have the link but someone here does.

  body: Because of the way those letters connect, I am convinced that that is handwriting
    and not a font. <BR> <BR>For something similar I would suggest checking <a href="http://bowfinprintworks.com/Script09Pg1.html"
    target="_blank">Part 9 of the Script Font ID Guide</a> &#40;Everyday handwriting&#41;.
    You might see something there that you feel has the same quality you like about
    this sample. You then look up the vendor using the links to the Script Font Reference
    List, which has information about the fonts. <BR> <BR>My own personal choice to
    simulate this look would be either Shimmer from Blue Vinyl, or Velvet Script from
    Typadelic. &#40;See samples from Script Guide below&#41;. <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/63239.gif"
