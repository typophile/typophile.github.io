body: I would like to face down the initial stroke of letters ain and hah. I know
  usually it's directed upwards or at least horizontal, but my design needs an exception
  here. Is it possible? Thanks in advance.

  body: Everything is acceptable as long as it is still Ain and Hah i.e. just draw
    it and ask people, if they recognise it then it is good.

  body: Sorry for the flip of the tongue; I meant the baseline stroke. I would like
    to try directing it downwards (slightly below the baseline) - I plan to reshape
    the typical diagonal ramp of the words into something more sinusoidal. This works
    with initial Seen, Meem, Hah etc. But with the Ain and Hah I am afraid of the
    Meem ligature effect.

    primitive sketch. At this moment I am interested in obtaining basic directions,
    before I move on to the stage of searching for letter directions and design details.
    (So eg. Ain is still open because I cannot draw a satisfactory \"shrimp\" stroke
    at this stage)."
