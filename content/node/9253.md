body: could you please help me with some feedback concerning a really nasty issue
  I&#39;m faced with right now. I used to generate CE versions of fonts for my clients
  in TT format, and now i switched to OT. The problem I have is that, although I manually
  built syle names like I used to &#40;and they worked fine, btw&#41;, this time,
  in Illustrator CS on WinXP syles appear in an unusual order, Bold Italic right after
  Normal, and then Italic and Bold ... did anyone deal with such a issue before? <BR>
  <BR>thanks <BR>george <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/4101/65344.jpg"
