body: "Inspired by another thread, opened by hrant, who asks for Tannenberg examples,
  I became involved in this still open discussion. I am german. Old fashioned german
  \u2014 konservativ and more ^^. So I wrote some emotional answers.\r\n\r\nWhat I
  saw is, what I learned the last years: There are lots of misunderstandings about
  german so called \"New Gothic\" fonts, Fraktur fonts and others. I am not Jesus.
  So I cannot change the world's thinking. But I can offer you a mirror. Look into
  it and see, that you as pro's or semi-pro's have to be careful to define what is
  Nazi font and what is not.\r\n\r\nI organized a litte quizz on my website. The text
  is written in german, so here are the rules. Here you can chose, what is Nazi and
  what is not.\r\n\r\n1. I scanned 11 famous sentences from The Big Bad Guy himself.
  Everyone in another famous font. Oh... that's not true... Ehm... I show 11 scans
  in diferent fonts, that's right. But only 6 of 11 are the original fonts. The other
  5 of 11 fonts were edited by me electronically. I changed the font.\r\n\r\nAnswer
  the next two questions. \r\nThe winner gets the original Graphic Magazine, I got
  the scans from. I'll send it for free wherever in the world you are living.\r\n\r\nSo...
  good luck. \r\nClick on the posted links 0000001 up to 0000011 - there was not enough
  space in the blog entry, so I had to upload it outside my blog. Its not so important
  to know all the 11 fonts. The pro's of course know it, the semi-pro's can concentrate
  themselves on the design of the fonts.\r\n\r\n1. Which six scans show the original
  6 \"Nazi fonts\" from the magazine?\r\n2. Which of the 5 other fonts would never
  ever been used in Nazi Germany for these ads?\r\n\r\nI let it open for one week
  or so... \r\n\r\nTo say it with Jimi H.: Are you realy experienced, hrant? ^^\r\n\r\n<a

  body: "The problem with a quiz of this type is that it focuses on the history of
    each typeface rather than on its effect with the anticipated audience for the
    project in hand. The question is whether a typeface evokes thoughts of Nazi Germany
    in the mind of the expected reader, not whether the typeface was used in Germany
    for Nazi publications.\r\n\r\nI'll give a slightly different example. I design
    and set publications for a Jewish organization. I wouldn't use a Fraktur typeface
    - even if Hitler thought it was a Jewish typeface - nor would I use a New Gothic
    type. This would apply even to a Fraktur typeface designed after 1945.\r\n\r\nOn
    the other hand, the organization has no problem with Latin typefaces that were
    actually used for Nazi publications, or with Latin types by German designers who
    are old enough to have served in the military before 1945.\r\n\r\nThere are other
    types that might evoke the wrong associations for this organization. I would be
    unlikely to use an Irish uncial type, because it would likely evoke thoughts of
    Ireland - unless, and this could occur, the organization were presenting a program
    on Jewish history in Ireland."

  body: "Yes, hrant, that's true, I know. \r\nSorry about that. It spent more time
    to scan and to made the changes to the five fakes, as I had. I am not experienced
    with Photoshop. I am just a little dealer of used letterpress stuff.\r\n\r\nIts
    0:45 a.m. over here, I am just coming back from a meeting with some comrades.
    A little ceremony for the Day Of Re-Union With Middle Germany. A recitation about
    the history of Germany since 1945, we sang some songs and our national hymne with
    all strophes(?) (only the third one is the official hymne of this what is called
    BRD today. The others are not forbidden, but... well... there is a kind of social
    pressure not to sing it in public. You know what I mean.). Now I undress my parachutist
    boots - its very uncomforable to wear it in my age of 54 years, argghh. I don't
    know, who set up this trend for us national germans. Now I have to brush my teeth
    and to polish my bald head, before I go to bed.\r\n\r\nI found a picture of you
    anywhere in the WWW. Was your family coming from south of Europe? That's me: http://www.bleisetzer.de/hintergrund.html
    German since I don't know... father's family lived as a german minority since
    three generations in Galicia, Poland further on, today Ukraine. From 1936 they
    lived in Warsaw where my father, his brother and his sister visited a kind of
    \"high school\". I don't know the exakt term in english. They left Galicia because
    this was a very poor part of the country. My grandfather was there since 1916
    as a volunteer of Austrian Army. (Austrians and Germans are the same people. They
    decided to union rest of Austria and Germany after 1918, but the allies did not
    allow it). In Warsaw after General Pilsudski, who ruled Poland, died in 1935,
    the situation became very hard for the german minority. Lots of them very set
    under pressure, hit or killed. So my family saw it to become freedem, when the
    german Wehrmacht overtook Warsaw end of September 1939. My father and his brother
    went as volunteers to Wehrmacht and both fought in Charkow and Kursk/Orel. My
    father was wounded very hard and they flew him out - he was member of special
    forces, I do not want to say the name of these combats. Under all soldiers of
    the world, these german troops were seen as an elite. After the war, he could
    not go back to... well.. to where? He lost his homeland, there was Poland now,
    but he was german. His sister fought in the war, too. She joined the communist
    partizans. Funny, mh? She lived in West Poland, what is East Germany. I have a
    cousin, he's 48 yo or so... We love each others like brothers do. And we communicate
    in our poor english. I cannot speak polish, he cannot speak german. He is a judge
    and is very interested in polish history. Sometimes he sends me very old text
    to translate it into english. This are german texts from the year 1200. So old,
    I cannot understand it, but I found a guy from University in Hamburg, who helps.
    My cousin calls it polish history, but its in german.. Funny, too, mh? I hate
    this f... Hitler. He made dirty everything what someone like me loves... And this,
    sometimes, makes me very very sad. \r\n\r\nSry for bothering.\r\n\r\nGeorg\r\n_______________________________________________\r\n\u201EIch

    suffix. Dunno, maybe I should say something romantically head-strong, like \"Hey,
    I've been Armenian for over 3000 years!\" Or: \"My people had a Golden Age when
    yours were living in trees!\" The truth is, I don't consider myself \"pure\" Armenian,
    even though I don't know of any ancestors of mine that were \"non-Armenian\".
    I've lived in Barcelona for 6 months, so maybe I'm ~1% Catalan? It feels more
    like 10%. And I've live in LA since 1986 (except for those 6 months - well, plus
    another 3 in Armenia) so what am I? LA isn't <em>really</em> American... Before
    that I grew up in Beirut. So what am I, a terrorist? Well, maybe just a little
    bit. You see, nothing is pure anything. Not type, not people.\r\n\r\nAnd scientific

  body: "Yah, where's the Futura? I know for certain that I've seen at least a few
    Nazi posters using the typeface. Obviously, that one could be just as Nazi as,
    say, Tannenberg. Though I like Tannenburg, I've never quite found a use for it.
    Perhaps beer bottles or a German deli advertisements. I have, though, used other
    Gothics as companion faces to Roman, which works nicely.\r\n\r\nTo be clear, I
    really never associated any Gothic faces with the Nazi regime, or Third Reich.
    Most of them evoke, for me and most others I know, a feel of the Middle Ages,
    or archaism. And the simpler, later German faces, such as Tannenburg, tend to
    remind people of Rock music and such things. Used in certain contexts they look
    German.\r\n\r\nOr perhaps in Europe there really are bad associations. Here in
    the States, I don't think that happens much.\r\n\r\nNext to a Swastika, Verdana
    even will look Nazi. Though a more 'German' (and period) typeface might cement
    such an idea.\r\n\r\nBri\xE4n\r\n\r\n\r\n<strong>Edit:</strong> For the record,
    I'm American. Though, ethnically, I'm mostly German, with a bit of Russian and
