  knows:\r\n\r\nI'd like to create ordinal letters (for example for \"1st\" \"2nd\"
  ...).\r\nAre there official unicode values where I can place them?\r\n\r\nI found
  some, like \"m\" \"n\" etc. but I'm still missing \"s\" (and some others), and they
  are not contineous but spread all over the ranges...\r\n\r\nSo I'm neither sure
  whether the ones I found are intended to be used for that purpose, nor I know where
  to place the others I haven't found yet.\r\n\r\nThanks for your help (again and
  again...)\r\nSebastian"
