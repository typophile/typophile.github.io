body: Hello, I remember seeing wedding invitation that use dingbats that actually
  spell out commonly used words like "the", "and" and  others in a vintage style.
  Can somebody please recommend fonts that include those, or at least tell what the
  proper name for them is... thank you

  body: Dan, the leading space will actually not get displayed and your lines will
