  body: We get this with our Sunday paper. Looks like most of the heads are set in
    various weights of <a href="http://www.typography.com/catalog/knockout/series_c.html">Knockout</a>.
    The text is mostly <a href="http://www.fontbureau.com/fonts/Farnham">Farnham</a>
    and (I think) News Gothic. Could be Trade Gothic, or even <a href="http://www.fontbureau.com/fonts/BentonSans">Benton
    Sans</a>. In fact, the latter seems more likely given the other fonts they use.
    I'm not sure if this is always true, but the latest issue features <a href="http://emigre.com/EF.php?fid=109">Mrs.
    Eaves</a> for display type on the cover and the features. Oh, and I see a bit
    of <a href="http://www.typography.com/catalog/gotham/index.html">Gotham</a> thrown
    in here and there.

    Eaves.
