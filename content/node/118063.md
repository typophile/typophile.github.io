body: "This is my first post, so: Hello! I'm not a type designer by trade, but I've
  been interested in typography for 25 years. A few months ago, I finally bought Glyphs
  and started noodling around. I had no goal, and wasn't looking at any references,
  but what came out was this friendly blend of Avenir and Akzidenz, with capitals
  that are more upright and American. Somehow, the more I tried to remove my own hand,
  the more of a self portrait it became. Has anyone experienced that?\r\n\r\nAnyway,
  it has already been a fascinating process, but at this point, I'd love some feedback.
  I'm open to any type of comment or critique. I have 3 masters so far.\r\n\r\nRegular\r\n<img

    body: "@eliason: Good catch! I made it taller for contrast with the /I/, but neglected
      to propagate that change to the other ascenders. Thank you.\r\n\r\n@Birdseeding:
      Thank you so much for your feedback. I'll upload a PDF this weekend. It's interesting
      that you mention the /u/. I think it's the same width as the /n/\u2014is that
      typical?\r\n\r\nI agree about the black /t/ and /y/ vs /j/. The /t/ can be saved,
      but in the black weight, the /y/ is a challenge. Maybe I can thin out the curve
      of the /j/ a bit to match.\r\n\r\n@hrant: That's interesting\u2014I'm definitely
      hesitant to make the face more idiosyncratic simply to make it stand out, but
      I see your point. I suppose that's the challenge of this style: to tread the
      line between \"understated\" and \"boring.\"\r\n\r\nI'm still torn about the
      quotes. Sometimes they feel too cartoony, but I like that they're clear. As
      opposed to, e.g., Univers, where the contrast between open and close quotes
      can be lost at small sizes.\r\n\r\n@George: The overshoot is perhaps too subtle.
      I admit it's hard for me to notice it on the samples I posted. It's an overshoot
      of \xB110 units with an x-height of 500, which is about the same as similar
      faces (I just measured two at \xB112). However, it's consistent from the hairline
      to black\u2014should it overshoot more in the black weight?\r\n\r\nI haven't
      even begun spacing or kerning yet. I'm dreading it!\r\n\r\nThank you so much,
      everyone\u2014I truly appreciate your input."

  body: "For a first-time effort, in an ambitious genre, that looks surprisingly good!
    You do have experience of bezier curve drawing from before, obviously. It's not
    the most innovative thing but it's a good start \u2013 I think you need to consider
    the personality of the typeface more, what direction you're taking it, because
    especially with the black it seems to hover between some chunky, fun characters
    and some that are more straight-laced.\r\n\r\nIf possible, could you upload a
    PDF specimen? With the inherent limitations of pixelled bitmaps it's hard to tell
    whether something is, say, a major spacing issue/a black blob of a stem width,
    or just a result of the bitmap itself. Not to mention curve wobbliness, hard to
    tell at this magnification level.\r\n\r\n/u/ is, at least, too wide. The black
    /t/ looks somewhat too heavy compare to the other characters, and it's a pity
    (though perhaps unavoidable) that the /y/ loses its connection to the /j/. "

  body: "It's looking solid. But maybe too solid... What I mean is, unless you intend
    this simply as an exercise in learning how to make a polished typeface, it seems
    to need <em>something</em> to stand out for its potential users, to be worth buying,
    or even just selecting. Which is hard to do without gimmickry. But don't fret
    about your work turning out as somewhat of a self-portrait; you're a person, making
    something. Just make sure the <em>objective</em> isn't self-expression, because
    that becomes mere art; you want to make something useful to others.\r\n\r\nBTW,
    I like the mirrored AKA \"rationalist\" (as opposed to 66/99) quotes.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: First reaction I had was "Futura". No comment (for now) on individual letters,
    but the spacing in all weights needs an overhaul. You also need overshoot on round
    letters; I don't see any.

  body: Hang on! The difference between /l/ and the other ascenders really improves
    readability. Accidental though it may be, I think it is a brilliant innovation.
    It distinguishes the forms in a characteristic way and isn't disruptive at all.

    cramped, ascender space) is indeed an unexplored gold-mind! I've actually mentioned
    this as far back as the late 90s. And this could very well be a \"happy accident\",
