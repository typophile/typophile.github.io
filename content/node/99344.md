body: I have 3 of my 4 kids names tattooed on my arm. I want to get the 4th one done,
  but I can't find the font anywhere. My tattoo artist doesn't work at the place he
  used to work at, and that is where I found the font to begin with. I asked him if
  he thought I could get away with going into the place he used to work at, and taking
  a pic of the font board, or something like that, and he said no. So, I'm on the
  hunt. Any idea what this is? I used Identifont, and it came up with a similar one
  (Alys), but it's not exactly the same.
