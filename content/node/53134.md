body: "Hello Typophiles,\r\n\r\nI am working on a print banner for an online music
  store.\r\n\r\nThis banner will primarily function as a roll-out signboard when the
  client sets up a booth at bazaars, etc. Approximate dimensions: 850 x 2000mm (33
  x 78 inches)\r\n\r\nThe brief - Something bright, modern, fun, and visually attractive.
  \r\nKey purpose - Draw customers (youth & young adults) to his booth.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/CN_01_4979.png]\r\n\r\n#1:
  Concepts revolve around a guitar motif. Flames & light streams to convey the effect
  and energy that music can have on your life.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/CN_02_5396.png]\r\n\r\n#2:
  I replaced the client's logo with a more prominent URL bar, with his approval.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/CN_03_4354.png]\r\n\r\n#3:
  Added 3 little icons depicting 'Music', 'Gifts', 'Books' as requested.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/CN_04_4167.png]\r\n\r\n#4:
  My latest design.\r\nI received a call from him today, he now wants it vertically-oriented.\r\nThe
  icons seemed to detract from the overall feel, so I replaced them.\r\nI feel that
  type alone is sufficient in communicating the products.\r\n\r\nType: I've chosen
  Chaparral Bold as I think its friendly appearance works pretty well for the client.\r\n\r\nYour
  thoughts and comments will be appreciated, thanks!\r\n\r\n(First time ever posting
  a project online for critique & comments. A little nerve wrecking!)\r\n"

  body: "Make the b in books clearer.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure about the white behind the
    guitar. It looks like an area of colour has been scraped off and the rather harsh
    white which is meant to be a background element becomes the focus of the whole
    poster.\r\n\r\nI'd get rid of as much of that white area as possible, leaving
    something to outline the guitar, but then have the \"books, music, gifts\" in
    solid white."

  body: "I would avoid breaking the url, especially one that creates a double letter
    when joined, the lower and uppercase oneliner works well.\r\n\r\nBooks music gifts
    does get lost in the background, maybe there is merit in the icon approach, although
    I cannot see them clearly enough on you jpeg.\r\n\r\nDon't flames have a negative
    connotation for Christians? I would imagine, if I were an interested audience
    member, that seeing a guitar burning gives the opposite meaning to the one your
    client wants to promote.\r\n\r\nTim"

  body: "<cite>I\u2019m not sure about the white behind the guitar </cite>\r\n\r\nIt
    functions to help the guitar 'pop' off the background, since the colours are pretty
    complementary. I see your point though. I might try removing it just to see where
    that goes.\r\n\r\n<cite>I would avoid breaking the url, especially one that creates
    a double letter when joined, the lower and uppercase oneliner works well.</cite>\r\n\r\nBreaking
    the URL for the 'headline' allows it to be displayed in a larger size, helping
    to communicate the store's identity from a further distance in a crowded hall.\r\n\r\nBut
    yeah, that is something that still bugs me, which is why I added the complete
    url in #4 - to reinforce the URL as a whole. I hope that mitigates the initial
    break.\r\n\r\nI'll have to think about revising the icons.\r\n\r\n<cite>Don\u2019t
    flames have a negative connotation for Christians?</cite>\r\n\r\nI'm sure they
    may have a negative connotation, especially for the more conservative set. The
    client's audience (with this banner) is primarily youths to young adults who are
    fans of rock music. We believe they are more likely to associate flames with passion
    and energy, than fire and brimstone. :D\r\n\r\nJustin and Tim, thanks for taking
    time to share your thoughts.\r\n\r\nCheers!"

  body: "I agree with not breaking up the url. I understand the thought behind visibility
    across distance, but bigger doesn't always mean better. Breaking up the url starts
    to diminish the recognition of it being a url in the first place. You want to
    keep the message simple, but breaking it up makes the person read the two parts,
    then mentally reconnect them on their own, it's not intuitive, even with the reenforcing
    of the complete url below it. You could also use a headline to promote the site
    instead of the url (i.e \"Buy your music from the comfort of your home\").\r\n\r\nAs
    for the white mess, it doesn't help the guitar stand out (I hate the word \"pop\"),
    from the background because it actually overpowers the guitar. If the guitar has
    a black outline or something to that effect, then the shape recognition would
    be stronger and it would cause more contrast.\r\n\r\nHaving the products offered
    layered so far in the back makes them become part of the background graphics,
    and no longer selling points. You could also use those with the icons for reenforcement.\r\n\r\nOverall,
    it's a little busy, you may want to remove some of the additional wisps of white
    in the background. I think the forefront ones work well, but the background ones
    start to over saturate the piece. You might also want to consider loosing the
    burgundy ring of fire.\r\n\r\n\r\nI'm sorry about your brief, I wish people knew
    how to write those. White, made of paper, and something you wipe you arse with
    doesn't tell me it's toilet paper, it could be anything."
