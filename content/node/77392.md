body: "I have quite 'weird' problem with my font. For some reason one kerning pair
  (as far as i know) is not working in Adobe CS3 software (indesign, photoshop etc.).
  Still its perfectly fine in numerous other softwares (MS Word, NeoOffice, Linotype
  fontexplorer etc.). The problem appears both in \"class kerning\" and \"flat kerning
  mode\".\r\n\r\nThe problematic kerning-pair is \"Va\" so it's too visible in display
  sizes to ignore.\r\n\r\nI've attached detailed picture comparing the pair \"Va\"
  and \"VA\" in multiple softwares. \r\n\r\nI hope someone knows something similar
  and can help me on this.\r\n\r\nThanks"
