body: "I'm sure this has been asked before so feel free to point me to an existing
  thread.\r\n\r\nObviously there are critical ratios, cap height/x-height, overhang
  etc, but these ratios can exist at different <em>sizes</em>.\r\ne.g. 700/500 = 750/536
  approx.\r\n\r\nI have <em>some</em> experience drawing type, but it occurred to
  me whilst starting a new design that there might be some advantage to drawing at
  a specific size and I would like to be aware of this at the outset to avoid possible
  problems later on.\r\n\r\nI'm inclined to draw large on the face as I have more
  options for stem widths etc.\r\n\r\nA little bit of guidance, what to watch out
  for &c. would be much appreciated.\r\nThanks in advance\r\n\r\nAndrew"

    for the sake of not confusing end users it\u2019s probably best to keep your design
    within that range. People start to get confused when your twelve points looks
    like any other font at fourteen."

    that at the top) and fill the rest with top of ascenders to bottom of descenders.
    And it's good to allow the cap accents to float above the top of the EM.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "You leave space within the EM above the top of the ascenders and below the
    bottom of the descenders, to avoid collisions in the case of flush setting (plus
    to meet the size expectations of users, as James said). The sum of these two \"blank\"
    spaces is the talus. It's not a common term, but \"internal leading\" is cumbersome
    and potentially confusing.\r\n\r\nAlso, it's smart to leave a greater proportion
    of the talus on top, because ascenders are much more frequent than descenders,
    hence benefit from the greater room to breathe.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: Right, that makes sense, I shall use the term from now on. What did you mean
    by 1%? Sorry to be trivial, thanks for your help!
