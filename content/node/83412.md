  it just me or is the A just a tiny little bit thinner than the rest?\r\n\r\nI was
  going for something forward looking but a bit restrained and elegant, on the type.
  Something futuristic but with its feet on the ground.\r\n\r\nNeed a better look

    have a look at the right leg which I think is the culprit there.\r\n\r\nThe symbol
    seems disconnected-but-not-disconnected enough from the lettering: There's a danger
    someone will read it as a badly kerned /OABIC/. But in any case its strict geoetry
    clashes with the more calligraphic wordmark. Does that lettering style read sufficiently
    futuristic, I wonder?"

    initially. I'm still working on that too.\r\n\r\nI showed everything I had to
    the client and she said she liked both these elements; we agreed on combining
    them. Actually, she seemed to really like these letters and added \u201CI never
    thought I could like letters!\u201D, which was pretty nice and made me quite happy.\r\n\r\nI
    also thought about the symbol being mistaken for a letter; I might develop some
    solution to that as well. But really, my main concern with this right now, at
    this stage, was the spacing of the letters.\r\n\r\nQuite perceptive, Birdseeding;
    thanks for your valuable input!"

    For a logo in general? For being paired with that symbol?\r\n\r\nI usually have
    a tendency to draw letters too thick and/or with too much contrast, so in this
    case I thought I had to fight that, since I wanted something with an elegant and
    somewhat/somehow cultivated look to it (we are talking about people with advanced
    studies) but still forward looking and not too contrastive (so it worked at smaller
    sizes). Since I'm aware that I always tend to draw bold letters\u2026 I thought
    I had to stop being afraid that it would be too thin.\r\n\r\nI tried looking at
    this at small sizes and I thought it worked."

  body: You should consider drawing different versions for different sizes in usage,
    eg relatively thinner lines for a larger size (signage) and ergo thicker lines
    for smaller applications (business card). In smaller versions you might want to
    lessen the amount of vertical lines in the round shape.

    being very close to the blue in its brightness.\r\nDid you try a darker grey?
    IMO, it would contrast the blue better.\r\nI\u2019d maybe also increase the gap
    between the circle and ABIC.\r\nAnd I second that it is a bit thin, in this rather
    light blue it risks to vanish in smaller sizes. But as Bert said, different optical
    sizes could solve that, if you want to keep it \u2018light\u2019."

    on considering all that later. Different, so called optical versions might be
    a good idea. Everything is still subject to changes, here. It's just an advanced
    sketch.\r\n\r\nBut what about the spacing between letters? Am I doing it right
    (or close enough)? That was my main concern, right now, and the main reason why
    I turned to Typophile\u2026 I'm still a bit insecure as to how well I kern."

  body: "OK, re kerning: you need to balance the inner white space of a glyph with
    the white space between two glyphs, and this for all of the glyphs (elements)
    of \u2014 in your case \u2014 a logo.\r\n\r\nAn /I/ has no inner space. In this
    case /A/ and /B/ and /C/ have comparable inner spaces. This allows us to balance
    /B/ and /C/ with /I/ first (easier!). \r\n\r\nOur first conclusion is that BI
    needs more space (wider kerning). Start with adding half the width of /I/ (cover
    the rest of your design). Adjust until looking balanced. Looking at it in a mirror
    and/or upside down helps with evaluating what you are doing.\r\n\r\nNow do the
    same with IC, with /B/ being visible. The space between /I/ and /C/ will be almost
    like it is currently, I think.\r\n\r\nThen you add /A/ to the equation, and lastly
    the ball shape.\r\n\r\nUsing this inner space vs intra-space equalisation process
    will demonstrate that lighter cuts (eg Thin, etc) need more kerning than bold
    cuts (those have relatively small inner space). \r\n\r\nWhen you want tighter
    kerning all over the flow of the logo will change, where the sides of the glyphs
    kind of start to tear at their neighbours. That may be an effect you are aiming
    for, making it a design decision as any decision that is contrary to harmony.\r\n\r\nBTW:
    I may sound pedantic, telling you how to to it, rather than what, but that\u2019s
    what teaching is all about\u2026 : )"

  body: "No, that's fine! Quite helpful!\r\n\r\nI've had my hand at designing typefaces
    \u2013 just \u201Cfor kicks\u201D \u2013 and I am aware that seeing things mirrored
    and upside down helps a lot; if anything it helps us register the shapes more
    than letters, which is quite positive for the task. Hadn't thought of doing that
    here, though; will do.\r\n\r\nI'm also aware of the <cite>notion</cite> of balancing
    inner and outer white spaces; actually <cite>doing</cite> it, though, is a whole
    other thing. Mainly because my \u2013 admittedly tiny \u2013 experience with that
    is that I end up with text a bit <cite>too</cite> spaced out, which seems fine
    for text at (quite) small sizes, but not so at so called \u201Cregular\u201D text
    sizes and certainly not above that. When I look around I don't really notice that
    this notion is always and thoroughly applied in all typefaces; and I feel it might
    get a bit overstated/overestimated around here, at times.\r\n\r\nThe way I did
    it was I kind of eyeballed it keeping in mind that this would be something of
    a display kern and not a small text kern and also keeping in mind that we are
    talking about thin glyphs. I still am a bit afraid to trust my eyes, but I've
    been having these moments where I think my eyes were spot on and I should trust
    them more often. :P\r\n\r\nWill further work on this, then.\r\n\r\nThank you kindly."

    go with a heavier or lighter outline to the circle to avoid the similarity to

    and I see what you mean, Bert; I'll remember that now, as I finalize the job.
