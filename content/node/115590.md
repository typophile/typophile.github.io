  Last night it was trending worldwide on Twitter, was featured on the front page
  of Mashable, Reddit, Hacker News, The Verge, everything! It has been downloaded
  well over 10,000 times in the last 24 hours, and there are an average rate of 800
  \ people viewing the site at any one time.\r\n\r\nI created the font in TypeTool,
  the cut down version of Font Lab. It was a two year side-project and I put a hell
  of a lot of work into it, but it needs a final polish from someone far more experienced
  than I am.\r\n\r\nMy name is Craig Rozynski. I've been working as a graphic designer
  for 15 years. 7 of those as a freelancer. I know how to run a project and you'll
  be in good hands. I am looking for someone to:\r\n\r\n1) Improve the kerning overall,
  and\r\n2) Optimise the appearance of the font on Windows.\r\n3) Perform an overall
  quality check.\r\n\r\nIf you're interested in collaborating on this now world-famous
  (!) font with me. Please send me an email at craig at craigrozynski.com with a cost
  (or request for  more information if you're unsure), a turn around time, and any
  other relevant details.\r\n\r\nThanks! \r\nCraig Rozynski\r\n\r\n"

    of unwarranted disdain for a wildly popular work that I suspect he receives no

      our careers that we'd rather forget. Imagine if that work was was still being
      paraded around the world twenty years later?\r\n\r\nI have absolutely no ill
      will toward Vincent. The response to comicneue.com has been almost all positive,
      although it has caused some ill-willed @ replies towards him on Twitter, which
      is a shame.\r\n\r\nPerhaps I'm a little over-ambitious, but I would like to
      see Comic Neue become a redeemed version of Comic Sans. It needs a little more
      work, but the world (the online one at least) has shown overwhelmingly over
      the last two days that the interest is there. I just need a professional typographer
      to help turn it into a viable option for libraries and foundries like Typekit
      to take onboard.\r\n\r\nWho is going to help me? It's paid work!"

    but at least they changed the name.\r\nYour derivative work is piggy-backing on
    the Comic Sans design and its name, which AFAIK is a registered trademark. Aren\u2019t
    you concerned at the prospect of legal action?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    but anyone can be sued for any reason. And even if the judge tosses out the case,
    it's a giant hassle and you'd probably have to hire a lawyer."
