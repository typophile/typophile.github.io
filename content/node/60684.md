  \r\nI'm guessing the 3-like mark is short for \"ue\"? and the crossbar?"

  body: "\"quibuscumque\"?\r\n\r\nDo you have a date for this?\r\n\r\nI heard it was
    not unusual for typesetters to cramp up a few letters when really pressed for
    space. In this case, I would guess the q bar is shorthand for 'qui' (with some
    imagination), and your guess of the '3' like glyph for 'que' could be right. My
    guess of the tilde as a suppressed 'm' comes from this phrase\r\n\r\n<cite>Unde
    facta fide de iure in hac p[ar]te requisita petit pars ista Jus et ius[ti]ciam
    in omnibus p[re]miss[is] et singulis et ea conc[er]nentibus <strong>quibuscu[m]q[ue]</strong></cite>\r\n\r\n[[http://freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~malchist/mypage23.htm|found
    with \"Google quibuscu\"]]\r\n\r\nThe extra large 'H' below would indicate this
    particular person cared about proper justification :-)"

    I spotted a pretty \"connected\" one in an italic, in a book printed in 1543:

    the tilde as suppressed \"m\", as Theunis mentions.)\r\n\r\nI thought the \"q\"
    with crossbar was \"quo\", going to go look for that now\u2026"

  body: Incidentally, Matthew Carter created a set of these kinds of obsolete Latin
    ligatures and abbreviations, called Manutius Latin, as a supplement to Miller
    for a special project for the UCLA. (Yes, a Scotch Roman style -- somewhat amusing.)
