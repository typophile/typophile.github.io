body: Needed for a client who likes it. The font doesn&#39;t have to match the typeface
  &#40;as I believe it was a custom creation&#41;, just something similar. I think
  it&#39;s some kind of Nouveau face, but I can&#39;t find anything that even resembles
  it. Can anyone help? <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/40694.jpg"

    the RUMOURS part.
