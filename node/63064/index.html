This is a logo for contest. What do you think?

Specifically, regarding AIGA's position that the spec work is damaging to the clients. Following AIGA's logic, BrandStack is as harmful to the clients as the 99designs. Yet no one here or on other logo-related sites calling to boycott it.

		<div class="commentbody">I can understand both sides.

The professional would see at design contests as an easy (and cheap) way for 'clients' to choose the best design(s) from a whole catalogue of 'free' works, hence eliminating the professional consultation. It sucks.

The amateur designer sees design contests as a way to test their work against like-minded amateur designers, and to build on their own competency/skills level in designing.

Perhaps, a solution could be tutoring from the professional to the amateur? Takes time and considerable effort, of course.

A professional could come up with a logo/design challenge and entries/submissions by amateurs are critique upon.. Amateur receives feedback required. In the long run, professional protects his rice-bowl..?

I know that contests sucks but I need some feedback on my works. Contests are opportunities to gain this feedback and become a better designer.

But could anybody tell me something about my logo proposal? I am looking for critiques here, hehe ;)</div>

Why don't you make up fake businesses and design for them than put them on here for critique. I think it'll be more beneficial than doing spec work, which really is never a good idea.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Spec work is an extremely touchy subject, and you should in absolutely no way attempt to learn anything from a real design process through these "contests." It's said ad infinitum why you shouldn't: you lose the chance to consult a client, the potential to be ripped off is extremely high, and you usually get less than what you're really worth (if you get paid at all).

If you want feedback, why not try sites like Logopond, deviantART, Flickr... the list goes on and on. What's even more enraging is that I just found <a href="http://www.crowdspring.com/projects/graphic_design/logo/emergien_logo_logotype_design/details">the contest on Crowdspring</a>, and they're only offering $400? Seriously? A global firm whose image needs desperately to appeal to investors and businesses of all kinds, while showing dozens of personality traits... $400. That's the mark they will use for the rest of their existence as the face of their company, and you think that costs $400? That's not even one month's rent for you, even if you live in an efficiency apartment.

Anyways, you posted up your design to be critiqued. I think that the type looks very dated. And why did you break the pattern of shapes at the bottom of the "e"? The first version possesses very muted and dull colors in my eyes, while the second... I like the cyan, but why the gradient? It looks like it's casting a shadow of doubt on the mark.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">In the first two images, the first thing that catches my eye is how busy the e logo is, but that is taken care of for me by the second two which just use gradients. The shapes could be a bit much, but it seems like the alternating colors in the first two images are what make it busy. Maybe it's just me; I AM a huge fan of gradients. It's a great design though! I especially like the font used in the name of the company.
