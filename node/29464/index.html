<div class="post-content e-content" itemprop=articleBody>hi everyone,
i am designing a logo for a small company called Analysis Factory which provides dashboards to other companies for quick data visualization; i.e. to monitor the finances of the company. The clients can update an Excel spreadsheet, and the dashboard shows them the current charts and graphs in an interactive dashboard.
(http://analysisfactory.com/solutions.htm)
i have done a logo that they immediately liked, so now i am trying to narrow it down and work out the details. please review the 4 options (4 pages in various colors) and offer some suggestions for improvement. as far as kerning, i know i still need to do that!
the client wants a stacked version and a horizontal version.</div>

<div class=commentbody>I really like the mark. Nice, simple, and conceptually strong. I'd vote for the one sans-box as I don't see the box really adding anything.
The type is nice too. Is that Helvetica Rounded? It's trendy, but I have a soft spot for it.
What I don't like is the balance between the mark and the type.
In your first set, the mark is too large in relation to the type. In your second set, it's too small in relation to the type. I think you need to aim for something in the middle. Also, perhaps give the mark a bit more space in relation to the type. Give it some breathing room.

<div class=commentbody>Are you locked up with the typeface? When looking at your small jpg's seemed good at first glance. But after I saw it was helvetica rounded it just felt a little too playful for a serious company. Every time I see helvetica rounded I think of "playschool" or toys in general.
If you are locked up on the typeface I might try to match the roundness of your icon corners, meaning make the icon rounder. If you are not locked up you can try another typeface that matches that shape, a bit more squared but round. Or you could even bring regular sans typeface and then play with making it's corners rounder. Could be interesting and I would try a wide typeface to match the width of the "F" on the icon or again try to match the icon to your typeface.
Overall looks interesting, play more with the type, stack it, try "TitleCase" since it looks like you have an Upercase "F' in your icon instead of lowercase etc.
When you place the icon next to the icon horizontally it reads "Fanalisisfactory" be careful with that, perhaps stacked on the side but align the bottom to the "x" height of your type.
Good work, hope this helps.

<div class=commentbody>Great work! I love the AF icon. In line with the rest of the commentary about type selection, I'd like to suggest a few in order of preference (ALL CAPS):
1. Bankrobbed
2. Chalet (70's)
3. Eurostile (I can't believe I'm suggesting this, but I am)

<div class=commentbody>Thank you, guys. i agree with many of your comments. VAG Rounded is correct.
I feel that Chalet is a bit too dated-looking. this company is modern, uses new technologies, and i think it should have a look bordering on futuristic... Not futuristic, but also not retro.
They have come back to tell me that they do like page 2, which Ratbaggy noted above as working well.
Below i am attaching some more font explorations (I'm not telling you which font is which because it shouldn't matter, as long as it works!).
I still think VAG Rounded works well.
As far as color, they like either red or blue. which do you guys prefer and why?

<div class=commentbody>Like the mark, however I think the bars are a little too close together. At small sizes they almost run together, forming a blob. Carefully adding more space would help.
I like the lowercase VAG Rounded the best out of all the fonts presented. Another alternative might be Omnes Bold.</div>

<div class=commentbody>I like the marque, not sure about the type, do you think the marque (icon or whatever you like to call it) would benefit from being made optically symmetrical – ie. the side angles appear to differ and give the illusion of (a slight) perspective if the right side of the F was extended out fractionally it might help, then perhaps introduce type that echoes the angles of the marque to create a sense of unity.</div>

<div class=commentbody>I really like the icon/mark, but also agree with above stated comments that it could benefit from some cleaning up and maybe adding some space between the bars of the mark.
Also, regarding type, it might be an idea to use uppercase A and F and the rest lowercase (Analysis Factory), maybe this creates more unity between type and mark (consisting of uppercase). Just a thought, though...
I still don't like VAG (to playfull) but I can't think of something better. Maybe a Din-like character?

<div class=commentbody>I agree with about the VAG. Im not a big fan of the rounded letter forms, and agree that they come across as a bit playful. I think the mark is strong. Id like to see it matching the strokes of the accompanying letters, and to see it with squared endings, and the same with a new lineale. Maybe try it all monospaced with the letters. . . just ideas, its early and the coffee has not kicked in yet.
The mark and logotype look good reduced from across the room, however up close and personal it seems to have a totally different feel.

<div class=commentbody>I'm a little reluctant to post this because my recommendation to consider Bankrobbed may have been disregarded, but since there still seems to be some controversy over type selection I am doing it anyway. The letterforms seem to immitate the shapes from the icon, making it an appropriate selection. Even if you aren't interested in using Bankrobbed, it may drive you to consider an alternative that works well with your icon.

You're right. I had no idea that font would be so hard to access. I've had the font for over 10 years and quite frankly, I don't remember where I got it. It is a Bitstream font and I have put a call into them to find out if it is obtainable.
Kco:
You're definitely right. If Lorenk decides to use this typeface or another that is similar, the mark should be positioned differently. Maybe just raise it a little (bottom of the mark in line with the crossbar of the "A") and nudge it a bit to the right so the spacing look right.

<div class=commentbody>Whatever font you choose, most of the strokes need to be the same thickness.
VAG is not trendy enough. It is too soft. There is a better chance Bryant will be usable longer than VAG.
Also, keep the lower-case because the icon is so strong and straight-forward, the type needs to be 2nd to the icon.</div>

<div class=commentbody>I think it's great. I like red better; it's vital and implies the immediacy of the data being monitored. And the combination of reds is sophisticated.
I agree that the type must be kept lowercase, and I don't think any of the suggested replacements yet work as well as your original choice.
A few things I might suggest: For the unframed stacked version, you might try shifting the type to the left a little to align the division between words with the corresponding division in the mark. For the unframed horizontal version, swap the words' colors, diminishing the "Fanalysis" problem and helping to associate each word with its counterpart in the mark.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Forget my suggestion of Bryant. I didn't have time to think about it thoroughly.
Below is the best thing I could think of. Foundry Monoline (http://www.foundrytypes.co.uk/foundry_monoline/monoline_medium.html). It is similar to Eurostile, but better (in my opinion). It's strokes are fairly equal and balances well with the icon. It is structured but has slight curve like the icon. It also isn't distracting from the logo.
I would customize the font by taking the tail out of the "t" and maybe making the stem and descender in the "y" straight to match the icon.
You need to move the icon from the center. Everything is so symetric and boring. Moving it to the left gives it energy and motion.

<div class=commentbody>FYI, Tim:
I got word from Bitstream about Bankrobbed and they said that they were not familiar with it. Someone probably manipulated Bank Gothic and neglected to remove the Bitstream copyright. Now, I'm really curious about where it came from.
Since it's tagged with a Bitstream copyright but isn't a Bitstream font, I'm assuming it's shareware and will email it to anyone who's interested in having it. Any takers?
