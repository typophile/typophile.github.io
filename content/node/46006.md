  after I realized I never had a card to give anyone. I am going to change this when
  I put together my final portfolio together next year. What I am looking for is a
  general critique or suggestions for me to emphasize my concept. Color suggestions
  would be nice too. Thanks. \r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/logo_3576.jpg]"

    a little stronger, more expressive. I believe it may not work well on smaller
    sizes.\r\nI like the type and the colors though.\r\n\r\nCheers.\r\nPedro Peixoto"

  body: It doesn't read as rb to me, but rather 7-raised hyphen-0. Consistency would
    dictate you'd have the shadow line on the right side of the b's ascender, too.

    when I read your name.  Are you just fiddling around with this on the computer,
    or are you starting from pencil and paper sketches?  \r\n\r\n--\r\nNick Hladek"

  body: "it was from pad and paper. i hardly do anything on the computer until finals.
    the only reason this was done was cause of time restraints. I kinda wanted to
    see how people see it. Most actually see the rb, but its good to have outside
    opinions and I think I will keep it in the scrapbook. \r\n\r\nI'm obviously trying
    to emphasize the white space, but I really want to show the structural quality
    of type by giving it that 3d appearance. But it sounds like it may be a bit too
    subtle. Back to the drawing board. lol "

    this seems pretty underwhelming. I''m interested to see what else you come up
    with. '
