body: "Chomsky is released by T26 today. This is my first commercial typeface, a fun
  typeface to play with, hence the great family price-cut. A mini site is scheduled
  to come real soon.\r\nhttp://www.t26.com/fonts/5886-Chomsky\r\n\r\nA PDF specimen
  is also available at my site:\r\nhttp://merdekaataoemati.com/downloads/chomsky_specimen_latest.pdf\r\n\r\nCheers!"

    The P22 site really doesn\u2019t handle chromatic fonts well."

  body: "The non-regular weights are only supplemental, they're merely the regular
    weight with expanded contours. They're meant to be used as a background layer
    for the regular weight, as illustrated in [[http://www.t26.com/uploaded_files/0000/0058/Specimen_Image.png|this
    image]] (I know I should've uploaded a decent PDF specimen by now).\r\n\r\nWhat
    do you mean about the P22 site?"

  body: Yes, I know what you mean. But, as I've described in [[http://www.t26.com/fonts/5886-Chomsky|T26's
    page]] they're never intended to be set in small size. :D
