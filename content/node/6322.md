  body: If it&#39;s a logo, it&#39;s likely not a typeface. However, it reminds me
    of JFP&#39;s <a href="http://www.typofonderie.com/alphabets/view/Anisette" target="_blank">Anisette</a>.

  body: It reminds me of lettering by Knud V. Engelhardt. <BR> <BR><u>Edit:</u> Hjerteforeningen
    was founded 31 years after his <BR>death, but I still believe it could be based
    upon his work. <BR>In recent years danish design firms like Kontrapunkt and <BR>e-types
    have &#34;reinvented&#34; the style of Engelhardt.

  body: Exactly, nicolai it really does. It could be the heart that&#39;s making me
    see an obvious connection. <BR>It also could be something of Gunnar Billmann Petersens
    work although I don&#39;t recall having seen this logo in the great book about
    him. And the heart is not very him. <BR>It is probably a take on Knud V. Engelhardt&#39;s
    style by some of the new bigshots in danish graphic design as you mentioned.

  body: Thanks, Nicolai. I&#39;d love to see some of his work if you have some time;
    the letterforms in that logo made me curious.
