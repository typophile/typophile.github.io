body: "Some words start with an apostrophe, indicating a contraction: the \u201960s,
  \u2019twas, the \u2019n\u2019 in \u201CFish \u2019n\u2019 Chips,\u201D and so forth.
  Sometimes you need to set these within quotation marks; for example, if you were
  quoting the first line of \u201CJabberwocky\u201D:\r\n\r\n\u201C\u2019Twas brillig,
  and the slithy toves\u2026\u201D\r\n\r\nTwo questions:\r\n\r\n1. The manual for
  my word processor rightfully rails against straight quotes, <i>except</i> in the
  \u2019Twas case above. It gives an actual example which suggests the use of a single
  typewriter quote in that particular instance. I wrote them to protest, and they
  were very amenable to removing the recommendation if I could cite a reference. The
  Chicago Manual of Style says nothing about setting an initial apostrophe in quotes,
  and nor does Dowding that I could see. My copy of Bringhurst is on loan. Can anyone
  point me to a specific published discussion of this case? Where would they have
  gotten the idea that a typewriter quote was OK?\r\n\r\n2. How would you suggest
  setting an initial apostrophe in quotes? With a thin space before, to visually distinguish
  it? Suggestions welcomed.\r\n"
