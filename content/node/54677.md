  above the lower case i and j?\r\n\r\nI've been asked if there was an \"official\"
  term and I know of none. \r\n\r\nPerhaps we can invent a new \"official\" term.
  Then we can claim special knowledge of it.\r\n\r\nAnd to make this even more open-ended,
  I want to pass along the fact that here at Megacorporation, the registration mark
  is commonly referred to as an \"R-ball\". For some reason, however, a copyright
  symbol is not referred to as a \"C-ball.\"\r\n\r\nKristin "

    the letter, ex. i. \r\nThe smallest letter of the Greek alphabet. \r\nAn iota;
    a point; a tittle; the smallest particle.\r\n\r\nAlthough a Jot usually is referring
    to the whole character."

    and jargon mavens.\r\n\r\nI mean: why should we have to say or write \"tittlelessi\"
    when we can use \"dotlessi\"? For another thing, \"tittlelessi\" looks like the
    name of a Greek or Bulgarian cheese I could buy at Spiro's up there on University
    Avenue.\r\n\r\nI had not bothered to see who made that first post until I saw
    Ricardo refer to \"Megacorporation.\" Then I knew it was you. Cheers from across
