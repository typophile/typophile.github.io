<div class="post-content e-content" itemprop=articleBody>Hello,
I'm making a logo for a rock band called Rock Fuel. It's not going as smoothly as I thought it would. It's actually pretty difficult.
I've picked out three basic sketches from all my wierd attempts. I used Helvetica in number 2 and 3 just because I don't have to think about the type, just about how to edit it and possible symbols. Wilhelm Klingspor Gotish is the type that think fits best to the namne Rock Fuel at the moment.
1
Here I first picked a type that I thought would be suitable and then tried some variations with and without symbols. This is the one that I feel most confident that could end up as a nice logo, or some version of it. I just haven't come that far with it yet.
2
This is just a test with an old gaspump and how it could fit together with a text.
3 a and b
Just tried some variations of how I could have it just as text and no symbols. Used Helvetica again, it would ofcourse be some other type, I guess I pick Helvetica because it's comfortable to work with.
Any and all feedback welcome, thanks.
Peter</div>

<div class=commentbody>and their music is similar to that of The Hellacopters, Backyard Babies and Buck Cherry.
I haven't been able to listen to any of their tracks because they are in the studio right now recording.</div>

<div class=commentbody>1 - Looks like "cock fuel" - probably not the image the band wants. Even though the blackletter form of 'r' is correct, you'll probably want to cheat it to look more like a conventional 'r', or even capitalize "Rock".
2 - Maybe put the fuel tank before "ROCK FUEL" or even find a way to integrate it into the 'R'.
3a/b - I like 3b the best out of all of the options. It definitely has that spray-painted, MTV Punk'd vibe to it. Was there any reasoning behind flipping the 'e'? It looks kind of arbitrary to me. I'd explore this version further.

<div class=commentbody>I flipped the e in 3a in illustrator to make it look a little less ordinary. When I continued on it in photoshop it lost it's puprose, should've flipped it back.
I guess the band fits wuite well into the MTV image and the type of music you see there. I'll wait and see what the band thinks. I have to find another type the helvetica though, I don't like the r and the f.
I was thinking about making some sort of combination between 1 and 3b.</div>

<div class=commentbody>1 does indeed read as 'cock fuel', which is quite funny in itself, but probably not what they want. You could always try to chop off the bottom stroke. But apart from that, I think no.1 is at the moment the best one. Though the blackletter is probably a bit cliché for a rock band.
I'm not really feeling the grunge distressed effect on the type of the other ones. I don't think that alone can make a logo. But I have something against those distressed things in general, hehe.
And you defenitely want to lose Helvetica. ;)
You could try to integrate that fuelpump into the shield of the blackletter logo, instead of the thing (what is it?) it has in it now, to let it contrast with the lettershapes. That could give it a nice spin.

I tried some variations with a fuelpump inside the guitar pick and having the guitarpick being partly a fuel pump. Nothing really caught my interest, what I have there now is a combo of r and f from the type.
Those links are GREAT. I was experimenting with a type that looked a little like the one on the Greater Penn can. This is definetley an image that I think could work for the band. The colors on the those cans are just great, I can see the cd cover being set in a similar theme.
Thanks a lot.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Hello,
It took almost three weeks before the hole band had the cahnce to take a look at the three versions I made. They liked the pick and star idea in version one and the gas pump and general idea in version two. They thought version three was too much punk so I'm scrapping that.
Yesterday I made a combination of version one and two. Inspired by the vintage gas cans. I put the gas pump inside the pick, I think I'll tweak that some more though. Gonna see if I can come up with something else as well. I like the black/red/yellow theme, maybe add some dirt and stuff.
Just give me your two cents worth on the this version. In the bottom one I added a text that would be a album name.
thanks
peter

<div class=commentbody>I didn't see the gas pump or a pick (and I'm a guitarist). Most picks have two rounded corners and one pointy one - more of an isosceles triangle than an equilateral one.
Maybe use the nozzle of the gas pump rather than the pump itself, or a Jerry can with a spout.
I don't get the typeface choice. It says neither "Rock" nor "Fuel" to me. This would be a great opportunity to use an old-timey sign painter style script. Check out <a href="http://www.houseind.com/index.php?page=showfont&id=23" target=_blank>House</a> or <a href=http://letterheadfonts.com/ target=_blank>Letterhead</a> for some options (watch out for Letterhead's DRM). I'd even grunge up the whole thing to make it look like peeling paint.
The colours work well. Very gas-station-like.
Overall, could use some tweaking, but I like the direction.

<div class=commentbody>haha, big thumb, that's perfect. I'm gonna save this version for a time when I need a big thumb in a logo.
I thought it looked more like a parking meter.
I'll try some other combinations, made some tests in the beginning with a jerry can but didn't get anywhere. I'll have to make some more with this concept.
Maybe an extra bold rockwell. I'd love to get some House or Letterhead fonts but I have no way of paying for them, I don't have a credit card. I should be able to apply for one soon though. Some of the fonts at Letterhead look like they would work very well with my idea.
and I'll definetley grunge it up at some point.
thanks, gonna work on my other logos for a couple of days and get back to this later.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Changed the font and redrew the pick. The jerry can didn't really work, neither did the gas pump.
Started thinking about those warning signs you se on fuel trucks and gasoline cans. Fire warning and explosion warning and so forth. Started working with that instead.
Im pretty satisfied with the type but not with the symbol, have to work on that some more, it needs to be more powerful and striking, it's too simple.
I'm stuck right now so I thought I'd post an update. :)

<div class=commentbody>geez...I feel silly (dirty? disturbed?) saying this, but my first impression was that the star appears anthropomorphised and the black 'fuel' is in a rather suggestive spot.
Yea, it's monday AM...probably just the coffee talking...

<div class=commentbody>Hello,
I like the direction of the three first versions. It feels like it's more toward the old car/gas station concept. The two last ones is some more ellaboration on the varning sign idea but I think it's too much chips (http://www.taffel.fi/) then old gas station.
Grateful for more feedback.

<div class=commentbody>I think that I'll put the serifs back on four but make them stand out a little less then what they do on the original type. I quite like the sans serifness but it might be a little too stiff for a rockband. I think I'll work some more at 1-3 also.
The band wants an update on friday so I'll work some more on it tomorrow and on friday morning. It's just that it takes forever for them to get back to me.</div>

<div class=commentbody>I'm still seeing a bit of a thumb, but not nearly as much and likely only because I had it in my head from the version before.
I think the pump is maybe missing just one more element to really make it say 'aha! Pump!' Maybe an hint of numbers/gauges on the front. Or maybe terminate the red outline on one side with a spigot.
Some other thoughts (that may or may not work):
- Try double/tripling the size of the pick in relation to the type.
- Put the type on a curve
- I like the slam serif version...maybe emphasize the serifs a bit more?
In otherwords, it's definitely getting there but is perhaps still a bit static in its layout (at least for a rock band).

<div class=commentbody>I still have the spigot from the very first version so I'll try and add that and see how it looks. Also the band had four members so I could add four ones, 1234 or just four |.
As for the size I've had it a lot bigger but I always end up making it smaller, the symbol doesn't feel strong enough to be so much bigger yet.
Uncertain about the type on a curve but I'll give it a try and see how it looks.
The old oil can pictures I got in another thread had type with very stiff and long serifs, looked odd on some but very good on others. I'll make them stand out more on this type and see how it looks.
I want the logo too be a little stiff and static but not too much.
thanks

<div class=commentbody>It's getting there.
I like this version a lot.
I'm going to try the peeling paint idea that someone mentioned. Making the text look like it's been painted black, peels away revealing another colour underneath. Could look kinda neat.
Tried adding the numbers where they should be, indicating how much you fuel you taken but it didn't look right so I moved down under star so it looks more like a serial number.

<div class=commentbody>I'm still seeing the thumb. Maybe put a round top on the pump like this: http://www.antiquevend.com/images/gaspumps/RoarWithGilmore/Front.jpg

<div class=commentbody>Thanks,
Tried it with the round top but it doesn't really work, doesn't fit with the pick. It kinda adds a comic relief to it that I don't want.
Showed it to some people that hasn't seen the thumb version and I asked them directly if they can make out a thumb from it, didn't get any yeses.
I can't really make out a clear thumb myself either. Gonna work on the website for a couple of days and then try the peeling paint idea and see if I can see a thumb then.

<div class=commentbody>So whats the big problem if it looks like a thumb AND a gas pump? I mean really is not the guitar pick a replacement for the thumb? I see you get the best of both worlds no matter how the public sees it Pump or Thumb works for me and think it's quite clever.</div>

<div class=commentbody>yeah I'm sticking with this. Going to redo the grunge bit but otherwise it stays as is. Sent it to the band and if they like it then it's done.
thanks for all your feedback.
Going to post the link to the website when I'm done with it at the end of august.

<div class=commentbody>This is really great. Good work, also I don't think the thumb is a problem. I only saw it once it was mentioned. I think logomotive has a good point too.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Peter, I would like to make one little suggestion you might want to try. Take the Slab Serifs of the type and eliminate the 1 point on each giving the serifs a 45 degree point. So instead you have angled serifs which will compliment the mark and give more of a "ROCK" feel. Just something to consider. I think it's FANATSTIC so far. Like Litera said "Thumbs up" ha ha.</div>
