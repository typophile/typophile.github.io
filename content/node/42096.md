body: "Hey folks, just wanted to introduce myself. I'm a full-time designer and have
  been for several years, but my degree is in architecture and as such I've missed
  out on some design fundamentals. I'm really wanting to refine my design skills,
  especially with regards to type, and I've been lurking here for a bit and decided
  to jump in and start posting. Hoping to learn a lot from y'all, I have already :)\r\n"
