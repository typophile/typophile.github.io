  body: "Totally agree with skyfein. Was about to say the same while searching for
    some alternatives. So I guess a manually slanted Meta (or [[http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/fontfont/ff_meta_correspondence_pro/|Meta
    Correspondence]] to get such a /i, probably not enough bold though) with a custom
    /a would get you pretty close (if not matching).\r\nSome alternatives: [[http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/fontfont/ff_unit_pro_collection/|FF
    Unit]] (right /i but too much condensed), [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/fontfont/signa-pro/|FF
    Signa]] (Condensed), [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/akko/|Akko]] (spurless
    /a), [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/mti/neo-sans/|Neo Sans]] (rounded), [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/fontfont/max/|FF
    Max]] (spurless /a), [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/parachute/pf-beau-sans-pro/|Beau
    Sans]] (spurless /a, slightly rounded) and [[http://typecache.com/font-clusters/04/|a

  body: "Thanks for your responses, I find that FF Meta Correpondence Pro (even Web)
    Bold has a similar D/i, but not so S/e, and definitely \"a\" (spurless) and \"d/n\"
    are completely differents. Maybe customizing any Akko or FF Max... It\xB4s being
    difficult."
