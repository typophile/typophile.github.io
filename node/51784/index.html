  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p><strong>The Problem</strong>
Many of us have wanted to license a complete font family but cannot afford to do so at the present time.  So we purchase only one or two weights that we really need.</p>
<p>But later when we are able to afford the whole family, we are told that we have to either purchase the whole family at the full price (essentially paying for the single weights we purchased earlier all over again) or we can get a nominal discount.</p>
<p>Fontshop, for example, allows you to pay the difference if you buy the single weights and then you buy the whole family later inside the same month.  The issue with this is that if you can&rsquo;t afford to purchase the whole family right now, that situation is unlikely to change inside a month.  It may take you many months or even a year or two to be able to do it.</p>
<p>Though I am sure this makes a lot of business sense from the point of view of the business, it is not as friendly &amp; helpful as it could be from the point of view of the consumer.</p>
<p><strong>One Happy Solution</strong>
In the economic climate we all now live in, I want to point out [[http://www.vllg.com/tastetest.php|Vllg.com&rsquo;s &ldquo;taste test&rdquo; policy]] as one example of what a truly upgrade-friendly consumer-oriented purchasing policy looks like.  Their policy states:</p>
<p><strong>If you purchase a single weight (or more) of any typeface we offer, then return later to buy a family set, we will credit you the amount of the original sale.</p>
<p>How the program works</p>
<p>We know that you might want to try out one or two weights of a typeface to decide if it&rsquo;s right for a project you&rsquo;re working on. While the MudTyper and PDFs are very useful, there is nothing quite like trying out a typeface yourself.</p>
<p>So, you visit vllg.com and license your &ldquo;trial&rdquo; font (or fonts) and work with it for a while. A couple of hours, a couple of months, or a couple of years.</p>
<p>If you decide you want to get a family set, just come back to vllg.com and purchase a license online. Send us a note on the checkout page or via email and we will deduct the original cost of your &ldquo;trial&rdquo; fonts from your family order. </strong></p>
<p>A policy like this encourages us to purchase more fonts from them to try out, knowing full well that they will allow us to pay the difference if we want to come back and get the whole family, even if it is years later.</p>
<p>What do you think of this &ldquo;taste test&rdquo; policy?  Do you know of other upgrade-friendly type foundries that are willing to do what they can to help the customer not pay twice for the same fonts?</p>

We wanted 1 weight to set type and show the client in order to get them to buy the whole family for a branding project. In the end we purchased the whole family but it would have been nice to go this route.</div>

<p>Didn&rsquo;t one of Typophile&rsquo;s users recently describe Erik Spiekermann as &ldquo;a stingy man&rdquo; ? Yes, it was that Japanese person I can&rsquo;t recall the screen name of who said that, and he was branded as &ldquo;mean-spirited&rdquo; for having the temerity to say it. Surely FontShop&rsquo;s inflexible sales policy regarding font family purchases is mean-spirited?</p>
<p>Another reason they&rsquo;re not on my list has to do with FF Meta being no less homogenous or tyrannical than Helvetica. Same old Roman Army, different style. Meh!</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Rahim, your artfully capitalized thread title is provocative, but you don&rsquo;t seem to understand the simple retail principle at work here, Volume Discount.</p>
<p>The benefit for the seller is to make a larger, immediate sale.
The benefit for the purchaser is a reduced per-unit cost.</p>
<p>The fact that the &ldquo;full set&rdquo; contains what may be licensed separately is immaterial.
Where is the incentive if there is no disincentive?</p>
<p>The way it work is like this (and I use my most recent release, Beaufort Pro):</p>
<p>Single font: $59
Package of ten: $299 (unit price 29.90)
Buy two now, package later: $417 (unit price 41.70)</p>
<p>Isn&rsquo;t that still a deal?
And you&rsquo;re making out like I&rsquo;m ripping people off?!
Do the math, get a life, make some money, and if you&rsquo;re offered a deal, don&rsquo;t go dissing whoever made it because they&rsquo;re not as &ldquo;upgrade friendly&rdquo; as your greedy heart desires.</p>
<p>**</p>
<p>Having said that, I can&rsquo;t deny that the Village offer makes a lot of sense.
Canada Type also has an interesting idea, with differential licence options for the same product.
And of course there are &ldquo;get this font free, pay for the other family members later&rdquo; offers, such as those from exljbris.
But the good old &ldquo;family discount&rdquo; is still a great deal for purchasers.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Nick,</p>
<p>I think you might be reading my comments and the comments of some of the other posters as one and the same comments, thinking that they and I are saying the exact same thing.</p>
<p>The purpose of my post was not to incite a riot, but to start a conversation.  And like any conversation, some grievances and frustrations will be expressed by certain members of this forum.  And we all need to listen to those.</p>
<p>I admire Village a lot, but that doesn&rsquo;t mean I hate and disrespect and am ready to demonize all the the other foundries.  That way of thinking has proven to be a dead-end in all walks of life and all areas of human thought.</p>
<p>What I am asking is for everyone to &ldquo;think about&rdquo; alternative ways to price their product so that we can all &ldquo;help&rdquo; each other in these difficult economic times.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really important that we try to &ldquo;talk with&rdquo; each other, rather than &ldquo;talk at&rdquo; each other, so that some degree of mutual understanding might have a chance to take place.</p>
<p>Having said that, I understand the retail principle well enough.  The question I&rsquo;m posing is: if the Village offer makes &ldquo;a lot of sense&rdquo; to you, then surely some part of you understands that the retail principle cannot be the one-ring-to-rule-them-all approach to selling your product.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s keep the conversation going, without getting personal, defensive, and, yes, mean-spirited.</p>

<p>Oh, please. Enough with the histrionics. Just because it doesn&rsquo;t fit your business model doesn&rsquo;t mean he&rsquo;s making a &ldquo;provocative distortion.&rdquo; Rahim&rsquo;s original post was thoughtful, and not in any way an insult to the standard way of doing things for most businesses (type foundries, butchers, etc.). He was posing a question, plain and simple, and speaking from the consumer&rsquo;s point of view (you know, the people who keep you in business).</p>
<p>And no matter how you want to phrase it, you are indeed paying for the same font twice from many foundries if you buy one, and then come back and pay full price for the whole family. Yes, we understand that that&rsquo;s how it&rsquo;s generally done with fonts, and all sorts of other things. Yes, we understand that there are volume discounts when buying the whole family at once (which we all appreciate). And yes, we understand that the current system works quite well for many foundries and that doesn&rsquo;t make them evil. But Village&rsquo;s system is very attractive, and certainly in my case would encourage me to buy from them.</p>
<p>I would not expect to go to the hardware store, buy a quart of paint for $10, and then come back the next day and have them sell me 3/4 of a gallon at a discounted price (i.e. the price of a full gallon minus the $10 I paid for the quart).</p>
<p>But if they offered that, it would certainly be appealing to a lot of people who want to try out paint colors. I doubt anyone thinks that Home Depot is ripping them off because they don&rsquo;t offer that. And if I sent an e-mail to Home Depot suggesting they do that, I really doubt they&rsquo;d use the phrase &ldquo;greedy heart&rdquo; in their response to me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you’re making out like I’m ripping people off?!
Do the math, get a life, make some money, and if you’re offered a deal, don’t go dissing whoever made it because they’re not as “upgrade friendly” as your greedy heart desires.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s safe to say that <em>that</em> was mean-spirited.</p>

I apologize.
Sorry, the &ldquo;times are tough, sell you fonts for less&rdquo; approach does tend to get me worked up.</p>
<p><em>And no matter how you want to phrase it, you are indeed paying for the same font twice from many foundries if you buy one, and then come back and pay full price for the whole family.</em></p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s the essence of the family discount? 
It only happens if you decide to split your purchase.</p>
<p>From the foundry/retailer perspective, there&rsquo;s overhead involved in administering a split-purchase refund.
It may be justified, if it results in a sale that otherwise might not have happened.</p>

First, a foundry/retailer would have to verify the original single font/fonts purchase, then work out how much has to be subtracted from the family fee. Then how is a non-standard amount paid? Shopping cart software is set up to handle fixed prices associated with specific product packages. 
I&rsquo;m sure the amount of customer service time involved would be worth the sale, but there are so many marketing services that can be added to a business, and I generally try to keep things simple. I figure a deep discount on family packages is practical, as might be offering the basic font in a family for free (no Paying Twice there!)&ndash;but this refund business just strikes me as unnecessarily complicated. 
I&rsquo;d rather by designing fonts (or arguing about it on Typophile) than implementing it.</div>

<p>@James Arboghast - i love meta and infact am going to be buying it soon (well my work is). It seems a bit extreme to me to stike a foundary/reseller off your list partly because they sell a font you don&rsquo;t like. does that mean you would not use myfonts because they sell helvetica?</p>
<p>@Nick Shinn - i agree the standard model is still a good deal for customers, and one day i will buy some of your fonts (saving right now for alphaville), but deals like the village taste test do make the standard model look like it&rsquo;s lacking. as a customer it&rsquo;s more tempting to use that reseller as they seems to give me the best deal.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Hi.</p>
<p>The Taste Test has been Village policy since Day One. In fact, it was always our policy at Thirstype in Chicago too. It shows our clients the respect they show us by licensing our types. Similarly, all of our licensing is cumulative, so that clients can add to the number of computers they have covered without any unnecessary extra outlay.</p>
<p>Most of our policies were created to balance our needs with the needs of our clients. We run on the Golden Rule. Which is why we have our licensing tables clearly accessible from every typeface page, offer Supersets and smaller Essential/Basic sets, and don&rsquo;t make people create accounts to use our site. (V2 of the site will allow for clients to create accounts if they wish which will make it much easier for them (and us) to manage Taste Tests, upgrades, etc.)</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s really painless to manage Taste Test orders; it takes around 90 seconds to get into our e-commerce system, make the necessary adjustments, and send files to clients.</p>
<p>Nick, we have not copyrighted the idea at all, although we wouldn&rsquo;t be too thrilled to see another foundry with a &ldquo;Taste Test&rdquo;. Any other name is fair game. Another company with a similar scheme is Apple, where you can &ldquo;Complete My Album&rdquo; at the iTunes Store.</p>
<p>Thanks to Rahim for the original post. It is interesting to read the discussion it has sparked.</p>

<p>Without taking the word &ldquo;hating&rdquo; literally, I will make it clear that I don&rsquo;t dislike Fontshop. I just find their retailing policy unrealistic, and find many of their popular fonts like Meta, Freight and Micro no less homogeneous than tyrant types like Helvetica, just different in style but equally regimented. All I am doing is exercizing my freedom of choice.</p>
<p>Is that so unreasonable? I don&rsquo;t think so. And I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s asking a lot to try to get typophiles to see that. One thing I dislike about the mainstream the way it encourages an, &ldquo;If you&rsquo;re not with us you are against us&rdquo; attitude. Just because I am not pro FontShop does that make me anti-FontShop?</p>
<p>Why does everything have to be viewed in black &amp; white around here? The world is color blind.</p>

<p>And do you also expect to get a font for one fifth of the price because it is licensed for five CPUs but you will only use it on your single home computer? :^P</p>
<p>BTW The &ldquo;times are tough&rdquo; argument is <em>so</em> ridiculous. Times are tough for type designers and vendors as well. They also have the right to make a decent living. Why is it that in every discussion like this type designers and vendors are branded as thieving bastards, and why does everyone feel they have the right to determine how much they are allowed to ask for their work? Is there anybody telling you how much you are allowed to charge your clients? Don&rsquo;t forget the price of type has continually decreased over the past decades and the quality these days is unbelievable, with the new OpenType format and whatnot.</p>
<p>Although I greatly admire their offerings I don&rsquo;t buy Enschedé fonts because they are out of my price range. But do I bitch and whine about this on Typophile? Do I have the presumption to tell them how much their fonts should cost? I appreciate Village&rsquo;s TasteTest police, but I don&rsquo;t diss other foundries because they chose not to offer this service. It&rsquo;s a free world, deal with it.</p>
<p>Now stop whining and do something constructive.</p>

		<div class="commentbody">Font vendors like to keep things simple (if not totally &ldquo;just&rdquo;) by selling either single fonts or packages, considering each purchase a &ldquo;new&rdquo; purchase. There are two good reasons for doing this: money and logistics. There are also good reasons to do it differently, if you take into account that a customer&rsquo;s goodwill has a certain value &ndash; and if you have the programming skills to conceive a system that provides the logistics. 
Luc(as) de Groot is one who has followed Rahin&rsquo;s logic, reckoning that a customer who is welcomed back by a company that remembers and rewards his or her earlier purchases comes back more happily. At LucasFonts, anyone who buys a font or several fonts from a family from which he/she has already bought fonts using the same login name, is eligible to receive a &ldquo;font family rebate&rdquo; even if months or years have gone by. It took LucasFonts' software developer Niels Poppe many hours to figure it out, but it works. It makes people like Rahin very happy.
BTW, LucasFonts.com has a new website.</div>

Which is why i now buy nearly all my music from iTunes, and for similar reasons will use font vendors who offer &lsquo;deals&rsquo; that make is seem like i&rsquo;m saving more money. it&rsquo;s not that the traditionla models are bad, it&rsquo;s just that the newer ones seem to offer better value, or at least less waste, whether it&rsquo;s true or not i don&rsquo;t know, but it seems that way, and lots of time that&rsquo;s a big deal.</p>

<p>I haven&rsquo;t got any problem with your decision; my remarks have nothing to do with what you bring up. To each his/her own, it&rsquo;s up to you to decide where to buy your fonts. Your reasoning exemplifies the nature of free commerce in a competitive market &ndash; if you don&rsquo;t like the policy of a certain vendor you spend your buck elsewhere.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just reacting against the initial message in this thread. Frankly this whole thread seems like it&rsquo;s been started as a malignant effort to manipulate public opinion, and the whole basic premise is ridiculous. Let everyone decide for themselves how to run their business. And if they do it the wrong way the dynamics of the market will make sure they&rsquo;ll either have to adapt or go bankrupt.</p>

<p>Mikey, you know I like you, but that must be the absolute <em>dumbest</em> remark I&rsquo;ve heard in a long while. I even won&rsquo;t go into this. Let me just ask if you ever wondered how much time and budget went into designing, developing and coding the website where you do those &ldquo;few mouse clicks&rdquo;, and how much it costs to constantly improve upon it, update it and keep it running smoothly? And what about the people on the other side of the line who are ready to reply to your every question and find solutions to your problems?</p>

<p>Mikey, I <em>really</em> resent this remark, especially since I&rsquo;m part of their Research Team and we&rsquo;ve spent considerable time looking up fonts, compiling extensive lists of options and offering alternatives to people who may very well <em>never</em> buy at FontShop for all I know. The sales and support people also are always forthcoming, but it&rsquo;s just that this is the FontShop sales policy, period.</p>
<p>When I started out the only option was to purchase the complete volume at one and a half times to twice the price fonts cost now. The situation has improved in such a way that over the past decades fonts became much cheaper and now you can purchase single fonts or have numerous configurations of font volumes to choose from. Some foundries don&rsquo;t even go through the trouble of offering single fonts. So what&rsquo;s the complaining all about?</p>

<p>A very valid and telling statement. When I entered the field at a type house the prices for a font were outrageous by our standards, not to mention the machinery you would have to have had. Fast forward a couple of decades and I giggle at someone whining at paying 19.95 for a font, much less a couple of hundred dollars for the full family. Discount or no discount!</p>

<p>I’ll say that in world of FU phone-tree disinformation that every single font vendor I’ve worked with, from the big A down the line, has been been amazingly accommodating and totally available. How they price the fonts is up to them. As an independent designer, I can attest that having a system in place that minimizes the book keeping and clerical time is a must. So what if a smaller foundry doesn&rsquo;t follow every pricing trend. I need what they make, and I&rsquo;m glad to have so many options for testing and experimentation, often in advance of a purchase.</p>

<p>Village&rsquo;s Taste Test program is indeed enticing from a customer perspective, and I wouldn&rsquo;t begrudge anybody who chooses to shop there because of it. But one thing to consider is that FontShop currently carries fonts from 66 foundries and growing, while Vllg carries 10; formulating a new sales policy with collaboration and unanimity amongst so many parties is quite a task. This is most likely why the standard among font resellers is a simpler model than Village&rsquo;s exception. And as has been mentioned, we feel that we do give back to our customers, and the community as a whole, in the form of such offerings as Font Magazine, FontBooklet, FontStruct.com, FontFeed, newsletters, etc.</p>
<p>That said, we certainly take customer opinion seriously, and we&rsquo;ll continue to have internal discussions regarding this particular point of sales policy. We&rsquo;ll keep the community posted if any changes are made down the road.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Some observations:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>I started this post to highlight what one foundry is doing that is appealing to those who of us that have limited budgets.  I invite you to re-read my own words from the beginning.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In my second post, I explicitly said that even though I admire Village for their &ldquo;taste test&rdquo; policy, it does not mean that I diss other foundries for not having a similar policy.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I respect how FontShop, Veer, ShinnType, OurType, Type-Together, and so many others conduct their business.  If they don&rsquo;t have a similar policy, it&rsquo;s not as helpful to me as Village&rsquo;s policy, but so be it.  I still love their work and the amazing talent of the designers.  I will still purchase fonts from them.  Some other posters on this thread will not.  Can you identify the difference between my approach and theirs?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I did not use the &ldquo;times are tough, lower your prices&rdquo; argument.  What I said was, in these difficult economic times, a policy like Village&rsquo;s Taste Test upgrade policy was appealing and friendly.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I&rsquo;m not <em>telling</em> other foundries how to price their fonts.  The whole thread started as a conversation about what type of purchasing and upgarding policy might be helpful to the limited-budget consumer.  At no point have I wanted Village to &ldquo;lower&rdquo; its prices because I think their prices are too high.  It&rsquo;s about the upgrading policy, not the prices. It&rsquo;s a subtle distinction but I hope it can be discerned.</p>
<ul>
<li>There&rsquo;s this idea that if you don&rsquo;t like my business policy, spend your money elsewhere.  But don&rsquo;t try to have a conversation with me about it.  Any such conversation can only be &ldquo;a malignant effort to manipulate public opinion.&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
<p>Well, no one is lining up outside your office with pitch forks and torches.  This is a forum.  This is a place to have conversations.  It&rsquo;s not just about markets and money, it&rsquo;s also about ideas and conversations and exchanges and partnerships and the acknowledgment that we are all living in a mutually interdependent ecosystem.</p>
<p>Every new idea was once considered &ldquo;a malignant effort to manipulate public opinion&rdquo; and those who spearheaded these kinds of efforts were quickly given a hemlock latte with extra whip.</p>
<p>It is simply not helpful to tell us to &ldquo;stop whining, get a life, get a job, etc&rdquo;: essentially, drink your hemlock and shut up.</p>
<p>No one is threatening you and your business and your right to earn a living.  Please proceed as usual, and much success to you.  Live and let live.</p>
<p>My original intent/suggestion was actually very simple:</p>
<p>Village&rsquo;s Taste Test policy, wonderful idea, wonder if other foundries already do something similar, wonder if it helps us make more purchases and helps them make more money and support their business efforts.</p>
<p>Wonder if we could create more win-win situations in the typeface purchasing world through ideas <em>like</em> this, not necessarily identical to this?</p>
<p>I sincerely hope I have been clear about my position.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sure, people might not need all those foreign languages, and small caps in some weights may never get used, but they’re there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Is there any way to offer &ldquo;basic&rdquo; versions of these typefaces, with Latin-only character sets? I understand that font companies need to recoup the man-hours for drawing all those glyphs, but passing the cost on to users who don&rsquo;t need Cyrillic, or extended sets will keep me from buying some of these new OT fonts. Meta Basic is a good example. $528 for book, italic, bold, bold italic for the sans and serif seems steep to me. I&rsquo;m not saying they&rsquo;re not worth it, but I&rsquo;ve noticed prices going up, and I&rsquo;m assuming it&rsquo;s partially due to the extensive number of glyphs.</p>

<p>There are all kinds of different character sets and glyph sets available from different foundries.
For instance, I sell &ldquo;Standard&rdquo; versions of Paradigm for $9, with Latin Extended-A character set; the Pro versions are $59 and have the same characters, but lots of OpenType features. So the idea is that people can &ldquo;buy and try&rdquo; the $9 fonts and upgrade to the $59 ones, the price of the original being relatively negligible so that there&rsquo;s no need for a refund.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>As Sharon mentioned earlier, we (Process Type Foundry) have the same policy as Vllg where if you buy a single weight and want to add to it later from the same family, we&rsquo;ll deduct the previous purchase price. We do this for other combos, too, not just singles. This is one of the reasons we&rsquo;re happy to publish our own typefaces so we can control our policies when fonts our sold through our website. But, the benefit of having a contained library to deal with (rather than 66 foundries worth of stuff) is that we can relatively easily manage this sort of thing. We simply have previous customers contact us and we use a coupon in our cart system. Some day we&rsquo;d like to develop an even easier system.</p>
<p>And, we also offered the same sort of discounted upgrade prices mentioned about Galaxie Polaris v3 when we released Bryant 2. People certainly take advantage of it, but it isn&rsquo;t an overwhelming response or something that is a burden. Again, this is the advantage of self-publishing - control. However, there are drawbacks to self-publishing, just as there are wonderful advantages to having a place like FontShop sell your work.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>@Bald Condensed
People do, in fact, complain about not only special-edition DVD collections of movies previously sold separately, but also multi-season TV series packages. Go to Amazon and read to your heart&rsquo;s content how many Seinfeld fans that bought every season separately when it came out are pissed that now the only way to get the additional bonus materials offered in the latest and greatest Seinfeld-collection-to-end-all-Seinfeld-collections is to purchase seasons already in their home libraries. I don&rsquo;t know if they&rsquo;re literally picketing, but I&rsquo;m relatively confident nobody&rsquo;s literally picketing at the FontShop doorsteps.</p>
<p>Additionally, both the DVD and restaurant arguments are inadequate, at best, and I&rsquo;m sure someone here can come up with way better examples to help illustrate your point. The reason I say they are inadequate is both the DVDs and appetizers are physical objects that the seller can only sell once. Sure, then can sell a lot <em>of</em> them, but each one is a particular object that gets prepared/manufactured and delivered individually. Font files, on the other hand, are generated once and need to be delivered multiple times, but the &ldquo;manufacturing process&rdquo; does not need to be repeated. Please bear in mind I&rsquo;m NOT saying this to mean that font files should then be considered lacking worth. What I&rsquo;m saying is that, for the sake of debate and making your point, comparing font products to physical products like food or DVDs is anything but adequate, because the value of digital files is measured differently.</p>
<p>What’s more, your restaurant example actually helps make an argument for exactly the opposite of what you&rsquo;re defending. Why? The price of the main course doesn&rsquo;t include what I already had and am being charged for. It&rsquo;s an entirely different product that doesn&rsquo;t try to sell me what I already ate. If you found out that the price for your hamburger includes the cheese fries you already ate and are already getting charged for, you would protest. Same goes for your clever friend&rsquo;s ‘G3-&gt;MacBook Pro’ comment. You don&rsquo;t get a G3 included with your MacBook Pro purchase. You do, however, get the font you already purchased a year ago included in the family pack you&rsquo;re purchasing right now.</p>
<p>Again, <strong>I&rsquo;m not saying it&rsquo;s <em>wrong</em></strong> not to offer something similar to what Village offers its customers. Not at all. I think the ‘no upgrade’ model is OK. I&rsquo;m simply pointing out that your arguments are doing anything but help illustrate your point, and in fact help illustrate its pitfalls.</p>
<p>@Everyone else having a silly little hissy fit:
I&rsquo;d like to remind you of an example that does indeed apply very, very effectively to the ‘single font-&gt;font family’ upgrade scenario. Software licensing. Most (and I think it&rsquo;s safe to say: an overwhelming majority of) software developers/vendors offer upgrades to the latest version of their software products for a lower price than the full, no-upgrade version. In fact, I&rsquo;d say most consumers (technologically inclined or otherwise) see software upgrades as a normal, everyday fact of life: If you already bought the software at full price, you can upgrade to the latest version with a discount.</p>
<p>While I realize that few fonts actually go through an actual ‘upgrade’ or ‘versioning’ process comparable to software development, the comparison holds water when you consider the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>what type designers are selling is not the design itself, but a license to use the <em>software</em> that packages the typeface design into a usable set of glyphs that can be set by any typesetting program</li>
<li>the exact code that makes up the "Regular" weight I purchased a year ago is present in the "Family Package" I intend to purchase today (this, of course, is not always the case, but I'd be willing to bet it describes an overwhelming majority of the cases), which helps make the argument that a customer is, indeed, paying twice for the very same, exact, precise thing, much like parts of the code that make up my current copy of InDesign CS3 are present in CS4 (and thus, I'll get a discount when I decide to upgrade)</li>
<li>some software vendors offer ‘lite’ and ‘pro’ versions of their products… guess what you usually get when you decide to purchase the pro version after having purchased and tested the lite version? You guessed it: a discount! Again: not always the case, but extremely common (I'd almost call it the norm).</li>
</ul>
<p>And let&rsquo;s not forget: software upgrades are ubiquitous in the industry. You&rsquo;ll see them everywhere, from Adobe and Microsoft to the small one-developer outfit that some programmer is running from his or her guestroom during his or her free time from the day job, and everything in between. So this <em>the size of my company makes it so that trying something like this would destroy everything I&rsquo;ve worked so hard for</em> argument, whether it be <em>I&rsquo;m too small to implement it</em> or the hilarious <em>we&rsquo;re too big to implement it</em>, is —in a word— bullshit. Say you don&rsquo;t like it; say you don&rsquo;t agree with it; hell, say it is an insult to typeface designers the world over. But don&rsquo;t treat it like such a strange notion that&rsquo;s impossible to apply an organization such as yours because you&rsquo;re too small, or too big. Unless you mean your <em>ego</em> is too big. In that case, you&rsquo;ll have my support.</p>
<p>While I understood Rahim&rsquo;s intention correctly from the beginning (<em>let&rsquo;s talk about different alternatives to the traditional mainstream model in the spirit of innovation and furthering the typeface design industry and market</em>), I find it rather revealing to see some type designers adopt a very aggressive attitude right from the get go. Some people need to wedge out that huge pilcrow they have lodged in their shoulder. So you&rsquo;re a type designer. Big deal. You run a business, like a lot of other people, and talking about pricing alternatives to offer your clients/customers shouldn&rsquo;t be such a nerve-wrecking experience for you.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>@Bald Condensed - i was simply using the iTunes digital music store as an example of how  my buying habits have changed since songs became software.</p>
<p>if fonts were still mostly distributed on cd, then i think your point would be more accurate, but since they are mostly available as a digital download, the iTunes analogy is more accurate.</p>
<p>i do not expect music (or fonts) to be free. if people choose to give their creations away, that&rsquo;s their choice and i will look into them, but i much prefer quality, and will pay for it. the crux of this is paying for the same file twice, not paying at all. i want the support and features that &lsquo;pro&rsquo; fonts provide, so will happily pay for them.</p>
<p>and i do get frustrated when i have to buy songs again that i&rsquo;ve already bought as part of another ep/single/etc cause one they are in my iTunes player i just delete the duplicates anyway, so it feels like a waste.</p>
<p>and to be clear, i like FontShop. I will buy from them. And i love the ammount of support they give the type community - and customers - through all their efforts.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Hello all:</p>
<p>First I would like to clarify a few things. Yves, I still like you too :-)</p>
<p>I spoke with Teresa at FontShop prior to this thread coming up. I called because I had the <em>intention</em> to actually buy type—Clifford Nine Pro. $65. Then perhaps later on in the month I would get the 9 italic and then the following month the 18 and so on. Eventually, I would nab the whole thing. Politely, she told me “we don’t do that” and told me purchasing the entire package will give me a discount. That would have been my first FontShop purchase.</p>
<p>Fine.</p>
<p>What I did purchased instead?&hellip;</p>
<p>The excellent Vincent Banner from Carter &amp; Cone&hellip; Vincent is what Times should be!!! 
Australis from Latinotype&hellip; this one has excellent kerning. BUY IT NOW!!!!!
The entire Ascender Miramonte Pro, which is excellent (If Futura and Metro had a baby this would be it.)
Ascender’s Ayita which is nice too.
MVB Magnesium Regular
MVB Condensed
I also bought MVB Chanson d’Amour.</p>
<p>Other people got my business.</p>
<p>I do love many of the excellent FontFont Originals. However, I seldom (just about never) spend more that a 150 at time on type in one month. That’s how I roll.</p>
<p>I also prefer to buy directly from the designer/indie. For example. If I was to purchase Vista Sans. I would not put an order in with FontShop. I would call Emigre directly so the designer/foundry would get the full profit. Similarly, I would not place an order with Fonts.com to buy Clifford Pro. Akira would get a whopping 3 bucks after all the overhead.</p>
<p>Anyhow, 65 dollars or 130 or whatever the amount, <em>I will not be penalized in anyway for being a customer</em>. I won’t let Adobe do it, FontShop, nor Joe-Blow-Down-The-Block Fonts. I never have let them do it. <em>That’s my policy!</em> I feel good about that.</p>
<p>Reflecting back, I was one of those people who thought $19 was too much for a font. I thought Font Bureau was too much too and many others. While, I don’t feel that way now. I also know what my budget is and if that means that I can only buy a few fonts, then fine. I’ll make it clear- I better not be disadvantaged in anyway.</p>
<p>If the foundry does not make an allowance for my buying pattern of a $100 or less an month— then I will look for alternatives. While others are willing say their okay with the extra loss, I’ll be clear. I HATE IT, AND EVERYONE ELSE SHOULD CHANGE! There, I said it.</p>
<p>I won’t save up for type either&hellip; that’s too much overhead for <em>me</em>!</p>
<p>Tellingly, Yves Peters works for FontShop. Nick Shinn— shinnfonts. It is no surprise this discussion would not appeal to folks who are invested (mentally or otherwise) in keeping things the way they are. Dalton Maag let Aller Sans go public—not cool with Nick. Adobe bundles type with creative suite— bad for the business say Nick. Ellen Lupton free font manifesto—Yves no likey.</p>
<p>But I am willing to buy from everyone in the way I demand—that’s all.</p>
<p>For Yves and Nick&gt;</p>
<p>It took, Village 90 seconds to deal with a customer like myself. FontShop has much more money and staff behind it than Village, too bad for FontShop if they can’t do what Vllg does. A conditional pricing table engine (I made that term up) does not sound any more complex than the baroque webpage design and programming for FontShop.com. Hire some one! So your example of Sansa would be something Vllg can certainly handle—and FontShop, if they wanted too?. Also Vllg is no pushover, I wanted to purchase Dolly in parts but I couldn’t&hellip; I don’t want them to be painted as desperate for business in comparison to the larger guys. Vllg is smaller, yet smarter and more flexible. I have purchased a style of Odile and the Merlo family. They will <em>always</em> get my business because they have made allowance for <em>me</em>—my needs&hellip; that‘s personal service in case you did not know. Chester was also nice to talk to. If you re-read his post you can discern he obviously loves his customers.</p>
<p>Also you said what FontShop’s policy is—no exceptions, but Rahim said he bought some fonts and he planned to buy more. FontShop said they would discount if it was within the month&hellip; why not extend beyond that? Teresa or whoever can easily look up my account and charge accordingly.</p>
<p>Malignant or not, I hope this thread does influence other foundries to change their policies. There has been enough outcry regarding PDF embedding that its not longer an issue for most of my purchases. See&hellip; whining does help!</p>
<p>When I happened to have a surplus of $300 some time in the future I will give give FontShop a ringy-dingy—on the list again.</p>
<p>Speaking of stingy&hellip; look that word up in the dictionary—you’ll see my face. The picture will be kinda light to save money on the ink. I didn’t smile—that costs extra.
I’m the guy you take shopping for a car or a house.</p>
<p>NO BODY BEATS MIKEY!</p>
<p>Akira, I love you, but the policies get in the way :-(</p>
<p>Mike Diaz</p>
<p>PS I&hellip; In my FontShop account, where you can receive special discounts or offers&hellip; I have yet to get a single one.</p>
<p>PS II&hellip; Jens&raquo;&gt; Yes, I collect. I collect fine art, type, sneakers (over 30 right now). A subscription model is intriguing.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>oh and a suggestion on keeping track of the orders:</p>
<p>using the sansa example, if the customer was given a code when they make each purchase, they could then just enter the code (like what FSI has now for discounts) and the cart will deduct the correct amount.</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s simple and helps everyone keep track of things.</p>
<p>eg:</p>
<p>Let’s say I first license Sansa Light. I get a Code: SANSALGT</p>
<p>Turns out I need additional weights, so I purchase a license for the Sansa 1 volume, and enter the code: SANSALGT to get the light cost deducted. I now get new code: SANSAVOL1</p>
<p>But then I need even more weights, and I purchase a license for the Sansa Family. I enter code: SANSAVOL1 and get the volume 1 price i&rsquo;ve already paid, deducted. I get new code: SANSAFAM</p>
<p>My client branches out in Central Europe, so I need to purchase a license for Sansa Professional. i enter SANSAFAM and get the deduction like before. new code: SANSAPRO</p>
<p>But then I want to diversify the design a bit, and I purchase a license for Sansa Soft. i would not enter a code here, unless sansa soft is part of a super pack that includes all the sansa varieties.</p>
<p>At some point I need a serif face to match all of those, and I purchase a license for Sansa Slab. same as sansa soft.</p>
<p>look at how village handle this with the Stag and Stag Sans families:
<a href="http://vllg.com/Schwartzco/Stag/mudTyper+Weights/">http://vllg.com/Schwartzco/Stag/mudTyper+Weights/</a></p>
<p>when my work upgraded from the the Stag family to the Stag Superset, then to the SuperDuperset we only paid the difference from what we had already paid. It made my boss  more willing to buy.</p>

<p>I do recognize many of your frustrations, though. FontShop hates to hear that a customer is unhappy and we&rsquo;ll certainly do our best to address the situation. We have looked into the feasibility of single-to-package discounts and we&rsquo;ll continue to work on a solution. I&rsquo;d be interested to hear if the other major resellers offer such a discount.</p>
<p>What might shed some light on the crux of this discussion is what Nicole said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There are drawbacks to self-publishing, just as there are wonderful advantages to having a place like FontShop sell your work.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The difference between a foundry or small retailer like Village and a reseller like FontShop is important and there will always be initiatives that one or the other does best. I tried to summarize some of these in my <a href="http://typographica.org/001157.php">post on Typographica</a> yesterday.</p>

I haven&rsquo;t criticized Adobe for bundling for several years, I&rsquo;ve moved on, my philosophy has changed.
I don&rsquo;t recall criticizing Dalton Maag for &ldquo;letting Aller go public&rdquo;&ndash;I asked Bruno if his strategy might not backfire, as I was interested in his thinking.
I&rsquo;m not &ldquo;invested in keeping things the way they are&rdquo;, I&rsquo;m a contrarian making debate on Typophile.
Or would you rather we stick to glossing and puffery?
Now I&rsquo;ve seen both sides of the argument developed I&rsquo;ve decided to join the rebate offerers.
Admittedly, only for direct sales at Shinntype, if my resellers can&rsquo;t handle it..
But it will be an incentive for people to licence directly (with a larger percentage of the price staying with me).
I can&rsquo;t do the kind of marketing programs that the top resellers do, but this would be something I could perhaps implement.</div>

<p>Nick&raquo;&gt; Honestly, I don’t believe a word you just said. Putting in a slightly different way than Muzzer—your outburst conveyed your true feelings. <em>Now your really glossing.</Em> Reading between yours and Yves comments I smelled fear. Fear of change.

<p>I acknowledge and appreciate that FontShop is looking into these things and will continue to work on a solution.  And I also acknowledge that being a reseller of many other foundries comes with its own overhead &amp; complexities.  I don&rsquo;t pretend to understand all of them, but I can&rsquo;t help but wonder and I hope you&rsquo;ll indulge me in this thought experiment&hellip;</p>
<p>What about fonts that are FontShop originals like FF Meta, FF Meta Serif, etc?  Could some &ldquo;taste test&rdquo;-ish model be applied to them, without requiring all your guest foundries to observe the same rules?</p>
<p>A logo could clearly distinguish between one of your original fonts that comes with a taste test policy and another foundry&rsquo;s font where the same upgrade policy is not available.  Sort of like when Amazon.com has a &ldquo;Look Inside&rdquo; logo on some books and not on others, just to give a conceptual and not a directly related example.</p>
<p>Also: if this model helps to support not just profitability, but a closer rapport with your customers since many of us have felt ourselves leaning a little more closely to those foundries that have such taste test policies, would that type of customer loyalty not have its own value?  And, at some point in the future, could this not make a strong case for other foundries to give the model a shot?</p>
<p>I thank you in advance for discussing internally and possibly exploring a solution that works admirably for all parties involved.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not saying it <em>can&rsquo;t</em> work, but saying &ldquo;it&rsquo;s simple&rdquo; is trivialising the logistics involved for large vendors, and comparing them with small, easy-to-manage outfits is an unfair comparison. Here&rsquo;s another example to show you it&rsquo;s not as simple as some want to make it seem:</p>
<p>OurType single font : €40</p>
<p>Fresco 1 : €150 = 6 fonts
Fresco 2 : €150 = 6 fonts
Fresco 3 : €150 = 6 fonts
Fresco 4 : €150 = 6 fonts
Fresco 5 : €150 = 6 fonts</p>
<p>Fresco Family : €525 = 30 Fonts</p>
<p>So if I buy 15 singles over a period of time I paid €600. Does this mean that if I need the remaining 15 then OurType should deliver me the Fresco Family and return €75 on my bank account?</p>

<p>You obviously misread &ndash; that was anger, not fear. The only thing I fear for my friends, colleagues and acquaintances is loss of income. I think the general perception of the type industry and specifically the profit margins is seriously skewed. The denomination &ldquo;large&rdquo; in large vendors refers to the number of foundries in their catalogue, certainly not the size of the operations. Furthermore a font costs less than a pair of Nikes, they are not produced for a couple of cents in a sweatshop in South East Asia, and the volumes sold are but a fraction of what Nike sells. It&rsquo;s not like FontShop or Veer rake in millions and have battalions of web developers at their beck and call.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ll talk for FontShop now because I don&rsquo;t know in detail what the other large vendors do.</p>
<p>You mean the considerable budget FontShop invests in producing <a href="http://fontfeed.com/">The FontFeed</a> &ndash; an international blog with three (3!) editors and even more contributors &ndash;, the two local blogs <a href="">Fontblog</a> and <a href="http://www.fontshop.be/">Unzipped</a>, the free online font creation tool &lt;a href=&ldquo;<a href="http://fontstruct.fontshop.com/%3EFontStruct">http://fontstruct.fontshop.com/&gt;FontStruct</a></a>, <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/services/education/">Education Pages</a>, <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/features/fontmag/007/">Font Magazine</a>, <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/features/newsletters/oct08b/">FontBooklets</a>, sponsoring <a href="http://www.typecon.com/">TypeCon</a> and <a href="http://atypi.org/">ATypI</a> amongst many others, and so on&hellip; all those things mean nothing when it comes to &ldquo;supporting a closer rapport with your customers&rdquo;?</p>
<p>Oh no, that&rsquo;s right, you are correct &ndash; it&rsquo;s not for their customers, it&rsquo;s for the <em>entire community.</em> You don&rsquo;t even have to buy anything from FontShop to benefit from all this. :^)</p>

<em>Furthermore a font costs less than a pair of Nikes, they are not produced for a couple of cents in a sweatshop in South East Asia, and the volumes sold are but a fraction of what Nike sells.</em></p>
<p>Again with the physical object comparison. So yeah, the Nikes cost &ldquo;a couple of cents…&rdquo; <strong>each pair</strong>. They have to make millions of those, then ship them worldwide, get them to each distributor, which will then mark it up for the stores, who then have to physically store the flying firetrucking things until a happy customer just waltzes in and decides to pay the doubly marked up price. So, the <strong>actual cost</strong> of each sneaker is hardly &ldquo;a couple of cents&rdquo;, when you consider distribution, storage and inventory costs. And then there&rsquo;s the marketing. Rake up the hundreds of millions of dollars spent on marketing the Nike brand (not to mention the ammount spent on marketing for each individual model).</p>
<p>A typeface family, on the other hand, costs much, much more to produce, as you explained, but distribution and storage costs are, I dare say, negligible. And the marketing costs incurred by even the largest font vendors are hardly comparable to the huge monster that is Nike. So the initial investment in the product is considerably large, but you only create it once, and then copying it and delivering copies of it is <strong>so not an issue</strong>.</p>
<p>Again: I suggest you stop comparing font production/sales to the production/sales of physical objects that can only be sold once.</p>
<p>PS. Did you get your &ldquo;couple of cents&rdquo; figure from the same source you got your &ldquo;nobody&rsquo;s complaining about special edition DVDs&rdquo; factoid? Or did it come from that friend your deem so clever, the G3/MacBook Pro smartass? Either way, I suggest you look into finding other, more grounded sources for your arguments. Or not…</p>

<em>[…]all those things mean nothing when it comes to “supporting a closer rapport with your customers”?</em></p>
<p>Who said it means nothing? Rahim didn&rsquo;t. <strong>You did.</strong></p>
<p>Seriously: you need to chill out, man. It seems that any positive remark towards Village&rsquo;s taste test practice (which is what Rahim&rsquo;s comment is) is perceived as negative criticism towards FontShop&rsquo;s (and other large vendors') sales policies and practices within the industry.</p>

		<div class="commentbody">very good points, alfonso. i may not agree completely with your argument style, but i agree 100% on all of your points. this problem is tough especially for AR, completist types who <em>have to have</em> every variation. Unfortunately, I haven&rsquo;t scraped together enough money yet to buy the entire Beorcana package, but someday&hellip; I&rsquo;m putting off buying any until I can buy all because as i see it, there is actually <em>disincentive</em> to buy any of them without all the others (the glass is half empty, i&rsquo;m sorry). this may actually hurt font sales if enough type licensors are operating in the manner as i do. one never knows until one trys a different tack. at least under discounted font selling schemes or by offering refunds you&rsquo;re <em>selling more fonts</em> to people who actually want to pay for licenses. Knowing that Vllg and Process have user-friendly pricing and buying schemes makes me want to return to them first if ever I want to license types I could get elsewhere.</div>

<em>So if I buy 15 singles over a period of time I paid €600. Does this mean that if I need the remaining 15 then OurType should deliver me the Fresco Family and return €75 on my bank account?</em></p>
<p>Not quite that simple. This is what OurType actually offers:</p>
<dl>
<dt>Fresco Light & LF Light
<dd>€40
<dt>Fresco SC Light
<dd>€40
<dt>Fresco Light Italic & LF Light Italic
<dd>€40
<dt>Fresco SC Light Italic
<dd>€40
</dl>
<dl>
<dt>Fresco 1 package
<dd>€150
</dl>
<p>The trick is: OurType lists the fonts included in the package as six separate products, which is kind of confusing (and of questionable intent, in <strong>my</strong> opinion). The truth is that the package is made up of four purchaseable items (the four listed above). The package lists <em>Fresco Light &amp; LF Light</em> as <em>Fresco Light, Fresco LF Light</em> and <em> Fresco Light Italic &amp; LF Light Italic</em> as &lt;Fresco Light Italic, Fresco LF Light Italic</em>, which gives the wrong impression that purchasing Fresco 1 package is equivalent to purchasing six separate €40 items, when in fact it is equivalent of purchasing four €40 items. When you buy the Fresco 1 package, you might think you&rsquo;re saving €90 (€240 <em>vs.</em> €150), but you&rsquo;re really saving ten bucks (€160 <em>vs.</em> €150). Not that there&rsquo;s anything wrong with that; what&rsquo;s wrong is the (again, in <strong>my</strong> opinion) decidedly deceiving way the information is presented.</p>
<p>So the entire family is actually made up of twenty (20, <strong>not</strong> 30) individual €40 items. So if I purchased half of them individually over a period of time, I actually would have spent €400. Therefore, upgrading to a full family (were OurType to offer such an upgrade) would mean they get to charge me €125. No need for any ludicrous credits in my name, as you explained.</p>
<p>Of course, any such &ldquo;upgrade&rdquo; feature is bound to find its limitations. Say I had purchased 14 individual font files, incurring in a total expense of €560. Does that mean I should get a refund when I decide to get the remaining 6 font files that would complete my family? No, of course not. What it does mean is that as soon as I purchase my 13<em>th</em> file in the family (where the total cost would reach €520), the system would alert me to the opportunity to purchase the remaining family members for an additional €5 (thus completing the €525 family pack purchase price).</p>
<p>And why not? If type designers and vendors price their family packs at a loss, then that&rsquo;s their problem, not the consumer&rsquo;s. A family pack should be offered at a price that makes the foundry/designer/vendor happy, and then the individual font files (or lesser packages) sold at a higher price per &ldquo;unit&rdquo; (font file). But let&rsquo;s not forget: the idea of higher prices for a single font file is to make that single sale worthy of the vendor&rsquo;s effort in a small-scale one-time sale, <strong>not</strong> to rake up extra profit when a family is sold bit by bit.</p>
<p>The main reasons physical products are sold at a lower price per unit when purchased in bulk are inventory storage costs and manufacturing costs. It saves a vendor money in inventory costs to get rid of large quantities of product quickly, and it also saves money to manufacture the product in bulk. Inventory storage costs for typefaces is negligible (as they are digital files and not very heavy ones at that), and manufacturing costs are higher, yet incurred only once and never again for that one eternally duplicable font file (as you don&rsquo;t have to keep actually making/designing/compiling/generating more and more copies of the font files each time you&rsquo;re making a sale).</p>
<p>So, once again, you&rsquo;ve proven your own arguments dead wrong.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Hi everyone,</p>
<p>Alfonso, allow me to question YOUR intent, by counting 6 font files as 4.</p>
<p>Like it or not, OurType does offer Mac PS and other &lsquo;legacy platforms&rsquo;, and, as far as Fresco is concerned, being launched in 2002, those were THE main platforms.
As you know, those platforms do allow only one set of figures.
Then, many customers preferred one style of figures above another one, and so on.</p>
<p>So, fonts with separate lining figures [LF], old style figures [osf], Small Caps [SC], ARE separately produced files, that our customers can and do choose, if they need them.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, five years on, OpenType is everywhere, and suddenly the Small Caps and Lining Figures, and OSF, and SC Figures, and various-width glyphs (not to mention the rest of the evergrowing character set) are just thought to be THE Standard character set, and the 6 separate files equal 4. Is that it?</p>
<p>More, Most of Our clients do buy the legacy platforms, rather than OpenType. 
So, 6 font files ARE 6 font files.</p>
<p>I would not want to excuse OurType for its policies, my post is just a reaction to your very confident and articulate misinformation, if you like to call it this way.</p>
<p>We DO try to adjust to the current practices (larger sets and ongoing technological update). As far as pricing and distribution is concerned - and with all the admiration we do have for Village/Lucas model - we will continue to define OUR OWN pricing and logistics policies.
Which doesn&rsquo;t mean we are not listening to all the opinions expressed here.</p>
<p>And last but not least &ndash; 
we do nurture quality with lots of research and effort put into new ideas. And we put new type faces out there only when we have something new or distinguishable to say. Most of our customers return to us because of THAT quality. We hope we do not let them down.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Hello, Corina. Your seemingly righteous retort would be flawless, were it not for the fact that I made a point of calling them purchaseable items. In fact, I make a point of establishing the difference between font files and items/products available for purchase:</p>
<p><em> &gt;OurType lists the fonts included in the package as six separate <strong>products,</strong> which is kind of confusing (and of questionable intent, in my opinion). The truth is that the package is made up of four <strong>purchaseable items</strong> (the four listed above).</em></p>
<p>I do not, nor ever did intend to imply that six font files should really be counted as four font files, and I invite anyone to quote me specifically where it is that I implied such a thing. What I <strong>did indeed say</strong> is that those six font files are sold as four separate items/products inividually, and that <strong>is indeed</strong> the case. Now, when Bald Condensed comes here claiming that the Fresco 1 package includes six font files <strong>priced at €40 EACH</strong>, that is misinformation. And that is misinformation that, in my opinion, is hinted at and even encouraged by the OurType website when we compare the phrasing used to sell your Fresco 1-5 packages <em>vs.</em> the phrasing using to sell your individual Fresco fonts. If this wasn&rsquo;t the case, why on earth would OurType describe it as <em>Fresco Light &amp; LF</em> when sold individually, and <em>Fresco Light, Fresco LF Light</em> when sold as part of a package? Why not use the same, exact phrasing and be consistent in both instances? Seriously: why not?</p>
<p>Call it what you want. I call that misrepresentation. The description provided for the Fresco family packages lead to the conclusion that six individually purchaseable items are included in the package, and that is not the case. There are six font files, but they are available as four individually purchaseable items, at €40 each.</p>
<p>Or maybe there is no ill intent, in which case the blame rests entirely on Bald Condensed misinterpreting <em>€40 per item</em> as <em>€40 per font file</em>. Either way, my argument still stands: purchasing the font files included in Fresco 1-5 packages individually do not amount to €240 per package, but €160.</p>

<p>You write:</p>
<p><cite>You mean the considerable budget FontShop invests in producing The FontFeed — an international blog with three (3!) editors and even more contributors —, the two local blogs Fontblog and Unzipped, the free online font creation tool FontStruct, Education Pages, Font Magazine, FontBooklets, sponsoring TypeCon and ATypI amongst many others, and so on&hellip; all those things mean nothing when it comes to “supporting a closer rapport with your customers”?</cite></p>
<p>All these things are appreciated and contribute massively to the community.  No doubt about that.</p>
<p>What I am trying to point out is that some of us consider it more valuable that some of this considerable budget that FontShop invests might be poured into maintaining some kind of friendly upgrade policy?</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t see how that means all the other contributions are worth nothing to us.  It&rsquo;s not an either/or situation here.  But there are priorities.  In the list of priorities, what would I rank as the most important to me after the quality of the fonts of course?  A &ldquo;taste test&rdquo;-like upgrade policy.</p>
<ol>
<li>Font quality</li>
<li>Friendly upgrade policy</li>
<li>Community support/blogs/conferences/newsletters</li>
</ol>
<p>I, as a customer, am telling all the foundries that this is my order of priorities.</p>
<p>But are you saying to me: &ldquo;We do so much of #3, why are you not satisfied?  Why are you even asking for #2?&rdquo;</p>
<p>And I would say to you: &ldquo;Why are you making me choose one or the other?  I would love to have both #2 and #3.  But if I have to choose, I would choose #2 over #3.  Maybe the increased sales from #2 could support #3 in ways that you might not be able to see yet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t have to be an either/or proposition.  And this is where some creativity in business comes in.  There <em>must</em> be a way to have all three, even if it means introducing #2 by reducing the financial footprint of #3.</p>

<p>I fail to see where it is that I can purchase Fresco Light (no LF, no SC). That&rsquo;s what I mean. Sure, all six font files included in the Fresco 1 package are purchaseable, but not individually at €40 per font file. Yet your Fresco 1 package listing displays Fresco Light separately.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know how else to explain it. Perhaps I need to ask the right question: If I were to purchase the font files found in the Fresco 1 package individually, how much would I have to spend? The way Bald Condensed explains it, one would have to spend €240. The way I see it on your website, one would have to spend €160.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s the reason I&rsquo;m saying it would be €160 (I hope somebody can illustrate why it would be €240): <img src="/images/old-images/fresco_prices_4800.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>And before somebody comes here to muddle the waters a bit more with pointless rhetoric about why should I be making such a fuss about OurType&rsquo;s pricing system, like silly Mr. Kutilek did a while ago, let me clarify the following: Bald Condensed&rsquo;s pricing argument relies on this one piece of information. That is why it is so important to the discussion that this one pricing issue be clear. I&rsquo;m sure Mr. Condensed didn&rsquo;t have any ill will when he dragged OurType into an already controvertial discussion, but he did use their prices as an example, and examples can and should be analyzed and questioned, regardless of where they come from.</p>

<p>The correct term is &ldquo;Convenient refund policy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>An upgrade policy would refer to &ldquo;trading in&rdquo; a Type1/TrueType font for the OpenType version.
Bold is not an upgrade of Regular.</p>
<p>And surely just because you like something because it saves you money, that doesn&rsquo;t make it &ldquo;friendly&rdquo;.
If the refund is productized, it&rsquo;s not a service, and is conducted automatically and impersonally.
But you&rsquo;ve given me an idea. Maybe if I program a happy-face pop-up for whenever a sale is made, I will be more customer-friendly :-)</p>

<p><cite>Once you are a registered user of our webshop you will receive a font family rebate whenever you license more fonts of the same font family for your organisation! This rebate will be calculated automatically each time you log in using your registered e-mail address.</cite></p>
<p>Jan, do you or anyone else know if the rebate is a full difference like what Village offers or some other differential discount?</p>
<p>Even if the automatic calculations are complex, it would be helpful to know the general intention of the rebate?  Is it nominal or substantial?</p>
<p>Anyhow, it&rsquo;s great that they offer this and it is most appreciated.  I just ordered a specimen catalog from them.</p>

<p>From their [[http://www.processtypefoundry.com/help/ordering.html#license|Help]] page:</p>
<p><cite>License or Pack Upgrades</cite>
<cite>Perhaps you bought Bryant Light and now want to purchase all the weights. Or, maybe you purchased a single user license of Klavika and want to upgrade to a 4–6 user license. If this is the case, contact us and we will make arrangements so you only pay the difference between the two rather than the full purchase price of the new item.</cite></p>
<p>Thank you very much for offering a full difference.  It really makes a difference to those of us with limited budgets but huge admiration for the quality of your work.  My favorites: Klavika, Seravek, and Locator.</p>

<p>Nice try, Ray Ban. Here&rsquo;s the three quotes you listed:</p>
<p><em>A family pack should be offered at a price that makes the foundry/designer/vendor happy […]</em>
Is that a statement of fact? Hardly. That is clearly an opinion.</p>
<p><em>But let’s not forget: the idea of higher prices for a single font file is to make that single sale worthy of the vendor’s effort in a small-scale one-time sale.</em>
Oh, wait… so the idea of higher prices for a single font file <strong>is not</strong> to make that single sale worthy of the vendor&rsquo;s effort in a small-scale one-time sale?!! Try again, Ray Ban.</p>
<p><em>A typeface family, on the other hand, costs much, much more to produce, as you explained, but distribution and storage costs are, I dare say, negligible.</em>
Oh, wait, so the distribution, storage and delivery of lightweight digital files all come at a price comparable to the distribution, storage and delivery of hundreds of thousands of Nike sneakers?! Really.</p>
<p>Take your half-assed self-serving pseudo rhetoric home, practice typing it in front of a mirror and see if you get any better at coming up with convincing arguments. Here&rsquo;s a hint: it&rsquo;d help if you had <strong>actual</strong> arguments you can articulate fully, instead of limiting yourself to little tid bits that are somehow supposed to make you seem like you have something to say.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Yves&gt; Okay now, Lets not make out FontShop out to be a philanthropic organization. Yes, I know FontShop put out many valuable tools, but these are <em>promotional</em> tools used to get me to buy fonts. As does Fonts.com (fyti) and Adobe (Remember Font&amp;Function?).</p>
<p>The fact is if I buy all the styles of Clifford separately that $390, if I buy the package that’s $330. Sorry, but I’m not giving FontShop $60 for pleasure of shopping the way I want to. $60 can be used to support another type designer (as I do in my local art community) or buy be some sneakers or buy groceries or whatever. All the fabulous things FS comes at a price.</p>
<p>So who’s being greedy me or FontShop?</p>
<p>And making a presumption, but a good one; this would be a serious profit drainer for FS (and mono/lino and anyone else). More likely the real reason why it would be a no go. Not resources nor available talent but loss of money.</p>
<p>For clarification, on the FontShop site, I wouldn’t expect that every foundry/designer that FontShop retails agree to a Vllg-style retail policy. No biggy for me, I always deal direct anyway (I don’t do middle men). I’m just wishing they all would have the Vllg spirit.</p>
<p>Again using Clifford Pro as an example, I would not care if they charged me 80 dollars a style (well I would, but anyway for example)  separately but when the all purchases reach 330 I would want all six styles.</p>
<p>Like it has been brought out, this is nothing new to me. I just have never put up with it from the very first day I swiped my credit card for type.</p>

<p>You write:</p>
<p><cite>We DO try to adjust to the current practices (larger sets and ongoing technological update). As far as pricing and distribution is concerned - and with all the admiration we do have for Village/Lucas model - we will continue to define OUR OWN pricing and logistics policies. Which doesn’t mean we are not listening to all the opinions expressed here.</cite></p>
<p>The Village model is indeed admirable, and my hope is that this model or something similar might find its way in some form or another in the upgrade policies at OurType as well.</p>
<p>I have often thought about purchasing single weights of Versa, but not having a clearly defined and friendly upgrade path has always led to hesitation and postponement because I ultimately want the whole family.  Similarly, I have had the same situation with FF Meta Serif at FontShop.</p>
<p>And it makes me wonder how many other typophiles are going through the same thought process, hesitating, postponing, not making the purchase so they can enjoy your work, and thereby not giving you the benefit of making the sale&ndash;even a small sale&ndash;which supports your own work and foundry operations.</p>
<p>The Village/ProcessType model addresses this situation admirably and you can tell from the testimonials of the owners of those foundries themselves how satisfied they are to have this model in place and how happy their customers have been.</p>
<p>So I thank you for participating in this thread, Corina.  And thank you also in advance for considering the discussions here and discussing them with your colleagues at OurType to see how you might respond now or in the future to this invitation to offer a friendly upgrade path to your customers.</p>
<p>Rahim</p>

<p>Nope, the promotional tools used to get you to buy fonts are the FontFont Focus brochures, the foundry and other special catalogues, the Newsletters and the industry mailings. Please note I took great care not to mention them.</p>

<p>As far as the taste test program goes, I think it&rsquo;s great. If Fontshop did it, I would definitely license more type. I like to buy complete families when I can, but have bought some that I&rsquo;ve regretted. So, I&rsquo;m much more careful these days now that business has slowed down a bit. Knowing that I could purchase a few weights to work with and come back later and get the family discount would be an incentive for me.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s funny. The way I see it, you can post <em>any</em> explanation for why a consumer may prefer the desired discount scheme, and get abused for it! In fact, I find <em>abuse</em> to be an excellent term to describe the initial reactions of those opposing the discount scheme in question.</p>
<p><em> &gt;Agarzola, you’re making some good points. Unfortunately your lack of tact is, to me anyway, offensive. I see you haven’t been around this forum long. Please, show some respect. You can make your point in a more diplomatic way. The type world is a small one. There are a lot of folks around here, Yves included, that give a lot to this forum.</em></p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna go out on a limb here and say that I think &ldquo;lack of tact&rdquo; is, to you and a few other people, lack of sugar coating. Because, until now, the only thing I think may be perceived as &ldquo;lack of tact&rdquo; from me towards Yves is telling him that his examples are terrible, that they do a better job of illustrating the opposition&rsquo;s points and that he should make an effort to find better sources for his examples, because each one has failed terribly. How is telling someone their examples are terrible —and illustrating precisely how inadequate those examples are, as opposed to just saying their terrible without further explanation— showing lack of respect? Am I to understand that the fact that Yves has a history in this community makes him immune to having his mistakes pointed out? Seriously?</p>
<p><em> &gt;I can’t blame Yves, or anyone else, for taking these shots at Fontshop personally. Companies aren’t anonymous organisms. They’re made up of human beings who are all trying to make a living in an industry that is faced with pirating, lack of perceived value, and other factors that threaten their business.</em></p>
<p>See, there it is again: &ldquo;these shots.&rdquo; I truly fail to see how anybody has &ldquo;taken shots&rdquo; at FontShop. Whenever anyone here has said something negative about FontShop, it has been based on factual information, people relating their actual experiences. Yet the only times I see Yves adopt an aggressively defensive position is NOT when someone points out FontShop&rsquo;s negative qualities, but when someone mentions other (smaller) vendors' positive qualities. Rahim said that he thought the discount scheme may result in &ldquo;a closer rapport with your customers&rdquo;, and Yves takes that and turns it into an attack on FontShop, asking if all the blogs, and sponsoring, and publications, etc. &ldquo;mean nothing when it comes to &lsquo;supporting a closer rapport with your customers&rsquo;?&rdquo; What&rsquo;s more, he adopts a sarcastic tone in the next paragraph: <em>Oh no, that’s right, you are correct — it’s not for their customers, it’s for the entire community.</em> I half expected him to include a little &lsquo;rolleyes&rsquo; emoticon at the end there.</p>
<p>Oh, but he&rsquo;s being tactful, I&rsquo;m sure. His sarcasm is OK, see, because he works for FontShop, so he&rsquo;s got the cred. You know what? I don&rsquo;t buy it… I simply don&rsquo;t roll the way of affording tact and respect to a person who initiated his participation in the discussion by attacking and just generally being obnoxiously rude and self-righteous towards someone as tactful, diplomatic and conciliatory as Rahim has demonstrated to be. Then saying he apologizes for his initial reaction, only to go right back to adopting the same condescending, reactionary, complex-ridden attitude that characterized his first post.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not to say I don&rsquo;t respect whatever he has brought to other discussions on this forum. It&rsquo;s not to say I don&rsquo;t appreciate whatever help he has provided in furthering the typeface design industry. It is simply that I will not respect nor walk on eggshells around his complete lack of respect, tact, good taste or ability to articulate his arguments in an effective way that properly defends his point of view. And the fact that I&rsquo;m a recently registered user shouldn&rsquo;t have anything to do with anything, unless we&rsquo;re a pack of gorillas and the alpha-male system is in effect.</p>
<p>The whole Ray Ban thing, while funny to me, was out of place and tasteless, so I stand corrected and agree to stop with the name-calling.</p>

<p>I just can’t let myself give someone extra money.</p>
<p>All this buyer vs. seller debate has been important, but it still does not change my appreciation and amazement for the people who really deserve the most admiration—the type designer.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Everyone,</p>
<p>No matter where you stand on this issue: for it, against it, curious about it, some shade or hue in between, what I like about this topic and this forum is that we are all learning more about each other as a community: our convictions, our priorities, our tolerances, our intolerances, and, yes, even our blindspots.  It shows how passionate and dedicated everyone is to the art, science, and business of type.</p>
<p>And when passions rub up against each other (take that imagery where you may&hellip;it&rsquo;s chilly outside), language habits and attitudes are going to rub up against each other too.  And when that happens, sometimes there are skirmishes, sometimes there is diplomacy.  But all that can be sorted out.  In fact, conversation is the process by which things get sorted out, no?</p>
<p>It is just so refreshing that so many people and so many foundries are here participating.  It is significant.  I don&rsquo;t know if other industries have this, if they get to have this, but this is very important and powerful.  And I&rsquo;m so honored to be among such excellent and admirable folk (sorry, channeling Bilbo for a second there&hellip;).  I can&rsquo;t quite get my head around it all just yet, but I can feel it&hellip;maybe you can too.  And maybe that&rsquo;s why we keep coming back to this board and the love of type&hellip;</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s time for a group hug.  :))</p>

Granted. We could all do without the hostility, but I&rsquo;ll be the first one to admit I&rsquo;m not a man patient enough to be civil with someone who closes his initial remarks on the subject with <em>Now stop whining and do something constructive.</em></p>
<p>Although, in all fairness, I believe it was Mr. Shinn who set the hostile tone in his first comment with: <em>Do the math, get a life, make some money, and if you’re offered a deal, don’t go dissing whoever made it because they’re not as “upgrade friendly” as your greedy heart desires</em> and then top it off in his next comment by calling the thread title <em>a provocative distortion</em> on behalf of Rahim.</p>
<p>Mr. Shinn, though, apologized and then followed up: his tone has seen great improvement. Mr. Yves&rsquo;s sarcastic, self-righteous tone has remained the same.</p>
<p><em> &gt;While we’re not a pack of gorillas, dropping into a new “community,” virtual or otherwise, with guns blazing doesn’t sit well with the locals. But that’s just me. I reserve the right to be wrong.</em></p>
<p>I agree. But I invite all here to check out my profile, under the &lsquo;Track&rsquo; section, and you&rsquo;ll find that I&rsquo;m not &ldquo;dropping into the community with guns blazing.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s just this one thread. Which is not to say I won&rsquo;t pull an awesome John Woo-esque flying-through-the-air-while-shooting-both-guns-at-the-same-time move sometime in the near future.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>@Yves - i know it&rsquo;s not <em>simple</em>, but what i was trying to say, and what i think some others have expressed, is that their may be ways to do this, so it should not be a closed book.</p>
<p>If a foundry did keep a record on my account of what i buy from them, then alerting me to the fact that i have spent equal to the family price in single purchases and offering me the extra fonts from the family &lsquo;for free&rsquo; would be helpful and a big incentive.</p>
<p>as others have said, i also hesitate to buy single weights because i know that one day i&rsquo;ll get the whole family but at greater cost then if i could afford to buy it at once. meta and meta serif are prime examples, there are many different packs and combo&rsquo;s, but when it comes down to it, i will inevitably pay more overall all by buying single weights overtime, or pay twice for some weights if i buy a pack later on.</p>
<p>i could be wrong, but do the vendors when pricing families consider each weight in the family pack to have a dollar value? or are some weights in the pack &lsquo;free&rsquo;?</p>
<p>if they do all have a dollar value, then buying a single weight, then a pack would mean i am paying for the same font twice.</p>
<p>in regard to the &lsquo;upgrades&rsquo; - when i upgrade to the new version of Photoshop, i’m getting extra code that was not in the version i previously had, so is it not similar to font families, that by &lsquo;upgrading&rsquo; at a discounted price, I&rsquo;m getting extra code i did not previously have?</p>
<p>i mean, fonts are software arn&rsquo;t they? so should we not treat them like software?</p>
<p>also, in reard to the FontFeed, Fontstruct etc being not promotional item for FontShop, i don&rsquo;t agree, i think they exist to help advertise and promote both FontShop itself - as a great industry supporter - and the prdoucts they sell. which is why Fontstruct has ads to FontShop products and the FontFeed will usually link only to FontShop products. I even experienced a comment i made on the FontFeed being edited by the moderators to link to a package i was talking about. i don&rsquo;t mind that, but to say it is not in FontShops interest to use these things for promotion is misleading. please, just be transparent, say &lsquo;yeah we do all these things so that you will see how great our products are and buy them&rsquo; i know that&rsquo;s what i would do if i were FontShop, so just be upfront about it.</p>
<p>and to be clear, i love the support FontShop gives the community/industry - but it has to be self-serving to a certain extent otherwise it isn&rsquo;t sustainable, and i for one am ok with that, cause i want FontShop to continue to do the things it does.</p>
<p>like i said earlier, this isn&rsquo;t just a FontShop thing, Lino/Mono/Adobe are in the same boat.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s cute coming from you. :^D I guess I was stupid enough to take the bait. The next comment is devoid of sarcasm, I assure you &ndash; I&rsquo;d rather you call me Yves, or Bald, or Mr. Peters if you really must. Mr. Yves sounds awkward.</p>
<p>As I explained halfway this very long thread, some of the comments ticked me off, and blinded me to the fact that the initial post was <em>not</em> yet another shot at how type is priced. The perceived value of type is declining in inverse relation to its intrinsic value, and this has made me overly sensitive to these issues. This probably wouldn&rsquo;t have happened if I&rsquo;d joined the discussion early on. My bad.</p>
<p>If some of my reactions came across as sarcastic and self-righteous, I sincerely apologize for that, particularly to Rahim who started this thread without any ill intent I&rsquo;m sure. My online behaviour usually is calm and composed as most of Typophile will be able to attest. Fortunately, incidents like these are far and long between (less than once a year), but this indeed doesn&rsquo;t give me a free ticket for comments that might have seemed excessive to some of you.</p>
<p>Simon and Mike, is it OK if I get back to your comments a bit later on, especially the &ldquo;I just can’t let myself give someone extra money&rdquo;? I still think most of us view the situation upside down, so I will make another attempt at explaining the logic behind volume discounts.</p>
<p>Now I have to do some weekend shopping, getting groceries to feed my family. ;^)</p>

<p>On the other hand, might I suggest you respond to the arguments I and others have brought to the table? Until now, all we&rsquo;ve seen is you interpreting half the comments as attacks on FontShop, and a few ill-conceived examples that don&rsquo;t help prove your points.</p>

<p>Like most foundries, I&rsquo;m quite open and receptive to new marketing ideas, but I do have an issue with the way Rahim advances his agenda with sweet talk and word bending. I don&rsquo;t use those kind of manipulative techniques to market my wares. When I implement the refund policy, that&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;ll call it, not &ldquo;friendly upgrade&rdquo;.

<p>@Nick - I would be one of those who wold gag&hellip; :-)</p>
<p>Just something i thought of - if we accept that fonts are software, then the precedent of upgrades is very common, even for completly different software.</p>
<p>eg - if i buy TypeTool from FontLab, then decide later on to &lsquo;upgrade&rsquo; to FontLab Studio, which is a completly different program, i get the origional $99 off of the FontLab Studio price.</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>FontLab Studio 5.0 for Mac OS X US $649.00 Convert the price into another currency</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>FontLab Studio 5 for Mac OS X Upgrade for registered TypeTool users   US $559.00 Convert the price into another currency Please enter your valid TypeTool serial number in the Other Notes field of the order form.</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>And Adobe does a similar thing with upgrading from Photoshop to the CS4 Suite (which is more like going from one weight to a whole family).</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.adobe.com/products/creativesuite/upgrade/">http://www.adobe.com/products/creativesuite/upgrade/</a></p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>i guess that&rsquo;s the point i&rsquo;m trying to make. that&rsquo;s all, treat fonts as software.</p>

<p>I just had an idea. What about an anonymous poll—here on Typophile? (Joe, Zara?)</p>
<p>My brain is a little tired right now, but I’m sure you can formulate better questions than these:</p>
<p>In a scenario where the foundry offers single styles of a family and there is a volume discount, Do you hold back from buying type because it may cost you more in the long run?</p>
<p>Would you buy more type if it a had a Vllg,Lucas,Process-style sales policy? How much more? Little bit to shoppathon?</p>
<p>Most of the time, do you pay for type or does your client, school, boss etc?</p>
<p>Are you more inclined to buy entire families of type or just what you need for your project?</p>
<p>Which is more important to you, price per font, family cost, or both, neither, other?</p>
<p>Do you buy type impulsively?</p>
<p>Do you always buy entire families of type or just singles or a combination?</p>
<p>Some one can surely ask better questions than these. There are overlappers, but it might lead to interesting results.</p>

<p>i guess the only way to get &lsquo;concrete&rsquo; data, is for the all the foundry/reseller/distributers to share answers to those type of questions, then compare the ones who have the &lsquo;upgrade&rsquo; system in place to the ones that don&rsquo;t and see if there are different buying habits.</p>
<p>for example, do village customers usually buy one or two fonts from a family, them come back and &lsquo;upgrade&rsquo; or do most just buy the family outright. and how does that compare to linotype customers&gt;</p>
<p>i&rsquo;m not saying that the foundary&rsquo;s <em>should</em> share this kind of data in such a place as this, because it may be something they would rather keep private, and i understand.</p>
<p>what i am saying is that only hard, cold statistics would provide any &lsquo;proof&rsquo; that one system could be better than another.</p>
<p>we all know my feelings on which system i prefer, but that does not mean i&rsquo;m &lsquo;right&rsquo; to feel that way, it just means i feel that way.</p>
<p>i hope some of that makes sense, i&rsquo;m really tired, and about to go to sleep&hellip;</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>This is quite funny &ndash; while shopping I think I noticed a valid analogy to what I&rsquo;m trying to explain. Please bear with me.</p>
<p>In the office supplies section of the supermarket I saw some pens for sale. One pen costs €1.90. The pens are available in three different colours &ndash; red, blue, and black &ndash; each available as single pens. There&rsquo;s also a package with three pens in the three colours, one of each colour. This package costs €4.90.</p>
<p>Customers have two options. Either they need the three colours, or they don&rsquo;t. Actually a third possibility would be that they need one colour straight away, but they&rsquo;re not sure if they will need the two other colours in the future.</p>
<p>Adding the price of the three separate colours results in a price tag of €5.70. As mentioned above, the package with the three colours is priced at €4.90. There are a number of reasons for this price difference of €0.80.</p>
<ul><li>If you buy the three pens in one set you only go through the cash-out system once, so it takes less man-hours, effort and administration to move the same amount of product.</li>
<li>Part of the price includes packaging and presentation in the store; having the three pens in one set uses less packaging, less effort to put in the store, and takes up less display room.</li>
<li>As buying the two first pens already costs €3.80, the third pen only costs €1.10. This may persuade the customer to buy the three pens in one package anyway, even if he/she is not sure he/she will need all three colours.</li></ul>
<p>This means the decision is all up to the customer.</p>
<ul><li>The customer buys the three pens in one package because of the reduced price, even if he/she may not be sure to need all of the colours. But hey, the last one costs less, so it's a bargain.</li>
<li>The customer only buys one pen. If he/she wants to complete the collection he/she has two options. Either he/she ends up buying the two other colours as well and will have spent €0.80 more, but those expenses are spread over time which means they have a lesser impact on his/her budget. Or the customer decides to buy the whole package, which is a bit silly because (a) he/she now has four pens, with two of the same colour and (b) he/she will have spent €1.90 more.</li></ul>
<p>The analogy with fonts works on all counts.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>There has been quite some mis- and disinformation going on in this thread, so I&rsquo;d like to rectify some things.</p>
<ul><li>Completing a type family is <em>not</em> an upgrade -- replacing your font with an improved version of that same font is an upgrade. When completing a type family you add different products; for example the italic companion of a typeface is a distinctively different item, as is a different optical size or a different weight or width. So comparing this with upgrading of software is a false representation of the facts.</li>
<li>You don't necessarily need to purchase the full package and have duplicates of certain fonts. All weights and styles are available as single fonts. The logical solution is to purchase the missing fonts, which means that in the end you'll have paid a little more and you'll have every single font only once. When you make a choice how to purchase your fonts you should acknowledge that each system has its advantages and its drawbacks. It would be unfair to want to enjoy only the benefices of the system, and expect the reseller to deal with all of the downsides.</li>
<li>Offering type families as both volumes and single fonts presents an extra budget, both in man-hours and actual cost. And each sale represents administration (invoices and payment checks), and often customer support, so logically selling single fonts will represent a higher cost for the reseller than selling one single volume. Some foundries don't even offer single fonts specifically because they don't want the hassle.</li>
<li>I'd like to come back to Jens' observations <em>"Would people who do not run a foundry or distributor, or work for one please refrain from speculation about their intentions and ideas ..."</em> and <em>"I don’t want to keep you from analysing and questioning anything, but you didn’t analyse but speculate and present it as a fact."</em>. A number of things have been presented as being facts by people who haven't got the faintest idea about budgets, investments, profit margins, volumes etc. in the type business. They have then used these so-called facts to speculate on the (ill) intentions on the part of the foundries and vendors and shed them in a negative light. You simply can't <em>do</em> that, it is unfair. This is partly why some of my reactions may have seemed sarcastic: certain statements were being made which had no relation to reality.</li></ul></div>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>What I&rsquo;m about to write now is based on deduction and my experiences with working with FontShop. As I&rsquo;m an independent contractor I have no actual numbers to support my theory, so I won&rsquo;t fall in the same trap many others have fallen into and present them as facts. This is what bugs me most &ndash; for all the theorising and speculations in this thread most of you <em>simply don&rsquo;t know.</em> I at least am willing to admit this, and I&rsquo;m better informed than most of the non-insiders (the insiders being Village, Sharon, Nick, Jens, Ivan, Stewf, Co, and Thomas Phiney; I hope I didn&rsquo;t forget anybody).</p>
<p>Basically it all comes down to pricing and profit margins, and system of distribution. A foundry is a more direct link to the customer; there is an extra step when purchasing through a vendor/reseller. This additional step means the profit margin is less, because the foundry specifies at which price a font package should be sold and the type designer keeps the same royalty share (BTW this means the &ldquo;my purchase supports the artist so you get the most money&rdquo; is a non issue, really). The lower profit margin should be compensated by the higher volume of product sold. Why do type designers sell through vendors/resellers then and not directly? Read Typographica.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s easier for a foundry or a co-op like Village to grant their customers extra discounts like the Taste Test scheme because they have a bigger profit margin per product sold &ndash; they are likely to have sufficient financial elbow-room, and implementing this kind of scheme is less complicated as they move less volume. Mind you, I said it&rsquo;s easier, but it&rsquo;s not always possible. Certain foundries prefer to set their prices lower to have a competitive edge, and as a result their profit margin is not sufficient to support this kind of scheme. It&rsquo;s all about offsetting operational costs against profit and volume &ndash; how many people does the foundry or co-op employ, what are the development and maintenance costs of the website, how much technical and sales support does the foundry provide, etc.</p>
<p>Large vendors have much, much higher operational costs. For example just take a look at the sheer size and complexity of their websites, accommodating tens of foundries and tens of thousands of fonts, all with their different set-ups and constellations. All these foundries have their own policies, so trying to devise a general discount system is not realistic, and implementing foundry-specific discount schemes means a considerable investment in development. What a large vendor can do are specific coupon actions, like FontShop is doing now in Font Magazine and with the industry-specific newsletters for people (not just customers, but anyone with a FontShop account!) who completed their professional activity in their profile (BTW this also dispels the notion that large vendors do nothing with regards to pricing). These discounts provoke a dent in no-one&rsquo;s but their own profit margin, not anybody else&rsquo;s &ndash; unless the foundry requested a promotional action and are willing to lower their prices of course. Now this much I know for sure because I recently discussed this with FontShop BeNeLux: to reach a break even on the current promotion consisting of a 15% price reduction (not even extra profit) they need to sell <em>40%</em> more fonts.</p>
<p>So basically it&rsquo;s up to the customer to decide if they prefer to have their own private discount for returning purchases, or if they&rsquo;d rather go for the convenience of having a large selection of foundries and fonts available in one spot with occasional discounts &ndash; even if they haven&rsquo;t purchased anything previously &ndash; and added benefits like free swag, information, blogs et al at the disposition of the entire community. Granted, this is a bit of a caricature, but I wanted to restore the balance a bit. ;^)</p>
<p>I hope this makes a number of things clear.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>There&rsquo;s a huge difference between targeted actions and hard sell, and the many things FontShop does that guarantee even less they will have any return on. For example a large portion of the content of Font Magazine has no relation with FontShop product at all, and we continually link to non-FontShop foundries in FontFeed posts (Silas Dilworth, Hoefler &amp; Frere-Jones, The Foundry, &hellip; check it yourself!) &ndash; the only thing the FontFeed editors will do is link to the FontShop website if it&rsquo;s available there, and we won&rsquo;t link to competing large vendors because that would be, you know, fairly stupid, even bordering on suicidal. :^D Of course you are correct that anything we do is somehow aimed at furthering the idea that FontShop is reliable and knows what it&rsquo;s doing, but not necessarily at trying to sell you something. So I stand by what I said.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>thanks yves. please understand i&rsquo;m not attacking you, or fontshop or other large vendors.</p>
<p>as i&rsquo;ve stated earlier, i&rsquo;m really happy with all the things fontshop does for the community, and want it to continue.</p>
<p>as i&rsquo;ve also said earlier, for me personally, the &lsquo;upgrade&rsquo; system is very handy and is a selling point.</p>
<p>when you said that:</p>
<p><em><strong>Completing a type family is not an upgrade — replacing your font with an improved version of that same font is an upgrade.

<p>does that mean that when i <em>upgrade</em> from photoshop to the entire creative suite, it&rsquo;s not really an upgrade either, and that i should buy the rest of the suite program by program? it seems adobe and other software companies call adding more programs (or pieces of different software) to my &lsquo;package&rsquo; an upgrade, and will give me discounts for doing that (both from older versions and single programs out of the suite)</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.adobe.com/products/creativesuite/upgrade/">http://www.adobe.com/products/creativesuite/upgrade/</a></p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>is that not true?</p>
<p>and if they can do it with programs that are not available as a download (like CS4), then maybe there is a way for large vendors to looking into it as well.</p>
<p>but having said that, i see your point of lower margins etc, and see that in the case of fontshop, they have chosen a different way to appeal to customers.</p>
<p>@nick - i&rsquo;ve never thought of it being possible that i would then have 2 licenses for a single weight if i bought it first, then the family later under the normal system. thanks for pointing this out.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Yves: <cite> [. . .] because the foundry specifies at which price a font package should be sold and the type designer keeps the same royalty share (BTW this means the “my purchase supports the artist so you get the most money” is a non issue, really). </cite></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yves, I&rsquo;m not sure if I&rsquo;m misinterpreting what you meant by this, but I would like to clarify that I do in fact make less money when Whitman is licensed through a reseller (like FontShop, Fonts.com, Phil&rsquo;s Fonts, et al.) than when it is licensed through Font Bureau directly.</p>
<p>My royalty arrangement with Font Bureau is a percentage of FB&rsquo;s actual revenue from Whitman. When a font of Whitman is licensed through a reseller, some portion of the fee goes to that reseller, naturally, and the portion that comes to Font Bureau is less than if they had made the &ldquo;sale&rdquo; themselves. They then divide that reduced portion according to the agreed percentage and I get my royalty. I can tell you from my royalty statements that I do in fact make less per unit licensed through FontShop than through Font Bureau.</p>
<p>This is not a criticism, just a clarification in case anyone else read that statement the way I did.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s the way this business works and I have absolutely no problem with it. I am happy to have FontShop licensing out fonts of Whitman and reaching new customers. Stephen, Yves, and gang have been generous in marketing and promoting Whitman through various FontShop vehicles, and FSI deserves all the cut they get.</p>
<p>From what Stephen has written, I understand that the arrangement between FontFont (the foundry) and its designers is different: the type designer gets a fixed royalty amount per font licensed, independent of what channel it&rsquo;s licensed through. So, no matter how many additional middle men divvy up the &ldquo;sale,&rdquo; the designer gets the same dollar amount (or Euro or whatever ;-). I think I&rsquo;ve stated this accurately, and it&rsquo;s an interesting stance. In this case, Yves&rsquo;s parenthetical comment quoted here would indeed be true. But I believe this is more the exception, rather than the rule.</p>

<p><strong>I think it’s easier for a foundry or a co-op like Village to grant their customers extra discounts like the Taste Test scheme because they have a bigger profit margin per product sold — they are likely to have sufficient financial elbow-room, and implementing this kind of scheme is less complicated as they move less volume. Mind you, I said it’s easier, but it’s not always possible.</strong></p>
<p>Please note that Mr Peters does not have any knowledge of Village&rsquo;s profit margin or other financial details, and he is completely wrong in his assertion that our profit margin is bigger than that at large distributors. In fact, we offer the industry&rsquo;s most generous distributor/foundry share split, in keeping with our co-operative philosophy.</p>
<p>Village chooses to offer our clients the Taste Test because we feel that it is morally right not to charge people for the same thing twice. It&rsquo;s not more complicated than that. The size of our company and the volume of our sales are not factors in our decision to offer the Taste Test.</p>
<p>Without giving away proprietary information, I can reveal that orders which involve the Taste Test make up a very small percentage of our total sales. It is not arduous in the least for us to manage.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p><cite>does that mean that when i <em>upgrade</em> from photoshop to the entire creative suite, it’s not really an upgrade either, and that i should buy the rest of the suite program by program? it seems adobe and other software companies call adding more programs (or pieces of different software) to my ’package’ an upgrade, and will give me discounts for doing that (both from older versions and single programs out of the suite)</cite></p>
<p>Adobe is like the cardealer who will give you a ‘lower’ price for a new car in the form of a trade in price for your old one. You probably won’t keep two cars running. Same with PhotoShop 6, that won’t even run on a new Mac ; ). And Adobe has you locked in a very lucrative upgrade path for years to come. That’s called marketing… [; )</p>
<p>But OT: Buying anything is a complex process. One has to consider a lot of things. Immediate benefit vs long term. Same with the cost. Return on investment. Etc. Doesn’t matter whether it is a fridge or a font.</p>
<p>Village et al are smart in the sense that they understand their market. Selling bits and bytes, there is no loss in taking back a bunch you sold before in lieu of an additional sale of a product that has a very low cost/sale ratio. You know what software makers say about their product: the first box produced is the most expensive, to the order of (tens of) millions of dollars. They start raking it in after the cost has been recovered (take a look at MicroSoft’s numbers).</p>
<p>Wish that car dealers would do the same as Village cs.</p>

<p><em><strong><em>Offering type families as both volumes and single fonts presents an extra budget, both in man-hours and actual cost. And each sale represents administration (invoices and payment checks), and often customer support, so logically selling single fonts will represent a higher cost for the reseller than selling one single volume. Some foundries don’t even offer single fonts specifically because they don’t want the hassle.</em></strong></em></p>
<p>While credit card processing, server farm maintenance, etc might be an all-out hassle for a small organization, it’s not true for many businesses that are of the same scale as FontShop. Myfonts, a competing distributor, would have gone under a long time ago if that was the dominating factor&hellip; you already know they sell plenty of smaller cheaper fonts. As an example, Letraset—while not cheapo in quality—has a collection that mostly revolves around display scripts and one-time purchases. (Someone important said scripts sell the most) In fact, FontShop distributes fonts from foundries whose portfolio revolves around such. Certainly FontShop isn’t repelling those foundries either—no—in fact they are being marketed to increasingly as we speak. See Coles’s post. Even foundries like Letraset with a much lower cost per font than your own collection.</p>
<p>Aren’t the billing(customer) and payment(designer- like Akira) systems automated? Someone is not punching in these numbers manually all the time right? A check is being drawn up each time we make a sale? No. Its culled from a database of receipts and however they do, the designer will get a check at the agreed time right?</p>
<p><em><strong><em>Basically it all comes down to pricing and profit margins, and system of distribution.</em></strong></em></p>
<p>Finally we get to it!</p>
<p>Yes, the $60 I used as an example in the Clifford Pro scenario is a big deal to me, just as it to FontShop. That “little bit more” your talking about is a significant part of the business isn’t it?</p>
<p>FS can make big chunk of cash now with 330</p>
<p>or make charge extra for the buyer who wants purchase over time 390</p>
<p>I suppose if I was the owner of FontShop I would not be too thrilled with Vllg-style policy either especially considering singles are offered at the higher price per font.</p>
<p>This is why I think a poll would be relevant in this discussion because I would assert most people buy singles or smaller couplings of type. If there poll was that showed that customers hold back from buying complete type systems because of the disincentive, it might give more impetus for FontShop and others to give serious consideration to the Vllg-style license. It would depend if the foundry/reseller wanted to invest in a system that was efficient towards the new policy&hellip; which would take lots of effort. I personally think the many more people would buy type more often and, as we all know, FontShop really knows how to market—it would be no little secret.</p>
<p><em>so trying to devise a general discount system is not realistic</em></p>
<p>How about just the FontFont collection? The customer-specific coupons are already in place. I am really not interested in thing else with FS, well except maybe the foundries that only sell through FS (ARS TYPE), but really your own collection. Certainly maintaining what’s your own is easier right? Has FS considered offering discounts for underperforming families?</p>
<p>Mike Diaz :-)</p>
<p>BTW&hellip; I have <strong>never</strong> had a coupon offer from FontShop. :-( I thought it was an Emigre thing: discounts on bland pottery and magazines I would never buy or read. When do these coupons come around?</p>

<p>and i intend on using the code very soon!</p>
<p>also, didn&rsquo;t chester say:</p>
<p><cite>Without giving away proprietary information, I can reveal that orders which involve the Taste Test make up a very small percentage of our total sales. It is not arduous in the least for us to manage.<cite></p>
<p>so it seems that at least for village, the taste test does not increase sales.</p>
<p>of course this goes against what i would expect, as i am one of those who use the taste test.</p>
<p>but it&rsquo;s interesting that village does it not for sales reasons, but moral ones:</p>
<p><cite>Village chooses to offer our clients the Taste Test because we feel that it is morally right not to charge people for the same thing twice. It’s not more complicated than that. The size of our company and the volume of our sales are not factors in our decision to offer the Taste Test.<cite></p>

He could have chosen a similarly priced —but not similarly ‘upgradeable’— typeface from a different vendor, yet he chose a (presumably) equally satisfying typface from VLLG, which gives him the ‘upgrade’ option discussed in this thread.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>One thing that I don&rsquo;t <em>think</em> has been addressed is that, aside from all matters of policy, a scheme like this is much less straightforward to implement on a large, preexisitng site than if you&rsquo;re making that decision from the start of the design process. Earlier in the thread, Mr Jenkins from Village said:</p>
<p><em>The Taste Test has been Village policy since Day One. In fact, it was always our policy at Thirstype in Chicago too.</em></p>
<p>I actually remember this being the case when Village launched their site (which is an excellent example of a site which is both beautiful and practical, while I&rsquo;m at it). As somebody who works primarily on the web (only occasionally in any kind of development role) I can vouch for the fact that it&rsquo;s a whole different thing to implement something like this once a site or application has been out in the wild for even a short while. Updating an exisiting system always comes with its own challenges, and there&rsquo;s no guarantee that the data stored about customer&rsquo;s previous purchases will be enough to launch something like this right off.</p>
<p>In this scenario, what do you do? Start the new policy only on later purchases? This isn&rsquo;t necessarily a situation that will look like a goodwill gesture to existing customers. So at this point, a technical difficulty can become an issue of policy - all of which will take time to resolve.</p>
<p>These are just a few points - obviously I make no claims to know anything about the inner workings of any of these suppliers. Just trying to bring something to the table that I haven&rsquo;t seen mentioned elsewhere. Certainly not to take away from Village&rsquo;s policy, which I think is an excellent idea. But this is <em>always</em> the advantage that smaller, newer businesses have over larger competitors - the ability to implement bold strategies quickly and effectively, due to having less &lsquo;baggage&rsquo;. Village should certainly be praised for having such a customer-friendly policy, but I don&rsquo;t think at this stage the larger sellers should be demonised for <em>not</em> following suit.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>you&rsquo;re right about not demonising the larger guys, i agree.</p>
<p>as long as they do make an effort to see if this is something that might eventually be workable, i&rsquo;m cool.</p>
<p>and as i&rsquo;ve said before, both here and on my blog, i really like fontshop, as well as village and others, no matter their size or policy. as long as they treat me fairly and help me when i need it, i&rsquo;m happy.</p>
<p>i know some of you are thinking &lsquo;but it&rsquo;s not fair to charge twice for a font&rsquo; which of course is how this whole thread got started, and i&rsquo;m not saying it is fair, what i meant was that when i choose to purchase from somewhere like fontshop, i accept the way they do business in order to get the goods i want. if, right now, that means no taste test policy, so be it. ultimatly, if their products are good enough, i&rsquo;ll buy from them.</p>
<p>does that make sense?</p>

<p>[[http://www.type-together.com/|Type Together]], the foundry that brought you Maiola, Karmina, Bree, Ronnia, etc, also offers a &ldquo;taste test&rdquo;-like policy.</p>
<p>I just got confirmation from Veronika Burian herself, one of the two founders of Type Together, that if you buy single weights from her foundry and buy the family package later, they will refund you the price of the single weights.  She mentioned that this has always been their policy, and they will work on communicating that more explicitly on their new website.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.type-together.com/">http://www.type-together.com/</a></p>
<p>Enjoy!

<p>Nevertheless, dollar or euros—this a great opportunity to snatch some up of their fine collection in a painless way.</p>

<p>Overall, while I understand the motives of bigger foundries not to offer such a thing, I as a graphic designer myself want to make the whole experience as convenient as possible. After all we compete with much bigger companies and I think that this kind of policy will be standard for all smaller foundries quite soon.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Wow, awesome thread. I stopped reading at 23.Nov.2008, and I know this horse has been dead for a while now, but I felt compelled to say that as a consumer in a free market, your strongest weapon is your choice of patronage. Just as a business has the right to charge as much or as little as they want for what they sell, a consumer has the right to decide where to spend his or her money. It&rsquo;s only when an industry colludes to artificially control prices that, in my opinion, consumers have any leg to stand on when demanding change.</p>
<p>So foundries, by all means – charge what you deem appropriate for your fonts – if you&rsquo;re product is good enough, someone will buy it. It&rsquo;s obviously up to the business-owner to maintain that equilibrium of price and quality. Just stay honest, and don&rsquo;t count on anyone to bail you out if you eff it up!</p>
