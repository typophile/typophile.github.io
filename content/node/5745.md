body: LEXIA READABLE adopted by Dyslexia.com <BR> <BR> <BR>&#34;I am not utterly convinced
  that Lexia is superior to ComicSans &#40;my personal favorite&#41;, which is also
  available to our users -- but I do have to note that as soon as I converted our
  site to the Lexia readable view, I immediately spotted a typographical error on
  the page that had previously eluded me. <BR> <BR>Lexia has been accepted for inclusion
  in the site customization feature of the Dyslexia.com web site.&#34; <BR> <BR>Abigail
  Marshall,  Davis Dyslexia Association International,  <a href="http://www.dyslexia.com/"

  are now available for free download from the K-Type website, <a href="http://www.k-type.com"
  target="_blank">www.k-type.com</a> <BR>LEXIA Readable is totally free to use and
  distribute. <BR> <BR> <BR>K-Type has designed it using Comic Sans, the font widely
  promoted by educationalists in the UK, as the basic model for legible weight and
  spacing, but has removed the sometimes problematical American childrens&#39; comic
  book style in favour of more grown-up contemporary typographical elements, whilst
  still retaining a slightly hand-drawn feel. <BR> <BR>K-Type designer Keith Bates
  said, &#34;Comic Sans is considered culturally inappropriate or too whimsical for
  many uses, older students can feel patronized. It might be good for infant typography
  and &#39;Baby on Board&#39; stickers, but its use risks undermining any serious
  message and appearing condescending to readers with greater visual maturity, and
  that&#39;s particularly important when applied to adolescent and adult literacy.&#34;  <BR>
  <BR>Typographical concerns from recent educational publications and discussions,
  and some highlighted by the British Dyslexia Association have been incorporated
  into the design of Lexia - the simpler, handwritten forms of a and g, the non-symmetry
  of letters such as b and d, good sized descenders and ascenders, generous spacing
  and good screen clarity. <BR> <BR> <BR><a href="http://www.k-type.com" target="_blank">www.k-type.com</a>

  body: The research into the Lexia name was too scant, it&#39;s true - I&#39;ve since
    discovered TWO fonts called Lexia, and I don&#39;t suppose this duplicate naming
    is a first in fontdom - I&#39;m hoping that our font being Lexia Readable &#40;and
    free for those with reading difficulties/dyslexics!&#41; will dissuade Dalton
    Maag from suing K-Type for every penny it hasn&#39;t got. <BR> <BR>If I have to
    change the name, I might take up Vincent&#39;s suggestion of &#39;Our Kid&#39;.
    . . or maybe &#39;Comic Sons&#39;?
