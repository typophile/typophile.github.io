  Topics\" feature, since I have no memory...). Kudos to whoever put this together.\r\n\r\nBefore
  joining, this site provided the answers to many questions I have had in the past
  and tried Googling. But I didn't realize how many quality fontmakers there are sharing.
  \r\n\r\nSo I have decided to become a member, but haven't been able to view the
  T-shirts because the links gave me a \"page not found\" message. Could it be my
  settings, or are the links bad?\r\n\r\n"

    conclusion that Typcon looks like fun, but some of the dancing was kind of scary.

  body: "I was just about to start the application, then saw this:\r\n\r\n\"Typophile
    will be implementing a subscription system to replace the application form. Don't
    worry, you'll get a chance to support Typophile, get cool shirts, access to your
    own Typophile Blog and a lifelong email address at your favorite domain. In the
    meantime we are not accepting membership applications. Sorry for any inconvenience
    this may cause.\"\r\n\r\nBut the \"join now\" link still works. Before I fill
    it out, I want to clarify this. If there are no more applications being accepted,
    can I reserve a Typophile XL shirt?\r\n"
