  body: That's indeed a [[squooshed]] heavy weight of Gill Sans, but I think you're
    better off using a true condensed version, like [[Bitstream]]'s <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=catalog.fontdetail&displayfontid=BT.107644.0.0&attributes.sampleSize=48&sampleText=bac&sampleSize=96"
    target="new">Humanist 521 Extra Bold Condensed</a>.
