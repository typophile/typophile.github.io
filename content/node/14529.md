  I convert to outlines and print, the text appears considerably heavier than if just
  printed as text.\r\n\r\nHow will this affect the final printing on press? Do most
  printers usually ask for text outlines? Or can they be delivered postscript? \r\n\r\nAny
  insight for this screen specialist is appreciated.\r\n\r\n -t\r\n\r\n"

  body: "This is normal, and it's due to the difference in rendering methods between
    text and objects, the latter coming out an average of 1/2 a pixel fatter around
    the edges. On a laser printer, this is pretty obvious; but the good news is that
    on an imagesetter it's only really visible for really small type, like less than
    8 point.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    (even hairline) is stating the obvious. But often the most obvious answer is the
    right one ;-) \r\n\r\nKnowing the OS and laser printer used to output the proofs
    might be helpful. \r\n\r\nSi "

    and it was VERY obvious. I actually have a couple of nibs at 7pt in the design.
    Do you think there's a need to be concerned? I suppose I should just talk to the
    printer about this.\r\n\r\ntbiddy:\r\n\r\nI do not have a RIP. Please explain...\r\n\r\nsi:\r\n\r\nOS

  body: In my experience, Hrant's right on here. It will not be a problem when you
    take the work to press -- provided press is the final output for your work. If
    your work is meant to live in laser print, you'll have to decide how much you
    care about the weight gain.

  body: "Joe, I'm not confident it won't be a problem on printer ripped files. \r\n\r\nAsk
    for a proof, perhaps before the job goes into the printer's workflow. \r\n\r\nAlso
    try making a print optimized pdf with the outlines and non-outlined letters side
    by side. Then blow up the pdf in your pdf viewr to the max. This might tell you
    something. If the result is fatter, try making just the inside of the outlined
    letters have colour, not the outlines themselves. \r\n\r\nI have not needed to
    do this but these are things I would try."

  body: In my opinion don't make outlines of type. I've never met a client that didn't
    make changes. The other point is why can't you pick up the phone and call the
    printer and talk to them about the format they want files. Output to PDF may well
    be the best way but only your printer could tell you that. It amazes me that we
    are in the communications business and how little communication actually goes
    on.

    shop and sees all manner of utter crap coming through the door (and whose jobs
    it often becomes to make that crap printable), I would say this is excellent advice
    which ought to be tattooed on every designer's forehead."

  body: "I don't have enough practical experience to know the exact thresholds, plus
    it's an individual perceptional issue to some extent. But my hunch is that at
    7pt, if you get the imagesetter to run at max res (~3000?) you'll only suffer
    a slightly visible gain in weight: something that a type specimen might worry
    about, but not an \"end piece\".\r\n\r\n> blow up the pdf in your pdf viewr to
    the max.\r\n\r\n1) Screen rendering algorithms aren't [necessarily] the same as
    print ones, so I doubt you'll get a real view.\r\n2) It's hard to mentally/visually
    draw a parallel from screen to hi-res print.\r\n\r\n> don\u2019t make outlines
    of type.\r\n> PDF\r\n\r\nDon't some EULAs forbid embedding, legally or even mechanically?
    Of course, the Emigre EULA for one seems to prohibit just making outlines too...\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "Outlines destroy hinting and are slightly heavier. So they are best avoided
    but it's not always possible. PDFs coming out of InDesign for example often have
    CID font encoding which some older RIPs cannot handle. Most of the problems I
    have with this is with newspapers. In that case I will export an EPS and then
    Distill.\r\nTalking to the printer is the best advice here. Get a proof. I never
    outline fonts unless I have to but I also don't fret over the issue\u2026\r\n\r\n-
