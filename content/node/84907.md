  anyone knows of anything that is pretty much exactly like this but slightly more
  legible I'd appreciate it.  There are many tattoo-esque fonts out there but many
  of them look tacky.  I'm doing an identity for a post-rock, creepy, epic, heavy
  instrumental band and Cadaver Ink is almost perfect but not quite good enough. \r\n\r\nIf
  anyone can suggest what styles I should seach for too, I don't quite know what the
  proper term is for that kind of shading within the letters and it'd help if I could
  find out.  I've searched for Tuscan style fonts but they're often too 'fun' and
  western looking for what I need.  Cadaver Ink is appropriately dark so keep that
  in mind.  Just no metal fonts...\r\n\r\nThanks\r\n\r\nJQ"

    case.  Maybe get in touch with some local tattoo artists?
