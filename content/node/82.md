body: anybody know if this is a custom font of if there is an actual font that&#39;s
  similar to the one here <a href="http://www.thesle.com/displaylogo.php?id=559" target="_blank">www.thesle.com/displaylogo.php?id=559</a>
  and if you know any that are close but maybe not exact please tell me those b/c
  i&#39;m trying to find any fonts that are similar to this style to do some logoing
  like the JBU stuff - and if they&#39;re free fonts then that&#39;s EVEN BETTER!
  lol  <BR>thanks guys  <BR>the danger... <BR> <BR>ps - the &#34;Radio&#34; American
  Eagle - is that only a commercial font or is there somewhere i could get it or something
  similar for free or cheap &#40;really limited budget here - lol&#41; thanks

  body: You might find something similar to what&#39;s used in the JBU logo  <BR>at
    <a href="http://www.letterheadfonts.com/" target="_blank">Letterhead Fonts</a>.
    <BR> <BR>You will not find anything of similar quality to Radio for free. <BR>Fine
    scripts take hundreds of hours to create. You almost <BR>always get what you pay
    for.
