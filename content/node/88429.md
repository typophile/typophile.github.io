body: "I previously asked a question about using two different sans serifs, but I
  don't want that to turn into a \"don't pair two sans serif\" argument, so I'll try
  to come at it from a different angle.\r\n\r\nI'm designing a book layout for an
  industrial design portfolio. I'm going for a modern appearance. I want to use a
  thick geometric sans serif like Gotham Ultra for headings, and either Mercury or
  Miller for body copy such as multiple paragraphs of text. My problem is what to
  use for a collection of only a few sentences? I like the look of a sans serif, but
  gotham doesn't look appropriate. Do I use a different sans serif all together that
  works for headings and body copy? Do I keep Gotham and use the serif anyways? Do
  I just use gotham for body copy? Or is it acceptable to use a second sans serif
  such as Benton Sans or Whitney as long as I keep the headings in all caps?\r\n\r\n"

  body: By a collection of a few sentences, do you mean pull quotes, etc? I may get
    flayed for saying so (I am a noob typesetter in the real world and a noob on this
    board), but I think Avenir looks good in sentence case (initial uppercase followed
    by lower) alongside all-caps Gotham headlines, and yeah, I'm not that sold on
    Gotham in sentence case.

  body: I understand that it's confusing. I couldn't insert an image for whatever
    reason, but I've included what I'm trying to refer to in the attachments. I'm
    only planning on using a serif for a couple pages at the end and beginning of
    the portfolio, that are in paragraph form. The majority of the text in the portfolio
    be short descriptions such as this.

  body: "Not a bad suggestion at all. I like the style and it is something I could
    use for sure, but not quite what I'm looking at for this project.\r\n\r\nI've
    posted another option (Alright Sans) in the attachments that get's closer to what
    I'm looking for. I like that It's somewhere between gotham and Whitney or Benton
    Sans. The Caps are perfect, and I like the lower case a and g, but the x height
    seems a little too high for my taste. Is there anything else that someone can
    suggest? Or is this the closest I'm going to get do you think?"

  body: Yes, I suggest you pick a different sans that works in both levels. Your challenge
    is finding a face with enough punch for headlines that still reads well smaller.
    For a few sentences, like a lead in or pull quote, you don't need go as far as
    a text face.
