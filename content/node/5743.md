  body: I think this is a modeification of a Modern font, such as ITC Modern No. 20.
    If you just cover up those missing serifs I think you get this look.

  body: Here is a simulation of this, compared to the original. I used ITC Modern
    No. 216 in Light weight. I can see I should have used heavier, but this demonstrates
    the idea. I made blank white squares/rectangles to block off parts of the top
    serifs and most of the foot serifs. I think this is how it was done. <BR><img

  body: Yep, thanks for the tip. I wound up doing this to a version of Bodoni to recreate
    the logo. I think there is a typeface of this somewhere though, maybe T26 or some
    company like that. <BR> <BR>Good call. Thanks for the help! <BR> <BR> <BR>doug

  body: Doug, The reason I picked Modern was the very long tail on the &#39;a&#39;,
    but I can see Bodoni is also very similar. It is the sort of font that T-26 or
    maybe Psy-Ops could have, but I couldn&#39;t find one. I like the simple approaches
    for making &#39;one of a kind&#39; titles, and blocking out parts of letters is
    easier than modifying letter outlines, or designing a new font. <BR> <BR>Sometimes
    it&#39;s even easier than finding an obscure font that might not exist.

    target="_blank">Modern No. 20</a>, the old Stephenson Blake face, not the ITC
    one. With the serifs lopped off, as you say Mike, and stretched.

  body: Yes, I agree Mark. I mentioned No. 20 in my first response, but the version
    I had looked too far off the sample and so I used the ITC font to demonstrate
    the way I thought it was done.
