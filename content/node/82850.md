body: "Hello,\r\n\r\nI've used a font in Microsoft Word, which works fine except when
  I need to type circumflex-accented glyphs.\r\nIn general, I've noticed that when
  you type a circumflex, before typing the letter you want to accentuate, you temporarily
  get the ASCII circumflex. Then, when you type the letter, say \"a\", the correct
  circumflex is used in the pre-built accented glyph.\r\nSo, in the present case,
  when I type \"^\" plus \"a\", Microsoft Word changes to Times. This behaviour rang
  a bell, so I opened the font in FLS and the ASCII circumflex is missing from the
  problematic font file. My assumption is that as Word can't find that glyph (ASCII
  circumflex), it switches to another default font.\r\n\r\n2 questions:\r\n\r\n\u2013
  Is it a Microsoft Word \"bug\"?\r\n\r\n\u2013 How can you avoid such a problem if
  you design a typeface and don't feel like drawing the ASCII circumflex?\r\n\r\nThanks
  & best,\r\n\r\nMathieu"

    especially if nobody will ever use it, say in the case of a custom font for a
    client.\r\nAnyway, if I understand correctly, you presume that a font should work
    fine without that missing ASCII circumflex glyph."

  body: "From your description of the symptoms, I would say yes. I would also point
    out that this is not a character that no one ever uses\u2014you used it yourself
    when you typed the sequence for acircumflex. Leaving out a standard character
    that applications expect to be present, you risk having things like this occur.
    Whatever benefits you think it may provide, it's probably not worth it, as your
    problem illustrates."

    have no idea which MS Word version you are using, but typing first the accent
    and then the characters makes it sound like Mac stuff. When I typed the <em>alt
    + i</em> combination before a character in Word X (it is old, I know) I got the
    circumflex (uni02c6) first and not the asciicircum (uni005e). So, this beats me.\r\n\r\n<em>My
    assumption is that as Word can\u2019t find that glyph (ASCII circumflex), it switches

    is not specific for MS Word, I reckon.\r\n\r\n<em>[...] especially if nobody will
    ever use it.</em>\r\n\r\nThere comes a day that somebody wants to use <em>your</em>
    asciicircum as an operator for exponentiation.\r\n\r\nMark: <em>Leaving out a

    there applications that expect certain characters to be present in a font?\r\n\r\nFEB\r\n"

  body: "Mark: <em>[...] missing characters can cause problems that may be confusing
    to users [...]</em>\r\n\r\nWith the current open standard for glyph sets that
    exceeds the single byte encodings, it is hard to define what is exactly missing.
    Personally I would not mess with the code page(s) a font is supposed to cover,
    and especially not with the ASCII set. \r\n\r\nThat being said, I deliberately
    messed with our single byte Turkish small caps fonts (PS Type1, TrueType, no OTL
    features), in which I placed a dot on the i. To be honest, I am still not sure
    whether that was the best thing to do, but it seemed the most logical solution
    to me at that time. \r\n\r\nAs many of you probably will remember, in the early
    days of PostScript fonts some designers chose font specific encoding to circumvent
    the automatic insertion of the Symbol set in a font with Adobe Standard Encoding,
    and used the vacant slots for for instance extra ligatures. Changing fonts could
    lead to surprising results this way, as one can imagine.\r\n\r\nIn the old (1989)
    AGFA Compugraphic <em>Typeface Design Criteria Manual</em> an extra function for
    an alternate variant of the \u2018ASCII Circumflex\u2019 character is mentioned:
    \u2018<em>Character should center on character 7281 (alternate vertical bar) so
    these form an arrow when used together</em>\u2019.\r\n\r\nFEB\r\n\r\n"

    (after all the drawing one at the KABK).\r\n\r\nI'm using the latest Office 2011
    version but I'm not typing the accented characters with the special combination
    of keys. I basically type the key that show a circumflex, apparently it's the
    ASCII one on my Mac keyboard, and then the letter I need to accentuate.\r\n\r\nIt
    makes sense to try complying to a \"standard\" character set and this example
    definitely proves that."
