  body: "Hello Michael\r\n\r\nDo you mean the diacritic vowels? Tasmeem is an Arabic
    typography and calligraphy publishing plugin software.  In that video, Thomas
    Milo of Decotype who is the key person behind the software was demonstrating how
    to convert a plain text title into a calligraphic piece!\r\n\r\n-Saad "

  body: "Yes Saad it was very impressive. I posted it in our community site and they
    were amazed. I hope a simplified version of its text engine become the standard
    rendering in computers. A simplified version that then could port the text to
    professional tools such as Tasmeem for graphic enhancements.\r\nIf designers could
    design only different patterns of a string of characters (their body only) then
    position their individual dots and vowels etc., all by remaining in Unicode encoding
    logic, the Arabic script can benefit in computer usage as a whole and not just
    in specialized graphic tools.\r\nThis is the area I'm not very clear about Decotype
    project. I don't know how much of it depends on specially designed font tools
    to facilitate this concept and how much of it depends on the behaviour of the
    text engine itself."

    text engine itself.\r\n\r\nDecotype or DT format fonts only need to supply main
    letter forms and diacretic dots and vowels separately, based on a variety of Tasmeem
    FL template.  The engine in Tasmeem would then set text by default with diacritic
    placement and inter-word spacing as desired by font designer.  A font for Tasmeem
    can be as simple as a typical OT Arabic font, but it can take advantage of many
    of layout engine features on the fly.\r\n\r\n-Saad  \r\n\r\n"

  body: "Thank you Saad. My impression at the beginning was that it was typographic
    but as the piece wore on it became, as you said, very calligraphic. Wonderful
    to watch, even for the third time!\r\n\r\nMichael"

  body: "From what Karsten L\xFCcke explained me, all the Arabic letters within the
    OTF files of the Tasmeem typefaces are assigned PUA (Private Use Area) Unicode
    values, and they are then converted by the Tasmeem engine on the fly as InDesign
    position them on the page, so the final text remains Unicode-savy and fully searchable.\r\n\r\nShould
    the text be converted to plain text it would remain OK to be set in an ordinary
    Unicode Arabic face, right?"

  body: Yes. The backing store of text remains standard Unicode Arabic. The PUA codepoints
    are used only internally by the ACE engine during display.

  body: "Hi Saad,\r\n\r\nThis demo was not made by me. I saw this video for the first
    time today. I am pretty sure that it was made my WinSoft's ME representative.
    Here's one I prepared, but withdrew after a few days, because of the low quality
    of the conversion (I find u-toob a bad medium for typographic demo's - you lose
    too much detail. ):\r\n\r\nwww.decotype.com/MARA/MaraLayout02.mov.zip\r\n\r\nIt
    shows Tasmeem work on what appears highly calligraphic typesetting, but that must
    be attributed to the Naskh typeface. It doesn't take a lot of imagination that
    such tools are also very practical for typesetting regular text.\r\n\r\nThomas
