  at buying either Benton Sans or News Gothic No.2. \r\n\r\nBenton is what Frere Jones
  redrew after studying Morris Fuller Bentons original drawings of News Gothic. While
  News Gothic No.2 is a family of news gothic with additional weights created by Linotype.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.fontbureau.com/fonts/BentonSans/more\r\n\r\nhave
  a look to see some comparative images. I felt that benton had some issues with the
  size of the counters especially in the heavier weights and some issues with the
  kerning. is it just me? What do you guys think? Benton was used to type set 2 Kilo's
  of KesselKramer and it looks good there. So am quite confused right now.\r\n\r\nWhat
  would you spend your money on?\r\n\r\nThanks for the time!\r\n--\r\nArjun"

  body: I haven't used either one, but I would go with Benton, because of the wide
    range of widths and weights and because it's been used in quite a few publications.

  body: 'Benton Sans has been expanded and it seems redrawn (how much is not clear
    on the Font Bureau web site) by Cyrus Highsmith. It was used for the TypeCon convention
    booklet by Armin Vit, and just looked awesome, with the different weights working
    together beautifully. '

  body: "> the different weights \r\n\r\nThe width of the left vertical stem of the
    capital H may be used as a measurement for the different weights.\r\n\r\nsee www.sanskritweb.net/temporary/stem-width-1.jpg\r\n\r\nA
    peculiarity of the old News Gothic (and also of the later Trade Gothic) was that
    the normal weight of News Gothic was thinner than the normal weight of other fonts,
    but thicker than the light weight of other fonts.\r\n\r\nIf we apply a UPM of
    1000 units, then the normal weight of Helvetica has a stem width of 97 units (or
    9.7 % of the em), and the light weight of Helvetica has a stem width of 68 units
    (or 6.8 % of the em), whereas the normal weight of the old News Gothics is exactly
    in-between. For instance, the normal weight of News Gothic BT is 79 units (and
    for example the normal weight of Trade Gothic LT is 80 units).\r\n\r\nBut the
    normal weight of Benton Sans has 88 units and therefore is too thick.\r\n\r\nsee
    www.sanskritweb.net/temporary/stem-width-2.jpg\r\n\r\nIf you prefer the in-between
    weight peculiarity of the old News Gothic font, you should use old digitisations,
    e.g. News Gothic BT, which is a clone of the old Linotype News Gothic.\r\n"

  body: "Uli, we all know your viewpoint on how almost everyone is a forger, as you
    have repeated it ad nauseum. Give it a rest when it's not on topic. \r\n\r\nIt
    is the \"book\" weight, not the \"normal\" in Benton Sans that seems to most closely
    match the original News Gothic. "

  body: "The advantage to Benton Sans is that the family expands across a range of
    widths. News Gothic revivals can\u2019t get you there unless you want to start
    cobbling together a mix of Gothic faces, which would be fun, but hard to explain
    to clients."

    Gothic #2. There is something about the way the letters are drawn that I like
    more than Benton Sans. It seems a little more graceful and dynamic. That''s my
    personal opinion though. If I were you I''d take a look at how each is drawn and
    decide which one you think looks better... I think that is what is REALLY important.'

    work together really well. But now that I think about it I don\u2019t know if
    the digital revivals would work together in the same way because so many have
    been tweaked to work as families on their own. I\u2019ll suggest to Paul Shaw
    that we comp them together in his next book."
