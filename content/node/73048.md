  \r\n\r\nIm really hoping you experts can help me, im trying to identify these 4
  serif faces, unfortunately the type sizes are small and these images are the best
  i could do.\r\n\r\nI know certain details are very difficult to make out (especially
  \u2018c\u2019 but im hoping someone will recognize the overall shapes and be able
  to help me out.\r\n\r\nOn the second image, on the second line, at the very right
  of the picture is the number 2, its quite distinct and may help identifying.\r\n\r\nThanks
  so much,\r\n\r\nL[img:sites/default/files/old-images/a_3502.jpg][img:sites/default/files/old-images/b_6478.jpg][img:sites/default/files/old-images/c_3637.jpg][img:sites/default/files/old-images/d_6004.jpg]"

    reveal something.\r\n\r\nEDIT: Pretty sure #1 isn't a Garamond, not one I'm familiar
    with at least...the x is too calligraphic."

  body: "Thanks NJ and Publishing Mojo,\r\n\r\nYour right NJ the first is not Garamond
    and Moderno is definitely the closest yet for the last one though I dont think
    its as condensed as Moderno but your putting me on the right track.\r\n\r\nAnd
    Publishing Mojo, I was looking at bookman earlier, they are quite similar but
    bookman seems slightly wider than the example I have. Look at the \u2018U\u2019,
    Ill look for different versions.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately I dont have the covers of
    the books. I took these photos a good while back of fonts I really liked and im
    trying to identify them now, these seem to be the most difficult, most hazy too.\r\n\r\nReally
    appreciate the help"

  body: "Not a problem. That italic J in #3 is really scratching at my brain...I'm
    sure it's something I've seen before, but unfortunately there's no way of browsing
    just the italic variants on MyFonts or any of the other major vendors. It could
    be a swash, but I just don't buy that someone typesetting captions for photos
    would apply a swash to the word \"July\" and not any of the others.\r\n\r\nI've
    also been looking at variants of Century Schoolbook and Expanded for #2, but the
    \"y\" in your sample drops like a Garamond, as opposed to the curly terminal in
    Schoolbook."

  body: "I'm wondering if it's the blurriness of the image that's making the \"Kolobrzeg,
    July\" line in #3 look bold when it's actually a medium weight. In which case,
    I'm almost certain that it's Adobe's Plantin.\r\n\r\nhttp://new.myfonts.com/fonts/adobe/plantin/\r\n\r\nWhat
    do you think?\r\n\r\nEDIT: It's not Plantin. The numerals are all wrong."

    Style</a>, and im pretty certain they match, so I think thats one down and 3 to
    go,\r\n\r\nThanks so much,\r\n\r\nL\r\n\r\n"
