    <BR> <BR>-- <BR> <BR>To me, something is useful to the extent that it will probably
    be used. Smallcaps are rarely used. Even by people who know they&#39;re there,
    even in huge, expensive environmental signage projects, like the lettering aroung
    the fountain in Pasadena&#39;s &#34;Paseo Colorado&#34; mall. I mean, how much
    does it cost to make that decision, compared to just the damn water pump? But
    they don&#39;t use them, and that&#39;s that. Type design is one thing, typographic
    evangelism is another - attempt both at your own risk. <BR> <BR>So I&#39;d rather
    see a designer spend his time on a new design. But if you must make smallcaps,
    at least please don&#39;t just thrown them in with the basic font - that&#39;s
    just wasteful. <BR> <BR>hhp

  body: First, I think they are useful. If someone is getting creative with a bibliography,
    for instance, and is setting the title of the book in italic smallcaps. Second,
    if the typeface has italics and it has smallcaps .. how much more difficult is
    it to give the user italic smallcaps?

    pissy to see good decisions not taken even when they&#39;re free. <BR> <BR>&#62;
    how much more difficult is it to give the user italic smallcaps? <BR> <BR>That&#39;s
    a good point. Assuming you think italic caps are fine when they&#39;re simply
    [mostly] sloped - which I don&#39;t... Anyway, I was talking about smallcaps in
    general. And I wasn&#39;t saying they&#39;re never ever useful to anybody - just
    that it&#39;s tough to justify making them to some extent. Why not work on a different
    optical size instead? To me a lot of things make more sense than making smallcaps.
    Just not unicase, PLEEEEZE!  :-/ Now <i>that&#39;s</i> a nerve... <BR> <BR>hhp

  body: I recall seeing some nice title pages done which included small cap italics.  As
    long as the italic capitals are not too flourished, smallcap italics make sense.  True,
    most users won&#39;t use them but those users are not the ones who buy lots of
    fonts &#40;they stick with the free fonts that come with other software&#41;.  People
    with a great interest in typography do though and they are more likely to want
    smallcaps.  This then becomes a selling feature. <BR> <BR>ChrisL

    not. I use roman smallcaps a lot, so its not as if I wouldn&#39;t use the italics
    if I could think of a use for them. It should also be noted that italic all-caps
    are rare and generally frowned upon by typographic tradition, which explains why
    smallcap counterparts are as rare or rarer. <BR> <BR>The new MS ClearType fonts
    all contain smallcaps for all four styles &#40;regular, bold, italic, bold italic&#41;,
    but MS have, um, special users, who complain if one style of a font doesn&#39;t
    behave in Powerpoint exactly the same way as the other styles.'

  body: Chris, I would say that the <i>availability</i> of smallcaps is a selling
    point. But bundling a niche thing with a mainstream thing and selling them at
    one low price &#40;because you couldn&#39;t sell enough of them at a high price&#41;
    is just bad business. Whatever price you sell the main font at, you should sell
    an extra that people who care would buy for about the same amount, without having
    to raise the price of something with an extra that most people will never use.
    It&#39;s just sensitive tiering. <BR> <BR>&#62; italic all-caps are rare and generally
    frowned upon <BR> <BR>Doesn&#39;t that apply only to swashy ones? <BR> <BR>hhp

  body: <i>Doesn&#39;t that apply only to swashy ones? </i> <BR> <BR>Especially to
    swashy ones. Italic all-caps start showing up fairly commonly in title-pages in
    the 18th century, but seldom in any other context. I think typographers should
    generally ask themselves, when considering setting something in all-caps italics,
    whether there is any reason not to use roman all-caps instead. One can imagine,
    for instance, a title in all-caps that includes a non-naturalised foreign word;
    this might be a good reason to use all-cap italics. On the whole, though, I don&#39;t
    think there are many good reasons.

  body: John, I think we did use italic small caps &#40;or did we fake them?&#41;
    in <i>Language Culture Type</i>. In that job roman s.c. were used for the acronyms,
    like ATF, ITC, GSUB, AAT, ASCII, &amp;c., so in the titles with acronyms we used
    italic s.c. For example, <i>Typographica USSR</i>, <i>Calligraphia USA/USSR</i>
    &#40;p. 45&#41;. And what about that edition of Gurdjieff&#39;s <i>Beelzebub&#39;s
    Tales</i>, remember? Have any italic s.c. been used there?

    <BR>Well, having designing some of them, Italic SC are pain to do, specially for
    Serif typefaces. Specially because when you done the SC roman, with some systematic
    approche, suddenly it became more difficult to apply the same for the Italic.
    <BR> <BR>At level user, I use quite a lot SC italic, but as I use only my fonts
    in most of the cases... so bad example as John can be I suppose? ;&#41;'

  body: On a magazine I used to work on, the house style was to have a section of
    copy start with a drop cap and the first few words set in small caps. Once in
    a while, some of those words needed to be italicized. As I recall, the face we
    used didn&#39;t have italic small caps so we reluctantly had to fake it.  <BR>
    <BR>I think they can be handy to have around sometimes, even though they go against
    tradition. I have begun to include italic &#40;and bold!&#41; small caps when
    I include roman ones in my fonts &#40;one family so far&#41;.

    of text that included an acronym or something else that textually required capitals
    letters, I would go to considerable lengths to avoid having to set it in italics.
    There are all sorts of text treatments -- if one needed to set the text apart
    in some way -- that I would try before putting myself in the position you describe.
    I really dislike all-cap italics.
