  [[http://www.jocksnitch.com/images/big/JNI2243.jpg|this]] is quite atrocious. While
  I do think that Trajan is a well crafted typeface, It is completely wrong for KU
  basketball jerseys or any sports jersey for that matter. As a KU alumni, it\u2019s
  just sad to see this happen.\r\n\r\nsee also: [[http://www2.kusports.com/news/2007/jul/19/uniforms_tweaked_again/]]"

    those jerseys.

  body: Interesting. Of course that need not have happened if Trajan had proper contextual
    altrenates. But on an arc... the design firm should have hired a lettering artist.
    Or a stone carver. I feel certain that Douglas Coffin for instance would have
    run the serifs of the K into the serifs of the A.

    designers might be convinced to stop using it.

  body: "Funny to find this thread, desperately seeking font-pairing advice for Trajan,
    for a KU academic poster. Sticking with a cohesive feeling with the new logo,
    I'm using Trajan for the title and subtitles now I just need to figure out what
    font to use for the copy.\r\nAny advice is welcome.\r\n\r\nMy $.02 is that the
    entire logo redesign, while not a complete design failure, is a perfect example
    of how bureaucracy can muddle up anything. Spend too much on an unnecessary redesign
    that you can't afford to change all of the media. It was probably someone at KU
    who just saw Troy, and said \"Wow! I want our logo to look that cool!\" and just
    kept insisting on it.\r\n__________________________\r\nhttp://DesignerScott.com"

    heads with the old Kansas font'd be nice.;) But you can use any Garamond, Dutch,
    Caslon or old style, depending on budget, content, audience and the actual type
    specification, Trajan should also be an easy match for some sans, like Gil perhaps.\r\nCheers!"
