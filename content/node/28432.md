  body: "Yeah, it's one hell of a logo for sure :(\r\nI work for a printer, so sometimes
    we are given a low res jpeg and are expected to print it. Well then prepress calls
    the graphics department and I have to drop what I am doing and convert all of
    these bad files to press ready graphics.\r\n\r\nThanks for the advice!"
