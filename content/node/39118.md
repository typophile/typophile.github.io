  of the automated system I found on google, and also the ones where you go through
  a list of 20 some odd questions, but those didnt work very well.\r\n\r\nHopefully
  the trained eyes of some of the experts on here will have more luck.\r\n\r\nI have
  attached the image below.\r\n\r\nThanks for the help!"
