body: "Hey all... I've been a lurker for some time on the board and this is the first
  time I'm posting something here for advice... I'm looking forward to your feedback.\r\n\r\nThe
  image attached is a pencil sketch of a stylized \"P\" for a logo that will say \"Path
  to Sustainability.\"  I am getting the \"P\" vectorized and fixed up and registered
  as a symbol, but I'm having a hard time finding a font for the rest of the letters
  (ath to Sustainability) of the logo (and for general \"branding use\")  I want the
  fonts to be clean, natural, organic, artistic.  I don't want them very structured
  or corporate.\r\n\r\nI love these fonts here: http://www.sudtipos.com -- would something
  like http://www.sudtipos.com/fonts/106 or http://www.sudtipos.com/fonts/14 be totally
  weird?\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/pathlogo_6176.jpg]\r\n\r\nLet
  me know! "

  body: "Hey! sorry to not respond with font suggestions for 'ath to sustainability'
    but I don't really get a 'P' from your symbol there.. it looks like a backwards
    S, a Z, or an R maybe. Once you get that a little closer to what you need, the
    typeface will flow pretty easily!\r\ngood luck!\r\n\r\n- Scott Sullivan\r\nwww.trifepdgm.com"

    represent a path.  I know it's not perfect, but it is a progress. \r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nJourney"

  body: "You really can't finish up the \"P\" (which isn't working yet anyway, and
    not just because swooshes are indeed to be avoided) without figuring out the rest
    at the same time. One thing you might try is representing a path (or rather, the
    impression of a path) between the whitespaces of all the letters in \"path\";
    for this to work the four letters would have to be distorted, but it might be
    possible to make the whole look tasteful nonetheless.\r\n\r\nThe thing is, before
    you even get to how it looks, I think you have to worry about the fact that \"Path
    to Sustainability\" is probably too long to look good as a logo...\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
