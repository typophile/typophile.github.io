  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>I’m designing a short publication of one of the work done in one of my classes this semester and thinking about having it wire bound. It probably won’t exceed 40 pages so I’m thinking that a perfect binding will just fall apart, and I want it to lay flat so I can talk about it in interviews without having to hold it down. So I want to have it spiral bound.</p>
<p>My book-arts friends think I’m just some sort of lazy monster, and are trying to convince me to do some wacky stitched binding or some other crazy thing, and say spiral bindings look cheap. Do designers really look down on spiral bindings, or are my friends just being snotty because they want to see everything hand bound from five kinds of paper with printed vellum tip-ins?</p>

40 pages is no problem either way for saddle stitch or spiral but would be too thin for perfect binding.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Every binding system has its advantages and disadvantages.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Perfect-binding requires a minimum thickness to be effective. I doubt your 40 pages, even if printed on cardstock, will be thick enough. (And if printed on cardstock will probably tear the binding apart.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Coil or Spiral bindings look nice and come in many colors and sizes. But, because of the nature of the spiral, opposing pages of spreads do not align. One side of the spread will always be lower than the other side. Only a problem if you&rsquo;ve got crossovers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Wire-O bindings are slightly more complex than Spiral (looks somewhat like a wire version of Cerlox), but allow opposing pages of spreads to align. Also comes in many sizes and colors. As Chris mentioned, Coil and Wire-O bindings do not add structural strength to a book, so they tend to be floppy. Using a heavy card back cover to add strength is common.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Saddle-stitching could work, depending on your page size. If doing the stitching yourself, you&rsquo;ll need a stapler that can accommodate the width of your printed page.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Rivets &amp; grommets also come in a variety of colors and sizes. Two options available: a single rivet will make a fanbook (think Pantone swatchbook); a couple rivets in line will seal one side of the book but this uses a lot of space. Anywhere from a half-inch to an inch of each page of your book will become inaccessible to the reader (this is easy enough to design around by adding additional space to each inside margin).</p>

<p>James, I don&rsquo;t think I properly addressed your question in my long-winded previous post.</p>
<p>Speaking only for myself, I do tend to view Spiral and Wire-O bindings as aesthetically inferior. So I guess I&rsquo;m like your art-friends. I&rsquo;ve also recommended and used both Spiral and Wire-O systems in different projects. I see them as gimmicky. I also see &ldquo;novelty&rdquo; typefaces as gimmicky. But I&rsquo;ll still use them, if they are right for the project.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Speaking from a user&rsquo;s point of view rather than a designer&rsquo;s point of view, why oppose a far more practical solution because of aesthetical preferences?</p>
<p>Spiral bindings are probably underappreciated because the coil binding spines are made of plastic instead of traditional materials like leather or paper. The association with cheap spiral-bound notebooks doesn&rsquo;t help either. The difficulty of utilizing the spines for displaying the title of the publication, making identification difficult when shelved, must be another reason it is not used for more expensive projects&ndash;they would be harder to display in bookstores and the like.</p>
<p>I think that&rsquo;s a shame because there are lots of situations where one needs a lie-flat binding, and spiral bindings are hard to beat there. Not only do they lie flat, you get 360-degree rotation at any position in the book. From my own experiences, dense mathematical texts can often benefit from being spiral-bound as one often has to have them open at a single page and take several minutes studying the material on that page, all the while taking notes or solving problems using the page as a reference.</p>
<p>Using hard covers takes care of the slouching when placed on bookshelves should it become a problem. If the book is really thick, the pages will follow the curve of the coils when closed rather than line up neatly, but that won&rsquo;t be a problem with 40 pages.</p>

(i&rsquo;ve actually done this at least twice, it&rsquo;s pretty easy.)</p>
<p>one other thing you could investigate to mitigate the aesthetic unpleasantness of a wire binding is some kind of slip cover. you still get nice lay-flat functionality, but it looks better closed, and more &ldquo;professional&rdquo; to boot. (imho)</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s a thought: In a town the size of Washington D.C., there has to be a number of people who teach classes in hand binding. Even in Durham, North Carolina, there are a couple. My wife took a couple of these courses, and most of the projects involved binding books of less than 40 pages. Anyway, for a fee, one of the teachers would probably bind your project for you, with nice covers.</p>
<p>On a more general note, if you don&rsquo;t mind the art-book people looking down on you for a bit, your schoolwork gets you your first job. You get your second job based on what you achieved in your first job &ndash; You won&rsquo;t be showing your schoolwork during your interviews for the second job. For the second &amp; subsequent jobs, even the school itself is less important than what you&rsquo;ve achieved at work. I&rsquo;d hire a good, productive person who had gone to the local community college over a RISD grad whose professional work wasn&rsquo;t quite as good.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>It&rsquo;s like using Helvetica &hellip; can be smart &hellip;. or cheap. Depends on how you use it. IMO there are are a lot of spiral bindings looking ugly. I hate the plastic bindings but I like the metal spiral binding. A very simple method to make it look less ugly in the eyes of your &ldquo;book-arts-friends&rdquo; is to make a hidden spiral binding. You add as last &ldquo;sheet&rdquo; to bind no &ldquo;sheet of paper&rdquo; but a simple cardboard with the width of approx. 4 times the width of your papersize plus the width of the spine (??correct term??). The cardboard is four times ??channeled/scored??. After binding you can fold the cover.</p>

It&rsquo;s probably just personal taste, as Ken suggests, but I feel that wire-o is a bit classier-looking than coil binding&hellip; Coil binding tends to be thick and colorful, while wire-o is usually thin and black. And as others have already said, with wire-o your pages will align. And coil binding tends to come undone more easily, in my experience.</p>
<p>[EDIT] Oh, and I agree with Nora&hellip; It depends on how you use it. What I said about coil binding applies to the plastic variety, not the metal kind shown in Nora&rsquo;s photos!</p>

James,
I won&rsquo;t go into how tough it was in the Rubilith days. You have to remember that there were still 24 hours in a day then as there are now. We worked about 16 hours a day as students then, slept about 5 hours and ate, drank, and partied the rest. I don&rsquo;t imagine things have changed that much for you young guys today. The difference was we were bent over a drawing table instead of working at a computer.</p>

Then we had to dig in the mines 24 hours a day just to get enough Rubylith to carry back so we could sit, hunched over, at a drawing table for 24 hours a day.</p>
<p>But, seriously, James, I&rsquo;m glad you&rsquo;re happy with your solution. Can you post a photo?</p>

<p>You had a drawing table?  Hah!  We had to make our own drawing tables by finding slate slabs and splitting them to get a flat surface, and then getting two real horses to stand still with one end of the slab on each back to get a surface to draw on.  ;-)</p>
<p>While I was apprenticing a couple of weeks ago, I learned a very simple sewn binding that would have taken you an hour or so &ndash; easier and considerably cheaper than wire-o&hellip;.   (Can&rsquo;t find instructions or a tutorial for it on the web, though!)</p>
