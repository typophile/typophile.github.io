body: This client has typed about 20 different documents with this font, but does
  not have the technical ability to tell me what the heck it is!!! Not that's I'd
  mind hand drawing each character and charging her for it, but the 1800.00 art charge
  might scare her away....it's most likely something that's in a basic font package,
  but I have no idea which one or where to even start other than the eagle-eyed folks
  here...:-)
