  Spectrum by Jan van Krimpen. I've only seen Haarlemmer on print and I think it looks
  great. But since I only have Spectrum in my font library, I wonder if it's worth
  buying Haarlemmer or if Spectrum will do the same good. The task intended is a corporate
  identity (for an organic bakery/caf\xE9/grocery-store) where quotes will be the
  main identity element. And what could be a good accompanying sans serif?\r\n\r\nI'm
  also considering Scala and Scala Sans, which perhaps have a more contemporary feel
  to them. The problem with this family is that they're som much used (especially
  in Norway). But, then again, the public probably won't be able to tell which font
  it is.\r\n\r\nOther fonts vaguely considered: Hoefler Text/Gotham, Seria/Seria Sans,
  Dante, Stempel Garamond.\r\n\r\nMany thanks!\r\n\r\nFredrik"

  body: "Haarlemmer is a better digitization, and is much \"sturdier\" at text sizes
    than Spectrum. DTL has Haarlemmer Sans as well. \r\n\r\nIf you're looking at Seria,
    I'd also look at <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=verity.search&font_categories_search=font_name_search&searchstr=Nexus&image.x=0&image.y=0\">Nexus.</a>
    \r\n\r\nIn general, it's more of a \"workhorse\" than Seria. It's available in
    OpenType, has a extremely wide range of styles, including a sans, a \"mix\", and
    \"typewriter\" style. \r\n\r\nBUT...\r\nSince it's an \"<em>organic</em> bakery/caf\xE9/grocery-store\",
    you might want something a bit more organic, so I'd suggest looking at OurType's
    new \"Eva.\" It's a humanist sans. No serif version, but I don't think it needs
    one. \r\n\r\nAND..\r\nWhile you're at the OurType site (www.ourtype.be), you should
    also have a look at Fresco: very nice!"

    body: "Thank you very much! Of the two, I find Fresco most interesting, and very
      interesting indeed. It has both serif and sans. The serif reminds me a little
      of Underware's Dolly. Perhaps that is a good way to go, as opposed to the more
      'stringent' ones\u2026\r\n\r\nFredrik"

    body: 'You can''t beat Haarlemmer, the finest serif workhorse since Stone Serif.
      OurType''s Eva is a little too funky to go with it, however; I would suggest
      Linotype Syntax with old style figures, whose book weight is just right (whereas
      Stone Sans book weight, for instance, is a shade too heavy). For the sans, stay
      with Syntax-derived faces, not Gill-Sans-derived faces. Come to think of it,
      Stone Serif and Stone Sans are worth a careful look for your purposes: I''ve
      been using them heavily for years, and I couldn''t be happier. Just don''t forget
      to use the old style figures for both serif and sans--makes all the difference.'

    body: As I mentioned for G-E on another thread, I've been using Stone and Stone
      Sans for 15 years in all sorts of jobs as well as my own stationery, and it
      works beautifully in every conceivable environment, from 9 pt newsletter text
      to big display effects, especially with its marvelous italics...it is a strong
      workhorse, not a funky or specialty or period face...the fact that it has not
      been "discovered" is fine with me, and I can certainly recommend both serif
      and sans families...

  body: "I\xB4ve read two books (released in the late 90s, early 2000) in german language
    about design/typography topics set in ITC Stone (Serif, Sans). I found the Serif
    a good, flowing read (copytext set in ca. 9pt). Solid (the italics, too), but
    not very good looking - maybe it was trendy/common at that time to use Stone instead
    of Minion, Sabon, etc.?\r\nApart from the Serif \u2013 what i really don't like
    is Stone Sans Bold, no\u2026 \r\n\r\nMaybe it would be interesting to have an
    own thread about the ITC Stone family. But i'm not able to start this one - Stone
    is still around and there are \"haters and lovers\"... "

  body: "I see,\r\n\r\nI'll start looking for some books that are set in Stone (no
    pun intended) and read it myself.\r\n\r\nRegardless, there is no doubt that if
    a contemporary font family had managed to be used succesfully (and without change
    in its inherent design, if I remember correctly) for 15 years, it has achieved
    its objective."

    body: "Keep in mind we're talking about the rough and tumble of corporate use,
      where a text face in 9 pt must snap, read, and compete well against much activity
      and clutter. Other faces I admire more than Stone--Sabon, Janson, Scala, Celeste--would
      not work at all in this setting, either too delicate or too fussy (or, re Sabon,
      lacking a well-contrasted bold). If Stone serif regular seems a tad *too* work-horsey,
      then Haarlemmer looks like a very adaptible alternative.\r\n\r\nFor corporate
      use, the line dividing the men from the boys is the line between 9 and 10 point.
      That line makes a fascinating life-long study for type lovers. Many beautiful
      faces start working only at 10 pt, but that's not good enough for most corporate
      work. Stone Serif starts working at 7 pt and, with three well-sculpted weights,
      perfect oldstyle figures, and lovely natural-feeling italics, it never stops
      working all the way up."
