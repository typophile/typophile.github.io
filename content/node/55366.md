  two weights of the same typeface.\r\nA bolder version for \"Principle Islands of
  Hawaii,\" and a lighter\r\nversion for the \"albers equal area projection\" part.
  \r\n\r\nI was born in Hawaii, am an environmentalist, and feel extremely close to
  nature.\r\nSo, I want my business card to be a map. But I'ld like to add my information\r\nof
  course. \r\n\r\nAny thoughts on what this is, or approximations of what could be
  used?\r\n\r\nthankyou"
