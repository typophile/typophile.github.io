body: I&#39;m currently working on designing for a safety product at school, and one
  of the challenges we have is to make sure the instruction text on the product is
  as legible as possible. <BR>So i&#39;ve set out to find a typeface that was designed
  with super legibility in mind, or typefaces that have excelled in legibility testing...
  <BR>google searches and casual asking around school have gotten me nowhere, so i
  was wondering if you guys could offer some pointers? <BR> <BR>thanks... <BR>Svenni
