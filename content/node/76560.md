    September 18, 2007\r\n\r\nMr. Zvi Narkiss\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/ZviNarkis_n_6509.jpg]\r\n\r\nThe
    Designer Zvi Narkis is awarded the EMET Prize for his creativity in the design
    of the Hebrew font, for the design of typefaces for the Hebrew alphabet over a
    period of fifty years, which made possible the transition from traditional Hebrew
    fonts to modern types, and for ingeniously combining ancient traditions with modern
    design concepts in creating the Hebrew type.\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\nZvi Narkis was born
    in Rumania in 1921. He immigrated to Palestine in 1944 and settled in Jerusalem,
    where he attended painting classes with Jakob Steinhardt and Mordechai Ardon.
    He went on to study graphic design at The New Bezalel Academy of Arts and Design.
    His evident skills allowed him to skip the first academic year, and a year later
    he was invited to work at the graphics department of the Keren Kayemet LeIsrael
    (the Jewish National Fund). Between 1950 and 1955 he was chief graphic designer
    of the IDF's training aids unit, and served as head of the manuals' design unit
    of the Israeli Air Force.\r\n\r\nIn 1955 he opened his own graphic design and
    typography studio, where for fifty years now he has been designing books, exhibitions,
    stamps, banknotes, coins, posters and emblems. Among his many projects he designed
    two Bible books for which he created a special typeface \u2013 the Horev Bible
    and the Hebrew University Bible \u2013 Jerusalem Crown. He designed the State
    of Israel's first tourist poster, the IDF pavilion at the First Decade Exhibition
    (1958), the Victory Medal (1967), the Peace Medal (1977) and some notes for the
    Bank of Israel.\r\n\r\nHe specialized in the design of types (fonts), and became
    the most prolific designer of Hebrew types in the 20th Century. He created Hebrew's
    most popular sans-serif book type, and over the years he designed fourteen sets
    of typefaces. The book types he created, bearing his name \u2013 Narkis, are most
    popular and are now commonly used in Israel. He created five of the ten most frequently
    used typefaces in Israel.\r\n\r\nHe also served as an academic advisor to the
    graphic design course at the Technion and as president of the Association of Israeli
    Designers.\r\n\r\nHis works were displayed in many publications in Israel and
    worldwide."
