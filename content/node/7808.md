  body: 'Yes, and it&#39;s all the fault of new technology driving up volume and driving
    down prices: first for printing, then later for typesetting. <BR> <BR>Of course,
    the first &#34;new technology&#34; I am thinking of is the introduction of the
    steam-powered printing press, which took over around 1830-1860. Then it was automated
    typesetting with the Linotype and Monotype typecasters at the turn of the &#40;19th
    to 20th&#41; century. And so on. <BR> <BR>It&#39;s quite funny to read old books
    and magazines, and see exactly the same kind of bemoaning of the decline of typography.
    <BR> <BR>Of course, there is an element of truth to all this, but the point is
    that it&#39;s been a problem for over 150 years. <BR> <BR>I actually believe that
    new tools and processes for automating higher-end typography are resulting in
    an increase in typographic quality right now. In the past this has happened as
    each technology has matured, and right now it seems to be happening with digital
    typesetting &#40;at least at the high end&#41;. <BR> <BR>Regards, <BR> <BR>T'

  body: '<i>&#62;&#39;evident erosion of typographic awareness knowledge and control&#39;
    &#40;John Macmillan, baseline issue 43&#41;. </i> <BR> <BR>Yes, there certainly
    is an erosion of typographic knowledge and quality. But before the changes that
    Thomas mentioned, almost everything printed was created by a relatively small,
    closed group of people. Now, more people make things, and they also make MORE
    things. But still, there are many people who do manage to make wonderful things,
    with good awareness. <BR> <BR>Another interesting point with technology: when
    technology first comes on the scene, it decreases the level of overall quality.
    But then, technologies have always improved, and have begun to care more about
    things like typography.&#42; Think about the first typesetting machines from the
    1880s. Dreadful. But by the 1930s, English Monotype was making fabulous typefaces
    and very fine typography.  <BR> <BR>Much of the first digital typesetting was
    wretched, in part because of the low-resolution bitmap type. But then came PostScript,
    and desktop publishing software. Granted, every granny can make a bad flyer now,
    but you and I can also use InDesign to set well designed books ourselves. <BR>
    <BR><i>&#62;Do you agree that this is a worrying issue for the future of typography
    in the hands of new graduates?</i> <BR> <BR>No, I don&#39;t worry about the fate
    of typography at all! I see opportunity, and a challenge for me and all other
    young designers. <BR> <BR> <BR>&#42; OK, this might not be true in the case of
    Photo-typesetting'

  body: Hi Danielle -- greetings from the other coast &#40;Glasgow&#41;. <BR> <BR>I
    think everybody would agree that the speed at which design technology has moved
    over the past 25 years or so has caused some problems. The entire design industry
    has changed, from top to bottom -- there is not really any such thing as a type-specifier
    or compositor in the mainstream of the industry anymore. These very specialised
    jobs are now left to the &#40;probably -- like myself -- untrained&#41; graphic
    designer, at best, or at worst the company secretary. Likewise the designer is
    generally expected to know a fair bit about prepress &#40;find me a printer that
    will give you an honest answer about densities and dot gain and I&#39;ll move
    to your city&#41;. So, yes, a skill base has disappeared, and print/type production
    is going through an era of transition. <BR> <BR>However, I wholeheartedly agree
    with Thomas, from the simple point of view that a new &#40;digital&#41; font from
    a respectable foundry today tends to be in many ways &#39;better&#39; than what
    you could expect ten or fifteen years ago. &#39;Better&#39; in the sense that
    more designers these days seem to want to create useful pieces of &#39;type engineering&#39;
    which innovate whilst paying attention to the history of the craft &#40;as opposed
    to all the spacey crap that came out in the 80s and 90s as people went crazy with
    the new technology&#41;. <BR> <BR>Viz. <a href="http://www.fontbureau.com" target="_blank">Fontbureau</a>

    target="_blank">Legato</a> ...  <BR> <BR>Plus, as Thomas hints, we have tools
    like InDesign which actively encourage excellent use of type &#40;whereas Quark,
    e.g., seems to have always gone out of its way to make typesetting even more abstruse&#41;.
    <BR> <BR>I also think that the fact that we&#39;re here talking about this is
    evidence of A Good Thing happening. I&#39;d guess that most of the people who
    read and post to this list are in fact not type designers but enthusiastic <i>graphic</i>
    designers who actually care about how they use type and about what type they use.
    This isn&#39;t new, but owing to the Internet it&#39;s becoming much more widespread.
    There isn&#39;t really an excuse now for a self-respecting designer to not know
    what they&#39;re doing vis a vis type. <BR> <BR>The crux of this is going to be
    whether there are people in schools like DoJ who can and will teach good typographic
    practice to their students. I&#39;d be interested to know what your experience
    is in this respect, Danielle. <BR> <BR>R

  body: 'Hi Robert, thanks for your feedback.  <BR> <BR>re. your inquiry as to &#39;whether
    there are people in schools like DoJ who can and will teach good typographic practice
    to their students&#39; then that&#39;s a definite yes. Two of our tutors: David
    Herbert and Gary Gowens, are assessors on the board of ISTD and take part in the
    yearly student assessments. In the classroom they place strong importance on rigorous
    typographic control, setting us projects that concentrate entirely on these skills.  <BR>
    <BR>Where Gary is a great advocate of Why Not Associates, Dave is very much a
    stickler for the old school; Muller-Brockman et al. The grid is very important
    to them however they do allow room for those students who seek to break the grid
    in an informed way.  <BR> <BR>Talking to Dave on the same topic as this thread,
    he commented on the low pass rate of ISTD in recent years with &#39;approximately
    70% of entries failing to meet the benchmark standards set by the society&#39;.
    &#40;He went on to stress that Duncan of Jordanstone achieved an 80% pass rate&#41;
    He seemed to feel students are not evidencing enough typographic control or respect
    for &#39;the history and foundations of the subject&#39;.  <BR> <BR>My friend
    doing Graphics at Glasgow school of art  never seems to have any tuition in these
    areas, this shows up the imbalance of the priorities in design education today.
    <BR> <BR>PS. Amy Conger, you will be pleased to know that I do not know a single
    graphic design student who would ever use Comic Sans! As for the rest of the country,
    well you cant have everything. &#40;I have recently managed to wrestle the designing
    of the music society concert posters out of the hands of those determined to use
    bad clip art and Comic sans set in rainbow colours!&#41; <BR> <BR>Danielle'

    aware a little of the graphic design department here in Glasgow and there really
    doesn&#39;t seem to be much rigour in their teaching of typographical matters.
    This pretty much squares with most of what I know about Glasgow vs DoJ: DoJ seems
    to put a lot of emphasis on good tuition and facilities, Glasgow relies on having
    a nice building and being in a cool city. <BR> <BR>Incidentally, I&#39;m a graduate

  body: The world is awash in Comic Sans because it is on just about every computer,
    not because inexperienced designers love it. In short, everyone who isn&#39;t
    a &#34;designer&#34; seems to use it. <BR> <BR>I think that once a community says
    &#34;no, don&#39;t use that, it is bad&#34; that such attitudes become dogma,
    and design dogma is usually bad. I personally don&#39;t like Comic Sans, and think
    that it is so abused, but I think that it would be kind of cool, as a &#34;real
    designer&#34; to tackle a poster design where the brief set out clearly that I
    could only use Comic Sans and Clip Art <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"

    2004 pg 61 entitled &#39;Why do you hate me&#39;!&#41; most of the posters abstracted

    how most designers hate it and yet so many &#39;non-designers&#39; seem to love
    it. just chatting to my flat mate for example who says she thinks it great and
    uses it all the time. CR comments on its usual use for &#39;the office xmas party
    invite&#39; Thats a wierd paradox as its the public who we&#39;re designing for
    at the end of the day. hmm...

  body: I saw a souvenir shop in Vienna whose sign was set in Souvenir. Has anyone
    ever seen a comic book set in Comic Sans? <BR> <BR>I bet that there are clients
    out there who demand that thier designers use comic sans. I once remade the CI
    of a law firm. Their old logo was Arial, all caps. I tried for weeks, with three
    separate presenations to get them to decide upon another typeface. My third-and
    final-proposal even showed how they&#39;d be better of if they would at least
    consider switching to Helvetica. <BR> <BR>They kept Arial. At least I was able
    to make it upper and lowercase. This was then followed by my designing the most
    boring letterhead I have ever made. <BR> <BR>This could happen to you too! But
    it could be Comic Sans, instead of Arial. <BR> <BR>Another time, I was working
    at a summer camp &#40;one time, at band camp...&#41;. This was before I started
    studying graphic design. I was on the team of counselors responsible for working
    with the campers to create their camp year book &#40;100 pages, double sided,
    black and white xerox&#41;. We had some Pentium 3s running MS Office and <i>Photoshop.</i>
    I laid out the entire thing using PowerPoint and Comic Sans &#40;I was young and
    stupid and needed the money, please don&#39;t hate me <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/sad.gif"
