    been a font but I have to admit, with such flawless connections, it could be hand-drawn.
    Alternatives: [[http://www.myfonts.com/search/freestyle+script|Freestyle Script]],
    [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/santa-fe|Santa Fe]] (possibly the closest
    even if needed a lot of work), [[http://www.myfonts.com/search/kaufmann|Kaufmann]]'

    body: Awesome. And yes, I was also suspecting it may be hand-drawn. Thank you
