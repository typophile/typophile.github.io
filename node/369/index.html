		<div class="commentbody">Gerald <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I've read the discussion at your site with interest. One point of confusion about ink spread is that it is largely a twentieth century phenomenon. By this I mean it was rarely a concern before the revival period. Good printing was just good printing and poor printing was just poor printing. Moxon called heavy inking, &quot;fat.&quot; To reinforce your point about the aims of the punchcutter a blast from the past: Fournier suggested &quot;it is not right to blame the letter for the fault of the ink.&quot; <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->One of the problems in the ongoing current discussion is the thinking that early punchcutters must have worked with master drawings. There is no evidence of this to my knowledge. As foundries began to copy the work of other foundries, perhaps, but prior to the mid-eighteenth century I'd agree with your accessment about the intuitive organic quality of the work. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Another problem is that folks ignore the technology associated with the early revivals, that of the photograph. Prior to Wm Morris replications were direct from specimens, cut by hand. Morris was the first to use the photograph, and what he saw was ink-spread (unfortunately, he kind of liked it). All subsequent revivals using the photograph had to deal with the same problem. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->But you mention Poliphilus. Later information on this is that it is not an exact replication with bumps and all but a &quot;flavored&quot; interpretation. Morison, once again, was lying. Beatrice Warde corrects this misconception in an article in the 1950s. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --></div>

		<div class="commentbody">Hermann Zapf recalls that the drawings he prepared for designs cut by hand August Rosenberger were generally much rougher than needed for machine cutting. He could rely on Rosenberger to accurately interpret his designs in metal. Industrial production required discreet design and manufacturing stages: division of labour. I believe the process of cutting type by hand was more holistic as is, in a very different way, the designing of digital type directly on the computer rather than on paper first.</div>

[Incidentally, I am just finishing reading a book in digital Electra - a pale and pathetic look compared to the book I have printed from metal Electra, which is beautiful.]  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Something besides letterpress vs digital is going on. I looked in my old type books and found that the Einstein book in metal Caslon that I like [above] is Mergenthaler Linotype Caslon Old Face. &quot;Types of Typefaces&quot; by my late Uncle J. Ben Lieberman has Mononotype's metal Caslon 337 in a text block set 10/11. It is lighter than the Linotype Caslon, and to me a little too light (as John Hudson said of the Langston digital, to Giampa's protestation). 337 does have a lot of the Caslon magic, though. Ludlow True-Cut Caslon, which &quot;Types of Typefaces&quot; shows a larger size partial alphabet of, has even more.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I am convinced that a lot of the magic has to do with deliberate 'irregularity' that the remakes iron out.
