    retailed font, as is is sold by Adobe in their font folio. I would check that
    first. There probably are several rounded fonts that do provide italic as well.\r\n\r\ncheerio

  body: "Renko, your mention of Volkswagen made me look up VAG Rounded on Google...
    Until now, I had no idea that VW was <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VAG_Rounded\">the
    origin of this typeface</a>, and I'd always wondered what <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volkswagen_AG\">\"VAG\"
    stood for</a>!\r\n\r\nUntil now, I had always identified Futura with Volkswagen,
    because of Helmut Krone's famous ads for VW in the United States."
