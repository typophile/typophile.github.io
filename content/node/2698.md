    nice article on subway systems</a> for you. It says that Akzidenz Grotesk, &#34;precursor
    to Helvetica&#34; is the one you&#39;re looking for.

  body: Thanks Chris, <BR> <BR>Thats great, only I don&#39;t fancy Akzidenz or Helvetica.
    It&#39;s gotta have some soul because its for a Bar and I want to give it a New
    York feel. Any modern looking New York style fonts that come to mind. I&#39;ve
    never been...

  body: The Empire State Building and a lot of other parts of New York City were built
    when Art Deco was in vogue. Deco fonts are the most reliable way to say &#34;New
    York,&#34; but be careful they don&#39;t say &#34;diner&#34; instead or people
    might get confused about your bar.

  body: Hoefler Type&#39;s <a href="http://www.typography.com/catalog/gotham/index.html">Gotham</a>
    is a nice example of New York typography, but instead of being source-specific,
    it&#39;s more of a general vernacular look, taken from skyscrapers, office buildings
    and other urban architecture. It&#39;s got a decent range of weights as well,
    along with a condensed version. There&#39;s a <a href="http://www.typography.com/catalog/gothamcondensed/features.html">helpful
    article</a> on its origins, as well.

    more character than Akzidenz or Helvetica.  You can get it <a href="http://www.fontfont.com/shop/">here</a>.

    designed by another Carnegie Mellon Alum in reference to a post by a third Carnegie
    Mellon Alum.  Pah!

    CMU Alum while wearing a t-shirt designed by the other CMU Alum, who recommended
    the typeface designed by another CMU Alum, in reference to the post by the third
    CMU Alum. <BR> <BR>At which point, we&#39;ll all be pulled towards Pittsburgh
    by the sheer self-referential gravity.

    It&#39;s better than retro. He&#39;s a New Yorker.

  body: Ian look at one of the splash screens at Typophile, its of a stop at one of
    the subways. Its name is done in tiling and is very new york. Also depending on
    your bar graffiti art is a good alternative.

    some shots taken at the NY Transit museum of vintage NYC Subway signage. I will
    post them when I get a chance.  <BR> <BR>MTA keeps typophiles on their toes by
    mixing Akzidenz and Helvetica. My wife is getting good at telling the difference
    &#40;she is a patient with my neurosis&#41;. They also toss in Franklin Gothic

    to say that you will not be able to sum up the city with a single typeface, or
    visual style. The only way to proceed in branding your Bar is to be very specific.  <BR>
    <BR>5th Avenue, Subway, Neighborhood Bodega, Art Deco, Lower East Side, West Village,
    Chelsea, 14th Street, etc.
