		<div class="commentbody">Cool! <BR>I recently perused their book &#40;thanks to Jim Rimmer&#41; and it seems like a great place to be. <BR> <BR>Questions? I guess I have one - pretty specific too: <BR>If I want to do what Koch did in metal with Neuland &#40;ignoring for the sake of argument the vast difference in actual talent&#41; but in wood &#40;basically cutting forms &#34;blindly&#34;, without any drawing&#41; what do I need to know? What kind of wood should I use? I have some basswood in the garage. What about tools? And how smooth/clean does the surface have to be, like does it need to be treated in any way? Etc. <BR> <BR>BTW, that shower is too good. <BR> <BR>hhp</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Hrant <BR> <BR>As I mentioned, I have been toying with the idea of cutting some woodtype over the last year. Reading the Hatch Show Print book clinshed the decision for me. <BR> <BR>I am going to get a sample piece of 1/4&#34; birch and/or poplar plywood and try it on that. <BR> <BR>I have had some correspondence over the last ten years sor so with Christopher Manson of Rockville Maryland &#40;sold him some type for his bookwork&#41;. <BR>  <BR>He is in opinion, the premier woodcut &#40;not wood engraving&#41; artist today. His favorite subject is mediaevalsim, and he has done a great many wonderful, gutsy illustrations in that vein. <BR> <BR>He once mentioned to me that he uses the above mentioned types of wood, but I don&#39;t know if they are a special selection or straight from the lumber store. <BR> <BR>I am certain the wood needs very little if any preparation. Birch ply is a nice tight grain and very smooth. tiy should be able to print it without picking up any eyes from the grain. <BR> <BR>I am going to email you his phone number offline, becuase <BR>I couldn&#39;t find an email address for him in the many mentions of his work on the web. <BR> <BR>As far as tools, Chris could tell you what he uses. I have a large selection of wood chisels from which to draw, but I have picked them up randomly over the past forty years; some of them I have made. A fair set of tools can be bought from any Lee Valley store across Canada. Look for Woodcut knives in their catalog. <BR> <BR>My paln is to pantograph the letters straight up to the finished line, and then go in and hand cut the tight pinches etc. This is the way the Hamilton Wood Type folks did and still do it. <BR> <BR>If starting out without any kind of pantograph, I would recommend using a router, and staying about a 1/16&#34; away from the finished line. The rest you could finish with knives. I think you would find this a breeze. Just do some practice pieces sbefore gettiing serious.  <BR> <BR>Neuland is a great subject. In fact, Hamilton used to offer it for sale. <BR> <BR>Jim Rimmer</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Jim, thanks. <BR> <BR>BTW, I wouldn&#39;t actually try to recreate Neuland in wood. I have this idea about exploring the possibilities of negative space by cutting glyphs directly in wood, maybe just a lc &#34;e&#34; to start. Later on maybe Chinese - I&#39;ll be getting this great little book from UCLA on Saturday: it explains Chinese calligraphy by focusing on 214 characters. And I already have a name for what I&#39;ll be attempting: Yang-style.  :-&#41; <BR> <BR>hhp</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Since oil based inks, both litho and letterpress are very viscous, you won&#39;t experience and saoking of the ink into the wood to the degree that it will rob the printed image of richness. <BR> <BR>I&#39;ve done woodcuts on mahogany and oak, where I want the open grain to show, and on birch, maple pear, apple and rosewood, with no tearing going with or across the grain. It&#39;s is necessary to have good tools and they must be very sharp. These woods in either plank or ply will work for you, but get a sample and try it out before spending a bunch of money. <BR> <BR>Chris Manson does all his illustration work on birch and poplar plywood and has told me it works very well. He tells me that the majority of his cuts are knifework. Keeping v-cutters sharp takes a lot of care, which I have found in the illustration work I have done using birch. <BR> <BR>You are right: lino is easier to work, although I gave up on Speedball cutters a lot of years ago, because they are very soft steel, and don&#39;t hold an edge like good quality tools. In my area woods are cheaper than battleship lino, whether I buy it in a flooring store in bulk or at an art supply store in the largest sizes. <BR> <BR>I am currently working on the illsutrations for The Adventures of Tom Sawyer, a book I am printing at my workshop. I have been using standard hardbased flooring tile for the past ten years. It&#39;s one tenth the cost of lino, and cuts beautifully. The drawback is I am limited to the 12&#39;x12&#34; size. The book has 50 one-colour cuts and nine multi-coloured cut, with from seven to 12 colours, depending on the subject. The cost of lino would  kill me, but the floor tile is affordable and they are never out of stock. <BR> <BR>These are only my observations, so if you can find a better solution, I&#39;d look into it. <BR> <BR>Jim Rimmer</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Jim, <BR>Could you post a more detailed description of the &#34;hardbased flooring tile&#34; so I can see if I can find similar in the UK, is it wood or plastic approximation of lino, how thick is it? Although we don&#39;t have Speedball products here I know what you mean about their quality I have some old mushroom handled lino tools which keep their edge and are nicer to hold. <BR><a href="http://www.imcclains.com/catalog/blocks/engravingblocks.html#resingrave" target="_blank">http://www.imcclains.com/catalog/blocks/engravingblocks.html#resingrave</a> <BR>I have also seen this product while surfing around, do you or anyone else know about it? <BR>Tim</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Tim <BR> <BR>I will be taking a trip to the building supply store where I buy the flooring tile, and will find the name and if possible the type. <BR> <BR>For the moment, if they sell anything like it in the UK you can check it out by going to flooring supply place and just looking the tiles over. The stuff they sell here is 12&#34;x12&#34; abnd is about an eighth of an inch thick. They have thre or four colours: all very bland and ininteresting; off-white, pale grey, mid grey and black. It has a flecked pattern. If you try to bend the corner it will snap off, since the material is very brittle. If nobody&#39;s looking try a corner. <BR> <BR>The material is very hard and not atall spongy. It produces a very fine line and will not tear on thin lines like some of the lino I have bumped into here. By working carefully  aperson can produce an effect almost as fine as a wood engraving, although I don&#39;t aim at that look, because I like the boldness and looseness of a lino cut. <BR> <BR>Once the material is mounted to wood blocks it won&#39;t crack off in pieces, but when you are cutting it you can&#39;t flex the material. Another thing: if you forget to wash off the oil based ink and try to take it off when the ink is set with laquer thinner, the tile will start to break up and go sandy. I have learned to wash it off right away with type wash or paint thinner. With that kind of cleanup the tile material will last for many amany thousands of impression if necessary. It won&#39;t collapse on the press even with a lot of heavy impression, whereas with lino you have to take it easy. <BR> <BR>I&#39;ll try to get the name of the material. <BR> <BR>Jim</div>

People call them &#40;615-256-2805&#41; with a request and then &#42;fax&#42; the copy, which goes something like, <BR> <BR>Direct from... <BR>The Ryman Auditorium <BR>CLINT BLACK <BR>Thursday, January 13, 2005 <BR>8pm <BR>&#34;A Time for Hope&#34; <BR>A NAMI 25th Anniversary Event to benefit the National Association for the Mentally Ill <BR> <BR>Or, that was the copy for my first poster, which they had me do on my 2nd day after I had a week&#39;s experience in letterpress 2 years ago in college. Not sure if that&#39;s good or really really bad... <BR> <BR>Regarding prices, they go 1-color for $1.50 per poster, 2-color for $2, and 3-colors for $2.60. Minimum is 100 posters and typical size is like 14&#34;x21&#34;. Pretty cheap, I&#39;d say. They put out a lot of really good work and some I think is subpar. Those are the breaks of tight deadlines. <BR> <BR>I&#39;m glad you guys like my Halloween costume. Lots o&#39; work... <BR> <BR>Darrel, I&#39;ve looked at Hamilton online before, and I&#39;ve read somewhere online that you worked there, so what&#39;s your affiliation with them?

		<div class="commentbody">This hasn&#39;t been mentioned &#40;I think&#41; but you can also cut wood with laser, from your digital files. <BR> <BR>There are a number of folks here and about that do this, either as artisans or commercially. It is used quite a bit in the signage industry. There was some discussion about it a while back on the PPLetterpress list. <BR> <BR>There are several laser cutters at Art Center College of Design and I have taken the workshop that they offer. The cutting edge is quite clean. My doorsign was cut by laser from a computer file I furnished.  <BR> <BR>Some very beautiful work can be produced three dimensionally as well. And for letterpress, <BR>subtle sub-surface detail work is possible &#40;similar to the kinds of work sometimes seen in <BR>well produced nineteenth century wood engravings&#41;. <BR> <BR>Several of the students enrolled in the letterpress courses at Art Center use the process <BR>to produce cuts and large blocks of type.  <BR> <BR>This is a very good means &#40;one would think&#41; in which to fill in existing fonts of wood type or to re-create historical fonts. <BR> <BR>Gerald Lange <BR><a href="http://bielerpress.blogspot.com" target="_blank">http://bielerpress.blogspot.com</a> <BR><a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/PPLetterpress" target="_blank">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/PPLetterpress</a></div>
