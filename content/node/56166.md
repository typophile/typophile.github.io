  keep in mind when designing a book typeface. For example, newspaper types have certain
  demands, which are usually much more clear, like relatively large x-height, short
  ascenders/descenders, different grades, very prominent details, etc.\r\n\r\nAre
  there such aspects you would pay attention to when designing a typeface for books?
  Or what makes a book typeface a book typeface."

    are basically major generalizations, like the examples I mentioned for newspaper
    types, but it's for a short presentation I'm going to give at my school, and it's
    nice to be able to list a few of those aspects so people understand what I mean."

  body: "<em>...what makes a book typeface a book typeface.</em>\r\n\r\nStatistically,
    a book typeface most resembles Times Roman, the face most used for pulp fiction.\r\nIronically,
    it was designed for a newspaper.\r\nOf course, other types are suitable for books,
    such as Univers 75, here used in <em>Ways of Seeing</em>:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/WOS_5754.jpg]"

  body: "This is sort of off the question a bit ...\r\n\r\nHere's sort of something
    I do with my students when talking about setting type for books. I have them play
    around with what is available on the computers. Then when critiquing what they've
    come up with, I bring them into a detailed discussion that leads to: \r\n\r\n'Would
    you want to read this for, oh, 1,000 pages or so?'\r\n\r\nOnce put in that context,
    it really narrows the field of type choices - Times New Roman suddenly gets really
    heavy, any Sans seem to fall away (except for the Most Determined of the Bunch
    to make Futura Book actually work) and display faces are shown the door (sometimes)
    ;)\r\n\r\nWe seem to settle on faces that are traditional, but take into account
    Offset printing - the adaptations of Adobe's faces - Garamond, Jenson, Caslon
    - where thin strokes (which worked great in letterpress) have been modified to
    work well using current printing technologies - seem to hold up overall.\r\n\r\nAt
    least, after searching everywhere for a good Shakespeare collection for my wife,
    we settled on The Pelican Shakespeare because (1) it was the most legible complete
    set we could find and we after purchasing, the colophon noted (2) it was set in
    Adobe Garamond. :)\r\n\r\nThat doesn't really answer the question - but does lead
    to students exploring on their own what may constitute a good book face. \r\n\r\nSometimes
    they get it, sometimes they don't. But they start taking it apart on their own
    and its fun to see where they go with it. \r\n\r\nAnd I get to get to say things
    like: 'Courier? No.'\r\n\r\n\r\ns.\r\nmehallo.com"

    was more looking for short (generalizing) factoids that make those hold up overall,
    like; relatively long asc/descenders, relatively wide spacing, maybe slightly
    heavier captials, prominent interpuntion, etc.\r\n\r\nFor newspaper typefaces
    the demands are -- I think -- a bit more clear. Like every weight having more
    than one grade (to counter different presses / paper / dot-gain), large x-height
    (to be able to use small pointsize) and very prominent detailing and inktraps
    (so the inkspread is countered), etc. I was wondering if people here keep such
    things in mind when designing a typeface that is more for book usage. \r\n\r\nI
    understand the question was kind of silly, but I think such aspects make it clear
    for people to understand what kind of details a type designer might pay specific
    attention to when designing a typeface for certain kinds of use. :)"
