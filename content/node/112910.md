  typeface speak with.\r\n\r\nI hope you could help me with some few suggestions\r\nof
  typefaces conveying 'clean energy', 'spatial technologies'.\r\n\r\nI would say Futura
  and Century Gothic would be two good options\r\nbut I well know I can be far from
  hitting the nail on the head.\r\n\r\nThanks so much in advance for your sound advice. "
