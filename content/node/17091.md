  sale? I want a couple of bits - that Kern hoody and the serif/star tshirt.\r\n\r\nAny
  ideas? I don't want to go ordering only for them to halve the price next week.\r\n\r\nCheers"

    not disappointed: the <a href=\"http://www.veer.com/partner/link.aspx?i=1048&c=4&p=products/merchdetail.aspx?image=VPR0001260\">KERN
    zip-up</a> is hoodless. But I got one for Christmas (<a href=\"http://typophile.com/node/16962\">like
    everyone else</a>) and it's lovely."

  body: "I ordered a KERN zip-up a few weeks ago. They are on back order.  They [merchants
    in general] usually only have sales on stuff that isn't moving well.  Those things
    fly out of the place so I wouldn't count on a discount sale anytime soon.\r\n\r\nChrisL"

  body: Veer is not a retail clothing outlet... I don't think they'd have a sale unless
    they were trying to get rid of their stock.

  body: The KERN zipup is on back order anyway and since they never sent me a confirming
    email to let me know they received my order, I have no idea whether or not I'm
    getting one... bad customer service!

  body: ">bad customer service!\r\n\r\nThis is likely related to the fact that Veer
    is set up to license and deliver digital IP, not clothing. Scripty fonts and pictures
    of kittens should never be out of stock. \r\n\r\nCheers, Si"

    they received & processed my order which they should do whether it's a kitten
    pic or a jacket.\r\n\r\nGiven how many people on this web site ordered this jacket
    I'm not surprised it's out of stock."
