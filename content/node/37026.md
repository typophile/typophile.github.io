    please tell your New York friends about the IFC Center run! Especially this weekend's
    screenings, we're up against <cite>3:10 to Yuma</cite> and loads of studio and
    indie competition. Actually I think <cite>3:10 to Yuma</cite> uses Helvetica for
    their posters...\r\n\r\nCheers!\r\n\r\n-Gary"

  body: I just went to the 8:20 screening - line halfway down the block. Lots of design
    geeks here in the apple. When I told my neighbor I'd been to a movie about a font
    he looked at me like I was nuts. Anyway I loved it and the hell with EULAs I'll
    just use Helvetica for everything from now on.

    to my cousin there (who's not a design person), but perhaps her and her wife will
    go."

  body: "I went with my fellow design student friend/roommate and.. my other friend/roommate,
    an engineer, to Saturday's 8:20 show. Engineer friend had no idea what movie we
    were seeing until we told her, on the steps of IFC, that we were seeing a movie
    about Helvetica. A long silence. A blank look. And then finally a glare. To make
    things worse, we arrived late and couldn't sit together. \r\n\r\nShe didn't NOT
    enjoy herself, though..but she has made it clear several times over that she would
    have liked to see a \"real\" movie. Heh."

    buddy of mine, who also dug it. When we stepped out of the theater he was looking
    at all sorts of signs and spotted Helvetica being used inside and outside of IFC
    Center.  :-)\r\n\r\nLater we knocked back a few at McSorley's and talked about
    type-related stuff like Grotesks and Egyptians...\r\n\r\nThank you, Gary and Veer,
    for a great movie!"
