    original is not available. Based on the irregular horizontal and vertical scaling,
    I should add. I don't think this would be a conscious choice by the designer.\r\n\r\nYou
    could try the Type ID Board -- that's the one with the by-line \"Need to know
    what font it is? Post it here.\""
