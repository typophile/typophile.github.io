    Bold</a>, but it feels like it.

  body: It looks remarkably similar to <strong>Rosetti</strong>, a 1930s issue from
    ATF. I am not aware of any digital versions of it at the present time, but I am
    working on one, which will probably be issued in mid-October or mid-November.

  body: "I completely agree that this looks like Sniffin's 'Rosetti' (it's on p. 272
    of Mac McGrew's \"American Metal Typefaces of the Twentieth Century\"). Nick,
    you were the one I thought would have been likely to have digitized this when
    Kara first sent this ID request to me, and I searched through all your fonts for
    something similar, but I see you are still working on it. Should be a good one
    with those swash style initials, if you are including them.\r\n\r\nAnother font
    with a somewhat similar feel is <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/nora-itc/\"
    target=\"new\">ITC Nora</a>.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: My version of Rosetti will include the swash initials in a separate font,
    and it will be released this month. <strong>ITC Nora</strong> appears to be based
    on Paul Carlyle and Gus Oring's work, and is a lighter weight version than my
    <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/nicksfonts/shishka-bob-nf/" target-"_blank">Shishka
    Bob</a>, based on same also.
