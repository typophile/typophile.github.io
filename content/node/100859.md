  it because I find it interesting that here in the Algarve, Portugal, there exist
  so many signs and ads from the 70s and 80s which use the 'fancy' font Jackson MN.
  [img:sites/default/files/old-images/jackson8_4877.png] In the following pictures
  I captured some of the places where I've seen it, but I remember at least four more,
  in the north of Portugal, suggesting this 'mania' was not only in one or two design
  shops. Personally, I have to say that I find it quite unique, although I wouldn't
  really use it in any of the things I do.\r\n1. Here the font displays 'm\xF3veis'
  at a furniture shop: [img:sites/default/files/old-images/jackson1_4362.jpg]\r\n2.
  Here the sign reads 'snack-bar \"the caterpillar\"'. If I'm not mistaking, the tr\xE9ma
  was used instead of the quotation-marks: [img:sites/default/files/old-images/Jackson3_4718.jpg]\r\n3.
  Here is the logo of the Australian tissue company ABC: [img:sites/default/files/old-images/jackson2_6582.png]\r\n4.
  Here we see a printers shop advertising: [img:sites/default/files/old-images/jackson4_4042.jpg]\r\n5.
  A map of my hometown, which my father designed together whit a friend (the map,
  not the town): [img:sites/default/files/old-images/jackson6_4096.jpg]\r\n6. A mistake
  in the above-mentioned map: [img:sites/default/files/old-images/jackson7_6621.jpg]
  \ here the V was accidentally swapped with a Y, so the near-by village of Alvor
  is 'Alyor'. The Y and V are very similar: [img:sites/default/files/old-images/jackson9_4474.png]\r\n7.
  Jackson MN was so popular, that somebody even made a crude imitation of it on the
  wall of the municipal market of Ferragudo: [img:sites/default/files/old-images/jackson5_4217.jpg].
  Sorry for putting in such large-sized images, you'll have to open them in another
  window."
