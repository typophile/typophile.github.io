body: does anyone know of any good european universities that have a good typography
  and graphic design program for MFA? was hoping to go to berlin. i looked at Berlin
  University of Art and Design  but it looks like they don't really cover type and
  i can't understand what they're saying even though they have an english version
  of their site. can anyone point me in some directions?
