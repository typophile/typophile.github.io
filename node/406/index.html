  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Hey all! <BR> <BR>I&#39;m creating a gag Scotch label for a friend&#39;s Scotch bar. I&#39;ve bought a few books on Scotch that have some reference, but does anyone know any sites or books devoted wholly or partially to Scotch label design? <BR> <BR>There should be. I&#39;ve been staring at his labels for the past year &#40;over pints of Guinness... I don&#39;t really like Scotch&#41; and some of them are quite beautiful ? flourishes, varnishes, etchings and whatnot. Of course, I&#39;ve photographed some of them for reference as well. <BR> <BR>Anything about Scotch in this thread is welcome. I need to kick-start my mind. <BR> <BR>Cheers! L&#39;chaim! Kanpai! <BR> <BR>p</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Hmm... is Google broken your end Paul? Found these in a matter of seconds: <BR> <BR><a href="http://web.inter.nl.net/hcc/Langenberg/Whiskylabels.html" target="_blank">http://web.inter.nl.net/hcc/Langenberg/Whiskylabels.html</a> <BR><a href="http://www.whisky-blenders.demon.co.uk/fblends2.htm" target="_blank">http://www.whisky-blenders.demon.co.uk/fblends2.htm</a> <BR> <BR>The second one has a number of following pages, each page having 5 or 6 thumbnails of labels that you can click to get larger images. <BR> <BR>The selection should be useful but it depends whether your parody is based on the sort of Bell&#39;s/Teacher&#39;s/White Horse blended product or on the more obscure single malts. I realise from this thread that Scotch and typography don&#39;t seem to mix, but should anyone be interested I would highly recommend the &#34;Ubiquitous Chip&#34; restuarant in the West End of Glasgow for their fantastic selection of fine whiskies &#40;and really good food, of course&#41;.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Google isn&#39;t broken, but I most certainly must be. And I always forget about google images. Some purty ugly stuff there as well! But lots of good, clean reference as with your links, Jay. <BR> <BR>I am going the obscure single malt way because this bar is an obscure single malt sort of establishment. The owner picked up some single malt on a research trip to Scotland and wants to pass it off as his bar&#39;s own blend to his friends. <BR> <BR>I will post some of my research to help prove that Scotch and Typography most certainly DO mix. Though I may prove along the way that I mix well with NEITHER Typography nor Scotch. <BR> <BR>Thanks for doing my work for me Randy and Jay! If you&#39;re ever in Kanazawa, stop by Machrihanish for Scotch or a pint on me!</div>
