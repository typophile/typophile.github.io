I love the pangram and it is crazy genius. It's also very easy for me to remember. We were just in the Virgin Islands where liquor cost about a fourth of what it cost here. So we did pack our bags with five dozen liquor jugs. They actually even have special boxes for the tourists to load 'em up.</div>

I did a google and found a book reference to Robin Oxman. It said this message was sent by D.H. Lawrence during WWI about a "screw up soldier who had fallen in a river." "Warm plucky GHQ jinx, fez to B.V.D's."</div>

All 26 are covered up to the "x" in maximize, but I needed a few more letters for condensed and italics, and being an ad man from way back, had to close with a benefit (if not a call to action).

The point was made that sex, whores, and evil are all mentioned in the Bible. I think if people knew this, more of them would read the Bible.
