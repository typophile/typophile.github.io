body: "Hey everyone, I have been given the task of redesigning my workplace's website.
  Unfortunately, the original designer is no longer available and the \"higher ups\"
  want to keep the same font for the new logo. I have tried everything I could think
  of to match this font with absolutely no luck. You all are my last hope! Thanks
  in advance!\r\n\r\n(The specific font I'm looking for is the one used on the top
  line of the logo provided.)"
