  to date, and I am still flirting with the process of creating an attractive and
  logical margin. I am now working on a new book with the slightly odd dimensions
  of 5 7/8 x 7 1/2. I was wondering if anyone had any suggestions of well done books
  in this size, or margin sizes they would recommend!!! \r\nThanks Guys!!\r\nM."

  body: "Ha, right. And sometimes my multi-tasking skills result in not quite finishing
    a task. It's an approx. 200 page book of short(er) stories (same author) which
    will have black and white illustrations through out. It sounds like there will
    be approx. 30 illustrations in total, however they will be contained to a separate
    page from any of the text so manuscript will be a solid block of text. The dimensions
    are a little bit more squat then what I'm use to working with (at lest for this
    company). I've never thought to ask this forum for examples or suggestions before,
    would love some hints on how people come to their margins. \r\n\r\nThanks for
    asking Miss Tiffany."

  body: "Binding is important -- how will it be bound? For example, with perfect binding,
    you trim off 1/8\" of the F&Gs (folded & gathered sheets) & glue what remains.
    Notch binding, on the other hand, doesn't cut off any paper, but cuts a notch
    in the signatures, which helps the eventual glue to hold things together better.
    Still, notch bindings are usually \"tight,\" and I often use the same inside margin
    for notch bound as for perfect bound books.\r\n\r\nYou need to set the inside
    margin first, for the binding, because if you get that one too small, words are
    \"lost\" -- really, hard to read, unless you pry the book open. For perfect bound
    or notch bound paperbacks, I use a minimum of 13/16-inch (4.875 picas). 5-picas
    would be better, and even 7/8 inch (5.25 picas) is reasonable; almost necessary
    with perfect binding. With Smyth-sewn, case-bound books, you can use as little
    as 3/4 inch (4.5 picas), but I doubt the book you're working on will be swen.\r\n\r\nNow
    unless the publisher is requiring a certain number of characters per page, you
    also know your outside margin better not be any smaller. Optically, if you use
    the same numerical value, the inside margin will be tighter, due to the binding.
    The usual aesthetic would have the outside margin even larger.\r\n\r\nOK, 5-7/8
    inches equals 35.25 picas. A 5 pica gutter and 5.25 pica outside margin leaves
    possible measure of 25 picas. If you can go a little less (say, 24 picas), that
    give you a better outside margin.\r\n\r\nWith the head margin, the classical look
    was always 1/2 inch (3 picas) to the top of the type page (ascender of the running
    head if there is one, ascender of the first text line otherwise). But trimming
    today isn't what it use to be. If you use 1/2 inch, they will mis-trim some signatures
    and you'll wind up with a top margin that is sometimes too small. So, even if
    I want a fairly tight top margin, I'd allow 9/16 inches (3.375 picas). Remember,
    that's to the ascender position, not baseline. The bottom margin should be at
    least twice the top margin. If you're using a foot folio, you don't have to count
    it in the 1+ inches at the bottom, but if you are using a running foot & they
    are reasonably long, you have to pay attention to how that affects the bottom
    white space.\r\n\r\nThese are by no means classical -- those ratios are available
    in books such as Bringhurst. But it gives a nice enough page. Be sure your leading
    isn't so great as to overpower the margins.\r\n\r\nFinally, even after 30 years
    of setting & designing books, as a final check, I trim my layout sheets to the
    final book trim size to see how the white space you actually will get looks with
    the text.\r\n\r\nHope that's of some use ...\r\n\r\n"

    be very helpful not only for this book but also for others in the future.

  body: "One thing to add about this book, you do have the illustrations to consider,
    and how they fit on the page. Usually, images are aligned with the x-height of
    the first text line, sometimes with the ascender height of the first text line.\r\n\r\nOk,
    if the images are short & you aren't running text below them, that could look
    awkward. You might have to drop the text block down a bit on the page. You can
    just sink the images more, but that can get tricky.\r\n\r\nNow if you have no
    running heads, the images so placed will ride higher, perhaps too high. So if
    you have no running head, I'd increase the top margin a bit. If you can run text
    below the images, no problem. But if you can't you may have to fiddle with the
    top margin; I can't just give you a number.\r\n\r\nBut I can't imagine book of
    short stories without running heads. The running head, by the way, should (almost
    always) be closer to the text block than the trim; you usually don't want a large
    white band between the text & running head. You can use a device such as a rule
    below the RH to gain a little more space, but not much, and such rules carry their
    own problems & promises. Usually, you omit the running head on a page with only
    art, BTW.\r\n\r\nWith that 7-1/2 inch vertical trim, you could drop the whole
    type page (text plus RH) down a bit, with the expense of a slightly bigger foot
    margin to match. Just don't unbalance your inside & outside margins with too big
    a head margin.\r\n\r\nThe point is that you need to be able to place the full-page
    illustrations well, and that might take some fiddling.\r\n\r\nFWIW"

  body: When you open a book up, the feathering out of the pages has the effect of
    making paper visible beyond the outer margins. Thus the white space beyond the
    text blocks seem greater than the margin on an individual page. This needs to
    be considered too when devising margins. You may want to make the outer margins
    slightly smaller than you would if you were just considering individual pages.
    Trimming and inserting pages of a spread in a bound book to judge appearance is
    a good way of helping get a handle on this.

  body: "I want to point out that most of the trimming, etc., comments in charles'
    first post are probably irrelevent, as the imposition system of the printer should
    deal with all that. You should only have to worry about what is happening inside
    the crop marks. Check with the printer to confirm this (by the dimensions you
    give, it sounds like this is being printed commercially).\r\n\r\nAs for the margin
    dimensions, I agree totally with charles' figures. You can even get away with
    as little as a 3 pica (half inch) margin, if the text is large enough for the
    measure. The wider margins are nicer for those of us with fat fingers, of course."

    first post are probably irrelevent, as the imposition system of the printer should
    deal with all that.</cite>\r\n\r\nIrrelevant? Back in the late 1990s I routinely
    specified a half-inch head margin. Several books when done (trimmed & bound),
    wound up with head margin closer to 5/16 -- and on an angle, to boot. Was that
    a mistake by the printer? Sure. So, best case is the printer agrees, and you can
    reject the job & have it done over at the printer's expense (& there goes your
    schedule). But the printer may insist that such trimming (3/16s off) was within
    his specs. Or the printer might say that you tacitly accepted the trim when you
    approved F&Gs, or failed to ask for F&Gs to approve.\r\n\r\nI'm not talking about
    imposition problems, just flat out sloppy trimming. When that happened, I checked
    with a couple friends who managed the production of a lot of books, and they said,
    yes, it's no longer safe to specify a half-inch head margin if you really need
    a half an inch.\r\n\r\nIf your printers still hold to 3/32 on trimming, a half-inch
    head margin is probably safe."

  body: If you know who the publisher is get them involved in the layout issues. Paper
    weight alone can change everything. A little of early consulting will save you
    huge head aches especially when the client changes specs. If you have a good working
    relationship with the printer/publisher you can nip any client changes later in
    the project. This is more a method of work flow rather than mechanics.
