  body: "I like it! Something slightly chafes with the bowls of the lower case a and
    the capital P, perhaps because they're right next to each other and of so obviously
    different character. Perhaps try to reduce the spur of the a slightly and make
    the top of its bowl meet the stem more vertically?\r\n\r\nAlso, to my eye at least
    the straight right side of the last a makes the gray space behind it look narrower
    than the equivalent on the other side. Maybe that's just me. :)\r\n\r\nOh, and
    does it scale okay? Have you tried printing it small? Always a risk with narrow
    lines."

  body: I like it, but the a feel a bit distracting, being somewhat "curvier" than
    the rest.

  body: "Excellent thought provoking feedback Birdseeding, thanks man. I'm still in
    the tweaking phase of this, I was wondering about the a/p relationship as well.
    And yes, the margins of the containing shape should probably reflect that of the
    interior spacing...or at least as close as possible. \r\n\r\nRunning print tests
    on this as soon as I'm done replying. \r\n\r\nValid point riccard0, I think if
    I straighten out the top of the bowl on the a I can better match the straightness
    of the P. "

  body: P is a bit too wide, or is it intentional?

  body: 'Alex, you think? I wouldn''t say the P is too wide, I felt it should closely
    match that of the T, and take up a comparable visual space as the a''s. I wish
    I would have uploaded an un-altered version of this with the small capped P just
    so you could see just how narrow it was. I played around with the widths quite
    a bit and this felt the best. '

  body: Another option would be to change the structure of the /P/ so that the bowl
    branches out from the stem at the top (like the /n/) rather than emerging at a
    right angle.

  body: Clean and Clear. I think there is some spacing work is needed. Too much space
    after the s, also both side of the T.
