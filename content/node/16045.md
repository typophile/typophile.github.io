body: Hello everyone. I'm getting ready to purchase FontLab but I would love to hold
  off if Studio 5 is coming any time soon for OS X. Anyone know of any dates as to
  the release, if soon at all?

    the year; It''s true they''ve been "working on it" for a long time, but I suspect
    this is a good estimate, since they have released the PC version. '

  body: The first beta of the Mac version is in the testers' hands. It's pretty tight
    for the most part, but there are a lot of problems which Yuri, Cyril, and crew
    will need to fix before release.

  body: "FontLab Studio 5 for Mac is under serious development and is currently in
    beta test. I can assure everybody that the development cycle will take much less
    than that of FontLab Studio 5 for Windows. During the development of the Windows
    version we have been actively planning and adding new features and basically shaping
    the application. The functionality of Studio 5 is ready with the Windows version
    and our developers now are working hard on getting the same functionality to the
    Mac version. So the testing that is currently under way is about \"does everything
    work as planned\" and not about \"what could we add here\". \r\n\r\nIndeed, our
    plan is to release FontLab Studio 5 for Mac in December. \r\n\r\nRegards, \r\nAdam
    \r\n"

    background color on Typophile (if that's what you mean) is #efefef. Rather than
    use the background color when I post an image (it could change any time, you know),
    I use either a gif or png with a transparent background. png's are the best because
    the transparency can be gradual. Vis:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/sb.png]"
