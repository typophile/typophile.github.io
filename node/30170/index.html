<p>&ldquo;When embedding fonts the document must not include more than 60%(percent) of the character set of any individual style of the font before any distribution is allowed to take place. Using Adobe Illustrator or any similar applications which convert the font characters into editable outlines is NOT an acceptable means of producing an electronic document for distribution.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That seems arbitrarily and overly restrictive to me.</p>
<p>I never understood the fear of PDF embedding. It&rsquo;s like telling people that you can only use half of the characters for each individual you print.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s one of those &lsquo;punish the paying customer for things other people do&rsquo; it seems.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You will secure embedded documents against unauthorized use by any third party&rdquo;</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s even worse. Sounds like if someone steals my car and robs a bank, I&rsquo;m liable. (Maybe I am&hellip;these are odd times&hellip;)</p>

<p>What I find particularly odd is the restriction against even including <em>outlines</em> of the font. Is there some reason other than simply preventing piracy? And if its just to prevent piracy isn&rsquo;t it a bit paranoid to think that someone would rip the outlines from a PDF instead of just downloading a pirate copy?</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Bunch of great info here. Thanks guys! MyFonts generic agreement was kind of &hellip;generic. And not how I want to share my stuff.</p>
<p>I have to say, the readability of Vllg&rsquo;s agreement is very nice. Specifically, I read <a href="http://www.vllg.com/Village/Mavis/Licensing/">the 1.3 for the village branded Mavis</a>. This is the open license? Thinking I can cobble something out of that with some snips of Fountain&rsquo;s details.</p>
<hr>
<p>The typetrust agreement seems to parallels an idea I was toying around with. Is there a market for (or an example anyone has an opinion on) having fonts purchasable under different licenses? Examples:</p>
<p>A &lsquo;Designer license&rsquo; might have unlimited machines that are used predominantly by a single person - I rarely use my antique laptop, but it would be nice to have the same fonts on that as the workstation and the server. A &lsquo;Corporate license&rsquo; might have unlimited machines owned by 1 company, and several sub-licenses for giving to print services. A &lsquo;Learning license&rsquo; might include support, A &ldquo;Custom Super Deluxe license Royale ' might include a finite number of custom glyph additions/modifications, etc.</p>
<p>If this was a viable route, shouldn&rsquo;t these be kept as separate products, with their own appropriate license embedded in them only? Is this even an interesting or good idea?</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t. I&rsquo;m actually really surprised you do, Tiff. If you look at how reasonably priced Type Trust&rsquo;s fonts are, you must admit it is unfair for a giant corporation like P&amp;G (for example) to only have to pay $200 when they plan to mass market and reap &ldquo;gi-normous&rdquo; profits using a typeface.

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I guess I&rsquo;m a little bit more on the side of graphic designers on that point. It seems unfair for anyone to have to get additional licensing simply to use a few glyphs to make a logo. If they were illustrative glyphs then I&rsquo;d understand, but to use the letters AT&amp;T and have to get additional licensing seems, like I said, a little over-the-top.</p>
<p>Yes, yes, from the type designers point-of-view, it sucks that a gi-normous company could get branded with three letters, but what about the rest of us that don&rsquo;t do logos for gi-normous companies?</p>
<p>At the end of the day, they can do whatever they think is fair in their license. It is up to them. But, they are turning away some customers.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>What I think all those exclusions mean is that for commercial use (even if it is just a logotype) you have to get a commercial license, which they don&rsquo;t sell on their website. The only have an automated cart to sell a something-else license, whatever it may be called. That they offer multiple licenses, but only one type via web seems the biggest bummer. I assume they base the &lsquo;larger&rsquo; license on the scale of the client, or something like that.</p>
<p>This makes me wonder, aside from the specific examples in the faq, what would not require a better license than the one they most readily sell. Booksetting, I suppose.</p>
<p>This method is the most like what I am proposing above, though I want to have them all accessible to the shopper to compare and pick. Is this too many choices, and confusing or senseless?</p>

<p>I agree with you and Simon here. I think branding is a &ldquo;gray area&rdquo; issue. Is it branding for a small fishing and tackle store in Anytown, USA? Or the new look of Tide detergent? Both are branding, but obviously there are different uses for each.</p>
<p>How about we introduce the idea that photo houses use with Rights Managed vs. Royalty-Free?</p>

<p>Terry, the idea of Rights Managed vs. Royalty-free fonts might eventually be something to consider. But first the masses must be educated&ndash;and for the record we geeks here on Typophile are not the masses&ndash;that there is value to deserve such licensing control.</p>
<p>Not to be pessimistic, but I wonder how many people have honestly licensed fonts from The Type Trust in regards to their EULA. Or, more to the point, how many people have licensed from them and then realized what they have done. Ah EULAs. Gotta love them.</p>

<p>If you have a font design that a corporation wants, you license it to them at the same rates as Lino or Mono. It could be even more! We have been fortunate enough to be involved in some of this and I know for a fact that in one project we were more expensive than Monotype. But the client eventually selected one of our designs.</p>
<p>Eric Olsen&rsquo;s Process Foundry has licensed some of their fonts for use on the Chevrolet account.</p>
<p>The problem, as I see it, is not the difference between large and small. It is that many small foundries under price their work. They haven&rsquo;t either looked for or gotten good advice as to current business practices as it relates to font license pricing.</p>
<p>There are some fairly consistent pricing models out there. You just have to do a bit of research. Speaking any more about pricing on a public forum could be construed as price fixing, so I&rsquo;ll leave it there.</p>

<p>Since a number of people here make a living making, productizing or selling it, the bias of the community might be towards recommending commercial products. Not out of direct greed, but out of an affinity to the rest of the industry, and a ingrained tendency to value all type.</p>
<p>Or, since free fonts are widely available and can be sampled prior to use indefinitely, &ldquo;we&rdquo; frown on askers, because it is a bit obtuse, like asking what&rsquo;s the number for 911? Ok, maybe I frown a little, too. ;)</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t go to a lawyer&rsquo;s forum looking for the info, and did some research first. I am aware of the difference between having your longtime estate lawyer draft a will and fill-in-the-blank will kits. Quality. But it is driving me crazy to write one-off agreements, and the examples above have been an immense help in drafting my own set, as have the responses to them from &ldquo;we&rdquo; type consumers. Some EULA is better than none, and I know I am getting what I pay for. Actually, I am getting an education, and it is a bargain.</p>

<cite>&hellip; At the end of the day, they can do whatever they think is fair in their license. It is up to them. But, they are turning away some customers.</cite></p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a little late coming into this thread, but I just wanted to add a few things that seem to be overlooked/assumed.</p>
<p>Tiff, you make it sound as though you expect a Commercial Use license to be completely unaffordable to the little guy.  This is not the case and is not inteded to turn away customers, but rather to involve them in a real discussion/recognition of the value of type.</p>
<p>The TypeTrust position is that it&rsquo;s wholly reasonable for a graphic designer to sell a logo for a few grand and in turn recognize the value of the typefaces used.  It&rsquo;s a matter of value, and always open to negotiation.</p>
<p>A license does not always have to be assigned a monetary value either.  There are other forms of exchange.  Listing designer credits would be ideal in the case of a magazine or book.  Other media such as billboards and broadcast would more likely be a matter of money.</p>
<p>If a potential customer reads any part of our EULA and decides not to license from us, then there is absolutley no harm done.  We&rsquo;d actually respect it as a genuine act of respect for the EULA.  If someone is reading and comparing EULAs, we&rsquo;re already happy.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re not in the retail font business to make a quick buck.  We&rsquo;re in it to publish good type and protect our interests in doing so.  We want to establish a clientbase rather than a customerbase&hellip; people who want to work with <i>us</i>, not just our fonts.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an optimistic view to expect the design community to someday understand the value and rights involved in creating and using digital type.  Some might call it &ldquo;over-the-top&rdquo;.  (Over the top of <i>what</i> is my question.)   But the greater design community&rsquo;s generally lax perception of the value of the type designer&rsquo;s work won&rsquo;t be heightened if we as type designers don&rsquo;t assert our positions and protect our interests.  A very specific, strict EULA is the first step in setting the stage.  Being open and available for comment and discussion is the next.</p>

Also, I could&rsquo;ve said something similar to you in that conversation should be the first step, not giving up.</div>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been looking for EULA writing info and figured to search instead of starting a new thread and asking the same things that have been asked all over again. Good thing I did, too.</p>
