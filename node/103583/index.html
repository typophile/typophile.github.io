  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>A question about EULA and pdfs.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m making a small-scale magazine, and I want to put it online so you can pay by paypal and get a mail with the pdf. So, this might be a newb question, but I guess its better to ask and be safe than to play cool and be sorry (or fuck someone over). I&rsquo;m going to use a font by Commercial which EULA reads</p>
<p><em>For the purposes of this Agreement, “Commercial Product” shall also mean, among other things, a user editable electronic document created by Use of the Font Software which is offered for distribution to the general public (or to some subset of the general public), in Flash type software distributed or exhibited, in gaming products or software where the extraction of the Font Software or the designs embodied therein may be extracted; or use on goods for sale as a commercial product in exchange for a separate fee or other consideration. However, a document distributed in connection with a commercial transaction in which the consideration is unrelated to such a document (for example, printed advertising, a business letter or a receipt for purchase of tangible goods such as clothing), or as other design materials distributed incidental to the purchase of goods or services, shall not be considered a Commercial Product.</p>
<p>a) Except as may be prohibited herein, you are permitted to electronically distribute a “Personal or Internal Business Use” document (that is, a document other than a Commercial Product as defined above) (i) that is in a static graphic image (for example, a “gif”) or in an embedded electronic document, and (ii) which is distributed in a format that permits only the viewing and printing (and not the editing, altering, enhancing, or modifying) of such static graphic image or embedded document. Personal or Internal Business Use shall not include any Use of the Font Software by persons that are not members of your immediate household, your authorized employees, or your authorized agents. All such household members, employees and agents shall be notified by you as to the terms and conditions of the Agreement and shall agree to be bound by it prior to use of the Font Software.
b) Use of the Font Software in sIFR (Scalable Inman Font Replacement) and Cufón is permitted. However, the use of @font-face or other forms of web embedding or web font replacement technologies, (“Font Replacement Technologies”) other than pdf as otherwise expressly permitted herein, each require the purchase of a license upgrade.</em></p>
<p>Commericals nifty &ldquo;what this paragraph means&rdquo; reads &ldquo;If a reader or user cannot create new content using one of our fonts in a PDF or Flash application, and the complete font is not embedded, no additional license is required.&rdquo;. So what I&rsquo;m wondering is, what is meant by &ldquo;the complete font is not embedded&rdquo;? If I put up a normal pdf, is this ok as long as it isn&rsquo;t editable? Is it possible to &ldquo;hack&rdquo; and extract a font from a normaly exported static pdf?</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><blockquote>what is meant by "the complete font is not embedded"?</blockquote>
<p>Exactly what it says. The two most common options when embedding fonts in a PDF are:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>to embed the complete font, which would mean all of the characters/glyphs, regardless of whether or not they have been used to generate the content.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>to subset the font, which will only include the characters/glyphs required to display the content. This would appear to comply with their requirements.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>Is it possible to "hack" and extract a font from a normaly exported static pdf?</blockquote>
<p>Yes, if you have used one of the embedding methods mentioned above. However, not all of the font data is retained and you are usually left without metrics data such as the kerning. If by &ldquo;static&rdquo; you mean that the text has been transformed to outlines or rasterised prior to being exported, then no font data, other than the design, will be retained in the PDF.</p>
