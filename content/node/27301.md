  of view. The example show uses Apple Chancery and Helvetica. I'd like to bring it
  up to date. What type is \"in\" for 2006? Can anyone one subject a good combination
  of type? (in the format of title/body combo).\r\n\r\nI'm new to working with type
  so any subjections would be gratefully received."
