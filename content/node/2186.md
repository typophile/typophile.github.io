  body: sorry, but when one person start a font, the concept is very important. <BR>to
    think in for what i want is very important... <BR>Tuco ramirez, of tcl, maybe
    thinked of the same mode, i dont know....the certain thing is two persons, one
    in chile and another in netherland worked in a font with a seemed spirit. <BR>
    <BR>both have a same humor, and indo sans can help you to solve some problems.

  body: 'Hi Maurice, <BR> <BR>It feels like Meta meets DIN. Not bad, but I have some
    little comments: <BR>- first of all you need to balance the thickness of the complete
    alphabet. On this pdf it seems that some parts are thicker than the other. <BR>-
    the &#39;a c e&#39; seem to be too wide  <BR>- try making the arm of the &#39;r&#39;
    longer and/or stronger <BR>- I would also try making the leg of the &#39;t&#39;
    longer <BR>- the &#39;s&#39; needs work. Try lifting the end of the lower curve,
    make it more round <BR>- take the curves of the &#39;n&#39; and put them on the
    &#39;m&#39;. That seems to be too round compared to the &#39;n&#39; <BR>- I would
    take the curvy edge of the left leg of the &#39;u&#39; out <BR>- You make diagonal
    ends of the upper legs of the &#39;x&#39;, why not also at the bottom? <BR>- try
    making the tail of the &#39;y&#39; more daring. It needs a bit of a sparkle. The
    &#39;y&#39; is also a bit too open at the top. <BR> <BR>Phoei, that&#39;s it for
    now. I&#39;m curious about an update. <BR> <BR>De groeten, <BR>Ren'

  body: 'Maurice, your sans s very nice. lc &#34;e&#39; seems a bit wide compared
    to its neighbors bcd and f. &#34;g&#34; is very nice. Weigths need work not consistant.
    As a work in progree it would be my opinion that this is worth finishing. '
