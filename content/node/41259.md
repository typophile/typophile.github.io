  I recall that I found odd to associate the initials m, d, p to the typefaces throughout
  history, while Bringhurst was introducing them to me. And then I understood the
  term fo(u)nt : the source of the drawing, of the contour, the expression of a specific
  letter shape. However, we are only looking at physical part of it. It's true that
  typography has changed and that our computer screens are a \"rough and bad quality
  paper\", as Spiekermann answered a question of mine. But when we are thinking of
  typography these days, and quite for some time already the project, the faculty,
  the questions and problems related to drawing shapes of the letters leave its fount,
  and live beyond it. What I mean is that we need to distinguish the duality of typeface
  design. It's true that today we only speak in digital terms, but the quantic mechanics
  of typography remain the \"leaded\" ones.\r\nIt's hard for me to treat font and
  typeface as synonyms, because it removes the project and the art of the shapes and
  transform it into bezier curves and points. What about the personality? What about
  the character and carism? When we talk about Univers..., do we see the accomplishment
  of the purpose, or do we see a box of tiny volumes of lead?\r\n\r\nWhat do you think
  about this? Shall we call it typeface, or font?"

  body: "I've only been in typography for a short time, so please forgive any misinformation...\r\n\r\nIn
    my readings, the general idea is that a typeface refers to a family, and a font
    specifies a point-size, roman, bold, italic, etc.\r\n\r\nThis said, someone using
    a bold italic form of \"Times New Roman\" should not really be including \"Roman.\"
    Would it not then be \"Times New Bold Italic?\" Hopefully they'll come to their
    senses and just choose a different face altogether! ;)\r\n\r\nAnyway, I think
    that digital faces have blurred the line between the two terms for the layman,
    but to me (us?) there's the fundamental difference mentioned above.\r\n"

  body: "The confusion over correct nomenclature continues to muddy since even us
    \"experts\" blurr the definitions as time wears on.\r\n\r\nInstead of getting
    too granular in definitions, let's consider the broader picture:\r\n\r\nA <strong>type
    design</strong> is to a type designer like a song is to a composer.\r\n\r\nA song
    can be sung at different octives, by various performers and cadence but essentially
    what you <em>HEAR</em> is the same song. \r\n\r\nA <strong>type design</strong>
    (expressed in letterform or individual typeface) is what you <em>SEE</em>... printed
    in books, on the TV or computer screen, adhered on the sides of trucks, cut or
    sandblasted in stone.\r\n\r\nA <strong>font</strong> is to a typeface like recorded
    media is to music or song.\r\nYou can listen to the same \"performance\" of <a
    href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al_jolson\" target=\"new\">Al Jolson</a> singing
    <em>Swanee</em> from old films, shellac and vinyl records, audio tape, eight-track
    or cassette, video tape, CD, DVD, Blueray, online or downloadable digital, and
    whatever the future will bring.\r\n\r\nSimilar to the arguments by musicians and
    audiophiles -- designers, typophiles will debate the loss or gains of a type design
    when \"rendered\" by different font technologies.\r\n\r\nBut alas, I fear most
    people use the term \"font\" to everything type related.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: I'm with all of you regarding the distinction between typeface and font, but
    I do get concerned that non-graphic designers I talk to won't know immediately
    what I mean when I say "typeface," whereas everyone nowadays knows what a "font"
    is. When I have to say "typeface" and then say "font" to clarify, I feel like
    I really sound pretentious. Do you use "typeface" with the typographically naive,
    or do you just suck it up and use "font"?

    It seems that I have touched one of the main discussion topics of this microscopic
    area. Maybe it wasn\xB4t clear enough, but I never used the terms as synonyms,
    and I DO NOT think they are the same.\r\nWonderful comparison Norberto. It was
    as clear to me as listening to the PNY album of Portishead without being able
    to be in the center of the orchestra :(.\r\nI just find quite insulting to talk
    about typefaces as if they only existed in binary language... where is Jenson
    among all that? Or Griffo? Or Garamond?... and don't have to go that far... what
    about Akzidenz Grotesk or Helvetica, Univers? They were first made of metal. And
    apollo? Do not forget it was conceived to use with a film pelicule...\r\nWhat
    I mean is... the font is only the means you materialize the original thinking,
    drawing... a good example? What about a Bodoni on a coated paper? A huge mistake...
    that I have to see in hundreds of female magazines...but that's only a radical
    position. I can accept that a typeface like Didot may funtion from 72pts on...
    So everything has its on context, artistic, historic, cultural, economical...\r\nAnyway...
    thank you for your opinion. :)"
