body: Hello All, <BR> <BR>The following is a screen capture from the movie The Omega
  Man. It features a font I&#39;ve seen many times being used in projects of the period
  &#40;1960s-early 80s&#41;. Perhaps it&#39;s most notable use was as the typeface
  used for the Knight Rider television show. I&#39;ve tried my usual sources. Does
  anyone know its name and whether it&#39;s been digitized?  <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/23568.jpg"

  body: Or maybe not. There&#39;s another one in the Solotype Catalog called Kildare
    that looks like a better match.

  body: It doesn&#39;t appear to be available commercially. A bit surprising as it
    was pretty common in the phototype days.

  body: <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/solotype/excelsis/">Excelsis</a> is
    similar but not quite identical to Rubens. I remember seeing Rubens on one of
    the Solotype CD&#39;s, probably the Victorian one. <a href="http://www.castcraft-software.com">Castcraft/Optifont</a>
    also sells <a href="http://www.castcraft-software.com/designer3/designer3.11.html">a
    version</a>. There is a &#34;freeware&#34; version of dubious origin under the
    name <a href="http://www.grimghosts.com/down/fonts/fonts.html">Ruben</a>. <BR>
    <BR>I worked on a new digitization of a condensed Rubens-style typeface, based
    on typography from Disney&#39;s Haunted Mansion attractions. It&#39;s called <a
    href="http://www.grimghosts.com/down/fonts/fonts.html">Ravenscroft</a> and is
    freeware. <BR> <BR><a href="http://www.frontiernet.net/~treehous/Typefaces.html">Treehouse</a>
    also has a Haunted Mansion inspired font called <a href="http://www.frontiernet.net/~treehous/Mansion.html">Victorian
    Mansion</a>.
