body: "The Double Acute accent, or Hungarumlaut, is a character that practically only
  occurs in the Hungarian language. Months back I posted a thread about it, because
  I feel there's a basic problem with the way the glyphs /\u0151/ and /\u0171/ are
  normally drawn, based on what I percieve to be a set of faulty guidelines for how
  to draw it. Not sure it matters immensely, but this site is for detail fanatics,
  isn't it? :D\r\n\r\nThe [[http://diacritics.typo.cz/index.php?id=24|Diacritics Project]]
  claims, in line with how most faces are drawn, that the double acute is meant to
  be <strong>optically centred</strong> over the character. Quite a common practice
  is also to set the accents <strong>tight</strong> next to each other, see for instance
  in [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/marksimonson/proxima-nova/thin/characters.html|Proxima
  Nova]]. I percieve both these aspects as \"wrong\" - I admit from the start - because
  the diacritic is used as a \"long\" version of the umlaut, and should therefore
  as far as possible be <strong>spaced apart</strong> as much as a diaresis, and also
  (because it's \"rooted\" in the umlaut) <strong>lean significantly to the right</strong>,
  <em>not</em> optically centred but right of optical centre.\r\n\r\nI was on holiday
  in Hungary recently and took the opportunity to photograph some signs around town
  with double acutes on them. I decided to focus mainly on lettering, because this
  I think gives a good impression of how people \"instinctually\" draw the glyphs.
  But let me start with a stickerier tale of two /\u0151/s: \r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Budapesty-4030_5784.jpg]\r\n\r\nNow,
  this is clearly not lettering, but I think it reflects the dilemma quite well: In
  the top row, the sign maker has put the diacritics off the stickers as originally
  intended in the typeface, close to each other and optically centred; in the bottom
  row their feel for the writing has slippd in and they've spaced the diacritics wider
  than intended and put them futher right. I saw plenty of other examples of this
  \"mis-stickering\":\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Budapesty-4031_4901.jpg]\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Budapesty-4029_5562.jpg]\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Budapesty-4032_5807.jpg]\r\n\r\nThe
  last one is tight but still \"too far right\" by convention.\r\n\r\nMost extreme
  right-misstickering I saw all trip:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Budapesty-2571_5378.jpg]\r\n\r\nThing
  is. When taking pictures of signs my original impression of what was \"right\" or
  \"wrong\" got several more complications. To be fair, there are examples of several
  kinds below - pure lettering examples, some draughtsman's lettering, some engraved,
  some digital, some hand-painted:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Budapesty-4025_4009.jpg]\r\n\r\nTraditional
  Budapest street signage. BIG accents, right-leaning.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Budapesty-4027_5960.jpg]\r\n\r\nSort
  of a counterexample, but still clearly derived from and related to umlaut - low,
  flat, centred.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Budapesty-4026_3884.jpg]\r\n\r\nAnother
  sort of counterexample, but again clearly related to umlaut in shape and placement
  as before. This one is actually left of optical centre!\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Budapesty-3796_4439.jpg]\r\n\r\nSome
  fuck-off accents right there!\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Budapesty-4028_6451.jpg]\r\n\r\nSort
  of centred, but <em>very</em> widely spaced apart.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Budapesty-3427_5966.jpg]\r\n\r\nI
  realise it's script, but look how far right it goes compared to convetion! It also
  introduces <em>another</em> (still, I want to point out, umlaut-derived and related)
  variation I saw quite a bit on the hungarumlaut theme:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Budapesty-3487_5249.jpg]\r\n\r\nLong,
  tall, vertical lines for accents. The idea is similar to how they're drawn in hungarian
  handwriting.\r\n\r\n(I also had this great example of DIN-Engschrift-like draughtsman's
  lettering with entirely vertical lines for accents, which I think worked quite well.
  Seem to have lost it in my directory though, can't seem to find it alas.)\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Budapesty-3959_3784.jpg]\r\n\r\nOff
  a gravestone. Mostly still the \"enlongated style\" - very relatable to the umlaut!\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Budapesty-3960_6077.jpg]\r\n\r\nPart
  of a memorial wall in the cemetary. Right-leaner.\r\n\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nSo.
  What do you think? If I've learned anything it is to clearly relate the double acute
  to the umlaut. Am I right in thinking that?"

    at all. So they were added - as you can see on pictures 2,3,4,9,12 - later. This
    situation: misstickering, adding accents reflecting handwriting (or just imaginary
    ones), is typical for small \"adveritsing\" business in probably all postcommunistic
    countries. \r\n\r\nFor me, the best examples are: the first row of 1, then 6,7,8.\r\n"

  body: "Yup, those are the ones that are \"correct\" according to the standard type
    designer practice, sure. :)\r\n\r\nBut don't you think the fact that people (in
    adveritising, graphic designers, signmakers, draugthsmen, shopkeepers) are putting
    the diacritics instinctually in a different place is interesting?"

  body: "It always is interesting and sometimes - refreshing.\r\nBut it's contemporary
    type designers, who dictate the rules (or the typefaces dictate rules to the type
    designers), and vernacular solutions wouldn't work well in a font.\r\n\r\n(Many
    Poles, including me, write a- and eogonek with the tail turned leftwards, what
    is opposite to the norm, but I can't imagine the use of such form in [even a script]
    typeface - that would cause both readability- and typedesign-specific problems.)\r\n\r\n"

  body: "To a certain extent, I guess. Though considering the number of Hungarian
    type designers today (we're not talking Kis Mikl\xF3s here) it's worth remembering
    that the vast majority of typefaces are designed by people who don't read or use
    Hungarian.\r\n\r\nWhat I'm trying to suggest here is that Hungarians who do read
    the language largely see contemporary design practice as \"wrong\" - in feel,
    if nothing else - compared to how they understand the symbol to be. It would be
    interesting to do a survey among typography-aware Hungarians but this is as close
    as I've got right now, that and my own instinct. :)\r\n\r\nWhat problems would
    arise typographically - besides I guess kerning ones - from spacing out the accents
    more loosely and allowing a slight rightward overhang?"

    sense. After all, your examples show typographic/lettering work not of average
    native speakers but of designers (more or less). Gravestones are particularly
    interesting in this respect, and I would be curious to see more of them. And similar
    collections for other languages too ...\r\n"

  body: Personally, I think that "we" (I mean people using acutes), prefer when they
    lean a bit more to the right from the optical axis, because this kind of accent
    has a strong "vector". When the stroke leans to the right, it seems to refer to
    the inside part of a given, not preceding, letter.
