    about the historie of the Bremer Presse is:\r\n\r\nDie Bremer Presse, K\xF6nigin
    der deutschen Pressen, 1964 Typographische Gesellschaft M\xFCnchen\r\n\r\nBut
    its a bit pricey!\r\n \r\nThe Bibelschrift is available at <a href=\"http://www.moorstation.org/typoasis/blackletter/htm/bibelschrift.htm\">moorstation</a>.\r\n\r\nI
    like the Antiqua and the Greek, of course a bit plumb and dark, but something
    differend for its time. \r\n\r\nBTW, all his typefaces are cutted by Louis Hoell.
    I thing his influence is a last 50%. \r\n\r\n--<a href=\"http://www.astype.de\"

    get it gratis.\r\n\r\nBTW, do you know anything about this?:\r\n\"Die Bremer Hochschulreform

    Griesche, 1974.\r\n\r\n> Hoell\r\n\r\nThat name is familiar. What else did he
    cut?\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "So it's been over a year already?! Scary.\r\n\r\nOne of my students* is considering
    digitizing the Latin/Roman font cut by Hoell for Bremer. He says it's unlikely
    to go further than his own hard drive, but we agree that it might still be useful
    to research the rights situation (even though the design is over 80 years old)
    and/or find out if anybody has already digitized it. If things turn out to be
    sufficiently accomodating I'd like to encourage him to eventually release it,
    since it's a lustrous rara avis of a typeface.\r\n\r\n* http://typophile.com/node/30444\r\n\r\nAny
    ideas?\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
