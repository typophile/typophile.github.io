  body: I hadn't noticed Paratype cut of DIN Condensed has a spurred /G until this
    post. For all other versions of DIN Condensed like DIN Engschrift or 1451, /G
    is spurless and thus designally consistent with non-condensed DIN /G. Note for
    self, to remember for the future. Thanks Kevin for putting it to my attention.
