  body: Haha, I knew you'd end up asking how to solve it...the only problem is that
    I've never actually worked with FontLab or any other typeface creation software.
    I was just pointing out what I saw. I'm sure others will be able to help you out
    with that!

  body: "Eric;\r\n\r\nHave you added kerns to any character pairs yet? I'm guessijng
    you haven't. It looks like your spacing problems are due to side bearings being
    incorrect. Get the side bearings right first---for basic letter fit.\r\n\r\nKerning
    comes last to fix any spacing problems that can't be solved with side bearing
    settings. For example, the \"l-i\" combo is bad because the left side bearing
    on \"i\" is too wide. I can tell by looking at other combos with \"i\".\r\n\r\nThe
    fractured arm treatment on your \"a\" is interesting (I like it) but disturbing
    in context of all those other smooth glyphs. It would fit in in a gothicized roman.
    Smooth it into a curve, or fracture all the other glyphs with curved bowls to
    match. The fractured upper stroke of the \"a\" bowl can stay---it matches m, n,
    h, b. Consider fracturing the arm of \"r\" to match those.\r\n\r\nMy brain hurts
    too sometimes ;)\r\n\r\nbest regards,\r\nj a m e s"

    metrics at this point.\r\n\r\nTiff, what do you mean too round? and What faceting
    do you speak? I've got less than 2 months to be done with this,I'll try fracturing
    some of the other rounded letters.  \r\n\r\nI like the a as well, it was one of
    the more difficult letters for me, I may just round it out a bit.\r\n\r\nAnd what
    about the rest. Don't tease me. If I didn't apply it, it was simply a lack of
    know-how,experience,talent etc, because in terms of what I wanted to do, Architecturally
    inspired, I wanted a nice readable text face, but with a little sharper, more
    angular touch. I'm open to suggestions as to how to apply it.\r\n\r\nThanks amillion!\r\n\r\nEric"

  body: "<em>...faceting...</em> <em>...fracturing...</em>\r\n\r\nThese are different
    things. Fracturing involves breaking a stroke, usually inside and outside. Faceting
    is more akin to chiselling a concave or straight bevel onto a convex profile---like
    the underside of your \"a\". I've drawn sample facets onto r, a, d, b, u, q. Watch
    for different examples of the same letter. Have also shifted areas of weight around
    (most noticable on \"r\") to go with the cursive flow as indicated by arrows.\r\n\r\nShortening
    the \"q\" bowl is optional.\r\n\r\nFaceting the \"o\" is too tuff to simulate
    with pixels :)\r\n\r\nNot all changes are marked-up (Eric, please keep inline
    pics to 620 pixels or less. Check the FAQ. Sorry admins):\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/ewest.gif]\r\n\r\nFaceting
    on the outside of bowls:\r\n\r\n* creates more contrast between inside and outside
    shape---shape contrast\r\n* adds potent design and styling opportunities\r\n*
    adds micro-detailing\r\n\r\nThis treatment looks rough or \"ugly\" up close---not
    unlike many other highly-regarded text fonts. The gouge in the second \"r\" is
    the kind of small detail that goes unnoticed at normal reading speed, but helps
    readablility by adding randomness to the picture (or so we think). I would make
    3 or more different r's with differing details (vary not just the facet but also
    the terminal geometry and weight) and program them as random OT alternates.\r\n\r\nBMW's
    industrial designers used faceting on the rear of the new 1 series car. This is
    a strong styling motif in the rediscovery of sculpting in metal the company is
    applying to other models in their range, and which rival manufacturers will be
    mimicking right about now. The \"flame sculpting\" on the side of this car was
    also originated by BMW. Flame sculpting places a convex curve inside a concave
    curve---a bulge within a facet---for extra fun, or \"Vorsprung en technic\" as
    they say in Germany.\r\n\r\nLove!\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/BMW1.jpg]\r\n\r\nj

  body: "To fix your side bearings, open up a good commercial seriffed text font and
    study the side bearing settings. They generally conform to a consistent plan.
    Rounds all take similar values, relative to straights, which all fall into a consistent
    range. Diagonals are always very close or negative. Try to ignore distances from
    side bearings to serif tips---concentrate on the distance from the stroke. Distances
    from serif tips are more relevant with diagonal letters and bars like t, f, L,
    T, F, E etc.\r\n\r\nWhen you've figured this scheme out, copy it---the scheme,
    not actual values. Follow the scheme and adapt to suit your font.\r\n\r\nCertain
    letter combinations will always be problematic. Ignore. Set for good spacing overall.\r\n\r\nj

  body: "Eric, I think you need to seriously re-evaluate the whole deadline/timetable
    thing.\r\n\r\nType design takes years to master. While several MA programs have
    now been able to create a rigid, one year program, this cannot simply be ported
    over to an undergraduate degree program, especially when one is working alone\u2014which
    I suspect you are. Several European students do manage to do great first typefaces
    as degree projects, but most of these students are really getting combined undergrad/graduate
    degrees, and have both more time to work on the project, and more experience as
    well.\r\n\r\nTypefaces can perhaps be said to never be finished ;-)\r\nWhatever
    the case, I'm sure that you'll keep working on this after graduatation, especially
    if you want to bring it into distribution, which I hope you do.\r\n\r\nBut perhaps
    your presentation and exhibition should deal with the <em>process</em> behind
    designing your typeface, rather than the actual glyphs themselves. That would
    be easier to realize in a short timeframe, and would also be more of interest
    to the other students and attendees, I suspect. Lastly, even if you finish a knockout
    typeface in a month, will your professors be able to properly evaluate it? What
    I'm suggesting is not to set yourself up for heartbreak either way\u2026 rather,
    focus on explaining your great work."
