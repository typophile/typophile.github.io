    Use\t.non-mass production\r\n>Commercial Use\t.standard\r\n\r\nHow are mass production
    or standard commercial use defined?"

  body: "\"Under Commercial Use, \u201Cstandard\u201D includes any use aside from
    software \r\nembedding, !ETF-only specimens and consumer letter products.\" Specific
    \ real-life examples would be the Exclamachine-labeled !Sketchy Times stickers
    and another clothing project, based on !The Black Bloc, in negotiations now.\r\n\r\n\"Non-mass
    production\" includes hand-made works of craft or art, intended for resale. This
    is most similar to the \"Angel License\" popular in the growing scrapbooking market.
    Here's one example, the first typical one I googled: http://www.digitalscrapbookpages.com/digitals/index.php?main_page=product_info&cPath=66&products_id=3626"

    I might say something like \"non commercial\" and then perhaps define what you
    deem as \"commercial\". I find \"non mass production\" a little vague as well
    as leaving yourself open for other lawyers definitions. "

  body: The Hobby License does allow commercial use, in a sense. I want to keep it
    in common terms as much as possible, but the first post is copied and pasted from
    my semi-coded notes in excel. The actual full length text will replace this with
    specific examples, much like the design license linked above describes. When exclamachine.com
    goes back online, I will have a license comparison table, but I will probably
    describe the Commercial Use there as "Limited" with a footnote or similar.

    I actually started to put it into a real DTP program and thought, "Wait, this
    is going to be XHTML soon enough". Then we can all look at it in our limping collections
    of browser fonts.)

    this point, I feel that the first two are alright, but the last reads like a bit
    of a tangled mess.\r\n\r\nI am not looking for legal guidance here, so much as
    an impression that the names of each more or less jive with a font purchaser's
    expectations.\r\n\r\nIn my upcoming faces, embedding is set to print/preview/edit,
    allow subsetting. Does this jive with the consumer expectations? There was a thread
    on this, but search has failed me."

    all, that's 6 different major licenses, intended to meet the needs of students,

    from the Enterprise and Cobranding licenses are the changes to the warranty. Will
    do that next week."
