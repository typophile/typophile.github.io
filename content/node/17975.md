  it, in use:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.linotype.com/1559/umbra-family.html\r\n\r\nThe only
  time I've seen it used is on the back of the Tortoise and Bonnie Prince Billy album,
  The Brave and The Bold, for the track listing on the back.\r\n\r\nAlso, the recent
  Channel 4 logo redesign did a similar block-shadow-only thing:\r\n\r\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Channel_4\r\n\r\nAny
  other examples?"

    meant to space it.
