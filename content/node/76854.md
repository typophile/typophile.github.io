body: I was wondering, what agency did the design for the England's world cup campaign
  2018? I couldn't find any information about designers or agency on their website,
  so maybe someone here can help me out.

  body: Don't tell the Brits that, Hr. Shinn. They totally insist that the <em>eeee</em>vil
    FIFA blew them off because the BBC has been accusing them of corruption.

  body: "Well yes. (But it's nice to think typography can be deal-making.)\r\n\r\nAnd
    now any further expos\xE9 of FIFA corruption by the British media will be seen
    as sour grapes.\r\nSo Blatter can be thankful that he has been given the opportunity
    to do a little light house-cleaning (3-year suspensions) and defuse further criticism
    ... unless it comes from sources other than in the UK.\r\n\r\nIf England had won
    its bid, further criticism of FIFA by the British media might have been seen as
    churlish.\r\nBut that would have been unlikely to have reined them in."

    well-deserved shot at that dastardly Hun'. Not sure I want to be near that particular
    Brit, though, even though I've been a Liverpool supporter since 9 - and football
    didn't even interest me back then."
