body: "This happens in FL 5.0.3 for Mac:\r\n\r\nAbout half of the kerning is lost
  (mostly the pairs that are not classes) when having OT-classes also in the font.\r\n\r\nThe
  kerning looks OK in the metrics panel, but when generated or updating the kern feature
  it shows that all kerning is not present anymore.\r\n\r\nIf I take away the OT-classes,
  the whole kerning is back again when I generate \"kern\" feature.\r\n\r\nIn this
  case it was smcp1 + smcp2.\r\n\r\nCould anyone try and see if they have the same
  bug?\r\n\r\n"

  body: It seems as it <strong>only</strong> activate the "Class VS Class" kerning
    and not the Single glyph VS Class, or Class VS single glyph.

  body: OK, this is a major bug that makes it impossible to produce fonts. Strange
    that no one else has discovered it yet. No reply from FontLab either, maybe they
    are working to fix it.

    discovering the bug is to open an old font with classes and full kerning.\r\n\r\nThen
    make the kern feature visible and again do \"generate \"kern\" feature.\r\n\r\nIt
    takes away all kern pairs that are not class VS class.\r\nOSX 10.4.9\r\n\r\n"

  body: "I've had funnies with revisiting a font in FontLab 5.0.2 on a PC as well,
    but thought it was just me. Instead of losing pairs, I usually gain them -- but
    the new ones are unwanted & wrong. May just be something I do & not a bug.\r\n\r\nAnyway,
    my solution is to always save the features file, and put any new kerning in that
    file, read it back in & recompile. I put my classes in the feature file as well,
    so my starting point in a \"revisit\" situation is always a .vfb with no classes.\r\n\r\nIf
    I add kerning by using the FL metrics window (when revisiting), I write off an
    .AFM for pairs kerning, search & replace to get it into the proper syntax, & paste
    into the features file. For new classes or expanding existing classes, I just
    use the metrics window to determine the values. Then write these values into the
    features file \"kern\" feature in the appropriate places, read the features back
    into the .vfb, & recompile. Takes time, but seems to work. Just remember to say
    \"NO\" when the program tells you the \"features file & metrics window kerning
    don't agree, do you want to rebuild?\""

    in the class-panel? Could you please fix that bug to, it would be great.\r\n\r\nAnother
    nice thing you should put in the metrics window, is an integrated OT-feature window
    aswell. In that case, small caps could be kerned visually so much more easier?
    Just type a word and click \"small caps\" and the small caps can be kerned in
    the same window. Or any other feature aswell.\r\n\r\nThanks for a wonderful application
    otherwise! It is my best friend nowadays."
