  you have here.\r\n\r\nNow back to the topic. I'm designing a logotype for a company
  that produces and sells medical devices. We're gonna have a a new line now tho,
  and we're needing a logo for it. This line is called \"Pakline\" and it's purpose
  is to include several products into one pack (eg. Surgical procedure pack). The
  following are the logotypes we designed so far.\r\n\r\nAny critique would be appreciated,
  along with some ideas for new concepts.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/logopak_4465.png]\r\n\r\nThank
  you.\r\nPedro Peixoto"

  body: 'what is the "by" suppose to signify? I like #6 without the little "by" icon.
    I like the enclosure and interaction of Pakline and square and rectangle. If you
    made the solid green rectangle a tiny bit longer on the bottom you might a pretty
    nice "P" concept out of both open square and rectangle. '

    points up. Maybe the box all in green if you like that.'

  body: 'I personally like #10 both typographically and compositionally. But I think
    there is a stronger figure/ground relationship in #1 with the B and y. But that
    makes me question what that means exactly, like hola mentioned. '

  body: "Hello and thank you for your comments.\r\n\r\nBV is a registered label that
    has to be attached to this logo, so I can't cut it out. I've made some changes
    this morning, mostly towards the simplicity. Got two new examples to show and
    would appreciate further comments as always.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/logopakv2_4251.png]\r\n\r\nCheers.\r\n\r\n"

    got a problem now though, I really need to put the BV logo in it, but I've tried
    several positions but none of it works. Any ideas?\r\n\r\nCheers!"

    element of your design is simple, and feels clean/sterile in a way appropriate
    to hospital products.  Everything else feels tacked on.\r\n\r\n--\r\nNick Hladek"
