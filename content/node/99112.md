  body: "Thank you for (effectively) admitting to acquiring the fonts illegally.\r\n\r\nI
    have long thought that theft can sometimes be justified. Like stealing food for
    a starving family. But you don't go to the market to ask farmers where their fields
    are. And most of all, these are fonts - chances are you don't need them to survive,
    and you just want them to somehow get ahead. This is not OK, as (most) people
    make fonts at least in large part to get ahead themselves. So you're devaluing
    typefaces, our work, and I would ask you to stop.\r\n\r\nBut frankly, in this
    context for us to help you steal fonts is probably worse than you stealing them.
    So we should stop too. We can't change the world or human nature, but we can and
    should still fight for things, such as Typophile.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

      you really acquired the license of your first designing software when you were
      a student,many of you manage to pay their college fee, but there exist several
      who are not born in luxury cars who manage to learn stuff from internet but
      less fortunately has to end up with pirated softwares, there exist clients who
      pays you less for a design where the font cost supersedes the designer fee.
