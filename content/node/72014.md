  dancer Milca Mayerov\xE1 choreographed the alphabet as a photo-ballet. Each move
  in the dance is made to the visual counterpoint of Karel Teige's typographic music.
  Teige was a constructivist and a surrealist, a poet, collagist, photographer, typographer
  and architectural theorist, and his 1926 photomontage designs for the alphabet are
  a uniquely elegant and witty invention, and one of the enduring masterpieces of
  Czech modernism'. \r\n\r\nFrom the Guardian, 7.vii.2010"
