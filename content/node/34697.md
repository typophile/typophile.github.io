  in case:\r\n\r\nHas Raul Rosarivo's <em>Divina proporci\xF3n tipogr\xE1fica</em>
  been translated into English? I can only find it in Spanish and German. My German
  is so rusty I don't look forward to reading it.\r\n\r\nGeorge\r\nI felt bad because
  I had no shoes until I met a man who had no Bodoni"

  body: "Thanks to your post I found out about Ra\xFAl Rosarivo, so I am grateful
    for that, George.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, it seems that none of his books or articles
    can be found in English translation -- an Argentine designer, Fabi\xE1n Carreras,
    has what looks like <a href=\"http://fabiancarreras.com.ar/rmr/bibliografia.htm\"><strong>a
    very complete Rosarivo bibliography</strong></a> on his website.\r\n\r\nP.S. On
    Amazon, he only comes up as <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_ss_gw/103-3680925-5180609?url=search-alias%3Dstripbooks&field-keywords=raul+rosarivo&Go.x=11&Go.y=11&Go=Go\">mentioned
    in three books about type and design, and as the illustrator of a fourth one</a>."

  body: "There's a discussion of his work in Tschichold's <em>Form of the Book,</em>
    but Tschichold doesn't go into a lot of detail so I was interested in finding
    out more about his work on Gutenberg. Rosarivo is evidently the guy responsible
    for figuring out Gutenberg's page layout. Guess I'll have to try and sharpen up
    my Geman then.\r\n\r\nThanks for the bibliography reference.\r\n\r\nGeorge \r\nI
    felt bad because I had no shoes, until I met a man who had no Bodoni"

  body: "There is a bit of info (just a little bit), in English, <a href=\"http://www.citrinitas.com/history_of_viscom/press.html\">here</a>
    (as well as some gorgeous imagery!)...\r\n\r\nNext time I go to Buenos Aires,
    I will try to get a hold of the Rosarivo book... But I have a feeling it will
    be hard to find, unless I go to a university library.\r\n\r\nP.S. The Tschichold
    article that George mentions is reproduced <a href=\"http://learning.north.londonmet.ac.uk/epoc/tschichd.htm\">here</a>,
    by the way."
