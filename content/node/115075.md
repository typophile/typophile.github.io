  a content of OpenType font. OK, I know, that the Glyph Panel in InDesign is pretty
  comprehensive \u2014 I can filter the Small Caps, I can filter Oldstyle Figures,
  I can filter Ornaments, or even Ligatures , but I am looking for some way to get
  a summary like this:\r\n\r\nFontName.otf:\r\nThis font contains:\r\nExtended Latin
  A & B\r\nGreek \r\nDiscretionary Ligatures\r\nOldstyle Figures\r\nSmall Caps\r\n\u2026\r\n\r\nThank
  you."

  body: "It seems that's a 32-bit version and won't work on 64-bit systems.\r\nHowever,
    MS updated it around the time of Vista but they published the link for just the
    32-bit version because the 64-bit version didn't have an installer. [[http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_7-files/32-bit-extensions-for-64-bit-windows-font/1904ca19-d99a-497f-b8b8-56b6341ccc49|See
    here for details]], plus there's a Dropbox link for 64-bit near the bottom of
    the page. It's a .dll file; you put it in \u201CC:\\Windows\\System32\\\u201D
    folder, open command prompt as admin and type the following to activate it:\r\n\r\n%windir%\\System32\\regsvr32.exe
    %windir%\\System32\\TTFExtNT.dll"
