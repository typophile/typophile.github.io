  body: 'Hey, so is there a Rule that says the poser of the question can ignore other
    Rules at will?... <BR>Why exactly didn&#39;t Matha win? <BR> <BR>-- <BR> <BR>HD,
    are you sure about the Microtek business? Maybe it was the other way around, or
    maybe it was a recent thing? Back when I used to sell pre-press equipment &#40;don&#39;t
    ask...&#41; Agfa was a bastion of quality. Anyway, the reasons I like Agfa are
    that: they didn&#39;t engage in the total bullshit about resolution &#40;some
    companies would advertise like 14 million dpi while keeping the true optical resolution
    secret&#41;, and their software was ultra powerful from day one, unlike the dumbest-common-denominator
    &#34;user-friendly&#34; stuff out there. My lowly SnapScan &#40;which I got for
    like $50&#41; performs marvelously - you can tell it&#39;s serious when it forces
    an extensive warm-up/calibration after prolonged lack of use. <BR> <BR>BTW, I
    personally haven&#39;t met a single Epson product I&#39;ve liked - except maybe
    when they first came out with their high-end color inkjets. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>'

  body: 'I believe the correct interpretation of the rules in this case is as follows:
    <BR> <BR>The poser of the question is resposible for declaring the winner. Eduardo
    declared me the winner at 2:51 pm. So far so good. <BR> <BR>After the winner is
    declared, other parties have one hour in which to challenge the answer and/or
    declaration. Within this time frame, various people expressed the view that Matha
    should have been declared the winner. Although only Clint Eastwood&#39;s post
    constituted a definite challenge, I consider this a valid challenge <i>of the
    declaration</i>, i.e. not a challenge of the answer. <BR> <BR>However, since Matha
    has stated his own acceptance of the declaration, citing tiredness, I will use
    quizmaster privilege to award both Matha and myself a dual win, and quizmaster
    caprice to invite Hrant to pose the next question.'

    on the other hand she tried to pull off a sneaky message editing thingie; BJ was
    the first to get it exactly right &#40;although he might have been cannibalizing
    on Tiffany&#39;s attempt, but since he&#39;s a fellow Angeleno I can look the
    other way&#41; so technically he should win; but I certainly like H

    <BR>I didn&#39;t begin at the beginning. I wasn&#39;t online. <BR>I haven&#39;t

    wrong. <BR> <BR>So I looked at the question and thought, <BR>hey, I can google
    that. <BR> <BR>That&#39;s when I found the inscription and <BR>started to go through
    the alphabet. <BR> <BR>Tiffany was quicker! <BR> <BR>The order is alphabetical.

    as they were added. Frankly, I&#39;ve forgotten half of them, but that&#39;s okay
