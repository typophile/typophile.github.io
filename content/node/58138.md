body: " laid off so I am doing a web site for a non profit Rape Crisis Center.\r\n\r\n\r\nI
  am trying to either morph the R into a graphic \r\nuse some type of creativity,
  I just feel a bit stuck now.\r\n\r\nI am looking for good resources on the web also..\r\n\r\nOne
  of the problems is that this graphic has to be non gender\r\nand a bit subdued too
  I would think...\r\n\r\nSo far I have thought of rainbows, stairs, (hands may be
  not good so\r\nI thought links, chain, rope, as if someone is not touching but holding\r\non
  )\r\n\r\nSo the logo or graphic does not discriminate because this center\r\neven
  sees kids.\r\n\r\nI am trying to come up w/ something non threatening."
