body: "Hey there,\r\n\r\nI'm looking for a typeface that encapsulates the Film Noir
  genre, if thats even a possibility. Been researching and seems there's no real specific
  'thread' alot of Gothic's used and drop shadows. \r\n\r\nCan anyone identify this
  sample from the opening credits of House on Telegraph Hill?\r\n\r\nOr any  recommendations
  for modern interpretations that 'feel' Noir. Looking for something a little more
  off the beaten path of Pulp Fiction, Sin City. :)\r\n\r\nNeutraface is up for consideration,
  but perhaps a little too polished.\r\n\r\nThanks for your help.\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\nJason\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/X_Telegraph_6251.jpg]"

    should I say \"House that...\")"
