<div class="post-content e-content" itemprop=articleBody>Hey guys, I've noticed a beautiful little typeface that Tim Hortons has been featuring in all of their new advertising and I want to know what it is!
it reminds me of Optima, because it's a sans-serif that has a gentle flare at the ends, but it's too *fun* to be optima, which I onsider much more refined and formal.
Anyway, here's a link to their website, and it's featured in the flash banner on the mainpage.
http://www.timhortons.com/en/index.html
Thanks for your help, and if you were near me, I'd buy you a coffee! (At Timmy's of course)</div>

<div class=commentbody>I swear it looks like Poppl Laudatio Condensed Bold, Berthold, that has been ruined by outlines. The motion stuff moves too fast for these old eyes. I could be very wrong! The low slung cross on the t and the exaggerated terminal, swolen sans leads me to believe I am .... maybe right. He was one of the finest calligraphic/lettering artists and teachers of our time. See Berthold... Pontifex Laudatio Residenz Paladin(sp) etc. His most outstanding student, Werner Schneider... see Linotype Senatus Libretto etc.

<div class=commentbody>Aha! those 'old eyes' of yours have sniper-like precision!
it appears to be the first one you mentioned there, Laudatio, although it has been hurt by stretching and applying outlines.
I'm starting to gain some sensitivity towards typefaces and I know I've got a long road ahead of me, but it's discouraging when most designers my age just don't care about typography at all. What I wouldn't give to have your type sensitivity!
Thank you!</div>

<div class=commentbody>I have always loved Poppl's type and lettering. I started as a calligrapher and the "sensitivity" developed from that. Go and take a class from a REPUTABLE calligrapher and you will be on your way. Try and get in touch with Ruth Booth in Toronto! Check out both Poppl and Schneider on the sites I recommended. They are true "finessers" of letterforms.
Come to Buffalo for Typecon and I will bring some of their work. It will blow you away!

<div class=commentbody>Typecon in Buffalo eh? I have a sister living not too far from there (well, Olean NY) When is this Typecon and how much $ will it set me back?
Also, about calligraphy, I've always been a little handicapped towards ink writing as a lefty, I think I'd need special consideration from either a lefty calligrapher or a truly skilled one, which I haven't run across yet.
last year I knew a handful of typefaces by sight, and know of a lot more - this year when I go out I see typefaces first, then the words set in them on signs and menus.
I can only wonder with childish glee what this could develop into in 10 or 20 years :) I can't wait.</div>

<div class=commentbody>One of the most revered gentlemen of the Madison Avenue advertising lettering community was Bob Boyajian... a Southpaw no less. No handicap, just an opportunity to put your slant on things!!!!!!

<div class=commentbody>OK Tom, let me go out on a limb here. My daughters are your age. I remember them making the sign of LOSER years ago. You are holding your left hand up with the same gesture except away from the forehead. Is this a subconscious attempt to say LEFTY??? If so you are very subtle and you should have no problems with subtle letterforms cause that went past me on first glance! Or maybe I am over reaching.

<div class=commentbody>hahaha oh how incredibly observant! I was actually pointing at a nametag that's too small to see at that resolution, although to do so I didn't *have* to make that 'L' shape with my thumb. Maybe I'm advertising my leftishness more than I thought (on a subconcious level)
Now, when we got to drawing class in college it made me so delighted when all the right-handers were complaining about getting the sides of their hands dirty from drawing with graphite sticks. This is the burden lefties have to bear from grade 1.
Actually, you might find this amusing, we used to call graphite or charcoal stains on our hands and wrists the ‘GD tan’ because only us in graphic design could get it. (and we didn't have real tans because we were inside doing work)
I know an old designer, a family friend (probably influenced me more than I know) and he wa taught lettering when he studied ‘commercial arts’ back in the day. I wonder if he'd like to help me out a bit with writing…</div>
