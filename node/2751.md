  codename is Revista and her purpose is to be the &#34;corporate face&#34; for my
  studio. No figures, no punctuation, and not kerning yet &#40;Illustrator phase&#41;.
  <BR>Let me read your suggestions! <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/24402.gif"

  body: I like the squared dots on i and j.  The A and X seem to fall below the baseline,
    and the Q seems a bit off balanced - it feels like it&#39;s leaning left, like
    the tail is pushing it over.  I don&#39;t know if the w quite works; I&#39;d have
    to see it in running text. <BR> <BR>Very nice face here, Santiago.

  body: 'This is nice. Generally I like the straight lines in the terminals. The exit
    on the a reminds me of Renaissance serifs, but the overall feel is kind of a friendly
    Realist type. <BR>Specifically:  I like the two storey a better than the single
    one. It looks like the B is leaning bacwards just a tiny bit. Ww is cool. g is
    neat but maybe its ear could be bigger? <BR> <BR>Looking forward to more. <BR>

  body: Good point on the g ear, Jon.  It definitely needs to be a bit more defined
    - it looks weak at small sizes.  I just noticed that the lc e seems to be tipsy
    - I can&#39;t figure out whether it is tilting forward or backward.  It may be
    that you have attained a perfect equilibrium with it, but there seems to be almost
    a tension, and maybe that&#39;s what you were hoping for.  I don&#39;t see the
    B leaning backwards, but Jon may well have more refined eye on that one.

  body: Thank you Van and Jon. I see the problem on the &#34;g&#34; ear, and will
    fix it. <BR>I will repost a bigger image &#40;a PDF or SWF&#41; to look at details
    on &#34;e&#34; and the others. <BR>I was playing with tension on &#34;e&#34;,
    but I&#39;m not sure if it works in this face or is just out of place. <BR>

  body: 'What&#39;s going on at the bottom of the &#34;M&#34;? Is the baseline angled
    like the&#34;A&#34;? I also see the &#34;f&#34; tipping over clockwise. Maybe
    tighten it up on the right and extend it a hair on the left. What do you think
    about making the &#34;a&#34; counter slightly bigger? It might just be the resolution,
    but those square dots look too big. Last, the &#34;C&#34; and &#34;c&#34; look
    too light. '

  body: I&#39;m with Daniel on the square dots. And the lc <b>a</b> could use a bigger
    bowl with more counter. The angled terminal on the A, and the foot of the R definitely
    suggest the same for the M. The uc S I like a lot, especially the taper at the
    ends. It looks like it may be tipping backwards ever so slightly &#40;though I&#39;m
    beginning to think it&#39;s me that is&#41;. The g is better too. <BR> <BR>Jon

  body: I will post a few .gifs showing details on &#34;A&#34;, &#34;R&#34;, and &#34;M&#34;
    baselines. &#34;M&#34; has angled strokes like &#34;A&#34; and &#34;R&#34;. <BR>About
    &#34;a&#34;, I will post a sample of its evolution, it had a bigger counter before...
    I&#39;m happier with the last one. <BR>Does everybody feel the &#34;g&#34; is
    out of place here? <BR>Thanks for the feedback!

  body: Santiago, I for one like the binocular &#39;g&#39;. If you think that the
    sharp angle is a problem or you are unsure you could try reducing the angle of
    the stroke to match the tail of the &#39;y&#39;, or curve the corner which could
    be interesting. <BR> <BR>I like the binocular &#39;a&#39; and &#39;g&#39; in an
    alphabet like this. <BR> <BR>Looking forward to seeing the evolution of the &#39;a&#39;
    and also the deatils of the baselines of the others. <BR> <BR>Jon

  body: Cool. Nice pics. After seeing your evolution of the &#39;a&#39; I&#39;m inclined
    to agree that it&#39;s the nicest for your face. I&#39;m still stuck thinking
    that the bowl could be just a slight bit larger top to bottom, but choosing to
    stay with this would not be wrong in any way. <BR> <BR>I like the canted shoulders
    of the M. I think that the base line could stand some more angle. The E is great,
    I like the finish on the top arm. <BR> <BR>Jon

  body: This is pretty solid. I like it. The M looks good I think, but I&#39;d be
    interested to see if it gets stronger if you flatten the bottom. Of course, this
    is the opposite of what Jon says, and counters your strategy of angled baselines
    for angled legs. The &#34;a&#34; evolution has given you a better character, but
    the counter looks smaller. I&#39;d like to see it among other letters. Cool.

  body: I&#39;m sure you can make the binocular &#34;g&#34; work in this design. <BR>Make
    the ear stronger and the head/bottom connection more traditional. <BR> <BR>hhp

  body: 'Some suggestions after macro viewing <BR> <BR>R: Leg needs more weight and
    a hair more length <BR>M: Try a traditional stroke modulation. Right now you have
    thick, thin, thin, thick. The traditional goes thin, thick, thin, thick. It can
    be minute modulation, but I think it will improve. <BR>E: Hard to tell about the
    arms, they look like they might not be exactly horizontal based on the anti aliasing.
    The top arm may be a bit light. <BR>g: Maybe less angle in the waist? <BR> <BR>Randy
