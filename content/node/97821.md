  on some product design.\r\n\r\nI have came across a few that seem to do the job;\r\nSNC
  Script\r\nILS Script\r\nAlS Script\r\nFLW Script\r\n\r\nI've been trying to validate
  whether these are legitimate to use commercially and was wondering if anyone could
  help me verify this.\r\n\r\nupon general internet searches the typefaces come up
  on many free font sites as belonging to\r\nhttp://www.digitalgraphiclabs.com/default.html\r\nwere
  they say they have been released as free for commercial use as part of a pack of
  \ typefaces\r\n\r\nmany thanks for your help\r\nsteven"

    Script is <a href=\"http://www.identifont.com/show?36G\">Shelley Script Andante</a>
    by Matthew Carter. ILS Script looks like a butchered <a href=\"http://www.identifont.com/show?39T\">Shelley
    Script Volante</a>. And I absolutely don\u2019t recommend to use FLW Script. "

    They tried being a foundry back in the 90's but failed at that so made their \"retail
    package\" free and quit making new fonts.\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: "@majus\r\n\r\nthanks for the reply :)\r\n\r\nlooking at the use full comparisons
    \ renko managed to find;\r\n\r\n'SNC Script is officially known as Nuptial Script.
    AIS Script is Shelley Script Andante by Matthew Carter.'\r\n\r\nmany of the DGL
    fonts look almost identical to other established scripts, I haven't studied each
    letter in detail yet but, is their enough, if any differences to make them not
    overlap the other people licenses ? I have heard of many cases of people just
    changing the copyrights and inserting their own. \r\n\r\nAny further help would
    be  much appreciated. I two am not a fan of finding 'free'  pieces as indeed they
    are often not well done, bar  the very few exeptions. Being used to working with
    fonts purchased from more recognised foundries - were the licensing isn't something
    I have had to worry about much in the past. Thus my knowledge of such is very
    much lacking in this area. \r\n\r\nHowever as the client here is a rather low
    budget operation  I said I would see if their  was anything I could find for them.
    Although it is looking like I must use the powers of persuasion to get them to
    go for something better :)\r\n\r\nthanks again\r\n\r\n"

    into my computers font library for it would make a rather vile mess lol, however
    it is a subject that I would find use full to know more of the finer points about.\r\n\r\non
    a site I found a similar topic and someone posted the following;\r\n\r\n''The
    actual files of a font are protected by copyright, and using those files in a
    way not allowed by the license is illegal. The shapes of the letters in a font,
    however, are not protected and there have been many businesses over the years
    that made money copying popular fonts. Mind you, the quality of the copied fonts
    was generally pretty low...''\r\n\r\ndoes anyone know if this  statement is accurate.\r\n\r\nthanks
    again :)"

  body: so forgive my stupidity,   would  the protection depend on which country the
    font was originally created in, or which country you are intending to use/replicate
    the font from.
