    specified\r\n<cite>font-family: Georgia, \"Times New Roman\", Times, serif;</cite>\r\nfor
    some parts and\r\n<cite>font-family: Verdana;</cite> and <cite>font-family: \"Arial
    Black\";</cite>\r\nfor others.\r\nAdditionally, there is <cite>font face=\"Tahoma\"</cite>
    in the page\u2019s HTML.\r\n\r\nStill, that doesn\u2019t tell me what <strong>you</strong>
    are seeing; a sample would help. I for one see a lot of Verdana and some Helvetica,
    having not installed Tahoma and Arial Black."
