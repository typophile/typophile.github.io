body: "This is a logo I'm working on for a speaker / preacher. He tours quite a bit,
  speaking at different churches. The idea of the name 'Front & Center' comes from
  the verse Colossians 1:18 where it speaks of giving Christ preeminence.\r\n\r\nSome
  verbs that the client came up with to characterize the ministry are: teaching; refreshing;
  liberating; gracious; clear; thought provoking; insightful; practical; reforming;
  inclusive\r\n\r\nI would appreciate crits.\r\n\r\n[Please note, this isn't 5 different
  options, they are 5 different applications of the same design. Please give feedback
  on the overall design, not which one you like best. Thanks ! ]\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/FCM_LOGO_COMP_5803.jpg]"

  body: "I'm getting a strong vibe that this brief has great potential; and frankly
    this stuff isn't it. If you manage to wrap your brain around this thing and go
    deep, you'll end up with something you can flaunt in your portfolio for many years.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "Hello,\r\n\r\nWhy not use 1 application for the design for the sake of consistency
    and recognition?\r\n\r\nYou could search a fitting object who resambles those
    values.\r\nYou could simplify the diamond.\r\n\r\nGr, JB"

  body: The symbol seems pretty abstract. Also I don't care for the dinky little ampersand;
    it makes a weak central element and will disappear if the logo is reproduced small.
