  with optical equal strokes. Any suggestions?\r\nDessau Pro Plakat is the closest,
  but I don't like the A's and W's.\r\nNeutra no.2 suffer with the same M & W's, and
  got a to thin inline.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.fontshop.com/fonts/singles/fountain/dessau_pro_plakat/\r\nhttp://www.houseind.com/fonts/neutrano2/viewfonts\r\n\r\nAny
