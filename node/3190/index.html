		<div class="commentbody">I suspect that Frutiger has been the single most influential typeface in the past thirty years. It established a pattern of opening the counters of the round letters c, e, etc., which has been widely followed, including by de Groot's Thesis. You can see it in many, many other sans, including Myriad - which is more humanist than Frutiger, though. [Helvetica etc are the most closed by comparison, and the tide has been running against them.]  <BR> <BR>I recently ran across <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/Search?searchtext=adsans" target="_blank">Adsans</a> of Walter Tracy, which opens the counters in a similar way, and is a decade older. I don't think it is artistically as successful, but it is a similar idea. I would be interested in the history of this opening of counters - which is a theme in Bringhurst - if anyone knows more about it. <BR> <BR>Thesis TheSans, compared to Frutiger, not only opens up the c and e more, but straightens the arms, and alters the shapes of the pdq to match; the hmn look narrower, it has a binocular g, etc. I don't think it is that close to Frutiger, compared to many others who also show Frutiger's (or is it Adsans?) heritage.    <BR> <BR></div>

Along the geometric/grotesk/humanist classification. I don't have time to hunt for the post right now, but I don't think I'd disagree with that idea. <BR> <BR>&gt;I don't think it is that close to Frutiger <BR> <BR>I'd agree with William. I think faces like Prima &amp; Myriad are much closer in spirit to Frutiger. IMHO, TheSans is much closer to a 'humanist' sans. Cf. the p, q, b, g, and the italics. Freakin' love that bloody Q.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Matthew, I think you're right. ITC Johnston Underground is not as open as Gill, and I think Frutiger still more open, but the humanist proportions are what does it, and Johnston and Gill I believe started this. As Bringhurst explains, it seems that Frutiger's idea was to bring some humanist features to a more geometrical face. The openness (compared to his 'Universe') also was probably influenced by his task of making very legible signage that could be seen at a distance a Charles DeGaulle Airport.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Yeah, myriad is very close to frutiger, but still, a lot of the plain letters of TheSans resemble frutiger. TheSans's italics are fantastic and blow frutiger out of the water. <BR> <BR>I'm not defending frutiger at all, in fact, I quite dislike it. But though there are a lot of glyphs that don't follow frutiger, I think there are some that do. I'm actually debating my former professor on this. He thinks TheSans is a frutiger knock-off, I think he's crazy. I'm trying to play his side (though it's a weak leg to stand on). <BR> <BR>This is awesome input for me. I appreciate it. <BR> <BR>Hrant, how is de Groot's stuff of a different school? As in, it's more fluid, post-modern, rounded, etc? I'm just an observer. Tell me how you <i>feel</i>.</div>
