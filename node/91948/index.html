		<div class="commentbody"><p>I tried it with hyphenation first.  It would have been more efficient per line and required a larger type to end on the same word as Gutenberg&rsquo;s, and I didn&rsquo;t like it as much at that larger size.  If I had had access to the full text of it as-hyphenated, I probably would have tried harder to make that work, but as I said, I was actually quite surprised and disappointed to find out that one of the most famous books ever written doesn&rsquo;t have a text-only version anywhere I could find.  I can find the Vulgate generally, but not the Gutenberg text as-written and as-hyphenated.  Transcribing it myself wasn&rsquo;t an option, as my Latin isn&rsquo;t strong enough (understatement), nor my ability to parse some of the more peculiar features of 15th century blackletter, particularly abbreviations.</p>
<p>I certainly wasn&rsquo;t trying to correct (or even improve!) on Gutenberg.  I merely wanted to turn it into a historically anachronistic version.</p>
<p>I was more happy with the Vogue Paris cover, but it risks seeming political, which wasn&rsquo;t my intent.</p>

<p>I must admit it&rsquo;s &hellip; unsettling, perhaps &hellip; to see iconic, or at least immediately recognizable, text in what &ldquo;obviously&rdquo; is the wrong font. Perhaps it&rsquo;s only &ldquo;obviously wrong&rdquo; because this does not concern <em>just</em> the font, but the image-as-a-whole.</p>
<p>Imagine the Vogue cover, for example, not in full color but in black-and-white. (And also slightly different make up &amp; hair-do for the lady.) That will make it look like a period cover &ndash; and we all know what period I mean as well. But instead we see it in a clearly <em>modern</em> context, with bar code and all.</p>

		<div class="commentbody">Of course. All present-day versions of 1850s types are changed from their originals.
That’s why I put quote marks around my font attribution.
But within the context of all the other reworkings, the Darwin exercise is quite different, involving no anachronism in type style, only the means of reproduction.
The typeface of the reset Darwin title page would not have looked alien in 1859, other than by deviating from the convention that such types would not be used for title pages, only in ads such as <a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/49539664621259744/">this</a>.</div>
