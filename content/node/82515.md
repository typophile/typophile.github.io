  background details. Suffice it to say that I setting a brochure in TypeTogether's
  lovely <a href=\"http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/type-together/adelle/\">Adelle</a>
  and am looking for a good sans-serif companion to use in headings. Do you have any
  helpful suggestions? I'd prefer a typeface with some kind of lighter weights (like
  thin, extra-light, display, etc.) but that's not a deal-breaker. Really, I just
  need something that will act as a good complement to the graceful slab-serifs of
  Adelle. So far, I have these in consideration:\r\n\r\n<ul><li>Gibson (Canada Type),
  <a href=\"http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/canadatype/gibson/\">http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/canadatype/gibson/</a></li>\r\n<li>Depot
  New (moretype), <a href=\"http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/moretype/depot-new/\">http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/moretype/depot-new/</a></li></ul>\r\n\r\nI'd
  possibly consider <a href=\"http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/fontfont/milo/\">FF Milo</a>
  or <a href=\"http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/fontfont/kievit/\">FF Kievit</a>, but
  I'm not convinced that their overall designs are similar enough to the style of
  Adelle to be good complements.\r\n\r\nThanks for your time!\r\nEvan\r\n"
