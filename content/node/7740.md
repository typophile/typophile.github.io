body: "one of the most noteworthy font releases of this year has got to be [[ff legato|legato]]
  by [[evert bloemsma]]. being a curious sort, i had a peek at the outlines. i was
  surprised that rather a lot of points are being used to describe the curves.\r\n\r\nthe
  green i is the legato outlines, the orange i is what i would have *expected* to
  see (ie minimum number of points)\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/53823_6180.gif]\r\n\r\n\r\ni
  wonder if additional points are being added at the 'font development/output stage'
  (ie. after the glyph has been drawn). if that's the case, why exactly? is it something
  to do with format conversion?\r\n\r\ntypophile input welcomed.\r\n\r\ncheers\r\n\r\ngeraint"

    how does a rounding error manifest itself: are points being added during conversion,

    target="_blank">http://www.fontmaster.nl/</a> <BR> <BR>Use the DataMaster and
    convert a clean outline Type 1 font into the IK or BE Format. But use 15.000 em
    as destination grid. And then back to Type 1 and compare the outlines. In most
    cases you will have more unnecessary points and perhaps a slide change in the
    design.

    The pattern of extra nodes is characteristic: more nodes on long, shallow curves,

    beziers, and comparing the result to the FH conversion.'

    programs are ruining your outlines. <BR> <BR>-- <BR> <BR>The issue of rigidity,
    especially in offset, is quite interesting to me. I agree that gentle curves have
    a lot of potential, and I think this is two-pronged: they fight optical distortion
    &#40;like a &#34;perfect&#34; rectangle looks fatter in the middle&#41;; and they
    add a certain feeling, even &#40;especially?&#41; when they&#39;re so subtle as
    to escape <i>conscious</i> perception. <BR> <BR>The problem I have with curves
    -and the reason I see a positive role for rigidity- is that they convey a style
    that might not be suitable to the given typography. One area is news. You don&#39;t
    want a feminine, ambiguous, suggestive voice giving you updates about Ukraine
    for example - you want some neutrality so you can make up your own mind, without
    a designer &#34;helping&#34; you think, or at least not helping you <i>feel</i>.
    <BR> <BR>It&#39;s no secret that I admire your work. But it&#39;s also quite feminine;
    and it&#39;s interesting to note that Avance -perhaps because it has serifs- seems
    sort of androgenous, which is why I think it was an incredibly good choice for
    the book &#34;John Kelly&#34;! <BR> <BR>-- <BR> <BR>As for the perceived advantages
    of letterpress, I actually think they&#39;re real, but have struggled to figure
    out why they exist. It can&#39;t be because of depth/tactility. And even digital
    fonts &#40;like Evert&#39;s&#41; can be &#34;soft&#34;. The only thing I can think
    of is that the boundary between black and white is more gradual. Solution? I can
    only think of two: <BR>1&#41; Photopolymer letterpress. <BR>2&#41; Microscopically
    de-focus the laser in an imagesetter! :-&#41;  Note that this is not the same
    thing as putting down gray dots, or using lower resolution; it would simply make
    the notan ever so slightly softer. <BR> <BR>hhp'

  body: I don&#39;t understand the concept of masculine/feminine here? Curves are
    not defining to femininity. Curves are just elements of form.  There are few typefaces
    which limit themselves by gender.  Legato certainly does not. Legato is a strong
    yet neutral type which has strong character yet does not interfere with the meaning
    of the text it is set in. I am just an observer who pretends to know nothing about
    what was intended in the design of the face.  My reaction is purely from what
    I see as an individual. I have not read about Legato or ever spoken with Mr. Bloemsma
    so what I say is just one man&#39;s interpretation. What I see is a face which
    gets its life by tension.  The counters seem to be ever-so-subtly moved off axis
    from their surrounding form, just enough to cause a tension but not so much to
    make it look like an error. The tension locks the two forms &#40;form and counter&#41;
    into life.  This is like the Keats poem, &#34;Ode on a Grecian Urn&#34; where
    the two lovers are locked for eternity just short of kissing--&#34;bold lover,
    never, never, shalt thou kiss&#34;. <BR>It may be that Gill attemted this in his
    Gill Sans but his lacks the tension present in Legato.  It appears to me that
    Gill was just trying to overcome weight and contrast problems when moving to bolder
    weights--where Evert is successfully using the tension for its own sake. <BR>

    <BR> <BR>&#62; leaving away the strokes <BR> <BR>That&#39;s all fine and dandy,
    but what you&#39;ve done with Legato is much deeper, in my mind coming the closest
    so far to the true essence of typography. <BR> <BR>To me the only real problem
    with Legato is that it&#39;s too constructed, too Modernist. I think one has to
    relinquish some control to make something that truly works with the human reality.
    This is what the Post-Modernists had a feeling for, but too many of them were
    more interested in simply discrediting Modernism, like misbehaving children. <BR>
    <BR>BTW, I like Avance! In fact it has one strong functional advantage over Legato:
    serifs. <BR> <BR>&#62; we certainly do not observe just with our <BR>&#62; eyes

    rough paper which is not too white. <BR> <BR>This might be related to my idea
    about limiting contrast. I think not-too-white paper does indeed help offset,

    <BR>&#62; Curves are not defining to femininity. <BR> <BR>I guess all I can do
    is disagree. <BR> <BR>Nothing is just a shape - everything has meaning, and not
    just through social conditioning either. Red alludes to blood. An inverted triangle
    grabs attention because of the nature of gravity. We are completely surrounded
    by snippets of physical realities such as these, and good design requires an appreciation
    of them. <BR> <BR>-- <BR> <BR>Legato is a landmark design because it finally gives
    the importance of the white more than lip service - it creates notan, as opposed
    to merely a sequence of pretty blacks. People like G Noordzij go on and on about
    creating the white as well as the black, but they essentially ignore that chirography
    is inescapably anti-notan. <BR> <BR>The difference between designing Black versus
    designing notan is the difference between Art and Craft, between wanting to make
    versus wanting to serve. Smeijers says that Design starts with the desire to create.

    if you&#39;re keeping your eye on the White while doing it&#41; because it ties
    the two edges &#40;outlines&#41; of the black body. By doing this it makes the
    White a byproduct, and this reduces bouma cohesion, hence readability. We are
    extremely lucky to be able to design individual outlines &#40;as opposed to bodies&#41;
    directly, since it&#39;s this border than defines notan. Sadly, Evert is the only
    person I know who has used this freedom to good effect so far. Hopefully though
    the floodgates will soon open, and chirography &#40;at least in the realm of text&#41;
    will be seen as the relic, the romantic inhibitor, that it is. <BR> <BR>Also:
    I don&#39;t think Legato&#39;s particular &#34;stress angle&#34; is very relevant&#42;,
    and neither is vertical versus horizontal pattern&#42;&#42;. To me the key to
    Legato is that it &#34;breaks&#34; the Black and connects the White, balancing
    their relationship&#42;&#42;&#42;, thus creating better boumas. When Evert makes
    a serif font on this principle then we&#39;ll really see a new chapter in readability.
    <BR> <BR>&#42; Even though some people, like Jan Middendorp, have gleefully exclaimed
    &#34;Look, the pen, look!&#34; But it&#39;s not there. Just like Gary Much once
    saw the pen in my Paphos &#34;j&#34;, but I can assure you it&#39;s not there.
    <BR> <BR>&#42;&#42; Note: not &#34;rhythm&#34;, because there is no flow. <BR>
    <BR>&#42;&#42;&#42; You could say making it a healthy marriage, not an owner&amp;slave
    relationship. <BR> <BR>-- <BR> <BR>&#62; .... visible as on the photo.  <BR> <BR>That&#39;s
    too much impression - bad for readability. <BR>The degree of pressing that I think
    helps readability is <i>subvisible</i>. <BR> <BR>Notan is indeed a Japanese term
    &#40;there is no equivalent in Western lanaguages that I know of - and I think
    this is itself telling&#41;, but ironically the letter-making crafts in the Orient
    are even more Black-centric than in the West! On the other hand, cross-character
    relationships are a lot less important in Chinese for example than in Latin. <BR>
    <BR>&#62; In the same way offset will never be able <BR>&#62; to replace all the
    aspects of letterpress <BR> <BR>I agree, but my personal concern is to replicate
    what <i>is</i> possible, and to me the readability advantage of letterpress is.
    Running your hands over the bumps &#40;which should be barely tactile however,
    not impressed up the wazoo&#41; is not replicable - although that doesn&#39;t
    make me very sad. <BR> <BR>Also, don&#39;t forget photopolymer letterpress, which
    allows digital type to replicate the whole deal. Unless you think irregularity
    &#40;I mean the true kind, different than intentional variance&#41; is anything
    more than bad craft. <BR> <BR>&#62; you could also try the effect of random irregularity
    <BR> <BR>No, that&#39;s not the type of thing I&#39;m talking about. That is indeed
    fake. <BR>Like Johnny von Neuman said, real irregularity can never be intentional
    anyway. <BR> <BR>&#62; the unsharpness of the phototype era <BR>&#62; is the dark
    age of typography to me. <BR> <BR>Me too, but I&#39;m speculating that that&#39;s
    what we&#39;re taught these days: the &#34;outstanding&#34; feature of phototype
    was blur, so that&#39;s what is remembered. But maybe there was a period towards
    the end that -were it not for the lousy fonts generally used- the effect was closer
    to letterpress than we&#39;re at now. I admit it&#39;s speculation though. <BR>

    <BR> <BR>I&#39;m not sure that a letter needs to be made with a pen in order for
    the pen to &#39;be there&#39;. During my short talk in Prague, I focused on role
    of ductus in glyph identity, as against a conception of letter identity as a kind
    of skeleton on which the meat of the individuated glyph is hung. Of course, ductus
    shifts and changes, across historical periods and styles, and in the hands of
    individual designers, but within a particular style of lettering there is only
    so far from the expected patterns resulting from ductus that one can go before
    the letters start to look freakish. So when one &#39;sees the pen&#39; in Legato,
    one is acknowledging the ductus in the identity of the letters, which is not mechanically
    consistent angle and weight, but is significant enough to establish a common relationship
    between the letters. Yes, Evert has manipulated the ductus -- most type designers
    do, in fact: Gerrit Noorzij might be unique in claiming that his type designs
    are as he writes them -- but nothing in Legato looks freakish. The idea of ductus
    fascinates me, because it is something that originates in tools, but which has
    become an idea in our comprehension of letterforms, and now exists to a large
    degree independent of tools. We observe ductus -- we see the artifact of the tool
    -- where the tool has not been.'

  body: '<i>The moving front is anti-notan.</i> <BR> <BR>So you keep saying, but this
    implies that notan cannot be achieved except by treating the boundary between
    black and white as an independent path. In other words, drawing outlines is the
    only sound approach to type design. Now who is being ideological? The problem
    with this view is that the vast majority of notan in the world is not created
    by drawing outlines, but with brushes and pens, and the whole notion of notan
    develops in arts of painting and calligraphy in which it is understood that black
    and white can be balanced or, for that matter, deliberately imbalanced, by the
    use of such tools. <BR> <BR>Most type designers are pragmatists: they&#39;ll use
    whatever methods, tools, and tricks they can. Watching Tim Holloway drawing Arabic
    letters was a thrill: the tools and tricks of the Walter Tracy&#39;s drawing office
    pulled out in the lounge of a London hotel: two pencils with shaved sides taped
    together to sketch initial forms, and <i>then</i> the outline drawn, following
    the sketched ductus sometimes and diverging where Tim felt it should, and then
    the thick black chisel marker to ink the form. Was it chirographic? Was it &#39;synthetic&#39;?
    Or was it something in-between? To me, it was just type design, as practised by
    one person who I happen to think is one of the most brilliant designers I have
    met. <BR> <BR><i>...manipulate notan, directly...</i> <BR> <BR>Presumably, this
    is what I do almost all the time, since I design from scratch with digital outlines,
    and manipulate them until I am satisfied with the shape, weight and consistency
    of the letter. So I think you must be talking about something other than method,
    which makes me suspect that your crusade against chirography is misdirected. It
    seems to me that what you really want to focus on is <i>analysis of notan,</i>
    not how notan is made. As Gary Munch said to you on the ATypI discussion list,
    an experienced calligrapher isn&#39;t significantly limited in the kind of forms
    he can make with the various tools at his disposal. His point regarding your Paphos
    <i>j,</i> wasn&#39;t that he thought you had made it with a pen, but that <i>he
    could have made it with a pen.</i> So I tend to consider the method of creating
    the form from a purely pragmatic perspective -- not least because I&#39;m a jobbing
    craftsman with deadlines --: what is the most effective way to arrive at the form?
    The question of what that form should be, what makes it more or less readable:
    these are much more interesting questions, regardless of how one goes about making
    the form.'

    and they&#39;re strongly related. As I said, it is to promote better notan that
    chirography needs to be demoted. Few people &#40;mostly outside the craft, like
    Kevin&#41; think notan is limited to individual letters; overcoming that is the
    first step, but then you have to see the damage done by the moving front &#40;to
    reading&#41;. <BR> <BR>&#62; What do we do differently? <BR> <BR>All kinds of

    chiro fonts. <BR>I don&#39;t see this at all. <BR>I think: <BR>Zapf for example
    <BR>has made much more <BR>explicitly <BR>chiro fonts - <BR>and so has Meier;
    <BR>some things in his fonts <BR>are consciously <BR>anti-chirographic <BR>as
    far as I can tell, <BR>like the top terminal of the <BR>&#34;a&#34; in Ruse. <BR>

  body: 'i guess it makes sense that [[Evert Bloemsma]]''s site is not longer online,
    i tried to glean some of the information there about [[FF Legato]], but apparently
    none of the file assets (images, pdfs, &c.) are chached by <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20050227214903/www.evertbloemsma.nl/legato/about_legato/about_legato.asp">web.archive.org</a>.  Any
    suggestions on getting some of this information back. Does anyone know if FontShop
    has a copy (or does anyone have a local copy) of the pdf: about_ff_legato.pdf?
    hrant, do you have this? any help would be appreciated. it would be a tragic loss
    if this information is not preserved by the best means possible.'

    nice to contact his family... I just would like to have the information, including
    images, to put into the wiki if it is not going to be available anywhere else
    online. I've already integrated what text i could glean from the web archive,
    but the text refers to images that are missing. If this is inappropriate, i will
    roll the entry back to a previous time."
