    have had time to post, etc. etc. \r\n\r\nI think he just doesn't have anything
    to say. "

  body: "I've been discovered! *runs away*\r\n\r\nActually, if you're really asking
    I'm a student (20) of John Langdon's http://www.johnlangdon.net at Drexel University.
    Majoring in Graphic Design. I've become a huge fan of typography since taking
    John's classes, have been working with him on his comissioned ambigrams and just
    meeting with him individually to talk type. He invited me to TypeCon this past
    summer and I went (as a volunteer), where I ended up meeting Yves, who's blog
    http://www.typographer.org I've been reading for a while...Yves reccomended that
    I join this forum and so I did! Yves and I were eating lunch and spent a large
    portion of the day together before I realized who he was. I'm looking forward
    to TypeCon next year in Boston, very close to home for me! Anyways yeah, I've
    just developed a passion for type and love the extent of knowledge in this community!
    Another budding designer, really! Design is pretty much the #1 passion of my life
    right now so I spend too much time here. :o)"
