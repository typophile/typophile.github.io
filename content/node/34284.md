  in print and also in webdesign. I'm planning on using Sifr for webpage headings
  (flashfile that replaces fonts). I want the type to be as easy on the eyes as possible.\r\n\r\nFrom
  what I found on the net, webfaces should have lots of white in the characters. That's
  \ why my first thought was the Nexus family. But I'm not sure yet.\r\n\r\nAnybody
  got some better suggestions plz?\r\n\r\nmany thnx\r\n\r\n\r\nYves Peeters\r\n\r\nps.
  I'm bored of seeing Din and Meta so they are no option ^_^\r\n"

    \r\n\r\nIf possible it should also have Serif, sans-serif, nice ligatures, medieval

    starters, it doesn't work sometimes. Look at this site, for example...I can't
    view most of the topic titles. Now, maybe that's typophile's fault and not sIFR's.
    ;o)\r\n\r\nBut, that said, at home I use FlashBlock a lot. As I dislike most flash
    (or rather, the way most flash is implemented) so sIFR doesn't work for me.\r\n\r\nIt's
    not BAD, but it's just yet-another-variable to go wrong in getting the information
    to your end users."

    system just get the content. That's a nice way of designing imo ^_^\r\n\r\nps

    no, you can't see either. Same with typophile. I don't use flashblock here, but
    for some reason 9 out of 10 sIFR titles just don't show up for me.\r\n\r\n\"eople
    with a lower system just get the content. That\u2019s a nice way of designing

    flaws for some folks.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    worked with the developers of the Firefox FlashBlock extension to make sure sIFR
    text is automatically degraded to (X)HTML for users of recent versions of FlashBlock.
    When users install FlashBlock, they are demonstrating a bias against Flash (most
    likely because of the incredible amount of obnoxious and invasive advertising
    on the web these days) and we want to respect this bias. "

    affect higher resolution output, especially for controlling undershoots and overshoots
    for instance. The effects of hinting however, if done well should not be noticable
    on the printer, but will have a noticalbe effect when the font is displayed on
    lower resolution screens, to control consistency of x-heights, stem weights, Cap
    Heights, middle bars etc. As far as I know the fonts you are referring to are
    TrueType hinted fonts, and will be different from their Type 1 cousins on screen
    as well as in print, however subtely.\r\n\r\nMike"
