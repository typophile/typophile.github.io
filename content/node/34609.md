  letter from sizes 7pt up to 12pt. The typeface is drawn at 100% size in illustrator
  which means the smallest one is actually only 4pixels high, but the problem is when
  i copy them into fontlab they become very Very tiny and when i scale them up the
  shape slightly changes. I've read through the measurment pages on typophile but
  i dont get the trick with the units in fontlab.\r\nSo what do i have to do to get
  the right size as it is into fontlab without scaling, \r\nAND how do i get all these
  'different' fonts in one .ttf file?\r\nIf you know, consider yourself as a master
  of the universe"

  body: "It sounds like you are thinking that the outlines need to be scaled to proportionate
    scale in FontLab - meaning a glyph meant to be used at 6pt needs to be half as
    small as a glyph meant to be used at 12pt. Is that right? If so, you should drop
    that idea. All font scaling is meant to be done in the program the font is used
    in. So an H meant for 6pt should have the same height in Fontlab as one that is
    intended to be used at 72pt. The shapes should be different to be sure! But the
    number of units high should not. \r\n\r\nWhat UPM are you using anyway?"

  body: 'no no, the thing is i have drawn the typefaces as they should be in all the
    sizes, and now all i want to do is to put exactly that into fontlab even if i
    have to make a single .ttf file for each size, but why cant i just copy it from
    illustrator and get exactly the same in fontlab i have tried it like this, i opened
    an existing font pastet the first couple of letters into fontlab, generated the
    .ttf and installed the font. but then there is no size for this testfont where
    the letters that i pasted inside look the same as my design in illustrator, there
    is always some sort of automated hinting involved, at least it looks like that.
    so basically my question is this: how do i have to configure fontlab to make a
    7pt typeface for example? or do i have to do it like the fonts from minifonts,
    wher you have to write in 12pt in order to get the fontsize comparable to 7pt?'

    means i took a couple of squares of 1px on 1px and made some letters, lego-style

    font can only have one set of outlines per glyph. \"Hinting\" is an advanced technique
    that manipulates that one set of outlines to create different bitmap renderings.
    However, most of the current applications and operating systems do not use TrueType
    hinting the way they used to, so it is pretty much impossible to do what you're
    trying to do. \r\n\r\nRegards,\r\nAdam Twardoch\r\nFontlab Ltd.\r\n"

    be optimal on a mac. Or vice versa. You have to learn to convert to pixel size
    for both platforms. Which means 2 fonts per pixel size. \r\n\r\nAdam is right
    you have not been hinting - not using a font makers jargon anyway. You have been
    stacking squares in Illustrator. There is a big big difference.\r\n\r\nI should
    let you know since I have spent time trying to do what you are are doing that
    most people don't spend time doing this because the market for that kind of font
    is pretty small and maybe going to go away soon. But that doesn't mean you can't
    do it.\r\n\r\nThere are some good threads that talk about the ins & outs of doing
    this here. I will look for them & post some links soon.\r\n\r\nI should maybe
    note that you can make a regular outline font & hint it to work at a variety of
    sizes. You maybe knew about that already but just in case...\r\n\r\nBut the thrust
    of Adams comment is right. It mostly doesn't pay to be screen focused in your
    font development."

    drawn squared but vector font in Illustrator. Importing into FontLab won't make
    it a bitmap font. It will still be vectors and it will look like those squares
    at bigger sizes as well.\r\n\r\nHinting is actually just a special technique/software
    algorithm of a font rendering engine, to make each font look as good and readable
    at small sizes as possible. You can somehow \"help\" this program that does hinting
    (to still preserve your style and readability of the glyphs), but it's not in

    not really pixel font. As far as I understand his problem. So my previous post
    refers to this assumption. But if he actually thinks a pixelfont, then just do
    a /ignore on my previous one.

    I think higher screen rez is going to erode the need for this stuff. I could be
    wrong. Maybe people will get nostalgic or something. \r\n\r\nThe other factor
    is that thousand of people thought to themselves ( & keep thinking) 'I will make
    a pixel font - it looks easy'. Only to find themselves in a technical swamp well
    beyond what they bargained for. Plus there are all those 1000s of abandoned free
    bad pixel fonts washing around the net. They are a kind of Typographical flotsam.
    Now there are some really good ones. But like I said : I don't know how much longer
    they have before they are rendered quite obscure by the shifting sands of tech.
    10 more years?\r\n\r\nI came to type on that route so I have sympathy - but it's
    not a route I can recommend. Better to start of making a nice outline font of
    maybe a sans or serif text face - and making a real mess of it. You will learn
    more & be more entertained in the process.\r\n\r\nDavid: what do you think? "

  body: "Dear Eggs,\r\n\r\n\"So what do i have to do to get the right size as it is
    into fontlab without scaling,\"\r\n\r\nWell, that's possible, but \"normally\"
    you need to scale the type up in your case so the OS can scale them down later...if
    that makes sense. The real question is how do you scale them to get the same effect
    as fonts, as the effect they have as illustration. \r\n\r\nIf you don't want to
    scale, go to FL/FontInfo/Metrics and Dimensions/ and set the em units to the number
    of pixels in your font, copy the contour into the glyph window and you have now
    set the em to receive the little letters you made at actual size. When you compose
    the font at that size in Illustrator, it should be identical. \r\n\r\nThe \"more
    standard\" process, is to set up FontLab to be an accurate representation of the
    screen. Assuming use of a 1000 unit em, this means that when the total pixels
    size of your font is 10, e.g. 7 pixel cap ht. one pixel above that and two below
    the baseline, the FontLab 1000 em needs to be divided by 10 to give you a 100
    unit pixel. \r\n\r\nSo you go to FL/preferences/glyphwindow/dimensions/GRID STEP,
    and set that to 100 x and 100 y. Now take one of the characters you drew for a
    10 pixel em and scale it until it fits the grid exactly. You should be able to
    figure this out once, and then all the glyphs will be scaled the same. \r\n\r\nNow
    you have a font that will also give you the same fonts in illustrator by scaling
    them which will give you more \"room: to design in FL. \r\n\r\n\"AND how do i
    get all these \u2019different\u2019 fonts in one .ttf file?\"\r\n\r\nYou don't.
    TTFs are not so visionary as you. You may see my exercise on this topic at http://rogerblack.com/blog/screen_fonts_history...\r\n\r\nCheers,

    right now. \r\nAlthough i allready have done the fonts in fontlab now, (copied

    way of doing it. \r\nI am doing a research project on the legibility of screen
    fonts when it comes to smaller display sizes, i have also made some tests where
    it turned out that people need much (the numbers arent all out yet) more time
    to read Verdana and Georgia from screen than they need to read my font, which
    is good, but i have put together the text for the tests letter by letter in illustrator
    because there are about 30 ligatures at each size which are meant to increase
    the kerning quality, and that is exactly where i am stuck right now. \r\n\r\n@at

    will soon erase the problem with pixelfonts, in fact i ve been reading this article
    somewhere that said that some japanese scientists are working on a screen with
    pixels of about 1/10th of the size they have right now, but on the other hand,
    the new multitouch screens which have been introduced by Microsoft or Lemur are
    somewhat depending on the 'big' pixels, but of course with higher cpus that shouldnt
    be a problem in the future, however all this will not happen, like u said, in
    the next 10 years, which means at least 15 years until this technology is widely
    used on phones and other things with screens."
