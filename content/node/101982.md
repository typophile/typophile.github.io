body: "Hello & Shalom Friends.\r\nI have recently finished writing a new essay (written
  in Hebrew) about Hebrew typography. the work deals with two Hebrew 'fonts' designed
  463 years apart from each other - the letters of Guillaume Le Be, designed in 1550,
  and a new font designed by Bezalel graduate Ben Nathan - \"Days & Nights\".  the
  essay elaborates about their possible indirect connection through many hebrew letters
  and fonts that were designed between those times.\r\n\r\nthe essay (two files) is
  written in Hebrew and is available for free download for the benefit of everyone
  at <a_href=\"http://yaronimus.wordpress.com/2013/03/31/%D7%9E%D7%9C%D7%94%D6%BE%D7%91%D6%BC%D7%94-%D7%95%D7%A2%D7%93-%D7%99%D7%9E%D7%99%D7%9D-%D7%95%D7%9C%D7%99%D7%9C%D7%95%D7%AA-%D7%A2%D7%91%D7%95%D7%93%D7%94-%D7%A1%D7%9E%D7%99%D7%A0%D7%A8/\">
