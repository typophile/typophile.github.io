  here please!). I'm wondering whether any of the mainstream font management apps
  run in 64-bit Windows.\r\n\r\nSo far I've only identified [[http://www.padring.com/soft/Multimedia/Fonts/XFonter.html|X-Fonter
  6.4]] and [[http://www.download.com/Font-Manager/3000-2316_4-10640962.html|\"Font
  Manager\" 3.54]]. [[http://forum.notebookreview.com/showthread.php?t=326812|This
  post]] suggests that Suitcase and Font Explorer X do not have 64-bit versions (but
  FEX doesn't even have a released Windows version anyway, just a public beta a while
  back, which I found unusably unstable).\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\n\r\nT"

    (turn off UAC, manually copy over the files from an installed copy on a 32-bit
    OS), but that isn't a great long-term solution.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\n\r\nT"
