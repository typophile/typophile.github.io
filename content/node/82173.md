  body: "If it were me I wouldn't want to make it seem like I  was forging an official
    badge, so I wouldn't try too hard to match this. With that said, Ray Larabie has
    a number of techno fonts that approximate the ther lettering. Korataki is as good
    as any. (http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/typodermic/korataki/)\r\n\r\n-Mike Yanega"

  body: "Thanks for both your replies.\r\nThis is just a novelty thing I bought off
    Ebay. However the picture is old and I want to update it but it's not for sale
    anymore.\r\nIf you are more concerned about me using it inapropriatley, rather
    than it being an official badge, I'm not gonna use it illegally, just to have
    as a prop.\r\nThanks once agan for your replies.\r\nJackisback\r\n"
