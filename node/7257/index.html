In this article, the author stated that among other companies, Lanston Monotype had a contract with the US Government to manufacture 1911&#39;s during WWII. Apparently their contract was cancelled before they made any.  <BR> <BR>This got me wondering if type foundries in the past have manufactured products other than type.  <BR>Anyone have any information about that?</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Well, at the very beginning punchcutters were recruited from the goldsmithy trade, because they had experience engraving metal. Also, since type involved melting metal, naturally there was a synergy with certain industrial fields. For example, Antwerp was famed for its forged crossbow &#34;leaf springs&#34;, and later for making rifle parts, and subsequently for type. And come to think of it, this might be related to Caslon, since he started off by engraving rifles, and then came his derivations of Dutch type! <BR> <BR>Baskerville: <BR>His great success in the japanning trade basically financed his typographic efforts. And although there was no <i>material</i> synergy between the two that I can see, some experts on Baskerville point out the &#34;ideological&#34; parallels between japanning and Baskerville&#39;s style of type. <BR> <BR>hhp</div>

But since we were talking earlier about the involvement of both the American and English Monotype companies in armament manufacturing during the two world wars, it may be appropriate to note that Agfa was a member of IG Farben conglomerate &#40;and is today owned by Bayer, one of the other members of IG Farben&#41;. Among other war crimes for which IG Farben was found culpable were the use of concentration camp labour and production of the Zyklon B pesticide used in the gas chambers in the extermination camps. After the war, several IG Farben officials received prison sentences at the Nurenberg trials, and the conglomerate was broken up into its original constituent companies. Of these, Agfa, BASF and Bayer remain in business.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">With regard to Linotype, it is important to remember that the identity of Linotype as a specifically German company is a relatively recent development. For most of its history, it was largely an American and British business, which established a continental presence through relations with French and German foundries. I don&#39;t know much about the activities of the major German foundries -- Berthold, Stempel, Haas -- during WWII, but I do have the very nice Berthold Hebrew type specimen from 1924.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Thank you John, for that clarification. I&#39;m 99% sure that Linotype itself did very little Nazi business. Haas was based Basel, outside of Germany in Switzerland, so they certainly weren&#39;t using slave labor like IG Farben was. Stempel and Klingspor were still separate during the war. They, as well as L&amp;M, Berthold, Bauer, etc. probably profited from the Nazi&#39;s typographic whims. After 1933, there was in increase in thing being printed in Fraktur type. Around 1936, all of the foundries realeasesd modern-Frakturs, which in my opinion are some of the ugliest typefaces ever designed</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Dan, great post. <BR> <BR>Erik Spiekermann pointed out something very insightful during his talk at TypeCon: he gave the example of how &#34;regular&#34; German people who weren&#39;t really Nazis would do things to gain favor with the regime, like a poster designer putting a little swastika on the tail of an airplane in the background. I guess you could say that sort of thing was -and is- part of &#34;business&#34;. He also hinted &#40;at least from my perspective&#41; that the same sort of thing happens in the US now, in effect linking American companies -and their employees- with war crimes in a way. Certainly in all walks of life -including here on Typophile- some people are more likely to bootlick the powers that be than others. <BR> <BR>hhp</div>

		<div class="commentbody">The Nazi government banned Fraktur on January 3, 1941. At this point in history, they were winning the war, and were very concerned with their image abroad. In the occupied &#40;and unoccupied&#41; countries, they wanted the people to read German newspapers. Trouble was, no one could read them! They came up with a ridiculous excuse, saying the Schwabacher &#40;the forerunner of the Fraktur style&#41; was invented by the Jews. <BR> <BR>The letter is quite famous, it was concidently typed up on a sheet who letterhead was stil in Fraktur. Here is a free translation from the original German &#40;I found the German text in Kapr&#39;s book &#60;i&#62;Fraktur, For and History&#60;/i&#62;&#41;: <BR> <BR>National Socialist Party of German Workers  <BR>Represenative of the F&uuml;hrer  <BR>Munich and Obersalzberg,  <BR>January 3, 1941 <BR> <BR>Announcement, not for publication  <BR>For general information, I hereby report on the order of the F&uuml;hrer:  <BR> <BR>The so-called Gothic type style, seen as a symbol of German writing, is false. In actuallity, the so-called Gothic type can be traced to the Schwabacher-Jewish letters. Just like they later occupied the newspapers, the Jews slowly took over the the printing of books and publishing houses in Germany, from these actions stemmed the powerful influence of the Swabacher-Jewish letters. <BR> <BR>Today, in a discussion with the Reichsleiter, Herr Amann, and Herr Adolf M&uuml;ller, the Reich printing office owner, the F&uuml;hrer decided that the country&#39;s official type style should be Antiqua [serif typefaces]. As soon as possible, printed matter should begin to be made with these typefaces. When it is possibly, school books should also be reprinted, and in town schools and community colleges, this type of writing should be taught exclusively. <BR> <BR>The authorities responsible will see to it that government agencies shall stop using the Schwabacher-Jewish letters: official certificates, street signs, and other such things will now only be finished in the new official typefaces. <BR> <BR>Per order of the F&uuml;hrer, Reichsleiter Herr Amann will see to it that all newspapers and magazines, especially those in foreign circulation, or which should be in circulation abroad, switch over to the new official type. <BR> <BR>signed,  <BR>M. Bormann <BR> <BR> <BR>I shouldn&#39;t have to say that the grounds for this letter were entirely false, and fabricated! There is no link between Swabacher and Jews. I also doubt that Jews ever controlled the media, or the book industry, in Germany.</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><i>If we do things, we do it properly.</i> <BR> <BR>I often feel that graphic design has played a large part in the fact that the Nazis are always considered the worst. Granted, the efficiency and systems created for such atrocoties were scary enough. But there is such a huge visual aura that surrounds the Nazis. For instance, the Soviet &#34;police&#39; &#40;as they were murdering people under Stalin&#41; as far as I know, DID NOT use a Death&#39;s Head icon on their uniforms. Is that uniquely German? This awareness of the power of symbols or graphic elements? I think that this &#34;visual identity&#34; certainly enhances the narrative of things like Schindler&#39;s List, or The Pianist, or even the US Holocaust Museum.</div>

Some people might counter my last post saying that the swastika is a great universal, historical symbol &#40;which is was&#41;, and that I &#40;or others&#41; are only arguing that it should remain in history&#39;s dustbin because it remains such a powerful movtivator for things like Zionism, which many people in the world are against. <BR> <BR>Let&#39;s please not get into a discussion about Judaism or the Middle East. Even without the tragedy of the genocide of the Jewish people during the Holocaust, I think that enough evil could be assigned to the swastika to have it left in history&#39;s dustbin. At least 6 million Jews died in the Holocaust, but most likely another 5 million people died in concentration camps as well, and all in all, 50 million people died in the second world war, most of them civilians. One could easily argue that the Nazi party was responsible for a great deal of this, and is therefore evil. So, even if we leave Judaism out of the argument, the swastika is still bad. It has too much blood on it. <BR> <BR>I really like the topics of foundries, industry, and blackletter type. I don&#39;t want to start a flame war about religion, the holocaust, racism, or any of that in this thread. If anyone would like to discuss their feelings about Zionism, the Republican party, Islam, or anything else in any of those directions, I&#39;d glady contribute to that discussion, but in another thread.</div>

Thomas, I guess that my point was (a year ago) that there are people who do NOT find Naziism repulsive. That it was scares me. If everybody in the world found it repulsive, then yeah OK, use the symbol again. Lots. No one would be offended. 

But I'm afraid that distaste Naziism is only really limited to the West. And even there, one groups that don't seem to hate it so much, e.g., some parts of Saxony and Brandenburg in Germany, who last year elected an obscene number of "Nationalists" into their state parliaments… these people make the same arguments, mainly that the swastika is a noble ancient symbol, blah blah blah. They also argue that the Holocaust never happened (or at least wasn't nearly as bad as the Allied bombing of Germany, or the American campaigns to destroy American Indians, or any other human atrocity, or or or… main thing to do is change the subject so that no one notices that you are trying to come up with ways to kick all the immigrants out of the country). </div>

Well, that one thing is certainly true. The Armenian Genocide
was also worse. Why? Losing one's homeland; no recognition;
and no reparations. It's not just the number of dead Dan.

		<div class="commentbody">Well, I think that it is the treatment that lead up to the death, not just the death. And I never said that comparing the Holocaust to the Armenian Genocide wasn't comparing Oranges-to-Oranges. I don't support Turkish-Nationalism-Repressing-the-Past either. And I wish that Turkey (or Japan, or…) would follow post-war Germany's example relatively good example of attempting to make reparations with its neighbors and victims.

The Holocaust may not be the "worst" human atrocity ever committed, but it probably is near the top… but can you even calculate the "top"? Anyway, it was the best documented, I think. Since the Nazis themselves (and the Allies) kept such meticulous records, the Holocaust can serve as a lesson and a warning for all future generations.

If there were any ONE symbol almost-universally associated with the Armenian Genocide, then I would encourage its disuse, too. (I'm not much of a fan of the Imperial Japanese "Rising" Sun flag… the one with the rays coming out from the disc… and I really, really, don't like the Confederate Battleflag, or any of the other Confederate flags/emblems, like the 1st, 2nd, 3rd National, etc.).</div>

I think in this environment the main thing it might be
teaching the powers that be is to keep worse records.  :-/

Really, what have we learned? Dan, I've told you this before,
but you've forgotten to remember: the Armenian Genocide was used
as a justification for the Holocaust, but we haven't even learned
to accept stuff like that, much less actually dealing with genocide!

I think that in this current situation with the US as the single
superpower, it's the US that needs to learn things most*; and the
foremost thing is the need to learn to address the Amerind Genocide,
and make reparations. Without clearing that from its conscience the
US will continue to misbehave - it's like a self-fulfilling thing.

While I think the Jews are very lucky to have the Swastika: it gives them a strong visual to focus "negatively" on. I wish the Turks had something like that; the crescent & star is too diluted.

No, it's a preamble to the re-militarization of Japan. Thanks to the the US, more countries are starting to think that Might is Right.

That's entirely too brutish. Unless you don't care about mankind. Let's hear you, Dan Weaver of New York City, say that it's only normal for Hitler to be a hero to a nation.

Its only with history that we can get a real sense of how evil they are.
