body: Found this type in an elementary school book first printed in 1969 (German publisher).
  The type must be from the late sixties. Any suggestions highly appreciated.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/informal_type_1_3851.gif]

  body: "This seems to have a strong similarity the Meier's [[http://www.fontshop.com/search/?q=Barbedor&x=26&y=11|\"Barbedor\"]]
    italic, but the g is wrong, and other details don't match, even though the feeling
    and style seem very similar to me. He also did \"Syndor\", but it is also no more
    than similar. The calligraphic style also made me think of the Zapfs, but Gudrun's
    \"Nofret\" and \"Christiana\" are only superficially similar.\r\n\r\nIf it's German
    and pre-digital it may be hard for many of us to locate good samples of typefaces
    from this country & time. For me, Jaspert is about my only resource for this.

    I will try to find a source at the publisher.\r\n\r\n\u2013 JW"

  body: "I think I found the answer. I looked in a German book of Schreibschriften
    and found a font called \"Prima\", which my notes showed was also included in
    the Jaspert book. It was a Stempel typeface from 1957, designed by Martin Hermersdorf.
    The text says that this \"pen-drawn type was used by the Moritz Diesterweg educational
    publishing house in reading primers\".\r\n\r\n I overlooked it before, because
    it was included in the scripts, and I thought it was an italic face.\r\n\r\n-

    Type</a> also credits [[Karlgeorg Hoefer]] with being the designer of Prima.\r\n\r\nMartin
    Hermersdorf was a student of [[Rudolf Koch]]. He reworked Koch\u2019s <a href=\"http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Offenbacher_Schrift
    \">Offenbacher Schrift</a>, a German Kurrentschrift to be written with the broad-nipped
    pen. Bavarian schools used this \u2018Koch-Hermersdorf-Schrift\u2019 as a secondary
    script in the 1950s. Hermersdorf also is the author of several books and was a
    member of the Iserlohner Schreibkreis. As far as I know, he hasn\u2019t designed
    any typefaces.\r\n"
