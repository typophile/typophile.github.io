body: On a recent episode of "The Pitch" they featured some mock ads, and I was trying
  to learn what the bold, compact sans font is here, as seen in "MAKE SOME ART". I
  thought it was some variety of Compacta but doesn't seem to match quite right. Any
  thoughts appreciated, thanks.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/MAKE2_6251.JPG]
