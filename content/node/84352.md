  Extremist logo is not only the identity of the designer but also the first design
  for the portfolio.  I have been interested in graphic design for a long time and
  I have finally decided to start doing freelance work since no one will ever hire
  me w/o a portfolio.  In this logo I wanted to convey my dedication to the profession
  by using elements of extremism.  \r\n\r\nI would love to get some criticism on my
  first piece of work, thank you.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/FINAL-01_5165.png]"

  body: "That red star does\u2019t come thru on the black background and is not very
    visible in its current form. The handgrenade is too fuzzy to stand up in small
    sizes and the knockout /e/ is a bit problematic \u2014 you should work on that
    a bit more."

  body: A gradient reflection, swapping the tittle for a star and knocking out a letter
    over a bad clipart graphic is <em>NOT</em> logo design. It's not even design.

  body: "Well, I think there's issues with the name. Who are you trying to target
    for clients? I can't think of any client that wants to be targeted with a grenade.
    \r\n\r\nOther than that, I don't think you gain anything by merging the 'e's into
    one. It just makes it a bit harder to read. "

  body: "@Bert great advice.  I agree, red star black background not working.  Fuzziness
    is a problem.  The grenade is very clean in illustrator.  I need to figure that
    out.  \r\n\r\n@frode frank the gradient is not part of the logo; I should've included
    that in the description.  I don't know the meaning of clipart I suppose.  When
    I think of clipart I think of already made.  I hand traced a grenade picture in
    illustrator.  I am not defending it; I am learning and I really appreciate your
    link.  \r\n\r\n@aluminum the grenade is a little extreme; I guess I was trying
    to make an impact.  I will rework the \"freelance.\"\r\n\r\nThank you for taking
    the time to comment; your comments will help me a lot.  "

  body: "I'd suggest that you reconsider using \"extremist\" and the grenade. Though
    memorable they have a lot of negative connotations.\r\n\r\nTo a lesser degree,
    \"freelance\" can also have some negatives, for two reasons -- 1) It's vague.
    Are you a freelance screenwriter? Journalist? Programmer?  2) \"Freelance\" can
    conjure up an image of someone working out of their bedroom, which might not matter
    if you're just working for other designers, but if you want to develop your own
    clients in the business world I think it's better just to call yourself a designer."

    you ever touch your mouse.\r\n\u2022 People subconsciously like symmetry and math.
    So reason your design. Use grids but, but don't overdo it.\r\n\u2022 Your logo
    should deliver a message. Always keep that in mind!\r\n\u2022 Practice, practice,

  body: "\"Your logo should deliver a message. Always keep that in mind\"\r\n\r\nBUT...don't
    read that as a literal rule. A logo can be literal, but more often than not, it
    makes sense for it to not be a literal representation but more of an emblem. It
    simply represents your company...not necessarily defines it. The logo represents
    the brand more so than it creates it.\r\n\r\nI agree with many in here. I think
    it's time to do some more brainstorming...start back at the name. Come up with
    some more ideas. See where that takes you. "
