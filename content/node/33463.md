  is currently the one I've found most similiar, though they still differ quite a
  lot.\r\nOh, and here's a [better] picture of the font with all sorts of letters
  and symbols.\r\nhttp://cover-paradise.to/pub/Archive/00132500/00130701.JPEG\r\n\r\nThanks
  in advance!"

    handbook \u2013 I\u2019m sure a digitised version is out there under some other
    name.\r\n\r\nThere\u2019s a really anaemic attempt at it called <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/larabie/mexcellent/\"><strong>Mexcellent</strong></a>

  body: "Hm, yes, even though the original and Mexcellent aren't 'shut in' like that
    one, in lack of a better term, heh. And the letters 'L', 'N' along with the '5'
    slightly differ from the original.\r\nI'll definitely be checking it out further,
    though. Thanks! :D\r\n\r\nSo, I guess there's no digital alternative but those
    two?"
