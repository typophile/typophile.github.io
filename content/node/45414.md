  modified for a better fit.\r\n\r\nDo you have a favorite example? \r\n\r\nI have
  collected examples from Doyald Young and Gerard Huerta, but I would be interested
  in other examples too.\r\n\r\nI am of course especially interested in those examples
  that might apply to text face design because they are subtle enough and or work
  with roman forms, but feel free to post your favorite even if it falls outside this

    than that.... Cool! \r\n\r\nI am still having a hard time being 100% sure what
    you did with the u+el, probably because of resolution. Is that a shorter serif?\r\n\r\nThe
    changes for the m, are they to get the word to gel or to make the m work better
    at larger sizes? My guess is both.\r\n\r\nThe question of letter tailoring is
    \ very linked with the intended scale even if they are in many way quite different
    ideas."

    mark would print at any size. It also fixed a general crowded feeling and allowed
    a better rhythm in the white spaces\u2014so the \"i\" dot shifted a bit as well.\r\n\r\nThe
    \"m\" character just seemed too wide so I carefully hemmed it in a bit. The mark
    would appear with photos of fences and decking so a almost mechanical beat was
    what I was going for.\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/AD_5651_5383.png]"

  body: "Here is a quote that Gerard Huerta was kind enough to give me.\r\n\r\n<cite>The
    Architectural Digest masthead was designed to be slightly condensed and\r\nmore
    tightly spaced than I would normally want. It is not a font, but a\r\nhand-drawn
    logo. The purpose is to give it more presence on the cover. At\r\nnineteen characters
    it is the one of the more complex mastheads.\r\n\r\n<cite>As we know a font\u2019s
    characters are meant to all work with each other. In a\r\nlogo where we have fixed
    relationships we can draw the best possible\r\nletterform combinations.</cite>\r\n\r\n<cite>There
    are two ligatures in the artwork: \u201CAR\u201D and \u201CRAL.\u201D In the first\r\nligature
    the leg (and angle) of the \u201CR\u201D is allowed to tuck nicely under the\r\n\u201CC.\u201D
    In the second ligature the angle of the leg of the \u201CR\u201D has been changed\r\nto
    allow the consistent spacing that has been established.</cite>\r\n\r\n<cite>There
    are two \u201CC\u201Ds in the word \u201CArchitectural.\u201D The second \u201CC\u201D
    has an\r\nunfortunate neighbor \u201CT\u201D, and combined with the open space
    left by the \u201CC\u201D\r\nit leaves more negative space than one would want
    in this situation.\r\nTherefore, the ending of the \u201CC\u201D has been slightly
    extended and weight has\r\nbeen added to that part of it to compensate for the
    excessive negative\r\nspace. </cite>\r\n\r\n<cite>The last thing to mention is
    the bookmatched serifs in the combinations\r\n\u201CCT\u201D, \u201CES\u201D,
    and \u201CST.\u201D</cite>\r\n\r\nJames, I will comment further on the Huemiller
    later today or the next. "
