body: "Hello,\r\n\r\nI'm hoping to get some feedback and critique on a logotype I'm
  currently designing a for a website. I want to explain a little of the background
  for this project, so I apologize if this is long-winded.\r\n\r\nThe logotype will
  be incorporated into the site masthead as well as appear on its own in promotional
  material and business cards. The site will be an online magazine in blog format
  exploring issues of popular culture with an academic and investigative angle, with
  accompanying data visualizations and scholarly references.\r\n\r\nThe title of the
  site, \"Special Topics in T\u0105xidermy\", is not literal but it can be broken
  down into two layers of meaning. The first part of the title \"Special Topics\"
  is intended to connote the aforementioned academic, investigative angle. This preface
  is commonly used in published work pertaining to a certain topic, such as an academic
  essay. Secondly, the word \"T\u0105xidermy\" can be seen as a sort of placeholder,
  connoting the obscure or under-appreciated. The site will really not have anything
  to do with taxidermy, but it will deal with topics that aren't ordinarily explored
  in-depth.\r\n\r\nProcess:\r\n\r\nAfter working with some original, hand drawn logotypes
  in an earlier stage, I didn't feel I was capturing the academic angle very well.
  In this iteration, I'm hoping that first line \"Special Topics in\" set in the traditional
  serif accomplishes this. \"T\u0105xidermy\" is intended to be more quirky and connote
  a sort of craft-like quality. In the end, it's likely that I will apply some treatment
  to roughen the look of the mark, of which I attached an example, along with the
  original version.\r\n\r\nCritique:\r\n\r\nI'd like to know what you think about
  the overall composition, scale and font harmony. Font suggestions are appreciated.
  For those interested, \"T\u0105xidermy\" is currently set in [[http://www.fonthaus.com/fonts/emigre/quartet/em21218|Quartet
  Bold]] by Emigre.\r\n\r\nThanks for reading, I very much appreciate the input!"

  body: "While the intent is clear, there's something that don't work.\r\nMaybe it's
    the underline, maybe is the small-caps \"in\".\r\nI think you should find some
    example of old academic papers and try to recreate it with your words. The words
    themselves and the context will give the unusual/post-modern feeling to the logo."

  body: "i feel it could definitely be on a brochure like you'd find at the doctors
    office right next to the free condoms and herpes information packets.... heh.\r\n\r\nbut
    otherwise, it does sorta of seem outlandish, which is perfect for your needs.
    the slight tilt of taxidermy really lifts the attitude to be slightly humorous,
    and works well. the kerning looks good, but i'd take a little bit out of topics
    between the o and p. \r\n\r\nannnnnd im in class right now so i'll keep this short."

  body: "I would tighten the space between the 'T' and the \u2018a' in taxidermy,
    and suggest you try lowercase, italic or even an altogether different font for
    \u2018in', so as to both solve your problem with hierarchy and further amplify
    the eccentricity. I do not mind the underline, although, I don't see why the serifs
    should be resting on it (would create noise at smaller sizes) and so I'd rather
    see it go through them, and share their thickness.\r\n\r\nI would also suggest
    not extending the underline to the \u2018in' : restrict it to \u2018special topics'.
    \r\n\r\nMy one problem is the font used for \u2018Taxidermy' ; this may be a matter
    of taste, but for me it is <em>too</em> Emigre for comfort, which is to say free-font
    / retro-90's... Not to disparage your choice, because I do see how it functions
    to capture that sort of strange quality required, and it is not a bad choice altogether...
    However, I do think that you'd be well-served with another selection whose strangeness
    is met with a more authoritative feeling. Perhaps it is simply because I love
    the quality in the font used in \u2018special topics' and I would like to see
    a font that plays better with it... Can anyone who would agree with me think of
    some ideal slab-serif with a post-modern feel to it for this? \r\n\r\n( Or, better
    yet, taking a page from the literal meaning of taxidermy - and seeing as how that
    very practice is in some ways the very definition of \u2018post-modern' perhaps
    you can create custom letterforms based on your interventions of an appropriate
    font? Might be a nice way to incorporate some of what works with the existing
    font yet in a more pleasing way? )\r\n\r\n( BTW, I would not go with the \u2018rough'
    version, but what I like in it is the way that it almost renders the emigre font
    into an italic. )"

  body: "Thanks for all your feedback.\r\n\r\nAfter some discussion with my cohorts
    on the project, I'm leaning toward using hand-drawn serif in lieu of the Quartet
    face for \"Taxidermy\". While I drew it myself, the letterforms are inspired by
    old glyphs from  historical documents. \r\n\r\nThe aim still obscurity, evoking
    the study of something forgotten, perhaps unearthed from an aged manuscript. I
    resonate very much with what CGI is saying about \"strangeness is met with a more
    authoritative feeling\". As for \"Special T\xF8pics\" I thought a more extended
    serif would help differentiate the two parts of the title.\r\n\r\nSo here are
    my concerns with the \"Taxidermy\" portion: While I like the connotation of ancient
    typesetting, I don't want to necessarily relate to a particular tradition or style,
    be it a certain time period, region or art movement. At the same time, I don't
    want it to be generic\u2014as of this iteration I do have concerns about the originality
    and uniqueness of the logotype.\r\n\r\nLastly. I'm not sure if the overall shape
    is very interesting, or the negative space that is created. This is something
    that I felt the logotype I originally posted did very well, and I feel like it's
    lost because this one is more evenly rectangular. \r\n\r\nSo here are two options,
    one more rigid and regular (option 1), and another that I tweaked slightly (option
    2). I also made one of the version with the underline left off of the \"IN\",
    per feedback from CGI. I very much appreciate everyone's input, let me know what
    you think!\r\n\r\n[[http://i34.tinypic.com/34gwxg8.jpg|Option 1]]\r\n[[http://i36.tinypic.com/2n8zmz7.jpg|Option
    2]]\r\n"

- body: The underline is terribly distracting and totally unnecessary. Why is it there?
    And even worse -- WHY is it touching the letters? It's like a really, really bad
    toupee; I can't even see anything else!

  body: "Ditching the underline is a good choice, Andrew. I like the new font for
    TAXIDERMY. It has a cinematic flair, which always appeals to me. You might try
    varying the vertical size of some of the letters so they do not have a uniform
    baseline. \r\n\r\nRobert"
