  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Hello, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I'm looking for advice on type for an artist's book. The book will be mostly photographs, printed in warm quadratone, one to a page (in some cases one to a spread). There will type on title pages, acknowledgements, and on a one or two page essay. The type is set simply, fairly large (13pt) and the essay is set with very large margins. Page size is 15 x 13 inches. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The photographs are dense and lush, but of stark subject matter, and formally could be seen as late modern. The overall time feel of the images is &quot;some time in the 20th or 21st centuries.&quot;  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I've expermimented with a couple of treatments, including sans serif (which just seemed to plain in the context of the work) and traditional serif faces like Garamond and Bembo, which seemed to &quot;retro&quot; and to overemphasize that aspect of the work. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->My current mockup uses Mrs. Eaves. I like the general look of it, but the letterspacing in the body copy is kind of wonky. Also, it seems kind of trendy right now &hellip; I'd prefer something with a similar feel but fresher. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->As a final note, I may end up having the text printed letterpress from plates made from digital files. Mrs. Eaves seems designed to give a &quot;letterpress look&quot; and I'm not sure if it's a good idea to print a face that mimics letterpress on an actual letterpress. However, I may end up printing conventionally, so ideally I'll use a type that would work with either approach. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Any thoughts on what I might look at? <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Some samples of the photographs are at <!-- raw HTML omitted --><a href="http://www.paulraphaelson.com">www.paulraphaelson.com</a><!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Thank you very much for any help.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Thanks for all the advice, everyone. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I've been experimenting a lot, and nothing looks as good as Mrs. eaves for the title page and cover type. But it's not working for the body copy, partly because of the low x-height and partly because of the messed up letterspacing.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Of everything I've looked at for the text, the two faces that look best are baskerville (which I guess eaves is based on) and cochin. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Do you think it's strange to use two different serif text faces like this? They won't be on the same page as each other &hellip; the mrs. eaves will only be at the front of the book, since there won't be display copy used with the text. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->One thing I find I like for this project is a capital W without a center serif (as in the baskerville and the eaves, but not the cochin). I know this sounds nitpicky, but it stands out for me since the title starts with W.</div>
