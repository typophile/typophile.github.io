body: "I'm making this number for my wife to celebrate our 8 years of being together.
  I'm trying to find a balance between it having a decorative character and still
  resemble an 8.\r\n\r\nThe problem I'm having is that even though it's a two-story
  construction, I think I need to balance the lachrymal terminals on the upper and
  lower story. But I like weight. Also, think it looks like an \"S\" in that regard
  (that's a good thing).\r\n\r\nI've added a few simple ornaments to represent the
  8 years we've been together; six unmarried, and two married.\r\n\r\nI've attached
  the progress along with the ornamented, latest version. I'm going with the inline
  version in the final piece but comments on either version are welcome.\r\n\r\nI'm
  asking for everyone's opinions and criticisms. This is only my second time making
  a custom character and I want to make it as \"finished\" as possible. I appreciate
  all the help. Thank you."

  body: I like it!  You might want smooth more the "lumps" formed by joined beziers,
    particularly on the inside on the bottom left and right above that at the lachrymal.  Also
    the whole top right stroke seems to be down just a bit.

  body: "Thank you for the suggestions. I took out a lot of the extra points in an
    effort to simplify the curves and eliminate the humps. I did notice that the top-right
    part was a little low and tweaked it slightly. \r\n\r\nI also fixed the top and
    the bottom of the inline to be more rounded and smoother.\r\n\r\nI've attached
    the new version to the original post and included it here for review. I'm still
    looking for more opinions and criticisms. Keep um' coming!\r\n\r\nNOTE ::: Typophile
    is not letting me insert and image into this post. I've included the new version
    in the original post at the top. Sorry."

    8.

    it will look backwards that way. '

  body: "I agree with the horizontal flip, it would change the logic I've tried to
    follow. It would look weird at this point.\r\n\r\nI've moved the node to a more
    appropriate category.\r\n\r\nI've also added some simple circular ornaments. Comments,
    criticisms, and encouragement is always welcome. Thanks to everyone for the suggestions
    so far, they've been great."
