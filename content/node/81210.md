  body: "Font Family.\r\n\r\nMaybe one of the very first font families in the modern
    sense of the term was Frutiger's Univers. The weight of Univers wasn't italic
    - roman - bold, but in the currently often used ultra light, light, roman, bold,
    black, extra (with an oblique version of each weight).\r\n\r\nBut seeing the example
    I think that you may intend the most modern concept of the extended (my own words!!)
    font family, which is a collection of fonts in different weights and in different
    styles.\r\nExamples: Stone family features Stone Serif, Stone Sans, Stone Informal
    etc. Agfa Rotis family features Serif, Semiserif, Semisans and Sans. Officina
    features Officina Sans and Officina Serif.\r\nAs the work to create such a range
    of weights and styles is very huge this kind of extended font families started
    to arise in the latest development of font design, when it expanded into a huge
    team work rather than solo work, which was quite like the 'old school' of font
    design.\r\nAs much as the what, who and when are said, still remains the why?
    It's simply to avoid troubles in font matching.\r\nWith such a comprehensive font
    family you may cover all the font functionalities you need in a typographic work
    without the trouble of studying a font pairing (which is IMHO still one of the
    best and most useful typographic activities to sharpen the typographer's mind).
    In fact these families are like a collection of different fonts designed with
    their pairing as the supreme guideline.\r\nThis should avoid troubles when working
    with multiple fonts but a careful study is still required as the context and the
    needed design may need further adjustements.\r\nAnd also remember that some great
    fonts are only a weight and they're still kicking ass. This means not to refer
    to the font family extension as a measure of quality. You should prefer a single
    weight font designed like heaven than a huge family of crap.\r\n\r\n\r\nFeel free
    to correct and/or to discard my opinions as I'm still a young type student..\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Steve, Frank's answer is correct. Early printing types were designed to look
    like the handwritten letters they replaced, so the strokes are thick where a right-handed
    scribe would use the broad edge of a broad-nibbed pen, and narrow where he'd use
    the narrow edge of the pen. \r\n [img:sites/default/files/old-images/m800_italic_manual_5070.jpg]\r\nYou
    can see this contrast in old-style types like Garamond. As letterforms evolved
    from the 15th to the 19th century, the contrast between thick and thin became
    stylized and exaggerated in faces like Didot and Bodoni."

    were very comprehensive.\r\nI just want to know if there is a name for when 1
    character (e.g. 'A') that has different weights across the 2 stems (left thin
    and right thick).\r\n\r\nThanks for your response.\r\n"

  body: "In the wiki link on the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PANOSE\">Panose
    classification</a>, it is said that the contrast \"describes the ratio between
    the thickest and narrowest points on the letter 'O.' The uppercase 'O' is used
    because it is generally of higher contrast than the other characters of the alphabet.\"\r\n\r\nThere
    is a more precise definition in Haralambous' book \"Fonts & Encodings\", page
    431\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/contrast_6506.jpg]\r\nIt is the ratio
    between min(c,d) and max(a,b) where min(c,d) is the smallest value between the
    widths c and d, and max(a,b) is the largest value between the widths a and b.\r\n\r\nAlso
    in the wiki link there is this definition: \"Stroke Variation: It specifies the
    relationship between the thicknesses of the thin stems and the wide stems. It
    further details the contrast trait by describing the kind of transition that occurs
    as the stem thickness changes on rounded glyph shapes.\" I thin Haralambous puts
    it more clearly, saying that with stroke variation \"we are concerned with the
    more or less rapid way in which a stroke changes from one thickness to another\".\r\n\r\nSo,
    my guess is that what you have in mind is really the contrast."
