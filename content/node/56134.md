  keep coming back!\r\n\r\nNo, you don't have a virus, you have Microsoft Office.
  \r\n\r\nRecently on the <a href=\"http://www.twitter.com/typophile\">Typophile Twitter
  feed</a> we called out for tutorials to help MS Office users prevent Office from
  automatically reinstalling unwanted fonts. Not that we don't like the fonts. We
  just can't stand a software philosophy that doesn't give users a choice, especially
  when it means endlessly scrolling through font menus.\r\n\r\nThe community responded
  with a handful of links. These aren't tested or proven. Follow their advice at your
  own risk:\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://twitter.com/kiranmaxweber\">@kiranmaxweber</a>

  re Office 2008 fonts is that '08 apparently doesn't attempt \"auto-repair\" font
  reinstall on launch like X & 2004.\r\n\r\nAnd finally, as if to temper any glimmer
  of exuberance that you could shorten your font menu by 40%, there's this cautionary

  body: Presumably, MS considers the fonts necessary for document compatibility between
    Office users, which is not an entirely unreasonable notion, since the average
    Office user probably does not want to deal with managing fonts. I think it might
    have been better to do as Adobe has done with its private font folder. Fonts installed
    there are available only in Adobe apps.
