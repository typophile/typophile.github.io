  Dutch Telecom).\r\nLast week I was at Schiphol Amsterdam Airport. KPN has a so called
  \"Communication Centre\" there and makes great use of the typefaces, especially
  in 3D. :)\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/custom_01_kpn_22_4466.jpg]\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/custom_01_kpn_23_3590.jpg]\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/custom_01_kpn_24_6540.jpg]\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/custom_01_kpn_25_6326.jpg]\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/custom_01_kpn_26_4959.jpg]\r\n\r\nMore
