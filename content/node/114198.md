    Gothic]]. The A could be made with inverted V, but the numerals are not exactly
    the same. Old Image Club font [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/imageclub/pacifica-condensed/?refby=bowfin|Pacifica
    Condensed]] has the A, but is more squared.\r\n\r\nCould be custom design for
    the phone app.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
