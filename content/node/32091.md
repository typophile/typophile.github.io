  Museum of Printing History narrates the story of written communication and the ways
  in which the technologies of printing have transformed everyones lives. Galleries
  trace significant developments from ancient Mesopotamian clay tablets, to the Chinese
  invention of movable type, to Johann Gutenberg's printing press. American history
  is dramatized through newspaper accounts of major events from the American Revolution
  to the Civil War; Texas history is told through the life of the state's first printer,
  with a press he owned and a display of the documents and newspapers he printed.
  The Hearst Newspaper Gallery demonstrates the emergence of modern printing, and
  our exhibit of historic newspapers documents pivotal moments in recent history.\r\n\r\nThe
  Museum features artifacts such as:\r\nMesopotamian Cylinder Seals\r\nAncient Papyrus
