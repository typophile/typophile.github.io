body: "I saw Olicana used to write \"Tropical Paradise\" in an ad today, and decided
  to visit its critique page, where I found out that it's been pulled from the market
  because Veer has an \"unreasonable\" new contract, due to new management. This made
  me concerned, because I'm working on getting my first font (Newt) sold, and I've
  gotten it pretty far down the pipeline with Veer. What should I know about Veer's
  new terms? I'm pretty sure Grant Hutchinson is an honest guy, but you never know
  about upper management, so it'd be nice to know what's changed and what makes it
  \"ridiculous\".\r\n\r\nNathanael"

  body: Very reasonable. I don't mean to sound accusatory in this; mainly I'm curious,
    and certainly not interested in making enemies. I'll ask Grant. In the meantime,
    now that I've breached the topic, if anyone else wants to sound off on it, it
    couldn't hurt to know what typophiles at large think.

    contract\" - once the contract is signed its a bit too late to say its unreasonable?
    Sure contracts get terminated due to breach or a change of heart, but unreasonableness?

    so that probably won't get to him until Monday. He may see this first, which I
    mentioned in the e-mail.\r\n\r\nI have seen the contract (or rather, a preliminary
    draft), but this is my first time selling a font, so I don't have any idea what
    a different contract might look like. It seemed reasonable to me, which is why
    I was wondering. \r\n\r\nI'm not sure what the chain of events was that led to
    Olicana not being sold by Veer anymore. [[http://www.typophile.com/node/16296|Here]]'s
    the relevant thread, with people starting to discuss it on November 4th last year. "

    terms in general, not my specific contract, but you all are probably right. I'll
    keep this between me and Grant, I suppose, unless anyone would like to private-message
    me.

    Resident\", this one in the Cincinnati area. I think it was for pools, but I don't
    have it right now. I remember thinking, \"Wow, if that's Olicana, it's gotten
    a whole lot of market penetration in a very short time.\" And it was, so it has.
    I congratulate you--within one year, your font made it into a place where I'd
    expect most people to just use system fonts.\r\n\r\nI'm probably over 99% sure
    I'll still market with Veer, so now this has been graded down to just being kind
    of curious, mixed with not worrying about it. Whenever I hear back about it, that'll
    probably satisfy me.\r\n\r\nCheers!\r\nP.S. If I find the ad again, I'll post
    here what the company's name is."

    came out I saw similar things happening, but not on a free font site. There are
    lots of sites about where people blatantly give out intellectual properties such
    as fonts. The person giving my font away was acting as though we were romantically
    involved and I wanted to spread the wealth. Such thievery is tragically rampant.\r\n\r\nVeer,
    by the way, has been great for me. My deal is exclusive and thus uncomplicated.
    They are very good at marketing and since I'm not, it works like a charm.\r\n\r\nStephen"
