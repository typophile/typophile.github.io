body: "Once again the sensibility of Paolo Roversi inspires me drawing my letters.
  These photos are from an old Ferretti ad campaign (1998 I think). The characters
  are from my \u201EWebadvanced\u201C font. A thicker but meant to be elegant character
  which I\u2019d love to keep some elegance and liveliness even in the smaller sizes
  on monitor. What a hard way to go!\r\nI am listening to the beautiful semiclassical
  music of William Orbit.\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    still bolder to make it work in small monitor sizes.\r\nI love its character.
    The \u2018a\u2019 has particularly drawn my attention.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Image_Text_a!_4504.png]"
