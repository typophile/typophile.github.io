  for running text (body text)? (even thought its typographic colour seems a little
  \"dark\" and similar to Gill Sans, in my humble opinion)\r\n\r\nI really mean the
  sans version, not the serif one! (not Scala)\r\n\r\nAnd if it is good for running
  text, which typeface could be a good companion for it? (another sans, maybe for
  display headlines on a magazine?)\r\n\r\nI know there is a controversy mixing a
  sans serif with other sans serif, but I've seen it in use and it could work, sometimes,
  I guess?\r\n\r\nWhat do you people think? (maybe Scala Sans with TheSans or Scala
  Sans with DIN?)\r\n\r\nThanks for your feedback!"

    is it right?

  body: "Yes, Scala Sans can be a good text face. For titling, as you mentioned, you
    might try Luc(as) de Groot's Thesis Sans (or TheSans), especially the bolder weights,
    which will give a slightly different flavor to the headlines. Fred Smeijer's Quadraat
    Sans might be interesting, but I've never seen them paired like that, so the best
    option in that case would be to try it. :)\r\n\r\nIf you're really going for some
    contrast, you might try Typotheque's Klimax, either Plus or Minus (or both), which
    will give you some very bold or light weights, respectively.\r\n\r\nMixing type
    is really very subjective, especially within genres like sans, but it can make
    a design. But it really depends. What are you using it for?"

  body: "My project is a magazine about design-related stuff, but actually, it's a
    magazine that wants to be a book. It must feel a little bit \"classy\" and \"elegant\",
    but without the serifs. The format is square, 24,6 x 24,6 cm. It is a magazine,
    but I want it to approach more the language of a book than of a magazine. It is
    not a \"popular\" magazine at all!\r\n\r\nI'll have a look at both Quadraat Sans
    and Klimax! (is Klimax available for licensing?)\r\n\r\nThanks so much for your
    feedback, Brian! I never thought it was so complex to design a magazine that wants
    to be a book!"

  body: "I loved Quadraat Sans \"spiked\" capitals! They look great! Is there any
    similar sans for headlines with such \"spiked\" capitals? But I didn't like the
    lower case \"a\", for example. In this case, I prefer the lowercases from \"Thesis
    TheSans\"! If only they had those \"spiked\"-like capitals!\r\n\r\nBut it must
    all combine with Scala Sans..."

  body: "I've seen sans serifs with similar \"spikes\" on them, or perhaps you could
    call them overhangs... But I can't remember any of their names! I think Quadraat
    Sans would match very well for titling with Scala as text, they see to have some
    kind of similar structure. The best way to see is to try it! If you don't have
    Quadraat then you could probably go on fontshop or myfonts, or some similar site
    and type some example text and set it as large as you can, then go ahead and copy
    it and paste it onto your page. Print it out and see if it's good. You could also
    post a test here...\r\n\r\nAs far as it goes, I think Quadraat Sans lends an air
    similar to that of a classic serif, but without the serifs. I don't know that
    it is necessarily elegant, but it just might work.\r\n\r\nKlimax is available
    for license from Typotheque. http://www.typotheque.com/fonts/ Also available from
    Typotheque is Brioni Sans, which may also work well. Or you could use DIN. I personally
    am intrigued with pairing Scala Sans with Quadraat Sans, but it could look great
    with any number of fonts I'm sure. :)\r\n\r\nAlso, just curious, did you get inspiration
    for your original type selection idea from Ellen Lupton's Thinking With Type book?
    She used Scala for text, and Thesis Serif (TheSerif) for most headlines. Of course
    those are serif and not sans fonts, but the sans versions are probably similarly
    compatible.\r\n\r\nAlso, if you're going for classy and elegant, you could break
    the sans only rule and use serifs a little. :)"
