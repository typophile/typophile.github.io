  a new website about Armenian type (and related fields). She did an amazing job in
  less than three weeks, and we'd love to see anybody and everybody with even a remote
  curiosity about the Armenian script check it out, register for the mailing list,
  and post comments.\r\n\r\nBTW, the site was launched on the Armenian diaspora's
  premiere TV network, Horizon, live on Friday night! Nerve-wracking but very exciting.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "<em>Of course, the answer is to draw on authentic historical roots</em>\r\n\r\nOne
    way to do that is to look at pre-typographic text culture and, in effect, move
    forward from there along new lines. This is especially fruitful in the case of
    scripts that have been ill served by the technical limitations of previous font
    and typesetting technologies, or which have ossified in their typographic form
    as a result of having too few type designs available for too long (which seems
    to have been the case with the Armenian <em>bolorgir</em> style).\r\n\r\nWe're
    very fortunate in the case of Armenian that there is such a good <a href=\"http://armenianstudies.csufresno.edu/books_for_sale/album_of_armenian_paleography.htm\">palaeographic
    study</a> of the script. I wish every script I worked with had such a resource!"

  body: "On a scale of 1 to 10, or however one wishes to put it, though, except for
    the fact of being a script with a small number of users (and hence a small number
    of type designers), I don't think Armenian faces severe problems.\r\n\r\nOf course,
    balancing \"Armenian-ness\" defined, however incorrectly, as a resemblance to
    Bolorgir (the weighted sans-serif type with the really small x-height and slanted
    lowercase, for those who don't want to look it up) with Latin typeface conventions
    is a challenge. But it's simply a stylistic void that invites designers to propose
    solutions.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, properly implementing the calligraphic rules
    of Arabic stretches the limits of current electronic font technology.\r\n\r\nEthiopic
    doesn't have a fundamental technical problem, but the character set is large enough
    that the forms of some of the elements of its syllabary were compromised to allow
    the language to be typed on an ordinary typewriter. So while fonts for the language
    don't require sophisticated character to glyph mapping, keyboards may need work.
    (Think of Chinese or Korean input methods.)\r\n\r\nEven Greek - which has a larger
    (and more economically prosperous, at least until recently) community of users
    than Armenian - has, in my opinion, a more serious problem than Armenian. It,
    too, was under Turkish rule for a long time, leading to Greek typography being
    done chiefly by foreigners. And so we have the effects of Porson Greek on the
    script.\r\n\r\nGreek capital letters, like those of Cyrillic, fit the standard
    Latin paradigm just fine. But capitals and lower case were basically not integrated
    at all in Porson Greek. While most modern typefaces do better at this, this, in
    my opinion, is a very basic stylistic issue which, so far, does not seem to be
    addressed in a satisfactory manner outside of sans-serif faces.\r\n\r\nIn the
    case of the Latin alphabet, Bembo, Caslon, Garamond, Bodoni, Baskerville, Century
    Expanded, Caledonia and Times Roman can be said to <em>all</em> resoundingly embody
    pretty well the same basic answer to the question \"What should the Latin alphabet
    look like\".\r\n\r\nSo much so, that perhaps the Latin alphabet is <em>more</em>
    ossified than Armenian, at least at present, despite the effects of Bolorgir.
    It's a good thing we have a solution that makes everyone happy, though - and the
    Latin alphabet, being so widely used, does get lots of experimental designs being
    done for it."

    apparently dying out.)\r\n\r\nA fraction of the younger generation, at any given
    moment, will simply not see it worth the effort to maintain a language skill without
