  identify and locate all the fonts used on this gauge. If you know of something similar

    Franklin Gothic Heavy:\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/itc/franklin-gothic/\r\n\r\nYou
    already have Salem, but \"the\" and \"Line\" could be reproduced using Hooptie

    JNL</a> for 'SALEM'?\r\n\r\nEdit: Lots of folks already have a copy of Aldous
    or Huxley (same typeface) on their computers. If you do, Anthony, you might find
    it close enough."

  body: "For _Salem_ Wingate JNL, already suggested by Mike, would work but it is
    an all caps font with no size difference between the upper and lower case, and
    the _m_ is roundtop without an ascender on the lhs stroke. \r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/WingateJNLInUse_3928.gif]\r\nAn
    alternative is Perron No 3, Light or Regular\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/PeronNo3LightInUse_6100.gif]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/PeronNo3InUse_5152.gif]
    http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/fontforecast/perron/  Perron No 3 has a size difference
    between the upper and lower case, and the _m_ is roundtop with an ascender on
    the lhs stroke. \r\nNeither font is a perfect match.\r\nDon\r\n"

    I ended up just drawing out \"The\" and \"Line\". Much simpler than modifying
    an existing font.\r\n\r\nThanks again!"
