    of the thin bystroke in some of the letters.\r\n\r\nThe open ends of the thin
    strokes on round letters like |C| and |O| feel rough to me. The variation of open,
    closed, and serifed terminals seems random, particularly for the |H|; maybe settle
    on a single style? The |B| is messy, and the top of the |\u1E9E| looks broken
    (though its overall shape is cool)."

    to possibly add liveliness: different stroke thicknesses (horizontal), open/closed

    my library even without having any serious use for it, just for its prettiness.
    However (and as a layman I find it nerve-wrecking to articulate any criticism)
    there are a few glyphs that don't quite convince me.\r\n<ul> <li> X and Z seem
    in doubt whether or not to look top-heavy like K and R; to me they look a bit
    unstable as they are now;\r\n<li> Y stands out as the only glyph to have an angular
    bystroke, which I find puzzling;\r\n<li> IJ to me looks less like an IJ than as
    an alternative glyph for U \u2014 it would be less confusing with either a shortened
    I-shape or a J-shape with a real descender (by the way, that curved J-shape would
    be a lovely alternative glyph for the straight one);\r\n<li> \u0152 looks like
    an O that comes speeding from the right; \xC6 has more or less a similar effect.
    Of course this font does not aim for a maximum legibility, but still...\r\n<li>
    I am not sure if the four different heights of the middle bar in E, F, G and H
    might not be a bit too much of a good thing; especially the middel bar of \xC6
    being lower than E's or \u0152's might be reconsidered.\r\n</ul> All these reservations
    are of course to be taken with a healthy dose of salt...\r\nAll best, Bart\r\n"

    lines on the curves come back towards the bowl but then stop is really bothersome
    to my eye. If you don''t want that end reconnecting, perhaps it should stay the

    rather say, the stroke topography of both the R\u2019s and the Eszett\u2019s right
    part is essentially different from the Y. I still don\u2019t see a possible other

    Question mark looks a bit underdressed without a bystroke \r\n\r\nI considered
    and think, I best leave the exclam and the question marks in that simple fashion.
    I don\u2019t want them to become too grave.\r\n\r\n> IJ \u2026\r\nwell, see the
    new take on it. I also changed the \u0152 and I feel that this solution is better.\r\nI
    also did a new approach to the zero figure. Wasn\u2019t quite satisfied with it
    (previous versions in light grey).\r\n\r\n [img:sites/default/files/old-images/a-typo3-1_5423.png]\r\n\r\nThanks
    for your kind words about those figures; I found them rather cumbersome to make.\r\nWell,
    the 1 and the 4 are quite nice \u2026\r\n\u2013 In that sample you also see a
    1st view of the Italic.\r\n\r\nAnd, as to the narrowings of the bystrokes: there
    is a shortcoming of rendition in rough screen display, of course. Even on one
    single machine, depending on the application: you get different results. In the
    sample below (from the Mac): TextEdit \u2013 rather thicky (top); PDF view \u2013
    more crisp (bottom).\r\nAdmittedly, this is going to be a face for sizes rather
    beyond 36p. And more for the print than the screen.\r\nI still feel that the stroke
    scheme ought be as it is now.\r\n\r\n [img:sites/default/files/old-images/a-typo3-2-goth_5786.png]\r\n\r\n\u2013
