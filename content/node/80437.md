body: "Hi,\r\n\r\nI have a problem with the /ff/ ligature in a particular typeface.
  when /ff/ is automatically replaced with a ligature in InDesign, there appears a
  gap to the next letter, except for those combinations for which other ligatures
  exist, like ffi and ffl. I contacted the designer over this and he said I should
  just turn of ligatures for this combination. \r\n\r\nI tried to do the following:
  I turned of ligatures, and instead inserted them manually through search/replace.
  This is a bit of a hassle but works. But I would prefer using ligatures as a default,
  and only to turn it of for the combination /ff/, but not for /ffi/ and /ffl/. Is
  there some way to change the one without changing the other? Perhaps some kind of
  either/or code? I work in CS2, so no GREP styles available yet...\r\n\r\nThanks
  a lot!\r\n\r\nJeffrey\r\n\r\nPS I don't want to discredit the designer for this,
  which is why I don't mention the name of the font here.\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Hm ... CS2 ... Can you make a character style with negative kerning and then
    search/replace to apply the style to instances of ff? (I'm not sure if CS2 has
    the features to do that.) Or, if the problem is in the font itself, are you allowed
    to edit the font?\r\n\r\nJosh"

  body: "@riccardo \r\nYes, kerning certainly works best. I don't know why I forgot
    about that... But if the problem occurs often (in german /ff/ is common) is there
    a way to automate this, so that all instances of a certain combination are always
    kerned tighter?\r\n\r\n@Joshua Langman\r\nCharacter styles can not change kerning,
    it can only be changed to optical, metrics or none. I tried using tighter tracking,
    but this breaks the ligature. I could ask if I'm allowed to edit it, but I'm afraid
    I might break more than I would fix, so... I'd rather leave that up to the type
    designer, and try to find a solution in InDesign."

    character kerns to the kern feature ahead of the class kerning. That way they
    are exceptions, and won't break anything. I can't imagine that kerning would generally
    be a part of the \"no modification\" clause, else InDesign's optical kerning (and
    any plug-in), and Quark's kerning routine would break the EULA. The only \"no
    kerning changes\" EULA I've ever seen was in one of Porchez's font licenses."

  body: "@Charles\r\n\r\nHow would I do this? I'm hardly an expert in Fontlab, so
    even such a simple modification is a bit scary. I tried modifying simple functions
    like kerning and spacing in Fontlab before, and the results have sometimes been
    that somehow the hinting was completely off somehow, or other mistakes happening
    or functions being destroyed rather than fixed. This is why I'd rather work inside
    InDesign. I have Cool Kerning installed, but haven't really worked with it yet.
    A first try results in the ligature not working, but that is probably some error
    I made. I'll keep trying anyway. Thanks to all, more ideas are welcome!"
