  body: This must be another rounded Isonorm or DIN face.

  body: I saw the &#34;rounded DIN&#34; thread a while back. So you think this is
    an in-house custom job?

  body: Mercedes definitely has the same feel, but the &#34;O&#34; is narrower on
    my sample. Looks more condensed...

  body: Hmmm, that is rounded and condensed, but it looks too &#34;balloonish&#34;
    to me. &#40;Not sure how else to describe it...&#41;

  body: I have to agree, now that I look at it closer. Sigh! <BR> <BR>And AG Book
    Rounded is similar -- too &#39;balloonish&#39;.

  body: Yes. That&#39;s why I like this typeface, just enough &#34;roundness&#34;
    without being cartoonish... Maybe this is a custom job as Yves suggested? I set
    this same text in FF DIN Bold, and rounded the corners in Illustrator just to
    see if it was close, and it looked very similar...

  body: I actually once saw an old Letraset catalogue that had a rounded DIN typeface
    in it. Funny stuff.    <BR>Just thought I&#39;d mention this. If I&#39;m really
    lucky I can get hold of a scan from the catalogue someday. <BR>:|

    target="_blank">Macarena DT Bold</a>, perhaps a bit condensed?

  body: I was also wondering what it was when I saw it , as it is very similar to
    Chevin, &#40;Din-like proportions, but straight-sided curved characters, CDGOQ,
    and rounded&#41;, but not so totally monolinear. <BR> <BR>I&#39;d be interested
    to find out too! <BR> <BR>G-Type through Veer.

  body: Macarena is close too, but the &#34;O&#34; is still too round. Hmmm.

    obscure that it is under the powerful typofile radar <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"
