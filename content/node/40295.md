body: "Hi,\r\nI am trying to put together an all-star classis/retro alphabet and I
  am very interested in some ideas from you. What is your favourite A, K, Ampersand
  etc.\r\n\r\nWork in progress just did it http://www.workinprogressblog.com/?cat=11,
  but I think it would be cool to make a better one, which shouldn't be a problem,
  with a little help from all you expert fontheads : )\r\n\r\nI enclosed a picture
  of the letters I have done so far, just to give you an idea of where I want to go
  with this, but it is very far from done.\r\nAs you can see, most of it is already
  custom-made, so it doesn't have to be an existing font. It can be a scan from an
  old magazine etc. Anything goes!\r\n\r\n\r\n// Mark"

  body: "If it is illegal, I won't do it, but as you can see in the enclosed jpg,
    it is mostly custom-made letters at the moment and I only want to use fonts and
    scans for inspiration. I still can't see how that can be illegal. If i was using
    20 or more different fonts in a design assignment, it wouldnt be illegal, and
    that would even be profitable which this project isn't.\r\nThe main reason I want
    to do it, is for educational purposes. I thought it would be very interesting
    to hear what people's favourite letters etc. is, and maybe make a costum font
    based on that information.\r\n\r\nSo please start spilling some font-wisdom :

    issue. The clearest problem would be if someone took another digital font and
    used a glyph as the base for one of your letters, but taking inspiration from
    others' type is more than okay.\r\n\r\nEDIT: And in a more helpful vein, there
    are actually several threads on Typophile that have been about favorite letters,
    favorite ampersands, favorite characters in a favorite font, etc. A Google search
    of Typophile for \"favorite letter\" and the like should turn up some good results."

    His isn't a selection of favorite characters but simply characters from all his
    typefaces, but it may be useful nevertheless.

    copied a letter' pop-up.\r\n\r\nEven if this was literally taking the best letter
    from 26 commercial fonts and putting them in to an 'all-star' face, I don't see
    how that really is a big deal. It seems to be an homage done for fun...not profit
    in any way. It's fun. \r\n\r\nYea, yea, any of the foundries could make a stink
    if they wanted to, and they'd probably be within their rights, but I can't possibly
    see how Lubalin has any intention of doing anything malicious here (at least based
    on what I've read in this thread.)\r\n\r\nI'm not against protecting copyright...I

    1981. Besides that though, I'm not sure what \"wisdom\" is required spilling of,
    nor what \"fun\" there is in making/using Ransom Note fonts, as opposed to, for
    example \u2014 the study of, use of, and discourse upon whole alphabets, which
    is mostly what most of us do most of the time. \r\n\r\nCheers!"

    see not violating copyright of others as a creative challenge. Just as I consider
    not copping another's ideas to solve my own problems.\r\n\r\nLast, if this is

    Song remixes are too. Sampling, I guess. \r\nIf the final form of a 'collage'
    were whole or part of previous works not owned by the 'artist' but given to the
    viewer to make a collage \u2014 is that 'giving' a 'valid art form'? ;-. \r\n\r\nI
    like this work by the way, the letters in composition are well worth looking at.
    If one were to say, let's make squares out of our favorite letters and talk about
    'em, I might think otherwise. But an 'homage' ransom note font would not be so
    unless each person who viewed or used it knew, or could find from the work itself
    who made each letter, would it?\r\n\r\nCheers!\r\n\r\n\r\n"
