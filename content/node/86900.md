body: "Hello,\r\n\r\nRecently I have bought CorelDraw 8 Academic box in a local secondhand
  bookshop for a few Swiss Franks. It comes with tons of Bitstream fonts. I like especially
  several and want to use them for correspondence - briefs/writings (up to 5 pages)
  to local authorities, organizations, etc. \r\n\r\nThe fonts I want to use:\r\n\r\n(Caslon
  Old Face)\r\n(Charter BT)\r\nClassical Garamond (Sabon)\r\nElegant Garamond (Granjon)\r\nGalliard
  BT\r\nIowan Old Style\r\nOriginal Garamond (Stempel Garamond)\r\n\r\nGothic720 (MT
  Grotesque?)\r\nHumanist 531 (Syntax)\r\n(Humanist777 (Frutiger) )\r\nZurich (Univers)\r\n\r\nConsidering
  the Swiss use almost only sans serif fonts (Arial/Helvetica) for briefs, would it
  be a good practice\r\n\r\n- to use a serif font as the main font?\r\n- to use a
  sans-serif and a serif font in combination?\r\n\r\nIf yes, would you please be so
  kind to recommend a few combinations with the above fonts?\r\n\r\nThank you in advance!"

  body: "All these are not really suited for correspondence, imo. The least objectionable
    is Frutiger, followed by Syntax, if you really want a sans. Amongst the serifs
    Charter might work (a lot of the others are too meagre or light or just plain
    ugly).\r\n\r\nBTW I answered your question because nobody else did for three days,
    which may signify a certain disinterest amongst the Typophiles regarding the subject.\r\n\r\nOn
    another note: If you were to design a personal identity, even using some of these
    typefaces, you could broaden that to include correspondence etc. and it might
    work because of being part of a larger thing. In the way the smart car uses courier
    for everything."
