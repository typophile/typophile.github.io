    I love the posters from the Berlin olympics. There's also that other one with
    the horse and that delicious geometric sans face."

  body: Finding a splayed M might be the clincher. I wonder if Red Rooster doesn't
    have something similar.

  body: "The first poster's lettering reminds me of Schneidler Initials, the basis
    of Jason Castle's <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/castletype/shango/\">Shango</a>.\r\n\r\nThe
    others with the sans lettering remind me of Optima, which I know was designed
    later, or one of Koch's lineales from the 30's, like Offenbach (see Jaspert for
    a sample).\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
