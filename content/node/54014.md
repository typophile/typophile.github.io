    and studies without typography.\r\n\r\nI once had \"formal\" (by which I meant
    relating to physical form in an aesthetic sense) translated into Polish as \"official\".\r\nIf
    you don't speak a language, a good way to check a translation is to have it returned
    to the original language. Just once, if you keep going, you end up with something
    like the specimen text on my web site :-)"
