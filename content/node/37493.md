body: "Didn't know if this was the place for this, but here goes anyway. I need the
  font Sackers Gothic for a letterhead (customer only had printed piece, scan not
  good enough). I know it's a pay font but my boss is being a tight-ass and won't
  pay for it. Is there a good (and I mean spot-on good) freeware font that anyone
  knows about that I could use? Difficulty: Engravers Gothic and Trade Gothic not
  close enough.  Thanks for the help.\r\n\r\nWillCore"

  body: The font is 24 dollars at Fonts.com - If client wants it - bill him, otherwise
    suggest font you already own.

  body: Yeah, that's where I'm headed with this. Minimum interaction with clients
    on my end is always a plus, but I really have no choice in the matter. Thanks.
