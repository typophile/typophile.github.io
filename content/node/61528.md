  to rework the personal identity I started when I made this site http://www.pentapus.net\r\n\r\nThe
  site itself needs to be redone completely after 3 years but I want to start with
  a solid type based logo. I looked at several heavy display faces*. I am hoping for
  a modern take on a blackletter/gothic/serif face**.\r\n\r\nAny help would be great
  especially nit picking\r\n\r\n*the godfather logo\r\n** S's  are hard"

    the web page.\r\nThe mixture of the free swirling ink and the serif fornt is very
    pleasing and evocative of a gothic whimsy.\r\n\r\nWill"

  body: "Perhaps I am just bored of the old design. The type for the logo on the site
    is a deconstruction of Garamond (my favorite face).\r\n\r\nIs the original better
    or is this logo simply not striking anyone's interest?\r\nMy feeling is that this
    new logo is more unique and more memorable. \r\n\r\nAm I wrong?\r\n"

  body: "New logo looks like a tattoo shop identity to me, and in this it <em>is</em>
    inferior to the current one. Not sure though if the current logo is just the type
    or if it includes the swirly graphics too. If it is not latter, it should be :)
    because the combination looks absolutely awesome and strikes all the right notes.\r\n\r\nAlso,
    unrelated, did you create the actual Kinder's logo or was it something under their
    existing brand ?"

  body: "Thats unfortunate, I thought I was on the right path.\r\nThe black ink swirls
    and the type come together with the icon of the Pentapus (octopus minus 3 legs).
    That essentially becomes the brand \"Pentapus\". Together they frame my site as
    well as my resume and business card.\r\n\r\n@epsilicon - Oh no Kinder is an existing
    brand of chocolates and candy, This was a small print piece explaining one of
    their products. \r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: "I'd agree that the new version is bolder and more solid but there is one
    thing that disturbes the overall impression. The serifs are inconsistent and appear
    a bit arbitrary. Especially on the baseline they don't seem to fit. Some of them
    are pointing to the right and some are pointing to the left and some (\"n\" and
    \"u\") are just too different to suit the others.\r\n\r\nWhen looking at the \"Godfather-Logo\"
    (which you've mentioned in your opening comment) I think that establishing a consistent
    stroke-weight might help the wordmark to feel more balanced. E.g. the stems of
    your \"n\" have two different weights and both of them are different to the weight
    of the stem of your \"t\" -> this causes too much confusion in my opinion.\r\n\r\nTo
    summarize my comment: The single letters don't work as a whole but with more consistency
    (serfis, stroke-weight) you might be able to let them work."
