body: "Would it be too presumptuous to ask for a moratorium on editing your posts
  until that feature is fixed? You see, when you edit your post it changes the time
  stamp causing the flow of the conversation to change quite a bit as well. I mean,
  a quick edit seconds after your initial post is one thing, but going back even 5
  minutes later can cause a break in conversation and confusion for those who read
  the posts later.\r\n\r\nThank you for considering the proposal.\r\n\r\nI've posted
  this in the GENERAL DISCUSSIONS area instead of my BLOG because I know some of you
  do not use the tracker to follow Typophile."

  body: "Which is fine in most fora, but when one is doing type IDs, the usual protocol
    is to post a message with \"this is zorfnorblegurp\" and then go off and search
    for the appropriate link to prove that, indeed, the type truly is zorfnorblegurp.\r\n\r\nAnd
    that's rather problematic when dealing with a turgid server that adjusts posting
    order based on time, particularly for the competitive Type IDers.\r\n\r\nNot that
    I would know any.\r\n\r\nOr recognize one in the mirror in the morning.\r\n\r\nEven
    if one lived near me."

    downgrade the site, develop the new version until it's sufficiently stable and
    functionality rich, TEST and then upgrade back to new version</strong>. If you
    move to faster server in between, even better. I'm starting to not like this site
    anymore because of all the bugs... I'm really sorry. It's almost more pain than
    pleasure."

  body: I am a poor typist. I'm not necesarily a bad prson, or even bad at spelling.
    However, I often think that my keyboarding skills cause people to disregard my
    overall message. I hope thisis fixed soon, because I often need to edit posts.
    Hrant is right.I have no idea what is happneing. I hope that users are expected
    to make mistakes.

    version too. I know I'm not alone in saying that. Even without the IM feature,
    there's been a lot of behind the scenes grumbling.\r\n\r\nA quote (anonymous)
    from another typophile: \r\n\"it's not as much fun anymore. and i don't know why,
    exactly. i didn't use the IM all that much. i didn't even use the search extensively

    used to have (even without the IM that I didn't use at all) and did I mention
    it's slower? ;)\r\n\r\nMy experience is like this: I used to have a tab with Typophile's
    site open all the time. Now I just close it when I get so ... you know what...
    And since I'm also a developer I know this is really bad. <strong>REALLY BAD</strong>."

  body: "I always thought Typophile had a bit of a lag to it, even the previous version.
    I would usually sign in, go to my account and check my contributed topics (this
    had the longest loading times) before going back to the front page to see what's
    new and hot.\r\n\r\nI still do this, but now I don't really feel like checking
    out the news/hot topics as much. I can't put my finger on it, but there's something
    overwhelming about that front page. The Flash seems intrusive compared to the
    previous version; which was just slightly intrusive. The animated logo is annoying
    (and if you go to any other page, it looks like a ? not a T), the topic headers
    are too bold and appear slightly blurry (I'm on a Windows machine with Cleartype
    turned on), not to mention the issue with the editing comments. \r\n\r\nI do like
    some of the changes though. I like the expanding comment box, the ticker on the
    front that lists the latest comments, the user icons at the bottom, the multiple
    page link in the original post, and the fact that the links at the very top are
    all available.\r\n\r\nI've been waiting for an update to this site for a while,
    and I'm glad it's finally arrived, I just think it might have been too much all
    at once. It's upset the natural order of things and the adjustments are a bit
    of a shock. Changes is good, I applaud the efforts. I just think it might have
    been to much in too little without a proper feedback period.\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Well not to hammer the point home, but (to me) the improvements are not immediately
    obvious, not that significant, and way counterbalanced by the features lost and
    the slowness/bugginess.\r\n\r\nI realize the wiki improvements are important to
    a lot of people but as someone who mainly frequents the forums, I'd happily give
    up the icon parade and the expanding comment box to have a more user-friendly
    site back.\r\n\r\nI also NEVER go to the home page (I bookmark the Type ID forum),
    and don't like flash in general so that's all lost on me."

    who work behind the scenes on Typophile, contribute their spare, unbillable time,
    mostly in the wee hours of the night and early morning before office hours. Because
    of this, we aren't able to make changes as quickly as we'd like -- this upgrade
