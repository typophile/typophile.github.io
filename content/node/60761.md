  something similar to the \"SURE\" at the top. In particular, I love the proportions
  and shape of the \"R.\"\r\n\r\nAny suggestions?\r\n\r\nThanks!"

  body: "There are a group of typefaces from the early 20th century that I usually
    look at with questions about this time period. Five of them start with P (Pabst,
    Powell, Poor Richard, Packard and Parsons) and two others are Artcraft and Colwell.\r\n\r\n-
