  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">John Daggett from Mozilla, who is the editor of the <a href="http://dev.w3.org/csswg/css3-fonts/">CSS3 Fonts Module</a>, will be in Los Angeles for a few days preceding this year's <a href="http://www.typecon.com/">TypeCon</a> conference. I'm working with John and the TypeCon organisers to hold a briefing/dialogue session on web typography in CSS3 on Wednesday 18 August, at the <a href="http://www.typecon.com/hotel.php">conference venue</a> in LA.

The purpose of this session is for John to explain the new typographic features in CSS3 — including access to a large number of OpenType Layout features — and to get feedback from font developers and from typographically aware web designers. This is a good opportunity for members of the type community to help improve the CSS3 Fonts Module standard. Previous criticisms of the draft standard from font developers have noted that the terminology used in the specification differs from that commonly used by type designers and typographers, and hence is confusing, so one thing that could be achieved at this session is review of that terminology. As other browser makers will be present in LA for the preceding W3C Web Fonts Working Group meeting, there may also be an opportunity to discuss CSS3 implementations

I'm currently thinking in terms of a half-day session, most likely in the afternoon, but this plan has not been finalised. In order to determine logistics for this event, the TypeCon organisers need to get a sense of how many people to expect. If you are interested in attending this session, please indicate so in this thread or, if you prefer, contact me at tiro[at]tiro[dot]com.

<strong>Please note: this session is not for discussion of web font formats or licensing. There will be at least one session devoted to web fonts during the main conference programme. This session is focused on CSS3 typography.</strong>

Please also note that this session will take place at the same time as some of the pre-conference workshops. Please be aware of a possible conflict if you have signed up for a workshop or are planning to.

The intention is for this session to be free, but for planning purposes we really do need to know in advance if you are planning to attend.</div>

Richard - FWIW - my plan is to take notes, photos, and record what is said, too - the last thing happening only if nobody minds.

@davidberlow

A more freewheeling approach than what you describe is hardly "without purpose". However, I think one-day conferences of the <em>kind</em> you describe - focused exclusively on type and typography - will probably be in substantial demand in a few years.

a) John Daggett won't be around for the TypeCon conference; he's coming to LA for the W3C WG meeting on the Tuesday, and leaving on the Thursday;

b) there's an opportunity for people who are interested in providing input on a specific part of the CSS3 standard to meet with him on the Wednesday;

c) its a technical meeting, not a dog and pony show.
___

What TypeCon are organising for the conference itself in terms of web fonts is in preliminary planning stages. The programme on the website suggests that I'm going to give a short presentation on WOFF, which was news to me and, I'm pretty sure, not the case. I suspect Tal and Erik will be giving that presentation, and that Chris Lilley from the W3C, who is not mentioned in the online programme, will be talking about the W3C web font standard. I expect the format of these sessions will become a lot more organised and structured once the various participants have an opportunity to discuss them and make a plan.

Lol, you can say that again. I understand there are three sessions John, the point is general; the people who know are all there, from near and far, and there are a LOT of questions unanswered from here and there, recently and from the past. 

The history of most of these sessions, CSS or not, is tinted by post-panel depression, as in no one can answer the questions after, in fact most people don't understand much more than when they arrived.

That's no guarantee that you'll get an answer, let alone an answer that you like,  but as you say the people who know -- or whom we hope know -- will (mostly) be there.

If there are questions you have for John Daggett and other CSS3 session participants, I'll be happy to field them for you.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Thanks Chris. 

To Christalize the headline issue as I see it: we now have the TT font format pared down to the capabilities of the T1 format circa 1985, being stuffed into a 2010 wrapper with no improvements on anything helpful to users, (if you don't understand that, just look carefully). 

I think we'll need more than bread and circuses to get out of the swamp. It'd be interesting to hear what people think the solutions are.

Is that the T1 fonts with 16-bit and 32-bit character encoding, up to 65536 glyph per font, smart layout features for non-Latin scripts, and coming up -- the focus of the CSS3 Font Module session -- smart layout features for rich typography? I don't remember those T1 fonts.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">If all you care about is the rendering control (and not encoding and layout features), then the big advantage of TrueType was that you could get relatively consistent results in terms of bi-level bitmap patterns regardless of the OS and TrueType rasterizer - whereas Adobe was in the habit of "improving" the output of the PostScript rasterizer. Obviously that changed big time with OS X, Freetype and ClearType. </div>

The CSS3 Font Module pre-conference session will take place on Wednesday 18 August, beginning at 2:00pm. We will officially end at 5:00pm, but if people want to stay longer to keep a discussion going, that should be possible.

The session will take place at the TypeCon conference hotel.
http://www.typecon.com/hotel.php

The room will be posted on the day.

There is no fee to attend this session, and now that the room size is confirmed there is no need to register interest in attending. Drop-ins welcome.

The session will take place in the ‘Westside’ room on the plaza level of the conference hotel.

John Daggett will begin the session with an approx. 45 minute presentation on the CSS3 Font Module, covering

<ul>
<li>CSS3 Font spec overview</li>
<li>basic font properties (family name, style matching, size)</li>
<li>@font-face mechanism</li>
<li>layout feature support</li>
<li>testing and conformance</li>
<li>font security issues</li>
<li>ideas beyond CSS3 Fonts</li>
</ul>

Following this, there will be open discussion on these and related topics. If you already have a question you would like to ask or a topic you want to discuss, you can post it here so that John will have some idea what to expect. I've already told him that I want to discuss possible CSS mechanisms for ppem-specific outline selection.</div>

How did you go about capturing and repurposing that for the Kindle? I have not yet found a simple way to do it while keeping the graphics intact (emailing to my Kindle gets the file converted without the graphics). Maybe it's just because I haven't figured out the MobiPocket Creator software yet.

looks great after a page or two of garbage.

Of course if all else fails one can "print" a PDF from the browser and just use that, but you know the Kindle limitations with PDFs (although it's still the best reader for PDFs).

And you should see the new iteration - already out in the DX, and

2 days after I bought mine... although I got a good deal on it, plus
I get to use it during TypeCon! Also, I don't like the new keyboard.

This does not make sense. According to <a href="http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/nc20100113pc.html" target="_blank">this article</a>, the resolution is 150ppi, with 16 shades of grey, which is not so terribly much. And the FreeType samples provided <a href="http://typophile.com/node/70216#comment-424626" target="_blank">over here</a> look pretty impressive. So at best it is a combination of both.

Kindle’s new, high-contrast display is further optimized with Amazon’s proprietary waveform and font technology to make pages turn faster and fonts sharper. Waveform is a series of electronic pulses that move black and white electronic ink particles to achieve a final gray level for an image or text. We have tuned Kindle's waveform and controller mechanism to make page turning 20% faster. This waveform tuning, combined with new hand-built, custom fonts and font-hinting, make words and letters more crisp, clear, and natural-looking. Font hints are instructions, written as code, that control points on a font character's line and improve legibility at small font sizes where few pixels are available. Hinting is a mix of aesthetic judgments and complicated technical strategies. We've designed our proprietary font-hinting to optimize specifically for the special characteristics of electronic ink."</div>

Damn - missed the boat.

BTW, did they do this in-house?!
If not, who did it for them?

sii -- <cite>hand-built, custom fonts and font-hinting</cite>

Interesting. I am curious for details too.
As regards the hand-built, custom fonts and font-hinting, I assume that PDFs which come with their own fonts are a another story though.
(Hand-built is lovely. I don't know of any font that is not hand-built.)&nbsp;&nbsp;:)

Well, any type that can be rendered at a predictable PPEM can be "hand-made" (more below) and Kindle has a -very useful- "Actual Size" zoom level, so...

> I don't know of any font that is not hand-built.

:-)
Of course you're right, but the fact that an outline is only ever merely a "request", with software deciding what bitmap the viewer actually sees... It is only when you directly control the pixels* that what the viewer sees is truly hand-made.

* At least to their maximum technical potential - nobody is going to be able to design for the organic blobs that make up a Kindle screen deep down.
