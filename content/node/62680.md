  body: "What Monotype is actually doing is making use of Google's ad service which
    places ads based on keywords, i.e. advertisements for fonts get placed on webpages
    dealing with fonts. But Google has no automatic way of knowing whether a given
    website dealing with fonts is a pirate site or a legitimate site. So by all means
    write to Monotype and alert them to their ads appearing on a pirate site: they
    can then contact Google and have that site added to a blacklist of sites on which
    their ads should not appear. It's not as if Monotype have gone out and deliberately
    paid the pirate site to host their ads.\r\n\r\nI think the Google ad model as
    currently implemented is very problematic. The non-Internet equivalent would be
    putting an ad on a sandwich board but then not giving the guy carrying the board
    any directions about where to walk in the city, and only after someone spots him
    standing in front of a brothel next to people doing a heroin deal telling him
    not to go down that street."

    windowsfonts which, I must assume, is a \"pirate\" site which you have now plugged
    by adding a link to it on Typophile.\r\nAre we being punk'd here or what? Is this
    a lesson in irony? ;)"

  body: They have a lot of the usual free fonts there. I was surprised to find those
    3 House Industries fonts there. Indeed, House does currently give away 3 free
    fonts, but not those three. The poster is currently a member for 1 day 10 hours.
