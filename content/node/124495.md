body: "What are the origins of the exuberant swash letters that can be found on the
  windows of many of Amsterdam\u2019s most traditional bars? Who painted them? Was
  it a collective creation, or the work of a lone gifted letter painter? How old is
  the style?\r\nFor almost a decade Ramiro Espinoza (www.re-type.com) thoroughly researched
  this lettering style and documented every surviving example in Amsterdam, Maastricht
  and Ghent in an effort to answer these questions and raise awareness of the importance
  of this little known chapter of the Dutch graphical tradition.\r\nIn beautiful black
  and white, photographer Rob Becker documented all existing windows in Amsterdam,
  Maastricht and Ghent in order to capture the ambience and context in which the curly
  script flourished. His photos are not only a report of the topic in general, but
  they also form a true artistic homage to the Amsterdam \u2018brown\u2019 caf\xE9s.
