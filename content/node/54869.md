    no idea what they are calling it now.  Just search him out on the web and you
    will find this.\r\n\r\nMichael"

  body: "Indeed it looks quite close to Koch Antiqua (<a href=\"http://www.bleisetzer.de/cms/front_content.php?idcat=57&idart=471\">original
    metal version here</a>, click on the image to enlarge) but there are some notable
    small differences, like the stroke contrast in the \"y\". Oops I just burned my
    dinner researching that.\r\n\r\nFWIW, there is a <a href=\"http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/adobe/koch-antiqua/\">digitization
    by Linotype</a>."

    Locarno is similar, but not identical.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
