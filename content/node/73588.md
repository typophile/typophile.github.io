  principle is quite simple, I guess there are many similar type faces, but I hope
  no identical one.\r\n\r\nFeedback and critique is very welcome.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/display_6179.png]\r\n\r\nBest
  wishes, mike\r\n\r\nEdit: Updated image."

    f most, so they should be in the name. At the moment I'm tending towards \"floxx\",
    although it has no real meaning; but it is close to \"flux\" which I think would
    fit well, but is for sure not free.\r\n\r\ngreets mike"

  body: "Neat. Are you going to do capitals?\r\n\r\nI think it's interesting and good
    that the digits treat diagonals differently than the letters do. But I think the
    4 looks oddly narrow. I would elongate the horizontal some, moving the pieces
    that go with either end along with them, even though it takes them off the grid.
    Or pull it out one whole bigpixel and remove the beak."

  body: "Thank you for your comment.\r\n\r\nNew image above, some more symbols to
    comment ;-)\r\n\r\nI gave the 4 a little more room, but I think it's good to stick
    to the alignment of the pieces.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure if/when I will add capitals,
    the point is, I don't think that they will respect the same look. So I will test
    some and if not, there could be alternate glyphs, e.g. with the opposite construction
    principle or something like that.\r\n\r\ngreets mike\r\n"

    to break your rule: It looks just as much like \u20A4 (lira, often used as an
    alternate form of \xA3 pound sterling). They are used in the exact same context,
    so people will not be entirely sure which it is supposed to be."

  body: "Thank you cerulean.\r\n\r\nI don't know, if breaking the principle is really
    the right way. It is a fun font, so when the \u20AC sign is used it may be on
    a flyer for a party or something like that and not a text discussing currencies...
    So, is there really a high potential that people will misinterpret it? The sign
    will always be used in context, that helps a lot... \r\n\r\nWell, of course it's
    easy to have an opentype alternative ;-)\r\n\r\ngreets mike"
