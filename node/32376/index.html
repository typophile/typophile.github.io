		<div class="commentbody"><p>To change the Chlorine &ldquo;a&rdquo; you could redraw the &ldquo;serif&rdquo; to angle it away from the letter or turn it at a right angle, making it more prominent. I would use more leading than you have and for the longest truth turn over &ldquo;what&rdquo; so &ldquo;what kind&rdquo; is on one line and centre on the height of the lozenge, and draw up an apostrophe.</p>
<p>From a technical point of view you should create a lefthand and righthand version of the advertisement, currently your layout would almost work for a recto (righthand page) but if used as a verso the dares, logo and pictures would be partially obscured by the binding, (I say almost because most magazines will specify a safe type area which will be approximately 20mm less than the printed dimensions to take into account of trimming).</p>
<p>The various elements are somewhat disconnected, I would be tempted to move the headline and arrow element up and make the body copy more prominent and larger and to the same measure as the headline and turn over the lines to represent the meaning better.</p>
<p>As for mixing up typefaces there are no rules, essentially you can easily use two or three typefaces in this instance, for example, a display face for the headings, a text face for the body copy and another for the dares – I wouldn’t mix similar typefaces, say, a pair of humanist sans or a pair of venetian serifs (although it can be done), it really is down to looking at combinations and making your own judgement. In this case however I think you are better off using one and making that work well.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Chlorine works on a level (because it has no uppercase, extended body copy will not be the best but in this limited situation it should be fine) it is a mixture of fun and techno and fits my appreciation of the demographic and your triangle.</p>
<p>Leading is crucial in all situations, the default 20% of Quark and, I believe, InDesign is sufficient for many typefaces in most text settings but when working with a free font and all that brings with it in terms of kerning and spacing, you should apply your own leading and kerning because at the moment the leading is way too tight, I cannot see the kerning clearly enough to comment. As for the turn overs in the body copy I would make the last three sentences of your body single lines (or paragraphs) and break the first sentence to suit the line length you create. btw I think you are missing an &ldquo;are&rdquo; in the second last sentence.</p>
