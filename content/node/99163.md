  known as the Vilna typeface. The most popular Vilna typeface was rhat of the Romm
  family printing press. Legend has it that Mr. Romm senior traveled to Italy, and
  commissioned the students of Bodoni to cut ancient drawings of this special letter
  form into the popular Hebrew typefaces, known as Vilna Romm.\r\n\r\nBelow are examples
  of Vilna typefaces, including Vilna Romm."

    Even presuming that you are referring to the style of writing and not to a 'typeface'
    per se, this is a relatively late and specifically Ashkenazi style. It's known
    as the Vilna style because of its association with the famous edition of the Talmud
    printed at Vilnius in the 1870s, which in Jewish historical terms is only yesterday."

  body: "Israel: <em>for over a thousand years</em> \r\n\r\nJohn: <em>You're overestimating
    quite a bit!</em>  \r\n\r\nJohn,\r\n\r\nThe classic style of writing used by Ashkenazic
    typesetters & printers, and earlier by scribes, is really very old. It may actually
    have Sephardic origins!\r\n\r\nThe Talmud discusses a 'square letter form' used
    for handwritten texts distributed in scroll form. In Rochester, NY I saw first
    hand manuscripts that featured the 'square letter form', which was very similar
    to the classic Vilna typeface. Also, we see in the Dead Sea Scrolls housed in
    Jerusalem and by the US Army, a very different square letter form was used by
    the Dead Sea Scroll scribes for the non-Biblical content, albeit not similar to
    the classic Vilna style.\r\n\r\nThis was at the Rochester Institute of Technology
    (RIT), which houses one of the largest collection of Hebrew books and manuscripts
    in the world. I believe Hebrew Union College in Cincinnati, and the Jewish Theological
    Seminary (JTS) in Manhattan, have larger collections. The largest is in Paris.\r\n\r\nFrederick
    Goudy writes in one of his many books that the father of the Romm family, later
    the famous publishers of the classic and most popular version of the Talmud in
    Vilna, took ancient manuscripts (which he purchased at very great expense) to
    the students of Bodoni in Italy at the beginning of the 19th century. Hence, we
    see that the classic Vilna type design existed much before metal typefaces.\r\n\r\nIf
    these manuscripts were similar to what the Talmud describes as a 'square letter
    form', then over 1,000 year is not an exaggeration, but rather an understatement
    (for the content of the Talmud is over 2,000 years old - see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talmud
    - \"The Talmud ... (c. 500 CE), [is] an elucidation of the Mishnah and related
    Tannaitic writings that often ventures onto other subjects and expounds broadly
    on the Hebrew Bible\".\r\n\r\nThere is an excellent index to the Soncino Talmud,
    published to this day by Judaica Press www.judaicapress.com and www.soncinopress.com.
    You can look it up there."

  body: "My understanding is that what the Talmud refers to as 'square letters' is
    a generic term for the Aramaic alphabet adopted by the Jews during the Babylonian
    exile, and is a term used to distinguish this script from the earlier Canaanite
    style that Solomon Birnbaum called Palaeo-Hebrew.\r\n\r\nThe style of the Vilna
    types are exactly what one would expect the students of Bodoni to produce in the
    early 19th Century, regardless of what one gave them as a model. They clearly
    display the characteristic stroke modulation patterns of a steel split nib pen,
    a writing implement that did not exist 1,000 years ago. These modulation patterns
    are the hallmark of all Bodoni's types regardless of script; one sees the same
    thing in his Greek, his Cyrillic, etc.. I have numerous books on mediaeval Hebrew
    palaeography, and there is nothing in them that resembles the characteristics
    of the Vilna style in this respect. The basic structure of the Hebrew letter shapes
    were certainly well established in the Middle Ages, but the particular character
    of the Vilna style must be seen as a 19th Century innovation based on contemporary
    European writing tools and practices."

    amongst other, with the Drugulin (which is based on:) & the Vilna types.\r\nwhat
    is the source of that legend you mentioned about Romm Senior?\r\ncan you please
    attach the original type sample of the Vilna Letters? i would be thankful, it
    would help me alot."

  body: The story is recorded in a book by Frederik Goudy. I read it in the early
    90s, but no longer recall the title. I likely borrowed it from the RIT type library.
    The type sample of the Vilna Letters is found above in GH B Vilna-Romm Regular.
