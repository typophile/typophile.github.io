    If it is, hope somebody finds it for you.\r\nThe distinctive _g_ originated with

  body: Agree with Don, definitely based on Cheltenham. Other option would be to start
    with Mark Simonson's [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/marksimonson/bookmania|Bookmania]]
    to get some decorated alternates (/[[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/marksimonson/bookmania/italic/glyphs.html#glyphs/519890/1361|a]],
    /[[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/marksimonson/bookmania/italic/glyphs.html#glyphs/519890/1434|e]],
    /[[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/marksimonson/bookmania/italic/glyphs.html#glyphs/519890/1794|r]],
    /[[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/marksimonson/bookmania/italic/glyphs.html#glyphs/519890/1885|t]])
    and "borrow" swash style of [[http://www.typography.com/fonts/hoefler-titling|Hoefler
    Titling]].
