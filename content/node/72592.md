    Magazine design? (and what kind of magazine?) Poster design? (I'm sure there are
    variables here, too) Web design? etc. \r\n\r\nFor example, *if* Adobe Garamond
    was the most popular font for book interiors, I'll bet you anything it wasn't
    for any other print medium.\r\n\r\nThe only answer you could come up with would
    be \"number of sales,\" and that would reflect the sales during a year. People
    who had purchased the font earlier wouldn't need to buy it; wouldn't show up."

    list...\r\n\r\nAkzidenz Grotesk\r\nDIN Mittelschrift in its various incarnations\r\nGotham\r\nNeutraface\r\n\r\nI
    am sure other folks can add to the list..."

  body: I thought Helvetica was used quite often for long by designers in graphic
    design and now I feel that Bodoni is getting lot of attention in design world.
    Any thoughts?
