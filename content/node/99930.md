body: "Hi all,\r\n\r\nI've been asked by a friend to ID the font used for the text
  in this screenshot. It's from a companion app to a game client on Windows 7 (my
  friend works for the games company - I think this is a case of mislaid-resource-archaeology).
  I don't think it's Arial just from the way the b and d render, but could be wrong.\r\n\r\nI
  don't have a copy of Windows at hand to check how fonts render to produce this result,
  so I'd greatly appreciate some help in identifying it.\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\nAegir"

      does look to be an exact match though.\r\n\r\nThanks again."

  body: It's more likely to be Arial, rendered at 12 ppem (9pt) with no anti-aliasing.
    At that size the 'b' and 'd' render the same as in the sample.

  body: "Exact match? What about the \"N\"?\r\nJustin is probably correct.\r\n\r\nAs
    for C&C Red Alert, if you note certain strange things (like the warped \"x\",
    the closed Euro, etc.) I'm guessing it's a quick auto-trace of Arial's rendering.
    In fact I think Pyrus had (still has?) a utility that makes pixelfonts based on
    outline font screen renderings. If so, C&C Red Alert wouldn't exactly be totally
    ethical, although we certainly have bigger fish to fry...\r\n\r\nBTW Aegir, in
    case a pixelfont might be useful, and your friend wants something that renders
    anti-aliased but super-clean, ask him to check out my Mana series:\r\nhttp://www.themicrofoundry.com/manademo/\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
