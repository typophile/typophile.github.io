body: "Hi\r\n\r\nMy new font is currently on the MyFonts staging site and contextual
  alternates are not showing up correctly.  There are a fair amount of ignore subs
  and OpenType classes in play so it's complicated code, but it works fine in all
  programs I've tested it in - even Notepad!  I notice that a few fonts on MyFonts
  with alternates don't always seem to display correctly.  Anyone else had a problem
  with this, and know which code in particular the test drive doesn't recognise?\r\n\r\nCheers\r\nDave\r\n"

    helpful and haven't bitten me yet...

  body: I've emailed them - just thought I'd check in here to see if it's a problem
    I can fix quickly.  I get the impression that the MyFonts engine doesn't display
    certain OpenType substitutions correctly.  When you notice it in Sudtipos fonts
    you know it's not bad OpenType code that's to blame!

  body: "Yes, I've noticed the ignore bits of my Ambicase fonts' code are, um, ignored,
    so you can't get a decent preview of the Swash setting with initial and final
    forms, etc.\r\nFontShop's OpenType preview acknowledges those lines more successfully
    (though it isn't without its quirks too)."

  body: Reply from MyFonts is that there are problems with contextual substitutions
    that affect all fonts, and they are waiting for a fix from their development group.

  body: "Yes, my contextual (start/end) swashes also don't work there - every letter
    is swashed. \r\nBut I put all my code in general \"Swash\", not \"Contextual Swash\"
    feature. \r\nWorks everywhere else."
