  and I want to create ads using the same font (or something very similar) as the
  script font that is used on some of her book covers. Here is the title of her next
  book, A Fool's Gold Christmas, in the font. The same font (I believe) is used on
  the covers of her books Already Home and Barefoot Season, if you need to see other
  letters. Any ideas?\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/a-fg-christmas_5377.jpg]"
