body: "Hi guys,\r\nI'm kinda creatively stuck and can't seem to find a good solution,
  so I thought I might ask youm, the experts. \r\nI have a website that I'm putting
  together very minimal, the main copy is Arial and I'm looking for a nice simple
  preferably sans serif font for menus and headlines to go with it. the website is
  fashion oriented so I'm trying to find something that has personality. I was also
  considering Slabserif (Jubilat or Archer) but my preference is really sans. \r\nDo
  you have any thoughts or ideas as to what could work? it should also have different
  weights and italics as well as being CE or multilingual. \r\n\r\nAny feedback is
  appreciated :)\r\n\r\nThank you,\r\nMichal"

    |Hairline Archer]] or [[http://www.houseind.com/index.php?page=showfont&id=4&subpage=viewfonts
    | Chalet]] may fit the bill.
