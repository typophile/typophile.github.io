  body: ' An excellent first issue. Energy and love of type bursting off the PDF!  <BR>I
    think Stephane must need some help with translation from French to English and
    vice versa for future issues. Any bilingual French/English speakers here? '

  body: Yep, exactly. i&#39;m in need of a good translator french/english  english/french.
    I tried to do it by myself and a canadian friend helped me too, but it&#39;s not
    perfect. <BR> <BR>Btw, the Eric de Berranger interview is only in french and it&#39;s
    a problem. It&#39;s a great designer and English people have to hear what he had
    to say ! <BR> <BR>so, any help is needed and welcome to translations, articles,
    types presentation, artworks, pdf spreading etc etc... <BR> <BR>;&#41; i&#39;ll
    do the best for the 2nd issue <BR> <BR>--Steph

    font world, I&#39;ve done some stuff for Thierry Puyfoulhoux &#40;Pr&eacute;sence
    Typo&#41; and ATypI. But more than a paragraph or two at a time I&#39;d have to
    charge for. <BR> <BR>hhp '

    next issue and use Distiller to create the PDF - better results, more control,
    smaller files. '
