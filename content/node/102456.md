body: In the April 7th 2013 issue of New York Times Magazine, they use a rounded-condensed
  Sans Serif that has square tops (sorry for the incorrect terminology) on the capital
  A. Anyone know what this is or who makes it? (See attached image)[img:sites/default/files/old-images/type_ex1_5435.jpg]
