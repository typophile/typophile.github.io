body: "Hi,\r\n\r\nWe're developing several unicode/opentype fonts for Native American
  languages that prefer to have the spacing modifiers associated with the previous
  base character. Some questions...\r\n\r\n1. Is a spacing modifier letter (U+02b0
  to U+02ff) glyph generally interpreted to be a stand-alone character or a character
  to be linked/joined to the previous base character?\r\n2. In the languages we're
  working with, they use a U+02b7 for what is termed a 'rounded' sound and is always
  shown attached to the previous base character. Is there a different glyph that should
  be used in this case?\r\n\r\nThis question is arising from a discussion with a software
  vendor that produces crossword puzzle applications. With the current version the
  spacing modifier letter appears as a distinct character in the puzzle and not as
  an element of a composite glyph as the language intends. What we're researching
  is whether this is normal behavior or something that can be 'adjusted' without impacting
  other languages.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\n "

  body: "A spacing modifier letter usually follows a base letter. It is not usually
    'attached' to it in a ligated way, but it is understood as forming a graphemic
    unit so, e.g. hyphenation should never occur between them. This suggests to me
    that you probably do want the base letter and modifier letter to sit in the same
    crossword puzzle cell. How to do it? That depends on how the crossword puzzle
    is being made. If the crossword software has a built in assumption of one character
    per cell, then you have a problem that cannot be resolved at the glyph level,
    because however you try to display the combination of base+modifier, whether as
    a single glyph or as two glyphs, the underlying text is always going to be two
    characters.\r\n\r\nAn elegant way around this, since you are dealing with the
    makers of the software, would be to employ the Combining Grapheme Joiner control
    character (U+034F) between the base and modifier to indicate that they should
    be treated as a single unit. If the software seees the sequence character-CGJ-character
    it would interpret that to mean that this sequence should be displayed in a single
    cell."

  body: "John, that was great information! Do I also need to modify my unicode composite
    character, ccmp feature and name to include the Combining Grapheme Joiner (U+034F)?
    In other words, for the ccmp feature, do I insert it into the sub as in...\r\n\r\nsub
    K commaabovecmb uni034F uni02B7 by uni004B0313034F02B7;\r\n\r\nThanks for the
    insight. This will be great news for the developer as we've been stumped how to
    handle this for not only this font/language but others.\r\n"

  body: "What I would probably do in this situation is to \r\n\r\na) classify CGJ
    as a 'mark' in the OT GDEF table (technically it is a combining mark anyway, although
    it is invisible;\r\n\r\nb) create a ccmp lookup that ignores marks, and simply
    map\r\nbase modifier -> base_modifier\r\n\r\nThis ensures that the ligature substitution
    happens regardless of whether the CGJ is present in the string.\r\n\r\nI know
    how to do this in VOLT, but I'm not sure how you set up separate lookups within
    a feature in FontLab/FDK syntax. Presumably you have some ccmp substitutions that
    involve 'mark' glyphs, so you would need separate lookups for those that include
    and those that exclude marks."
