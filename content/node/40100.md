  have all standardized on $24 for Postscript and $29 for Opentype fonts, whether
  it be on Myfonts, Adobe, Fonts.com, FontExplorer, whatever.\r\n\r\nI'm curious what
  others in the industry think about this. On the one hand, it's not a horrible price
  to be paying for quality cuts of beef from the mega foundries. But for independent
  type foundries, do you feel that it sets the bar too high? Or too low?\r\n\r\nDo
  you think that standardizing the cost of fonts along these lines would level the
  playing field so that only the best designs stood out? \r\n\r\nImagine we're talking
  about Myfonts, and they adopt this pricing scheme. All fonts are $24/$29. Which
  version of Garamond do you want? They're all the same price, so obviously you're
  gonna pick Premier Pro or Sabon instead of some knockoff Jannon. Or you'll pick
  Storm's Baskerville over the Monotype version. \r\n\r\nIt all depends upon the design,
  not the price. That would make the quality of the type the determining factor. (Ruling
  out a lot of the crap fonts, since no one is going to pay $29 for Black Chancery.
  Yeah buddy, I totally just went there.)\r\n\r\nSilly? Smart? Insipid? Inspired?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    foundries are the ones that refuse to allow a-la-carte pricing of individual weights
    and styles (e.g., HFJ). I understand the rationale behind the pricing strategy,
    but to me, it is a significant hurdle to purchasing more licenses. \r\n\r\nAs
    for the 24/29 thing, seems like the Type 1's are overpriced. No one seems to want
    them anymore, Adobe won't even cut them--so shouldn't the price be a lot LOWER?
    After all, to get most of the glyphs in a fully-fleshed-out OT typeface, but in
    Type 1 format, you need to license at least three fonts (standard, caps and OsF)
    and perhaps even more (LF, TF, foreign language...)\r\n\r\nThe market has grown
    accustomed to the \"roughly $20-$30\" price for an individual font, so the OT
    price seems about right.\r\n"

    too high? Or too low?</em>\r\n\r\nAs an indie font maker* the big guys have set
    their standardized prices about right for me. I am able to match it, and in fact
    better it with low-end font products at budget prices. Primex is a simple font
    but it's cheap and useful, and designers buy it for those reasons. That's something
    any indie font maker should be able to do with just a dash of imagination.\r\n\r\n<em>Do
    you think that standardizing the cost of fonts along these lines would level the
    playing field so that only the best designs stood out?</em> \r\n\r\nThe font market
    really doesn't work that way. The best designs stand out on the basis of merit,
    including a fair price.\r\n\r\n<em>Imagine we\u2019re talking about Myfonts, and
    they adopt this pricing scheme. All fonts are $24/$29.</em>\r\n\r\nVery hard to
    see that ever happening. The whole concept of Myfonts is based on an open supermarket
    plan; independent vendors set their own prices, and the roach-baited font-buying
    public make their choice, based on the apparent quality of font products, features
    offered, perceived value for money, rival font products, and market trends. Myfonts
    has a ranking system that ensures all the good stuff (fonts people are buying)
    filters to the top, and the rubbish nobody buys filters to the bottom. \r\n\r\nStephen
    is quite right in saying that quality already is the determining factor.\r\n\r\n*I
    have never once called my operation or anyone else's \"foundry\". Only Myfonts
    literature refers to Sentinel Type as a \"foundry\", but I don't complain---life's
    too short.\r\n\r\nj a m e s"

    contest in which the winners are the most popular (best-selling) fonts, some of
    them the shittiest non-design yet seen, and the losers are frequently solid, interesting
    designs that are not commercial or trendy enuff to appeal to \"the roach-baited
    font-buying public\".\r\n\r\nI use that turn of phrase to liken mass audience
    font buyers to cinema-goers hungering after action-packed block-buster movies.
    Their buying habits are not the same as graphic designers. I don't make many block-busters,
    and neither do you Nick. We concentrate on turning out good designs loaded with
    philosophy, and our reward is a tepid sales rate.\r\n\r\nj a m e s"

    quite how I would have phrased it.\r\nCertainly, I'm not interested in catering
    to popular taste by concentrating on retro scripts and distress.\r\nBut making
    original designs is nonetheless a viable business model, given the nature of the
    market -- huge and long-term.\r\nSo if a foundry builds up a catalogue of products,
    and has good retail distribution, every one of its fonts will be licensed by someone
    somewhere, occasionally: Long Tail theory. And that adds up, even if you don't
    crack the Myfonts best seller list. (It should be noted that such charts are consumer-oriented,
    rather than corporate-oriented, as they are based on unit volume, not dollars,
    so the sale of a multi-font family with a multi-user license, for thousands of
    dollars, counts as a single sale and doesn't dent the chart, whereas if the value
    of the sale were divided by the typical cost of a single font, it would register
    as a big hit.)\r\n\r\nI'll be releasing some low-cost fonts soon. Tranching down."

  body: "I know that some complain about not being able to license one single font
    from some foundries. The way I think about it is two-fold. \r\n\r\n- \"Is this
    font <em>the</em> best for the project?\"\r\n- \"Will I be able to use again in
    the future, even many times?\"\r\n\r\nIf I (you) can say \"yes\" to both you will
    get your money back. It might take a project or two, but you'll get it back. \r\n\r\nAlso
    consider that the time you spend trying to find something close is costing you
    money too.\r\n\r\nPerhaps consider only charging your client for the one font
    and then when you use the next font in the pack charge another client for that
    one.\r\n\r\nFonts are tools that we use in our work. I couldn't buy part of a
    computer even if that was all I could afford. So I buy the whole computer knowing
    I'll get my money back eventually. I have a well-stocked toolbox and know that
    I will get my money out of them. \r\n\r\nAlso consider not even charging your
    clients for the fonts. I don't. It goes back to the toolbox analogy. I'm not giving
    the tools to my clients when I'm done. I'm giving them the final product. I keep
    the computer and the fonts to use another day."

  body: "Pricing is always tricky. At what point does the volume increase overtake
    the individual profit margin? Developing decent type is quite time consuming work
    and not guaranteed to return the initial investment of time. What does it take
    to determine the market saturation point of a given face and divide it into the
    cost of production? There is quite a bit of speculation involved. It is truly
    a gamble. Like playing Bingo, your odds of winning increase with the number of
    cards you purchase to play--as does your investment in the game. It isn't just
    the value of the individual typeface in the market but the marketing power of
    the vendor. A large established entity with plenty of market inroads will have
    a much easier time of getting their work even noticed.  The small outfits and
    newcomers with no track record have to bleed the most to get a bandage. This same
    group has the least capital to invest so they are between a rock and a hardplace.
    They have to spend more on marketing and lower their pricepoint to get the attention
    of the buyers. Nick's concept with MyFonts is a perfect example. His logic is
    spot on with the MyFonts sales model. You have to tread water long enough to be
    there for the feeding.\r\n\r\nChrisL"
