  and I know I have plenty to learn about all three, so please have patience with
  me.\r\n\r\nI am interested in learning about the following (two?) typeface(s):\r\n\r\nHarris
  Roman:\r\nhttp://i.imgur.com/7jdfQ.png\r\n\r\nHarris Italic:\r\nhttp://i.imgur.com/nExNF.png\r\n\r\nAs
  far as I know, these are public domain scans of original prints from the early 1900s.
  What I would like to know, is if these typefaces have even been made into digital
  fonts, either under the same name (Harris Roman and Harris Italic) or something
  else? I have tried identifont and whatthefont to no avail.\r\n\r\nUnique parts of
  the font seem to be the tail of the 'Q' and the very short (squashed) descenders,
  especially on the double-storey 'g'.\r\n\r\nReally, I am hoping /not/ to find a
  digital version of these, because I plan to digitally revive/recreate them myself.\r\n\r\nHaving
  said that, I'm not 100% sold on this typeface, the descenders seem almost too squashed.
  So, if you know of any better looking typefaces and specimens that are public domain
  and where there is no modern equivalent or copyright issues, I would be very grateful
  to find out about them.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nCraig Marshall\r\n"
