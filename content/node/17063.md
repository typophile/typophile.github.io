  Dickinson Type Foundry of Boston was started by Samuel Nelson Dickinson in 1839.
  The great Chicago fire of 1872 destroyed the entire plant, after which Dickinson
  went into partnership with A.C. Converse, Alexander C. Phemister, [[Joseph W. Phinney]]
  and George C. Pierce. By 1890 the firm was under the control of Phinney, who had
  long been the general manager. In 1892, it merged into [[American Type Founders]]."
