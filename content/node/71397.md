  sure why the color looks like when i upload it. i always have this problem, when
  i save the jpeg and upload it online, the color looks inverted."

  body: I like the more stencilled and eroded serif typeface. Not sure about Futura
    as its companion. I would opt for a more 'common' font like Helvetica Inserat
    (possibly eroded too?) to emphasise the cardboard-feel. In stead of making your
    type black, I'ld use a very dark grey. How about adding some black-line boxes
    with texts in them and/or icons like 'this side up' and 'handle with care'? Or
    is that too funny considering the subject?

  body: "@Will. I am using a photo as the background in photoshop.\r\n@omash. Ahhh...
    I see what you mean about using a more common font like helvetica. Great idea.
    I didn't even think about doing the 'handling with care thing'.\r\n\r\nI was more
    concerned about the layout and typography. But those design ideas are helpful
    too.\r\nThank you."

  body: I wouldn't over-design it to keep that mass-production feel... Maybe things
    a little bit skewed and/or tilted?

  body: "In that case can i suggest that you try actually doing it on corrugated card.
    Hell you could go all out and actually stencil the thing. The nice thing about
    mass production techniques is that they are easy to mass produce and it seems
    a shame not the use them.\r\n\r\nOn the layout front i would lean towards the
    simplicity of the first and last designs, though i see that there is some additional
    info on  some of the others - is that essential?\r\n\r\nWill"

  body: "You know what, these are really great ideas, I will make it into an actually
    project. What is corrugated paper? Is that like cardboard?\r\nAnd the last versions
    I put up, were the finals I submitted to the gallery. There was a few changes.\r\nDo
    you think, if I stenciled it, and printed it on corrugated paper, it'd be something
    beneficial for my portfolio?\r\nThanks"
