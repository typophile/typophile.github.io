  to identify this font that I found on an old piece of design work.  If we can identify

  body: Perfect match is [[http://www.dafont.com/nova-solid.font|Nova Solid]] by Billy
    Argel but as suggested by Don, you could do pretty much the same starting with
    any geometric black sans (Futura, Avant-Garde Gothic, Century Gothic...) and remove
    counters.
