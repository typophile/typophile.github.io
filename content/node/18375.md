body: "An interesting typographic chart on the front page of \"The Arts\" section
  in to-day\u2019s NY Times (p. E1). In that chart \"each word is scaled proportionally
  to the number of times it has been used in acceptance speeches at the last six Academy
  Award ceremonies.\" The largest-size word is... \"<strong>thank</strong>\". All
  words in the chart are set in Matthew Carter\u2019s excellent <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2003/10/21/business/media/21PAPE.html?ex=1141880400&en=1d9e57039abe6674&ei=5070\">Times
  Cheltenham</a>. The chart was designed by <a href=\"http://www.13pt.com/projects/nytimes\">Jonathan
  Corum</a> of The New York Times.\r\n\r\n"

  body: I noticed this too and tried to find an image from their on-line edition.
    It doesn't seem to be there. I'll try to do a scan of it to post.

  body: 'Delightful. Jonathan Corum also designed the FontBureau web site--an early
    effort. This has always been one of my favorites for clean, simple, but inviting
    design. The home page originally was more like <a href="http://www.fontbureau.com/fonts/browse/">this
    page</a>,with the guide bars in green. I liked that better than the current home
    page. '
