body: "Hi\r\n\r\nI am working on a poster for a show, the title of the show is written
  in chinese script, a caligrapher friend painted it for me, which I then scanned
  and tweaked to my liking, the title also includes the matching pinyin transcription
  in parenthesis underneath written with a chinese caligraphy style font that I customized
  to fit my needs (\"zyng easy\" for those interested).\r\n\r\nWhere I'm looking for
  some advise is that I am now looking for the right font for the performance details
  that are going to be written at the bottom of the poster (dates, venues, etc), and
  I'm not sure where to go with it... I've tried different things but nothing feels
  right so far... I'm looking for something that would harmonize well with the script
  aesthetic of the title, but that does not go into the cartoony or fake \"oriental\"
  look. I suspect the font would have absolutly nothing asian about it except that
  when I put it next to my script I get a sens that it fits... probably a classic-ish
  font, so far I've been thinking a sans, but I'm not necessarily against serif either...\r\n\r\nI
  can't really post the full poster, but I've include a close up of the title for
  reference... \r\nany suggestions, pointers or musing on my dilemma are welcome!\r\n\r\nthanks!"
