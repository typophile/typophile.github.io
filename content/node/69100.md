  body: The futuristic font shows up in the Solotype Catalog as 'Automation'. The
    only digital version I'm aware of is called 'Otto Mason SH' - the SH standing
    for the long-defunct company Soft Horizons. a Web search will turn it up.

    than the one on the book, which is more original? and do you know who design it
    back then?"
