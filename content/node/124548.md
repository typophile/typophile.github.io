    body: "\r\nThanks for the quick answer, but I have not found a font in the Delphin
      family that exactly matches my sample.\r\n\r\nThe character shapes in my sample
      match the Delphin character shapes, but in my sample the lower case l, h, d,
      and f characters are aligned at the top.\r\n\r\nI cannot anything in the Delphin
      family where that is true.\r\n\r\nI like the characters in the Delphin family
      better than those in my sample, but I would still like to find out where the
      characters in my sample came from.\r\n\r\nThanks for your help."

    type in your sample is most likely a derivative/knock-off of Delphin, but without
    a clearer sample I can\u2019t get you any closer...."
