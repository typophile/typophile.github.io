  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">I just saw <a href="http://typography.net/type/bliss.htm">Tankard’s Bliss </a>  in a newspaper ad and it reminded me again how important [[Edward Johnston]]’s Railway type (1916) has been to the sans world. It’s easy to forget that [[Gill Sans]] got 95% of its genetic material from Johnston, and that Johnston preceded [[Futura]] by 12 years.  I can’t think of any sans of note that predated it except [[Akzidenz Grotesk]]. Even though Johnston was not available as a commercial face for more than 80 years (<a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/itc/johnston/">ITC Johnston</a>, 1999) its influence was immediate and worldwide – since, then and now, many of the world’s educated people seem to pass through London. Johnston’s influence can even be seen in <a href="http://www.clearviewhwy.com/ ">Clearview</a>, coming soon to a road sign near you if you live in N. America. P22’s <a href="http://p22.com/products/london.html">London Underground</a> is faithful to Johnston’s original and has some cool extras, but also has a very restrictive license.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/itcjfortypo.gif]</div>

<p>I take this to limit most commercial uses of the font. No such limits appear on the ITC agreement - at least that&rsquo;s the way I took it. Would you take the above as restictive? Maybe I&rsquo;ve taken it wrong. My primary use is for signage and packaging. I wasn&rsquo;t so concerned about the embedding issue.</p>

<p>It restricts &ldquo;embedding&rdquo; of the font to &ldquo;a static graphic image (for example, a “gif”) or an embedded electronic document&hellip;You may not embed Font Software in a Commercial Product without a separate written license from MTI, and you may not embed Font Software in an electronic document or data file for any reason other than your own Personal or Internal Business Use.&rdquo;</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I did read the whole thing from your link and the intention you infer from it escaped me.  It may be better to move that line up a bit and rephrase something like:</p>
<p>&ldquo;while Most alphanumeric fonts are allowable for professional use without additional licensing provided that the Grant of License guidelines are met, other uses designated as “professional” or “commercial” such as ???? may require additional licensing. &quot;</p>
<p>The problem for me is the term &ldquo;allowable&rdquo; is left hanging without clarification and that it sounds like the &ldquo;may require additional licensing&rdquo; is the norm rather than the exception.
Somewhere, in ALL foundries' EULAs, there needs to be a place where the legal-speak is translated into language that is clear to the end user.  I will grant you that users need to &ldquo;Read and reread&rdquo; if you will grant me that EULA writers need to reread and rewrite as well.  The danger to the foundry is that there is a potential for confusion which may cause potential customers to shy away from purchase.  I know this is an old story Tiff has been through on numerous occasions here and abroad so I will just shut up now.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I think the word &lsquo;unpleasantness&rsquo; is not correct. But yes, shows more and more how much education is needed in regards to font licensing and their EULAs.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;d say this confusion comes from people only surface reading the EULA. I had the same confusion about their EULA until I actually sat down read it and then asked Rich and Carima what they meant. These foundries are run by people not robots. They can answer questions and most of the time will take the time to do so right away just to make sure you don&rsquo;t get stuck on a slippery slope. Most situations where you must additionally license a font are for extreme cases which most small companies rarely enter. However, if a small company does find themselves needed more licensing, chances are they are going to be doing a large enough project to cover most instances of the needing more licensing.</p>
<p>If it is an icon, dingbat or illustration typeface design you shouldn&rsquo;t be surprised that you need additional licensing. Most if not all foundries that have typefaces like this will require it.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p><em>I can’t think of any sans of note that predated it except Akzidenz Grotesk.</em></p>
<p>19th century sans serifs (like other 19th century type genres) don&rsquo;t get much respect, although they have certainly been noted in design histories; Meggs gives appropriate space to the first flurry of releases in London in the 1830s. They were in frequent use in all kinds of typesetting, lettering, signage, and architectural inscriptions. Rian Hughes has just released a face based on British cast iron street name signs, which are all over the place and looking damn fine (although he has kept things grungy rather than cleaned them up).</p>
<p>The foremost (1989) digital sans based on a 19th century model is David Berlow&rsquo;s Bureau Grotesque, after types of the Stephenson Blake foundry, and at the request of art director Roger Black. Another face in the same genre is Jonathan Hoefler&rsquo;s Champion. These faces have been very well used, especially in magazines and newspapers.</p>
<p>In comparison to the Victorian Grotesques, Johnston&rsquo;s work, like his calligraphy, is a little rough around the edges, naive, even. But that is part of its appeal, linking it to the arts and crafts movement, and it&rsquo;s as part of that return-to-basics philosophy that Johnston&rsquo;s work resonated across Europe.</p>
<p>For a typeface family, the Johnson idea worked well in many branches, including regular text, but the condenseds were not as good as those of the Grotesque. 
NB: The bold sans serif condensed all-caps face was a massive pillar of 19th century Victorian jobbing typography &ndash; Caslon &amp; Livermore showed 15 pages of it in their 1837 specimen.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Caslon&rsquo;s was actually not so bad, but even he didn&rsquo;t like it. I guess the impressive thing about Johnston was that he had so little to go on. The originality of his face comes from the calligraphic influence I suppose. Keith Tam has an excellent paper on the sans/calligrahic influence.

<p><em>Naive</em> is a wonderful way to describe Johnston. I think the lowercase can also be described as friendly.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m particularly interested because of Gill&rsquo;s work on this stamp[img:sites/default/files/old-images/stamp.jpg]on a postcard to his brother Evan.</p>
