  body: "Sorry, don't know this one. Feels freebie/amateurish/hand-drawn to me but
    I could be totally wrong. The closest I have is [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/activesphere/kathleen-sans/|Kathleen
    Sans]]. BTW, that's not their [[http://www.dantecalzature.com/img/logo.png|actual
    logo]] which looks close to [[http://www.houseind.com/fonts/neutraface|Neutraface]].\r\nSome

    [[http://www.dafont.com/champagne-limousines.font|Champagne & Limousines]]\r\n\r\nEDIT:
    after further research though \"basic sans\" section at DaFont, it appears to
    be [[http://www.dafont.com/opificio.font|Opificio]]"

  body: "Champagne & Limousines might be a \"remix\" of Avant Garde, a commercial
    font. Looking at some of  Thompson's other font offerings, that perception is
    reinforced. So I would be cautious about recommending/using it.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
