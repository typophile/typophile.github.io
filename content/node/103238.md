  to the way finding system created by Axel Peemoeller for the [[http://asdlabs.com/blog/2008/09/26/axel-peemoeller-eureka-carpark|Melbourne
  car park]]. I know that the designer created it using some type of mathematical
  system, but unfortunately I don't have his mad math skills to pull this off. \r\nI
  was thinking of maybe projecting my design across the walls and tracing it on the
  spot. Any ideas would be greatly appreciated."

    and tracing). Just make sure the projector is where the viewer's head will be.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "[I never did anything like this, so take this with a grain of seasalt.]\r\n\r\nOn
    a planning stage, make a photo from the point you want to put the viewer(s)/projector,
    and plan by overlaying your image over the photo.  A tricky part would be to decide
    which kind of photo to take: rectilinear wide or fisheye wide.\r\n\r\nThe idea
    is that for planning, you want a wide-angle photo such that rectangular pieces
    of this photo can serve as narrow-angle photos of the subject (assuming that you
    want your design to be viewed in a narrow angle).  This is not possible (due to
    sphere being \u201Cintrinsically\u201D curved).  So for best result, loading a
    wide-angle photo into a specialized \u201Cpanoramic viewer\u201D (like Hugin)
    may be a better solution (if you can get familiar with its UI quick enough)."

  body: You can also use computer plotted pounce patterns. They have an advantage
    over projections, first because there isn't the distortion a projector will give
    you, and second you don't need darkness. Of course, you need neither computer
    not plotter for the projection method.  In the end, it is six of one and a half
    dozen of the other.

  body: The method of drawing on a photograph is probably the best, because at the
    very least you can be sure it will be perfect if you photograph the finished work
    with the same lens from the exact same place. Which is really all you can ask
    for with this sort of thing.
