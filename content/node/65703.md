  remember which one it is and I've just spent a really long time typing them all
  out to see if I can figure it out only to fail miserably. You guys have always been
  so helpful in the past, so can anyone ID this font for me? Excuse the small graphics.
  This is the only size I have.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/subscribe_5249.gif]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/quick-post_5041.gif]"
