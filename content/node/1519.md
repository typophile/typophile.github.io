  body: Yeah, and Mouldtype &#40;UK&#41; was purchased, a couple of years ago, for
    probably less than half of the ATF receipts. The ATF auction was a disaster, and
    well documented. None of the institutions &#40;the curators leave work at 5:30,
    everyday&#41; that should have come to its rescue, bothered with it, though they
    were among the first to publish about its loss.  <BR> <BR>This, however, does
    not devalue the pricing of this particular foundry. <BR> <BR>Gerald

  body: The Harold Berliner matrix holdings is probably what brings the asking price
    to the amount it is. This collection is truly outstanding in its scope, encompassing
    all of the finest book ad display types made by British Monotype under the direction
    of Stanley Morison and John Dreyfus. Most matix collections will include one or
    two of these faces; Dante, Lutetia and the like, but Harold had them all. <BR>
    <BR>I had the privilege of seeing the foundry during an American Typecasting Fellowship
    conference, hosted by harold a number of years ago. The entire operation was the
    finest and the cleanest I have ever seen. <BR> <BR>The machines appear to be all
    high serial numbers; some of them looking like they just came of the production
    line. Most casters show their age under layers of baked grease and splashed metal.
    My own Super Caster is a buckboard, compared to the one in the collection. <BR>
    <BR>This is a amazing gathering of foundry equipment, whose only drawback is its
    great size. I wish I had the money and the years. Curses. <BR> <BR>Jim Rimmer

  body: Jim, <BR> <BR>The casters have little real value. Paint is cheap and English
    pumps are junk. I think if you paid $5,000.00 for the lot of them you would be
    the highest bidder. Something tells me you would stick with your buckboard. Paint
    is cheap. I already said that didn&#39;t I? Moving is expensive! <BR> <BR>And,
    $175,000. US or $234,813.98 CND is a lot of money. Over a quarter of a million
    bucks after moving and installation probably even in American dollars? If your
    time is worth anything. I would think if you had that kind of money you would
    not want to dirty your mits with moving. <BR> <BR>Harold has an enviable selection
    of &#34;English&#34; mats. But for a foundry to be worth $175,000. his sales must
    be at least $175,000. per year? Do you think so? I don&#39;t. If he is I think
    I am going to buy it. But M &amp; H &#34;foundry type sales&#34; volume is not
    that high and they are over one hundred year old. They also have good matrices.
    Better yet, Louis &#34;the casterman&#34;. <BR> <BR>If you make 10% profit above
    all expenses and paying and receiving &#34;trade rate wages,&#34; not working
    for, lets say, $1.00 per hour, you would be classed, in PIA terms, as the industry
    leader. They do not count the free pig barn as genuine value when it come to rent.
    So rent something downtown and pay yourself more than someone living in Bangladesh.
    <BR> <BR>At that rate, not including interest, it would take 10 years to pay off
    the equipment? How old would you be? What would the equipment be worth when it
    was paid off? A big zero. So I hope someone enjoys debt when they are eighty years
    of age. Then enjoys the idea of taking his life

  body: Jim, <BR> <BR>That&#39;s a good thing. You would not want to be in my kind
    of trouble. If I were younger and had a few extra bucks I would look at it myself.
    <BR> <BR>Makes me wonder if he will be able to sell it in one lot though. I think
    he may have to part it out. <BR> <BR>The big question is why is he selling? I
    worry about his health. He loves his stuff. <BR> <BR>Gerald Giampa
