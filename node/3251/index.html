		<div class="commentbody">It was a photo-mechanical method of setting type. There would be a film negative which had small images of all the characters in a font (or several fonts). Light would be projected through the character images, through a lens, and onto photographic paper. Different size type could be set by changing the lens(es). Font changes were made by physically replacing the film negative (although most machines allowed two or more negatives to be used at a time). Spacing was controlled mechanically in the earlier machines (e.g., special cogs) and electronically on later machines (e.g., ROM cards). The exposed paper would spool up in a light-tight box and then be fed into a developing machine (as is still done today on high-end filmsetters).  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->In addition to &quot;machine-set&quot; phototype (i.e., which used a typewriter-like keyboard for input and had automatic spacing), there were &quot;film setters.&quot; These worked more like a darkroom enlarger. There was a strip of negative film with fairly large images of the characters which would be moved manually using cranks to locate and position each character. A strip of photo paper was placed below in a bath of developing fluid. The character would be projected onto the paper through a red filter, allowing the character to be previewed without exposing the paper (photo paper is not sensitive to red light). Once the character was lined up, the filter would be removed and the character would appear on the paper. The process was repeated for each character. This method was used mainly for headline type. Machine-set phototype was not high-enough quality for large headlines. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Phototypesetting goes back to around the 1940s. It overtook metal typesetting by the early 1970s. Digital typesetting is almost as old as phototypesetting (and is really a type of phototypesetting), and didn't become practical (especially for high-quality work) until the late 1970s. Mechanical phototypesetting was obsolete by the mid-1980s. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I'm old enough to have used some of the later phototypesetting machines, mostly AM and Compugraphic. They were pretty cool to use and you could actually hear the type being set. The Compugraphic 7200 (around 1978 or so) was my first taste of working with a disk-based file system. Before that, the systems I'd used had no mass storage and could only keep one line of type in their tiny memory at a time. Once you hit the return key, it set the line and it was gone. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Now, aren't you sorry you asked?</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Not at all. Reading that, I kind of feel lucky to live in this digital age. I do remember the thrill, and the strangled sound of the dot matrix printer. By the time I was about 7, quark had been around quite a bit and was the main tool (I think) on my dad's paper. Since then they have moved onto other software (strangely, neither quark nor that adobe program are suitable for newspaper production on a large scale - it comes down to thge fact that they cannot store many versions of the same article so that they are easy to switch, necessary for deadline chasing work). Anyway, thats about as much as I know (The Times does have some very delicious body fonts, though).</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Although we thought (mechanical) phototypesetting was pretty neat at the time, digital typesetting is better in virtually every way.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Page layout in the machine was mostly a dream. Instead, you would get long &quot;galleys&quot; which had to be carefully cut up and glued onto illustration board (or whatever). Just keeping everything square was a major task. Corrections had to be carefully cut out and pasted in by hand, and if you didn't keep the developer fresh they wouldn't match the existing type. Run-arounds were not for the lazy, even simple square ones. Since you had to do a layout before any type was set, all the manuscripts had to be counted and measured so you would know how much room to leave.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Nowadays, it's so much easier. On the other hand, people's expectations have changed. &quot;It's all automatic. You just push a button, right?&quot;</div>

		<div class="commentbody">As someone old enough to have used a lot of <!-- raw HTML omitted -->phototypesetting (but always as a &quot;client&quot;, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->not an operator) I also think that we're better <!-- raw HTML omitted -->off now in many ways. Not least of them, the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->opening of the standards of digital type that <!-- raw HTML omitted -->was &quot;forced&quot; on Adobe, as well as the availability <!-- raw HTML omitted -->of affordable tools, permitted the flowering of <!-- raw HTML omitted -->type design in a way that would be unthinkable <!-- raw HTML omitted -->in the era of the big type houses (the obvious <!-- raw HTML omitted -->flip side being that most of this is not so good, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->but&hellip;), and the possibility of fine type design <!-- raw HTML omitted -->has been enhanced. We've seen for instance the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->rebirth of lowercase (so-called &quot;old-style&quot;) <!-- raw HTML omitted -->figures and other things that for a number of <!-- raw HTML omitted -->reasons were rarely available in phototype. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->On the graphic design side, the possibility of <!-- raw HTML omitted -->experimentation with more complex type structures <!-- raw HTML omitted -->is a bonus - I remember some projects of mine <!-- raw HTML omitted -->that were nightmares of specification (does <!-- raw HTML omitted -->anyone still do type specification? ;), sometimes <!-- raw HTML omitted -->with frustrating results. Also the costs could <!-- raw HTML omitted -->be much higher then in these cases. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->On the other hand (and somewhat contradictorily, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I know) the fact that you had to have a layout, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->a project, before specifying type, as Mark <!-- raw HTML omitted -->mentioned, provided IMO for tighter, generally <!-- raw HTML omitted -->better design than we mostly see today - add <!-- raw HTML omitted -->this to the general debasement in the perception <!-- raw HTML omitted -->of the profession (Mark's &quot;You just push a button&quot;) <!-- raw HTML omitted -->and&hellip; - well, I won't enter the matter here as <!-- raw HTML omitted -->this post is already too long. ;)</div>

I said &quot;whatever&quot; and walked the kilometer or so on foot, with crossbow parts sticking out of my faithfull blue backpack, right past the point my barber had been taken hostage the previous month. The best part? During the stroll I was whistling that &quot;Bye bye miss America pie &hellip; This'll be the day that I die&quot; song, you know it?
