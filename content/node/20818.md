  a favorite font of yours? So a handwritten companion font to your favorite text
  face!\r\n\r\nAlso what about a wiki section listing all the past type battles so
  that past battles are easy to peruse. And maybe even include the next three upcoming
  battles so if they are large (like creating your own handrwitten type style) people
  can plan ahead or start early."
