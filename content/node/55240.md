body: "I need to identify the font that is on my race trailer. The logo was created
  by myself and a guy I know on his computer. I don't remember the name of the application
  he used or the font name (obviously), we scrolled though the fonts until we found
  one that I liked. I can no longer reach him and I need to know the font name. Any
  help would be greatly appreciated.\r\n\r\nI need only the part that reads \"TRI-RYCHE\",
  not the \"Racing\" part.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\n\r\n--jack\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Modofoed_logo_Centered_Racing_4982.jpg]"
