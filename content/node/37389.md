  a body of research relating to this pivotal sanserif,\r\nI have used the info from
  a recent help request, so thanks to all who donated.\r\n\r\nI am still slightly
  confused over the name, the question I raise is, \r\n1. Does Grotesk, in German
  mean sanserif, or just simply grotesque (Eng.), if so, this can be taken  to imply
  misshapen, malformed ugly etc. Its seem pretty regular to me and not at all ugly
  ?\r\nAn earlier thread I  had read ( in part ) seemed to indicate a meaning for
  Akzidentz which would convey a chance discovery.\r\n\r\nAny ideas or thoughts  will
  be greatly received.\r\n\r\nAlan"

    a beautiful Akzidenz Grotesk on my perfume di Ermenegildo Zegna on the back.\r\nBeautiful
    2 and it slighlty differs from all the thin versions I have in stock. Tried to
    make one myself but it doesn\u2019t look so good.\r\n\r\nLet\u2019s see something
    if you have already!\r\n\r\nGood Luck\r\nStefan"

    are some good graphic comparisons of Akzidenz and Helvetica.

    I think this designation is indeed the result of the sans serif faces as being
    felt to be <em>strange</em> compared to the usual and common serif faces of the
    time.\r\nWouldn\u2019t \u201Csans serif\u201D rather go by \u201Cserifenlose Linearantiqua\u201D
    (at least that\u2019s what I learned in typography class)."

  body: "Many, many thanks\r\n\r\nSorry I haven't replied sooner, work does tend to
    get in the way, annoyingly-!!\r\nEndre, Interestingly I think I would go for Bertholds
    as well, but I have to ask myself why ?\r\nAesthetically you could argue the differences
    are minimal between several early Grotesks, so my choice is most likely based
    on\r\nthe originality of Bertholds AG, that said my research has revealed other
    foundries which also produced early SanSerifs could have also figured in the creation
    of this seminal face so one could argue (originality, whats that ?).\r\nIts strange
    also that one of the names mentioned several times in various pieces of research
    is Vincent Figgins, he is credited with amongst others, Giza, an Egyptian style
    face (similar to Rockwell). I say strange because my family come from a part of
    London not far away from where he had his foundry and our names are similar.\r\n\r\nre
    the \"Grotesk\" meaning  I think Jan has hit the nail, so to speak ! I wonder
    if the idea was, this new face was so \"modern\" Berthold jokingly played along
    ?\r\nA friend of mine who is taking typography degree intimated similar\r\n\r\n\r\nMany
    thanks to all who have contributed\r\n\r\nAlan"

  body: "Dear Alan!\r\n\r\nRegarding \xBB Grotesk \xAB as German native speaker (as
    you may note my English skills are worst) I have a few additional remarks. \r\n\r\nIn
    german we have (had) three modes to name a \xBBSans Serif\xAB:\r\n\r\nGrotesk\r\nSans
    Serif\r\nserifenlose (= Sans Serif) (Linear-) Antiqua \r\n\r\nThe semantic origin
    of the term \xBB Grotesk \xAB is the French language of the 17th century. The
    term (grotesque) first was used in visual arts to express an unnatural combination
    of parts of humans, animals and plants. This term etymologically was borrowed
    from the Italian  \xBB grottesco \xAB = \xBB part of a cave \xAB, meaning antique
    cave paintings, antique cuneiform writing etc.\r\n\r\nIn 1832 the London typesetter
    and type founder Vincent Figgins (1766\u20131844) created a typeface (only uppercase)
    called \xBB Two-line Great Primer Sans-serif \xAB. He was the first using the
    term \xBB Sans Serif \xAB. In the same year William Thorowgood published a typeface
    (uppercase and lowercase) which became known as \xBB grotesque \xAB.\r\n\r\nArround
    1880 the German Typesetter Ferdinand Theinhard created a four weights typeface
    called \xBB Royal Grotesk \xAB for publications of the \xBB K\xF6niglich-Preu\xDFischen
    Akademie der Wissenschaften zu Berlin \xAB (Royal Prussian Academy of Science
    Berlin). This was the moment when the \xBB Grotesk \xAB became popular in Germany.
    1908 Herman Berthold took over the Theinhard Foundry and continued to sell the
    \xBB Royal Grotesk \xAB till the end of the monarchy in 1918. After that Berthold
    sold the \xBB Royal Grotesk \xAB as \xBB Akzidenz Grotesk \xAB.\r\n\r\nVertex"
