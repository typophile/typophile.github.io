    http://unicode.org/charts/PDF/U1D100.pdf. There are balinese musical symbols in
    the range 1B61-1B7C. There are also 266D    MUSIC FLAT SIGN, 266E    MUSIC NATURAL
    SIGN and 266F    MUSIC SHARP SIGN\r\n"

  body: "The music symbols in Unicode are intended for occasional use within typical
    text, not as a basis for musical notation layout, which typically requires specialised
    software. The best quality modern music notation output I've seen is from the
    open source <a href=\"http://lilypond.org/web/\">LilyPond</a> program, which seeks
    to emulate traditional music engraving.\r\n\r\nFor some kinds of music, a simpler,
    font-level solution is possible. I use the very good and easy-to-use <a href=\"http://marello.org/projects/caeciliae\">Caeciliae</a>
    OpenType font for Gregorian notation. It relies on something like InDesign in
    order to work."

  body: "PS: <em>Music is an universal language, there should be a Unicode for it.</em>\r\n\r\nMusic
    is not a language. Music is culturally-specific and not universal, although most
    cultures share similar musical concepts. Musical notation varies across cultures
    and standard Western musical notation can't even capture the expression of some
    Western music, let alone music from other cultures; this is why some modern composers
    invent their own notation systems or add new expressive marks to the standard
    notation. As far as I know, there also isn't any way to indicate a liquescent
    in standard Western notation, although one can in Gregorian notation. This is
    a good indicator of how music notation systems evolve for the purpose of particular
    types or styles of music, and are not universal in what they are able to record."

    is bundled on every new Mac, and it uses a pair of Truetype fonts to display its
    music notation. The encoding of these internal fonts does not appear to align
    to the Unicode positions for musical note glyphs.\r\n\r\nThe fonts are located
