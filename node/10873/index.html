		<div class="commentbody">If Rand wasn't happy with it, then why dwell on it? Obviously he did not like it. And I would tend to agree with his opinion first. It was a poor decision for UPS to accept the first logo and similar dedcision making on this new one too. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I don't care for the new one either, but the string HAD to go. When was the last time any of us saw a package with string? In the industry that UPS and FEDEX are in I can see how any reference to the &quot;old&quot; or &quot;archaic&quot; would be a bad thing. No matter how much we as designers may like the traditional. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->But I am interested to see how they translate the new logo to one color printing. Or even two color. That element of Rand's original that made the old logo so universal. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I had also heard that the reason that UPS went with the color brown in the first place was legal. I forget the details I heard, but UPS was required (legally somehow) to &quot;down-play&quot; their presence. Can anyone recall this legal issue?</div>

		<div class="commentbody">The Verizon logo really is the worst. And you can't get away from it. The throw-away attitude about design among major U.S. companies like UPS and Verizon is such a dramatic contrast with the Netherlands, where it seems like every square inch of the country has been well thought out and artfully designed. (Not to slight any other Euros, it's one of the few European countries I've visited.) Payphones, grocery stores, public toilets, sidewalks&hellip; they're all beautiful in their attention to detail and their functionality. That was my impression, anyway.</div>
