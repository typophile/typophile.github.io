  body: Same thing here. Seems like the difference increases dramatically as the degree
    of slant increases. At more typical italic slants (12-15 degrees), it's still
    there, but just slightly. It may be that the interactive slant tool reports the
    angle value incorrectly.

    will put it upright again (nearly so--there appears to be a rounding error). If
    I put it upright using the slant tool, it reports the angle as 35.23\xB0. If I
    undo and apply that angle with the transform panel, slants it past upright, just
    as with your example."

  body: I get what I presume is the same problem in the Windows version. The manual
    slant tool meter is inaccurate. Funnily, I've never noticed this before because
    I only ever use the manual slant tool when I want a purely visual adjustment and
    don't actually care about the angle. If I want to slant something a particular
    number of degrees, I always use either the transformation palette or Tim Ahren's
    RMX Slanter script.

    if you could find the perfect italic angle for each size that works all the way
    from the ascender to the descender hitting integer pixels at the baseline and
    the x-ht, you cannot make the diagonal strokes of an italic, which require many
    angles to cover K, S, V, W, X, Y and Z e.g., step evenly. These diagonals will
    stand out with uneven stair steps relative to the idealized per ppm italic slant
    you are promoting. \r\n\r\nBitmaps are no longer in the mainstream of screen font

  body: "David: <em>...capture the interactive slant angle...</em>\r\n\r\nThe workaround
    for the bug is to use the measuring tool to capture the resulting slant angle,
    rather than relying on the feedback from the Free Transform tool. This seems to
    be accurate, albeit recorded in the measurement panel as a value relative to the
    horizontal (e.g. a 14 degree right slant off vertical is recorded as 76 degrees).\r\n\r\nIn
    Windows FL, a right click drag with the measuring tool will give you the option
    to insert an angled guideline following the line of drag. You can then check the
    properties for this guideline to get the angle.\r\n_____\r\n\r\nHrant, I agree
    that being able to specify slant in terms of rise-over-run em unit integers would
    be a good feature in font tools. There will still be rounding errors, however,
    due to varying vertical distance between points, which will not always snap to
    multiples of the rise value."

    a well-designed typeface requires a variety of runs (angles), and side bearings
    for optical consistency. Snapping to multiples here is hopeless without both x

    - <em>\"stems are king; the Latin alphabet (especially the UC)\r\nis primarily

    no such thing as a dominant, \"king\" feature in type. There is background, beat
    (the main stems) and variety. And the beat itself, likes variety in the angles...
    and the variety in angle, one of the largest parameters to vary, shows up as a
    pixel difference early in the ppm spectrum relative to spacing, stem thickness
    or alignment varieties. "

    \ The data in your table agrees very closely with this formula.  The one oddness
    is slanting by 30 and then by -30 should return the shape to vertical.  I'm assuming
