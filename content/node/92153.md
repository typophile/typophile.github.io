  body: "The extra condensed sans is similar to Raleigh Gothic, one version of which
    is here...\r\n\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/nicksfonts/highpoint-gothic-nf/highpoint-gothic-nf/glyphs.html\r\n\r\nAs
    to the various blackletters shown, a hundred years ago and more, it wasn't unusual
    for foundries to offer special nameplate/masthead styles for newspapers. The product
    listings showed samples, but I have yet to see a specimen book with a complete
    alphabet showing of these special-purpose faces\u2026which is another way of saying
    that it's possible no one has digitized these particular faces yet.\r\n"
