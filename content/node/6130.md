  body: The perspective makes it hard to tell for sure, but &#34;MetroCard&#34; looks
    like Helvetica Black.

  body: Everything associated with MTA is set in a variation of Helvetica. Wait until
    next year when you have your big type conference in NYC and ride the subway the

  body: MTA has been using Helvetica as long as I can remember. Didn&#39;t Vignelli
    &#40;Helvetica king&#41; have something to do with it originally?
