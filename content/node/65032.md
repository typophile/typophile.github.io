    general I agree with you completely. I did spend a good year trying to perfect
    a mechanism that would allow me to remain 29 forever\u2026 but I ran out of time
    before it met with success. What can you do?"

    body: Years ago I concocted a method of time travel that entailed traveling to
      the north pole and running around in circles, clockwise or counterclockwise,
      and crossing the international date line for however many days forward or backward
      in time I wanted to travel. I still await the funding to test this method.
