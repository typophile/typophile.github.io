  body: "As far as I can remember these letters were custom designed by Glaser. He
    later developed a typeface called \"Baby Teeth\" based on this lettering. Check
    out Stephen Coles' post in <a href=\"http://www.typophile.com/node/37514\" target=\"_blank\">this
    thread</a> for a list of alternates.\r\n\r\n - Lex"
