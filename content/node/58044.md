    make it to LTypI yet?)\r\n<a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/singles/psyops/reykjavik_two_d_gauge_ot/\">Reykjavik
    Two D Gauge</a>\r\n\r\nThe super-huge x height looks like a customization to me,
    but I wouldn't know, maybe there is another version of this font?"

  body: Not sure it qualifies for LTypI as this logo was made by the font's designer,
    Stefan Kjartansson. And yes, I think he made some special customizations for his
    studio, Armchair Media.
