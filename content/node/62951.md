  PDF</a>\r\n\r\nI am designing a layout for a textbook about typography and type
  designers. Here is one spread, a proposed layout with my own text. I'd like a little
  feedback on:\r\n\r\na) form\r\n\r\nb) content\r\n\r\nThe typefaces are Scala and
  Scala Sans. Body is set 9/12 x 14 on the verso page and 9/12 x 21.6 on the recto
  page. Oh, and the center vertical represents the spine.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.evanmade.com/storage/Zapf_Layout.pdf\">CLICK

  body: 'The spread looks very good to me. But I''d check the text horizontal alignment
    bewteen the colums (eg: first and second column on the right page in the Zapf_Layout2.pdf:
    the text in the "In the twilight of his life" paragraph doesn''t align with the
    text in the first column). This is the only real problem I see; moreover, I''d
    also increase the spacing bewtween the last paragraph and the footnotes (why letters
    instead of numbers?, anyway), with a thinner or gray line. In the end, I would
    also try to not hyphen the text. But as I said, it really looks like a good typograhycal
    piece.'
