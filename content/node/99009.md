    Sans-Hebrew_5938.jpg]\r\n\r\nBoth of the fonts (see above) have attractive, and
    matching Hebrew glyphs.\r\n\r\nI have three suggestions.\r\n\r\n1) The Feh/Peh
    of Marapfhat (05E4) has a left vertical bar that turns right at its lower extreme,
    turning right too low. Rather, it should turn right at the mid-point (height)
    of the letter. See the same form in the Squarish Sans font ()5E4).\r\n\r\n2) The
    Tzaddi(k) of Marapfhat (05E6) has a left vertical bar that turns rightward at
    its mid-extreme, turning rightward too soon. Rather, it should turn rightward
    at a diagonal movement to the extreme  left base of the letter, and then turn
    left at the baseline.\r\n\r\n3) Again, the Tzaddi(k) of Squarish Sans (05E6) has
    a left vertical bar that turns rightward at its mid-extreme, turning rightward
    too soon. Rather, it should turn rightward at a diagonal movement to the extreme
    \ left base of the letter, and then turn left at the baseline.\r\n\r\nSee examples
    from different classic Hebrew typefaces:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/ayin-peh_5830.jpg]"

  body: "Thank you! I don't think anyone has called my attempts \"attractive\" before.
    \u263A From what I've read, it seems very unusual for typefaces to include matching
    or complementary Latin and Hebrew characters, but I appreciate it. It is a goal
    of mine in every face that I create. I believe that my SS is the only Bank Gothic-like
    face to include Hebrew.\r\n\r\nThe shape of peh in Marapfhont is idiosyncratic.
    You'll note that in most cases where there's a counter or bowl, it spans most
    of the height of the letter, with only a short stem outside it. It exaggerates
    the sense of thinness and height.\r\n\r\nThe challenge in both of the tsadis,
    as I recall it, was making them distinct enough from the ayins. (There are several
    glyph-pairs in Hebrew with relatively similar look.) Curves are under constraints
    in both faces, and diagonals very rare in Marapfhont. Not being a Hebrew reader
    (my education was very brief, and long enough ago that I've forgotten almost all
    of it) I'm not overly familiar with the \"canonical\" appearance. I see the point
    you're making. I'll have to revisit those. I probably had too few reference examples
    to spot what commonalities to preserve and what I could bend."

    primarily in large-size displays, not running text."

  body: "hrant\u2014 No, I developed Marapfhont independently, based upon visual inspection
    of the design of Modula Tall's uppercase Latin characters. I did not care for
    the lowercase, so those were completely redesigned, as well as the repertoire
    being expanded to Hebrew (and other) ranges. The source of the inspiration was
    the title font for the mid-90's computer game, Marathon. The name is a portmanteau
    of that and the in-game antagonist, the Pfhor."
