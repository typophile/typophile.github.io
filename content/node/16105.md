body: "I have a fantasy of having my own business card made with metal letterpress
  on fine cotton paper. I don't know that much about hot metal typesetting. In fact,
  I had the idea yesterday and I began looking for more information today. I already
  found a printer that still owns a Linotype machine, but I haven't contacted him
  yet.\r\n\r\nThe problem is : my business card will include an e-mail address...\r\n
  \r\nWhat will happen with the @ character ? This character has been around for many
  many years before we started using it in e-mail addresses. But was it part of the
  regular metal letter repertoire ?\r\n\r\nAh ! The joy of mixing old and new technologies

    to have it too high, and\r\nusually too large* to work well for email. Certainly
    the\r\neasiest solution is to use an \"at\" sign from a smaller size,\r\nand lead
    it on top to lower/fit it. A more sophisticated way\r\nis to go with photopolymer
    letterpress, which lets you print\r\nvirtually anything you can make on your computer

  body: In metal type, the @ symbol was a sort which you bought separately from fonts.
    Linotype had only one or two designs. Same with ATF and others, I suspect. The
    practice of designing it to match the design of a font is fairly recent.

  body: "I think the thing to do here would be to take Hrant's suggestion and go with
    polymer. I say this not only because it removes the issue of finding a metal face
    with @, but more importantly because of what Hrant has been talking about in terms
    of distinguishing between affectation and purpose/message.\r\n\r\nI've seen some
    extremely effective letterpress business cards and, to my mind, what made them
    stand out was the combination of old-school detail (quality paper, understated
    design, solid setting [kerning, etc.], good inking, firm but not killer impression)
    with new-school technology and design. That is, the easiest way to avoid the impression
    of preciousness with letterpress is to avoid using the standard faces that everyone
    who has a press has in hot or cold metal, and the best way to do that is to design
    & set your copy in polymer with a relatively distinctive digital font. (Unless,
    of course, you're into cutting, punching and casting your own type.)\r\n\r\nThis,
    it seems to me, would best convey your mandate/goal of \"using an old process
    to make something new\"."

  body: ">Is it nostalgia? Yep.\r\n>Is it fetishism? Nope.\r\n\r\nDesires that are
    out of the 'run of the mill' must be budgeted for. Several years ago I came across
    a graphic designer here in New Zealand who was on a similar mission (their own
    design on their own business card), except that they really, really wanted gravure
    printing, rather than letterpress. Their reasons for this were all about the craft
    and quality, although at that time there were still viable letterpress options
    here. Finally they realised that because there were no longer any 'jobbing' gravure
    presses in New Zealand, they would have to get the job printed in Australia. Needless
    to say, this just blew the budget right out of the water...\r\n\r\nUltimately
    they settled on a very ordinary offset job on some nice stock and left it at that.\r\n\r\nIf
    you are looking for further romanticism about traditional letterpress there is
    <a href=\"http://www.typeculture.com/academic_resource/movies/\">this lovely record</a>
    on Mark Jamra's TypeCulture site, which includes John Kristensens observation
    that 'letterpress will die...'\r\n\r\nBut I would listen closely to what Hrant
    and Jason are telling you about digital photopolymer letterpress. It sounds like
    for what you want, it's the way to go, as long as your typesetting reflects the
    medium it's intended for.\r\n\r\nUsual setting for @ (whether offset or letterpress);
    as Hrant says, the @ should be a couple of points smaller than the surrounding
    text, and baseline shifted so that it optically centres between baseline and x
    height.\r\n"

  body: I've had remarkably good success making photopolymer plates from Boxcar Press
    (http://www.boxcarpress.com/)  I bought the boxcar base, which is made from machined
    aluminum and gridded for alignment of the plates which come with a reusable adhesive
    backing.  The base is a bit of an investment, and I'd only recommend it if a)
    you are going to be doing more of this in the future or b) you need to do something
    larger than about 5 X 5 (just to retain flatness of the type surface)  The people
    at Boxcar Press are very helpful and have a section on their site which answers
    a lot of questions.  The ability to pair digital typography with letterpress printing
    opens so many interesting avenues.  Good luck
