body: "Here is proposal to make type trade more suited to nowadays:\r\n\r\nAware of
  the overwhelming aspects of type mutations of type and times forthcoming, we decided
  to make evolve our trade policy as following:\r\n\r\n1. We remind to all of you
  our values of independance & strive of high standards of quality\r\n2. We took into
  consideration the fact that the type market is now split in two: branding vs texting\r\n3.
  We shall further fight against type piracy, which is no noble hacking but first
  and foremost stealing our work, preventing us from earning revenues we need to live
  decently and fairly from our skills and business\r\n4. Therefore we decided our
  clients and public should be even better guided according to their actual needs
  and affordance (the price the customer can afford to pay)\r\n5. Here is now our
  guidance :\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/type_trade_4333.png]\r\n\r\n6.
  Label : to prevent piracy and get better evidence of it, all our of exclusive typeface
  will be labelled (digitally tatooed with random order number within copyright of
  type file) according to the line of products (red or black line) and per licensee.
  Any typeface without label or with irrelevant or fake label is therefore a proof
  of piracy/copyright infringment.\r\n7. \u201CDigital packaging\u201D : usb key (metal
  or wood) available upon request"

    not apply in this context; "cost" would be a better alternative.
