    and <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/solotype/goodfellow/\">Goodfellow</a>,
    imho.\r\n\r\nI can't pin your exact sample, but it looks like lots of wood type
    from the late 19th century. The category is generically known as \"latins\", and
    since your sample is in Italian, it's possible that it's even earlier, and may
    indeed have inspired the later British/American wood types cited above. On the
    other hand, it may also have been a later derivative. It's not all that artful,
    again imho.\r\n"
