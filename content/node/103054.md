  my great grandfather circa 1924-1925. My great grandfather utilized this typeface
  throughout his life as the identity for his business. Can anyone assist with it's
  identification or nearest modern day typeface that comes closest? \r\n\r\nThanks
  in advance...[img:sites/default/files/old-images/1_5561.png][img:sites/default/files/old-images/2_5237.png]"

  body: I think that's Festival by Stephenson Blake (also possibly by other foundries
    as well). There is a specimen of it [[http://luc.devroye.org/StephensonBlake1953/|here]].
    I have the actual catalogue and verified it.

  body: "Hi Atwe,\r\n\r\nYou are truly gifted with an eye for type! Seriously. My
    great grandfather was from England so its not a stretch to think he would have
    had access to Stephenson Blake's type catalog. To your knowledge has anyone brought
    Festival into the digital age?"

  body: I did find reference to a 1977 Stephenson Blake Type Catalogue in which Festival
    was referenced. There is hope for the digital typeface yet. Seen in this picture
    is the complete typeface. I'd say with absolute certainty that you were correct.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/sb_festival_5866.jpg]
