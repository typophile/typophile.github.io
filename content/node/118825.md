  uses <a href =\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/eurostile/pro-bold-extended-2/\"
  ) > Eurostile LT Pro Bold Extended #2</a>. I was wondering if you could give me
  some advice as to what font to choose to compliment the logo, when I'm aiming for
  a modern/clean look of the website.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance and have a nice day,\r\nKate"
