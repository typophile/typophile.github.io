  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">So I got to thinking that the at sign really shouldn't be aligned with the uppercase, since its primary use is in e-mail addresses, which are always correctly written in lowercase.

MS Character Design Standards however says:
<cite> Height alignment : Visually centers on the uppercase height, dependent on the typeface design.

<cite>Spacing : Visually center between uppercase H and O. </cite>

As an aside, this doesn't help me know what size to make the glyph and so I'm not fitting its upper and lower extrema to any particular heights. Instead its top is around three-quarters of the distance between the x line and the cap line, and the bottom around the same between the baseline and the descender line. This leaves the /a/ part floating in space around the centre of the x-height, which looks fine to me. Any thoughts?

		<div class="commentbody">Hrant, your point about the ampersand makes sense, and you could add other examples: a question mark should not look like the letter "q", and an eszett should not look like a long s and an s or a z merely joined together. I personally don't like the W made of two Vs simply overlaid either. In other words, we shouldn't be taking the etymological origins of symbols and letters literally in designing them.

But to me "@" has always been nothing more than an "a" with a circular swash, and the statement that you want people to see an "@" instead of an "a" makes as much sense to me as wanting people to see a "©" instead of a "c" in a circle.

Is it just me? Are there people who think of "@" as an independent symbol with nothing to do with "a"? Come to think of it, I see how people who have only ever typed "@" and never wrote it by hand may not ever make the connection between "a" and "@".</div>

In the case of the ampersand (for English readers like me), the visual 'et' and the semantic 'and' are unrelated, but for the at-sign the meaning (or better, the phonetic component - whether read aloud or heard "in the mind's ear") does start with "a" so I don't see a problem with a-like @'s.

This reasoning is also what I apply in demoting chirography in type design.

		<div class="commentbody">Hrant, this must be a difference of how we think of the "@" sign, because I think an "@" where the central component is stylized beyond recognition as an "a" will be more confusing to me.

Maybe this comes down to the fact that I'm more used to glyphs that may be confused with an overly-stylized "@". Koreans (and Japanese, I think) often make use of circled letters, and Thai numerals or Japanese hiragana contain many symbols containing a circular-swash-like element. So to me, what distinguishes "@" from an array of other similar symbols&mdash;indeed, the most characteristic trait&mdash;is the central "a" component.

I remember seeing other Koreans writing "@" as simply a circled "a". This is nothing more than anecdotal evidence, of course, but it shows that to some people the connection between "@" and "a" is really strong.

The situation may indeed be different for those who are not likely to use any other symbol that can be confused for the "@".</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Hrant, while I agree with the principle behind your suggestion, is there anything inherently unnatural about thinking of "@" as a swashy "a" symbol? Any more than thinking of "©" as "c" in a circle, for example? It's a convenient and intuitive way to think about the symbol, even for many non-English-speakers who have no idea that it is called the "at sign" in English. Take away the connection and we are left with a random scribbly hieroglyph that we'll never remember how to write. ;)

I'm also curious how one would move the design of the "@" away from the "a" component and still make it recognizable as an "@" to those who rely on the "a" component to distinguish it from similar symbols.

Just to make clear, none of the atypical "@" treatments that Bendy found (from Roadway, Jana Thork, Perla, and Letunical) look like "@" to me. Just because in my mind "@" is inextricably connected to "a" doesn't mean that just any "a"/"A" with a circular swash makes an "@". But Bendy's own "@" design to me is a perfect example of what an "@" should be shaped like. I'm curious how one would improve upon it.</div>

To me, that is nothing to worry about, at least no more than one would worry about the "d" looking too much like the "a" when you take away the ascender. The circular swash means the "@" will never, ever be confused with an "a". The focus should be on differentiating it from other circular-swashy characters, which admittedly isn't much of a problem for most westerners.</div>

Like what?

And always, think about the context: the "@" sign's main role now is email addresses. when you see it in a tightly-packed string of alphanumerics, what are the chances that it's going to be confused for the copyright symbol, versus an "a"?

For example if you see "nin@gmail.com" and the "@" has a honking "a" in it, you're much more likely to incorrectly see it as "nina@gmail.com".

> we’ll never remember how to write.

1) How often do we write [for other people] these days?
2) I myself have a hell of a time writing a "proper" "at" sign. It takes too long, I rush it, it comes out horrible. I'm better off writing something simpler, like a simple spiral.

> The circular swash means the “@” will

Never say never!
When you're in a hurry you have accidents. (But you still hurry.)

Hrant: <cite>For example if you see “nin@gmail.com” and the “@” has a honking “a” in it, you’re much more likely to incorrectly remember it as “nina@gmail.com”.</cite>

Thanks for this example. This makes much more sense.

I think we will agree that in the context of an email address, anything looking remotely like the "@" will immediately be recognized as such. But I still contend the expected shape for the "@" contains the "a" element, so that an isolated "@" without the "a" component may be tricky for some to recognize.

Some similar symbols, off the top of my head, include the Thai numeral one, one form of the Greek kai ligature, and possibly some Hiragana syllables. But really, you have to understand how fond Koreans are of using circled letters (both Hangul and Latin) and numerals to see why I am even talking about this. In everyday handwriting, these may well take on forms similar to the "@", with only the central components distinguishing one from the other.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Using the bass clef as the starting point for the design of a new at-sign... and drawing the conclusion that @ is not used much for its original purpose simply because it is now used more for a new purpose... both lack appeal to me, at least.

@ was used for E-mail addresses because its original use gave it a semantic link to "at", which has a range of meaning - at a price, or at a location. If a new at-sign were developed just for E-mail, and displaced the old one among the easily available characters on a computer (otherwise, E-mail would become more difficult to use on older computers!) then when one used a computer for word processing as a typewriter, suddenly ASCII would no longer contain the old at-sign for commercial correspondence.

It's bad enough that the Euro isn't $EU, but has its own brand new symbol that typewriters and fonts don't already have. While new symbols are a fun exercise in creativity, from a practical standpoint they're to be avoided unless desperately necessary.</div>

Well, often distancing yourself from a behemothic power is quite practical! If I were European (and to some extent I am) I'd like to avoid a dollar sign in my currency at all costs (pardon the pun). And for example the Mexican currency symbol situation is totally lame.

And what is the "$", god-given? Or any other character for that matter? 
Symbols are «made» as they are needed, and the fact alone that the "€" is newer than the "$" shouldn't give it less of a right to exist. And while repurposing existing characters may be convenient,* much like Hrant said it brings with it a whole slew of other problems, like confusability, or the loss of specificity (?) for example with regard to a cultural/regional context.

(* But the need really isn't as pressing now as it used to be. Typewriters? Should their limitations really still be a deciding force for our character repertoire?)</div>

It's true that nowadays adding a character is trivial. Just go to Windows Update and downlaod a patch to your keyboard arrangement... and new fonts... and, presto! the new character prints on your screen and on your laser printer when you type ctrl-alt-5 or some such thing.

Back in the dark old days when people would have to run out and buy new typewriters - and when my habits of thought were formed, of course, bringing a new glyph into common use would create massive inconvenience and be an extremely slow process.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Brian – very good point that transforming a character into what is essentially a catch word glyph is quite limiting in terms of cultural/language context.
Still, in principle I think it's interesting and refreshing to see a designer going about making this character differently – who said they need to always share the same structure (that's certainly not "progress" either). Plus, it's an alternate.

BTW, I missed this the first time round:
<cite>"nin@gmail.com"</cite>
Reminds me of how people actually tried to capitalize on the formal closeness of "@" and "a" for a while, back when email was still a new and exciting thing. I even know somebody who registered <em>the part of her name that follows the first "a"</em> as a domain name, so she could have an email address that was simply her name with that "a" replaced by an "@". :-\
It's certainly very fortunate that that isn't really done anymore. The close association of "@" with "a" seems to have waned largely by itself, maybe simply due to the fact that the "@" symbol has grown to be seriously relevant, and is now largely "understood" as a character in its own right. All the less reason to make it look too much like an "a" if you think about it that way (but maybe also less reason to <em>completely</em> redefine its design…).</div>

I haven't checked lately, but, for some time, among some circles in Italy, there was/is the use of @ as a "gender agnostic" replacement for the usual female a and male o ending vowel. </div>

		<div class="commentbody"><cite>The close association of "@" with "a" seems to have waned largely by itself, maybe simply due to the fact that the "@" symbol has grown to be seriously relevant, and is now largely "understood" as a character in its own right. All the less reason to make it look too much like an "a" if you think about it that way (but maybe also less reason to completely redefine its design…).</cite>

I disagree.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Just yesterday, I saw a Korean write down her e-mail address making the @ an "a" in a circle. Now that I think of it, I've noted in the past looking at sign-up sheets and such that this is how the vast majority of Koreans write the @ in e-mail addresses; I was the type geek who insisted on a proper connected @ form. I can't even recall seeing another Korean who writes the @ like I do, although surely I can't be the only one.

The lesson, I think, is that we should keep in mind that how one sees a character is often more culture-dependent than one might think. Something to keep in mind when we discuss the designs of glyphs like the @ or numerals, asterisk, daggers, and such.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I was delighted to learn that @ used to have a companion symbol, a script r with a tail that also went around it in a partial circle - it was used as a currency symbol for the Reis... but although Brazil has brought back the Reis in place of the Cruziero, they no longer use that symbol.

One way to avoid the inconvenient need for completely new symbols... is to avoid discarding old ones.

Thus, I once designed the definition of a computer language in which a complex number could be specified as X + !Y, and the upside-down ! and ? from Spanish were used as unary operators to multiply numbers by j and k to form quaternions...</div>
