  body: 'I wonder if you haven''t made your job harder than it has to be. Two of the
    three characters in your logo (<strong>B</strong> and <strong>S</strong>) have
    curved strokes, so maybe you could try a different design that doesn''t rely so
    much on straight strokes. '

  body: "None say BSM. I'm seeing i and n, and even j. Also possibly 85n. If you are
    going for this block look, I'd try some versions with M the full height too and
    don't try any interlocking or cuts.\r\n\r\nI agree about wanting to see a more
    curved version. All three letters would work together nicely with Bauhaus-style
    geometry."
