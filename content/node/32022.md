  body: I'm trying to figure out how a store would sell those. I see a stack of the
    things in mixed order, and the customers rooting through the pile to get a Come
    In one instead of a Go Away one. Then they get home, install it at the door, and
    when they come back out later to admire it, think they bought the wrong one after
    all.
