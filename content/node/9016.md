body: 'Hi, <BR> <BR>I&#39;m working on a logo for a design house in Hamburg, Germany.
  The name of the company is &#34;Funkb&uuml;ro&#34;, which roughly translates as
  &#34;Broadcast Bureau&#34; and is both a reference to their location in the vicinity
  of a major radio station as well as a hint about the nature of design as something
  you send out into the world. <BR> <BR>The company wants to position itself in the
  &#34;quality sector&#34; of this, highly competitive market. Thus, the subtitle
  is &#34;Manufaktur f&uuml;r Gestaltung&#34;, which translates as &#34;Manufacture
  of Formgiving&#34; &#40;well, in fact it doesn&#39;t, because Gestaltung is one
  of those wonderful German words, that just don&#39;t translate into English without
  loss. Suffice it to say that it sounds better in German...&#41;. Anyway, here it
  is: <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/64457.gif" alt="Logo">
  <BR> <BR>The logo is a simple custom &#34;fb&#34; ligature loosely based on Futura
  lower-case, combined with a series of quarter-circles to represent radiowaves and
  the name of the company in upper-case Futura. The subtitle is FF Seria Sans Italic.
  <BR> <BR>The color &#40;dark red&#41; is loosely in the right ballpark, but at this
  stage I&#39;m not too concerned about that, as I believe that a logo must work in
  its most simple 2-color state. <BR> <BR>Anyway, I&#39;d be grateful for some feedback
  and especially whether you perceive the fb ligature as letters or as part of some
  weird abstract shape. <BR> <BR>Thanks.'

  body: I like it! <BR> <BR>There are 3 things that bug me/may need tweaking, in my
    opinion. They are all pretty minor. <BR> <BR>1. I realize that it&#39;s because
    of the interaction of the box, the type, and the &#39;waves&#39;, but the waves
    and the &#39;K&#39; in &#39;FUNK&#39; seem a bit close to the edge, but this is
    also because my eyes keep seeing the box, and ignoring the &#39;B&uuml;RO&#39;.
    Is there a plan to use just the square part? This isn&#39;t such a big deal, really.
    <BR> <BR>2. The terminal on the &#39;f&#39; looks too much like a &#39;j&#39;
    to me. I see the &#39;fb&#39;, but perhaps you should cleave off half of the bowl,
    or break the curve between the &#39;f&#39; and the &#39;b&#39; to strengthen the
    letters? <BR> <BR>3. The tagline feels odd to me. I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s
    the typeface, or the placement, or both. It just feels like the odd man out. It
    may be the &#39;close but not quite&#39; feeling of the Futura and the Seria Sans
    &#40;though I like both faces individually&#41;. However, I don&#39;t think I
    have a better solution for you. <BR> <BR>Again, I really like it, but somthing
    feels &#39;not quite right&#39; about it. Like it&#39;s just a bit too busy/complex/sectioned
    for the bold, simple concept and aesthetic. However, it&#39;s still a strong solution
    in its current form.

    the radio/tv rays break out of the box. &#40;Break out of the box

  body: I think the radio waves would benefit from being different weights as they
    expand from the b, I can&#39;t quite work out whether the weight should get heavier
    the further it goes out or lighter, but this would give some movement to them.
