body: In my writing and editing, I italicize punctuation adjacent to italic words,
  i.e., periods, commas, quotation marks. However, in the the case of possessives,
  I don't know if the following /s/ should also be italicized. What are the "rules"
  about italics and punctuation by themselves, in quotes, and within parenthesis?
  Any other guidelines? TIA.

  body: "In general: Italics followed by upright punctuation often cause collisions
    or uncomfortable gaps. Since kerning doesn\u2019t work across fonts (and even
    if it did, who would think of kerning italics against roman?)  and the two styles
    don\u2019t necessarily space well, I usually set the punctuation in italics in
    these cases. It is a structural hack, but it looks a lot better. This is not a
    one-size-fits-all approach. Sometimes it is more important to communicate a clear
    structure.\r\n\r\nFor the special cases: I don\u2019t know about any rules, but
    I would at least italicize posessive s. I tend to end the italizing at the next
    wordspace."

  body: Just to throw another style guide into the mix, Bringhurst says to italicize
    any punctuation following a word in italics. But he also says that parentheses
    and brackets should essentially never be italicized, even in the midst of italic
    text. He traces this to the "roman" forms of parentheses in Renaissance italic
    faces. You can choose whether to buy that or not.

    you italicize them (or design italic symbols, if you're a type designer) is an

    does have a way of handling this via the [MATH] table, wherein there is Italics
    correction. This isn't really implemented the same way as TeX, strangely, but
    that is another story. There is also the notion of cut-ins/outs for kerning purposes
    which would can also serve a similar function. Mind you, this wouldn't address
    the issue talked about here, which is more to do with being able to kern between
    fonts, which we can't do at the font level. Of course, mathematics typeset using
    proper Unicode-encoded text would infer a font that has the math italics in the
    same font as the regular glyphs. The math italic glyphs themselves would usually
    have differing spacing (and perhaps even glyph shapes) then would their 'normal'
    italic counterparts\u2014all these constituents together allow for the proper
    spacing of text within a math context, but doesn't really help if the font doesn't
    support math layout (or if the typesetting environment doesn't either). There
    was talk of actually implementing a means of interaction between fonts (in terms
    of dynamic spacing) within an OpenType Math environment for inline maths (as opposed
    to display maths), but I don't know that its been implemented anywhere yet."

    Its implementation is a bit odd, and in relation to math kerning and the existence
    of unique math italic characters, somewhat redundant. Its application to integrals
    is another issue. Alas, it was pretty much a done deal by the time we got involved
    in building the first (OpenType) math font."
