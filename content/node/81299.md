  body: The first several pages of Google results for "retro 3d font", "handdrawn
    3d font","3d cursive font", "retro cursive font," etc. Those searches brought
    up a lot of results from urbanfonts.com, fontspace.com and the like, plus a few
    "30-45 (etc.) Quality Free Font" lists. Some of these had fonts I might be able
    to use in a pinch, but nothing I absolutely loved for this project. I was just
    curious to see if my typeface example rang any bells for anyone.
