  all,\r\ndoes anybody know the font used for the word \"BUCCANEER\"?\r\n\r\nAt a

  body: "To my knowledge, \u2018slanted\u2019 is not used to describe serif forms.
    Slanted is normally used for letters, words or fonts being skewed \u2018electronically\u2019
    i.e. by means of simple software modification and without any optical compensation.
    Or have I missed something?\r\nWhen you refer to the serifs in C and E, I\u2019d
    say something like: the diagonal serifs in C and E. Or are you pointing at something
    else?\r\n"

    Thank you!\r\n\r\nAlbert Jan Pool: sorry if the description was misleading, but
    English is not my native language and I am not a typography professional. I was
    indeed referring to the diagonal serifs in C and E."

  body: "Jut to add to the jargon, this type of serif on C is sometimes called a beak
    or arrowhead. Agree Caslon reg. is a match.\r\nDon"
