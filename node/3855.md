    some questions though... <BR> <BR>doesn&#39;t the area of the fovea depend on
    the distance the eye has from the text?.. <BR>and if so, then isn&#39;t the importance
    of the boumas &#40;in the parafoveal area&#41; comparatively small &#40;because
    of having more letters in the fovea&#41;?.. or not?.. <BR> <BR>another thing is
    that, to me, readability depends also on the reading habits with which somebody
    has grown up...  <BR>as i can speak for myself, growing up in germany with those
    clean letterforms and after twenty years getting in touch with my greek roots,
    greek letterforms appeared disturbing to my eyes... <BR>although greek letterforms
    have more ascenders and descenders, german &#40;well,.. latin&#41; still appears
    more legible to me... <BR> <BR>i don&#39;t know, if i&#39;m now out of topic,
    but at least it was a comment... <BR> <BR>anyway, i&#39;m a fan of yours... <BR>

  body: '&#62; doesn&#39;t the area of the fovea depend on the distance the eye <BR>
    <BR>Yes, but notice that our arms are a certain length... That&#39;s why in normal
    conditions &#40;optimal type size, reading position, etc.&#41; the fovea spans
    about three letters, and accounts for only about 1/3-rd of reading. When you have
    a small book, you hold it closer, and the type can/should be smaller. And when
    you have a large book, you lay it down somewhere, and the type can/should be larger.
    <BR> <BR>&#62; readability depends also on the reading habits <BR> <BR>Yes, &#34;familiarity&#34;
    is the second important component of reading. But it&#39;s even less understood
    than our reading &#34;hardware&#34;... For example, is it gained in years, or
    minutes? The answer would be extremely relevant, but we just don&#39;t know yet.
    <BR> <BR>&#62; latin&#41; still appears more legible to me...  <BR> <BR>&#42;Legible&#42;,
    yes, and &#42;inherently&#42; so. A writing system with more regularity &#40;e.g.
    less extenders&#41; appears more legible, because our consciousness is foveal,
    and everything is clear. A writing system that&#39;s less regular &#40;e.g. more
    extenders&#41; is actually mroe &#42;readable&#42;, because things are less ambiguous
    in the parafovea. This is also why sans serif forms appear more legible than serif
    forms, but a book in sans is no fun to read. <BR> <BR>For example, Armenian is
    more readable than Latin, but less legible; the former is better for books, the
    latter better for posters. This is because of the difference in vertical information.

    while i&#39;m reading a text, my eyes are moving... which means that the fovea
    isn&#39;t static... if i stop reading and try to focus on a word, again i have
    the impression that my eyes are in motion... maybe i need new glasses... the thing
    i want to say is that, to me, the foveal and the parafoveal areas are overlapping,
    because a text is meant to be read... and i think those informations we get while
    reading, reach unconsciously our brain which is still a terra incognita by itself...
    <BR> <BR>&#62; This is also why sans serif forms appear more legible than serif

    on the purpose anybody&#39;s chosing between serifs and sans... if you want to
    read a book, surely serifs help you to keep a fluent flow in your reading... but
    if you want to read a manual or something more instructional, then i think sans
    are more suitable... so it&#39;s not only about the fun of reading, but also of
    understanding the content of what you&#39;re reading... <BR> <BR>but again: thank

    an illusion. Reading proceeds in jumps and stops - I was shocked too when I first
    found out! This was discovered only about 100 years ago. <BR> <BR>On the other
    hand, there is something called &#34;micromovement&#34;: an extremely small vibration
    of the eyes &#40;smaller than the smallest feature on a letterform&#41; which
    seems to keep vision &#34;awake&#34; - when micromovements are suppressed, everything
    goes gray... Micromovement is below the scope of reading, but I guess it&#39;s
    possible that you can see &#34;feel&#34; it when you fixate for a long time? <BR>
    <BR>&#62; understanding the content <BR> <BR>I agree that the style of a typeface
    helps create context for the content. But especially during immersive reading,
    that&#39;s limited. For any text more than a few paragraphs, sans fonts will cause

    think it might not be &#42;that&#42; bad, since the eyes are pretty close&#42;,
    relative to the span of vision. I suspect your left eye can see about half what
    your right eye can see anyway. The issue of depth is more significant, but maybe
    not for reading? <BR> <BR>&#42; Unless you&#39;re a rat. Did you know that rats
    have a blind area some distance in front of their noses? Very valuable information...

    <BR>From what I remember, there have been perception tests done on people with

    offhand. <BR> <BR>What I also wonder is whether there&#39;s a &#42;cognitive&#42;
    issue here, since each half of the brain does different types of tasks, and each
    eye shares half of its retina between them. There&#39;s a book called &#34;The
    Alphabet and the Brain&#34; which tries to show that reading rightward is inherently
    more efficient than leftward, irrespective of the writing system &#40;which is
    related to this issue&#41;. I wasn&#39;t entirely convinced, but the foundation

    a guideline. But actually, my statement was an over-simplification &#40;probably
    my functionalist side having too much say - again...&#41;, and it depends on the
    kind of text. <BR> <BR>There is the raw text, then there&#39;s the &#34;atmosphere&#34;
    that the font conveys, and they have to be balanced. For example, in a coffee-table
    book about Paul Klee, it&#39;s sad, but nobody&#39;s going to read all that fodder,
    so it might make more sense to use a sans no matter how much text there is. But
    if you want to reduce obstacles to the absorbtion of textual meaning, serifs help.
    The reason is simple: they help meld letters into words. <BR> <BR>&#62; The right
    eye sees the word 1st <BR> <BR>Actually, the left halves of each retina see it

  body: ' On readibility <BR> <BR>I am especially curious about the readibility of
    text when it comes to choose a sans serif or a serif face for the bodytext. It
    seems to me that to some degree, it is a matter of the art director&#39;s taste,
    excluding the obvious examples where anyone can find it hard to read a text regardless
    of the serif condition of the typeface. Do you guys know &#40;especially Hrant&#41;
    if there&#39;s a scientific study on readibilty, one that can actually provide
    sources of information and methodology of the process?  <BR> <BR>  I am somewhat
    opposed to the occasional discrimination toward sans serif for the running text
    of a publication, thinking that a study of the particular typeface involved in
    the design is more judicious than applying a general rule that might keep someone
    from conveying a message in a more direct way just because the general feeling
    is that sans serif will cause fatigue. <BR> <BR>   In a book by Rob Carter &#40;Working
    with computer type, Rotovision SA, Switzerland ISBN: 0823064794&#41; he says:
    &#34;Due to the horizontal movement created by serif typefaces, it was believed
    for some time that serif letterforms were more readable than sans serifs; however,
    readability studies have proved that there&#39;s little difference between them.
    Tracking for example, has a lot more importance than that&#34; &#40;words might
    vary a little: translated form a non-english text&#41;. Unfortunately he doesn&#39;t
    elaborate on this point to fill us in on what his sources were. <BR> <BR>   Other
    than that I think that Hrant&#39;s research is interesting and I will be very
    curious to see more of it. Thanks for making it available to everyone, Hrant.

    serifs help in readability &#40;although they actually hurt &#42;legibility&#42;,
    since they confuse the individual letter-structures&#42;&#41; isn&#39;t because
    they guide the eye &#40;through horizontality or anything else&#41;, it&#39;s
    simply because they help individual glyphs blend into boumas. <BR> <BR>&#42; This
    difference in legibility and readability is central to a good understanding of
    type design, and it parellels the difference between contemplation and immersion,
    between display and text type, between consciousness and the subconscious, etc.
    There is certainly a lot of overlap between readability and legibility, but there
    is opposition too: you could say they&#39;re at a 90 degree angle. <BR> <BR>Also,
    the use of type is indeed more important, not least because there are more bad
    type users than type designers! :-&#41;  No matter how readable a font is, bad
    setting can kill it. However, if one assumes good basic setting, the font&#39;s
    readability does become a factor. And anyway, anything else is outside the scope
    of the type &#42;designer&#42; to begin with... <BR> <BR>Readability studies...
    what can one say? Most are flawed, and even the good ones can&#39;t be taken as
    gospel. They end with a concluding paragraph &#40;because that&#39;s the way formal
    science works these days - you gotta earn your grant, baby&#41;, and those never
    really make enough sense. Ignore the &#34;concluding&#34; stuff, look &#42;inside&#42;,
    and don&#39;t expect too much. Why is this the case? Because reading is friggin&#39;
    &#42;complicated as hell&#42;! :-&#41;  But honestly, if you spend enough time
    looking through a large number of individual studies, seeing if they&#39;re useful,
    exactly what they shed light on, etc. and you couple that to overall cognitive
    studies &#40;like those of Herman Bouma&#41;, then you can start to see the model
    converging in your head, you start seeing the dark as a half-light. You start
    seeing that serifs help &#40;and how they help&#41;, you start seeing that divergence
    helps &#40;much more than the mainstream type designer will allow his aesthetic
    sensibilities to admit&#41;, and a bunch of other things. <BR> <BR>But hey, don&#39;t
    take my word for it, really! :-&#41;  See what Javal, Ovink, Patterson &amp; Tinker,
    Bouma, Taylor, Spencer and others have found, and check out some lo-fi designs
    by Mandel, Tracy, Carter and other true master craftsmen &#40;as opposed to &#34;artiste&#34;s&#41;,
    and chances are you can gain your own insight and teach us all some new things!
