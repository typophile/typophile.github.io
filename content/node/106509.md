  a problem with the web site lately?\r\nI just found Typophile about 4 weeks ago
  and while I lurked for a week I didn't have any problems loading the site whenever
  I wanted.\r\nThe first week after I signed up for membership I didn't have any trouble.\r\nExcept
  for only one day last week, I have had nothing but problems loading and navigating
  the Typophile web site.\r\nI keep getting time out messages saying something about
  site availability or that it may be down for maintenance.\r\nIs this the case or
  is it all on my end?\r\nI know my computer is not the newest but, I never have trouble
  like this anywhere else I go.\r\nI was assuming it was google trying to punish me
  for not switching to crome....\r\nEither way it is getting irritating to say the
  least.\r\nAny thoughts?\r\nThanks.\r\nMerl "
