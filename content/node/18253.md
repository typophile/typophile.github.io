  keep wanting to say it's a font called \"catherine\" but having no luck on the search
  queries. I was also wondering if anyone had suggestions for a good big type-reference
  book to have. I have the 'encylopaedia of typefaces\" by jaspert, one \"the solotype
  catalog\" and another called \"the type specimen book.\"\r\n\r\nthanks all."

    might find something generally similar (<a href="http://www.fontshop.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=catalog.fontdetail&displayfontid=C.113.0.5&attributes.sampleSize=24&sampleText=DREAM+OF+THE+RAREBIT+FIEND&sampleSize=24">ITC
