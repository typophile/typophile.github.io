  body: Could be DIN 16 and 17. Berthold used to sell them, but I <BR>can&#39;t find
    them anymore.

  body: I think Grant mentioned he had a Letraset catalog sporting <BR>these DINs,
    maybe he can show us a scan.

  body: Ahh, on demand - thanks Grant. I haven&#39;t seen the &#39;m&#39;  <BR>extensions
    on the names. That last bold one looks like <BR>another DIN I neglected to mention
    from Mecanorma  <BR>called Normalise DIN.

  body: Yeah, what about those Mecanorma fonts? We used to sell  <BR>them at FontShop
    but I haven&#39;t found them online yet. &#40;And  <BR>neither have I the Mannesman
    Scangraphic fonts&#41;. Anybody  <BR>knows where they can be found for online
    sampling?

  body: Yves, I&#39;ve come across a few Mecanorma fonts on the <BR>Agfa-Monotype
    website, but it&#39;s just been by chance <BR>&#40;searching for something else&#41;
    and Fonts.com offers <BR>no way, really, to do a search for Mecanorma fonts in
    <BR>general &#40;i.e., searching under MN or Mecanorma won&#39;t <BR>work&#41;.
    <BR> <BR>I did find <a href="http://www.agfamonotype.com/about/legal.asp" target="_blank">
    an entry</a> in the copyrights/trademarks, though. <BR> Check about 2/3 of the
    way down the page. <BR> <BR>MN Normalise DIN is one of several fonts that are
    listed <BR>there, but not actually offered for sale. <BR> <BR>According to <a
    href="http://www.myfonts.com/foundry/mecanorma/" target="_blank"> this</a> MyFonts
    page, Monotype licensed and <BR>digitized some Mecanorma typefaces, which explains
    <BR>their listing on the Fonts.com site. Anyone know the Trip <BR>Productions/Mecanorma
    status today? <BR><br>
