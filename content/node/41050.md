  body: "As nobody has posted anything yet I thought I'd drop my 2 pence.\r\nThis
    logo isn't really working for me. I might even say that I think that the name
    is a bit too obvious and design is always aimed at communication so the tagline
    also doesn't really work I think. If you use a name like that you can use a nicer
    tagline.. even something like \"making things looks pretty\" (was it Sagmeister
    who said that as an explanation of his work??), improving your view, enhancing
    your vision (maybe these aren't too great, but I just mean you can probably write
    something a bit more witty if you take some time to think about it).\r\nYou might
    also want to do some more mapping of other things that have to do with sharp eyes
    (blurry vision vs sharp vision). I'm not sure if the lettering works well inside
    the eye. You could also perhaps draw an eye (or even photograph a real eye or
    eyeball) and use that as a mark with \"Sharp Eyes\" written underneath.\r\n\r\nI
    think you need to experiment a bit more and try not to make everything too obvious.
    Also write down how you want your company to feel, what does it want to express.
    Just a few keywords to give yourself a certain feeling to what you want the logo
    to express.\r\n\r\ngood luck and hope to see some more examples of different styles.\r\ndav(2)"

  body: "Hi Dave,\r\n\r\nThanks for the feedback.  I was beginning to wonder if I'd
    violated some typophile unwritten law about posting!  Your comments make a lot
    of sense.  I chose a name that has personal meaning for me as it was a nickname
    my dad gave me when I was young.  I have a background in copy editing and typesetting
    as well as design, so the name is a hint at that.  I want a logo that has a corporate
    feel as those are the clients I seem to get, but you are correct in that I'm being
    a bit obvious/safe.  My thinking was that \"blurry vision\" didn't really give
    the connotation of  a company \"sharp, exact, precise and on their game.  I used
    the tagline because I thought graphic design was a bit too common.  Anyway, I
    posted for exactly this kind of feedback, so I'm back to my sketchpad!\r\n\r\nThanks
    Dave, I'll post again when I have something relevant to present.\r\n\r\nRussell"
