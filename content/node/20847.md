body: "how does one illustrate the schwa and the accents found in dictionary pronunciations?\r\n\r\ni
  am using franklin gothic book in an indesign document that requires the depiction
  of a dictionary-style pronunciation, but i cannot seem to find the schwa glyph.
  is it just a matter of using a different font that includes the schwa or is there
  an easy way to rotate the lowercase 'e' without creating a separate text box?\r\n\r\ni
  thought perhaps i might find it in something like times new roman or another common
  serif, but i don't see it in my glyph palette. is there something i am missing?\r\n\r\nany
  help is greatly appreciated!"

    you\u2019ll probably have to rotate it. What program are you using? I got this
    funny feeling that in Illustrator CS 2 you could rotate letters within the same
    text box. I haven\u2019t got it so I can\u2019t test that.\r\n\r\nOf my currently
    installed fonts, only Helvetica, Lucida Grande, Monaco and Times have schwa.\r\n"
