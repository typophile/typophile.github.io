  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Hey guys,

I've finally got some money saved up and have been looking at buying either Benton Sans or News Gothic No.2. 

Benton is what Frere Jones redrew after studying Morris Fuller Bentons original drawings of News Gothic. While News Gothic No.2 is a family of news gothic with additional weights created by Linotype.

http://www.fontbureau.com/fonts/BentonSans/more

have a look to see some comparative images. I felt that benton had some issues with the size of the counters especially in the heavier weights and some issues with the kerning. is it just me? What do you guys think? Benton was used to type set 2 Kilo's of KesselKramer and it looks good there. So am quite confused right now.

What would you spend your money on?

Thanks for the time!

		<div class="commentbody">> the different weights 

The width of the left vertical stem of the capital H may be used as a measurement for the different weights.

see www.sanskritweb.net/temporary/stem-width-1.jpg

A peculiarity of the old News Gothic (and also of the later Trade Gothic) was that the normal weight of News Gothic was thinner than the normal weight of other fonts, but thicker than the light weight of other fonts.

If we apply a UPM of 1000 units, then the normal weight of Helvetica has a stem width of 97 units (or 9.7 % of the em), and the light weight of Helvetica has a stem width of 68 units (or 6.8 % of the em), whereas the normal weight of the old News Gothics is exactly in-between. For instance, the normal weight of News Gothic BT is 79 units (and for example the normal weight of Trade Gothic LT is 80 units).

But the normal weight of Benton Sans has 88 units and therefore is too thick.

see www.sanskritweb.net/temporary/stem-width-2.jpg

If you prefer the in-between weight peculiarity of the old News Gothic font, you should use old digitisations, e.g. News Gothic BT, which is a clone of the old Linotype News Gothic.

Your statistical evaluation of what's 'good' and 'bad' is not much better than your evaluation of type talent.

It is the "book" weight, not the "normal" in Benton Sans that seems to most closely match the original News Gothic. </div>

		<div class="commentbody">Based on what I saw on the Font Bureau page that was linked I prefer News Gothic #2. There is something about the way the letters are drawn that I like more than Benton Sans. It seems a little more graceful and dynamic. That's my personal opinion though. If I were you I'd take a look at how each is drawn and decide which one you think looks better... I think that is what is REALLY important.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">In metal Lightline Gothic, News Gothic, Alternate Gothic and Franklin Gothic work together really well. But now that I think about it I don’t know if the digital revivals would work together in the same way because so many have been tweaked to work as families on their own. I’ll suggest to Paul Shaw that we comp them together in his next book.</div>
