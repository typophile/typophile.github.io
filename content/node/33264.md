body: "Kind regards to everyone here in these Typophile discussions.\r\n\r\nI'd like
  to humbly ask for some recommendations on typefaces which\r\nare designed with inking
  in mind. I'm a bit unsure of the exact terminology\r\napplied to these details /
  essentially it's a slight cut into the joints of the character\r\nthat's there to
  account for bleed when inking + printing .\r\n\r\nThe LINO version of a new face
  OLGA has exactly what I'm looking for / \r\nPlease check this link for the example
  :\r\n\r\nhttp://www.tdc.org/news/2007Results/Olga.html\r\n\r\nYou'll notice the
  notches in the LINO version -\r\nCan anyone here recommend some other faces with
  notch details ? ? ? \r\n\r\nMy Sincerest Thanks In Advance . \r\n\r\n\r\nBless,\r\n\r\nAerosyn-Lex\r\n\r\n"

  body: "These notches are called [[ink traps]]. Their utilitarian purpose is to prevent
    the tight corners of a small letterform from getting too much ink in the printing
    process. But they can have an aesthetic value as well. \r\n\r\nI agree that Olga
    is very interesting. <a href=\"http://www.krizbi.de/olga/text/text.html\">Here's
    a statement from designer Christina Bee</a>.\r\n\r\nOther typefaces with conspicuous
    ink traps:\r\n<a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/linotype/bell_centennial_virtual/\">Bell
