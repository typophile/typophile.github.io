  Does anyone recreating medieval texts (or imitating them in advertising, book cover
  design, etc.) have a standard Pantone color that best represents these? Absolute
  precision isn't necessary; I'm just trying to invoke the (admittedly large and diverse)
  era through the color of the text.\r\n\r\n(By the way, there is a [[http://www.amazon.com/PANTONE-SMART-19-3933X-Swatch-Medieval/dp/B004O7C1B6|Pantone
  \"medieval blue\"]] but it is darker than the typical blue used in medieval texts,
  which is more like [[http://www.cmrs.ucla.edu/links/plate_links.html|this]].)"

    to the nice people over at http://www.alterlittera.com/ (http://typophile.com/user/183250/contact)
    which do a fine job at reproducing medieval texts (see http://typophile.com/node/89526

  body: I am sure I'll be corrected if wrong but a likely colourant would have been
    ultra marine blue (ground lapis lazuli) which appears to be between Pantone 653
    C or 634 (I'd say on the lighter side since an ink would a transparent wash that
    would allow the white of the substrate to show through.

  body: "Are you printing on non-white background to simulate age? The ink color will
    be affected if its printed on colored stock. Same thing if a background color
    is printed on white paper and then colored text overprints it (unless the background
    color is knocked out under the type). \r\n\r\nA good print shop should be willing
    to do an ink drawdown (test) for you by applying the PMS ink to a swatch of the
    actual stock. Based on the results they can tweak the ink color a bit, if necessary,
    before printing begins."
