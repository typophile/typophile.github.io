  body: Super-tight was a '70s thing. Still relatively tight in the '80s, but on its
    way out. Designers setting things super-tight now are making a reference to the
    '70s. I don't think anyone thinks it's a better way to set type the way they did
    back then (and they did!).

  body: On a personal note, when I became seriously interested in type during high
    school in the early '70s, it was this super-tight style that got my attention,
    and I enthusiastically imitated it on things like the school paper and yearbook.
    By the time I was employed as a designer in 1976, my tastes in spacing had become
    a bit more sophisticated. Part of me still likes the look, while the rest of me
    wonders what they were smoking.

  body: Well for this logo I think the impression that the type is busting (so to
    speak) out of its  seams is particularly appropos.
