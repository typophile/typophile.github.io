  body: Very similar to Adobe Caslon using swash figures for the caps. The only one
    that doesn't completely match is the "M"; that is a combination of the normal
    M and the swash M without the swash descender. The caps at the top of the sign
    appear to be Sabon using old style numbers.

    and its type is not from the 1920s. '
