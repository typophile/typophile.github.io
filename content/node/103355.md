  would be nice to know. I've only seen it on Windows computers, and have seen it
  many times before. Does anyone know this font's name, if so... is it also downloadable?\r\n\r\n
  \   In this specific case, this was just a screenshot I took from a youtube video.
  Do not mind what is says, it won't make any sense. Heh Heh. \r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Screen
