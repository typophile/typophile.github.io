  Margin Alignment option. Does one need to use tabs to handle the beginning of every
  line so that punctuation can be pulled out?\r\n\r\nAlso, does anyone else think
  that this feature would benefit from more control options in future versions? Perhaps
  boxes limiting it to punctuation and an option to tell it what letters to hang?"

  body: "Hanging punctuation in InDesign has been an embarrassment from the get-go,
    along with the 'optical kerning' feature that wrecks all reasonably well-spaced
    fonts, most pertinently Adobe's own. (Yikes! The emdashes hanging out of the margin
    like smuts on an old-fashioned mechanical!) However, of all programs, Ventura
    Publisher has long done it right, with customizable hanging punctuation, and Quark
    8 does it even better, with a deep range of customization options. We can expect
    to see Quark's feature in the next InDesign, and perhaps, at last, we'll see an
    end to optical justification. What is the matter with it? \r\n\r\nHere's an example
    I've often given before. Let's look at what optical kerning does to one of Adobe's
    own state-of-the-art fonts, Adobe Garamond OT Pro. Consider the simple word 'jumps'
    at 12 points. This word sets perfectly and doesn't require any kerning. It has
    been carefully optimized by Adobe's well-known and absolutely competent font designer
    Robert Slimbach to have perfect spacing at this point size. No kerning or respacing
    is needed.\r\n\r\nNow let's specify Adobe's 'optical' kerning. InDesign subtracts
    23 units of space between j and u, adds 14 units between u and m, subtracts 16
    units between m and p, and -1 units between p and s. The result is bad. The u
    is now too close to j, and there is a noticeable river of space between u and
    m. A well-made font has been rendered useless. \r\n\r\nWhat is it with marketing?
    Adobe tells you it's bringing you fine typography at last. You believe it -- what's
    to doubt? A gazillion years later it begins to occur that this isn't so.\r\n\r\nWhat
    are we on? Indy <em>5</em>? Oh come on! "

    href=\"http://www.microsoft.com/typography/OTSPEC/features_ko.htm#opbd\">Optical
    Bounds</a> OpenType Layout feature in InDesign. If present in the font, it should
    override the results of the built-in automatic optical bounds calculation. Therefore,
    to customize the result of the optical margin alignment, the user would just need
    to add an \"opbd\" feature to the font using any of the existing font editing
    applications. \r\n\r\nThis would be a solution very \"cheap\" for Adobe as they
    would not need to add any UI for the stuff in InDesign (something that most product
    manager find horrifying), and they would not need to invent anything new (just
    implement what is specified in the OpenType spec). \r\n\r\nBTW, I agree that the
    current results of the optical margin alignment in InDesign are not so good, and
    for some glyphs (e.g. the \u2013 or the \u2014 ) they are just horrific. \r\n\r\nAdam\r\n"

  body: "I agree that (automatic) optical margin alignment does not give good results
    in all cases. Especially with dashes which Adam mentioned.\r\n\r\nSaying goodbye
    to automatism, even gradually, is not a solution though:\r\n1st, I remember the
    time before optical margin alignment, with all the 'bites' with punctuation marks
    and certain letters. And also remember that <em>earlier</em> XPress simply placed
    punctuation marks outside of the text block, which was the same but the other
    way round ... InDesign's optical margin alignment was an improvement to both.*\r\n2nd,
    'opbd' is nice for type designers who want to do it all on their own, and in the
    extreme case would define correction values per each glyph. But still, this is
    just one set of correction values for all sizes, whereas automatic optical margin
    alignment has a size parameter. (So to extend what Adam suggests: if a font supports
    'opbd', use it, but if a user activates optical margin alignment, use that instead
    of 'opbd'.)\r\n\r\nI would encourage improving the algorithm rather than going
    back to manual tweaking. The latter is fine with a single font, or two, or three.
    Whether in the font editor or in the design application. But if this tweaking
    can be expressed in an algorithm, it makes sense to turn it into something automatic.
    Not on the font editor side but on the rasterizer or application side.\r\n\r\n*
    There is a funny effect: As long as technology determines esthetic standards,
    nobody complains nor even sees that something is wrong. Like, most people were
    fine with the ragged margins that result from relying on glyphs' side bearings.
    But as soon as optical margin alignment arrived, people started talking about
    dashes and certain letters standing out more than they expected etc ... These
    are minor issues compared to what we had before."

    points, I've always been bothered when trying to square off a paragraph (without
    automatic \"Optical\" alignment)--the period is never far enough to the right,
    because of its right sidebearing.\r\n\r\nAn optical alignment setting that removed
    all marginal sidebearings would be good for bold faces.\r\n\r\n**\r\n\r\nI agree
    with Bill about the counterproductive effect of Optical kerning on serif faces.
    However, it's not too bad on sans serif types and in mixed-font situations. If
    someone is picky enough and savvy enough to apply this feature, wouldn't they
    also be aware that it isn't foolproof, and use it with discretion? There are exceptions
    of course, for instance those who apply it indiscriminately as their own personal
    default."

    manual trick is inserting a hair space first, so you can use kerning to move the
    character up to 1000 units out to the left.</cite>\r\n\r\nIf you make up a zero
    width space (U+200B), you can also kern against it. Since it has zero width, you
    can change the out-dent by (1) changing the size of the character, (2) the kern
    value (limited to 999 units), or both. I had an oops the first time I did this,
    kerned something right off the paper using a 100-point space with a (minus) 999-unit
    kern. If you think on it, a 12 point zero-width space with a 1,000 unit kern is
    a pica. A 24-point space with the same kern would be 2 picas, etc.\r\n\r\nOn a
    larger scale, the problem is always what to hang. Back in the 1990s when we were
    using TeX, we had a customer who played with hanging punctuation. You could, technically,
    program whatever you wanted. But you'd run into problems -- with close single
    quote followed by close double quote, what do you hang? All of it? Just the double
    quote? How about a em-dash? en-dash? How about a dash followed by a close quote?
    And even ignoring sidebearings, you're never going to get all the optical whitespace
    out of the different letters, so they form an optical rule -- the old question
    of how much ink does it take before it is too significant to hang?"

  body: "<em>Optical margin alignment is an entirely different thing than optical
    kerning.</em>\r\n\r\nThomas is right. The vocabulary is unfamiliar and it is perilously
    easy to make a mistake, as I did when I wrote 'optical justification' for 'optical
    kerning'.\r\n\r\nIt is painful to have to criticize InDesign's optical kerning
    because it represents years of work by Peter Karow, founder of URW, without whom
    we would not have digital type. Yet it needs to be done, as optical kerning only
    works for some very badly spaced fonts and in some mixed type-size-style situations.
    It's partly a marketing problem: too much was claimed for it; there was not enough
    information; expectations were too high. It was years before we discovered that
    InDesign's optical kerning respects only O-O as the one possible valid space/kern
    in a font it is adjusting (or something like that -- John Hudson worked it out
    after he had been alerted to the problems it caused in the Microsoft ClearType
    booklet he designed). I can't find a system based on this convincing, but if users
    had been warned this system was only likely to be valuable in certain limited
    situations, most possible criticism would have been deflected.\r\n\r\nThat said,
    optical kerning represents only a fraction of the ambitious HZ composition system
    that was long ago conceptualized by Dr Karow and others. To be implemented properly
    it requires multiple master fonts with at least a width axis. We must hope that
    Adobe is still giving it some back-burner development time, despite the expectation
    that it would be a decade or two before it could be implemented. \r\n\r\nAnd that
    said, I really do think Adobe was right -- over the piteous wailings of righteously
    outraged type purists -- to implement, as an interim stopgap, the feature of horizontal
    scaling as a tightly controllable element of H&J in InDesign CS3. Used judiciously,
    a percent here and there of horizontal scaling should not be objectionable. It's
    a long way away from HZ, but it's a decisive step in the right direction.\r\n\r\nAnd
    all of that said, I wonder if some of the systems discussed on Typophile for auto-spacing/auto-kerning
    a few years back by Raph Levien and others could possibly represent an advance
    on Dr Karow's earlier algorithms? \r\n\r\nAnd all of that said, some criticism
    of <em>optical alignment</em> could have been deflected had the philosophy of
    the settings been 'only do it enough so that a user won't notice it' instead of
    'do it enough so the user will really notice it'. "
