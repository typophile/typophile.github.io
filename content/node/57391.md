body: "What font management application do you guys use? \r\n\r\nI have for quite
  some time been using Linotypes Font Explorer because it was free. But i have never
  been very happy with it. So i have decided to switch over to something else, like
  Suitcase Fusion 2 or the newer Fontcase which have a nice iPhoto / iTunes layout,
  with some good preview features. But before i start paying for something, i would
  like to know what you prefer.\r\n\r\nSo what do you prefer?"
