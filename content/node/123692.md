    Serial (Bold)]]</strong> by SoftMaker [1991]\r\nThe 2nd one is a bit closer to
    your sample but although is available for purchase from myfonts.com, take into
    account that it's probably a clone and not an original design as most of SoftMaker's
    fonts under the '-serial' suffix/trick.\r\n<strong>[[http://www.findmyfont.com/index.php/fonts/font-preview?fset=CanadaType%20%2F%20%28Commercial%29&ffam=Sol%20Pro%20-%20Medium&fid=a776335d7538528c359ca5c03b045308&fsize=60&text=MegaFileUpload&wrap=2|Sol
    Pro (Medium)]]</strong> by Canada Type [2010] is another similar.\r\nThere are
    also at least 2 similar freebies out there (probably illegal clones).\r\n"
