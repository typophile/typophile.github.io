body: "Offenbacher Haggadah from 1927\r\n\r\na limited private print for [[Rudolf
  Koch]]s friend notary Dr. Guggenheim. [[Max Dorn]], Offenbach was the artdirector/layouter/executive
  printer for this project. The book was printed in two colors on [[Zerkall]] B\xFCtten
  paper including 12 handcolored illustration pages by [[Fritz Kredel]]. The uniqueness
  is the combination of the [[Jessen]] Schrift (a gothic blackletter design) and hebrew
  typefaces.\r\n\r\nIt contains also pages with musical notes cuted in type by [[Rudolf
  Koch]]s son Paul who worked by this time as apprenticie in the print office of [[Klingpor]].\r\n\r\nThe
  work was set in the 14pt pre-final version of the later called Peter-[[Jessen]]-Schrift.\r\n\r\nThe
  price was in 1928 60RM, no easy money by this time. Today you have to pay between
  600 - 1000 Euro, if you have the chance to get some of these rare items. \r\n\r\nA
  public copy is available at [[Deutsche B\xFCcherei]], Leipzig at the </em>Lesesaal
  des Deutschen Buch- und Schriftmuseums</em> (Typespecimen library) (ask for item
  <strong>1927 B 3622</strong>) and in the library of the [[Klingspor-Museum]]. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
