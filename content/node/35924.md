body: "I'm looking for a fresh, sophisticated alternative for LinoLetter Black/Black
  italic for a logotype. Any ideas?\r\n[[http://www.linotype.com/9214/linoletterblackitalicosf-font.html]]\r\n\r\nCan
  you tell me more than the quoted text below about LinoLetter, especially the \"curved
  slab\" serif-form? Are they unique, inspired/used by Font-??\r\n\r\nLinotype writes:
  \"Designer: Linotype Design Studio, 1992. In the 1980s, Linotype worked with the
  Basel School of Design (Switzerland) to create a new typeface that <!--break-->would
  be maximized for optimum legibility. Professor Andre G\xFCrtler oversaw the research
  for the project, along with Reinhard Haus and the Linotype Design Studio. The goal
  was to create a typeface to work with contemporary typesetting and printing technologies.
  Linotype released the result, LinoLetter, in 1992. Legibility typefaces are designed
  for printing under the poorest and most varied of conditions; LinoLetter is therefore
  ideal for newspaper work as well as other mass-produced printed pieces.\"\r\n\r\nthanks\r\n\r\nThorsten

  body: "Thanks Stephen,\r\nNapoleone and Pacella are new to me and Nexus Mix Bold
    italic and Zine Display slab italic are good alternatives too.\r\n\r\nBest\r\n\r\nThorsten\r\n\r\nPS:
    Unfortunately the direct fontshop.com-links only work irregularly, often I'm redirected
    to the fontshop.de-homepage."

  body: Yes, it's an unfortunate side effect of the fact that FontShop Germany has
    its own site. We're working on a better solution. In the meantime, each link should
    work on second click.
