  was inspired by the amusing double entendre of the phrase \"A-holes\"\u2014the technical
  term for the negative space in a letter A (this space is actually called the \"counter\").
  Letters' negative space might seem irrelevant, but it determines a lot about the
  character of a font. As the book shows, the shape of a hole can tell you if a font
  is a serif or sans serif, and it can tell you where elements like the stroke, crossbar
  or bowl are located. Holes are like a traceable pattern, giving you clues about
  a typeface without seeing it.\r\n\r\nThough I know his idea would make for a fun
  coffee table book, I also wanted it to be an educational tool for learning about
  type. I include sections on \"A-hole Anatomy\" (labeling the parts of a typeface)
  and \"Historic A-holes\" (a timeline of the negative spaces in fonts over the past
  200 years).\r\n\r\nYou can find the complete details here:\r\nhttps://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1713840944/a-holes-a-type-book\r\n\r\n<img
