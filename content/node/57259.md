body: "My girlfriend has been looking for an upscale restaurant job in Seattle for
  months now.  She has a great resume, but I finally realized we needed to do something
  to really make it pop.\r\n\r\nI'm not a designer, but I thought maybe we could pick
  a lovely display font for her name at the top of the page and make it big and bold
  so she has some distinctive branding.  Then, instead of an \"Objective\" we could
  just put some kind of snappy one-line tagline.\r\n\r\nFor the display font, we both
  fell in love with Mousse Script Regular:\r\nhttp://new.myfonts.com/fonts/sudtipos/mousse-script/regular/
  \r\nin a dark navy.\r\n\r\nBut... I'm having a hard time matching it to a good typeface
  for the rest of the document.  She likes Palatino with its serifs and kind of swoopy
  Q's, but it seems to look kind of old-fashioned next to the splashy header.  Is
  there some well balanced modern font (or a few suggestions) that might look good
  for the rest of her resume?\r\n\r\nAlso, what about the \"tagline\"?  You think
  it should also be in Mousse Script, or the text font?\r\n\r\nAfter looking through
  hundreds of different typefaces my brain is starting to go numb.  A talented eye
  would be so appreciated. "

  body: You could use something equally inky. I want to suggest <a href="http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/underware/dolly/">Dolly</a>
    but that might be cost prohibitive. What fonts do you already have access to?

  body: It looks great.  It's true, the thick letterforms complement Mousse Script
    really well.  Thank you for taking the time to look for me.  It's not something
    I have a great talent for so your eye is really appreciated.
