body: I've always been a fan of tattoo art. Not the spring break, "o my god, I'm so
  wasted" tattoo art, but the finely tuned, detailed stuff. When looking at it from
  a design perspective, you may one to check out a guy named Sailor Jerry. Jerry was
  the original, old school tattooer. Although simple, a lot of his stuff is interesting..[img:sites/default/files/old-images/flash_2_4980.jpg][img:sites/default/files/old-images/th_art7_4636.jpg][img:sites/default/files/old-images/th_Image2-1_3934.jpg]

  body: "Louie,\r\nYou are so fascinated by detail with all the work you show however
    when you post your own work I do not see that same intensity of detail. As you
    know detail takes a lot of time. I look forward to seeing the love you have for
    detail in your own work. \r\n\r\nHave you seen these typographic detailed tattoos?
    \r\nWhat do you think about these? Do you think type would be difficult to tattoo?\r\n\r\nI
    found these on this website: http://hubpages.com/tag/lettering+tattoos/hot\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/261796_f520_3842.jpg][img:sites/default/files/old-images/261821_f520_6238.jpg][img:sites/default/files/old-images/261803_f520_4513.jpg]\r\n\r\nor

  body: I  actually have my cousin's eulogy tattooed on my arm... she was a published
    poet, dying of cancer....she wrote her own before she died.. I posted part of
    it as one of my digi sketch projects. I can actually take a shot of the whole
    thing if you would like to see it[img:sites/default/files/old-images/-2_5253.jpg]

  body: 'I actually used the exact type that was on the back of the card that the
    funeral home had handed out...I know it sounds kind of weird, but I wanted to
    keep it as close to the original as possible. I actually get annoyed w/ it sometimes,
    every random person that sees a part of it will just come up to me, pull up my
    sleeve, and start reading it like I''m a book at the library. It''s been the source
    of many an intriguing conversation as well as the beginning of nights filled with
    bedlam and mayhem.. '

  body: "Louie,\r\n\r\nIf this is not too personal, I would love to see a scan of
    the original card from the funeral home.  My personal research is engraving and
    most of it is American commercial engraving which, traditionally, was used for
    the sea change occasions in life (birth announcements, christenings/confirmation/bar-bat
    mitzvah/wedding/bereavement.)\r\n\r\nNext week I go to Typecon to deliver \u201CEtiquette
    and Typography\u201D which includes the custom for printed bereavement cards.\r\n\r\nThere
    is an amazing Joan Didion book about dealing with illness and loss, \u201CThe
    Year of Magical Thinking\u201D, Vintage Books.  In it she talks about how western
    culture has forgotten the rules by which we mourn.  We used to have rigid codes
    for the passage through grief into morning and then return to everyday life.  But
    no longer, so every one of us is left on our own.  Some mourn with grace, others
    not so.  I personally think your treatment of dealing with your cousin's passing
    is beautiful and hope that it brings you peace with your loss.\r\n\r\nWhen my
    own mom died last year my uncle, her brother, asked me if I would like to take
    care of the bereavement acknowledgment cards.  My mom's family is in the funeral
    business and ordinarily the funeral home takes care of these details.  But, my
    business is engraving for social stationery, so, he asked.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/cFk_4357.jpg]\r\n\r\nAbove
    is my mother's original monogram engraved on the occasion of her marriage to my
    dad.  Notice the initials that she took, \u201CC\u201D for Charlotte, her given
    name.  The prominent \u201CF\u201D in center is her married name, Feldman, and
    the final \u201CK\u201D is her maiden name. *\r\n\r\nIn about 1990 I asked to
    borrow my mom's monogram plate then proceeded to loose it.  By then I had been
    working with a hand engraver who said he could replicate it.  Mom's die was engraved
    1951 (go to http://www.nancysharoncollinsstationer.com/2005/timetable.htm for
    the whole story.)  In the forty subsequent years the physical acumen required
    for such fine engraving as my mom\u2019s monogram had all but gone away.  My willing
    engraver was simply not up to the task and delivered a much less refined engraving
    for my mother's initials.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/cFk_4594.redo.jpg]\r\n\r\nIf
    you compare this brilliant rendition to the original white (top) monogram you
    will see how course the new die was.  The original was made up of four paralleling
    lines.  The new one has none of the delicacy inherent in engraving, it was just
    a course reproduction.  So I commissioned a third:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/cFk_redone_4658.jpg]\r\n\r\nBereavement
    acknowledgement cards are simple text, elaborations such as personal monograms
    are not usual.  Although not proper, something in me wanted my mother\u2019s final
    form of correspondence to hold her personal mark, so I decided to use her monogram.
    \ Below are the bereavement acknowledgment cards engraved for the occasion of
    my mother\u2019s funeral:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/cFk_3486.bereavement.jpg]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n*
    In 2001 I did a survey of society stationery shops across the country to find
    out trends in women\u2019s married names.  At that time about seventy five percent
    of women who married dropped their middle name, replacing it with their maiden
    name.  (My mother, who had been Charlotte Beth Kaufman before marriage, became
    Charlotte Kaufman Feldman when wed.)  This statistic is probably not the same
    today.\r\n"

  body: Sorry to hear about your mother. I think it's admirable that you took the
    time to create something beautiful in order to preserve her memory. Sometimes
    doing the "inappropriate" thing is better than doing what everyone else "expected".........we'll
    leave that at sometimes. Here's a scan of the poem on the card, I've e-mailed
    it to you as well. All together it took about eight hours to get the lines straight
    and to actually ink it, on my arm that is..   [img:sites/default/files/old-images/ejb_6683.jpg]
