  wine label. I would be happy if someone could help me with suggestions. If anyone
  happens to have suggestions on the words POMEROL and GRAND VIN it would make me
  even more happy. Thank you for taking an interest.\r\n\r\nPetter\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/petrus_label_5738.jpg]"

    realized your M has the legs spread. I wonder if this is all predigital type.\r\n"

    sure it is. As far as I know the Petrus label hasn\u2019t changed in decades."

  body: Wouldn't say no to a case of a different Pomerol (could be Pauillac as well),
    should the Petrus be not available ;-)
