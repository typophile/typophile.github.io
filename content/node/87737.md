  about reverse italic from history? or upright italic? Where can I find some left
  leaning text typeface? (I don't mean typefaces used for german cartographic maps)
  Thanks."

  body: "Note:\r\n\r\nThe German word \"linkskursiv\" (literally \"left italic\")
    was presumably used first in conjunction with the Bauer foundry typeface \"Venus
    linkskursiv\". In old German-English typeface catalogs, it was translated as \"Venus
    reclining\". For modern samples see www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/venus/venuslinkskursiv"
