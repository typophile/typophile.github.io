  Apologies for the small sample; it's the only one I could get:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/br_logo_186x94_4680.gif]\r\n\r\nSo,
  any ideas for the sans-serif there? My guess is the 'R' is a custom jobbie, but
  if anyone could suggest what font it may have started off as (if any), I'd greatly
  appreciate it."

    the C looks like it's a bit more open)

    a bit, and both the 'C' and the 'R' look custom, but it's definitely a good place
    to start. Thanks!

    looks like marriott hotels in general use that font on a lot of their marketing

  body: Also, I was able to approximate the 'R' using ITC Giovanni as a template.
    Maybe not perfect, but good enough.
