  here that someone'll know the answer...\r\n\r\nWe get a lot of ads in PDF format.
  They're supposed to be in greyscale as they're for b/w journals. From time to time
  they come in CMYK or with spot colours in \u2019em. I've got Acrobat Professional
  v7, which has a lot of colour management tools in it, only some of which I really
  understand. What I'd like to be able to do is just convert these files to greyscale;
  seems like it ought to be easy (like picking a different colour mode in Photoshop).
  Is it? If so, what do I do?"

    Colors and set Output intent to Grayscale at the dot gain desired.

  body: "Hmm, you can tell that I'm not an expert either here: OK, running Don's suggestion
    I get what <em>looks</em> suitably grey on-screen, but if I run the preflight
    profiles \"Document generates more than one plate\" or \"List non B/W objects\",
    I don't get the all-clear that I would expect. \r\n\r\nSurely if it had made the
    file <em>properly</em> greyscale then both these would report \"No problems found\"
    (as indeed they do with PDFs of actual article body text pages from our typesetters)?\r\n_______________________________________________\r\nEver

  body: "That confirms what I suspected for long about the Acrobat 7 conversion: it
    merely seems to fiddle with the profiles to <em>display</em> in grayscale, much
    the same as the B&W filter in the latest Photoshop -- this doesn't make an image
    grayscale either.\r\n\r\nThe latest version of Acrobat (8? 9? -- the one with
    CS4) does this the way you want it, actually converting all color objects to gray
    scale.\r\n\r\n[And I'd be happy to do that for you, but unfortunately, I don't
    have it at home.]"

  body: "Re-distil it? Yeah, that was one of the first things I tried. Initially just
    picking the \"black-and-white\" option from the \"Paper/Quality\" tab of the default
    print dialog box. It seemed to ignore that and output in colour anyway. \r\n\r\nAha!
    However, I have just now tried ALSO going into the \"Advanced\" section of the
    print dialog box and selecting \"Composite Gray\" from the colour drop-down (sorry
    for the mixture of my UK spelling and Adobe's US spelling) AND \"Convert all spots
    to process\" in the Ink Manager, and <em>then</em> it looks like the resulting
    file is what's intended.\r\n\r\nPhew! What a palaver!\r\n\r\n(In the case of this
    particular advert, all I've got left to do now is correct a spelling mistake left
    behind by the supplier \u2013 the name of a font, amusingly enough \u2013 and
    it'll be ready to go. Good job I'm well in advance of schedule with this one,
    LOL.)\r\n________________________________________________\r\nEver since I chose
