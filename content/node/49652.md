body: And one more time, help would be greatly appreciated.  In fact, if anyone lives
  in the nort central texas area, I'll buy you a drink for some help.  I have spent
  days trying to find this font.  I've found ones very close, but the "e" and the
  "r" are always off.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/logo_4337.JPG]

  body: It appears that that 'e' fell off the truck, got hit by a few cars, pushed
    to the shoulder where it then sat for a few weeks shriveling in the sun, before
    some kind soul finally picked it up and gave it a home in the middle of that logo.

  body: I would guess it is avant garde with a (poorly) modified e and r. Plus a [[http://typophile.com/node/12967?|squooshed]]
    n in <em>Weldon</em> and an attempt at a unicase T in <em>contractors.</em>

    are in order, but might have to come further down the line.\r\n\r\nTo Cumaso:
    thanks for the help.  So this is not a basic font?  It's a modified font?"

  body: "It is possible that there's a font that matches this, but I doubt it. \r\n\r\nMy
    guess is that it has been modified. It is common practice for designers to modify
    a few letters of a font when designing logos. When this is done well it makes
    the logo more distinctive, when it's done poorly it looks like garbage.\r\n\r\nIf
    you need to recreate this logo I would try converting Avant Garde to outlines
    in Illustrator then modifying the e, r, n, and T to match."
