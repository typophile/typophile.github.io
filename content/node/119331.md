  it's obviously been extended a little, and the capital U may have been manually
  altered to make both uprights thick."

  body: "Seeing as how Opti (Castcraft) made no original fonts at all, it would be
    nice to know what typeface Papong copied. Perhaps Eric Gill's <a href='http://old.myfonts.com/fonts/grouptype/aries/'
    target='_blank'>Aries</a>? It looks like stretching the roman - or, even better,
    small caps - font would get you very close.\r\n\r\nThanks, Mike Y, for your splendid

  body: "It's a customized version of an early digital typeface called OPTI Papong,
    distributed by the OPTI CastCraft Company (1990-1991). The top of the A was changed
    from flat to pointed, and the U (which looks like a lowercase u in the original)
    was altered to remove a right vertical stem (no thickening required).\r\n\r\nInformation

  body: "JanekZ, thanks for the actual ID.\r\n\r\nSo, Blaircam, if you want on out-of-the-box
    solution that is very close, go with Mike F's suggestion of Aries. If you need
    a spot-on match for all the details (finer serifs, etc.), I'd customize Perpetua,
    per JanekZ:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/mti/perpetua/"

  body: "OPTI did not create any new font designs, but in some cases they were the
    first to make digital versions of photo-lettering and metal fonts. As in this
    case the OPTI name usually was uninformative as to the name of the pre-digital
    font. In the predigital era Castcraft focused on copying existing fonts and releasing
    them under new names. \r\nAll OPTI  products are now font orphans and there could
    be legal issues if they are used in commercial projects.\r\nDon"

  body: Brilliant folks :) !  Perpetua is the one that was sticking in my memory.
    I like Aries, but as kthomps5 suggests, the serifs need to be a little more delicate.
    Many thanks.
