  colleague brought this postcard back from Berlin and asked what font. Embarrassingly,
  no-one in the studio could identify it off-hand."

  body: "It is a custom design based on Erbar.\r\n\r\nErbar was a face from Bauer
    by Jakob Erbar in the 1920s. Only a few display weights of that have been digitized
    and made commercially available, sadly.\r\n\r\nBut if you want to match the Berlin
    city street signs, you are in luck!\r\n\r\nVerena Gerlach and Ole Sch\xE4fer digitized
    this (and the East Berlin street signs) for the <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/fontfont/ff_city_street_type/\">FF
    City Street Type family</a>. To get this style, you should use FF Cst Berlin West
    Regular or Medium, I guess."

  body: "Actually, this is not a classic, because this looks like one of the new signs.\r\n\r\nThe
    original Berlin street signs were painstakingly digitized by type archaeologist
    [[Verena Gerlach]] and [[Ole Sch\xE4fer]] for [[FontFont]] as <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/fontfont/ff_city_street_type/\">FF
    City Street Type</a> in bothe East and West Berlin variants, before they started
    changing these wonderful signs into the somewhat less wonderful signs they have
    now.\r\n\r\nI think the modern signs might use FF Transit, the typeface [[Erik
    Spiekermann]] and MetaDesign specified for the Berlin subway system. Is is available
    in three versions, the first one being <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/fontfont/ff_transit_print_ot/\">FF
    Transit Print</a> for use in print. The two other versions are intended for wayfinding
    -- <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/fontfont/ff_transit_front_ot/\">FF
    Transit Front</a> for front lit signs, and <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/fontfont/ff_transit_back_ot/\">FF
    Transit Back</a> which compensates the weight change of the characters in backlit
    signs so the weights of both front lit type and back lit type appear identical."

    suffice.\r\n\r\nTo avoid any misunderstandings -- I am not correcting Dan in any
    way, it just took me longer to write my reply, which is why it ended up after
    Dan's. ;^)"

    the R and \xDF ligature."

  body: "So the modern signs use Transit, and the picture shows an older one in Cst
    Berlin West?\r\n\r\nAt least Dan is correct with FF Cst Berlin West -- check out
    the rounded lc. 'b' and the wonderful eszet (and tz!) ligatures. It has a marvellous
    'period' feel, although I'm not 100% sure <em>which</em> period :-)"
