  body: "Close, Ryuk, but I don't think so. I'm pretty sure it's not a custom font
    made specifically for this logo.\r\n\r\nThen again, I don't really need an exact
    match either, but something in the same ballpark would be nice. Changeling is
    not quite what I'm looking for. Thanks though."

  body: I think it was original this wide, as far I remember. Try search for Square
    fonts on Dafont or Myfonts.
