body: "Hi I am relatively new to design and am looking at setting up a layout. I can
  get my baselines to sit on a top and bottom margin by calculation and leading. But
  then When I go to create guides in indesign and set the number of rows (NOT columns)
  to 8 the and I need a gap of 12pt (4.223) between the fields. The baseline and the
  gaps between the fields do not line up.\r\n\r\nI am aware that you need to calculate
  this properly to get it right but is there a tried and tested way of calculating
  this to get it right.Cam anyone help?\r\n\r\nMany Thanks\r\n\r\nJames"

  body: "Not sure I follow. Are you setting up tables and then aligning them to the
    baseline grid? Or are you trying to set the baseline grid?\r\n\r\nIf it's to set
    the baseline grid, go to: Edit>Preferences>Grids. You'll have inputs for where
    you want to Start/Offset the baseline grid and if it's Relative to the Top of
    Page or the Top Margin, then you'll get to set the Incrementation (you can input
    12pts or whatever your leading is.) Honestly, I'm not sure what View Threshold
    is, but I have mine set for 100%. Turn Baseline Grids on View>Grids & Guides>Show
    Baseline Grid"

  body: "My math is a little backward, but anyway:\r\n\r\nYour number lines in a column,
    minus the number of horizontal lines between the rows, must be a number divisible
    by the number of rows. For example, if you have 51 lines and 4 rows, you\u2019ll
    need to subtract 3 extra rows to get 48 lines, which is divisible by 4. If you
    have 53 lines and subtract 3 extra rows you\u2019re left with 51 lines, which
    will not divide evenly, so you will need to either increase or decrease column
    height to make it work.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Systems-Graphic-Design-Josef-Muller-Brockmann/dp/3721201450/ref=pd_bbs_sr_2?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1204215667&sr=8-2\">Muller-Brockman
