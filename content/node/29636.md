body: Hey I need some really indepth info on the [[Bookman]] typeface. Anything really;
  It's origins, history, any posters it's been used on, any quirky facts etc. I've
  searched on the net but can't find anything other than the basics. Any books you
  recommend looking at as well? Thanks for any help.

    history of Bookman.\r\n\r\np.s. i put a wikilink to [[Bookman]] in your initial
    post and started a bit of an article there for you to reference.\r\n\r\np.p.s.
    another good reference is <em>[[The Encyclopaedia of Type Faces]]</em>"
