  Haas Grotesk</a>. More specifically, I'd like to find a <em>subtly</em> rounded
  variation of Helvetica that also has a webfont license.\r\n\r\n--\r\n\r\nAHG is
  a great looking font if you don't look at the actual curves, which look as if they
  were auto-vectorized from a scanned image. This unfortunately translates into outline
  artifacts when rasterized in the browsers, most notably the lowercase o -\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/ahg-o_4593.png]\r\n\r\nI
  was thinking of actually of opening up the TTF and fixing the outlines, but I can't
  seem to find any way to contact the author, who is listed as \"yann le coroller\".
  There's a <a href=\"http://www/kub.fr\">website</a> mentioned in the TTFs, but it
  is missing in action. Does anyone know this person? Or perhaps, Yann, are on this
  forum by any chance?"

    Emailed him, let's see how it goes."
