  spreads for two given articles. first article is on new ideas that came about in
  2005. the second article is about a father's loss of his son in the iraq war.\r\n\r\ndemographic:
  boston readers (age 20-30), low to mid income, college education.\r\n\r\nconcept:
  i want the magazine to have a fresh look and feel to it, plenty of friendly white
  space, and to look cutting edge and still appeal to a little older crowd.\r\n\r\ncrit
  me hard, i\u2019m a graphic design major!\r\n\r\nthanks\r\n-mike\r\n\r\nedit: i

  body: "You IM'ed me for a crit and here you have it. ;^)\r\n\r\nWell, first off,
    I feel there is a complete lack of dynamic in the composition, there is no energy
    coming off the pages. The type feels like it\u2019s floating in the middle of
    no where, too much white space.\r\n\r\nThe problem with this I see is that you
    don\u2019t really have a lot of copy. You should cut down to two spreads from
    three. This will challenge you design-wise as you\u2019ll find yourself trying
    to fit in all that copy without it turning ugly! To me, this is what editorial
    design is all about.\r\n\r\nOk, to pick a few issues I can see with the typography;\r\n\r\n-
    The use of type for the article headings is weak. For instance, in the second
    article you could make it \u201CTHE HOME FRONT\u201D in a large-ish setting and
    the rest of the heading subset in smaller type. You need to grab the readers'
    attention to the article.\r\n\r\n- There is inconsistent spacing between the sub-headings
    and the body text in the first article.\r\n\r\n- There are quite a few orphans
    in there; end lines consisting only a single word = ugly! Track or adjust H&J
    to get rid of them.\r\n\r\n- As it is, the images/graphics doesn\u2019t complement
    the type and vice versa. I think you need to work on the relationship between
    the type, white space and the images/graphics, get them to work off each other.
    \r\n\r\nGood luck. :^)\r\n"

  body: "Mike,\r\n\r\nI think you're off to a good start. With some refining these
    spreads could be very effective. Geoff's comments above are dead on. Here are
    some more design notes to chew on.\r\n\r\nWith editorial design it's so important
    to fully understand your audience and your content. Right now, I don't see how
    these layouts would appeal to a reader between the ages of 20-30. The type choices/treatments
    feel very conservative and a little dated, and the images don't seem to match
    the tone of the articles. Your content is very interesting and relevant, and deserves
    a visual treatment that embodies those characteristics.\r\n\r\nOverall, I'd say
    the spreads of the New Ideas story suffers from not enough fun with the type/design.
    This is a piece about innovation and challenging the status quo. You can explore
    that with your layout, which is currently extremely rigid and restrained.\r\n\r\nOn
    the Iraq story, there is no differentiation between your lead-in paragraph and
    your body copy. A variation in weight, size or color could help enliven the opening
    page of the article which needs to draw readers into it. Also on this page, the
    photo completely misrepresents the story. This is a modern conflict, and the focus
    is on the soldier's family who is stateside. Don't belie your title.\r\n\r\nThroughout
    all the spreads, there's a heavy use of white space, which doesn't deliver the
    push-and-pull I think you're trying to acheive, save for the 5th spread which
    I think works quite nicely (but watch the pargraph jumps, most readers will read
    down the page at the break, rather than to the right).\r\n\r\nFinally, the page
    folios are large and ubiquitous: a nice treatment, but is it that important that
    readers are constantly reminded of what page of the spring 2006 issue of Hub they
    are reading?\r\n\r\nHope that wasn't too painful. Good luck with your assignment!\r\n"

  body: "A few more typesetting items to consider,\r\nUse the fi and fl ligatures;\r\nSeparate
    the quotes from the soldier in his emails, possibly italicise them, maybe use
    an indent on both sides;\r\nCheck that times are all shown in the same way the
    use of a colon seems most reasonable.\r\nWhile checking for orphans watch out
    for single lines that go to the next column (I would aim for a minimum of three
    lines to either stay or go over for a paragraph that runs over two columns);\r\nConsistent
    use of either spacehyphenspace or em-dash, I understand the prevailing choice
    for USA is the em-dash;\r\nThere is a four dotted ellipsis sitting on the last
    spread that doesn't have the same indent as the paragraphs, in fact doesn't seem
    to contribute in any way, (I would use a three dotted one);\r\nThe Pleistocene
    story ends with a grey quad, but the others don't.\r\n\r\nI quite like the treatment
    for images on the earlier spreads and the way some blocks of type cut into the
    image area, however as has already been noted the white space is, at the moment,
    working against the designs.\r\nAmerigo wouldn't be my first choice for this kind
    of use, I think it tends to sparkle too much, you could consider using more than
    one text face maybe a sans and serif, especially for the Year in Ideas spreads,
    let one or two items take a lead position.\r\nYou asked for a hard crit, I hope
    these remarks and the ones already given are constructive as well.\r\nTim\r\n"

  body: I think it needs more images, and maybe closer attention to hierarchy, size
    varaition, break the grid a little bit. But the type looks clean, and the photoshop
    collages are pretty cool.

    face changes (recently going back to my original choice) I'm ready for another
    crit.\r\n\r\nCould you please crit the revision? It's really important to me that
    these look amazing.\r\n\r\nI'm interested in what you think of my layouts and
    composition balance. Do my layouts feel unorganized?\r\n\r\nhttp://mikeeatworld2.googlepages.com/web2.pdf\r\n\r\nthanks!\r\n\r\nps.
    For the Home Front article I'm using images of the family, however I'm fighting
    will low-res images and I don't think i'm going to be able to bleed the images
    off the page. Unfortunetly, I think images are going to have to be pretty small
    to look even halfway decent. Any advice?"
