body: "I was just wondering if you guys might be able to check out this pdf and tell
  me if you like the left or right logo the best. It is for a package design project
  in my Communication Design 1 class. I created a sparkling fruit drink called \"cure\"
  and came up with 4 flavors, and have to create the actual bottle and 4-pack carton.\r\n\r\nI
  thought i was finished with my logo, but i started messing around with it again
  today, and came up with a new version (the logo on the right). I am leaning towards
  the new one, just because it seems a bit more universal, but i wanted a second opinion
  from you guys. I think if i choose the one on the right, i will have the little
  pear at the bottom of the bottle, maybe with a little text saying \"pear\" to distinguish
  the flavor. Oh yeah, this is just the \"pear\" flavor.\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\nJosh\r\n\r\n\r\nhere
  is the pdf (its less than 1 mb)....\r\n\r\nhttp://www.yousendit.com/transfer.php?action=download&ufid=7E9AD6D2446ABFA2"

      burning fuse too.\r\n\r\nWhat do you think of the right logo though? Just okay?
      Or do you like it. The U is suppose to resemble a glass with the bubbles coming
      out of it, do you see that? I am going to use the little pear, without the bubbles,
      at the bottom of the bottle with text saying \"pear\" so people will know which
      flavor it is.\r\n\r\nthanks."

  body: "Hmm, overall I like it, but I am not sure if the very light 'cure' wordmark
    and Futura light are clearly indicating a sparkling drink (could be the wordmark
    of some high-end hairdresser's chemistry kit as well). \r\nI did not see the glass
    at the first glimpse, but now that you mention it it's clear. Have you tried altering
    the u shape at the bottom to form a more realistic 'drinking glass' (instead of
    a test tube ;-) impression?\r\nCan you post a little bit more of your bottle/label
    design so that we can get the overall impression? "

  body: "I think you have a few issues to fix with the look of the logo. I don't know
    if the \"sparkling fruit remedy\" should be kerned across the entire length of
    the word. It just seems too open. I'd almost like to see you still explore more
    with the U and the \"bubbles.\" I think there's a better solution out there for
    that. Perhaps try using the circles inside the U \u2013 containing the fizz as
    the bottle is not yet open when it's on the shelf. I would also think about the
    placement of the pear, as I find that is the strongest solution of the naming
    conventions displayed. Remember, at eye level you're reading \"cure\" at the top
    of the bottle, you want to quickly find the flavor and not search for it at the
    bottom. Perhaps it's right above or below the wordmark. I hope this helps \u2013\_best
    of luck. "

  body: "Thanks for the advice John. I am having trouble using the pear within the
    logo and keep it as a balanced logo. It just does not feel right wherever i place
    it. And another thing is, like you were talking about, you want to quickly find
    out the flavor, but some people might not realize that it is a silhouette of a
    pear, but i don't want to clutter up the bottle too much with a main type logo,
    then the pear, then text saying \"pear\".\r\n\r\nI had tried using the fizz inside
    the U instead of outside, but i also ran into some problems with that. Since the
    U is open at the top, the bubbles made it look like the U had chicken pocks or
    something.\r\n\r\nOne reason i disliked the original logo with the fruit to the
    left, was because it wrapped too much around the bottle for me, looking straight
    on at it, you lose either part of the fruit or the last letter or so. Making it
    smaller looks awkward, so i thought maybe vertical, which makes the type look
    good, but the fruit on it's side looks weird.\r\n\r\nI am getting frustrated with
    this, because i have worked on it for a while, and when i think i am done, i start
    to notice things i want to chance, but i am not sure how to change them for the
    better, guess that is part of design that i will learn to overcome.\r\n\r\n\r\nOh
    and John, do you have any suggestions for \u201Csparkling fruit remedy\u201D?
    I personally don't think the kerning is too loose, but someone else had mentioned
    that to me as well."

    closer to the product name. I also threw in a variation on the right just for

  body: "Trying out all these suggestions has been a great exercise in exploration
    and comparison, but to be honest, I'm not convinced it has necessarily improved
    upon your original preferred workmark.\r\n\r\nIn your first post, your gut was
    telling you that the option on the right was perhaps better than your first. I
    think your gut was right, as many here have said. However, I'm of the opinion
    that flattening the bottom of the \"U\" was unnecessary and has failed to make
    it a recognizable drinking glass. The (questionable) benefit of seeking out this
    resemblance is outweighed by how awkward this new \"U\" now looks beside the other
    letterforms. Looking at it, I was left wondering: Wouldn't a convincing test tube
    be better than an unconvincing drinking glass? Haven't we just inadvertantly turned
    it into a beaker? http://img.alibaba.com/photo/51184814/Beaker.jpg\r\n\r\nIn the
    end, we get a sort of drinking glass/test tube hybrid. A compromise.\r\nIn my
    mind, the test tube connotation was much bolder, more intriguing and conceptually
    richer.  Your original preferred design achieves everything the latest version
    does, and is, in my opinion, the simpler and more elegant of the two.\r\n\r\nAs
    for identifying the flavour, I think you're on the right track using a combination
    of colour and icon. Keep Brian's suggestion in mind, use text creatively and avoid
    being redundant."
