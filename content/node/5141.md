body: I&#39;m working on an assignment called Poem and I&#39;ve decided to use a quite
  beautiful extract about love from a Black Sabbath song. Thought it could be interesting
  to display text in quite girly pretty way in contrast to Black Sabbath, perhaps
  handwriting style. At the moment i have creative blockage...How can I develop my
  ideas from here...? Any ideas appreciated! Thanks

  body: can you use your own handwriting? my you could start sketching out ideas that
    way, based on how you feel about the lyrics, how you write when you feel that
    way. how you doodle if you doodle... i don&#39;t know. <BR> <BR>you can always
    post your sketches here for feedback. we love sketches.
