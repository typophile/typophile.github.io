body: "Hi there,\r\n\r\nSince cyrillic breve has a design usually different to latin
  breve accent I would like to know if you make the letter 'I-Breve' making a unique
  breve on top or if the proper way would be to generate a non spacing unicoded glyph
  and then to create a component on top of the 'I'.\r\n\r\nProblem is... I am not
  sure what is the unicode for 'combining cyrillic breve'. I only found \"A67C\" (combining
  cyrillic Kavyka) but I think it is not the same...\r\n\r\nOr shall I make a unique
  tweaked breve on top of the cyrillic 'I' (/afii10027)? What is the usual approach
  in cyrillic fonts?\r\n\r\nThanks in advance.\r\n\r\n "

    out of curiosity what does a cyrillic breve look like. How is it different from
    the other breve."

  body: "I'd create a nonspacing glyph and simply name it 'uni0306.cyr'. You can use
    it as a component when constructing cyrillic I-breve, and you could make it accessible
    via the glyphs palette by including 'sub uni0306 by uni0306.cyr' in your 'aalt'
    feature (or perhaps in your 'locl' feature).\r\n\r\nAndr\xE9"
