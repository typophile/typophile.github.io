  body: I saw that too and assumed it was custom, for the magazine. They do that often.

  body: Beautiful stuff, Chester. Here's hoping some of that custom work eventually

  body: I'm glad I saw this thread! I, too, saw the magazine on Sunday, but thought
    they were using <a href="http://www.tdc.org/news/2007Results/Manicotti.html">Manicotti</a>,
    another modern-looking slab. Nice going, Chester.
