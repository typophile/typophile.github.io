  blends into another letter in another language...\r\n\r\ni'm looking for a W that
  would look something like what i have highlighted on the left side, any help would

    successful drawing it on your own.  I always liked the shape of the /w/ in Appoline
    Italic but it is mirrored from the waved direction your looking for as most are

  body: I agree with inkxel. This sounds like the perfect opportunity to letterform.

    part of the W, where the two V shapes connect is kinda pointy, only if it was
    curved and smooth would be perfect."
