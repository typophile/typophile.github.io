body: I am working in a letterpress type shop over the summer. I have been tasked
  to find names for all the unknown type we have in our cabinets. This is one of them.
  Thank you in advance to whoever is able to help me. [img:sites/default/files/old-images/photo

    their 2013 catalog.\r\nIf this is an American type, then it might be in McGrew's
    book, _American Metal Typefaces of the 20th Century_. Perhaps in Dan X. Solo's
    catalog. Digital?\r\nDon\r\n"

  body: "Thanks Dick, you jogged my memory.\r\nThese are capital letters from _Cloister
    Cursive_ designed by Morris Fuller Benton and sold by American Type Founders Company
    [ATF]. Here is a sample from ATF's 1923 Specimen Book [img:sites/default/files/old-images/CloisterCursiveATF1923_4996.jpg]\r\nATF
    featured the font with a four page presentation [pages 68 to 71]. \r\nThere is
    a digital version by Jim Rimmer under the name LTC Cloister Cursive http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/lanston/ltc-cloister/cursive
    He also did additional bold and light weight digital versions.\r\nDon"
