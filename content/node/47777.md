  body: "1. Make a GPOS mark attachment lookup in which the alifcomb glyph is positioned
    using the attach1 anchor. Only include in this lookup any glyphs that you eventually
    want to be positioned with the attach3 anchor.\r\n\r\n2. Export this lookup to
    a .vtl text file.\r\n\r\n3. Open the .vtl file in a text editor. Search for\r\n\r\n
    attach1\"\r\n\r\nand replace with\r\n\r\n attach3\"\r\n\r\ni.e. rename the anchors
    without changing the attachment offsets. Save.\r\n\r\n4. Import the edited .vtl
    back into VOLT. If asked if you want to replace existing attach3 anchors, say
    YES.\r\n\r\nThis will create attach3 anchors with the same positions as attach1
    anchors, and these can now be edited for specific base glyphs. Note that anchors
    are stored internally in VOLT, so if you have existing lookups that reference
    both attach1 and attach3 the latter will inherit your new positioning. In this
    case, you can delete the working lookups used to export and import .vtl files."
