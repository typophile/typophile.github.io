body: "Hello all,\r\n\r\nI had to upgrade (re-purchase) my version of Meta because
  I was building \r\na template for a client and I wanted us both to be working with
  the same\r\nversion of Meta. I'm on a Mac, they're on PC.\r\n\r\nAnyway, I bought
  the regular Mac postcript version and told them to do \r\nthe same. But they bought
  Open Type. When I got to their office and opened \r\nthe file, the naming conventions
  for the the 2 versions of Meta were going to \r\nall have to be changed in my style
  sheets.\r\n\r\nSo _I_ upgraded to Open Type and redid all my style sheets. Then
  sent them \r\nthe new file and still the same problem. \r\n\r\nNow they say they
  may not have purchased Open Type. But that would mean \r\none of the templates had
  to have worked. \r\n\r\nBy the way, I had them do a screenshot and oddly, the OT
  logo is next to the \r\nfont names. But FontFont said that sometimes PCs perceive
  a font as OT when \r\nreally it isn't.\r\n\r\nI'm awaiting feedback from FontFont.
  In the meantime, does anyone know if \r\nthere is usually this font name problem?
  FontFont insisted that if we bought \r\nthe same version, even cross platform, the
  names used for each style would \r\nbe identical.\r\n\r\nI just want to know if
  it's typical to have to change the style sheets to reflect\r\nthe names used on
  the other system.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nJane"

    TrueType fonts (techncially OpenType regardless of extra featres) get the 'O'
    icon. \r\n\r\nCheers, Si"

  body: "which still leaves th mystery of why neither version names the font names
    the same.\r\n\r\nIf someone just said I'd run into that no matter what, I would
    just have to fix the styles\r\non their end but FontFont insists that the name
    conventions are all the same. \r\n\r\nNot so!"
