body: "I am seeking inspiration to design a new brand and food label for a range of
  bacon and ham joints, which will be sold in multiple retail, the brand positioning
  is trustworthy, honest, affordable taste appeal for all. Its not bargain basement
  cheap, nor is it premium gourmet, but very much in the middle, for family, mainstream,
  traditionalist appeal.\r\n\r\nBecause of legislative requirements that must go on
  the front of the adhesive label, the actual area I have to work with to include
  the brand/logo plus the name of the product is about 2cm high by 8cm long. The range
  will consits of 5 products, so will probably have to come up with 5 colour backgrounds
  into which the brand fits. \r\n\r\nAnyway thats probably too much detail for where
  I am now, its really just inspiration I need at the moment.\r\n\r\nAny help appreciated!!"
