body: "I've been trying to identify the foundry this came from for over a year, to
  no avail. I originally found it in one of Solo's catalogs under the name Romany.
  The same catalog also shows it in condensed form as Jugenstil. I have a photo, probably
  from eBay, of about a half-dozen letters of the same font, but it isn't named. At
  the least the photo does prove it was of metal origin but all the source material
  I can access doesn't show it.\r\n\r\nI'm guessing it to be circa 1920-30 or so,
  although given what Solo collected it could be much older. Anyone's help would be
  appreciated.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Romany_font_5709.jpg]"

    Nouveau Display Alphabets book by Dan Solo, published by Dover. They never tell
    you the foundry. I think this is earlier than you suspect, and is probably 19th
    century if Solo groups it in Art Nouveau.\r\n\r\nIt is not in the Dover book  \"Treasury
    of Authentic Art Nouveau Alphabets\" by Petzendorfer, which would have named the
    foundry.\r\n\r\nIf you need a scan of the alphabet, I can make one for you.\r\n\r\n-

  body: "Dan X. Solo's fonts in his big catalog are indexed by the \"Solopedia\" http://abfonts.freehostia.com/solopedia/
    which includes any known alternate names for the ones that he used. the fonts
    _Romany_ or _Jugenstil_ are included, but there is no information as to original
    names or digital versions.\r\nBased on style features, such as the tilde shaped
    center bar on E and the lazy a, I date them to the decade before the Great War
    of 1914-1918.\r\nDon\r\n"

    I would love to see a good quality scan of the _Romany_ or _Jugenstil_  alphabet.\r\nDon"

  body: "@Mike, thanks for the offer of the scan, but I have the complete alphabet.
    I discovered the font was also released by an unknown 2\" film-font company pre-1990,
    so I have it from a local company's old specimen book.\r\n\r\nI think, but cannot
    be certain, that I have seen the font in another of the old film-font books. What
    I was most surprised to discover is that Photo-Lettering Inc. did not show it
    in their vast collection from the 70s. It is a nice display face.\r\n\r\nSomeday
    I hope its history will turn up."
