  and excellent! I'd a young designer and am having trouble identifying the type used.
  I think is Rama Gothic, but I can't be sure... Any help would be appreciated, and
  any advice on how to better learn to identify fonts would also be helpful :)"

    by Hoefler and Co. (Knockout N0. 46 Flyweight), and it seems to be a great match\u2014save
    for the ampersand:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.typography.com/fonts/knockout/overview/\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Knockout_4579.png]\r\n\r\nThe
    ampersand appears to match the one in Titling Gothic (Skyline Standard), by Font

    single font that comes close with no substitutions is Reforma Grotesk (would require
