  this image is of some hand rendered wooden letterpress blocks (it's by alan kitching).
  i'd really like to find a typeface that creates a similar effect and has the same
  kind of letter shapes (they vary a bit here, but you get the idea - sans serif and
  well balanced, quite blocky). can anyone suggest?"

    Myriad Pro. \r\nBut I think it comes down to the execution. How you put everything
    together. Font is relevant, but not as much here. I guess.\r\n\r\n"

  body: i guess it's not so much about identifying the font here, as about knowing
    of a typeface which is electronically available and uses the cracked, decayed
    wooden letterpress effect.

    you might have to do yourself in \u2013 for example \u2013 Photoshop.\r\nBrings
    a personal touch.\r\n\r\nIn case of ready fonts: Try Dafont.com for fonts. Perhaps
    you will find something over there.\r\nBut in you example there are different
    colors used in one letter.\r\nThat is not possible with a font. You have to tweak
    it.\r\n\r\nI would go for a normal letter and alter it yourself.\r\n\r\nGood luck.\r\n\r\n"

    typeset what you want in Illustrator or InDesign and then take it into Photoshop
    and grunge it up. I use the Machine Wash filter set put out by Mister Retro. Not
    sure where you could get them to try them out but they do a beautiful job.\r\n\r\nHope
    this helps.\r\n\r\nBest,\r\nMatthew"

  body: I agree that digital fonts are too crisp to do this effect convincingly; however,
    if you must use a computer-generated font to do this, rather than printing your
    own hand-cut blocks, <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/fontfont/ff_kipp_ot/">FF
    Kipp</a> by Claudia Kipp was one of the pioneering examples of getting computers
    to simulate the distressed surfaces of letterpress.

    FF Kipp) in Photoshop to soften the edges.
