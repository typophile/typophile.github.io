body: "Hello all, \r\nI'm looking for a typeface that will rev off of names on the
  back of Sports/Basketball Jerseys. I'm looking for a bold, condensed version that
  is sans serif and preferably geometric in nature. I like the look of H&FJ's Champion
  and Knockout condensed versions, but they are a bit too rounded for what I'm looking
  for. If someone could suggest a similar quality typeface it would be appreciated.
  Thanks!\r\n\r\n"

    tailored to what you''re looking for. Be sure to scroll down as there are many
    weights and widths. '
