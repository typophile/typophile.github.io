body: "Hi All,\r\n\r\nI understand Extensis has recently released something called
  \"universal type server\". Has anyone been using this? We have about 12 machines
  in our office that are running Fusion. Fusion, in and of itself works fine, however,
  not following \"best practices\" seem to be what pull users into a pit of font problems
  (that and Microsoft Office). \r\n\r\nThere is some good info on organizing and managing
  fonts in the literature Extensis provides, but I was wondering if any of you have
  any sage advice for managing office fonts, client fonts, deploying newly purchased
  fonts, etc. Is Universal Type Server the answer?\r\n\r\nThanks in advance.\r\n\r\nchris"

  body: "I finally gave up on Suitcase completely. It WAS the best/only thing out
    there (pre-OSX), but corporate changes and OS changes have taken their toll. Reasons:\r\n\r\n1)
    Major releases/versions are buggy as hell;\r\n\r\n2) LOTs of updates to fix (1)
    \r\n\r\n3) Updates are a PAIN to get at (I feel like I have to give blood to get
    to their download area)\r\n\r\n4) For all their hype, the \"features\" they keep
    adding do nothing but distract\r\n\r\n5) NOT cheap (I'm tired of the \"We're gonna
    upgrade the version to infuse some cash\" philosophy)\r\n\r\nExtensis is a perfect
    example of a company that's goal seems to be to make things more difficult and
    obtuse voer time so you have no alternative but to submit to their superior corporate
    will. Portfolio is another example -- the ONE THING it should do well (let you
    quickly look up archived files by keyword) it does HORRIBLY, while Extensis spends
    time adding new Views to the windows or new icons. Argh.\r\n\r\nYou may want to
    wait and see what Apple is up to with Snow Leopard (OS 10.6)... It's very server-oriented,
    and one of the changes may be font management. Otherwise, I'd recommend FontAgentPro."
