  body: And a nasty squooshed<sup>TM</sup> version of Brush Script it is.  <BR> <BR>I
    don&#39;t know the <u>IS</u> but it could easy be <BR>handlettered and therefore
    not necessarily <BR>based on an existing typeface.

    Improv</a>, but it isn&#39;t.

    ALT=":-&#41;" BORDER=0> <BR> <BR>It&#39;s <a href="http://www.dafont.com/en/search.php?texte=this+IS+is+my+costume&amp;nq=1&amp;q=comics">Comics</a>,
    with a squished capital I and a regular S.  The dot must have been added manually
    - I mean the whole site is done in Flash, after all, wouldn&#39;t be too hard.
    <BR> <BR>If you need any more font IDs from Homestar Runner, I pretty much have
    them all - they use a lot of Cooper Black, Pixie, Potzrebie, Wet Paint, Stencil,
    House Slant... the list goes on forever, and I can&#39;t list or link them all.  Hope
    that helped.
