    an ID. Lemme check.

  body: That was me that posted it.  I couldn&#39;t scan the ad that I originally
    saw it in, so I tried to unsuccessfully recreate it.  I saw this magazine with
    the same typeface and posted it instead.

    luck or a chance meeting  <BR>to get this identified. :/

  body: ahhh....I shall keep hoping then.  No biggie if I don&#39;t find it.  Do you
    ever have the urge...no more like the need, to identify a font you&#39;ve never
    seen before?  That&#39;s merely the case with this one.  But the more I see it,
    the more I am compelled to find it&#39;s origin.  Perhaps someday I shall find
    the answer. &#42;

    you&#39;re seeing this in several places in the exact same form, then I would
    guess that the different magazines are all part of the same publishing conglomerate

  body: I checked all the usual scrapbooking websites with no luck.  The ad in the
    MyFonts query is from Hero Arts a rubber stamping company.  Interestingly, they
    sell a set of rubber stamps based on this font.  I originally thought this was
    a in house job, but then I spotted it on the cover of the magazine. <BR> <BR><img

  body: I happen to know for an incontrovertible fact that the typeface in question
    was designed from scratch by Claude Garamond&#39;s little-known baseline-challenged
    twin, Clod Garamond. No one talks about him much, and it&#39;s probably better
    left that way.
