body: "Hi I'm looking for some suggestions on what font types pair well together for
  a luxury real estate company.\r\n\r\nThe client has requested a script font to be
  used in conjunction with another type in background of headlines in ads. We've somewhat
  narrowed it down to Montague, with optima and chronicle. It seems to work aesthetically
  but want to know from the type board if there are other options that would work
  better for our needs.\r\n\r\nThe company is targeting $1+M homes in North Scottsdale
  and Paradise Valley. Demographics are mostly couples ages 40-60, average income
  $175K annual and are interested in Arizona for the cultural offerings, weather and
  current real estate market here.\r\n\r\nClients do a majority of advertising in
  luxury magazines, home magazines, billboards and website.\r\n\r\nAny suggestions
  on what fonts would pair well for their needs would be greatly appreciated.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\n\r\nChris"

  body: "Chronicle is, as the name suggests, primarily a newspaper type.\r\n\r\nFor
    luxury, you need a face that isn\u2019t quite such an economical workhorse, one
    that wastes space with profligacy, i.e. a book face with a very small x-height,
    which you should then set with plenty of leading, at a suitably large size for
    the failing eyes of your demographic.\r\n\r\nWhat do you think of Brandon and
    Seria Sans? They are both a bit retro/quaint, and modern (if not modernist) by
    virtue of being sans."

  body: "Thanks Nick, I do like the brandon type. The client has suggested something
    similar to this look (see http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5050/5300664287_3a65e1b2b3.jpg)
    which is why I went with Chronicle. Do you think Brandon would work better for
    copy or mainly used in headlines or both? I appreciate any feedback.\r\n\r\nThanks
    much"

  body: "That's a \u201Cfashion\u201D look, combining Bodoni with a light weight of
    Helvetica for body text.\r\nThe idea is that the linearity of the Bodoni hairlines
    relates to the linearity of the body text.\r\nYou might use the Light weight of
    Brandon at a comfortable size, and with plenty of leading, to create a spacious
    upscale tone.\r\nMontague has a contemporary quality, in a traditional style,
    so would work well with Brandon or Seria Sans, which are likewise."
