  Discovers Type! is the story of a video game space mouse who helps an elementary
  school student Jake discover the invention of printing and its evolution through
  the ages so Jake can write a report. Squeaks is a collaboration between two U.S.
  Government Printing Office employees, Jim Cameron (Publication and Information Sales)
  and Nick Crawford (Creative Services). The story is perfect for introducing kids
  to the history of print. Illustrated in color, the art is outstanding and rivals
  anything you'll find in a comic book store. </cite>\r\n\r\nYour U.S. tax dollars
  at work. Was this part of Obama's stimulus plan? I will assume yes.\r\n\r\nhttp://bookstore.gpo.gov/collections/squeaks-discovers-type.jsp\r\n\r\n"

  body: The character kind of reeks of desperation. Type is actually fairly interesting
    to kids and doesn't need the formula of "Quick, what do kids like? Um, hey, kids,
    learning about this subject is <em>cool and rad</em> just like those damn video
    games you play." Make no mistake, I'm soundly in the camp of cartoon animals,
    but, y'know, make the hook plausibly relevant and don't look like you're trying
    so hard?
