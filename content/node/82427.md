  I need but am struggling with the following font?\r\n\r\nhttp://www.gallopers.co.uk/summer/HoofItLogosmaller.jpg\r\n\r\nThe
  Majority of letters appear to be \"Present Bold\", but the H and the T are different
  and quite frankly beyond me, if any experts out there could give me any guidance
  it would be much appreciated.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance\r\n\r\nCraig\r\n\r\n"

  body: The H and t are essentially mirrors of each other; chances are quite good
    that they're custom (rearranged elements of the H in Present Bold)...

  body: I don't think this is Present Bold or any other weights of [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/adobe/present/|Present]].
    It has more of a '50s cocktail lounge look and the o's are open at the top. However
    the f and i do look pretty-much identical to Present, and the more I look at it
    I feel the o's could be from a different font to them. There's possibly three
    fonts here, and maybe some custom work to H and T as Nick suggested.
