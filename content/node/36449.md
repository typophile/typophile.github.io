  body: "Initial reaction is they look good, points I would look at are the vertical
    stroke of the R I feel it should flare to the left rather than right and possibly
    work in a closed loop where the counter and leg meet; work on the second o \u2013
    it is slightly cramped; slightly close up the fto combination; try a thinner connecting
    stroke on op or maybe a more exuberant stroke \u2013 it is rather straight compared
    with some of the others; and possibly make the counter of the p a little wider.\r\n\r\nTim"

  body: "I think it's really nice. I agree with Tim to spend some time on the second
    o. In addition I think the space between t and o is much to wide.\r\n\r\nBest,\r\nJuergen"

  body: "my take:\r\ni like the R in version 3 better than versions 1 or 2. i don't
    think its flare is a problem - rather it feels in keeping with the movement of
    the rest of the type. again, second 'o' needs tweaking, as others said."

  body: I vote number two but i would move the "top" slightly the to the left and
    fix the P at the end as it's starting to look a little too much like an R to me.
    Really just my taste I suppose. Other than that I think it looks really great.
