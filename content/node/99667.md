  was to make a digital revival of them, but they're being slowly identified and it
  seems there is no original typeface among them. Still this one still got no ID.
  Any help?\r\n\r\nthanks\r\na."

  body: "This is at least the second time this particular typeface has shown up. It
    could be classified as late Jugendstil or Secession (first two decades of the
    twentieth century). It share many characteristics with Miller and Richard\u2019s
    Bohemian\u2026\r\n\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/nicksfonts/millrich-moravian-nf/\r\n\r\nbut
    it\u2019s obviously not the same typeface. IIRC, one of the other samples came
    from an Italian foundry, which is not an area I know a great deal about\u2026yet\u2026"

    glyph to show the letter details.  \r\nArranging the letters in more orderly fashion
    would help. \r\nPossibly image them via a mirror would assist I'm sure."
