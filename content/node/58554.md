  of a hinting service that can do this for me. I have found a few companies that
  offer TT hinting, but I have no idea what the normal fee for such a job is. So that's
  why I'd like to know which companies do you recommend and what do they normaly charge
  for let's say: a sans serif typeface that need TT hints from 9-24 points?\r\n\r\nI
  also like to know if they want the right to sell your font as it was their own after
  they did the hinting for me, cause I want to keep the right to whom I sell the font
  to.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance!"

  body: "I expect price also depends partly on what level of hinting you want, and
    whether for ClearType, GDI greyscale, or both. Character set (number of glyphs)
    is also a factor.\r\n\r\nIt sounds like you're talking about delta hints specifically
    when you mention 9-24 points. BTW, \"points\" are not the relevant unit as they
    are relative: pixels per em is the unit in question. 9 pt on Windows = 12 pt on
    Mac = 12 ppem.\r\n\r\nPaying somebody to do hinting for you is quite separate
    from them getting rights to sell your font(s). However, you might get a discount
    or even free hinting in exchange for non-exclusive resale rights or something....\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\nT"

  body: "I could have better said TT hinting plus 12-32 PPM delta hints, I just want
    to make an example, not go into to much details.\r\nLet's just say I want TT hints
    for 256 glyps without anything fancy.\r\nYou could also make your own example,
    I just want to know how high these job fees can be and which companies offer good
    deals."

  body: A quote i received  18 months ago for delta hinting an original typeface design
    which included Latin (western and Central Europe, no vietnamese), Cyrillic and
    Greek, so the type would function well in small sizes on screen was in the $6000-$8000
    range. You've got to figure $100-$250 per hour for this sort of font engineering.
    Hobbyists beware!

  body: "That must have been allot of glyphs ;)\r\nSo Terminaldesign does TT hinting
    and delta hinting? How much would you estimate TT hint (plus delta hinting) a
    simple geometric sans serif typeface with 256 glyphs? Just a range, it don't have
    to be precise."

    the work involved. I'm in the middle of hinting a Latin 1 + 2 sans with a single
    pixel weight up to 40ppm and it is painfully slow!\r\n\r\nMalcolm"

  body: "I do not generally do this work, the quote I received was from one of my
    colleagues. You can inquire at Monotype, and Ascender, they are two developers
    who do this sort of thing. There are many independent designers who do this as
    well, but I don't think many take on much outside work due to the fact that few
    want to pay for the service. The free Microsoft web fonts did a great deal of
    harm when it comes to pricing this sort of work.\r\n\r\nTo put it another way;
    TT hinting makes type design appear to be the most non-tedious work on the planet!"

    work and have some ex-Microsoft engineers.

    plenty of people out there who can do it better and faster than me, that's why
    I want to outsource it, so I will have time to do what I like most: designing!
    ;)\r\nBut considering the costs, this is not something I can do for every typeface.\r\nMonotype
    and Ascender must do a good job I guess. Dalton Maag looks interesting too. \r\nIf
    anyone else knows of companies who offer this service please post!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: " \r\nFontWerk is experienced in TT hinting for more than 8 years.\r\n \r\nI
    recommend to look not only on the price for TT hinting.\r\n \r\n(1) Look as well
    at the data formats you get after TT hinting.\r\nAll the hinting stuff made by
    FontWerk is based on FontLab. You get not only a hinted ttf file, but also the
    FontLab-internal vfb-file for further work (additional characters in the future).\r\n
    \r\n(2) Look as well at the hinting level you really need.\r\nGood hinting options
    in the font file may produce sufficient screen quality by autohinting a Sans Serif
    typeface.\r\nA good screen quality you may get with a manually basic TT hinting
    with no deltas. So the price for basic hinting does not depend on the point sizes
    but on the number of glyphs in the font.\r\nOnly if you need excellent screen
    quality delta hints are necessary. Delta hinting takes a lot of time because it
    is manually work on each glyph in each point size.\r\nSo, depending on the quality
    level it takes me between 2 hours and 2 weeks working time to optimize screen
    quality for TTFs with full Latin character set.\r\n(3) Look at price-performance
    ratio.\r\n \r\nIf you send sample font to Monibart@fontwerk.de you will get a
    detailed TT hinting offer asap. Please be sure, that after finishing the hinting
    job all your font related data will be deleted from all FontWerk disks.\r\n \r\nRegards,\r\n\r\nDH"

    if we agree that they may sell the font against royalties.\r\nDH, do you work
    at or own Fontwerk? I looked at the site http://www.fontwerk.de but I get allot
    of \"content/image not available\"(red x) on the site. Will the site be available
    in english?\r\n\r\nI will consider Fontwerk for TT hinting, Thanks DH."
