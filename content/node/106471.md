  and have a logo but am having trouble coming-up with a good body text typeface (s)
  for an invite to a reception for the event. I think it should be inviting and elegant
  but not too serious (even with a touch of whimsy) since it's a very playful exhibition.
  \r\n\r\nI've attached the logo if that helps. Thanks!\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/lob_logo_only_you_sexy_5659.jpg]"
