body: "Hi,\r\n\r\na client asked me to re-design their logo. The company is an \"Independent
  Marine and Cargo Surveyor Company\" based in Germany and I am going to create a
  new logo and website for them. For the website, I will probably go for a blueish
  colour scheme, with images of cargo ships and containers. What I still haven't found
  though is a font for the new logo. It should have a somewhat maritime or wavy feel
  to it, maybe a bit like the British Airways typeface, but more focussed on shipping
  and everything that's involved with it. Can anybody give hints as to what typeface
  I should use? Thanks for any input..."

    you're a little harsh on the existing logo, it's not really so bad! The slab serif

    funny. Actually, I made the text and also chose the font (\"Union\"). With \"their

    current logo is in blue though, without any orange. You can see it [[http://www.captainfoerster.de|here]].

    Since the compass is your focus, it may be better to have a nice unfussy sans
    serif. Perhaps the third colour (the brown) and the staggered layout could be
    reconsidered.    \r\n\r\n\"I wonder if the font could be more \u201Cwavy\u201D

    literal. Unless you want to make that your concept and not have the compass at
    all.\r\n\r\n\" Do you think it will still be visible when scaled down to smaller
    sizes\"\r\nShouldn't be a problem. You might need to tweak the forms a bit, but
    very do-able. \r\n\r\n\r\n    "

  body: "Much better! I feel one shouldn't innovate for it's own sake. Frutiger is
    a classic, and like all classics it still remains quite robust.\r\n\r\nA couple
    of observations:\r\n\r\n1. A dark, warm-grey may be an improvement over black.
    \r\n\r\n2. You'll have to evolve some sort of relation between the logo and the
    descriptor (Independent Marine...). Right now it's somewhat hanging in the air.
    There's also too much contrast in scale between their sizes. In a business card,
    for instance, the descriptor may go too small. \r\n\r\n3. The kerning looks a
    little awkward in a few places. You may want to work on the first A (CAP) and
    the R which comes right after the O (compass).\r\n"

    compass reads N/NE (North/North East) and any sailor will read that instantly.
    Maybe you have an opportunity to make a nice connection between the logo and the
    company right there?"

  body: "Hi,\r\n\r\nI changed my mind about the whole thing. The shipping industry
    is a fairly conservative line of business and the \"\xF6\" should be clearly  visible.
    Right now it isn't. People may read \"o\" instead of \"\xF6\" or may not read
    anything at all. Also, the font Frutiger is too square in this case, a more wavy
    font should be used IMHO. What do you think? The shape on the left still lacks
    character though...\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/logo_compass4_3520.png]\r\n\r\n[[http://www.designbits.de|Web
