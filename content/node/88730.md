  has a Windows Mobile Poc\u0915etPC operating system.  \r\n\r\nThen when I used a
  particular letter from one particular font, letter R upper case in regular - the
  angled line (slightly curved)  on letter also outputs with an odd silhouette v tooth
  shape attached to it rather than only single angled line (slightly curved)?  This
  only happens on this mobile unit word application, not on the excel application
  nor the des\u0915top computer that has Fedora Linux and Windows XP operating systems.
  \ I tested other fonts on the mobile unit: another installed font and some other
  default ones, the letter R upper case is fine there.\r\n\r\n    "
