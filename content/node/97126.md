    or... this handwritting? Because it is handwritten...\r\n\r\nEDIT: Agree Jan.
    Also sorry to post useless question (mods, if any, feel free to delete this post)
    as, you're perfectly right, this was obvious it has been done by hand... But we
    never know as many requests here are done by people who want to find the font
    behind every lettering. Damned electronic ages!\r\nFor the record, I had also
    Monotype Script in mind..."
