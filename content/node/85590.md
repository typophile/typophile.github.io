  into fonts that look pleasant but also easy on the eye, like a newspaper fonts.
  \r\n\r\nSo far I like Garamond, Georgia, Didot, and STkaiti. Also Times to a degree,
  and Bondoni Antiqua is pleasing in my opinion. I still haven't found one where the
  cirmcumflex o (\xD4\xF4) looks nice. I need a font that is readable in italics,
  and regular, but is a bit like the a forementioned and can do Macrons, Breves, Carons,
  Circumflexes, and umlauts. also a nice \xF0, and \xDF.\r\n\r\nAny suggestions? I
  don't mind priced ones as long as it encodes onto PDF's properly, and the price
  is reasonable(less than $50). "

    probably hundreds or thousands of typefaces, that might match your query. So any
    additional input you can give would be nice."

    version of Garamond do you like? The pre-installed one in the Microsoft Office
    Package, which is just called \"Garamond\", or a Garamond that came with an Adobe
    application, like \"Adobe Garamond\" or even \"Garamond Premiere Pro\", or another
    differently called Garamond?\r\n\r\nIf you have only the one from the MS Office
    installation, then you can buy a different one. The Office Garamond is actually
    a from a different designer, not Garamond himself, and it is as well too light
    to use it for text. So buy yourself a decent version. The ones named from Adobe
    are very good choices. Alternatives are Sabon, Augereau, GaramondFB by FontBureau,
    Granjon, and many others.\r\n\r\nOr get a free (and still incomplete, and maybe
    not as neat) one. URW \"Garamond No8\", based on Stempel Garamond can be found
    in the URW font package here: http://www.artifex.com/downloads/ or the ambitious
    \"EB Garamond\" in [[https://github.com/georgd/EB-Garamond/tree/master/otf|Regular]],
    [[https://github.com/georgd/EB-Granjon/tree/master/OTF|Italic and Bold]]. \r\n"

    offered is that, for a typophile, typefaces like Didot and Bodoni Antiqua are
    on the opposite side of the spectrum from Garamond or Georgia.\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s
    like going on a wine forum and saying, \u201CI\u2019m looking for recommendations
    for a good Burgundy. I like Chardonnay and Riesling. What can you suggest?\u201D\r\n\r\nThat\u2019s
    why folks are probing for more information."

    OpenOffice Garamond is one I am most familar with.\r\n\r\nI only just got interested
    because I read paper form media, The Australian, Australian Financial Review,
    The Economist, and Worche all have different fonts, and I read the industry standard
    is a Times form. AFR seems to use a Times. \r\n\r\nSo this perked my intrigue. "
