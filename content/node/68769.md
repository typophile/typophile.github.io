body: "Hi,\r\n\r\nI am nearing the end of a project I'm doing using Opentype features
  in an experimental way. I call it experimental because my usage isn't particularly
  informed and there's probably a much easier way to be doing this. That's where I'd
  like your help.\r\n\r\nI have set myself up to translate (I use translate very loosely)
  \"txtspeak\" into normal english (hereby called 'txt' and 'text'). I have beginners
  knowledge of coding Opentype features and my idiocy will probably make a lot the
  experts squeal, but I don't mind that. Current ignorance has proven to be experimental
  bliss, but I'm more than willing to dive into deeper grounds to rectify problems
  I think I will ultimately come across.\r\n\r\nSo far I've used \"calt\" to swap
  words from the 'txt' spelling into 'text' spelling i.e. \"txt\" into \"text\", \"shizz\"
  into \"stuff\" and so on. I've also used \"dlig\" to swap profanities into asterisked
  words (I won't be as rude to give an example of that). \r\n\r\nHere's where you
  cringe: I've told the \"calt\" feature to \r\n\r\n<em>sub d d n t space by d_i_d_n_singlequote_t_space
  ;</em>\r\n\r\nFor the \"ddnt\"\xBB\"didn't\" this has worked great as it has with
  \"shiz\"\xBB\"stuff\" and a few others. I came across a problem when I tried \"iz\"\xBB\"is\"
  because the spaces either side of \"iz\" when typing were, or rather could be, eaten
  up by translating a word before it. So, the code became\r\n\r\n<em>sub space i z
  space by space_i_s_space ;\t\r\n\t\tsub i z question by i_s_question ;\r\n\t\tsub
  i z exclam by i_s_exclam ;\r\n\t\tsub i z period by i_s_period ;\r\n\t\tsub i z
  comma by i_s_comma ;\r\nsub i z space by i_s_space ;"

  body: "Cont...(pt.2)\r\n\r\nHere you can see I accomodated the space after \"iz\"
    to be grammatical points also for if the word is used at the end of a sentence.
    To accomodate the word existing in the middle of a sentence, with the possibility
    of a space-eating word existing just before that, I made the last line of code
    above. This caused problems with words such as \"quiz\" and \"whiz\". I rectified
    this by writing in the code:\r\n\r\n<em>sub i z space by i_s_space ;\r\n\t\tsub
    b i z space by b_i_z_space ;\r\n\t\t\tsub b i z question by u_i_z_question ;\r\n\t\t\tsub
    b i z exclam by u_i_z_exclam ;\r\n\t\t\tsub b i z period by u_i_z_period ;\r\n\t\t\tsub
    b i z comma by u_i_z_comma ;\t"

  body: "Cont...(pt.3)\r\n\r\nI did this with all possible preceeding characters (in
    this case b, f, w, p, u, r and t). I got this info (ashamedly off a <a href=\"http://www.morewords.com/most-common-ends-with/iz/\">website</a>)
    to lessen my already rapidly growing glyph library by only including active/popular
    preceeding characters to \"iz\". This also worked fine until \"y\"\xBB\"why\"
    when after coding twenty-four possible preceeding letters and their possible grammatical
    endings, the sentence \"iz y, yet\" turned into \"is why, whyet\". I countered
    this by including:\r\n\r\n<em>sub space y e by space_y_e ;\r\nsub y e by y_e ;"

  body: "Cont...(pt.4)\r\n\r\nThis solved the problem sentence given yet  I can't
    help feel it's going to have repercussions later on in the project. Words before
    worked fine and after-words such as \"yet\" and \"youth\" both work when the word
    eats space to the right in translation and doesn't eat space to the right.\r\n\r\nI
    haven't use classes because the class style I used (@lc) didn't replace the lowercase
    character. I also don't know of any 'if'-like parameters used in flash. I do however,
    realise that flash may be a much easier way to do it (with learning), like Amy
    Papaelias used in her 2005 <a href=\"http://www.typetalkfonts.com/typetalk_demo.html\">TypeTalk</a>
    project but I feel this is a pseudo-solution in that it doesn't use Opentype features
    to do the translation. I'm sticking to my guns (I can justify later if interested)
    by using Opentype but the deadline is looming and I fear it may fall flat on it's
    face at a future point.\r\n\r\nHere is where I'd like to ask for help, advice,
    questions of \"why are you even doing this?\" and vexed virtual slaps for the
    insane mis-use of Opentype. I will also happily send my Fontlab files to those
    wishing to poke around at the code.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance and apologies for
    the \"post-and-comment\" structure of this post,\r\nLewis"

    as it has proven difficult to implement interactive OpenType \"typesetting\" online.\r\nOnly
    last year, MyFonts introduced the first OpenType online \"Type Tester\".\r\nIIRC
    Richard Kegler at P22 has done similar work."

  body: "I think part of the problem with the \"sub i z space by i_s_space ;\" part
    of the code is your intention seems to be for a beginning of line context. I usually
    use a lookup for this. First create a class: such as:\r\nAll = all letters including
    space\r\n\r\nfeature clig {\r\n\r\nlookup calt_iz.start {\r\nignore sub @All i'
    z';\r\nsub i' z' by i_s;\r\n} calt_iz.start;\r\n\r\n} clig;"

  body: "Thanks for the replies guys.\r\n\r\n@Nick: I've sent Amy an email to ask
    for tips so fingers crossed. Do you have anything more on Richard Kegler's work
    of the same vein? I found <a href=\"http://www.planet-typography.com/news/designer/kegler.html\">this
    interview</a> where he describes random Opentype features to alternate a distressed
    look but couldn't find anything about word substitution?\r\n\r\n@Stephen: Thanks
    for the coding. I tried a naked test file and it worked perfectly to change the
    'iz' usage to 'is' when at the start of a sentence and not elsewhere as you said.
    However, I need to change all instances of 'iz' into 'is', neglecting those at
    the end of words (like whiz) or in the middle of words (fizz) or with letters
    following (izaak). It's very possible that I'm trying to manipulate basic Opentype
    to do things that other strings of code can do. Would it be possible for you to
    explain the sections of your code or forward me to a code-learning site?\r\n\r\nThanks
    again,\r\nLewis"

    been quite a learning curve and whilst I'm still trying to wrap my head around
    the coding side, it has been so much better for it. Thanks again for everyone's
    input!\r\n\r\nLewis"

  body: "I recall playing around with some of my own \"prank\" font experiments as
    soon as learned about the feature. There was nothing as well thought out as what
    Amy did. The problem with creating a diabolically funny prank font circa 2005
    was that few applications supported OTF layout. OpenType can do more crazy stuff
    than just the calt as well. \r\n\r\nI think I also played around with the idea
    of the \"secret word\". That is, you type a secret word and get a special ligature
    or symbol. Of course with the various glyphs pallets people can still find it,
    so its not very exclusive.  "
