  \ One skill I'd like to mention is \"exposure to \u210B\u221E design techniques\".
  \ Yeah, the mathematical technique is usually named with a script or chancery `H'
  with a subscript infinity symbol.  I can get away with an italic H---but are mathematical
  symbols appropriate in a resum\xE9?\r\n\r\nAlso, what fonts are likely to have an
  infinity symbol that will fit nicely with [[http://typophile.com/node/4372|Jos Buivenga's]]
  [[http://www.josbuivenga.demon.nl/fontin.html|fontin]]?  (Which I think works nicely

    So long as it's recognizable, I'm fine. I'm just very leery of haphazardly mixing

    say then are essential if you are applying for a job in mathematics. I mean, if
    the symbol was used in the titles of papers you published, you need these in the
    resume.\r\n\r\nAs for matching, weight is about all you have to worry about. Math
    symbols are not normally italicized (a slanted plus sign is just wrong, mathematically)."
