    relate back to calligraphy and the act of holding and writing with a pen. here,
    the thick and thin strokes make a whole different kind of sense and it is quite
    pleasant to look at. \r\n\r\nR"

    (actually, two of them look like wristwatches!) spelling the initials of the band
    members' last names (Guyot, Iturri, Toth)... The results are not as pretty as
