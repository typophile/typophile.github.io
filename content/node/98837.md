body: "Hello,\r\nI have a big assignment for school and I've decided to display my
  work in a fake magazine  (I don't know if it makes any sense). I've chosen to take
  CLASH magazine as an inspiration for page settings but I have some trouble identifying
  the fonts they use and I'd really like to use the same since I think they look very
  good.\r\nI'm posting a few pages, if you know the name of any font on it, please
  tell me (I don't care about the logo, though)\r\nSorry, I guess most of them must
  be quite obvious, but I don't know a lot about fonts.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/tumblr_mbiuoiJXB31qalxfho1_500_5825.jpg][img:sites/default/files/old-images/tumblr_m8695uEzln1qabbk3o1_500_6114.jpg][img:sites/default/files/old-images/tumblr_m700jnXXtr1qbvz7jo1_500_4445.png][img:sites/default/files/old-images/tumblr_lzstzs9vS71qgw5fjo1_500_3985.png]"

  body: "Probably all bespoke typefaces, at least masthead and headlines.\r\nFor \"CLASH\"
    masthead, I'd probably start with [[http://commercialtype.com/typefaces/graphik/super|Graphik
    Super]] recreating /C with a middle right cut /O.\r\nFor the headlines, it's either
    all from scratch or they could have start from some slab-serif condensed, elongated
    it, rework/remove some serifs and add some elements (strokes, double bars...)
    to give some contemporary feeling to it. If you like this kind of fonts, have
    a look to [[http://tendollarfonts.com/|Ten Dollar Fonts]].\r\nAccording to this
    [[http://www.typophile.com/node/92952|previous discussion]], body text could be
    [[http://www.typography.com/fonts/font_overview.php?productLineID=100017|Mercury
    Text]] but hard to say at this size."
