  Is any way to overcome this headache?\r\n\r\nLinks to related discussions are also

  body: "I ran the compareFamily to a bunch of bought fonts as well and got similar
    errors in them too so I'm wondering how relevant/critical these errors are? I
    understand the script was made for Adobe, so not all of the checks are relevant
    to others.\r\n\r\n_____________________\r\n<a href=\"http://www.dinariraqi.com/\">Iraqi

  body: Nope, but sometimes FontLab renders character in the main panel until it reaches
    zero, then stops dead. Go figure...
