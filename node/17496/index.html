  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">I just completed the MA Typo/Graphic Studies at LCC in London. My final project was about the use of blackletter in Mexico. I explored the possible reasons for its use, historical facts, and the shapes and tendencies of Mexican blackletters. From the photographic research performed in Mexico I found patterns and deviations in Mexican blackletters. Then I deconstructed each signage, ending up with more than 1500 individual characters. I removed the letters from its context and colour, transforming the colourful typographic elements of the original signs into black silhouettes. Afterwards I overlaid all characters of each letter in order to appreciate the most popular shapes, line strokes, elements and ornaments. The result is an X-Ray look-alike alphabet, that conveys the essence of Mexican blackletters.</div>

<p>Is not published yet. But I’m trying, if not as a book at least as an article in a type magazine.</p>

Thank you again for all your enthusiastic comments. I will keep you posted on the progress of this project.</p>
<p>By the way, thanks to the person that directed the publisher Mark Batty to the project. I’m very exited with the possibilities that are been opening.</p>
<p>I’m attaching small size versions of 2 posters of the project, that I made for an exhibition.</p>
<p>The first one is a compound of all the characters gathered and the second one is a example text… is in Spanish, the translation is ‘We are not the best, but we are the tastiest’ this comes from the facia sign of a sandwich shop in Mexico City that I photographed for the project.</p>
<p>Ups! I don’t know how to attach an image. Could any one instruct me on that matter…</p>

		<div class="commentbody">Aaron,
You are very kind. I’m absolutely thrilled with the responses that my work has produced. It was absolutely unexpected. 
I had to do all this work in only 4 months, one of which was taking pictures in Mexico and trying to gather information on this phenomenon. The other 3 months were of sleepless nights of understanding the shapes, cutting and ‘cleaning’ the characters, overlaying them, reading and researching all I could about blackletter.
I literally dreamed with little colourful characters, that became black, or that I had to arrange… for three consecutive months. This project has been one of the most amazing journeys of my life, both in a creative and intellectual level.</div>

<p>Which is I think due in large part to a
general desire, at least among typophiles,
for blackletter to be treated more fairly
than it has, for its unique attributes to be
allowed to shine through the politicking.</p>

<p>This seems to overlap slightly with my project, Handselecta, which looks at graffiti&rsquo;s regional styles. A relatively informative essay by CHAZ Bojorquez can be found here:</p>

<p>In the article he refers to a book called &ldquo;Los Angeles Barrio Calligraphy&rdquo; (by Jerry and Sally Romotsky, Dawson&rsquo;s Book Shop, 1976). which only showed up 2 used on amazon for $285 :(</p>

		<div class="commentbody">I absolutely agree with you. Blackletter has such an interesting history! Just to name a few of its stories… it was used to print the first book in the west (as we all know), it was enforced by the Nazis, and then prohibit by them; it has an ambivalent nature that makes it suitable for newspapers mastheads and punk/rock bands!
I have realized that people react to blackletter, with the strongest of passion. Either people love it or hate it, apparently there are no in-betweens for this exquisite type breed.
Is the letterform for the dissent and for the traditionalist!</div>

<p>Well' ok, but only if you bend my arm&hellip; Handselecta is a project that looks at graffiti and its geographic styles and differences. Each city has a different characteristic that unifies the scripts that writers employ. Less now with the cross polinization of the internet, but nonetheless, the roots are still there,</p>
<p>As for the Cholo/Mexican American/Cailifornia style of graffiti, Handselecta is working with an artist named Mike Giant from Albequerque, New Mexico, who is very influenced by this lettering style in his artwork. <a href="http://www.handselecta.com/fonts_hsgiant_so.html">http://www.handselecta.com/fonts_hsgiant_so.html</a> <a href="http://www.mikegiant.com/">http://www.mikegiant.com/</a></p>
<p>My understanding (please fill in any of the blanks or fuzzy facts if anyone knows) is that most of the early printing presses in Colonial Mexico were stocked with Dutch blackletter types, because of the political link between the royal families of Spain and the Netherlands. These printing types are the basis for what has become most of the vernacular blackletter that we find handlettered in this culture. It is ingrained in the culture and was adopted by the gangs of LA as early as the 30&rsquo;s according to Chaz&rsquo;s article, pre-spray paint and was executed in brush, or as Chaz conjectures, possibly the daubers of shoe-shine boys</p>
<p>Another interesting iteration is the pichacao style of graffiti form Brazil, which is also a square-ish blackletter style executed with small rollers as opposed to spray paint.</p>
<p>Attached is a cholo handstyle by Mike Giant, taken from his blog:<img src="/images/old-images/header.gif" alt=""></p>
<p>And here is a pretty good example of pichacao by Os Gemeos of Sao Paulo<img src="/images/old-images/gemeos.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>Sorry, for opening it up to subject matter outside of Mexico, hope this is relevant to you.</p>
<p>Best,
Christian</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Here is a little bit of history on how blackletter first came to the New Continent. Is from my book.</p>
<p>America was discovered in 1492 and by 1521, Hernan Cortes, on behalf of the Spanish crown, conquered Mexico, establishing the Colony of New Spain. 
The first printing press in the American continent was found in Mexico in 1538, by means of Juan de Zumárraga, first bishop of Mexico, and Jakob Kronberger (known as Jacobo Cromberger), the most important printer in Seville at the time, who, been of German origin, was the founder one of the first printing presses in Seville around the beginning of the 1500’s.
Jacobo Comberger supplied all the materials and tools, such as press, movable types, ink and paper and sent one of his closest technicians, Italian Giovanni Paoli (known as Juan Pablos) to be in charge of setting up and run the first printing press in the New World.
In 1544 the fist printed book in America was published: Doctrina Breve by Fray Juan de Zumárraga, which was set in Rotunda blackletter, proving that movable types of blackletter where taken to Mexico.</p>
<p>Christian, 
please don’t apologize. Your topic is super interesting!</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>For what I have seen… Most of the blackletters that first came to Mexico were Rotunda, since this was the most popular blackletter in Spain at the time. This is a heavy but rounder letterform than Textura.</p>
<p>“Rotunda was created at the beginning of the 14th century in Italy. It became very popular as a round gothic type, and its use extended for centuries. It is believed to be a transitional letterform from blackletter to roman. 
The top and bottom ends of the stems no longer have the diamond shape that is present in Textura. The character a is double-storied with the lower part kept very small; the o is curved on the top right and bottom left, but remains broken on the bottom right and top left. In general, the shape of the letters is rounder and therefore more legible than in its predecessor.”

<p>Quite appropriately, the validity of the &ldquo;discovery&rdquo; of
America by Columbus is closely parallel to that of the
&ldquo;invention&rdquo; of printing by Gutenberg!</p>
<p>Thierry, when a pivotal and often-repeated fallacy
comes up, I think it&rsquo;s a good thing to try to correct it.</p>
<p>&ndash;</p>
<p>Even the Vikings probably came later. There are theories that involve the Arabs (think of the astrolabe), the Polynesians, the Chinese, and even the Ancient Egpytians (thanks to certain grains that only occur in Egypt and the New World). But really, in the end, claiming to have &ldquo;discovered&rdquo; a land that was already inhabited is pretty sick. Although thinking in those terms certainly makes the subsequent genocide easier to cope with for the oppressor&hellip;</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I agree with you on the importance of been clear and fair with the facts… I know that there are many theories (and some facts) about this encounters that you are pointing out; one of which is the ‘Bering Strait Theory’, that supports the idea that tribes from north-eastern Asia came to America between 12,000 and 60,000 years ago. I know there are many others from then.</p>
<p>It is delightful to run into people that are keen on accuracy and clarity… but I’m not surprised: After all we are in a typographers/philes forum!</p>
<p>So allow me to refrace:
In 1492 Christopher Columbus arrived to America and by 1521, Hernan Cortes, on behalf of the Spanish crown, conquered Mexico, establishing the Colony of New Spain.</p>
<p>Now is clear that the &lsquo;discovery&rsquo; that I’m referring to is the one of Columbus, which is directly linked to the Conquest and the Colony of New Spain.
(is funny… I decided to put the discovery of 1492 just to make clear to the reader that the Colony wasn’t immediate. It took many years, and many battles)</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t mean to hijack this thread, but seeing these storefront photos you posted reminded me of the buses in Buenos Aires&hellip; Many of them sport hand-painted signs and decorations (done by artisans known as <em>fileteadores</em>), and if my memory is correct some of those buses use blackletter, too.</p>
<p>The only good image I could find online is <a href="http://www.leni.com.ar/images/big/filete_portenio.jpg">here</a>&hellip; it is not blackletter and does not come from a bus, but it is a good example of what <em>fileteado</em> looks like.</p>

Sorry for taking so long to post something… Great sign! Beautiful letters!.. actually in Mexico we also have some like that… but I have absolutely no idea of how those letters are called, but the ‘fileteado’ sounds appropriate because it literally means something with ‘filetes’, which are long and narrow ornaments attached to something else.
interesting…</p>
<p>By the way in Mexico we have professional hand letterers as well. They are called ‘rotulistas’.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Dear Alia,</p>
<p>The reason why blackletter is used in Mexico is not entirely clear, although I have some theories on the matter. One possible explanation could come from the Spanish background of the country. The overwhelming Colonial history is still present, not only in the collective unconscious but also in buildings, plazas and entire cities some of which use this letterform in their signage as a way of communicating their abounding Colonial background to tourists and visitors. But this can’t be the only reason why Mexicans use blackletter, simply because many are not aware of this connotation, and others have something else in mind when there are exposed to this letterform.<br>
My belief is that the use of blackletter in folk functional graphics out of the Colonial contexts comes from the very essence of Mexican culture. Mexicans are fond of ornaments, colour and contrast; humour and fantasy; rituals and festivities. One needs only to visit the nearest market available to experience all this at once; the viewer would be welcomed by the sound of local music, which rhythms mix with the ongoing voices of merchants offering magical or paradisiacal products that range from fruits and vegetables to plants or objects, one more astounding that the other. Walking along, this imaginary spectator would be overwhelm by the smells in the environment; at every step a new odour would invade his nostrils, going from the smell of flowers been sold at his right, to the seductive aroma of food been prepared on his left, to the indefinable fragrance of raw fruit that is just in front of him. In parallel, his eyes would be bombarded by an army of colours and shapes, which are as seductive and overwhelming as the elements arousing his other senses.
This is every day life in Mexico, and this is the context in which blackletter is embraced and used. The letterform in its self is full of ornaments and contrast, playful and mysterious at the same time; the conjunction of characters overpowers the background, just as the elements of the market overtake the environment and therefore the viewer.</p>

<p>When did blackletter become so much a part of Mexican folk graphics?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m wondering if it has any connection to the period of the emperor Maximillian, archduke of Austria, and his wife Carlota of Belgium (in other words, the 1860s).</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Xensen,</p>
<p>On the subject of the Discovery of America… actually my original line of thought was the same as you, but I understand is a delicate matter and of course is always better to be as accurate as possible when one is writing about something.
I appreciate your willingness to understand what I was trying to communicate.</p>
<p>On the matter of when blackletter became so popular in Mexican folk functional graphics… well that’s trickier, first of all because for what I know no one has dig into that! So I’ve had to do my bit of research, but for now I have concentrated more on analyzing the ‘live’ design matter on the streets of Mexico today, than tracing down a philology of Mexican blackletters (which would be fascinating! And I don’t discard doing it one day).
I know the date when blackletter movable type arrived to Mexico: 1538, and I know it was used on printed matter, but when it jumped to hand letter signage? It remains to be discovered. I also know that today ‘rotulistas’ (professional hand letterers in Mexico) take inspiration from the internet —I know this because I asked a few to draw me an specimen: one said he didn’t knew all letters so he would try to find them out (he never did) and the other told me that he would search on the web and print them out for me! … Of course that wasn’t what I wanted so I encourage him to draw them (and he did).</p>
<p>Is important to bear in mind that most folk functional graphics in Mexico are set in roman type in its serif or sans serif versions.</p>

There are a number of traditional Austrian styles of beer that now only exist in Mexico. You can hear the Austrian musical  influence on Ranchero, all those 3/4 waltzes and polkas that dominate the Mariachi repertoire.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Hola Christina,</p>
<p>First of all, congratulations! The work you did is really amazing.
When I went to Mexico I was always impressed and fascinated by the way Mexicans use 
colours and graphics. As I&rsquo;m from &ldquo;grey&rdquo; Germany this was so refreshing!</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m working at the moment on a similar theme. For my final Project in my graphic design studies I try to research the modern day usage of Blackletter. 
I&rsquo;m especially interested in the way how people outside Germany and Europe percieve 
Blackletter fonts and for what purposes they are used.
I feel this differs a lot from how people see it in central Europe.
Maybe I can contact you and you could help me with my research?
I am preparing a kind of question sheet with different examples of Blackletter.
In my synthesis in a second ste I want to see how Blackletter could be used in a modern way, far from the beer-nationalist-punk-skateboard-kind of way.</p>

<p>Maybe so… But blackletter first came to Mexico with the Spanish, and during that time blackletter, especially Rotunda, was very popular in Spain.
I don’t know much about printing press (or for that matter typographical culture) during the Maximilian emperorship in Mexico. But it is absolutely worth dig into that, because maybe some interesting facts could come out of it. Thanks!</p>

Christina I&rsquo;m new in this forum. I just wanted to say that I found your book idea very interesting. By the way I have just started my MA course in LCC. Are you still going around there but maybe you don&rsquo;t leave in England anymore. I would be very glad to meet you and maybe have a chat.</p>
<p>Take care</p>

As someone in the early stages of thrashing out a direction for a Masters of Computer Graphic Design in New Zealand I thank you for your post. I can only but hope that as I pursue my dissertation my outcomes are half as interesting as yours. All the best with publication potential, I too hope to read your work in the future. Definitely a work that I will purchase for myself and the university I work for.</p>

<p>If by chance you should be near Guadalajara, Make sure you see their Ballet Folklorico. It is an auditory and visual feast you will never forget. And it is very distinct from the Mexico City presentation, which is more traditional. And the stately Teatro Degollado is a wonderful venue for it.</p>

<p>That is indeed a superb book (it&rsquo;s one of the two things that triggered my own interest
in blackletter), and not least because it doesn&rsquo;t shy away from the reality that national
identity exists, and it matters (although like anything else, it can be abused).</p>

<p>Well I’ll be happy to help you in anything I can. Write me an email thru this forum.</p>
<p>I don’t know if it might be of use to you… Last August I performed a questionnaire in Mexico City about the use and perceptions of blackletter in Mexico to about 65 or more people.
I did it my self, so I’m not sure if the questions I asked were the best ones… but is done and translated to English. If you want I can share it with you, no problem.
Curiously… most people haven’t really noticed the letterform around the City!</p>
<p>Tu proyecto suena muy interesante. Te deseo mucha suerte!</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Hola Christina,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m glad you replied, I already feared the topic was dead.
Actually the questionnaire is exactly the kind of thing I need.
I prepared one myself.
I didn&rsquo;t ask many questions as for my work I won&rsquo;t be able to make a profound investigation, It is more of getting a basic idea. Also, as we all do I can&rsquo;t wait to get to the design part of the project&hellip;</p>
<p>As the project progresses I took the decision to show the results in the format of a magazine, only or in the major part using different blackletter fonts. Well we&rsquo;ll see.
As for now it would be a great help if you could send me the results of your questionaire.
I will also send you mine to give you an idea.</p>
<p>Muchas gracias y hasta prontito,</p>

you wrote
„Tholan, Nop. I haven’t seen a long s in Mexican blackletter. Because we don’t have that letter in Spanish.“</p>
<p>Yes, but perhaps you had this like in France, where it was probably in use &lsquo;till the french revolution in the late XVIII. Century? Perhabs it&rsquo;s the same in spain and mexico?</p>

<p>Hi Cristina Paoli,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>In my final year focusing on blackletter for the major project I have &gt;admired your work on mexican blackletter. Sounds like you have had &gt;good success now that you are publishing a book.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Have you had alot of opportunities after completing your project?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yes Hanna. Actually loads of people are interested in blackletter, and I’ve had beautiful responses to my project, that have led to exiting projects and forums.
I’m really happy and overwhelmed with the success the project has had so far.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I was interested in what kind of mark you got given for your final &gt;project? (an optional question).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I got an A. And a beautiful pencil from my tutor inscribed with the word EXCELLENT. (I think I value more the pencil than the mark!)</p>
<p>;-)</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>The thing is, it&rsquo;s not really a letter, it&rsquo;s simply a way (an archaic way) to write the regular ol' &ldquo;s&rdquo;, depending on where it falls in the word. And although I certainly haven&rsquo;t looked carefully, I&rsquo;d be surprised if the practice was completely absent from old Mexican typography (and even more so manuscripts).</p>
