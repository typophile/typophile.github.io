body: "I've recently started working on a new serif font, which doesn't have a name
  yet. This began as an experiment with Serifs of a kind I've never done before, and
  this came out of it:\r\nhttp://img.photobucket.com/albums/v629/WurdBendur/experimental.png\r\n\r\nThese
  first few letters I did worked out well enough that I decided to keep going and
  produced some more:\r\nhttp://img.photobucket.com/albums/v629/WurdBendur/allcaps1.png\r\n\r\nAt
  this point, I think I'm starting to have problems with weight not matching up, but
  I went ahead and put together some more:\r\nhttp://img.photobucket.com/albums/v629/WurdBendur/moreletters.png\r\n\r\nI
  haven't done any lowercase yet. I'm playing with just using small caps, but the
  ones I have at the moment are just scaled versions of the capitals and will need
  to be redrawn eventually:\r\nhttp://img.photobucket.com/albums/v629/WurdBendur/smallcaps.png\r\n\r\nSo
  my question is this: Are there any glaring problems you see, and what suggestions
  might you have?"

    wordmark</a>.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure if the upper beaks are in their best condition
    when faced inward, though, particularly in <em>G</em>.\r\n\r\nAre the glyphs aligned
    properly? <em>C, G, O, Q S</em> and <em>U</em> should dip, while the down strokes
    in <em>N, V</em> and <em>W</em> should move up. Basic, right?\r\n\r\n<em>O</em>
    and <em>Q</em> looked not quite at home in the face. Increase the pen angle, maybe?
    <em>H</em> might also be too wide, but it's a matter of personal taste."

  body: "Nice shapes! However:\r\n\r\n- the V is too fat;\r\n- the thin stems of A,
    N and \u0394 are slightly too heavy;\r\n- the pointed below of the N extends a
    bit too far below the base line;\r\n- try to straighten the inner contour of the
    thick stem in the bowls of B, P and R (i.e. no backeted serif at the right); this
    doesn't need to be done elsewhere (e.g. in D), because there is enough white space
    around;\r\n- the same goes for the inner serifs of W;\r\n- make the bowl of G
    bigger so that the upper serif optically matches the width of the character in
    the lower half;\r\n- compensate for ink squash / blackness in the joint of the
    Q tail with the bowl;\r\n- the curled, tilde shaped cross bar of E and F is somwhat
    disturbing; if you want to keep that feature, make sure this matches the cross
    bars in \xD0, \u0398 and \u0142."
