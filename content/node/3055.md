  body: As far as I understand it Neville Brody&#39;s studio do the whole Macromedia
    suit branding. So I figure it will be oneof his own... some elements of it smell
    of his FF Typeface Six but with a more modern interpretation

  body: Macromedia&#39;s corporate face &#40;not used for the individual product icons,
    of course&#41; is Vonnes. It&#39;s a Font Bureau reworking of the venerable Venus.
    <BR> <BR><a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/venus/" target="_blank">http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/venus/</a>
    <BR> <BR>Font Bureau used to list Vonnes in a &#34;Custom&#34; section which,
    sadly, no longer exists.
