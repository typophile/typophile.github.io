  body: "It certainly seems to be a font, because the identical letters do seem to
    be identical, but I searched every paint/brush/dry lettering style I could find
    and didn't see it. That includes Dafont for freebies.\r\n\r\nThat starts to push
    me to custom font.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: "By now, I too believe that\u2019s a custom font. And that\u2019s because
    letters appears <em>too much</em> identical: look at the O and the zero."
