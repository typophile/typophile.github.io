  kitchen equipment, refrigerators, reception desks etc.) any critique is welcomed,
  these are some ideas that i refined I am thinking if I should go with more cursive

  body: "Maybe a food-service professional would recognize what the picture is, but
    to me it's too abstract--just a corner with the four little round things. \r\nThe
    color scheme and the typography say <em>clean</em> and <em>high-tech</em>, but
    they don't say <em>food</em>. I get kind of a biotech or pharmaceutical vibe from
    this, although that's partly because the name <em>Univerzal</em> sounds like a
    prescription drug. I realize they won't let you change the name of the company.
    \r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/aramark_5373.jpg]\r\nHere's the logo
    of one of the biggest food-service outfits in the US, Aramark (possibly somebody
    Univerzal would like as a client). They've been using this logo for 15 or 20 years,
    so it's not exactly on the cutting edge, but it manages to look modern and techie
    without looking cold and antiseptic."

  body: I like the type/color combo in the first one. But the imagery just is the
    wrong style to go with the type. It's too light/subtle and likely (as stated)
    too literal.

  body: I really like the way the corner looks but like others say, without knowing
    what the company does (even though it does say under the logo) it doesn't connect
    right away.

  body: In addition to what others have said, the last two versions should probably
    have the type rendered in the same 3D perspective as the corner of the appliance.
    Otherwise it just looks odd.

  body: "Thank you all for the feedback. \r\nI see that Univerzal sounds to pharmaceutical(antiseptic
    lol) but this firm is located in macedonia and Univerzal means - Universal. So
    the name implies something abstract and well- universal so it can have multiple
    meanings and many applications. This -[[http://univerzal.com.mk/]] is the old
    website of this company, and these are some websites from the region that make
    similar products [[http://frigosan.com.mk/pocetok_en.html]] [[http://frigobox.com.mk/]],
    portionox [[http://portinox.es/english/home.html]] is an international brand in
    this kind of equipment, so as we can see the snowflake is the main symbol which
    represents the refrigerators. I wanted to go in another direction to symbolize
    all the different products this firm has (not just cooling equipment) so the angle
    should be representing the angle of some appliances (stove, refrigerator, whatever...).
    \r\nI am also confused aluminium is saying it is to literal and unlejman is saying
    that it doesnt conect right away. I need some symbol to represent a lot of many
    equipments this firm makes. Anyway thank you all for the feedback I will post
    more ideas."

  body: "Ok. Let's make something clear here. Your image of some sort of kitchen appliance
    isn't anything else but that. An image. It's an image beside your logo. It's definitely
    not part of your logo. And it shouldn't be. Not like this. It merely serves as
    an inappropriate logo background.\r\n\r\nYou will either have to create a proper
    logo symbol (should work in full colour as well as BW) or create a clean typographic
    one.\r\n\r\n___________\r\n<em>Robert Koritnik</em>"

  body: Same comments here, stick to the typo, an illustration like this have nothing
    to do with a logo. Maybe you could keep this illustration for corporate id like
    letterhead, brochure or whatever but it's not belonging to a your logo - wich
    color and typo are nice BTW.
