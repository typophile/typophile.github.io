    a good thing, or a bad thing? Chewbacca groans even when he is happy.

  body: My daughter grew up thinking that puns &#40;the bigger the groaner the better&#41;
    were called &#34;Dad Jokes&#34;--her name for it, not mine. <BR> <BR>She is home
    visiting us from college and I showed her the P22 card knowing she would enjoy
    it as much as I did.  Her first comment was, &#34;Did I give them the idea?&#34;
    No, I said.  There are other people in this world who share my shameless joy in
    puns. <BR> <BR>Thanks Richard, keep up the good work. <BR> <BR>ChrisL
