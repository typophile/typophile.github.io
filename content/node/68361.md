  use, and I've developed a particular liking for Futura. \r\n\r\nUnfortunately as
  a student, I obviously cannot afford the whole family and I'll probably  buy just
  one weight. I've narrowed it down between Futura Book and Futura Medium, both in
  the URW++ variant as it is the cheapest:\r\nhttp://new.myfonts.com/fonts/urw/futura/t-book/\r\nhttp://new.myfonts.com/fonts/urw/futura/t-medium/\r\n\r\nSo
  I just need some help choosing between the two. The two are similar, though I'm
  pretty undecided over which one of the two to get. My emotional response is pretty
  much identical between the two weights. It's going to be for things such as various
  school projects(posters,etc.),headings for papers,etc. No commercial work or any
  of that stuff. \r\n\r\nAny thoughts? \r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nJames"

  body: "I would suggest Book.\r\nYou can use it for text, and at large sizes for
    display.\r\nHowever, Medium is too strong for sustained text.\r\nThe all-cap setting
    of the Book is very classical, it has a style that can suit many different subjects.\r\nThe
    Book is also the original weight of the typeface, and embodies the principle behind
    it in its purest form."

  body: If you go for the book weight, consider buying <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/singles/elsnerflake/futura_book_text_pro_ot/?&sample_text=efficient&sample_size=96&update=0">Futura
    Book Text Pro</a>. It contains old-style figures, some nice ligatures and <a href="http://www.100besteschriften.de/bilder/005/Futura_Muster_web.png">alternate
    forms</a> from the original metal Futura for several letters. Unfortunately, it
    is much more expensive than the URW version ($20 vs. $80).

  body: Softmaker could be an alternative. I think, they have Futura in their collection
    with a different name. (In case of Stempel Garamond the outlines are identically.
    Stempel Garamond is likewise contained in the Softmaker collection.) The number
    of characters may be limited.

  body: Look into Adobe's Font Folio for Education. It costs $149, which will seem
    like a lot, but it gives you 500 fonts. Trouble is, I couldn't find anywhere on
    the Adobe pages that actually lists the fonts. If they have Futura, they will
    have at least a set of four or six weights.
