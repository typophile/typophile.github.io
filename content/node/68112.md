  body: You could place your onum feature after your frac feature. Then all you have
    to do is substitute the figures and fraction bar with their onum versions.

  body: "The order makes a difference, and you can use it to your advantage (or at
    least need to be aware of the implications). You can change the order (in FontLab)
    by dragging the features up and down in the list on the left side of the OpenType
    Panel. \r\n\r\nBTW, when you add a new feature, it gets placed just before (above)
    the currently selected feature. If you know where you want it to go in the list,
    you can use this to save the step of moving it. Note: You need to hit the \"compile\"
    button to get it to stay in this initial spot, otherwise it will get moved to
    the end when you save. I have no idea why, but that's how it works."

  body: Frode, I think your frac code is fine. You can safely leave out the section
    that forces pre-built fractions to be used if you think users might want to manually
    kern them.

    (I also found and read Tal\u2019s article via the same thread). It does make sense
    to not force the pre built fractions. Thank you, Mark and Arno.\r\n\r\nIf anyone
    know why I can\u2019t add to the classes, I would be very grateful. I\u2019ll
    never learn Opentype if I just copy someones code everytime I run into a problem."

  body: By adding glyphs to the classes are you making it so that the classes that
    are being substituted have different numbers of glyphs in them? That will cause
    an error.

  body: Right, but what I was saying in my first reply is that you can avoid the whole
    problem with adding figure variants to the fraction code by putting the frac feature
    before features like onum, etc. That way, the frac feature only has to deal with
    the default figures. Adding all the different figure styles to the frac feature
    would add some unnecessary complexity to the feature code (unless maybe you have
    fractions with old style figures or something, which I don't think is the case,
    right?).

    the lining figures.\r\n\r\nThanks Craig, that was it.\r\n\r\n"
