  body: It reads pretty well. The main source of the "discombobulated" aspect is probably
    the lowercase n/e, which creates a mismatched double letter. See if you can rework
    it into a capital E, matching the I/E as much as you can. Also, I think you can
    make the L/G clearer both ways by attaching the bottom loop of the L at the bottom
    end instead, then making it much bigger for the g counter.

    probably a better solution for that combination - how does this strike you?\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/dangreene_ambigram_new_3554.png]"
