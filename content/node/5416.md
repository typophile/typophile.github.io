    had to rethink my strategy &#40;a glyph a day&#41; but it was fun to think i could
    do it for a while. anyhow i&#39;ve roughed out the basic gist of the lc, and taken
    this in a different direction than i chose for my first w. i wanted the characters
    to be a little more &#34;inkey&#34; and &#34;gooey&#34; but i still want it to
    be pretty clean. the character with the best &#34;polish&#34; in the following
    example would definately be the a &#40;the short one&#41; i&#39;ve worked a bit
    on the n and the u by straightening out the verticals, but they need a lot more
    attention. anyhow, i guess right now i wanna find out if i&#39;m going in the
    right direction. whaddya think? hope to hear from somebody... anybody... <BR><!--attachment:

    this old Pokemon thing that said &#34;Pikachu, I choose you!&#34; I just broke
    out laughing, because I thought &#34;Oh man, Pikachu is so yesterday!&#34;&#42;
    <BR> <BR>Then I immediately thought, I need to change my typophile icon to Pikachu.
    Can&#39;t explain why, but I couldn&#39;t get the idea out of my head for the
    rest of the vacation. <BR> <BR>Rest assured, I will change it in the not too distant
    future. <BR> <BR>How is Adam coming along? <BR> <BR> &#42; Being so yesterday
    made this a perfect match for Viennna. I&#39;ve never been in a city that was
    so about yesterday in my whole life. I don&#39;t think that Vienna could fake
    contemporary to save its life. This was sadly the most boring vacation destination

    I'm sure that you can set excellent Hebrew display strings with it (disclaimer,
    I cannot weigh in pro or against the design of these Hebrew glyphs. I know too
    little about the writing system :-(  ).\r\n\r\nIt is just like I wouldn't call
    [[Helvetica Linotype]] a Hebrew typeface, even though John Hudson included Hebrew
    into its character set. Helvetica Linotype is a Latin face that can also set Greek,
    Cyrillic, Hebrew, and Arabic. Or maybe it is a global face that can set Latin
    (even Vietnamese!), Greek, Cyrillic, Hebrew, and Arabic. But the main focus &
    audience of the font isn't Hebrew (disclaimer, I cannot weigh in pro or against
    the design of these Hebrew glyphs. I know too little about the writing system
    :-(  ).\r\n\r\nYes, I must have posted somewhere that I find the idea of Hebrew
    blackletter distasteful. I love Blackletter, and I love Hebrew, but I wouldn't
    ever mix the two, personally. Maybe there is someone who can pull that off\u2014maybe
    Kaas does it\u2014but the \"idea\" just doesn't sit well with me. I'd rather not
