  body: It is Adobe Garamond. The uppercase "T" to go along with the "R" are the indicators.
    Usually when identifying typefaces, I first look at the "R" which more times than
    not usually has the identifying characteristics of a particular font.

  body: Certainly not Trajan. Looks like Garamond, but I can't tell exactly which
    version, probably Adobe's.
