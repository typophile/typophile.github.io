  name set in avant garde. now a wee while back i learnt about avant garde and its
  history (and its ligatures)... \r\n\r\nbut now i  was wondering, i'd quite like
  to update the logo as it really is just carelessly set, and just tweak it slightly
  (so nothing drastic, maybe just some ligatures). an overhaul is not an option (despite
  my wishes)\r\n\r\nam i going to go to typography hell for mucking about with ag
  and its ligatures?\r\n\r\nor does anyone have any alternative typefaces that might
  be subtle alternatives...\r\n\r\ndanke,\r\n\r\n"
