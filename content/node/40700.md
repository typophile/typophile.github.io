  body: "I haven\u2019t contributed because I cannot totally grasp the usefulness
    of this list.\r\n\r\nWhat I mean: there\u2019s no need to argue about the essentiality
    of Georgia & Verdana for on-screen (i.e. web) usage \u2013\_due to the medium\u2019s
    limited options. If your profession is book design, then you better have a good
    Garalde or two. Which face? Up to you, imho. And for corporate design projects
    or magazines, you want to have a big versatile system \u2013 not that important
    (or better say: easy to agree on) which very one, &c\r\n\r\nThat said, I rather
    like the approach raised in <a href=\"http://www.typophile.com/node/29208\">this
    \ thread</a> (the answers by Dan, Paul and others).\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: That's very interesting, Florian. Thanks. The essential typeface list says
    it is "an experiment to compile a list agreed upon by Typophiles." I wondered
    why so few had contributed.

  body: "I think fonts are too subjective for a list like this. The only essential
    is that the font work for the project I have in mind. And have a thorough character
    set.\r\n\r\nTypophiles will never agree on anything. What one typophile calls
    essential might be a font I wouldn't touch with a 10-foot-pole. And vice versa."
