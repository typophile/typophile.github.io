body: "I bought Fontographer in the 90s, did some type design, then moved on to other
  things, and haven't touched FOG since. I want to get back into type design, so I'm
  wondering which makes more sense: upgrading to FOG 4.7 or getting TypeTool. Either
  option would cost me $99, and since it's been so long since I've used FOG, I'm not
  concerned about having to re-learn anything by moving to TypeTool. I know FOG should
  have some more features than TT, but after looking at the product comparison chart,
  they look really equal (with TT ahead in some features).\r\n\r\nSince I'm more or
  less a beginner at this point, I don't need super advanced features, and TT seems
  like a more modern program, and  maybe a bit easier to use, and if I ever decided
  to upgrade to Fontlab, I'd already know how to use the program.\r\n\r\nAnyone have
  any recommendations?\r\n\r\n\r\nthanks!\r\n\r\n\r\nJonathan"

    I don't wish to cause the Fontlab people any grief, but do consider [[http://fontforge.sf.net/|FontForge]].\r\nIt's
    a little awkward and messy in some respects, notably that you have to get it working
    in X11 or Cygwin rather than native operating environments (unless you're on a
    Linux box), but the features are more than good enough and it's not going to cost
    you anything for trying."

    you're not concerned about learning, so I'd pick TypeTool. It is a good stepping-stone
    to FontLab, which is the primary tool used by professionals these days, including
    us at Adobe.\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\nT"

  body: I tried Typetool for about three months. It was really nice, but even for
    a total beginner like me it was just too limited, so I caved in and upgraded to
    Fontlab.

  body: "Thanks for all the advice! I thought about making the jump right into Fontlab,
    but I'd rather only be out the $99 rather than the $299 if I end up sucking. If
    I get TypeTool, I can always use my FOG serial number to upgrade to FontLab (since
    it'scheaper to upgrade to FL from FOG than TT). \r\n\r\nJames, what limitations
    of TT caused you to upgrade to FL? After reading the comparison charts, and trying
    out the demos, I still  can't quite tell what the limitations of TT and FOG are
    compared to each other.\r\n\r\n\r\nthanks!\r\n\r\n\r\nJonathan"

  body: I'm pretty sure you can, although I haven't tried myself (having neither application).  At
    worst you'd have to generate a font from one program and import it into the other.

  body: "Jonathan\r\n\r\nI'd recommend the upgrade to FOG rather than TypeTool. The
    latter has limitations, such s restricted transform effects (that for me make
    it quite useless). In that regard FOG has much more capability and is a far simpler
    program to use than either FontLab or TT. FOG can't create fonts in the OT format
    but if that is necessary FOG databases can be ported over to TypeTool Pro or FontLab
    with FogLamp.\r\n\r\nGerald"

  body: "Drawing in Typetool can be a big pain, especially when it comes to building
    up shapes from strokes. The lack of transform effects Gerald Mentioned can be
    bothersome. Lack of autotracing was a big problem, because what Livetrace generates
    is next to worthless for lettering, but Fontlab can be a huge timesaver when I
    want to build up a complex letter without using the pen tools. That might not
    matter to serious type designers who don\u2019t trace, but I\u2019m a student
    and have to cut corners when time is really tight. There were other things, but
    it\u2019s been a few months and I can\u2019t really remember them now.\r\n\r\nOn
    the upside, Fontlab will issue you a refund for Typetool to upgrade to Fontlab
    within three months of purchase. So you can always start with Typetool and upgrade
    later."

    If ones 90's experience with FOG was pre-4.0, there is no current upgrade to what
    you were drawing with. After 3.x, 'Macromedia' re-interfaced FOG to 'match' Freehand,
    the previous interface was discontinued, (So you may be starting from scratch,
    UI experience-wise, regardless of your choice).\r\nCheers!\r\n"

    then I found out there was an upgrade. I just happened to be interested in doing
    a font, so I upgraded. \r\n\r\nAfter upgrading there were a few things that bugged
    me about the program, like not being able to cut and paste from Illustrator very
    well. Maybe I needed a newer version of Illustrator, but I couldn't do a straight
    cut and paste into Fontographer. I also wanted the capability of making OpenType
    fonts. Lastly, I'm one of those very very rare people that spent years on Macs
    and got converted to the PC. I preferred to work in Windows, but the Fontographer
    upgrade was for Macs.\r\n\r\nSo, I upgraded to FontLab Studio and I'm really pleased
    with it. "
