  body: Zapf Humanist is the Bitstream version of Optima (someone correct me if i'm
    wrong) and this looks a lot like Optima to me.

  body: thanks Simon, yep Optima is very close, but there are subtle differences,
    for example the upper and lowercase w in the regular weight and the single storey
    a in the italic. Perhaps this is an earlier non digitised cut of Otima? I have
    read of Matthew Carters "Optima Classified" but am unable to find a sample.

    don't know enough about it.\r\n\r\nHere is a MyFonts search, you might find something
    in here: http://new.myfonts.com/search/optima/fonts/"
