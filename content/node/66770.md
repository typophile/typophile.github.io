  body: "I assume you are looking for the Super Dry script, and my suggestion for
    something similar is Leslie Cabarga's [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/fontbureau/casey/bold/characters.html|Casey
    Bold]]. You can see the alternate S (glyph 139) is more like your sample. It's
    not exact, but at least it's close and Casey even comes with a swash (glyph 133).\r\n\r\n-
