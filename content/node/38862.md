  \ I know he was born around 1490's but I have searched high and low and have yet
  to find his exact date of birth.\r\n\r\nI would be grateful if anyone had any references
  of his birthdate."

    as in today\u2019s society, or at least they weren\u2019t recorded. And even if
    they had been recorded by some local (baptismal) authority, they would have had
    to endure some hard times.\r\nYou are lucky if you can narrow it down to the correct
    year."
