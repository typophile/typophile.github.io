body: "So I saw this font in AIGA's 50 Books of 1962 book.  \r\nThe title of the book
  cover that includes the font is \"41st Annual of Advertising & Editorial Art & Design\"
  \ \r\n\r\nIt's very similar to Didot, but the 4's are very different.  The closest
  4 I've found is Bell MT.\r\n\r\nPlease help!"

  body: Since it's from 1962 it may be an old headline Didot that was never digitized.
