  Thx

  body: What is the scale difference? Will Waters Titling being quite a lot larger?
    Which weight are you using? Perhaps <a href="http://www.adobe.com/type/browser/P/P_1153.html">Avenir</a>?
    (If it is small.) Or perhaps <a href="http://www.adobe.com/type/browser/P/P_1734.html">Cronos</a>?
    I really wish <a href="http://www.adobe.com/type/browser/P/P_1115.html">Penumbra</a>
    had a lowercase because I'd suggest that as well. I'd imagine what ever you are
    doing, since you used the world "elegant," it needs to be fairly thin as to at
    least match closely the thinnest part of the weight of Waters that you are using.
    I'd enjoy seeing what it is you are doing.

    advice too. I'd love to have you look at it. Well, I hope it's elegant anyway.

  body: "Here are 2 versions. First is the last one marketing and sales saw. They
    like it, except the fact that 'famous' is the most visible on the title. Unfortunately
    I came on after the title design meeting. I was told that the title and the subtitle
    should be nearly the same in importance. This is tricky because the title doesn't
    tell you what the book is about, thus the sub needs to be more visible. This is
    like the 12th version of this. AND my immediate boss just told me that the one
    on the right (which I like only a little less than the one on the left,) is too
    extreme of a switch.\r\n \r\nThe image is cropped photo of a spotlight on curtains,
    playing on the 'stage-left' aspect of not being famous, similar as to showing
    a red carpet with no one on it.\r\n\r\nalso: they won't let me use any kind of
    clich\xE9 writing instruments. Pencils, pens, typewriters &c.\r\n\r\nThen there
    is this...\r\nhttp://static.flickr.com/122/303283067_469933c73c_o.png\r\nOut of

    but set it in red? Stacked them as one paragraph instead of space in between?

  body: I still think the point size should stay constant. I also think the line-spacing
    is a tad tight. Couldn't the author's name be in the bottom third in white? (Just
    another thought.)

  body: "Not liking the Waters -- unbelievable font though. The tight, stacked caps
    give me spiritual conotations (alt E adds to it).\r\n\r\nAlso, waters titling
    makes me feel like I do have to be famous since it's so expressive. Isn't the
    point that even anonymous people have a story to tell? Maybe you could hint at
    this with the type. A nameless, faceless, condensed, grotesque to which you add
    unexpected flair perhaps? (sounds like I got that from the Typophile Small Chat
    Generator :-)\r\n\r\nI'm wondering if the text setting can also reflect your stage
    left concept. Maybe it is coming out of the shadows. Or maybe it is left justified
    and wraps around the spine (off page left).\r\n\r\nTo sum it up either:\r\nFancy
    type hidden in the shadows\r\nor\r\nPlain type in the spotlight with unexpected
    flair.\r\nor\r\nFamous in the spotlight and the rest in shadow (would need to
    get away from stage left concept.\r\n\r\nObviously 6 ideas on one cover will not
    work ;-)\r\nI could be thinking too hard.\r\nR"

    out for . This one was just (banging head on wall). Been there?\r\n\r\nI might
    post it later, tomorrow. It's Gill Caps and Waters Titling. Like I said. Not the

    I had nicer options. You mean the type itself or the truncated sub?\r\nThey told
    me to truncate it so it would all fit larger.\r\n\r\nThe spine from last friday
    was before I knew what the thickness of the book was going to be. It went from
    an inch to approximately 5/8'ths of an inch. so, almost 50% reduction in width."

    hear from a potential customer.\r\n\r\nYeah, it's tough with narrow spines --
    I'd probably just go with the sub, actually, since it communicates more about
    the subject of the book.\r\n\r\n(That being said, what about switching them around
    to make it \"How to Write Your Life Story: You Don't Have to be Famous\"   ;-)

    life, written in a profession manner, without the intent of being published.\r\n\r\nI
    already went the photoalbum/scrapbook route, that got nixed based on the fact
    that they just discontinued their geneology line, and it look too much like it.
