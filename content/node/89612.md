  />\r\n\r\nI still have a few glyphs left and some cleanup left to do with extra
  points that I'll be working on later, then trying to find a place to put it up for
  sale(Any suggestions?). Line height(As in next line spacing) was getting wonky when
  I was playing with it in illustrator while mixing different type sizes, but it was
  fine in In-Design.- So, I am not entirely sure what's going on.\r\n\r\nIs the spacing
  between lines calculated by ascender, descender, caps height, x-height?\r\n\r\nHow
  do you exclude certain glyphs while compiling without having it add in defaults?
  \r\n\r\nStill unsure about the name yet, as well."

  body: You ought to settle on a consistent horizontal stroke weight, preferably one
    in between the extremes you've got. And that 7 is not sufficiently distinguished
    from a 1.

    doing it for me, and is inconsistent with the E and F. The wacky high waisted
    K some how works, but maybe would still have the flavor you want, and more balance,
    with the waist a little lower.  '

    to fix it.\r\nPerhaps a more square structure for /Y/ would be fitting.\r\nThe
    diagonal weights are all over the place. Make them match optically."

  body: "Updated with png previews for now. I'm trying to re-work my display specimen
    right now so it looks more visually appealing. I have about four different places
    that I am going to try submitting this one to.\r\n\r\n- Changed the lower waist
    on the H.\r\n- Changed the Y to more of a square structure. This made a big difference,
    made it feel more complete.\r\n- Reworked the X as well, more narrow and line
    weight made it feel more uniform.\r\n- Changed the diagonal weights, also another
    big improvement.\r\n- Finished metrics and kerning. (Probably could use a bit
    more fine tuning, but overall I think it's ready to submit).\r\n- Scaled down
    asterisk.\r\n- Scaled % sign down to CAP height.\r\n- I forgot to put the Yen
    symbol on this one, but I fixed the line weight on that, kept it as a normal Y
    shape.\r\n- Completed the remaining glyphs out of the default 245 glyphs. \r\n\r\nThe
    K didn't seem to work at all when I moved the waist down.- It felt disconnected
    and strange.\r\n\r\nThanks everyone for their feedback so far- It's amazing what
    small changes can really do when you put them all together."
