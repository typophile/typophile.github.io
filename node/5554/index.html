  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">I&#39;m very excited to have just received InDesign CS in the mail. I&#39;d been holding off because my principal print design these days requires me to work with someone who refuses to switch from Quark. The reason he gives is that his firm handles a lot of print work in Spanish, Chinese, Korean, and Vietnamese, and he&#39;s afraid that moving to InDesign will make his life harder. <BR> <BR>At this point, I&#39;m prepared to keep working in Quark 4.1 in Classic to accommodate him, but I&#39;m not happy about it. I&#39;m super-tired of Quark 4.1 in Classic, despite having just paid $30 for a utility that &#40;finally&#41; displays my fonts kind of the way ATR used to, though much more slowly. <BR> <BR>From now on I&#39;ll be using Indy for everything else. Buh-bye, Quark, nice knowing you, don&#39;t let the door hit you on the way out. <BR> <BR>So, those of you who know about using Indy for languages other than English, I have two questions: <BR> <BR>1. Can I convince him that switching to Indy will be relatively painless and actually improve his workflow in the long run? <BR> <BR>2. If he still refuses to switch, how easy is it to go back and forth between Quark 6 and Indy CS?</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Hi Dave, <BR> <BR>I am dubious that the switch would be relatively painless. I&#39;m not even certain that it is practical today. <BR> <BR>InDesign uses a Unicode text engine. So he&#39;d have to switch from a workflow using non-Unicode text to one using Unicode. <BR> <BR>Spanish wouldn&#39;t be a problem &#40;ID ships with Spanish dictionaries and hyphenation right out of the box&#41;. Depending on the level of typographic finesse and his need for vertical text, Chinese could require having the Japanese version of the product, and/or the third-party &#34;InChinese&#34; plug-in. Korean I&#39;m not so sure about--just my ignorance here. <BR> <BR>Vietnamese could be a real problem, since it&#39;s a &#34;complex script&#34; requiring support for some fancy shaping rules. Current versions of InDesign really don&#39;t support Vietnamese. <BR> <BR>Of course, I have no idea how well QXP works in these areas. How does he do Vietnamese in QuarkXPress, for instance? <BR> <BR>There&#39;s an article by Diane King on multilingual publishing in InDesign, that was posted by CreativePro.com. It has lots of info in this area. You could also try the InDesign mailing list on BlueWorld.com, or the InDesign user forum on Adobe.com. <BR> <BR>Hope that&#39;s of some help. <BR> <BR>Regards, <BR> <BR>T</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Very helpful, thanks -- not sure how easy it is for him to do multiple languages in QXP, but he does them fairly regularly, and it&#39;s an effective enough solution that he can generate PDFs ok &#40;the Chinese PDFs are enormous compared to the other languages&#41;, and he outputs to printers/service bureaus just fine. I&#39;ll monitor those sites to see when the water is warm enough.</div>
