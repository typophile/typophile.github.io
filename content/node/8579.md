  body: This looks hand-drawn to me. There are some irregularities to the curves,
    etc. Where is it from?

  body: It&#39;s from a calendar I picked up at Value Village &#40;a thrift store&#41;.
    The typeface doesn&#39;t appear anywhere else in the calendar. I figured it was
    custom &#40;the &#34;A&#34;s look like Futura with extended legs&#41;, but wanted
    to see if anyone recognised it as a real font. <BR> <BR> - Lex

  body: I agree with Patricia, at least to the point that I think it is customized.
    I could easily make this with <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/urw/bernhard-gothic/urw-t-light/testdrive.html?s=CALEUDAR&amp;p=48"
    target="_blank">Bernhard Gothic Light</a>, but using the O to make the C, flipping
    the U upside-down to make the N, and also flipping the E to make it high-waisted.
    I think I could slide up the A crossbar with the letter in outline form, and there
    I would have it.

    target="_blank"> ITC Avant Garde Gothic Light</a> ... The &#39;C&#39; is not  <BR>very
    well done - it&#39;s almost a spurless G.

  body: As an exercise last night, I redrew this in Illustrator. Even with my mediocre
    skills, it took about 15 minutes. And it yielded very convincing results, including
    the awkward joint at the waist of the R.
