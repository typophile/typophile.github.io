body: "Dear Typophiles,\r\n\r\nHere's my first attempt at creating an italic companion
  for my Eternal font. I have decided to make it into a nice dark type for smallish
  sizes. The roman version will need to be rebalanced with sturdier serifs and thicker
  hairlines, plus maybe one or two structural changes to fit with this new italic.
  \r\n\r\nI'm aware that certain letters are not quite working yet...and the spacing
  is a bit atrocious.\r\nThe text sample is 9 on 12pt, please ignore punctuation which
  was slanted from a very early version of the roman.\r\n\r\nI gather there is some
  optical correction needed on the slant angle for some letters and have de-slanted
  the f by 2 degrees to see...looks like g and j need a similar treatment.\r\n\r\nLooking
  forward to hearing your opinions :)"

    the relationship of inside and outside contours of c. Love the i and z. Love the
    big eye of e. \r\n\r\nIs the bottom of a's bowl more \"broken\" than similar letters?
    (Maybe just my eyes)\r\n\r\nf looks too light as it goes down - like it's trailing
    off. This strikes me as the biggest element in need of further development.\r\n\r\ny
    is a very tense shape; maybe too much, though it's exciting.\r\n\r\nt is a very
    interesting shape. I like the thickening above the crossbar, but some minor twiddling
    might still be helpful - it presently looks a bit like it tapers in as you go
    down to the crossbar, but then is discontinuously thick below the crossbar. You
    might move the node at the SW corner of the intersection a notch right, and/or
    make the curve of the left contour above the crossbar suggest that it's coming
    back leftward at its bottom. Did that make sense?\r\n\r\nVery interesting drawing
    in N. Does it get a little cloggy at the vertices?\r\n\r\nSomething's not quite
    right in G for me - Looks a big like the vertical is a nail securing the curve
    to the baseline!\r\n\r\nIs there a little Mint in the g? :-)\r\n\r\nGreat work.
    \r\n\r\nWould some autohinting passes help the pdf's?"

  body: "Haa :D Thanks Craig. It's been fun working on it. \r\nYes, f could have a
    bit more weight but I really want to keep the taper. It was inspired by Stone
    Serif italic, a typeface I love to read.\r\nI agree about y. It's quite a pointy
    scribbly shape, I may have to soften the corner or make the join less stringy.
    I want to keep it exciting! The first version was very angry looking. I think
    it needs to be thinned anyway.\r\nN, also, started out in a worse way, much cloggier
    and far too dark. I hope I can get the shape to work properly because you're right
    it's still a bit inelegant. T is a big cloggy too. Can't get that one right.\r\nI'll
    have a play with G and see if I can introduce a nice curve into the vertical section.\r\nAs
    for Mint, well, that wasn't intentional. I guess you're meaning the bottom curve?
    I'm not quite sure whether I'm sticking to those shapes for the g and j.\r\nI'm
    not finding S and s very successful right now.\r\nHinting? Does that get embedded
    into a pdf? \r\nThanks for your kind encouragement :)"

    don't know very much about italics. So my critique is based on what I see, not
    so much on what I know. \r\n\r\nI've also deliberately not read Craig's critique
    (nor your answer), so I might repeat things. \r\n\r\nAB: Good shapes. I would
    make the cutoff om the crossbars of more similar. Now they are cut off at very
    different angles. Perhaps they should be cut off the other way, matching the K?
    I'd try that.\r\n\r\nC: Slightly to thick at NW? Compare to the G.\r\n\r\nD: A
    little bottom heavy? Raise the curve a bit? SW corner a little boring?\r\n\r\nEF:

    Slightly too wide?\r\n\r\nM: I think the Vertex needs to go to the right, and

    a little stiff, perhaps a little too upright?\r\n\r\nOQ: Beautiful! \r\n\r\nPR:
    I'd fiddle a little more with their cutoffs, and perhaps raise the R leg a bit,

    thin?\r\n\r\nZ: Make the diagonal slightly more diagonal, and strengthen the top
    stroke?\r\n\r\na: Stem a little to curved?\r\n\r\nc: A little to narrow?\r\n\r\nf:
    To thin stem and descender. Can take a lot more weight. \r\n\r\ng: Beautiful in

    Right stem too upright? n too wide?\r\n\r\nk: Slightly strange curve at top of
    leg, otherwise fab.\r\n\r\nopqrstvz: All beauties. I love the t (though I'd look
    closely at the top of it a little confusion there now), and the q is really delicious,
    too. \r\n\r\nu: se comments on hmn, but in reverse and upside down. \r\n \r\nw:

    left the original Eternal in there, as a display cut, so you can see the difference.
    Strokes are heavier, serifs more robust, traps more pronounced, wider spacing
    and some more calligraphic melodies. I think it still needs more of this and will
    play with it some more. Some glyphs need more darkness to go with the italic better.\r\n\r\nNot
    sure how successful Eternal is as a text face...perhaps what I've got is a Subhead
    cut to go with the Display one? Oh, and I know the spacing is atrocious :)"

  body: "Ben :-) I'm glad you took this up again! It's getting quite nice I think.
    \r\nI don't have time to critique, but I never do, so what the hell. Another salt
    mine please!\r\n\r\nFirst, I think the changes to make the \"text\" cut are quite
    beneficial, especially the darker color; it looks less fragile on the page. \r\nThat
    said, I'm not quite sure about the contrast in some glyphs; the arches (\"n\",
    \"m\", \"h\" and such) seem to have less contrast than the stick-and-bowls. Might
    the heaviest parts of \"o\", \"p\", \"q\" (maybe also \"b\" and \"d\") be a hint
    too dark? In text they seem to be a bit spotty; but that might also just be my
    printer.\r\n\r\nThere's something slightly strange about the vertical metrics.
    The ascenders seem shorter than the descenders (especially in the italics, but
    in the text weight as well), which makes me suspect they're the same mathematically?
    Dunno, I might make the ascenders a bit taller, depending on your target size.\r\n\r\nSome
    notes on the (roman) text cut:\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>I like the \"e\" a lot!\r\n<li>Is
    \"c\" backslanting a little?\r\n<li>\"k\" has a nice and rather Dutch feel. In
    text, its lower counter feels small.\r\n<li>\"r\" looks wider than before? That's
    probably a good thing. I like the strong beak.\r\n<li>\"s\" seems a bit narrow.\r\n<li>I'm
    not sure about the slant of \"t\"'s crossbar. Why did you do that? \u2013 Oh,
    now I see the \"f\" has that too. Not sure. It looks a bit like it doesn't really
    want to be standing on the baseline.\r\n<li>\"y\" seems too wide in text.\r\n<li>\"z\"
    is a bit soft maybe.\r\n<li>\"M\": I agree that its second counter is too big,
    but I thought it's because of that \"special\" terminal on the right \u2013 maybe
    try pulling that in a little?\r\n<li>\"Q\" is delicious!\r\n<li>I like the low-waisted
    \"R\" too.\r\n<li>Crossbars of \"E\", \"F\", and \"H\" look thin compared to \"L\"
    / \"T\" / \"Z\" (and the \"A\" is somewhere in between?)\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\nThe italic
    is very nice. I think you've succeeded quite well in making an italic that keeps
    the basic characteristics of the roman but still differentiates enough. \r\nI
    like the color of the italic a *lot* in the \"italic-only\" paragraph. It actually
    seems a bit darker still than the roman?\r\nItalics:\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>The eye of
    the \"e\" seems a bit huge. Very soft too.\r\n<li>There's something bugging me
    about the \"g\". I think its angle might still need some optical compensation
    for the fact that its decender is also pulling in that direction. Also maybe the
    bowl is too \"deflated\"? It doesn't seem to share the elegant springiness and
    flowiness that especially the \"d\", \"p\", and \"q\" have.\r\n<li>\"b\" also
    seems to depart from the other ball-and-stick letters. And something is uncomfortable
    about the top join. It looks like it wanted to be open and was reluctantly closed\u2026
    ;-)\r\n<li>\"j\" looks more slanted than \"i\" to my eye. Probably a function
    of the pull of the descender.\r\n<li>The \"k\" still has a Dutch feel, and what
    you do with the white space in the top counter is wonderful \u2013 I love it!
    Actually maybe the top counter could be a hair wider, seeing how strongly the
    terminal pulls \"back\" (left)?\r\n<li>I love the \"q\"!\r\n<li>Is there some
    Mint in the bottom terminal of the \"s\"?\r\n<li>vwxyz are delicious. In text,
    the \"y\" seems almost surprisingly springy/tight. Maybe the \"g\" should follow
    suit \u2013 it seems a bit plump next to the \"y\" maybe.\r\n<li>I like the angular
    flick of \"A\"'s terminal a lot. Have you tried that on other glyphs too, like
    maybe the \"R\"?\r\n<li>\"G\" is pretty fat in the SW corner.\r\n<li>The apex
    of \"W\" seems dark. Actually \"W\" looks dark altogether, in text.\r\n<li>\"Y\"
    is delicious!\r\n<li>Maybe \"Z\" could be wilder / more determined / more special?
    It seems pretty, in a bit of a quaint way.\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\nVery nice work Ben.
    I'm looking forward to seeing this grow even more."

    complexity. In the \"A\" there is the slant of the crossbar, its shear on the

    an irregular/angled whitespace in the gap to the stem, plus there's the 2 different
    feet and the serif on the head, and various amounts of bracketing/curviness etc.
    \r\nSo there's a *lot* of interesting/special details, and altogether the glyph

    leg in my eyes, threatening to make the big bowl (which I love) cartoonish. \r\nI
    don't think there's any problem with differing angles in the middle of K and R.
    In both cases the shear is perpendicular to the stroke when it changes direction,
    which seems perfectly natural. A's crossbar does seem more arbitrary :-(  \r\nGenerally,
    I think the green-spotted terminals look pretty good as-is; bottom of X and top
    of N might be the best candidates for reworking. I agree that top of Z is too
    soft.\r\n\r\nI confess to being a little confused about what I was looking at
    in the pdf - are the text settings with the larger roman text in the \"display\"
    cut?\r\nYour counters in the roman 'm' have uneven widths - second one is much
    narrower. I imagine the different serif treatment asked for not precisely congruent
    shapes, but I think the difference is here quite too large (and might be really
    problematic at low resolutions). \r\nRoman 'w' could stand some attention, I think.
    That last serif is not harmonized with the rest of the glyph.\r\nItalic ligs:
    black spot at the collision of the 'f' and 'l' in 'fl'; can you bring some of
    that weight over into the hood of 'f'? And 'Th' components may be too close to
    each other, though perhaps postpone that until you're more sure of your spacing
    settings generally.\r\n\r\n's' may be too narrow in both roman and italic."
