  to use Lane-Narrow which I believe was designed by Graham Meade. Unfortunately,
  one of the key symbols for me is missing from the extended character list - the
  Great Britain Pound (GBP \xA3) symbol is unavailable and I really don't want to
  use a separate font for that one character. Does anybody know if there is a more
  recent version of this font available including the GBP symbol - I've searched all
  over the internet with no success.\r\n\r\nIf not, does anybody know how I can get
  in touch with the font designer to request the addition of this symbol?\r\n\r\nMany
  thanks,\r\nMatthew James"
