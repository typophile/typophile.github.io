  point sizes I always like to pull the tracking in as it looks much tighter (at least
  on headlines in print publications).\r\n\r\nHowever - in the UK - all signage needs
  to be brought in line with new legislation that makes environmental design more
  accessible for the visually impaired. This means that the recommendation from the
  relevant bodies is to increase line spacing and tracking where possible. I have
  seen many signage systems that don't conform to this, which in my view look better
  (but then I'm not visually impaired).\r\n\r\nI'd be grateful to hear anyone's thoughts
  on the matter."

    the same people who put recorded voices in the elevators (lifts) of parking garages,
    to let visually impaired drivers know which floor they're on. Who are now proposing
    the visual equivalent of everybody being shouted at all the time, for the benefit
    of an impaired minority.\r\n\r\nBut seriously, I think that this problem is being
    tackled the wrong way. \r\nRather than have bureaucratically-imposed physical
    standards, there should be a professional standard requiring licensed environmental
    designers. That would give some professional respect, and leeway for intelligent
    interpretation, with the onus on the professional licensing body to maintain standards,
    not a government bureaucracy.\r\n\r\nAnd it would mean that the professional would
    have to study and understand the issue in depth, rather than just follow ugly
    guidelines verbatim."

  body: '"Look Better" may be diametrically opposed to "more legible", since "Looks
    better" is so subjective. Designers always see things in detail. The standard
    you are referring to considers that generally, from a distance, signage is much
    more legible when contrast is high, letterforms are robust and clear, and line
    and letter spacing is generous. These criteria are the result of testing by viewers
    of various ages, from various functional distances. '

  body: "You should make your signs at the size they will be used. Create different
    versions with different letterspacing options. Put them on a wall and walk back
    and take a look. All design should be evaluated in its proper context. Making
    a decision on some assumption will most likely be the wrong decision. \r\n\r\nMost
    regulations cover letter height and stroke width but rarely consider letterspace.
    When we were doing the Clearview research, we were amazed how much letterspacing
    mattered."

  body: "Hello there,\r\n\r\nwhich legislation is this? I'm curious because I'm also
    working on a signage project in the uk.\r\n\r\nI'd say it's difficult to have
    hard and fast rules, particularly about spacing. They never quite meet the case
    at hand. Every design problem needs to be thought through proplerly on a case
    by case basis. For example, the size of a lot of the signs I work on is dictated
    by the height of the ceiling (signs can't hang too low). This puts a limit on
    vertical (line) spacing. This in turn effects word- and letterspacing. At the
    same time, the type has to be a certain size to be read from (and be credible
    from) a certain distance. The overall effect of large, tight(ish) text is that
    the typography is quite dense, but because of limits imposed by architecture rather
    than typography. \r\n\r\nSo, I suppose I'm saying, look at the limits imposed
    by the job itself first, before trying to deal with more (usually quite arbitrary)
    externally imposed limits.\r\n\r\nSome practical thoughts: is your signage illuminated?
    Is it dark text on light, or light on dark? How much space do you have?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    even when they make no sense. If the standard says that elevators should have
    a voice prompt, that is implemented even when it is absurd, eg in a parking garage
    where the visually impaired would never be in an elevator by themselves.\r\n\r\n<em>\u201CLooks
    better\u201D is so subjective.</em>\r\n\r\nNo more so than \"reads better\".\r\nIt
    all depends on who's doing the reading.\r\nType spec'd for the visually impaired

  body: "A few years ago, they added a second set of elevator buttons at about 2 and
    a half feet off the floor in each elevator in our building. This was so that people
    in wheel chairs could read and press the buttons more easily.  A few years later,
    the removed the higher set of buttons meant for everyone else in the human race.
    (I assume there must have either been a cost or malfunction issue with having
    2 sets). I have 2 bad knees which makes bending painful for me so now I can't
    see the buttons down there at thigh level. I am only 62 but there are plenty more
    folks older than I am who have even more trouble with the subterranean buttons.
    I wonder what blind people do trying to figure out where the bloody buttons are?
    \r\nMy point is, there are ADA laws requiring button placement for the wheelchair
    population but none for the so called \"normal\" user.  Since you can't get sued
    or fined for taking the needs of the majority population to heart, they are just
    ignored. \r\nI am very much in favor of access for the handicapped but I am also
    in favor of access for everyone else too! Somewhere trained professionals need
    to be allowed to figure out the best way to deal with all of this because the
    politicians sure will screw it up if left to their own devices.\r\n\r\nChrisL"

    where are you getting this? Are you saying that Clearview is hampering the comprehension

    drivers, I believe, and drivers have to pass an eye test, so are not visually
    impaired.\r\n\r\nMy local council in Norwich put out a magazine for taxpayers,
    with text set in 14 pt sans serif, to make it more accessible for those with poor
    vision. Not much of a read for the rest of us, however. \r\n"

  body: Thanks for the replies. In answer to typofoto - I got the info from the book
    'Sign Design Guide' by Peter Barker and June Fraser. There's some info in there
    relating to the Disability Discrimination Act 1995. Glad to see there's no hard
    and fast rules, so I will interpret them liberally!
