body: "I've been reading about the history of modern European Latin letterforms, working
  from the assumption that the modern alphabet is actually a combination in practice
  of Roman capitals, Carolingian miniscule, and italic cursives, corresponding to
  our present-day uppercase, lowercase, and italics.\r\n\r\nI've found good sources
  on the history of Roman letterforms (e.g., Gray's <em>History of lettering</em>)
  and on the history of italics (e.g., Morison's <em>Early italian writing books</em>
  and Atkins's <em>Masters of the italic letter</em>), but does anyone have recommendations
  for the precursors of the lower case Latin forms?"

    There\u2019s probably also information scattered around in the European chapters
    of Mason\u2019s <em>The History of the Art of Writing</em>, but given what a copy
    costs, skim around at a library first."
