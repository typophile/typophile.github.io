body: "Hi there,\r\n\r\nI'm trying to find a good type pair to go with Acta Display(as
  the headline font): http://dstype.com/typeface/acta \r\nfor my personal portfolio
  website. It's a high contrast typeface. I'm using Typekit so would prefer a recommendation
  from their type library. I'm open to either a sans or serif. My current considerations
  are 'Leitura News' or 'Futura'. \r\n\r\nMy site will show primarily web design work
  and a small amount of print plus blog posts. \r\n\r\nAny help would be appreciated.\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\nBD"
