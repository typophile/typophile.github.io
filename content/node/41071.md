    but, I would go with end of the line so you don't have the distracting space at
    the left side.\r\n\r\nThis may just be style rather than a rule."

  body: I would never place an em dash (or any other type of dash) at the beginning
    of a new line, and I've heard the same opinion from other people at different
    places where I've worked.

  body: "Since in many ways a dash functions like a parenthesis, to signal a thought
    related to, but not essential to the main sentence, does this mean that you also
    would not start a line with a parenthetical comment?\r\n\r\nThe way we use to
    handle this with TeX was to put in a whopping penalty  for breaking a line immediately
    before a dash, and a small penalty for breaking after the dash -- as you may know,
    TeX uses a paragraph optimization routine which is programmable. So, if a line
    broke before the dash -- it started a new line -- we were pretty sure that any
    other decision would involve a huge compromise.\r\n\r\nTo James: if making a line
    is the only way out of your pagination problem, and that's the only place you
    can make a line, go ahead & break after the dash.\r\n\r\nWhich isn't to say somebody
    won't criticize it. One of my favorite stories was where an editor marked our
    proof \"P.E. -- hyphenated last word,\" and \"P.E. -- loose line.\" I assure you,
    the last word in the paragraph we hyphenated was quite long; over six letters
    went down. Now, did the editor think that line above was going to set any tighter
    if we took down more letters (didn't hyphenate)? Oh, and did I mention there were
    only two lines in that paragraph?\r\n\r\nWhat we wound up doing was to take down
    the entire word, which meant using about an em-space between words in that first
    line. We also disallowed the PE, & made them take is as an Editor's Alteration."

  body: The dash might follow along with hyphenation break rules where the parenthesis
    might follow the exception as quotation marks. You've got to have some room for
    common sense (whatever that is) because multi-column narrow measure editorial
    won't ever work like a nice single column book page.

  body: "I like Bruce's explanation in the thread Florian has linked to:\r\n\r\n<em>I
    have always gone by the notion that written words are a way of capturing speech
    and making it live again in the brain of the reader. If the dash is supposed to
    convey a sense of pause, then it seems to me to be more effective at the end of
    the first line. This way the reader encounters the pause indicator, then takes
    a brief moment to move back over to the next line, and the elapsed time is slightly
    longer. Encountering it at the beginning of the next line comes as more of a surprise.
    Therefore, in my style book the dash is always best located at the end of the
    first line, but if spacing conditions make that ungraceful or impratical, then
    it goes at the beginning of the next line. The tiniest of subtleties, this, but
    fun to think about!</em>\r\n\r\nQuite articulate, that Bruce."

  body: In Finnish there's a lot of hyphens, so common style is to move dash to the
    next line to avoid confusion. Especially when there are plenty of people who use
    hyphen instead of dash.

  body: "Yes, there are two functions for dashes (many marks have more than one function,
    for instance the apostrophe and single right quote  are the same character).\r\n\r\nSo,
    if the dash is part of a pair of dashes, used similarly to parentheses or commas,
    then don't put it at the beginning of a line, but if it is single \"lead-in\",
    then you may."

  body: "I have many opinions -- though I am often wrong.\r\n\r\nI have many opinions
    (though I am often wrong).\r\n\r\nUsing parentheses means perforce that you use
    2. You use two dashes only when the sentence continues after the \"parenthetical\"
    remark.\r\n\r\nThe usual \"rule\" against beginning a line with a dash is not
    a grammatical one, but typographic: the dash seems to weaken the text edge. What
    is so often forgotten is that line-breaking almost always involves a series of
    typographic compromises. If you want to use em-spaces to justify a line in order
    to avoid beginning a line with a dash, that's your business. Just remember that
    ironclad rules also have consequences."

  body: 'This is one reason to use shorter (perhaps 3/4) em dashes flanked with some
    amount of space. In the middle of a measure, it might ultimately occupy the same
    length as an unspaced, full em dash, but when it falls at the end of a line, the
    right flanking space can be removed, giving you a shorter irreducible unit. Might
    not help much, but it''s something. '

  body: "<cite>I am not a fan of hyphenation within text so try to avoid it where
    possible.</cite>\r\n\r\nAside from getting the right characters (and it's all
    on disk nowadays, nobody keys anymore), good typesetting is all a matter of compromises.
    Compromising is rarely served by a hierarchy of rules.\r\n\r\nSo. If you are setting
    justified copy, you have two main tools for justification. One is to simply vary
    the word space. The other is to rewrite the copy for a better fit. But if you're
    a typesetter rather than an author, you cannot rewrite copy -- Ah, but in effect,
    that's what hyphenation does -- makes two shorter words where there use to be
    one long one.\r\n\r\nIf you don't hyphenate, you're going to have lines with a
    lot of word space variation. Some of them will be quite loose, some quite tight.
    Yes, with some layout programs, you can also letterspace or scale glyphs. I am
    not a fan of either if it shows, and it doesn't take much to show.\r\n\r\nBTW,
    setting ragged just moves the variance of word spacing to the amount of raggedness
    on the right margin.\r\n\r\nAs for the 3/4 em dash on an em body, you have to
    draw it up. See <strong>dashes</strong>\r\n\r\nhttp://www.press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/chicago/G/bo3640659.html\r\n\r\nBTW,
    please get the ebook -- I get some royalties for that, nothing for the print edition. "
