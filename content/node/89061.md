  body: "Before you invest in any kerning make sure you get the balance and the curves
    right! Look how the horizontal parts of c are thicker than the round part (same
    goes for a which is only copied from the c \u2013\_or vice versa, and e and f,
    and so on \u2026\r\nExamine how the stroke is leaving the stem of b: much too
    thick! There are also big breaks where a curve is ending into a horizontal. There
    is no smoothness. The endings of c and e will turn out to be much too long when
    preceding other characters.\r\nAbove all this is way too constructed. Study typefaces
    like Bauhaus, for instance, which have similar design principles and see how they
    work."

  body: "@J Weltin\r\nI just threw in a couple kerning classes to test the look and
    feel of the font. Concerning the varying thickness of the curved and the horizontal
    parts you are completely right, i'll be working on it. The smoothness of the curves
    hitting the straights is meant to be this way, it's a part of the font's identity.
    I needed a second opinion on the c and e and thanks to you they'll be back on
    the chopping board. I don't get what you mean by too constructed, but sure i'll
    take a look at Bauhaus considering that i am still a newbie. Thank you very much
    for your time!\r\n\r\n@hrant\r\nI actually thought of it and made ( \u0633 ) and
    a ( \u0648 ) inspired from the lowercase g you see above and i think it has a
    lot of potential. Do you have any experience with arabic type? i would really
    appreciate a little help."

  body: "I've made some Arabic type, but only imitative stuff, nothing\r\noriginal
    enough that I could guide you too much. The reason\r\nI brought it up is because
    to me your Latin forms seem to be\r\nbegging for an Arabic companion :-) and with
    your background\r\nyou can pull it off (since I believe that \"nativity\" is one
    of the\r\nrequirements of making a \"progressive\" font in a script).\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    road.\r\nAnd yes i see what u mean there it looks totally forced to have the same
    characteristics. Great Flickr u got there i can sure benefit of it. Thank you
    for your concern!"
