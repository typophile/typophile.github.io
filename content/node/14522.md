  on-screen graphics on tv shows like the Tonight Show, Ellen, The Today Show, etc.
  These programs make a fortune (yesterday's New York Times reported that the Today
  show alone rakes in $180 million per year, or something like that, making it the
  most profitable show on tv) but their typography looks like something from a high-school
  newspaper. The opening sequences are usually okay (although the Tonight Show is
  pretty bad) but any additional type they have to denote segments, highlight contests,
  etc. looks completely amateurish. I was wondering if this was always the case --
  this format of show has been around since the 1960s or earlier. Does anyone have
  any thoughts or has anyone seen anything written about this?\r\n\r\n(I saw a rerun
  of a \"What's My Line\" show from the early 1960s on Nickelodeon and the title design
  was brilliant... reminiscent of Saul Bass's film-title designs from the same era.
  It's animated in black & white.) "

    flying text effects was deliberate, and totally In line with the ridiculous sets
    and misfit bands used by Mr Letterman and co. Seems in keeping with the self-deprecating
    humor of the hosts \u2013 self-deprecating typography if you like.  \r\n\r\nSi "

    checkout line of a grocery store should give you a pretty strong clue as to what
    inspires this particular kind of typography. Tabloid headlines like "Boy Trapped
    in Refrigerator Eats Own Foot" really don't lend themselves to elegant typographic
    treatment...

    elegant, but it can still be appropriate = good typography. Like the Globe cover
    I spied the other day: a title about the \"murder\" of that Aruba chick, set it...
    Amplitude! The font's severe traps being nicely evocative of physical violence.
    A rare case then of the typography being much more sophisticated than the content.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: Amplitude is indeed an excellent choice for a story on violence (to me, it
    always looked like a typeface that had been put through a meat grinder, then reassembled),
    but good typography in tabloids is still more the exception than the rule.
