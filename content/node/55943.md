body: I'm working on an independent project that is a catalog of friends. The type
  of catalog meant for buying products. I think I came up with the idea for it as
  a way to vent. I don't like talking about feelings and this is my way of working
  through my frustrations about my so-called friends. One day I was thinking about
  it and I started doodling. I came up with a few words for my "friends". Like I said,
  I was having a bad day.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/typ_5076.jpg][img:sites/default/files/old-images/typ_a_4835.jpg]
