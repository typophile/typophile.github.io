body: I have been trying to identify this glyphic display typeface for years. I believe
  it is a venerable and well-used type - I might have seen it used in a decades-old
  National Geographic. Nonetheless I haven't been able to pin it down. It may be a
  condensed type. Note the 'bowtie' crossbar on the capital 'T'.  It's not Albertus,
  not Baker Signet, not Fritz Quadrata. The example here is taken from current sponsor
  credits for a PBS program. Help, Help.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/mysteryglyphic_6347.png]

  body: Yes, you're absolutely right. Thank you. I see that this is, indeed, Strayhorn.
    It turns out that I have mis-conflated Strayhorn with the vintage typeface I was
    originally searching for (and at that time ruled out Strayhorn). The one I saw
    in National Geographic resembled Carol Twombly's Lithos a little, the caps in
    Pompeia a little, except more regular (not Pericles and had nothing like the irregularities
    of Heraculeum), and the bow-tie crossbar on the capital 'T' had vertical rather
    than canted ends. Looks like it's back to the drawing board.
