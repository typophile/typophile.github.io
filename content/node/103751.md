  body: "I don't know if it's based on a font, more probably a custom logo work. It
    looks too much modified/customized to me. The only letter that could be original
    is probably /A. You just need to spot a good Egyptian/geometric slab serif ([[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/insigne/sommet-slab|Sommet
    Slab]]... and play with it. My choice would probably be to start with a Sans and
    add slab serifs, something from [[http://www.myfonts.com/foundry/Type-Together|Type-Together]]
    such as [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/type-together/soleil|Soleil]], [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/type-together/karmina-sans|Karmina
    Sans]] or [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/type-together/etica|Etica]].\r\nFor the
    rest, as \"Worldline\" baseline is set in [[http://vllg.com/Schwartzco/Stag|Stag]],
    you could even start with this one. "

    body: Yes the Atos is definitely custom and modification on a font or probably
      combination of up to 4 fonts. But just in case anyone is familiar with them.
      Yes, what you suggested helped. I'll start with those and thanks for the Stag
      recommendation, I'd get them too.
