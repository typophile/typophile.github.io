  body: "A excerpt from our concept presentation:\r\n\r\n<em>... This concept is an
    intriguing play on the acronym WCC. This is the boldest statement of the four
    (concepts), immediately evoking the Bauhaus aesthetic quite often associated with
    large corporations. Primary messaging is sophisticated and strong, establishing
    sound business practice above all else. The rounded corners on the bounding box
    help soften the impact slightly, and provide an ergonomic, humanistic quality
    that eases user interaction. The emphasis on the \u2018W\u2019 evokes/reinforces
    \u2018winning.\u2019 ...</em>\r\n\r\nWCC is a sports forecasting/handicapping
    company. The two founding officers are sports experts. They appear regularly on
    ESPN, as commentators and sports (mailing western coast college conference) forecasters.\r\n\r\nOne
    of the major brand touch points will actually be athletic wear, and mid range
    apparel -- think nice trendy polos, not t-shirts. There is going to be a big guerilla
    marketing push with the apparel. We are taking some rather un-conventional approaches
    to marketing within a market that is quite staunch and sterile. The majority of
    the competitors are quite 'old fashioned' and extremely unimaginative.\r\n\r\nA
    major criterion for success was the ability to become a quazi-fashion label. Something
    people would enjoy wearing. A mark that would be able to facilitate a trend, yet
    remain timeless.\r\n\r\nThe applications will be fairly broad. One of the most
    interesting touch points is the apparel. One of the more difficult touch points
    is the radio.\r\n"

    conscious of people with addictions, and wont work with people they feel have

    cars, posters, business cards, etc.  But I can't say how suitable it is since
    I don't know anything about the industry, or what kind of image their competitors
    have.\r\n\r\nThe only thing that bothers me is the name, and you had nothing to
    do with that.  When I hear it, I think of the West Coast Choppers... and now that
    I know what 'cappers are, I get this image in my head that they're a tough gang
    that collect gambling debts, and if the clients don't have the money, they'll
    \"handicap\" them by breaking some bones. :)"

    about stencils.  But once you notice it you can't stop seeing it.  Just like the

    the subliminal concept of winning.\r\n\r\nIf we were attempting to create a monogram

    further step down to hell.\r\nI question that your mark qualifies as a genuine
    subliminal communique, I don't really see the winning concept (which I suppose
    is to be expected if it were subliminal, but I would have expected to be able
    to discern some hint of design shorthand to indicate its presence).\r\nTim"

    the arrow might be gone before enough people see it!\r\n\r\nMy main point is,
    if you have a good idea like that, why not make it (gently) more explicit, and
    gain the positive effects immediately? I think there's only one reason on the
    ground: it goes against the current graphic design culture of appearing sophisticated
    to other graphic designers (which sucks). In contrast, below is a logo that I
    saw last weekend; it put a smile on my face, and made a strong impression in my
    mind, even though I'm \"aware\" of graphic design (but I'm not jaded by it).\r\n\r\nhttp://themicrofoundry.com/other/ufish.jpg\r\n\r\nSure,
    I'd definitely get rid of the waves, and possibly the splash drops too, but essentially
    I believe it's the type of thing that <strong>works</strong>, no matter how much
    most graphic designers in black turtlenecks would snort at it.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    reaction effect immediately by definition. This is what I meant by the dimension
    of time. The point of it is that you have one reaction at your first viewing and
    yet another reaction at some later viewing. This one, two punch acts synergistically
    to aid retention.  It also can prompt discussion between viewers who otherwise
    would just have gone by after the first viewing. There is a lot of work involved
    in getting it right.  It has nothing to do with art--it is by design.\r\n\r\nChrisL"

    I don't think laymen ever get that second reaction in the case of the FedEx logo
    - unless maybe if they a graphic designer as a close friend. I'm not saying the
    arrow should have a neon sign delineating it; but it should have been made to
    become visible to the layman eventually. Art vs Craft: if a graphic designer is
    more concerned with expressing his self/talents/skills, he becomes closer to Art

    not, I probably would have picked a different W closer in style to the C's. Still
    emphasized, yes, but with just enough of the rounded-square aesthetic in it that
    the C's are recognized as potential letterforms."

  body: Well, I can't say it's the solution I would have chosen, but when I look at
    a FedEx truck, even knowing the arrow is there, the near-invisibility of it divorces
    it from the wider context. I see "letters and arrow" on one level of focus, and
    "truck and letters" on another, but I don't see "truck and arrow" as a relationship
    the way I might otherwise. It's like the difference between a big map painted
    on the floor and a paper map opened in front of me on the table. In the first
    case, it would bother me if north were not truly pointed north; in the other case,
    it would not, because there is no strongly implied relationship to its surroundings
    as context.
