  body: 'I believe that is Pump, designed by Phillip Kelly, part of the ITC library.
    &#40;$39.95&#41; <BR> <BR>The ITC site reads as follows: <BR>Designed in the Letraset
    Type Studio in response to the renewed interest in the simple, geometric, sans
    serif Bauhaus style from earlier in this century. Pump has endured over twenty
    years and remains one of the best typefaces of this style in use today. For maximum
    effect, Pump should be set closely. <BR> <BR><A HREF="http://www.itcfonts.com/itc/fonts/detail.asp?sku=ITC2292"

  body: Hmm. I also found a listing for the same font, sold through URW&#43;&#43;
    &#40;<A HREF="http://www.urwpp.de" TARGET="_top">http://www.urwpp.de</A>&#41;.
    It says it&#39;s designed by Bob Newman and sells for $49 per weight. I couldn&#39;t
    find a family price.

    <BR> <BR>Elsner &#43; Flake sells a 5 weight family  <BR>including a way cool

    is  <BR>down as I write this. Eyewire.com doesn&#39;t show  <BR>the E&#43;F Pump.
