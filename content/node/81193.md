    makes me thinking to a [[http://www.typography.com/fonts/font_overview.php?productLineID=100013|Knockout]]
    (no50 Welterweight) tweaked (adding spurs to /A and /M like /R) but the /M is
    off... May be a mix of Knockout for the /R and the rest (/O, /A and /M) sets in
    [[http://new.myfonts.com/search/din/fonts/|DIN]], manually spured \"a la knockout\"...\r\n\"ARTISAN/BURGERS/SODAS\":
    [[http://www.typography.com/fonts/font_overview.php?productLineID=100036|Vitesse]]
    (as this one is also from Hoefler & Frere Jones and designers are well-known to
    be lazy and pair fonts from the same foundry, that could give credit to the Knockout
    track for \"ROAM\" (at least for the /R))"

  body: I wouldn't call it laziness. Designers have a certain sensibility that comes
    through in their work, and so, their typefaces often work well together. Definitely
    the case with H&FJ.
