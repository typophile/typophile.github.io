  body: If you could offer members discounts on software, supplies, insurance, etc.,
    you might find some takers. However, if the purpose is to have some uniform standards
    of professional practice and pricing, you will always have to contend with the
    zit-faced kid with a few pieces of "creative" software in his parents' basement--or
    even a professional in a lower-cost-of-living country--underbidding you...

  body: Don't professional organizations like AIGA and all of the international groups
    offer this sort of thing? A union per se conjures up a bargaining position which
    would certainly be impractical.  Then there would be the certification fiasco
    to endure.  It just seems too far from reality.  Collusion on price fixing is
    not legal at least in the USA. What would a member get that would more than compensate
    for the dues?

    and some professional organizations are not bound by the same antitrust rules
    that businesses and individuals are. This is why, for example, the Graphic Artists
    Guild can do a survey of hourly rates for design services and publish it.\r\n\r\nI
    can\u2019t see how AIGA can even compare to a real union. For starters, how many
    unions not only demand membership dues but then also demand more money every time
    you want to show up at a meeting?"

    talk off and on throughout the history on doing something akin to what the AIA

    exactly thriving these days, so maybe that's a bad idea too. \r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: With the way that being a designer works, I'm not sure how you would get a
    union running. I think having one around is a good idea though because it can
    help give some leverage to the workers when dealing with bosses, but other than
    that...

  body: "> it can help give some leverage to the workers \r\n\r\nUnions are generally
    most effective in occupations where employers hire a large workforce of union
    members -- places like factories, hospitals, schools, etc.  Employers know that
    if the union goes on strike they'll lose a large workforce that may be difficult
    to replace.\r\n\r\nThere aren't many companies that have a huge staff of graphic
    designers. If a company has two graphic designers on staff, the threat of a strike
    won't mean much. If they go on strike they'll just be replaced.\r\n\r\nAlso unions
    generally specify wages, which may be easy to do in a factory where you're paid
    by the hour, or a school where you get a yearly salary, but many (perhaps most)
    designers are self-employed and price each job individually based on a variety
    of factors.\r\n\r\nI just don't see a union happening."

  body: "At one point a while back I had a concept to start a font foundry with a
    union theme but after running it past a few midwesterners, the idea was quickly
    dismissed. Unions aren't a creative theme to hang a hat on, they are very serious
    business here in the midwest and still very much active.\r\n\r\nI agree fully
    with James that there isn't really any advantage to unionizing the font industry
    because we're all independent contractors as it were not unified under any single
    organization that we work for or service . . ."
