body: "Need to know if anyone has experience importing XML into indesign CS 2. I'm
  getting an error.\r\n\r\nI exported an InDesign Tagged Text, opened in BBEdit, did
  a GREP pattern Find/Replace, changing nothing else, and when I try to import it,
  this error appears.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/hatchxml_6678.png]\r\n\r\nEither
  this works, or I have to manually insert tabs at the beginning of almost 300 pages
  worth of numbered lists.\r\n\r\nThanks\r\n\r\nEDIT: IT is not xml, my bad, it's
  InDesign Tagged Text."

  body: "I recently had similar problems, and my solution was not to use Indesign
    (which makes my comment rather useless for you, I guess). Now I use a homegrown
    and probably more complicated workflow: XML with a simple DTD > XSLT > LaTeX.
    Takes more time to convert things, but at least I am now able to use it the way
    I want\u2026\r\n\r\nBack to topic: What exactly did you change in BBEdit? Might
    the cause of your problem also be an encoding issue or error in your grep replace
    pattern? "

  body: Ok, i was just on the adobe site, and someone said InDesign Tagged Text IS
    NOT XML. SO. I messed up. It's not xml. Sorry. He said I have to place it and
    not import it, but that gives me different problems.
