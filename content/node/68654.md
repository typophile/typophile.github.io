  body: "Thanks. I do understand that this cover predates computer-based design, but
    I'm curious if someone else has developed a font simiar to this, or seeing if
    someone used it as a basis for one. I did discover that the \"powered by\" lettering
    looks to be a heavily slanted Haettenschweiler font. The \"Ford\" lettering is
    stumping me a bit, but with all the published fonts out there, I'm only looking
    for one that is close.\r\n\r\n"
