  FAP 4 for Windows.\r\n\r\nI've just installed the RC1 and all went smoothly. EXCEPT
  now, while correctly listing all my fonts in their various Libraries and Sets, FontAgent
  Pro shows them ALL as being INactive.\r\n\r\nI'm guessing I did not follow some
  correct order of steps during the install.\r\n\r\nAny aid here?\r\n\r\nJim\r\n\r\nPS
  - I had this posted over in \"Build\" but no one had anything to say."

  body: You should probably check with the developers considering it's a Beta software
    - i.e. a lot of us won't be using it on our computers due to the possible unstable
    nature of the software.
