  reading a story about Akira Kobayashi last night in HOW magazine, I was interested
  in his Clifford set but don't understand the difference between Clifford Roman,
  Clifford Six Roman, Clifford Eighteen Roman, Clifford Nine Roman and so on. What
  do these numbers mean? I've seen it before in Trade Gothic with Trade Gothic Eighteen
  and Trade Gothic Twenty but never really understood the purpose of those numbers.\r\n\r\nI
  thought if I'm going to find out any where it would be here on Typophile.\r\n\r\nThanks
  for any help!"

    you can think of them more as guidelines not hard and fast rules. After all Joshua
    Darden designed his <a href=\"http://www.joshuadarden.com/shop/freightmicro.php\">Freight
    Micro</a> to be used at smaller sizes and then <a href=\"http://www.joshuadarden.com/custom/behind_wmagazine.php\">W
    magazine</a> used it for display work. (After being customized.)\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Numbering like this can have different meanings. As has already been pointed
    out, the numbers in Clifford indicate target sizes for which the design is optimized.\r\n\r\nExamples
    of other designs that utilize this type of designation include \r\n\r\nPaperback
    Text 6, 8, and 12; Paperback Display 24, 28, and 96\r\nITC Bodoni Six, Twelve,
    and Seventy Two\r\nCycles Five, Seven, Nine, Eleven, Eighteen, Twenty Four, and
    Thirty Six\r\n\r\nAs Tiffany points out, not all designers who work on optically
    optimized variants use a numbered size designation. The Freight family is one
    approach (Micro, Text, Display, Big). Adobe uses the approach of Caption, Text,
    Subhead, Display.\r\n\r\nAlso, as Don humorously points out, sometimes a number
    in a name is not a size designation. Sometimes it is just a series designation.
    This is the case with Trade Gothic, I believe. The two styles Condensed 18 and
    Bold Condensed 20 are not targeted at 18 and 20 point; they are related series.\r\n\r\nWhich
    leads to the other kind of number system: a rationalized matrix of weights and
    styles. This was pioneered by Frutiger with Univers and the 2-digit system to
    relate style and weight.\r\n\r\nAnother example of this approach would be H&FJ's
    Knockout with numbered styles from 26 to 94 -- the first digit indicates relative
    weight, the second digit indicates relative width. \r\n\r\nFB's Giza family uses
    different numbers but a similar scheme: first digit is weight, second is width.\r\n\r\nHowever,
    just to confuse everyone, FB's original Bureau Grotesque family's scheme is the
    opposite: the first digit indicates width and the second indicates the weight.\r\n\r\nI
    think I got those right. Knockout's scheme is particularly challenging to follow,
    since the weight (first digit) crosses thresholds within a single weight column.\r\n\r\n--

  body: Wow. Thanks for the help! I guess this is something I will just have to learn
    from experience. To know and keep all of these straight it may take some time,
    but I'll get it. Thanks everyone, especially kentlew!
