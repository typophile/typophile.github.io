body: I&#39;m looking for a narrow serif typface. It&#39;s going to be used for an
  one page essay &#40;about politics&#41;, and I want to fit a lot of text on the
  same page. It should of course be legible...

  body: 'It might seem counter-intuitive, but narrowness actually results in less
    economy than a wide face! <BR>&#40;Except in one-line settings.&#41; <BR> <BR>The
    reasons are that: <BR>1&#41; A wide face can be used at a smaller point size while
    maintaining &#40;and possibly even improving&#42; on&#41; apparent size. <BR>2&#41;
    Linebreaks in text will often negate the culmulative horizontal savings a narrow
    face accumulates over many lines. A wider face at a smaller point size always
    saves in vertical space. <BR> <BR>&#42; This I still have to verify. <BR> <BR>So
    a narrow face will only be more economical than a wide face -at a smaller size-
    if your text has very few linebreaks. <BR> <BR>However, wide faces can convey
    less elegance/sophistication than a narrow face &#40;like see the new LA Times
    body face&#41;, so a good reason to use a narrow font to save space would be if
    you want to convey a certain atmosphere. And note that a good narrowness/width
    depends on the point size &#40;more like point size <i>range</i>&#41; you&#39;re
    using. <BR> <BR>Anyway, if you do decide on a narrow font, try Stone Print. <BR>

  body: well, my teacher doesn&#39;t like when the size is anything other than 12
    points &#40;12/14&#41;. Otherwise I would have set the text in a smaller size.
    Stone Print looks nice Hrant - any other suggestions?

    he think point size &#40;not to mention leading&#41; depends on what&#39;s being
    designed? <BR>Would he set a newspaper in 12 point? I mean, I know Swedes have

  body: I just thought of a potential loophole in your teacher&#39;s &#34;rule&#34;.
    <BR>If you could just get him to drop the 2-point leading requirement &#40;try
    to think of a good excuse for that, like short lines&#41;, what you could do is
    use a font that&#39;s wide but small on the body, with zero &#40;or maybe even
    negative&#41; leading. That way you&#39;ll have a &#34;12 point&#34; font &#40;&#34;Just
    look, Quark says it&#39;s 12 point!&#34;&#41;, but you could use width/size instead
    of narrowness to save space. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>

  body: Make the layout with two or three columns, with a generous gutter, try to
    keep your measure to 40-50 characters, no hyphenation if possible. <BR> <BR>Tim

  body: I&#39;ve read that 65 characters is ideal, but I guess it all depends on the
    typeface used. Changing the leading is of course an option, I&#39;ll do some experiments
    on it... <BR> <BR>Any more suggestions on a narrow font? <BR>
