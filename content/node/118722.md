  body: I'm not a typeface designer, just a user, so take my comments for what they're
    worth. The first thing I noticed was the 'missing' serifs on the X. It looks wrong
    to me.

  body: X/x has a "backwards" look because that kind of shape is more commonly found
    in the downstroke (relating to cursive form). The awkwardness would disappear
    if you applied it to both strokes. Something similar at the start of v/w/y may
    or may not be helpful.

  body: "Tail of /Q/ and hood of /f/ are too timid. \r\nThe stencil-like breaking
    at the branching points is probably one too many ideas for this typeface. If you're
    going to keep that, better to make the break at the bottom than the top of /p/."

  body: "@eliason,\r\n\r\nthank you for your corrections.\r\nI think you are right
    with Q and, f and the breaking point could be better at the bottom of the p. Maybe
    it is one idea too much, maybe not, I\xB4m not sure \u2026"
