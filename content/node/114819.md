  body: "Well, that puts it into the realm of metal type most likely. At first I thought
    it was some version of Times, but the E is wrong and the ear on the g seems too
    angled. Can you find a sample that shows more upper case letters?\r\n\r\n- Mike

  body: "In looking through Jaspert's \"Encyclopaedia of Type Faces\" I think this
    may be Life by Ludwig & Mayer from 1964. The [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/urw/life/
    ?refby=bowfin|digital]] version does not show the slightly angled eye of the 'e',
    but the distinctive slanted upper bowl of the 'g' is there. It seems as if your
    scan lost some details, like the ear of the 'g' and the arm (?) of the 'r', but
    if I had to guess right now, that would be my choice.\r\n\r\nAnyone else have
    some printed metal samples of Life to compare?\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: "Sorry, I have been gone for a week, but those samples convince me that \"Life\"
    is the right typeface. There is only one anomaly that I have noticed -- the italic
    J is wrong. The \"Life\" italic J should not have a serif on the tail of the J,
    just as it does not in the Roman J (see John Rimmer in bottom sample). The type
    is surely not Times because the J is below the baseline and the wrong shape.\r\n\r\nI'm
    sticking with my answer.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
