body: "Hi there\r\nNot sure if this is the right place to ask my question, but here
  we go:\r\n\r\nA client asked me if it is possible to have an icon-font, where they
  can define two colours of the icon in their layout program (Indesign). What they
  mean is that the icon (see attached) consists of two parts, where as one part needs
  to be a different colour to the other. In the attached example the background would
  be red and the cross will be white. I\u2019m not a font designer and haven't used
  any of the font creation apps at all. I just wanted to know if it is possible or
  not? Maybe it is possible to define the background as the fill of the font and the
  cross as the stroke.\r\n\r\nThanks for your help.\r\nJ\xF6rg\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n "

    frames or using (negative) spacing.\r\n\r\n* Various colour fonts standards are
    being developed, but support is still very limited."

  body: "Right now I agree with riccard0. Actually your question comes a little too
    early, as color extensions will become part of the OpenType font specification
    in the near future.\r\n\r\nIt will take some time before most software, InDesign
    included, start supporting the upcoming color font extensions.\r\n\r\nRight now
    Internet Explorer running on Windows 8.1 and Firefox version 32 (on all platforms)
    already support the Microsoft color extension, as shown here:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.high-logic.com/fontcreator/demo/monstre/index.html\r\nhttp://www.high-logic.com/fontcreator/colorfonts/colorlogo.html\r\n"

  body: That's pretty cool. What do you reckon this will be useful for though? I'm
    not protesting its usefulness; I'm just curious what it will lead to.
