body: "I have just taken over a weekly newpaper and am in the process of creating
  new text styles for various elements (body copy, cutline, etc.). The problem I'm
  having is with justification.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/justify-1_3817.jpg]\r\n\r\nI
  have played around with the various settings but can not get the spacing how I want
  it. In the image I've included, for example, the word \"Regional\" should not be
  breaking like it is. Also, in the next paragraph, the spaces on either side of the
  word \"vendor\" are just to big.\r\n\r\nI'm sure it's probably a quick and simple
  fix, but I haven't played about with his stuff as much because this is my first
  time creating my own styles. \r\n\r\nAny tips would be appreciated."

  body: "For a weekly newspaper you can use some justification settings that will
    reduce the big white gaps -- but like Florian says, there are tradeoffs. \r\nFirst
    of all, for your body styles, you should set the hyphenation panel to match your
    preferences: for example, it sounds like you would like minimum number of characters
    after the hyphen to be 3. \r\nFor a narrow justified column (like a newspaper),
    you can try using a small amount of letterspacing or glyphscaling in the justification
    panel.  I know this is a religious issue, but I will just mention it. Using letterspacing
    of -2% - +2% or glyphscaling of 98%-102% can help with spacing and is barely noticeable.\r\n"

  body: "With this kind of work, I suspect you will get better results using the single
    line composer rather than the paragraph composer. Certainly you will have more
    control if you choose to modify things by hand. Others may disagree, but when
    I set ragged right, for example, I tend to use the single line composer. The paragraph
    composer's decisions try to even things, but the compromises it makes are not
    to my taste.\r\n\r\nFor example: in setting a justified paragraph, I often prefer
    one really terrible line & the rest good over all lines being fairly bad, but
    not as the one terrible line. You may decide otherwise. \r\n "

  body: "I agree with Charles. You'll have better luck getting the results you probably
    expect using the Single Line Composer. That \"Regional\" for instance -- Eric,
    I don't think DBell wants to exclude 2-letter endings; but one would expect that
    Regional would not break, because there's plenty of room left on the first line.\r\n\r\nThe
    issue here is that the Paragraph Composer is calculating all the following lines
    and judging that in order to keep others downstream from being less desirable,
    the first line needs to sacrifice that \"-al\". But this is contrary to what the
    typical designer would want/expect. Switching to Single Line Composer should help
    with this. And, as Charles said, it will make manual adjustments more manageable.\r\n\r\nIn
    addition, as Eric suggested, you may wish to add some letterspacing (or even glyph
    scaling). Yes, this is heretical, I realize. But newspaper setting is a unique
    and extreme situation, and will sometimes admit of extreme measures.\r\n\r\nI
    don't think I'd do -2% letterspacing; looks like your body type is already spaced
    snuggly, and you wouldn't want your words crushing up. Your Min word space is
    already handling tight lines fine. Maybe -1% but only as a last resort. Adding
    +2%, however will ameliorate those inevitable gappy lines, like that \"vendors\"
    line, a little. (But more than 2% could lead to the kind of really open spacing
    that Goudy railed against.)\r\n\r\nI personally would probably try to resist glyph
    scaling. But you could experiment with including 1 or 2%, as Eric suggests. My
    test, in these cases, is to see if I can actually spot the difference in practice.
    If I can't, then I know that no one else will.\r\n\r\n-- Kent.\r\n\r\n"

    whether or not it honors them (and that's the point, isn't it).\r\n\r\nFWIW"

  body: I made some of those adjustments, and it looks better. I think I am going
    to switch to wider columns maybe. Thanks all.
