  a company I work for. As we are increasingly using fonts cross platform for director

  body: There&#39;s a lot of information on OS and app stuff in the OpenType User
    Guide from Adobe, and our readme. Both can be found at <A HREF="http://www.adobe.com/type/opentype"
    TARGET="_top">http://www.adobe.com/type/opentype</A>. <BR> <BR>Any other comments
    I make on the wonderfulness of OpenType are likely to be suspect, given my day
    job, but I can say that OpenType works on Windows 2000 and XP, and Mac OS X, natively.
    On Windows 95/98/ME and Mac OS 8.6-9.2, you need ATM Light or Deluxe. But of course,
    you&#39;d need that for Type 1 fonts as well on those OSes. <BR> <BR>Regards,

  body: I&#39;m having a lot of problems working with OT and can&#39;t seem to find
    anyone--Adobe, included--who can give me some answers. <BR> <BR>I&#39;m using
    ATM Deluxe 4.6x and laying out collateral in Quark 4.x. My machine&#39;s performance
    is severly impaired using them &#40;printing takes longer, page scrolling is a
    chore, etc.&#41;. Is there a reason for this? <BR> <BR>My main problem is with
    the local service bureau not being able to handle the OT formats. I&#39;ve checked
    with them to ensure they are up-to-date with software versions and all of that;
    they assure me that they are. They are unable to print to any printer, film output
    device, whatever.  <BR> <BR>Can anyone here shed any light on this? I&#39;ve read
    all of the readme&#39;s, pdfs, and official documenation at adobe.com, and looked
    everywhere else I can for more information. While everyone seems to speak highly
    of OT here, the design community still seem to be resonating with grumblings.
    <BR> <BR>Thanks in advance. <BR> <BR>cp  <BR> <BR>

  body: Not sure if this is even the same issue, but with MM Fonts I found that I
    had to download the font to the RIP in order to get the file to print. Has your
    service provider tried this?

  body: For you info, I have done film output on my usual local printer shop from
    Indesign 1.5 and 2.0 on Mac 9 and Mac X in last september with OpenType fonts
    &#40;my own OT done with FL 4.5 win version&#41; -- with no problem at all. The
    film machine was an Agfa something... What is generally need is a rip with PS
    3 &#40;5 to 10  years old now I think... but many services bureaus in France still
    be on PS 2, hum&#41;. <BR> <BR>Miss to say, that I came with my Powerbook, mainly
    to avoid to give fonts and control everything, its for the Sabon Next brochure
    and the Charles Peignot book for ATypI. <BR><a href="http://www.typofonderie.com/atypi/cpbook.html"
    target="_blank">http://www.typofonderie.com/atypi/cpbook.html</a> <BR> <BR>I never
    trust a printer when he say that he was up to date. Indeed some are up to date!
    Thanks for us. <BR> <BR>Good luck.

  body: 'Hmmm... re your problem with OT-Fonts, the problem seems to be with the ouput
    bureau. The only thing about OT is that SOMETIMES they&#39;ll have to be installed
    locally, at the machine doing the actual output, not on some server location.
    But that&#39;s about it. When I bought my first OTs via Fontshop US from Adobe
    &#40;couldn&#39;t buy them directly, as Adobe doesn&#39;t do business with Non-US-Customers
    on their homepage, alas, so Fontshop helped me for a small fee&#41;, I got MAC
    Fonts and even those installed perfectly on my XP-machine.  <BR> <BR>OT, although
    a very problematic format for developer, as I hear, is wonderful from this users
    perspective. If you work with InDesign and -- as we do -- on Wintel workstations,
    youi&#39;ll not only be happy about the MASSIVE plus in typographic efficiency
    and freedom but '

    but OT fonts &#40;TT and CFF&#41; for three years now, and find them much <i>less</i>
    problematic than Type 1 fonts. Simply having a single binary file to maintain
    and ship &#40;rather than multiple outline, bitmap, metrics files&#41; makes OT
    development much easier and less time consuming. Even when I&#39;m not making
    an extended character set or adding OT Layout features to a font, I&#39;ll still
    output a CFF-OT font in preference to a Type 1 because the file format is tidier,
    more compact and cross-platform.
