  font for a brochure I'm designing. The topic is: High End Condos $450,000 - $950,000
  / 55 and older active adult community / lots of pictures / descriptions of amenities,
  floor plans and area attractions.\r\n\r\nAny thoughts would be greatly appreciated.
  I'm just starting the process. My instinct says serif, anyway.\r\n\r\nI've enclosed
  some elements of the brochure.\r\n\r\nTHANK YOU,\r\nKate"

  body: It would depend on the design of the condos, which should be reflected in
    the brochure itself. Are the condos modern, contemporary, classic? You did say
    active, so I would assume you don't want something too formal...
