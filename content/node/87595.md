  body: "\"Similar\" is usually a matter of taste -regarding this kind of fonts-\r\nbecause
    they are really distinct, but you can try:\r\n\r\n<strong>[[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/paratype/pt-script-zephyr/|PT
    Script Zephyr]]</strong>\r\n<strong>[[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/fonthead/good-dog/|Good
    Dog]]</strong>\r\n\r\nor you may also look for <strong>MistyScript</strong> or
    <strong>SandysHand</strong>\r\n"
