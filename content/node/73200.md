  font, [[http://justanotherfoundry.com/peacock|JAF Peacock]].\r\n<!--break-->\r\nPeacock
  is a collaboration between [[http://www.agency26.com/|Brian Jaramillo]] and [[http://justanotherfoundry.com/|Tim
  Ahrens]]. Jaramillo completed most of the glyphs in 2007, and contacted Ahrens to
  help with the OpenType. Ahrens helped refine the typeface, and set-up the OpenType
  features. After a period of inactivity, the duo decided during the summer of 2010
  to give Peacock a final push to retail.\r\n\r\nContextual and stylistic alternates
  are accessible via the OpenType pop-up menu on the Glyph palette in InDesign. In
  addition, any alternate glyphs can be selected manually via the Insert Glyph palette.
  The typeface features 1239 glyphs."
