  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">I'm thinking of putting together a "General Posting Guidelines" thread (not this one) that would remain at the top of the posting area in the General Discussion Board mainly to inform newcomers to the boards on how to get the most out of the typophile experience. I'm wondering:

1) Is this a good idea?

2)What are some standards you think should be recommended. Here are a couple i think there should be:

A) Search before you post: many topic have been discussed before. Please use the search function before posting a new thread to see if the subject you're interested in has already been covered.

B) Image guidelines: Images MUST be in RGB format and should not exceed certain dimensions (what dimensions should those be? you tell me!)

So, post here with what you think our community guidelines should be. (Or if there are already some in place, please point me to them!) Thnx for looking.

***Update: the guidelines can be found at http://typophile.com/readme</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I have long advocated posting a request to refrain from personal attacks--at the place where people do their posts. Here is the one from Typographica:

"Please refrain from off-topic banter and personal attacks. Your comment may be edited or removed at the discretion of Typographica editors. Our goal is not to stifle debate but to keep it relevant."

I would not want the stuff about refraining from off-topic banter, though. In good Talmudic style, some of the best stuff on Typophile happens when people go off on a tangent and people join in the discussion of it. A little irrelevant humor is welcome also. 

And the policing warning is not a necessity. Typophile is so active that it is probably unreasonable to ask volunteers to police it. But if the notice is there, then a firm warning from a moderator, and a very rare after-the-fact removal with an explanation might be healthy also.  </div>

This is already posted as a guide in the Type ID section but new topic subjects such as "Help!" or "What is this font?" is less inviting to open than slightly more descriptive topics like: "Please ID script face on store sign" which might interest the right members.

yes, i'm hoping to develop similar guidelines for other areas as well. for type crits i want to suggest that posters include

1) a gif/jpg/png showing large detail of the font

2) a pdf with text/display showings to show the font off in context.</div>

I agree that some simple guidelines, more on the technical side than anything, would be good. Can topics be 'pinned' to the top of the General Discussions area? Other bboards I've seen do this with FAQ and guideline threads. Also, perhaps you could include a very brief and courteous line or two about requesting free fonts on Typophile.</div>

yes. once i have my guidelines together there will be a closed thread that will remain at the top of the topics list with guidelines.

definately. it will refer free font seekers to this wiki entry: [[FAQ_Free]].</div>

I have a funny feeling I've just done what Chris can't abide which is to change the topic halfway through. BTW, any idea what this font is? [img:sites/default/files/old-images/Trebuchet.jpg] Yes I know the quality is rubbish: it's a JPEG.

On size of images, I like 640 x 480px (the size of screens once) but it turns out that that's too big for the column width available without scrolling. 600 (the size for Type Battle) seems a reasonable suggestion - don't think depth matters as much (provided it's not crazy).</div>

And Thing 2: this may be a dumb question, but... shouldn't the FAQ be posted at the top of the <strong>Forums</strong> page? Or is it at the top of <strong>General Discussions</strong> because everyone comes here first?</div>

I certainly agree with William that we should recommend refraining from personal attacks. Integral to this however is a parallel recommendation: Typophile -although inescapably leaning towards certain cultures- is more like a zoo than a cocktail party, and the animals are from all over the planet. Ergo, don't assume, and certainly don't insist, that others take offense from the same things. That's just provincial. William's Talmudism or my Agnoticism should not impede candor. We pay politicians for that.

Without adding that to your "Be Courteous" section, you: risk people getting overly shocked once in a while; and really, you're hiding the truth.

William: According to Yves, an Armenian mountain lion.*
But giraffes, they're silent. :-)  I'm very glad John isn't.
BTW, I forgot to point out the main thing in the zoo
analogy: Typophile is our watering hole.

Yes, same problem as Lauri with PDFs - every other site is fine - this one is the only one that doesn't work. PDF attachments on other sites do <em>not</em> prompt me with a grey dialogue box as to whether I want to open or save etc. They simply launch Acrobat automatically (unless already open) and open pdfs in the same/another browser window (ie in IE6 but with Acrobat functionality). I'm sure you know what I'm talking about.</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><em>...commercial fonts for illegal download.</em>

<strong>illicit</strong> would be preferable to "illegal", because in some countries there is no "legal" basis to the act of "font theft" or "unauthorized sharing of software", no actual state laws or legislation relating directly to it.

The only real standard for this kind of thing is the commercial nature of font vending and the moral outrage of type makers and vendors whose commercial rights are violated. For example, a user who breaches the terms and conditions of a font product's EULA makes illicit use of the product, but there may be no legal redress to their behaviour, depending on which country we're talking about.

It may be wise to put in a statement dealing with the "unauthorized distribution or sharing", breach of EULA and the <strong>commercial rights</strong> of authorized vendors.

First, I'd recommend that it say "that" instead of "which."

Second, remember that non-commercial fonts are still copyrighted. We could look at what Wikipedia says. I have to go.</div>

Paul, how about: "please do not post links to sites or resources offering unauthorized downloads of fonts, either free or commercial."

It may seem trivial to some people, but Thomas has good point about "that" v.s "which". It's a very fine point in English grammar.

I've avoided it altogether with "offering".

Glad you guys care.

Yep, some basic google tips on searching would be invaluable.

While I think of it, the max image width of 600px still causes scrollbars to appear in Internet Explorer, so I've adopted 590px for max width. I'm not allowed to look at Typophile on Macs at work. so can Safari users please post some feedback on max image width? What's the maximum width image you can post before scrollbars show up?

Thanks :^)

		<div class="commentbody">The BBC answer doesn't mention Fowler, of "Modern English Usage". Fowler had a campaign to distinguish between "that" and "which". The idea is that you should use "that" when the clause defines or identifies that which comes before: "The assassination that triggered the First World War." But when you are expanding on the previous, then you use "which": "Romney's speech on religion, which was highly controversial."

There is some debate about how valid this rule is, but I think it's helpful.  </div>

2. Non-Standard Links  Following are the five main guidelines for links:

• Make obvious what’s clickable: for text links, use colored, underlined text (and don't underline non-link text).  

• Differentiate visited and unvisited links.

• Explain what users will find at the other end of the link, and include some of the key information-carrying terms in the anchor text itself to enhance scannability and search engine optimization (SEO). <strong>Don’t use “click here” or other non-descriptive link text</strong>.

• Avoid JavaScript or other fancy techniques that break standard interaction techniques for dealing with links.

In particular, don’t open pages in new windows (except for PDF files and such).</p> <p>Links are the Web's number one interaction element. Violating common expectations for how links work is a sure way to confuse and delay users, and might prevent them from being able to use your site.

For example, instead of linking “I just came across an interesting Kickstarter project. For more information, <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/2094022925/gremolata-and-cancellaresca-milanese">click here</a>” (which provides the user with no information as to where they are going to end up without additionally reading the words around the ambiguous word “here,” try:

I was doing a bit of reading, and I came across <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/2094022925/gremolata-and-cancellaresca-milanese">an interesting Kickstarter project: Gremolata & Cancellaresca Milanese</a>. A graphic design project in new York, NY, by Russell Maret.

(And how wonderfully ironic that the page I came from to end up “here” — <a href="http://typophile.com/readme"> a Typophile thread “PLEASE READ: Typophile Forum Posting Guidelines”</a> — violates this very principle ;)</div>
