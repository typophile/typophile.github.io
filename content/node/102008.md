  post about the work of Rosario Florio [[http://bench.li/images/4504]]. It's one
  of those quirky and somewhat uncomfortable-looking sans that are trendy now. Any
  ideas, or suggestions for similar? "

  body: The main image is actually somewhat distorted, as I tried to get it identified
    on MyFonts and had to straighten out the angle. An unadulterated version is viewable
    on the [[http://bench.li/images/4504|Florio link]]

  body: looks sortof like [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/itc-ronda/|ITC Ronda]],
    but kindof brutalized and then mixed with some non-Ronda characters.

    [[http://www.tendollarfonts.com/simon-sans-typeface|Simon Sans]] would be a fair
    alternative but you'll have to redraw /R (from /P). [[http://www.tendollarfonts.com/fonts|TenDollarFonts]]
    has many typefaces in the same vein. You could also have a look to [[http://experimentalsans.tumblr.com/|I
    Am So Tired With Your Experimental Sans]], [[http://www.colophon-foundry.org|Colophon
    Foundry]], [[http://www.grillitype.com|Grilli Type]] and [[http://www.radimpesko.com|Radim
