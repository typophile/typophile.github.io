  some interest:\r\n<cite>\r\nBy default, Firefox 3.5 only allows fonts to be loaded
  for pages served from the same site. This prevents sites from freely using fonts
  found on other sites. For sites that explicitly want to allow cross-site font sharing,
  an online font library for example, Firefox 3.5 supports the use of access control
  headers to control this behavior.\r\n</cite>\r\n\r\nThere is a section on \"respect
  for font licensing\", though it's glossed over - which is probably for the best
  since it's not the browsers job to enforce i.p. (IMHO).\r\n"

    motion. Maybe simple concessions like this, and possibly supporting FB\u2019s
    permission bits, could prevent us from ending up with another font format entering
    the mix."

    to pirate font archives in un-enforcible countries simply to avoid acting upon
    foundries take-down notices. \r\n\r\nDoesn't really address the core issue of
    commercial foundries not wanting to license fonts for web use. "
