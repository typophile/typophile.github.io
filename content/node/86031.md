  video was filmed outdoors, as the UK seems to basking in a heatwave. The calendar
  is saying that it's October, but the temperatures have been in the 80s!\r\n\r\nI'm
  carrying on the trend of unusual vehicles at the end of the video. This month it's
  a car cruising up and down the River Ouse in York, here in the UK.\r\n\r\nClick
  here to take a look at this month's video:\r\nhttp://j.mp/k5KA95\r\n\r\n \r\nOn
  the Forum\r\nIt's always nice to see something new, and this month a picture of
  a round-based Linotype appeared on the forum. Don't forget, you don't have to register
