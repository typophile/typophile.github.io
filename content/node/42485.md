  type. I've looked all over the internet but I can't seem to find a definitive answer,
  so I'm hoping someone here can help. The question is \"What sizes were lead type
  available in?\". Any help would be greatly appreciated.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nJustin

  body: Moveble Type existed before the era of international standardization so specific
    agreed upon standards did not exist at the outset. Standards eventually came into
    being once printing became more widespread and foundries started to sell type
    but still varied amongst regions. Hence arcane names such as Brevier, Nonpareil,
    etc. did not necessarily translate from one place to the next.

    generally speaking, in the twentieth century, it was a little more limited than
    that. At least in my experience. The common sizes included 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 18,
    24, 30, 36, 48, 60, and 72...all available in lead.\r\n\r\nI happen to have some
    16 pt and 54 pt type, but I wouldn't consider them common.\r\n\r\nThis is good
    to keep in mind if you're designing a publication that is supposed to have a retro
    or throw-back feel.\r\n\r\n21.5 pt type? No such thing!"

    84, 96, and 120 pt.\r\n\r\nI think the largest size commercially cast in lead
    type was the 288-point Stymie Compressed, which was too large to cast in a typical

  body: "BIG TYPE!! Ludlow, Lino, ATF\r\n\r\nLudlow made some huge type. Their biggest
    was \"240 Point (Title) Ludlow 3-BEC Bodoni Campanile Advertising Figures\". The
    figures are about 19 picas tall. They also made this face and some others in 144,
    120, and 96. The interesting thing about these is how they are cast. The comp
    uses the same stick as for any other Ludlow face. But instead of inserting mats
    along the length of the stick, assembling words just as a foundry type compositor
    would, these faces are cast one character per slug. The mats are set into the
    stick in the long direction. The resulting slugs are then assembled into a price.\r\n
    \    The fonts consisted of one mat for each figure, a dollar sign, a period,
    and a comma. A pound mark was available in the UK. The largest sizes were often
    used for dollar amounts, with smaller sizes used for the cents, elevated so the
    tops of the figures aligned.\r\n     Ludlow was proud of these large mats. Here's
    their description of the mats for one face: \"The matrices for 144 point Ludlow
    Gothic Extra Condensed Advertising Figures are engraved in solid blocks of brass
    and are practically indestructible.\" They are wonderful artifacts of the age
    of metal type.\r\n\r\nLinotype had the same sort of system, called the A-P-L,
    or All-Purpose-Linotype. It was basically an adaptation of the Ludlow system described
    above. I never ran one, so I'm not sure if regular Lino mats could be run in this
    hand-assembly fashion, or if only the special A-P-L mats could be used.\r\n\r\nIn
    my San Francisco printing shop years ago I had some of the ATF Caslon 540 in those
    84, 96 and 120 point sizes Kent speaks of. One knew one was setting type when
    working with those sorts.\r\n\r\npowers\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Well, the sizes of a lead fonts first of all depend on the country it is
    used.\r\nYou guys from anglo-american countries use Pica Point.\r\nAnd e.g. you
    have a 18 p size. What the Didot Point - used in Germany e.g., don't have.\r\n\r\nPica
    point:\r\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pica_(unit_of_measure)\r\n\r\nDidot point:\r\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_(typography)\r\n\r\nIn
    Germany and several other european countries with exception of UK we know:\r\n\r\n3/6

    p\r\nThat's the standard.\r\nThe names in brackets are more or less a kind of
    slang. E.g. Nonpareille is a french word for \"not possible to built smaller\".
    But in Germany its not pronounced real french. Its more... slangy.. \r\n\r\nWhat
    I feel strange for is, if I see you digital guys work with e.g. 9.6 p size or
    so... As a lead letter typograph I'ld never ever use e.g. 11 p (there is no, but
    if, I won't.\r\n\r\n\r\nGeorg\r\n_______________________________________________\r\n\u201EIch
