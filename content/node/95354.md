body: "Hi guys,\r\n\r\nIt's been a while since I've posted something myself here.
  I'd like your input on my latest font NOVA. NOVA is a solid grotesk font that has
  loads of wow-stuff under the hood. I've been working on it for about a year now,
  and I'm getting close to a semi-final version. I always liked typefaces that I can
  both use as a serious workhorse and for creative playing. NOVA has all that (imho)!\r\n\r\nThe
  ones who are following me on Facebook, Twitter or Flickr, have seen this font before
  and also reacted on it (very positive I must say). Here's one of the latest discussions
  about NOVA on Typophile: \r\n[[http://typophile.com/node/91652]]\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Typophile_critique_01_3543.gif]\r\n\r\nThe
  design is still a bit rough, so I'll do a few more rounds later on. I just want
  to first get all the automated stuff in place before I start polishing. I'm almost
  done with the basic OpenType features, but I'd like your input on discretionary
  ligatures & swashes that help me make a good strategy for the first release. I don't
  want to end my days programming OT features and get frustrated, so I want to put
  all the right stuff in here that should serve most people.\r\n\r\nPlease help me
  fill in the gaps, name me the ligatures and swashes that I've missed and that are
  important in your language. The attached PDF file gives you a good impression of
  the vast range of options NOVA has under the hood. "

    only thing that bothers me a lot is the \"e\" (of course a very important letter).
    It seems too \"Euro-geo\", with none of the open playfulness of the whole.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: Hi hrant, do you think it's to generic? Does it lack a certain level of character,
    in you opinion? Because that can be easily fixed.  ;-)

    character. I'd look to the \"a\" for clues.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    gif is the best way to show the options, no?'
