body: "Hi everyone, I'm pleased to be here, I love design, grammar, and font.  I'm
  a copy-editor by trade, but with a flare for aesthetics, I hope.  \r\n\r\nI work
  at BC Children's Hospital.  For those who don't know, a quick Google Image search
  will reveal that most of their logos are designed to look like they're written by
  five year olds with Crayola products.  That's not a slight, that's their actual
  intent.  Crayons.  Their letterhead is made to look like it's written in crayon.
  \ The signs of the departments outside my door has the same crayon motif.  \r\n\r\nNow
  I've just inherited the job of updating this page:\r\nhttp://www.bcchildrens.ca/Services/ClinicalDiagnosticFamilyServices/SocialWork/Forfamilies/Accommodation.htm\r\n\r\nSomething
  occurs to me; and I realize that saying so may or may not make me an instant pariah
  in this community, but I'm willing to make the bold statement to risk your contempt;
  I may have actually discovered an appropriate place for Comic Sans.  It goes along
  with their disarming appearance and child's script motif.  Is it even arguable that
  I should keep it that way, or will even the layman's sentiments about this font
  ruin the credibility of the information below?\r\n\r\nAnyways, thanks everyone,
  and I hope to become a prolific part of this community."

  body: Comic Sans is easy to read, clear and friendly.  The hate on it is over the
    top.  For some uses, it's not bad at all.

    there are more crayon-like possibilities now. See, for example, here:\r\nhttp://code.google.com/webfonts?subset=latin&category=handwriting"

    that is the best font for your use: Times New Roman works best in newspaper columns,
    but that doesn''t entail that newspaper columns work best in Times New Roman.'

  body: "Thanks everyone, good food for thought so far.  \r\n\r\nIn addition, for
    those who did that Google Image search: can you identify the font used below the
    sunshine-happyface logo?  I wonder if I should just go with that, to keep that
    part of the motif."

  body: "If you don't mind a non-type comment, I noticed that the listings are not
    alphabetical within each section. (For example, \"Holiday Inn\" is listed immediately
    before \"Century Plaza\").  \r\n\r\nReaders might wonder if the listing order
    within each section is random, or in order of desirability, or in order of closeness
    to your facility, or what."

  body: 'You''re quite right, and that''s one of the changes I''ve already made.  A
    rough draft is being uploaded today, and since I''ve appropriated this page from
    its predecessors I''m cleaning up all the formatting mistakes.  Good catch, I
    had the same thought of perceived preference.  '

  body: "Alright, improvements have been made, but some have been kaiboshed.  It sounds
    like it's part of their enforced design layout for all their pages to have the
    fonts and rough appearance involved, and so I don't have the authority to recommend
    another font.  Nevertheless, I'm goign to improve it every other way, and your
    advice has been very appreciated.  \r\n\r\nAgain, I hope to collaborate with the
    good people here often!"
