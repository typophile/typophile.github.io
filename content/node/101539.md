    and [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/everson/duibhlinn|Duibhlinn]] by Evertype.
    Very close to your sample. This one is probably one of the \"first classic standard
    Gaelic typefaces of the 1930s\" or may be Monotype Series 24 (http://www.monotypeimaging.com/aboutus/MT1896_1906.aspx).\r\n<blockquote>1903
    - First Irish font cut as Gaelic, Series 24.\r\nNegotiations began for the British
    company to secure marketing rights of Monotype machines in Europe and other parts
    of the world in addition to the UK and its colonies, except for North and South
    America and Canada. By 1904 the agreement was settled.</blockquote>"
