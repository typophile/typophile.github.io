  body: I really would not have got it without Yves&#39; mention of Trump. Compared
    to most of the present company, I&#39;m very bad at identifying typefaces. However,
    since Yves has been so gracious &#40;except for the bit where he called me an
    American!&#41;, I&#39;ll post a challenge very shortly.

  body: 'Okay, here it is. I was really tempted to post something non-Latin: a small
    corner of a Chinese character, the feather of an <a href="http://www.roslin.com/posterinfo/posterinfo1.htm">Armenian
    bird letter</a>, or the reph form of an Hindi vocalic R, but I settled on something
    a little less obscure: <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/11281.gif"

    have a diagonal cut like that. <BR> <BR>John, what is the proportion of this part
    of a glyph? xheight? cap? its a Latin &#34;based&#34; script &#40;such Greek,
