For those of you who are not yet members of SoTA, the latest issue of [[Interrobang]] is well worth the price of admission alone. It is all [[William Addison Dwiggins|Dwigged out]] with terrific articles and contributions by [[Tamye Riggs]], [[Jon Coltz]], [[Tiffany Wardle]], [[Stephen Coles]], [[Kent Lew]], [[Richard Kegler]], and [[Allan Haley]].
There is plenty of both serious and humorous Dwiggins Nation to keep you reading so come get [[sota|SoTAsfied]]! This thing is a keeper!

		<div class="commentbody">Thanks Chris! It's the largest issue <em>Interrobang</em> by far and the first in full-color. I contributed only production and some design, the main credit goes to the others you mentioned. 

Looks like someone needs to update the Wiki entry. Wish I had a moment today.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Thanks, everyone, for the kind words. We are really proud of this issue, and of the involvement of so many generous and creative people from the type, design, and printing history communities.

In addition to those Chris listed (Stephen, Jon, Tiffany, Kent, Rich, Allan and myself), Paul Shaw, Bruce Kennett, and Charles Nix contributed materials. We had tremendous support from the folks in the Rare Books and Manuscripts Department at the Boston Public Library and contributions from the University of Kentucky Libraries, Chauncey Hawley Griffith Papers, Special Collections Department.

So many people have been inspired by Dwiggins - we only scratched the surface. The type designers with work featured in the magazine include Akira Kobayashi, Cyrus Highsmith, Jonathan Hoefler, Sibylle Hagmann, Tobias Frere-Jones, Jim Spiece, Thomas Rickner, David Berlow, Rich, Charles, and Kent. The Font Bureau, ITC, P22, Linotype, and Monotype Imaging provided additional support.

It was an incredible experience to delve into the wonderful world of Dwiggins. I really fell in love with the man and his work during the process of producing the mag and Dwigfest at TypeCon2006.

Anyone visiting Boston should plan to spend time at the BPL - their Dwiggins collection is nothing short of amazing.

We don't have many copies left of this issue of <em>Interrobang</em>. We'll have membership up very very soon, and new members will get this issue while supplies last :)

We'll be working on a new issue shortly, and welcome ideas for themes and article submissions.</div>

It's only related to Interrobang in that we showed an Odile specimen in the mag and my article and Interrobang both give love to Dwiggie. Otherwise, it's the story of a girl and her typeface.

One of our gurutastic board members, Dave Hollingsworth, just sent me a link to test the membership registration system. He's doing some behind-the-scenes wizardry to hook it up to our TypeCon payment gateway so we don't have to jack with PayPal anymore. It's just a couple of days away from launch :)</div>
