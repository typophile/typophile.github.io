    has the time to make a quick icon from a dagger, complete with bevel and drop
    shadow. I'd love to do it (<em>any</em> distraction is welcome), but i do need
    to get on with my presentation for next week's President's Lecture at the D&AD

    I came across a rattlesnake in the trail, coiled and rattling, ready to strike.
    I was so startled that I jumped sideways, off the trail, so as not to knock down
    the person behind me. Then I landed, off the trail, about a foot away from another
    rattlesnake, who was also equally prepared to defend itself.\r\n\r\nI've often
    thought about that lesson... when presented with a formiddable problem just be
    prepared for the consequences of acting too quickly!"

  body: What everybody in the many discussions around is missing is the fact that
    one doesn't always need a logo. When you're called Quark, you have an unusual
    name, short enough, well-known if not exactly well-respected in the business.
    Who says you need to abbreviate that into a Q? Why not customize that name into
    something unique? And then design a unique style around that to make the packaging,
    website et al stand out? We recognize Adobe products from their splash screens,
    packaging, advertising, because they have a style of their own. The motif invented
    for CS1 has been developed into a visual language which extended into CS2 and
    will extend into CS3 and beyond. One doesn't need the Adobe A logo to recognize
    the brand.
