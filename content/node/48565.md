  body: You can.  There are HTML entities that will provide you with these characters.  Em
    dash, for example, is "& mdash ;" without the spaces.  For a good list of entities,
    see [[http://htmlhelp.com/reference/html40/entities/|here]].

  body: "Same story. Check the links above. I usually just enter them with alt codes
    (Google search if you're unfamiliar with the term). The alt code for an en\u2013dash
    is ALT+0150 on Windows keyboards (in America). \r\n\r\nDoesn't matter how you
    enter it, really. So long as your website is, as was pointed out, encoded in Unicode,
    and the font used has the right glyph, it'll show up okay.\r\n\r\n\r\nPeace,\r\nJT"
