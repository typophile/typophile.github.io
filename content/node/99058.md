  body: "The font has an S that looks like amateur work, so I looked at free Sans
    fonts at Dafont. One called [[http://www.dafont.com/traffic-01-06.font?fpp=50&text=BLAST+OFF|Traffic]]
    has six versions including one Traffic1_0 that could look very close if you use
    outlining and layering to create the 3D effect.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
