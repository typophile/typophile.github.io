		<div class="commentbody">I second Darrel&#39;s suggestion to use a normal P. Think about it: the justification for the R is that the left side of the counter forms the nose-piece of the helmet. There is no such justification for repeating this shape in the P. It looks odd, and it draws attention away from the R. <BR> <BR>Personally, I would try this with <i>only</i> the R having an abnormal shape &#40;and the T, of course, where it is cut off by the crest of the helmet&#41;. I think it is a mistake to remove the crossbars of the A&#39;s: sure it looks Greek, but it looks like two uppercase <i>lambdas</i>, which confuses me into reading it as SPLRTLN. Actually, in the context of the two pseudo-<i>lambdas</i>, the cut-off T begins to look a lot like a <i>gamma</i>. And then do I read the P as Latin P or Greek <i>rho</i>? SRLRGLN, anyone? <BR> <BR>Making Latin letters look like non-corresponding Greek letters is a bit naff: like reversing the letter R to make things look &#39;Russian&#39;.</div>
