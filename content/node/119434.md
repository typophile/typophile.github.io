  body: "Looks like an old (1992) Image Club Graphics typeface called Aurea Titling.
    Sadly, it doesn't seem to be commercially available.\r\n\r\nIt was based on/a
    blatant copy of Aldo Novarese's Augustea (c. 1951), which only seems to exist
    in an outline version in digital format:\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/efscangraphic/augustea-open-sb/alternate_cuts.html\r\n\r\nNote:
    Augustea BQ (Berthold Foundry) is not the same typeface.\r\n\r\nA classic font
    that comes very close--dagger serifs and all--is Vendome:\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/vendome/"

  body: Can't agree more with Fivos. Depending on what you need, try to be careful
    with this one because there're a lot of illegal clones floating around including
    a freebie (which is probably the one used for your sample). If you need to reproduce
    this design and seek for legitimacy, the only way to re-create this lettering
    would be to fill in aforementioned by Kevin Augustea Open.

    knew I've seen it before but was unable to remember. Glad you finally found it
    out.
