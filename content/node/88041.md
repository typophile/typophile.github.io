  body: "It looks like <strong>[[http://www.artandsignstudio.com/christmasscript.html|Christmas
    Script]]</strong> (c) 2002 Art&Sign\r\n\r\nWhile I was searching for it, I discovered
    another one (so similar, that it's for sure a knock-off) \r\nIt's (c) 2004 by
    Autumn Leaves and they sell a commercial license for 6.00$.\r\nI just send an
    e-mail to artandsignstudio.com to investigate the case.\r\n"
