body: "Hi Typophiles,\r\n\r\n   In my continuing quest for understanding of the optical
  scaling techniques implemented as \"steam-powered computational geometry\" by the
  Bentons in their engraving machine, I am now at the point where I would <emph>really</emph>
  benefit from having images of several more cutting slips.\r\n\r\n   Please see <a
  href=\"http://typophile.com/node/18179\">the averaging thread</a> for more details
  on how I'm doing my analyses. Thanks to Patricia Cost, I now have images of three
  cutting slips (one from her, one at the back of <emph>Practical Typecasting</emph>
  by Theo Rehak), and have been able to confirm and refine my inferences based solely
  on study of the printed samples. I've been able to decipher almost all of the notations
  on the cutting slip, as well. I'm very excited by these new developments and am
  now eager to write up a paper (possibly in collaboration with Patricia or others)
  describing the Benton optical scaling techniques in detail.\r\n\r\n   But my cutting
  slip evidence is still a bit fragmentary. The one at the back of Rehak's book doesn't
  seem to be for a mainstream ATF typeface, as the H height is way too big for its
  36pt body size, so it's hard to know for sure whether I can generalize from it.
  So, I am now sending out the call to the typophile community: can anyone help me
  get images of some more cutting slips? I am asking you to dig deep; to contact any
  typographic libraries or other collections of ATF artifacts, to ask your not so
  Internet-connected colleagues, etc.\r\n\r\n   Patricia is already in contact with
  several people, including Theo and David Pankow. But apparently the ATF stuff got
  scattered to the winds around the time of the 1990 auction, so there are lots of
  places that might have them.\r\n\r\n   I know I am asking for quite a lot of work
  here, but you will earn my undying gratitude, as well as the satisfaction of having
  contributed a major chunk to the scholarship of the remarkable technical and typographic
  legacy of the Bentons.\r\n"

  body: Raph, I recommend contacting Mike Parker and Tobias Frere-Jones. They did
    some digging around in the Smithsonian collection some years ago, and if I recall
    correctly they found some original Benton material that would be of interest to
    you. Alternatively, you could contact Stan Nelson at the Smithsonian directly.

    gotten a complete set for one font from Theo Rehak. I'm really looking forward
    to receiving that so I can get into the detailed analysis.

  body: "Ralf,\r\n\r\n\"Cutting cards\"\u2014should have been called \"punch re-cutting
    cards\" or if you chose, \"punch re-cutting slips\"\r\n\r\nTheir primary purpose
    is positioning of line up\u2014ex height, fit, stem, \"ceriph\" (not sick) etc.
    in the event that a \"dupicate punch\" was needed due to breakage.\r\n\r\n(Re-)
    Cutting Cards in every size with a complete set of patterns would be of some use.
    Remember that there would be more re\u2014cutting cards than patterns. Remember
    artwork was the \"artists intention\" but patterns with punch cutting cards were
    the \"masters\"\r\n\r\nBut what were patterns and punch re-cutting cards, or /slips
    used for?\r\n\r\nCutting matrices\"\r\n\r\nWhat were matrices for?\r\n\r\nCasting
    type! \r\n\r\nYou see the destination?\r\n\r\nThink \"Times\", purchase a complete
    series of sizes, use high spaces or upside down type next to each character, ink
    very lightly, print lightly and there you have the information before you. Well,
    a generation away. In a perfect world you would have artwork, all re-cutting cards,
    all patterns, all punches and all sizes of type. Punches and type are duplications
    I suppose. Serious hands on metal type founding and punchcutting experience would
    be very good, or, to work with someone that understand the \"Benton Pantograph\".
    I am a little busy or I would offer to help. \r\n\r\nI could probably send you
    a scan of a cutting card and you would see what I mean by positioning information.
    I am staring at one right now.\r\n\r\nThis note is not spell checked. I am writing
    without my reading glasses. Hopefully there is not to many typeos.\r\n\r\nI wish
    you all the best.\r\n\r\n\r\nGerald Giampa \r\n\r\n"

    for any scans or copies of cutting slips in your possession.\r\n\r\nI'm mostly
    doing book-larnin' things now, because that comes most naturally to me. I hope
    to be able to take advantage of opportunities to get more hands-on experience
    with real metal type as they present, but for now I'm reasonably happy that my
    scholarship and analysis of digital scans is at least a useful contribution, if
    not a complete understanding.\r\n\r\nSo, you tell me, what hoops do I have to
    go through to get copies of your cutting slips, or is it pretty much a lost cause?\r\n"

  body: "Ralph,\r\n\r\nFrankly I am a stranger to this new, well, new to me, typophile
    forum format. How do you \u201Cpost a scan\u201D on this page?.\r\n\r\nI fear
    little can be learned from cutting cards alone. Side bearings husband the fit
    tables. Wedge choice dictate units rows, the two are married. I am not sure if
    you are conversant with the unit systems of Monotype, Linotype etc. Also, don't
    be fooled, ATF had their own unit system that made casting more efficient. They
    claimed it made hand setting quicker which was true, but incidental. Monotype
    display casters used a unit system somewhat like the ATF system\r\n\r\nCutting
    cards and patterns froze the decision making. They do not contain previous human
    input, judgment and trial and error. Those would be recorded in the records themselves.
    The cutting cards encapsulate the final decision only. Also, although mathematics
    will be helpful in deciphering optical scaling you will find that human input
    is greater than you may have imagined. You will be looking at statistic population
    of coincidence to conclude any final theory.\r\n\r\nI am not trying to discourage
    you, I have proposed optical scaling for digital type for many years. I do have
    a suggestion for you however.\r\n\r\nThe English Monotype System is intact in
    London. Perhaps a trip is in order. They also have several people that are conversant
    with the Benton and optical scaling.\r\n\r\n\u201CThink Times, Centaur\u201D.\r\n\r\nGerald

    the Merganthaler Linotype materials, including tons, it seems, of drawings. I

    good stuff also, and a primary supplier to Newspapers would I suspect be particularly
    good on small sizes of type. '
