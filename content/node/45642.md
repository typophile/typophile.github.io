  body: "For me, anyway, your question isn't clear. Do you mean \"create\" a new Unicode
    number, such as F0000? No, you can't do that, just like you couldn't create a
    \"new\" ASCII character -- a standard is just that. The only exception is private
    use Unicode numbers, already provided for in the standard, such as E100 etc. \r\n\r\nBut
    if you mean assign (correctly) an existing Unicode number, sure, just as you would
    assign a new name. On the PC, the window comes up using \"alt+G+R\" (alt glyph
    rename)."
