  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Hi everybody!

[EDIT]
New question below, a bit related, but actually independent from the initial post
[/EDIT]

<strong>short version</strong>
I need a font for a novel. Genre Distopia (like Fahrenheit 451, 1984, you get the genre). I must not be expensive. Would like to avid bundled and be individual. Thought about [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/dstype/capsa/|Capsa]], because it is a book-font and price is right. It is darker though than any other text-font I know. Is it too dark; for which printing conditions? How would you rate it's quality (low on myfonts, why?)

Then: Different suggestions, different style recommended? Suggestions for a cyrillic font as well?

<strong>initial post</strong>
<!--break-->
I am looking for a font for the small scale publishing of a novel. The book is a distopia about a future world of consumerism, about a dictator brought to life again and controlled as a puppet. I am not connected with writing it, so please forgive I can't explain the plot better, as I don't have too much insight in the writing process. 

Anyhow the budget is limited, I am basically looking for a classic looking text font, easy to read. I thought it would be nice to have something which is classic, and somehow in contrast to a futuristic topic, as it reminds of the time before the novel sets place and how the society in the novel could develop in this direction. Maybe that is a misleading though, maybe something more edgy and modern would be better, I am open for suggestions.

I was interested in <strong>Capsa</strong> by DStype [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/dstype/capsa/|on <strong>myfonts</strong> for example]], but I hesitate a bit. 

The price for roman and italics with 26$ each is quite right, that's why I consider it. My concerns are firstly I don't know if it suits the function as a book face. I know book faces are supposed to be darker, but this particular one is quite dark, even compared to Arno Pro, MVB Verdigris and similar darker faces. Isn't it too dark almost for the contemporary reader out there?
Is there any advise why the font per se would be not a good font, as the rating is quite low? It seems to be a quality product, but I am not an expert, what is your opinion?


Or any other proposals? Anything more modern or a different classic book font?

And a second question, for this project we would need as well a fitting cyrillic font, classical or modern, I don't know as I am not a native cyrillic reader. I thought about [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/fontfont/maiola/regular/?testdrive=seed%3D31%26dock%3Dfalse%26size%3D72%26w%3D720%26src%3Dpangram.7%26text%3D%255B%25D0%25A0%25D1%2583%25D1%2581%25D1%2581%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B9%2520(Russian)%255D%26fg%3D000000%26bg%3Dffffff%26goodies%3Dot.liga|<strong>Maiola</strong>]] or [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/alexandra-korolkova/leksa/regular/?testdrive=dock%3Dfalse%26size%3D72%26w%3D720%26src%3Dpangram.7%26text%3D%255B%25D0%25A0%25D1%2583%25D1%2581%25D1%2581%25D0%25BA%25D0%25B8%25D0%25B9%2520(Russian)%255D%26fg%3D000000%26bg%3Dffffff%26goodies%3Dot.liga%26seed%3D41|<strong>Leksa</strong>]] maybe, but I would appreciate some help here, as I really don't know a lot about cyrillic type design.</div>

Therefore for now, out of practical curiosity, I really would appreciate an educated estimation of one of you professionals how a font like Capsa would look on paper. Again it is the darkest typeface I saw in the tradition of Old-Style serif font made for body text! Is it too dark? I like it because it is very similar to Sabon actually, but a bit more "organic" meaning less straight cut, if that makes sense. So it seems warmer than Sabon, without being to playful. Just the color puzzles me. Please type-professionals, your opinion!

		<div class="commentbody">The question of typographic "color" is complicated because it is affected by what size you want to set the type, and the leading. If you have a dark type like Quadraat, and set it relatively small with generous leading, then it won't be too dark. The best thing is to see printed examples, and then you can really judge. If someone here has used Capsa they could tell you better.   

Also the texture on the page is a matter of how the contrast of thick and thin, horizontal and vertical are handled. For example, my Williams Caslon looks dark but has stems that are not thick—you can see the effect in [[http://typophile.com/node/65216|this thread]]. </div>

		<div class="commentbody">Hi everybody again!

As the project is getting on the way, the question is still current. In the meanwhile I came across a beautiful wedge serif with cyrillic and latis script! It seems to be a right mix between a classic "skeleton" and a contemporary wedge finish in details/terminals/curves. 

The only problem, this font is not completed yet, here is a preview of "Florian": http://www.behance.net/gallery/Florian-Family/548744

It looks amazing to me, but I was wandering if anybody knows something similar, at least for the latin script. No matter which font will be used in the end, I would just like to know some similar alternatives. 

Thanks to everybody!</div>

About Capsa, maybe [[http://www.dstype.com/profile.php|Dino dos Santos]] know some publishings where his font was used. I think Capsa is really beautiful, but is darker than most text faces and would work well just in quality prints and when properly typeset.

Recently I decided to add Cyrillic support to my under-development [[http://www.typophile.com/node/67787|font]], but I believe its design is very orthodox to the kind of typefaces you look for.</div>
