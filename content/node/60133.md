  body: Great idea! Unfortunately they didn't try this with only two points. It would
    have resulted in nicer letterforms, with contrast.

  body: Why would you digitize this? It looks like a font that anyone would drawn
    if they were bored, with a handful of crayons.

    like the result, but maybe the important thing is the process and the concept
    behind it."

  body: "This looks fun. \r\n\r\nAlthough I might not do this for my own design to
    be released, (agree with Wesley- You can achieve similar results by all kind of
    methods- rolling a boat on still water, have your son ride his bicycle on a wet
    ground after rain, paint an ant black and get it to trace some letter tracks with
    sugar on it, etc... they are pretty much the same thing. )  however, I don't mind
    if Toyota were to commission me to do it and pay me big, at the same time I can
    have some fun as well... why not? \r\n\r\nweng"
