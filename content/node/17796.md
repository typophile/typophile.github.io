body: "Hello all - Here's what I am trying to do. For the past 7 years, we have been
  using Suitcase and have changed our font library of Postscript Type 1 Outlines and
  suitcases so that when a typesetter brings up the Quark Character box they can choose
  a font by typing very little. For example:  a1helv = Helv regular, a2helv italic
  = Helv Italic, bb1Eras Regular = Eras Regular - This system has worked great for
  us in OS8 - OS9.2, but for OS 10.4 that we are changing to for Quark 6.5, all of
  my fonts are working the same way using Font Book and Suitcase Fusion v1 except
  for about 3-4 of them. In particular Helv italic and Times Italic appear everywhere
  but give a \"May be corrupt and substituted by Courier\" message when printing out
  of Quark. I've purchased Linotype Helveticas yesterday in an OpenType flavor and
  cannot seem to figure out how to change the name that appears in the Quark menus
  correctly. We do about 400 orders a day and have a back-catalogue of half a  million
  orders so I would love anyones input in how to proceed. I am not against buying
  FontLab but I did try with the demo to open a good Helv Italic face and change it
  to an a2 named font but my resulting Type1 and Truetype fonts didn't seem to work
  , but that could have been \"operator error\" as I am not the least bit familiar
  for all those options and setting :)\r\nthanks\r\nJim Robidoux\r\njim@bcecards.com\r\nDerry,

  body: Thanks Mark, but the FontSilencerXT will not allow valid corrupt fonts to
    be announced and we take many customer fonts for their jobs - The folks at FontLab
    suggested I buy TypeTool 2 for the Mac for renaming. What I thought I could do
    but hasn't worked yet is to open a viable Helvetica Oblique and basically just
    change the correct names within the font to the a2HelveOblique that I need and
    re-export it to the a "noncorrupt" font. The ID names and numbers in Quark are
    very particular so I haven't gotten this to work yet. Anyone have any ideas??
    Thanks
