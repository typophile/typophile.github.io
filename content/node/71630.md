  typography and happened to find something called FontForge to play with.\r\n\r\nThis
  is my first font. Today I want to learn basics about spacing, so I typed a line
  of \"noonnoon\"s. Here comes a problem. My font begins with this strange-shaped
  /o/, so I don't want to change it. Does this /o/ look fit with my /n/? Is there
  any suggestions to make this /n/ better fit? Finally, how is the current spacing
  looking?\r\n\r\nCritiques welcomed and wanted! Thank you all!"

  body: "Welcome to Typophile, and have fun developing your first typeface. \r\nPersonally,
    I don't think the two go well together, but that is always hard to tell with only
    two letters. You will get more useful feedback when you come up with, say, ten
    glyphs (or letter shapes).\r\n\r\nMy recommendation, when starting a font around
    the idea of a single letter form, continue with similar forms first (round shapes
    like e, c, b, s etc.) before starting with the more remote shapes. Good luck and
    let uns see how it develops.\r\n\r\nAndreas"

  body: I agree that more glyphs would be helpful to determine if these shapes can
    play together. As for the spacing, the /o/s look too close together, don't they?

    with more characters. They were made quite some time before, though.\r\n\r\neliason:\r\n\r\nSo
    increasing the side bearing of /o/ and decreasing that of /n/ will benefit, am
    I right?"

  body: "Yang, is this for text or display?\r\n\r\nFor text the most important thing
    is subtlety. It's not that\r\nyou can't have unorthodox shapes, it's that they
    have to\r\nbe applied with the gentlest hand.\r\n\r\nIn contrast, for a display
    face any unorthodoxy has to be\r\nobvious, and it has to be applied consistently.\r\n\r\nSo
    for example your \"egg\" motif could be applied to certain\r\nimportant characters
    if this is a text face; things like the \"n\"\r\ndon't absolutely need to have
    it. But if this is a display face\r\nmaking the \"n\" wider at the bottom might
    be a good idea.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: Because the other shapes are unconventional, the more conventional n looks
    like he's come to the wrong party with the wrong clothes. I think the n needs
    to be more wild and crazy, but I suspect that you'll have to take it a different
    direction than the o to make it work. Eg make it wider but bring the right foot
    in--which it was once in manuscript form. This is nicely inventive, but needs
    more discipline, once you figure out how to make the forms play together. You
    might have a look at both [[http://www.fontshop.com/fontlist/super_families/ff_fontesque/|Fontesque]]
    and [[http://www.fontshop.com/search/?q=hobo|Hobo]].
