  In the middle you see a ultra condensed version to it, quite interesting difference
  only (?) in the A crossbar shape between the two of them. \r\nDunno if it's classified
  as a fraktur? Also interested in similar typefaces.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/FONT1_4794.png]\r\n\r\n\r\n2\_\u2013\_Also.
  the \"Tom Ford\" typeface is so amazing. I got a vainy same style in Holt Sans,
  but Holt really feels less neat/stylish. \r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/FONT2_6000.png]"
