    the font?...

    Text SG</a> wouldn't be a terrible start.. but I don't think it's 100% correct.

  body: "wow ... how can this be ??\r\nI checked their site and it has nothing to
    do with SGI whatsover, but from I saw there (in image-text links) helped me ID
    the typeface as SGI 's custom designed font, by fellow Typophile Joe Stitzlein
    for Landor Associates.\r\n\r\nThe \"y\" is not flipped, that's how it appears
    in the typeface.\r\n\r\nI think someone should make them aware of this, SGI typeface
    is exclusively licensed to SGI. For reference, check out www.sgi.com."

      redesign their site, I think the person who made the last one was from somewhere
      in Europe.\r\n\r\nThanks for the info."
