<p>Here&rsquo;s a representative frame I grabbed from my DVD:</p>
<p>[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Superman_titles_original_3617.jpg]</p>
<p>As Bobby Henderson has said in the other thread, it looks a little like Gill Sans.</p>
<p>The closest overall match I&rsquo;ve been able to find is <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Granby<!-- raw HTML omitted --> (which according to <!-- raw HTML omitted -->this article<!-- raw HTML omitted --> was based in part on Gill Sans). But it&rsquo;s still significantly different from the original.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a quick-and-dirty rendition I&rsquo;ve thrown together using <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Granby EF Extra Bold<!-- raw HTML omitted -->:</p>
<p>[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Superman_titles_Granby_5558.jpg]</p>
<p>If it looks a little odd, it&rsquo;s because I&rsquo;ve fudged the spacing to match that of the original &ndash; which doesn&rsquo;t really work, since the widths of many of the individual characters don&rsquo;t match. I&rsquo;ve avoided the temptation to stretch or squoosh anything to make the spacing look better.</p>
<p>As you can see, some of the characters, such as <!-- raw HTML omitted -->P<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and <!-- raw HTML omitted -->R<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, are way off.</p>
<p>Can anyone find a closer match?</p>
</div>

   <div class="comment card m-3">
	<div class="card-body">
		<div class="commentbody"><p>FWIW I think you have found the closest match. Gotham and Govan have rather similar letterforms, but are not as close as Granby (and too new to be used for the movie, which was made in 1978). Granby Medium has more open counters and the R leg farther from the stem, but other proportions and letters like the J and C seem less like the Extra Bold. It&rsquo;s probable that photolettering was used at that time, and tweaking widths might have been relatively easy, but the wide variety of Sans faces available to them may have included this exact typeface, but I was unable to locate the match in my Photolettering catalogs in a cursory scan. Perhaps more detailed hunt would locate it, but my point is that you have probably found the closest digital font match.</p>

The samples do not show the J, which would be the other clincher.</p>
<p>Since Photo-Lettering wasn&rsquo;t the only one making film types, this may not mean much in terms of my basic point &ndash; that you have probably found the best available digital equivalent.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Thanks for your responses, guys.</p>
<p>Chris: It&rsquo;s not a screen grab of a DVD played onscreen; it&rsquo;s a frame grab from the DVD MPEG2 video stream itself, which I have then manually cropped and stretched to the proper aspect ratio. (The DVD is encoded in anamorphic widescreen, so it is easy to figure out precisely how much to crop and stretch, by using simple arithmetic.) The resulting frame has an aspect ratio of 2.32:1, which is only around 1% off the original theatrical aspect ratio of 2.35:1. The tiny discrepancy can be accounted for by small roundoff errors introduced by encoding into the relatively low-resolution DVD frame. Whatever distortion is present should be visually negligible &ndash; certainly not enough to account for the large differences seen in Granby EF Extra Bold. I suspect that the internal inconsistencies you&rsquo;ve pointed out in <!-- raw HTML omitted -->C<!-- raw HTML omitted --> et al. were already present in the original film.</p>
<p>Mike: Thanks for taking the time to go through your catalogs. It&rsquo;s good to hear confirmation that I have likely already found the closest digital equivalent. I do have to admit that I&rsquo;m curious about this Bryant Open family that you&rsquo;ve managed to find. If it&rsquo;s not too much to ask, would it be possible for you to upload some scans if you have the time? I&rsquo;m idly considering a personal project to render my own version of the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Superman Returns<!-- raw HTML omitted --> main title sequence in a more faithful <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Superman: The Movie<!-- raw HTML omitted --> style. Access to clean facsimiles of the original letterforms would be a big time saver.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>The problem is that no complete showings are presented in these catalogs. Volume 2, where I found these does include some very tiny samples in the back of the book that show other letters from each typeface, but even there the samples do not show the entire alphabet. I am not claiming that this is the exact typeface used, but it seems very close, and shows that there was a wider variety of film-typefaces than were ever converted to digital format.</p>
<p>As for making a scan, I&rsquo;d be happy to do it, but I can&rsquo;t upload it to this thread, because this new &lsquo;improved&rsquo; Typophile only allows that with newer operating systems than mine. I will have to set up a web page for it, and maybe someone can copy and post it.</p>

<p>Wes, the end-result of the project I was talking about was not the font itself but rather a full replacement main title sequence for <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Superman Returns<!-- raw HTML omitted --> in the style of the original <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Superman: The Movie<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.</p>
<p>Considering that I&rsquo;d pretty much have to make the font in order to be able to do that, it would be a shame if I kept the font to myself. Unfortunately, I didn&rsquo;t design Bryant Open, so I think the legality of releasing a digital version of the font might be dubious. (And if I also used Granby as a basis for the missing letters&hellip; well, I didn&rsquo;t design that either.)</p>
<p>Am I correct in my thinking? Thoughts, anyone?</p>

<p>However, legality aside, is it <!-- raw HTML omitted -->right<!-- raw HTML omitted -->? I don&rsquo;t know. My feeling is that this is a gray area. It seems that as long as a type design is sufficiently old (e.g., Garamond), no one has a problem with it being digitized and sold for profit by a multitude of independent outfits. When a design is relatively new (e.g., Palatino), redigitizations are heavily looked down upon &ndash; even if they share no curves or points, and have a completely different name.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Well, I share your view. I think that&rsquo;s the high road. Especially if a digitization exists. For something that existed only as metal or film type, it&rsquo;s not quite as clear to me.  People do &lsquo;revivals&rsquo; of old designs.</p>
<p>What is the dividing line, or other criteria, that makes a revival OK?</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>If what you want is already available in digital form, it is easier and cheaper to buy it. But, if what you want does not exist then it seems designing it is fair game.  The trouble comes if it is a derivative work of something out there.  Where this line falls would best be answered by Mr. Martinez, THE lawyer for type design issues (he recently spoke at TypeCon&ndash;photo by Eben Sorkin).</p>
<p>Legal issues aside, ethically, I think you would have to get permission from the originator of the work you wish to emulate.</p>
