  figure out where I got it from and whether or not it's legit. I can't seem to get
  any font info on my home PC (no font managment). I'm wondering whether anyone knows
  if it has been bundled with any Adobe products / MS products in the past.\r\ncheers\r\n\r\n--N"

    fonts in the past with an issue of Computer Arts magazine."
