  <BR> <BR>I need it for a typesetting project. Any ideas would be appreciated!'

  body: I&#39;m posting the font I&#39;m looking for over top of the best match so
    far, Harrowgate. The lowercase h is very different, and the uppercase B doesn&#39;t
    match. Also I can&#39;t tell if the tops of the stems of the b,h, etc. have those
    little flares. If anyone recognizes this lowercase h, please let me know! <BR>

  body: I think you&#39;ve done  very well to get that close to something that was
    printed over 150 &#40;?&#41; years ago. I can&#39;t find anything closer.  It&#39;s
    hard to understand why &#39;a typesetting project&#39; would require you to get
    closer than you have.

  body: I&#39;m not sure I understand that. The &#39;authors&#39; cannot be Melville
    or Hawthorne, so whose inscription are you trying to replicate? <BR> <BR>What
    is the age of the inscription?  <BR> <BR>Do the &#39;authors&#39; know that not
    all type has been converted to digital form, and that finding metal type that
    matches might be almost impossible? <BR> <BR>I have looked at ALL the blackletter
    typefaces in Mac McGrew&#39;s book of &#39;American Metal Typefaces of the 20th
    Century&#39; and nothing matches, even though many of the types originated back
    into the 19th century. So it suggests that this was not American type, or it was
    an antique type that was no longer used into the 20th century, or it was hand-lettered.
    &#40;I know it looks very uniform, but can you see the original? &#41; There were
    people who made their living lettering things like that by hand. Today, maybe
    they would be font designers. <BR> <BR>To me, something that adds to the hand-lettered
    idea is that the little dangling bit on the &#39;h&#39; is very similar to Engraver&#39;s
    Old English, but shows the pen&#39;s limitations on trying to imitate such a fine
    &#39;stroke&#39;. The B in your sample also seems somehat simplified, or poorly
    copied from the original model the lettering artist may have been using, if we
    assume it looked like &#39;Harrowgate&#39;.  <BR> <BR>I still feel &#40;maybe
    because I am not trying to make your life hell&#41; that you have come remarkably
    close, and that I would probably not notice the differences unless I were looking
    at the two samples side by side.

    <BR>Oops, sorry, that is confusing. They&#39;re making an annotated edition. The
    inscription is indeed the original from Melville. <BR> <BR>Thank you so much for
    checking for me! I feel more confident saying &#34;accept this close proximation,
    or settle for a ratty scan.&#34;'

  body: well one more option... you can always tweak the outlines in Illustrator to
    make it match. I don&#39;t see why more designers don&#39;t think of this option???
