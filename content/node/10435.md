body: Fortune, Volta, Consort, Farao, PNM Caecilia... I&#39;ve been on an Egyptian
  bender recently, but I keep coming back to Clarendon and its wonderful curves and
  contrasty stems. After spending all night looking at the diifferent versions of
  Clarendon available digitally, I&#39;m wondering if there&#39;s any meaningful difference
  between them in terms of quality or elegance of the typefaces themselves. URW has
  a billion different weights, AGFA/Monotype has both Monotype Clarendon and Monotype
  New Clarendon, and Elsner&#43;Flake offers their version in OpenType, albeit with
  no OpenType goodies as far as I can tell. <BR> <BR><a href="http://www.graphic-design.com/Type/Good-bad/fonts.html">Fred
  Showker says</a> egyptians should have slightly concave feet; do any of the digital
  cuts actually do this? Which, if any, of the metal types do? I looked in my Encyclopedia
  Of Typefaces and Rookledge&#39;s, and I think I see what he means, but maybe I&#39;m
  just suggestible. <BR> <BR>Why can&#39;t I find Fortune or the expanded weights
  of Consort available online / in digital form? They sure are pretty... instead I&#39;ve
  grabbed Volta and Farao. It generally doesn&#39;t take much persuading to get me
  to buy Storm fonts, and Farao manages to be warm and feminine and understated all
  at once.

  body: Sutro is nice, but it loses much of the quirkiness of Clarendon and feels
    too much like what it is, which is a Jim Parkinson face for use in magazines.
    It&#39;s clean and effective, but looking at it gives me bad flashbacks to boring
    profiles of alt.country bands in Rolling Stone and Magnet. The same goes for Humanist
    Slabserif 712 and Egyptian 505, although those seem like they&#39;d be useful
    in a lot of the same situations as PNM Caecilia, with a slightly less reserved
    character. <BR> <BR>Oxtail is brilliant. Thanks for bringing it to my attention,
    Yves! It&#39;s as playful as Farao but goes in a different direction. Since I
    just licensed Farao, though, I think I&#39;ll hold off on Oxtail for now. <BR>
    <BR>Still, what I was really looking for was feedback on the various digital cuts
    of Clarendon itself. I&#39;m attached to the weird thin stem of the r with its
    fat ball terminal, just like I&#39;m attached to the upturned tail of the a

    I&#39;m such a type slut. Both are beautiful and highly recommended.
