  body: "<em>Very Nice Nick - where do they come from -</em>\r\n\r\nOriginally, from
    Samuel Welo's <em>Studio Handbook</em> (1926); what you see is from an EPS file
    that's been sitting around on my hard drive for a couple of years, waiting for

    <a href=\"http://www.nga.gov/cgi-bin/psearch?Request=S&imageset=1&Person=68200\"
    target=\"_blank\">Paul Manship</a>, perhaps my favorite Art Deco sculptor (below,
    yet another piece of art without a home...)\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/dancer_6365.gif]"
