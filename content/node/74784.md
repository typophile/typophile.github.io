  yet, since I will make many updates and corrections along the next months. Thanks
  so much for the comments and advices, in the last weeks, here in Typophile, and
  other places, concerning my doubts while did make Penabico. So, thanks to Adam Twardoch,

  body: Thanks, riccard0. I will increase the free extras - but, in fact, they are
    no good than the main font. The "extras" are unfinished letters, without nodes
    treatment. In future, they will be updated to better shapes, and, ever free.

    Words will be increased in the next weeks. I think to add dozens of words and

    you understand mostly usable in Italian, with special the words usable at invitations,
    weddings and printed correspondence. The size of the list is in your own taste,
