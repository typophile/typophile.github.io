body: For my school's centennial, we're recreating the school newspaper's past nameplates,
  one in each new issue. The one we're up to (originally from around 1990, but I don't
  think we were digital at that point) uses [[Bookman]] Italic (<em>not</em> ITC Bookman)
  with some swash characters. In looking for a font online to approximate it, I've
  only been able to find Jukebox Type's <a href=http://www.veer.com/products/typedetail.aspx?image=JBT0000087>Bookman
  JF</a>, which does match it almost exactly. The problem is that the font family
  costs $119, which is out of my publication's price range (especially after buying
  Farnham and Mercury for our redesign). I was wondering if anyone knows of another
  digitization of Bookman that preserves the Th swash ligature and the R swashes present
  in the nameplate attached below. I haven't been able to find one after much searching,
  but maybe someone around here could help me out. Thanks very much in advance.

  body: I was thinking about that (although I'm more likely to get a better photo
    and clean up an autotrace of it), but I'm concerned that the swashes won't match
    the weight of the letters of the ITC Bookmans out there. Ultimately, I bet that
    it would be okay, but I figured that maybe there is someone out there who knows
    something I don't about the many versions of Bookman.

  body: I believe you can find these in the OpenType version of <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/showfont.cfm?fid=M.125834.0.2">ITC
    Bookman Italic</a> ($29). Contact FontShop for a sample.

  body: Thanks for the tip, Stephen. I can't find any PDFs or samples online that
    show swashes in the ITC Bookman OT fonts, so I'll try to e-mail FontShop. Crossing
    my fingers.

  body: You know, you're right. I think I will just get one of the ITC Bookman Swashes;
    I just frankly don't have the time or desire to invest this much time in making
    the nameplate as exact as possible. What I'll do is customize the swash R's by
    removing the lefthand swash, but I think I'll substitute ITC Bookman's Th lig
    for Bookman JF's lig (although I do prefer Bookman JF's). Thanks for all your
    suggestions.
