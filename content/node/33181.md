  I\u2019m trying to find an example to compare with his work at Penguin books. I
  don\u2019t care how obscure such a book might be\u2014it\u2019s worth a day at the
  Library of Congress."

  body: "James, while living in Basel and working for Birkh\xE4user Verlag, Tschichold
    did a lot of very ordinary and humble jobs such as the design for phone books
    and address books \u2013 jobs so normal and unobtrusive that hardly anyone would
    notice that the master had his hands on it. Later on, as you probably know, he
    worked in house for the chemical company \xBBCiba Geigy\xAB, where he designed
    dozens of reference and advertising works. I don\u2019t think that any of these
    works will be found in the States, but you\u2019ll get an idea by looking at his
    \xBBAusgew\xE4hlte Aufs\xE4tze \xFCber Fragen der Gestalt des Buches und der Typographie\xAB
    as well as his \xBBErfreuliche Drucksachen durch gute Typographie\xAB. I don\u2019t
    know whether they have already been translated. It somehow a relief to see that
    even the master did not work on Shakespeare or the likes every day.\r\n\r\nBest
    wishes\r\nFlorian  "
