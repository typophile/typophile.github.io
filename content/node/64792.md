  body: "Thanks Mike\r\n\r\nDynamo looks similar. I'll search by its tags or related
    fonts to that. A Bauhaus with serif I haven't found\r\n\r\nHouse Chalet? I don't
    match that site\r\n\r\nThat image is the only thing they could give me.. anyway,
    can you tell me exactly the piece of code you set here to display the image? I
    try putting html code <img></img> or bbcodes, with [[]] and [] but only displays
    the code as it is or nothing\r\n\r\nThanks for your patience"

    below the box where you enter your comment. If the image is a .gif or .jpg type
    then it will be shown as in my post above. I converted your .png image to a .gif
    with a software application on my Mac called Preview. There are other graphics
    applications that can do the same thing, including a tool called GraphicConverter
    from Lemke Software that is very reasonably priced.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
