body: I had a request for ID of a sample a few minutes ago. Most of the lettering
  is a font I know as Dragonwick/Dragonwyck, but the Q is something else. I know I
  have seen it somewhere, and I will probably smack my forehead when I hear the answer,
  but can you folks help me out with it?<img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/39506.gif"

    target="_blank">ITC Airstream</a>, which coincidently I first noticed on Milky
    Way Bars &#40;obviously not the logotype&#41; a few years ago. It does have that
    caramely look to it <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"

  body: No problem. Just to make you want one &#40;they&#39;re delicious&#41;, here&#39;s
    the milky way wrapper with the caramely airstream. I have the writing on the side,
    too but I can&#39;t find that picture.  <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/40046.gif"
