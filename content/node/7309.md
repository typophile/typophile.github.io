  body: Sorry, can&#39;t help you with the BC logo type. But the rest of the site
    uses various weights of Compacta as display type. And the numbers on the program
    are Bank Gothic.

  body: The cap S is reminiscent of <a href="http://www.bertholdtypes.com/bq_library/90058.html">Berthold
    City</a> with the absolute crap skewed out of it. Given the uneven widths and
    clunky appearence of the various characters, perhaps it&#39;s a custom job. <BR>
    <BR>As for the use of Bank Gothic, if you download the PDF of the media guide
    from the Fans Only site, you discover that they&#39;re using SSI&#39;s infamous
    Bank Gothic knockoff called Fortis Caps, not the real thing.

  body: The &#34;numbers&#34; I was mentioning on the second site was the jersey numbers
    sorry - it&#39;s in the same font as the &#34;Boston College&#34;  <BR>...just
    can&#39;t find a font with the bottom right &amp; top left corners rounded and
    the top right &amp; bottom left pointed... <BR> <BR>any other ideas?

    <BR>you might also look at <BR><a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/t26/blahaus/"

  body: I think it's named as "BC Eagles Bold" It was developed for the Boston College
    Eagles Athletic Department by Nike from 2000-01 until 2011-12. And to me, it nearly
    looks like a merged combo mix of Impact or Compacta with either Narrowbrand Prime
    or Blahaus (all italic and bold). After all, it is a custom font design for that
    university.
