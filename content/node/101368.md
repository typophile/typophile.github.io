body: Hey, so I'm trying to find out what this font is, its used by the band ayreon
  on their album covers. I would appreciate any help. I asked the main musician behind
  the band but he wasn't totally sure. He said it was based of old english, but thats
  the only clue I've got.

  body: "Oh one of my favourite albums of all time!\r\n\r\nDon't know about the font
    though :-) If Arjen doesn't know a particular font name, it's either based on
    any Old English type font and then heavily modified, or it's entirely custom.
    It's probably not a straightforward font either way."

  body: Thank you all for the help. Yeah, I would start out with probably Into the
    Electric Castle to get into the band. Or maybe The Human Equation. Human Equation
    is the one thats the most powerful emotional wise, but "Y" had some absolutely
    astounding songs on it. Then again, I like all of his work xD
