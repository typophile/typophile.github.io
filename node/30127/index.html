		<div class="commentbody">The term Egyptian arises from coincidental connection. Napoleon did a big PR tour that wound through Egypt where his archaeological team picked up and deciphered the Rosetta stone, which lead to a huge boom in Egyptology. At the time Egyptology was funded primarily via tomb robbing, so Britain was overwhelmed with looted Egyptian artifacts, sort of like Banshees albums in the 1980s. Slab serifs came and went along with the trend of propping a mummy up in the corner of one&rsquo;s dining room; and so the two are inextricably linked.</div>

<p>Since serif didn&rsquo;t become part of the English language until 30-odd years after Napoleon&rsquo;s invasion of Egypt was it referring to Egyptienne? But that is an interesting piece of research, let us know about it.

		<div class="commentbody"><p>And it&rsquo;s a Wikipedia entry with no citations&hellip; now that&rsquo;s a useless source if I ever saw one.</p>
<p>I double-checked in <em>Typographic Design,</em> <em>Stop Stealing Sheep,</em> <em>A Type Primer,</em> and <em>ETS 3.0</em> and there isn&rsquo;t a single mention of the idea that the name comes from the publications about Napoleon&rsquo;s journeys.</p>
<p>Google books has a scan of <a href="http://books.google.com/books?vid=OCLC25353829&id=Np0LAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA1&lpg=PA1&dq=Description+de+L%E2%80%99Egypte#PPA1,M1">Description de L’Egypte</a> and it is most certainly not printed with a slab face. <em>Typographic Design</em> presents the idea of a connection between popular type and Egypt mania, and since Meggs is one of the writers, I&rsquo;m sticking with that one.</p>
<p>Edit: The version on Google books is from 1845, the original was 1809. This still negates the story, as slabs appeared in 1815. I&rsquo;ll be at the Library of Congress next week and double check the 1809 edition, assuming that they have one.</p>

<p>Does it cite Napoleon&rsquo;s campaign as inspiring the name because it caused the Egyptian mania, or does it specifically cite <em>Description de L’Egypte</em>? <em>Graafisen tyylin perusteet</em><a href="http://worldcat.org/wcpa/oclc/9761429"> is in the Library of Congress as well as the Helsinki University library</a>, but there&rsquo;s no hope of me deciphering Finnish, are you interested in looking it up? Maybe we can put all this together into a short paper on the etymology—and misconceptions thereof—of the name Egyptian.</p>
<p>I think that the only thing that can really prove the Napoleon link is if the 1809 edition of <em>Description de L’Egypte</em> is in fact printed with slab type and someone can find a reputable original source. I&rsquo;ve located the book in the Library of Congress, it&rsquo;s too late to go today, I&rsquo;ll go check tomorrow.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t believe I&rsquo;ve turned into such a type nerd. But I have to spend my month-long Christmas break doing <em>something</em>.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Why slab?</p>
<p>Slabs serif faces were more often referred to as &ldquo;Antique&rdquo; in type specimens of the early 19th century.</p>
<p>The first sans serif type was published in a Caslon specimen of 1816 (there are no extant examples of it in use), and named &ldquo;Egyptian&rdquo;.</p>
<p>In applying the term &ldquo;Egyptian&rdquo; to a sans serif, at first, there may have been the association with something ancient and primitive &ndash; this is James Mosley&rsquo;s thesis for the cultural space the sans came from, as told in &ldquo;The Nymph and the Grot&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Updike (Printing Types, Volume II), mentions in an anecdotal footnote that in a &ldquo;London Jest Book&rdquo; of 1806 (unfortunately, an internet-quality reference&hellip;) there is a joke about an Irishman&rsquo;s reaction to a &ldquo;Fashionable Egyptian Sign Board&rdquo;. There is no way of knowing wheher the lettering thereon, in which the &ldquo;thin strokes were as thick as the thick strokes&rdquo; was a sans or slab. Anyway, the signpainters were ahead of the typefounders.</p>
<p>Updike conjectured that there was some racial correspondence between the dark weight of the style and the Egyptian term, however, this was probably the influence on him of a later 19th century concept, encapsulated in the term from the title of the explorer Stanley&rsquo;s book &ldquo;The Dark Continent&rdquo;, dark meaning undiscovered, unilluminated by civilization, and with dark-skinned inhabitants. However, even then this racist premise was often understood to refer to sub-Saharan Africa, not Egypt and the northern Arab territories.</p>
<p>There were in fact quite a few Egyptians in Paris in Napoleon&rsquo;s day &ndash; they were Mamelukes, a caucasian ethnic group, originally abducted to Egypt as slaves, but who had become its rulers. Many of them, male citizens of the Ottoman Empire, made their way to France with the returning French army, and subsequently formed a divsion in Napoleon&rsquo;s army, featuring prominently in military parades, their exotic uniforms creating a fashion craze. Girodet, a leading painter of the time, was fascinated by the Orient and had several of them living in his house &ndash; he did a series of portraits of them, and used his guests to populate his large painting &ldquo;The Revolt of Cairo&rdquo;. So in France at least, the Egyptian phenomenon was all about the exotic novelty of the Orient. And French fashions quickly crossed the Channel to London.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m sticking with the theory that while there may be several contributing factors to the Egyptian name, really it&rsquo;s just something that was trendy at the time, taken up by type founders because it looks cool in print (to typophiles) &ndash; the only word with three different consecutive letters with lower-case descenders. Eventually, it settled on the slab-serif genre.</p>
<p>Bear in mind that, as Alastair Johnston explained in &ldquo;Alphabets to Order&rdquo;, the people responsible for 19th century specimen books were dada poets.</p>

I would always take anything you find on the internet with a pinch of salt until you can confirm it from an alternative source.
On the other hand you have sparked some interesting discussion and investigation and have made an early New Year&rsquo;s resolution so hopefully you will be more welcome on the forums.

		<div class="commentbody"><p><em>For God’s sakes. Well, at least you inadvertently pointed to where you stole the image from.</em></p>
<p>Actually, I first came across it in another book, &ldquo;London, A Great City&rdquo; published by the Folio Society. Is scanning an image from a book and posting it on a web forum considered theft? I suppose I should have asked the Alfred Dunhill Museum for permission to reproduce their painting, but in reproducing low-res scans to illustrate a point in an online thread, I don&rsquo;t think people usually go to that length, so I&rsquo;m just following general practice. Or do you think one should do better?</p>
<p><em>By the way, printers’ ink balls.</em></p>
<p>Gosh.</p>
<p>Speaking of Mr Johnston&rsquo;s book, I came across this quote in it, from Richard Austin&rsquo;s &ldquo;Address to Printers&rdquo;, 1819, concerning the problems with the ultra fine details of modern type, &ldquo;Besides this, in the drawing of the letters, the true shape and beauty are lost; and instead of consisting of circles, and arcs of circles, so agreeable to the eye, some of them have more the appearance of Egyptian characters than good roman letter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Where did type founders of Austin&rsquo;s day get their knowledge of what an Egyptian character looked like? I would guess from Edmund Fry&rsquo;s &ldquo;Pantographia&rdquo;, published in 1799 if I recall correctly, which attempted to show all the alphabets used by all languages around the world. So I wonder what the page(s) on Egyptian type look like in Fry&rsquo;s book?</p>
<p><em>slab serif and egyptian are synonyms,</em></p>
<p>That&rsquo;s always beeen my understanding. I named my slab-serif take on Bodoni &ldquo;Egyptian&rdquo; partly for that reason, as well as others, but most logically because the serifs don&rsquo;t look at all like slabs in the Light and Thin weights.</p>
<p>But for encompassing a variety of typefaces, rather than weights, &ldquo;Slab&rdquo; is more practical, which is no doubt why the FontBook uses it as a category, to include many hefty-serifed faces (eg for news text) that are not at all &ldquo;Egyptian&rdquo;.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been a nerd a lot longer than the last couple of days. It&rsquo;s just that lately I&rsquo;ve gone from other sorts of nerdness to being a type nerd. Unfortunately my nerdiness today has been limited to reading Leslie Cabarga&rsquo;s book, as I arrived at the Library of Congress only to find that the reading rooms are closed on weekends!</p>
<p>Anyway, Mr. Heller suggested that I contact Matthew Carter; if someone has Mr. Carter&rsquo;s email address would you please message it to me?</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Matthew Carter has responded. According to James Mosley in <em>The Nymph and the Grot</em> (Available from St. Bride) the term Egyptian was originally used for sans-serif faces; I think that this pretty much kills the theory that it resulted from use in Napoleonic texts as no typesetter would have used sans type for a serious book (if any book) at that time.</p>
<p>Unfortunately the closest copy of <em>The Nymph and the Grot</em> is in Baltimore, so I&rsquo;ll just order copy and wait for it to arrive.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I’m not sure I can follow that without blushing. In any case I have been reading Typophile Forum to learn, rather than to offer my opinions. (I do enough of that in my job.) But it’s true that having seen a recommendation that people should go out and get hold of The Nymph and the Grot (1999) I thought, first of all, that the book may not be so easy to get hold of (but don’t let me put anyone off buying it – sales help the St Bride Library). Secondly, that some interesting things about early sanserifs (or Egyptians) and slab-serifs were found after it was published – many of them by Justin Howes. If he had not died so shockingly suddenly a couple of years ago he might have contributed to this thread. Should have, for sure.</p>
<p>So I thought of doing so myself, and signed up – but then my piece got far too long to post, so I put it under the heading ‘The Nymph and the Grot, an update’ on the Typefoundry blog (<a href="http://typefoundry.blogspot.com/)">http://typefoundry.blogspot.com/)</a>. That is where to find it, along with some other miscellaneous things. It won’t be the last word on the topic (I hope), but may answer some questions.</p>

<p>I am very happy to hear that Justin Howe’s research did not get lost with his untimely death. He was supposed to give a talk at the St Bride conference in 2004 about his research, but he was ill that day. A few weeks before his death, when he was still curator at the Type Museum in London, I visited the Type Museum. In the generous manner that was typical of him, he gave me a short presentation about the talk he wanted to give at St Bride – essentially the same information that you published now on your blog. Of course, in my stupidity, I didn’t write anything down, and when he died, I already thought this information was lost forever. Justin had also prepared some new illustrations for his talk which he showed me on his power book. I hope, one day you can publish these illustrations as well, in memory of Justin…</p>
<p>Here are some pictures of the type specimen and the matrices of Caslon Egyptian, taken by Justin. The type specimen and the matrices are at the Type Museum. If we compare the printed letters with the matrices, the newly added characters (described in the article on James Mosley’s blog) can be seen clearly.</p>

<p>Caslon&rsquo;s &ldquo;Egyptian&rdquo;, it must be assumed, is not then an experiment that merely chops the serifs off a slab-serif style &ndash; which seems to be the consensus in the general type histories &ndash; it is a mature design, derived from many decades of development by architects, sign painters, cartographers and stone masons. Tombstones are another, clearly dated, source of 18th century sans lettering.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>&ldquo;Caslon’s “Egyptian”, it must be assumed, is not then an experiment that merely chops the serifs off a slab-serif style&rdquo;</p>
<p>No – that was the bright idea of the type historian A. F. Johnson, who dated the Figgins slab-serif 1815 (which is on the title page of the specimen) and the Caslon sanserif 1816. Therefore&hellip; But it helps to get outside the typefoundry and to look around a bit.</p>
<p>One of my favourite images is this one (which I put in the original Nymph &amp; Grot), published in 1808, a project for a vast pyramid outside Portsmouth, the Royal Navy base, to commemorate Nelson at Trafalgar and Stuart at Maida (no, I had never heard of him either – but there is Maida Vale in London as well as Trafalgar Square). The pyramid makes an Egyptian connection, but the lettering was described as &lsquo;the earliest form of Roman character&rsquo;.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sorry this one never got built – but there are plenty of other examples of sanserifs before 1816, ususally conveying some idea of an early and &lsquo;primitive&rsquo; form. Not unrelated to Tschichold&rsquo;s idea of the Grotesk as pure and basic, in some ways.![](/images/old-images/Wood - Pyramid_4860.jpg)</p>

Here is one curious example, dated 1799, from a monument to Field-Marshal Rumyantsev-Zadunaisky in St. Petersburg. I don't think its style conveys an idea of an early and primitive form. Of course, this is not a real sans-serif, but it is not a serif either. And look at that super-tight letterspacing.

Obviously apart from the blog (for which I have boundless admiration) this image greatly enriches the present discussion. And what a charming and highly interesting piece of ephemeral printing it is too. Look at the pound sign (like some of the pre-euro Italian Lira signs). I&rsquo;ve never seen a lottery bill in two colours either. Justin really was quite a sleuth to have unearthed it.</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Ok, my post comes some 2 years too late but I would like to add a comment and a source to this thread:</p>
<p>— my source is Alan Bartram: The English lettering tradition from 1700 to present day. Lund Humphries Publishers Ltd., London 1986</p>
<p>— Egyptomania: in the time right before Egyptomania, there had been a very strong Greece-o-mania, regularly refered to as Philhellenism. This movement, it seems, was quite influencial among British intellectuals. Quotes from page 12:</p>
<p>“ By the early nineteenth century, commerce and industry required more agggressive letterforms. At the same time architects, aided by the intelligentsia, developed theories about primitive and elemental simplicity, such as (they believed) the currently fashionable Greek idiom displayed. Thus was developed the idea of a simple, more rational (and therefore more “Greek”) form: what we now call the grotesque, that is, a letterform, often monoline in colour, with no serifs. Egyptians, as has been said earlier, are grotesques with serifs. That such letterforms are more suitable for architecture is indisputable. But, besides beeing more architectural, they could take on forms which were far more aggressive than the civilised and refined english letter. So a letterform dreamt up to solve an intellectual and archaeological postulation was seized upon by signwriters and, soon, printers, to perform deeds quite beyond, in fact almost contradictory, to its civilised progenitors’ ideas. ”</p>
<p>“The classical revival was soon reflected in the work of architects. By 1789 Sir John Soane was using a carefully drawn sans-serif letter in his drawings, both as titling and also on occasion as an inscription on the building itself. About the same time, sans-serif lettering began to appear on sculptural monuments. By 1806, rude remarks were beeing made about the current shop boards displaying ‚common characters deprived of all beauty and all proportion by having all the strokes of equal thickness‘. The grotesque (and, probably a little later, the egyptian) had arrrived in town.”</p>
<p>— I would like to add that there might have also been some more direct inspiration by original, ancient greek inscriptions that show capital letter-forms without serifs. Also the early Roman inscriptions (lapis niger) where not yet serifed. And finally greek inscriptions could have also been found in Egypt, as it belonged to the greek world from Alexanders conquest to the Roman take-over and later again for some time under byzantine rule. But the latter is mere speculation.</p>
<p>— As far as the slab-serifed forms are concerned, I’d like to add that the principle of emphasising the Serifs already showed up in the ornate flowerish Caps forms of copperplate engraving. There is a huge unresearched field here. In the 17th and 18th centuries, lots of phantasy-enhanced forms evolved that later got translated to printing type (Pierre Simon Fournier probably beeing the first). Engravers were the earliest advertisers (so-called enseignes-adresses, handbills for businesses) and their models were largely copied by early letter painters, who then modified these forms for public space application (less sophisticated in construction and detail, but poignant in shape and often enhanced in visibility by application of 3-d effects or colouring).</p>
<p>In my oppinion, most of the early 19th century type designs must be seen as the attempt of book printers to get their share in the booming market for printed advertising. Therefore they copied the engravers’ and letterpainters’ forms that had long been arround outside the type world.</p>
<p>I agree with James Mosley that we urgently need to leave the specimen books and get a larger view of letter forms beyond type itself.</p>

<p>This picture shows a 18th century sign from Paris that I took at Musée Carnavalet in Paris in 2005. It is registered in the catalogue: Enseignes du Musée Carnavalet – Histoire de Paris, Jean Pierre Willesme/Paris musée, 1995, page 57.</p>
<p>It could be an evidence that the sans was also in French streets before it showed up in type specimen books. On the other hand, the picture in the catalogue shows a whole different design in a black and and white photograph. So it still needs to be clarified if this sign had been altered by restaurators or alike.</p>
