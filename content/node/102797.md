  there is a bit of controversy weather or not to use the Capital Eszett or simply
  replace it with SS. That being said, how do you deal with substituting the Cap for
  the lowercase in the OpenType code? Which way makes the most sense and why?"

    code</em>\r\n\r\nYou don't. Case conversion is a character operation in software,
    not a glyph substitution operation. The only thing you need to do design the uppercase
    eszett and map it to the appropriate Unicode character in the cmap table. If you
    want to have a smallcap version too, then you do a standard {c2sc} substitution
    from the uppercase eszett to the smallcap version. It is up to the software to
    look after case conversion, which the Unicode standard defines, following the
    German DIN, as \xDF -> SS. The uppercase eszett character exists as an encoding
    option for users who want it, and for non-standard case conversion, sorting and
    comparison operations (which may become de facto standards over time, but never
    in Unicode because of text stability requirements)."
