  <BR> <BR>I&#39;d never been to this site before today. What a treat. Dennis Ortiz-Lopez
  has done it all and if you don&#39;t believe, check it out. Ortiz-Lopez estimates
  he has created 600 typefaces in his career, most of them built on a grid in Fontographer.
  <BR> <BR>some of his type is at <BR><A HREF="http://ortiz-lopez.com/OLFOLPOLH.html"

  body: ' &#62; &#34;I don&#39;t love type. Type is dull.&#34; <BR> <BR>There is something
    to that. But only if: <BR>1. You&#39;re not interested in aesthetics, and <BR>2.
    You&#39;re not interested in functionality. <BR>Maybe he&#39;d be happier as an
    accountant? <BR> <BR>Sure, simply making fonts for the market, without an appreciation
    for Shape and/or without an understanding of reading is indeed very boring - it&#39;s
    like being a grocery bag boy &#40;and many of those fonts would indeed look smashing
    on grocery bags&#41;. I personally try to express the power of shapes, but am
    also very grateful for my innate curiosity of how things work deep down. <BR>

    provide more context. I think this is a fa&ccedil;ade, in a way, to keep people
    from thinking that he is a complete freak like the rest of us! <BR> <BR>but his
    talent and accomplishments are undeniable '

  body: I&#39;ve had the pleasure of working with Dennis on custom type commissions
    during my ad agency days, and then during my tenure at Phil&#39;s Fonts, a distributor
    of his retail fonts. Dennis &#42;is&#42; a complete freak, but a wonderful, trippy
    guy with a great and twisted sense of humor... talk to him on the phone for 5
    minutes, and you&#39;ll be in another world. His type treatments and logotypes
    for pubs are inspiring, and works of art in themselves; his layered typefaces
    are really fun to play with. <BR> <BR>My only complaint about Dennis&#39; work
    is his aversion to creating characters other than the basic alphanumerics for
    fonts that are to be sold commercially... I don&#39;t know if he&#39;s gotten
    past that, but it used to drive me nuts...

    <BR> <BR>That&#39;s very strange, considering he&#39;s made Hebrew fonts. <BR>

  body: ' Aversion probably isn&#39;t the right word - I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s
    conscious or not, or simply the result of being too busy, or getting distracted
    by another project, etc. Anyone who&#39;s done 600 well-drawn typefaces is probably
    going to take shortcuts to remain so prolific. I know nothing about the character
    sets in Dennis&#39; Hebrew types - I only have experience with his Latin designs
    and revivals. <BR> <BR>Commercial types in particular should have a full character
    set with basic punctuation, currency, etc., whether Latin or non-Latin. This is
    merely my humble opinion as a typographer, a graphic designer, and as someone
    who works with type designers in getting fonts prepped for market. It&#39;s a
    bummer to find the perfect typeface for a project, only to discover that it&#39;s
    missing the question mark or &#34;curly quotes.&#34; '
