  body: If you make the caps as high as the ascenders, in real text &#40;as opposed
    to in something like a poster where lining things up might be great&#41; they
    look too big, reducing readability. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>

    is usually paramount.  <BR> <BR>But ascenders can be exactly the same height as
    cap H, successfully. As long as the stem weights of the caps &#40;like H, with
    its vertical straights&#41; are properly balanced with the &#40;slightly thinner&#41;
    weight of the lowercase letters with vertical stems, it can work fine. <BR> <BR>The
    same applies to italics and obliques. <BR> <BR>For a very interesting, decades
    old and quite delightful experiment with ascender/descender variance, look at
    the typeface series called &#39;Parsons&#39;. <BR> <BR>Try to find an original
    cut, or an original type specimen or promotional booklet from the founder, showing
    all the designed alternates.  <BR> <BR>It&#39;s a lovely thing, really. <BR> <BR>Joe

    long as the stem weights .... <BR> <BR>I don&#39;t see it as a weight issue -
    instead it&#39;s a matter of proportions: caps generally fill most of the rectangle
    defined by their width and height, while lc characters fill the x-height or at
    most the x-height and a stick to the ascender height &#40;except the wonderful
    &#34;f&#34;&#41;. So the only way you can safely match the cap and ascender heights
    &#40;in a text face&#41; is if: the lc x-height is very large and/or the caps
    are very narrow. But the former is damaging to readability while the latter is
    usually aesthetically fatal. <BR> <BR>&#62; ascender/descender variance <BR> <BR>Such
    variance is sady under-rated, in this Modernist era of regularity. ATF Garamond
    &#40;AKA Garamond #3&#41; has some amazing ascender variance, even though aesthetically
    I wouldn&#39;t touch it with a 10-foot composing stick. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>'
