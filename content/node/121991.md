    with very similar proportions are the slab serifs Donnerstag and Aviano Slab:\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/insigne/donnerstag/\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/insigne/aviano-slab/\r\n\r\nYou\u2019d
    have to do some serious editing to them to match the logo\u2014widen (Donnerstag),
    edit the serifs and round off the serif transitions.\r\n\r\nEDIT: Based on Don\u2019s
    samples, Aviano Wedge might make a good base, as well:\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/insigne/aviano-wedge/\r\n\r\nColumbia
    Titling is another candidate for editing:\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/typetanic-fonts/columbia-titling/\r\n\r\nIf
    the details aren\u2019t a big deal, House Industry\u2019s Luxury Diamond evokes
    a similar feel:\r\nhttp://www.houseind.com/fonts/luxuryfonts"

    old time-y elegance... something about that cartier R is really doing it for me.
    Jessica Hische's Brioche is looking pretty great, though. Y'all are wonderful,
    thank you so much for your help!\r\n"
