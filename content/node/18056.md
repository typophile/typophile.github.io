  style font that would be good to use for wedding invitations. The wedding will be
  held in a great, old theatre that has a sort of Art Deco flair so I want to tie
  the invitations into the setting. Being that this wedding will not be held in a
  traditional setting it is not absolutely necessary to follow the traditions of formal
  or script type or design, but I do still want to keep it classy.\r\n\r\nThank you
  in advance for your help and insight,\r\n\r\nDuncan Robertson\r\n\r\n"
