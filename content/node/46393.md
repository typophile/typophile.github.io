  body: "This press thing is odd\u2013shortly there will be three web stories including
    my work.  All of the glossy magazines now have major online coverage so they double-dip
    on content.\r\n\r\nFYI: The smaller \"Thank You\" cards with bordering are photo-engravings
    of artwork made from the hand engraved blue card.  The blue card has a lovely
    hand gilded silver edge and the envelopes are completely lined with onion skin
    and the moisture sensitive adhesive is applied with a brush.  They were made for
    me by one of the Queen's stationers in London but the dollar is so weak now It
    is too expensive for even my customers to work with them anymore.  Which is a
    pity."
