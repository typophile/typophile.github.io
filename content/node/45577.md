  body: "Serifs like this on a script font seems like a stylistic mismatch, and I
    can't think of any serif font with an italic like this. Embroidery machines might
    use hand-drawn originals, built in machine-specific font sets, or interpretations
    of digital fonts. Only the last case would give you an answer at this forum, and
    it doesn't look like anything I have seen before. Maybe someone else has an idea?\r\n\r\n-
