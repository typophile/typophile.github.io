  body: You could try House Industries <a href="http://houseind.com/house.php?kit=CHALET-FO&amp;sub=view"
    target="_blank">Chalet</a> for a sans serif - it&#39;s based on 60s fonts. <BR>
    <BR>You can also do a search at <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/search?search%5Btext%5D=60s&amp;itemsperpage=100&amp;resultcount=127&amp;page=1"

  body: Great thanks for the reference, I&#39;ve got that on system too. <BR> <BR>To
    be more specific I am after 60&#39;s mod stylee... all typefaces need to have
    a strong european slant, not american.

  body: Mod as in British mid-60s, right? Monotype Grotesque and Gill Sans were standard
    workhorse sans serif families of the era, Times would probably be appropriate
    for a text font. As far as display stuff compressed grotesques &amp; gothics were
    common -- Bureau Grotesque and Compacta would be reasonable simulations. Psychedelic
    stuff came later and was generally hand-drawn. Just please don&#39;t use that
    awful blobby Austin Powers font.

  body: 'As past mod &#40;well before I was into type stuff, around 1983-1987&#41;,
    I will say that the best its perhaps to look at records sleeves? Looking to Mods
    websites can be good idea too, such that page: <a href="http://www.bomp.com/BompbooksMod.html"
    target="_blank">http://www.bomp.com/BompbooksMod.html</a> or such <a href="http://www.modculture.co.uk"
    target="_blank">http://www.modculture.co.uk</a> &#40;look at them via google&#41;
    <BR> <BR>The main references of the 60&#39;s Mods, after British pop, was Motown
    and Stax records and Blue Note &#40;in early days&#41;. So, looking to such records
    sleeves too can give you good indication. <BR> <BR>To me, there is no real special
    typefaces but yes, Chalet is a good start. Mod is more patterns, such all pop
    art ones <a href="http://www.modculture.co.uk/art/" target="_blank">http://www.modculture.co.uk/art/</a>
    and the targets, arrows associated with type, like the famous The Who logo.'
