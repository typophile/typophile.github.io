  body: 'Licensing depends on foundry and on the technical technical solution you
    implement. Some foundries have flat rates, some will consider a bunch of x-factors
    and assign a relative value to the usage. Pricing can vary widely, your best bet
    is to get in touch with the foundry (or multiple if you haven''t decided anything
    yet) and discuss it with them, it seems like almost everyone is somewhat figuring
    these new technology scenarios out for themselves. '

  body: "Recently we licensed [[http://www.boldmonday.com/en/nitti/|Nitti Light]]
    for use in [[http://www.informationarchitects.jp/en/writer-for-ipad/|iA Writer
    for iPad]]. After many hours of number crunching, consideration and seas of black
    coffee we decided to go for a license scheme based on sales revenue that becomes
    relatively cheaper the higher the revenue. This ensures that the licensee is charged
    according to what they actually earn, and not according to sales volume alone
    for instance. And charging a flat fee is usually not economically viable for apps
    that might cost only $1.00.\r\n\r\nDrop us a line if you want to know more.\r\n\r\n-Paul"

  body: "Referring to the technical stuff: iPhone apps can have their own fonts inside
    their application bundle. Their file names have to be added to a configuration
    file (the bundle's info.plist file) and are then usable from inside the application:\r\n\r\n\xBBUIAppFonts
    (Array - iOS) specifies any application-provided fonts that should be made available
    through the normal mechanisms. Each item in the array is a string containing the
    name of a font file (including filename extension) that is located in the application\u2019s
    bundle. The system loads the specified fonts and makes them available for use
    by the application when that application is run.\xAB\r\n\r\nhttp://developer.apple.com/library/ios/#DOCUMENTATION/General/Reference/InfoPlistKeyReference/Articles/iPhoneOSKeys.html\r\n\r\nAFAIK
    the fonts can be any format that is recognized by the OS, such as TTF or OTF."
