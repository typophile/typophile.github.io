body: "Hello typophiles,\r\n\r\nI am doing a set of books for an Indian artist who
  practised between 1940's to 1970's, recording the events of the country through
  its independence, and its people in strong b/w drawings and etchings. The books
  are heavy on text - the main one infact runs into 40,000 words.\r\n\r\nI am looking
  for body text fonts that may have a 'period' feel about them, while being very very
  readable. While Mrs Eames looks like a good choice, I am debating whether it is
  readable enough for this amount of text. Baskerville, Garamon and Veljovic are others
  that I am considering.\r\n\r\nWhile on the topic, what body sans serifs would you
  use for a book with such extensive text.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance\r\nTypefreak"

    answer your other question regarding San Serif. I would never use for such long
    body copy."

    which will work well at small sizes and has a dark and ''modelled'' look that
    may go well with strong b/w drawings.   '

  body: While the era is Commonwealth, rather than Empire, I suspect that the British
    Monotype faces such as Imprint, Plantin, Perpetua, Times, and Gill would have
    been most prominent for text work in India at that time. And of course Baskerville--but
    you would want to use a digital version that gives a substantial impression. Plantin
    would be an interesting choice, it's strong.
