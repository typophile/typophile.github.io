  precisely on architect Gordon Cullen and writer Ian Nairn). Apparentely during the
  post-war period the large format of the Architectural review did not present a decisive
  development in graphic design and layout, confining itself to the safe Times tipography
  until Gordon Cullen introduced for the first time (October 1947 issue) the use of
  Clarendon Bold, which became a fashionable typeface in many architectural practices
  at the time. The architectural Review was apparentely well-known for its innovation
  in lay-out and format with the contribution of Gordon Cullen, who had a great interest
  in typography.\r\nI was wondering if anyone can tell me more about it or has come
  across any text on Architectural Review and its use of typography and layout, especially
  in the post-war period.\r\nMany thanks for any link, opinion or anecdote.\r\n"

    a great deal of Clarendon bold used in the 1950s but I have no way of linking
    it to your publication.  The only architectural journal I read back then was Domus.\r\n\r\nChrisL"

  body: "Thanks! I was sure a charitable soul would send a sign of life sooner or
    later! I think it's such an interesting topic and going through the 50s editions
    of the AR was literally mind blowing. The layout is really interesting, all cluttered
    and with an antiquarian feel and I'm sure all this says a lot about the AR's (or
    England for this matter) place in the Modern Movement. \r\n\r\nAnyway, no: nothing
    on Google, in fact my research is way beyond the google phase! I've found this
    information in a biography of Gordon Cullen written by David Gosling. Cullen was
    art director at the AR for many years and he really was \"the guy with the twinkle
    in his eye\" (as Gosling put it) so I'd love to find out more about his interest
    in typography (and its Townscape theories obviously but that is easier to find).\r\n\r\nThat's
    it. But thanks anyway Chris, for a moment I thought I had been grounded or something!
    Phew!"

  body: "Lore,\r\nI think you got no replies because there was nobody who had any
    answers for you--including me. I always feel strange replying \"I don't know\"
    so I tend to leave the question for those who do. Perhaps others felt the same
    way?\r\nPerhaps you might post a couple of scans from AR to show us what you mean.
    It sounds unusual for an architectural journal to \"have a cluttered and antiquarian
    feel.\" I think of architects as being very structured and conciously organized--perhaps
    Domus fits my view of what architects would like in a journal?\r\n\r\nChrisL"

  body: "Exactly! Why the AR chose to have this look right in the middle of the 50s?
    \ That could be (a key (or one of the keys) to understand the magazine's philosophy
    and I'm sort of getting there but I wanted to demonstrate it by showing its use
    of layout and typography as well.\r\nGood idea about the scan. Hey no worries!
    I was just trying to resuscitate the thread but I'm not taking it personally of
    course, I was just surprised, it doesn't happen often at Typophile that nobody
    has anything to say! \r\nThanks again."

    body: "A couple of thoughts. \r\n\r\nI have a complete run of \"AR\" here, from
      1954 until 1992. My father was an architect, with a modest country practice,
      designing primarily houses but some public and commercial buildings as well.
      He was strongly influenced by Frank Lloyd Wright. He practised from 1950 until
      2002. Over the years, he subscribed to the typical American mags such as \"Progressive
      Architecture,\" \"Architectural Forum,\" \"AIA Journal,\" and so forth. He also
      took \"abitare\" and \"domus.\" (And \"I. F. Stone's Weekly\" if any of you
      are ancient enough to remember that!) \r\n\r\nBut of all those, the only ones
      he kept were copies of the \"Architectural Review.\" I think this says a lot
      about the content of the magazines in addition to their design.\r\n\r\nWhen
      I have some spare time I'll look to see if 1954 is early enough for the change
      in design to be discussed during the run of magazines I have here, and shall
      certainly report back to you if that is the case. Their layouts (and even the
      ads) seem so much livelier than the oh-so-corporate looking American mags.\r\n\r\nBruce"

  body: "Thank you so much for the thoughts Bruce (and welcome to Typophile, what
    took you so long!?). As far as AR is concerned the post-war editions are indeed
    very interesting as artefacts. Due to paper racioning they were made with different
    kind of papers, especially special editions such as \"Outrage\" (1955) and \"Counter-attack
    against Subtopia\". They are rare and difficult to find nowadays. I bought Outrage
    on ebay, it was a bit expensive but worth every penny. \r\nWhat I should do is
    compare AR layout, format and typography with that of the periodicals you mention
    (I should have done this probably ages ago, so thanks for the inspiration). The
    AR was an international magazine but above all it was English and I guess that,
    through H. de C. Hastings, it did reflect England's Picturesque tradition. Anyway
    mine are speculations but I'd be glad to hear more when you have time. Thanks
    again."

    I can't believe I missed that shop you mention in your blog, I used to hang around
    Brick Lane a lot when I was in London. If you see those special editions from
    the 50s just grab 'em and run.\r\nI also received few emails on this topic which
    led to interesting discussions so thanks everyone."
