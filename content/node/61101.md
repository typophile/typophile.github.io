  use the search option, BUT i just wanna be sure the information on this topic is
  up to date.\r\n\r\nis there any special license agreement needed to render fonts
  and display them on a commercial website using tools that don't embedd the font,
  but just render an image?\r\n\r\nto be clear: the font is not embedded in a flash
  file, it's stored on the server in ttf or otf, but only accessable by the server
  itself, not public.\r\n\r\ni assume only a regular license is needed here?\r\n\r\nthanks:
  lars\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    on the local browser? If it comes through as a GIF, JPG or PNG, then you are probably
    OK. But if you are allowing the browser to render the ttf or otf file, then some
    of the license rules will be broken."

  body: ">i assume only a regular license is needed here?\r\n\r\nIf the font is to
    be installed on a server then you may need a specific server license. If the foundry
    you're licensing from doesn't offer server licenses then a workstation license
    may be sufficient, but you may get caught out under restrictions around concurrent
    users - especially if they define web site visitors (people who indirectly use
    the font) as users. As always the best option is to ask the foundry. \r\n"

  body: I don't think lars wants to pre-render the images, as he asked about creating
    them with PHP. It's basicly the same process as sIFR, but the outcome is an image
    and not a (decompilable) flash movie.

    but only done once. scenario again: user picks font, sets text, image replacement
    gets rendered, later on it's just displaying the rendered output (image), so one
    a \"per-user\" basis it's only rendered once."

    \"where\" the font is installed? \r\n\r\nanother try to describe what i wanna
    do:\r\n\r\nexample: on the typophile's forum you can set your user image by uploading
    an image. instead of using an uploaded image the user could choose from, let's
    say, 5 different fonts and instead of an uploaded image being displayed, the user
    name would be displayed as a \"rendered\" bitmap image using the choosen font.
    \r\n\r\nso, all 5 fonts are installed on the typophile server (not accessable
    by the public, just by the server), for each user there would be one rendered
    \"lettering\" of the username outputted as image and displayed in the user profile
    (and next to each post by that user).\r\n\r\ndoes this need some special licensing
    or is it included in most foundries eula's as long as the font itself is just
    installed on \"one workstation\" (in this case the server)?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    the case, you'd need a special license of some sort.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\n\r\nT"

    side makes the licensing difference, all tools like sifr, cufon or flir can only
    work with free gpl fonts, unless the user licensed the font under special terms?\r\n\r\nwell,
    of course there's another difference, because sifr embedds glyphs and flir just
    generates a bitmap image, but generally spoken?\r\n\r\nany experiences on those
    special type of licenses?\r\nfor me it's just a goodie to display the user name
    in a non-regular-web-font, so if those special license is like 10 times the price
    of the \"regular\" license i would drop that idea :)\r\n\r\n"

  body: "My take. Server side rendering of text to bitmap is at least as old as the
    (graphical) Web. Remember in the early days of Mosaic and Netscape there were
    no font tags or CSS, so the only way to do non-Times/Courier text was to pre-render
    or render-on-the-fly text server-side. The font foundries largely ignored this
    for say the first six or eight years, until server-side rendering (and for that
    matter server-side PDF generation) started to threaten their core-businesses (selling
    fonts to application developers and graphic designers) through things like business
    card design services, holiday card customization, and more recently web-based
    design apps. At that point they started to take notice. I think you see the same
    kind of pattern with Flash and some of the other technologies.\r\n\r\nThere are
    interesting parallels with raw-font linking. When Safari launched with support
    for raw fonts I talked to Apple folks about it down in Cupertino (this was during
    a public meeting around OpenType/ ISO OFF standards items). The engineer I spoke
    to said that raw-font-linking would open the door to brand new business models
    for type designers. I was kind of skeptical \u2013 said that font foundries really
    didn\u2019t want to change, and certainly didn\u2019t like outsiders telling them
    they had to. I think it\u2019s interesting that with TypeKit et al, people from
    outside of the traditional font community were have been able to find a business
    model.\r\n"

    also a sale, and much more money based on the level of redistribution. But if
