body: "Hi, I am looking for font authors who have already created a good monospaced
  font to create a custom font for me using their monospaced font as the basis for
  my font.\r\n\r\nI want full rights to sell/re-distribute the custom font you will
  be creating for me.\r\n\r\nI am looking for a good mono spaced font as the basis
  for my font - something similar to Droid Sans Mono or Bitstream vera font. The reason
  I can't use those fonts as the basis of my font is their license does not allow
  me to resell derivative fonts. Hence, I am trying to find a font author of a similar
  font who owns their font and can give me rights to sell my custom font that is based
  upon their font.\r\n\r\nMy custom font basically requires some additional characters.
  I need seven specific characters to have \"one dot above\" and \"one dot below\"
  variations to be created for them. When I say \"one dot above\", think of it like
  the German umlaut, except only one dot instead of two. And when I say \"one dot
  below\" think of that same dot below the standard character rather than above. This
  should be super easy to do because you will simply be creating 14 additional characters
  in the font by making two copies of the 7 characters and then drawing the 'dot'
  - which you could even copy from the i or j character - and then pasting them to
  make the \"one dot above\" and \"one dot below\" variations.\r\n\r\nCould you please
  email me if you are a font creator who already has a monospaced font similar to
  what I am looking for, and what you would like to charge for this project, and how
  I can contact you to discuss this project further, and also, please kindly send
  me links to pages that show what monospaced font (of your creation that you have
  full rights for) you propose and any other fonts you have created to showcase your
  portfolio/experience. Thanks and I look forward to hearing from you font creators!"
