body: "What comes to mind typographically when you think of Romania? I am looking
  for anything from specific fonts, to popular styles, to general trends, to examples
  of work printed in Romania. Or any designers, publishers, websites, books, etc.
  that you feel are representative of the culture.\r\n\r\nHistorical and contemporary
  examples are both appreciated.\r\n\r\nI realize this a very broad question, I am
  just looking for ideas to get me started. I am designing a piece where I want include
  some allusions to Romanian culture."
