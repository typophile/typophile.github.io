body: This is the first typeface i have ever designed. I currently attend SCAD and
  took Intro to Typeface Design which is a 10 week course. I went the experimental
  route and really wanted to create something new. Its nowhere near refined but my
  teacher told me to upload it to this to see what kind of feedback i get :) let me
  know!

  body: "Your work, especially your lowercase figures, looks reminiscent of the style
    of Braggadocio and Futura Black.  Compare and check your typefaces with these:
    \r\n\r\nBraggadocio\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Braggadocio_4989.gif]\r\n\r\nFutura
    Black\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/FuturaBlack_4596.gif]\r\n\r\nPaul
    Renner's original drawings for Futura\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Renners-original-drawings_3729.jpg]\r\n\r\nYour
    typeface would be useful as a decorative typeface or something for movie titles.
    \ However, the usage will be limited to these."
