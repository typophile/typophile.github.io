  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">I designed this simple logo for a non profit organisation. <BR>They wanted something informal, cheap to produce and 3D looking. <BR>The palm tree is their symbol and they operate in an area littered <BR>with art deco buildings. <BR>The logo had to be scalable, keeping the same feel from a small <BR>blotch of fax ink to a wall size banner. <BR> <BR>I gave up on anything with gradients generated with 3D studio or <BR>the likes and ended up doing the highlighs on the oily shapes manually.  <BR>I used dark green since it's a palm tree. It's already abstract  <BR>enough as it is. Just black and green to keep printing costs down. <BR> <BR>The typeface is Willow from Tony Forster. It's from 1990 but it's <BR>inspired from turn of the century arts and craft in Austria. <BR>Not really art deco but everyone except folks here think it is. <BR>I came across this font by mistake ramdomly browsing on MyFonts. <BR>It was also cheap ($21) although it seems to have doubled in price <BR>this past week. <BR>I think it works in this context and the customer loved it but what <BR>do I know?

You also might look at the typeface Mostra, it was based on art deco designs unlike the face you are using here.  The face you are using is more of an Art Nouveau era. It is a good start, I look forward to see your progress</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Maybe my lack of graphic design senstivity is getting me here, but I really like what you have so far! Yes, it doesn't look like a palm tree, and yes, it does remind of a paw print (a good association though), but most of all it's like a really friendly -and tasty- alien plant form. Something you would squeeze to get the most delicious juice! It's not 3D is a cheesy way - it just has a nice depth and blobby dimensionality. <BR> <BR>I also like the A&amp;C font (just a darker weight if possible) - but the Trade Gothic has got to go. I would lose the two smaller blobs too. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR></div>

		<div class="commentbody">I obviously need to redraw the paw print.. ugh I meant palm tree. Thanks for the feedback. <BR> <BR>The customer wants the globular look. It's like an oil or water drop that is shown growing into a palm tree or person, but not a paw print. They are more interested in something esthetic and unique rather than something with obvious meaning. <BR>I think I'll play around with uneven palms for my next attempt. I can't narrow the trunk otherwise it will look like a pot plant. <BR> <BR>I did play around with quite a few classic art deco era typefaces but their clean geometric shapes don't work well with an amorphous logo IMHO. <BR>The organic feel of turn of the century arts &amp; craft or Art Nouveau (I never figured out the difference) seems to work better with oil slicks. <BR>I really like Willow here. It's borderline too whimsical but the organisation helps the homeless and low income residents so it was important to make it friendly and non corporate looking. I'm almost ready to throw away the logo just to keep the typeface.  <BR> <BR>Scott: Could you please expand on why Willow doesn't go with a 3D shape? Surely you don't mean adding bevel or shadows. What are fonts that would fit the bill 3D wise? <BR> <BR>Hrant: Willow has only one weight. I wouldn't make it heavier anyway since the lettering would then stand out too much with respect to the logo. <BR>I had to darken the colour of the green for that same reason (using gray for the typeface wasn't an option to keep costs down). <BR>What type would you recommend instead of Trade Gothic? Associating typefaces is one area where I need more experience. I'm at the very beginning of developing a feel for it. My background is in technology, not visual design. <BR> <BR>Thanks all for you time. <BR>New logo to follow in a few hours, that is if I can work through the F1 Grand Prix ruckus. <BR></div>

Here's what MyFont says about that typeface. <i> <BR>&quot;This fanciful, imaginative typeface is of the Viennese Secessionist style. The work of Scottish architect Charles Rennie Mackintosh inspired this condensed sans serif style with its rough edges and selection of alternative and ligatured letters. Due to renewed interest in the arts and crafts of the late 19th and early 20th centuries, Willow will enjoy widespread promotional application. Designed by Tony Forster, one of Europe</div>

In reference to what you pulled off of &quot;MyFont&quot;, if you haven't already done it, you might want to explore some of Mackintosh's work for inspiration on the graphic. <BR> <BR>I actually agree with Darrel on two accounts: (1) a stained glass palm tree representation might look nice and (2) the old logo isn't as hidious as you made it out to be. To be honest, I think the combination of stained glass, with a slight variation of the old logo, and your new type might be a pretty worthwhile direction to explore. What I mean is</div>

The only thing one could complain about it is that it's too focused on Arts &amp; Crafts (where the subject of the logo isn't). You could try something like Neuland, but that might be too much.

		<div class="commentbody">yes, Neuland is too much. <BR>Block would have been ideal with the oily blobs but my customer prefers the latest logo versions. They also like the Willow typeface. <BR> <BR>I was chatting with a Glasgow native last night and she was familiar with the Willow typeface from seeing similar lettering in jeweleries, galleries and some buildings. It certainly doesn't carry the same cultural baggage over here. I chose it simply for esthetic reason although its vague 1900 feel fits in too. The organisation helps low income people in rooming houses which often date from the beginning of the last century. Hum..sounds better than I thought. I may just use that one if I'm shoved against the wall to justify the typeface. <BR> <BR>PS: ParaType sells a Bloc copycat for only $25.</div>
