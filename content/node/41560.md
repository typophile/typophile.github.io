  it. I have been working on a personal identity mark the last few weeks. They suggested
  I put up a couple of my options and get some feedback. I am going for an organic,
  free flowing form. I want something that is not too serious looking and is delicate
  and beautiful. Thanks for your help.\r\n\r\nCambria"

  body: If you're looking for something delicate and free flowing, it should just
    be a few deliberate strokes. This ventures dangerously close to a wad of pubes.
    Definitely potential in these, though.

    ever read/seen on this forum. LOL! Not to be mean or anything (sorry) but after
    reading that I had to see for myself! Funny. Sorry. But seriously...I think it's
    beautiful in a doilyish way, which I also consider delicate. Nice work. How to
    improve it?...I concur: Simplify.\r\n\r\n"

    I tired to simplify. Is is getting any better or do you guys think that it still
    needs anymore simplification? Thanks!\r\n\r\nCambria"

  body: That's looking clean but also a tad busy. The internal hollow swashes are
    the strongest part of your image but they're being severed by their stems. Perhaps
    moving the stems off to the sides of them could work? Doing with the third one
    might be your best bet. They're all looking good though.

  body: "It looks like less of a tangle now...a little less. I'm of the less-is-more
    camp.\r\n\r\nA little of this depends upon how you want this to work. My first
    thought was, \"Hmmm...neat idea. Is this part of some new the-artist-formerly-known-as-Prince-inspired
    trend out in California? Is it something an artist develops for him or herself,
    or is there a potential market for these sort of things among tragically wealthy
    and bored metrosexuals?\" Either way, to simplify or not to simplify is all a
    matter of style.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, if it's something you'd like to appear
    more like a typographical element, like a letter of the alphabet (which to me
    would be really cool and very difficult), then it's got a long way to go. It's
    far from Caslon or Helvetica!\r\n\r\n"

    with my name. The mark has evolved from my initials into an icon. I put some more
    work into it. The feedback is helping. Thanks.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Cambria5_5793.1.png]

  body: Strip down to its skin as much as possible. Even the simplest of forms can
    still make a mark, or more so I would say. Less is more.

    progress, keep it up."

    My main warning is that you watch out for it looking too much like a swastika.

    ones in the first image - on the second row, on the right.  It had an open free-ness

    had your initials more referenced?"

    more with the suggestion to pair it with a typeface for comparison and refinements.
    You have simplified by making it heavier, and I don't think that's necessarily
    necessary.\r\n\r\n"

  body: "coming in late to this one, but the mark has not really succeeded in the
    free flowing category for me. organic i get, systems in nature and the like, but
    free flowing? looks too contrived. even more so in the later versions with big
    blocks of fill and a heavy-handed geometry. the mark feels like you really know
    how to work illustrator very well. take a step back from the computer and see
    what happens when you use your hands. i think that will open a whole new world
    for this mark and help take you in a better direction for free flowing/organic\r\n\r\nw|m"
