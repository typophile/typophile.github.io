  But they sure are beautiful\r\n\r\nIt\xB4s in swedish.\r\n\r\n \"Jakten p\xE5 lyckan\"\r\n\r\nThe
  sans serif is also very nice, and probably not that hard to ID!"

  body: "Thanks, Stephen! Letter Gothic All-Caps Oblique sure looks good!\r\n\r\nI
    thought about putting this on your twitter font ID, but now I know that you have
    seen it. \r\n\r\nSeems like a difficult typeface to find, WhatTheFont also failed
    to give a results.\r\n\r\nI have mailed the authors, so I might get an answer
    fron them.\r\n\r\nOtherwise a classification would be interresting! What is this
    kind of typeface called?"

  body: I would call it a stencil script. There are a few of this sort on <a href="http://new.myfonts.com/search/script+stencil/?refby=typographica">MyFonts</a>.
