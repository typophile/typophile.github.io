  it, but I just see some empty folders &#40;running under jaguar&#41; <BR>Or maybe
  I didn&#39;t dig the forum threads enough...

  body: Yep. Using safari, but I tried with IExplorer. I&#39;m also using Stuffit
    X, but the problem really seems to be in the .zip file, since its content isn&#39;t
    was I expected &#40;nice icon to show off with !&#41;

  body: Well, I tryed it on another machine and it didn&#39;t work either. Maybe something
    is rotten in my typographic kingdom ;&#41; <BR>Thanks for caring anyway.

  body: Hold it, maybe this is all a misunderstanding &#40;possibly on my part&#41;.
    <BR> <BR>I downloaded and decompressed the file, which appeared to be an  <BR>empty
    folder which looks like the typophile icon. I selected both my  <BR>&#34;Macintosh
    HD&#34; and the Typophile folder and pressed cmd-i &#40;Show  <BR>info&#41;. Then
    I clicked the Typophile icon in its info window, pressed  <BR>cmd-c &#40;Copy&#41;,
    clicked my hard drive icon in its info window and  <BR>pressed cmd-v &#40;Paste&#41;.
    <BR> <BR>Is this how it&#39;s still done? &#39;cause it looks like it worked on
    my computer...
