body: i have a size problem, i design A4 magazine, and usually i realise i set my
  title n subtitle a tad too big. u wont see the visual flaws until the mag is printed.  <BR>
  <BR>what is a safe way to avoid that? is there any point size beyond which we should
  generally avoid? I keep thinking anything above 24 is kinda risky. <BR> <BR>what
  do u guys think?
