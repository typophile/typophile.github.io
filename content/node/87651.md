  \u2013 only brought trouble to my FontLab workflow.\r\nSince the last build FontLab
  luckily works (maybe even better than on Snow Leopard), BUT I just can\u2019t get
  my macros to work!\r\n\r\nHere is the latest Error message I get:\r\n\r\nTraceback
  (most recent call last):\r\n  File \"<string>\", line 20, in <module>\r\nImportError:
  No module named robofab.interface.all.dialogs\r\n\r\nRobofab is installed. Python
  too. (I guess)\r\n\r\nI am so thankful for tips, it\u2019s driving me crazy, \r\nplus
  I am obviously not able to wrap my mind around this myself."

  body: "Try pulling the latest packages from SVN. SVN is pretty awesome, it keeps
    you up to date with code whenever you want.\r\nIt is installed on your Mac already.
    So all you have to do is: set up a folder where you want the distros to be \r\n\r\n(I
    have ~/svn/)\r\n\r\nOpen a Terminal in that folder and type \r\n\r\nsvn co http://svn.robofab.com/svn
    update http://svn.typesupply.com/packages/dialogKit (press enter)\r\n\r\nsvn co
    https://fonttools.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/fonttools (press enter)\r\nsvn co
    http://svn.typesupply.com/packages/vanilla (press enter)\r\nsvn co http://svn.typesupply.com/packages/ufo2fdk
    (press enter)\r\n\r\nSVN will download all the code from the specified sources.\r\n\r\nNow
    all you have to do is tell Python where your code is:\r\nGo to your Python directory(/ies):\r\n\r\nMacintosh
    HD/Library/Python/2.6/site-packages/\r\n(FL now uses 2.6, and I believe everything
    else as well, but you can do that for all the Python versions if you want.)\r\n\r\nLocate
    the file robofab.pth, open it and change the contents (to the path you have dumped
    robofab to):\r\n/Users/YOUR-USER-NAME/svn/svn.robofab.com/trunk/Lib\r\n\r\nLocate
    the file dialogKit.pth, open it and change the contents (to the path you have
    dumped robofab to):\r\n/Users/YOUR-USER-NAME/svn/dialogKit/trunk/Lib\r\n\r\nLocate
    the file vanilla.pth, open it and change the contents (to the path you have dumped
    robofab to):\r\n/Users/YOUR-USER-NAME/svn/vanilla/trunk/Lib\r\n\r\nLocate the
    file robofab.pth, open it and change the contents (to the path you have dumped
    robofab to):\r\n/Users/YOUR-USER-NAME/svn/fonttools/trunk/Lib\r\n\r\nNow copy
    your .PTH files into all the different Python 'site-packages' folders like in
    my screenshot.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Screen-Shot-2011-11-22-at-17_3476.22.gif]\r\n\r\nNow
    copy the Fontlab scripts from the Robofab SVN folder into your Fontlab script
    folder.\r\n\r\nRestart Fontlab.\r\n\r\nAwesome sauce."

    are using a newer version of Python, so you just have to move over your Robofab
    folders to the newer Python (2.6 I believe?), or do a re-install.\r\n\r\nFind

    Why not svn co the complete typesupply stuff?\r\n\r\n<code>svn co http://svn.typesupply.com/</code>\r\n\r\n3.
    You can then update by cd'ing into the directory and typing <code>svn update</code>\r\n\r\nPS:
