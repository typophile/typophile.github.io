    But I can't. Just a note, Acrobat 8 is light years beyond 7. But quickly frankly,
    I'd ask Adobe. They might like the idea.\r\n\r\nGerald"

  body: "Piece of cake. The trick is that the button has to have multiple actions:\r\n\r\n1.
    Before adding the button, set up the PDF file to open full screen.\r\n\r\n2. After
    you create and format the button and have the <strong>Button Properties</strong>
    dialog open, click on the <strong>Actions</strong> tab.\r\n\r\n3. Under <strong>Add
    an Action > Select Trigger</strong>, <strong>Mouse Up</strong> is generally fine.
    The Acrobat help file explains the other trigger options.\r\n\r\n4. Under <strong>Add
    an Action > Select Action</strong>, choose <strong>Execute a menu item</strong>.
    Click the <strong>Add\u2026</strong> button.\r\n\r\n5. Under <strong>Actions</strong>,
    you should now have a little tree diagram. In the tree, highlight <strong>Execute
    a menu item</strong> and then click <strong>Edit</strong>.\r\n\r\n6. In the <strong>Menu
    Item Selection</strong> dialog, select <strong>View > Full Screen</strong>. (Since
    the document is in full screen mode, this switches it to page layout. Note that
    once the file is in page layout mode, clicking this button again will put in back
    into full screen mode). Click <strong>OK</strong>.\r\n\r\n7. Repeat steps 4 and
    5 to add another <strong>Execute a menu item</strong> line to the action tree
    and open it for editing.\r\n\r\n8. In the <strong>Menu Item Selection</strong>
    dialog, select <strong>View > Navigation Tabs > Bookmarks</strong>. Click <strong>OK</strong>.\r\n\r\n9.
    If you want the user to be sent to another page, repeat steps 4 and 5. In the
    <strong>Menu Item Selection</strong> dialog, select <strong>View > Go To</strong>
    and choose an option. Click <strong>OK</strong>.\r\n\r\n10. In the <strong>Button
    Properties</strong> dialog, click <strong>Close</strong>.\r\n\r\n11. Save the
    PDF file and then test it in Adobe Reader to make sure it works.\r\n\r\nYou can
    rearrange the sequence in which the menu items are executed by moving lines up
    or down in the <strong>Actions</strong> tree, but different sequences may not
    give the same results.\r\n\r\nTo create a button that closes the file, follow
    steps 2 through 5, and then in the <strong>Menu Item Selection</strong> dialog,
    select <strong>File > Close</strong>.\r\n"

  body: "Sorry about not getting back to you sooner, but I've been fighting bronchitis
    and was pretty much bedridden all weekend.\r\n\r\n>Do you know how to make the
    PDF open automatically when the CD is inserted in the computer?\r\n\r\nUh oh.
    Fasten your seat belts, boys. I do, but only on Windows, not Mac or Linux. In
    fact, I\u2019ve heard that OS X no longer supports what used to be called AutoStart
    on Macs. If you need to create a CD that will automatically play under both Windows
    and Mac, you\u2019ll need a Mac guru.\r\n\r\nWhat you want is AutoPlay (WinXP
    and Vista) or AutoRun (Windows 95 through Win2K). However, there are so many variables
    and exceptions and special cases (I have 25 pages of notes on autorun) that it\u2019s
    impossible to guarantee that a CD will autorun on every possible platform without
    getting into modifying the user\u2019s registry or running weird scripts. I don\u2019t
    think that\u2019s ethical to do to unsuspecting users. Also, as you can see from
    Miss Tiffany\u2019s posts, autorun annoys a lot of people, so WinXP and Vista
    allow the user to disable AutoPlay via the \u201Ctake no action\u201D option in
    the Autoplay dialog that pops up when you load a new type of CD or DVD. The bottom
    line is that your client is going to have to accept that the CD may not work 100%
    of the time.\r\n\r\nSince there are so many possibilities, I\u2019m just going
    to outline a basic procedure that should work in most cases.\r\n\r\n1. Copy the
    following two lines to your favorite text editor or word processor and save the
    file as a plain text file named <strong>autorun.inf</strong>:\r\n\r\n[autorun]\r\nshellexecute=yourfilename.pdf\r\n\r\n2.
    Burn the autorun.inf file and your PDF to the root of CD.\r\n\r\n3. Cross your
    fingers and test the CD on as many different machines as you can.\r\n\r\nThe meaning
    of the lines in autorun.inf:\r\n\r\n[autorun]\r\nThis must be the first line and
    must have the brackets.\r\n\r\nshellexecute=yourfilename.pdf\r\nThis line tells
    WinMe, WinNT 5.x, Win2K, WinXP, and Vista to launch the file named <strong>yourfilename.pdf</strong>.
    It uses the registered file associations to figure out which application to use.
    Change <strong>yourfilename</strong> to the name of your PDF file. If the PDF
    filename has spaces in it, enclose it in double quotes, like this: <strong>\u201CYour
    Clients File.pdf\u201D</strong>.\r\n\r\nIf you think your audience might be using
    Win95 or Win98, add the following line:\r\n\r\nopen=acrord32.exe yourfilename.pdf\r\n\r\nThis
    line tells Win95 and Win98 to launch Adobe Reader and passes Reader the filename
    <strong>yourfilename.pdf</strong>. Again, change <strong>yourfilename</strong>
    to the name of your PDF and use double quotes if needed. (Actually, shellexecute
    will work on Win9x systems if they have Microsoft Layer for Unicode installed.
    You see what I mean about too many special cases and exceptions?)\r\n\r\nSo, to
    cover Win95 through Vista, your autorun.inf would look like this:\r\n\r\n[autorun]\r\nshellexecute=yourfilename.pdf\r\nopen=acrord32.exe
    yourfilename.pdf\r\n\r\nIf for some reason the PDF file must be in a subfolder,
    not the root of the CD, you can use relative paths on the <strong>shellexecute=</strong>
    and <strong>open=</strong> lines, like this (but the autorun.inf file must always
    be in the root):\r\n\r\nshellexecute=\\mysubfolder\\yourfilename.pdf\r\nshellexecute=\u201C\\my
    sub folder\\your file name.pdf\u201D\r\n\r\nopen=acrord32.exe \\mysubfolder\\yourfilename.pdf\r\nopen=acrord32.exe
    \u201C\\my sub folder\\your file name.pdf\u201D\r\n\r\nOn the <strong>open=</strong>
    line, you can suppress the Reader splash screen by using the <strong>/s</strong>
    switch:\r\n\r\nopen=acrord32.exe /s yourfilename.pdf\r\n\r\nThere are two optional
    lines you can include in autorun.inf. They are <strong>icon=</strong> and <strong>label=</strong>.\r\n\r\nIf
    you have a Windows icon file (.ico) that you want to display for the CD in Windows
    Explorer or My Computer, use this:\r\n\r\nicon=youricon.ico\r\n\r\nIf you want
    a text label to appear for the CD in Windows Explorer or My Computer (but it probably
    won't work on Win95 or Win98), use this:\r\n\r\nlabel=Your CD name\r\n\r\n<strong>Your
    CD name</strong> can be anything you want, and it can have spaces without needing
    double quotes around it.\r\n\r\nYou can use <strong>icon=</strong> and <strong>label=</strong>
    together, individually, or not at all. Using all the commands, your autorun.inf
    would look like this:\r\n\r\n[autorun]\r\nshellexecute=yourfilename.pdf\r\nopen=acrord32.exe
    /s yourfilename.pdf\r\nicon=youricon.ico\r\nlabel=Your CD name\r\n\r\nGood luck\u2026"

  body: "I knew I shouldn't have gotten out of bed while my O2 sat was low. The <strong>open=acrord32.exe</strong>
    line doesn't work on Win9x. What it does is try to open the Reader from the CD,
    but of course the executable isn't there. The good news is that the buttons in
    the PDF file worked in Reader version 4.1.\r\n\r\nWithout the <strong>open=</strong>
    line, your autorun.inf would be:\r\n\r\n[autorun]\r\nshellexecute=yourfilename.pdf\r\n\r\nor:\r\n\r\n[autorun]\r\nshellexecute=yourfilename.pdf\r\nicon=youricon.ico\r\n\r\nor:\r\n\r\n[autorun]\r\nshellexecute=yourfilename.pdf\r\nicon=youricon.ico\r\nlabel=Your
    CD name\r\n\r\nIt is possible to put the Reader on the CD, but the files you need
    vary depend on which version of the Reader you want to use, and I'm not sure that
    Adobe approves. The best way to open the PDF file in Win9x is to use a small freeware
    launcher program. Rather than bore everyone with the details of that, though,
    I'll wait and see if you post here saying you do need to cover Windows 95 and
    98."
