body: "In my [[http://typophile.com/node/50618|first font design]] I have, by design,
  used some lines that are just slightly off of true vertical and horizontal. FontLab
  notifies me of this and offers to true them up. At first I thought this was just
  the software thinking (mistakenly) that it knew my intention and offering to help.
  But now it occurs to me that there may be technical reasons why slightly off-horizontal
  or off-vertical strokes should be avoided, in terms of generating the font, or displaying
  it, or printing it. \r\n\r\nWill preserving my slightly off lines come back to haunt
  me later for some such technical reason?"

    well on screen?

  body: "On screen it isn't as much of an issue-- with modern anti-aliasing technologies
    you will see a gradient line of pixels along one edge as the line crosses the
    pixel column between vectors. It becomes a problem in print. However highly pitched,
    even the best imagesetters still produce a dot matrix output, and may have trouble
    expressing such a minute slope. \r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: So it sounds like if I print it out and I'm happy enough with how it looks,
    I can press on with my slants. Thanks for the input.
