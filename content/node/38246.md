  of my daughter, age 3, posted on [[http://www.heavydutypress.com/shirts/closet|my
  web site]]. I'm trying to decide whether or not I should go through the hassle of
  setting up a paypal account so I can sell them to the general web public. I figure
  Typophiles would be the best market for these t-shirts.\r\n\r\nIf nothing else,
  you might be amused by Katrina's designs. These came unsolicited at the kitchen
  table. She drew them, and at first glance I was confused...when she told me what
  they were, I, her alphabet-loving dad, couldn't help but to smile with pride and
  glee.\r\n\r\n[[http://www.heavydutypress.com/shirts/closet|Heavy Duty Fashion]] "

  body: "I think they're great. I also like the tired mom t-shirt -- that one is too
    real.\r\n\r\n:) I'd buy one if the t-shirt itself was a good cut and good cotton.
    I hate wearing big boxy square men's tees."

  body: "> I also like the tired mom t-shirt \r\n\r\nThat drawing and the type on
    it were done by my friends' 9-year-old kid. He's autistic. I, too, thought it
    was great, as did the guy who printed 24 of them for me, but so far I've sold
    about 4 at the [[http://www.viroquamainststation.com/|local public market]]. I
    think the problem is that the population of our town is 4,335. Once 4 people are
    seen with the shirt, nobody else wants it, regardless of how great it is!\r\n\r\n>
    I\u2019d buy one if the t-shirt itself was a good cut and good cotton.\r\n\r\nAgreed.
    And here lies the problem with t-shirts. An average joe like me really cannot
    afford to print up an inventory of shirts to meet the demands of what has become
    a very particular market. So, sorry, there will be no excellent women's cuts until
    I sell at least twelve of the remaining Tired Mom \"standard-cut\" t-shirts. I
    do have some mediums and smalls in stock, 100% cotton...they look good on my wife.
    $15 and I'll cover the shipping. That goes for everyone and [[http://www.heavydutypress.com/shirts/closet|every
    shirt I've got]]. [[http://www.heavydutypress.com/|Contact me]] if you're interested.
    Thanks.\r\n"
