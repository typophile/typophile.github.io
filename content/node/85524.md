  a relevant thread. I am finishing, for the first time, a font withtwo scripts, Latin
  and Cyrillic. I cannot find how to add the Cyrillic script so that it would show
  in the OpenType Preview panel \u2013 so that I could choose a script.\r\n\r\nI am
  including a picture of how Adobe Minion shows the scripts; that\xB4s what I\xB4d
  like to get!\r\n\r\nWith best wishe, Saku."

  body: "You need to register the scripts using the languagesystem keyword. Include
    the following at the beginning of your code.\r\n\r\nlanguagesystem DFLT dflt;\r\nlanguagesystem
    latn dflt;\r\nlanguagesystem cyrl dflt;\r\n\r\nIf you have any language-specific
    behaviours defined you will need to add those as well, e.g.\r\n\r\nlanguagesystem
    latn TRK; # Turkish\r\nlanguagesystem cyrl SRB; # Serbian\r\n\r\netc.\r\n\r\nNote
    that none of this has any relevance to what text or script you type in the preview
    pane -- it only determines which behaviours that text will exhibit as determined
    by your opentype features.\r\n\r\nAndr\xE9"

  body: "Thanks!\r\n\r\nEr... shall I put that at the beginning of every feature script
    (small caps, kerning, etc)? Do I also need the script tag?\r\nAnd should there
    be some equivalent at the end of the code?\r\nThe features actually work even
    now, without these, in InDesign.\r\n\r\nSaku."

  body: "languagesystem commands should appear at the beginning of your file outside
    of any feature definition and before any feature definitions. You should minimally
    include DFLT dflt and latn dflt.\r\n\r\nYou only need to specify the script and/or
    language within a feature if you want that feature to behave differently depending
    on the script or language. Your font works fine presumably because you have not
    defined any language- or script-specific behaviours within it.\r\n\r\nAndr\xE9\r\n"
