    that they have <em>two</em> copies) but it's good news for raising awareness of
    printing.\r\n\r\nWhat was the font?\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    I will check my Updike though.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "Um,\r\n\r\n[[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Bay1640.jpg]]\r\n\r\nI'd say
    Caslon. Which is not surprising. But in fact, it would be surprising, since even
    if the book was printed in 1640 instead of 1610, that's still over 50 years before
    Caslon was born.\r\n\r\nAs it happens, though, that title page was reproduced
    in Updike's <em>Printing Types</em>, so identifying the typeface shouldn't be
    a problem.\r\n\r\nHmm... further searching turns up\r\n\r\n[[http://typefoundry.blogspot.ca/2011/11/elzevir-letter.html]]\r\n\r\nshowing
    that the \"generic\" typeface of the 17th Century does have a somewhat mysterious
    origin - even though it was the Elseviers that everyone was copying."
