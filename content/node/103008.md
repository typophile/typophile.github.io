  body: "To me, no font is needed to do such a lettering as it is only made with strokes.
    You could also easily do the same starting from any pixel/bitmap font of your
    choice. If you still need something that could quickly do the job, may be having
    a look to some sections at DaFont would worth a shot: <strong>[[http://www.dafont.com/bitmap.php|Bitmap
    > Pixel, Bitmap]]</strong> and [[http://www.dafont.com/theme.php?cat=301|Techno
    > Square]].\r\nSome in the same vein: [[http://www.dafont.com/anascript.font|AnaScript]]
