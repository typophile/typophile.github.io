You could be right about avoiding the script. <BR> <BR>I have pushed the head to the top a little and made it rounder - cheers, Hrant. <BR> <BR>For now, let's try changing the face and see what comes out of it. One consideration though: I don't want it to look too exclusive or elegant either - the cards should also appeal to the younger generation (~30ish) Is that attraction maybe lost with Minion Italic?

		<div class="commentbody">I prefer the first version of the design with the font &quot;Spring LP Std&quot;, but as you may know the &quot;LP&quot; is a trademark of LetterPerfect Design. <BR>In general Spring is contemporary font of the 90s and depicts the contemporary spirit of that period.  <BR>  &quot;Minion&quot; even though a great balanced font would not work good for you on this logotype.  <BR>  The flower stands quite ackward with Minion. As I said before you might need a different positioning. <BR>  Maybe try some of the following : ITC Edwardian Script , Florens LP Std, Lucida Calligraphy (Handwriting) or even Script MT Std. <BR> <BR>Salute</div>

		<div class="commentbody">It all depends on what the emphasis should be. The first post has an equal balance between the word and the logo. This makes the logo feel less important the Minion version puts more emphasis on the logo which inturn feels extra special. I feel like the first version almost doesn't need the logo because the script is so graphic in itself. I myself prefer the Minion version <BR>(although I'm not convinced on the italic.) By introducing Minion or a similar text/display face you will visually be able to connect the logo with other design elements within your identity (ie buisness card font, letterhead type, and whatever else you would need a hard working serif style typeface.) I think the memorability of the logo will come from the special r symbol you have created. The script is also hard to read at small sizes. Not to mention if the script is set in 10 point it will appear completely phony and reproduced. Conceptually if a script isn't printed at a handwritting size than I feel it is being used wrong. However that is my extremest opinion. Again, in my opinion, The Minion Version has more potential to be a solid identity.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">One of your main objectives you said is to relate to how each card had a certain amount of individuality/originality. Since the cards are being handmade, what if you stamped the logo? (Just the shape.) The printing inconsistencies would be great. If the type were printed, it would make a nice contrast. <BR> <BR>The logo and type right now aren't making a really good cohesive shape.. what if you had all caps spaced a little widely and planted the stem in between the letters? The shape could vary position between different letters maybe, adding more individuality to the logo &amp; cards. <BR> <BR>With the logo, it still seems like it needs more contrast. The leaf isn't really separating properly at the bottom and the bulb is a little large compared to the rest. Look at different fleurons or art nouveau patterns for inspiration? <BR> <BR>Keep us posted!</div>

I added the rectangle to solve some positioning problems between the logo and the wordmark. Conceptually I think it works well because it is emphasising the nature of the business: greeting cards. <BR>Brian had a nice idea about stamping the logo. This needs to be tested, but it might work even better with the rectangle around it. I just hope that it won't look too cheap. Otherwise I fear that people might not &quot;get&quot; that it's actually a feature. <BR> <BR>Please give me your feedback on the latest version.

		<div class="commentbody">Good point about the type, Tiffany. I could agree that some more contrast might not be bad. Regarding the box: You have to imagine this printed fairly small on the back of a greeting card. I printed it out at that size and the white on black version (the one I am leaning more towards) looks very nice IMO, especially when seen from a distance. the box does catch your eye.. <BR> <BR>I like that the format of the box resembles the format of the greeting card and the flower on it describes the flowers on the actual cards.  <BR> <BR>How do others feel about it? <BR> <BR>I'm not entirely happy about the shape yet. Maybe I could go for smaller details. A little bit like the new Unilever U.   <BR> <BR>more comments please!</div>

		<div class="commentbody">In your earlier posts what I saw, and found to be very nice, was a flower growing out of the type .. this new version is completely devoid of that. I understand needing to be printed very small on the back of a card. However, I don't think it needs to be boxed in. You can play with scale for that. The type (ground) can be larger while the flower (r) is smaller, or vice versa, depending upon the situation.</div>
