  body: "Year\u2019s End\r\nRichard Wilbur\r\n\r\nNow winter downs the dying of the
    year,\r\nAnd night is all a settlement of snow;\r\nFrom the soft street the rooms
    of houses show\r\nA gathered light, a shapen atmosphere,\r\nLike frozen-over lakes
    whose ice is thin\r\nAnd still allows some stirring down within.\r\n\r\nI\u2019ve
    known the wind by water banks to shake\r\nThe late leaves down, which frozen where
    they fell\r\nAnd held in ice as dancers in a spell\r\nFluttered all winter long
    into a lake;\r\nGraved on the dark in gestures of descent,\r\nThey seemed their
    own most perfect monument.\r\n\r\nThere was perfection in the death of ferns\r\nWhich
    laid their fragile cheeks against the stone\r\nA million years. Great mammoths
    overthrown\r\nComposedly have made their long sojourns,\r\nLike palaces of patience,
    in the gray\r\nAnd changeless lands of ice. And at Pompeii\r\n\r\nThe little dog
    lay curled and did not rise\r\nBut slept the deeper as the ashes rose\r\nAnd found
    the people incomplete, and froze\r\nThe random hands, the loose unready eyes\r\nOf
    men expecting yet another sun\r\nTo do the shapely thing they had not done.\r\n\r\nThese
    sudden ends of time must give us pause.\r\nWe fray into the future, rarely wrought\r\nSave
    in the tapestries of afterthought.\r\nMore time, more time. Barrages of applause\r\nCome
    muffled from a buried radio.\r\nThe New-year bells are wrangling with the snow."
