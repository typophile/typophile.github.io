  Ken Burnsian to say the least, which by my book s is not a recommendation.\r\n\r\nThey
  show 'reenactments' of a sort, reading letters as if we, the audience, are present
  at the time they are written, but the letters look old. They were new when the were
  written for Christ sake. It pisses me off. \r\n\r\nThank you for you patience.\r\n\r\nR"

    therapy for people like me, who watch a movie that's supposed to be taking place
    in 1925, and freak out when we see somebody reading a London <em>Times</em> with
    Stanley Morison's 1931 masthead on it. "

    a close-up of her (the actress, that is) writing in a very nice and not anachronistic
    hand.\r\n\r\nAt least, I think that was the movie and what happened."

    Dan Rather really should have known about the impossibility of superscripting
    with a manual typewriter\u2026"
