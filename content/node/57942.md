  \ I'm currently \"between\" jobs and doing some freelance graphic work for a client
  while looking for something permanent.  The uses 3 specific fonts in his logo, but
  has no idea what fonts were used.  The graphic designer is no longer in business.
  \ Can you all help identify them?  They are probably all incredibly easy to identify,
  but I'm new to this and can't seem to track them down.\r\n\r\nHere is the first
  sample.   Many thanks in advance for any and/or all help.  The second image file
  will follow.\r\n\r\n- SN"
