body: I am to design the end of year student exhibition, titled &#34;launchbox&#34;,
  the target audience is fellow design students. They want to be impressed with something
  different, not the usual everday work of peers.  <BR> <BR>I have harsh, but delightful,
  limitations to the brief. I am restricted to only B&amp;W and Type only. I am pursuing
  an original solution to this problem.   <BR> <BR>What do you think of this concept?
  Comments and crituque, please welcome. <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/35556.gif"

  body: Cool! My only suggestion is that I would make the &#34;lid&#34; of the box
    come off at a diagonal. Right now it looks like it&#39;s supposed to be a &#34;b&#34;.

  body: I agree with John B. <BR> <BR>And maybe move the &#34;you are invited&#34;
    text aside, maybe even place somewhere &#34;normal&#34;, instead of part of the
    concept.
