body: "This is a business card for an event planner looking to diversify from mostly
  non-profit, performing arts-type organizations.\r\n\r\nI\u2019m being rushed through
  this business card design, and I\u2019ve been looking at it for too long. \r\n\r\nBasically
  the \u201CNH\u201D mark can\u2019t be changed, the angled grid is a must and I can
  only really change fonts. \r\n\r\nThe idea is to contrast the mark using a script
  or serif with something more \u201Corganic,\u201D but not \u201Ctoo frilly.\u201D
  \r\n\r\nSo please, someone say anything to get me thinking about these boxes differently--thanks!\r\n\r\n"

    in black is a bit much. Can you have \"Event Studio\" in black on gray? What if
    the NH (as in B) was the only reversal and the diagonal lines were black? Or maybe
    NH EVENT STUDIO could be white on black with everything else having a white background?
    \r\nWay too much black now."

  body: "If you can remove/thin down the gridlines, that will make it look less visually
    busy. Because you've got a lot going on with the lines, logo etc., I would discount
    using swash fonts and use something plain because  otherwise things will fight
    with each other, as you've got at the moment. What about using Helvetica?\r\n\r\nI
    actually like the black on the card, it's different. I would try using a warm
    black or deep rich dark colour to add some warmth to it - a lot of angles seem
    to make things look quite cold and clinical, so a warm colour might balance it
    out a bit."

  body: "I agree with Simon about thinning the lines and warming the black.\r\n\r\nThe
    Avenir variant does it for me; all the others look like the typestyle is fighting
    the underlying aesthetic. The role of that type should be to support the mark,
    rather than detract from it. Good luck."

    the type? Does this card have to stay in b/w?\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Thanks for the replys.\r\n\r\nPino: Yes, it's a lot of black. The card is
    printing in one color so I'm doing it this way until the type is decided. I'll
    play with the lines and boxes and look at ink/paper combinations again later.
    I started down that road and all the variations were leading to a \"freeze-up\"
    of sorts, if you know what I mean.\r\n\r\nBen: Busy, yes. I'd like to not have
    every part of this card be boxes, lines and triangles, but we were getting to
    a point where there was a lot to look at and decisions were getting harder to
    come by. The card is just the first part of an ID package, but the rush means
    I'm picking type for the ID to work across everything while actually doing just
    the card.\r\n\r\nSeb: The type needs to contrast because we're trying to say \"reliable,
    organized, exacting/personable, elegant, approachable.\" What with the mark being
    Avenir (and decided already), I've got to use either a contrasting type or some
    \"organic\" element(s?) paired with the mark (which the client has already indicated
    a predisposition against--not that it still couldn't work).\r\n\r\nSo you see
    my limitations, now. This card is basically a rough that's just being used to
    try-out type indended to contrast the mark. It'd be better to do outside the context
    of the card, but she wants to print this thing all of a sudden, so it's turning
    into a bit of a mashup."
