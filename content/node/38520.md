body: Diesel is running a "Fuel for Life" campaign and at the end of this specific
  commercial there is a graphic on the left that say "FUEL for LIFE". Does anyone
  know what serif font FUEL and LIFE is and even more importantly what the "for" is
  (if it isn't the same). See the commercial on YouTube at http://youtube.com/watch?v=omIUXWvmCYU

    and \"LIFE\" might be a <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/search/?q=baskerville&sample_text=FUEL%20LIFE&sample_size=60\">Baskerville</a>.\r\n"
