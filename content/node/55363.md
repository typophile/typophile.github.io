body: "My favorite graphic designers of all time is Saul Bass. He is best know for
  his movie title sequences, but was also known for his graphic design, including
  movie posters and corporate identities. His work forms around solid colors, geometric
  layouts, montage, hand drawn type and dominant symbolism. At the time his work was
  extremely innovative and I find his design to be timeless and contemporary even
  today. His movie poster designs are simple and iconic, overwhelmingly powerful,
  eye catching and always evoke a feeling or mood captured to perfection.\r\n\r\nBass
  reinvented the movie title as an art form and created them to be an introductory
  to the feel of the film and worked with some of the most notable directors ever,
  such as Hitchcock, Scorcese and Kubrick. I was exposed to a lot of his work while
  in taking film courses in school. My all time favorite and first known exposure
  to his work is the vertical bar sequence from Psycho, which was so visually striking
  it has always stuck in my mind (it also stuck in my mind because we analyzed psycho
  scene by scene for half a semester). It's movement was also inspirational for my
  type poster design from last semester in Typography I based on the typeface Interstate
  by Tobias Frere-Jones.  \r\n\r\nHe also created very strong logos, including those
  for the Girls Scouts of America, United Airlines, United Way and AT&T.\r\n\r\nThe

  body: "Saul Bass was my favourite graphic designer too. His best main title design
    is for Alfred Hitchcock's PSYCHO, with its erratic horizontal & vertical bars
    gliding in and out to Bernard Herrmann's jarring music score. I recently re-created
    & adapted his design for an imagined 2009 version of the movie, as if Hitchcock
    was alive now and making the movie with a brand new cast. If  anyone would care
    to see & evalute my effort there are 2 links to download it below. The AVI version
    is smaller (8-9mb). The DVD version is 150mb. here are the links, a screengrab
    from my version, and a poster too.\r\n\r\nhttp://rapidshare.com/files/259739821/Psycho__2009_.AVI.html

  body: 'Your recreation looks great Steviebaby. I really like the poster and the
    font works perfectly, but I do find that the name Kate Winslet gets a bit mixed
    up with Christian Bale and Naomi Watts names, maybe play with the size a bit...Great
    casting choices. I would love to see a remake done with Tarantino and Tim Burton,
    that would be interesting to see how they would blend their styles to make a rather
    strange and gory film, if even possible. Anything would be better than Gus Van
    Sant''s remake. '
