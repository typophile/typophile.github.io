body: "I'm looking for help identifying the font used in the introduction to this
  1898 book published by George Bell and Sons.  I tried WhatTheFont and didn't find
  anything close.  I also tried Identifont and it suggested Fleischman BT Pro Bold,
  which is in the right ballpark but not quite right.\r\n\r\nThis should be a link
  directly to the first page of the introduction:\r\n\r\nhttp://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=nyp.33433066623293;page=root;view=image;size=100;seq=15;num=v\r\n\r\nAnd
  the whole book is available from Google: http://books.google.com/books?id=olgCAAAAYAAJ\r\n\r\nAny
  help you can give me would be appreciated.  Even if you can't help, if anybody has
  any advice about how to approach a historical question like this one, that would
  also be helpful as well.\r\n\r\nSample:\r\n<img src=\"http://typophile.com/files/Lower

  body: There are resemblances to Miller and Richards' Old Style, as well as ATF's
    Old Roman; unfortunately, I don't think either has been digitized...

  body: "A problem (for me) with your sample is that there are no upper case letters.
    Using the structural features of the a, b, e, g and y there were 109 serif families
    that were potential matches. Many are obviously not close, but because there are
    many fonts based on old types some could be close, but without seeing the upper
    case letters (especially E, J, K, M, R, U and W) it is not easy to eliminate many
    of them. \r\n\r\nAssuming you have a sample that shows many of those, you can
    use the <a href=\"http://bowfinprintworks.com/SerifGuide/serifsearch.php\">Serif
    Font ID Guide</a> to see if any fonts are close to your sample.\r\n\r\n- Mike

  body: "I hadn't tried it with the Serif Font ID Guide\u2014I'll give it a try and
    see what I come up with.\r\n\r\nYou're also completely right about the sample
    being all lowercase.  That was pretty dumb of me.  Here's another sample with
    a bunch of capital letters:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/capitals_4848.jpg]\r\n\r\nThe
    Q is pretty distinctive."

  body: "I looked at the title page and found a few upper case letters. Using those
    I would say Caslon SB from Scangraphics, or Caslon Rough from E+F, or the font
    called Coldstyle could all be reasonably similar styles in digital form.\r\n\r\n-

    a W:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/why_5439.png]\r\n\r\nAnd here's a
    J:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/January_4879.png]\r\n\r\n(Neither letter
    were in the sample I posted above, but both were needed for the guide.)\r\n\r\n--\r\n\r\nDoes
    anyone have any general advice on how to go about researching a historical font
    like this? I'm new to the world of typography, but I have a solid background in
    how to conduct research and am not afraid of the library\u2014I just really don't
    know where to start on a question like this.\r\n\r\nIf George Bell and Sons was
    still in business, I would probably end up sending them a letter asking if they
    had any clue, but they went out of business in the 1980s."

  body: "I don't think Binney OS is the answer. The tail of the 'y' in Binney is too
    short, for one thing. Binney isn't old enough, for another, since it was designed
    in 1908.\r\n\r\nI think Caslon is a reasonable choice, and Caslon has the right
    Q also. It has been one of the most widely used typefaces for at least 150 years.
    Caslon was designed in 1725.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
