  body: "ah HA! Barely visible arrows in the top right corner which act as a \u201Clike\u201D
    or \u201C+1.\u201D They also appear to act as a bookmark of sorts.\r\n\r\nHowever,
    I\u2019m going to throw out an EPIC FAIL on this one by giving people the ability
    \u201Chate\u201D or \u201C-1\u201D in that it has the potential to discourage
    discourse (most likely by young and/or new members of the community) out of fear
    of being \u201Chated.\u201D\r\n\r\nJust stick with the up arrow."
