body: "Hello.  I'm new on here, so I'm not really sure how this works.  But I'll give
  it a shot.  I'm looking for this font.  It has the two-story a & g, round dots on
  j & i, but the spurs on the m & r seem to be notched differently than anything I've
  found.  It looks like a simple font, but for the life of me I can't find it.\r\n\r\nAny
  help would be great!  I've tried Optima, Futura, News Gothic, Franklin Gothic, etc,
  etc.  \r\nThanks!"
