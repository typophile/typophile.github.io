  the overlapping extensions that Gill Sans has in it's italic forms (mainly the lower

    usage, such as -- is this for the development of a word mark (logo) or publication
    which requires multiple weights (medium, bold, italic, bold italic, etc.).\r\n\r\nSome
    aspects of Frutiger Next are similar, but then again, there are only two weights,
    Frutiger Next Light and Light Italic.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Gill_Sans_it.png]\r\nGill

  body: "sorry about that... It will be used primarily in a word mark but I am thinking
    we will need complimentary text weight faces for standard publication usage as
    well. If there is a face that will compliment in the publication text, we can
    use that, but it would be nice to have one face across the board.\r\n\r\nI really
    like Frutiger next, but the lack of weights might be an issue. ITC johnson might
    work too, thanks guys! I will give them a try. If anyone has any other comments
    or questions, I would love to hear them.\r\n\r\nThanks again!"
