body: The idea that this typeface is based on the period of gestation and growth of
  a human baby. Each character has the ability to grow, but they all don&#39;t grow
  the same and equally; just like humans. They&#39;re all different.<img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/27896.jpg"

  body: Hello, Heather.  <BR> <BR>Perhaps the first setting &#40;least organic&#41;
    should be more normalized. This might exaggerate the gestation process. For instance,
    you could start with simple &#40;yet nothing round&#41; shapes and they could
    be come more complicated &#40;organic, curvy&#41;. My suggestion isn&#39;t so
    different from what you&#39;ve done, I only suggest it because I wonder if there
    needs to be more contrast.
