  <BR> <BR>I&#39;ve looked at numerous Bauhaus styles and it looks closest to Chalet
  Paris 70 which isn&#39;t quite right. <BR> <BR>Any help is very much appreciated!

  body: It looked very familiar to me right away, especially the &#34;R.&#34; I would
    have ID&#39;d it sooner, but one of my sourcebooks mis-identified it as Ronda,
    and I knew that couldn&#39;t be right. Feh!
