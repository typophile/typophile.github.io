  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Kinda stuck on trying to get this to work. <BR> <BR>The client likes the repeating angled logo lockup.  Alludes to film (they will make political commercials), and sort of hints at the idea of &quot;red tape&quot; (turning this metaphor on its head as they are anti-bureaucracy). <BR> <BR>My problem is trying to figure out how to deal with the contact info.  Should I angle it or keep it horizontal.  My goal would be to make it work angled, but it seems to work better on the business card than the letterhead. <BR> <BR>Also, if any angled Identities come to mind, please pass them along. <BR> <BR>thanks. <BR>peter <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/cgibin/board-post.pl?action=posting_upload_form&what=show&img=49543" alt="can.gif"></div>

		<div class="commentbody">I don't mind that the logo is the only angled element. It helps it stick out a bit.  <BR> <BR>It does seem to work well on the card, though. I like the staggered one. Working on the diagonal actually gives you a bit more room in terms of line lengths to work with. <BR> <BR>BTW, very nice solution overall. Have you considered actually getting sticker-tape with that printed on it? (Kind of like the continuous rolls of printed tape they stick on your gallons of milk at the grocery store&hellip;)</div>

		<div class="commentbody">thanks guys.  there's been some discussion that having the contact info and the logo on a diagonal might be too much. <BR> <BR>I'm torn.

		<div class="commentbody">A from the first post is the best one. compact, personality and clean (fewer small elements salted in the layout), Nice. I would just rethink the business card. Looks weak, it should be bolder. try swap colors, red background, separate info in front/back could help. The size compromises the look of both elements in the same space.  <BR> <BR>cheers <BR>h</div>

		<div class="commentbody">&gt; <BR> <BR>I think it would weaken the association. But I am going to try it anyway. Just so you call know I am working on a diagonal pattern of CAN letters that spell can diagonally up and down. This will be full coverage on the back of the card. And might be reversed out over red. <BR> <BR>Will post that here shortly. <BR> <BR>Q: would it be bad form to stagger the type on the card, but not stagger it on the letterhead (like in A)? <BR> <BR>Seems like staggering on the letterhead isn't working. <BR> <BR>Posts coming soon.

		<div class="commentbody">Well, actually you might aply that to the system. But it's up to u, either you do it or not it's stil same strong identity, just 2 diferent aplications. I rally like your aproach to this project, but I would simplify it a bit. Try this, white ifon in the red background in one side, all red not pattern, pattern is dated, always, after a while you get tired of that, doesn't matter how nice it looks at first sight. logo in the other side exactly how it is. Again, I know you like assymetry that's ok. In type that is given beautifully by left alignment. so why do you got stuck in tha stagged type. doesn't work for, just look a wank design. you are mixing too  much in my opinion. SIMPLE AND EFFECTIVE, keep in mind.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Helder, <BR>I think I might agree with you on the staggering, I just need to convince the client/the group.  It does look kind of wank <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif" ALT=":-&#41;" BORDER=0>  But it also works too.  To my eyes this morning though, the cleaner the better. <BR> <BR>The pattern is also there to imply the metaphor of lots of people in a network.  Which the goal of this group, build a big network of creatives nationwide, ready to help out on progressive media projects.  <BR> <BR>I also like how phrenetic and &quot;active&quot; it is.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">The only thing I might look at in the pattern (wich i think will add a nice touch to the system) is that it takes a while to understand the repetition of the acronym &quot;can.&quot; Maybe if the pattern is not about the word can and more about the shape that makes the three letters you might come up with more pleasing patterns&hellip; <BR> <BR>The vertical negative space between can's in different &quot;rows&quot; could improve too&hellip;</div>
