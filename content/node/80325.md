  body: The posted sample is similar to Berthold Fashion but not an exact match. There
    are differences in crossbar of the E, the shape of the C, the height of the crossbars,
    the width of some of the letters, etc.

  body: Do you think it might be a customization of Berthold? I will take a look.
    Thank you very much.

  body: "Sorry, I meant Bernhard Fashion, not Berthold.\r\n\r\nI don't think it's
    a customization. The many differences, albeit subtle ones, suggest that it's a
    separate typeface."
