  -- but wouldn't mind knowing the name of the sans-serif above it as well.\r\n\r\nIf
  anyone has any other similar suggestions (preferably suitable for print rather than
  web) they would be greatly appreciated too.\r\n\r\nThank you for the help."

  body: "This is definitely not correct, but a similar typeface (which is monospaced)
    is Prestige Elite Standard. This has a couple extra quirky features though. Would
    like to know what it might be exactly.\r\n\r\nFor the above, not a lot to go on.
    Could be just Helvetica bold (or 85 neu weight), but will be a family of that
    ilk."
