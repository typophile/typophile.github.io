  body: "I viewed the video. One thing surprised me: when I hear of an 18 unit system,
    I think of Monotype. And with Monotype, different typefaces had a parameter called
    \"set width\": that is, you could have an 18 point typeface, but 18 units could
    equal an 18 point em or a 17 \xBE point em, or a 17 \xBD point em, or a 17 \xBC
    point em, or a 17 point em, and so on. (The phrasing is because a distance of
    18 points across is normally called two-thirds of a pica em, or an 18 point em,
    since in typography the point is strictly a unit of vertical distance.)\r\n\r\nSince
    the 18 unit system of the phototypesetting system Matthew Carter worked on limited
    how he could create intermediate versions of a typeface intended to have multiple
    condensed forms, apparently it didn't retain this feature of Monotype.\r\n\r\nHowever,
    this is not <em>too</em> surprising. Since most phototypesetting systems used
    magnification to get different point sizes, the different point sizes of a typeface
    weren't designed individually. As soon as set width doesn't equal point size,
    you wind up either with having to design each point size individually (since 17/18
    doesn't exactly equal 15/16 and so on) or having to use anamorphic lenses. Many
    phototypesetting systems did have anamorphic lenses, but compensating for a set
    width offset would have required complicated cams."
