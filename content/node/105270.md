  Industries CoopBlack display face to do some of the titling.\r\n\r\nWe've been doing
  some testing with an early years education centre, and they have raised the issue
  that kids in the game's age group (2-4) have not yet been taught to read capital
  letters. Unfortunately CoopBlack is caps only!\r\n\r\nThere is a lower case version
  of the face which was created by Christian Schwarz for Toys R Us, but it's not publicly
  available: http://www.orangeitalic.com/coop.shtml\r\n\r\nCan anyone recommend a
  similar fun and chunky display face with a lower case?\r\n\r\nAll suggestions greatly
  appreciated!"
