  Idea I had for the design include a bomberplane pinup design (WW2 style)... I'm
  a bit stuck ... any thoughts/ideas from you lot would be appreciated.\r\n\r\nName
  of the boat is \"Baby\" :) \r\n\r\n-Kjartan  \r\n\r\n "

  body: "Your boat doesn't <em>need</em> a pinup--it's sexy enough on its own. Also,
    you've got a small space to work with, the transom of a 15-foot (or so) boat.
    \r\nIf I had a gorgeous vintage boat like that, and it had a name with only four
    letters, I'd put the name either in something with the feel of brush-script lettering
    from 1950s advertising, like this: \r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/nautigal_5868.gif]
    (coincidentally, this is called TheNautiGal, from TypeSETit) or something with
    elegant flourishes, like this:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/olidia_4042.gif]
    (Olidia from insigne).\r\n\r\nIf you're determined to have a WWII bomber-style
    pinup, here's one that goes well with your boat's name:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Pix_07_6590.jpg]"
