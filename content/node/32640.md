  or any similar ones would be nice as well.

  body: "I don't recognize the typeface used.  It's possible it's something that has
    been heavily edited, since the V and cross-shaped T are almost certainly not normal
    font letters. A font that I think is close enough to be a good starting point
    to re-create this is Luiz Da Lomba's <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/t26/toulouse-lautrec-theatre-antoine/\">'Th\xE9\xE2tre
    Antoine'</a>, from his Toulouse Lautrec set. The feeling and some of the curves
    are similar, to my eye.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: thanks for that. Its pretty nice, but it would have to be heavily modded from
    there. Anyone know of a closer match?

  body: yeah, a lot of the logo does match zebrawood. However several other parts
    are heavily modified. great job whoever did it.
