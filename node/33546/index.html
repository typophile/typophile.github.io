  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>I&rsquo;m looking for a typeface for my school newspaper to complement Farnham, which we use for headlines, and Mercury, used for body text. I redesigned the newspaper over the summer and have been using Myriad Pro for sidebars and captions and Chaparral Pro for &ldquo;nuts and bolts&rdquo; (all the text not tied to any particular story). Both faces have served me well, but now that the redesign has had some time to breathe, I want to get something that <em>really</em> works with the design.</p>
<p>What I&rsquo;m looking for: I want a typeface that can be used for everything other than headlines and body text: pullout quotes, the masthead, captions, jumplines, etc. Because we have a very tiny staff that, while willing to learn, does not have much in the way of training in graphic design, I&rsquo;d like the typeface to be extremely typographically interesting; it should not recede, but rather pop, to make up for potentially uninteresting layouts. I chose Farnham for this reason; it&rsquo;s strong angularity and serifs are extremely forceful and compelling. Mildly contradictorily, the fonts should be clean &ndash; nothing <em>incredibly</em> distracting to the reader. Finally and obviously, the typeface needs to work well with Farnham and Mercury, as well as within the confines of a newspaper.</p>
<p>After some research, I came up with three very strong contenders: <a href=http://fontbureau.com/fonts/Amplitude>Amplitude</a>, <a href=http://www.typography.net/type/shaker.htm>Shaker</a>, and <a href=http://stormtype.com/typefaces-fonts-shop/families-23-john-sans>John Sans</a>. Amplitude has the requisite character, and <a href=http://www.creativepro.com/story/feature/22547.html>Christian Schwartz himself says</a> that it works well with Farnham. Shaker shares Amplitude&rsquo;s and Farnham&rsquo;s angularity, but is a bit subtler (although not too much so). John Sans is a softer typeface, which adds a nice touch of contrast, is based on a transitional model like Farnham is, and has letterforms that are funky enough for me.</p>
<p>So, first, does anyone know which of those three I listed will work especially well/fail miserably? And second, are there any that I should definitely consider as well? Thanks a ton for any assistance.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Thanks for the ideas, Marc. I had glossed over the whole 19th century grotesque revival genre, thinking that it wouldn&rsquo;t send a message of freshness and modernity, but on further reflection the typefaces you mentioned could be strong possibilities.</p>
<p>One thing I forgot to mention as a criterion is that the type needs to be immediately recognizable as new and different not just to the typographically aware but to a typical reader: again, I want the type to stand out to generate some design &ldquo;points&rdquo; when the layout in general might not. With this in mind, I think that FF Bau and FF Hydra are too subtle for my purposes (although I was planning on buying FF Bau for use in other projects). And I have to rule out Champion because of the lack of italics, which we use frequently.</p>
<p>But Maple and Parry Grotesque could both work well (although the more conservative members of the staff might find them too extravagant). I&rsquo;ll have to print out the PDFs and get a feel for them. Any other suggestions on typefaces or comments on the ones already listed?</p>

		<div class="commentbody">Thanks for reminding me of Parisine, Steve; I&rsquo;ve long admired it, but didn&rsquo;t think of it for this project. Parisine may be a bit tame for my vision of the design, but Parisine Plus is alluring. Even with the simplified alternate letterforms in one of the stylistic sets, however, it might be too distracting for body text. I&rsquo;m also concerned about Parisine&rsquo;s origin as signage type, as I&rsquo;m not sure whether it will work in editorial use. Probably would, though.</div>

<p>&ldquo;[Parisine Plus] might be too distracting for body text.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Which is it? Everything other than body text or body text?</p>
<p>To each his own, but I find Maple distracting and annoying (the wedge stroke ends (b, d, p, q, n, etc.; the number 5). I also have questions about Maple&rsquo;s readability, especially in the heavier weights. I was being kind when I said &ldquo;idiosyncratic&rdquo;. But my annoyance may be someone else&rsquo;s delight.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>You&rsquo;re right; when I said body text recently, I meant longer passages in sidebars. Since sidebars generally don&rsquo;t have too much text, a distinctive typeface could be fine, but Parisine Plus might be just <em>too</em> distinctive.</p>
<p>And after looking at Maple and Parry Grotesque more, I&rsquo;m not sure if they&rsquo;re ideal. They have an intentional feeling of awkwardness, which I like, but I don&rsquo;t think it works with the refined yet powerful feeling of Farnham. I&rsquo;ll offer them up to the other staffers nevertheless.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Marc, I didn&rsquo;t see those ink traps until you pointed them out to me; lucky that MyFonts lets me view up to 72 pts! While they do add some more flair, I&rsquo;m concerned that most student readers won&rsquo;t find it as distinctive as I&rsquo;d like them to. I want to be sure that even the least typographically knowledgeable person will know, &ldquo;This isn&rsquo;t just Helvetica.&rdquo; While that may not happen, that&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m aiming for. Also, I get a techno/machined-grunge feel from the letterforms, which isn&rsquo;t what I want.</p>
<p>I am still quite interested in people&rsquo;s opinions on the three I listed earlier: Amplitude, Shaker, and John Sans. Most people I&rsquo;ve asked seem to prefer Amplitude or Shaker, but I&rsquo;m wondering if anyone has had any experience with the three or could give me some guidance. The difficulty is that I&rsquo;m infatuated with all of them, so I&rsquo;m having trouble choosing just one. It&rsquo;s what they call a good problem.</p>

	<div class="card-body">
		<div class="commentbody"><p>Thanks for the quick response, Tiff, but I&rsquo;m not mixing the two within one line. Farnham (Medium, both roman and italic) is used only for headlines, with Mercury for body text. The sans I get will be used for captions, pull quotes, folios, the masthead, credit lines, etc. (although bylines and subheads might be in it as well, so maybe there will be a closer relationship).</p>
<p>I had investigated Neutraface, along with Verlag, Terminal Design&rsquo;s Tangent, Font Bureau&rsquo;s Relay, and Jim Parkinson&rsquo;s Richmond, after seeing a newspaper or two combine Farnham and Mercury with a geometric sans. My concern was that the exactness of the genre might clash with the strong yet refined brashness of Farnham. Also, I wasn&rsquo;t sure if these sans-serifs might give too strong an Art Deco feel (whenever I look at People Magazine, for example, I always get that sense). Farnham also has a historical sense to it, but I have found it to be more subtle, especially when used in a modern newspaper setting. Nevertheless, I&rsquo;ll take another look at these, so thanks for the impetus.</p>
<p>When thinking about Amplitude and Shaker, however, I did have the concern that you mentioned of whether they might be too similar to Farnham. This was why I was thinking about the softer John Sans and Steve&rsquo;s great suggestion of Parisine Plus, but the few editors to whom I have shown type samples so far have preferred Amplitude and Shaker.</p>

		<div class="commentbody">As usual, I spent too long debating every little merit of each typeface and ended up coming right back to where I started: I finally bought Shaker as the secondary sans for the newspaper. (EDIT: The same thing happened when buying Farnham and Mercury in the first place: they were among my first choices, but I vacillated for over a month. In the future, I&rsquo;ll try to have more faith in my instincts.) Tiffany&rsquo;s suggestion got me thinking that Amplitude was too similar to Farnham and would feel monotonous, and John Sans and Parisine Plus didn&rsquo;t appeal to the other staffers (not newsy enough). So it came down to Neutraface and Shaker. After comparing them, I felt that the geometric Art Deco feel of Neutraface wasn&rsquo;t quite right for the publication, so Shaker it is. So far, I&rsquo;ve gotten a good response from my colleagues, and I&rsquo;m really looking forward to implementing it in the next issue. Thanks again to everyone who chimed in; I really appreciate your suggestions and concerns.</div>
