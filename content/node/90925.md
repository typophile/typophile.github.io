body: "I'm not a designer, just the editor,  but I'm noting in horror that our new
  typeface Garamond ITC by BT (not sure what the BT means) displays inconsistent spacing
  after a terminal punctuation--periods and colons.  Most of the time, at our point
  size (9), it seems that the initial letter of the following sentence is \"jammed\"
  right up to the period. At other times, depending on the letter, it's not.\r\n\r\nIt'
  less noticeable before a B or a W. But jams right up against an \"A\"  (.A ). A
  \"T\" seems to almost overhang the period. It's pretty damn close to the \"H,\"
  too. As well as a quote mark. (.\")\r\n\r\nWhat's causing this? Is there any way
  to fix it, globally?  BTW, I'm not fond of this font (x-height seems so high). But
  we have a far amount of leading, so tolerable. \r\n\r\nAlso, I just copied this
  from the pdf over to a Word page and there's NO space before the offenders mentioned
  above (pairs that look too tight). What's going on???\r\n\r\nThanks for any advice.
  I'm not sure I can get the publisher to change fonts in this redesign. I note that
  a magazine he likes uses the same ITC Garamond font -- but with much more leading
  than we use (I don't like that version either) but they have healthy spaces before
  the next sentence.\r\n\r\nI'm not an expert at all this...so speak in layman's terms,
  if you please!  MH"

  body: This sounds like it is not a problem with the font but rather one with someone
    leaving out the space between sentences. BT stands for Bitstream and they produce
    quality fonts and all of the Garamonds I have by them do not display the problem
    you point out.

  body: "<cite>oops...tried to upload a screen shot. That didn't work. Could this
    be due to anything but the font and is it possible to fix kerning between a period
    and a space?!<cite>\r\n\r\nSure, depending on the layout program. With InDesign,
    just change the kern value used each time it happens. Better is to fix the kern
    values in the font (and make sure the typesetter doesn't use \"optical\" as opposed
    to \"metrical\" kerning), but strictly, that depends on whether or not the End
    User Licensing Agreement (EULA) permits modification to the font. Less strictly,
    I can't think of any font publisher who would object to an end user fixing a kerning
    bug.\r\n\r\nWith what you describe: the capital letter *A* overhangs it's setwith
    (negative sidebearings) in many fonts, so it can be hard to say what's going on
    with an *A*, but your description of the *T* does make it sound like a kerning
    issue. Probably a kern between the space and the next letter, with the period
    being an innocent bystander, but the effect of that is as you describe.\r\n\r\nThere
    are still a lot of space-kern problems in 2012. Adobe's Janson has such issues
    -- the sum of the kerning in the string *f_space_quotedblleft* gives a result
    where the f becomes closer to the open quotes than the quotes to the following
    letter, even though there really is a space in the text.\r\n\r\nIf this is professionally
    set, mark the proofs and tell the typesetter to fix it. If it isn't professionally
    set -- now you know why there are \"real\" typesetters.\r\n\r\n<cite>Edit</cite>\r\n\r\nBy
    the way, I think your instincts about ITC Garamond are spot on. It is a bit of
    a joke around the type community I inhabit -- though that's admittedly the stogy
    book world. We think of it as an advertising face, best suited for, say, fast
    food placemats, where it was actually used . . . McDonald's, maybe?"

    the problem as a Printer's Error (PE). It's possible the situation was the result
    of bad composition, up to & including using \"optical kerning.\"\r\n\r\nIn any
    case, the compositor gets responsibility for all the muck-ups of the layout designer
    who chose the typeface, and the person who designed it. And, all you type designers
    out there biting your collective tongues, this is why we also we have to \"modify\"
    fonts.\r\n"

  body: "Charles--This is showing in the proofing PDFs done by the art director (not
    sure how you define \"professionally set\" with a typographer, didn't know such
    people existed in this day). I suppose he would be called the 'compositor' in
    this case.  i know he  doesn't want to have to comb the text each time for these
    errors. Nor does the editor.\r\n\r\nPardon my ignorance, but for review: in his
    program ( Quark), he  (ie.the \"compositor\") would  fix the  problem each time
    we see it happening or do it \"globally\" (this would be the metrical fix) by
    fixing kern values in the font. Is this easy -- or can it muck up things? I believe\r\n\r\nThe
    font package suggests Adobe ITC by BT f  (so assuming this is an adobe font...sold
    by bitstream? not sure of the relationship) \r\n\r\nAt any rate, it would be nice
    to know where he could get some advice on this -- calling Adobe sounds impossible.
    Are there experts (like yourself, perhaps) whom people can call about this font
    or issue? Or is it possible to upload an example of this to someone on this forum
    (off line...since this is a current issue and don't want it floating around).
    I'd love for someone to look at it because, truthfully all the spaces are tighter
    than I've ever seen. I'm wondering if its the point size for this particular font.
    \r\n\r\nThanks for all this to all. Very helpful .... \r\n\r\n MHL"

    will let you overwrite the kerning in the font as published. You can also specify
    using more space with the spaceband character generally, I believe. InDesign provides
    for this, too.\r\n\r\nBecause type is now *licensed* rather than *owned,* it can
    be hard to hire people to work on your fonts. And the skill is usually bundled
    in with the skills of a compositor or type designer. The cheap way is for your
    art director to learn a couple new tricks."
