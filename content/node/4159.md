body: Does anyone here have experience with sticking type on walls? I&#39;d think
  the material to use would be vynil... Is it common to find companies that do this
  and how expensive does it get? <BR> <BR>Thanks! <BR> <BR>Em

    very, smooth surface &#40;brushed metal/marble or polished stone,&#41; it won&#39;t
    work. It will peel off pretty soon. <BR> <BR>Some stores sell indoor vinyl <a
    href="http://www.dwr.com/search.cfm?action=search&amp;type=keyword&amp;k=blik&amp;x=9&amp;y=8"
    target="_blank">accessories</a> that are supposed to last longer but, I would
    go with the vinyl to create a template for painting over the wall. It will look
    better and will last longer... '

  body: Vynil, vinyl, it&#39;s all the same! ;-P <BR> <BR>Actually it&#39;s for my
    new appartment I will be taking over in July &#40;got lots of plans for that&#41;.
    So it&#39;s all standard painted walls. Can it be taken off and reused? <BR> <BR>Kyle,
    where&#39;s the company? I saw in your profile you&#39;re in Arizona. I&#39;m
    up in Montreal so it would probably make things expensive for nothing.

  body: 'My vinyl-cutting experience is from years ago, but: <BR> <BR>&#62;Can it
    be taken off and reused?  <BR> <BR>Nope. Not unless the substrates have changed
    quite a lot in the past 8-10 years. <BR> <BR>&#62;it would probably make things
    expensive for nothing. <BR> <BR>My guess is that the only &#39;added&#39; expense
    would be shipping &#40;minimal in my experience&#41;. Although make-ready and
    operation rates would probably be cheaper - as far as currecy conversion goes
    - in or around Montreal. <BR> <BR>That said, I don&#39;t know anyone who does
    C&amp;C vinyl cutting in Montreal. Perhaps in Winnipeg, but I don&#39;t know if
    that would save you very much in the end...'

  body: As an alternative, perhaps you could paint the walls with a magnetic paint
    &#40;contains ground iron, I believe&#41; &#40;available at Ikea although that
    could be wrong&#41;, cover it with paint that you like the look of &#40;the magnetic
    paint is dark grey&#41; and produce letters with  something like this <BR>link
    <BR>rather like the fridge magnet poetry. One good party and your walls are covered
    with obscenity. <BR>Tim

  body: Emilie - <BR> <BR>As mentioned, the vinyl cannot be removed with success but
    <BR>it does however stick to many surfaces. I&#39;m guessing you&#39;ll <BR>be
    sticking it to plaster or sheetrock walls - which it will do <BR>with ease. In
    fact, we used to have it on the walls of our  <BR>old apartment. White on white
    walls can look nice. <BR> <BR>We used Fast Signs. Basically the Kinkos of vinyl.
    There are two <BR>main grades - normal and heavy duty. The heavy duty will <BR>work
    outdoors and they claim it even sticks to cement.  <BR>I wouldn&#39;t suggest
    that, but the museum I used to work for <BR>has had the same vinyl on sheetrock
    walls for years.  <BR> <BR>Usually you can just send an Illustrator eps of your
    artwork. <BR>Be mindful of the sizes the shop has as it can dramatically alter
    the price.

  body: There are many grades and suppliers of vinyl for signage.  <BR>There are removable
    or low tack vinyl and vinyl that that is extremely permanent that it is used for
    identification on jet airliners. <BR>I would suggest that you talk to a number
    of sign companies that specialize in vinyl cut signage about the cost and your
    application use. <BR> <BR>Depending on the amount of copy an alternate would be
    to print out the copy on your printer and use that as a template for cutting or
    tracing to the walls. You can purchase low tack vinyl from office supply stores
    that can be pre cut by you and affixed to the wall as a template for painting
    the copy. <BR> <BR>gln

    the wall, otherwise it will bleed quite easy. <BR> <BR>

  body: I love the way a handcut cardboard stencil looks when not completely perfectly
    sprayed/painted &#40;bleeds, overspray and/or underspray.&#41;  <BR>And that&#39;s
    probably the cheapest way to apply type to your walls without being really good
    at  <BR>drawing ... <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"
    ALT=":-&#41;" BORDER=0> <BR>You can also cut a stencil in an overhead transparency
    and apply removable spray adhessive on the back. Stick that on the wall and you
    will be more likely to get a clean result. <BR> <BR>magnus
