body: "Hello,\r\n\r\nI'm trying to match this family, specifically the italic for
  the author's name. I figured it's Bodoni, but the swashes in the italic capital
  'T' and the italic lowercase 'k' are really throwing me for a loop.\r\n\r\nSince
  this is a reprint of a book that was originally published in 1959 with multiple
  printing through the 70s and 90s it may very well be something that wasn't digitized.
  That makes things difficult for a publisher who wants to add copy to the beautiful
  title page spread.\r\n\r\nHelp? Someone, please? Thanks!"

    Storm''s <a href="http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/storm/baskerville-original-pro/120-medium-italic/">Baskerville
    Original</a> is fairly close, but has the distinctive descending ''z'' that your
    sample lacks. MacGrew didn''t yield any better matches than that. Good luck! '

    Original Pro]] comes quite close.

  body: "Sorry to disagree, I would agree with Jan, I also think it's a Bodoni for
    ZEN AND JAPANESE CULTURE - look at the J and the R and the C for that matter too.\r\n\r\nPossibly
    Bulmer for the Italic.\r\n\r\nIf this was originally published in 1959 it could
    well have been decided by what fonts the typesetter had available.\r\n\r\nThe
    publisher's credit at the bottom is an entirely different serif of a small caps
    proportion."

    that it's Varityper cold-set type...
