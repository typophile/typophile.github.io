    the TREK logo before, and I think it was custom, but you can search the site for
    that thread.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: "Hello from Trek,\r\n\r\nAs previously asserted here on Typophile, the Trek
    wordmark is custom typography. It was designed by Joe Sutter, formerly of Milwaukee's
    Hanson Dodge + Sutter, who found inspiration in the classic Honda logotype. Having
    worked on the identity for our new world cup mountain bike team, I can confirm
    that <em>WORLD RACING</em> is indeed set in Herb Lubalin's Avant Garde Gothic&mdash;<a

    Avant Garde Gothic Std Book</a> to be more specific.\r\n\r\nKen"
