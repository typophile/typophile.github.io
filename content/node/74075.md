  the University of Wisconsin Oshkosh, but I don't really know where to go from here.
  I'd like to specialize in type design and custom lettering, but the program here
  hasn't really prepared me for that, and most of what I do know is from the few books
  in the library. This forum seems to be mostly populated by typographers who know
  their stuff, so I was hoping someone might be able to offer some advice? Graduate
  programs in type design (specifically) don't seem to be very common, but I <em>would</em>
  like to continue my education and refine my type skills. Anyone know of a good school
  for that?\r\n\r\nThanks guys. Any and all advice is greatly appreciated."
