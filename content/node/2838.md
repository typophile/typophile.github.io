  body: Hendrik, Don&#39;t try to force the lightbulb to be a GI, remember most of
    the end users are not designers and the idea will sail way over their heads. You
    might look at a typeface with Caps and Small Caps, with some contrast between
    the Caps and the small caps such as a tint of color or a second color. But define
    what is important, Is GI the most important thing or is it Generating Ideas, or
    is it a symbol. Focus on one direction, then explore other ideas.

  body: 'Hendrik,  <BR> <BR>    You have a million directions you can run with this,
    and more than a handful are interesting. <BR> <BR>-There&#39;s a lower case &#34;g&#34;
    in your yellow/purple post.  The bulb and the part that screws in form the &#34;g&#34;.  So
    you&#39;ve got a G and a g.   <BR> <BR>-What about making the part that screws
    in, the &#34;g&#34; &#40;lots of lowercase g&#39;s to try out&#41;?  <BR> <BR>-IdeaS:
    the plurality of this concept seems to be lost currently.  One &#34;i&#34; seems
    to represent one idea.  What about lots of i&#39;s as the beams on the outside
    of the bulb--no &#34;i&#34; inside.  Lots of i&#39;s: lots of ideaS. <BR> <BR>   To
    make the lightbulb clich'

  body: Great feedback Ty! I love the lower case &#34;g&#34; as lightbulb with many
    &#34;i&#34;s coming off as beams of light. In this case, the letterforms naturally
    present <i>many</i> possible soultions.  <BR> <BR> -t <BR>
