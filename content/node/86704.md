  working on it for a little over a week now, so this is still very much a work in
  progress. I feel like I've gotten as far as I can go on my own, and I'm looking
  for critical feedback for things that don't look right or are not correct.\r\n\r\nThanks
  in advance."

    diagonal strokes (/A/K/M/N/V/W/X/Y/).

    the thick serifs look less organic, more like tacked-on rectangles. '

  body: "I did something a little like this for a friend's album art. I'll come back
    with a link to it later.\r\n\r\nMy starting point was the five-line pica Italian
    in the white Taschen book -- A Visual History of Typefaces etc. As I was working
    on it, Chester Jenkins released Arbor. So I emailed him and asked about why he
    had dropped the triangular serifs which is the part that attracted me most to
    the idea. He had come to the shapes of Arbor without reference to Italian specimens,
    but he pointed me to Paul Barnes' Calson Italian which is really spectacular.\r\n\r\nIMO
    the reverse stress tends toward a 1970's feel if you draw glyphs like the R with
    a blobby leg. Alternatively you can bring in the triangle serifs which can give
    the shapes energy, I think because the diagonals counterpose the railway track
    feel of the big top and bottom slabs.\r\n\r\nIt's hard to get the right colour,
    especially when you compare the lightness of your M to the other glyphs. Also,
    I think your oval counters have an optical problem in that they swell at the edges
    -- more like a dog bone than a lozenge.\r\n\r\nWhen I did this I wound up with
    a squalid collection of black lumps, but at least it was fun."

  body: "Todd,\r\n\r\nThanks for all the feedback. I'm extremely new at type design
    (I've only been at this 2 weeks), so could you elaborate or show examples of what
    you are talking about? Specifically with the oval counters having optical problems?\r\n\r\nI
    haven't seen Arbor before or the Caslon Italian style, but really similar idea
    to what I was trying to pull off. The font started just as an experiment to see
    if this style was possible. I did some searches on MyFont and didn't see anything
    similar, so I decided to go for it.\r\n\r\nDo you think there's enough differences
    between this and Arbor to continue? Or would it be possible to add differences,
    so that there is more of a distinction? I also plan on releasing an extended version,
    as well as different weights.\r\n\r\nAgain, thanks for the great feedback. That's
    exactly what I was looking for."

  body: "I agree with eliason - letters that consist only of squares and lines look
    too much like a compromise.\r\n\r\nAlso, have you tried rounded base of U and
    Y (like your O)?\r\n\r\n"
