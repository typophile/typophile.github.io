  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>So ive started on two major identity projects. (major on my scale, which is probably small). . .</p>
<p>Im well versed on the design process, etc. But my real question comes to typeface choice. Ive built a good collection of fonts purchased from various vendors, however there are cases when I just dont have something that fits. My clients know nothing of fonts, or the importance of them. I have tried to explain liscensing and the general design and language of typefaces all to no avail. Both client have simply said why not make my design out of TNR or Arial because they are &ldquo;free.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I sample various fonts from vendors and the clients are displeased with the quality and leave the conversation with an &ldquo;I dont know&rdquo; show me something high quality. . . Pain.</p>
<p>Any tips on how to convince a client about selecting a nicely fitting and desinged face?
Am I barking up the wrong tree and should I bite the bullet in the name of good design, and hope that Ill have a client willing to explore next time?</p>
<p>My final question is regarding the purchase of a face for an identity.</p>
<p>Would I purchase a simple liscense to use a face for a logo? And then have to purchase multiple liscenses for each respective employee to use for the designed stationary, etc.?</p>
<p>Cheers</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s a valid question.</p>
<p>In the end, the typeface is an integral part of their visual identity. If they value that, then they should be able to accept the typeface as part of the overall package.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Would I purchase a simple liscense to use a face for a logo? And then have to purchase multiple liscenses for each respective employee to use for the designed stationary, etc.?&rdquo;</p>
<p>You&rsquo;d have your own license to create the logo. Once created, however, the logo is then just a piece of art that anyone in the company should be able to use.</p>
<p>If you are using a specific typeface for the stationery other than the logo, then yes, whoever is in charge of creating and updating the stationery would also need a license of the typeface.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>TNR and Arial are not just favored because they come pre-installed on every Windows and Mac PC, they also perform well on screen at small sizes, and have huge international character sets. Replicating the hinting quality and char set in a commercial or even custom font is difficult and expensive. I&rsquo;ve heard stories of several very large international companies balking at the cost of extending their shiny new corporate fonts to the required char set and level of hinting required by their &ldquo;peons&rdquo;.</p>
<p>So rather than fight the system work with it. Look at the commonly installed fonts say the Web fonts - Georgia is nice ;-) - or maybe Palatino Linotype, and build a logo and identity that works with them.</p>

<p>Simon, I know you&rsquo;re biased, but let&rsquo;s get real here. There is <!-- raw HTML omitted -->nothing<!-- raw HTML omitted --> unique about system fonts. When a font becomes a system font, it becomes the very opposite of the word, because <!-- raw HTML omitted -->everyone<!-- raw HTML omitted --> has it. This has nothing to do with the care, skill or design that has gone into it. The above examples also have the honor of being overused in the corporate world.</p>
<p>James, one way to convice them is to design your logo with whatever typeface you want and then show it to them using Comic Sans, Sand (or any other typeface that is completely different) and see how they react. They&rsquo;ll probably realize they notice type more than they thought.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Try pointing out, in the most diplomatic way possible, that they hired you to give their corporation a distinct identity and that, as Patty has pointed out, there is nothing distinct about TNR or Arial. If this doesn&rsquo;t work you can follow up with something along the lines of “Well, since you clearly have concluded that you don&rsquo;t want an identity, there&rsquo;s nothing more I can do for you, so I&rsquo;ll be keeping my deposit and ceasing work on this contract.” At least you can if your contract allows for that and if you got a deposit.</p>
<p>Also, have you tried putting together a Paul Rand style book that shows the type, the logo, and the colors, all with a flowing written explanation? You&rsquo;ll have a lot more luck that way, because then they&rsquo;ll feel like they&rsquo;re reading this stuff, learning, and coming to a conclusion on their own, as opposed to just being told what to think. I just got a copy of the book Rand did for NEXT, if you want I&rsquo;ll scan it for you.</p>

<p>No, really let’s get really real. How can you fault a company for ranking legibility and international support over uniqueness?</p>
<p>I think you also missed this part &ldquo;and build a logo and identity that works with them.&rdquo; - I wasn&rsquo;t suggesting that they use a core font for the logo. Look at Typophile, a great logo, identity and heading font that works well with Georgia ;-)</p>

<p>There are many well designed system fonts, but TNR and Arial are ubiquitous.

		<div class="commentbody">Terry, I was being a bit snarky too - sorry. It comes from having experiences from the other end when trying to use some unhinted custom fonts, with small character sets in Word and in presentations (most recently with the Xbox 360 fonts) - the experience made me value the core fonts. On top of that I often have to explain to customers (internal and external) why certain fonts have had less investment (hinting and char-set) than others, and that&rsquo;s hard too. Maybe I need a few of those brews. TGIF! ;-)</div>

<p>One of the best things you can do is make comps from sites that let you see what words look like. If the client okays them - buy the font - then add it to the bill.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s all part of the design service. If you cannot add a separate line for font - add the price to the extra time you took finding the font for the design.</p>
<p>And btw - headache charges are permitted.</p>

<p>Today I had a message from a client who wanted to change a design quite a lot, and not to a good direction. I did what was asked, but also suggested a third alternative, something between the two (closer to the first ;^) ). The third one was chosen, after the client&rsquo;s suggestion was proven not suitable.</p>

<p>Maybe I&rsquo;m just a grumpy old fart, but I gave up on dealing with DFI* clients awhile ago.</p>
<p>(There&rsquo;s an old, probably apocryphal, story told about George Bernard Shaw visiting in the U.S., who asked a woman if she would go to bed with him for $1,000,000. She responded &ldquo;why, of course sir!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But would you go to bed with me for $10?&rdquo; said GBS.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course not, what kind of woman do you think I am?&rdquo; she retorted, and was much offended.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know that already, I&rsquo;m just trying to establish the price.&quot;)</p>
<p>Some of us don&rsquo;t have a price&hellip;.</p>

<p>I also can&rsquo;t agree on designers showing options they don&rsquo;t like. It&rsquo;s like harming yourself (and others).</p>
<p>For me the only time when designer can show more than one option is the initial stage when he shows rough ideas and possibilities rather than completed work. If a client pays for one design he gets the best one you can do. Only one.</p>
<p>As for the corporate typeface it seems your client is not keen to spend money on fonts. BTW isn&rsquo;t it the letterhead the only document client would fill with Arial? You should then consider it as an option. I agree you can try talking about his &lsquo;uniqeness&rsquo;, but, to be honest, I think he won&rsquo;t buy licenses for his 40 offices :)</p>

Vatu is especially bad method from the designer&rsquo;s point of view. If the VP&rsquo;s wife doesn&rsquo;t like, let&rsquo;s say green, or her favourite colour is blue, that has a huge affect on the final design.</div>

<p>My biggest question spanning out of this is the liscensing. . . I understood all of the EULA&rsquo;s however I have no idea where the line gets drawn on the web ( I know that most require pixel format, an a certain percentage of the characters alphabet not to be exceeded). What I dont understand is when the client say wants to use a system font, such as Helvetica. . .for the reason being that they think its free. It still has to be licensed right? Its exceeding beyond personal use and into public showcase in the matter of using say Helvtica for a logo????</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m with Joe. But I feel your pain, particularly since it&rsquo;s hard to spec fonts when you don&rsquo;t own them. Sometimes it&rsquo;s a matter of having a sit-down with them and explaining the reason for using a non-typical font. It&rsquo;s hard to make someone care about the finer points of fonts, so know your battle before you go into it and be armed with a solid reason. Make it matter to them. Don&rsquo;t explain historical models, explain direct benefits: saving space, market disctinction, legibility, reader impact.</p>
<p>Maybe this is all repetition of stuff you know. I find that large samples printed from the font testers that most foundries offer work the best. Select three, create a compelling 20-second explanation of the benefits of each, get their reaction. Then, repeat with a more narrowly selected bunch. You have the power to control what fonts they see and the power to shape their understanding. Don&rsquo;t worry about showing them extensive text settings. Sell them on what YOU know, not what THEY see. If need be, try to find a PDF with a high-res sample to supplement.</p>
<p>At least, this is how I go about it.</p>
<p>Oh, also consider differentiating between internal memos and external communications. Sometimes only the marketing group/designers need the unique font, allowing them to use a font from the default set for the majority of their users.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I copied Dezcom&rsquo;s comment about Vanilla, etc. Seemed to make sense to them, but it came down to them claiming that there is no obvious difference between say Helvetica and Meta for example. . . (that shocked me)</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t really think about it as so much of a selling point but it really is. (still just getting my feet wet). I showed them way to many, and of course they said  they all look the same, and they still wanted to go with their &ldquo;free fonts.&rdquo;</p>
<p>No such thing as a free font if you want to give credit to such designers correct? Say they have Helvetica on their system Mac, if they want it used as a logo, they should purchase a license? Or is that license included in the fact that its bundled with the program or system?</p>

<p>If it came with their system, then they have a license by virtue of the OS they purchased.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Cheers aluminum, so in the case here for my client they don&rsquo;t in fact own a mac, but they have Studio 8 which I&rsquo;m sure includes helvetica. I&rsquo;m using my laptop there until they get me a mac (I&rsquo;m their in house). I would have to purchase a license for the companies use. correct?</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>So here&rsquo;s some advice that may sound weird and not so fun. I think you might need to lay low. A creative person stepping into a lion&rsquo;s den with business executives is almost always going to have the chips stacked against them. You should think about playing their game— print a memo with a well crafted explanation and/or examples to illustrate your point. If you try to rock the boat too early, you may come off like a newbie who is not realistic and doesn&rsquo;t understand the game.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m guessing you&rsquo;re still a little green because presenting &ldquo;too may options&rdquo; is a rookie mistake. :) Lord knows I&rsquo;ve made it. Don&rsquo;t overplay your hand.</p>
<p>Lastly, piggybacking off Joe&rsquo;s comment. I <!-- raw HTML omitted -->highly<!-- raw HTML omitted --> recommend changing the name of this thread. All your employers have to do is Google your name and they can find this thread.</p>

<p>Terry is right. Name-calling is generally a losing tactic. Just ask George Allen :)</p>
