  body: "Well, not all dictionaries. Also, many dictionaries use both sans and serif
    faces together, a common combination being a bold sans face for the entry headers
    and a serif face for the texts.\r\n\r\nTypefaces for reference works have to be
    somewhat neutral and not draw too much attention to themselves. In addition, they
    have to be readable at the small sizes that they are used in because of size constraints.
    There are both serif and sans serif faces that are suitable for such purposes,
    and well-designed dictionaries will use such faces.\r\n\r\nDon't get too stuck
    on the serif vs sans serif distinction. There are both serif and sans faces that
    make for good dictionary faces, and bad dictionary faces."

  body: "Dictionaries require a variety of typogrphic distinctions to act as a systematic
    way of presenting definitions. Traditionally, serif faces have had a broad variey
    inclusing italics, smallcaps, fraction height numbers, and oldstyle figures--rich
    formatting possibilities. Today, there are many more sans that have all the required
    stuff too.\r\n\r\nChrisL"

  body: "This is only a problem as perceived by you, Miss Giggles, as the dictionaries
    which you are familiar with use serif. It isn't a problem, it is just generalized
    tradition.\r\n\r\nJean Fran\xE7ois Porchez re-designed some dictionaries for a
    French publisher, I forget the name, using Le Monde Sans IIRC and it worked very
    well."

    haven't responded to your questions about serifs because I don't think you've
    done your homework first. I'm sure there are lot of others who feel the same way.
    \ \r\n\r\nIt would be more considerate to folks here if you would ask your questions
    first of your teachers--they are paid to help you--and also do some research in
    libraries. \r\n\r\nThen do ask here. "

  body: "It's not that the questions are silly, it just seems like you're asking the
    same question over and over in different forms. I agree with William that you
    should be consulting your teachers and perhaps you need to buy a book on the history
    of type and type design (sorry I don't have any titles in mind) and do some research
    on your own first. And then maybe try to ask more informed and specific questions
    if you aren't getting the answers you want from those sources, or want a greater
    variety of opinions.\r\n\r\nThis just feels like a barrage of repetitive questions
    about serifs - why is the sky blue mommy? why? why?\r\n\r\nAnd please use sentence
    case. It might help people take your questions more seriously. If you don't know
    what sentence case is, ask your teacher!"

  body: Miss Giggles, I too do not think your questions are silly. But, as Patty said,
    it seems you've started multiple threads about the same topic. (That's why I asked
    you, in the other thread, to try and articulate a bit more so perhaps we could
    narrow it down.)
