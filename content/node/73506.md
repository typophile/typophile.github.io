body: "Hello !\r\n\r\nI'm lost because I tried a lot to find these fonts... total
  fail. \r\nWhatTheFont doesn't work and I browsed a lot of fonts on font catalogs
  without success :\\\r\n\r\nThe looking fonts are these ones : \r\nhttp://yfrog.com/jdpourle400emenumerodeprep\r\n\r\nThe
  first is the logo \"Premiere\". I think it is a modified one... ?\r\n\r\nAnd the
  second is the font used for texts like \"James Gray cuisine Chabrol\". It is often
  close to fonts I know, but never the same.\r\n\r\nDo you have any idea ?\r\n\r\nThanks
  a lot for your help.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Pour-le-400eme-numero-de-Premiere-place-aux-coups-de-coeur-des-stars-du-cinema_reference_5540.png]"

    for your help"
