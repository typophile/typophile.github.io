body: "Hi. I'm looking into Plantin for a project, but none of the versions I found
  include small caps or old style figures. Galaxie Copernicus is a good alternative,
  but I'd still like to know if there's anything similar out there I might've overlooked.
  Suggestions? \r\n\r\nCheers."

    in OT format, unfortunately. \r\n\r\n(I used to use it, including all the expert
