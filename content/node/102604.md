  . The logo needs to be fresh and professional, but most important relevant to this
  online community. I am an italian graphic designer, and that's why I called this
  community \"italian pixels\", because  I want to make people aware that I'm not
  mother tongue as I'm going to create youtube educational videos about design and
  software . Here is the concept I ended up with :\r\n\r\n"

  body: The type used for Pixels is <em>greatly</em> overused. I would also try and
    steer clear of script typefaces in general, because it's a de-facto choice for
    all modern iOS apps and as such it looks like a tacky cliche.

  body: "@cenerino54: I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s accidental, or deliberate and
    meant to be somewhat ironic, but as far as visual rhetoric goes, setting the word
    \u201Cpixels\u201D in a script is about 180\xB0 off the mark. Why did you select
    this typeface?"

  body: "That's a good point, I agree on the fact that is a quite known and used type
    nowadays. However, in this case I opted for a brush /script typeface in order
    to create a dynamic contrast between the rigidity of the concept of a squared
    pixel, and not to follow any visual trend. I think I might make the script even
    more custom, do you know some other similar typefaces that might suit the project
    ? \r\n\r\nThank you for your time"

  body: "Devil\u2019s advocate: You want to go for contrast. Have you thought of using
    a script for the word \u201CItalian\u201D and then using something more rigid
    for the word \u201Cpixels?\u201D Seems to be a the logical solution, unless of
    course you actually <em>are</em> going for an ironic juxtaposition of the word
    \u201Cpixels\u201D set in a script.\r\n\r\nQuestion: Did you intend setting the
    word \u201Cpixels\u201D in a script to be an ironic juxtaposition?"
