body: "\"Font embedding\" is coming back to the web! The latest build of WebKit (used
  by Safari) has it, Opera is expected to follow. But the way they use it is by just
  linking a regular font file, which has to be placed somewhere on the internet, so
  everyone can download it.\r\nOf course that doesn't go well with commercial fonts.
  \r\n\r\nSo I set up a Proof of Concept to show a way to secure* a font used with
  the font-face command. Just download the <a href=\"http://nightly.webkit.org/builds/overview/feature-branch\">latest
  version</a> of Safari and open this page:\r\nhttp://www.fonts.info/webfonts/\r\n\r\nYou
  should see two \"embedded\" fonts. The first is protected*, the second is not. Feel
  free to try to download Kaffeesatz. I won't explain how the protection works, but
  it uses several layers of protection. It is set up in a way, where the font would
  reside on the foundry's server and a remote, licensed website can use the font by
  adding a little snippet of code to its template. \r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Bild3_4933.jpg]\r\n\r\n*
  So it's absolutely safe? No! Everything you see in your browser window was already
  downloaded to you machine. There is no real protection for anything that is on the
  web. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    protection is not/should not be a TECHNICAL thing. It's a LEGAL thing. I see no

  body: "<cite>Yea, it\u2019s really easy to download the font: visit page in firefox</cite>\r\n\r\n\r\nTrue.
    But it's an easy fix to prevent this in a future version. The point of this script
    is to have a system where a licensed website would get access to the font on the
    foundry's server, but access from other sites and direct downloads would be prevented.
    This can be done. I just don't have all the neccessary features and levels of
    protections in it yet.\r\n\r\n\r\nBut 4thfebruary is also right. Once you access
    a licensed site the font will end up in your browser cache where it can extracted.
    And this will always be the case.\r\nBut still: Should we stop the iTunes music
    store because people know how to rip an DRM-protected song?\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Well, if you know my stance on DRM, it's \"get rid of it completely.\"\r\n\r\nOn
    the web there seems to be a strong urge to try and protect copyright concepts
    via technology...which always adds to the complexity/expense of the product, adds
    to the frustration of the honest customer, and is ultimately little to no deterrent
    to the person that doesn't care about copyright in the first place. ;o)\r\n\r\n"

    or even honest web page viewers. \r\n\r\nThe \"customer,\" it seems to me, would
    be the party putting the font on the server. The people viewing the page on the
    web which utilizes the font, who are not the people who licensed the font, are
    not prevented from seeing the font at all. If the technique required site visitors
    to have an account or type in a password or some other nonsense, I could see your
    point. \r\n\r\nIn any case, what legitimate reason would anyone have to extract
    fonts from a cache (other than to demonstrate that there's a security hole)? "

  body: "</cite>\r\nThanks for this Ralf.\r\n\r\nI also was wondering if you could
    somehow secure a css file that contains information about a font to be safe on
    an EULA's side (e.g. <cite>\"Embedding of the XXX Font-Software into electronic
    documents or internet pages is only permitted in a secured read-only mode. The
    Licensee must ensure that recipients of electronic documents or internet pages
    cannot extract the XXX Font-Software from such documents or use the embedded XXX
    Font-Software for editing purposes or for the creation of new documents.\"</cite>).\r\n\r\nCan
    anyone actually ensure that no one will eventually extract anything from even
    a super-protected file? I don't think so. Why such a statement then?\r\n\r\nBack
    to the topic, your solution seems enough \"protection\" for most users who browse
    websites. As stated many times before, one shouldn't really count in pirates who
    would steal/wouldn't buy anyway. The question is if font vendors see it as an
    enough secure embedding on the internet?\r\n\r\n________\r\n<a href=http://www.lenart.pl>AL</a>
