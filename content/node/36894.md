  However Veer's merch products cannot be shipped outside of North America.\r\n\r\nAnyone
  else feel the same way?\r\n\r\nPlease sign the petition then maybe Veer will do
  something about it;-)"

    you want on the placard :-) "

    a question of resources, but we are working on getting a more substantial marketing

    into Europe efficiently, you\u2019ll have many more lovely bits of paper in your
    mailboxes, I promise.</em>\r\n\r\nDoesn't address Veer-merch, though."

  body: "Having made the decision to ship Typophile gear outside the US (since 40%
    of users are not in the US) I can understand Veer's decision. It is a) very expensive
    and b) hard to automate. When we ship gear it means somebody actually has to wait
    in line at a Post Office to fill out a customs claim form. \r\n\r\nSo, ahem, buy
    some <a href=\"http://typophile.bigcartel.com\">Typophile gear</a> and we'll ship
    it to you no matter where you are... just don't be shocked if a $22 shirt costs
    $13+ USD to ship."

    extra, but it's worth it not to have the hassle. You (the shipper) still have
    to do any commercial invoices, export declarations, and certificates of origin,
    though. And don't forget those ITAR and USML forms and statements for the really
