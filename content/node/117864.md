body: I have default oldstyle figures and lining figures in a font. Due to its particular
  constructed nature, the glyphs for 6 and 8 are each identical in both styles. Can
  anyone think of a reason why I shouldn't leave out six.lnum and eight.lnum altogether,
  and omit their substitutions from the feature?

  body: The 6 does not look like the 8. Ha ha. No, six looks like six.lnum, and eight
    looks like eight.lnum, and I don't think that's outrageous.

  body: Just make components, instead of omitting them. It is always nice to have
    a clean logical structure in the font file.

  body: "With the caveat that I think Frode is right, no. You write the lnum and onum
    GSUB code. As long as everything is in the default number style, it should work.
    But why not own a copy of, say, InDesign and MS Word, so you can check such things
    out?\r\n\r\nOdd that an eight (in particular) is the same. Usually the old-style
    8 has to be condensed a bit more than the full-size lining, to fit with the other
    os numbers.\r\n\r\nIn the end though, what is saved? Which is at least one more
    reason Frode nailed it."

    shapes happen to be identical, a single occurrence in the font is enough.\r\n\r\nA
    good question, in my opinion. It is <em>adding</em> redundant info to fonts that
    asks for a damn good reason, not <em>omitting</em> redundant info."
