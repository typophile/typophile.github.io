  body: 'I''d think it would depend on the nature of the photographs. Also something
    to look out for is whether the weight of sans is too light for comfortable reading
    on shiny coated paper, which art books usually are printed on. Also you should
    note that Frutiger had problems with Frutiger Next. [[http://www.neuefrutiger.com/|Neue
    Frutiger]] is the one he did, together with Akira Kobayashi, that has his approval.  '

  body: "Thanks for the photo Nick, I like the idea of using bold. Do you think its
    a good idea if their is not much white space on the page? The photos are actually
    not on the same page as the text, they are at the end of each chapter. The reason
    I mentioned the photos(B&W) was to point out that their is not much text, so using
    a sans serif shouldn't be a problem, even though I think, if given enough leading,
    sans serif is fine for long text even though most typographers(more experienced
    than me) keep telling me that serifs are better for long texts, I just don't see
    it.\r\n\r\nWilliam I will definitely rethink the Frutiger Next, maybe it's worth
    buying the Neue Frutiger or even using Univers. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    his unhappiness particularly with the cursive in Frutiger Next, which he didn''t
    draw. He was against doing it, as he thought it was out of character with the
    roman. After that book was published, Frutiger was able to redo it ''his way''
    with the assistance of Akira Kobayashi, in Neue Frutiger. This not only changed
    the cursive to a sloped roman, but also changed the range of weights, and corrected
    compromises that were done earlier because of the system of fixed units in Linotype
    film.  '

    a bit of stretching etcetera, which helped a lot in copyfitting.\r\n"

    in the book in which Frutiger is tormented by the thought that Frutiger Next might
    ultimately damage his reputation. That's why I'm happy that he was able to do
    Neue Frutiger.\r\n\r\nTo me Optima Nova is a different story. I think Zapf guided
    this, at least the regular width styles, and you can argue under what circumstances
    it might be better or worse than the original. But I agree with Nick when it comes
    to the condensed styles\u2014a travesty.  "

    own name then you should be allowed to make the call on such improvements. Also
    in the case of Frutiger there are myriad other alternatives if you want a cursive
    italic. :-)\r\n"
