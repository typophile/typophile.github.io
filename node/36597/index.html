<div class="post-content e-content" itemprop=articleBody>Hi everyone,
I'm conducting some research for a presentation I will be delivering at work in the near future, and would love some input from anyone who is interested. I am presenting on the topic of "Trends in Web Typography" and would like to know what each of you think about where type has been (early web design), where it is now (web 2.0 and such), and what direction you think it may be headed. The third is almost entirely opinion-based, but the most important and relevant to my presentation, so put your thinking caps on and present your best ideas.
Many thanks in advance to all who reply to this post. If I end up using a quote from one of your replies, I will ensure proper credit to the author is made.
Cheers,
Brian</div>

<div class=commentbody>I wrote <a href=http://www.fontshop.com/fontfeed/archives/the-logos-of-web-20/>a bit about this</a> last year. Since then, there has been a lot of copying of the soft/rounded and large type trends, but I think those are reaching the end of their life cycle now. Can't really say what's next, except that typography is definitely in a better shape on the web now than it was 5 years ago. Web designers, a group formerly obsessed mostly with imagery and effects, now generally regard good typography as an important part of their design process.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Thanks Stephen + Ralf!
I agree with you Stephen in your stating that "web designers now regard good typography as an important part of theeir design process". Its great to see an ever-expanding appreciation for well-designed typefaces, and indeed, good typography in the last few years. Still, the question remains: what is next?
Ralf, I would actually be interested in reviewing trends in both logo/wordmark design on the web, as well as body/HTML copy. I've read over this article by FontShop (Stephen, you should be familiar with this, lol) on "The Logos of Web 2.0" and find it quite excellent, yet still, the question remains: what is next?
Thank you kindly for your thoughts!

Well, I don't see much coming down the pipe in terms of drastic changes.
Font Embedding was an idea that came and went. SVG came, then went, and might come back again, but probably not. We now have Flash (and likely Silverlight, to some extent) when needed for spec'ing specific faces for specific uses. Decent use of CSS is allowing for readable HTML type that isn't absolutely locked into the designer's own view of what it should be and accommodates end-user preferences more and more.

<div class=commentbody>Relevant to the discussion: a couple of days ago one of the leading Web design online magazines, A List Apart, published an article about font embedding on the Web by Håkon Wium Lie titled <a href=http://www.alistapart.com/articles/cssatten><cite>CSS @ Ten: The Next Big Thing</cite></a>. He is the original creator of Cascading Style Sheets and argues that it may now be a good time to resume work on proper font embedding in Web pages.</div>

<div class=commentbody>One guess:
Since Web 2.0 sites become more and more »apps« than just »pages« I would guess there will be Preferences on websites, where you can set up your favourite look and feel for the site, including fonts, sizes, line-spacing and so on.
I don't think that future design trends in the web can be foretold. Mostly there is one successful company, that uses a new look (like Apple's glass/aqua look) and everyone starts to adapt it.
Font Embedding will become interesting again, if we have screens with a significantly higher resolution and hinted TrueType fonts are not necessary anymore. </div>

<div class=card-body>
<div class=commentbody>Typography to me is when something happens beyond the simple horizontal stacking of letters, which is type writing. Leading, tracking, justification, hyphenation, g-g-glyph substitution, hanging punctuation, intelligent weight variation, kerrrrrnnnning or even font selection — these are the "freedoms" that allowed Gutenberg, e.g. to invent Letterpress 1.0. So, imho web Typography would be a void waiting to be filled if it were ever perceived as such.
The good news, as you may have heard at TypeCon, is that Bill Gates woke up 'n the middle of a night and asked an employee how many MS apps use ligatures...The Bad news, as you may not have heard, is that this question was asked in 2003, at the earliest, and not recently as may have been implied.
"Font Embedding will become interesting again, if we have screens with a significantly higher resolution and hinted TrueType fonts are not necessary anymore."
This is maybe not well stated, or else it is not well thought out? When resolutions rise, they do not do so universally, and even when they do rise part way across the market, does this mean people won't use smaller point sizes? Resolution is rising slowly and expensively on big screens, and small screens where it is more common, are not blessed with much of a space for "typography".
Lastly, I'm pretty sure Font Embedding will become interesting again only when it allows the font specification of web pages to be complete to the user's world, i.e. beyond the current, family, style, color, and size...cage, to the factors important to the existence of typography, like rendering method, screen resolution and browser.
Cheers!

No, it doesn't mean that. There will alway be small resolution devices. I was speaking about the typical use of websites on regular computer screens. Many webdesigners (mostly the ones from a print background) are requesting font embedding, so they could use fonts like Garamond Pro for body copy texts on websites. Obviously that is no good idea with the current resolutions. But as resolutions rise, a website will one day resemble a printed page. And when these screens are standard, hinting won't be necessary any more. </div>

<div class=commentbody>"I would guess there will be Preferences on websites, where you can set up your favourite look and feel for the site, including fonts, sizes, line-spacing and so on."
Many sites do this to some extent with on-screen color and text resizing.
Browsers have supported this feature for many years now, though it's not necessarily used by many folks.
Oh, apparently the next OSX is going to (finally!) be resolution independant. This may lead to some interesting shifts in how we view type on screen.
"But as resolutions rise, a website will one day resemble a printed page."
I don't think so. We have PDFs for that now and they are still (and likely always will be) of limited use on-screen. People have adapted to a very different way of interacting with text within a web browser. Print = designer's preferences. Web = designer's suggestions but end-user's preferences. I think that difference will increase.
I agree that hinting, in theory, will eventually be unnecessary. Anti-aliasing is mainly a hack to accommodate the woefully slow state of resolution increases in display devices.</div>

But why is that? Only because of the resolution! If you look at a letter size PDF on an average screen you have to zoom in to read body copy text. The interactivity of the Web and the quality of printed documents will merge in the future. We will have screens with the resolution of printed documents and we will have electronic papers that will display websites. I have no idea if this will be achieved in 5, 10 or 20 years, but it will come.

No, I'd say because it's still very much a static way to display content and more often than not is geared towards a paginated, portrait-orientated fixed canvas size. Paper is good for that. Screens, not so much.
"We will have screens with the resolution of printed documents"
Oh, the resolution will definitely be there. I'm just saying the concept of a 'static printout on screen' just won't really ever be THAT appealing.

RH "No, it doesn’t mean that. There will alway be small resolution devices. I was speaking about the typical use of websites on regular computer screens. "
You are not understanding me I'm afraid. What I'm saying is that the low end of the resolution spectrum only escapes hinting through bitmaps (or things that only I do), and as resolutions rise, the useful range of point sizes can fall. Today, Websites use the same size for text as for captions, e.g. (or they specify type too small to look good cross platform)... With higher resolution devices, the "typical use of websites" on "regular computer screens" can employ a broader range of readable sizes, and they will. Thus, hints go away, not, unfortunately.

No, probably not. 10pt type is 10pt type. Most folks, regardless of the resolution density of the device aren't going to have much need for < 10pt type. We tend to read most digital output devices at arm's length at best.

<div class=commentbody>Si will definitely be talking about more than Silverlight, particularly the CSS font embedding thing.
Hakon Wie is a little confused/clueless about the IP issues, and needs of designers. The main problem with the W3C proposal is that it is restricted to freeware/shareware fonts:
1) Only a tiny percentage of the world's high quality fonts that are suitable for extensive body text on-screen are also freeware/shareware/open-source. (How many freeware/shareware/open-source typefaces are suited to extensive body text at screen res, and have bold and italic available?)
2) The overwhelming majority of the fonts that professional graphic designers and web designers have and want to use in their work are not shareware/freeware/open-source fonts. Equally importantly, the overwhelming majority of fonts used for corporate identities, which those companies want to maintain online, are not shareware/freeware/open-source.
I last blogged on this over a year ago, btw. http://blogs.adobe.com/typblography/2006/03/fonts_on_the_we.html - but I didn't focus on the W3C thingie. Another issue is that at least from Hakon's posting, it seems to be pushing only TrueType....

Let the kooks at the W3C limit their ideas to OSS/free fonts. It won’t stop the rest of the world from using everything else as well.
Hopefully they can be convinced that OpenType support would make more sense than limiting us to Truetype, tho.

I wouldn't characterize Hakon's ideas as official W3C policy, (although what he proposes is close to what CSS has technically allowed for the past ten years) - currently it's a one man crusade to have the Web rendered in freeware fonts. What could possibly go wrong? ;-) </div>

<div class=commentbody>Do we really believe that the screens will become bigger and solve part of the web typography problem? Maybe a bit of topic but won't screens become smaller rather than bigger? Typography for screens in smaller mobile/pda sizes is likely to play a bigger role in the future. Will we not see a lot of the communication (that today is viewed online on a 20" in your office) viewed online on a 3" on your way around the city?
I think this has to be solved by either lobbying Microsoft to reintroduce their "Core fonts for the Web" program or crossing our fingers that Web 3.0 and tomorrows developers brings a solution to this.
The main problem for both web typography today is an development issue. It is getting information past personal firewalls and back without jeapordizing the users identity/security.</div>

Who said anything about freeware? Why would designers use freeware fonts when they could just resave commercial fonts in TypeTool with a new name? I'm being smug here, but isn't that what everyone is worried about? Sure, if one person was doing it, there would be a lawsuit. If lots and lots and lots of people were doing it, who knows what would happen. A precise definition of what constitutes a new, distinct font would become critical. It might result in more commissioned fonts however. </div>

<div class=commentbody><cite>Do we really believe that the screens will become bigger and solve part of the web typography problem?</cite>
No. Screens will have higher resolutions in terms of pixels-per-inch. The current problem is that a lot of what is displayed on a screen is not resolution independent. So if you switch to a 200 ppi screen, some things will look really small. Text will look sharp, but certain user interface elements with current operating systems will become unusable. Some OS components, like the dock in Mac OS can already be resized. But for the real revolution to occur, <em>everything</em> on screen needs to scale. Making the web-scale is another special case. One could imagine a superpowered browser rendering engine that would say, automatically resize (resample!?) bitmaps as they were being displayed. Images wouldn't look any better, but text would be super-sharp. My prediction on this: if anything like this is ever released, Apple will do it first. Why? Because they have the luxury of breaking backwards compatibility. </div>

Oh, I hadn't thought of that. Is nine point type nine point type then? How about 9.5? is that 9.5 point?

Yep. I think you got it! ;o)
My point, in case you missed it, is that there won't be really any demand for minuscule type just because screen resolutions increase. If the types too small to comfortably read, it's too small...regardless of the PPI settings of the monitor.</div>

<div class=commentbody>10pt type is only 10pt type on <em>paper</em>. On computer screens 10pt type is rarely 10pts in terms of actual measurement. On the web, it's typically (hopefully) only a guideline and users will decide for themselves how large to make the text. Increased screen resolution wouldn't necessarily cause people to use smaller text, but it would affect the choice of font they use.

At the moment. As of the next version of OSX (and I'm sure VISTA to follow if it hasn't already) the OS will become resolution independent--meaning you should be able to spec 10pt and regardless of the PPI of the screen, it will, indeed, always be 10pt.
It hasn't been a big deal up 'til now as most screens pixel densities have been between 72 and, oh...maybe 120 at most. Once we start pushing 200+ then we'll need resolution independent software to get the most out of it.

I predict just the opposite, because resolution independence will result in text being displayed at whatever size the user prefers. For example, if I print a PDF I almost always print it at the default size. If I'm reading a PDF on screen, it's set at whatever resolution is easiest to read. I think the iPhone also illustrates this trend, where a webpage is shrunk to fit the screen. The user then zooms around it to get useful information. </div>

There are two main models, the zoomable without options (pdf, tv, leopard, iphone), and the unzoomable with options (browsers, Windows, Mac 0SX).
"there won’t be really any demand for minuscule type just because screen resolutions increase"
There already is demand for small type at lower resolutions, so I'm curious as to why there would not be at higher resolutions. Scratch-scratch? 9 pt at 144 dpi is STILL ONLY 18 pixels. hint hint....
"you should be able to spec 10pt and regardless of the PPI of the screen, it will, indeed, always be 10pt."
I'll tell you why not. Fonts on screens are integer pixel values that never round to whole point values except when functioning in certain ppi resolutions, e.g. 72 or 144. Get it?
Cheerz!</div>

Who is demanding unreadable type? ;o)
On screen, you're pushing the comfort level of most folks at 9pt. Remember that we don't typically read screens any closer than arms length.
How many annual reports do you set in 5pt type, for instance? Even on print there isn't much need for that size of type. Unless you're a lawyer. ;o)
"I’ll tell you why not. Fonts on screens are integer pixel values that never round to whole point values except when functioning in certain ppi resolutions, e.g. 72 or 144. Get it?"
Points are a unit of print measurement. On screen they're typically mapped to pixels via whatever particular logic the particular display software wants to use to translate it. That can/will change once the OSes goes resolution independent. At that point, the OS will know the PPI density of the screen and be able to map that to whatever real-world print measurements you want to use (inchces, points, etc.)...software willing, of course.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Chris: HTML uses the browser font rasterizer, which usually but not always (Mozilla) falls back to the operating system for rasterization, whether Flash has its own built-in one in several incarnations depending of which version of the Flash player you’re running and how the .swf file was compiled.

Verbosus explained the rendering well. From a technical/usability standpoint, the HTML text is resizable/stylable by the end-user, and (usually) more machine-readable (though one CAN do that with Flash).</div>
