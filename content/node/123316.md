    by Monotype:\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/mti/palace-script/\r\n(which is commercially

  body: "I compared the two fonts and found a few differences, such as the upper swash
    on _R_, but the main difference was that Palace Script connected smoothly, while
    Pollux Script -- at least the old copies of two versions I had on file -- connected
    with a gap.\r\nPalace Script dates from 1923 as a Stephenson Blake/Monotype font.\r\nSimilar
    fonts from that era: Embassy Script (Caslon 1924), Marina, Imperial, Society Script
    (all Stephenson Blake). [Source: Jaspert's Type Encyclopaedia]\r\nDon\r\n\r\n"
