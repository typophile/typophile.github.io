body: "B&P Typefoundry & Sang Bleu are happy to announce the release of the Sang Bleu
  Type Collection. The collection is constituted by 9 fonts (Pro sets), all initially
  developed to act as display typefaces for the last issue of Sang Bleu. Most of the
  fonts are based on the Romain BP, which is Sang Bleu's main body text font. The
  collection also extends to extremes unusual like the Hairline Compressed or the
  Hairline Sans, providing graphic designers very strong stylistic tools. All fonts
  are designed by Ian Party and developed by B&P.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can download
  a free trial version on our website to play with and  test for your futur projects.\r\n\r\nplease

  body: "SangBleu BP is based on the structure of Romain du Roi, like the Romain BP,
    that detail that appears on the \"l\" is on the Romain du Roi as well, it was
    a nice reference to the first modernist typeface. this detail is an alternate,
    the typeface as a \"normal\" \"l\" too. (like the double serif)\r\n\r\nhttp://www.bpfoundry.com/fonts/cut.htm?font=18&cut=52"
