  and was hoping someone could help in my search for knowledge.\r\n\r\nI'm in the
  process of putting together a presentation on [[Friedrich Poppl]] for a university
  class I'm enrolled in.  To give my presentation life, I would like to share examples
  of Poppl's work in a real-world setting.  \r\n\r\nI'm especially intrigued by the
  notion that Poppl's Saladin font inspired an entire generation of neo-gothic fonts.\r\n\r\nSo..
  \  \r\n\r\n1.  Does anyone know where I can find a movie poster site with examples
  of posters utlizing Poppl's \"Saladin\" font?  Any names of movies would also be
  appreciated.  I've surfed through plenty of poster sites tonight without any luck.
  \ My eyes are tired.\r\n\r\n2.  Does anyone know of any solid Saladin inspired fonts
  out there?  In other words, do you know of any fonts that are a direct off-shot
  of Saladin and where they were used?\r\n\r\nThanks in advance for any help you folks
  can offer.  It's been an interesting project so far.  I hope someone out there can
  help add some meat to my research.\r\n\r\nWayne\r\n"

    might track down the author of those articles (I think one of them was his wife
    actually, and I think she's still alive) and ask him.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: Extraordinay font, but how can it be called gothic? I may be seeing things,
    but to me it looks basically inspired by Kufic lettering. Which would also make
    more sense with the name Saladin, wouldn't it?

    \ Perhaps I shouldn't believe everything I read on the internet.  Either that
    or I'm reading my notes wrong.\r\n\r\nWhat a second... here it is... the font
    is advertised as \"Poppl's neo-gothic classic.\"\r\n\r\nThoughts anyone?\r\n\r\n"

  body: I know it's described as neo-gothic now, but I doubt Poppl would have subscribed
    to that (does anyone know if it was ever called gothic before the Canadatype version?).
    Gothic is probably a less nebulous notion in Germany than it might be elsewhere,
    and the original name of the font clearly points in another direction. Not everything
    spiky is gothic, even in architecture, especially when the spikes are on one side.
    JMO, but it might help Wayne decide which way to look for Saladin "offshoots"
    (not that I know any myself).
