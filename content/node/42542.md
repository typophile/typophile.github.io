body: "Is it just me, or is it always easy to tell when finals roll around in the
  design schools? I don't mean to point any fingers, but around the time of finals,
  we get a lot of questions that *seem to be* looking for answers to term papers,
  etc.\r\n\r\nNow, as a student myself, I appreciate the amount of information presented
  here on Typophile, as well as the ability to pose a question to professionals in
  the field. But it seems that aside from James Puckett, myself, and a few other regular
  contributors, that we're the only ones to do a dang Google search before posting
  an inquiry.\r\n\r\nI think it highlights the importance of two aspects of Typophile:\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>The
  Typowiki. It's still fairly weak as a useful compendium of knowledge. I think that
  if we were to regularly update it with relevant information as it is posted, we
  would be able to answer more frequently asked questions by pointing to the Wiki.\r\n\r\nHow
  many times do we have to answer the same questions? What sans goes with this serif?
  Does anyone have any information on the background of xyz serif?\r\n\r\nUsing the
  Wiki more effectively should free up the boards for more topical discussions that
  matter.</li>\r\n\r\n<li>Fixing the Typophile hierarchy. There was a post a while
  back asking for suggestions for improving Typophile. The hierarchy of the layout
  was brought into question, particularly the back water known as \"special interest
  groups.\" \r\n\r\nMost of the questions we receive from students could easily fit
  into the Typographic Education board. Mods could bump them there if they wanted
  to. But why wouldn't you? Because hardly anyone knows it exists. If that one particular
  board were brought forward a bit, I certainly think that it could be put to better
  use.</li></ol>\r\n\r\nAnyway, don't take it all that seriously. It's just a few
  thoughts that I know others have suggested as well. \r\n\r\nComments?"

    not giving notice that it doesn\u2019t work. At this point most people using web
    forums have learned to search for a topic and ask away if something doesn\u2019t
    pop up. \r\n\r\nBut the big problem is just that too many students can\u2019t
    be bothered to just hit the library. Unless more professors hold class in the
    library at the start of a project, and require students to provide detailed citations,
    this is just going to keep getting worse, and wikiality will take over. "

    the be-all and end-all of internet research about type fonts and typography.\r\n\r\nYou're
    right about the library bit though. Students needing to research something, should
    do just that. Research it. \r\n\r\n(\"Do you guys have any information about Times
    New Roman? I can't seem to find anything about it...\" I'm calling b*s* on that.)\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Actually Dan I don't mind the students asking for help as much as I mind
    professionals who are being paid good money to do their work asking what font
    they should use. If the question is pointed and specific, that's fine, but \"I
    am designing a logo for a jewelry company, what font should I choose?\" Isn't
    that the fun and challenging part of the job? \r\n\r\nRegarding students, this
    can and should be one branch of their research, but they should know that a lot
    of the info the smart folks here give out (out of the goodness of their hearts)
    can be found easily on- or off-line if they are at all resourceful. Again it would
    be nice to see students making their questions more focused and thought out. I
    don't like having to come up with dissertation topics for them either. \r\n\r\nBut
    then, it is easy to just ignore those threads."

  body: "Equally valid concerns, no doubt. Pointed and specific is the key. If you're
    a student, or professional, Typophile can very well be the only place to get a
    reasonable answer to a question. \r\n\r\nBut the question itself needs to be reasonable."

  body: "I do think the front page and other structure of the site doesn't emphasize
    a preliminary search quite enough. There are threads that ask that specificially,
    but a FAQ or Typowiki header, parallel with Design and Miscellaneous, might catch
    more repeats. \r\n\r\nAnd then the whole issue might go away if the site's search
    function is fixed. "

  body: "It might be useful to have a big warning, up by the button that allows you
    to post a new topic in the forum -- \"Have you already conducted a search for
    this topic?\", or something to that effect.\r\n\r\nI don't know that questions
    like \"What is the best font for a hair salon?\" or \"What are the top 10 fonts?\"
    are necessarily relegated to students. A lot of professional graphic designers
    don't know very much about type, or even care that much.\r\n\r\nI think one of
    the best things about Typophile is that the top people in the field are willing
    to talk to complete newbies without any condescension. I'm sure we can all admit
    we've posted dumb questions -- I know I have. I think it's good to know that designers
    out there are just trying to find more information about type, although there
    are certainly some questions that seem unforgivable :)"

    is something similar in my job. I deal with highly trained technical people, and
    often they neglect to think about one of the most basic things in their design,
    because it is sort of taken for granted. Then at the end of their process, they
    take a look at that area, and find they have to wait 6-8 weeks for parts, and
    have to scramble for resolution. Thankfully I carved out a living for 30 years
    being the guy who pulls the rabbit out of the hat. But now the Chinese are taking
    all the margin out of that area, and I have to diversify.\r\n\r\nMost of us are
    here because we enjoy the creativity and variety of fonts, but for some, they
    don't keep up on fonts because fonts are taken for granted, and they are focusing
    on something else, like solving the layout.  (But at the end,  Arial or Times
    New Roman doesn't look quite right).\r\n; )"

  body: I do have to admit it seems like there's an inordinate amount of bad designers
    who post here, with their "What font should I use for my logo?" questions. I think
    this is born out of the idea that a logo is just an icon + some type, and finding
    the right font will solve the problem, rather than approaching an identity or
    any other design project as a whole in which every element reflects on the others.

    for the community. I also imagine it\u2019s doing a little to combat piracy, because
    these people aren\u2019t just downloading a few gigs of fonts and scrolling through
    them all to see what looks good. \r\n\r\nAt the same time, I grit my teeth and
    roll my eyes every time someone can\u2019t figure out what to pair with fonts
    by Slimbach or Frutiger."

    If, after thinking things through, you still can't find an answer on your own,
    then by all means ask questions.\r\n\r\nTypophile shouldn't be known as a \"quick-fix\"
    design portal. It shouldn't be known as the \"quick-fix\" design project/term
    paper portal.\r\n\r\nIt should be known as the home of intelligent discussion
    of type and typography, of an older generation passing on its collective wisdom
    and experience on to the younger.\r\n\r\nStudents/beginners obviously fit into
    the continuum, because at one point everyone is/was a beginner.  "
