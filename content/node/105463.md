  this logo, please try to answer the following questions:\r\n\r\nWhat does this logo
  suggest you?\r\nDoes it look similar to another logo you know?\r\nFor what industries

    little, if any, consideration to achieving an overall harmonious effect. \r\n\r\nI
    don't think it is suitable for any purpose other than improving your skill."

    on a site where it will be seen by a more varied community of graphic designers.
    The Typophile site is used primarily by designers who focus on type, and since
    this logo contains no type at all, our opinions may not be all that helpful to
    you.\r\n\r\nFor what it's worth, here's my opinion: I see a flame, but the flame
    is blue, so it's natural gas. Or education."

  body: "Actually it reminded me of the Methodist Church logo (without the cross).
    \ But probably no one else would think that, they'd think something to do with
    energy or flames. But the symbol needs to be much bolder, it's being overwhelmed
    by the large blue circle behind it.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/church-logo_4457.jpg]\r\n\r\n"

  body: 'Being from Europe, your logo does not bring any immediate association. Please
    consider what happens when you greyscale it (photocopy): It appears flat and very
    much different than the original. IMHO, logos that does not retain their generic
    appearance after a common operation as the (B/W) photocopy defies its purpose.'

    operation as the (B/W) photocopy  defies its purpose.\r\n\r\nA friend of mine
    printed her business letterhead with just an embossed logo. Looked great, but
    then she realized the logo disappeared when photocopied or faxed!\r\n\r\nBut in
    general I think that how a logo looks in photocopies and faxes is less important
    that it used to be, with many companies using email, the web, etc for most of
    their communications. That's one reason we're now seeing more logos with things
    like color gradients that are obviously meant for full-color reproduction.\r\n\r\nAn
    important exception would be if the company often uses photocopies to reproduce
    business forms, fliers, etc before distributing them; in that case it would be
    very important. \r\n\r\nOne option is to create a special black-and-white version
    of the logo for situations like that.\r\n"

    an odd question. The question should be \"is this logo suitable for the client
    I made it for?\"\r\n\r\nThat's really all that matters. "

    a logo matches the spec or not. If you designed something to reflect \"eco\" and
    it looks like a \"toxic dump\" to uninitiated public then that's a good red flag
    :)"

    in the US, the Unitarian Universalist Association uses a chalice and flame as
    its logo (usually blue), though many American UUs don't describe themselves as
    Christians, insofar as they regard Jesus as a great teacher rather than the incarnation
    of the deity."

    by many religions throughout the world.  \r\n\r\nIt can also be used as a non-religious
    symbol, such as the Olympic torch (which had religious origins in ancient times
    but is secular now), and logos for many flame-related products (barbecues, etc)."
