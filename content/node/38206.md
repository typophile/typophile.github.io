  are some examples of what I mean\r\n\r\nCourier New [img:sites/default/files/old-images/u1EA6a_5346.png]
  \r\n\r\nArial Unicode [img:sites/default/files/old-images/u1EA6b_5332.png] \r\n\r\nGentium

  what I am seeing is 3 different ways of placing the combined marks. When it's a
  question variation on form I actually feel okay deciding what to do but with completely
  distinct approaches being used I am confused. Probably there is a complicated back
  story! In general I am leaning to the Gentium model partly because Verdana also
  uses it and the Palatino model is probably older.\r\n\r\nIn any case if you all
  would comment about this glyph and with regard to these kinds of variations generally
  I would appreciate it!"

    it being a monospaced font, but honestly I have no idea which is right.

  body: "Thanks!\r\n\r\nDelve, do you think that Arial Unicode is a good basis most
    of the time? What about in the case of a Monospaced font? Maybe not something
    that is meant to be typewriter-like but something to code in. And what Serif is
    a good model to look to?\r\n\r\n"

    suspect, there is variance due to\r\ndesign and preference (and error).\r\n\r\nStart
    with the Unicode 5 book itself or download the\r\nindividual charts as (free)
    PDFs from www.unicode.org\r\nif shelf space or cost is an issue. That particular
    glyph:\r\nAcircumflexgrave (1EA6) is in the \"Latin Extended\r\nAdditional\" Range
    1E00-1EFF.\r\n\r\nThen (as it appears you've already done) a survey of\r\nother
    fonts for any glyphs in question to see how\r\nthey have been composed before.
    The more recent\r\n(available) examples such as Vista fonts and OS X\r\nfonts
    are likely to reflect recent additions/corrections.\r\n\r\nHope this helps.\r\n\r\nD"

  body: "Eben, part is preference.  If you open up the typography options in TextEdit
    for Lucida Grande, for instane, there is an option for the Vietnamese double accents
    to place them either to the left, right, or centered on top of the primary mark.
    \ As far as I know other than Vietnamese double accents are stacked, at least
    in IPA are Danish (the ring+acute) it is like this.\r\n\r\nSo I suppose optimally
    you can support all three :)\r\n\r\n<em>\xABEl futuro es una l\xEDnea tan fina

  body: "You'll find significant differences of opinion on this, but the grave-on-left
    seems to have won out. One note on your examples- both the Palatino Linotype and
    Gentium ones are cut off at the top, caused by the mess that is line spacing on
    some platforms. The correct images look like this (including both versions of
    Gentium):\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/PalL_3911.png] [img:sites/default/files/old-images/Gen_3434.png]\r\n\r\nKeep
    in mind that there are languages (typically tonal ones) for which the Vietnamese
    positioning of the circumflex/grave is not appropriate. They need something like
    this:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/GenNV_6234.png]\r\n\r\nIdeally,
    this is controlled by an OpenType or Graphite feature that will do the correct
    rendering based upon the language tags of the current text. Most applications
    can't handle this yet, though. Until then you can have separate font versions,
    or make the alternate a manual feature (as we have done in some fonts).\r\n\r\nVictor"
