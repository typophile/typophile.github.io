    or something!

  body: Hmm now that it has been explained, I still don't care for it! Unless you
    have been in a car accident, you won't be tilting your head 90 degrees. And the
    green seems random. Oh well! I kinda see what they were going for now. Thanks!

    that letterspacing doesn't help.  Especially because it *is* kind of a kewl logo....\r\n\r\nWhatever
    works, Andre!  ;-)\r\n\r\nL.\r\n\r\n"

    to the right works -- reminds me of an oscilloscope tuning in different frequencies.
    \ The green bits come into play where the various frequency patterns overlap.\r\n\r\nReally
    subtle, actually."

    a monster space around, and the type was pushed over to make the room.\r\n\r\nGeez...."

  body: At a guess, and trying to offer something positive, the company may have brand
    values that are best represented by a water visual...flexible, adaptable, forward
    thinking, etc. That said, I think there's potential for some aesthetic refinement.

  body: "Wikipedia notes the origin of the coporation's name as \"is the Latin form
    of the German name Wachau. When Moravian settlers arrived in Bethabara, North
    Carolina in 1753, they gave this name to the land they acquired, because it resembled
    a valley along the Danube River called Die Wachau. The area formerly known as
    Wachovia now makes up most of Forsyth County and the largest city is now Winston-Salem.\"
    \r\n\r\nSeems like the logo is pretty literal. Wavy lines = water. Type = old
    18 or 19 century engravers roman. Makes a plain old thud on the page or screen.
    Easily recognized & processed, then just as easily forgotten, I think."

    on every street corner now.\r\n\r\nOn the same topic, has anybody else been blitzed
    by the WaMu campaign? Another marketing misfire, it sounds like babytalk, not
    someone I trust with my money."
