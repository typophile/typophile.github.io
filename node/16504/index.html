		<div class="commentbody">I agree the j seems small in 8. Junk is ther Key Idea - no? Which is why I was wondering about a bigger j. I also thought of another idea. 

What if you had a railroad spike & then bent the end to make a J? A spike is of course slang for the needle so it would be less direct but still connected. And you wouldn't need the needle then either... Also a bent spike is junk in some sense -litterally. Because it's useless - unless you use it as a J in a bit of media...

Anyway. I encourage you to keep playing with it until you get a set of size & spacing relationships that gel for you. 8 Is good as a purely visual design but I think it deemphasizes the key idea so you should keep going.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I agree with everyone that #8 is the strongest design. The only thing bugging me is that the J is set using a serif font while everything else is sans. Is there a particular reason for doing that or is does it appear like that purely because of the distressed effect?

As an aside I also like #6 but it's offputing because the "junk" has slid right off the boundary of the logo. While I do appreciate the metaphor that the junk is being sort of disposed of you do not need to overstate this. Just by setting the text in a grungy distressed type you have established its feel. Try #6 with the "junk" text aligned similarly to #8 and let's see how that looks.

		<div class="commentbody">that's a really provocative design... 

but the name... an acquaintance of mine in ireland has this site:

http://www.mediajunk.com/public/

i remember once searching for it and noticing there are a few "media junkie" and "media junk" sites, so i was confused trying to find his. 

but it's probably ok to have more than one. and you are probably very different types of projects/ideas... i'm sure you had considered this just thought i'd mention it in case you hadn't.</div>

I also like the idea of Junk in the two meanings of an addict and trash. This leave a room for ideas.

By the way, provocative isn't bad is it?

		<div class="commentbody">I like the new stuff too. I think 10 might be stronger but it's a question of preferred association too. 10 reads as 'junk=drugs'. But 11 reads m ore as 'trash' to me. I have no idea if reads that way to you too or which association you want to play with more or why. In any case I agree with Lauri ( antiphrasis ) that the J should be bigger.In a way it's the hook bothe letterally ( it's hook shaped ) and figuratively - because it's first letter in the the odd/interesting word. I think making more of it would jive you a stronger result. And lastly, I don't know that you need to enhance the M in media with the color of the J.  I like having just the J be in color. Making all the spotches & scratches be colored too might be cool.</div>
