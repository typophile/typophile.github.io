    this typeface was design by him?</em>\u2019\r\n\r\nThe letters on the cover (also
    on the back) are mine indeed, but actually Gerrit Noordzij designed (and edited)
    this <em>Lecturis</em> edition on type design by Dutch graphic design students.
    The letters I made as a student were placed on the cover at the original drawing
    size (by hand at that time, of course). The backside of the cover shows a very
    large lower case g (roughly ten inches), also from my hand. The types on right
    page of the last spread show type designs I made as a student too (thirty years
    ago). I \uFB01nished some of these, but I never published them, because I did
    not consider them to be good enough.\r\n\r\nFEB\r\n"

  body: "Frank Blokland thanks!\r\n\r\nIn my (inexperienced) opinion, when I saw the
    cover, what I really consider super super <em>'good enough'</em> was that serifs
    and the contrast in the upper shoulder of the 'f'; these details catch my eyes
    at once. I never saw the back side of the cover, because the it is out of stock
    and sold. But I really love to see that 'g', and of course the whole family: even
    <em>\"not\u2026good enough\"</em>\r\n\r\nAgain: Thanks a lot for answer me. "
