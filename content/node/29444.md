body: "Hi guys,\r\n\r\na new typeface in process... Tex is a modular way to texture
  blackletters and pretends to be a display type. Until now, only have the lowercases,
  no kerns adjustments and  no sure about the \"s\u201D and \u201CK\u201D :-) ...
  \r\n\r\nYour comments are always welcome\r\n\r\nCheers\r\n\r\ne.\r\n"

  body: "I like its character, too. But each letter has a profoundly northeast direction\u2026
    each letter's motion goes toward the upper right corner. I thinnk that you'll
    have to work on this. Text is a straight, horizontal line (in most cases ;-)  ).
    The letters would work together in a line of text better if each letter would
    push the eye forward across the line of text, instead of somewhere on top of where
    the next letter should be. Does this make sense?"

  body: "Paul and Dan, Thaks for the support. \r\n\r\nDan, yes you thought really
    make sense, this movements tends to make the type looks like a litle bit unstable
    in words with more than one letters \"o\", \"e\" and \"c\" and its not quite agree
    with the textura\u2019s stability... \r\n\r\nOtherwise, I do not intend to make
    it totally squared and horizontal... a bit more stability it's will be welcome,
    but not the same as we have in the classical texturas. I think that's little dynamic
    movement could make it more accurate with the modern display proposes. But you
    are totally right Dan! Tanks for the advices. I'll keep it in the process.\r\n\r\nUntil
    there, I made some modifications at the character \"k\" (look at the list above)
    what do you think guys?\r\n\r\nTanks, guys and keep the coments\r\n\r\ne."

  body: Nice. Certainly has potential. Your lowercase "e" bothers me, though. Looking
    at your "c", I think you should continue with a thin stroke...it looks like someone
    snipped a part of your "e" off.

    horizontal bias? It seems that most of the letters could fit snugly together,
    especially with the ligatures.
