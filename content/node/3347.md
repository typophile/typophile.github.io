    which Gill Sans was derived&#41; doesn&#39;t sufer from that lack of distiguishing
    forms in those three characters. Between the 1, I, and l, only the I is rectangular. '

  body: ' All of Gill&#39;s lowercase &#39;p&#39; are delicious, although I tend to
    love his cap Florentine &#39;R&#39;, especially in Perpetua. I agree with Joe
    on the italics as well. It was the &#34;humanizing&#34; of the face that makes
    it so beautiful, in my humble opinion. <BR> <BR>I&#39;m not sure it has been &#39;proved&#39;
    that Gill Sans derived from Johnston&#39;s face. I&#39;m not arguing it didn&#39;t.
    Gill was in on the design of the Johnston face for the first three &#40;or so&#41;
    meetings. Johnston&#39;s face suffers from too much geometry in the wrong places
    and Gill avoided this with the humanist approach. <BR> <BR>I&#39;m not sure I
    entirely agree &#40;or disagree&#41; that the English design the best faces. What
    about the French? I&#39;ve come to appreciate the beautiful eccentricities, and
    I mean that as a compliment, of the lettering styles of the earlier part of the
    20th century. I never did appreciate those faces, such as Choc and Vendome, until
    listening to Gerard Unger&#39;s seminar on French design. By the way, does anyone
    know of where I might find more information on Roger Excoffon? Preferably in English,
    but my brother speaks French. '

    Sans was derived from Johnston&#39;s Underground. <BR> <BR>There&#39;s a small
    chapter on Excoffon in _Twentieth Century Type Designers_ by Sebastian Carter.
    You want more than that? I&#39;d like to know more too. Cassandre and Excoffon;

  body: I have to admit I&#39;ve always had a hard time with gill sans. I&#39;ve always
    thought it a bit globular. The uc B, for example--what a wierd proportion. High
    five to Gill for doing a humanized sans serif, though. In some ways, the wacky
    inconsistencies, odd proportions, and irrational variations in line weight &#40;what&#39;s
    with the diagonal of the lc s?&#41; give it character and readability. <BR> <BR><IMG

  body: Interesting rebuttal... you raise some good points. I have to say that Gill
    Sans, run in all caps is probably the worst instance of what you&#39;re talking
    about. &#40;In other words, if you want that monumental feeling you can only get
    from all caps, perhaps you should choose a different face&#41;. <BR> <BR>But I
    will forever regard the Gill Sans italics as pure genius. <BR> <BR>A logotype

    Gill Sans &#40;almost as much as like Gill himself&#41;, since I don&#39;t value
    genericity. <BR> <BR>As for the lightness in the &#34;diagonal&#34; of the lc
    &#34;s&#34;, that&#39;s a feature any real text font has: because of optical -and
    often reproductive- aberrations in small sizes, an &#34;s&#34; with balanced color
    at large sizes will actually look too dark in small sizes. I found this out when
    looking at the wonderful Lexicon specimen book. <BR> <BR>hhp '

  body: I can&#39;t say what Gill was thinking, but I can point out some design issues
    for which that might seem like a reasonable solution. <BR> <BR>When a font weight
    gets that heavy, it is helpful to increase the x-height, allowing heavier horizontal
    strokes in letters with several horizontals such as a and e. <BR> <BR>However,
    once you get a really large x-height, if the i dot is to maintain an appropriate
    relative weight, it ends up above the descender height! Something has to give.
    One solution might be to make the linear part of the i much shorter than the x-height.
    Having tried this, I think at the extremes &#40;Gill Ultra/Kayo&#41;, it looks
    as goofy as the miniaturized dot, because the main part of the i ends up so far
    below the x-height. So it becomes a question of which aspect of the design has
    to &#34;give.&#34; <BR> <BR>My $.02, anyway. <BR> <BR>T

  body: There was a version of Gill Sans made for timetables &#40;Monotype - I think&#41;
    - uppercase and numerals only, monospaced bold and regular, the uppercase was
    used for footnotes and did not have &#34;I&#34; or &#34;O&#34; to avoid any confusion
    - I believe it was only available in 6 or 6.5pt to be used with ordinary Gill
    Sans for destinations etc. btw I didn&#39;t know any English type designers designed
    cars.

    so identifiable. Only thing I have never been crazy on is the inconsistancies
    across the different weights, so I prefer to stick with the roman and italic.
    I am gonna have to aree with hrant also about the lc italic p :). If I am not
    mistaken, Gill only designed one weight? and the digital versions build off of
    his normal weight?\r\n\r\nI added a wiki for [[Eric Gill]] last week, I am sure
    there is mucht hat could be added."
