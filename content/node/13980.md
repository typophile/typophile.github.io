  set with family members of  Adobe Garamond. When printed each card is 3\" x 4.5\"
  \ the whole document is 18\" x 4.5\" and will be folded into an accordian. The flipside
  of each card has a photo of the recipe. To be handed out at retail stores to promote
  sales of Caviar. Thanks."

  body: "Four things immediately leap out to me,\r\n1 Use the fi ligature\r\n2 Why
    is a fraction so much bigger than the whole number\r\n3 Turnover \"for\" in 2nd
    para 1st page and \"on\" in 1st para Caviar Napoleon*\r\n4 Why use an ampersand
    in the Grappa scented salmon and not in seared tuna\r\nOn the whole I would prefer
    that each instruction were given a paragraph to itself to aid the cook who is
    trying to read and prepare at the same time.\r\n*Another approach might be to
    slightly increase the measure to bring words back, with ragged right text it is
    not critical that every page has the same measure and if it improves the rag it
    is worth considering.\r\nI realise that projects like this are driven by time
    and budget and so this might not always be possible but if you get used to picking
    this kind of thing you will be able to produce a better looking job without blowing
    the budget, I find it easier to spot them from a runout rather than on screen
    with the distractions of toolbars, guides etc.\r\nTim"
