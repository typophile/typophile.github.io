body: "Hi,\r\n\r\ni'm hoping to get some suggestions from you. \r\n\r\nContemporary
  Dingbats \u2013\r\nespecially loaded with nice signs (as an addition, different
  weights would be handy) of abstracted mobile phones, phones, email, monitors, websites,
  small computer devices and all those regular stuff we are surrounded by.\r\nMaybe
  this helps you (or me, hehe); think of the style genre of Klavika, FF Max, Etelka,
  Neo Sans/-Tech \u2026\r\n\r\nPure vector \"art\" suggestions (not typefaces) are
  welcome too.\r\n\r\nThanks a lot, t."

    designing them with similar weight and contrast to the text face. The one for
    \"hot beverage\" has given me a hard time due to the level of detail. It's hard
    to get the heavy strokes that I'd like. I'll add more objects if you think it's
    worthwhile."

    Stephen \u2026 but i wondering that there are no more of that kind, i thought
    of \u2013 a lot. Ok, just wondering."

    Netto Icons would sell well as a series.
