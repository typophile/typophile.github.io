    comes to mind.

  body: "Forget about the fifties -- the Coke logo dates from the eighties.\r\nProbably
    just wants something cosy and retro and custom, with lots of alts and swashes.
    Try House Industries or Veer."

  body: Look in the speciment books of Photo-Lettering, Inc. They are filled with
    1950's stuff. Many type designers earned their living by doing hand-lettered headlines.
    When this happend a font was sometimes generated for photo composition and became
    part of the Photo-Lettering library. One of these artists worked for me in my
    font department. He did the Buxom font for me while receiving royalties from Photo-Lettering.
