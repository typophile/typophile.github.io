  stumbled across a font in development on either this site or a different typography
  forum using this style as well, but I can't find it anywhere. If you know what I'm
  talking about a link would be cool, but since I have no other details, that's not
  the point of this post.\r\n\r\nWhat style of lettering is this? The super-elongated,
  overly ornamented letterforms that intertwine with each other are so beautiful.
  I would love to learn more about it but have no information - anything would be
  appreciated.\r\n\r\nThanks!"
