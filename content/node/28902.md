    it's not tilted, but thanks to those \"faux serifs\" it actually <cite>looks</cite>
    like it's tilting (especially in smaller sizes), and that's a rare attribute I've
    always liked in a hyphen (like in some really old fonts).\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    actually useful thing that can (more like might, eventually) come out of this
    thread is the realization that we don't use the hyphen enough; we're obsessed
    with fusing words - we think we're being efficient and/or modern - but in reality
    we're often reducing readability. Favorite example: readjust.\r\n\r\nAnd once
    we realize that, this thread might then become more relevant!  :-)\r\nBut really,
    in any case, half our story is minding the details.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    just chopped the upper-left and lower-right corners a little so they look rounded
    at large sizes (though you can't tell at text sizes) and stuck actual semiserifs
    on the other two. When it's small it seems to slant. When it's big it just looks
    like it has a funny shape. And it seems a little too heavy now, but I think it
    has charm."

    example I mentioned but didn't depict. The letters obviously have rather limited
    application, but I am enchanted by the asymmetrical hyphen.\r\n\r\nI'm not deadly
    serious with this thread, but my interest in your thoughts is genuine. Here's
    what led to the question: I am considering a wordmark design for a company that
    has a prefix as its entire name. I was thinking of using a crisp sans for the
    letters, but something more lively than a rectangle for the hyphen (which then
    might also serve by itself as a logo). This got me looking through the fonts on
    my computer, and I was surprised to find so few that were interesting. \r\n\r\n@WurdBendur:
    I like it."

    of their shape.\r\nHere's a thought (for OT font developers), and it could also
    be applied to the spacing of punctuation:\r\nHave two identical-glyph hyphen characters,
    but kern them differently.\r\nThat way you can use one for regular combinations,
    and the other for problem combinations such as Y-T, in the case feature perhaps."
