body: 'I&#39;m designing a logotype for a law office here in Tokyo.  <BR> <BR>I envisioned
  a sans-serif that is sturdy but approachable, and decided to take a stab at it myself.  <BR>
  <BR>I&#39;m not an experienced typeface designer, so there are still a lot of rough
  edges to work out, but I was wondering if perhaps some of the more experienced on
  this forum might be able to give me some nitpicky advice.  <BR> <BR>For reference,
  I started by making modifications to DIN Neuzeit Grotesk Light, though it&#39;s
  pretty far removed by now. <BR> <BR>As an alternative, if there are very similar
  faces in existance that don&#39;t cost a fortune, I&#39;m open to the idea of buying
  something instead, although I&#39;d like to persevere with what I got if at all
  possible &#40;both as a challenge to myself and to avoid cutting into my budget&#41;.
  <BR> <BR>Thanks in advance for your guidance.  <BR> <BR> <img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/48105.gif"

  body: Chris, could you give some background about the law firm. I feel the direction
    you have taken would work for a walkman product, or a car name. In the United
    States, firms are usually a family name and are treated very conseratively.  <BR>
    <BR>As for what you have created so far, you have to make up your mind on the
    ends of the characters. The S is soft, so is the e but the i and n is very sharp
    and crisp and the a is inbetween. Just some thoughts

  body: 'Thank you both for your comments.  <BR> <BR>The law firm&#39;s name is a
    inversion of the name of the neighborhood where their office sits. The neighborhood
    is known for trendy, expensive clothing, cafes and hair salons, as well as some
    stylish, high-end residential areas.  <BR> <BR>Their actual building&#39;s architecture
    is also a bit unique, greys and blacks with primary color accents, circle motifs
    and strong 45 degree angles. Not sure the period but looks 80&#39;s to me.  <BR>
    <BR>The firm itself is actually more of a loose partnership. Each lawyer has their
    own professional philosophy and work fairly independently.  <BR> <BR>The logo
    is not a project itself, but an accomodation I&#39;m working into a website project,
    since the firm has no typographic identity to speak of.  <BR> <BR>The client wants  something
    that separates them from the ambulance chasers. They don&#39;t seem interested
    in using the site to grow business, but simply to attract respectable clients,
    and dissuade &#34;problem&#34; clients. They also want something &#34;cool&#34;
    but approachable.  Tall order huh? <BR> <BR>The English letters will be grouped
    with a complementary Japanese face that spells out the full name of the firm.  <BR>
    <BR>I&#39;m including an update though it doesn&#39;t yet integrate Christos&#39;s
    great suggestions which I plan to give a try.  I also included sample photography
    for aesthetic reference. The client was quite happy with the photos. <BR> <BR>

  body: Also, you may notice that I thinned out all the characters, most dramatically
    the S, which was much heavier than the lowercase characters in the original DIN.
    <BR> <BR>I&#39;m not sure if there is any sort of &#34;rule&#34; in this regard,
    but is there any particular reason why the cap was so much heavier?  <BR> <BR>Was
    it a mistake to give the stroke widths a more equal appearance?

  body: Nice work, clients would find this friendly-their counterparts &#40;perhaps
    people being sued&#41; would not find it intimidating enough, perhaps adding spikes
    or dripping blood. You could always sell this later to a heavy metal band if they
    don&#39;t go for it.  <BR>But seriously...the &#34;a&#34; bugs me a bit, as it
    does not perfectly match rest of characters. S is too tall in logo as it will
    cause problems with regards to userbility. too much negative space around it vs.
    other characters. Maybe this is just me but compare it to for instance Microsoft&#39;s
    logo. Volume of caps and lc. should not be as extreme as shown here. If you had
    access to the 3page branding / style guide Microsoft uses it would all make more
    sense, so forgive me if this sounds too vague an arguement.  <BR>I would also
    suggest top of &#34;i&#34;&#39;s stem is a hair shorter, or as example I quickly
    created to show suggested mods- make the surrounding characters That contain curves
    on the horizontal&#41; a hair taller. I should comment that I think you styling
    is very contemporary and clean. <BR>Curious. Why go with sans vs. &#40;more traditional&#41;
    serif? <BR> <img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/48306.jpg" alt="lawfirm

  body: Wow, thanks for the thorough comments, they are very helpful! <BR> <BR>I chose
    a sans partially because this will be accompanied by Japanese text of the full
    company name. Those characters are quite complex, so I thought a serif might be
    too noisey.  <BR> <BR>Also, as shown above, the photographic style is not your
    traditional studio headshot, I thought a serif might look poorly matched next
    to the fairly contemporary photographic style.

  body: Chris, that photo is hardly a comtemporary style. They have been shooting
    corporate types like that for annual reports since the 60s.  <BR> <BR>That aside,
    you&#39;ve made good progress, though I think it make a better name for a 4 door
    family car.
