  someone else ('Domino') looks pixellated at size 12 -\r\nSee a screenshot <A href=\"http://code2code/img/font_problem.gif\">here</A>.\r\nI
  can see that sizes 18 and 24 are anti-aliased and look decent, \r\nbut size 12 is
  not.\r\nUnder pixellated I mean that some vertical lines are 1 pixel wide, some
  2 px wide, and it looks ugly.\r\n\r\nFirst I thought that perhaps some glyphs have
  a problem,\r\nso I used FontCreator and TypeTool2 to paste a suspect glyph 'h' into
  a known good font file (Lucida). \r\n\r\nIt seemed to work, I saved it as a new
  font file ('DominoNew') where the 'h' has my shape and is not pixellated like into
  the source TTF file.\r\n\r\nHowever, when I copy another letter ('i') from Domino,
  it suddenly looks pixellated DominoNew, whereas Domino's i was not!\r\n\r\nMy question
  is: does this problem (pixellated font) have a name?\r\nUnder what words can I search
  for problem on google?\r\nHow can I check if a raster image for a certain size is
  embedded within a TTF file?\r\nDoes anyone know how to edit the TTF file to fix
  it?\r\nThanks,\r\nGeorge UK\r\n\r\n\r\n"
