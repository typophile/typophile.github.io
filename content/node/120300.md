    Ryuk, I can't decide if Bambi is based on Bembo (the name 'Bambi' is rather suspicious
    off course) but I see a lot of differences (/E serifs, /O contrast, Curved top/bottom
    on /M/H ) so I decided to not remove the link to Bambi because it's actually a
    better match to the sample.\r\n"

  body: "No problem for me, Fivos :) Regarding differences between Bembo and Bambi,
    you're right the ones you mentioned are present. \r\n\r\nEDIT: got a closer clone
    for Bambi than Bembo, it's [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/ef-typeshop/bernstein|Bernstein
    TS]]/[[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/softmaker/bamberg-serial|Bamberg Serial]]
    Extra Bold but by TypeShop/SoftMaker and Bamberg is even tagged as 'Bembo'...
    Not sure this Bambi is so legitimate... Lowercases are also pretty close to Bembo
    with some minor differences.\r\n\r\nEDIT2: just found another clone of Bernstein/Bamberg/Bambi
    called 'Heather'. Don't know what to think about the whole thing. Bernstein design
    date is 2006 and Dafont states Bambi is 'before 2005'. It's a complete mess..."

  body: "My version of \"Bambi\" states in (c): \" Copyright  1995. Gerard E. Bernor.
    \"\r\n\"Bernstein-Serial-Heavy\" states: \"(c) 1996 SoftMaker Software GmbH\"\r\n\r\nNote
    also  that the fact SoftMaker sell their fonts at MyFonts.com does not make them
    more legitimate than others, as it is actually the ancestor of Brendel Informatik
    GmbH, a well known font-forgery company.\r\n\r\nMy assumption is that MyFonts.com
    cannot resist the opportunity to make some extra money from SoftMaker's collection
    and \"legitimized\" them by selecting about 1000 fonts of their 10s of thousands
    forged fonts they had in their collection. They actually selected the ones that
    are not \"exact clones\" (like Bamberg above) plus some original digitizations.\r\n\r\nMy
    whole experience (by trying to exclude clones from Find my Font database) leads
    to the same result, expressed many times here in Typophile: The type publishing
    & distribution industry is a total mess!\r\nAll big companies out there, have
    - at some degree or another - cloned & sell somebody else fonts without permission
    and without respecting the designer rights!\r\n"

  body: "Softmaker, to me, is almost worse than Southern Software was. They currently
    offer two CD's full of ripoffs. One has 9,999 fonts, the other over 12,000. They
    even offer a PDF on the promotional site that shows each font and blatantly lists
    which commercial font is copied (ITC Benguiat, Algerian (Letraset), etc. I've
    complained about this to MyFonts before (it's kind of backstabbing their other
    large foundries, no?). I'd have to agree with your assessment of why MyFonts would
    look the other way, Fivos.\r\n\r\nGerard Bernor was one of that pack making some
    early digital fonts that copied other fonts which didn't exist digitally yet elsewhere
    - so he was working from scratch. Back then, the fact that they weren't available
    digitally gave these new fonts some degree of legitimacy. Today, not so much."
