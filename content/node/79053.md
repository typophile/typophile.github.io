  Release: GT Walsheim</strong>\r\n\r\nIn its heart <a href=\"http://www.grillitype.com/typefaces/walsheim\"
  target=\"_blank\">GT Walsheim</a> is a geometric grotesk, but it also has a certain
  handmade roughness engrained in its design. Based on custom typography by Otto Baumberger
  for multiple lithography posters from the early 20th century, Walsheim is suitable
  both for display and for text use.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://www.grillitype.com/wp-content/themes/grillitype/images/typophile/gt-walsheim-posters.gif\"

  />\r\n\r\nBaumberger was one of the great early Swiss poster designers. Baumberger
  stated that he never really had an education in typography. He invented his own
  typefaces as he needed them while designing his posters. At first the type used
  on the posters seem to be random experiments, but once you take a closer look, you
  realize that they share certain design aspects which occur throughout most of his
  work. Especially the peculiar uppercase G with its very unique design is interesting.
  Many posters by Otto Baumberger show type with the same G and very similar overall
  characteristics.\r\n\r\nUltra Light\r\n<img src=\"http://www.grillitype.com/wp-content/themes/grillitype/images/typophile/walsheim-ultra-light.gif\"
