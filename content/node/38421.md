  body: "I love the magazine covers you uploaded. \r\n\r\nThere's a Japanese bookstore
    in downtown LA I go to that has these magazines. Its funny- there is a Tokyo scene
    fascinated by black american music and culture, a fascination that leads many
    to even put on blackface or a really dark tan and crimped and weaved hair. But
    I guess that's okay- I'm obsessed with Japanese stuff. Kawaii stuff- I love your
    icon BTW.\r\n\r\nMikey :-)"

  body: "Maybe we're just not up on the latest lingo. Maybe \"woofin'\" is meant to
    be ironic like \"brick shithouse\", e.g.:\r\n\r\n<cite>That girl be woofin', homes.<cite>\r\n\r\nOr
    maybe it's a reference to the loyalty of dogs:\r\n\r\n<cite>Why you checkin' out
    my girl, bro? She's woofin' wit' me now.</cite>\r\n\r\nOr maybe it has to do with
    listening to Snoop Doggy Dogg:\r\n\r\n<cite>Q: What are you listening to?\r\nA:
    I'm woofin'.</cite>\r\n\r\nWhich brings me to the concept of speakers - there's
    tweeters and woofers. Maybe \"woofin'\" means \"having a bass-like quality\":\r\n\r\n<cite>That
    beat be woofin', homes.</cite>\r\n\r\n - Lex"

  body: "No, Woofin' is a Japanese Urban magazine. This is the version geared towards
    females so that's why it says Girl. (Like American magazine VIBE and then there
    is a female version of VIBE called VIBE Vixen which isn't any sort of slang, it's
    just the name of a magazine) It features more fashion and makeup, etc. Woofin'
    is not any sort of new slang as the original Woofin' (which is still on sale)
    has been out for years now, and it certainly isn't a reference to \"brick shithouse\"
    or Snoop Dogg. Don't hurt your heads thinking too much into it.\r\n\r\nOn the
    Cawaii image I want to know what the big word \"Cawaii\" is written in. Not anything
    else because I have those in my comouter, but thanks for your help.\r\n\r\nSo
    does anyone know what the big \"Cawaii\" is written in?"
