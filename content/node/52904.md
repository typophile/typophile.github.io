  invitations, but I'm looking for suggestions for type for a wedding certificate.\r\n\r\nSome
  examples are here (these are just examples for the purpose of this post):\r\n\r\n<a

  a couple of constraints: script is to be avoided, and sans type is preferred (although
  serif is ok). Relatively low cost or free type is a plus. \r\n\r\nNote that the
  certificates usually include multiple types, usually one for the body and another
  for the names or initial lettering.\r\n\r\n"

    certificate to have? classical? modern? formal? casual? American? European? feminine?
    masculine? '

  body: "Well, definitely formal. Modern as well, although classical stylistic elements
    aren't all bad. \r\n\r\nI'm looking to create a clean, sort of minimalist design
    that is formal without being too stiff or aloof, if that makes any sense.  \r\n\r\nIdeally,
    the text itself would form the focus of the design, which places a premium on
    the type. \r\n\r\nNot too bold--more restrained or modest, although that could
    vary a bit. \r\n\r\n"

  body: In some of the previous wedding posts, I've liked some of the suggestions
    involving art deco and other types in the style of that era, but a lot of them
    are too "stylized" for a certificate, if that makes any sense.
