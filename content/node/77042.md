body: "At the risk of sounding like a very grumpy person indeed, I've gone on to Typophile
  this morning and found that all ten topics in the Newest section are type ID requests
  (I'm guessing this is probably not the first time that's happened). Is it just me
  or does anyone else get completely hacked off with that? (I have said this before
  but I'm pretty sure that comment also disappeared under the huge weight of type
  ID requests.)\r\n\r\nCan the Type ID's not have a (discretely small) section of
  their own? That way I can ignore them if I want to or not if I don't. I don't like
  the fact that ID's have such a high profile on what is an otherwise extraordinary
  and superb forum and I have a feeling other more noteworthy and interesting comment
  simply drowns in a sea of ID mediocrity.\r\n\r\nDon't get me wrong, I too have asked
  for ID's in the past, I admit. Nevertheless, one can bet that there are far more
  interesting threads that are banished from the front page (like this one is sure
  to be in about five minutes) and never see the light of day because people tend
  not to go looking for stuff that much.\r\n\r\nSorry if I sound like I got up out
  of the wrong side of bed.\r\n\r\n(By the way, the challenge is for this to receive
  comment before it disappears due to homepage shunting by the blight that is ID requests.
  My guess is it probably won't. Handpicked...? I should be so lucky.)"

  body: "May I suggest a comfort tip? I'm not much interested in TypeID threads either,
    but instead of checking Typophile's homepage for updates, I subscribed to a selective
    RSS feed that covers every topic except Type ID (and a few other topics as well).
    This implies using a feed reader to be notified of new threads, but it makes sure
    you won't miss any interesting thread because it's buried under Type IDs. It's
    a bit tricky to set up though, as you have to add the ID of the keywords that
    interest you the feed's URL. Here's mine as an example:\r\nhttp://typophile.com/taxonomy/term/4
    5 6 7 9 19 20 21 22 25 26 27 28 53/0/feed\r\n\r\nI feel like I'm making this sound
    even more complicated than it actually is\u2026 Your suggestion is much more sensible
    :)"

    when the first line of a comment is a link!) I had completely forgotten I'd posted
    that. I felt like it was a dream I had way back when... Sorry for being such a
    chump!\r\n\r\nI have duly amended from General to Bug Reports and Feature Requests.
    \r\n\r\nI promise I'll never mention it again (until next time it really annoys
    me, which won't be long) ;)\r\n\r\nBTW, Stephen, Yves, Florian, Jan and all the
    rest of you ID fiends, I still love you. Do you still love me?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
