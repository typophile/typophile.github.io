  body: Is that the only weight it comes in? Kind of a nonsensical way to promote
    a font that basically has nothing to do with Comic Sans or vice versa. They might
    as well sell it as "the alternative to Papyrus" for all the sense that makes.
    It's a nice Ben & Jerry's sort of display face but I wouldn't try to make someone
    read whole paragraphs of it in 12pt.

  body: "phrostbyte64 and Ricardo: Y'all might not, but as you know that doesn't mean
    it's not done.  My work experience certificate letter thingy that they gave me
    at the last school I worked at was typed entirely in Comic Sans, header, body,
    and all.  I admit it looks a bit odd with a huge formal notary signature, seal,
    and stamp on top of it.\r\n\r\nThis one looks a bit more ... statelier, but that's
    probably because of the serifs."
