  body: The Adobe Creative Suite comes bundled with a number of &#34;classic&#34;
    fonts -- &#34;more than 170 included OpenType fonts&#34;. Caslon, Jenson, Century
    and Garamond are among them. So if you&#39;re in the market for design software
    as well, this might be a good fit. <BR> <BR><a href="http://www.adobe.com/products/creativesuite/type.html"

  body: Seems like Corel has always been a &#34;good deal.&#34; An old version of
    Draw, with hundreds of Bitstream fonts, can be found for next to nothing. &#40;Also
    mentioned in <a href="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/30/25742.html">this
    thread</a> awhile back.&#41;
