  useful.\r\n\r\nA foundation here in Australia which looks at ways in raising funds
  and awareness of the condition Depression are looking to make their foundation more
  offical by having an identity created. \r\n\r\nI was wondering if anyone has had
  any experience in working with or around the condition and could possibly pass on
  any tips? I would even love some ideas on how an ID was approached for a charity.
  Even some experiences in working with charity identities.\r\n\r\nWhen I say identity
  I am talking font family, logo, basic stationery and website in due course.\r\n\r\nI
  have worked with charities and identities before, but never at once so would love
  some insight.\r\n\r\nHaving seen how useful Typophile is on matters which hardly
  concern me, I am sure this will be an extremely interesting and helpful experience.\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\nMatt\r\n\r\n"
