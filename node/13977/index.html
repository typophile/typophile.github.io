TDC/DTC is copied exactly. If they had independently thought of the idea of arranging those letters that way, there would be differences, even if they chose the same face. Every little irregularity is duplicated.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Plagiarism is not copying exactly it involves taking somebody else's work or idea and passing it off as one's own. 
And if you look at the DTC logo it does have differences from the TDC logo background pattern, slightly less well drawn serifs, broader stroke – obviously taken from the TDC logo but because it has been redrawn badly it is different. The pair that I linked to are currently the subjects of an <a href="http://www.brugesgroup.com/mediacentre/releases.live?article=9075">argument</a> between the two groups , of course it doesn't help that the two are linked to the opposite sides of the UK political spectrum.
Does Coca-Cola make their product from polar bears? Perhaps they farm them in remote locations, do they employ herders and what are their dogs like? They could market an organic version. The wages for milking polar bears would have to be pretty good.

I have communicated with a principal at I-Ology and do trust him. He tells me that the logo was already in use by The Desert Troon company when their association with the client began. The client is "investigating" the origin of the logo and how it came to be used by them; hopefully we will soon know who presented it to them as their original work.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Perhaps the problem is that the traditional monogram style is such a longstanding tradition in Enlish speaking countries that the odds of seeing such similarities is not far fetched. Using the monogram for TDC makes sense because it speaks to a typographic tradition.  The "Desert Troon" however makes much less connection and does not seem to be a good fit.  I have no idea if the similarity is intentional, I only say that to me it suits TDC far, far better and that "DTC" would be far better served using something different.

		<div class="commentbody">Here's some more info on the LogoWorks issue:

Just wanted to pass on some information about the "logo design" company LogoWorks. The firm has been getting a lot of major glowing press lately:

Wall Street Journal
http://tinyurl.com/9o4w5

Entrepreneur Magazine
http://www.entrepreneur.com/logocontest/0,7353,,00.html

Over the past few days more and more people have discovered that numerous LogoWorks designs have actually been blatantly ripped off from other designers.  You may want to take a look at some of the discussion and evidence at some of these links:

The Origins of Brands Blog - written in praise of LogoWorks.  
The comments offer a great deal of info:

I'm sure this will get more interesting as the week continues. Personally, I feel such "logo mills" do a huge disservice to the graphic design industry.  The outright stealing of the work of other designers is another issue and its blatancy is incredible to me - and should outrage all designers and the clients being taken for what initially may be an inexpensive ride to get a new logo.  How many stolen designs have been repackaged and sold to unexpecting clients by LogoWorks?
