body: "Hey Everyone,\r\n\r\nMy first post here, so Hi!\r\n\r\nI found this typeface
  in a magazine this month -- and think it is absolutely gorgeous. I think it may
  be custom - but worth a post here anyway. If anyone could help me in identifying
  this (if it is custom, just the maker's name would be fantastic) I would be so grateful!\r\n\r\nGood
  luck -- I look forward to what everyone has to say!\r\n\r\nMany Thanks in Advance,\r\nOliver

    one of the things I liked most about this face!"

      ''r'' are definitely different - it is still really nice! '

  body: If it's the base of the lc 'b' that you like most maybe take a look at <a
