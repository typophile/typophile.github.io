  body: "Go to Mac Help and do a search for \"font.\" The results should walk you
    through how to install any fonts you've downloaded. Then, when you find yourself
    with a pile of them, you can venture into the frightening world of font management.\r\n\r\nBut
    for now, hit the help files and you should be good to go."
