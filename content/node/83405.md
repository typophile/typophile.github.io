    find most of these letters in the Red Rooster <a href=\"http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/redrooster/xctasy-sans-rr/?refby=bowfin\">Xctasy
    Sans</a> family. The lower case letters may have been enlarged to make the M and
    N. A font like Plaza might also have been used for certain letters. Just be open
    to the mixing of fonts -- I think it happens.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: From what I can tell after a search on Abe, this book came out in the mid-1970s
    so this could be either custom lettering or a typeface that has not been digitised.

    font that I selected above is based on a typeface called Design Fineline from
    the 60's, according to their description.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: "Thanks, both of you! \r\n\r\nI found this sample as a print somewhere (in
    the letraset age) when looking for a typeface for wedding invitations and recently
    came across it again in storage. \r\n\r\nXctasy Sans certainly has many of the
    same character shapes and it's interesting to see what they decided for upper
    & lower case. It would be interesting to find Design Fineline somewhere too.\r\n\r\nI've
    already started digitizing this, making up the characters not shown. Xctasy gives
    me a character map as reference. I didn't want to start working on a typeface
    that already existed somewhere. I'll be posting for critique! "
