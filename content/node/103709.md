body: "I'll be short: Cern & Cern Display are my choice. I may buy Vaud & Vaud Display
  as well. Price: The entire Cern family (40 weights) is available for $49 for a limited
  time. (same price for 40 weights of Vaud family). I intend to buy them instead of
  Helvetica Neue (just need something helvetica-ish, neutral, familiar, relatively
  modern looking, a bit unusual, rare etc. for personal use and some occasional website
  design). \r\n\r\nLinks:\r\nCern:\r\nhttps://creativemarket.com/ianlynam/6742-Cern-Cern-Display\r\n\r\nVaud:\r\nhttps://creativemarket.com/ianlynam/6728-Vaud-Vaud-Display?utm_source=cmembed&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=6728\r\nor
  here:  http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/wordshape/vaud/\r\n\r\nI thing they're excellent
  value for money. Any thoughts?"

  body: Yes, I think they do seem to represent a great value relative to their pricing.
    The spacing looks very good.

  body: "If you are looking at a Helvetica Neue replacement, have a look at Substance
    as well. It has more functions, better weight coverage, smallcaps... And is cheaper,
    seeing as the Disply weights in Vaud and Cern are almost the same as the regulars.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/facetype/substance/\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Careful: I purchased Vaud and there wasn't any kerning \u2013 quite unfortunate.
    Cern seems to have it, though, at least judging from the previews on MyFonts.\r\nSubstance
    is great \u2013 definitely a nice alternative to Helvetica Neue."
