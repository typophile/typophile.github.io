    here:\r\nhttp://forums.adobe.com/message/2881861#2881861\r\n\r\nDeep into this
    thread someone posted scripts to export and import shortcuts.\r\n\r\nBTW The Adobe
    InDesign Forum is better suited for questions like yours\u2026\r\n\r\nEdit: It
    seems that the later ID-versions are more consistent in the way they react to
    migrating shortcuts and the advice against is moot\u2026"
