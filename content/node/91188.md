body: "It has been said several times on other threads on this forum, but good quality
  fonts seem to be very expensive to the newcomer / rank amateur (a category to which
  I firmly belong). I am looking to purchase at least three, possibly four decent
  fonts to use to produce my documents with (technical reports for UK planning matters,
  ranging from 10 -1,000 pages).\r\n\r\nThus far I am liking the look of <strong>Brioni
  text</strong> from <cite>Typotheque</cite> which (after much googling) I learned
  was one of the primary fonts for the Financial Times Weekend magazine; in keeping
  with the FT theme I am also considering <strong>Fedra Sans</strong> from the same
  company. \r\n\r\nFrom <cite>Hoefler & Frere-Jones</cite> I am torn between the <strong>Hoefler
  Text</strong> and the seemingly more recent <strong>Mercury Text</strong>. Both
  appear to offer all sorts of 'weights' - something I first encountered when reading
  'Typography Lawyers'. That said, the <strong>Equity</strong> font by Mr Butterick
  also seems really good, except it doesn't do 'old-style' numbers (yet), but at only
  $120 you do get a lot of font for your money.\r\n\r\nRather than trawl the web looking
  for lots of free fonts I would like something with a lot of characters ('glyphs'?)
  that has been well designed and I can use for documents that have a technical /
  professional content. \r\n\r\nAre these choices wide of the mark? How did others
  get started when it came to selecting their first font-for-cash?"

    is what you are willing to pay for it. If you choose a typeface based on the fact
    that a prestigious magazine uses it, you surrender your valuation for someone
    else's. And, finally, your choice of a typeface isn't going to make your prose
    any more credible or erudite; it can only render it more\u2014or less\u2014readable."

  body: "What an enviable dilemma! You'll get a number of\r\ngood pointers from professional
    users of fonts I'm\r\nsure; here are some opinions from a maker:\r\n\r\nBrioni:\r\nhttp://typographica.org/typeface-reviews/brioni/\r\nIt's
    nicely contemporary without being mannered.\r\nBe aware that its generous x-height
    makes it more\r\nsuitable for small point sizes.\r\n\r\nFedra is idiosyncratic,
    but I believe highly readable.\r\nIt also has the wonderful feature of multiple
    extender\r\nlengths, which allows the accommodation of various\r\npoint sizes
    of text.\r\n\r\nHoefler Text comes with Macs. Because it's very nice.\r\nBut that
    also means it might be too common to pay\r\ngood money for. Mercury is a Fleischmann
    revival,\r\nwhich means it's naturally highly readable, and a\r\nsolid choice
    in many other ways.\r\n\r\nEquity is a nice if conservative design, and its low\r\nprice
    might make it worthwhile, although it can't\r\nbe too versatile; you could still
    use it to add some\r\ndivergence from the other workhorses you'll buy.\r\n\r\nWhatever
    you choose, it does sounds like you will\r\nneed a wide choice of numeral styles:
    proportional\r\n& fixed-width combined with lining & \"old-style\" at\r\nthe very
    least.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "An enviable predicament indeed. Brioni text, Fedra and Fedra sans would all
    make great choices. \r\n\r\nI'll add a couple more to your list: you might like
    some of the faces that Hoftype produce, particularly Cala: http://www.hoftype.com/node/37
    (serif) & Impara: http://www.hoftype.com/impara (sans-serif), both of which would
    work well together I think. As a little added bonus, they offer the light weights
    of both for free at myfonts so you can try them out to see how they look.\r\n"

    that <strong>oldnick</strong> was living up to his moniker there with some cod

  body: Much appreciated <strong>hrant</strong>. Guidance from someone who has 'been
    there, done that' is always welcome. I am also looking at those fonts that <strong>penn</strong>
    mentioned too, but it took a fair bit of research to narrow down my choices to
    the four that I mentioned in my original post. I am trying not to be closed to
    new ideas given the relatively dry subject matter I deal with.

    esp. at Milo Serif, More, Page Serif, Tisa, Scala. Have a look at Greta Text from

    with typography or graphic design, so I do not have professional experience in
    that area.\r\n\r\nMaybe something to think about: As TimesNR is everywhere the
    \u201Ctransitional\u201D serif model (the genre of Times) might be seen as the
    most neutral serif model, therefore it might be a good idea to go with Mercury.
    Other than that, I did read here that slabs stand for a certain conservative reliability,
    so Brioni would be a good choice too. In my opinion Hoefler Text as an \u201Cold
    style\u201D serif model is too literary. \r\n\r\nBest. "

    Christopher Burke, seems an appropriate choice for your needs - text settings
    for reports instead of, say, novels or more \"literary\" oriented publications.
    I have read a book set in it (an essay on Tschichold, by Burke himself), set in
    a large format, in two columns, and it worked nicely.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.hiberniatype.com/Celeste/celesteregular.html\r\n\r\nI

  body: "oldnick is quite right. From your posts it seems like you are looking for
    a transitional face, or at least something quite neutral and \u201Cacademic\u201D.
    I tend to consider Fleischmans (Mercury is a contemporary reintepretation, but
    perhaps a bit too polished?) a category of it\u2019s own. Although they were made
    for book printing (I have a beautiful book from 1805 typeset in Fleischman), there\u2019s
    more \u201Csparkle\u201D on the page then with a typical old style face, so it
    might work for your use. I\u2019d like to suggest Kent Lew\u2019s <a href=\"http://fontsinuse.com/norwegian-bible-2011-editions/\">Whitman</a>
    as another option.\r\n\r\nIf you manage to make a shortlist (consider personal
    taste, technical requirements &c), I strongly suggest you get hold of printed
    samples\u2014ideally produced with the same printer as your technical reports\u2014to
    compare them IRL. \r\n\r\nAnother thing: Don\u2019t get sucked in to the gazillion
    weights hysteria! Consider what you <em>really</em> need.\r\n\r\n"
