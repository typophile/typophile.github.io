body: Im bringing an image into InDesign and want to drop the background, Id usually
  delete the background and save the layer on a transparent background and save as
  a .psd. but am afraid a psd is not as good as a tiff for printing &#40;am I wrong?&#41;.
  <BR> <BR>Is there anyway of doing this with tiffs perfectly. clipping paths never
  seem to work as well and alpha channels never look perfect &#40;not as perfect as
  the selection&#41;. <BR> <BR>Thanks for any tip&#39;s

  body: InDesign CS supports psd and ai files directly no need to convert.  <BR>As
    for extracting there is a good article in the new Photoshop Users magazine on
    that subject. I find if you use two tools you can get a good extraction. The extraction
    filter and the history brush. Make your extraction, go to history pallet and set
    it on the step before your extraction. Select the history brush and paint back
    what you need.  <BR>My favorite no-destructive way of handling silos is use a
    layer mask. You have all the control and none of the destructive qualities of
    extraction. This allows you to make changes to the image on the fly as the client
    changes their mind.  <BR>Its another reason to psd placement in InDesign. It links
    to the original file and warns you when the image has been changed and updates
    it.
