  body: "Hi Karsten. Thanks for pointing this out. \r\n\r\nIt's been a while since
    I tried to install it, so I might well have not done those additional steps--or
    they might not have been there in the Wiki; I'm not sure when they were added.
    \r\n\r\nI'll have another go at installation today or tomorrow."

  body: "Thomas Phinney said that the autohinting program was the \"crown jewel\"
    of the Adobe Font Development Kit, and it was a big decision for them to decide
    to release it to other font makers. \r\n\r\nSo I'm pretty sure it's better than
    FontLab's; hopefully I'll find out for myself pretty soon.  "

  body: 'FWIW, back in the mid-90s, a very technically adept designer I knew was working
    for IBM using the Adobe tools and simultaneously evaluating Fontlab 2.5. He said
    Fontlab''s autohinting then was just about on par with Adobe''s -- a remarkable
    achievement of Yuri Yarmola''s. Adobe''s gift of its hinting system reflects the
    importance of FontLab in its workflow today. But beware of Greeks bearing gifts!
    Don''t forget that John Warnock cried when he announced the disclosure of the
    Type 1 format which the industry had essentially forced on him. '

  body: "IMO, the FDK's Autohint is better than FontLab's Autohint. On this thread
    http://www.typophile.com/afdko2 you can find other people's opinion about it.\r\n\r\nThe
    FDK's Autohint tool comes in two flavors,\r\n1) a command-line program, that you
    can run from the Terminal (Mac) or from the Command Prompt (PC)\r\n2) a FontLab
    macro\r\nBoth flavors run independently of each other, but should produce the
    same results, with one exception: the FontLab macro won't generate Flex hints.\r\n\r\nAnother
    thing to keep in mind is that the FDK's Autohint tool won't do miracles. In order
    to do its \"magic\" the tool needs to have the font's Alignment Zones (a.k.a.
    BlueValues, OtherBlues) and Standard Stems setup beforehand.\r\n\r\nThe installation
    instructions are all on the Wiki http://www.typophile.com/wiki/afdko   Please
    read and follow them *carefully*. I have been fine-tuning them based on feedback
    I get from people and eventual troubleshooting I have to do during workshops.
    So they should work for almost everyone."

  body: "The Auto button is a good start, but you should definitely confirm the values
    and do adjustments as necessary.\r\nAFAIK, FontLab looks at the outlines of a
    few key glyphs (e.g. 'o', 'H') to set the Alignment Zones.\r\nBefore pressing
    the Stem's Auto button, you need to first Autohint -- use FontLab's-- a few glyphs
    (e.g. A-Za-z), otherwise you might get bogus values."
