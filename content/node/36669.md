    de l'imprimerie en France</a>\" book from the Imprimerie Nationale 1905, and it's
    one of my favorite treasures. Many samples of all their signature fonts, including
    the \"Garamont\" (Jannon), the Jaugeon, and more. Plus, it has a <em>stunning</em>
    range of samples of their foreign language fonts.\r\n\r\nYou can buy a copy for
    as little as $25 if you don't care about the condition. Well worth it for any
    scholar of fine old printing.\r\n"

    en France</cite> from many vendors: some are listed in the Google Books page linked
    by Raph, although a character encoding problem prevents the links from actually
    working. Apparently <a href=\"http://www.abebooks.com/servlet/SearchResults?sortby=2&sts=t&tn=D%E9buts+de+l%27imprimerie+en+France&x=0&y=0\">Abebooks
    seems to list the widest number of sources</a>, that\u2019s probably where the
    $25 copy Raph was mentioning comes from. Unfortunately I\u2019ll have to restrain
    from buying it now unless I want to go bankrupt.\r\n\r\nAs for the Garamont type:
    it\u2019s a very successful and beautiful design, but I am not quite fond of its
    K, R, and T at the moment, they look somewhat unbalanced. But I\u2019m surely
    missing something, I can\u2019t claim any authority in this critique at all."

    get my attention.\r\n\r\nYou can buy the book at abebooks; try <a href=\"http://www.abebooks.com/servlet/SearchResults?an=christian&sts=t&tn=debuts+de+l%27imprimerie&x=25&y=13\">this
    search</a>.\r\n\r\nI used mostly my <a href=\"http://levien.com/spiro/\">Spiro</a>
    tools to make the Centaur and Zeno digitizations. I've made an interim release,
    but they're still too rough edged to be used by anyone other than their creator.
    I'm reluctant to release any outlines for the Zeno, because I don't want to irritate
    Martino Mardersteig, who I feel has some moral claim to the font. However, my
    digitizations from the Centaur originals (<a href=\"http://www.levien.com/type/myfonts/museum.html\">Museum</a>)
    come with full Spiro plate files and processed images of the letterforms from
    the high-res 2400 dpi scans. I'm not at my main font computer now, but I'll try
    to make png images of both the scan and the screenshot this evening after dinner.\r\n\r\nThe
    reason that my design techniques are so secret has more to do with people not
    paying them much attention than me trying to hide them. People generally seem
    happy with their existing Bezier tools, but I personally can't imagine going back
    to them after tasting the Spiro curves.\r\n"

    and dozens of impressions. Also note how the averaging process removes the halftone

    also been lightened to show more detail, but that's optional.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/zeno_a_raw_3537.png]"

  body: "Bingo!\r\n\r\nWow Raph,\r\n\r\nvery fastly a comment, even if I have to read
    your comments a few times again before getting everything (English problem;-):\r\nI
    AM THE ONE in the world who understands what you mean (at least hope so to understand
    you well) according to bezi\xE9r curves. I am convinced that they change natural
    organic forms into something new and different and NOT DESIRABLE. I design typefaces
    now for more than 15 years and still I can\u2019t rid of my feeling that these
    curves don\u2019t really work with analogic forms. I mean maybe there is a difference
    between an oval and a mathematical ellipse. I often feel forced to introduce more
    and more points into a curve when I wish to make it soft and natural which I know
    in fact weakens every bezi\xE9r design, I think also because the choice that the
    computer has to do, actually setting the points into the rough grid, is too unprecise
    and therefore curves become shaky. And to draw the tangents more to the outside
    from the maximum point distorts the area next to the point. \r\nAND WHY THE HELL
    NOBODY DISCCUSSES THINGS LIKE THAT??\r\nSeems that everyone in the world works
    fine with Bezi\xE9r and look what they have done to the classics as Jenson for
    example!\r\nThey changed even our own way today of seeing forms. It\u2019s my
    believe at least.\r\nAm I totally wrong? Crazy? Foolish?\r\n\r\nI have seen that
    in your types there is something different. I felt it.\r\nTo me they look more
    \u201Cpassive\u201D in its curves which is a great compliment because this means
    you did catch the nature of the forms of the original form without changing them!!
    Maybe I am wrong and didn\u2019t understand you well.\r\nBut if you have something
    different please go out and tell it to the world even if noone seems to hear you!!!\r\n\r\nthanks\r\nStefan\r\n"

    the end those Spiro curves are different to Bezi\xE9r curves? Because you showed
    Bezi\xE9r curves, too, in the (beautiful) designs you made from Zeno. I am confused.
    \r\nI did understand that you made an average image of more than one scan of the
    same letter, right? But then, is there something different in actually translating
    them digitally? Is it in FontLab you did the work?\r\nNext time I will wait before
    answering too quick ;-)\r\nBut still there is some truth in what I say, isn\u2019t
    it? But maybe its only my personal design problem.\r\nAnyhow love your fonts!\r\nAnd
    you are probably right with Mardersteig.\r\nDid you get the originals for the
    scan from him? I am astonished then.\r\nFor what I heard he wasn\u2019t keen on

  body: "Stefan: Spiro curves are indeed different from beziers, they are called Cornu
    curves and they make it easier to get smooth connections. Spiro is also able to
    convert from its own Cornu plate format to beziers, so you can draw glyphs in
    Spiro then import then into your font editor for complete font production. Raph
    made an <a href=\"http://levien.com/spiro/\">initial release of Spiro, 0.01</a>.
    It\u2019s very rough around the edges but gives you a feel for how Cornu curves
    work.\r\n\r\nIn the <a href=\"http://www.typophile.com/node/33531\">Typophile
    thread announcing the first release</a> Raph and others discussed Spiro at length,
    including future plans and how it can be used <em>today</em> to get work done
    (because that\u2019s what Raph uses, actually). \r\n\r\nHope this helps."

    curves in current digital type standards is perhaps the opposite of what a poster
    here noted.\r\n\r\nWhile B\xE9zier curves may act as a passable mathematical substitute
    for a draughtsman's French curve (one very early digital typesetting system, by
    Purdy, used an Archimedian spiral instead), for some typefaces one wants an exact
    mathematical description of the curves in a character. For many Roman alphabets,
    plain old conic sections are what one would like. And there's Melior, a typeface
    by Hermann Zapf which is based on Piet Hein's superellipse."
