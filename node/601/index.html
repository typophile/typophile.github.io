It's not sloppiness, since the Farsi lettering is very well done (assuming the same person did both), and since it really is pretty consistent (only one errant &quot;el&quot; and one errant &quot;y&quot;). <BR> <BR>It's interesting that letters that [normally] fit in the x-height follow the x-height, but those with extenders have their x-heights reduced. Kinda like Fleischmann&hellip; :-) The only exception is &quot;o&quot;, and that might be the influence of the &quot;sekoon&quot;: a small circular floating mark in the Arabic script, used to denote the absense of a [short] vowel. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR></div>

		<div class="commentbody">&gt; 22 of the 28 arabic letters have 4 variants <BR> <BR>And the remaining 6 only have two: they don't join on the left (leading) side no matter where they are in a word. Also: Arabic has no caps. <BR> <BR>David's example #1 probably has linguistic validity, but it might confuse some people: those two are actually different letters. <BR> <BR>And in example #2, the &quot;lone&quot; (more conventionally called &quot;independent&quot;) form of the letter yaa' (the first letter in &quot;yawm&quot;/day) is missing the two lower dots. <BR> <BR>&gt; short vowles are not written <BR> <BR>Yes, that's an important distinction: <i>long</i> vowels are very much written. Also, short vowels are also written out in texts meant for learning to read Arabic, as well as when they're required to clear up a serious ambiguity (rare). <BR> <BR>The feature of Arabic that you can dump part of the script when it's no longer needed* is enviable - although in the West it's usually portrayed as a negative. Another positive feature of Arabic that tends to be distorted into a negative is that it appears &quot;too small&quot; on the body, while in reality it's simple using the Cartesian space differently than Latin, in fact more efficiently in terms of readability (but not legibility). Latin is great for posters. Which makes sense when you consider that its [most relevant] origins are in large public inscriptions. <BR> <BR>* Note that Arabic can do this only because it's a consonantal language - you couldn't apply the exact same system to an Indo-European language. <BR> <BR>&gt; in ISAREL YOU HAVE TO STUDY ENGLISH, ARABIC, FRENCH <BR> <BR>Unless I'm mistaked, you don't really <i>have</i> to study French, and I'd be suprised if Arabic was really required either. In comparison, in Lebanon (where both Arabic and French are official languages), if you're Armenian, you end up with a requirement of 4 languages! That's because when it comes to English, you do practically <i>have</i> to learn it pretty much anywhere!  :-/ <BR> <BR>BTW, I'm pretty sure Chris was talking about <i>my</i> images*, especially since you hadn't been able to show us yours when he made that remark! But it's interesting that Chris seemed too busy feeling offended to realize it was just a misunderstanding. I'm just happy there's no land at stake&hellip; <BR> <BR>* BTW, Chris, I don't think the &quot;non-Farsi&quot; example is nice at all, it's the &quot;non-Urdu&quot; one that I find stellar. <BR> <BR>&ndash; <BR> <BR>&gt; the guiding principle in this banner seems to be that the enclosed counter of the two letters should be visually balanced. <BR> <BR>Interesting observation. <BR> <BR>&ndash; <BR> <BR>&gt; One would assume that if they had studied English, their writing would be better <BR> <BR>But there's no definite point where you either know it or not, it's a continuum. Examples: <BR>1) The people who made Yakout (the first Simplified Arabic typeface*) knew the Arabic script very well, but they still managed to deface it. <BR>2) Calligraphers consider people like me (with lousy handwriting) insufficiently educated in the making of letters. <BR>So it's a question of context. <BR> <BR>* <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/typography/links/news.asp?NID=2930" target="_blank"><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/typography/links/news.asp?NID=2930">http://www.microsoft.com/typography/links/news.asp?NID=2930</a></a> <BR> <BR>hhp <BR></div>

But it's interesting that Chris seemed too busy feeling offended to realize it was just a misunderstanding. I'm just happy there's no land at stake&hellip; &quot; <BR> <BR>How was I supposed to feel?   <BR> <BR>&quot;* BTW, Chris, I don't think the &quot;non-Farsi&quot; example is nice at all, it's the &quot;non-Urdu&quot; one that I find stellar. &quot; <BR> <BR>I realised that later, though the first one does have an inherent beauty, don't you think?</div>
