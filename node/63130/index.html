		<div class="commentbody">That's exactly the problem I ran into. I came up with the same match for the numbers (via WTF of course), but no matches for the script. Since the capitals are what's really distinctive, I separated them out and tried WTF. A few "close", but no good matches.

I've been trying to match this one for almost a year. Coming here was like admitting defeat. This is the first time I've ever asked for font ID help. *shame*

I applaud your effort to ID this on your own and there's no shame in asking for a second option after you've put in an honest days work. Unfortunately, most of the requests for ID aren't of this caliber.

Might I ask where you found this image... it doesn't match the wordmark on their site. http://www.braarudfineart.com/

It may very well be an artist with a nice hand for script but lacking on the numbers so they 'borrowed' them from Shelley.

You could always try emailing the company to ask.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">It's definitely a real typeface. The sample is a scan I made from a small printed version. The source is only 2 inches wide, scanned on a pretty louse-quality scanner at 600 dpi with 4x magnification. I then had to burn some of the thin strokes in photoshop for them to even show up clearly. The bad scan and the burning unfortunately create a bit of an illusion of irregularity which isn't actually there on the original. Wish I had a better scanner.

I was thinking maybe it's a fairly common script face that has seldom-used alternate caps?

Not long ago I had to match another script face which really puzzled me for a while until I realized it was just Bickham, but with the alternate swash caps used for every single occurrence of a capital letter. Maybe this is a case like that?

Someday I'm going to run across this font and smack my forehead at how obvious it should have been.

But the fact that it's stumped everybody here makes me feel a bit better about getting stumped myself!

		<div class="commentbody">I checked Part 1 of the Script Font ID Guide and Jason Walcott's [[http://www.veer.com/products/typedetail.aspx?image=JBT0000035#characters|Opulence]] (which is his version of the old film type Zoom Script) comes closest to the three initials, but not exactly. Also, the lower case 'r' is completely the wrong style.

I agree with Andreas that there are variations that should not be seen if this were truly a font. I think someone did a nice job of borrowing from several existing styles and created something familiar-looking, but unique - and hand-drawn.
