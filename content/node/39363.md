  can lead to more effective design and was wondering whether traditional typographers
  have different feelings towards scientific research than scientists or psychologists
  working in the field of design.\r\n\r\nI would be really grateful for thoughts,
  ideas or references\r\n\r\nFeel free to mail me directly at mail@tanyaholbrook.com\r\n"

    contributing to type design, and we will be better able to confirm or deny your
    thesis.\r\n\r\n(I have seen fonts designed by scientists, and they suck, but I
    don't think that is the point you are aiming at.)"

    have been using knowledge of psychology for years... but again, that might not
    be what you are talking about."

    or psychologists working in the field of design.</em>\r\n\r\nThey may collaborate
    with designers, but that's not the same thing. You might just as well say that
    in such a collaboration, designers would be working in the field of science."

    think that is the point you are aiming at.)\r\n\r\nDo you have any examples?\r\n\r\nHow
    valid do you think Tinker and Paterson's research into legibility for example
    is to typographers and graphic designers?  Many typographers say that typography
    has so many different variables that you can't narrow it down to saying 10/12pt
    Bembo is the most legible and readable typeface, for example through testing in
    a lab?\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    threads, use Google, rather than Typophile's search function.\r\nMicrosoft's Kevin
    Larson (kevlar), a scientist, has contributed to many of them, so you might enter
    his name in the search field."
