You're not interested in functionality. <BR>Maybe he'd be happier as an accountant? <BR> <BR>Sure, simply making fonts for the market, without an appreciation for Shape and/or without an understanding of reading is indeed very boring - it's like being a grocery bag boy (and many of those fonts would indeed look smashing on grocery bags). I personally try to express the power of shapes, but am also very grateful for my innate curiosity of how things work deep down. <BR> <BR>hhp</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I've had the pleasure of working with Dennis on custom type commissions during my ad agency days, and then during my tenure at Phil's Fonts, a distributor of his retail fonts. Dennis *is* a complete freak, but a wonderful, trippy guy with a great and twisted sense of humor&hellip; talk to him on the phone for 5 minutes, and you'll be in another world. His type treatments and logotypes for pubs are inspiring, and works of art in themselves; his layered typefaces are really fun to play with. <BR> <BR>My only complaint about Dennis' work is his aversion to creating characters other than the basic alphanumerics for fonts that are to be sold commercially&hellip; I don't know if he's gotten past that, but it used to drive me nuts&hellip;</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Aversion probably isn't the right word - I don't know if it's conscious or not, or simply the result of being too busy, or getting distracted by another project, etc. Anyone who's done 600 well-drawn typefaces is probably going to take shortcuts to remain so prolific. I know nothing about the character sets in Dennis' Hebrew types - I only have experience with his Latin designs and revivals. <BR> <BR>Commercial types in particular should have a full character set with basic punctuation, currency, etc., whether Latin or non-Latin. This is merely my humble opinion as a typographer, a graphic designer, and as someone who works with type designers in getting fonts prepped for market. It's a bummer to find the perfect typeface for a project, only to discover that it's missing the question mark or &quot;curly quotes.&quot;</div>
