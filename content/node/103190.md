body: "Hello everyone.  I'm having problems generating a TTF file with Fontographer
  5.2 (win8).  The system's file preview shows the gliphs distorted and the uploaded
  font to dafont.com seems deformed. This doesn't happen when I generate a OTF. You
  can see what I mean in the next images.\r\n\r\nDoes anyone know whats going on?\r\n\r\nThanks
  in advance!\r\n\r\nOTF\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/otf_5617.png]\r\n\r\nTTF\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/ttf_4686.png]\r\n\r\ndafont.com

    autohinting applied on TTF generation. Is it possible? For a display font like
    that, I think you would be better set without any hinting at all."

    removed all the hints and it's still the same. Now even the system's preview compresses
    the upper part of the glyphs. The OTF is perfect, though.\r\n\r\nOTF\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/otf2_5557.png]\r\n\r\nTTF\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/ttf2_3960.png]"

    \ \r\n\r\nYou might want to try explicitly convert the outlines to TT yourself
    within the program (without generating the font) and then double-check the glyphs.
    \ (I'm not familiar with Fontographer, but I assume it has a way for you to do
    that, as FL does.)"

    for you all to know, the problem happens whether I generate the TTF directly or
    converting the OTF to TTF.)\r\n\r\nI'll check your suggestions and post later.

    and looked with ttx and that's not the problem. On the other hand, postscript
    fonts allow cubic bezier curves and truetype only quadratic. Since all your \"curves\"
    are straight lines, i.e. of degree 1, I don't see how the problem could come from
    there either. "

  body: "[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Gridfit_2_4944.gif]\r\nI had a brief
    look at the .ttf font using OTM and IMHO what you see is normal rounding. Using
    our own auto-hinter and TTFA did basically not lead to much better results, so
    I don\u2019t think Fontographer is to blame.  If you want to prevent the distortion
    at smaller point sizes, this requires some manual hinting, I reckon.\r\n&nbsp;\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Gridfit_1_4063.gif]\r\nI
    could be wrong, though\u2026\r\n&nbsp;"
