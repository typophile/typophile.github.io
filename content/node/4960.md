body: This is something I&#39;ve been thinking about lately. <BR>What was the first
  digital typeface to have optical sizes? <BR> <BR>I think the first digital font
  to have them was ITC Bodoni <BR>&#40;released in 1994, according to <a href="http://www.daidala.com/itcbodoni.html">
  Daidala</a>&#41;. But, it&#39;s a <BR>revival. <BR> <BR>So. What was the first original
  typeface, created with <BR>digital technology, to have optical sizes? <BR>Maybe
  something from Adobe, back in the days of MMs?

  body: Yes, I think so. Minion MM back in 1991 &#40;which also predates ITC Bodoni&#41;.
    <BR> <BR>Of course, it all depends on what you mean by optical sizes. I suspect
    that Minion MM was the first digital typeface to have the full range of characters
    in a range of optical sizes. <BR> <BR>However, some degree of optical size variation
    had been done even earlier than this. Adobe Garamond, for instance, had an all
    caps titling face back in 1989. <BR> <BR>Of course, Adobe Garamond was a revival.
    But I see the question of revivals versus originals as rather orthogonal to the
    question of optical size variation. <BR> <BR>Regards, <BR> <BR>T

    <BR> <BR>I should have gone on to say that I strongly suspec some other late 80s
    faces had titling or display variants. However, I expect they may have all been
    revivals or fairly straight translations of pre-existing photo or metal typefaces.

    of letterform and slant  is <i>more</i> effective than a single differentiation
    of letterform &#40;upright italic&#41; or slant &#40;sloped roman&#41;. I also
    agree that slant generally makes for greater differentiation than letterform.
    Where I disagree is in how great the differentiation actually needs to be for
    successful reading: I think a well designed upright italic can be perfectly sufficient
    in this regard and that slant, while desirable, is far from necessary. I do not
    think slant is even the &#39;central attribute of an italic&#39;: the central

    overcome being a type designer. If you did you couldn&#39;t design type any more.
    Being type designers make us a bad benchmark for readability. <BR> <BR>Slant is
    central to an italic because it&#39;s the thing that determines what else <i>might</i>
    be needed to pull it sufficiently away from the Roman, and only if the slant isn&#39;t
    strong enough. Slant is also central because it&#39;s the only attribute that&#39;s

    This should be pretty obvious. This is why evaluating a text font by merely reading
    it is not enough. And there&#39;s another reason: a font contains many more glyphs
    than are encountered in any reading session. So reading provides &#34;deterministic&#34;
    evaluation, but not &#34;mathemetical&#34; evaluation: for the latter you have
    to look at each glyph in the font, which is something that doesn&#39;t happen

    eszet - and few people will ever realize. <BR> <BR>-- <BR> <BR>Some more thoughts
    about upright italics: the chances that an emphasized word will be noticed is
    proportional to the length of the word &#40;among other things&#41;. We might

    there are only two of those in English, and one of them &#40;&#34;a&#34;&#41;
    has a structurally different form in cursive, so it&#39;s not disasterous &#40;although
    I might doubt the ability of a reader to appreciate the difference [enough] during
    immersive reading&#41;. And I might further concede that three-letter words are
    pretty safe. But in English two-letter words are about 20% of text! And I think
