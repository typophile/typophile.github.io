  completed its run at Minnesota Center for Book Arts. Thanks to Ryan Loomis for taking
  the pics, and thanks to the Typophile community which was an invaluable source of
  advice, tips, and even loaned objects to help make the show a success. \r\n\r\n[[http://www.flickr.com/photos/36789571@N00/sets/72157607666427822/|Flickr
