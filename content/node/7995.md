body: I picked up a copy of Nature Consrvatory Magazine <BR>and there was a typeface
  that amazed me. It is a modified version of HTF&#39;s Requiem. The lowercase is  slightly
  different, and it has a bold version too. What is the official name?

  body: They use Sabon for body copy, ITC Conduit for heads/sidebars and, yes, Requiem
    for heads and display copy.&#42;  <BR> <BR>Requiem has Text, Display and Fine
    weights. Maybe what you think is bold is just the Text weight used larger than
    intended? <BR> <BR>&#42;The most recent issue of Nature Conservancy I have is
    from 2002, but I don&#39;t think they&#39;ve redesigned since then.

  body: Good eye, Danny -- that &#42;is&#42; a slightly different/modified version
    of Requiem! I hadn&#39;t noticed the missing serifs on the legs of the h, m and
    n when I leafed through the magazine. <BR> <BR>Perhaps this is a pre-release version
    of Requiem? It&#39;s fairly common for Hoefler&#39;s designs to be commissioned/used
    by magazines before they&#39;re available to the general public.&#42; Although
    I have a hard time imagining a non-profit like the Nature Conservancy paying for
    exclusive use of a face. <BR> <BR>The Typophile proprietors are buddies with Mr.
    Hoefler. Perhaps they can shed some light on this question. <BR> <BR>&#42;Heck,
    even the business magazine I art directed back in the &#39;90s used a weight of
    Hoefler&#39;s Champion that wasn&#39;t available for retail sale.

    I hope they don't get revived all at once, because that would be a bitch to keep
    track of. It's not like I actually <em>need</em> the extra work... ;^P"
