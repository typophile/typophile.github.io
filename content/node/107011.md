  I wanted to know if there is like a map, or a listing of interesting typography
  related places to go, like houses where typographers lived, or type museums, or
  I dont know, leterpress printing workshops, and everything related.\r\n\r\nThank
  you!\r\n\r\nPS: If there is no map, perhaps we can create one with google map!"
