  target="_blank">http://www.saville-associates.com</a> <BR> <BR>I wonder if anybody
  else finds this as exciting as I do ... ? And as typically Saville-weird -- it takes
  him until 2004 to get a website moving. <BR> <BR>I guess he&#39;s controversial
  as a designer -- I spoke to a designer acquaintance recently about my visit to the
  <a href="http://www.designmuseum.org/designerex/peter-saville.htm">Peter Saville
  Show</a> at the London Design Museum and he erupted in a rant about how Saville
  was a dilettante, a has-been and a hands-off &#39;Art Director&#39; who only bothers
  to get out of bed &#40;generally at around 4pm&#41; to give a thumbs-up or -down
  to whatever his acolytes are working on. And I&#39;m sure that&#39;s all true. Yet
  still -- to my eye -- everything he touches has a mystery and perfection to it that
  nobody can match. He was the reason -- as for so many people, I&#39;m sure -- that
  I ended up in the field I&#39;m in; the early New Order and Joy Division covers
  were such extraordinary objects that they engendered in me a fascination with design
  -- and particularly type -- that started me on the journey I&#39;m on now. <BR>
  <BR>There&#39;s so much that&#39;s interesting about Saville and his work -- where
  to begin? That his old typographer, Brett Wickens, is now at MetaDesign and supervised
  the current redesign of the Adobe product line, which owes so much to Saville &amp;
  Wickens&#39; work for Yohji Yamamoto? That he&#39;s perhaps single-handedly responsible
  for the revival of the late-modernist Swiss design ethic in the late 80s &#40;and
  which continues today&#41;? <BR> <BR>Did anyone else buy the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/reader/1568984227/ref=sib_dp_pt/104-0443871-5919952#reader-link">book</a>?

    of some recent work. I was more interested in sparking off some discussion about
    Saville himself rather than the site. <BR> <BR>That said, whoever does his web
    design seems obsessed with Shockwave. See <a href="http://www.showstudio.com"

    companion Nick Knight have an involvement in. <BR> <BR>R

  body: Robert, I went to a talk he gave at the Urbis museum last month, thought he
    was one of the most interesting and charismatic speakers I&#39;ve heard in a long
    time. It&#39;s often difficult to distil into words just why his designs have
    such a resonance, the mystery you describe, the uncluttered, classical, almost
    at times austere layouts are why I think his design work has an ageless quality.
    Coupled with his uncanny prescient feel for condensing new contemporary trends
    into a meaningful visual format and you realise Factory were fortunate indeed.  <BR>
    <BR>Someone asked him at the talk which font he wanted on his gravestone, he chose
    News Plantin, used by his own studio on their identity and branding. Quite ironic
    seeing as it was selected by &#39;Graphic Thought Facility&#39; after the Design
    Museum commissioned the agency, when they felt it was too risky hiring Saville
    in case he missed the deadline for his own show! Talk about your reputation preceding
    you.  <BR> <BR>There&#39;s another interesting book which came out late last year,
    a limited edition monograph which has much better quality reproductions, if less
    theory than &#39;Designed...&#39; available <a href="http://www.btinternet.com/~comme6/saville/folio1.htm"

    a good amount of [mis]appropriation used for band paraphernalia and merchandise,

  body: Hi Sarnie, <BR> <BR>The idea to use Wim Crouwel&#39;s New Alphabet was less
    about the importance of his font &#40;although I liked it a lot&#41; than it was
    to combine it with Garamond... I think Peter had a book around with the Neue Alphabet
    in it, and I quite liked it. These were pre-Fontographer days &#40;for us&#41;,
    so I had to draw/re-draw the Crouwel characters I needed and I had the Garamond
    typeset and pasted the whole thing together by hand. It took a lot of fiddling
    to get the balance right, but the idea of something concurrently futuristic and
    classical seemed appropriate for a Joy Division &#39;anthology&#39; in 1989. Of
    course, the Jan Van Munster artworks on the inner liners made the whole story
    complete. <BR> <BR>As for the Adobe posters, they were not for sale. They were
    sent to design schools around the world to promote CS. I only have about five
    file copies myself. You might want to try your local Adobe office &#40;I don&#39;t
    know which country you are in&#41; and enquire there. <BR> <BR> - Brett

  body: Thanks Brett, I came across the Atmosphere and Substance promo posters in
    the Richard Goodall Gallery in Manchester a few years ago. I was struck by how
    exquisite the composition and layout were.  <BR> <BR>One thing I noticed after
    <a href="http://www.foundrytypes.co.uk/" target=_top>The Foundry</a> released
    Neue, was the variation in your use of the underlined letter M for N. Now I appreciate
    if it was hand drawn, you could decide to modify it for aesthetic reasons, though
    I suspect for some of the typographers on this forum, this may be construed as
    heresy &#40;violating Crouwel&#39;s work in such a manner&#41;. <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"

    tainted a word&#41; and yet it is so timeless still.  <BR> <BR>___ <BR> <BR>Speaking
    of Joy Division, the movie <a href="http://www.partypeoplemovie.com/" target="_blank">24
    Hour Party People</a> is a good take on the Manchester music scene of the 80s.
    Prior to seeing the movie I could not appreciate the poor recording quality of
    Joy Division, the lyrics especially. Afterall, I was raised on New Order. But
    the movie tapped me into that psyche somehow. It&#39;s like being able to look
    again at Meta and appreciate its quirks after falling in love with Unit. <BR>

  body: Sarnie, <BR> <BR>I didn&#39;t really modify Crouwel&#39;s font, I simply used
    the M instead of the N for aesthetic reasons. After all, the M is simply the N
    with an underline, in the original font. <BR> <BR>But, if you were to translate
    it according the actual font, I guess you would get SUBSTAMCE, though nobody saw
    it that way. <BR> <BR>About a year after doing that cover, a guy in South Africa
    &#40;Leslie Willmers, I think his name was&#41; emailed me a postscript version
    of the Neue Alphabet which he had painstakingly created - and many years before
    The Foundry got around to it. I still have it somewhere, thought it&#39;s not
    quite perfect. <BR> <BR>And, believe it or not, I actually tried some comps for
    the new Adobe packaging using New Alphabet, but they just looked weird. Without
    the Garamond, and fifteen years later, it all looked painfully trendy - more like
    the packaging for Wipeout XL than something interesting and prescient. <BR> <BR>
