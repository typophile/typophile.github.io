  body: I disagree about Gotham. The S isn&#39;t flat &#40;wide&#41; enough. <BR>Gotham
    is quite regularly geometric, wheras this sample is noticeably wider/flatter.
    True, it could have been graphically widened, but Engravers Gothic already seems
    like it has the right shape, in my opinion.

  body: 'Hmm, you&#39;re right, Mike: it&#39;s not Gotham...  <BR> <BR>but it&#39;s
    not Engraver&#39;s Gothic either. Neither font has an M that descends to the baseline
    like this M does.'

  body: I think this is likely to be something custom, modeled after the classic Chanel
    logotype. I seem to recall hearing about it, not sure though.
