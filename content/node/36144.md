body: "We are creating a hat with \"Asheville NC\" in a serif font on the front. The
  graphic is ~4.5\" wide x .75\" tall. The person requesting this project thinks it
  is too formal to have a comma in between \"Asheville\" and \"NC\" for this particular
  hat. I really didn't know what to tell her, as I have always used a comma in this
  type of project. Is it okay to leave the comma out?\r\n\r\nThank you."

  body: "Hey Abbie,\r\n\r\nThe comma's main grammatical purpose is the separation
    of related elements for clarity. The city and the state are two different things
    but the city resides in the state, clearly. When it comes to branding exercises
    with like this, the particular grammar is probably less important than a design
    reflecting what the client [and, hopefully, their consumer] wants and one that
    is effective. Try playning around with less-than-traditional placements -- maybe
    make \"NC\" the full 3/4\" tall and then have \"Asheville\" start in the counter
    of the \"C\" and project out. Visibly different sizes are one way to maintain
    that \"separation\" factor of a comma without using the glyph.\r\n\r\nHope that
    helps somewhat!\r\n\r\nVinney"
