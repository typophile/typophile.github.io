  looks like futuristic graffiti. He wants something in the style of Extreme-G or
  Virtual On, but readable enough for buttons.\r\n\r\nAny recommendations for fonts
  like that?\r\n\r\n\r\nHere's references,\r\n\r\n[[http://gamesdbase.com/Media/SYSTEM/Nintendo_N64/Title/big/Extreme-G_XG2_-_1998_-_Acclaim_Entertainment.jpg|Extreme-G
