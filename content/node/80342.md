    by [[http://www.ill-studio.com/works/view-all/69-vans-syndicate.htm|ill studio]].\r\nThere's
    also [[http://www.ill-studio.com/media/works/ill_works_69_visuel_n16f.jpg|another
    sample]] that looks to use the same typeface. A modified version is attached...
    Hope that helps.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/ill_works_69_visuel_n16f_5290.jpg]"

  body: Nothing really came pu since for me. Most probably a custom job. For what
    it's worth, if I have to redraw it, I'd probably start from some [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/adobe/garamond|Garamond
    Bold Italic]] using some stylistic alternates for /[[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/adobe/garamond/adobe-garamond-italic/glyphs.html#glyphs/505941/512|L]]
    and /[[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/adobe/garamond/adobe-garamond-italic/glyphs.html#glyphs/505941/513|M]]
    and customize it.

    drawn. This is not a type customized. It's handmade.  ;-)
