  SketchFlow Print...\r\n\r\nhttp://www.marksimonson.com/article/257/sneak-preview-sketchflow-print\r\n\r\n...and

    should be aware that the Wikipedia entry about expression blend explains it infinitely
    better than Microsoft.com does\u2026\r\n\r\nGreat fonts tho."

  body: The fonts are great, but not for sketching. Sorry, but they're almost unreadable
    at a small size. Comic Sans is better. Chalkboard on OS X is even better. And
    I can't find the option in Blend 3 to make it stop defaulting to Buxton Sketch.
    :-(
