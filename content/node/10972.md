    youth, a revered part of religious ceremonies, and now a new controversial therapy
    for sufferers of AIDS, cancer, glaucoma, and other chronic illnesses. Pot is the
    most widely used illegal drug...&#34;

    the way the letters get jumpy around the baseline? is that like letters &#34;letting

    look at it, I really might not use too many, if any, silly fonts. I agree with
    Joe.

  body: Yes but... isn&#39;t  it also maddeningly difficult to get college students
    to pick something up, let alone read it? Besides, the &#34;the munchies and giggles&#34;
    as a title &#40;guess I should ask, is that for real?&#41; doesn&#39;t do much
    to help set a serious tone. <BR> <BR>A lot of the drug info around has such a
    cheesy, almost patronizing feel to it, like a bad After School Special or bible
    tract. Uninviting to open, destined for the waste basket. Or, worse,  some student
    will pick it up and read from it aloud for giggles while getting stoned.  <BR>
    <BR>Communicating this sort of info is actually a major challenge. <BR> <BR> <BR>

  body: interesting point. type reflects values &#40;especially to people who study
    it, design it, are obsessed with it, and associate strongly with it&#41; and therefore
    designers are responsible for making type choices that most accurately convey
    the message being presented.    <BR>   <BR>that gets interesting when multiple
    messages are being presented; in this case the issue

    is  <BR>a good one. and Cobra is a fairly readable type as well,  <BR>just in
    case you want to use it for some text. it gives  <BR>you that slightly-too-relaxed
    kind of feeling -- not  <BR>exactly light-hearted, maybe just an honest reference.

    smoking for about two hours and it&#39;s only 11:30 in the morning. I wonder what
