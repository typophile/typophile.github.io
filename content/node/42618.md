body: "Any suggestions for a body font suitable for a dictionary, or what features
  comprises a good font selection for such a use?\r\n\r\nThe dictionary in question
  is Aramaic-English, would be around 1500 pages, and would also include (lots of)
  Hebrew and (occasional) Greek characters, so Opentype solutions which include those
  ranges would be gravy.\r\n\r\nThe newest Oxford Dictionary uses Frutiger together
  with FF Parable, which does the job and is legible. I'd love to use FF Strada for
  this but don't know how well it would reproduce at small sizes. Any input would
  be appreciated.\r\n\r\nThanks!"

    have to dig to make sure of the character set, given your needs. It might be that
    Andron is the only one with Greek and Hebrew, but investigate. This is a tall

  body: "Do you know what typeface you will be using for the Aramaic? You can find
    quite a few fonts with both Latin and Greek support, but you'll most likely need
    a separate font for the Aramaic/Hebrew.\r\n\r\nThe SBL BibLit fonts would be ideal,
    since they support all three scripts, but they won't be ready until later this
    year (and the first release will be roman and italic only)."
