  a monoline slab serif font. I would really appreciate some professional comments.
  Thanks.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/nomoda2_5511.jpg]"

  body: "I really like it \u2014 there are some very creative glyphs happening too,
    I just *love* the \u2018@\u2019, which in it's \u2018round\u2019 form I find just
    plain ugly in print. The oblique version is very eye-catching, and as a whole,
    I really like the font. I think there's a lot of use for it. However, there are
    some curves that just feel a bit stressed to me.\r\n\r\nThe 'ct' discretionary
    seems to be a bit heavy on the top curve that runs from the top of the lc 'c'
    to the 't'. In the attached jpg, it's also a bit pixely. Perhaps it's just an
    akward anti-alias by the program you used to set it in, but it seems a bit off.
    I expirience the same with 'st'. Perhaps the curve should be a bit more straight.
    Also, the '@' in the oblique version could use some edge on the leftmost curve,
    like you can see on the left side of the capital 'A'. It's unusually slanted when
    compared to the rest of the letterforms. And as a side note, once again, it could
    be me, but your lc 'x' feels like it is leaning a bit to the left.\r\n\r\n"

  body: "I think it's looking crisp. Only thing coming to mind right now is, that
    it looks like the right side strokes on the italic 'k' is a bit thin, when compared
    to the other strokes. But it seems that you might have done that on purpose. :)\r\nI
    agree with Sebastiaan on the 'x', although the leaning might also be caused by
    the serifs of the 'x' and the 'w' almost touching in your specimen. But it isn't
    really that bad, imo."
