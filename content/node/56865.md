  \"read\":  Anavi Ink\r\n\r\nHowever as you can see in the first logo it is AnavInk\r\n\r\nI
  want to convey a feel of vintage and organic with just a touch of the feminine and

    lettershapes and a bit of splotchiness/spontaneity/hand-craft/\u2026; #2 and #4
    seem overly messy. (Though I don't know how you work! ;-) )\r\n\r\nI think #1
    clearly reads as \"anavink\".\r\n\r\nRegarding how to connect the two \"i\"s,
    how about something in this direction? (Hope you don't mind the quick comp.)\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/anavi-idea_4174.gif]\r\n#7
    might also work quite nicely but I'd try making the top of the \"I\" look more
    like it could also be a lowercase \"i\". But then it might look too much like
    a numeral one. Hmm."

  body: "Hi Altaira,\r\n\r\nThanks for the thoughtful crit. I see what you mean I
    think those two are too messy and manly also. I like your idea of reversing the
    i since that feels a little bit quirky which works well with the style I have
    also. I will play with your idea and #7 some more. Thanks a bunch!\r\n\r\nLast
    question..how do you like the splotch? I did it on the computer, but if it doesn't
    \"feel\" right then I can also make a real ink splotch on paper scan it in and
    trace it in Illustrator..I want to make sure it feels genuine."

    type. On the other hand, none of the big ones work...\r\n\r\nso you either:\r\n1.
    try to make a big splatter work\r\n2. remove detail from the small one (I would
    also enlarge it a bit)\r\n\r\nregarding #7. It's probably better to have it as
    capital I, but what should definitely be done is stem weight to match other letters.\r\n\r\nAnd
    apart from my comment with \"1 and 2\"... I'd separate splatter from the letters.
    I guess that's a good way of using a bigger splatter. If you make the splatter
    somehow resemble letter \"a\" it would be even better. But it should look natural
    and not too artificial/pushed... Or maybe use letter \"a\" and replace the bowl
    with a splatter. Could be a nice logo symbol. And probably also a very nice and
    original use of splatter.\r\n\r\nSplatters are usually visually pleasing, natural
    and beautiful. So I would just use 'em as is.\r\n___________\r\n<em>Robert Koritnik</em>"

  body: "<em>\"how do you like the splotch?\"</em>\r\nI like it. At this size, it
    didn't strike me as artificial at all (at least when it's used small). But you'd
    have to show a PDF to be sure.\r\n\r\nI don't agree with Litera's point of equalizing
    the level of detail. To my eye, this contrast in detail-level between the type
    and the splotch is very interesting visually and works just fine;* plus, I don't
    think it's so <em>very</em> detailed that you'll run into reproduction issues
    at a \"normal\" size/usage.\r\n\r\n* Though I've been known to like more extreme
    levels of contrast than other designers, so maybe it's just me. But coming back
    to the artificiality question above, I'm thinking if you make the splotch less
    detailed, it might just stop looking like a splotch!"
