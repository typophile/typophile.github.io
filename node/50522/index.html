  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Hi All,

See image:
http://img72.imageshack.us/img72/1531/picture27hm9.jpg

Can anyone help, I have seen this a few times and never quite figured out how get it right. Colour overlayed with a slight transparency, here are what I see as potential issues with applying it (In Indesign):

Multiply is just a full over print - too much

Reducing the opacity - compromises the full colour over white

Hard Light - this is the closest I have got but over white it makes the colour brighter than over nothing

I wanted to use this for a corporate job but don't want to specify something that I don't fully understand.

Any help is much ablidged.

Thanks
Steve.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">It looks to me as though the overprinting colour here is an opaque gold, which would explain why the black underneath is far more muted. A way of achieving this in 4 colour process would be to reduce the opacity of the colour underneath in the area that was being overprinted.

See image below.

		<div class="commentbody">Thanks but the problem is that it needs to be used over photography, and as a corporate guide, so not always me applying it. So it needs to be simple, maybe it isn't possible.

Here is an example of the actual work i'm doing:
http://img139.imageshack.us/my.php?image=picture30xo7.jpg

It shows how the red reacts with the white, when it should stay the same as the solid colour rather than brightening it. This causes a problem with changing a brands corporate logo colour!

Any help?</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Indeed it is complicated. But like all problems you start out with a complicated solution and then simplify it. Sometimes you’re lucky and a simple solution presents itself from the beginning.

If it needs to be applied by a monkey, create one big shiny button – in this case a custom Action, Plugin or your own transparency filter, which can be included on the guidelines CD or website for download.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Yeah I hadn't thought of that, thanks it definitely works across the board.
I'll have to apply it throughout the work and see how it fares, many thanks for that.

Ahh, just applied it again and now because of the multiply the copy goes greyish over any black. It means the text box would have to be an additional layer, so White 60% then Red multiply then text box. Hmm quite a lot of layers per text box?
