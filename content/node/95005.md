  body: "Can't be 100% positive but most probably custom job exclusively done for
    E. Tautz. Branding and identity have been created by [[http://www.movingbrands.com/?category_name=e-work|Moving
    Brands]]. When looking at the branding process, it seems that they have designed
    and created the whole thing from scratch. \r\nAs it looks very generic to me (for
    these letters at least) [[http://www.myfonts.com/search/Futura|Futura]] (or some
    of its \"alternatives\" like Soleil, Sofia, Code, Novocento, Superla... suggested
    on the same page at MF) would get you close without too much effort. "
