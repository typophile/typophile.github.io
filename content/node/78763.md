  body: "The Centro and Vista Slab fonts were pretty close, but Vista seem more condensed,
    so I agree with SB. Even though I couldn't get the alternate 'a' in the test drive,
    you can see how similar they are structurally.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/facebookCentro_5143.gif]\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/facebookVistaSlab_5400.gif]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe
    top one is Centro Slab.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
