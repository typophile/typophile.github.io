  works very well. For a while I have contemplated the prospect of typesetting mathematics
  via letterpress, namely with Monotype's 4-line system.\r\n<!--break-->\r\nMy question:
  does anyone know where the equipment (caster, keyboards, etc.) could be obtained?
  I am unsure on their value and rarity, so I apologize in advance if such a question
  is rather inane. \r\n\r\nMiscellaneous comments: I realize that this technology
  is relatively obsolete with the introduction of digital printing. I also am very
  well aware that this is a less flexible, more expensive, and more time consuming
  process than simply using digital systems. But, I suppose the quality of the result
  and the classic feel of it is worth more to me."

    Industrial &gt; Printing &amp; Graphic Arts. Also be prepared to pick the thing
    up: these machine weight a ton, if not literally, at least figuratively.\r\n\r\nAnother
    thing to consider is the learning curve: I've had opportunity to see Linotype
    operators in action, and it's reminiscent of the doings of \"the man behind the
    curtain\" in the <em>Wizard of Oz</em>."

  body: "oldnick: Yeah, it would require a pretty good amount of space and time. They
    are incredibly complicated machines (as you've witnessed), probably one of the
    most beautiful pieces of engineering -- both the Linotype and Monotype machines.\r\n\r\nI
    also realize it has a pretty steep learning curve. In the most ideal situation,
    I'd apply for an apprenticeship at, say, the Arion Press in California, but I
    can't afford to move there and stay for four years.\r\n\r\nFortunately I have
    a good handle on the non-mechanical stuff -- especially the way text and mathematics
    is structured physically on paper. I've also read Rehak's book \"Practical Typecasting\"."

  body: "My suspicion is that, at this time, the rarity of Monotype casters is such
    that attempting to obtain one at this late date is out of the question. I could
    be wrong, but I believe that all surviving specimens are in museums by now.\r\n\r\nI
    do agree that this is a fascinating topic. The book \"The Printing of Mathematics\"
    describes typesetting mathematics on a Monotype caster before the 4-line system
    came out. There are two very interesting papers by Daniel Rhatigan which describe
    the 4-line system in some detail at\r\n\r\nhttp://www.typeculture.com/academic_resource/articles_essays/\r\n\r\n...
    a Google search will turn up direct links to the PDF papers, which the server
    apparently does not allow to work, so you need to go to this index page instead.\r\n\r\nThe
    basis of 4-line mathematics comes from a simpler feature found on Linotype machines
    (and, despite their lesser flexibility, mathematics can be typeset to some extent
    even on them) called \"Advertising Figures\".\r\n\r\nBasically, both Linotype
    and Monotype machines offered special attachments so that the digits and other
    characters needed to express prices, like the dollar sign and the period, could
    be cast in a face that was double the height of the normal typesetting being performed,
    and then overhang (in the Linotype case) or displace (in the Monotype case) the
    appropriate spaces on the next or previous line.\r\n\r\nThis was useful for certain
    styles of small advertisements (resembling classified ads, but set in a serif
    face - tucked in the back corners of magazines instead of newspapers).\r\n\r\nFour-line
    mathematics worked a bit like that. Normal values in equations were \"double height\",
    with the real height of the characters produced being that used for superscripts
    and subscripts. Two pairs of lines like that were usually what would be used for
    typical equations where you would have the ratio of two polynomials - each polynomial
    would be constructed from two lines, and there would be a rule between them, hence
    the term \"four-line mathematics\"."

  body: "quadibloc: Thanks for the reply. That's how it seems -- that such machines
    are probably put in museums, destroyed, or not at all in working order. And if
    there was a machine available, the full thing would cost me a fortune.\r\n\r\nI
    have read those papers. They were very informative about how mathematics was typeset.\r\n\r\nI
    guess these days, some sort of photopolymer plate + computer is the way to go
    (if you don't intend on getting some huge 6-color press). Just doesn't match the
    quality of old letterpress though. :("

  body: "There are still a number of people operating Monotype equipment, and the
    equipment is available for sale from time to time. I'm not sure about how easy
    it is to get the matrices and keybars for the math typesetting system. The best
    way to find out more is to get in touch with the American Typecasting Fellowship;
    you just missed their biennial gathering earlier this month. There is a little
    bit of info here:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.ppwv.com/TellmeMore/atf.html\r\n\r\nIf you
    go to the home page for ppwv.com, you can find contact info for Rich Hopkins,
    who leads the group. "

  body: "G'day\r\n\r\nI'll do this post (my first ever) in two hits, because my first
    try (1,000 words) just vanished. \r\n\r\nIn the '60's, I worked at a company called
    Santype, of Salisbury (UK). They were probably the premier typesetter of mathematics
    for high-quality books in England, and also did a great deal of work for the US
    market. They also specialized in topological treatises, and many foreign languages
    (including non-Roman typefaces). \r\n\r\nI was one of about 6 4-line monotype
    operators (although still an apprentice!), and it was a job that I still look
    back on as my most enjoyable. I also worked for a short time for Harrisons of
    London, on an experimental 10/8pt mathematical system. \r\n\r\nSantype also set
    up a satellite company in Richmond (Va) in the '70's (I believe Byrd was part
    of the name). The manager is still alive, living in Arizona. \r\n\r\nPost-1"

  body: "Post-2\r\nMr Quadrescence's project is quite admirable in many ways. However,
    it would be inadvisable to try and do it all himself.\r\n\r\nThere must be many
    museums and print hobby clubs that possess Monotype keyboards and casters, and
    I'd recommend he try and find someone in one of these organisations as enthusiastic
    as himself to look into the rebirth of 4-line. \r\n\r\nNew Zealand has only 2
    or 3 Monotype keyboard/linecaster pairs, only one of which was still operational
    in 2008. The museum I belong to has only a fragile supercaster. The country does
    have a relatively large number of Linotypes and Intertypes. \r\n\r\nI wish Mr
    Q all the best, hope he's successful in sourcing the many and varied pieces of
    equipment needed for 4-line, including a good proportion of the more than 10,000
    matrices that were cut. \r\n\r\nI can advise that Alembic Press (UK) did have
    quite a range of 4-line information, but I'm not sure they're still in existence.
    \r\n\r\nBest of luck! "
