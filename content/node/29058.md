    and I've wanted to know where it was available. Do you know a bookseller who has
    it? I couldn't find it at any price. "

  body: "Alessandro, although it's really late in coming since you've posted the link
    a while ago, thank you for a really interesting collection of Estonian lettering.\r\n\r\nSome
    of the lettering styles remind me of some Finnish lettering styles, in particular
    that on the cover of an edition of <em>Kalevala</em> I saw as a child (and that
    I cannot now find an image of, to my annoyance). It had thick, angular letterforms
    with idiosyncracies such as the top bar on the As. To see a similar lettering
    style pop up in Rudolf Koemets's design for <em>Kalevipoeg</em> in particular
    is exciting.\r\n\r\nI'm vaguely reminded of Basque lettering as well, so maybe
    there is something going on with late adopters of the roman alphabet by non-Indo-European
    speakers?"
