  body: "Thanks guys. It does appear that someone just stretched Shogun Light vertically.
    It actually works really well here too. I like the proportions in the logo much
    better than those of the actual typeface.\r\n\r\nWhat do you mean by original
    proportions? Is there a story behind Shogun Light?\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/commonsType_4626.jpg]"

  body: Well, Shogun looks like a really odd face that has been digitally stretched
    to create the different widths. So my take on it is that originally looked like
    the Commons logo. I don't understand why Chase and Lipton did that.
