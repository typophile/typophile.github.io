body: "Hi, I've not used Illlustrator too much. I've just made a logo by breaking
  apart outlines of text and repositioning the frangments. \r\n\r\nIt would be great
  if there was a way to join these little shapes, as I now have the larger shapes
  completed, but the fragments still appear when I select them with the pointer. Also
  I'd like to keep this file as vector art. \r\n\r\nAny advice would be much appreciated.
  I've included a small example...This is the N in my logo, I'd like only to keep
  the outline of the letter. \r\n\r\nThank you, \r\n\r\nJesse"

    objects. In the Pathfinder Pallet use Compound Shape to make it one shape. If
    you like that then hit commit button.\r\n\r\nI have a cool tip on Pallet Management
    if you are interested."
