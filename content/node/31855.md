  body: Hmmm... Victorian 3D type. There's a sample in a book by Nicolete Gray, and
    I've seen it used on an album cover by Neutral Milk Hotel (I think)... I'm not
    home right now, so I can't look in the Nicolete Gray book. I'll try to post more
    info later.

  body: I checked the Nicolete Gray book last night... there are samples of perspective
    type, but not this particular alphabet... I'll have to take a look at the "American
    Wood Type" book, maybe that's where I saw it.
