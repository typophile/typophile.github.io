  this font before, reinstalled windows and now its gone and I cant find it anywhere
  again.\r\n\r\ntheres also a white background version thats kind of the negative
  of this. but they should be together.\r\n\r\n(and yes those are two forward slashes
  (//))\r\n\r\nwould really appreciate it if someone found out what it was.\r\n\r\nthanks"
