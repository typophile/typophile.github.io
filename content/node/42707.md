  the attached image. The image is a screen grab from Jean-Pierre Melville's <em>Un
  Flic</em> and appears around the 17 minute mark (if anyone is interested in seeing
  the sign in context).\r\n\r\nMy gut tells me that the sign is hand drawn and that
  there isn't a typeface of such design. I'll be happy with getting something similar
  as a foundation for basing my own hand drawn version on.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance!\r\n\r\n-
