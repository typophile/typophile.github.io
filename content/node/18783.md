body: "Hi all,\r\nI'm desiging my wedding invitation and am using Dear Sarah for the
  display names. Does anyone have recommendations for the body copy? Right now I'm
  looking at Trajan, Requim, and Penumbra.  The artwork features handrawn plum blossoms
  so if I could find an elegant match that suggests an asian feel that would be great.
  Thanks for any recommends...\r\nAM"

    \r\n\r\nDo you need U/lc or is all UC ok?"

  body: "All Upper for the invite, but for the accompaning pieces I might like to
    use some L/C.\r\nHere are two variations on the theme Trajan (top) & Requim (bottom).
    The blossoms will be made perfect once I decide on just one or two bunches. Please
    weigh-in on which is working better.\r\nI should mention the invite will be letterpressed.
    The colors are  silver for the border, some peony pink for the flowers and names,
    and a  brown for text.\r\nThanks![img:sites/default/files/old-images/ONE.jpg]"

  body: I'm not sure either really go; Dear Sarah is a pointed pen script, but Trajan
    and Requiem are shaped by a flat brush or nib (and are much more formal too).
    Of the two I think Requiem is the better match, but look at something like Bulmer,
    or Fry's Baskerville, as well.

  body: why not just use the small caps of Dear Sarah for the rest of your text? that
    way you can keep the same feeling throughout the whole invite?

    Baskerville, which was its starting point.  '

  body: Mrs Eaves would be stylistically perfect, but it might be a bit low on contrast
    to really function letterpress; one of the nice things about it is that it has,
    as it were, built-in inkpress.

  body: "I think you could also consider an elegant sans serif like Sackers Gothic,
    Nobel, or even a light weight of Futura.\r\n\r\nI like the bottom design better
    but both are quite nice. I'm not in love with the grey border, maybe it could
    be a little lighter either in tint or in weight.\r\n\r\nWhy does Barry get a \"Mr.\"?\r\n\r\nHave
    you considered an ampersand between the names? Dear Sarah has a nice one.\r\n\r\nand
    of course congratulations."
