  on has been an ongoing mystery. Rick Yaeger has identified most of the Firefly-related
  fonts here: [[http://blogs.macmerc.com/rick/?p=232]].\r\n\r\nI feel like I've seen
  those f's in some kind of OpenType ligature example."

    so hard to accept the idea that lettering can be done without using a computer.
    Unless you can find other examples of using this 'font' for more than this logo,
    I think you have to consider that maybe this lettering was done freehand.\r\n\r\n-

    out that it was freehand, and if that were the case I was hoping that somebody
    in the community would know who was responsible.\r\n\r\nAt any rate, it might
    inspire to take up arms and draw the rest of the alphabet as a learning experiment."
