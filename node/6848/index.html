<div class=commentbody>I goddam love Compatil, and have since the moment I saw it. <br>It's the most <i>mature</i> typesystem ever. <br> <br>And the pricing is very interesting: because it's very high, it becomes a sort of semi-exclusive face - not <i>totally</i> yours, but not plastered all over the place. <br> <br>hhp</div>

<div class=commentbody>Corporate ASE is a type system with three separate families: a serif, a slab serif, and a sans serif. Compatil has four: a Venetian serif, a transitional serif, a slab serif, and a humanist sans serif. <br> <br>The letter widths of individual letters in each of the four Compatil families are the same. This is not a monospaced font! "i" is still narrower than "w"</div>

<div class=card-body>
<div class=commentbody>A number of designers dislike Compatil (and Unica, and other rational fonts), and some of them possibly because they consider themselves artists (whether they admit it or not), and the worlds of expression and logic are partly opposed. So something that makes a lot of sense is in a way threatening to the "culture" of some type designer. Artists can make some types of fonts better than craftsmen, and the other way around too. But even though no person is purely one or the other, the more you're close to one extreme of the axis the more liable you are to focus your hatred on the other extreme. Very few people can be both at one extreme and appreciative of the other extreme. <br> <br>hhp</div>

<div class=commentbody>On second thought ... I suppose the glyphs themselves seem a little ... erm ... safe for me. Which does translate into corporate, which doesn't mean it is necessarily a bad thing. <br> <br>However, before digital type, before photocomposition, Dwiggins (and many others) were designing for Linotype with all sorts of constraints and still managed to create beautiful type that worked and looked good in spite of those constraints.</div>

<div class=commentbody>> Technology shouldn't lead. <br> <br>I agree. But I don't think technology is the same thing as functionality through logic. <br> <br>As for beauty, not only is it subjective, but I feel the need to always remind myself to look beyond formal aesthetics when searching for true beauty. For example, among all the glyphs Dwiggins has made the most attractive to me is that funky lc "a" which was designed according his "scientific" leanings. <br> <br>hhp</div>

<div class=commentbody>Yes. I agree that it is subjective. Completely Subjective. If it weren't we'd not have so much from which to choose. I also agree that, perhaps, technology and function are different. Compatil was created, I think, for a specific "functional" purpose, and so it should perform. I'll just leave it at that.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Let explain me a bit more, <br> <br>I have nothing against such concept of various styles on a same family (well I have done one myself, hum). There is some good use of that, and many families demonstrated good design solution for that concept for long (JvK, Unger, Stone, Majoor, etc). <br> <br>But what I can't "accept" on Compatil is the way they tried to fit all forms on one same unique structure, missing that the different style can stick to same set of basic forms. Its a too universal approche for my eye. <br> <br>"Oldstyle" have some obvious characteristics, "Sans" others, etc. If not adjusted with sensibility, your design quickly became a monster, and some element of Compatil are like that, the various styles can't be "Compatibles." <br> <br>Another thing (from my actual knowledge, based on the type specimen), is pretending doing a universal family but providing no italic is a bit bizarre. <br> <br>Last, when you look at the design itself of the letterforms, well, the letterforms not balance well to the eyes, like the Frutiger Next too when Avenir Next is wonderful compared.</div>

<div class=commentbody>While a nice concept piece, I'd have to agree with JFP - obliques rather than italics, combined with the inevitable compromises that come from not allowing inherent characteristics of different classes of typeface to express themselves make it look, well, <i>bland</i>. And a bit cheap. IMHO. <br> <br>Its like making the perfect car for all purposes.

<div class=commentbody>> Its a too universal approche for my eye. <br> <br>I dislike "universality" as much as you (probably more) but I think it's important to remember the "design brief". A style's preferred characteristics (for example that an old-style should have a smaller x-height*) are important, but not sacrosanct - matching apparent size between the styles for example can be just as important. It depends on the intent, and because it "bends" the styles, Compatil becomes more useful in certain ways it couldn't have if it didn't bend them. <br> <br>* Which is why Iowan Old-Style for example seems awkward - we probably agree. (Although the caps are great.) <br> <br>> providing no italic is a bit bizarre. <br> <br>That I can agree with, even though I believe that for <i>users</i> slanted Romans aren't as bad as we might like to think. <br> <br>hhp</div>

<div class=commentbody>Kris: I think the main thing Compatil can do which extremely few typeface systems can is create a calm underlying harmony (for example by maintaining apparent size) in publications that need to mix many styles. <br> <br>As for subservience, I'm the one always opposing a strict hierarchy between things like historical integrity, formal harmony, etc. so I totally agree with you there. <br> <br>hhp</div>

<div class=commentbody>Compatil DOES have true italics. They were made available last week, and are only available as a whole package, through an exclusive corporate license (so, you won't find them as individual weights on the web site). <br> <br>The reason for the strange proportions (all four subfamilies shar the same character widths) was so that you could change text from one style to another without having line wrap change, which can be important in business communication purposes.

<div class=commentbody>Well, Linotype is not a graphic design studio. We make typefaces for other graphic designers to use. Compatil was designed in response to a direct request from a client, and Linotype</div>

<div class=commentbody>A couple of comments at the 'Making Faces' seminar in New York last week are relevant to the issue of whether the 'brief' for Compatil is a good or a misguided idea. <br> <br>Matthew Carter was asked about his redesigns of Cheltenham for the New York Times. The questioner noted that some of the titles that had before been in different typefaces were now being taken over more and more by Cheltenham. Was this a loss? <br> <br>Carter said that whether to use more or fewer faces was really a matter for the Times to decide, but he personally didn't really see any advantage to a great many faces. He explained that historically the same face was just not available in different sizes and weights, so newspapers were more or less forced to use many typefaces. He did note that he designed, IIRC, five different versions of Cheltenham for the Times, for different uses. <br> <br>The other comment was from David Berlow in answer to a question about the proliferation of families with a huge variety of weights and widths - much in evidence in both the Font Bureau and the HFJ foundry's faces. He retorted "We didn't start this you know," --explaining that the demand for a variety of weights and widths came from publications themselves. <br> <br>Reinforcing the merit of a variety of weights was another comment from Matthew Carter. He was in general refreshingly modest, but one slide he was clearly proud of, saying 'this is where I earn my keep.' It was a picture of a serif face with 3 different weights superimposed. The lines of the different weights were close, but the relationship between the different weights was clearly non-linear, and the serifs and joins were treated differently. <br> <br>What I took from this was that all the optical and other adjustments of a face for different sizes and uses in a publication is actually quite useful and valuable, but the multiplication of faces in a single publication is questionable.</div>

<div class=commentbody>>how many weights is too many? <br> <br>Maybe I wasn't clear. What I understood is that a multiplication of weights for different sizes and purposes is useful, but that different faces, with different underlying structures, such as an old face and slab face is a problem. <br> <br>How many weights it would seem is dictated by the needs of the publication. Newspapers, which have a lot of information and charts and pictures to present, often in narrow columns - and which want to be 'skimmable' - seem to have a much higher demand than most books.</div>
