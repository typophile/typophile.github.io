    unnecessary big images and do not exceed <strong>600 pixels</strong> in width.</em>\r\n\r\nMaybe
    try to post a sample that's a little more adapted to the size of the average monitor
    next time. 1600 pixels is a wee bit much. ;^)\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/B00020HBZA_3650.01._SS500_SCLZZZZZZZ_.jpg]"
