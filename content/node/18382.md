  some suggestions on what others feel are the most elegant ,margin proportions for
  8.5 by 11 inch paper.\r\n"

  body: "The writer of this fairly informative set of web pages suggests 1.55 in on
    left and right, 1 in on top, 1.25 in on bottom.  It gives a ratio of text height
    to text width which turns out to be the golden mean. He claims it's the shortest
    line length he can get away with, without the page looking weird.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.nbcs.rutgers.edu/~hedrick/typography/\r\n\r\nI'm
    an ameteur as well. It's always nice to have some concrete suggestions, since
    the expert opinion often seems to be \"use the most aethetically appealing choice.\"

    based on someone else's aesthetic judgement."

        I use equal margins, but on anything else I'll usually use unequal margins.
        Since I think about class handouts most often, that was what came to mind

        body: "Thanks everyone for your help.\r\n\r\nI wonder though, if the paper
          dimensions - 8.5x11 - are not conducive to nice single column typesetting,
          what do you actually do, given that that is the paper standard for North
          America. When you write a business letter, or any kind of correspondence
          which will be printed on a piece of paper this size, what margins do you
          actually use?\r\n\r\nInterestingly, Frank Lloyd Wright actually turned the
          paper horizontally, the bottom half of the left hand side was used for his
          mark (a black square) and his signature, and the right half of the sheet
          he used to make a nice size text block, but this seems inappropriate for
          a business/professional context.\r\n\r\nI've been trying to use smaller
          type (11 pt), but maybe sticking with 12 pt would be bettr given the unfortunate
          measure that seems required.\r\n \r\nMy intention is to take two or three
          suggestions and try them out to see which ones appeal most.\r\n\r\nThanks
          everyone"

  body: "A pretty good universal solution is to divide the page diagonal into a certain
    number of equal parts and then use one such part as the top and inner margin (plus
    some additional binding gutter) and two such parts as the bottom and outer margin.
    \r\n\r\nThe traditional Renaissance book used the division of both the horizontal
    and the vertical edge into 9 parts, so you'd have a 1 + 6 + 2 division of the
    page. However, this gives you very generous margins that don't work well in today
    publications. Therefore, you could try e.g. a division into 12 equal parts (1
    + 9 + 2). \r\n\r\nIf you reserve 0.2 inch for the binding gutter and divide the
    page into 12 equal parts, you'll have the inner margin of 0.692\", the outer margin
    of 1.383\", the top margin of 0.917\" and the bottom margin of 1.833\". Perhaps
    it's better to calculate in points -- in that case, you'd have the inner margin
    of 50 pt (plus a 14 pt binding gutter), the outer margin of 100 pt, the top margin
    of 66 pt and the bottom margin of 132 pt. \r\n\r\nOf course, if you'd like to
    be a more generous, you can try to divide the page edges into 9 equal parts and
    use the 1 + 6 + 2 principle. \r\n\r\nA.\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: "I don't think you can answer this independent of the typeface involved. I
    personally find that Bringhurst's (and Felici's) recommendation of an ideal single
    column width of 66 lower case characters--2 1/2 lc alphabets is very important
    to readability. And he is right that more than 75 to 80 characters starts to slow
    the reader down. \r\n\r\nThis being the case, most 'letter' sized pages with Times
    New Roman have much too long a measure. So to make layout work on letter sized
    paper is a challenge. You can use a very wide typeface like Century School Book
    or even Courier--which not accidentally works perfectly as far a line length on
    a letter sized paper with comfortable but not wide margins. \r\n\r\nGenerally,
    you are better off using a wide left margin and putting titles in it, or going
    for a magazine style of two or three columns with a narrower typeface. \r\n\r\nIf
    you are going for a wider measure and a narrow typeface, then ample leading between
    lines and short paragraphs with extra space in between helps.   "

  body: "Here's a thought-- if you're talking about one fat column with a margin on
    an 8.5x11 sheet, aren't we talking mainly about ruled note-paper  and double-spaced
    typed manuscripts, really? Magazines in this size virtually always break up the
    space into columns, modules, etc., as suggested above. So, I would guess that
    although you <em>could</em> find a nice set of proportions in the one-column,
    8.5x11 environment, that's really kind of forcing things from a typesetting point
    of view.\r\n\r\nFWIW, I tend to see that kind of page as a magnified version of
    something smaller-- i.e., you'd be better off setting type in something closer
    to 14 pt in most cases, then reducing for publication (or just to 75% on your
    screen). With 1-inch margins, e.g., 12-point TNR often occupies at least 80 characters
    of linear space-- way too big."

  body: "I should try to address this, since I'm supposedly a teacher of professional
    and technical communication. Here's what I think people do to sort of fight against
    the less-than-ideal environment of 8.5x11:\r\n\r\n1. Use 1.25 in margins on L
    and R. In fact, MS Word defaults to this, although usually publishers and editors
    ask for 1 inch all around. Then again, they often ask for double-spacing.\r\n\r\n2.
    Use massive top and bottom margins for short letters, you know, like we all learned
    how to \"center\" a business letter between the top and bottom of the page when
    using a typewriter. Sticking a letterhead or logo at the top (or even the word
    \"MEMORANDUM\" in a huge size for memos) is also used to break up vertical space.\r\n\r\n3.
    Add space between paragraphs.\r\n\r\nNotice that 2 and 3 above are about breaking
    things up vertically; I think it's just one way of balancing positive and negative
    space on the page field. Paragraphs may still be very wide.\r\n\r\n4. Tolerate
    a too-big sheet and just go on with life. 99% of this kind of communication is
    meant to be pragmatic, servicable, etc., with no real consideration of artfulness.\r\n\r\n\"For
    pros\": Set up, as someone may have suggested above, a left-hand column of about
    2 or 2.5 inches width, for logo, masthead, contact info, etc. Effectively this
    narrows your \"body\" column dramatically. Then you can set stuff in that second
    column with healthy top and bottom margins without it looking all skinny. This
    is often done on commercial and organizational letterhead, where there's a budget
    to do so, so it's sort of a different animal than the run-of-the-mill correspondance
    1-4 refer to."

  body: "Hello,\r\n\r\nYou should try applying Villard's diagram to your page, you
    can read about it on Tschichold's \"The Form of the Book\". I used to draw the
    diagram in Illustrator and then transfer the margin values to InDesign (or Pagemaker,
    Xpress, etc.) but it was pretty boring to draw all those lines, so I've managed
    to determine the equations of the lines and come up with an Excel file. All I
    have to do now is enter the dimenstions of my sheet of paper and the number of
    times I want to divide it and it gives me the appropriate margins based on Villard's
    diagram. I can upload the file if you're interested. Another way of determining
    your margins is to use the method of Paul Renner as described by Jost Hochuli
    in his \"Designing Books\", but I've found the proportions to be too arbitrary,
    and never quite understood their origin, so I prefer Villard's (also Tschichold's)
    method. :)"

  body: Something important I forgot to post, the values given by Villard's diagram
    are determined by the number of divisions you make. The number of divisions is
    determined by your measure (width of your column) and for that I use Bringhurst's
    "average character count per line" table (p.29 of "Elements of Typographic Style").
    One last thought, the values given by the diagram are not definitive, you will
    always have to make some adjustments in the depht and width of your columns, but
    it's a good starting point.

  body: "I don't feel the need to either fill up the page or have equal margins.  White
    space is a welcomed friend, not an evil enemy. X-height and leading have their
    effect as well as the chosen face.  \r\nThere  is no formula.  You can use the
    classical scheme outlined above. You can also use a grid, dividing the page  into
    3 or 4 units wide and omitting  the leftmost unit. Mostly, you need to train your
    eye by experimenting.  This is always the better teacher than any formula. It
    takes longer at first but once you train your eyes, they pay dividends forever.\r\nAlso,
    grids don't have to be even, they can be geometric or arithmetic progressions
    as well.  See Karl Gerstner's \"Designing Programs.\"\r\n\r\nChrisL"

  body: "Tiffany, the equations are simple, basic analytic geometry (though I had
    to take a look at a math book to remember them). I'm also uploading two pdf files
    of a layout I'm working on, I've used Villard's diagram as the starting point
    of my grid.\r\n\r\nIf by any chance you have access to a copy of M\xFCller-Brockmann's
    Grid Systems in Graphic Design you can apply Villard's diagram to his cover, it
    fits perfectly recquiring only some minor adjustments (though he never mentions
    using the diagram inside his book).\r\n\r\nTschichold dedicated a lot of his time
    to rediscover Villard's diagram, he was also a <em>persona non grata</em> between
    swiss designers (specially those responsible for the Neue Grafik magazine), I
    suppose this was one of the reasons M\xFCller-Brockmann didn't mention Tschichold's
    research, but this is only a speculation. Here you can read <a href=\"http://learning.north.londonmet.ac.uk/epoc/tschichd.htm\">an
    excerpt of Tschichold's book.</a>\r\n\r\nAs to dezcom's comment, I think it's
    really a matter of choice, I'm really addicted to precision, so I'd rather use
    a calculator and control every single unit of the page than to trust on my eyes
    only. Both approaches are valid. There's a nice discussion about these different
