  body: Upon furter review, it appears as though its something like Wordpress, but
    it's not ready to go yet. The best I could do was to [[http://openmelody.org/download-melody|join
    this mailing list]] to be notified when it launches? I'm old. The [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infobahn|infobahn]]
    still confuses me.
