body: I was pleased to find that some nice .ttf commercial fonts I have bought for
  PC seem to work fine on the Mac. Is there any reason I shouldn't be doing this?
  I'm guessing they work because of the Intel processor switch?

    is an easy way to find the keystroke combination for entering characters. FontExplorer
    X usually seems to have that info slot blank. Probably an editorial comment on
    the types of fonts I am often working with."

    free? There goes my Norton savings, except maybe for the huge chunk of memory
    Norton seemed to want. \r\n; )\r\n\r\nIt's just a little hard to believe there
    isn't an equivalent of the alt+0243 etc. system Windows uses and gives the info
    for in Character Map. I thought I remembered Mac people just left off the zero,
    or something like that. Wouldn't be the first time I didn't have my facts straight."

  body: "found this - \"press the Option key and enter four hex digits to specify
    the hex code of any glyph.\"\r\n\r\n>alt+0243 \r\n\r\nThat's a bit antiquated
    now - In Windows just type the Unicode number and hit ALT + X to get the character.
    Also works in reverse, highlight a character and hit ALT + X to convert it to
    Unicode number.   "

    from the Apple menu\r\nSelect International\r\nSelect the Input Menu tab\r\ncheck
    the Character Palette, Japanese Kana Palette, and Keyboard Viewer to ON\r\nCheck
    on Show input menu in menu bar\r\n\r\nThis will bring a flag icon into your menu
    bar set according to your local keyboard encoding. The palettes can now be selected
    from a menu under that flag. International preferences can also activate alternate
    keyboard encodings for other languages, if you want to.\r\n\r\nBe advised these
    palettes only work fully in Cocoa (OS X native) apps. They may cause problems
    in older Carbon applications, but if you have a fresh new Mac with fresh new software,
    you should not have many of those."

  body: I'm not sure what is meant by flag icon, but I did get it to show under edit/character
    palette (shortcut option, command +T) on Safari, and once opened, it can be used
    in Photoshop also, and can be minimized to the dock for when I want it. This is
    about as good of a solution as I could have hoped for, so I thank you!

    made a mess a lot of times."
