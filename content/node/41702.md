body: "I've been given the opportunity to do a logotype for an indoor entertainment
  complex.. The guy currently assigned the job has turned in a bunch of dreck and
  I can swoop in and steal the show/money.\r\n\r\nThe place has ski-ball, video games,
  lasertag, bumper cars, ball pits that smell of urine, putt-putt, hot dogs, pizza,
  and hundreds of screaming sticky children. So, I need something fun and festive,
  but not Curlz or, you know, anything else really awful. Oh yeah, and the place is
  called \"Grand Event,\" which implies something classy... ergh.\r\n\r\nI'm currently
  thinking House's Ed Roman, or perhaps some variation of Burbank. They have some
  class but are still \"kooky\" and \"fun.\" I'm hoping you guys will perhaps suggest
  something that comes at this from an angle I haven't really considered yet."

  body: House is great. Couldn't really recommend more. But I also use <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/search/?q=asphalt&x=0&y=0">Asphalt</a>
    and <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/search/?q=cafeteria&x=0&y=0">Cafeteria</a>
    as a sort of  "go to" combination when I need fun. If you adjust the baseline
    and rotation for the characters they get pretty whacky too.
