  body: 'It''s fun, I''m looking forward to seeing more. My only comment at this point
    is that the serifs at the end of the thin strokes on <strong>L</strong> and <strong>N</strong>
    look too insubstantial to balance the thick strokes. I don''t feel that way about
    the <strong>A</strong> and the <strong>V</strong>, maybe because the serifs have
    a little more heft, or maybe because the thin stroke isn''t quite as thin (and
    on the <strong>A</strong>, it gets thicker toward the serif). '

  body: You are right, the <strong>N</strong> looks fragile. I will give the serif
    some more heft. You gave me an idea for the <strong>L</strong> as well.
