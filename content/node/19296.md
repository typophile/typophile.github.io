  at LCC but only managed two weeks first time round and then two of the three years
  the second time of trying. I have a hot/cold relationship with type in terms of
  personal endeavours but consistent admiration for the discipline.\r\n\r\nSo hats
  of to those of you who are seasoned veterans, and looking at the forums there are
  many. Mainly i am asking for a little insite into individual and personal working
  strategies, motivational aids or any little things that go on inside your head which
  help keep things consistent.\r\n\r\nThe creative mind I find works when it wants
  to, often flashes of inspiration keep me occupied into the small hours when there
  is little to act as a distraction. When this subsides, I reach the end of a specific
  idea or things don't work out, finding the track again is a difficulty. There is
  no formula of course and i know to a large extent dedication is inherant but any
  elaboration would be interesting.\r\n\r\ntier."

    I've ever found to keep things on track, moving, and to completion is a client

    is that You have a clear idea of what the font is for. :)"

  body: "My biggest problem is thinking of a new design possibility for a face before
    the one I am working on is finished. This year alone, I am working on 8 different
    faces in various stages of completion.  It isn't that I am stuck and don't know
    what to do. I just can't stop myself from starting a new project when the new
    idea strikes.  I find I just have to get at least some basic characters down in
    the new font or I just can't sleep. I have one face that could be done in 2 days
    but have been putting it off to work on the italic for a face I did 4 months ago.

    ever know why I do anything, aside from scratching itches as such but they all
    seem so big and itchy but only need the smallest of scratches. The example above
    I can relate to because the 'why?' is the outcome and that purely beyond reasoning
    with words."

    etiquete. Credit is owed in full to Zipora Fried who's work I admire greatly.
    The link was included to illustrate something for which I have an affinity but
    as yet no abbility to execute.\r\n\r\nwww.minusspace.com/fried/fried.html\r\n\r\nMuch
    of the work is very good, Hartmut B\xF6hm specifically, whom karl gerstner showed
    fairly early support for; www.minusspace.com/index.html#artists\r\n\r\nSo yes,
    it is this stoic drive I search for. Before the summer is out I aim to have finished
    one of the many projects that currently lay dormant and will be sure on completion
    to post an image or two for which credit/ shame can rightfully fall to me."
