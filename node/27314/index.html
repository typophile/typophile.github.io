  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>We have to typeset a book where the designer specified the font Warnock Pro (light) for the text. The book has a bibliography, and of course, in a bibliography where there are multiple books written by a single author, the second, third, etc. entries start with a dash three ems long (a three-em-dash) instead of repeating the author’s name.</p>
<p>There is no threeemdash in Warnock Pro (light). And the emdash itself has sidebearings, so setting three dashes in a row also doesn’t work. Nor were multiple dashes kerned in the foundry font.</p>
<p>OK, In FontLab 5, I can make a threeemdash and a twoemdash for the font, so named, with no Unicode index (I take U2015 to be something else).</p>
<p>Then go into the features file and add:</p>
<p>sub emdash emdash emdash by threeemdash;
sub emdash emdash by twoemdash;</p>
<p>right after the f_j ligature.</p>
<p>Did this, recompiled, and went to the Preview panel:</p>
<p>Everything appears fine, all the other ligatures still work, and three emdashes in a row give the “threeemdash” character.</p>
<p>BUT: the ligaturing doesn’t work in InDesign, either through using the three em dashes via the Glyph pallet, or by typing three Alt_shift_hyphens (where there is no intervening code). I can add the glyph directly via the glyph pallet of course, but that is a lot of work – first erase the existing dashes, then insert the “threemdash,” for every such entry in the bibliography.</p>
<p>There should be a way to take the existing three emdashes in the supplied MS Word file &amp; wind up with a threeemdash in the InDesign file, right?</p>
<p>I’m pretty sure this is due to some complexities in Warnock Pro, since we’ve gotten this ligaturing feature (multiple em dashes to a single long dash) to work in fonts we’ve created from scratch.</p>
<p>Anybody know what’s going on?</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Charles</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t have a whole lot of time to open up FontLab right now and try and come up with a more dependable answer, so here are just a couple of quick thoughts:</p>
<p>(a) In my experience, problems such as these are often due to silly little mistakes that are difficult to catch exactly because they&rsquo;re so minor. For instance, have you checked that the new glyph you created has exatcly the same name as the one you&rsquo;re using in the ligature substitution code?</p>
<p>(b) If you decide that you&rsquo;ve already spent too much time trying to solve the problem in FontLab, why not just set the whole book in InDesign, then run find/change and have the program replace all occurrences of three consecutive dashes with your new m-dash? I imagine you&rsquo;ve had this idea before &ndash; what&rsquo;s stopping you from using it?</p>

		<div class="commentbody">As Eric, Miguel and Thomas have pointed out, this is simple to address in InDesign. I have to use 3-em dashes all the time for setting bibliographies, so I&rsquo;ve just built a character style that I load into each new book project (with negative tracking built into it). From there I quickly run a find/replace for every instance of 3 em-dashes and the sidebearings problem is solved, without having to muck with the font. (In particular I&rsquo;m not big on de- and re-compiling a font with as many OT features built into it as Warnock; I&rsquo;m just not experienced enough with FL to know for sure that I&rsquo;m not simply introducing errors in the process).</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Thanks to all. We decided to put in the new three-em-dash via search and replace in InDesign tagged text files, then bring them back into InDesign. When we later make the XML files, we&rsquo;ll change he threeemdash back to three em dashes. There were various reasons for not using the other approaches.</p>
<p>Jason, I share your instincts, but I had to go into this font anyway, because in the text, there were about 850 instances of special characters for what the publisher calls &ldquo;Sanskrit&rdquo; &ndash; actually, Sanscrit as rendered with the Latin alphabet with diacritics &ndash; all Unicode characters, but not included in most fonts.</p>
