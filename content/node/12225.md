body: "<strong>[[Indices]]: [[Tools]]: [[Type Design Tools]] : Ikarus</strong>\r\n\r\nIkarus,
  by Peter Karow and others of [[URW]], is one of the most important historical font
  formats and font editing tools. In its heyday, it was the primary tool foundries
  used to digitize their libraries of metal and photo type. Today, [[Dutch Type Library]]
  offers <a href=\"http://www.fontmaster.nl/english/IkarusMaster.html\">IkarusMaster</a>
  as part of their [[FontMaster]] suite of tools.\r\n\r\nIkarus had many technical
  strengths, including [[Interpolation]], very high resolution, and a spline primitive
  edited using on-curve points, unlike the Beziers popular today, which also depend
  on off-curve control points.\r\n"
