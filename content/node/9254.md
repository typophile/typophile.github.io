body: I know I&#39;ve seen this font before. It looks like the bottom portion is perspective
  distorted. Any ideas what the font is? Thanks in advance. <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/65349.jpg"

  body: Thanks guys. I knew I had seen it before. I used to have that font on my previous
    computer for some reason I didn&#39;t transfer it over... now I know where to
    pick it up.
