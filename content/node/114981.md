body: "I really like all the typefaces used here, particularly the \"Bourbon\" font.
  It's similar to ITC Franklin Gothic Demi but with a slightly roughened treatment.
  Could be a custom job but does anyone know of anything similar? Bonus if you can
  identify the others!\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Bourbon-Barrel-2011-3-TTB_5632.jpg]"

    for the smaller O just use a smaller font size for that letter.\r\nDon"

    Cheap Pine, but Veneer and Anodyne have the straight leg R to match the image.
    The curved strokes of B, O, and R are more squared than the image. \r\nDon"

    at all to me. And actually, they are not: ''BOURBON'' is most probably [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/trade-gothic|Trade
    Gothic]] Bold #2 and ''barrel STOUT'' is [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/emigre/matrix-ii-ot|Matrix
    II]] Italic. Never been a great fan of Suzana Licko''s design BTW.'

  body: "Thanks Ryuk. Amazing, that the awkward odd duck of \"barrel STOUT\" is actually
    a font. I share your opinion of Suzana Licko's designing, certainly where this
    font is concerned.\r\nDon"

  body: "In my opinion the fonts shown in the image are not old fonts, but rather
    are modern designs, which may or may not be digital fonts. No problem with the
    sans-serif for BOURBON as mentioned in my earlier posts.\r\nBut \"barrel STOUT\"
    is a real Frankenstein.\r\nNotice the differences between these letters and classic
    italics like Garamond http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/paratype/original-garamond-bt/
    and Fleischman  http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/bitstream/fleischman-bt-pro/.\r\nThe
    truncated ascenders, the almost vertical slope, the strange tail at the top of
    b, etc. What's this with a ball serif capital S? And how did square serifs from
    Egyptian end up on the T and U? This is not to say that someone has not packaged
    this mish mash as a font. \r\nSo if the Frankenfont does not turn up you could
    make reasonable facsimile of \"barrel\" by editing Fleishman. Other candidates
    for editing include Verdigris MVB Pro Text http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/mvbfonts/mbv-verdigris-pro/
    ITC Cushing  http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/itc/cushing/ and Kis http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/bitstream/kis/\r\nDon\r\n\r\n\r\n"
