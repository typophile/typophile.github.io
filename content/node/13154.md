  would allow me to print out our existing typeface library as well as print out additional
  fonts as they are purchased and added to our font server. The font management program
  we are using is Extensis Suitcase X1. Ideally, I\u2019d like to be able to print
  out customized sample pages, which would consist of basic 256 character alphabet
  for all type families and their members."
