  a harder subject than for instance monospace, slab serif and old style.\r\n\r\nThis
  is what I got..and well it tends to be too general.. ---\r\n\r\nThe alphabet is
  by its very nature dependent on and defined by conventions. Type design that is
  not bound by convention is like a private language: both lack the ability to communicate.
  Yet it is precisely the constraints of the alphabet which inspire many designers.\r\n\r\n--
  But I do like this typeface that I found to illustrate it --\r\n\r\nAn experimental
  typeface:\r\nMiniscule by Thomas Huot-Marchand, a French postgraduate student of
  type-design who investigates the limits of legibility while physically reducing
  the basic forms of the alphabet. Minuscule is his project of size-specific typography.\r\nMinuscule
  characteristics are large x-height, robust slab serifs, vertical stress, open structure,
  big counters, low contrast..\r\n\r\n-- Maybe you know something else to say? --\r\n\r\nxo\r\n"

    of understanding how anything less subtle than Keedy Sans or Dead History can
    be experimental. The truth is that, aside from the most servile revivals, there\u2019s
    some degree of experimentation in all type design."

    a little too big for it..

  body: "The term \"experimental\" seems to be a post facto pigeon hole description
    imposed by critics/historians/academics who don't have a more fitting slot to
    typecast the object in. If you are writing an academic paper, you need to qualify
    your research in a more specific manner. You may use your example above and focus
    on legibility issues. There is a huge dataset published on that alone. If you
    are doing something more arty and less rigorous, you might look at types beginning
    to break the mould of the status quo at the time. Herbert Bayer's Univversal or
    Van Doesburg's work might be an area that is fruitful from the early modernist
    period.--The unicase attempts of Bradbury Thompson and others as well. Even the
    1980s ITC excess of x-height period is a more specific instance. There is always
    the overexamined Grunge period and the Carsonogenic excesses that followed him.\r\n\r\nChrisL"

  body: "Certainly the term \"experimental\" is one of the most abused in the field
    of type. But Miniscule is a great choice, because it shows that something that
    seems too experimental can actually work great. And I think this is because it
    originates from the mind not of a posturing artist, but an old-school scientist,
    the great Emile Javal.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "All typefaces, except the most unimaginative rip-offs and revivals, are experimental,
    because the type design process is one of \"let's see if this glyph shape works
    with the other ones\". So the designer experiments with applying variations of
    thematic qualities  like stress, contrast, weight, spacing, serifs, and curve
    shapes to individual glyphs, and seeing how they look--first in the metrics window,
    then in sample documents in various media. Next step is to go back and refine
    things to work better en masse. It's the feedback loop that's a part of so much
    creative production.\r\n\r\nBut I think what is loosely meant by experimental
    design is that which is unusual enough to draw attention to itself, rather than
    being part of a seamless whole where only the message is apparent, not the means
    by which it is delivered.\r\n\r\nRecently \"experimental\" has been updated (rebranded?
    obselesced?) in the concept of Critical Design, so perhaps you could approach
    your topic by looking to see how a typeface could be an example of critical design,
    which carries more intellectual clout."

  body: "> All typefaces ...\r\n\r\nYes, and that's why the term shouldn't be used
    that way! It's best used when the design is deployed to some extent and then <em>tested</em>,
    somehow (not necessarily in some laboratory), using readers. Not just glared at
    by the designer (and his buddies).\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    also become a term with pedantic connotations. I see the same ideas rehashed over
    and over and labeled experimental. They\u2019re usually images from workshops
    or school projects. Sculptural letters, found letters, Sagmeisteresque letters
    made of string, counterless letters, modular letters, and code-generated letters
    are all commonly labeled experimental. But there\u2019s a great deal of sameness
    to them; most of the variety comes from the raw materials or camera angles. It
    seems to me that experimental is often used in the same sense as school science
    lab experiments: the outcomes are predetermined and the purpose is hands-on education
    rather than innovation. "

  body: Experimental doesn't necessarily refer to the aesthetic properties of it.
    It could be in reference to people doing new things with OpenType programming;
    it could be projects like what Letterror has done messing with font format technology;
    it could be free fonts that the priesthood of us designers look down on, where
    every letter is a pot leaf or a cat. You can interpret the notion of "experimental"
    a number of ways, but I would definitely agree with James P. -- keep away from
    the Keedy Sans interpretation of what "experimental" means.
