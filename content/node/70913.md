body: "Hey everyone,\r\n\r\nI recently started to create a serif with the \"e\" as
  the very first letter\r\nand fell in love with the break in the upper bow.\r\nThis
  became the main idea of the type.\r\n\r\nStarting up with the lower cases (still
  not all finished) it's all a big\r\nbuilding site but I think it's worth it.\r\n\r\nI
  would really appreciate critics on my first steps on copy types\r\nand with a little
  help from you, I would like to push it further!\r\n\r\nCan't wait for your input,\r\n\r\nArtur\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/typo_1-01_5641.png]"

  body: 'I really enjoy the texture of the body and the idea is unique. I may play
    with the /a/ and the /o/ as they take on an akward texture at some sizes. There''s
    a font I''m working on that has similar serifs that I''ve been trying to work
    the kinks out of. I can post some images of those when I''m back on my desktop.   '

  body: "thanks for your reply inkxel! I'm also a bit unhappy with the lower kurve
    of the /a/,\r\nthink that it gets a bit too dark there. Do you think the /o/ is
    too big?\r\nI'm also unhappy with the slanted bowl of the /d/. Somehow it works
    for /b/ and\r\n/p/, but /d/ looks strange in that case?!\r\nOh, please post your
    font, I'd like to have a look on it!"

  body: "Artur,\r\n\r\nI noticed the ascender of f has 'kinks'. I would like to recommend
    using the RMX tools harmonizer.\r\nAlso to my eye, k is to wide. \r\n\r\nThe inner
    and outer contours of 'h' have different behaviors(curvature) in the shoulder."
