body: '<b>Background</b>   <BR>   <BR>Gematria is something of a mix between a grotesque
  and a humanist sans.   <BR>I wanted a sans serif less funky than Helvetica, but
  with more character   <BR>than the recent super generic sans like Myriad. It&#39;s
  also a reaction   <BR>against the trend towards increasing x-height and counter-sizes.
  The   <BR>ascenders and descenders are large and in charge, close to the elegant   <BR>proportions
  of Futura. The counters are dimished, recalling the time   <BR>before readability
  trumped character. The intersections of lines are   <BR>heavy, trapping be damned,
  increasing contrast not only between but   <BR>within glyphs.   <BR>   <BR><b>Status</b>   <BR>   <BR>I&#39;ve
  just wrapped up the basic upper case. I&#39;m mostly satisfied with the   <BR>structure
  of all the characters. Work still remains to weight some   <BR>characters properly
  &#40;see: g, all the triangular upper case&#41;. Spacing is   <BR>messy. Right now
  it&#39;s probably too closely set, but this is my fifth   <BR>complete iteration
  on the lower case metrics. I&#39;m having a tough time   <BR>finding the right looseness
  to make it easy to pick out words quickly &#40;I   <BR>haven&#39;t lost all sight
  of readability&#41; while maintaining a pleasant page   <BR>texture. I&#39;m also
  unsure of the right balance between spacing wide for   <BR>caption sizes and narrow
  for display sizes. Opentype to the rescue?   <BR>   <BR><b>Specific Concerns</b>   <BR>   <BR>How
  can I make the g fit in more? It feels out of sorts. If I make the   <BR>strokes
  thicker, it fits in a bit better but feels very clotted.   <BR>   <BR>I was much
  more confident in the f when I first started this design.   <BR>Should I ditch it?   <BR>   <BR>Is
  there a standard solution to the too many vertical strokes problem in   <BR>words
  like &#39;million&#39;? The sequence illi feels very dark compared to the   <BR>rest
  of the page.   <BR>   <BR>What do ya&#39;ll think of the y? The triangular characters
  have always   <BR>bugged me and y seems like a triangular shape that doesn&#39;t
  have to be   <BR>so.   <BR>   <BR><b>Phantom Modulation</b> - <a href="http://www.typophile.com/cgibin/show.pl?4100/8716">see
  thread</a>   <BR>   <BR>I ended up compensating for this effect and the results
  are much more   <BR>pleasing. I&#39;d been building the less geometrical characters
  &#40;a, h, n, m,   <BR>s, t, r, u, y&#41; with the compensation automatically since
  I had to   <BR>eyeball the strokes to make sure they felt balanced. When I compensated   <BR>in
  the more symmetrical structured characters, they felt more in tune   <BR>with the
  rest of the set.   <BR>   <BR>I found it better in my case to leave the counters
  of characters &#40;b, c,   <BR>d, e, g, o, p, q&#41; perfectly symmetrical with
  no slant and to instead   <BR>compensate for the phantom modulation with their outer
  path. This helped   <BR>me avoid too much humanist feel from creeping into the design
  and made   <BR>the characters feel like they stand mostly upright.   <BR>   <BR><a

  body: There are some nice things happening in this design. <BR> <BR>I don&#39;t
    have a problem with the g, but I&#39;d be a little concerned about the space between
    the bowls closing up at small sizes. <BR> <BR>At first the f struck me as too
    unusual for an otherwise conservative face, but I don&#39;t find that it draws
    too much attention to itself in text. Try living with it a bit longer, but give
    some thought to an alternative, less radical form. <BR> <BR>I don&#39;t mind the
    top part of the y, and think it is a good idea to try something other than the
    diagonal version. However, the bottom part looks truncated and also adds to the
    impression that the top part is too wide &#40;it may, in fact, be a tad too wide
    compared to the h, n, etc.&#41;. Is there a way to extend the descending curve
    to the left, without getting into the kind of closed-up shaped of the Helvetica
    g? <BR> <BR>Regarding the sequence of i and l, you could try having very slightly
    wider sidebearings on the i. You can also try making the ascending stems slightly
    lighter than those that terminate at the x-height; because of their length, they
    will tend to look denser than the shorter strokes. I have not printed your PDF,
    so I am taking your word for it that the sequence <i>illi</i> looks dark.

  body: '&#62; large and in charge <BR> <BR>That sounds nice. <BR> <BR>&#62; recalling
    the time before readability trumped character. <BR> <BR>Legibility. Readability
    actually benefits from a smaller [than average] x-height. <BR> <BR>&#62; The intersections
    of lines are heavy, trapping be damned <BR> <BR>Actually, that&#39;s &#34;optical
    compensation&#34; &#40;in my book&#41; - trapping is [mostly] to fight gain. But
    anyway, this is an approach that might have hidden functionality &#40;as well
    as easthetic appeal to some&#41;, since information comes from contrast. <BR>
    <BR>&#62; I&#39;m also unsure of the right balance between spacing wide for caption
    sizes and narrow for display sizes. <BR> <BR>That&#39;s related to the <i>intent</i>
    of the face, which ties in to things like color, width, x-height etc. In this
    case I would say this is a texty font - and the spacing is <i>slightly</i> too
    loose ovreall &#40;and inconsistent in places, like the right of the &#34;r&#34;,
    and elsewhere&#41;. <BR> <BR>BTW, your vertical proportions are right on. <BR>
    <BR>And the caps are solid - congrats. <BR> <BR>&#62; the g <BR> <BR>It&#39;s
    out of place because it&#39;s too humanist. Give it some edge - and maybe an open
    bottom bowl. <BR> <BR>The &#34;f&#34; is fine! I think the &#34;j&#34; could be
    more humanist. I like the &#34;y&#34; too. <BR> <BR>Overall, I think you&#39;re
    meeting your objective, and producing an interesting voice: at once retro and
    futuristic, plus a nice balance between rationality and charm. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>'
