  body: U+20A8 is the Indian rupeeh abbreviation, which is indeed <em>Rs</em>. I think
    there is some confusion because many years ago Adobe included the Indonesian rupiah
    abbreviation <em>Rp</em> in their expert set fonts. The rupiah sign is not encoded
    as such in Unicode, most likely because Indonesians simply use the letters <em>R</em>
    and <em>p.</em> In their OT fonts, Adobe use a Private Use Area codepoint for
    the rupia (U+F6DD). My guess is that the Monotype folk who worked on Palatino
    Linotype were familiar with the <em>Rp</em> glyph from Adobe expert set fonts,
    and thought this was the rupeeh sign.

    in the expert set data that came over from Linotype and the guys decided to map
    it to 20A8. \r\n\r\n"

  body: "Here's [[David Lemon]]'s own words about the presence of this glyph in Adobe's
    fonts:\r\n\r\nBack in the ancient days of Type 1 fonts, Adobe defined a basic
    character set for Latin. Since Type 1 fonts were limited to one-bye encodings,
    we soon decided we needed a supplemental set to hold the kinds of glyphs needed
    for more advanced typography. We set about building a list for what was to become
    the Expert set.\r\n\r\nMany pieces were obvious: small capitals, oldstyle figures,
    additional f ligatures, superior & inferior figures, more dashes, and the \"French\"
    alphabetic superiors. We looked around, and noticed that this set, combined with
    the base set, was very similar to the set URW was producing for ITC fonts at that
    point. There were just two additional currency characters in the ITC set: the
    colon and rupiah.\r\n\r\nAdobe hadn't learned much about the Latin market outside
    Europe and North America yet. We decided that if ITC was including these currency
    characters, there was probably a good reason, and we might as well meet the ITC
    \"standard\". So we added them in the Expert set.\r\n\r\nYears later, when I mentioned
    this to Cynthia Hollandsworth (now Cynthia Batty), she suggested that the colon
    and rupiah got into the ITC set via Agfa, which had some large corporate clients
    doing business in those regions. The derivation of character sets is always intriguing,
    and full of odds bits of legacy!\r\n\r\n- thanks,\r\n  David L"

    - all of whom are now owned by Monotype (except Adobe) so we've come full circle!
    Didn't Jim Wasco work for all of these companies? Maybe he's to blame? ;-)

  body: "<em>.... six years without completion !!</em> :-)\r\n\r\n\r\nGreetings to
    you all.\r\n\r\n[[http://id.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rupiah | Rp]] is the currency of
    Indonesia. Its history indeed is derived from the  Indian Rupee which of mentioning
    -- reasonably suspected -- to have been combined with the mention of Arabs so
    that being \"rupiah\" (name) and \"Rp\" (symbol) and also \"IDR\" (international
    code)\r\n\r\nThe placement \"Rp\" at different codepoint on some fonts has confusing
    of course. While we see that Unicode still leaves some \"empty slots\" (U+20BA
    ... U+20CF). So in my humble opinion, it makes more sense if \"Rp\" should be
    moving to one of these codepoint. We wait from Unicode, Adobe, Microsoft or anyone
    authorized to handle this.\r\n\r\nAnd more importantly (related the standard codepage)
    I think this is the moment to arrange the codepoint of all the existing currencies.\r\n\r\nBest
    Regards."

  body: "<cite>I\u2019d rather go for initials: USD for dollar, EUR for euro \u2026</cite>\r\n\r\nThese
    are two parts of the brain. The technical abbreviations you mention are just the
    poor modern banker\u2019s workaround to circumvent his disability of handling
    $, \xA3, \u20AC and the like on his devices. These *typographical* abbreviations,
    on the other hand, have been born out of the scribal need (of former centuries)
    to speed up the merchant\u2019s everyday recording pensum by replacing \u201CLibra\u201D
    by \xA3 \u2013 and getting faster. But not every currency inherited it\u2019s
    own typographical symbol.\r\n\r\nHowever, signs like \xA3 and $ have gained symbolic
    meaning over the time. So that it became desirable for emerging currencies/states
    to furnish their own monetary unit with a special typographical glyph \u2013 both
    as an abbreviation in text *and* a brand-like symbol. Therefore we have seen quite
    a lot enterprises to establish new signs of such kind recently: Armenia, Azerbaidschan,
    Russia, India; not to mention many [[http://www.signographie.de/cms/front_content.php?idart=238|local
    currency initiatives]] which also embark on creating a captivating sign for their
    own money.\r\n\r\nI wondered about the Rp./.Rs issue for years. Thank you all
    for enlightening me.\r\n"

  body: Andreas, the standardisation of <em>unique</em> currency codes is not just
    a technical workaround for instability in correctly displaying currency symbols,
    it is also necessary because some currencies do not have well established written
    symbols and some different currencies use the same written symbol. Many currencies
    use the $ sign, for instance, and not only for dollars, but also pesos and other
    currencies. These need to be differentiated in financial transactions; hence AUD,
    BBD, BSD, CAD, FJD, HKD, JMD, LRD, NIO, SGD, TOP, USD, WST, etc.
