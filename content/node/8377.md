  body: Hi Tobias, I think you have some winning aesthetic/functional combinations
    going here. I really like the low ascenders/descender &#40;example lc.g&#41;.
    I do not really use this type of font in any of my own work, but I can see great
    potential for it in the current market.

  body: i love it, it&#39;s very fresh. I think some slightly lighter weights would
    be even more useful and could make a really nice family.

  body: This has a nice feeling and promise, but to me there are real problems of
    consistency, and the crossbars of the a and e are main problems.  <BR> <BR>You
    have a general monoweight effect, and the joins of the branches and one part of
    the bowls are thick. But the crossbar on a and e are much thinner. You can go
    for more of a two weight sans like Franklin, or change those crossbars. Gill is
    generally monoweight with the two weight effect on the aeg, so you can get away
    with it, but not with it so extreme, I think. Also the descender on the g to me
    looks painfully cut off, and the bottom of the t weak.

  body: 'I think this is very nice - makes me think of Yellow and Fontana having a
    kid. <BR>It&#39;s cohesive, original, legible. And some of the glyphs are very
    charming. <BR> <BR>William&#39;s point about the &#34;a&#34; and &#34;e&#34; crossbars
    is valid on a formal level, but I <BR>happen to think your approach can be a valid
    solution sometimes, including here. <BR> <BR>The most obvious issues to me: <BR>-
    The dots of the &#34;i&#34;/&#34;j&#34; extend too far up &#40;especially in #2&#41;.
    <BR>- The bar of the &#34;L&#34; is too heavy &#40;although less in the #2&#41;.
    <BR>- The &#34;4&#34; is too wide. <BR>- The &#34;&amp;&#34; is too playful &#40;and
    too dark in the #2&#41;. <BR> <BR>There are also some smaller things &#40;like
    the &#34;E&#34; being maybe slightly too wide&#41; but those are iffy. <BR> <BR>Spacing:
    a bit too loose. <BR> <BR>Great stuff overall! <BR> <BR>hhp'

  body: "I\xB4ve made some adjustments and added a lighter weight on this one, making
    the weight gain logarithmic. The strong cut-offs on p and d had to go to make
    the light weight work. Some spacing is still to be done on the lighter weight.
    This is my first face, so please comment!\r\nhttp://www.kvant.org/zai.pdf"

  body: "I agree with Hrant about the #4. I do however disagree with you Hrant about
    the dots of the i and j...I think they should go a bit higher. They'll start to
    blend together at smaller point sizes or at a distance.\r\n\r\nThe ampersand too
    playful? The face seems pretty playful to me already. (Might be right about it
    being too bold though.)\r\n\r\nThe crossbars of the \"a\" and \"e\" don't bug
    me too much. The crossbar of the \"a\" reminds me of Edward Johnston's Foundation
    Hand, don't know if that was an inspiration or not. \r\n\r\nAll in all Toby, I
    think its very nice, very polished, congratulations!"

  body: "Terry, I think you're starting to see everything as a signage face...  :-)\r\n\r\nI
    agree that simply <strong>lowering</strong> the dots of the \"i\"/\"j\" would
    make things worse. But that's not necessarily what I'd change: I might make the
    dots flatter; and/or I might actually reduce the height of the stems - the Grid
    should be a tool, not a straightjacket. And after all, what is raising the dots
    further if not breaking the grid too? The reason not to raise them further (or
    even keep them so high) is potential line-to-line bumping (on shorter measures).\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    \ :-)\"\r\n\r\nWell, that's certainly a concern. :) I think you should keep your
    old lowercase g and just extend the hook a little. I also prefer your original
    \"y\". Hrant, don't you think the dots can be at least a little higher than cap
    height?"

  body: "Cap height, sure, since I think: cap height should (generally) be lower than
    ascender height; and the dots can be as high as the ascender height (depending
    on the design). But not higher than the ascender height - that's just asking for
    trouble.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "Thanks. This is primarily ment to be a headline face, thus the heaviness.
    \r\nMost of the inspiration just came from my head, I wanted a handmade look,
    and maybe I subconsciously drew some inspiration from Gill\xB4s bolder stuff.\r\nAbout
    the dots: I just looked at Frere Jones\xB4Interstate Ultra Black, where the dots
    extend some above ascender hight. So I\xB4m thinking, if he can do it, so can
    I...\r\nAbout the g and y: I kinda like the old ones better too, in a way, but
    they seem to distract the eye too much, especially in smaller sizes, I\xB4m not
    sure. More thoughts on that appreciated. I\xB4m thinking about making an even
    bolder version now. Tried extrapolating and it looked pretty cool."

  body: "If a font is <strong>so</strong> display-oriented that you're likely to set
    only one line in it, or be afforded the luxury of tweaking consecutive-line bumps
    manually, then I guess it's OK. But pretty much by definition a font is meant
    for setting text, text is rarely one line, and most users won't know/want to tweak
    stuff.\r\n\r\nAnd remember: everybody makes mistakes, and there's never a single
    Answer anyway.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
