body: "I watched \"The American\" yesterday. And the subtle yet superb opening titles
  caught my eye. Can anyone identify the font they used there? Also I searched for
  the agency, who made the title design, but no luck. they are not listed in the credits.
  Any idea?\r\n\r\nnote: the font in the titles is NOT the same as for the movie poster.\r\n\r\n"

    but is not. Could be a custom logo. Did the rest of the titles use this type?

  body: yes. all the titles in the credits are the same font. the rolling credits
    at the end are set in the same font as well.

  body: "I learned that [[http://www.hingston.net/|Tom Hingston]] is responsible for
    the titles. I tried to get in touch with him, to learn about the font, but he
    never got back to me...\r\nthe font he uses on his website looks quite similar
    to the font i'm looking for."

    hopped on the computer to see if anyone knew the font from the opening sequence.
    Looks like you were on the same quest."
