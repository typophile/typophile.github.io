    helping some people out in the critique forums when my name suddenly broke onto
    the list. The change in user habits over xmas altered the fabric of reality at
    Typophile. From there it was a matter of chasing after Chris and Stewf. I got
    stuck into the Typowiki too.\r\n\r\nHappy 2008. It's just amazing how fair people

  body: "chuffed  adj generally happy with life. You can also get away with saying
    you are \"unchuffed\" or \"dischuffed\" if something gets your back up. Make sure
    you only use this word in the correct tense and familiarise yourself with the
    meaning of the word \"chuff\" too.\r\n\r\nfor more see [[http://english2american.com/dictionary/c.html|here]]"
