body: "Hey folks,\r\n\r\nLooking to pick some brains on thoughts and choices for typefaces
  in the editorial environment. I don't post often here but have enjoyed other discussions
  in the past, so hoping to gather some opinions here.\r\n\r\nI am currently redesigning
  a magazine. It is a monthly, full colour news print (printed tabloid format, around
  60gsm, 64-72pp). Content wise, I'll keep it brief/nonspecific, but mainly features
  (interviews) and reviews across a wide cultural spectrum that includes music, art,
  film, theatre, comedy, lifestyle and even much more. Focus is on the cutting edge
  and local events. There is also a fairly large listings section.\r\n\r\nCurrently
  the typeface of choice is Neuzeit for everything (Headlines, body, footnotes, standfirsts
  etc) along with a tiny amount of Eagle (black for section tabs, light for pullquotes).
  I am a big fan of the classic grotesque faces such as Akzidenz and Neuzeit. But
  it is time for a change and address some practical issues. The main issue is space
  \u2013 I am often cramming content in, and having to reduce the body text tracking
  when typesetting, despite writers sticking to our current word counts. I know \u2013
  change the word counts, but I'd rather not for various reasons. \r\n\r\nWhat I am
  looking for is a sans serif typeface that will work well in it's condensed form.
  I recently used Univers condensed for a publication and it worked well at a small
  format (A5) but I find it 'too much' (i.e. not as easy on the eye) in large amounts.
  Okay, that may then apply to any condensed face, but a recent discovery of Bauer
  Neue (http://lineto.com/The+Fonts/Font+Categories/Text+Fonts/Brauer+Neue/) has been
  much to my liking, although it is pretty expensive. I like the slightly quirky character
  whilst retaining a certain formal, 'old school' grotesque demeanour. It also works
  well for both body and headlines (some may argue against body, but I think it works).
  Having stated my preferences, I am willing to consider a lot of things, even serif
  faces. \r\n\r\nA final point to the considerations is that I may look at using two
  families \u2013 one typeface for features (where there is generally more room) and
  another for reviews, which must be condensed to help with frequent space issues.
  In which case, I am not sure whether to keep Neuzeit and find another, complimentary
  typeface. Eagle will go completely.\r\n\r\nI appreciate your time on this.. and
  now your thoughts please!"

  body: "Sans + Condensed = Unreadable.  :-(\r\n\r\nFor one thing, saving space doesn't
    have to come from choosing\r\na condensed design; mostly it comes from a large
    apparent size:\r\nif you have a font that's large on the body you can simply set\r\nit
    smaller; one thing that does is economize with every line,\r\nwith no \"cancellation
    of savings\" as when you hit a paragraph\r\nbreak with a condensed font.\r\n\r\nAs
    for sans: you can get away with a sans (especially a highly\r\nreadable one like
    Legato) for a fair amount of text, but I think\r\nmaking the reading experience
    suffer for fashion is anti-design.\r\nIf you choose a \"slanted slab\" (AKA \"sheared
    wedge\") serif font\r\nyou might end up with something modern with great readability.\r\n\r\nThis
    will all sound like a ploy to plug a font that\r\nI collaborated on, but: http://ernestinefont.com/\r\nIf
    you don't like that there are a number of other\r\ngood recent designs in that

  body: "Thanks guys,\r\nReducing the point size is not an option, it is already as
    small as it could possibly allow it to go at 7.5pt. I don't think sans + condensed
    always equals unreadable (the majority of the time maybe), one just has to be
    careful. I recall the old quote (can't remember from who) \"typography is a beautiful
    collection of letters, not a collection on beautiful letters\", so it is really
    what you do with the typeface that counts. I think a large x-height and small
    ascenders/descenders could be pretty key, so thanks Nick, Sense is a great recommendation
    that I didn't know of. Only aesthetic issue is that I am not keen on humanistic
    faces, which this is. I am quite attracted by Proxima Nova (http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/marksimonson/proxima-nova/),
    although I'd imagine the condensed faces are just too tight for any amount of
    body text, so Sense may win there \u2013 I like the idea of it being 'semi-condensed'.\r\n\r\nHrant,
    you are not wrong with the idea of a slab-serif number, the previous typeface
    for the magazine before I redesigned it last was Soho (http://www.linotype.com/3273/soho.html).
    Ernestine (which I have seen before) is lovely but not right for the job, and
    the characters are quite wide in regard to the space issue. Olsen would have been
    good though, just unfortunate in this case it would appear like a step back into
    the Soho era of the magazine! The irony, maybe grovelling back to Soho would solve
    my problems!\r\n\r\n"

    interesting about the different cuts of times. I had assumed there'd be little

    face structure at different sizes with other type faces - it certainly makes sense
    that the smaller sizes were wider. One often sees different fonts for display
    and body with good type families, but does such a feature exist for different
    fonts for different point sizes (don't know all the open type features if there's
    something in that)?"
