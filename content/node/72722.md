body: "Hi there my idea generating forum friends,\r\n\r\nI have a Physiotherapist
  who needs a logo for her upcoming website and business cards - starting to get more
  clients etc etc. After some brief discussion as to what the brand values / message
  should be, she wants simple, premium, friendly. It is based in a reasonably affluent
  town so the clientele would most likely be well-off (hence the premium aspect).
  \r\n\r\nMy worry is that it doesn't come across immediately as a 'Physiotherapist'
  but I was finding it hard to do this without resorting to glib, cliched hands, spines
  and muscle references, none of which really sum up physio. The curve of the 'A'
  is a subtle allusion to the spine but nothing more. \r\n\r\nThe attached is the
  final of a few ideas and the one I was most happy with as far as hitting the brief
  went. I'm sure it could be improved and bettered so please fire away! *straps flack
  jacket on*\r\n\r\nMany thanks\r\nChris"

  body: "Hi Chris\r\n\r\nI like the combined 'A' and 'P' design, looks really nice,
    and also like the subtlety of the idea of a curved spine. I don't think the logo
    necessarily needs to say 'physiotherapist' anyway - could work just aswell without
    doing. Not 100% on the type curving around it though - perhaps the design should
    be allowed to breathe without other elements distracting attention. Perhaps simply
    placing the type underneath?\r\n\r\nHope this is some help\r\n\r\nRach"

  body: "Hi Rachel,\r\n\r\nThanks for taking the time to comment. I know it was some
    time ago and I have only been working on it on and off but recently re-visited
    it on the request of the client wishing to incorporate a 'Alpine' mountain sort
    of aspect into the design. I was worried it would end up looking a bit glib so
    after some playing around with ideas, settled on a subtle use of negative space
    and strong shapes to give the suggestion of mountains/peaks. I also put the words
    underneath as you suggested. \r\n\r\nI think it needs Physiotherapy in it or it's
    not clear what it is for! \r\n\r\nAnyway, if you or anyone else reads this, I'd
    be happy to hear responses.\r\n\r\nThanks\r\nChris\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/AP_just_A_3705.jpg]"

  body: "I think...this logo is just wrong in a lot of ways.\r\n\r\nit's too large
    to be used effectively (particularly in contrast to text sizing.\r\nit feels cold
    and rather old, I don't know about everyone else, but I want my medical/alternative
    therapies businesses to be, welcoming, with a touch of energy and modernity.\r\n\r\n2c\r\n\r\nPaul"
