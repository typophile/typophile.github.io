body: I'm working on a magazine masthead and I'm using Futura. I'm using the word
  Trilby and the ascenders on the lowercase "L" and "B" rise above the capline and
  the capital "T". My clients wanted a straight line across the top edge of the magazine
  so instead of using all caps they wanted me to simply trim off the tops of the ascenders.
  I tend to think that this causes the "L" and the "B" to look stumpy and the stroke
  of the line looks thicker on these characters than the others. I like the elegance
  and friendly look of the ascenders. Okay designers, what do you think? Is it right
  to deconstruct this typeface arbitrarily? To trim or not to trim?

  body: 'My opinion: of course not to trim, or you''ll lose the balance with the descender
    of the lowercase y and will be forced to trim it also. I''d play with the uppercase,
    making it slightly bigger, until it reaches the height of the ascenders. Or doing
    exactly the opposite, changing the size of the lowercase... '
