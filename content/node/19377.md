  faces by [[manfred klein]] and apparently more designers.\r\nusually I'm very cautious
  of downloading free fonts because they are not always designed well. I'm not so
  familiar with klein's work or reputation, and i just wanted to ask out of curiosity,
  what do you think about the faces in this site:\r\nhttp://moorstation.org/typoasis/blackletter/index.htm\r\nare
  they well designed, what do you think about the designer etc.\r\nthanks\r\nYaron."

  body: for the most part i think they're quick and dirty revivals. most likely just
    autotraced with minimal cleanup. that said, there are some great faces there that
    you may be hard-pressed to find anyplace else.

    nowadys there are hype or at least called it \"renaissance\" of the \"broken \"one
    ;-) and manfred was one of those guys, giviing a sh\"\xA7 about zeitgeist, just
    having fun and helping the blackletter fonts to stay alive in digitalia, juts
    checkout also the \"progothics\"-guy ...\r\n\r\nactually have a look at http://www.fraktur-mon-amour.com/,
    inclunding manfed kleins revivals and other great blackletter \u2026 its german,
    doooh  but you get a cd with around 300 FREEfonts collect and/or made for the
    book  -  dont know this \"manfred\" guy, but i think he is cool \u2026\r\n\r\ncheers\r\ndaniel"

    has, by far, the most free fonts on the internet. Wading through it and finding
    what works for you could take a very long, long, time. And his commercial use

    he has just quickly finished some fonts off that were sitting around half-finished
    for years, kind of dusting out the cobwebs of his lifework. But some got his full
    attention, and when you come upon those, it is a joy."

    is such a great deal of information in the web about this.\r\n\r\nand in that
    note i have a question - is there a blackletter face suitable and readable for
    long texts? "

  body: "<em> is there a blackletter face suitable and readable for long texts?</em>\r\n\r\nNo,
    there is not, at least not in digital format. There are lots in metal, if you
    want to hand-set the long texts yourself ;-)\r\n\r\nOn a more serious note, the
    reason that there really aren't any suitable digital faces is because the historical
    designs that were digitized were mostly based off of their display cuts, and not
    their text cuts, because at the time of the digitization, the days of blackletter
    text were over. Sort of an unending eycle, I guess. I've spent some time off and
    on over the last two years trying to make a readable textura\u2014one optimized
    for text! But at the moment that is still sort of a pipe dream, because I am not
    a good type designer."

    but not immediately. Even something at this level would still be a long-term project."

    don't know how the hell those monks were reading those heavy texts under the light

    that were created to be shown big, but digitzed and shruck down very small without
    any correction is what is illegible and hard on the eyes.\r\n\r\nMy design has
    changed somewhat over time, however I have an old image buried on my website here:
