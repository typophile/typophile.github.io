body: "Greetings all, just wanted to let you know about my next documentary. No, it's
  not about Courier, or Comic Sans... (if I had a dollar for every time I've heard
  that in the past year). \r\n\r\nIt's about industrial design, and it's called <cite>Objectified.</cite>
  I just launched a site for it today:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.objectifiedfilm.com\r\n\r\nAnd
  here's the film logo by Michael C. Place of Build:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/objects_4531.jpg]\r\n\r\nEven
  though the film's not about type, I hope you all will still come see it when it's
  done!\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\n-Gary"

    design\"?\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    to self: come up with a good nickname.)\r\n\r\nHe's credited with it, but then
    he denied it a few years before he passed. \r\n\r\n"

    allowed to define your own nickname - it needs to be picked by \"the community\"
