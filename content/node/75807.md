    service in good condition, minor damage to the gravy boat...\r\n\r\nSeriously,
    thanks for the reply Hrant, looks like I was a bit previous with my 99p alarm
    anyway. I think there will be some Baseline copies going up at some point as well
    as Graphis, Gebrauchs Graphik, Eye and Print Magazines. We're in an \"everything
    must go\" kind of mood...\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\nSimon\r\n\r\n[[http://www.graphicshowroom.com
