    problem with it.\r\n\r\nAre there maybe some Duplicates since you have installed
    two styles again?\r\n\r\nClean the font caches also under the Tools menu in FXX.\r\n\r\nBest

    for me, I believe, is in between FEX and Keynote. I finally had to give up using
    FEX in this instance. I do still use FEX for all of my font management, except
    for system font management and Myriad Pro management. I''ve installed, through
    font book, Myriad Pro into my  user folder and have had no problems with Myriad
    Pro in Keynote since. '
