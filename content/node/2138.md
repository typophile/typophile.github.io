body: ' i&#39;m currently having some trouble with a font modification job where i&#39;m
  not even sure that the trouble is from my side. my job was to modify the regular
  and bold weights of stone sans for a local ad agency so that it would run identically
  on mac os and win nt. with help from a very dear friend i managed to get the encoding
  right so that the &#34;new&#34; font displays and prints identically on both systems.
  although i&#39;ve imported all metrics and bitmaps from the original stone sans
  including ascent and descent, their tests showed different values regarding the
  leading of the font. the bold weight for mac os seemed particularilly off but apperently
  only when tested in filemaker. the values were identical when tested in word 98.
  i modified and generated the font in fontographer 4.1.5 on a mac. <BR>i&#39;m curious
  to know whether anybody else has experienced problems like this and verify my assumption
  that this is a filemaker problem and not a problem with the font. possible solutions
  would be greatly appreciated. '

  body: ' OK, so i figured out, that using the adobe standard encoding solves the
    leading problem. but unfortunately this encoding causes a postscript error when
    i try to print the font. i can&#39;t find anything on this subject at macromedia&#39;s
    fontographer support, the fontographer manual, not even in stephen moye&#39;s
    fontographer book. any ideas how to solve this new problem? '

  body: ' Hello Simon, did you tryed to used the Macintosh encoding only. Check if
    you can convert to curves a sample of text with your font, sometimes some letters
    don&#39;t have the forms totally close and make some problems.  <BR> <BR>Good
    luck and tell us something how you resolve your problem.  <BR> <BR>Best regards
    Simon '

  body: ' mark, ricardo, thanks guys, <BR>i was afraid that i was never gonna get
    any feedback on the subject. nobody seems to have encountered this before. <BR>
    <BR>mark, <BR>i&#39;ve posted my problem on the fog usenet group, but so far no
    reply. but it seems to be a great resource as well. thanks for the hint! <BR>
    <BR>ricardo, <BR>i&#39;ve checked the font before with mac encoding and it worked
    just fine. i also checked for open paths - no problems. i even checked for stray
    points that might&#39;ve been located way above the ascender or way below the
    decender which could cause leading problems - didn&#39;t find any. <BR> <BR>i&#39;ve
    just received a short e-mail from the guy who&#39;s testing the fonts and it looks
    like setting the fog file to adobe encoding but generating it in original encoding
    solves all problems! i&#39;ll keep you posted  if this is really the end of my
    painstaking journey into cross platform font country. '
