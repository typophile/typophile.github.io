  Archer on Netflix, and she asked for the name of the style of the font in the opening
  credits. I said, \"well, it's a display font.\" To that she said, \"No, I mean,
  like, '60s spy font.'\" So there's the question: What exactly IS the name of that
  style (if there is one)?\r\n"

    would apply here.\r\n\r\nBroadly, display typeface is the classification. Freestyle
    or casual would be the subset. You could even argue that this particular font
    is in the comic book style.\r\n\r\nThe typeface is called Baveuse, and the Archer
    logo actually straightens/aligns all the letters on a single baseline\u2014the
    original angles each letter for a \u201Cbouncy\u201D effect:\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/typodermic/baveuse/\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Archer-Logo_6656.jpg]\r\n\r\nBaveuse
    roughly translates from the French as \u201Cslobbery\u201D (as in the dog from
    the Tom Hanks movie, Turner & Hooch)."

  body: "A few other characteristics are the fact that it\u2019s unicase, top-heavy,
    somewhat reverse-contrast, but mostly it has misaligned or \u201Ccut-out\u201D
    counters, a feature typical of the \u201Cbouncy\u201D typefaces of the sixties
    (of which the best know example is probably Ad Lib: http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/bitstream/ad-lib/)."

  body: "The genre of unstructured bouncy lettering that looks like it was cut from
    cardboard with an exacto knife, often with a straight or curved ruler, avoiding
    exact horizontal and vertical; perhaps originated with lettering by Saul Bass
    in the late 1950s, particularly for the Hitchcock movies.  Also Ed Benguiat.\r\nThe
    idea was to express jarring disorientation with a cool jazz rhythm.\r\nNo agreed
    name for the style and its variations. Various attempts such as \"Beatnik\" did
    not gain wide acceptance.\r\n\r\nDon"
