"Morris Sans released

Morris Sans, two of the weights
Designed by Dan Reynolds for Linotype GmbH.

From the Linotype website: Morris Sans™ is a newly revised and extended version of a small geometric family of typefaces originally produced by Morris Fuller Benton in 1930 for ATF. His initial design consisted of an alphabet of squared capital letters with a unique twist that characterized its appearance: corners with rounded exteriors and right-angle interiors. The types were intended for use in the fine print found on business cards, banking or financial forms, and contracts. But over the ensuing decades, this design became a popular element in all sorts of design environments, and several foundries revived the typeface in digital form. Since digital fonts are bicameral, with slots for both upper and lowercase letters, new cuts of the type opted filled the lowercase slots with small caps."

		<div class="commentbody">Dan, in that other thread you say that the caps look "right" when they're darker. Concerning this, I have a theory that larger things look aesthetically more appealing when darker. Or lighter, depending on your taste*... The point is they look boring at the "normal" weight, if you know what I mean.

* Which seems to be the case more often if you're a baby-boomer.

In the case of Morris Sans I was actually suspecting that the original weight in Bank Gothic determined the weight in the new fonts (but the lc would look too dark if it matched that weight). And maybe it's this familiarity with the original that makes the darker weight look "right".

Yes. Linotype had old Ikarus data for the caps of the medium weight, normal width font. I cleaned this up and used it. The rest of the letters that I drew for the Medium were designed to optically match these, so of course they are lighter than the caps themselves. 

The other five fonts in the family were designed this one. So, the Medium cap glyphs are more or less "historic," and everything else is bult to harmonize around them. So I guess we agree! The caps had to maintain their weight. If the non-cap glyphs were any darker, they'd be too happy.

In an ideal face, designed for legibility, one would start with the lowercase letters, and then draw the capital letters.</div>

However, there are not that many suitable unicase fonts for them to choose from.

I meant heavy, of course. Me and my typos :( But this is just as good, actually.

I am being serious in writing that people often *think* they will accomplish everything they have in their plans. Of course, they never will. But no one wants to admit this to themselves, I think.</div>
