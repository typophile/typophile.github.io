  body: Indigo is quite impressive, especially on matte. You should ask your printer
    if they have any spot colours in stock for their Indigo. Because that might make
    the difference. Indigos can print white ink which might be really striking. But
    it wouldn't be worth it price-wise if they had to order in the spot colour just
    for your job.  Maybe print indigo cover and a few inserts and the rest laser?

  body: "Indigo is a digital printing machine, very offset-like in quality. Successive
    generations have been improving a lot. It\u2019s an ideal way to produce small
    runs.\r\n\r\nViz: http://h10088.www1.hp.com/cda/gap/display/main/index.jsp?zn=gap&cp=20000-13698-16021_4041_100\r\n\r\nIndigo
    uses paper that has been chemically optimized for it. As it is a lot of paper
    companies offer different qualities, so there is a wide range of stock available
    (at least that is the case in the Netherlands).\r\n\r\nThe latest generations
    of Indigo\u2019s can print white with a special formula. Depending on the design
    and stock several runs are needed to get decent coverage.\r\n\r\nhttp://whattheythink.com/news/44305-hp-expands-with-first-ever-white-ink-digital-sheet-fed/"

  body: Definitely Indigo is much better than laser printing. It's almost as good
    as high quality offset print. And it doesn't suffer from ink spread. As tmac pointed
    out, it is very good in matte paper.

  body: I have found on Indigo prints there is a yellow haze (four color) in some
    instances and some color shift. Don't know how to quantify it, it just seems to
    exist to my eye. Also I have seen splotchy printing on solids (that was three
    years ago and I do not know if they have corrected it but I have been hesitant
    to try again). Overall it is quite nice and it does allow, at least with my printer,
    each piece to be personalized (I have never tried this though).

    although perhaps it's been improved over the years. But when I'm designing a piece
    that'll be printed that way I try to avoid large areas of solid color."

  body: "> splotchy printing on solids\r\n\r\nWe've been placing quite a lot of our
    work recently on Indigo machines. Many pieces use areas of flood colour and have
    yet come across this problem. I know that on older digital presses flat colour,
    especially blues/pure cyan, banded horribly. \r\n\r\nGive the printer a sample
    of your work I'm sure they will send you a free proof off the machines.\r\n\r\nMartin"
