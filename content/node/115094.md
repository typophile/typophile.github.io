  body: "Thought I recognized this, but haven't found it yet. It has to be a font
    designed before August 1977, the release date of the LP. \r\nFor WILSON the high
    blocky terminal S and parallel O fit Anzeigen Grotesk http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/anzeigen-grotesk-lt/
    \ available since 1943, and Impact http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/mti/impact/ available
    since 1965 but the letters are wider. It would have been easy for the photolettering
    company to make it wider, as this was a common practice. But perhaps someone recognizes
    this as a letters from an unmodified old font.\r\nThe smaller thin letters, seem
    to be from a different font. Note the O has rounded not parallel  sides.\r\nBTW
    a contemporary digital font with a fairly good fit is Gusto Black http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/bagraphics/gusto/\r\nDon\r\n"
