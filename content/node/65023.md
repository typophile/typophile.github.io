    IKEA site]] .\r\nNeither is using Verdana.\r\n\r\nI have to say, the german website
    looks a lot better though. Verdana is great web type.\r\n\r\nSv."

  body: "Wow. Disappointing. With all the 'hullabaloo' about this verdana stuff, I
    sided with Ikea. Sure, verdana is not a great type for print, but it works, right?
    Besides, its risky and taboo.. cutting edge! And while it grates some people the
    wrong way...  \"watch the needle!\" I said. \"This change will help Ikea's bottom
    line!\"\r\n\r\nNow they veer from the game plan.\r\n\r\nI feel betrayed. I think
    I'll sit on the floor today in protest.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.evanmade.com\"
