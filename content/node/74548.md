body: Which of the many Garamond fonts out there right now is closest to the original
  fonts cut by Claude Garamond? It seems to me that Garamond Premier Pro (especially
  the Light Display) is the garamondiest, but I've heard some praise for Stempel Garamond
  among others.

    is \"garamondiest\"?\r\n\r\nYou may want to have a look at the specimen section
    at the end of [[http://www.atypi.org/eventfiles/StPetersburg_Ahrens_OpticalSizes_paper.pdf|the
    paper for my presentation in St Petersburg]] and decide for yourself.\r\n\r\nI
    am pretty sure you can't get more faithful than Garamond Premier \u2013 all sizes
    are equally faithful because each is true to a certain size of Garamond's original.\r\n\r\nStempel
    Garamond is great but it's certainly not the most faithful."
