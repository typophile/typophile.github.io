    go with your personal \"gut feeling\" when designing fonts.\r\n\r\nNothing is
    ever really \"wrong\".\r\n\r\nNever be afraid to break the rules when the design
    warrants it.\r\n\r\nThe \"quirkiness\" of your overall design and the \"art nouveau\"-\"art
    deco\" aspects work effectively throughout the font design.\r\n\r\nAs an example,
    the lower cross bar in glyphs such as \"E\", \"F\", \"H\" and \"4\" harmonize
    well with similar aspects in top-to-bottom proportions of \"B\", \"R\" and \"8\",
    and certainly  are mimicked well in your solution for the \"f\"and \"t\". In addition,
    the narrow and wide body proportions further enhance the visual effects. Well
    done.\r\n\r\nThe overall design works. I also like the name of the font.\r\n\r\nGood

    A few comments:\r\n\r\n- the f looks silly. Nick is quite right. I'm not sure
    I've ever seen a professional typeface, other than a script or hand-lettered style,
    in which the crossbar of the f and the t were at different heights.\r\n\r\n- some
    of the transitions from rounded to straight lines, such as the shoulder of the
    n, are a little too abrupt\r\n\r\n- where round shapes meet straight lines, such
    as in abdpq, you need some optical compensation by thinning the curved part where
    it comes in to meet the straight. It's not as bad a problem as it would be in
    a heavier weight, but it still needs a hint of thinning.\r\n\r\n- the sidebearings
    of the A should presumably be the same as the V. But in any case, the round sidebearings
    could all be a little less, and those of letters like AVTX could all be a lot
    less.\r\n\r\n- there's no kerning. This is a good thing given that the spacing
    isn't done. But more browsers are supporting kerning now, and you need it in a
    geometric sans like this for the typeface to be done.\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\nT"
