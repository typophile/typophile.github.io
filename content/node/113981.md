  but I don't know the name of the font on the jerseys. I've taken a picture, and
  you should be able to see it [[http://postimg.org/image/j6fhsh8y7/|here]]. Please
  let me know if that picture doesn't work or if there's any other information I could
  provide. Many help for any assistance you're able to offer.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nArtie"
