    but that has no lowercase characters."

    I took another pic with the double barrel name in it. \r\n\r\nThe two (k's) are
    irregular, I would of thought that the first is the actual true letter-form, and
    the second is modified?\r\n\r\nWho ever nails this one knows there stuff!\r\n\r\nThanks
    for your input Ricardo.\r\n\r\n\r\nLuey\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Image054_6431.jpg]"

    in 1995. There is also a second font called ArtD\xE9cor European, the only difference
    between the two fonts are the Z and the 7. Be sure to read the README.GIF before
    you use the font.\r\nYou can find the fonts on the link below:\r\nhttp://www.masterstech-home.com/The_library/Font_Samples/Font_Indices/A.html\r\n"
