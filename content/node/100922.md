body: "Good afternoon fellow folks of fonts,\r\nThe company I work for is going to
  purchase a new printer for my department (Design Department). We are currently using
  a Recoh C8111... we'd like something as good or better. It's a Laser Toner, maximum
  size is 12x18 (via bypass tray). Any recommendations/experience to be shared?"

  body: Some of the higher-priced Xerox Phaser models are used in design offices and
    do an excellent job. I believe the Phaser 7800 (around $4,000) is specifically
    recommended by Xerox for graphic artists, but they also have some lower-priced
    models.
