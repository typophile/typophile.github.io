  body: "Just for comparison, have a look at <a href=\"http://www.emigre.com/dp/getfontpage.php?PChoSlR.html\"
    target=\"new\">Emigr\xE9 Cholla Slab</a>. The counter shapes are not the same,
    but stylistically, it seems to me that they have a lot of similarity. (I was coming
    back to see how close Cholla Slab was, in case that was the answer.)\r\n\r\n-
