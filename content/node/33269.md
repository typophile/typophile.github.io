body: "Hello Typophiles,\r\n\r\nI've been working on a new typeface for quite a while
  now and have decided to use it as an excercise to learn a bit about OpenType fonts.
  I've added an alternative 'a' to the font as well as a set of ligatures. When I
  view the font in Illustrator or Indesign the font appears at the bottom of the menu
  instead of at the top. Is there something i'm doing wrong when exporting?\r\n\r\nMany
  thanks!\r\n\r\nDave Lawless"

    always struggling to fix it. I though what you could do is 'fake' it as a Greek
    code page. And that might fool it. \r\n\r\n"

  body: "I believe it's not a Mac problem, because sometimes my fonts show up at the
    bottom of the list as well. And I'm on Windows, most of the time.\r\nBut it's
    quite random, sometimes it also sits in alphabetical order, like it should."

  body: "I'm not sure this is really a bug. Some programs choose to separate some
    fonts on the basis of their encoding. You may notice other strange things, like
    Mac OS guessing at the encoding of your font and getting it wrong and so giving
    you an unexpected preview. When I preview mine, I often find that it chooses to
    show me the Cyrillic instead of the Latin.\r\n\r\nIf that's the case as well,
    then it's an encoding issue. If you include a proper codepage, it should recognize
    it correctly and maybe also put it back in the right place in the menu.\r\n\r\nHowever,
    I've also noticed other problems when I include extra codepages, such as the encoding
    getting completely mangled and most of the characters missing. I'm not sure where
    the problem is there, but I think it might be with Fontlab (or my settings)."

    this thread</a>.\r\n\r\nAn interesting question: Is it a hack to flag the Greek
    codepage if the font does not contain any Greek glyph? After all, it addresses
    a bug in ATM.&nbsp;&nbsp;;-)"
