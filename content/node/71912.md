    fractions as \"space.frac\".\r\n\r\nInteger followed by fractions in the manuscript
    is typed \"number-space-number-slash-number\", and the code distinguishes between
    integers (followed by space) and numerators and denominators (separated by slash).\r\n\r\nSo
    a style sheet can be applied globally to a block of text (recipes, say), and there
    is no need to laboriously select out each fraction.\r\n\r\nHowever, after the
    integers and fractions are sorted out automatically, the space remains, so replacing
    it with a thin space does the trick. In fact, it is better visually than butting
    fractions right up to integers, because the sidebearings on the numerator are
    so small. Of course, one could add positive kerning between integers and numerators,
    but this code makes that unnecessary."

      to watch for:\r\n1) Having an OpenType substitution that exchanges a glyph that
      has one Unicode for a glyph that has a different one is Very Bad Form Indeed.\r\n2)
      It's a Good Idea to use glyph naming conventions such that glyphs which have
      a Unicode codepoint are named in ways that reflect it, and glyphs which should
      \"boil down\" to a given Unicode codepoint, do so. See http://www.adobe.com/devnet/opentype/archives/glyph.html
      and especially http://www.adobe.com/devnet/opentype/archives/glyph.html#6 for
      details.\r\n\r\n<cite>In this instance, if one searches for, say, \"15 15/16\"

      thinspace.</cite>\r\n\r\nThis can happen in at least some routes of PDF creation,
      yes. It's a violation of the first principle above.\r\n\r\n<cite>Furthermore,
      if one copies the text, and sets it in a font which doesn't support Unicode
      thinspace, there will be a \".notdef\" in the middle of the number.</cite>\r\n\r\nTrue,
      though it's a weaker objection. After all, that can happen any time one has
      a character not supported by a given font. In some environments (MS Word, web
      browsing) one will usually get \"fallback\" to a font that has the desired character,
      although that of course will be a different font than the rest of the text.
      Whether or not that's a problem can vary.\r\n\r\n<cite>Thomas, John, did I get

  body: "Type designers and typesetters sometimes have a different viewpoint. I see
    about 300 manuscripts a year. Been that way for about 30 years. The number of
    ways people type fractions after numbers varies. For manuscripts coming from publishers
    anyway, we almost never see a space between a number and a fraction. Usually they
    use a code around the fraction, rarely a hyphen. Sometimes just the general instruction.\r\n\r\nThe
    moral is, any typesetter worth their name (never mind those of us claiming to
    be compositors) has to look and resolve things. If you want to put in a thin space,
    fine. \r\n\r\nJust don't count on a word space being in the file.\r\n\r\nThe space
    I put in between a fraction and a full-size number is a kern. Define a class that
    has all the numerators. Another class that has all the numbers -- lining and oldstyle.
    Kern the classes. One of the few class kerns I use. If you set the left sidebearing
    of the numerators about the same, this works fine. As far as that goes, the same
    (more of less constant left sidebearing) is needed if you use a thinspace. Kern
    numerators and denominators with each other and with the fraction character. All
    this takes about an hour. The kern values between the numerators are very good
    candidates for your kerns with the superscript numbers, by the way. Depends on
    how you set things up.\r\n\r\nIf you want precomposed fractions, Unicode allows
    for the half and quarters in the Latin Supplement (00A0 range), then in U+2153
    through U+215E, there are codepoints for the thirds, fifths, sixths, and eighths."

  body: "@ charles\r\n\r\nSimplified, the space (or any other character except from
    the slash) indicates the begin of the fraction in Tal\u2019s feature file (if
    a figure is following). If there is no other character between two figures in
    front of a slash, both figures will be substituted by numerators. We are talking
    about the character, by which the space shall be substituted.\r\n\r\nBy the way,
    the indicator doesn\u2019t have to be a slash. Maybe it is better to substitute
    a class, that contains all characters except from the figures, the numerators
    and the slash, by a space.frac. A whole keyword could be substituted instead \u2013
    2frac1/2, where frac is the keyword. (But in this case Tal\u2019s code could be
    probably shortened.)"

    Scholarly book publishing -- which oddly enough, includes a fair number of cookbooks
    -- is perhaps a small segment of the \"manuscripts\" out there. I don't know how
    magazines work, or for that matter, commercial book publishers.\r\n\r\nWhat I
    am saying is it is not OK for typographers to say \"I don't care how people do
    it,\" my way is best. You will be ignored by both authors and editors.\r\n\r\nFor
    anyone, if you handle a lot of manuscripts, I'd advise doing some pre-processing
    in a text editor (or in InDesign, if your up to the scripting). That way, if you
    need a space to trip the fraction feature, you put it in. If the space gets in
    the way, as with our practice, you take it out.\r\n\r\nFor some things, the type
    designer's only recourse, and only obligation, is a readme file that tells people

  body: Hello Nick and Charles, I don't think that you disagree. It doesn't matter
    how text indicates fractions as long as it does indicate them. Code around fractions,
    which Charles mentions, is as fine as a preceding space. The typographer may use
    GREP to convert what he gets into what he needs, be it InDesign markup (for applying
    a character style with frac feature enabled to fractions only, or for a script
    to add kerning between number and fraction), be it a preceding space which allows
    Tal-style frac features to care for the space, or yet another approach.
