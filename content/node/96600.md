  body: "Not sure if it was the first, but certainly pioneering in terms of randomisation,
    [[http://www.letterror.com/foundry/beowolf/|Beowolf]]. I also love the anecdotal
    note about spelling.\r\n\r\nBoth Erik van Blokland and Just van Rossum have made
    a number of pioneering contributions to type engineering, production and design,
    including Superpolator, TTX and Robofab. They also maintain a wonderfully lo-fi
    website."

  body: "Arnold Pannartz and Konrad Sweinheim, who introduced typography to Italy.\r\nMainz,
    the birthplace of printing, where they worked, had become a war zone in 1462,
    causing a diaspora of printers. Three years later they published the \uFB01rst
    printed book in Italy. Who knows what hardships they faced during those three
    years?\r\nQuite apart from getting their gear across the Alps (or rebuilding it
    from scratch), they had to change the look of type to suit their new clientelle.
    \r\nWhile Gutenberg had been a technical pioneer, he mimicked the scribes. \r\nSweynheim
    & Pannartz made the \uFB01rst humanist/Roman typefaces, not just copying the local
    writing style in Italy, but creating a new hybrid form for the new medium that,
    re\uFB01ned by Jenson shortly afterwards, became the model we use to this day.\r\nHere
    are S&P\u2019s types of 1465 and 1467, showing the change they made.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/SandP_4803.png]"
