    Web use is often a pain, that would tend to lead me to consider them first.\r\n\r\nNot
    that I blame font suppliers; it is easier to steal a Web font than it is to steal
    a font from the printed page. If copy protection didn't hurt legitimate users
    as much as it often tends to do, it would be a good thing, not a bad one."

    have released some fonts specifically for the web, but mostly these appear to
    just be print typeface hinted for the screen. This probably works fine for some
    typefaces, but what I'm looking for are classic serif typefaces that have been
    created specifically for the screen (like some of Carters fonts). \r\n\r\nDo such

    or the Beta Fonts?  If the Beta Fonts, under what OS/Browser? Keep in mind that
    the Beta fonts are not yet hinted, Kerned, etc. The final version will be iKerned,
    converted to TTF outlines and TTFAutohinted (v0.93) for better rendering under
    Windows.\r\n\r\nAlso, in the testing page they are set using the default \"line-height\"
    for technical reasons, set to 1 em, but in the real world usually its 1.5 em or
    customized to each designer preference."

  body: "From the user perspective, having to buy 2 or 3 separate licenses (one for
    web, one for print, another one for apps) is ridiculous. Plus, in 95% of cases
    is the same font re-packed (Except Hoefler, Webtype and a few others exceptions
    that truly make fine-tunned customized and reworked version for the web.). And
    Users are starting to notice that... as Moseph  suggested \"these appear to just
    be print typeface hinted for the screen\".\r\n\r\nI love Global (http://theglobalfont.com/)
    from Dino Dos Santos approach, is super simple. Just 1 license covering all the
    stuff.\r\n<blockquote>\r\n\"Global is a hard-working sans typeface that eliminates
    the licensing boundaries between the screen and the paper, therefore it can be
    used and embedded both for the web and mobile applications, because it\u2019s
    provided, not just in OpenType\u2122, but also in EOT, WOFF and TTF formats, all
    in a single, unlimited, license. Available at DSType.\"\r\n\r\nCan I use the fonts
    in devices and/or mobile apps?\r\n    Yes. No special license is required to use
    the fonts in electronic books and applications for mobile devices.\r\n\r\nCan
    I embed the fonts in PDF files?\r\n    Yes. The embedding of fonts in PDF documents
    is allowed as long you make sure that you set embedding to prevent the extraction
    of the fonts.\r\n\r\nCan I use the fonts in the web?\r\n    The license permits
    web usage of Global font, so we will provide you with an installable \"DSType_Global_Kit\"
    version of the fonts for use on the web (EOT, WOFF, SVG and TTF), so you can choose
    the format you prefer. You can also use PostScript flavored fonts when needed,
    for improved screen render when desired.\r\n\r\nCan I host the fonts on my server?\r\n
    \   Yes you can! \r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\nBut... you know... selling 3 licenses
    instead of just 1 is much more profitable I guess.\r\nSadly, I don't think other
    foundries will follow Dino's example."

  body: "Thanks for all the replies to this,  great input!\r\n\r\nAs I'm digging into
    this further, it appears just hinting for screen might be enough when dealing
    with sans. But when looking for the \"next Georgia\" I'm pretty sure it's going
    to have to be built specifically for the screen,  just like those Impallari typefaces
    (thanks for those links Pablo!). \r\n\r\nThat comment on licensing reminded me
    of some older threads I've been reading recently on the topic of free fonts, I
    appreciated the viewpoint voiced by someone (Nick Shinn I think). Who said that
    companies should be making thier money by innovating not just by reformatting
    \ their old typefaces to new formats (re-buying a typeface as a webfont is much
    akin to re-buying your Betamax movies on VHS). A way to combat this in the world
    of type would be to have a set of openly available source outlines for classic
    faces that can be reformatted and innovated upon by anyone whenever new media
    comes along. Then people can pay for any meaningful innovation that actually occurs.
    All of this is to say I'm <em>very</em> interested to see the Libre set of typefaces
    Impallari is building! (though it appears they are also generously doing a lot
    of innovation too, quite worth donating for).\r\n\r\n-Moe"
