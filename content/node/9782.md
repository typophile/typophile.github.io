    target="_blank">Page 3 of Part 12</a> &#40;Childish Lettering&#41; of the Script
    Font ID Guide.   <BR> <BR>It was a David Rakowski font, which can sometimes be
    found on shareware/freeware sites, and was also sold by Intecsas.

  body: There is bound to be some confusion with names, especially with &#39;shareware/freeware&#39;
    fonts. David Rakowski digitized a lot of old type designs and re-named them. In
    turn, other folks may have re-named his fonts.  <BR> <BR>This is the name used
    in the 1995 Precision Type Font Reference Guide for the Intecsas font, but I wouldn&#39;t
    bet much that it is the original name.
