body: "I need to find some good, versatile fonts that are \"clean & a bit quirky\"
  without being silly or too far in any one direction...   So far I think Archer &
  Museo  *(not Museo Sans) fit the bill...\r\n\r\nAnyone have other suggestions that
  have similar qualities to Museo or Archer?  \r\n\r\nAlso;  what's up with Museo
  not having italics?  I could really use them...  Are they coming?  Is there another
  font that could masquerade as Museo italics?  (thought about vista sans italics
  for a second...)\r\n\r\n "
