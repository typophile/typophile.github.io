body: I have access to 24" and 36" Epson inkjet printers that I can use for printing
  school stuff and I am running into problems with paper. Specifically, these printers
  are generally used for printing massive photos, posters, and banners, and the official
  papers  are pretty thick (but not stiff enough to be useful) and coated on one side,
  which is problematic for items that need to fold up or be double-sided. Does anyone
  know of a double-sided paper I can use in a large format inkjet, preferably available
  in rolls? Second, I often run double-weight bristol through smaller Epson inkjets
  with no trouble at all; has anyone done this in a large-format printer?

    colored?), but there certainly are two-sided, inkjet-coated papers available in
    rolls.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.inkjetart.com/wc/hahnemuhle/PhotoRag.html\">Hahnemuhle
    PhotoRag Duo </a> is one.  That link has lots of other papers as well.\r\n\r\nAs
    for your question about running heavy paper -- most large-format printers are
    <em>better</em> at this than smaller-format.  So if you've had success so far,
    you shouldn't have any trouble with the larger printers.\r\n\r\n--John"

  body: "Can't you ask the person/company that owns those printers for different types
    of paper? Such rolls of paper usually cost something like 300 to 400 euros or
    more (about 400 to 500 USD). At least the paper-types we used in a printing company
    I worked at a couple of years ago.\r\n\r\nI do know from experience, that printing
    double-sided on such printers, can be quite problematic, because they are not
    very precise. You might find it difficult to get both sides aligned. How thick
    the paper can be, differs from printer to printer."

  body: 'We''ve actually had a long-running discussion about running different papers
    through large-format printers on the Book-Arts list lately: the general consensus
    is that almost anything up to 140 lbs works well.  I''ve been using a lot of 80
    lb Strathmore Aquarelle II to edition a book on my little SPR300 and it works
    great.'
