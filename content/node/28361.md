  body: "The A matches Pretorian (the original name for Serials 'Pretoria'), but that's
    about all that does. I think this is a version of DeVinne Ornamented, similar
    to <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/urw/devinne/d-regular/charmap.html\">this
    one from URW</a>. We once ID'd a similar font that might have had swash letters.
