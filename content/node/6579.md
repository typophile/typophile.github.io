  body: C&#39;mon guys help this person please, if you can. I looked on My Fonts and
    Identifont and didn&#39;t find anyting similar to those 3 samples. And the sans
    serif has a pretty unusual &#34;a&#34;. I&#39;m curious.

    unless that font is a takeoff on something else.'

    and Solo&#39;s Condensed Alphabets &#40;p.81&#41;. <BR>I haven&#39;t found it

    target=_top>obviously</a> is not the same one.

    been able to find them using online bookfinding services. <a href="http://dogbert.abebooks.com/servlet/SearchResults?imagefield.x=37&amp;cm_re=A&#42;Search+Box&#42;Form&amp;tn=Homage+to+the+Alphabet&amp;imagefield.y=12"

  body: Heidi, you asked &#39;is there a good specimen book?&#39; and the best answer
    is the Font Book from FontShop International. Mine is so used it&#39;s starting
    to fall apart. I heard a rumor that a new edition will be out soon. I hope it&#39;s
    true. <BR> <BR>The Phil&#39;s Photo book is a good one for older styles, but remember
    that those are film types, and although many of them may also have digital versions,
    not all of them do. <BR> <BR>If you can still get the Precision Type  Font Reference
    Guide, it&#39;s a good value. I also like that it shows the complete fonts in
    all the weights. The Font Book samples are sometimes incomplete when trying to
    see the other weights than the main one used for each face. <BR> <BR>My list of
    my own font book collection is shown on my <a href="http://bowfinprintworks.com/ListPages/FontBookList.html"
    target="_blank">Typographic References</a> page.
