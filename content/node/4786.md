body: I am doing another logo for a sleep testing company. The icon illustrates a
  girl asleep and laying against the moon. Her hair is wrapped around the moon to
  become the blanket when it comes back around. The logo is due Monday &#40;I haven&#39;t
  had much time&#41; so I can&#39;t do any major changes such as starting from scratch.
  Any suggestions would be appreciated. <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/35987.gif"
  alt=""> <BR> <BR>Also I have included my first idea for a logo. I went with the
  above idea because I felt the logo below was too abstract and just not very good.  <BR>

  body: The icon is superb! But for some reason I find the the spacing of &#34;Services&#34;
    irritating in relation to the type &#34;Sleep Testing&#34; which I think is just
    fine.

  body: Tom I like your idea. Did you try it in small sizes? Does the illustration
    still read? TE combination in TESTING bothers me. Try crashing the E into the
    T.  <BR> <BR>On another note nice dimensional effect on the TC logo.

  body: Thanks for the compliments. I have changed the text because the client calls
    her company STS and this way the small caps bring that out. I worked on kerning
    in the text. Also below is the logo at 250 pixels. I think it still works well
    at small sizes.  <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/36032.gif"

  body: 'Nice stuff. <BR>I like the one with the face more, but I think it has the
    &#40;serious&#41; problem of being too complex. So maybe your face-less one would
    be better, except the crescent is too spiky: make it fatter and friendlier. <BR>
    <BR>As for the Trajan, I think it&#39;s way too &#34;haughty&#34; for the subject.
    Try something like Sauna, or Motter Corpus. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>'

  body: I think I will purchase Cronos Semibold Display for the font. What do you
    think?

  body: That sounds like a potentially good choice. But also check out its inspiration,
    Today Sans. <BR><a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/ef/today-sans/today-b-ef-medium/testdrive.html?s=Sleep%2BTesting%2BServices&amp;p=60"

  body: Not much difference. Is Cronos a knockoff? Which would you get-they are the
    same price?

  body: 'I would get Today because: <BR>1&#41; Cronos is close enough to it -without
    giving credit- that I&#39;d prefer rewarding the original. Some aspects of the
    derivation &#40;like the temporal naming&#41; are nothing short of enraging to
    me. <BR>2&#41; It&#39;s more interesting. <BR>3&#41; In some ways it&#39;s better-made
    &#40;like it has trapping&#41;. <BR> <BR>On the other hand, Cronos has more variants,
    including optical scaling. But if you only need one weight that&#39;s mostly moot.

  body: Tom...where do you get these great clients? <BR> <BR>;o&#41; <BR> <BR>Both
    nice. I actually prefer the more abstract one. I think it works well, and, well,
    I just prefer abstract ones, I guess.

  body: '&#62; I actually prefer the more abstract one <BR> <BR>It really depends
    on what she goes for. She is deciding on typeface and which icon to use too. I
    suspect she will go with the girl. She is the same client as Sleep Testing Solutions,
    a logo I did awhile back. I think she would dislike the abstract logo more than
    the other. Thank you for the compliment on the logos. My clients do rock.'
