  body: "Sorta...\r\n\r\n\\\\\\\\\\\r\n\r\nTag: 'sinf'\r\nFriendly name: Scientific
    Inferiors\r\nRegistered by: Microsoft/Adobe\r\n\r\nFunction: Replaces lining or
    oldstyle figures with inferior figures (smaller glyphs which sit lower than the
    standard baseline, primarily for chemical or mathematical notation). May also
    replace lowercase characters with alphabetic inferiors.\r\n\r\nExample: The application
    can use this feature to automatically access the inferior figures (more legible
    than scaled figures).\r\n\r\nRecommended implementation: The sinf table maps figures
    to the corresponding inferior forms (GSUB lookup type 1).\r\n\r\nApplication interface:
    For GIDs found in the sinf coverage table, the application passes a GID to the
    feature and gets back a new GID.\r\n\r\nUI suggestion: This feature should be
    off by default.\r\n\r\nScript/language sensitivity: Can apply to nearly any script.\r\n\r\nFeature
    interaction: This feature may be used in combination with other substitution (GSUB)
    features, whose results it may override.\r\n\r\n\\\\\\\\\\\r\n\r\nTag: 'subs'\r\n\r\nFriendly
    name: Subscript\r\n\r\nRegistered by: Microsoft/Adobe\r\n\r\nFunction: The \"subs\"
    feature may replace a default glyph with a subscript glyph, or it may combine
    a glyph substitution with positioning adjustments for proper placement.\r\n\r\nRecommended
    implementation: First, a single or contextual substitution lookup implements the
    subscript glyph (GSUB lookup type 1). Then, if the glyph needs repositioning,
    an application may apply a single adjustment, pair adjustment, or contextual adjustment
    positioning lookup to modify its position.\r\n\r\nApplication interface: For GIDs
    found in the subs coverage table, the application passes a GID to the feature
    and gets back a new GID. Note: This is a change of semantic value. Besides the
    original character codes, the application should store the code for the new character.\r\n\r\nUI
    suggestion: This feature should be off by default.\r\n\r\nScript/language sensitivity:
    Can apply to nearly any script.\r\n\r\nFeature interaction: This feature may be
    used in combination with other substitution (GSUB) features, whose results it
    may override."

    separate entities for those types which require both.

  body: 'The effect of either feature is dependent on the font in question. The original
    intent of the subs feature was for subscript glyphs sitting on the baseline. The
    sinf feature was added later for scientific subscripts that descend below the
    baseline. Now, I''ve yet to find any actual use for subscript glyphs that sit
    on the baseline: I''m not aware of any such typographic conventions. So I use
    the same set of glyphs for both features in my fonts.'

  body: "Quark 7 has a faux subscript in the basic styles panel, which just moves
    the ordinary glyph down, by default. The preferences can also be adjusted to change
    glyph size. This is a longstanding Quark feature. \r\n\r\nIn its OT menu, Quark
    7 doesn't support the sinf feature at the moment, but that will no doubt be fixed.\r\n\r\nAdobe
    Pro fonts don't include a subs feature.\r\n\r\nInDesign conflates sinf/subs in
    its OT menu.\r\n\r\nSo I think it makes sense for font developers to do as John
    does, and include both features in one's fonts, with identical content. And it
    also makes sense for application developers to do as Adobe does, and support both
    features, as some font developers only include one of the two features.\r\n\r\n<em>subscript
    glyphs sitting on the baseline.</em>\r\n\r\nIdeas above their station..."
