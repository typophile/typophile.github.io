  printer John Fass.\r\n\r\nIn 1954 he created a type specimen book for his Hammer
  Creek Press.  He printed his books on his tabletop Albion press in his one-room
  apartment at the Bronx YMCA.\r\n\r\nI am trying to identify the ornament in his
  1954 type specimen book which I call the \"jumping guy\" ornament.\r\n\r\nIf anyone
  can identify this ornament for me, I would certainly appreciate it. \r\n\r\nOr is
  that jumping guy a cut?  If so, never mind.\r\n\r\nI am having trouble attaching
  a file to this message, so I loaded an image of this type-specimen page here:\r\nhttp://www.yourantiques.com/JumpingOrnament.jpg\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\n\r\nLee
