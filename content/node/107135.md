  body: Good catch Nick, I think I've accidentally turned the feature off while typesetting
    it. I'd love to update my post but it seems not possible?

  body: This looks like a great update - loved the first version and this is a great
    improvement. Lots of features too man, well done. Looking forward to seeing the
    ligatures. And those extended characters look lush :)

  body: "Niche typeface and specimen, but \u2026 what is that lower case \xDF doing
    in the word DECIBEL? A word in lower case would be more appropriate to show how
    \xDF matches the lower case letters. Also note that \u2018Afrikaan\u2019 is correctly
    written as \u2018Afrikaans\u2019. Some of the round letterforms in the italic
    seem to tilt more than the others. \u2018c\u2019 looks all right, but \u2018o\u2019
    tilts too kick I think."

  body: Ooh, love the true italics addition. Do agree with Abert Jan that the axis
    on some of the letters is a bit too heavy, some of the letters look as if they
    are rotated a few degrees too much. Other than that I do like the addition a lot!

  body: Very nice. I remember using Quicksand for a big event years ago. The typeface
    was quite nice but the spacing was very bad. I think I just applied optical kerning
    to fix that. It's nice to see an update where the kerning has been fixed and a
    lot of features added. LU could be kerned tighter though. Same goes for HE in
    the non-unicase SWATCHES.
