  body: "Grunge type is probably going to look dated to kids who are in high school
    now. It has the feel of a big marketing firm trying to reach out to the kids with
    that rock and roll stuff, very much like the anti-drug campaigns produced by the
    US Government in the 1980s.\r\n\r\nYour photo piece works well conceptually. It
    would be very easy to botch the job by using photos in a way that reinforces the
    associated negative ideas in a shameful way, and I think you\u2019ve done a good
    job of not going there. I also like the oddly clean but slightly burred edges
    that you used. I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s intentional or if these haven\u2019t
    gone through production yet, but it\u2019s a great play on contemporary photomontage.
    The layout of the type works well, although a face with a little more personality
    might work better, right now it feels kind of commercial.\r\n\r\nIf I were you
    I would take these to a mall and swap kids food for crits."

  body: The problem is the idea is fundamentally stupid, which is probably not your
    fault. Like anti-smoking campaigns, this only provides fodder for kids to make
    fun of. If you have time and a willingness to fight, I'd go back to the people
    in charge and ask them to reconsider their concept, maybe more along the lines
    of something that asks kids to think about how they've been a bully, or what it
    felt like to be bullied.
