  it is *not* American Typewriter Condensed Bold, what else could it possibly be?
  The logotype represents the german Stiftung Warentest (http://www.test.de).\r\n\r\nAny
  help appreciated :)\r\n\r\nThanks in advance,\r\n\r\nVictor"

  body: "definitely not american typewriter.\r\nactually, this seems to be more special
    than it looks like. first off, i thought of some kind of bold condensed clarendon
    for the lowercase t has a classical appearance (chamfered top and upward ending).
    but the \"stiftung warentest\"-font has much less stroke contrast. \r\nmaybe,
    this one is a custom-built logo typeface. but let's hear other members' opinions.\r\n\r\n//

  body: "Thanks guys,\r\n\r\nit was neither American Typewriter nor Clarendon nor
    Glypha, I would now go for custom, too. Eventually I had to rebuild this in Illustrator
    paths.\r\nNevertheless, a big thank you for your effort :)\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\nVictor"
