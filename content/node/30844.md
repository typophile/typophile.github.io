  body: "What features of Akkurat are the ones that you want to find in a replacement?
    Any particular letterforms, or the width? For example, <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/?fuseaction=catalog.fontdetail&searchby=manufacturer&displayfontid=FF.11312.1.5\">FF
    Bau</a> has most of the same physical structure, but it is not as condensed. It
    is also $40/weight. Is that too high?\r\n\r\n - Mike Yanega"
