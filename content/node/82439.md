  there a source where I can look for precursors to digital type fonts, i.e. designed
  for Microsoft or Apple?  Specifically, I am looking for typeset that was similar
  to the digital versions of Sylfaen, Old Bookman and Constantia, but that was available
  to offset lithography typesetters in the early 1990's.  Can you help?\r\n\r\nThank

  body: "This is the information contained in the font files of Sylfaen and Constantia
    - As hrant has pointed out Bookman goes back way before into photo setting and
    before.\r\n\r\n\r\n Sylfaen was designed for Microsoft in 1998 by John Hudson
    and W. Ross Mills of Tiro Typeworks, and Geraldine Wade of Monotype Typography.
    Sylfaen is a Welsh word meaning \"foundation\"; an apt name since the font stemmed
    from research into the typographic requirements of many different scripts and
    languages.\r\nThis version of Sylfaen supports the WGL4.0 character set, for Pan-European
    language coverage. In addition to Latin, Greek and Cyrillic letterforms, the font
    contains the characters necessary for support of the Armenian and Georgian languages.\r\n\r\nConstantia

  body: "In the mid to late 1980s there was a lot of typesetting done by graphic designers
    who would print type using a laserprinter and then paste it up using wax or Spraymount.
    I still have fond memories of my nose hairs being glued together with Spraymount
    residue. There was also a growing amount of digital type available for desktop
    typesetting.\r\n\r\nBy 1992 Quark was the boss and there were plenty more digital
    fonts being put to use just like those in your sample. From the way the descender
    of the type awkwardly intersects the ruled line, to the wide letter spacing, to
    the horizontal compression, to the fonts used, to the boxy composition, everything
    in that sample looks more like laserprinting from Quark than typesetting from
    a type house. I can't see a professional photo-typesetter setting U/C and L/C
    Copperplate the way it's done in that top line. That kind of typography was flourishing
    in Quark though. In 1992 that work would have been done in Quark, then laserprinted
    and sent to an offset printer to have them shoot film and run on press. "

  body: By 1992, desktop publishing had net yet completely replaced typesetting from
    dedicated phototypesetting machines. I was still setting type on a Compugraphic
    8400 system, although less and less so. You might want to see if you can track
    down copies of Compugraphic, Varityper and Itek/Quadritek type catalogs of the
    time.

  body: I can confirm that neither Sylfaen nor Constantia were available in any form
    prior to 1998 and 2003, respectively, and were not publicly released until February
    2000 (Windows 2000) and November 2006 (Windows Vista and Office 2007). Neither
    design is based on pre-existing types, so any document featuring these designs
    that purports to be from before these dates is either fraudulent or erroneously
    dated.
