  myself trying to find this font, and I simply can't get there without your precious
  help.\r\nI've found 4 relatively similar types but they are not the one.\r\nSimply
  forget the big S which was designed apart.\r\nThanks in advance.\r\nPedro\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/logo_5441.jpg]"
