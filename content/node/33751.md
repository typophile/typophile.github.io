  Finland lost the ice hockey final this year, we'll try again in 2008. I believe
  the World Championchips are held in Finland in 2012, if you're here then, Linda,
  I'll buy you that beverage!"

    basically how the game is played domestically. Canadian hockey players are on
    their best behaviour when playing internationally, but at home the old joke is
    'We went to the fights last night and a hockey game broke out'."

    get a final score until the game was long over. What we saw was pretty encouraging
    for our side, but it's obviously your team were pretty exhausted (physically and
    mentally) after that game with Russia.\r\n\r\n(The worst part of the break-up
    of the Soviet Union is it ruined one of the great hockey chants of all time: \"da-da-Canada,

    Still one Canadian based team in the hunt, and I'm pretty sure a plurality, if
    not majority, of all teams are composed of Canadians.

    hockey is as relevant as army boots on a fish, is amazing to me. \r\n\r\nIt can
    only be that so many people have escaped the winters in MN, IL, etc. that they
    can support it. Go figure. Us So. Californians don't get it for the most part.
    Admittedly that 1980 Olympic game where the US underdogs somehow beat the Russians
    was certainly enjoyed here (more than it was in Russia, I'd wager)"
