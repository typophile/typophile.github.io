<div class="post-content e-content" itemprop=articleBody>Typophile is made possible through the generosity of sponsors and efforts of volunteers, including time invested by us at Punchcut. We squeak time in on Typophile as often as we can without compromising client commitments.
Typophile gets a lot of traffic. We're seeing about 200,000 unique visitors every month, with actual page "hits" coming in around 300,000 per day. Google likes us. 20,000 Typophile users are depending on us. So we don't take any site changes lightly.
On occasion we have to take the site down for maintenance upgrades. When we do, our general approach is to minimize downtime so that the community can keep moving, discussing and collaborating.
However, we can only test so much on our development server before pushing the release live to the public. There's no better test than unleashing thousands of simultaneous users (read as: ravenous type enthusiasts) on it. We really count on your goodwill during those times to pull together as a community to help us identify and squash bugs.
We've been down for a few days. A couple of the highlights from the recent downtime include:
- Brand new server package with more processor power, RAM, disk space
- Editing bug has been fixed.
- A few Wiki bugs corrected
- Comment RSS is back
- Feedback/bugs form created
Hopefully, the most significant change you'll notice is a speed increase. If you find bugs, let us know. We're not promising a bug-free experience (yet). However <strong>do not post bug threads in the forums</strong>. Please direct feedback, comments, bugs here to our fancy new feedback form: http://www.typophile.com/feedback/
This new server package opens up lots of possibilities for Typophile, which will help us realize some goals we've had for the site for some time. Stick around, it's only going to get better.
Jared, Joe, Christian and Zara

<div class=commentbody>Thanks for all the work.
I might have paypal'd more, but wasn't sure if the membership thing would come up again soon. As a member, when the new program starts, will there be dues, or something like that?</div>

<div class=commentbody>It'll be the same as we had in the past - an (optional) yearly membership, which yields a number of perks and gifts for the supporters.

<div class=commentbody>Wow, the site is mad fast at the moment.
All because of the new hosting package?
Or just that there's barely anyone is on the forum right now. ;)
Anyway: nice work.</div>

<div class=commentbody>If people don't read this thread, how are they supposed to know not to "post bug threads in the forums. Please direct feedback, comments, bugs here to our fancy new feedback form: http://www.typophile.com/feedback/"
Shouldn't this notation be on the home and forums pages?</div>
