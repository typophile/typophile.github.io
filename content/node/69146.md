  body: "It's a bit hard to tell, because the letter angles change, but I think this
    is hand-printed. I don't think the duplicated letters are exactly identical. The
    way the t fits under the s could be done in a font, I know, but it also might
    be more evidence for hand-drawn.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
