  is set in 1979-1980:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Argo_Farsi_still_3845.jpg]\r\n\r\nAre
  those styles of typeface that old, or is this yet another instance of Hollywood's
  lack of typographic sensitivity?\r\n\r\nMaybe I should ask this guy: http://www.imdb.com/name/nm5209647/\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    out of place even for the 1960s.

    For example that newspaper shot is only onscreen for a fraction of a second, but
    I checked with my wife (who grew up in Iran) and she said that not only does all
    the text make sense, she actually remembers the newspaper's flag at the top-right!
    James Cameron should be paying attention...\r\n\r\nBut I still have a feeling
    those font styles were not used in newspapers at that time.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    - even the funny vertical placement of some letters has been reproduced.* And
    I guess those fonts are older than I thought.\r\n\r\n* And now I'm wondering whether
    the newspaper used in the movie is actually a facsimile.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    otherwise.\u201D\r\n\r\nExcept, like, the plot.\r\n\r\n\u201CWell, let me say
    first of all, it's a great drama,\u201D [Jimmy] Carter told CNN\u2019s Piers Morgan
    in an interview that aired Thursday. \u201CAnd I hope it gets the Academy Award
    for best film because I think it deserves it. The other thing that I would say
    was that 90 percent of the contributions to the ideas and the consummation of
    the plan was Canadian. And the movie gives almost full credit to the American
    CIA. And with that exception, the movie is very good.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CBut Ben
    Affleck's character in the film was only \u2026 in Tehran a day and a half [in
    real life],\u201D Carter said. \u201CAnd the main hero, in my opinion, was Ken
    Taylor, who was the Canadian ambassador who orchestrated the entire process.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u2014History
    News Network (http://hnn.us/articles/carter-argo-not-accurate)\r\n\r\nThe movie
    ending was equally Hollywood-manufactured. There was no confrontation, suspicion
    or tension in real life. They just walked out, got on the plane and left."

    accuracy. I said <em>\"details\"</em>...  :-)\r\n\r\nMore good reads, from my
    personal go-to source:\r\nhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-21504409\r\nhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-21003432\r\n\r\nFor
    one thing, anybody who's been through a Middle Eastern airport even once knows
    very well that you only get caught if you're not doing anything wrong... So that
    excruciating, super-dramatic maneuvering to get on the airplane at the end could
    never have been remotely close to reality. And that runway chase?! Gimme a break.
