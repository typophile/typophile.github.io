  body: There are only two MA programs in Typeface Design in the entire world. One
    is at the University of Reading in the UK, the other is at the Dutch Royal Academy
    of Art in the The Hague. Some schools in France and Germany also teach type design,
    but as part of larger graphic design education. A few German schools do this well.
    Some schools inSwitzerland include it as part of undergrad education. All German
    design students graduate with MA equivalents
