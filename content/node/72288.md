  things more practical: i would need for a client three weights of hypatia sans (e.g.

    Office 2010 does in fact support OpenType layout features, including even stylistic

    Then again, even if your customer/client is on Office 2010, it may still make

    think something like this is best accomplished with automation in terms of how
    the change is done. One could script it in FontLab with Python, or even using
    TTX and Python. I suggest that offering some small bounty and letting the script
    be open source would be ideal, as it would be useful to others as well, on other
    fonts. Maybe Tal Leming, Adam Twardoch or Just van Rossum would be available....\r\n\r\nHeck,

    know you're not a lawyer, but here goes. I modify most of the Adobe fonts we use
    for setting scholarly books for publishers. Here's the problem: we have customers
    that do have a license for the unmodified fonts, and want us to include the fonts
    we actually used, along with the .indd files, as part of finishing off a project.
    To date we have refused, partly on the basis of the licensing. \r\n\r\nThey argue
    that the practice of publishers REQUIRING the typesetter to include the fonts
    is so common as to make our concerns unwarranted. And in case the type design
    community didn't know it, that practice *is* common, as is the one of allowing
    (interior) book designers to use only Adobe fonts because of the licensing situation.
    (Don't get down on me, I'm only reporting, not arguing for this position.)\r\n\r\nTying
    this in to the original question then, is \"no distribution\" to be taking only
    as prohibiting reselling the type itself, or does it include prohibiting passing
    on the modified fonts to a customer who also holds a license for the unmodified
    font?\r\n\r\nIf the latter, it would seem that Gerhard Donauer is still in need
    of a solution."

  body: "To try and stay relevant to Mr. Donauer's post, I think he faces some of
    the same issues.\r\n\r\nI'd be happy to talk to someone at Adobe, but it is a
    large company, and to anyone but a very few in the type design side of things,
    I'd just be an annoyance to ignore (well, maybe there too, but hopefully sometimes
    an *interesting* annoyance . . .).\r\n\r\nThe use of type has gone well beyond
    what anyone envisioned when the EULAs were written to protect the foundries while
    maintaining a useful product. I can show you numerous contracts from State-run
    university presses which require the typesetter to include the fonts with each
    job as a part the contract. This isn't for printing the book, but for the *file,*
    now the principle product of publishing.\r\n\r\nFor example, one of the things
    I've been told is that when a publisher contracts with an outside agency (usually
    in India) to take the InDesign files and make an ebook, the Indian company will
    give them a significant discount for this work if the fonts are included. It isn't
    that the fonts are being used for the ebook itself (usually Kindle or EPUB format),
    but the people doing the work find it easier if the fonts are included.\r\n\r\nOr,
    one I got just today. A publisher discovered that there are no hamzas or ayns
    in Arno (surprise), which the designer has chosen for the text. They have asked
    us to set it, so I'll make up and kern the characters. Likely there are a few
    dot-below Latin characters needed as well.\r\n\r\nBUT the designer wants those
    fonts so she can do the cover. Of course, they already have a license for Arno;
    they can't see a licensing problem. And this is one of the publishers who makes
    sure they have a license to cover the number of platforms the type is used on.
    They are trying to stay legitimate. Number of total copies of a font, or restrictions
    on modified fonts are not on their radar.\r\n\r\nAFAIK, everybody in the publishing
    world ignores the \"number of copies\" part of the EULA, feeling, I suppose, that
    they just couldn't do their work otherwise. I can't imagine they have a site license
    for number of copies of the fonts they use, not if every book generates two or
    three copies. If the foundries say \"tough,\" the press directors will say fine,
    all our books will be set in a couple of typefaces. And Open Source fonts will
    gain a lot of new converts. Type designers can forget about any sales to publishers.\r\n\r\nIf
    anyone thinks this is only done by small publishers, two I know of who require
    the typesetter to include all fonts are Oxford University Press and Columbia University
    Press -- and both do hold licenses for the fonts they allow the designers to specify."

  body: Assuming it's legit for the client to pay me to modify their Adobe licensed
    font, I've been working on the basis of giving them my modified version and telling
    them to replace an unmodified copy with it, and then billing them for whatever
    fraction of my modification time seems appropriate based on whether I did the
    modification just for them or if it was something I had already done for general
    use with many clients. This seems to work so far, but admittedly I've only done
    small changes like adding a few glyphs that can live without in-font kerning if
    necessary (nothing like re-kerning all of Arno Pro), so I've never tried to bill
    them for enough time to cause anguished screams.

  body: "Adobe is interested in helping people \"stay legal\", and anyone who is making
    an effort to do so should not worry about contacting Adobe to ask questions about
    it.\r\n\r\nJust to be clear: Adobe's EULA allows for the kinds of modifications
    discussed here, but the modified font counts toward permitted uses. An end user
    that has a one-seat license <em>cannot</em> modify the font and keep/use both
    the unmodified and modified font. Luckily, the most common font EULA from Adobe
    is a 5-seat license, so many users have the leeway to modify a font and still
    keep the original.\r\n\r\nOne reason Adobe is somewhat permissive about sending
    copies of fonts along with jobs is because we recognize that small variations
    between font versions can exist, and it's sometimes important for a job to be
    output with the <em>exact same</em> font that it was created with. Still, the
    service bureau must have their own legitimate license.\r\n\r\nObviously, a contract
    requiring a designer to hand over a font to a publisher with a job does not supersede
    the user's existing EULA. An appropriate response in the face of such a demand
    would be, \"I will be happy to include all fonts, but you must first ensure that
    you purchase your own license.\"\r\n\r\nCharles (or anyone), feel free to contact
    me offline and I'd be happy to get your legal questions answered definitively."

    copies of the software. The usual thinking I run into from publishers is \"We
    bought the font. Therefore, it is OK for you to sent me a copy of it.\"\r\n\r\nWell,
    no. The publisher bought, say, a license to have five separate copies of the software
    (usually) installed on their computers. If I send them a copy of our fonts with
    job, that would be a sixth copy. Either I (as a vendor with X-number licensed
    copies) need to give up one of my licensed copies, or *somebody* has to buy a
    new license.\r\n\r\nIt is the number of copies the license permits that no one
    seems to understand.\r\n\r\nAll this is separate from the muddy modification rules
    (cited above). As I read them, I can't \"send a copy\" even if a new license is
    purchased; modified fonts can't leave the building. Further, it looks like I'm
    supposed to trot over to their building & modify the newly licensed copy there.
    And I'm not supposed to take any \"fonts\" with me, or leave with any \"fonts.\"
    Please tell me I'm wrong on this, my trotting days are long past.\r\n\r\nAs I've
    said before, this doesn't fit the modern workflow. Maybe a per-use license, or
    a cheaper \"license to archive\" for copies of the font software where there is
    no anticipated use; they are a backup in case a particular job, for some reason
    (second printing with three corrections, maybe?) needs them.\r\n\r\nFWIW"
