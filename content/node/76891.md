    The font doesn't have to match visually - it can have visual contrast to the Baskerville
    but also work well with it.\r\n\r\nI have short-listed:\r\n\r\nGill Sans\r\nGranby\r\nMonotype
    Grotesque"

  body: Figgins Sans reminds me of English Egyptian which Christian Schwartz made
    a version of at one time. I don't feel that Figgins would work that well with
    Baskerville. I think it takes it to far the other way, needs to be more 20th Century
    than 19th.
