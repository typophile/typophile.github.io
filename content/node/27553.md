  example, custom lettering or letterspaced typography,that will not be edited, for
  a nameplate. \r\nEPS, TIFF, PDF? Or perhaps other formats?\r\n\r\nInput would be
  greatly appreciated.\r\n\r\nIvan"

  body: 'If the nameplate is going to be engraved, it''s best to check with your supplier:
    some engraving/milling machines only accept certain kinds of input files, and
    it is unwise to assume that what works for print will work with mills.'

  body: "If supplying .EPS files to engraving shops, Illustrator 3.0 compatible .EPS
    or Illustrator 3.0 .AI files will tend to work the best.\r\n\r\nMany engravers
    use the same kind of sign making software as I use. Illustrator 3.0 is a pretty
    safe bet on compatibility."

  body: "Because applications like Gerber Omega and FlexiSign Pro tend to flip out
    at times when fed an Illustrator 8.0 file. This tends to happen more often when
    you have a number of layers included in that version 8.0 AI/EPS file.\r\n\r\nSaving
    down to earliest version and checking results is typically a very good policy.
    Although I'm pretty good at keeping applications up to date, I always roll my
    eyes at those folks who insist on sending files saved in the very newest version
    of application they're using. I'm thinking, \"dude, no one could even be paid
    to care if you have the newest version of your app-du-jour; save down in a format
    you know everyone can use. We're just trying to work here.\""
