  reunion today in which he could invite his favorite typeface relatives, who would
  he invite and why? What would the Helvetica family tree look like?...I think Akzidenz
  Grotesk Bald (I mean Bold) would be the gracefully aged grandfather of Helvetica...
  brash cousins?... crazy cousins?... etc...bastard son Arial... enlightened and reclusive
  son Haas Unica?..."

    baby mama.
