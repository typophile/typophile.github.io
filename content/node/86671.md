  in my first foray into freelance. Was requested by my client to recreate this logo
  type. I'm thinking I can definitely improv the slanted terminals, however, I need
  to know what typeface it is set in first!\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://s788.photobucket.com/albums/yy161/wadg/?action=view&amp;current=cohens_logo.jpg\"
  target=\"_blank\"><img src=\"http://i788.photobucket.com/albums/yy161/wadg/cohens_logo.jpg\"
  border=\"0\" alt=\"Photobucket\"></a>\r\n\r\nI've tried all of the big names, univers,
  frutiger, avant garde, etc. My guess it is some obscure free font, so any clue you
  fine folks could give me would be greatly appreciated!\r\n\r\nEDIT: Weird how this
  board automatically resizes images. I apologize for the pixelation. You can check
  it out in its natural habitat here:\r\nwww.cohensfashionoptical.com\r\n\r\nThanks
  so much!"
