  but still have no idea what a good tracking/line-height would be. Is there a listing
  (or calculator) of system fonts with sizes/letter-spacing/line-heights?\r\n\r\nThanks."

  body: "I assume you are asking about print typography, not screen, and about setting
    readable text? Looking for a universal formula will not get you anywhere. The
    typeface design, font size, tracking, line spacing and column width all interact.
    Your eye has to be the arbiter in the end.\r\nJuliet"

  body: I would suggest reading the basics of typography and a good way to test web
    typography is to experiment different sizes, widths and spacing until it appears
    comfortable. A good little guide on web typography can be found at webtypography.net.
