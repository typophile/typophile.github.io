    this is what I found out from the foundry, Terminal Design:\r\n\r\n\"ClearviewText
    is the replacement for ClearviewOne. The metrics and kerning in ClearviewText
    have been improved and may not match exactly the metrics in the Old ClearviewOne.
    ClearviewText is also an OpenType font so it contains small caps, and various
    numeral styles.\"\r\n\r\nThanks Pieter for directing me to the foundry where I
    was able to find the answer I needed :)"

    a few different glyphs. And ClearviewATT can only be used on AT&T accounts. Is
    that how you have a copy?"
