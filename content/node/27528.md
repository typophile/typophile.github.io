  serif script font called (I think) 'Noise'. It looks similar to the font on Bjork's
  Vespertine album. Any leads? I'd love to find something free, if possible, but any
  sort of direction someone could point me in would be appreciated, free or not!\r\nThanks
  a million...\r\nSarah"

    for sites that have it. The Bjork fonts have frequently been discussed. You can
    search using Google, with the addition of 'site: www.typophile.com' and Google
    will find any forum discussions that included your terms.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: Thanks a million... I've spent all afternoon slogging through the various
    bjork forums for a link to the font, but no luck! I did the search through google
    though that was suggested, and think I found my answer (although unfortunately
    not the answer I was hoping for!) Perhaps I'll have to switch directions on the
    font search and use something different. I'm feeling a bit sheepish about looking
    for the font in the first place, as I'm fairly certain that the second anyone
    sees the design they're going to go "Isn't that the font from...". Sigh. I hate
    it when you know the perfect font for something, but it just won't work...

    why I decided to go to sleep after that. You seemed to have it pretty much covered.
    No need for me. :^D"
