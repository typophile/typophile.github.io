		<div class="commentbody">It's a great book, and I love its irreverent, lighthearted attitude. It's a real change of pace from the much drier books that tend to populate related spaces (though I think there are no books that cover this exact space). <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->That being said, some of the same qualities that make it great fun seem to make it more of a browse and read-chunks-of book rather than a reference work, for me. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->My only very small complaint is that Leslie does readers a bit of a disservice by saying that &quot;glyph&quot; is just the trendy new term for &quot;character.&quot; The difference is critical in understanding font-building and text processing for complex languages (e.g. Arabic) and for advanced typography in general (e.g. OpenType, AAT, Graphite, whatever). But that's just one little thing in a generally outstanding book. Guess we'll just have to look ahead to the FontLab book to see glyph vs. character covered better, or I'll have to write my own&hellip;. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Speaking of the many cool tidbits, I have been using the little blurb about Bezier as my sig quote lately. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Cheers, <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->T <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&quot;Monsieur Bezier, if your thing worked, the Americans would already be using it.&quot; <!-- raw HTML omitted -->- Pierre Bezier's boss at Renault, on the discovery of the Bezier curve</div>

For me, Bringhurst's <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Elements<!-- raw HTML omitted --> is a reference book, because I use it to look stuff up. But I agree with you and everybody else that Leslie's book is inspirational and likely to incite typographic creativity in most everyone who reads it; it's a sort of touchstone.

		<div class="commentbody">This is so much better than amazon.com where the author can't answer back to the reviewers! : ) So&hellip;Thomas, I wish I hadn't put down the term Glyph in my book. When I wrote it, FontLab was not quite on my radar yet. Now, in the FontLab manual I'm writing (half-through, so far) I'm still uncomfortable with the term so I alternate it with &quot;character.&quot; I just can't get myself to refer to a drawing of a letter as a glyph.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Simon, one of the best things about my doing the FontLab book is the &quot;in&quot; it's given me with the FL gang. I've been trying to stick in my 2cents wherever possible about changes that I feel need to be made. I'm advocating that there eventually be only the most minor differences between the Mac and PC versions of the program. In my book, I'm trying to cover both PC and Mac as to key combo descriptions and pointing out any differences between versions. As I said, I hope by the 2nd edition of this book, there will be fewer differences to have to point out. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Hrant, by all means let me know what made you uncomfortable in my writing about fonts,  I'm kind of a nervous wreck because I know I've probably made tons of errors in a book this size and so when you guys let me know, I'll try to get them fixed in the next printing. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Leslie</div>

The distinction of character (semantic encoded text entity) and glyph (conventional representation of character) is extremely important in making sense of the relationship between text processing (input, editing, storage, exchange) and text display (rendering, typographic layout, etc.). If you confuse these two terms, you leave yourself without a meaningful vocabulary for discussing this relationship. The fact that the relationship of character to glyph is not one-to-one makes it particularly important that the distinction is maintained. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->You may find my <!-- raw HTML omitted -->article<!-- raw HTML omitted --> on OpenType Layout useful in understanding the distinction between and relationship of characters and glyphs.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">To put it really simply (and not perfectly accurately), A glyph is a letter drawing, and a character is a specific encoding slot. In a font, a given character (slot) has a default glyph (outline) associated with it. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->So, all three of those example uses are valid. However, to make the contrast more clear, one might say for #3, &quot;I accidentally pasted the glyph for the character A into the window for the character B.&quot; <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->John's definition is the most correct. But if you want us to simplify (at the risk of losing some accuracy), I'd say: A character is the abstract idea of a letter, like the letter &quot;A.&quot; A glyph is a particular version of a letter. So the character &quot;A&quot; in Warnock Pro Italic has a default glyph, but also has at least a couple of alternate glyphs, including a swash form and a small cap. So there's one character, but three glyphs. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Of course, characters actually go beyond letters. Things like numbers or even musical notes or certain symbols can be characters, as long as they have defined encoding slots, and are not simply alternate forms of something else. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->It's also worth noting that the relationship between glyphs and characters is <!-- raw HTML omitted -->n<!-- raw HTML omitted -->-to-<!-- raw HTML omitted -->m<!-- raw HTML omitted -->, where n and m are integers zero or greater. In plain English, that suggests that several characters may combine to form one glyph (as in a fraction or ligature), and several glyphs may combine to form a single character (as with an accented letter, created on the fly from a letter glyph and an accent glyph). <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->It gets even more complicated with some other languages. English is the &quot;easy&quot; case. And there's a whole realm of debate on when to encode glyphs as their own characters, but I've spent too much time on that in email with John lately, so I think I won't go there tonight&hellip;.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Regards, <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->T</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Leslie, I think the most elegant simplification of &quot;glyph&quot; would be to say that it's &quot;an instance of a character&quot;, meaning that it's a given rendering of a letter, numeral, or really any symbol, even stuff that's not encoded. The other terms, like &quot;character&quot;, &quot;letter&quot;, &quot;symbol&quot; are really abstract concepts, with no inherent physical presence, maybe not even a structural definition*. That's why really unorthodox glyphs can often be identified as being a certain letter with great certainty. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->* I've come to realize for example that you can never really <!-- raw HTML omitted -->show<!-- raw HTML omitted --> the essence of a letter, you can only <!-- raw HTML omitted -->describe<!-- raw HTML omitted --> it. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->hhp <!-- raw HTML omitted --></div>

		<div class="commentbody"><!-- raw HTML omitted -->I'm not being facetious. Seems to me that &quot;glyph&quot; is commonly used both to describe a  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->letter drawing and a specific slot in a font. Is this right?<!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Yes, because a font is just a big collection of glyphs. Even within a font, and within FontLab, the relationship of a glyph cell to character(s) is not one-to-one: a single glyph can be mapped to multiple characters (this is very common in TrueType font, e.g. the /space/ glyph will be mapped to both the regular space character and the non-breaking space character). <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I believe the easiest way to think about the distinction is to accept that 'character' is no longer a typographic term. Glyph is a typographic term that refers to the little images and to their storage in a font. Character is a text encoding term that refers to the abstract identity of, e.g. an uppercase A, that is stored as a number on a computer. The two concepts only come together during display of text, when the characters in the text are mapped to glyphs in a given font.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I bought and am reading the book. I think it's delightful and useful. It is full of useful information, a significant amount of which is new to me, and it is done with charm and a light touch.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I particularly appreciate the creative and excellent typography.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->You'd think that good typography would be a given in a book about type, but it seems that is often not so. For example, am I the only one who thinks that 'Type &amp; typography' by Baines and Haslam is a typographic disaster? <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->A typographic comparison - appropriate as both are full of type and lettering illustrations, presenting a similar design challenge.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Both are on bright white coated paper, which of course helps with the illustrations, especially  color. Baines &amp; Haslam put all their type on the bright white pages, with a resulting dazzle that detracts from readability. Carbarga softly shades most pages, or uses colored type against white, squelching the dazzle, enhancing readability and adding a pleasant variety. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->For text Bains and Haslam use a small size (9 or 10 point) of Swift in a long measure - I count 80 characters - and try to counteract the wide line with large leading - something like 10/14 point. Swift was designed for newspapers, which have narrow columns closely set, and hence is a condensed face with large x-height. Using it totally differently I think flops. The long line with the short extenders is just plain unpleasant to read, especially with the dazzle. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->By contrast Cabarga uses the ridiculously easy-to-read Century Schoolbook (I think), whose wide letters match the sometimes wide measure, with an effortly readable result. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The captions and side bars in Bains and Haslam are in Meta, negatively tracked so tight that it is hard to read, for me at least.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The captions and side bars in Carbarga are in narrow columns in a compressed sans (what is it?) which is very readable. It adds fuel to my belief that only narrow sans work well in text. In any case the typeface and the measure and leading are beautifully matched.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Finally, Bains and Haslam have quotations on typography from various luminaries. They are set in a huge, 42 point Meta, with no leading, running across two-page spreads. The text runs continuously, but the two-page spreads are separated by 32 pages. This puts the spreads at the middle of signatures, so the text can align perfectly across the two pages. Clever, but reading the stuff is like putting together a jigsaw puzzle. Also the credits for the quotations jump back to the 10 point Swift, a totally different scale - a violation of Cabarga's rule 20 of the &quot;Immutable laws of Lettering - and the myriad of exceptions thereto.&quot;  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Overall, the effect in Bains and Haslem is of clever innovation whose result is off-puttingly difficult to read, and visually ungainly.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->In Cabarga, I think more consistency from page spread to page spread would make the design stronger, as he uses many different principles to organize his page spreads. This threatens toward the visual chaos, but he manages to keep it undercontrol, perhaps by control of scale from page to page. The bottom line is that every page spread is inviting, readable, and effectively gets across what he wants to explain. To convey such a large amount of technical information in such an agreeable way - both visually and literarily - is an impressive achievement.</div>
