  I did there?), so I figured I''d start a topic. I just recently got my first DSLR!
  I''m pretty excited. <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/77647883@N04/7114477769/">This</a>
  is the first picture I ever took with it, which wasn''t very thought out. It was
  cold, I felt nervous even holding it (my other camera was a dinky point and shoot),
  and it was also cold. I mainly just wanted to gawk at the quality. My point and
  shoot had 5 megapixels, so the same as my iPhone. It was an upgrade of momentous
  proportions. So, is anyone on here into photography? '

    camera to document interesting typography in signs, statues, grave markers, house
    numbers, and so forth. Photos like that get posted at Typophile occasionally.\r\n\r\nYou'll
    find your DSLR to be a big step up from your point-and-shoot camera. I used to
    be seriously into photography and sometimes did my own darkroom work in the old
    days, but unfortunately I just don't have as much free time as I used to and my
    Nikon mostly sits on the shelf. \r\n\r\nRegarding the number of megapixels, it's
    certainly a consideration but their importance is sometimes overemphasized (unless
    you're making a lot of big enlargements, in which case they'll make a big difference).
    But much of the improvement in quality you'll notice in the DSLR is due to the
    superior quality of the lenses."

  body: 'I agree JamesM. Megapixels definitely aren''t everything, but megapixels
    weren''t the only real issue. It was just the quality in general (I know the sensor
    plays a huge part in that as well). My iPhone takes better pictures, to put that
    into perspective. Sometimes the shots it took looked kinda neat, like in <a href="http://i392.photobucket.com/albums/pp6/CanwllCorfe/boats_by_canwllcorfe-d2zp4ca-1.jpg">this
    case</a>, which made the scene far more moody than it actually looked, but the
    quality is obviously quite bad. Then there''s the fact that instead of trying
    to keep everything in focus, I can actually have depth of field now! But one of
    the biggest things is that I can take night shots now, which is something I''ve
    wanted to do for quite some time. I bought a tripod for my point and shoot, thinking
    that would help. Nope. '

    some more lenses. For now, the kit one (18-55mm) will more than suffice. I figure
    I''ll do all my learning with what I have, and then eventually I can step it up
    and get more equipment. The one thing I do intend on getting is a polarizing filter.
    I think that will definitely come in handy for my upcoming trip to Florida. '

    some disadvantages to doing it; Google for more details.

  body: "When people start into photography the first most common concern is to get
    a good camera, then many realize it is more important to have a good lens, then
    some realize it is more important to have good lighting, and then you get old
    professional photographers toying around with plastic cameras... jejeje.\r\n\r\nMy
    point is that in the end the most important thing is for you to be passionate
    and to think a lot about the photos you take. That way you will develop an area
    of interest (landscape, birds, portrait, fashion, abstracts, erotic, candid, textures),
    a style, technical competence and an eye for it.\r\n\r\nHaving a DSLR is a big
    step, it will help you gain control over your photography. Experiment a lot with
    speed and aperture. Learn about light. Having a fast lens (F 2.8), a tripod and
    a polarizing filter are the three greatest additions to a photographer's kit.\r\n\r\nNow
    I do mostly snapshooting.\r\nhttp://www.flickr.com/photos/hectormunoz/"

    \r\n\r\nThe tripod rs-donsata mentioned is good advice. There are also telescoping
    monopods available (one leg); not as stable as a tripod but easier to carry and
    less obtrusive. A pocket-sized beanbag can also be useful; set it on a rock or
    railing or whatever and brace your camera against it.\r\n\r\nNick, I agree with
    you about the featuritis of new cameras. I've never figured out all the settings
    of my Nikon;   sometimes I miss the simple Mamiya Sekor I used back in the 1980s."

  body: "@rs_donsata Ohh yes, that interest is what I'm honing now. I quite like everything,
    but living in the Poconos sort of limits me to nature shots. As you can imagine,
    there aren't many cityscapes here in the woods. I did wish I had some access to
    them, because one of my favorite thing to take pictures of is the city at nightfall.
    These settings are really what I'm most excited about. I did a brief covering
    of them back in High School with a film SLR, but it's been so long. I have a basic
    knowledge, but I'm hoping to improve that by going and renting books from the
    local library and doing some online research. \r\n\r\n@JamesM Yeah I should probably
    invest in a better tripod than the one I have now. Especially considering a lot
    of what I've been doing lately is night oriented stuff. Well, mainly right now
    I'm just trying to nail it all down. "
