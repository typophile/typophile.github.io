body: "Hi Every One,\r\n\r\nI'm new to this forum and looking for some fresh advice
  on a logo/Identity I'm working on.\r\n\r\nThe logo is for my design studio in New
  Zealand. As many designers know or may appreciate it quite a difficult task to design
  a logo for yourself. It has sat in limbo for around 3 months and I am not sure where
  to go from here.\r\n\r\nFirstly the logo was inspired by the new studio we moved
  to- an old government office, hence the traditional emblem look. We did some research
  and each animal represents the founding partners of our firm. We also have a love
  of retro inspiired design (but I felt creating a simple circular form etc has been
  done to death by designers around here).\r\n\r\nWe wanted a logo that represented
  tradition and quality yet had a modern mood. (this was to be conveyed within supporting
  design elements\u2013 illustration and phtography) Hence we rolled out the logo
  on our web site but never completed material for print material. Which leaves us
  in the shameful position of not having a consistent identity!\r\n\r\nAny how, sorry
  for long story- I'll cut to the case:\r\n\r\nCurrenty the logo Uses Minion Pro (I
  know) and I'm wanting to change the font to something more unique\u2013 yet suits
  the style. The logo can not really be changed dramitically as it is in use (silly
  I know). I require a great, well designed typeface with various weights so it can
  be used throughtout material. I am trying to use the traditional typography in a
  modern way in material.\r\n\r\nAnother problem with the current logo is the \"Design
  & Communication\" typography can not be reduced and be legable at small sizes. However
  I like the way it sits between the animal legs?\r\n\r\nThe typography also must
  have heavy weights also to be used in poster/illustratios etc. Asking too much?
  \r\n\r\nAny help would be most appreciated.\r\n\r\nCheers, Jason\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Logo_sample_5395.jpg]"

  body: What if there were two 'dots' - One for I & one for m. Or a sheild? Then the
    text could go in a wavy banner below as well. Or get rid of the circle & let the
    letters be free between the animals.

  body: "*As many designers know or may appreciate it quite a difficult task to design
    a logo for yourself\r\n\r\n\r\nExactly! It's almost rediculous how much harder
    it is to create one for yourself. And it doesn't help that it's hard to create
    logos for design firms anyway. \r\n\r\nMore to the point, I don't like the composition
    of the logo, especially for everything you want it to do. It's too hard to read
    the letters in the circle and the logotype feels forced into that location. I
    would even think it would be better to shrink the whole mark and just put it above
    the type and not have the type in the feet. \r\n\r\nAlso I would think a more
    traditional shield would be better or something more unique. It sort of reminds
    me of Minds of Intelligence's logo: http://www.mindsofintelligence.com/ although
    the one they have currently on their site isn't a good representation. And theirs
    is much more versatile. I like the shapes of the animals however they are so dramatic
    it consumes the logo and takes it over. Maybe reducing their size in comparison
    to the type would help. "

  body: "As per the card I think it will look good. Large gold foil will be cool,
    can't really tell what the other side will look like without an image, what kind
    of image are you going to have? I don't really think you need an image but just
    some different type layouts. The cut out type as it is currently will be harder
    to read and there is no separation/heirchy to look at so finding information will
    take too much effort when it should be effortless.\r\n\r\nYou could put a gold
    foil border around the contact info side to tie in the theme and keep a defined
    look on that side also (if money permits)."

  body: "Thanks guys, this is great getting some outside feedback!\r\n\r\nPersonally
    I'm not a huge fan of the circular form in the middle and contents. It was really
    a way of trying to connect animals together without them looking like they were
    fighting (see attached).\r\n\r\nI see what you mean Eben, a sheild and wavy banner
    could work well, just not to sure whether it would be \"modern\" enough. When
    I orignially started sketching I used a sheild but couldn't really come up with
    ideas that worked within the sheild.\r\n\r\nAnother issue I find with the current
    logo is that it needs to be centered within a page otherwise it looks un-balanced.\r\n\r\nAlso
    could it look better just having 1 animal to represent both animals or just a
    lion with some nice typography below.\r\n\r\nWe currently use the lion as a ico/build
    logo for web sites\u2013 maybe this would be a better way to go.\r\n\r\nAttached
    some more concepts, with your sugestions. When the logo is on top of the type
    it appears to just float\u2013 any suggestions on how to tie it in.\r\n\r\nCurrent
    logo in use:\r\n\r\nwww.imagemechanics.co.nz\r\n\r\nThanks agian for your help!\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/IMAGE_sampl_logo_2_5562.jpg][img:sites/default/files/old-images/IMAGE_sampl_logo_5785.jpg]"

  body: I have to admit that in context the current logo works better than I thought
    it would. What if you got rid of the IM & kept the circle. Then it would be like
    aq portal to the images you are mechanic-ing. Maybe give the crcle a more elaborate
    frame... Or what about a swooshy caligraphic I & M between the animals?

    body: "HI Eben,\r\n\r\nThanks so much for your ideas!\r\n\r\nBy changing the typography,
      removing the floral \"I & M\" and increasing the thickness of circle it looks
      alot better. Provides a more dynamic modern expression. Also I think the typeface
      being a sans serif and bolder, simplifies the look and gives the logo more downward
      weight to conter-act the heavy nature of the animals.\r\n\r\nMaybe if I simplfy
      the animals, to look a little cleaner it would improve it.\r\n\r\nI added a
      crown (quickly to see how it would look) This could look interesting if a little
      more simplified as a focal point.\r\n\r\nAny suggestions on a typeface that
      would work well?\r\n\r\nWhat do you think?\r\n\r\nCheers\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/IMAGEMECH_LOGO_VERS_3jpg_3688.jpg]"

  body: "How would you feel about moving the circle up to almost level with the top
    of the heads of Pegasus and the lion, this could still contain a simple I, centred
    over, M monogram, I think you would have to drop the swashes to avoid printing/legibility
    problems. Then break ImageMechanics into two lines, using the back legs as frames,
    which would allow you to increase the type size to balance the weight of the of
    the elements, as for your strapline, (does it have to include studio?) either
    way the triangular shape the type makes would allow you to increase the strapline
    size. Depending on the print size you might need to reduce some of the more extravagant
    hairs on the heraldic creatures.\r\nTim"

    \"Design Studio\" within circle- or could this be mis interpreted by the audience?
    I Like the composition but feel the typeface is really letting it down. The spacing
    between \"mechanics\" looks bad also.\r\nAny suggestions on a more unique type?
    Perhaps more fluid.\r\n\r\nThanks all for your ideas and feedback. Have been strugling

  body: "I think having Design Studio in the circle could cause problems at small
    size use. Image Mechanics is struggling with the tracking issues, try without
    tracking and pulling them slightly down from the image and upping the point size
    and leading a bit so the shape is still working with the back legs but with slightly
    more room, I don't have a problem with the Minion it sits well with the imagery,
    you could certainly have a look at other typefaces, my feeling is that it needs
    to be conservative maybe\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/stempel-garamond/\r\n\r\nor
