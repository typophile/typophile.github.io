    you tell us about the curled shape? \r\n\r\nI think like Hrant, ( I assume this
    is what he means ) That the cap T could be wider. The S might somehow be fatter
    as well. \r\n\r\nOf course I don't know - maybe you have a logic behind releasing
    it as free that I don't fathom. Sort of like what FF does but for Village instead?

  body: "I just found this site while googling \"koru font\", looking for a Kiwi (or
    Pacific Islander?)artist who has reportedly done a lot of font work with NZ motifs.
    My interest in koru fonts is mostly intrigue; but I have one immediate practical
    application: I need a \"Private\" sign over my double driveway in Whangarei. Such
    a sign in a stencil koru font would be nice and less offensive. With your permission,
    I might try your font.\r\nI think your font could be used as a stencil font, where
    signs would be cut from metal sheet or plate (e.g. aluminium, copper, bronze,
    stainless steel, steel then galvanized) using a computer controlled plasma cutter,
    or better still a computer controlled laser cutter. The korus would remain attached
    to the plate, so they might be fattened a little for strength. Stencil font signs
    in metal plate are the only truly indestructible signs, being unaffected by rain,
    UV, moulds, fire, graffiti and vandalism. As such, I feel there is a huge untapped
    market for metal stencil font signs. You need to find someone fluent in Autocad
    and a fabricator with a laser cutting machine. DOC and NZ Tourism Dept would be
    two potential customers.\r\nCaterpillar's Technical Center in Mossville, Illinois
    has many everlasting laser cut stainless steel stencil signs on out buildings,
    and services; as well as \"Prairie\" signs with a birdsfoot violet flower as the
    dot over the \"i's\". These have been through many prairie burns and still look
    new. "
