  I chanced upon this modern slab-serifed beauty in a PDF e-mailed to me by a friend,
  who works for a magazine. (For those that don't already know, hitting Ctrl+D brings
  out a dialogue that tells you what fonts, if any, are embedded in an Acrobat document)\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Kontrapunkt_5433.gif]\r\n\r\nThe
  award winning squarish type available in two weights and italics, was designed as
  the house-face of a Danish company that goes by the same name. Nobly offered free
  to designers the world over, they say it's been hauled down more than 60 thousand
  times.\r\n\r\n<strong>Well done Kontrapunkt.</strong> \r\n"

    you bring it too mind again. \r\n\r\nI have it, but have never bother use it.
    Semi-extended slabs are very useful... I need to get on the ball!\r\n\r\nMikey
