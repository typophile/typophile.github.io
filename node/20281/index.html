		<div class="commentbody"><p>thanks for your feedback on a sunday afternoon!</p>
<p>i have tried versions with an UC r, and as you might predict, it makes the interior spaces in the logo look too busy, and worse, ruins the symmetry of the logo. i have succeeded in getting the UC r to join the o at the bottom, but it just aint workin for me.</p>
<p>i like your suggestions, dish, for the tag. i love playing with tags. they&rsquo;re so cool. however, i&rsquo;m still stumped on what face to use. i tend to think that for a logo like this, that is, a typographic one, that whatever face i use for the tag ought to be as plain as possible, so there is no conflict for graphical attention. i&rsquo;ve thrown in some trajan here, simply because it&rsquo;s &lsquo;kingly&rsquo; in its appearance, but i&rsquo;m not sold on it by any means, as it really departs from the comic/pow look i&rsquo;m trying to hit.</p>
<p>now, as for the r&hellip; i&rsquo;m not sure i like this solution, or even if this is a solution. i do think that it brings out the r more, without destroying the o. still, the o looks more like a d than it did before.</p>
<p>so here&rsquo;s where things get interesting: per the first version, i was banking on the &lsquo;recognizability&rsquo; of the word hero to slip the reader over the problematic r. is this a horrible nono for logo design? i know that the concept is used all the time, as graphics sometimes replace critical letters altogether in other logo designs.</p>
<p>i guess the point to focus on, is if something looks amateurish or not. if it looks like a mistake, or a weak point in the design, it is not the same thing as a well-executed graphic treatment of text, no?</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Tyler,</p>
<p>I think I may have noodled out some interesting solutions for you while munching on dinner&hellip;&hellip;.</p>
<p>First, yes it&rsquo;s a problem to assume recognizability in a word instead of paying close attention to the actual letterforms as they exist on the page. Our minds play all sorts of tricks on us, and often what we assume may be the only reading of something turns out to be open to many readings&hellip;.</p>
<p>This word in particular has few alternate readings though&hellip;..perhaps if someone was a big mythology buff, they may see Zeus' wife Hera, but probably not. Still, you can make the word more legible as is by:</p>
<p>ROUNDING THE COUNTER of the &ldquo;O&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Instead of focusing on fixing the &ldquo;r&rdquo;, an easy solution to the legibility issue is simply to ignore the alignment with the crown&rsquo;s angle you were trying to repeat from the &ldquo;H&rdquo;. Once it&rsquo;s round, three things can happen:</p>
<ol>
<li>The letter is instantly &ldquo;O&rdquo;-ish because you read the counter before the form since it stretches up to the right so far.</li>
<li>An interesting help occurs for the &ldquo;r&rdquo;&hellip;..the counterform &ldquo;o&rdquo; also becomes a ball terminal for another &ldquo;r&rdquo; in the counterform!! Double the benefit&hellip;</li>
<li>The connection to the crown&rsquo;s angle can still be maintained by keeping the intersection of that angled line and the counterform as the &ldquo;spring point&rdquo; for the round counter.</li>
</ol>
<p>Now, on to the problem of tagline type:
I did several versions to show what I had in mind. Most are sans solutions and the last two are serifs.</p>
<ol>
<li>Close Call PM: techy video-game feel.</li>
<li>DIN: still techy, but more tailored and machined.</li>
<li>Briem Akademi: very video game score display-ish.</li>
<li>Charlemagne + Chapparal: You said you wanted the &ldquo;kingy&rdquo; aspects of Trajan&hellip;..Charlemagne is a little spikier and plays on the crown idea&hellip;.but for those spikes to still read in the smaller company name, I used Chapparal.</li>
<li>Scala + Scala Sans: Still the spiky, thorny, crown reference, but more modern and engineered&hellip;.and interesting &ldquo;W&rdquo; in the company name sans version.</li>
</ol>
<p>Gotta get back to &ldquo;real&rdquo; work,
Cheers and Happy Holidays!

<p>He should probably give up on the symmetry and look at it with the bottom flattened out, the capital &ldquo;R&rdquo; you suggested, and leave the &ldquo;O&rdquo; be off center to the right.
