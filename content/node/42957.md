  body: "I noticed it, too. My first thought was Stag, but remarkably enough, the
    magazine actually mentioned the new type on the index page. \"About the Type:
    In this issue we introduce a new typeface for use in headlines, subheads and captions.
    It's called Sunday. Commissioned by The New York Times Magazine for our exclusive
    use, Sunday was drawn by the type designers Eric Olson and Nicole Dotin of the
    <a href=http://processtypefoundry.com/>Process Type Foundry</a>.\"\r\n\r\nIt's
    used all over the cover and throughout, but I don't have a scanner available right
    now to demonstrate. It's looking great, maybe a bit like Stag Sans mixing with
    Klavika's squareness."

  body: I just saw it in the mag and wondered too. At first I thought Fedra Sans but
    of course it's custom and now that I look at Fedra there isn't that much of a
    resemblance.
