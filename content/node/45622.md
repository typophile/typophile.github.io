body: This is a birthday card I made for a girl I liked quite a bit. I went with the
  circles because they remind me of being welcomed because of how they envelop you.
  I feel a darker color would have been nice to bring more attention to the welcoming
  nature of it all. I also chose the word joy because she is one of the happiest people
  I have ever met. and finally I chose the colors I did because those are the colors
  I think of when I think of her, she has long blond hair and bright baby blue eyes,
  that is also why it is shaped like an eye. let me know what you think, appreciated![img:sites/default/files/old-images/Picture2-1_6151.png]
