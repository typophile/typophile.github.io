    sans like those used for uniqlo etc but they don''t sit well. Any ideas are most
    welcome. '

  body: "Perhaps my typographic meeting between East and West could fit? It's like
    a western typeface with a twist of curry in it (if you want, OpenType-features
    available)\r\n\r\nIt is also brand new, please have a look at Shabash Pro:\r\n\r\nhttp://autodidakt.se/index.php?page=shabash\r\n\r\n-

  body: "Well, I know chinese people have a great love for the shapes of letters and
    are more sensitive to beautiful typography - I imagine that would be a theme throughout
    asian countries whose scripts have a long history with the brush.\r\n\r\nWhat
    if you were to incorporate some big, bold typograhy, and then something current
    and beautiful for the body copy.\r\n\r\nI don't think you should make the thing
    look 'asian' per se, I can see how some might be put off by that.  Make it look
    beautiful and I'm sure they will appreciate it!"

    a unicase, it's somewhat contemporary.\r\nAs a monowidth, single height face,
    it has an \"ideogrammatic\" cadence.\r\nPlenty of styles.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
