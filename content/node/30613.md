body: "I am working on reducing file size for thousands of insurance related PDF documents
  which are downloaded from a server to the clients numerous workstations for large
  batch printing of these forms. \r\n\r\nI did not design the forms, Ive just been
  asked to get in to Acrobat or wherever and make them smaller.\r\n\r\nOne concern
  is if I can somehow not embed the standard fonts that are used (Times and Arial).
  Being that these exist natively on all of the users workstations it's seems to be
  unneccesary file size. \r\n\r\nAny idea on how to \"un embed\" these fonts. . .
  or other good file downsizing tricks. . .\r\n\r\n(each PDF is an average of 170
  kb and they want it even smaller)\r\n\r\nCheers\r\n\r\nJames"

    Forums</a>. I posted to the scripting area and had an answer--which worked like
    butter--in 10 minutes.

  body: "Don't know about Mac, but on a PC, launch the Distiller. In the \"Job Options\"
    drop down, select the job you're using (e.g., Print, Screen) and then go to Settings
    > Job Options > Fonts. Uncheck the \"Embed all fonts\" box. Click on the \"Embedding\"
    drop down to get to your font location(s) -- for example, C:\\Windows\\Fonts.
    Add Times New Roman and Arial (and any other fonts you want) to the \"Never embed\"
    list. (If the font isn't in one of the listed folders, click on \"Add Name\" and
    type in the name of the font.) Click \"OK\" as needed to back out and save the
    changes to the job setting. You probably want to rename the job setting -- e.g.,
    \"Print(1)\" -- if Distiller doesn't offer to do it for you.\r\n\r\nThis is based
    on Acrobat 5, but later versions should be similar."

  body: "Re other ways to reduce file size:\r\n\r\n1. Don't embed thumbnails.\r\n\r\n2.
    Reduce the resolution (dpi) to as low as possible.\r\n\r\n3. Try distilling the
    source file with and without \"Optimize for Fast Web View\" enabled to see which
    gives you smaller PDFs. In my situation (MS Office files), not having fast web
    view enabled usually results in smaller files, but only by a little (1% or less).\r\n\r\nAll
    of the above options can be changed in the Distiller by going to Settings > Job
    Options > General. You can also try playing with the settings on the \"Compression\"
    tab, but I've never done so, so I have no recommendations for that.\r\n\r\n4.
    If there are TIFF or EPS graphics in the source files, try changing them to PNG
    or JPG and/or reducing the resolution. Of course, this may not be practical if
    you have thousands of source files. \r\n\r\n5. Not applying security or a password
    to a PDF file usually results in an infinitesimally smaller file.\r\n\r\n6. If
    you open a PDF file in Acrobat and do a \"save as\" (don't change anything in
    the file, just write over the existing file -- or, safer, give it a new file name),
    Acrobat will often produce a smaller file. Again, this may not be practical with
    thousands of files, although it might be possible to write an Acrobat batch process
    to do it.\r\n"
