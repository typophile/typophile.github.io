  body: "Released in 1948 in the era of great show-card lettering.\r\nCompare your
    first image with this style sample for lettering artists:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/LoadedBrushScript2_4959.jpg]\r\nThere
    are quite a few digitized brush script fonts but none is a perfect match. The
    closest I was able to find to the tone and general feel of your first image is
    Signalist by Mike Melvas:\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/mika-melvas/signalist/\r\nThere
    are also two fairly close fonts from Filmotype:\r\nFilmotype Lakeside:\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/filmotype/lakeside/\r\nand
    \r\nFilmotype Lasalle:\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/filmotype/lasalle/\r\nLasalle
    is also available from Scangraphic and Elsner+Flake.\r\nBTW the lettering artists
    for Unfaithfully Yours were busy. They also produced a third version of the movie
    title:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/UnfaithfullyYours1948_4_4669.jpg]\r\nDon"
