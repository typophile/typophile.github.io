  to a recruitment agency specialising in engineering, architecture and constructions.\r\n\r\nTheir
  current logo (mis)uses Bauhaus. [attached]\r\nIt's probably okay for the mark, but
  definitely doesnt work for the company name at small type sizes, not surprising
  for a display face.\r\n\r\nThere are a few key considerations:\r\n<ol><li>It must
  be legible across print and web delivery, specifically at small sizes in newsprint.</li>\r\n<li>They
  dont want to move too far from the existing design - they want me to 'clean up the
  mark and use a typeface that is more legible'</li>\r\n<li>The new logo will set
  the scene for a mini-branding in a few months, where a new website and stationary
  will be produced.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\nFor newsprint ad campaigns, so far I've mainly
  used DIN for display settings and Oficina Sans for body setting.\r\n\r\nI know its
  seen as a cliche to use 'square sans' typefaces like DIN and Meta for engineering/architecture
  firms, but given the requirements, I think this is a fitting direction that is not
  likely to upset a fairly conservative client.\r\n\r\nSo far i'm looking at:\r\n<a
  href=\"http://www.processtypefoundry.com/typefaces/klavika/index.html\">Klavika</a>\r\nBecause
  its handsome looking, will print well on web-offset, and offers a lot of weights
  and variations which should make light work of stationary design later.\r\n\r\n<a
  href=\"http://www.processtypefoundry.com/typefaces/locator/index.html\">Locator</a>\r\nFor
  similar reasons to Klavika, except that I think this looks too much like a Real-Estate
  magazine face.\r\n\r\nAnyone have any other suggestions, or thoughts on my direction
  so far?\r\nBTW, i didn't design the original logo!\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nJonny"

    b in the current positions and use a typeface with ascenders any longer than are
    presently in use, you are in danger of having a logo that will be reminiscent
    of the male genitalia in a state of arousal!\r\n\r\nI noticed this only because
    I had a design student encounter something similar recently. "

  body: "Yes, that was my first thought too - very phallic! So it's not just me. I
    would say it's your duty to the client to tell them that has got to go. Nice looking,
    yes, but prone to reduce grown men and women to giggling.\r\n\r\nI would stay
    away from a lowercase logo in rounded fonts for this very reason. Unless perhaps
    you come up with a different placement of the \"d\" and \"b\", perhaps? Maybe
    joining the stems together, or placing one letter higher than the other? "

  body: "Yes, I agree with both of you, and it is indeed what I first thought when
    I saw the logo for the first time.  Let me say again, I didnt design this logo!\r\n\r\nI
    will have to bring this to their attention and leave it to them to decide.  \r\n\r\nI
    dont want to hijack this thread, but you might find the attached broadsheet banner
    advert [NX6043935.pdf] amusing.  Again, this advert was produced very much under
    duress.\r\n\r\nThat aside, any thoughts on typefaces?  Another idea is to use
    the a more decorative ampersand from another face with a square sans face.  But
    this is somewhat cliche too right?  You tell me!  This is my first commercial
    logo design gig, I'm  after all the input I can get.\r\n\r\nHopefully I'll be
    able to post something to critique shortly, but still planning at the moment.\r\n"

  body: "You could use an ampersand, but that would lose the reflective quality, maybe
    using the + sign would be more engineering/architecture etc. To that end I would
    choose Locator (or similar) because the characters have similar characteristics
    when reflected.\r\nTim"

    gotta go....\r\n\r\nI'll second Tim on Locator -- I think it strikes an appropriate
    tone for such a business.\r\n\r\nLinda"
