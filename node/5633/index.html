		<div class="commentbody">If they have up to date hardware and OS's (Mac OS or Windows) then either format should be fine for letters and in-house docs - although I'd suggest TrueType to remain consitent with the other fonts the users will be using. If they're running old versions of Windows then they'll be better off with TrueType -  avoiding the need for Adobe Type Manager. <BR> <BR>Cheers, Si</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Thomas, I think Si has a point and that it would indeed be relevant and helpful (though not, strictly speaking, <i>necessary</i>) for an organisation that is not design-centric to have a single font format that they use. <BR> <BR>The IT departments of many companies run at any one time a wide range of different operating systems, wether PC, Mac or Linux. With that, as you know, there are inherent problems to do with compatibility and licensing.  <BR> <BR>For example, let us suppose that a department has 23 PCs and 2 Macs. Assuming a font purchase is valid for 5 seats, a IT department that decides on Postscript fonts would need to buy 6 sets of licenses to cover 25 seats. But if the Macs were running MacOS X, which, of course, has the ability to use PC format TT fonts, they'd only need 5 sets of licenses, as there would be no &quot;lost&quot; licenses being paid for. <BR> <BR>And thats just one example, before we start talking about compatibility issues between different versions of the same operating systems, AKA earlier versions of Windows and PS fonts. <BR> <BR>Is that not one of the driving forces behind OT as a technology? Its not just fancypants typesetting for us type nerds, its compatibility and easier deployment for the rest of the world too. <BR> <BR>At this moment in time, in non-design environments, TT is a good choice for font deployment. But dont worry, we can but hope that OT will take over that mantle in time, and then every day will be the first day of spring, and every bird will have a new song to sing, etc etc <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif" ALT=":-&#41;" BORDER=0> <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif" ALT=":-&#41;" BORDER=0> <BR> <BR></div>

		<div class="commentbody">David, <BR> <BR>As long as they're running the correct operating systems, I still think it's not a big deal at all. However, it's true that Type 1 fonts are more complicated from a user perspective, thanks to the multiple files-per-font involved. <BR> <BR>For a long-term investment today, Type 1 is probably not the best idea, as it is starting to get a little elderly. Either TrueType or OpenType (of either flavor) is a better bet. <BR> <BR>On the side, the question was not asked about a mixed-platform environment, but just about PCs. Here, your example is flawed in a couple of ways. First, it assumes the licenses are platform-specific. I'm sure many are, but Adobe's for one are not, so there would never be lost licenses regardless. Second, the Mac users would still be mixing font formats: Windows TrueType fonts (or OpenType fonts) are not the same format as Mac TrueType fonts. <BR> <BR>If you want to use the same font files on both platforms, and you're using OS X on the Mac, and *only* with native OS X apps, then Windows TrueType or TrueType flavored OpenType is a fine option. <BR> <BR>If you want to use the same font files on both platforms, and you need them to work in Classic or Mac OS 8/9, then you need PostScript flavored OpenType fonts. If you're running an older Windows OS (NT 4, ME or earlier), then this will also mean you need ATM on Windows as well as on the Mac. <BR> <BR>Sigh. It does all get rather convoluted. <BR> <BR>Cheers, <BR> <BR>T</div>
