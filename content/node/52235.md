  body: Seriously look at a few snack logos, this is lacking and could be a pretty
    cool logo type, I dig your idea of using a character(s) as the icon maybe think
    about sticking with the standard 'y' and then adding an icon to represent (see/say)
    the plane.

    than the logotype. The logo is one day old and I was maybe too hasty in posting
    it in this forum but I do appreciate all your feedback. \r\nLet me add this in
    defense of a not-overly-stylized (\"snack-y\") solution: the logo is intended
    for corporate audience (the Lufthansas, Frito-Lays and Wrigleys of the world);
    the snacks that are passed around on the plane will naturally carry their own
    visual branding."

  body: the word sky is dwarfed by snacks. Also the plane does not seem to resemble
    anything now that it does not coincide with the typeface. It looks like a fallen

    work. It might've worked for a uncooked spaghetti sampling service  :) but I don't
    think it relates well to the 'snacks'.\r\n\r\nMark-wise - perhaps try playing
    with the actual sky/snacks letters to incorporate the plane and the concept of
    being elevated, munching, etc. Something like this, for example:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/snacks_5280.png]"
