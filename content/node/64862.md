body: "I have to make an ID guideline book, and I used a font that is called \"IncisSlab
  East\".\r\nMy problem is, that I searched over the internet for this font, but I
  have no result. :(\r\nI think, something is wrong with the font naming.\r\n\r\nWhat
  is very similar with this font is \"Antique Olive\" (what I found in my system).
  But it's not the same, because it's bolder then \"Incis\".\r\n\r\nSombody can help
  me? what could be the real name of the type (Incis)?\r\nattached is an image\r\n\r\nIs
  IncisSlab East exist? or... is a fake Antique Olive?\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    modification, or maybe nothing more than a renaming of another weight. The [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/urw/antique-olive/|URW
    version of Antique Olive]] has quite a few weights, including a Light. \r\n\r\n-

  body: "Bitstream was the company that originally digitized many older typefaces
    for foundries that at that time did not have the capability. Apparently one of
    the terms of their agreement with these foundries was that they could retain and
    market the design if they renamed it. Incised 901 is their name for Antique Olive.
    Tilde has apparently gotten into an arrangement with Bitstream where Tilde produces
    versions of these for extended language support (Florian explained this recently,
    I believe). URW, with their Ikarus system, was also one of the early digitizers,
    and by similar arrangement with other foundries they also marketed font designs
    by new names. For example, URW Palladio, and Paltus Antiqua were both names for
    URW versions of Palatino. Neither of these companies are stealing fonts, if that
    was your thought.\r\n\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
