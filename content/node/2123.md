  body: 'There are a couple of different ways to encode Supplementary Plane characters
    in fonts. <BR> <BR>The very latest version of FontLab &#40;4.6&#41; has a mechanism
    to write the appropriate format of cmap table; this mechanism obliges you to <i>name</i>
    glyphs using their Unicode 32bit scalar value, e.g. u20050. When generating the
    font, FontLab will read these glyph names and write the appropriate cmap table
    entries. Note that I have not tried this myself. <BR> <BR>Alternatively, you can
    pass your fonts through Microsoft&#39;s free VOLT tool. VOLT is intended for adding
    OpenType features to a font &#40;and you may need to add at least one feature:
    I&#39;ve never tried passing a font through VOLT without adding any features&#41;,
    but it also rewrites the cmap table. In VOLT&#39;s Glyph Edit window you can assign
    and edit Unicode values for individual; note, however, that in VOLT you need to
    use surrogate pairs for Supplementary Plane characters, not scalar values. <BR>
    <BR>You will probably find this <a href="http://trigeminal.com/16to32AndBack.asp">scalar&#60;-&#62;surrogate
    convertor</a> useful.'
