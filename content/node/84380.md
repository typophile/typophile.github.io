  the Unicode codepage containing script languages \u200B\u200Bsuch as [[http://unicode.org/charts/PDF/UA980.pdf|Javanese]],
  [[http://unicode.org/charts/PDF/U1A00.pdf|Buginese]], [[http://unicode.org/charts/PDF/U1B00.pdf|Balinese]]
  and [[http://unicode.org/charts/PDF/U1BC0.pdf|Batak]]? \r\n\r\nInitially I thought
  this might be treated like Cyrillic or Arabic were performing with Latin. But I
  guess this would be difficult to access directly through the keyboard, given the
  existing lack of keyboard support. But this is only conjecture. I can not imagine
  how the final form.\r\n\r\nSo far I use a [[http://www.dafont.com/ogiecappo-campotype.font|practical]]
  way to put the glyphs of scripts in a Latin position that can be accessed directly
  via keyboard. Although helpful, but I know this is a mistake. The script should
  remain on the codepoint which has been commissioned by the unicode.\r\n\r\nBest

  body: I'm not quite sure what the question is, since you are linking to the Unicode
    ranges that support these scripts and are aware of the necessary encodings. Are
    you asking about keyboard drivers (which are not connected to Fontlab)?

  body: "Thanks.\r\n\r\nThis involves a typeface design using the Buginese scripts,
    etc. (eg OT format in FL). The scenario goes something like the combined Latin
    and Buginese, as we know it on the application of Arabic + Latin. However, in
    the example of Buginese script that I ever created. This does not work properly
    if the Glyph Buginese placed in the specified range of Unicode.\r\n\r\nI still
    think that the range Unicode has been assigned to be used properly. But not sure
    if this can be programmed based on the specifications OT known today. For instance
    we create the behaviour in id script \"bugi\": \r\n<ol><code>feature locl {\r\nLanguage
    BUGI exclude_dflt;\r\n  sub @Latin_letter' by @Buginese;\r\n} locl;\r\n</code>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\nThis
    tag is only a simulation, and I'm not yet sure if the tags can work properly for
    the language.\r\n\r\nAnd finally, the application of the face results on the keyboard.
    It's the reason I associate with the keyboard at the beginning of the question.
    As far as I know, driver Microsoft windows doesn't yet support for such as Buginese.
    In the driver we can find support for Thai, CJK, Vietnamese, etc., but the Buginese
    and Javanese, not yet (?).  \r\n\r\nEven the Microsoft Font Validator still does
    not recognize bit 96 of the UnicodeRange field, officially defined for the Buginese
    block range (U+1A00..U+1A1F), and reports an error if this bit is set.\r\n\r\nIt
    really should not happen to the OS microsoft. But if the keyboard does not support.
    Is it still possible there is OT solution to this problem.\r\n\r\nBest regards"

  body: You will need custom keyboard drivers that will allow you to input the correct
    Unicode values. Note that since these languages may also require complex script
    shaping, being able to type them may not be sufficient, as the fonts will need
    OpenType or other layout tables and support from script shaping engines in the
    operating system or application.

    here: Isn\u2019t a driver something to make the hardware work in the first place?
    (Like, a sound card driver, for instance). I believe a specific keyboard layout
    ranges some levels above the actual keyboard driver, as it has nothing to do with
    the specific hardware used. Right?\r\n(I mean \u2013 you can use a keyboard layout

  body: I'd imagine a keyboard layout can do anything you'd wish; the hard bit might
    be finding enough people to test it. Batak at least is now remembered only by
    grandparents (which BTW is a fantastic reason to support the language on a computer).
    Best of luck.

  body: "<strong><em>@Bendy</em></strong> ... Absolutely right. \r\n\r\nBUGINESE,
    Javanese and Balinese have a little more fortunate \"destiny\", because this script
    is still living in the community. Users are also quite a lot. Although somehow
    educational policies and regulations of local governments to teach it in schools
    has not increased. Things I could mention a very important part of this script
    is a cultural presence, local wisdom or the values \u200B\u200Bof local genius
    contained therein. The role I might wake them up even from the \"far\". So as
    you say: <em>Best of luck</em> :-)\r\n\r\nMay we agree that the civilized nations
    advanced in Europe, America and Asia has reached its peak because of great respect
    for the values \u200B\u200Bof their local heritage, including literacy. As we
    see that the existence of Latin that we know today departs from a very long cultural
    history.\r\n\r\nBest regards"

    people started talking about 'custom keyboard drivers' because the term 'layout'
    is ambiguous as to whether it refers to the design of the key assignments or to
    their software implementation."
