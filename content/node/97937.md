    body: "DPape,\r\nThanks so much! How did you get the CarbSmart to italicize with
      the \"a\" in its present form? \r\n\r\nOn fonts.com, Fertigo Regular has the
      correct \"a\". But it's upright without a slant.\r\n\r\nIf I use Fertigo Italicized,
      the \"a\" shifts\" to having only 1 level.\r\n\r\nAlso, do you have any idea
      about the tagline font? Is it Corbel Italic, do you think?\r\n\r\nThank you
      SOOO much for your help. I spent all day trying to figure out this font!\r\n\r\n(Do
      you think they used Fertigo Regular and then applied the Shear Tool in AI? To
      do a fake italics?)\r\n\r\nSusie"

  body: "Renaissance Man thanks for the confirmation! That's what I figured - the
    designer used Fertigo Regular and added a manual skew to the font.\r\n\r\nThanks
    so much for your help and that of DPape!\r\n\r\nMUAH!\r\n\r\nAnd the tagline is
    definitely Corbel Italic! Yippee!\r\n\r\nS"
