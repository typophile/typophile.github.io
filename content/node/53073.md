    add to a headline, assuming the head isn\u2019t set in caps. Of course, Typefaces
    I can think of where this wouldn\u2019t work are faces that probably shouldn\u2019t
    have old-style figures to begin with.\r\n2. I generally find the circular zero
    to be silly and pedantic. How often is someone likely to confuse a zero with an
    o? I\u2019m sure it made working with metal type easy, but I just don\u2019t see
    why the circle zero hangs on in modern use. \r\n3. See answer no. 2. "

  body: "I've personally never understood why the OSF zero must be <em>that</em> circular
    and unstressed.* The contrast to the other letters/numerals often seems overly
    emphasized, and I must admit it really bothers me in FF Reminga too. I'm with
    James on this: How often is the reader really prone to confuse 0 and o \u2013
    and does this justify the <em>huge</em> contrast that sets the zero apart from
    the <em>entire rest</em> of a typeface like this one? (I feel it makes the zero
    look like a very special symbol; not like a numeral.)\r\n\r\nThat said, considering
    your point #1, Nick, I'd probably use lining figures for headlines anyway. It
    depends on the face, though, and of course on the application. I also like those
    'hybrid' numerals that are kind of halfway OSFs. (Is there a more sensical name
    for those?)\r\n\r\n* In fact, this was among my first big typographic enigmas
    in my childhood reading days, along with the \"ft\" ligature in some text faces
    that looks like a wonky A, and the bicameral g's that I thought were dingbats
    for glasses."

    That's why the earliest forms of typographic zero are the contrastless circle.
    The advent of the concept of zero was a remarkable development in mathematics.
    Zero is magical, and in fact not like other numerals.\r\n\r\nThat said, I'm certainly

  body: "My Neoritmo design is based entirely on this idea of having some key letters
    unstressed, others modulated, and a few a combination of the two. Inspiration
    came in part from the lighter weights of the typeface Stempel Schneidler (where
    the [O] and [Q] are almost monotonal).\r\n\r\nTo obtain a satisfacory balance
    in such a design idea has been very difficult, since the number of monotonal letters
    needs to be limited, and well-balanced, and of course in some languages this may
    prove more or less 'disturbing'.\r\n\r\nI recall the monotonal zero in text types
    used to puzzle me, but then I came to really enjoy it, since I put a lot of importance
    on numerals, and I am fascinated by them, and most of those things, if well done,
    go completely unnoticed by the average reader.\r\n\r\nEDIT: An \"alpha\" of Neoritmo
    (including a preliminary Greek version) can be seen in the [[http://www.benaki.gr/index.asp?lang=en|Benaki

  body: And I think that a reverse-contrast zero, rather than a silly, open manhole,
    is a better zero, albeit would look equally silly as well if not subtle. Or just
    make it like an 'o'. Lowercase 'o's and zeroes don't get confused when used in
    book faces; they're confused in monospaced typefaces built for programming.

    also to say we have alphabets (like Futura) which use almost the same form for
    [l], [I], or Gill Sans which uses similar forms for [l], [I], [1], and in Futura
    the repetitive sequence of \"circles\" produces way more problem than this \u201Czero\"

    so \u2013 particular as it may be \u2013 the overall consistency makes the [0]
    look less \"chosen\" just to differentiate.\r\nAn interesting example is Frank
    Heine's Tribute, where different modulation choices are made all over the letter
    range. If he avoided some excessive forms (like [g]) it would be great as a text
