  contenders. Is it just me, or is anyone else diggin' Obama's website, typography,
  and overall design aesthetics?! Granted, they may be going a bit overboard with
  all of the 2.0-ish reflections and what not. But if you compare these websites...
  I don't know, it's a dramatic difference. Some serious subtlety over at barackobama.com.
  All politics aside of course. \r\n\r\nhttp://hillaryclinton.com/\r\n\r\nhttp://www.johnedwards.com/\r\n\r\nhttp://johnmccain.com/\r\n\r\nhttp://mittromney.com/\r\n\r\nhttp://www.mikehuckabee.com/\r\n\r\nhttp://www.dennis4president.com/\r\n\r\nhttp://www.barackobama.com/\r\n"

    identity, and his website is really beautiful. His logo is so popular it's been
    made into jewelry and sold on ebay, and I actually met a woman who had it tattooed!
    (How's THAT for a moonbat, Rodrigue?)\r\n\r\nAK"

    link was so out of place. \r\n\r\nI hardly think a tattoo of a pol is wise, but
    I do like tattoos on women, And Alaskan, my wife has tattoos (A Christian with
    tattoos):)\r\n\r\nI think Obamas got the best type of any Democrat in a long time,
    but when the content does not match the packaging, it could get real ugly, real
    quick.\r\n\r\n\r\nSimon, if you are going to be witty, you need some, uh, wit.
