body: "Hi,\r\n\r\nI'm looking for a font that is similar to Austin.  For reference,
  I've attached a sample.  I've contacted Commercial Type for licensing inquiries
  but in the meantime I'm looking for a close cousin.  Any thoughts?  Thank you!"

    If it's the swashy italic you're after we'd have different suggestions.\r\n\r\nBut
    really, go with Commercial. No one will do better than Christian Schwartz."

  body: Thanks for your suggestions!  I'm just impatient and was looking around, but
    I couldn't find anything similar enough.  I guess it is really unique!  Haven't
    heard from Commercial yet but I'm sure they'll get back to me today - again, just
    really impatient. ;)
