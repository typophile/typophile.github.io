  around 110 pages in total. I would like to flow the text but break the thread between
  each chapter. The only way I know is to copy and paste each section separately from
  the text file, but that means I can't use the \"Link Text files\" feature. Another
  option would be to divide the text file into several documents, one for each chapter,
  but it seems a bit backwards. The reason I want the text to be linked is that I'm
  expecting some changes from the publisher along the way. What is the best way to
  go about it?\r\n\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\n\r\nJonatan"

    not yet figured out how to divide a document into sections without reflowing the
    text. My text is in a single Word document."

  body: "If your source is a single text document, you cannot get it into InDesign
    other than as a single text document ... Although you <em>can</em> cut-and-paste
    it into separate sections, ID will loose the ability to update all of them by
    something like \"remembering\" where you cut and pasted.\r\n\r\nThe Book suggestion
    is an excellent one, as you don't have to worry about the number of pages per
    chapter. However, to have each and every separate document still linked to \"an\"
    original Word one, you will have to save the individual chapters as individual
    Word files. Nothing backwards about that -- you have one file or you have many.\r\n\r\nIs
    it really that crucial to always be able to update the text in Word? Every single
    edit action in InDesign, be it formatting, styling, or inserting a soft hyphen
    to prevent an ugly word break, will disappear as soon as you update the text.
    I suggest either to submit the Word document to your publisher and edit until
    it's <em>really</em> ready to be put into InDesign, or do the lay-out and subsequent
    editing in InDesign itself."

  body: "You're right. The updating is not always that crucial and for this job I
    can solve it with the cut-and-paste method. But the ability to break threads between
    text boxes without reflowing could sometimes be quite useful.\r\n\r\nMany thanks,\r\n\r\nJonatan"
