  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Typophile is a discussion forum, but you’d never know it from the <a href="http://typophile.com/" title="Typophile.com">homepage</a>, a baffling and angering display of Flashturbation from a junior Web designer with a point to make that even he can’t articulate properly.

Seriously: Safari 4 takes 28 seconds to load <em>just the Flash component</em> of the homepage. (I paused my stopwatch when the animated logotype, another useless and unwanted fillip, stopped moving.) You are then presented with an interface, using custom scrollbars and jammed into a little rectangle, to what appears to be the actual purpose of the site – discussion. Select an item and whaddya know – you’re sent away to the actual forum, built mostly around HTML. (Actually, it should be entirely HTML, CSS, and JavaScript; there is no cause for Flash, save perhaps for sIFR.)

What should the new homepage look like? It should look like the homepage of a site whose owners aren’t trying to show off and who actually want visitors to understand and use the site. The homepage should <em>be</em> <a href="http://typophile.com/forum/" title="/forum/">the Forums page</a>. Hire somebody like Jason Santa Maria or Zeldman or Andy Clarke or Simplebits to work on it. But nearly anything would be better than the Flash monstrosity we’re stuck with now.</div>

   <div class="comment card m-3">

		<div class="commentbody">I've never understood why so much of the site relies on Flash. I never go to the home page, so that's not an issue for me, but, for example, the links along the top and the search box are simply gone if I view the site on my iPhone. Using Flash for such basic site elements seems pointless.

The funny thing is that apparently I never, or rarely ever, use those parts of the site. I actually had to look at the site on my iPhone to see if they were there or not.

I think it's also interesting (and perhaps telling) that the ads on the right side, which is usually where you see Flash used on other sites, rely on Javascript instead. So, I do get to see those on my iPhone (not that I'm complaining about that).</div>

Yes, sure, it'd be nice if the hard working people that build, run, host, and maintain this free site did all the little things we request, but I'm not going to start a SPAM campaign to bring the site down because I can't figure out how bookmarks in my browser work. 

BUT...since you brought up the door analogy...that's how houses work. The front door looks all nice and pretty but everyone used the back door as it's simply more practical and closer to the kitchen where all the action is. </div>

Joe, as usual, is technically correct. Joe, as usual, doesn't seem to have much interest in having civil discussions on Typophile, though, and instead prefers to use passive aggressive quoting and demand that it's his way or no way.

Which, to me, in my humble little opinion, seems stupid.

		<div class="commentbody">I've gotten used to most of the web allowing ctrl-clicking to open links in a new tab. It's frustrating  to be prevented from doing so here so I've mainly switched the RSS & Google Reader. Every time I visit, the front page, I forget and I try to ctrl click a post heading. If I want to open a new instance of Typophile, I can't ctrl click the logo or anything at the top. I actually have to start a new tab, find my shortcut and open a new instance.

I don't use the forums page because it's not very useful either. I think the average out-of-the-box web forum, while perhaps not as pretty as Typophile would serve visitors better.

Usually I use RSS and Google Reader because it's easier and faster.</div>

The fact that one can’t CTRL-click neither the several topics nor the logo/links at the top is annoying indeed.

Plus, from time to time, after a long time of loading, the front page appears in the *featured-face-view*, i.e. I have to click the upward-pointing arrow at the bottom to view the topics.

I tried to use the forum page as a starting point but I missed the clarity of the front page.

An alternative, similar structured front page without flash would be a huge improvement.</div>

It is hard to separate the substance of Joe's posts from the rather mean-spirited way in which they're crafted. Often, one wishes Joe would just go away.

With respect to the home page, I may be in the minority, but overall I like it. Believe it or not, I always go there first, to see what's newest, and what's hottest. Also, I like the way it looks. I am neither baffled nor angered by it.

I do agree with Joerg though- a similarly structured front page, implemented with more friendly technologies, would almost certainly be an improvement. </div>

Joe Clark, as a usability/accessibility/web standards pundit and evangelist, is definitely someone to listen too. 

It's sad his valid points are wrapped up in such a offensive and egotistical personality.

Actually, the opposite is the case. One of the key advances of Western civilization was Socrates' idea that critical discussion can move us closer to the truth. 

Pedantry happens when fresh insights ossify into rigid classifications. While this happens in every tradition, only the West has had the critical tradition to continually revitalize its thinking by breaking out of old categories. The critical tradition has helped to generate the outstanding dynamism and creativity of Western thought and civilization since the renaissance—when the critical tradition was revived.  </div>

The non-Western tradition of nondual thinking, nonattachment to dogma, accepting interpersonal diversity, maintaining harmony and experiencing one's experience of the world without judgment is equally precious. It's important not to get too attached to what we think. The difficult thing is knowing when to follow which path, I'd say.</div>

That's not true. Non-western traditions are more consistently dogmatic. 

China censors the internet not because of Marx, but because of Chinese tradition, which sees disagreement and argument as disturbing harmony. We value open discussion and argument, and so invented web forums like this one. The leaders in China want to shut it down because they don't believe in the value of critical discussion. 

In that respect Western tradition is better.

Nobody here will agree with me--except those who actually know Confucian tradition--not because they have a deep knowledge of Confucian tradition, but because they hold to the fashionable and in my view shallow denigration of Western tradition. 
 
I think Western tradition is better in some ways, and worse in others than Confucian tradition.

But if I have a different opinion it's because I'm dogmatic and rigid, right? It couldn't possibly be because I know what I'm talking about, right?

>It's dangerous ethnocentrism to say one culture is better than another.

Well, you were willing to say that East and West are equally valuable--even though they contradict each other at points--and different eastern traditions conflict with one another also. I don't think that can fly. It sounds good, but closes the door to really learning the strengths and weaknesses of different traditions.

And I don't think it's ethnocentricism. The critical tradition can look at multiple traditions and critically compare them--as well as being self critical. That's its power, which the others don't have.  

Buddhism has a lot of personal tolerance in it. But it never had a social or political doctrine, as far as I know. In China traditional social and political doctrine is Confucian, and Confucianism, while deeply humane, is equally deeply authoritarian. The censoring of the internet is Confucian to the core. 

By the way, is the censoring of the internet equally as good as not censoring it, Ben?

Or are you willing to be "ethnocentric" on that one?</div>

Sooner or later, China will see the light and Westernize on this. In other words, they will see that their traditions are hampering them, and Western openness is better for their people and their society.

I like the homepage! 

Especially the effect of the receding posts. Very temporal. I like the three columns of what's happen'. But I'm not too keen on the flash thing in the top left corner. It's action is too distracting - but I do like the idea of showing different T. That reminds, I should do one.

It takes my 'puter about 1 (or less) second to load the front page. I'm on a Windows platform using the latest Firefox browser.

***

Back onto the Metaphysical(?)...

To me the West - and in particular the USA - set the example of being an Individual. With Individual rights and freedoms for all to pursue equally. I don't know where in the discussion that belongs, but it is by far the most crucial property. To encourage the pursuit of an Idea to the fullest - defines Democracy itself. Anything short of that seems to me to limit what it is to be human.

Seems almost pathetic the amount of intellectual property that has been ripped off by the East. Defining not only their lack of respect but underscores how wanting their societies truly are. 

I believe the internet - in it's current state - to be part of those crucial Individual freedoms. Although it didn't quite start out that way.

>you were willing to say that East and West are equally valuable--even though they contradict each other at points

Of course, that's equality and diversity. Having spent a good many years in Asia (not China), I can see good and bad things about both East and West, and in my experience neither comes out on top. In fact there are things about which I hold contradictory opinions, yet Western rationalism disallows that. True or false, right or wrong, good or bad. In my experience, Eastern philosophy does a better job of being non-dogmatic than Western philosophy, which I've also studied for many years. Sometimes that's a useful thing, sometimes it isn't.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Ben, is there even a concept of "tolerance" of those with conflicting views in the East? I mean not just personal tolerance--which Buddhism has--but with groups and political ideas. 

In Confucian tradition, so far as I've experienced it, there is one right way, and if you're not with it, shut up. 

In the West, you can have contradictory opinions, but they can't all be right, if you follow logic. That discomfort with contradictions is a spur to trying to figure where you are right and wrong. Otherwise, it seems to me you license complacency and stagnation. 

Peace through force is the traditional way in China. The supreme value is harmony, and to get that you suppress opposition. You don't want to connect it to Chinese tradition. Ok what's it connected to? Why don't they have it in those Eastern countries more affected by the West?

I think history shows that traditions are tremendously powerful. If not the traditional idea that harmony is paramount and all conflict bad, what is responsible for censorship in China? After all, in many ways their government has been one of the most successful in the world. It's not like they are otherwise stupid or unsophisticated--quite the contrary. 

5star, I agree with you about individual freedom being precious, and that being distinctively Western. However, I think that current Western individualism, especially in the US, is excessive. The sense of social responsibility has declined in my life time, and I think that's a very bad thing. 

When I was in China, some things I really loved as far better than what we have in the US. One was the quality of deep friendship, which was really striking. Another is the courtesy and affability of interaction. That is such a welcome relief compared to the rudeness of so many Americans. </div>

Certain schools of Theravada Buddhism across much of Southeast Asia accept different ideologies, and even welcome discourse with other ideologies, knowing its teachings are not 'truth', since what we think is only what we think. And you're right because people do criticise it for not being moralistic enough. But at least in my view it is not concerned so much with political ideas, arguments and the right/wrong dichotomy, as it's more a mental science showing us how we can get on with our lives and interact positively and peacefully with others whatever their beliefs.

It's certainly connected, but I don't want to judge a whole tradition I don't understand.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Ben, I agree with you that we can learn a lot from the psychological insights of Buddhism—I certainly have. Also I think they are stronger on compassion than Judaism and Christianity, even though both of those have compassion as a prime value. 

However, Buddhism has had some key weaknesses, both of which relate to passivity. The goal of avoiding suffering brings you away from the world, as a monk on a mountain top, whereas the commitments of Judaism and Christianity to pursuit of justice, to family and work, are more engaged with life. Also Buddhism never had the tradition of the Prophets, of social change and increasing social justice. Even though Christianity lived for very long with Feudalism, eventually the prophetic imperative re-asserted itself in the renaissance and the age of reason, and we are much the better for it. 

The social weakness of Buddhism and its lack of impact on social tolerance is seen in the civil war in Sri Lanka. The British had favored the Tamil minority, I believe, during their rule. In reaction, the Buddhist majority after independence imposed a Sinhala only rule--only the language of the Buddhist majority would be permitted. This act of intolerance--the Tamil minority was 30%--was followed by other anti-Tamil actions, which eventually led to the horrible civil war. I don't want to defend the actions of the Tamil Tigers, who I believe invented suicide bombing. But the behavior of the Buddhists--also Theravada--do nothing to say that Buddhists are more tolerant of minorities than we are in the West. 

Of course, in the West, even the ideas of tolerance developed in Holland and England and eventually America did not stop a lot of horrible treatment of minorities, but still it was created a persistent voice for tolerance, which over time has often succeeded.

That has not been my experience of Buddhism. What I've learnt is that suffering is an integral part of reality, and accepting it means we are less conflicted with ourselves and therefore better able to shine. Certainly non-attachment is helpful in getting a clear, positive mind. But that's not the same as avoidance. One can even directly confront a political idea without being attached to one's own fixed view.

>Buddhism has had some key weaknesses, both of which relate to passivity

This sounds quite general. Different Buddhists interpret the teachings differently. The three jewels of the Buddhism I know are the Buddha, his teachings and the community. That last one to me means the people around us are an important part of engaging in life. If there's any weakness in Buddhism, it's the freedom to believe only what's true in one's own experience. That is also its great strength.

I'd also like to point out that there are ways to engage with life other than 'pursuit of justice, [and commitments] to family and work'. Are animals less engaged with life? They're certainly less engaged in our ideas about life, but why should our ideas apply to them?

I'm not trying to say any philosophy, religion or system of government is perfect: in fact I started by saying that all ways have good and bad aspects, and I said what I liked about Eastern tradition. All those factors have flipsides, as you have pointed out. Things can go wrong, equally in the East and the West.</div>

I was just entranced by the history of one Mongol Khan who converted to Buddhism, though not completely as evidenced by the account of his funeral which included human sacrifice. So, I am wondering as Bendy fails to suggest, if Buddhism is like all the others, just a word for another problem with the 'home page'?

		<div class="commentbody">Ben, what book on Buddhism would you recommend that gives the different views?

My impression of the passivity of Buddhism come from [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four_Noble_Truths|the four noble truths]] that are at the foundation of Buddhism, which I understand as roughly: 1. Life is suffering. 2. Suffering is caused by attachment. 3. Cease attachment and cease suffering. 4. The way to cease attachment is to follow the eightfold path. The goal seems to be to avoid suffering, which is a different priority than "Love your neighbor as yourself." and "Justice, justice shall you pursue." 

I do agree with you that "things go wrong." I find that what a person makes of his religion is in the end more important than the theology or metaphysics in it. And you can have a Buddhist and Christian who resemble one another more in their attitudes than they do many of their coreligionists. For all I know Joe Clark is a devoted Buddhist :) 

Still, the ethical priorities and content are of the different traditions are different, and I'm interested in the truth. That's why I focus on differences and try to sort out what's right. I don't think they are all the same, and I want to know their strengths and weaknesses. 

What I find irritating is the reflex, and to me shallow, statement "East is better," which set me off here. Your views are obviously well informed by familiarity, and you have a nuanced view of what is strong and weak. Thanks for your insights about relying only on your own experience. That's the kind of thoughtful assessment that I like, not the reflex lack of appreciation for one's own traditions, and fashionable lauding of what is exotic to you as automatically "deep."</div>

>I find that what a person makes of his religion is in the end more important than the theology or metaphysics in it.

Absolutely. Glad we have the same view here :)

As for books on Buddhism, I'm afraid my conception has been informed by experience not by reading words. There's a large gap between the two, which is why I tend to have a healthy disregard to anyone waving books around and saying they're Truth. I have lived as a Buddhist at times in my life, listened to monks and read books, but to be honest, the books I've read have been anecdotal and confusing. Thai monk Buddhadasa had some very interesting (unconventional) interpretations which you might be lucky enough to come across, if you're interested.

>1. Life is suffering. 2. Suffering is caused by attachment. 3. Cease attachment and cease suffering. 4. The way to cease attachment is to follow the eightfold path. The goal seems to be to avoid suffering,

Well, it depends which way you look at it, and there are many ways to word it. Here's my take. Number 1 means that some kind of imperfection permeates our whole existence and experience of reality. It's the same for everyone, and animals included. We can't avoid that suffering. We get hungry, cold, sick, old, bored, uncomfortable, change happens... Number 2 says that we add a whole new dimension to our suffering (which the animals don't) by adding an ego into the equation. Suddenly 'imperfect reality' becomes 'this is bad and it's happening to me'. When we start judging and wanting and not wanting, we set ourselves against the way things just are. The last two two clear up the mess that ego brought. 

When investigated thoroughly, Buddhism is surprisingly non-exotic, simply seeking to explain the way the real world is and how we experience it. (And I know this might be a non-standard way of interpreting it, but again it works for me and other Buddhists.)

Interesting how this thread has developed. Thank you too. Now I wonder where Joe's got to.

		<div class="commentbody">If you want to read books about spiritual philosophies don't read the "scriptures", read the artists. So for Zen Buddhism I would suggest Li Po, Wang Wei, or Tu Fu if you like longer poetry. These are also Chinese poets. Li Po was a notorious drinker and is probably the most "out there". Wang Wei was the gentlest, and Tu Fu was the middle of the road sober poet.

If you prefer shorter poetry begin with Basho and the haikuists of Japan.

If possible get poetry that is translated by Lucien Stryk.

All my understanding of spiritual matters comes from art. Sufi music, Zen poetry, Mass in Bb Minor, St Marks Cathedral, throat singing from Tuva, shakuhachi, etc…

It makes more sense to me than the direct writings.

		<div class="commentbody">A typical aspect of Western civilisation is the disability of ceasing to think comparative and hierarchical. Other cultures are either seen as (morally) “superior” (see Rousseau, or more updated, Cameron’s “Avatar”) or “inferior”. Democracy and capitalism are seen as the Holy Grail for mankind as a whole.

In our naïveté, we tend to believe that OUR political system is the closest to creation’s crowning glory. We can’t even imagine what a mammoth like China would turn into if it allowed e.g. boundless freedom of speech.

Social systems are too complex for a cock comparison contest. Instead of learning from the terrible consequences of proselytisation e.g. in Africa, we still try to force our ideals on other civilisations. When the whole experiment fails, we can still steal away.

The drive of interference is a great tool for self-improvement within a society, i.e. when used in one’s own hood. It easily turns into a curse when exploited for a bossy missionary zeal.

What brings us back to the guy who brought this up and his not unreasonable objections, brought forward in a rather bossy and clumsy manner.</div>
