body: "I may be a bit vague here, but I'm searching for a word to describe a particular
  concept: The abstract idea about how a grapheme is formed, i.e., the conception
  about what elements of a grapheme are essential to its identity. A direct graphical
  representation of this \"idea\" shows the grapheme in its most basic, neutral form.
  (This is something that may very well change over time, which frequently leads to
  the birth of allographs, or even new alphabets.)\r\n\r\nAn example: The modern grapheme
  \"P\" can be described as a vertical line, to which a closed semicircle is attached
  at the top, to the right. This is, I think you all agree, the natural, most neutral
  form. However, this was not always so: originally, the P is related to the Greek
  \u03A0, with the difference that the Italic (pre-classical) \u03A0 had a shorter
  descender to the right (i.e. a form half way between \u03A0 and \u0393. This was
  frequently rounded, but almost always with a large opening at the bottom:\r\n\r\nhttp://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Image:Polla_via_popilia_da_reggio_a_capua.jpg\r\n\r\nOver
  time, this opening gradually became smaller and smaller:\r\n\r\nhttp://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Image:Sol_Serapis.jpg\r\n\r\nAnd
  today, the normal form (ask any child) is with a closed semi-circle. The open form
  is still a perfectly valid glyph-variant, no question about that, but the closed
  form is what is regarded as the \"essential\" P.\r\n\r\nNow, what is it that has
  changed? The P-grapheme's \"morphology\"? Its \"topology\"? Is there a standard
  term for this concept?\r\n"

  body: Thank you. But, is that an established term for this concept? I just more
    or less made it up, you see. Might there be another word I haven't heard about
    that would be better?

  body: You didn't mention the Etruscan language (ca. 650 B.C.) ; morphological changes
    in 'P' could be coherent to its bi[p]olarity in the languages, from "[p]ous-[p]ed-[p]es"
    to "su[p]erior-u[p]-loo[p]." Sure if it was a stylistic variation it was visible
    in its form.

    and using his background in linguistics to provide analytical and terminological
    tools to systematically describe writing systems (particularly Arabic). I'll alert
    him to this thread.\r\n\r\nMorphology or morphography seem like a good candidates
    to me. Ontology is concerned with existence in a metaphysical sense, not with
    form or structure, so doesn't seem appropriate in this context."

  body: "As a linguist, I would find the term 'morphology' (or 'morphography') highly
    counterintuitive if used in this way, despite the fact that it may seem to make
    sense from an etymological standpoint -- both suggest combining graphemes into
    larger units (for instance, forming complex syllables in Devanagari). I find Andreas'
    suggestion of 'graphematics' less confusing.\r\n\r\nAndr\xE9"

  body: "A closed P and an open P are different topologically.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately,
    topology makes an open P equivalent to an L or an I, or a C. It makes E equivalent
    to T.\r\n\r\nSo that's definitely not the term to use.\r\n\r\nAnd topography is
    right out as well, although one could (with tongue firmly in cheek) use it to
    talk abut the frequency and height of ascenders, making a line of type more mountainous.\r\n\r\nI'd
    suggest using nontechnical language. Merely speak of the basic shape of a letter.
    Or eschew Latin for German, and use something starting with \"ur-\"."

    the same, no matter how much its contrast, stress, weight and serifs are transformed.\r\nOne
    might also say that the topology of P and R in Palatino is consistent.\r\n\r\n"

  body: "You are looking too far afield. The skeletal essence of a grapheme shape
    is its <em>form.</em> Now, in plain language, \"form\", \"shape\" and \"morphology\"
    would be synonyms, but there is enormous precedent in how people in typography
    and graphetics talk about this: we say \"the binocular form of g\" and \"the cursive
    form of r\". You naturally used it many times in your inquiry. <em>Form</em> could
    be considered its own taxonomical level between <em>grapheme</em> and <em>glyph</em>.\r\n\r\nThe
    study of how a graphic form has changed and developed could be called its \"morphology\"
    in the same way the origins of a word are called its \"etymology\"."

  body: "What changes is that when the P is \"open\",  it is simply connected whereas
    when it is \"closed\" it is not simply connected; simple connectedness is indeed
    a topological property. To use that interpretation, we need to see a P as a plane
    surface bounded by its contours. What that means is just that the open P can be
    defined by a unique contour and the closed one needs two contours (and both P's
    are \"connected\" i.e. are made of just one piece). \r\n\r\nBut, quadriloc is
    right: the letters p, q, d, b are nothing but an o with an outgrowth. Topologically,
    they are undistinguishable.\r\n\r\n"
