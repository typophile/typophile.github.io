  body: Paul, I think the font you seek may be Hess Neobold, Mono and it is shown
    (Caps, Numbers and some Punc. only) on page 178 of Mac McGrew's American Metal
    Typefaces of the 20th Century, Oak Knoll Books 1993 2ed.

  body: no, not neobold. monoblack is also in the McGrew book, just above neobold
    and is a completely different design. i have some partial settings, but want to
    find more complete character sets if possible.
