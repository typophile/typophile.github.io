  body: Running out the door, but it could be a customized  <BR>Copperplate or check
    the fonts at <a href="http://letterheadfonts.com" target="_blank">Letterhead</a>.
    <BR> <BR>Also Modesto from <a href="http://typedesign.com" target="_blank">Jim
    Parkinson</a> could be <BR>customized to look similar.

  body: good suggestions Stephen. <BR> <BR>I don&#39;t think it&#39;s for sale yet
    but <BR>WAKEROBIN from Carl Crossgrove <BR>is also in the same genre. <BR> <BR><a

  body: hey type fans ... I contacted the guy who did the Sons of Thunder t shirt
    design ... and he said it was BonJovi and CopperPlate Gothic Condensed ... but
    my version of BonJovi has a very wide U and O ... any further ideas other than
    it is a custom tweak.

  body: Nope. As far as I can tell, this <i>is</i> a customization of  <BR><a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/copperplate-gothic/thirty-three-bc/testdrive.html?s=sons%20of%20thunder&amp;p=48"
    target="_blank"> Copperplate Gothic</a> as Stephen pointed out. The curve  <BR>effect
    and multiple outline make it hard to make out  <BR>the correct weight, but the
    basic character shapes are  <BR>unmistakably Copperplate Goth<i>esque</i>.
