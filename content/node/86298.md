  but am still curious about what typeface is being used by the design consultancy
  Bleed, occasionally on their site, as seen in this screengrab image.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/thin_weight_geo_sans_6420.jpg]

  body: Perhaps I should start another post, but I'll put this out there with anyone
    in this post for now. I'd like to also inquire about this very T-Star Mono -esque,
    linear face, also used by Bleed ... [img:sites/default/files/old-images/tstar_mono_esque_4617.jpg]
