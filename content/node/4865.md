  body: Cheers James... that&#39;s a good one! <BR> <BR>I should say - typefaces along
    this theme are what I&#39;m looking ford - it doesnt have to be exact... if the
    Y is different etc... thats ok... <BR> <BR> <BR>James <BR>

  body: No way. I won&#39;t let you get away with it. After saying you want to design
    your own type, don&#39;t quit! The letterforms you have chosen are nice and straight
    forward.You can do it.  <BR> <BR>The first thing to do is block in the letters.
    Your sample is made entirely out of rectangles. The part that will require some
    consideration is making optical thickness adjustments. 6 letters. All caps. It&#39;s
    a great place to start! Post some refinements. The good people at typophile will
    walk you through it. <BR> <BR>Randy
