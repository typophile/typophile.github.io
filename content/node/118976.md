body: "Hi all!\r\nWhat would you suggest to replace Lobster on a blog? It is currently
  used for the site name and all headers and while I don't mind it for the site name,
  I think it is messy and difficult to read in the headings and sub-headings in the
  posts. The main text font is Helvetica Neue, sans-serif, and the sidebar headings
  are Montserrat sans-serif. I'm looking for something that's clean and modern without
  being too stern.\r\n\r\nThis is the site:\r\n [[http://andmykitchensink.com/]]\r\n\r\nAny
  ideas are greatly appreciated!"

    to Google Fonts, Cuprum (albeit it could look a too \u201Ctechie\u201D) or Open
    Sans Condensed (not much contrast) could work."

  body: Thanks for the feedback riccard0! I do like the Open Sans Condensed, the Cuprum
    is a bit too techie for my taste. I'll give it a shot and see how it looks.

  body: "Hm, many things could work well here. The wide sans you\u2019re using in
    the little stuff (Montserrat) also made me think of FF Ernestine, maybe the light
    weight could look nice (disclaimer, it\u2019s mine). It\u2019s definitely not
    narrow though. Something like this? http://bit.ly/1tS38vg "

  body: 'Thanks Nina and Les! That webfonter thing is great, I had never seen it before
    - it''s a huge help! I have to play with that to try a bunch. I do like Bree,
    I think that''s almost what I''m looking for (but I''m not crazy about the small
    "k" in Bree) but can''t seem to get it to show up in the webfonter thing. '

    for me too. I think they also have a Chrome extension, haven\u2019t tried that
    one though.\r\n\r\nSome other things that popped into my mind since you like Bree:\r\nKarmina

    better! I actually like the k, g, y etc not the 'z' tho! (fortunately there is
    also a 'normal' z :-)\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/k_4021.png]"
