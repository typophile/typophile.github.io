body: "Long story short: My grandfather wrote a book a few of years ago about his
  experiences in WWII. I helped him set it and get it published, but, frankly, I didn't
  do a very good job. Young, inexperienced, etc.\r\n\r\nFor his Christmas present
  I'm re-setting the whole thing properly and publishing a nice hardback through <a
  href=\"http://www.lulu.com\">Lulu</a>.\r\n\r\nI've done the interior (and will post
  it up for crit soon, in a different thread), but I'm struggling with the cover.
  All illustrations were done by my grandfather for the first edition, and I'd like
  to re-use them for sentimental (his) reasons, but don't be precious about critiquing
  them too, I'm not. I've chosen Gill Sans as the book's titling face for it's obvious
  historic references. It definitely evokes war-time britain IMO (though the book
  is of course set mostly in France and Germany, so maybe I've goofed there...)\r\n\r\nHere
  are two directions I've taken, any and all comments would be wonderful and welcomed:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/JAW_cover.jpg]\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/JAW_cover2a.jpg]\r\n\r\n\r\nThanks
  in advance,\r\n\r\nJordan"

    without the inset images at the bottom. I can't say I am a big fan of the CAPS
    mixed with small italics, though.\r\n\r\nPerhaps there's some inspiration here:

  body: '#1 is perfect! Far more appealing and looks right for the era. '

    body: I do not like the typography or the illustrations in the second version.  Number
      one is much better in composition, you do not need to complicate things such
      as in the second design.
