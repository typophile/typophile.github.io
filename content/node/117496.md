    It was first produced in the late 1870s by Vanderburgh and Wells and by the William
    Page Wood Type Co. Here is the character set of a condensed version, in the form
    of a mirrored photograph of the actual wood type.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/PaintersRomanWoodTypeMirrorSM_6728.jpg]\r\nI
    don't recall a digital version, but will check further.\r\nDon"
