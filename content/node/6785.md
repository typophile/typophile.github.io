  body: The church lettering strikes me as being quite similar to &#34;Russian Church&#34;
    in the <a href="http://www.archive.org/texts/texts-details-db.php?collection=millionbooks&amp;collectionid=TheManualOfLinotypeTypography">Manual
    of Linotype Typography</a> &#40;see p. 192&#41;, particularly the &#34;zh&#34;
    character. <BR> <BR>The arab stuff strikes me as the equivalent of the ubiquitous
    &#34;chinese restaurant font&#34;. Even so, it&#39;s pretty legible to my American
    eyes.

    just can&#39;t tell if the 2nd letter in the top sign is an &#34;a&#34; or a &#34;ya&#34;

    I think this is definately an older style, but still very legible. i&#39;ll hafta
    take a look at some older letterforms for some cyrillics i&#39;m working on. <BR>I
    love church slavonic lettering. i especially like all the ligatures that they

  body: that&#39;s what threw me for a loop, i thought it was &#34;bar&#34; but i
    guess they didn&#39;t really teach us that word at BYU. ;^&#41; Most definately
    that&#39;s a hard sign and it appears that this is &#34;Fyodor&#39;s Bar&#34;
    &#40;something about the stress on the E makes it become a YO, morphology was
    a long time ago!&#41; i&#39;m thinking this must be old lettering because modern
    grammar would give us &#34;BAR FEDRA&#34; &#40;with an A at the end instead of
    a hard sign, but instead we get &#34;BAR FEDORUH&#34; where the hard sign actually
    gives the UH sound. Now that i&#39;ve written all this someone who actually speaks
    russian is going to come clear all this up for you, hrant! ;^&#41;

  body: I asked to a russian friend who said me that it is legible but old fashoned,
    pre-revolution. &#34;Bar&#34; is written with ? &#40;ja&#41; instead of A, but
    both A and ? &#40;ja&#41; existed even before revolution. She says that this could
    be a Bulgarian sign.  <BR>The last letter &#34;?&#34; &#40;&#39;&#41; it was wrotten
    in the end of some masculine words before revolution. There were irregular rules
    but after revolution there had been a reform that regularized orthography. <BR>The
    meaning is, according to her, &#34;Bar Fredor&#34;, Fedor is the name of the bar.

  body: The lettering posted by Hrant Papazian shows the shapes of some heavily stylised
    initials that <i>may</i> be traced to the 17th century. Frankly, it has as much
    in common with the Cyrillic lettering/typographic tradition as the signs of the
    Irish pubs in The Bronx have with the Book of Kells. One should be wary not to
    mistake such cheap pieces for the fount of knowledge about the Cyrillic letter-forms,
    let alone not to draw any hasty conclusions with regard to the Russian lettering
    conventions. <BR> <BR>The second letter in the first line is the <a href="http://www.palmira.net/arts/nlr/images/high/primer.jpg"
    target="_blank">A</a>, not the <a href="http://www.edu.ru/files/pics/68.jpg" target="_blank">YA</a>.
    The YA originated as a digraph I-A but later lost its first part &#40;I-&#41;,
    so the construction of the present-day YA is indeed a variation on the shape of
    the olden-day A. <BR> <BR>The Z&#43;b thing at the end of the bottom line is the
    hard sign &#40;<a href="http://www.pravoslavie.ru/sas/image/bukvar.jpg" target="_blank">YER</a>&#41;.
    Its early forms sometimes featured that slanted stem. The YER is used here to
    make the whole thing feel &#34;antique&#34;. The reason being, the usage of the
    final YER &#40;after the consonnants&#41; was abolished long time ago, in 1918.
    The presence, or the absence of the final YER changes nothing in the pronunciation
    of the words. Of course, logically, the word &#34;BAR&#34; &#40;the top line&#41;
    should end in the same way. This hard-sign spelling trick is as popular--and as
    credible--as the fake antique spelling like &#34;Ye Olde Booze Shoppe&#34;.  <BR>
    <BR>As to the FEDOR/FYODOR spelling, the sound YO in Russian is expressed with
    the &#34;E diaeresis&#34; &#40;Umlaut, tr

  body: 'Thanks for the insights. I guess a sign for a bar can rarely be culturally
    very &#34;pure&#34;. The YER business is especially amusing. It&#39;s fascinating
    though that the pre-Petrine &#34;A&#34; essentially survived via a truncated YA,
    while it didn&#39;t in its lone form. <BR> <BR>&#62; The YA originated as a digraph
    I-A but later lost its first part <BR> <BR>I guess the YA &#40;I &#43; O, graphically&#41;
    never lost its elements? BTW, Cyrillic has so many letters based on or around
    the &#34;y&#34; sound - it&#39;s interesting to consider why. <BR> <BR>And about

  body: 'To answer the original question, both samples are definitely old-style, the
    first looking more like older books, and the second is quite typical iconic or
    church-style. The second one is rather common in religious books, has a few digital
    implementations. The first one is for sure handmade and quite craftily so. <BR>
    <BR>As for legibility, the funky A and D are only clear in a context. They are
    quite cleverly stylized, the Ya-looking A maybe even mimicked after an actual
    old sample &#40;letter Ya was introduced later than A, so in absence of it, an
    A looking like this would raise no questions&#41;. But as standalone letters they
    are hardly identifiable. <BR> <BR>As for Z-looking E, this is the way all children
    are taught at school to handwrite the capital E. And yes, the last one is a hard
    sign - I like the slanting as it saves space making the letter more compact, fitting
    in a rectangle. Hard sign by the look, but in fact this is an abandoned in post-revolutionary
    reform letter Yat&#39; &#40;or Yeru in some literature&#41;, that read &#34;ye&#34;
    in some combinations and was silent in others, like here. Which is exactly the
    reason it was left behind. It looked liked a hard sign, but could have an extra
    downward stroke at the end of leftmost horizontal element. <BR> <BR>I have to
    disappoint you on the bar&#39;s name: it really is Fyodor, but it&#39;s a Russian

    students, I heard. Just one problem with this: many people may first see a rare
    Yo-word in writing with Ye, and start pronouncing it with Ye, but that&#39;s something
    to deal with at school, like they do with silent consonants in, say, soLntse.
    <BR> <BR>And stressing is a funny issue. Paul, I honestly haven&#39;t heard of
    any formal stressing rules - this whole business changes so much even from region
    to region... As for the antepenultimate syllable - doesn&#39;t this call for at
    least 3 syllables in word? And two immediate counterexamples: korOva &#40;a cow&#41;,
    molokO &#40;milk&#41;. There&#39;s also everyone&#39;s favorite bAbushka &#40;a
    grandmother&#41; that fits your rule fine, but foreigners tend to mispronounce
    with stress on the second syllable. The thing is, we have lots of prefixes, suffixes
    and endings, and in nouns the stress often stays on the root, in verbs it usually
    doesn&#39;t and there&#39;s a million other cases making it impossble to formalize.
    How many languages have you heard of that have some 400-pages stressing dictionaries
    &#40;much overlooked by TV and radio announcers btw&#41;? Besides, language changes
    - this dictionary has been reissued 8 times since 1960! Correct usage of stresses
    is one of little classy etiquette things over here, like holding your chopsticks
    farther from the picking end in Japan or knowing your silverware rules in European
    tradition. I guess there might be a key to formalization, but the total number

  body: '&#62; simpler characters make readng faster, don&#39;t they? <BR> <BR>For
    OCR software. For humans I believe it&#39;s actually the other way around. Perhaps
    not so much in terms of legibility, but very much in terms of readability. <BR>
    <BR>The insights into Russian pronunciation are fascinating. <BR> <BR>hhp'

  body: Hrant, can&#39;t argue here. I&#39;d love to see some kind of research about
    this, maybe about legibility in general - interesting stuff... <BR> <BR>You inspired
    me to do a little research on Yo, and something interesting came up &#40;<a href="http://yomaker.narod.ru/seven.htm"
    target="_blank">http://yomaker.narod.ru/seven.htm</a>&#41; - the letter had most
    likely been personally invented by princess Ekaterina Daskhova in 1783 and first
    printed in 1795. In 1918 reform it was pronounced optional, and putting dieresis
    on top of yo was only recommended to avoid ambiguity. Still no clues about the
    reasons...But this really caught on. I guess nobody wants to look old-fashioned...
