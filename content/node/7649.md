body: Hello all! <BR> <BR>I am putting together a project in which I am trying to
  assess the impact of hand lettering on type design.  In this respect I want to find
  out what kind of influence styles such as graphiti, 60&#39;s psychedelic poster
  lettering, and more contemporary scrawl have on the modern design of type.  I also
  want to know what kind of influence calligraphy has on type design at the present
  time.  I would like to hear any thoughts you have on the subject, as well as tips
  and tricks for both type design, and hand lettering. <BR>The idea is to put together
  a book encouraging students to study letter forms by drawing them &#40; the computer
  seems to have had a negative effect since the days of hand rendering on how students
  learn about form&#41;.

  body: Eric Gill might be a good subject &#40;although out of the range you have
    described&#41;, he saw himself as a stonecarver more than a type designer, but
    still produced a design which can hold its own against most modern designs. His
    prowess as a carver and engraver, which in turn gave him a familiarity with pitfalls
    of letter drawing, were instrumental in the commissions to create typefaces. I
    have just finished Fiona MacCarthy&#39;s biography which is fascinating. <a href="http://www.letraset.com/uk/info/type_gallery/wdewordekeepsake.asp"

    This has some beautiful drawings &#40;scroll down&#41;, I tried the email address
    to get a copy but have had no reply. I know it&#39;s not exactly what you had
    in mind, but I found it stimulating. <BR>Tim

    Industries</a> folks, and they are interested in just this juncture between lettering
    and type, so I&#39;m sure they could give you some good ideas.

  body: Thanks a lot for all the posts so far!   <BR> <BR>Your words are extremely
    helpful in this early stage of researching and collating material for this project
    in that I can begin to see all the various threads which connect to the subject
    area of lettering and type. <BR>Stone carving and engraving are fascinating subjects,
    and as important in the development of the letterform as calligraphy, and the
    other areas I mentioned; the Eric Gill biography sounds like some pleasant reading,
    I shall certainly make the effort to locate a copy.  It would be fantastic if
    I could find someone to give me the stonecarver/engravers point of view; I wonder
    what the difference would be between how a stonecarver looks at letterforms, and
    how a calligrapher looks at letterforms?  Obviously there are differences in the
    media, but does this shape the preferences of the practioner; does the aesthetic
    taste vary depending on the profession?  It is true that there is a difference
    between the way you shape black/white, and the interface/tool you use.  That remark
    made me really think about &#39;shaping&#39;, it created a link in my mind between
    the process of lettering, and sculpture, particularly in relation to the work
    of Wes Wilson, the psychedelic poster artist.  He, like a sculptor worked from
    the outside in, from the counters, and counter forms. <BR>I&#39;ve just read the
    article on House Industries in Grafic magazine &#40;august 2004&#41; and apparently
    they intend to &#39;rewrite design history to include overlooked practitioners&#39;,
    which is a sentiment I wholeheartedly agree with.  A lot of design gets overlooked
    for reasons of fashion, and &#39;someone elses&#39; taste.  I would love to speak
    to those guys, but i&#39;m sure they keep very busy; any ideas on how best to
    approach them?   <BR> <BR>Thanks again Mr Daly, Mr Papazian, and Mr Berkson.  Hope
    to speak again soon.

  body: Rowland, when you get the error message, just ignore it. Copy your text to
    make sure you don&#39;t lose it. Then click &#39;back&#39; your browser a few
    times and refresh. Your message will probably be there.  <BR> <BR>You can now
    &#40;for 60min?&#41; click on the pencil at the top right of the repeated posts
    and replace the repetitions with &#40;repeat&#41; or &#40;oops&#41; or whatever
    you want. You will also have to delete the &#39;font=don&#39;t look like crap&#39;
    message that will pop onto the front of your text when you change it. These are
    both bugs in the typophile software that Joseph &amp; Jared are figuring out how
    to fix. Meanwhile...

  body: BTW, if you could manage to mine Michael Harvey&#39;s brain about this it
    would be very insightful, since he&#39;s very accomplished in many of the subdisciplines
    of &#34;visible language&#34;. <BR> <BR>hhp

  body: Michael Harvey is based not far from where I am based &#40;Reading is not
    far from London&#41;, I will try to contact him.  I know his fonts, but is there
    anything in particular that he has written that might give me a more informed
    background? <BR> <BR>Sorry about the repetitions of the last post.  Didn&#39;t
    show until I gave up trying to post, and logged back in, by then my 60 minutes
    was up.  Still now I know!

    lettering today</a>.</i> This doesn&#39;t much discuss the influence of one lettering
    method on another, but provides ample eveidence of the influence in Michael&#39;s
    own work, and also of his intelligent adaptation to different media.

  body: 'A 2001 exhibit in San Francisco was organized around this very topic: Zapfest
    focused on Hermann and Gudrun Zapf, but also displayed alphabets and type designs
    by other lettering people &#40;including Michael Harvey&#41;. The catalog for
    the exhibit is still available. It&#39;s called Calligraphic Type Design in the
    Digital Age, by John Prestianni. This book could point you in several directions.
    I agree that the House Industries boys are also very actively exploring the boundaries
    between lettering, calligraphy and type, escpecially now with the PLINC resources
    at their fingertips. Jim Parkinson, who has done lots of custom lettering as well
    as typefaces, might also be a good person to talk with. There are surely others.
    <BR> <BR>Hrant has a good point; people with very different skills can end up
    designing typefaces: handwriting, calligraphy, pen lettering, brush lettering,
    signpainting, and punchcutting all provide different ways of producing type forms.
    These differences might be interesting for your students to explore.  <BR> <BR>Carl'

  body: One way &#40;that i can see&#41; that lettering is affecting type development
    today is the growing popularity of script faces. For a good study on the matter,
    read Nick Shinn&#39;s article, <a href="http://shinntype.com/Assets/Depts/Essays/Scriptom.pdf"
