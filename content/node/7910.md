body: I&#39;m making a logo for a company thats into designing pipes, wires etc. for
  shipping and offshore industry. I have got the typo down, but I&#39;m having difficulties
  getting the colors right. They dont want to communicate typical blue navy colors,
  but they want to stand out as a serious, modern and creative company. The problem
  is that this is a conservative business group, and their customers likewise. I have
  tried to explain this to them, but they wont listen, so I&#39;m stuck trying to
  get a decent result out of it.  <BR>Anyone got any got suggestions for colorschemes?

  body: Tom have you looked into Metalics as an accent color? An orange gold or red
    gold would say wires, pipes to me. Also for the main color a warm or cool gray
    might work. If you want a stronger main color try one of the blacks with a hint
    of color like PMS Black 6, conservative but rich.

    more suggestions?

  body: Perception is how they see themselves, not as they are seen. If they see themselves
    as industry leaders then a gold color could make sense. I would look less on what
    they make and focus on color that reflect their self perception.
