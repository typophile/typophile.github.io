  body: That 't' is not far from the 't' in FF Netto (see to your right). The rest
    is a lot like <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/singles/creative_alliance/myriad_pro_regular/?sample_text=pixiestudio">Myriad</a>
    with some trimmed vertical strokes.

  body: "Thanks, Stephen. I noticed the similarity with FF Netto but this typeface
    is less condenensed and more rounded. You really make a good point about Myriad.
    I couldn't see that before you mentioned it. I guess the person who design this
    has done pretty good job. \r\n\r\nMy next typeface on the list is probably <a

    Sebastian Lester. "
