  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>Hello,</p>
<p>Last month the new main train station of Berlin was opened. It&rsquo;s a very impressive building.
They use a custom (?) typeface in their advertisement, posters etc.
Is there anybody who can tell me more about the typeface?
Thanks!</p>

It is still only sporadically seen in Germany, because implementation takes a long time over such a big network. Most of the printed stuff seems to have changed over in my neck of the woods, though.</p>
<p>Since the Berlin train station just opened, I guess they would have done things in the new type, instead of redoing things. Looks good, though, right?</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Chris, I think that one of the problems is decentralization. In Germany, the train company (which is still state owned, or at least mostly state owned) is involved with every local city&rsquo;s transit networks as well. They run the commuter trains, while local organizations seem to handle subways, trams, and buses. Local transit system have their own signage identities (especially Berlin and Munich, whose most recent redesigns are all very good, in my opinion, even if the whole network wasn&rsquo;t really covered).</p>
<p>If Amtrak was a real, well, a real <em>anything</em>, maybe one could talk to them about a national Amtrak signage typeface and/or system. Local prop-us like the DC Metro might then be impressed by said results, and a &ldquo;me too&rdquo; effect could ensure. The closest thing one can show would be James Maltabano&rsquo;s new highway faces. Somehow, I don&rsquo;t think that showing European success stories, even great ones, would carry much water :(</p>
<p>I worked in DC for a year, and I must say that I was thankful that Metro had any sort of coherent signage system at all. It wasn&rsquo;t good, but in the US, most transit authorities seem not to put anything together.</p>

You are right. It would not be the best approach to show European success.  We would need to do one of our own.  James has done much of this kind of work and may want to show his success to the Metro folks.  The Metro board is made up of DC, VA, and MD officials who as a committee, agree or disagree about how to do things so it isn&rsquo;t a smooth path.</p>

<p>Nick, no I haven&rsquo;t, but then my collection is still in its infancy. If the &lsquo;STOP&rsquo; on the road is super-condensed because it&rsquo;s on the ground, would you likewise paint super-extended letters on the platform to be read as you travel past? Be a great way to add a some texture to an otherwise dull surface, anyway. Like the opposite (in size) to the Concorde station in Paris. Few things better than letterforms to create texture. :-)</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I visited the Berlin Hauptbahnhof a few days after it opened. The information system in the new station does not utilize the new Spiekermann typeface. You see this new face, however, in the on-board printed timetables DB places in just about every seat in the EC and ICE trainsets. (although the graphic integration/modifications in the timetables are not yet complete)</p>
<p>Additionally, the new typeface was viewed by billions during the world cup, as it was clearly present in close proximity to the goalposts on the DB billboard cards in virtually all twelve stadiums.</p>
<p>Some of my Berliner friends criticize the new Hauptbahnhof because it flows the ICE trains away from the traditional Berlin Stadtbahn stations, but that is a very minor flaw. Others are upset because the original design was compromised by DB to reduce costs. I heard others call it a &ldquo;big shopping plaza.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I say all of this is nonsense. This new station is so intriguing, so compelling, so well thought out, that it becomes clear immediately upon arriving that it is the most light-years advanced facility of its kind in the world. Its the first epic train station built from the ground up in Europe in 100 years. As a lifelong resident of highway cluttered California, its a joy experiencing public facilities like this one.</p>

<p>Actually, this is a very major flaw, especially if you live in Berlin, or are visiting Berlin for virtually any business or pleasure trip. The location of this new station is only good for traveling politicians, and a few people who travel to meet business or consoluting contacts in the government park.</p>
<p>The train station is a monolith that was intended to act as a service hub for a city of 6 million. However, since reunification, Berlin&rsquo;s population has not doubled, as was originally expected. And even if Germany had another economic miracle, I doubt that it would.</p>
<p>But, it is a pretty building.</p>

<p>Not true. Thanks to Hauptbahnhof, the thin and very error-prune East-West connection can be relieved a bit. This should result in less delays and better scheduling. One of the major flaws of the Berlin train transit so far was that if one train was late, the entire system was shuffled around because practically all trains had to be rescheduled.</p>
<p>Getting to Hauptbahnhof from any of the other stations (Ostbahnhof, Friedrichstrasse, Zoo) is really not much of a challenge. You just go to another platform and take an S-Bahn.</p>

The total aggregate time I spent waiting for S-bahn trains on the upper Bahnsteig during those twelve journeys was about ninety seconds.</p>
<p>Yet, if you live in Charlottenberg and use the ICE frequently, you must transfer to the S-bahn upon arriving in Berlin. This is a major annoyance, to say the least. Also, there must be fears that the new Hauptbahnhof will overshadow the efficiency, charm, and character of the other Berlin stations, which are world-class facilities in their own right.<img src="/images/old-images/berlinHaupt2_5543.jpg" alt=""></p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I can imagine a reaction against totalitarian signage systems in a few years time.
That will be more work for typographers and type designers of course.</p>
<p>Because how can you have a unique sense of place when everywhere is signed the same?</p>
<p>Typeface systems such as Chalet 1960/70/80 and Lisboa/Lisboa Sans point the way.
Not quite the same thing as Humana or such mega-families.</p>
<p>When I worked for Raymond Lee back in 1980, one of our clients was the National Ballet of Canada. Ray would use any face that caught his fancy, Pontifex, Goudy OS, Bodoni, Century, Garamond &ndash; in his own exemplary manner of course.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Ha. I thought I might get such a reaction from you, Chris. :-)</p>
<p>And yes, I guess it would be rather a grand sign for a bar, but that highlighted &lsquo;bar&rsquo; bit drew my eye and led me to conclusions. Conclusions encouraged by bars being (I think) second only to hairdressers for shoe-horning a pun into their name, no matter how weak a connection might be. Scubar, Bar Humbug, Bar None, Brew Bar Ha, The Candy Bar, etc, etc. &lsquo;Bombardier&rsquo; seems right at home. I do like one in Melbourne called &lsquo;So bar&rsquo; though. Very responsible name for a bar. :-)</p>
