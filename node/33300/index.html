  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">I've been challenged with, in the word of the client, "freshening up" the brand for a mid-size bank that hasn't changed a thing about its look and feel since it was created in 1987. They are not willing to change their logo, which uses Eras as it's primary typeface. 

Unfortunately, the words "Eras" and "fresh" do not belong in the same sentence.

So I think the best I'm going to be able to do is select a new typeface for their tagline, which could therefore be used as the primary typeface in advertising, stationery, etc. I'm thinking it needs to be a serif face, as to not conflict with Eras, but I'm open to other suggestions. I'm having a hard time finding a serif typeface that looks contemporary enough to compensate for the use of Eras in the logo, but also timeless enough to work in case it's another 20 years before they update their look again.

Any suggestions? </div>

		<div class="commentbody">What kind of a company is it? Is it a logotype, strictly type? Which weight is being used? How long of a logotype is it? What colors are present? Is there another element involved? 

Strictly speaking I don't think it has to be a serif. Two sans, heck 3 sans, can be used together happily, it just takes finesse.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Here's their website. Our agency only recently acquired this account, so we had nothing to do with the current look. 

http://www.carolinafirst.com/personalbanking/index.asp

What I need to do is find a primary typeface that can be used in headlines, the tagline (which we have rewritten), on outdoor, etc. They are currently using Eras for everything except the tag, and that needs to change, but the "Carolina First" part of the logo and the "1" symbol isn't going anywhere.

As far as colors go, we're hoping to transition them away from gold towards silver and gray.

We have some great, progressive tv and print concepts, but my main challenge at this point is figuring out a way to avoid their current look from taking the viewer back to 1989.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Can the logo design stick with Eras but be redesigned using roman letters in a lighter weight? Because what I see really dating this is not so much the typeface itself, but that it is huge and clumped into one long clod of text. An airy, lightweight logo set in Eras with the tagline also set in Eras could end up looking very contemporary, especially with new colors. </div>
