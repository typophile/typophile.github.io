body: Hi guys, <BR> <BR>I&#39;m hoping someone can help me track down some typo-research.
  A bit of background first... <BR> <BR>About 7 years ago I did some legibility research
  in which I created a booklet featuring text that gradually degraded and became illegible
  over time. It began with a clean sans serif face, and by the end of the 20 pages
  it had morphed into an illegible font. When reading through it the eye actually
  &#39;learns&#39; the font and by the end of it is actually quite legible. The purpose
  of the exercise was to explore how &#39;illegibility&#39; is something the eye/brain
  can &#39;learn&#39;. <BR> <BR>I have since lost all the research work that I did
  for this, but I know that a few other people in the typo-community have also made
  very similar experiments. I really need to find references/samples of this same
  experiment. I&#39;m not after other types of research, I need this specific approach
  in particular. Anyone have any clues? I recall reading similar reference to it here
  and there but I can not pin point a reference. The University of reading might have
  something in their archives...? <BR> <BR>If anyone can provide any leads I would
  be most appreciative. <BR> <BR>Thanks, <BR>Monib <BR> <BR>

    reading for instance. <BR> <BR><a href="http://www.themicrofoundry.com/" target="_blank">http://www.themicrofoundry.com/</a>

  body: Monib, what you&#39;re doing is extremely significant. <BR> <BR>Mostly because
    I actually don&#39;t know anybody else who&#39;s done experiements dealing with
    the extremely important issue of Familiarity in readability. I urge you to take
    this up again, and please keep me in the loop! And let me know if I can help.
    What you end up finding can validate/invalidate tons of anecdotal opinions that
    I for one can&#39;t trust on its own. Emigre says one thing, Noordzij says another.
    I think they&#39;re both essentially wrong, but one can be more wrong than the
    other!  :-&#41; <BR> <BR>The careful gradual shifting of a typeface &#40;serif
    would be better though&#41; is a superb way of measuring the effects of familiarity.
    This is very valuable stuff - go all the way with it. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>
