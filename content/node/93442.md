body: "Hi!\r\n\r\nI'd like to ask for some advice. I'm a musician studying Composition.
  I love design and typography, but I ultimately abandoned it to focus on music. \r\nI've
  been using Minion Pro as the text font for my self-edited scores and drafts. I find
  it gorgeous: the regular is clean and great looking, the bold has presence, and
  I'm particularly enamored with its italic. However, I'm not sure where I got it.
  I don't know whether it came with my Mac or if it came with an Adobe product, since
  it was developed by Adobe. I'm guessing the latter.\r\n\r\nI'm in the process of
  founding a music publishing house. I would be in charge of handling directly with
  the music, and responsible of establishing a \"house style\", a consistent design
  to use across all of our published scores. \r\nTaking that into consideration, what
  would I need to be use the font professionally? Is there any licensing I need to
  take care of? Are there similar fonts you would recommend?\r\n\r\nThank you in advance
  for your replies!"

    know that it's also the font that Durand/Salabert/Eschig use for their scores
    these days too. (In case you want to avoid looking too much like anything else.)\r\n\r\nI
    think it's a rather lovely font as well and have used it in scores before (my
    job insofar as I have one is typesetting music - mostly for specific publishers
    who already have their own house style and therefore I just use the fonts I'm
    told to use, but for my own pieces or for things I've done 'privately' of course
    I get to choose what I like, usually) but ultimately I decided it was a bit too
    light for my preferences. Partly this will also depend on the music font/symbol
    library you are using, which then also depends on what software you're using as
    well.\r\n\r\nI haven't exactly established my own publishing house (would be very
    fancy to call it that) but I have over a long time worked out for myself a detailed
    house style that I now use for all the projects I do for myself, including of
    course my own music. The hardest bit was finding the perfect text font to use;
    I could tell you what I decided on in the end, but then I'd have to kill you,
    obviously.\r\n\r\nNice in any case to see a kindred spirit here!"

    body: "Thank you for your reply! Nice to see a \"kindred spirit\" indeed!\r\n\r\nDurand
      is using it too? Maybe that's why I was drawn to it. I find it very effective.
      Given yours and hrant's kind reply, I'll keep on using it and I'll see into
      getting that license."

  body: "Luis, unless you remember your copy of Minion having been paid for you should
    indeed purchase a license from Adobe.\r\n\r\nBTW, one nice thing about Adobe is
    that they allow modification of their fonts (but of course not their redistribution)
    in case you need to add any special symbols concerning the typesetting of music.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    As far as I understood, this \u2018perfect text font\u2019 will be used for projects
    of your (upcoming) publishing house. Doesn\u2019t publishing imply making the
    materials set in this typeface publicly available at some point in time? Won\u2019t
    everybody be able to just see then which typeface you chose? Just asking&nbsp;\u2026"

  body: If Minion came with some Adobe software that you bought, I don't think you
    do need to buy a separate license. I should think as long as you can identify
    where you got it from, and that it was bundled with something from Adobe, that's
    enough. If it came free, though, it probably doesn't have all the weights anyway,
    which you may want to buy.

  body: Minion Pro has been bundled with Adobe's Creative Suite, so you may have gotten
    it that way. (Don't know if it's bundled if you buy the applications individually.)
