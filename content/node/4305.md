  body: What is the source of the image? This looks like something made from one of
    those engraver tools used to make license plate frames &#40;the rounded ends of
    all the strokes are characteristic of those devices&#41;. If that is the case,
    this is based on a template, and not a computer font.

  body: It reminds me of a transfer face called Bogart, but I cannot find it online,
    does anyone have an old Letraset &#40;or similar&#41; catalogue? <BR> <BR>There&#39;s
    also a similar one called Flanders, but I don&#39;t remember it having rounded
    ends. <BR> <BR>It&#39;s definitely not Eric Olson&#39;s <a href="http://processtypefoundry.com/typefaces/bryant/index.html"

  body: Theres nothing close to it in either the Letraset or Mecanorma catalog, except
    for Letraset&#39;s Cut-in Medium. But the &#39;g&#39; doesn&#39;t match and the
    &#39;e&#39; is open. Still looking...

  body: "Zipatone had a face called &#39;Bogart&#39; in dry transfer. That must be
    the one you&#39;re thinking of Jes\xFAs, but I can&#39;t seem to locate a copy
    of it anywhere"

  body: I am not sure where this came from. I am recreating it for a client and was
    hoping it was a font! Looks like I will be redrawing it, but thank you for all
    the help!
