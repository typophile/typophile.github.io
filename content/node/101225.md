  am making a book about banknote design and im wondering about the seperation of
  the body text. After the copy header (or what do you call it) there is also a space
  on the right side, automatically added by indesign. Is this decent typography or
  should i try to align the right row with the top of the body header?\r\n\r\nThis
  is one big text box by the way with paragraph styles.\r\n\r\nThank you,\r\nAlexander"
