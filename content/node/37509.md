  Australia uses teen's Flickr photo for commercial use?</a> Nuts.\r\n\r\nAs much
  as I like what CC is doing, it certainly hasn't helped add clarity when (possibly
  irresponsible) creatives think they can a) use something for commercial use and
  b) merely give a vague attribution to Flickr, (rather than the content creater/owner).
  \r\n\r\nBy the, way this logo I've faked here is called parody, an area of copyright
  law that covers my mock of their logo. (And, I'm not an IP lawer, so don't treat
  my commentary as legal advice.) \r\n\r\nNow, when I'm creating a parody, do I retain
  full copyright? Dang."

    couldn't. But presumably you would have to assert it. And not say give it a CC
    instead... ;-p\r\n\r\nWikipedia says \" In some jurisdictions, copyright law provides
    scope for satirical or interpretive works which themselves may be copyrighted.\"
    So it appears that it depends...\r\n\r\nSee also : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copyright\r\n\r\nThis
    post should also not be confused with actual legal advice."

  body: "Eben, that fuzzy area is precisely driving home the point. =)\r\n\r\nYeah,
    none of the articles seem to define exactly what the photographers' setting was.
    Also, as Andyclymer pointed out on Flickr, it's odd that the subject of the photograph
    is suing, not the photographer himself. Seems like they could include the photographer
    in the suit since it's he who did not get a model release for his subjects.\r\n\r\nThe
    lesson is: don't use Flickr for sourcing images unless you're ready to do legwork
    with the photographers yourself."

    If the photographer set it to commercial use allowed without the need for persmission,
    for example, I wonder if they have a leg to stand on in court.\r\n\r\nStill, I
    guess it would be somewhat <em>common</em> sense if you really want to use a photo
    on Flickr, to just contact and ask the person who made it, even if it says you
    don't have to. I know I would."
