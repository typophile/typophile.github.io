    it may be someone's one-off messing with Times New Roman Bold (adding the half-circle,
    bowed serif treatment). Someone was having fun with their new Mac...."

  body: "Kevin and Don, thanks for your comments. I agree, the sample looks like a
    modified version of Times Roman. It's the date and the location of this type sample
    that intrigue me: this is an ad appearing in a well-established newspaper (Neue
    Z\xFCrcher Zeitung) only one year after the LaserWriter was released (and the
    Mac was embraced much slower in Switzerland than in the US)... so I'm thinking,
    this was produced with a phototypesetter. "
