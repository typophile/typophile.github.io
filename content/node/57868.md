  look and feel of the font? I've tried Nobel condensed and it's not condensed enough.
  Gotham is becoming so ever-present that I'd like to know of an alternative. Thanks.

    Meta Headline Condensed</a> and <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/fontfont/ff_meta_headline_compressed_ot/">Compressed</a>.
    Far less common than FF Meta and quite a bit different with a tighter fit and
    shorter tails for large settings.
