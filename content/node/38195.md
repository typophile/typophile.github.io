  for what concerns a known firm (agency) with headquarter in Berlin\r\nthat uses
  Fraktur-type as a brand (word only).\r\nSomeone there who has an idea who could
  it be?\r\n\r\nThanks\r\nStefan"

  body: "Hi Florian,\r\n\r\nthanks for your interest.\r\nSeems to be a design or ad
    agency, don\u2019t know.\r\nAnother agency a week ago offered me a job (now its
    cancelled) and they didn\u2019t want to reveal me the clients name.\r\nSo I wanted
    to make a good figure coming up with it by myself ;-)\r\nSo this question has
    been resolved anyhow..\r\n\r\nthanks neverthess\r\nStefan"
