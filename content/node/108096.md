    Thank you so much. Excuse my 'mistake'. Is it ok now, eh? It is my homework's
    piece that it'd very urgent. Anyway. Thanks for your comments. You are really
    'helpful' :)

  body: "<blockquote>It is my homework's piece that it'd very urgent</blockquote>\r\n\r\nIndeed
    we are helpful. So many people who think they're more important than the rest
    of us ignore \r\n\r\n<cite>All topics are welcome\u2014except font ID requests</cite>,\r\n\r\nand
    do post here. Most are in turn ignored, and the font not identified. While we
    can't help you with your probably spurious notion that you're more important than
    the rest of us, we can let you know that if you want a font identified, you're
    not likely to get much help here. \r\n\r\nSpecifically, we've helped by letting
    you know that  if you post in the correct place, you <strong>may</strong> not
    have to get a dog.*\r\n\r\n*A well cared-for dog will likely back you up when
    you have to fall back on \"The dog ate my homework.\""

  body: "I would tell you if I knew. One of the reasons for having the separate forum
    is that most (many?) of us don't have this knowledge when things get a bit esoteric.\r\n\r\nBut
    the people who hang out on the ID forum take these things as a challenge, odds
    are you will get an answer there. I'll stick to Sudoku."

  body: While there's something familiar about it, I just can't figure it out. I suppose
    dredging through the esoterica on Dafont might help, but I'm otherwise way out
    in the octal forty.
