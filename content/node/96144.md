    like [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/mti/century-schoolbook/century-schoolbook/|Century
    Schoolbook (Monotype)]] or Century Expanded, from [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/urw/century-expanded/t-regular/|URW]],[[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/bitstream/century-expanded/century-expanded/|
    Bitstream]], or [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/ef/century-expanded/century-exp-ef-regular/|Elsner

    which seems to use the same typeface: [[http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/40/ESC_1977_logo.svg/500px-ESC_1977_logo.svg.png|1977

  body: "<em>Can we decipher which one it is exactly?</em>\r\nProbably not.  The fine
    details may be obscured by the blurriness, and it's only caps\u2014a small subset
    at that. All the links I posted are to MyFonts, where you can go to the glyph
    pages for each font and compare them yourself. Personally, I can NEVER tell the
    difference between major foundries' versions of the same font, unless they have
    something like a unique ampersand or significantly different OpenType features.\r\n\r\n
