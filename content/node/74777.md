body: "\r\nHi. Is there anyone you knows if there is a name for this kind of alternated
  font?\r\n\r\nMost of the time its all uppercase, but kind of combining pairs of
  characters as if they where a monogram or some. I remembered this kind of atls in
  condensed san-serifs painted in vintage stores. This is not the best example, its
  kind of fancy, but it may help.\r\n\r\nAvantgarde has something like this, but sometimes
  crossing letters. Not what I'm looking for. Just this game in between letters, but
  not touching each other. Thanks and sorry for my english.\r\n\r\nGuima.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/24021_4177.jpg][img:sites/default/files/old-images/13903_6688.png]"
