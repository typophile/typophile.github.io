  the demo cd for a friends band (ok, hands up who's heard that one before) and I
  have the idea in my head, I know almost exactly what I am going to do and instantly
  knew that I wanted to use Knockout for the type...\r\n\r\n...until I realised how
  damn expensive it was!\r\n\r\nFirstly it's an unpaid job, I'm doing it for my portfolio
  and just as a fun exercise.\r\nSecondly, I love the font and I've always wanted
  to use it for something constructive.\r\nThirdly, I need to use about four of the
  thirty two 'styles' but unfortunately they cross two 'series' (A + C) which means
  I need to purchase both - which adds up to $338.\r\n\r\nFor the mockup I'm using
  Univers Condensed as I have it on my computer already, but I'm not really in love
  with it - but how can I justify spending that money to essentially gain so little?\r\n\r\nSo
  my question is, can anyone recommend any close alternatives to Knockout? I.e a beautiful
  San Serif Wood Type looking Condensed  / Narrow font - that isn't quite as expensive?\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    from Process Type Foundry. It doesn't have condensed weights though.
