body: "I\u2019ve to produce a book for University 25th anniversary \u2014 quite young
  isn't? \u2014, and I\u2019m looking for something different from Times, Baskerville,
  Caslon or Garamond, even if they are pretty. I've taken a look at  typefaces like
  Fiona, Leitura, Theserif, however I wonder if this last one is easy to read in a
  long text. I\u2019ve also take a look at Malaga, but my final choice is not done
  yet.\r\n\r\nThis around 60 pages book will report the short history of this university.
  Once open the book will have 20 inches in width by 12 inches in height and it will
  be print on glossy 180 M white paper. I'll have enough space to work and to play
  with large headline, large picture and text of course. I thought of Parisine or
  Agenda for the titles but this final choice is not made either . \r\n\r\nI\u2019m
  looking for a OTF serif typeface for the text, something perfectly readable with
  a good legibility and with a kind of visual character with something of distinctive
  with a nice italic. I particularly like the italic lower case k with a bowl. I also
  look for a type that I can use at 9 or 10 pts. The text will be rather long and
  probably justified on 3 or 2 columns set on short paragraph with several subtitles.\r\n\r\nYour
  suggestions for a great match between a sans and serif typeface would be very appreciated\r\n\r\nThanks
  in advance.\r\n"

  body: Legacy and Legacy Sans come to mind (by Ronald Arnholm). Meta finally has
    a serif mate (from Erik Spiekermann). Hoefler Text and Whitney make a good match
    according to the creators and I particularly like Requiem and Gotham (all four
    from Jonathan Hoefler and Tobias Frere-Jones)
