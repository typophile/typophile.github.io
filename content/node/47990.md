body: "Yesterday I punched in the alarm code for the very last time when I left <a
  href=\"http://www.magelaan.be/\">Magelaan</a>, the communication agency I worked
  at for the past 13 years. I closed the door on a 17 year career of graphic design
  and communication and transitioned from a life as employee to a life as independent.
  It was bittersweet parting, because I left behind more than just colleagues but
  friends.\r\n\r\nThis morning I took my bike and rode the 10 minute trip to FontShop\u2019s
  Belgian franchise. From now on I will fill my days with stuff I never studied for.
  I will write. I will market. I will educate. I will network. I will mostly do that
  for FontShop USA and BeNeLux, but I already have my first type foundry client. My
  days will be filled with nothing but type, my first and only true (professional)
  passion.\r\n\r\nMost people when they near their forties hit a midlife crisis, because
  they realize this is what they'll probably do until their retirement. Me, I just
  changed my career. This is about as exciting as it gets."

    work I won't need to get behind the computer to write about type anymore because
    that's what I'll have been doing all day. ;^) I'm through with constantly juggling
    three to four jobs plus a rock band and constantly running out of time."

    Before they just had to show up at my desk and hold the sample up. I'd look sideways,
    tell them what font it was and continue working. Pretty funny actually. :^)
