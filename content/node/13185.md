  body: I have only seen this in Phaidon's books. Maybe their proprietary font. It
    shares some characteristics with the rounded <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=catalog.fontdetail&displayfontid=SG.9416.0.0&attributes.sampleSize=48&sampleText=contemporary&sampleSize=48">DIN
    17</a> and Lineto's <a href="http://www.lineto.com/The+Fonts/Categories/Text+Fonts/Typ1451/Regular/">Typ1451</a>
    based on lettering templates.
