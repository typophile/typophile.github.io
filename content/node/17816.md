  is. \r\nThe message I want to get across is that we are very good, very classic
  design agency, so all our ID materials will be about that. So I have designed my
  own logo according to that message. I took Warnock as a base for the letterforms.
  I still have issues with the lc r, which seems to be from whole another planet,
  but I don't know how to make the rt look good together.\r\n\r\nAny thoughts appreciated

    graceful/classic characteristics you have created in your amended characters,
    so bravo for starting from there, I think you have many minor modifications to
    make (and being a personal identity this can turn into a life's work). \r\n\r\nRegarding
    your question about the rt, first I would lower the arm of the r (it seems too
    proud of the x-height) and then slightly reduce the length of the arm to bring
    the terminal more into the stem (to reduce the space under the arm) and give the
    terminal an edgier* character, maybe developing it from the dot above the i, then
    you could experiment with the curve so that the terminal will fit under the lefthand
    arm of the t (which I think you will need to replace). I would also look at the
    kerning of the it combination, I think loosening that would make more sense of
    the rt combination.\r\n\r\nHope this helps and isn't discouraging.\r\nTim\r\n*I

  body: "^ With the words separated the original r matches the \"t\" in \"art\" and
    my eye no longer compares the \"r\" to the angular \"y\".\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/cityart3.png]\r\n\r\nRestricting
    the wavy swash to one keeps things neat. Coloring it red makes it like a penant
    or flag, or a flame.\r\n\r\nL e t t e r &nbsp;s p a c i n g\r\nGreek classical
    architecture was founded on the horizontal principal. The Greeks built their temples
    very wide and exagerrated the horizontal aspect by placing lots of columns along
    the sides of their buildings. The columns in rows also exaggerated the sense of
    perspective.\r\n\r\nHellenistic/Roman classicism. The Romans emphasized the vertical
    more than the Greeks, but they kept the horizontal theme alive. Lettering on Roman
    buildings echoed this with long horizontal freizes divided by spaced capitals.\r\n\r\nRenaissance
    neo-classicism. When Venice became the center of printing in Europe the Italian
    printers continuted the classical tradition with their letter-spaced Antiqua type.
    Western typography was more or less founded on this recurring principal dating
    back to Greek temple architecture.\r\n\r\nLetters are still (more or less) spaced
    out in book typography. For display typography the trend has been (aince the mid
    to late 1970's) to use tight spacing, and for good reason; the extra space loses
    its original function at display sizes. Visually and design-wise it makes sense,
    and isn't really \"wrong\".\r\n\r\nThere is a reverse trend going now for spaced-out
    setting in display typography. \r\nThe effect makes more sense if the glyphs are
    spaced out a fair bit as in renaissance book typography, or very spacey like the
    classicism of antiquity.\r\n\r\nYou could letter space this logo to evoke a classical
    tone, or keep it tight and rely on the constructed classical letter forms for
    classical chic. Go for one extreme or the other, depending which flavour of classical
    you're after.\r\n\r\n<em>very good, very classic design agency</em>\r\n\r\nclassy?\r\n\r\nj

    have to be identical? If you value consistency to the exclusion of all else and
    can't tolerate the slightest aberration, sure. If they're not identical does that
    make it inferior design? Allowing them to be different adds an interesting quirk.\r\n\r\n<em>...look

    could make this logo predictable and boring. Its art, not science. The top serifs
    being smaller doesn't neccessarily make them inferior---just different. Surely
    the designer of Warnock made them that way on purpose, as an act of artful design.
    The same rationale can apply to the \"t\". The abrupt transition could be an imperfection
    by design to give the \"t\" character.\r\n\r\nAppologies if it seems I'm giving

    for the spacing, I intend to keep the letters together and crashing the t into
    y was intended and I would not like to give it up. I would like to keep the differen
    t's too, because of the feeling they provide, but I agree it looks awkward. So
    I made two versions to look at. Generally I try to maket things either very different
    or exactly the same, so the small difference between the two t's is somewhat bothering
    me.\r\n\r\nI would like to keep the two \"flags\" on the top of the A. I initially
    put them just for fun ie - without any justification, but then my partner pointed
    out that they look just like Latvian flag which has three stripes of similar proportion:
    wide red-narrower white-wide red, so I decided that it's a good thing after all
    and should stay that way.\r\n\r\nI made the top serifs a bit bigger and corrected
    the spacing. I think it looks a lot better now. The logo won't be reproduced in
    very small sizes generally, so I don't care much about serif loss. I tried to
    abandon the serifs altogether, but the result turned out to be something faceless
    and closer to Optima than I would like to.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/CA

    anyway :)\r\n\r\n<em>As for being more fun, there are times when that is good
    but I would prefer not to be surprised too much when dealing with a corporate
    identity.</em>\r\n\r\nYes. Different people see these things differently. I think
    we're very lucky to be part of a design community that tolerates differing points
    of view. As I have noted on other threads recently, I seem to enjoy being surprized
    a bit more than most.\r\n\r\nAnyway, one solution for reproducing this logo at
    smaller sizes is to make a version with reinforced details for use at small sizes
    only.\r\n\r\n<em>As for the spacing, I intend to keep the letters together and
    crashing the t into y was intended and I would not like to give it up.</em>\r\n\r\nIt
    forms a ligature, and you could take that as an opportunity to introduce an additional
    detail, on the cusp of the left stroke of y, as a finishing touch---artistic flair;\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/444.jpg]\r\n\r\nI
    raised the arm of \"r\" a tiny bit to give it some overshoot, to make it optically
    aligned with the x-line.\r\n\r\nOne other small detail I changed earlier: compare
    my first drawing to the second and third under \"suggested spacing schemes\".
    Reduced the thickness of the \"A\" bar to bring it closer to the \"t\" bars. This
    is to add elegance rather than modularizing.\r\n\r\n<em>Generally I try to maket
    things either very different or exactly the same, so the small difference between
    the two t\u2019s is somewhat bothering me.</em>\r\n\r\nThat's a familiar experience
    :) Perhaps if you show the designs to a few people with good taste who are not
    designers to get a non-designer's prespective, that may help you decide.\r\n\r\n<em>good-craft-oriented.</em>\r\n\r\nCrafted,
    hand-crafted etc, is the feel I was trying to evoke with the letter spaced versions.
    You could suggest craft-oriented another way---by adding subtle flair details
    like the one I put on the \"t-y\" bar/serif above, which is much like the flair
    Robert Slimbach put on the original Warnock \"A\". Thanks for showing the sample
    Tim.\r\n\r\n<em>As a suit, you know: black, but from Armani.</em>\r\n\r\nI know
    exactly what you mean. I paid a small fortune for 3 black Armani suits fives years
    ago, which I wear every day. The design, cut and workmanship are so beautiful
    I bought Armani spectacles to compliment.\r\n\r\nTake care,\r\nj a m e s"
