body: "Hello,\r\n\r\nI am trying to identify the following font.\r\nCurrently I got
  hired as a designer for a company as their old designer is fired, during the process
  of switching over I asked him what fonts he used and all I got was: \"You can find
  them online, just download the free ones\". As you can see not very helpful.\r\n\r\nIt
  is in regards to this product:\r\nhttp://s18.postimg.org/y98i26g1h/MPC_LOGO.jpg\r\n\r\nDoing
  some searches online I first thought it was Nedian-Medium, but the \"E\" is really
  throwing me off here, also this one isn't free which the old designer seemed to
  hint too.\r\n\r\nAnybody any tips?\r\n\r\nThank you,\r\nBen\r\n\r\nBtw, I does not
  have to be a free font. I just assumed he downloaded a free one, considering his
  helpful comments."

  body: "Thanks for the fast reply! \r\nThat was really fast, font looks great.\r\n\r\nI
    was doubting it at first, because it seemed more edgie than the original. But
    viewing the fonts at the same size it does indeed seem to be identical.\r\n\r\nAnd
    @hrant; I won't, no worries. But thanks for the tip, haha.\r\n\r\nThanks once
    again!"
