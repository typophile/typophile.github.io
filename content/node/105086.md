    in Italian and German, if compared to that \"New Yorker\"'s 1970 quotation. Here
    it is in Italian:\r\n\r\n\"Cinque sono gli elementi del libro, ossia testo, carattere,
    inchiostro carta e legatura. Comporre con questi cinque elementi un tutto coerente
    e plausibile, non sottoposto alla moda, il cui pregio sia stabile e sciolto dal
    tempo; comporne delle opere affrancate, per quanto pu\xF2 esser dato a opere fatte
    da uomini, dagli influssi del capriccio e del caso, e degne dell\u2019alto retaggio
    di cui siamo depositari e responsabili: questa \xE8 la nostra ambizione\". (as
    quoted in Antonio Cavedoni's site: http://cavedoni.com/2007/02/credo)\r\n\r\nAnd
    in German:\r\n\r\n\"Ein Buch besteht aus f\xFCnf Elementen, das sind Text, Schrift,
    Druckfarbe, Papier, und Einband. Aus diesen Elementen eine Einheit zu schaffen,
    die selbstverst\xE4ndlich \xFCberzeugt, die nicht einer Modestr\xF6mung dient,
    sondern zeitlosen Wert anstrebt, das ist unser Wunsch. Vom Zufall und Laune frei,
    soweit dies menschliche Bedingtheit vermag, kennen diese Werke nur das Ziel, sich
    w\xFCrdig in das hohe Erbe einzuf\xFCgen, das uns in Hand und Verantwortung gegeben
    wird\". (from Wikipedia)\r\n\r\nAnother authoritative Italian source, by the way,
    is more similar to your quotation; it is taken from Il Polifilo publishing house
    site, who has edited a great Mardersteig book: http://www.ilpolifilo.it/storia_txt4.php,
    and it goes like this:\r\n\r\nPer prima cosa servi l'autore,\r\ncerca la soluzione
    migliore\r\nper rendere comprensibile il testo.\r\nIn secondo luogo servi il lettore,\r\nrendigli

    but somehow the tone is wrong, more autoritarian than the german original. I think
    the original does not read like a manifesto, but rather like good advise to fellow
    printers. This is lost in this translation. I would say that something like \"without

    may be a nice thing to do when it comes to prose, but for a quoted statement,
    I think a translator should try not to obfuscate too much. Here is my version,

    to clarify, in this passage Mardersteig was addressing <em>typographic</em> design,
    not type design per se \u2014 i.e., overall page layout and text arrangement,
    and book design in particular. Obviously, his credo can be applied much more broadly;
    but when trying to interpret his original meaning, it may be helpful to keep the
    original context in mind."

  body: "Unconventional is different from original, but not opposed to it.\r\n\r\nBeing
    original means not copying from others, and that is mandatory for being considered
    a real type designer as opposed to a type plagiarist.\r\n\r\nBeing unconventional
    means not following the regular paradigms that typically govern currently popular
    type designs. Thus, Futura was unconventional when it came out, and Peignot even
    more so. Optima was very original, but less unconventional - it was so novel that
    it was still somewhat unconventional, but it was also a return to the conventions
    of serif type from sans-serif.\r\n\r\nSo if one is advising a type designer to
    keep his impulse towards being idiosyncratic in check, to serve his art humbly,
    it would be unconventionality and not originality that would be first to be deprecated.
    But too much striving after originality is not completely exempt.\r\n\r\nTo be
    at once more idiomatic and literal in the translation, I might suggest:\r\n\r\n<cite>In
    the first place, serve the author by seeking the best form for the expression
    of his ideas.</cite>\r\n\r\n<cite>In the second place, serve the reader by making
    reading as enjoyable and facile as you can.</cite>\r\n\r\n<cite>And, thirdly,
    make the work a thing of beauty without being self-indulgent.</cite>\r\n\r\nEDIT:
    Of course, though, this does fudge the most critical issue in the translation.\r\n\r\nohne
    means \"without\";\r\n\r\nthe construction zu ... zu sein means \"too much\";\r\n\r\nand
    the main issue is how to translate \"eigenwillig\".\r\n\r\nSelf-will is a fine
    literal translation of the word. But it is very unidiomatic for English. In the
    context, personal idiosyncracy is clearly enough what is referenced.\r\n\r\nIf
    one tries to be more idiomatic, though, one runs the risk of putting one's own
    theories about type design in the place of those of Mardersteig. Because what
    would be natural, in English, to insert at this point is not a characteristic
    of the designer's personality, but a characteristic of the type itself.\r\n\r\nSo
    is it that we shouldn't make type too unconventional, or avoid too much ornamentation,
    or avoid striving for the obviously novel?\r\n\r\nThis is why there are limits
    to how good a translation can be of this text while remaining faithful."

    isn't, as John notes, idiomatic or even clear English. Willful is a good English
    word, and has the connotation of being self-indulgent, capricious, stubborn\u2014the
    kind of things that it seems Mardersteig was warning against. I also like the
    idea of keeping the image of 'garb' or 'garment' in the German\u2014the metaphor
    that the designer is creating clothing for the ideas of the author. Another try:
