  what its advantages over, say, [[FontLab]] -- merely as a tool for drawing outlines
  -- are.\r\n\r\nCan it do things FontLab can't? Does it offer better algorithms for
  transforming outlines than FontLab does? Is it just simpler to use? Please share

  body: "*BUT* Some people who have learned how to think in vectors in illustrator
    find that they think & work best in Illustrator. For them it's useful to work
    in that environment. It is comfortable. Illustrtor lets you zoom in & out more
    easily / flexibly. It has some UI advantages which are real.\r\n\r\nLike Dan,
    I am used to fontlab now.  Now when I work in illustrator - even for Illustration
    - it irritates me that the vector editing behavior is not more like Fontlab. I
    am used to fontlab now. But it might be the reverse for someone else. I used to
    like Illutrator better.\r\n\r\nFrom a practical point of view, if you are going
    to make alot of fonts - or work on one serious one - you might want to just wrap
    your head around Fontlab because it will save you time in the long run ( no conversion
    process) and you can place the points where they need to go from the beginning
    instead of having to figure out where the orthodox placement of points for your
    shape should be afterwards. Optimal point placement is different in Fonts than
    in illustration - it's more restrictive.\r\n\r\nDo you know what I am talking
    about? \r\n\r\nOn the other hand If you do understand this theory then you could
    use that knowlege in Illustrator too. So...\r\n\r\nDan, when you used illustrator
    were you saavy to point placement theory already or were you using 'optomize'
    on your outline after you imported it or what? What was your experience like?"

  body: "I've noticed that people get used to one or the other program for outline
    work and then stick with it out of familiarity. The preference usually is based
    on that, rather than actual features. I personally don't want to go through conversion
    hoops from AI to FL when I can draw my outlines with all the guides, metrics,
    etc. available in each glyph window. Saves time, especially since I need to edit
    the outlines in FL anyway. I can't do much proofing with a collection of outlines
    that don't have spacing, alignment, or keyboard accessibility, and once I get
    proofing, there will be changes. If for some reason type design programs didn't
    have outline editing tools, I might consider using Illustrator, but FL (and Fontographer)
    is quite robust for outline work, and the new version will be even better.  \r\n\r\nIllustrator's
    outline editing tools are slightly different from those in FL. Specifically, nice
    shortcuts like double-clicking points to change them from corner to smooth aren't
    the same. Because I'm not used to drawing letters in AI, I prefer to do type drawing
    in a type design program. When I need to make clip art or other less structured
    outlines I use AI. \r\n\r\nTo answer your questions directly: AI doesn't offer
    any advantage in drawing letters, especially when you need to make type out of
    the letters. Illustrator isn't simpler to use or more powerful. It's all personal
    habits. "

  body: To answer your questions simply, I'd say that Illustrator is a vector drawing
    program mostly used for logo, technical objects, charts and so on. It's a ideal
    companion for a page layout software. I worked with Illustrator since the first
    version (Illustrator 88) and he always has his place on my computer. However I'm
    forced to admit that Fontlab do a better job if you want to draw letters. It's
    a ideal companion to a type designer.

  body: "Wow, looks like I'm the only one here with a differing opinion. Since I'm
    not nearly on the same professional level as many who post on this site, I prefer
    Illustrator to actually draw glyphs. I like to see all the glyphs together and
    how they relate to each other. Its easier for me to see that in Illustrator.\r\n\r\nI
    also work by drawing my letters first with pencil, scanning, then tracing...so
    Illustrator I think is better for that. I'm more comfortable with the bezier drawing
    tools in AI than in FontLab...I still find FontLab's bezier tools to be more difficult
    to use. This is not to say I might not change my mind eventually.\r\n\r\nHowever,
    I only do \"basic sketches\" in Illustrator. By far I use FL more than AI. FontLab's
    editing tools can hand Illustrator's @$$ to it on a silver platter. When using
    FontLab for glyph editing, you quickly see the major limitations of Illustrator's
    vector editing capabilities. \r\n\r\nSo in short I use Illustrator for basic glyph
    sketches, FontLab for all editing."

    and Cmd+1 to Cmd+6. \r\n\r\nThe biggest conceptual different between FontLab and
    Illustrator is that FontLab always imposes the integer-coordinate grid. Since
    the final fonts must have outline points on integer coordinates, this gives you
    full WYSIWYG but sometimes does not give you full flexibility. In Illustrator,
    you can use fractional coordinates which demands more self-control: you may end
    up with drawing some superfine design features that will be in the end impossible
    to incorporate them into the final font since they all will have to be rounded
    to integers anyway. But the final decision is of course the user's and depends
    on your preferences. \r\n\r\nRegards, \r\nAdam\r\n"

    It certainly imposes rigour on one's details.\r\n\r\nOverall, FontLab is superior.
    However, for \"Bezier sketching\", I still prefer to use Fontographer, primarily
    for one feature: \"click on handle snaps to extrema\", which FontLab lacks. I
    also like Fog's \"insert point and drag\", and its \"expand stroke\" feature works
    better than FL's (including FL's \"make parallels\").\r\n\r\nAnother thing I find
    frustrating about FL is the way when you delete a point and the adjacent point
    is the blue \"end path\", then the path goes straight and you lose your curve:

    to delete. After you delete the node, you can do \"Make node first\" on the original
    first node to restore the node order if you need to.\r\n\r\nOne caveat: Changing
    the order of the nodes will mess up any links you may have set up. The solution
    is to temporarily convert them to hints while performing the above procedure.\r\n\r\n--\r\n\r\nBack
    on topic:\r\n\r\nI used to use Illustrator to do all my drawing when I was using
    Fontographer because I didn't like the drawing tools in Fontographer. Getting
    art from Illustrator to Fontographer was very simple. Working the same way with
    FontLab is not as simple and for years this kept me from switching to FontLab.
    Then I learned to draw directly in FontLab and this became an irrelevant issue.
    Not only that, I now am able to work much more quickly and efficiently and wish
    I'd figured this out sooner.\r\n\r\nOne reason I did like working in Illustrator
    was the one Terry brought up, about being able to work with glyphs side by side,
    in context. You can get most of this functionality by keeping a metrics preview
    window open while you work. Having a second screen is especially helpful if you
    work this way. The new version of FontLab should be even better in this regard
    since it allows you to see other glyphs next to the one you're working on in the
    glyph window (or something like that). This was actually a feature I suggested
    which was picked up by Yuri on Typophile a while back. I'm not sure exactly how
    it works as I haven't been privy to the beta versions, but I'm looking forward
    to it."
