body: "Ok desperate student. . . my printer just went to printer is pushing daises
  and I need to print a final project to be made into a process book / ID standards
  book. \r\n\r\nId love to have it perfect bound and printed by a reputable company,
  its only one or two copies, and im willing to pay for quality. Just dont really
  know where to get it created. Ive had a lot of success with MPIX in my photographic
  endeavours, but they cannot BIND it together. . . and for the piece, Id rather not
  have it spiral bound.\r\n\r\nAny suggestions would help me sleep better at night\r\n\r\nThanks\r\n\r\nJames"

  body: "Acme Bookbinding in Charlestown (adjacent to Boston) Massachusetts is very
    reliable and high in quality. Although they began as library binders and then
    moved into edition biding for trade publishers, and this is the work for which
    they are best known, they also have a crackerjack short-run division capable of
    doing just one or two books.\r\n\r\nGood luck!\r\n\r\nhttp://www.acmebook.com"
