  cut off at the bottom.  Any takers? <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/24534.jpg"

  body: If there is such a font as Delphian Solid, this is it. The letterforms match
    <a href="http://www.fonts.com/findfonts/detail.asp?pid=205095" target="_blank">Delphian
    Open</a>, as far as I can tell.

  body: I agree with Mike, and probably the designer made it solid, he had to make
    changes anyway becouse of the R and A union.  A little of work in the R and a
    little bit of Squoosh

  body: OK. Here is Grace  replicated in Delphian Open, which I converted to outlines
    and either removed the white parts or moved the black parts together. I also manipulated
    the outline of the R to pull the tail down and outward a bit. I used a white square
    to block out the left leg of the A and it even created the same gap between the
    R and A. If &#34;Squooshing&#34; includes stretching, that&#39;s what was needed
    here &#40;maybe you could do that as vertical &#34;squooshing&#34;, but I actually
    widened the characters&#41;. If exactness was needed I would have played much
    longer, but I think I showed how this was probably done. <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/24695.gif"
