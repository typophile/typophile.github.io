  style of the title - Space & Vision. I don't expect to get an exact match but am
  after something in a similar vein - a simple, kinda calligraphic, ye olde style
  font. If it's available in a web format, even better. Sorry the pic is quite small
  - this is all I have on hand right now but I can retake later if necessary.\r\n\r\nAm
  also interested to know if this style of typeface has a name as I found it really
  difficult to articulate in a search!\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\nJess\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Space_4350.jpg]"
