body: "I'm looking for a typeface (either for use or for inspiration) for use in a
  logo, some of the key words are:\r\nnightlife, fun, party but still clean and professional.
  It is for a website that advertises \"packages\" for city nightlife, with different
  packages, like \"punk night out\", \"gay night out\", \"glamorous night out\" etc.
  So it can't be too this-or-that since it must work for several groups of people.
  Punks should like it, so should preps, glamorous high-fashionistas and so on. It's
  maybe vague, but anyone got any suggestions?"

    the different packages and in themselves will be very over-the-top and/or decorative
    you  might look for something simple that plays well with others. What about <a

    Too round?\r\n"

  body: "Yeah, need something that will work well with others (although we won't be
    able to play with the typography as much as wanted since this is a web-project,
    hnngh). \r\n\r\nAnd the fonts you mentioned where nice, and something I'll keep
    in mind but I do think they are a bit round, yes. Since this is \"night out\"
    it's mainly focused at young people about 20-30 that wants to go out in Oslo and
    have a few drinks, dance or get insanely drunk or whatever they want to, so I'm
    thinking something abit more... urban perhaps? "

    Many foundries don't allow embedding for the web so we need to know that too.\r\n\r\n"
