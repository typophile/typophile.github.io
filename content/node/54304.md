  you to ''gift a font'' to another user: basically purchase a license on someone
  else''s behalf and shoot them an email with download, installation and EULA instructions.
  What do you think?'

    people :)\r\n\r\nLooking at some of the stuff I get for christmas, I'd rather
    have had Gotham, or Meta Serif!"

    those of us who can't afford to give an entire font!\r\n\r\n"

    trick for me in keeping track of all those goodies i want from various sites.
    if only i could convice some poor sap to actually purchase something from that
    list for me now... :^p\r\n\r\nhttp://www.amazon.com/wishlist/get-button\r\n"

  body: I think both are a grat idea (the "gift a font to another" and the "gift card
    for a specific font foundry"). The ideal Christmas gift for a student or professional.

  body: "So, a few months later: Are there any foundries out there that offer something
    like a gift card/voucher? \r\nI'm facing another Christmas wish list where I'll
    probably settle for type books because for my relatives, the idea of buying me
    a font is\u2026 odd, and the process scary. But if there was the option for laymen
    to purchase a pretty gift card in a simple process (without having to think of
    licences, and EULAs, and all), and make a poor type-nut very happy, that'd be
    awesome."
