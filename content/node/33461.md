body: "We're having problems with Bickham Script Pro (OpenType) working in InDesign
  and Illustrator CS2. On one computer, I get a certain set of alternate glyphs, but
  when I take the file to a different computer, I get a different set of alternate
  glyphs. This happens between a Mac & Mac, and a Mac and PC.\r\n\r\nCreating a pdf
  enables me to embed the desired alternate glyphs into the document, but I can't
  edit it in a different location and maintain access to the glyphs.\r\n\r\nWhy do
  the glyph palettes vary?\r\n\r\nany thoughts? thanks!"

    issue (or a similar one?). Identical InDesign version (4.0.5) on identical Mac
    OS (10.4.9), same document, but different Glyphs while using Garamond Premier
    Pro.\r\nIn detail: Although the OT Swash option definitely wasn\u2019t activated,
    the alternative swash glyph (Q) showed up on one machine. I wondered whether we
    had different versions of that font, but didn\u2019t hunt it down."

      the same type of problem with different glyphs) in both instances.\r\n\r\nthanks
