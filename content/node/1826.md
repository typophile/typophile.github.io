body: This is a logotype I&#39;ve been working on for a law firm in Sacramento, California.  <BR>
  <BR>They are both attorneys in business, healthcare, and labor. The client would
  like a subtle reference to the &#39;capitol city&#39; , hence the dome-like union
  of the &#39;L&#39; and &#39;S&#39;. <BR> <BR>The type is set in Bembo SC and Bembo
  Italic Osf.  <BR> <BR>Please critique me! Thanks!!! <BR><IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/1934.gif"

    need that spike, some of that radial ribbing, or &#42;something&#42;. <BR> <BR>hhp '

  body: The image of the capitol dome is extremely cliche here in Sacramento. My intention
    was for the dome to be left as a subtle reference, rather than a literal translation.

  body: ' Well, then maybe people from Sacramento would see something I&#39;m not
    seeing - making it work great. In any case, the way you&#39;ve linked the two
    names is class - dome or no dome. <BR> <BR>hhp '

  body: ' The dome doesn&#39;t say dome to me... But I  <BR>don&#39;t  think it&#39;s
    wrong necessarily. <BR> <BR>You just have to ask yourself if it&#39;s too subtle
    to  <BR>bother with -- as if it can only be seen when  <BR>someone points it out.  <BR>
    <BR>Bembo is a nice choice. '

  body: ' I definitely hear what you&#39;re saying about the dome. Forunately some
    of the other designers are working on solutions that are much more literal. <BR>
    <BR>Given that--do you think the logotype needs any fine tuning? '

  body: ' Well, it does need some spacing work. Like &#34;UY&#34; is too loose, &#34;IM&#34;
    is too tight, and some others. Latin caps generally benefit from looseness, although
    that&#39;s of course problematic in a logotype. In contrast, the second line I
    think is too loose, especially considering its &#34;informality&#34;. BTW, would
    the rule look better shorter? Lastly, the comma&#39;s too big. What if you replace
    the comma with a tilde-thingie, to echo that dome ligature? <BR> <BR>BTW, that
    UC &#34;K&#34; I think &#34;opens&#34; the logo very nicely. <BR> <BR>hhp '
