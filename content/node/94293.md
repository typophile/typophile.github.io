body: This font was on a book in the movie the fountain. I've tried identifying it
  everywhere but failed miserably. I even cleared out all the colors and made it clear.
  Can anyone help me?

    not up to date with the definition of a \u2018font\u2019, as practiced on this
    site, as opposed to \u2018lettering\u2019. To make a long story short: there are
    fonts inspired by / based on this style of lettering (or calligraphy). The best
    known is Zapf Chancery. Start there and find similar fonts with more flourishes
    and swashes."
