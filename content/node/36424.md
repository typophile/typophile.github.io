    you need some of the others as well. I am pretty sure some of Gabriel shots are
    yours. But you would have to tell me for me to be sure. Feel free to do that BTW."

  body: Eben, some of these are among the best type conference photos ever--intensity,
    drama, people being themselves. Excellent!

  body: "I am glad you are enjoying them. :-) I am too. \r\n\r\nI was definitely hoping
    for natural expression. And looking for it. Of course, having the large zoom with
    a 2.8 apature let me take shots from further away and in lower light. That helped
    for sure too.\r\n\r\nActually I am have been very impressed with the photos in
    the Typecon stream in general. Did you check out Nick Sherman's stuff for instance?"

  body: "Small corrections: \r\n<ul><li>It's \"TypeCon\" (capital C, camel case).</li>
    <li>This is getting picky, but according to Flickr terminology, the collection
    of photos in a group is called a \"pool\", not a \"stream\". You have your own
    personal photo <em>stream</em> which is basically all your uploaded images in
    chronological order. The TypeCon Group has a photo <em>pool</em> because it includes
    photos from multiple Flickr users.</li></ul>\r\n\r\nLove 'em, Eben. Checko is
    starting to add <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/31543583@N00/tags/typecon/\">his</a>
    too!"
