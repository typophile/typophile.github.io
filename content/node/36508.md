body: When I am flowing placed text and automatically generating new pages in Indesign
  CS3, is there a reason that I would want to flow into a text frame that originally
  existed on the master page? Or should I just create the frame on the first real
  page of the document? The Indesign help sort of dances around in discussing this
  stuff, but keeping the text frame off the master page seems sensible to me.

  body: If the text is supposed to be in a text frame of the same size and location
    on each document page (e.g. as in a novel), you'll want to have the frames your
    flowing it into based on that master. But you don't put the text in the frame
    on the master page itself, of course, unless you want the same text on every page.
