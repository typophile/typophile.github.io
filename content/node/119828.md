body: "I posted here for the first time a couple of weeks ago, asking for some technical
  recommendations for creating a typeface from some letters I had designed. I have
  not designed a typeface before now; this is my first attempt.\r\n\r\nThe replies
  I received were helpful, so I thought I would share the result:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.danielmitsui.com/00_misc/benedict_sample2.jpg\r\nhttp://www.danielmitsui.com/00_misc/benedict_sample.jpg\r\n\r\nI
  am an artist who specializes in ink drawing, mostly in the style of 14th & 15th
  century illuminated manuscripts. I am working to publish my own illustrated versions
  of blockbooks from that era; this typeface is what I intend to use for these projects.
  \r\n\r\nI wanted something that marries well to a late Gothic drawing style, but
  is more readable to modern eyes than blackletter."

    Your blend of ancient calligraphic styles (Oncial, Textura, Rotunda) is pleasant
    and you even integrates the Art Nouveau for your Roman."

    codepoints.

  body: Daniel, I really like what you have done - has the historic feel but is easy
    to read - keep up the good work.

  body: "Thank you. I have updated the samples with a few revisions. \r\n\r\nThe illustration
    is my own. The full broadside looks like this:\r\n\r\nhttp://danielmitsui.tripod.com/00_misc/eqb.jpg\r\n\r\nIf
