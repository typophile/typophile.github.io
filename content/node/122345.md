  as communication student. I found phenomenon that constructivism typography are
  famous and strongly applied among Indonesian proletariat. Due to Indonesia was the
  third biggest communist nation after Soviet and China, (but now we are adopting
  American democracy, capitalism and liberalism). Is it having relationship between
  constructivism and communism as ideology. Does Constructivism art (esp. typography)
  correlate Communism?\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nGunarta"

    Book]]</em>.\r\n\r\nYou could also read Jan Tschichold's preface to <em>The New
    Typography</em> (<em>The New World View</em>).\r\n\r\nAlso Tschichold wrote the
    essay <em>Wirken sich gesellschaftliche und politische Umst\xE4nde in der Typographie
    aus?</em> (<em>Does Political and Social Context Influence Typography?</em>),
    but, it seems, it is not translated to English.\r\n\r\nOf course, it does.\r\n\r\nConstructivism
    is connected with communist ideas same way as neoclassicism of 20th century is
    connected with totalitarianism and fascism, or as romanticism is connected with
    French Revolution... But it's too general conclusion.\r\n\r\nCould you show some
    examples of Indonesian constructivism?"

    look at it differently than average folks who may know little about the subject.

    body: Yes. I was doubt to my self that something constructive to me actually just
      a simplest way of creating letters for them.

    in mind that the deconstruction and reconstruction of letters is a process which
    is always going on, in type design as well as in vernacular lettering or avant-garde
    art movements."

  body: "The constructivist aesthetic, like communism itself, reflects a sometimes-uneasy
    relationship between the things people make and the process of making them.\r\n\r\nConstructivist
    typography celebrated the fact that printing is an industrial process, unlike
    drawing or painting. The geometry of the constructivist poster is the mirror of
    the metal type locked up in the bed of the printing press. At the same time, constructivist
    artists set up a kind of Marxist dialectic by doing things with metal type that
    it wasn't designed to do, such as setting it on a curved line or a diagonal.\r\n\r\nTo
    my eye, the contemporary Indonesian examples don't look like the constructivist
    typography of early Communist-era Russia. For example, the Russian constructivists
    often preferred asymmetrical compositions, but the Indonesian signs are mostly
    symmetrical. What the Indonesian signs have in common with constructivist posters
    is:\r\n(1) The process of making them--in this case, hand-painting--is part of
    the aesthetic. \r\n(2) The artists use letterforms as decorative shapes, not just
    as pieces of words. (<em>Es bir kocok</em> is an especially good example.)\r\n\r\nThe
    individuality and inventiveness of hand-painted signs has all but disappeared
    from the US, and it's a great loss. I hope that Indonesia doesn't see its vernacular
    art displaced by the ubiquitous Arial and Comic Sans."

  body: "Gunarta, I'm surprised that you referred to Indonesia as a formerly Communist
    country. If my history lessons haven't failed me, Indonesia once had a very influential
    Communist party that very nearly came to power in a coup during the mid 1960s.
    After that the party was pretty much dismantled and made illegal.\r\n\r\nAs for
    constructivist art and type, yes, it's associated with Communism, but it's simply
    a stylistic association dating back to the Bolsheviks. The example signs look
    to me as though they were painted that way mainly because blockish sorts of letters
    are easier to paint by hand."

  body: "Gunarta, the signs you posted don't look Constructivist or communist to me
    (although perhaps in your country there are cultural associations that I don't
    have). The switch to digital sign making is because it's a faster and cheaper
    way to make signs and doesn't require the services of skilled hand letterers.\r\n\r\nIf
    you Google \"Constructivist Art\" and click the Images link you'll get a general
    idea of what this art looks like."
