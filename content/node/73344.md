    to the Acute but to the Umlaut, then why not form a variation on the Umlaut rather
    than attempting to somehow fit two (full) Acutes into this impossibly confined
    space?\r\n\r\nThe Hungarumlaut is a rather modern invention after all. I don't
    think that it has enough \"tradition\" to definitively determine what the best
    presentation under such circumstances should be. I doubt though that anyone would
    frown on you, if you attempt to be a bit innovative with this diacritic.\r\n\r\nJMHO."

    this from Hungarians. FWIW I had a Hungarian acquaintance (a layman regarding
    type) check my own hungarumlauts (although that was in lowercase, in a text font)
    and got a strong reaction that hungarumlauts which do not match the angle of the
    acute look \xABwrong\xBB. Hungarian does use acutes as well, so the two would
    appear next to each other.\r\n\r\nBTW, what's the story about the hungarumlaut
    relating to the umlaut rather than the acute? Deducing this from the name alone
    seems like wonky logic to me; in Hungarian the thing isn't called hungarumlaut
    of course, but something like \xABdouble accent\xBB AFAIK."

    this hungarumlaut has more to do with the acute than the dieresis."

    of what acts on what. The acute (at least in Hungarian) is used to extend certain
    vowels, while the umlaut alters the sound properties of its base vowel. The hungarumlaut
    does not extent the sound of the base vowel, but of the umlaut(ed) one. Although
    it shares the lengthening properties of the Acute, it <em>acts</em> specifically
    and uniquely on the umlaut alone. A hungarumlaut can be viewed therefore as a
    version or form of the umlaut. \u0150 is a \"version\" of \xD6 in the same way
    that \xC1 is a version of A (it is in fact a representation of AA).\r\n\r\nThis
    view is hardly science, and is clearly open for debate. Perhaps a linguist could
    step in and shed some light on the linguistic and phonological conventions that
    are involved.\r\n\r\n<em>Could you say a bit more about that?</em>\r\n\r\nThe
    fact is that the great Mikl\xF3s Kis never used the hungarumlaut. In fact, according
    to [[http://www.font.hu/hrant.html|this]] informative page, the hungarumlaut wasn't
    used in print with any degree of consistency until around the 19th century. So
    yes, typographically speaking that would make its common use in print a recent
    phenomena. Also note that various printers over the years have used alternative
    diacritics to mark the extended umlaut, and no one stoned them for typographic
    blasphemy.\r\n\r\nThe bottom line of my argument though was simple; when faced
    with certain technical and physical constraints, there could and should be room
    to exercise some typographic ingenuity and find alternative ways to mark sounds,
    and in this particular case the extended umlaut. \r\n\r\nTypography is not written
    in stone but on paper"

  body: "This group of diacritics (i.e. single and double acute accents) in Hungarian
    is called 'hossz\xFA \xE9kezet' and they usually signify where the 'long' version
    of the standard phoneme is to be pronounced instead of the short one (except for
    'a' and 'e' where the 'long' version is in fact a different vowel). That is to
    say, phonetically speaking hungarumlauts as well are longer versions of their
    respective short counterparts and thus could be thought of as elongated umlauts.
    (This is only true of the '\xF6-\u0151', 'i-\xED' and '\xFC-\u0171' pairs however,
    as in the case of 'o' and 'u' (and uppercase 'I') you don't have any diacritical
    marks to begin with.)\r\n\r\nAs to the aesthetic issue, I find low angle acutes
    rather outlandish."
