  body: Not bad.  <BR>Will there be additional text? Subline? <BR>Is the connotation
    to liqueur dangerous? <BR>You will have to make the dark B in the white circle
    bolder. <BR> <BR>-- <BR>Soren O

  body: the moment i saw it i thought GE, but that is perhaps more a statement of
    their ability to put their brand out there than any real similarities. <BR> <BR>the
    &#39;ra&#39; feels a bit loose, but i really like the colour palette. <BR> <BR>are
    you using the same typeface for smaller copy?

  body: some how to me, the font does not fit well with the &#34;button&#34;, you
    should try another one and try to see in wich ubication fits better with the circle.
    <BR> <BR>i also like the color and the simplicity, but why BRANDY, is there a
    relation with the liquiour? if it is, yo should treat the concept with a more
    creative-graphic way, if there is not a relation your graphic identity should
    work better on telling me that you are a design studio, because right now it more
    looks like an hotel card to me. <BR> <BR>let me know if my english works for you,
    if not maybe i can post it in spanish. <BR> <BR>keep the good work <BR> <BR>CG

  body: That circle-B marque reminds me of Belk and Boscov&#39;s department stores.
    I also agree with Cristian that the sans face doesn&#39;t mesh with the logotype;
    a serif face might work better.
