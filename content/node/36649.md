  body: "I ran into an interesting usage in the German magazine Value. The middle
    pages were printed digitally. The Photofont is made to look like the old mirror-image
    lead letters used prior to phototypesetting. I include an image of it. [img:sites/default/files/old-images/Photofont
    example_5351.png] \r\nThe nifty aspect of it was the ability to use it for personalization
    within digital print, each copy was different, regardless of the number of copies.
    The personalization was realized using the Adobe Scripting interface of Indesign
    and Photoshop. \r\nWith marketing become ever more personalized, this new tool
    is sure to be used often, especially in targeted personalized marketing. Presently
    it presses the border of realizability within the printing industry. It can only
    be done in digital printing. The author wrote the script for the automation himself,
    but customers will be interested in such personalizations. The main body of the
    magazine was still printed in offset, the cover was printed separately and the
    middle pages with the personalization were printed digitally.\r\n\r\nBest regards,\r\nSteven

  body: From talking to the Fontlab guys at Typecon I got the impression that very
    few people are using Photofont right now, but that the next version of the technology
    will support more design programs and be much more likely to catch on.

  body: "Thanks Miss Tiffany,\r\n\r\nfor me it sounds like a great idea!\r\n\r\nYears
    ago (more than 10 ;-) I played with the idea to have some kind of typeface that
    workes digitally but would use in fact analogic designed letters like in old photographic
    reproduction. So we could keep a hand designed form and not using Bezier curves
    that changed our world and the way we see forms totally. And I am still not quite
    sure wether this change was a good thing for I am convinced Bezier curves influence
    on form. It is no longer natural like a tree, a human hand or what ever. Curved
    forms had become different from what we see in nature. Thats my opinion. \r\nOk
    I see this is another theme, but...\r\nthanks anyhow for this interesting news!\r\n\r\nStefan"

  body: "> so, it\u2019s a bitmap file stored in a font file? \r\n> is it machine
    readable?\r\n\r\nI\u2019m not sure I understand the question. What do you mean
    by \"machine readable\"? \r\n\r\nA <a href=\"http://www.photofont.com/\"><strong>photofont</strong></a>
    is one or more PNG images stored as separate files or packaged together, along
    with an XML file that defines the glyph coordinates (i.e. bounding boxes), metrics,
    kerning, encoding and other font-relevant data. \r\n\r\nCurrently, <a href=\"http://www.fontlab.com/font-editor/bitfonter/\"><strong>BitFonter
    3</strong></a> by Fontlab Ltd. is the only commercial application that allows
    people to create photofonts. However, the format of a photofont is simple (since
    it relies on public standards like XML and PNG) and <a href=\"http://www.photofont.com/\">documented</a>
    and some people have successfully created photofonts using PHP or Python scripts.
    \r\n\r\nAt this time, one application that allows people to use photofonts is
    the <a href=\"http://www.fontlab.com/photofont/start/\"><strong>Photofont Start</strong></a>
    plugin for Adobe Photoshop and other applications. It is free and within the next
    few days, we will release version 2 of the plugin that will support Photoshop
    CS3 on Intel Macs, and which will be about <em>10x faster</em>. \r\n\r\nAlso,
    em2 Solution\u2019s <a href=\"http://xcgfk.em2-solutions.com/info/demos.htm\">XcgfK</a>
    font rendering engine supports photofonts natively, making them usable on mobile
    devices. \r\n\r\nAt TypoTechnica 2007, we have previewed our next product, which
    will be a converter that turns photofonts into Flash files, allowing users to
    embed dynamic text headlines on their websites using <a href=\"http://www.mikeindustries.com/sifr/\">sIFR</a>
    and similar techniques \u2014 something that Typophile uses to render its custom
    headings as well. The converter is under development and should be available fairly
    soon. \r\n\r\nFontlab Ltd. is also working on plugins for InDesign and QuarkXPress,
    allowing users to use photofonts directly in those applications. \r\n\r\nFurther
    links: \r\n<ul>\r\n<li>some <a href=\"http://community.livejournal.com/ru_typography/331017.html\">photofont
    examples</a> developed by two Russian designers</li>\r\n<li>the previous <a href=\"http://www.typophile.com/node/18963\">Typophile
    thread</a> on photofonts</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\nAdam Twardoch\r\nFontlab
