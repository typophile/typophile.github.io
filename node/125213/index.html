  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">I have a loan document that was created in November 1991 by an attorney using an early Apple or McIntosh computer, probably a Mac SE. The computer is long gone and my attorney passed away in 2006. I think he was using some sort of business form software created for Apple. The type face in question is identical to Tahoma but Tahoma was not introduced until 1994. I&rsquo;m told that Tahoma is a knock off of several other fonts that were in use decades ago and may have been created by Susan Kare or Adrian Fruitiger. Can anyone confirm my suspicions or has anyone used that early business form software I am referring to? Your help is appreciated. Sincerely, Tom</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Your sample is not much to go on. It would be helpful if you could post more example characters than this.</p>
<p>It does look like Tahoma, but I am not aware of any typefaces older than Tahoma that would be this close. Whoever told you Tahoma was a knockoff was wrong. Your sample does not match any Frutiger fonts that I know of, and Susan Kare only designed bitmapped fonts for Apple. Tahoma resembles older typefaces in only the most superficial sense.</p>
<p>In November 1991, TrueType fonts were very new. Among the initial set of TrueType fonts that Apple shipped, none looked much like Tahoma. (The fonts were Times, Helvetica, Courier, and TrueType versions of Kare&rsquo;s earlier bitmapped fonts Geneva, New York, Chicago, and Monaco.)</p>

The point from me is not that these two faces, designed a decade apart for the same general purpose, don&rsquo;t look alike to us, but rather that they would be not be very distiguishable to most. So, someone who has become familiar with Tahoma, and has barely ever seen Geneva, might look at Geneva and think it Tacoma. That&rsquo;s all.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">One of the biggest problems with Stiehl is that he uses a very pejorative word, “forgery,” in a completely inappropriate way. Part of the meaning of forgery is, yes, producing a copy of something. But the other part, what makes it “bad,” is passing it off as the original. A forgery is claimed to be the thing it is imitating. This does not, in general, happen with fonts. Everyone agrees that Dutch 801 is imitating Times (New) Roman; Bitstream never took Dutch 801 and labeled it as Times New Roman to sell it as the original. So “forgery” is a totally inappropriate word to use, in English.
It is as if somebody made by hand a copy of the Mona Lisa, clearly labeled it as a copy/imitation, and somebody else accused them of forgery just because they imitated it. Utter nonsense.</div>

<p>Adria Frutiger, yes that&rsquo;s it —Adrian&rsquo;s unknown sister. Now it all makes sense. Long thought to have vanished with aliens during a canoeing encounter on the Loire, she was taken to the planet Comma Superiorè, raised by raster demons, sand drivers and pixel sprites before being returned to earth as Susan Kare, just in time to work on the Mac.  A Frutiger, BTW is a kind of giant European house cat, originally bred in the Frü province of northern Italy. You can read all about it on the website I launched in 1873. Y&rsquo;all must know it to be true because, in over 125 Saturnian years, no one&rsquo;s ever sued me. People only get sued if they lie, or no, if they don&rsquo;t get sued they must be telling the truth. Forgers, smugglers, the vipers Vanguard, Uli jungle fever! Batman help us all, or not, if you&rsquo;re too Busy watching reruns.</p>

<blockquote>Jim Vanguard
Tahoma is a clone of VBF-42, a proprietary typeface designed by Adria Frutiger in 1965. It was revised in 1978 and again in 1989 for use with Windows 3.0 and early Macintosh. VBF42 was the resident font in software sold by Vanguard Business Forms until the company was purchased in 1994.</blockquote>
<p>So is that the last word on this? No, not at all, because it isn&rsquo;t the truth. That &ldquo;person&rdquo; who wrote it does not legally exist under that name in the US. It is a lame attempt to mislead people by someone who made their very first post here using a name which was made up to imply they had information about the mysterious Vanguard Business Forms company and its proprietary font.</p>
<p>In the 1990 Census for the US, of the 88,799 surnames listed, &ldquo;Vanguard&rdquo; does not appear. Nor does it appear anywhere in the 2010 Census of 162,252 surnames.</p>
<p>There are too many loose ends in this story that don&rsquo;t tie up neatly. That&rsquo;s why it matters.</p>
