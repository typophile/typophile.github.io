  used for the text \"Barthelemy Ferrer Fils.\" It's vintage French receipt from 1911.
  \r\n\r\nIt would also be great to know they typeface used for the BF inside the
  shield on the left. \r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/VINTAGE-FRENCH-RECEIPT-WITH-BF_4955.jpg]"

  body: "Engraving--note the way the tips come to sharp points. Can't do that with
    metal type. Well executed--differences between repeating letters are not obvious
    and treatment of serifs etc is very consistent.\r\n\"Barthelemy Ferrer Fils.\"
    is in a style that probably looked a little old fashioned in 1911.\r\nExcept for
    the shadow line it is not very different from a narrow 19th century \"Latin.\"
    Here are a few -- mostly too wide and with differences in details -- Latin CT

    or   More digging might find something closer.\r\nDon"

  body: "As for BF, it's again engraving of an idea to fit the two letters together
    in a monogram. The big slashing serif on the top stroke of the F is very 19th
    century. If you want more of this sort of exuberance, I suggest Ronaldson http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/canadatype/ronaldson/
    or it's offspring Tiffany http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/itc/tiffany/\r\nDon"

  body: "Don's suggestions are probably better, but I thought I'd mention two I thought
    might work nicely with an added shadow. They have fewer big latin serifs but,
    to me, match the upright, more squared-off appearance better. Both date from just
    before 1900.\r\n\r\n<a href='http://old.myfonts.com/fonts/spiecegraphics/asteroid-primo/'
    target='_blank'>Asteroid Primo Two</a> and <a href='http://old.myfonts.com/fonts/solotype/estienne/'
    target='_blank'>Estienne</a>\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, in both cases, the 'S' rather
    gives away the Art Nouveau roots, but Asteroid comes with a small caps version
    and Asteroid One has lightly ornamented caps for the F and T."

  body: "Hi Mike, Asteroid Primo Two by Jim Spiece is a good addition to the list
    of possible substitutes, although Latin CT still seems the best one so far. Jim
    Spiece is not very forthcoming as to his source for the design,.  Asteroid Primo
    Two seems to be a simplified and conventionalized version of Asteroid Primo One.
    As for  Asteroid Primo One, it  is very similar to Ambrosia LHF http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/letterheadfonts/lhf-ambrosia/
    and http://www.letterheadfonts.com/fonts/ambrosia.php Perhaps Ambrosia is the
    1900ca name for this design? Dan X. Solo used the term Asteroid, but he was known
    for renaming old typefaces. May be in one of the old type specimen books. Whatever
    it was called, here it is in an engraved version used in a Brooklyn liquor license
    from about the 1890s\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/BrooklynLiquorLicense1890caTypophile101844_6363.jpg]\r\nDon"

  body: Hadn't the time to dig this one unfortunately. Actually, too many great letterings
    on this one... Wow, I wish all actual advertisings were like this one. I directly
    thought about [[http://www.letterheadfonts.com|Letterhead Fonts]] without reminding
    an exact one and knowing LHF are most of the time a bit fancy/catchy/cheesy/too
    much (to my taste at least) and less classy than this one. LHF Ambrosia might
    be the closest until somebody found somebody closer but less flourish. Adding
    for,the moment another LHF, [[http://www.letterheadfonts.com/fonts/ironhorse.php|Iron
    Horse]]. I'd try to have a look to Solotype collection tomorrow to see if there's
    some more.

    from Birch http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/adobe/birch/ Like the other narrow Latins,
    this could be used as a base for making letters similar to the engraving.\r\nDon"

    what it's worth, I'd probably start with [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/shinn/beaufort|Beaufort]]
    Condensed as base font and try to rework some terminals as flourish. This one
    could also work for the /BF initials on the badge you're after too."
