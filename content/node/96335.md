  of capital sans-serif letters that are already condensed (think of Berthold Akzidenz
  Grotesk Bold Condensed or Knockout 49). I just need to create a new version, a little
  more compressed.\r\n\r\n(Unfortunately, I can't show anything since it's a commercial
  project that isn't announced yet).\r\n\r\nDo you have any advice on how to condense
  a typeface ? It's pretty straightforward, but I'm sure there are little expert details
  that I can't think of right now. Optical adjustments, straight vs. curvy letters,
  negative space, etc.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance !"

    of glyph weight vis-a-vis one another is the goal, not consistency of stem width.\r\nLook
    at Frutiger\u2019s fonts to see how forthright he is in implementing this principle.\r\n"
