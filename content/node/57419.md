  body: "It looks like your sample is hand-drawn, because the s's are not identical,
    as well as the observation that the \"blackletter\" style they used is unconventional.
    Something like Jason Walcott's \"Baroque Text\" or \"Ferox\" by Miles Newlin might
    have a similar non-traditional blackletter feel.\r\n\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
