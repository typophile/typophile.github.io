  good news is that it is really helping keep the spammers at bay. \r\n\r\nHowever,
  a lot of you seasoned Typophiles are getting legitimate posts flagged by the spam
  engine. As frustrating as this is, we're going through an essential period of training
  the engine to know which comments are legitimate and which are not. Bear with us,
  and this will soon be behind us. \r\n\r\nIf you are seeing specific patterns about
  why your posts are being flagged, please share them below.\r\n\r\nThanks-"

  body: Nick Shinn made a good point in one of his posts -- the new filters don't
    seem to take into account how long someone has been registered at Typophile, yet
    most spammers have a quite new registration.

    very simple rule: anyone who posts more than four times in the first twenty-four
    hours he or she is registered should be flagged for human inspection, and anyone
    who posts more that a dozen times in the same time period should be sent to Hell,
    forthwith..."

    spam is from new accounts. \r\n\r\nFocus on screening posts from new accounts,
    and give older accounts an automatic pass unless there is a major red flag. On
    the rare occasions when an old account is used for spam, it can be deleted manually
    later. \r\n\r\n"

    on the ease of implementation, but seems that one option would be that all new
    user posts have to be moderated. \r\n\r\nOf course, if the moderation can't happen
    in a timely manner, that'd frustrate new legitimate users so perhaps is a big
    drawback. "

    whitelists? If so that might be the best way.\r\n\r\nI agree that moderation is
    the worst solution because new users will post multiple times, not understanding
    what is happening."

  body: "> new users will post multiple times, not \r\n> understanding what is happening\r\n\r\nYes
    that can happen, but you can reduce it by explaining the delay clearly to the
    poster. I've posted at sites where you get an automatic message like: \"Your post
    will appear after it's approved by a moderator (usually within 24 hours)\". But
    posts from whitelisted accounts actually appear immediately, it's only the new
    member posts that get reviewed."

    authority on community systems, recommends this. he did it for Yahoo Answers,
    and it was highly effective. the idea being, you don't have to get rid of all
    spam outright, just slow the spammers down enough to make it uneconomical.\r\n\r\n"

    blocking the user a billion times that kills you. Spambots are quite automated
    SOBs.

  body: "users should remove spam as well. from his book, Building Web Reputation
    Systems.\r\n<blockquote>\r\nYahoo! Answers decided to let users themselves remove
    content from display on the site because of the staff backlog. Because response
    time for abusive content complaints averaged 12 hours, most of the potential damage
    had already been done by the time the offending content was removed. By building
    a corporate karma system that allowed users to report abusive content, Yahoo!
    Answers dropped the average amount of time that bad content was displayed to 30
    seconds. Sure, customer care staff was still involved with the hardcore problem
    cases of swastikas, child abuse, and porn spammers, but most abusive content came
    to be completely policed by users.\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\nWith
    the final iteration, the designers had incorporated all the desired features,
    giving historically trusted users the power to hide spam and troll-generated content
    almost instantly while preventing abusive users from hiding content posted by
    legitimate users. This model was projected to reduce the load on customer care
    by at least 90% and maybe even as much as 99%. There was little doubt that the
    worst content would be removed from the site significantly faster than the typical
    12+ hour response time. \r\n</blockquote>"
