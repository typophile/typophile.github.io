		<div class="commentbody">Peter &ndash; <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I'm going to guess that what is happening is the translation from FOG to Postscript to FL. Postscript doesn't make a distinction about point types, coding only the coordinates of the on-curve points and the associated control points. If I'm not mistaken, PS doesn't handle decimal places, so coordinates are rounded to the nearest integer when a PS font is generated. Non-orthogonal curves and tangents are particularly susceptible to this. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->When FL reads the PS data from the font, I'm guessing that if the points aren't exactly colinear (due to rounding) that FL will not interpret them as tangent points per se. I would presume that your points and controls are still in the proper places (allowing for rounding). I'd be curious to see a screenshot with the control handles showing. For instance, did FL add a handle to the bottom side of that lower, outside curve point? <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I'm just starting the arduous transition to FL myself and am by no means an expert.

		<div class="commentbody">Peter &ndash; <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I've been thinking about this and spending some time with the FontLab manual.  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I had an insight that I think might help. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The FOG model is point-based. But the FontLab model is segment-based.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->What I mean is that in FOG you are usually focused on what kind of point  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->you're placing. Whereas in FL, the emphasis is on what kind of line segment  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->is being operated on. FOG has three kinds of points &ndash; corner, curve, and  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->tangent. FL doesn't make these distinctions. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->FL distinguishes between two different kinds of line segment &ndash; a straight line  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->(which they also call a <!-- raw HTML omitted -->vector<!-- raw HTML omitted -->) and a curve (a bezier curve). A curve is described  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->by four points &ndash; two end points on the curve (<!-- raw HTML omitted -->nodes<!-- raw HTML omitted -->) and the two bezier  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->control points on the handles. A straight line is controlled by only two nodes &ndash;  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->one at either end, with no control handles. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->FL also distinguishes two different kinds of transitions between line segments &ndash;  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->a node can either be a smooth connection or a sharp connection. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->So, if you have a curve meeting another curve, then the node will have two  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->control handles, one contributing to each of the two curves. If the connection  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->is smooth, then the two handles will be co-linear &ndash; that is, they are linked  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->and stay aligned with each other &ndash; so this kind of node is what FOG would call  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->a curve point.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->If two curves meet and the connection is sharp, then the two control handles  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->can be moved independent from one another. This node would then constitute  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->a corner point in FOG. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->If two straight line segments meet, then the node does not have any control  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->handles and is necessarily sharp. This would also be considered a corner point  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->in FOG. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->If a straight line meets a curve, then the node will have one control handle on  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->the curve side. If the connection is sharp, then this control handle can move  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->any which way and the node would be considered a corner point in FOG.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->But if the connection is smooth, then the control handle on the curve side  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->will be co-linear with the vector segment meeting up with the curve and will  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->only move in a line with this vector &ndash; and this is what FOG would call  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->a tangent point. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Does this help? <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->So, you need to notice whether the node between a straight line and a curve  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->is smooth or sharp. When it is selected, you will see off to the side of the  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->node either a circle (smooth connection) or an x (sharp connection). You can  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->also turn on all connection types for every node, whether selected or not, by  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->selecting the button from the View/Show Layers toolbar. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->So, for example, if you select the node on the top of the inside of your  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->counter, you will see whether it is a smooth connection or not. If it isn't,  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->then double click the node to toggle the connection style. When the connection  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->is smooth, then you can change the &quot;curve&quot; on the right side to a straight line  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->by selecting the right control handle of the node and deleting it. (Deleting  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->either control handle of a segment will convert it to a straight line vector, since  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->a curve needs to be defined by two control handles.) <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Once the right-hand segment is a straight line and the left-hand segment is a  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->curve and the node is a smooth connection, then the handle on the left will  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->only move in line with the straight segment and you will have, in effect, a  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->tangent point. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I hope this makes sense and is helpful. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&ndash; Kent. <!-- raw HTML omitted --></div>

		<div class="commentbody">To follow up on Kent's thorough description, I wanted to add that FL has an excellent way of keeping users on their toes with regard to what is allowed in the world of PostScript Type 1 fonts: <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->FL doesn't let you form a curve by anything other than two points with control handles. In Fontographer, you're allowed to create a curve that has a BCP handle on one end, and an &quot;empty&quot; point on the other end. But this can produce errors, since it is effectively creating a point-on-top-of-point situation. FL shows you that this is happening by immediately introducing a complimentary BCP handle when you create a curved segment. It invites you to define the curve properly. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->FL also makes you aware of the nature of Type 1 curves, by making the &quot;closepath&quot; and start/end points a tangible part of the path. This can be disorienting at first, and seem like a hassle, but it reveals the nature of the curves and allows greater control. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Lastly, if you turn on the &quot;connection type&quot; layer as Kent suggests, FL does another neat thing: when two consecutive BCP handles cross each other's paths, the connection type indicator flips to the opposite side of the point, notifying you that the curve is not constructed as well as it could be. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Lastly lastly, setting the preferences to show points in color is another handy visual cue.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Yes, Hrant. To the best of my knowledge, that is considered a Type 1 no-no. It's my understanding that BCPs are considered points, along with vertices. When you create a one-sided curve, you are invisibly creating a BCP on the opposite end of the curve. That invisible BCP (invisible in Fog, at least) is located directly on top of the vertex, so then you have a point-on-point situation. Whether or not this is as likely to cause spiking as two vertices on top of each other, I'm not sure. But it's worth staying away from it (yeah, it's annoying, I agree). <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Alan</div>

The yellow dot you see in the middle of that point is a BCP that is lying directly on top of its vertex. (This is how FL translates the &quot;empty&quot; point when the other side has a BCP.)

		<div class="commentbody">There is no way to draw a precise circle with the cubic Bezier curve, but it is possible to approximate it. You can draw a 1/4 of a circle (90 degrees) with a single curve with a minimal error: to do that you need to set a length of each BCP to that magical factor multiplied to circle radius. As an experiment you can draw a circle in FL (it will produce 4 curves) and measure the length of each curve's BCP. Then take a calculator and divide it to half of the curve's diameter. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Btw, it looks that calcualtion in my previous message may not give the best approximation. It will place the middle point of the curve exactly on the circle, but total approximation error may not be minimal. To calculate the ideal &quot;factor&quot; you need to render a curve and then approximate it with the curve minimizing the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->total<!-- raw HTML omitted --> error. As I understand it is how we got the original value.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Well, it's probably not really related to the main issue. But here's an explanation: if you draw a &quot;perfect&quot; circle (using the application's tool, or maybe a physical one and then trace it), and you measure the length of the BCP arms in each quadrant, they are about 0.552 of the whole length. This is the value required in cubic bezier math to get a &quot;perfect&quot; circle. BTW, &quot;perfect&quot; is in quotes because you really can't represent a true circle in beziers (of any order). <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The way this <!-- raw HTML omitted -->might<!-- raw HTML omitted --> be related to the main issue is this: if you were to convert a one-sided curve to a near-equivalent two-sided one, some sort of preset factor values might be the trick. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->hhp <!-- raw HTML omitted --></div>
