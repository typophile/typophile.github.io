<div class="post-content e-content" itemprop=articleBody>Speaking of Zoroastrianism, the stuff Willam mentioned actually originates from there. <br>Zoroastrianism is the true wellspring of all [western] faith in "ethical behavior". <br>But you won't hear that west of Iran. <br> <br>hhp</div>

<div class=commentbody>>Zoroastrianism is the true wellspring of all [western] faith in "ethical behavior". <br> <br>Huh? Abraham is 1700 BCE probably, Moses is 1300 BCE, and Jews don't have intimate contact with Zoroasterianism until about 500 BCE., when they are exiled in Babylon. There I think they pick up the ideas of heaven and hell, the end of days, resurection. None of these are in the Torah, which is fully written down by 1000 BCE roughly, the time of King David. The focus on ethics was there way before the Babylonian exile, and the ethical ideas from Abraham and Moses continue in Rabbinic Judaism, then subsequently Christianity and Islam. <br> <br>If you know some other history give me the references.</div>

<div class=commentbody>James, I get that you were raising another interesting question. I <br>just thought I'd take a stab at an answer -- and by no means a <br>perfect one. I didn't take your comment as advocating one <br>thing or another. <br> <br>Marc, I read it in high school, so forgive me if my facts are <br>fuzzy but his early mantra advocated "by any means necessary." <br>Later in his life (after prison, as he became a Muslim and went to <br>Africa) he changed his take on the whole thing and was a much <br>stronger advocate of peaceful resolution. <br> <br>I'll shut up now... I'm no Malcolm X historian, and nor do I have <br>all these nuances of issues resolved in my own mind (relating to <br>the bigger ethical discussion here). I do find this discussion very <br>interesting though, and am fascinated by others' views.</div>

<div class=commentbody>>not related to ethics at all. <br> <br>Actually these are mainly theological, and don't have to do really with the content of ethics. In the history of Judaism, Jews only adopted the idea of resurrection at the time of Chanukah, in 165 BCE, because it was obvious that good and pious people were getting martyred rather than getting the earthly rewards promised in the Torah. So they bought the whole heaven-hell end of days & resurrection package. <br> <br>The influence of this is in my opinion decidedly mixed. On one hand it may have helped to push the idea that we should try to make a better world on earth - one variation on the messianic idea. On the other hand, the whole black and white way of thinking leads to fanaticism. It became Manichaeism, which influenced Christianity much more, with the idea of the Devil as an independent actor causing harm, and other ideas. <br> <br>Abraham and especially Moses were already social reformers seeking a more just society, so I tend to think that the Zoroasterian influence (if it is that, as historians don't agree) is largely bad. <br> <br>Next post will be on topic!</div>

<div class=commentbody>It's very telling that this thread has evolved into discussions over religion. I'll bet John could have predicted it would happen. <br> <br>Here's my take: Who we choose to work for and who we'd turn away is ultimately a personal decision. For every person (or studio), it comes down to what they're comfortable with and whether they can look themselves in the mirror at the end of the day (and whether looking at themselves in the mirror is even important to them at all). It seems the real danger lies when we try to enforce our personal standards (whether based on opinion, religion, personal experience, morals or ethics) upon others. <br> <br>And then there's the <a href=http://www.emigre.com/ArticleFTF.php>First Things First manifesto</a> published in Emigre #51. As designers, we hold within our reach the power to shape the way people perceive the world around them, and it's my opinion that we ought to use our talents to try to make the world a better place. (Yes, the definition of 'better place' will vary from person to person.) The FTF manifesto suggests a move away from promoting abject consumerism of inessential products in order to focus our efforts on cultural and social change. I can get behind this, but I also recognize that I need such clientele in order to make a living and feed my family. So I choose carefully who to take on so that at a minimum, we're not aiding an organization that is negatively impacting the world. <br> <br>As a founder and partner in a design firm, it was important to me to align with partners who shared a similar goal, so that we may avoid conflict over selecting design opportunities that present themselves. Has anyone out there been faced with a decision in their studios in which the partners differed over taking on a specific client? What was the outcome? <br> <br>I recognize there are plenty of designers out there who have no qualms about taking on Corporation X or Y, and could care less whether they make the world a better place... Who see no need to distinguish between clientele. It's not my place to decide what's "good" and who's "bad" so I pledge that I won't disrespect you for your choices in the event we differ - all I ask is the same courtesy. There's plenty of work out there to keep us all busy, and as Tiffany said, at least this way we won't be competing. <br> <br>Finally, what's your thought on taking on Pro Bono or non-profit work? Personally, I think it a good thing that design firms take on some work in order to help organizations that never could otherwise afford the expertise. It's also a great way to stay grounded and avoid having every design project be driven by the almighty dollar.</div>

<div class=commentbody>> black and white way of thinking leads to fanaticism. <br> <br>Hmmm. That's so unlike what we're living through now. And of course seeing yourself as the Chosen People promotes great harmony with the rest of the world... It seems you still have a lot to learn from Zoroastrianism. On the other hand there's a big problem with Zoroastrianism, one that would greatly inconvenience Madonna, Whoopi Goldberg and Whitney Houston: you have to born into it from both parents; this endangers its survival immensely. But of course one can't expect perfection: every religion has its quaint little (and sometimes disasterous huge) idiocies. <br> <br>William, if you ever decide to get into graphics for real, I have the perfect name for your studio: <br>Denial by Design <br> <br>hhp</div>

<div class=commentbody>I think the Chosen People comment comes from a sense that the Christian Identity movement is well and alive in America. <br> <br>In this way of thinking, Americans are the new chosen people.

<div class=commentbody>On the issue of the effect of international corporations in poor countries, which a number of posters have expressed concerns about: <br> <br>The demand from poor countries themselves is to open up freer trade. The heavy agriculture subsidies are killers, as they undercut farmers in poor countries. Contrary to his express free trade words, Bush hypocritically re-imposed hugh subsidies to US agriculture, which will break farmers in poor countries. Europe is even worse in its protectionism, cruelly opressing its neighbors by such policies. <br> <br>Similarly, textiles are historically the first item in industrialization, and the first step up for a poor country. There is no excuse for the abominable working conditions that often take place in poor countries, but this is no excuse for the trade barriers that rich countries have put up. <br> <br>The WTO, in other words, is not the enemy of progress toward a more prosperous and just world. It is rather the rich countries imposing trade barriers, and the bandit governments of very many poor countries, who are the main forces keeping them poor. <br> <br>>I only attack you for one reason: being anti-humanity. <br> <br>Hrant, I expressed no animus against any person or people.

One of us is wrong, or both of us, but I think we both want a better world. I understand from your postings that you think that democracy and a market economy are the worst, that communism is next best, and that monarchy is still better. <br> <br>I think the other way around. I think that monarchies have been around since the beginning of recorded history, and have been and are still today proven failures in helping the poor. And I think that the world tremendously improved both in prosperity and humane treatment when democracy and market economies came in. Of course every historical change has its evils, but on balance these developments have been a great blessing to humanity. <br> <br>Most of the world, including it seems those living in non-democratic countries, seem to agree with me in preferring mixed economies (market moderated by welfare safety net) together with democratic checks and balances.

<div class=commentbody>William, what you consistently and conveniently ignore is that most people don't have the will nor the ability to consider macroeconomic issues - they're simply trying to eke out a living. They have the sense not to trust the powers that be to look after them. And they're not qualified to consider matters of state anyway (they're qualified to repair shoes or serve food), and most of them have the sense to know that. It is mostly in the West that the illusion of individual relevance to society is so strikingly enforced. Why? Because a watertight system has been built, and when you give people the illusion of power they're a lot less likely to overturn it. Voting, freedom of speech, mandatory public education of children, television, the whole thing is rigged to produce and maintain servile, oblivious peons. <br> <br>What the oppressed masses of people want in this world is something very basic they don't have: being treated decently. Your system is making things worse for most people, not better. And the few that it makes things better for, it shields from a realization of its inhumanity, lest their sense of decency causes problems. <br> <br>Back off from destroying the world, otherwise you'll get your due in the end, one way or another. You cannot overpower Nature, including the nature of the human spirit. <br> <br>> And who will tell me (please) which of them is/are right? <br> <br>Only one person: you. <br> <br>> appreciating an individual for his/her own worth is superior to judging <br>> the individual based on his/her ethnic or geopolitical background. <br> <br>Indeed. Discriminating against an <i>individual</i> is racism, which is unfair and damaging. But making observations about groups of people (for example that Armenians are more conservative than the French), and even acting on them, is not racism. In fact, it's natural, and the only way forward. Otherwise you're stuck in a relativist world where nobody is responsible for their actions. <br> <br>Cultures create and maintain values, and these can be conducive to the health of humanity as a whole, or not. Fear of pointing out problems in certain cultures (like the American gluttony) is exactly what the system wants you to feel. And just in case you're a brave person, you'll never get your views aired in the mainstream anyway. And you can't even complain about that, because you have no Formal Proof (a requirement for credibility in western culture) of media bias (and even if you did you could never publicize it), and because anyway you have freedom of speech, right?... Anybody can say anything they want, and they feel better, reducing the chances for <i>action</i>. Nevermind that you can only ever say it to a few hundred people at most. When you think about it, dissent is essentially undemocratic. <br> <br>> nature selected them for extinction <br> <br>Nature? Democracy is the most unnatural of systems. <br> <br>All that is old will be new again. But of course the masses will continue the think that the dormant systems are "extinct", that their society is always gradually improving (nevermind that the 20th century was the worst in humankind), that their system is the best there ever was. Why? Because people believe what you tell them, and through the media the system conveys self-aggrandizement, to maintain stability. <br> <br>When you vote in the US, you're part of the problem - it's that simple. The absolute least I can do for humanity is not vote - not to go through the motions of this murderous juggernaut. <br> <br>hhp</div>

<div class=commentbody>"Choosing not to vote is just plain irresponsible. Especially considering the consequences." <br> <br>Eh. There is a reason we have such poor voter turnout in the US. It's not apathy as much as futility. We're really not a democracy anymore (not that we technically ever were). We're really a corporate run society. We're as different as monarchy's as we maybe like to think. Our Monarch tends to be a logo rather than a person, that's all. (Of course, you could also equate the Bush family as a clear Monarchy, but we'll save that for another debate...) <br> <br>Voting certainly can change things...namely at the local level. But voting really doesn't accomplish a whole lot at the national level. Not until we seriously change things.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Dana, I think maybe the core mistaken assumption you're making is that action could possibly hurt somebody (if it's based on erroneous ideas) while inaction at least is safe. I think the latter is untrue. <br> <br>To continue the automotive analogy: <br>Let's say there's somewhere you <i>have</i> to get to, and the only way to get there in time is to drive that car, even though you've only seen it done and have never driven before yourself. If it's a critical situation (as I think it is now), then you get in and you try to figure the thing out. <br> <br>hhp</div>

<div class=commentbody>a late post to this discussion, but trying to claw it back on track... <br> <br>first i totally agree with what jared posted above -- i share a a lot of what he had to say <br> <br>i remember when i was an undergraduate at <a href=http://www.reading.ac.uk/typography>reading</a> and we had a lecture from michael twyman. he asked us 'who wouldn't you work for?'. out of the 25 students in the year, only about 5 of us had thought about this issue already and engaged in a discussion. the rest of the group just sat there -- their concern was getting a job and not what their personal ethics were. this has always stuck with me. <br> <br>at my first job (<a href=http://www.textmatters.com>text matters</a>) i found a place that had ethics rather than just looking for a quick buck. at one point, before i started working there, the staff decided that they didn't want to pitch for a project as they didn't believe that the organisation was just. pro-bono work was common place. <br> <br>now runing my own studio, i try (with my partner) to take on pro-bono work where possible. we have a 'charity' day rate for those organisations that would benefit from our skills but cannot afford our normal rate. we do work for 'big business' on occasions. but not for the likes of mcdonalds, gap, nike etc. we only do it where we can make a difference (and it allows us to still eat and keep a roof over our heads while we help out charities and not-for-profit groups. <br> <br>just my 2p...</div>
