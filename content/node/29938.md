  an A-Z of the most beatiful 'fat' faces out there. I'm not interested in subtly.
  I want letters that really stand out from the crowd as individuals as well as a
  set.  Don't wory about placing abstract faces either, anything goes really lets
  have a bit of fun :)\r\n\r\nI have added a lovely 'L' very decorative, to get the
  lkist going.\r\n\r\nIf someone has posted an 'L' (like me) your not allowed to post
  that letter again. I'm keen to end up with A-Z lets see if we can make it :)\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/L_4999.gif]"
