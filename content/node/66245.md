  text will be a URL (i.e. no need for extended symbols, etc)\r\nIf it is a freeware
  font would be perfect, but a commercial type is fine.\r\n\r\nThank you!"

  body: I`m thinking of Union or Yanone Kaffeesatz. Although I'm worried about Yanone
    being condensed, give it a try. They are both free.
