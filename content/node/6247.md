    But I&#39;m sure there must be a real version out there somewhere. <BR> <BR>Even
    though they&#39;re definitely not the same, the <i>Godfather</i> font shares a
    lot of characteristics with the original &#34;Star Trek&#34; titles, though, don&#39;t
    you think?

  body: A company called Novel Font Corp. had a pretty decent <BR>rendition called
    Rublof. Most of their fonts, though, <BR>were knockoffs. So there must be an original
    that&#39;s close.  <BR>Sadly, I can&#39;t find Novel Fonts on the web.

    close</a> match is Fiorello. Obviously you will have to make some changes.

  body: Fiorello is it. Horizon is the &#34;Star Trek&#34; font I mentioned previously.
    Plus, for what it&#39;s worth, Fiorello has an Italian name, strengthening the
    Mafia connection.
