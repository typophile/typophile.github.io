  body: "Part of the &, reminds me [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/type-together/bree/|Bree]].
    So, by combining the ampersand from Alright Sans (suggested by DPape) and Bree,
    you could get pretty close.\r\n\r\nEdit: having a look to the video on [[http://www.behance.net/gallery/O-Co/1067937|this
    page]] could confirm that it is Bree as the type used on the business cards looks
    like it to me. The ampersand could also come from [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/type-together/adelle/|Adelle]]
    from the same type foundry (Type-Together), just need a little tweaking (mainly
    removing serifs and reworking finals)."
