body: "New to type design. Question:\r\n\r\nI rarely, if at all, use accented characters
  (I'm a typical American). I'm creating a san serif font and noted, on other sans
  serif fonts, accent glyphs such as used for grave and circumflex characters have
  a \"wedge\" shape. Of course, the circumflex is two wedges coming together at the
  apex.\r\n\r\nCan accent glyphs be the same width at the bottom as they are at the
  apex? A grave character, for instance, would look like a hyphen at an angle instead
  of a wedge at an angle.\r\n\r\nI haven't a clue. I want to go with the \"hyphen
  at an angle\" look if that's acceptable in accent glyph shapes.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\n\r\ndglen"

  body: Most often acute and grave accents are tapered at the lower end, but if an
    even stroke looks best with your design, go for it. There is precedent for those
    as well. As far as I can tell, the distinction is a matter of taste.

  body: "If by \u2018hyphen at an angle\u2019 you mean a rotated hyphen, that would
    be quite unusual for a normal sans-serif grave accent. I assume you are referring
    to a shape with horizontal top and bottom lines of the same length (a parallelogram),
    in which case I agree with cuttlefish."

  body: "The only problem I can see is that the shape makes the accents really tall
    and much taller than, e.g., the tildes.\r\n\r\nDoes the font include lowercase
    as well? (Accents are often steeper/taller on lowercase letters and flatter/lower
    on uppercase letters lest they take up too much space and require too much leading.)"

  body: BTW the acute and grave should not be mathematically centred over the glyphs.
