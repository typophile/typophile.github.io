  of a textbook - ideally i'm looking for numbers that are inside circles or squares
  or some other shape, - should go with thesans font, if possible - thanks in advance
  for any thoughts."

  body: "Searching MyFonts for \"circled numbers\" gets you stuff like <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/jonathan-hughes/fyra/\">Fyra.</a>
    But if you don't anticipate your lists being that long, there are more choices.\r\n\u2460
    to \u2473 and \u2776 to \u24F4 are in encoded in Unicode. <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/search/char%3A%E2%91%A8/fonts/\">Here's
    all the fonts on MyFonts that contain the character \u2468.</a> Some of them don't
    go up to \u2469 but you can see there is a lot to choose from."

    u able to find all of the fonts that have numbers in circles? And how do I get
    to see what all the numbers in circles look like in the various fonts? I'm fairly
    new to myfonts, and having trouble seeing them -- thanks for your help."

  body: "Find Fonts, Advanced Search, available characters, contains, ...and paste
    in a character the font needs to have (from whatever source is most handy, like
    the character map application, unicode.org charts, Wikipedia... I'm working on
    a font family that has them, so I copied it out of the Metrics window in Fontlab).\r\n\r\nOne
    way would be to click through to each specific font's page and select the tab
    that says Glyphs, which shows you the whole character set. But to make it much
    easier to compare them all, just copy from this: \u2460\u2461\u2462\u2463\u2464\u2465\u2466\u2467\u2468\u2469\u246A\u246B\u246C\u246D\u246E\u246F\u2470\u2471\u2472\u2473
    and paste it into the sample text field at the top of the list, the place where
    it probably says \"[Pangrams]\"."
