body: I recently acquired a copy of Word Perfect that was being thrown out... and
  got a truckload of Bitstream fonts as a result. While I know a bit about some Bitstream
  fonts (Aldine 721, for example, seems to be a quite well-regarded Plantin revival),
  I was wondering what people think of their Baskervilles (they seem to have two)
  I can't find uch about them online, but I figure that if anyone knows anything,
  they're likely to be here...

  body: 'One of the Bitstream cuts is supposed to be very closely based on a Linotype
    version of Baskerville which was a favourite with book designers mid-20th century.
    What its precise name is, or how good it really is, I don''t know, but there is
    a certain amount of refined buzz surrounding it. '

  body: "I can't shut all the windows down now to take a serious look, and of course,
    I don't know just which Bitstream Baskerville you have. . . . \r\n\r\nBut remember
    that Bitstream was started by Mike Parker (formerly of Linotype) and Matthew Carter
    (formerly of Linotype), and that Carter was heavily involved in the making of
    Linotype's New Baskerville. I'd bet new donuts to old dollars that at least one
    of the Bitstream Baskervilles is a slight improvement on *New Baskerville* --
    except that Bitstream, at least in the early days, didn't have old-style figures
    & small caps. You use to be able to buy the Linotype sets of just os figs & small
    caps quite cheaply; dunno if that is still true. New Baskerville is basically
    a text font, & text really deserves old style (aka text) figures.\r\n\r\nFWIW "

  body: "Charles, I think I can remember Matthew Carter telling me that New Baskerville
    was not his project and he couldn't imagine who first attributed it to him. As
    I remember it, he said that NB was basically a 'Linotype Design Studio' affair.
    The Bitstream cut of Baskerville I am thinking of was supposed to replicate a
    particular Lino metal cut. Also, it's a mistake to assume that Bitstream didn't
    have OSF, SC, and other glyphs. I have made the same error. What they sold does
    not reflect the wealth of data that was actually designed, redesigned, and digitized.
    \r\n\r\nThere has been a desire at Bitstream to get some of this rich data out
    there, but it appears to be somewhat stymied, perhaps because of lack of standardization.
    That reflects the dreadful productization problem you face the minute you move
    away from a limited T1 font. "

    How great would it be to get an Opentype version of Type Odyssey with all the
    goodies that got left out of those gorgeous fonts? "

  body: "Bill, somewhere in my emails I have a message from Matthew saying he wasn't
    involved with the Baskerville Greek fonts often attributed to him, but he didn't
    mention & I wasn't aware he had little involvement in the New Baskerville project
    itself. \r\n\r\nWouldn't surprise me too much though, a lot of the work on fonts
    was done by various people in the drawing rooms at Linotype & Monotype, and of
    course by committees. A project like NB which is in some sense a *revival* would
    probably be attributed to a particular person only if they took an strong interest
    in shepherding it through, as happened with Monticello.\r\n\r\nAnd yes, it would
    be nice to have the supplemental characters for the older Bitstream fonts."

  body: "In 2004, Larry Oppenberg wrote the following to the ATypI mailing list:\r\n\r\n\"New
    Baskerville was developed by John Quaranta with assistance from staff designers
    in the Manhattan drawing office of Mergenthaler Linotype. I can say so for sure
    since I worked there at the time. The \"New\" was primarily the development of
    Semi Bold and Black weights with italics to complement the pre existing Regular
    and Bold weights with italics which were also tweaked somewhat. Matthew Carter
    had no involvement with the project and if you ask him he will tell you so. The
    designs were later licensed to ITC. The original New Baskerville master drawings
    reside at the Museum of Printing in North Andover Massachusetts, complete with
    title block signatures of John Quaranta. If you come visit you can see them first
    hand. BTW, the same people/same process applies to New Caledonia.\"\r\n\r\nTo
    which Matthew Carter responded:\r\n\r\n\"Larry is right. I'm not sure how the
    confusion came about, unless perhaps because I was working on Baskerville Greek
    (with Tim Holloway) for Linotype at about the same time. In the interests of accuracy
    I have asked Linotype to remove my name from the design credit for New Baskerville
    on their website.\""

  body: "I have found this information from my copy of an internal document describing
    Bitstream's library. The author is probably Mike Parker.\r\n\r\nBitstream Baskerville:
    'The present design is an accurate recutting, with particular attention to George
    W. Jones's revision from the metal of Baskerville's English (14 pt) roman and
    italic in 1929 . . . .'\r\n\r\nBitstream Transitional 404, Baskerville No. 2:
    'This redesign is made from proofs, rather than the metal, and so is heavier,
    with particular attention to the Harris and the Monotype revision, which was made
    from proofs of Baskerville's Great Primer (16 pt)'\r\n\r\nfor what it's worth!
    No. 2 doesn't look that heavy to me - - certainly nothing like the fabulous Monotype
    metal family!"
