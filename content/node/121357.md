body: "Hi, I'm designing a cook book and it needs to have a \"home made\" feel so
  using a handwritten font for tips and explanations ... I have used Quickpen (https://www.myfonts.com/fonts/trial-by-cupcakes/quickpen/)
  which I love but the client has decided they want something that they think is more
  readable. Just wondering if anyone has any suggestions? I like the shape and flow
  of quickpen - would love something with a similar feel and welcome any feedback
  from here.\r\nThanks!"

    sure it could be considered much more readable.\r\nMaybe something from Blue Vinyl

    the look of the book. I agree it might not be as readable as the client wants
    but I'll give it a go! Will also check out the Blue Vinyl fonts.\r\nThanks again."

  body: Thanks for buying Rollerscript Cally. I'd say it's just as readable as Quickpen,
    just different. I'd like to see it in use if the client goes for it.
