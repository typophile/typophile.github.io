  the combining diacriticals have not been done. At a later date, the combining diacriticals
  are made up. If the eacute (U+00E9) is now turned into components per above, the
  U+00E9 character somehow remembers that the \"right\" component for the acute as
  U+00B4 rather than U+0301 (the latter being the combining diacritic).\r\n\r\nAnyway
  on FontLab to get the correct accent components in these characters, aside from
  making them again, by hand?"
