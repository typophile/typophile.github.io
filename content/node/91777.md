body: "Hello all,\r\n\r\nI'm launching a blog called Typositor. As if the world needs
  another design or type blog. But I plan to focus on pre-digital Graphic Arts technology
  and workers on a regular basis, so I'm hoping it will be a slightly different voice.
  If you remember, and especially if you used the VGC Typositor in its heyday, I'm
  wondering if you might comment on any technical aspects of this maiden article.
  A few xxx's are in place as I need to fill some research holes, but I'd love anyone's
  two cents on any aspect of this post.  It's a bit long and has a personal angle
  to it, but I wanted to establish a voice for this first posting and introduce the
  blog's name in the process.\r\n\r\nI'm also looking for images of the machine, which
  are very rare on the web. If anyone has leads in that department please let me know.\r\nMany
  thanks in advance. \r\n\r\nPatrick King\r\n\r\nTitle TBD. The Typositor. Learning
  my kerning. Learning to Kern. Typositor. A new blog. An old tool. \r\n\r\n\r\nIn
  the bitter Wisconsin winter of 1977, having dropped out of my second art school
  in two years, I found myself working in a mail house, hauling boxes and counting
  travel brochures, the only male in a team of middle aged women. When I couldn\u2019t
  bear another day peppered with conversations revolving around that week\u2019s sales
  at K-mart as they sorted glossy tri-folds for exotic destinations they would probably
  never see, I assembled a portfolio of design projects consisting mainly of assignments
  from the single year of design I\u2019d studied at Minneapolis College of Art and
  Design and a handful of illustrations and ads I\u2019d created for local businesses
  through my teens. Having checked out my first Graphis Annual from our local library
  at the age of ten, coupled with a father who worked on the production side of the
  newspaper business, I was quite familiar with the industry and dabbled in my share
  of design for hire in between my quest to be Andrew Wyeth. \r\n\r\nRacine, Wisconsin
  at that time was an industrial Mecca, a hardscrabble, Union town just 60 miles North
  of Chicago and 20 miles South of Milwaukee. Case tractors, Massey Ferguson, Jacobsen
  Mowers, S.C. Johnson and Son, Walker mufflers, InSinkErator, Twin Disc and the soon
  to close Western Publishing, at the time the largest printer in the world. Their
  Golden Book division alone supported illustrators for miles around. Design firms
  and ad agencies abounded. Work was plentiful for industrious practitioners, the
  older of whom referred to themselves as Commercial Artists while the younger specimens
  preferred to be called Graphic Designers. \r\n\r\nI presented myself to and received
  a bit of encouragement from some local firms, but they usually suggested I go back
  to school and raised their eyebrows when I told them that I didn\u2019t really want
  to be a designer forever. I\u2019d dropped out of Minneapolis College of Art and
  Design to study painting at Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts and had sworn
  off spending my life in their field. If I told a designer, then, as now, that I\u2019d
  really rather spend my days painting, it was often met with a dismissive grunt of
  \u201CI\u2019m sorry our profession isn\u2019t good enough for you. So go paint,
  why don\u2019t you?\u201D\r\n\r\nThe only potential employer who found my ad hoc
  portfolio promising was the owner of a small type house and service bureau called
  Wisconsin Graphic Arts. They occupied a nondescript cement block building just off
  the tracks in a neighborhood of warehouses that had seen better days.  A curmudgeonly
  character ran the joint. He was not a veteran of the industry, but had somehow purchased
  it as a business venture. Or won it in a poker game. A decision he seemed to regret
  daily. The staff prior to me consisted of his ex daughter in law and another woman
  who\u2019d learned enough about type to set passable galleys on one of two Compugraphics.\r\n\r\nThe
  back room reeked of darkroom chemicals and was dominated by a photostat camera,
  a guaranteed profit center for anyone fortunate enough to have one in those days.
  And in the corner, behind a black curtain in its own closet sized enclave sat the
  Typositor. A gold mine, if you had clients willing to spend over a dollar a word
  for premium display typesetting. In my first week on the job I had a five minute
  tutorial on the machine, was given a headline to set, mustered up everything I learned
  in the single letterspacing exercise I produced in Graphic Design 101 and from that
  day on the Typositor was my domain. \r\n\r\nThe Typositor, manufactured by Visual
  Graphics Corporation between 19xx and 19xx, was a simple analogue solution to fine
  tuned typesetting. While it entered the Graphic Arts landscape at the same time
  as the xxxxxx, xxxxxx and other photo based typesetting methods which were quickly
  replacing centuries of setting via lead, it could have existed as early as photography
  itself, its technology was so basic. \r\n\r\nThe first phototypesetting machines
  such as xxxxxxxxx had a limited number of kerning pairs and while overall tracking
  was available as a setting, individually kerning characters was nearly impossible.
  At settings above 18 point, display type wasn\u2019t going to be pretty. Yet many
  settled for the clunky headlines, not wanting to incur the Cadillac expense of type
  set on the Typositor.\r\n\r\nTypositors were, in essence, photo enlargers. The size
  of your type was determined by the distance of the lens from the photo sensitive
  paper underneath. The paper came in rolls, about 4\u201D in depth. Each font was
  stored on a roll of negative film, about 3\u201D in height. Crisp, exquisite characters
  imbedded in silver. Bearing a slight resemblance to a film editing machine, you
  loaded your font onto two spools and threading it in the middle above the lens.
  To find your chosen letter or symbol you grasped a spool on either side and rolled
  your way to it. And rolled and rolled and rolled. As with audio or video tape, finding
  what you needed quickly simply wasn\u2019t going to happen, and the advent of non-linear
  digital editing one wondered how we tolerated the endless searching.\r\n\r\nOnce
  you found your character, you slowly rolled back and forth to position it square
  under the light source, which would faintly project your letter onto the photo paper
  in the tray.  After checking your focus a push of a button exposed the paper to
  the character, and in a split second a beautiful, crisp, black letter was born.
  You then rolled on to the next letter, slowly positioning it in place, then fine
  tuned your kerning by laterally adjusting the photo paper ever so gently. Expose
  again. And so it went until you had a strip of paper containing the logo or headlines
  for which the client was willing to pay a hefty premium. Efficient it was not. Yet
  the world had never seen an instrument of typesetting capable of such absolute control
  of letter spacing. What you wanted you got. Tight, not touching, or even tight,
  sometimes touching became a favorite mark-up note of art directors and designers.
  In the hands of a skilled typesetter, the Typositor was an instrument to be played,
  spewing headlines that had only been the dream of those encumbered in lead or wood
  for all those years. \r\n\r\nEven the most lackluster designers in that era demanded
  fine typesetting, and got it, if they could afford to employ the Typositor or one
  of its competitors, the xxxx or the xxxx. As with Kleenex, the VGC moniker became
  that of the process itself, regardless of its origin. A good type salesman knew
  his customers\u2019 taste in letter spacing and the larger a type house\u2019s library
  the more they could charge. In the 1980s I had bookshelves heavy with type catalogs
  from around the country. Many of which I paid as much as $150 for. I recall searching
  high and low for a particular cut of Simoncini Garamond that I\u2019d seen in a
  headline, finally tracking it down at Western Type in Kansas City. A phone call
  was placed with a newsman\u2019s urgency, dictating the headline and crossing my
  fingers on the kerning instructions. Not unlike ordering a steak, one type house\u2019s
  tight - not touching was another\u2019s practically kissing. I waited 2 or 3 days
  for that headline. Instant gratification was rarely an option. Good planning was
  essential.\r\n\r\nAbsent a budget for Typositor set type, your next best alternative
  was Letraset or its poor cousin Chartpak. But their limitations of typeface choices
  and sizes, the need to spend additional money on photostats and the last minute
  trips to the art supply store because you\u2019ve just burnished the last \u201Ce\u201D
  from a sheet whose texture is beginning to resemble surface of the moon left you
  cursing the client who wouldn\u2019t pony up for Typositor set type. \r\n\r\nBut
  in a time where setting a simple business card could cost $100, a full identity
  project easily $1,000, cutting corners on type expenditures became an art form unto
  itself. Designers became surgeons with razor blades, endlessly measuring, capable
  of re-leading eight point type and otherwise turned pieces of illustration board
  into carefully calculated collages, often fine tuning their design in the process.
  A single letter correction could add at least $50 to the type costs, which often
  could not be billed back to the client. If, on the other hand your client was especially
  edit happy and you were using an expensive type house, you hit the jackpot. Your
  profit increased exponentially, thanks to the industry standard of marking type
  up by 20%. Some firms derived as much as a third of their revenue from type markups.
  $30,000 type bills for annual reports were not unheard of. Until the day the Macintosh
  arrived, and dumped the responsibility (disguised as freedom) of setting type in
  the lap of designers, most of whom labored fruitlessly to produce anything resembling
  the beauty of what a skilled type house crew could deliver. Overnight, type as a
  source of revenue for designers disappeared. How could we charge for something that
  we could now magically spew from our new Macs, seemingly for free?\r\n\r\nBetween
  1984 and 199x Apple, along with Adobe would ensure a quick death of the relatively
  short era of all forms of photo typesetting. Equipment manufacturers were left only
  as holders of intellectual property in the form of the typefaces for which they
  owned copyrights. They found a way to join the digital revolution or they found
  themselves out of business in very short order. Owners of type houses, from Mom
  and Pop operations in basements to mega shops employing hundreds of skilled, union
  typesetters hung on for awhile, a few morphing into service bureaus, small print
  shops, or the still nebulous world called Desktop Publishing. But most simply shut
  down. Production of X-Acto blades, rubber cement (and thinner), illustration board
  and transfer type plummeted. The untold thousands of jobs lost in a myriad of industries
  whose sole purpose was to help us take the words of our clients and do whatever
  was needed to turn them into ink on paper is one of the great un-reported business
  stories of the last century. \r\n\r\n34 years after the parting of that curtain
  to reveal the Typositor upon which I would hone my kerning skills I purchased a
  domain in its name to house this blog in homage to it and to all pre-digital graphics
  technology, which I plan to highlight often as an editorial focus of this new blog.
  I welcome stories and contributions from anyone who lived through the rubber cement
  wars. Happy reading, all.\r\n"

    the paper was a roll, 2\" in height, moving through a fixed channel. On other
    machines that used the 2\" film fonts, larger sheet stock rather than rolls could
    be used.\r\n\r\nI still recall the day when my boss tossed our last Typositor,
    along with all the fonts, in a dumpster because that era was clearly over.\r\n"

  body: Thanks so much majus. I did come across the 2" correction. I'm hoping to go
    down to House Industries to take a look at their collection of the original Phototype
    collection they inherited.
