  a contraction for some form of \"is not\" so an apostrophe makes sense."

  body: "Ain't is spelled that way by Oxford Concise Dictionary. \r\n\r\nFowler defends
    \"ain't\" or \"an't\" as an abbreviation for \"am not I\", as in \"ain't I pretty?\"
    We tend to say \"aren't I pretty\", which is even less defensible. "

  body: "I think what Fowler was probably getting at in William's comment above, is
    that <em>ain't</em> completes a very productive syntactic paradigm in English
    (contractions of pronominal + be + negation):\r\n\r\nYou are not; You're not;
    You aren't\r\nHe is not; She's not; It isn't\r\nWe are not; We're not; We aren't\r\nThey
    are not; They're not; They aren't\r\nI am not; I'm not; *I amn't / ?I ain't\r\n\r\nNot
    that most folks use <em>ain't</em> in precisely that manner--but that's what Fowler
    was suggesting over the ridiculously ungrammatical <em>aren't I</em>.\r\n\r\n<cite>and
    everyone agrees on the meaning\u2026 </cite>\r\n\r\nI think that may actually
    depend on where you hail from. In the southeastern U.S. (where I grew up) people
    use <em>ain't</em> to mean both <em>isn't/amn't</em> as well as <em>hasn't/haven't</em>.
    If you listen closely, some educated Southerners (they do exist!) still differentiate
    the two by aspirating the second: <em>hain't</em>.\r\n\r\nI hain't had enough
    sleep, so I'm going to bed y'all."

  body: "The prescriptivists of the 19th century forced \"ain't\" out of standard
    speech. My guess is that the relatively obscure relationship between \"am not\"
    and the contraction bothered some people (the form had formerly been \"an't\").
    Then probably in reaction to this, people began to use \"ain't\" in other meanings&mdash;\"isn't\",
    \"hasn't\", etc.\r\n\r\nMore on this: [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ain't]]\r\n\r\nNow
    the stigma attached to the word is so great, and its use so variable in meaning
    in different groups, that it's hard to see this come back in its original, logical
    meaning. The prescriptivists ruined a perfectly good word, innit?\r\n\r\n\r\n"
