  body: I am still having no luck pinning this down, but I found a freeware font that
    has some similarities called <a href="http://www.dafont.com/en/font.php?file=napapiiri"
    target="_blank">Napapiiri</a> by CybaPee, a friend of mine.

  body: I peeked into the source for the page and the sIFR Flash file is called &#34;digitalis.swf&#34;.
    Sure enough, <a href="http://www.identifont.com/show?4XY" target="_blank">Digitalis</a>
    is what it is.

  body: Veer is where I saw it before. Thanks for putting me out of my misery on this
    one.  It really was driving me nuts. That&#39;s going in both the Script Guide
    and the Sans Guide.
