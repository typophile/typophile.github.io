  I did launches Penabico\r\n\r\nhttp://new.myfonts.com/fonts/intellecta/penabico/\r\n\r\nwith
  many features. So, is the \"aalt\" feature important to add to this font? Why? And,
  in affirmative case, I need list all other features in the \"aalt\" programing?\r\n\r\nfeature
  aalt{\r\n  feature ornm;\r\n  feature swsh;\r\n  HOW OTHERS ????????????????????????????????\r\n}

    all-alternates functionality of the Glyphs palette in InDesign and Illustrator.
    That means, whenever the user clicks and holds on one of the characters in the
    palette, which alternate glyphs should he or she see in the pop-up. Often, this
    will be all the GSUB features of your font, but sometimes you may omit some of
    the features, especially things like \"ccmp\" if they're only used to decompose
    your glyphs before additional processing. Sometimes \"calt\" would also be omitted,
    depending on the design. Perhaps \"liga\" and \"dlig\" should be omitted as well.
    \r\n\r\nIn short: include all your one-to-one glyph replacement features there.
    As far as the other features are considered, make a decision. "
