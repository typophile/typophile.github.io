  to anyone (i know, the sample is ridiculously small, couldn't find bigger...)? http://luxux.com/spank.jpg\r\n\r\nthanks.\r\n\r\n"

    remember ever encountering this one during those searches. Maybe this logo was
    custom designed for the artist. Sorry I can't be more helpful.\r\n\r\nIf anybody
    ever come across it we'll definitely let you know."
