  body: Nope sorry but it was very small type, I enlarged it the best I could to make
    it easier to see. If it will help I can repost it in the original size. Please
    let me know if that will help.

    that Letter Gothic is the font but you are right it appears to be close. This
    font also does look like it is from a typewriter and it is from an old card that
    that I am trying to make a template for on my computer.\r\n\r\nhttp://img282.imageshack.us/img282/25/font8ji.jpg"

  body: That burokrat font seems extremley close for the letters I think I will be
    using that one but the numbers dont match up very well. Do you guys have any idea
    about a differnet font perhaps for the numbers? Thanks
