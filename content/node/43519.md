  body: "What seems off is the size of the word \"FAST\" compared to the compass.
    Unfortunately, there is nothing to bring the logo together. The word \"FAST\"
    It far too prominent and dominates the logo.  The colour pallet they have suggested
    is actually a good one. Keep the current red and go with a darker blue. No pun
    intended here but use a navy blue for the compass. Revers the compass using the
    Navy blue and white. The background in the centre of the logo, where you have
    the yellow (colour #3), use the Navy blue. Where you have the light blue, use
    white and where you have your mid tone blue use a screen of Navy blue at 50% or
    60%. Remove the tile-esk edges on the circle and maybe work with placing the North
    (N), South (S), North East (NE) etc. out side that circle and relative to the
    compass. For the \"FAST\" text I would break it up so it looks like F.A.S.T. (sumilar
    to other military identities). Revers locations of  the Fast text and place it
    behind the compass so the compass becomes front and centre and diminishes the
    power of the FAST text.\r\nThis logo actually uses 4 colours to reproduce - Black,
    Blue, Rad, Yellow.\r\n\r\n\r\nOver all You have a really good design here. It
    has a lot of potential. Good luck!\r\n\r\nPatrick Davis Provisional R.G.D.\r\nOwner

  body: I wonder if what <em>might</em> be seen as a clash is the color variation.
    I mean in the word FAST the shift from highlight to shadow is much less dramatic
    than it is in the star. It is almost as if the lighting is different for both.

    \r\n\r\nThis might be true. I've already shown versions of just the logotype with
    these reds, so, I should probably try and match the value better in the blues."

  body: Although the black strokes widths should be uniform, no? The strokes on the
    star are too heavy. Again this gives the appearance of the star being in front

  body: "Could you integrate the compass into the 'A'? Instead of it being in the
    middle of the word, maybe integrate it into the negative space of the A instead?
    That would allow the compass to a) be smaller and b) align with the slant of the
    type. Just a thought.\r\n\r\nI think spacing it more with the periods doesn't
    help. It now reads less as 'FAST' and more as F A...S T...which doesn't feel 'as
    fast'.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: Government logos have been looking increasingly toy-like for a while. I prefer
    a classic look for them. Oddly though I think the new look is more classic - probably
    because it is simpler and more robust. To make it even more classic I might try
    dropping the shading on the letters, and  loosing the italic for both the star
    & the letters.

  body: "Hey Asvetic, without reading all the posts above me, here are my comments
    on the original logo: from first glance I thought it was for a company called
    fast, and I didn't understand the compass symbol at all, or the choice of colors.
    After reading your description I understood a little better what you were trying
    for, but I don't think you've hit the mark.\r\n\r\nColor:\r\nThere are eight colors
    in the first draft. Get that down to three. Red and blue is a perfect color palette
    for the navy, but make sure you choose the right red and the right blue. I'd choose
    colors that remind people of the American flag... a dark navy blue throughout
    with a crimson red as a highlight. Use navy instead of black.\r\n\r\nShape:\r\nI
    like the compass idea, but I'm think the actual shape needs to be less complex.
    Is the circle behind it necessary? At least the lines can definitely go. The shape
    needs to be bigger than the text.\r\n\r\nText:\r\nYou were right to use a serif
    font, but I don't like the size, the weight, or the angle of the text. Keep the
    text small (it doesn't mean much, just an abbreviation), decrease the weight,
    and drop the italics. Also, and this is key, either greatly increase the letter
    spacing or add punctuation to denote it as an abbreviation. Maybe do both. Alternatively
    I suppose you could include the entire name, Fleet Assistance and Shipboard Training.\r\n\r\nSimplify,
    clarify and refine the focus. Overall I think you're moving it in the correct
    direction."

  body: Yes that's closer. The star could retain the more simple shape as well. The
    elements are still fighting in this version. I suspect that the best way for me
    explain is to sketch it & scan it. I will see if I can do that this evening.

  body: "I am a friend of reduction when it comes to logotypes, among other things
    because a smaller number of elements will give the logo a higher stability, especially
    in small sizes. So I've made a few sketches to show what I'd do:\r\n\r\nWhen I
    start on a logo, I usually work out the shape in black and white only. When I
    am satisfied with the built, changing colors is done in a matter of minutes.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/fast_redux01_6709.jpg]\r\n\r\nI
    thought it might be a good idea to simplify the star a little, so as to make it
    easier to harmonize it with the type. Then I tried to integrate the star into
    the letters. Sadly, doesn't work for me. The S clashes horribly with the star
    and because it is so heavy what little there was of white space inside is now
    covered by the star.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/fast_redux02_6468.jpg]\r\n\r\nNext
    try: letters underneath the star. Still keeping the symmetry of the whole thing,
    the downward motion of the letters towards the center of the star is not so great.
    Weights of the image vs the textharmonize better already, though. On another thought,
    I would leave the embossing idea in favor of using\u2013not sure whether that
    is the right term for it\u2013 inlined or engraved font. I tried to get the effect
    in the sketch, but I'm not sure whether it comes across. Something like this one:
    http://www.itcfonts.com/fonts/detail.htm?pid=203725\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/fast_redux03_5471.jpg]\r\n\r\nFinally,
    I placed the letters above the star. I like the upward motion towards the middle,
    the weight also seems to be more equally distributed. This version also offers
    the possibility of adding the companies whole name to the logo, which is something
    almost all of my customers have insisted upon.\r\n\r\nHope this helps. "
