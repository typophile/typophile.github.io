body: "[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Grateful-Logo-HouseSpeak1_5233.png]\r\n\r\nI'm
  a web developer. One of my clients' designers lost the font used in this image due
  to computer issues. I'm attempting to re-discover what the font is specifically
  so that I can get licensing and use it in our web project. It's clearly some sort
  of Geometric font, similar to Futura, but there are some distinct differences (for
  example the unusual \"G\", and diagonal bar in lowercase \"e\").\r\n\r\nI have used
  the following online services so far:\r\nmyfont.com\r\nidentifont.com\r\nfonts.com\r\nwhatfontis.com\r\n\r\nNot
  that it's comprehensive; I may have missed something. I love fonts and typography,
  but this isn't exactly my area of expertise.\r\n\r\nThanks for your help!"
