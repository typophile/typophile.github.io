  body: For what it&#39;s worth, I don&#39;t think that is &#40;or was ever&#41; a
    font. I think it was a custom-drawn logo. You may be able to approximate it with
    an off-the-shelf font, but slanting anything that much is bound to introduce a
    lot of unsightly distortion.

  body: Stian, could you put a range &#40;date&#41; of when it was used? This could
    confirm what Mark has written.

    this logo, I&#39;d say, or at least be good enough to make you stare at them side
    by side to tell them apart. '

  body: I can try to play with a manipulation of a scan, but I only have Paris Flash
    on my computer.  Maybe I&#39;ll try to play with that to make a solid version
    of those letters. DO you just want to see a scan of those two fonts?

  body: Based on the date of the logo use I&#39;d agree with Mark, I bet its hand
    drawn. Having said that Mike is doing a bang-up job of giving you a way to come
    close to that look. I think its just good policy to try to get a time frame from
    the samples posted.

  body: I don&#39;t think this is a logo, because I&#39;ve seen others who have used
    it, as; Scanair, Tromsbuss &#40;a local bus company&#41;, and I&#39;ve also seen
    a guy who I&#39;m sure had a font, because he had almost all the letters and numbers
    which he had used with some screenshots from a flight simulator. <BR> <BR>Stian

  body: It is likely that SAS Scandinavian Airlines also owns Tromsbuss and Scanair,
    it&#39;s a common practice for large airlines. They also own the Radisson SAS
    hotels.

  body: If my Norwegian isn&#39;t failing me, according to the Tromsbuss site, Tromsbuss
    and SAS are contemporaries &#40;Tromsbuss having started activities in 1946&#41;.
    Maybe &#40;wild guess&#41; they had their logo done in a fashion to emulate the
    SAS look and imply an association between both companies?
