body: "Hello!  This is my first post to the forum and I am sorry if I am placing it
  in the wrong category, but this appeared to be the most appropriate.  \r\n\r\nI
  have a compilation of images (all were originally watercolor/gouache paintings that
  have been digitally scanned for printing) that need to be labeled by name (images
  are mostly Baroque/Spanish colonial buildings), but some are of people/nature specifically.
  \ The font will be incorporated into the image.\r\n\r\nAs I am not a designer, I
  simply pulled fonts from my list in Word and those which I was drawn to in film/advertising.
  \ My initial leanings brought me to Helvetica Neue Ultralight and Neutraface. {Big
  suprise, I know.}  I also like script fonts such as Davison Spencerian - it's not
  perfect, am seeking something looser.  I do like the contrast of a minimalist font
  against the highly detailed paintings, but I thought that I would also like to pair
  it with something that is complementary to the ornate style of the architecture
  (as I will often need two lines of text: i.e. Building Name/Location City, Country).
  \ \r\n\r\nI had thought that I would go with Helvetica Neue Ultralight or Neutraface,
  but after reading some opinions on both, it seems that both are \"over\" and \"a
  bit obvious.\"  What are your alternative suggestions?  Thank you. \r\n\r\nP.S.
  If you need more information, I am seeking a font that will convey modernity.  The
  images are going to be used on stationery items and I want something that is modern
  and chic. "

  body: "I also agree about having a minimalistic font against the highly detailed
    paintings. I also understand how you feel about the Helvetica family. Instead
    of Helvetica I recommend Avenir. Personally I looove that typeface and I think
    you would too. It is a sans serif and is minimalistic but has a little style to
    it compared to the neutral Helvetica.\r\n\r\nAvenir: http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/avenir/"

  body: I agree that Helvetica can look dated. If you're stuck using it, I think using
    it condensed and in lighter weights can help.

  body: "I would forget about modernity, whatever that means, and concentrate on type
    that looks good (to you) next to the paintings.\r\n\r\nIf you work with a sans
    serif that has a lot of weights, that can help in the design process as you experiment
    with different settings.\r\n\r\nFor stationery, it\u2019s important to take into
    account the \uFB01gures (numbers) in a typeface."
