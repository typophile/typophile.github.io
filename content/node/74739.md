  picture attached. My question is: Since it's made up of two separate 'mini-glyphs',
  should it be kerned as two glyphs or one? That is, should the spaces either side
  equal the space in between the two sections, or be larger (so that the glyph appears
  more as a unfied whole)?"

  body: "The latter. The spacing on either side of \u044B should be the same as the
    normative space on other letters with straight sides: \u0438 \u043C \u043D \u043F
    \u0448\r\n\r\nThe distance between the two parts of \u044B needs to be balanced
    carefully against the stem weight and the basic spacing between upright characters.
    I usually start by making the distance the same as the weight of the stem of the
    right part, and then increasing it gradually until it looks right in context."

  body: "\u042B represents a single vowel (and sounds like y in \"myth\"). Have it
    in mind during adjusting the inner distance. Check samples like \u0432\u044B\u0433\u0440\u0430\u0432\u0438\u0440\u043E\u0432\u0430\u043D\u044B,
    where you have two \u044B.\r\n"
