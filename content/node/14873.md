  to write a paper on the typeface FUTURA for my Advanced Type class. I am curious
  do any of you have any available info on the typeface? I am open to almost anything,
  as long as it is relevant to:\r\n\r\n   The typeface, its designer (Paul Renner)
  or its use.\r\n\r\n     Please share you opinions as well, of the type face or designer,
  etc.\r\n\r\n   ~Russ"

  body: 'I was in a similar circumstance during my final year of art school. I did
    a comprehensive review of the origins of the sans-serif, as well as some fairly
    detailed analysis of the relationship of modernism to type design. I worked for
    several weeks on a paper of nearly 50 pages in length. I had discussed the paper
    thouroughly beforehand with my instructor so I felt fairly sure about what grade
    to expect. However, when the paper came back, I had received a grade of D+. Why?
    At the time, I didn''t actually have Futura on my system and had set the paper
    in Avenir. When I asked the instructor about it, he went off on an insane tirade
    about how the most sucessful type designers were the best rip-off artists. I pointed
    out that Robert Slimbach had done a pretty swell job of ripping off Frutiger,
    but that just seemed to make him angrier.  I never graduated from that school,
    but years later I did receive an associates degree from a local junior college.
    Let this be a warning to you. '

  body: "As far as I know the history of sans and geometrics is not very well documented.
    (Anyway, not as much as compared to serif, where every fart Claude Garamond passed
    has been discussed by learned scholars, haha.)\r\n\r\nBack on topic: Renners Futura
    was a spec, commisioned by the Bauersche' Schriftgie\xDFerij(please bear with
    any typo's and smallish mistakes \u2014 I'm not in the 'hood of my library) as
    they perceived a growing demand for constructivist typefaces (yes, marketeers
    ruled even then!). Paul Renner bypassed the use of compasses and rulers, but was
    pretty good at manually doing circles etcetera. He drew a remarkable set of characters.\r\n\r\nToo
    remarkable to be marketable, so his client asked for some alternate designs that
    were more in line of current taste. And belo: Futura was born. It proved to be
    so succesfull, that all the other Schriftgie\xDFereien of the time (that's German
    for Typepublishing in lead) wanted teir own versions. Ergo typefaces like Metro,
    Nobel and so on.\r\n\r\nFast forward to the late 90's and you'll notice digital
    versions that incorporate the original glyphs Renner designed but were considered
    to fiendish, eg a wonderful g.\r\nThat's The Foundry's Archetype Renner, to you
    and me.\r\n\r\n(I have a late fifies speciman of Futura somewhere, stille printed
    in letterpress. Fonts go through the same fashion trends as clothing. Futura was
    th\xE9 font before Adolf took over. Doyle Dane Bernbach US Volkswagen campaign
    in the sixties made Futura once again fashionable. My prediction: it's gonna be
    the 'it' font for 2006.)\r\n\r\nAnd Carl: I used to (re)sell my papers to fellow
    students (not in my class, of course!) and they ALWAYS got higher grades than
    I did. Go figure."

    and knowledge! I am editing my paper now and all of you have helped in one way
    or another. The assignment has changed somewhat, my instructor Matt Normand has
    told the class to edit the papers and use the text to create a Type Sample book
    for (FUTURA) our assigned font. \r\n\r\n   Do any of you know where I could find
    reference, ie.. examples of Type Sample books?\r\n\r\n    Thanks again!\r\n\r\n~

  body: My belated advice is to look at the difference between letterpressed Futura
    and any generic digital version. I try not to use Futura in a digital context,
    but I like to use it in small point sizes on letterpress stuff.
