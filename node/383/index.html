		<div class="commentbody">Make up your mind about the typefaces! Just Matrix Script and Base are enough, I think. The front of the card is quite minimal compared to the back, and yes, I do think the back is a bit too much. Remember the orange is going to become quite muddy when printed over the brown stock. Do you really think people are going to use it as a postcard?</div>

I agree with Keith, the front is  <BR>minimal, and I think it works. try to carry your delicate  <BR>minimalism to the back. <BR> <BR>I'm confused as to why you felt the need to introduce  <BR>Base 9 when you already have Akzidenz Grotesk (my  <BR>first-glance guess) to contrast Matrix Script. again, I  <BR>agree with Keith; dump Base 9 and play that post-mod  <BR>italic off of your nice 19th cent grotesk! <BR> <BR>one more thing, if this is a standard size business card  <BR>(which it appears to approximate) then I don't think it's  <BR>viable as a postcard by USPS regs. <BR> <BR>oh yeah, last thing, where did that second italic come  <BR>from? dump that one too and use the grotesk in its  <BR>place.</div>
