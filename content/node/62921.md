    money and experience to hire good designers\r\n3. there are actual brush strokes

  body: "I agree with the conclusions, but have you noticed how this style of lettering
    is currently popular? I'm also thinking of the promos for the movie \"WHERE THE
    WILD THINGS ARE\", as well as other advertising work. Stewf has probably built
    a list of random-looking casual printed fonts. (My list would include Randumhouse,
    Orion, Rats (w/alternate), Outhouse (w/alts), New Gothic Light, Mother Goose,
    Manosk First & Second, Tree Persimmon, Coffeedance, Avril, Arvigo, Swimsuit Boys,
    Cilantro,  and Spaghetti Western) \r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: "Stanyan is nice.\r\n\r\nI think the popularity of this style and the sign
    painter style is that young people, in particular, respond well to authentic,
    one-of-a-kind, hand-drawn writing and art. There is an authenticity to handmade
    stuff that's harder to get with an all-digital approach. \r\n\r\nAnd the funny
    thing is that it's almost always easier to actually draw/write this style by hand
    than it is to search for a \"handwritten\" font. Out of the thousands of handwritten
    fonts, only a few do it well. And they are all so particular. Each handwritten
    font has its own distinct personality.\r\n\r\nBTW, isn't <a href=\"\r\nhttp://new.myfonts.com/fonts/nicksfonts/spaghetti-western-wbw/\">Spaghetti
    Western</a> a fat face Egyptian?"
