body: 'First off, I&#39;d like to say that this place has become something of an addiction
  for me. I&#39;ve learned an incredible amount just by lurking. I&#39;d like to levy
  your collective knowlege of independent foundries. I&#39;m looking for a sans-serif
  companion to New Caledonia. This is one of the few times where I might be able to
  drop some coin of font licensing, so I want to make sure I&#39;m getting something
  good.  <BR> <BR>Background: I picked New Caledonia as a titling face for an online
  lierary journal, and as the titling and body face for a print version of the same
  thing. I wanted something that paired well with Georgia, since the online typography
  is important to me, but also stood on its own. New Caledonia seemed to have just
  enough Scotch in it, and like pretty much everything Dwiggins has done. <BR> <BR>It
  would also help to have a sans to go with it. In general terms, what category of
  sans goes with  Scotch Romans? As I understand it, they&#39;re most closely related
  to the Didones, which makes me think geometric, but they seem to have a more human
  quality about them. My first thought was an Avenir or Nobel, but I&#39;d really
  like to hear what else is out there. I&#39;ve learned a lot in the past just by
  watching Typophiles go about the process of recommendations. Thanks.'

- body: By jickity, you&#39;ll want to read the whole thing, but here&#39;s some paragraphs
    from an article by Vincent Connare. <BR> <BR><a href="http://www.connare.com/essays.htm"
    target="_blank">http://www.connare.com/essays.htm</a> <BR>&#40;This page might
    get updated, so it&#39;s another reason I&#39;m going to copy &#43; paste some
    paragraphs.&#41; <BR> <BR>&#34;In his most successful writing, Layout in Advertising
    &#40;1928&#41;, Dwiggins criticized the trend of the day of sans serif typefaces...Dwiggins&#39;
    comments were more correctly focusing on the new sans serifs coming out of Germany
    that were geometrically based and followed the philosophies of the modern design
    movement. A movement about streamlined pure and geometric design...&#34; <BR>
    <BR>&#34;This modernist philosophy went mildly against Dwiggins&#39; beliefs in
    craft, his training from Goudy and his work founded in Private Press movement
    of craft and calligraphy.&#34; <BR> <BR>This isn&#39;t to say that you still can&#39;t
    pair up New Caledonia with Avenir &#40;one of my favorites, sorry WAD!&#41; but
    you may want to ask yourself exactly how much you need a sans.  <BR> <BR>If it&#39;s
    for captions, maybe something like Lucida Sans could work. ? <BR> <BR> <BR>--
    <BR>Connare&#39;s article talks about the curves in left of u, and n, m, h going
    from modern thin to a thicker stroke, but at an sharp point. This sounds like
    the &#34;birds&#39; head&#34; in calligraphy. New Caledonia doesn&#39;t have birds&#39;
    heads, but does anyone know if an earlier version of Caledonia did?

  body: 'That&#39;s really interesting. I guess it&#39;s a little ironic that he designed
    Metro shortly thereafter. I had actually forgotten about Metro. That might be
    a really good face to use. <BR> <BR>To extend the original question: What do you
    look for in a pairing? What similarities of underlying structure make a good pairing?'

- body: Generally there should be contrast. You wouldn&#39;t want to have one being
    mistaken for the other. If that is happening, you might as well just use one.
    So it&#39;s really differences that make a good pairing, rather than similarities.
    <BR> <BR>Consider Lucida &amp; Lucida Sans. Although these are structurally similar,
    you wouldn&#39;t want to use them together at the same point size and same weight,
    but rather, one is an alternative to the other. <BR> <BR>What are you intending
    to use the sans for? Captions, body copy, or something else?

  body: Excellent advice, Brian. I paired New Caledonia with Interstate for a business
    publication &#40;5 years ago, when Interstate was a little less ubiquitous&#41;
    with excellent results.
