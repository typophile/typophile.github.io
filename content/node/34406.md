  body: "My initial thought was Bayer Universal, but it doesn't really have that much
    in common. More just the 'feel.'\r\n\r\nThere are definitely some nice things
    going on. The 'e' is cursive, which might work better in the italic than a roman.\r\n\r\nThe
    second half of your 'm' is too small.\r\n\r\nThe r, t, f may be too narrow when
    used in text.\r\n\r\nI really like the 'c,' more so than the circular a, b, d,
    g, p. q. And the o has a little more charm than the circular ones as well.\r\n\r\nThey
    seem to be in conflict with the c, but the c works nicely with the h, m, n.\r\n\r\nThe
    undulations in the k and x are nice, but might be too subtle. You notice them
    at this size, but they would disappear at anything smaller.\r\n\r\nI have found
    it interesting that type designs have to be a caricature of themselves. You look
    at them the size of your screen in order for them to function at 7 pt.\r\n\r\nGood
    start!"

  body: "Hey guys. I finally got to second version of this sans serif font. Compared
    to the first one there are many many changes as you can see by yourself. I tried
    to share the same style to all the letters now.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/inofont2_3906.jpg]\r\n\r\nYou
    can see all the tiny details in the PDF http://typophile.com/files/Inovares%20Font%202.pdf\r\n\r\nAll
    opinions about the font are more than welcome. Please tell me if this is an improvement
    in the right way and what else should I be careful about. I'll start with upper
    case letters if you think this is ready to go forward."

  body: "First off, I like it quite a bit and think the little flexes and the e and
    c work really well together. \r\n\r\nI think it's a step too far from the first
    version. The undulations that were nice and gentle in the first are overstated
    in this version (though the v and w are a definite improvement). Some of the characters
    are looking a bit top-heavy (a g h m n p q), though I think this has to do with
    changing the design of these characters pretty drastically. I'm not sure which
    direction I prefer. Can't say the y works for me...\r\n\r\nHave you given any
    thought to ligatures? "

  body: "You're right. Undulations were too exaggerated. I'm made another revision
    to balance undulations on \"k\", \"x\" and \"z\" and I've increased character
    spacing to make it more even and not squashed.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/inofont4_5470.jpg]\r\n\r\nAnother
    thing about the \"y\". I think the current \"y\" works best. I tried  three additional
    designs, but to me the original one works best. What would you suggest to base
    style of the \"y\" on what letter? I based it on \"v\" and \"g/u\".\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/inofont3_4485.jpg]\r\n(updated
    image)\r\n\r\nTo my eyes the original right stroke undulated version is the best
    one. Maybe the right stroke looks a bit heavier but that will be taken care of.\r\n\r\nLigatures
    would be part of the font as well (fi, fj, fl, ffi, ffj, ffl). Do you think there's
    a need for any additional ligature? I think the font is quite simple and plain
    and doesn't need anything beyond normal.\r\n\r\nOpinions much appreciated."

  body: "I like \"y\" #4. Yes, it can be confused with the \"v\" more than the other
    ones, but this isn't exactly a text face... Plus you can say it's inspired by
    the Greek script - people will like that. :-)  If you decide not to go with #4,
    go with #3. If anybody complains that it's too strange, tell them Fleischmann
    was doing it in the 18th century, and you hope people aren't more closed-minded
    now.  :->\r\n\r\nThe descender area of the \"g\" is cramped, and a common trick
    in fonts with such an issue is to make the head shorter - to lift the bottom of
    the head above the baseline a bit.\r\n\r\nMaybe not a \"mess\", but the \"w\"
    to me is clearly too elaborate. Here's an idea: if you end up using the fourth
    \"y\", try making the middle part a vertical line.\r\n\r\nThe \"x\" and \"z\"
    seem just a bit too curvy compared to the whole.\r\n\r\nAnd something new, which
    I should have mentioned\r\nfirst: I think the ascenders should be slightly taller.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    changes on \"v\" and \"w\" and added \"y\" (after 6 different styles this is the

    variation on a theme is even better (this was sooo subjective). For text-sizes
