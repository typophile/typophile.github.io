body: Hello fellows,  <BR> <BR>there is another theater &#40;opera actually&#41; poster
  i am working on. It is the opera &#34;Lucia di Lammermoor&#34; by Gaetano Donizetti.
  <BR> <BR>The story &#40;in a very shoet brief&#41; is about the forbidden love &#40;what
  else?&#41; between two young aristocrates Edgardo and Lucia. Their families are
  deadly enemies, so Lucia&#39;s brother Enrico and leader of the family tricks Lucia
  into believing Edgardo unfaithful. Enrico insists Lucia to marry Lord Arturo Bucklaw.
  Edgardo disrupts the wedding and curses Lucia. After a lot of tragic events Lucia
  starts getting mad and she is &#34;abadoning&#34; herself in a way. Her personality
  is DECONSTRUCTED day by day. At the climax of this proceedure she kills Arturo on
  their wedning night. This deconstruction of herself leads her to death as the paranoia
  and her sorrow destroyed her will for life. <BR> <BR>So, that&#39;s the story and
  below are the proposals. I am looking forward for comments. <BR> <BR>Have a nice
  day, christos. <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/37008.gif"

    C looks like somebody tore down the poster, and it was taped together. <BR> <BR>For
    D, the tiara &#40;or whatever it is&#41; is interfering with the legibility of
    the <i>Megaro</i> line. &#40;And the spacing between the A and the R looks off,
    probably because of the background color&#41;. '

    of a corporate typeface. i&#39;d say that doesn&#39;t fit to an opera. <BR> <BR>besides
    it is much too often used ...

  body: Agree with Ivan. Blood has it&#39;s appropriate place, in sample above it
    is used tastefully. I would however &#40;being overly critical&#41; move the blood
    tears a bit right so it is not as symetrical. <BR> <BR>Paths are a bit harsh and
    may look better if softened. Reversed face &#40;only showing nose&#41; facing
    right is a bit much, and should be reworked a bit to draw less attention. Idea
    is clever enough <BR>but subtlety goes a long way. <BR> <BR>overall the work is

  body: 'Hello kumbuniko <BR> <BR>you are right to be curious about this. <BR>I don&#39;t
    know how it works generaly but i will try to describe how it works with me: <BR>
    <BR>Being a professional -meaning that you make a living out of your work- makes
    you trying to sell your work. On this process a basic tool is to give a client
    the bigest variety of options you can. Of course this doesn&#39;t mean to show
    something you dislike only to have something more. But even if you have 2 things
    you like you can&#39;t like them equal.  <BR> <BR>There is a point when you stop
    creating and act as a viewer even in your own piece, and then you are as subjective
    are the rest viewers. There were times that i didn&#39;t like works of mine that
    have been chosen, but after an explanation of those who chose them i started liking
    them.  <BR> <BR>The thing is that even the creator sometimes cannot comprehence
    completely his work and a &#34;stranger&#34; can see more. So i believe is better
    to show also the work you &#34;don&#39;t believe&#34; so much, keeping always
    of course you quality line on a decent level. <BR> <BR>Hope i was understood &#40;i
    am not so fluent in english as you can see&#41;. <BR> <BR>Have a nice day, christos'
