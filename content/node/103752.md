  i.e., the question of how works of art, literature, and other forms of aesthetic
  expression can be transposed from one cultural context to another. Most of the texts
  relate in one way or another to the caribbean post-colonial writer/philosopher \xC9douard
  Glissant. I'm looking for a typeface for these texts.\r\n\r\nA tough nut to crack
  in terms of choosing typeface as it could easily and accidentally turn into exoticism
  \u2013 \"illustrating\" the problems of trying to convey ideas of post-colonial
  perspective and aesthetic expressions into typography. This is an example of  cover
  that shows how wrong it can go: http://books.google.se/books/about/Caribbean_Discourse.html?id=4NJkQLa2LgsC&redir_esc=y\r\n\r\nHow
  would one approach such a problem? \r\n\r\nCheers!\r\n"

    is not clear to me.\r\n\r\nShessler and Nick Shin, maybe I am one on the few graphically
    unhip people on typophile, but I am not able to read your minds. If you could
    explain what's good or bad about these covers, I would appreciate it."

  body: "The King cover is an example of d\xE9tournement or culture jamming.\r\nIts
    design is a pastiche of 1930s travel posters, employing politically incorrect
    typography* and imagery, but setting up a dialectic which satirizes it, while
    still cashing in on its exoticism.\r\n\r\nI don\u2019t know if that\u2019s good
    or bad for the OP, which is why I asked for an opinion.\r\n\r\nThe point is, you
    don\u2019t have to let the typeface choice carry the freight directly. That\u2019s
    a heavy load, and besides, the layout always colours the meaning of the type.
    So to seek a typeface which checks all the boxes is futile, unless you want to
    produce a dull clich\xE9.\r\n\r\n*The Expressionist Neuland, which has become
    a signi\uFB01er of ethnic primitivism.\r\n\r\n"

    body: Nick Shinn, Thank you. That's very helpful. Now I know why I had those mixed
      feelings about that King cover. Is this sort of thing okay for today's intellectuals?
      (I'm making a guess as to the target audience.) Or does the original poster
      have to answer that.

  body: "Simon, I don't necessarily see the point in choosing a typeface for its \"ethnic\"
    reference, just because your subject deals with a series of essays linked to post-colonial
    thought. I'd rather look for a typeface which works well for long text settings;
    if this is an Academic collection, I suppose you will have footnotes, small caps,
    different sizes for quotations, and even more layout issues. The point is trying
    to make the texts and the page structure clear and readable. I, for example, once
    set a book with a play by Aim\xE9 C\xE9saire in Cycles for the text settings and
    in Avenir for the cover - in the latter case explicitly trying to avoid any specific
    cultural reference and going for a, more or less, neutral look. Just my two cents..."
