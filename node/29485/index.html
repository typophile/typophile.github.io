<p>Don&rsquo;t know what makes you believe that, but I&rsquo;m glad to say your supposition is far from the truth. InDesign is fully Unicode compliant, so there&rsquo;s no reason for hacks. It&rsquo;s true that its text engine might not have all the shaping rules necessary for Tibetan (does Uniscribe?), but having a Unicode encoded Tibetan font and a proper keyboard layout, is all you need to do some Tibetan typesetting in InDesign.</p>

<p><em>What exactly “Unicode compliance” is in your understanding?</em></p>

<p>It can mean a lot of things. In this case I was alluding to the fact that InDesign is aware of all the necessary Unicode codepoints. This means that the font can use the codepoints that Unicode defined for Tibetan. There&rsquo;s no need for hacking it to use the first 256 codepoints that are assigned to Latin. People had to do that in the pre-Unicode era.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>It is not the same as OpenType compliance</em></p>

<p>Yes, I know that. I didn&rsquo;t mention OpenType, you did.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>, if people need hacks like that.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Alexander never explicitly said that he&rsquo;s hacking his font to overcome an InDesign flaw. And what I said in my previous post was that, if he definitely needs to hack his font, that shouldn&rsquo;t be because of InDesign (since InDesign can perfectly use a properly encoded Tibetan font).</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>I just do not know, do you execute OpenType features for Tibetan characters with Tibetan script tag?</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think so. That&rsquo;s what I meant when I said <em>&ldquo;It’s true that its text engine might not have all the shaping rules necessary for Tibetan&rdquo;</em></p>
<p>Sergey, have you tried to use InDesign? If so, which version?</p>

<p>Miguel,</p>
<p>I think this is a statement that is a bit overly optimistic, or at least imprecise. InDesign supports the Unicode character repertoire but there are many aspects of the Unicode Standard that InDesign does not entirely support, for example the bidi algorithm (UAX #9), the normalization forms (UAX #15) or some aspects of the case conversion. While InDesign is an excellent product, I do hope that its Unicode support will continue to improve.</p>

<p>Adam,
Yes, point well taken.</p>
<p>Simon,
Which part of my posts didn&rsquo;t you understand? At this point it should be clear to everyone that it is NOT necessary to hack a font in order to access the Tibetan Unicode block in InDesign, as you seem to be alluding to when you say:</p>
<p><cite>Your font appears to have a hack encoding - ie you map charatcters to the positions of basic latin code-points. I suppose you need this hack for InDesign, but this isn’t going to work in Word.</cite></p>
<p>Got it?</p>

<p>Why doesn’t Microsoft produce a plugin for InDesign that renders some text into a desired column width using RichEdit (i.e. Uniscribe), and then converts the result into outlines and passes it back to Indy as a graphic object? Something a la the DecoType OLE server that ships with the Arabic versions of Office, buz allowing the user to set some lines or even a few paragraphs of text?</p>
<p>Or, why doesn’t someone else do it? It should actually be relatively trivial ;)</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>The main issue with typesetting a Tibetan font is that there does not exist a uniform keyboard layout (palette) that can be installed on your computer. I suggest that this should get the first priority in the digital development of typesetting Tibetan.</p>
<p>Each Tibetan font uses their own methodology in mapping the Tibetan characters to the Latin ones on the keyboard (phonetically or QWERTY-method), and special software (such as Wylie) was developped to convert the transliterated text into Tibetan. This means that the user of this software (i.e. Wylie) first inputs the text in Latin characters. The whole text is afterwards converted in the Tibetan font, embedded in the software.</p>
<p>The Tibetan Unicode chart only relates to the base characters, vowel signs, diacritical marks, some of the subscripted characters and punctuation signs (and a few unnecessary symbols). 
However, the Tibetan conjuncts (the &lsquo;ligatures&rsquo; that Alexander was referring to) do not have an indivual Unicode number (although some of the &lsquo;half forms&rsquo; do). Each font developer has to use his/her own creativity in organizing these stackings of the Tibetan consonants to form the &lsquo;ligatures&rsquo; within their fonts and the OpenType features provide reasonable solutions for achieving this.</p>
<p>I have not yet studied Vista, nor Microsoft Himalaya, so I can not provide info on which keyboard layout or input system is used with this font.</p>
<p>Alexander, I was wondering whether you created the OpenType features in Fontlab or in VOLT. When you import your .vfb file into VOLT, then all embedded OpenType features will be lost and you need to create them all over again in VOLT.</p>

<p>You can create all OT features needed for Tibetan in VOLT. Fontlab currently does not support creation of one to many lookups (decomposition) required under ccmp feature necessary to handle characters U+0F73, U+0F76, U+0F77, U+0F78, U+0F79, and U+0F81.</p>
<p>Unlike with previous <em>&ldquo;un-intelligent&rdquo;</em> Tibetan fonts with non-standard glyph based encodings which did require <em>&ldquo;smart&rdquo;</em> input methods designed to work with particular fonts - a keyboard or input method for Unicode Tibetan only has to generate the simple base Unicode Tibetan characters as the complex conjuncts or ligatures are formed by the OpenType rendering engine applying the OpenType lookups in the font to get from the underlying simple basic characters to the conjunct glyphs. In other words, since the <em>&ldquo;smarts&rdquo;</em> are now built into the font (giving the type designer far more flexibility) they are no longer required in the input method.</p>
<p>If you want to use a Wylie (transliterated Tibetan) input method to enter Unicode Tibetan in Windows see: <a href="http://www.thdl.org/tools/tise.html" >TISE: Tibetan Wylie Input Utility</a> - also available at: <a href="http://byak.sinp.msu.ru/tise/">http://byak.sinp.msu.ru/tise/</a>. This type of input method does still require some built in <em>&ldquo;smarts&rdquo;</em> - since you are going from one script to another and there is not a straightforward one-to-one relationship between the characters typed and the Unicode Tibetan characters that need to be generated.</p>
<p>An example of a simple one-to-one keyboard for Tibetan script is the  <a href="http://www.thdl.org/tools/dzkeylayout.html">Dzongkha Keyboard </a> layout.</p>
<p>Any properly made OpenType font for Tibetan script should work fine to render Unicode Tibetan text entered using either of these input methods.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>In order to support Tibetan OpenType fonts a rendering engine or application needs to support and apply the following OpenType features for Tibetan script: ccmp, blws, abvs, blwm, abvm, calt, and kern.</p>
<p>(These are the features used in Microsoft&rsquo;s &ldquo;Himalaya&rdquo; font and in several other OpenType fonts for Tibetan script).</p>
<p>InDesign and other Adobe applications currently <em>do not</em> support these features for Tibetan script. Without that support you may be able to enter glyphs for basic Tibetan characters but the complex conjunct stacks (ligatures) absolutely necessary for proper rendering of Tibetan will not be formed.</p>
<p>Microsoft&rsquo;s Uniscribe does support these features - and Unicode Tibetan has worked pretty well for several years in MS Word &amp; MS Publisher - and in IE, Notepad, OpenOffice 2.x, Firefox,  Thuderbird and a number of other applications if you properly install the Uniscribe (usp10.dll) that comes with the most recent service pack for Office 2003 in  \Windows\System32\ directory.</p>
<p>The main drawback in Word was that Tibetan line wrapping was not implemented. This meant that you sometimes had to insert manual line breaks in order to get lines of Tibetan text to wrap at the proper place. I expect this has been properly implemented in Word 2007.</p>
<p>Tibetan line wrapping and even Tibetan collation (sorting) work fine in OpenOffice 2.x</p>
<p>On Windows XP I have very successfully entered and formatted several large volumes of pecha (traditionally formatted Tibetan books) using both Word 2003 and OpenOffice with Unicode Tibetan and OpenType fonts.</p>
<p>On Linux operating system Pango (used by GTK) and ICU have partial support for OpenType Tibetan script fonts. The main thing missing is proper support for ccmp feature. Lack of support for this feature causes  problems if characters U+0F73, U+0F76, U+0F77, U+0F78, U+0F79, and U+0F81 are encountered as these need decomposing before any other OpenType lookups are applied. Lack of support for ccmp may also cause problems with characters U+0F43, U+0F4D, U+0F52, U+0F57, U+0F5C, U+0F69, U+0F93, U+0F9D, U+0FA2, U+0FA7, U+0FAC, and U+0FB9 as most    OT Tibetan fonts either decompose or compose these in a lookup under ccmp in order to simplify later lookups.</p>
<p>(Without support for ccmp but support for the rest of the features everyday Tibetan and Dzongkha renders OK since all of the above characters are not normally found in common everyday words. These characters are mostly used in Tibetan transliteration of Sanskrit words.)</p>
<p>There <em>are</em> standard keyboard layouts for Tibetan script. One is the layout approved by the Government of Bhutan. A example of this layout can be found at:   <a href="http://www.thdl.org/tools/dzkeylayout.html">http://www.thdl.org/tools/dzkeylayout.html</a>. This layout is implemented in XFree86 and can easily be implemented in Windows using MSKLC.</p>
<p>I understand Windows Vista also comes with a Tibetan keyboard layout approved by the Chinese Government.</p>

<p>mark/mkmk will not be applied to Tibetan text by most OpenType shaping engines. Generally only a specific sub-set of OpenType features is applied for each particular script.</p>

<p>this is why I prefer to say that an application supports the Unicode character set, rather than saying it supports “Unicode”. The latter is an ambiguous expression, people may read different things under that label.</p>
<p>An even more difficult question is when it comes to “OpenType support”. Being able to render fonts in both OpenType flavors at all, being able to enter and display the full encoded character sets, or the full glyph repertoires in OpenType fonts, supporting some or all advanced typographic layout features for some or all scripts and languages, supporting the layout features necessary to correctly render some languages including directional support, supporting different GSUB and GPOS lookup types &ndash; all this are different “shades” of possible OpenType support.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the makers of the OpenType font format do not seem to be interested in documenting this publicly, which leaves us with obviously incomplete resources maintained by interested 3rd parties, such as the <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/info/opentype/">MyFonts OpenType</a> page (authored by Laurence and myself) or the <a href="http://www.typotheque.com/fonts/opentype_feature_support/">Typotheque OpenType</a> created by Peter Biľak.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>BTW, a Microsoft veteran Raymond Chen wrote an excellent posting about the ambiguity of the word “support”:</p>

<p>My favorite incarnation of the blurry meaning of the word “support” in the OpenType domain is the quotation from the OpenType specification: <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/OpenType/OTSpec/kern.htm">“OpenType™ fonts containing CFF outlines are not supported by the ‘kern’ table”</a>. It is a liguistic equivalent to the acrobatic splits, trying to say that while the makers of the OpenType specification do not “like” people putting the “kern” table into fonts that use CFF outlines, there is really no penalty for including that table anyway.</p>

<p>The order in which they&rsquo;re applied is set by the order of the lookups, not the feature set. So you&rsquo;re basically saying that there&rsquo;s no reason why one can&rsquo;t use ccmp and mark. If the general features are used, InDesign ME should support these fonts!</p>

Also, for cfinn: your sample of Tibetan pecha layout in OpenOffice is quite intriguing. Are you able to layout in OpenOffice in a way that prints two sides which flip vertically as opposed to the usual horizontal? We currently use a legacy font to print 3 folios per legal page in InDesign CS2. We thread from the top folio in front to the bottom folio on the back, then to the middle folio in front, middle back, bottom front, top back. Working from templates, we can thread a long text this way in little time. The resulting double-sided pages then just need to be cut in thirds. How does your OpenOffice method work?</div>

<p>In OpenOffice the best way is to make a template formatted for the final cut size - and there is a way of printing these folio sides so that they will come out two up or three up on a4 or legal paper in the correct order back to front.  You can &ldquo;print&rdquo; like this to a PDF file so that the folio sides are pre-assembled to make printing at any time easier.</p>
<p>I intend to write a document describing how to do this in detail which I will post on my website.</p>

<p>That was the origial intention of OpenType, but complex script handling led Microsoft to modify its approach and the Uniscribe script engines apply certain features in a fixed order, regardless of the lookup order in the font. So far as I know, the first two features to be applied for any script are &lsquo;locl&rsquo; and &lsquo;ccmp&rsquo;; after that, the order is determined by the layout needs of the script.</p>

(1) One part would describe how this or that current application or layout engine works. For backward compatibility, if desired. To be done by applications' developers.
(2) The more important part would be more instructive/imperative: How <cite>should</cite> layout engines do it? (This seems most important for complex scripts, but even Latin raises questions regarding typographic features like, which features to be called by an application&rsquo;s &lsquo;All Caps&rsquo; option &ndash; with or without &lsquo;lnum&rsquo;?) This would establish a stable ground for both font and application developers, and make sure users can expect the same font behavior across platforms and applications.</p>
