  of the project</a>\r\n<a href=\"http://www.craigoldham.co.uk/ongoing/letters/\">The
  outcome</a>\r\n\r\nI thought I give the blog a go, seems more like writing messages
  on bits of lead and throwing them in the nearest spring, still \u2013 this project
  shows the letterheads of some agencies and the handwriting of some designers raises
  all sorts of questions like \u2018why did they think that was a good idea?\u2019
  and \u2018call that handwriting?\u2019 and \u2018why would anyone over the age of
  11 use a rainbow pencil?\u2019\r\n\r\nTim"
