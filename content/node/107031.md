  think it has anything to do with it.\r\n\r\nDoes anyone know what on earth this
  font is?\r\n\r\nThanks in advance."

  body: "Hey joesruddock,\r\n\r\nthis is no Futura at all. Those compressed sans serif
    fonts where quite famous in Germany through the 1900\u2019s till 1930\u2019s.
    It looks, but my eyes could cheat me, that there a tiny serifs. \r\n\r\nMaybe
    you have a better view of this?\r\n\r\nInstead you could look at fonts like Wagner
    Grotesk or even Akzidenz Grotesk Compressed could be a similar choice."
