  body: "\"Any\" is the default that means the font has not been classified, so that's
    what you want. Yeah, it could be more clearly named.\r\n\r\n\"No Fit\" means that
    the font does not fit within any of the available categories.\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\nT"

  body: "Hello,\r\n\r\nI found this on [[http://www.panose.com/ProductsServices/pan1.aspx|panose.com]]:\r\n\r\n<strong>1.5
    Digit values of 0 and 1</strong>\r\n<em>\r\nThe reader will notice that the value
    0 and 1 are defined as Any and No Fit for every digit in the PANOSE system. These
    have specific meanings to the mapper. 0 means match that digit with any available
    digit. This allows the mapper to handle distortable typefaces such as multiple
    master fonts in which, for example, weights may be variable or serifs may change.
    1 means that the item being classified does not fit within the present system.\r\n</em>\r\n\r\nTherefore
    I use value 1 for 'not classified'.\r\n\r\nBest\r\nEigi"

  body: "Apparently if you do attempt to fill in the values, and get it wrong, that
    can screw up font menu behavior.\r\n\r\nAs the terminology is so bizarre and non-typographic,
    it's probably best for type designers to only enter \"Any\" or \"No Fit\"."

  body: FontLab--at least my installation on Windows Vista--attempts to fill in Panose
    numbers on its own, with mixed success. The default for weight appears to be Book,
    no matter the font, but Proportion, Contrast, and x-Height are usually more or
    less correct. Fontographer 5, on the other hand, gives you Any straight across
    the board...

    certainly better than trying to guess at correct settings based on the terminology.
    The terminology should simply be ignored, because Panose is actually a system
    of measurement, which the terminology obscures. The only way to set correct Panose
    values is to actually conduct the measuring and relevant calculations for each
    value. A number of foundries have made custom tools to automatically calculate
    Panose values; it would be nice to see something like this added to tools like
    FontLab. The few times when a client has specifically requested that we include
    accurate Panose information in a font, I have done the measurements and calculations
    manually using the documentation now available at www.panose.com"
