  body: "Twenty-plus years ago, the Chyron IV character generator used by many television
    stations had a function for creating true pixel fonts, but that technology has
    long since been eclipsed. Nowadays, I am reasonably confident that all of the
    pixel typefaces you see are TTF, PS1 or OT fonts that have been designed to reproduce
    cleanly without antialiasing.\r\n\r\nHere are a few tricks for creating a workable
    pixel font:\r\n\r\n1) Work with a clearly defined grid: 7x7 is probably the smallest
    workable area.\r\n\r\n2) The smallest design unit is a true square. All other
    elements will be composed of whole-number multiples of the height or the width
    of that square.\r\n\r\n3) Have fun and take chances.\r\n\r\nIf you would prefer
    not to re-invent the whell, there are a lot of serviceable and clever examples
    already available: <a href=\"http://dafont.com/en/author.php?author=308\" target=\"_blank\">Yuji

    to reproduce cleanly without antialiasing.\r\n\r\nSuperhinted TT fonts (like the
    previous generation of the MS core fonts) are this sort of thing. But they take
    a lot of effort. Which is why so many people now make what are called \"pixelfonts\",
    which has come to mean something different than \"bitmap font\", because it involves
    the use of an outline font to map pixels to a \"virtual grid\" - basically little
    outline blocks of one sort or another that map to exact bitmaps at a certain point
    size. The main reasons for this are that: Flash didn't support \"true\" bitmap
    fonts; and increasing (like MacOS now) bitmap fonts are not [properly] supported.
    Furthermore, if you want to handmake <strong>grayscale</strong> bitmap fonts (which
    I've been doing) you can only do it through pixelfonts (at least robustly and
    portably).\r\n\r\n> 1) Work with a clearly defined grid: 7x7\r\n> is probably

    We have too many, and their expressiveness is necessarily in proportion to their
    unreadability.\r\n\r\n> 2) The smallest design unit is a true square. All other
