  find this font for quite some time. Google research seems to have turned up very
  little, but maybe some of you typophiles might know.\r\n\r\nIt's from the Famous
  Five TV show screened during the 70's, hopefully this image will help with identification.
  \r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/enid-blyton-the-famous-five-dvd_5276.jpg]\r\n\r\nJust
  for clarification, it's the \"Famous Five\" text rather than Enid's singnature :)\r\n\r\nThanks
  in Advance,\r\n\r\nSam."
