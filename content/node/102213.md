  name force justified. I remember examples of it on the building exterior and then
  on the top of letterheads, etc... bugging the hell out of me.\r\n\r\nIt's not http://www.stedelijk.nl
  but does have a similar aesthetic."

    thinking particularly of their store bags.

  body: "Chris, \"force justified\" means forcing both left and right margins to align
    even when the result may look unacceptable. \r\n\r\nNormally it's used in reference
    to the last line of a paragraph, which might consist of only a word or two, and
    a short last line would normally be left alone.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/example2_4720.png]\r\n\r\nIn
    the logo example, I guess you could call it force justified, although obviously
    it was a deliberate design choice rather than an unexpected results of paragraph
    settings."

  body: Yes, that's exactly what I would think of if someone talked about a "force
    justified logotype." Though the link in the original post shows only a single
    line of type.

  body: "In the world I live in -- book composition -- you sometimes see \"force justify\"
    as a specification, usually applied to the type on a title page, and meaning it
    should look like the type James used in his logo example. \r\n\r\nI've also seen
    it applied to certain kinds of paragraphs -- perhaps an epigraph or dedication,
    very occasionally an image caption. In these cases, the width is sometimes not
    specified, but left to the compositor to make the best compromises.\r\n\r\nI've
    never seen it specified for a text paragraph, though in odd ways, it can come
    up. I've set a couple books where each chapter was a single paragraph. Too long
    for TeX's paragraph optimization routine, or InDesign's, either. What you do is
    essentially set several \"paragraphs,\" and all but the last one is \"force justified.\""
