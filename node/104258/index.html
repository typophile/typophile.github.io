When I look at the names FontForge is expecting for U+2605, I see blackstar, a35, DD130, StarDingbat1, uni2605 or u2605; there is no black SUN around*. And the Fontlab file standard.nam (mine from some demo is dated 2009) contains
<PRE>
0x002A asterisk
[...]
0x2605 !a35
0x2605 !blackstar
</PRE>
which, I guess, means Fontlab expects you to use <code>asterisk</code> for U+002A and does not like <code>a35</code> nor <code>blackstar</code> for U+2605 so that I would guess
<PRE>
sub asterisk asterisk by uni2605;
</PRE>
to  be the most likely working substitution. 
<p>I see that U+2605 is in very few fonts. I see it in the DejaVuSans fonts (named uni2605) but it is in none of the  DejaVuSerif fonts.</p>

<p>But they&rsquo;re not really shortcutting to the black star, if what they want in their text string is the black star character, not just the black star glyph in their display with this one particular font. With your method, what they get in the text string is **, and that&rsquo;s what they&rsquo;ll get if they copy and paste the text, change the font, etc.. I dislike this sort of thing because your resulting display is misleading: the user thinks there is a black star in the text, but in fact there isn&rsquo;t. Also, what if someone chooses your font to display some text in which there is a double-asterisk sequence, e.g. as part of a footnote system? It will display incorrectly as a black star.</p>
<p>As a general rule, don&rsquo;t try to solve character input issues at the glyph processing level.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Micheal, for years we set type using TeX running in a DOS box. This is pre-Unicode, but I built what we called super fonts that are similar to today&rsquo;s OpenType &ndash; small caps, proportional &amp; tabular figures, lining &amp; oldstyle, etc, etc., all in one font. Since we were running TeX in DOS, we&rsquo;d just change whatever characters we wanted to include by writing an encoding vector, leaving the first 127 (named) characters as they are in ASCII. Everything remained properly named</p>
<p>So, much of my experience was with author &ndash; or publisher &ndash; supplied files where a character could be font dependent &ndash; e.g., where someone in the world that relied on hard-wired Mac or Windows encodings had gone in &amp; made an 0macron, but put it in the odieresis slot. What a mess. Even more fun with Greek and all the different encodings used&hellip;</p>
<p>Nor is it always clear today just which file someone will go back to. We have jobs from when we typeset using TeX &ndash; always ASCII files, of course &ndash; and were making PDFs for the printer to use. Now, when the publisher wants to resurrect the text,  press #1 will want to use the ASCII files, but press #2 will want to use the pdfs. And this with our stuff, where character names were in fact correct. Imagine the situation where a Mac/Windows encoding (I think what you&rsquo;re calling WYSIWYG) was used.</p>
<p>Even today, with Unicode, I refuse to give the  double-f ligatures a Unicode codepoint. Yes, we may get a &ldquo;missing character&rdquo; with old or supplied files, but now is as good a time as any to fix that. Legacy characters should be banished while there is still someone around conversant with how we got that way. To introduce new errors should be a crime/misdemeanor.</p>
<p>EDIT</p>
<p>I agree that using the pdf format for archiving typeset material is <em>probably</em> the smartest thing to do. Treat it as standing type. We can go back to books set using TeX with PostScript fonts where the printer file was pfd, then make what are essentially patch corrections using InDesign with OpenType, and &ldquo;paste&rdquo; them into that pdf file. If you don&rsquo;t do this, the only other sane way would be to reset the whole job. Again, if you don&rsquo;t, the 3rd revised edition somewhere down the road could become really problematic. As I said, just treat the pdf as standing type &ndash; but not every publisher sees things this way, and of course, as the customer&hellip;</p>

<p>Presumably because you generated the PDF in a way that does not write the original text strings to the PDF, and hence Acrobat has used the glyph name of the black star in the glyph string come up with an encoding. That&rsquo;s kind of a round-about way of text input. :)</p>

Indeed. What the application is expected to do, I just don't know.
<p>I am now on another machine and I did a fast check, putting this time the ligature in liga to get right away the blackstar when typing ** without having to find what to do to activate dlig; I used the font in XeLaTeX (from the 2012 distribution) and InDesign CS3 and then opened the pdf with FontForge</p>
<p>I see that the name given by InDesign to the ligature in the pdf is asterisk_asterisk (even if the ligature in the font is <code>sub asterisk asterisk  by uni2605;</code>).
The name given  to the same ligature, same font, in the pdf generated by XeLaTeX is uni2605</p>
<p>That implies that if I copy-paste what displays like the black star in the pdf generated by InDesign, I get this: **;  if I copy-paste the same looking thing appearing in the pdf generated by XeLaTeX, I get this: ★. Of course, the search will behave accordingly.</p>
<p>When I have the time, I&rsquo;ll check with MacTeX 2013 because the pdf generated by XeLaTeX or luaLaTeX in MacTeX 2012  does  not allow searches on  stylistic variants. The pdf that is generated is just wrong.</p>
<p>PS. The font I modified is DejaVuLGCSans.ttf.</p>
