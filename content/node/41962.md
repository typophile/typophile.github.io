  design position. It seems that here in New York City, freelance work is everywhere
  but full-time positions few and far between. And because most studios want someone
  with 2-5 years experience, I was wondering what the best course of action would
  be: Is it better to work freelance in studios, getting that \"real world experience\"
  but have very little original work to show potential employers?  -OR-  Do I go for
  independent clients that may pay little and are notorious for less impressive work,
  but will at least allow me to create most all the design myself, thus having more
  to show those potential employers?\r\n\r\nAnd if the former: What do you show potential
  employers when all of your work is but a small contribution to an otherwise large
  collaboration? How can you really show what work is yours.\r\n\r\nAny advice would
  be well appreciated.\r\nAdam"

  body: "Adam - why not try to do both? Freelancing in a studio will give you a valuable
    look at how things are run, help you make connections, and maybe lead to a full-time
    position. Meanwhile picking up independent clients on the side will broaden your
    portfolio. \r\n\r\nIf you are showing potential employers or clients work in which
    your contribution was small it is best to be very direct and clear about that.
    I knew a designer once who went around passing off logos she had inked as her
    own designs. The problem was that the person who had designed them was meeting
    with a lot of the same clients. Her reputation went south pretty quickly."

  body: "i agree with patty, but also i emphasize that while you're young it's extremely
    valuable to get into active teams (even as a freelancer) where you can learn about
    real world situations, client handling, production strategies of the experts (or
    at least the more experienced team members), problem solving, and larger format
    issues which you're likely to miss out on in a smaller independent capacity.\r\n\r\neven
    if your entry level tasks seem less creative or even menial, the on site experience
    is  priceless. if you're smart and can get things done you'll rise through the
    ranks soon enough.\r\n\r\nteam experience in professional houses also scores points
    on a resume, and you can always pick up side work if you want more autonomy.\r\n\r\n\r\n"
