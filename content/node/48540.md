  is based on photographs taken while visiting the dominican republic (see photo below

  me know what you think! "

  body: "It is a very nice idea to be inspired by an inscription, such as the one
    you found) to design a typeface. Even if you have photographed a few letters (E,
    L, A, O, T and R) from the inscription you could still make various interesting
    alternate letterform designs. \r\n\r\nYou gave the title \u2018Dominico: Low Contrast
    Condensed Interpretation\u2019, as I understand it you wanted to give to the stroke
    weights a lower contrast (16/12) instead of the contrast displayed in the inscription,
    which is (21/12) and which accentuates the letterforms even more nicely.\r\n\r\nThe
    serifs in the inscription are not the same from letter to letter (compare the
    letters E and L and look at the attached JPG). The semi serifs in the letter A
    should be kept and it would be better than making them full serifs, - and this
    could also be done to letters such as V and W. The middle triangular shape in
    the letter E is quite innovative and should also be kept.\r\n\r\nThe serifs could
    be rendered in many ways, from very simple to more novel. There are many interesting
    and aesthetically appealing ways to introduce all sorts of serifs.\r\n\r\nOne
    doesn\u2019t have to do a full \u2018HAHBHC...\u2019 test, writing \u2018THE QUICK
    BROWN FOX JUMPS OVER THE LAZY DOG\u2019 is enough.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Web_El_Domenico_5542.jpg]"
