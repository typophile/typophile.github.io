<div class=commentbody>Gerald Lange, <br> <br>You seemed to be confused. But I have taken it upon myself to help you. Us middle aged white males are supposed to be kind to the young uns because we know so much. It's hard, young uns like yourself can be pretty cheeky and sometimes, just gol danged rude. But I'm going to give it the old school try. <br> <br>I know, I don't expect any thank yous. <br> <br>The Pascal60.jpg referred to by Joe was posted by Hrant on Tuesday, June 24, 2003 - 11:00 pm: Go have a read for yourself. Write that date down nice and careful like. <br> <br>But . . . Joe refers to my post of June 25, 2003 - 12:53 am. Go over it nice and slow like now. <br> <br>Follow! <br> <br>Joe's words, notice the date now. <br> <br>And it seems to me that Mr Giampa's post regarding <br>><a href=http://www.themicrofoundry.com/other/Pascal60.jpg target=_blank>http://www.themicrofoundry.com/other/Pascal60.jpg</a> <br>on Wednesday, June 25, 2003 - 12:53 am was exactly correct. <br> <br>W is for Wednesday, it is not for "winnuendo". <br> <br>I just knew you could do it. But just to be sure I have included, in quote, the following post, dated. Wednesday, June 25, 2003 - 12:53. See for yourself, write that down nice and carful like. Now I'm testing you boy, did you notice how I spelled careful? <br> <br>I should have been a teacher. I am a very patient fellow as we all know. <br> <br>Now I just love quoting myself. Here she comes. <br> <br> <br>"Posted on Wednesday, June 25, 2003 - 12:53 am: <br> <br> <br>Hrant, <br> <br>I see what you see, only I read it differently. I see cleaning out the corners. The metal must be clean or it will not relieve when cast. It will "hold" when the type is removed. What I can see is evidence of gravure slippage, or manipulation error on the top crotch of the "h". <br> <br>On the "b" if your theory was correct the punchcutter has lost control. Please draw your eye to the top bowel-crotch of the ascending stem. Either the top crotch is an error, or the bottom crotch an error? Take your pick. There is no need for one without the other. If you take issue to the nature of stems and placement compare the situation on the companion areas of the "d". <br> <br>So no more yeah buts . . . please! <br> <br>If "ink trapping" were "the intention" the application "should be even". His work, as you can easily see, is not that fussy. <br> <br>Or, lots of theory, little ability to apply. <br> <br>Meaning this artifact lends little support to your hypothesis. If he is cutting ink trapping intentionally he should have enough skills to apply hisprincipals evenly throughout. I am not disparaging the beauty of his letterforms in fact the cut-look-&-feel is integral to the very beauty. The crudeness is in effect, much more than secondary to the design. <br> <br>But "ink trapping", come come. <br> <br>These letters are much as if they were cut in linoleum or wood. Those are the characteristics which come easily when using similar tools such as a gravure. There are large and small gravures. Tools, including needles are used in small point sizes or tight areas. These cuts are <br>"humongoumamouth". <br> <br>Looking at these letterforms I see forms worked by mostly a single gravure, large by type cutting standards. Certainly it, possibly them, would be used only in the crudest of work when cutting an 8 pt. character. Probably, not even then. <br> <br>The very nature of these letterforms does not required fine gravures. The large gravure(s) have given the design the intended emotions of thedesigner. Cutting emotions. I suggest a more finished look would have greatly reduced its appeal. <br> <br>If you view the crotch in the Q you will see a place where it would "certainly deserve" the "ink trap treatment" you refer to "if the punchcutter believed as you". <br> <br>I see a punchcutter seeking a-cut-look-&-feel to his letterforms, and getting it. Forgiving people such as yourselves for mistaking them to be either faults, or "in your(s) case(s)" inktraps in order to achieve the characteristic nature of the letterforms that have drawn our attentions. By the way, which because of the tooling, are acidly beautiful. <br> <br>You have to love it for what it is, not for what you want it to be. You should remember that boys, and the girls shall be forever thankful. <br> <br>There is an acid sharpness throughout, and I suspect lots of "gravure", little "file". <br> <br>There is a general crudeness throughout and if you notice the "h" has another mis-cutting on the top left curve. Also if you view the beard of the same character you will see a flatness on the lower portions of the gravure straightening into perpendicular at the top of the stroke meeting closeto the same error. He is giving a lot of meaning to free handing and that I believe issues much of the beauty of this particular typeface. <br> <br>I highly recommend that some of you consider cutting types yourselves. The impossibility is merely an obstacle in your minds. But remember, <br>there is few of us left. Contact Jim Rimmer. <br> <br>Gerald Giampa <br>Lanston Type Company " <br> <br>End of quote <br> <br>So Mr. Lange! <br> <br>Joe says, <br> <br>And it seems to me that Mr Giampa's post regarding <br>><a href=http://www.themicrofoundry.com/other/Pascal60.jpg target=_blank>http://www.themicrofoundry.com/other/Pascal60.jpg</a> <br>on Wednesday, June 25, 2003 - 12:53 am was exactly correct. <br> <br>Re-read my post and tell me something intelligent! <br> <br> <br>Gerald Giampa <br>Lanston Type Company <br> <br></div>

<div class=commentbody>Yves Peters <br> <br>My issue is not with the your usage of "man". It is the usage of the word "male" as referred to in Hrants posting not to far above where we are now. And, to be sure, it is "sex" specific. <br> <br>Quote, Hrant. Quote within the quote is mine. <br> <br>"Demographic: middle-aged white American 'male'. It must've been something in the air while they were growing up, but they generally: salivate over obese disco fonts; refuse to admit the relevance -sometimes even the existence- of trapping; can't stand me" <br> <br>End of Hrants quote. <br> <br>I have no use for comments from people hiding under white sheets and burning crosses. I need not remind you of the plight of American "Blacks", for that matter American "Women". Granny bashing is a no no as well. <br> <br>For instance would the Typophiles condone this? <br> <br>"Demographic: middle-aged black American woman. It must've been something in the air while they were growing up, but they generally: salivate over obese disco fonts; refuse to admit the relevance -sometimes even the existence- of trapping; can't stand me" Gee, I wonder why? Comment: My own. <br> <br>Get the point. <br> <br>I realize that Hrant does not believe in democracy so why should he allocate sympathy to fact. <br> <br>Mr Lange appears to have the same problem. All I can say to him is read my previous posting and weep. <br> <br>Your input is thoughtful. I think that there should be room for differences in opinion, contrary to one of Hrants stated opinions otherwise. <br> <br>By the way I am a fan of your regular postings. They stand out in the crowd. <br> <br>Don't lose what you've got, it's something special. <br> <br> <br>Gerald Giampa <br>Lanston Type Co. Ltd. <br> <br></div>

<div class=commentbody>Jack, <br> <br>You must be going blind and growing warts. I said good bye already. God some of you guys give me the heeby jeebies. <br> <br>Us middle age Honky males are just a little to set in our ways. I hope you don't mind but I have declined your offer. Surely you don't mind a little rejection. With logo like that I imagine you are a pretty lonely little boy. But when you grow up you should not be peeping through keyholes as you suggested, and don't talk dirty to us old Honky males. <br> <br>Now run along a play with your little toy. <br> <br>You got to learn that no mean no. <br> <br> <br> <br> <br>Gerald Giampa</div>

<div class=commentbody>Gigi, <br> <br>you're being inconsistent: <br> <br>quote In Canada there is a law against age discrimination. unquote <br> <br>I may not have casted type more than 60 hours and even if I have just started my career, I always tried to be respectfull regarding other persons and their work. Obviously Gigi doesn't. Indeed, I did lower myself by writting my few last reactions, but my goal was to see how Gigi would react upon. As my assumptium was right, he answered in an almost childish way, unprofessional and personal. Although we've never met. <br> <br>I think this forum can endure some heated up disccussions. But if one is wanting to get personal, he or she should do that on different means. If so, he or she must have a lack of respect or maybe even some problems. Or he or she desperatly seeks for attention. <br> <br>Don't forget what this forum used to be about. <br> <br>Bye bye, I have some more important things to do, like drinking coffee for example. <br> <br> Jacques</div>

<div class=commentbody>> I said good bye already. <br> <br>Of all your fabrications, this is definitely the one I most wish wasn't one. <br> <br>You see Gerald, in a virtual community you can't stop people talking to (or at) you. If you really want people to stop, you'll have to leave <i>for real</i> then wait a year or so for your previous presence to wash out. But I recommend something much more challenging: develop the required -and admittedly paradoxical- combination of sensitivity and tough skin to stay and become a useful member here. Now that you're "in" and have pissed off so many people so much, your choices are much more limited - I'm talking from experience! :-) <br> <br>It's a shame Joe couldn't seem to handle to heat (unless he quickly decided that the advertising he was doing here simply wasn't cost-effective), because I think he is indeed a nice guy, and is willing to teach what he knows. <br> <br>hhp <br></div>

<div class=commentbody>At the risk of getting my (virtual) head smashed for this comment... the most absurd about all this is that the whole flame war began with a discussion about hot metal tye. I mean, how few folks in the Western World share a love for metal type? How few folks still work with it -- couldn't be much more than a few dozen, maybe hundreds, right? I know I only get to work once with it (not me personally, but with a printer realising a design with movable type) and I loved it, just as I ove steel engraving and all that old-school stuff. But still, from the few folks left who in this digital age dig the idea of handlettering with lead letters and all that, you still manage NOT to celebrate the joy of your common fondness for type, but instead you argue and quarrel. Reminds me a lot of the comic-book-forums where in a dying medium fnas and creators alike are rather often thannot at each others throats. This has absolutely NOTHING to do with personality (e.g. John Byrne and Peter David both are nice guys individually, but get them together online and they can't keep from ... cyber-vomiting on each other). Same story here. Sometimes its fun to watch, mostly it gets depressing after a while as it is the internet-age counterpart of pissing in the snow. <br> <br>If this is actually keeping people like Joe or Erik or whoever fromposting here, we're all loosing out big time. There's a lot of folks hanging round here whose work I positively admire (and some whose work Ilearned to admire by getting to know them here :-), and I frankly fell off my chair when I saw that Erik Spiekermann had written a post or that Yves Porch</div>

<div class=commentbody>I think most people who don't participate in public discussion groups have much more rational reasons than avoiding personality conflicts. Usually, they simply don't see much to gain for themselves. Yes, it's mostly our loss, but you can't <i>force</i> them to be gracious and generous. <br> <br>BTW, I dislike metal type: it's highly display-centric and very limited. Letterpress though (like through photopolymer plates) is a different story. And just the fact that few people do it doesn't mean we shouldn't discuss and get passionate about it. After all, what percentage of people design type at all? <br> <br>hhp <br></div>

This is not a bazaar. We're mostly here because we love type, and I for one believe that commerce impedes cultural progress. If you want to be culturally relevant, you better start making fonts that don't [necessarily] sell very well, but will open up new (as opposed to 30 years dead) avenues in the craft. If you don't, then don't expect too much respect from people like me. You don't want respect from people like me? Then we're set. <br> <br>hhp <br></div>

Intellectual exchange or social interaction. <br> <br>Although the first definition might not serve to encourage cultural progress directly, I have trouble understanding how the second aspect of "commerce" could do anything but encourage cultural progress. Isn't it difficult to engage in the "buying and selling of goods" without involving some social intercourse? This "social" part of commerce, admittedly along with many other things, is what I believe contributes to cultural development. It's not the money changing hands, it's the dialogue that preceeds the exchange of money.</div>

<div class=commentbody>In it flew, over the transom. <br> <br>Look, a note! <br> <br>Sigh, it's not from Will Ransom.... <br> <br> <br>>...and I'll continue pointing out <br>>that you're wasting it. <br> <br>Thanks. I guess that's why people are currently buying our fonts twenty and more at a time. At the retail prices, to boot. <br> <br>Here's your own pill back: <br> <br>"Don't try to decide things for other people." <br> <br> <br> <br>>BTW, Typophile doesn't <br>>"conceptually uphold" piracy. <br> <br>I did not say that Typophile itself (the mechanism) did. Did I? <br> <br>No, I did not. The phrasing purposely pointed to individual posters, who will undoubtedly recognize themselves. <br> <br> <br> <br>>But it is an open-minded, tolerant place, <br>>where rabid, blind, self-righteous <br>>protectionists tend to be as shunned as <br>>wormy dyed-in-the-wool pirates. <br> <br>And shunned they should be. <br> <br> <br> <br> <br>>If you want to be culturally relevant, ... <br> <br>Here's your own pill back, yet again: <br> <br>"Don't try to decide things for other people." <br> <br>Oh, yes, and see above: I guess that's why people are currently buying our fonts twenty and more at a time. <br> <br> <br> <br>I decided to take a look at this list's content, as I said, because I thought it was a professional list. (I still think so.) <br> <br>It would be a mistake to think that I started contributing to this list for the purpose of seeking out respect. As I said earlier on, I don't try to build an ersatz career out of showing up on listservs. <br> <br>And as I'd even earlier said, when I see disinformation being doled out, especially where students and those new to the profession might well be tainted by it, I'll seek to set the record straight. <br> <br>Nothing more than that, really. (Well, I might have a question of my own, from time to time. Hopefully, if I need help, the group might reply accordingly.) <br> <br> <br>>This is not a bazaar. <br> <br> <br>I should think that those aware enough of type's nicety and variety to be on this list would welcome the opinion and guidance of actual experts working commercially in the field, and for decades, as being - well - expert. That it doesn't seem to, evenly, is striking. <br> <br>It's generally been an attitude of not allowing the record to be set straight, plus considerable overt baiting, that has continued argument in counterproductive fashion. Ending up wasting a lot of space. <br> <br>I realize that you don't see that. <br> <br> <br>Looking back at some archives here, and on other type related lists, I have come to realize, this week, that the agenda of baiting has been going on for many years now. <br> <br>That the baiting recently turned personally prejudicial adds to the lopsided unfortunateness of it all. <br> <br> <br> <br>>You don't want respect from people like me? <br>>Then we're set. <br> <br> <br>If you do prove yourself to be a type professional eventually, as you claim to want to be, you will have my innate respect for that. You already have my respect for trying hard. <br> <br>From where you seem to be currently in your apparently very limited type appreciation spectrum, I have no idea how to suggest you get there. <br> <br>Pack your box with more than just six liquor jugs, though. It's a long journey. <br> <br>Joe <br> <br></div>

<div class=commentbody>My problem with fonts is the ones I purchase via online or via the Linotype Explorer thing go missing since I reformat my computers yearly. Then I have that problem of tracking down the info to reorder. I bought several Dwiggins designs when I was in Reading but hell that was a lifetime ago now. And no I don't back up. So all I'm left with too is CG Omega or CG Times, Comic Sans, Georgia or what ever ends up in my fonts folder from some app or system. <br> <br>At the end of the day I do choose to use a font but if it matters I don't pick any of the system fonts. But your average Joe probably picks Comic Sans since it doesn't look like CG Times or Book Antiqua. But it did go through my mind when I was in Florence and across from the hotel there was a Trattoria with Comic Sans painted at 1 foot letters for its sign, all around the building. What was going through there mind? And the bank machines in Italy? Who made that descision, 'Oh this looks readable, let use it.'??? <br> <br>I just wish the guys who made CG Omega, Book Antiqua, Palacio, or Swiss got all the stick I get for Comic Sans, at least I can be happy with the memory why I made it and not to piss off a historically relevant type designer. <br> <br>Funny thing is I don't think I've ever used Comic Sans for anything, oh actually I have it in the MSN Messenger but I'm not sure I picked that myself. </div>

<div class=commentbody>And speaking of dialogue balloons: <br> <br>I'm still waiting for at least a somewhat professionally presented thought bubble of how Mr. Smeijers's <i>Renard</i> "mark[s] true [typographic or cultural] progress". <br> <br>To use your words. <br> <br>Your post's prompting me to look at <i>Renard</i> for the first time has after all, as a Typophile forum contributor, really has gotten me thinking. <br> <br>I'm especially interested to hear all about how it has gotten you thinking. Because it apparently does not 'milk the masses', to use your words. <br> <br>I may be dreaming again, but I am currently taking your phrase 'milk the masses' to mean, perhaps: <br> <br>1) Giving people what they want, not what they need. <br> <br>or, possibly: <br> <br>2) Building solely upon typeface concepts of old, rather than striking out in a new direction that bears no resemblance at all to anything that anyone has ever seen before. <br> <br>or, maybe the nonproductive, purposely sensationalist vagueness translates as something else? <br> <br> <br>Er, whenever you are able. <br> <br>Thanks! <br> <br> <br> <br>(To Mr. Smeijers: Sir, I mean absolutely no disrespect. I'm simply using the reference to your typeface concept as an opportunity to gain professional enlightenment from another forum member who refers to the very lovely works as landmark.) <br> <br> <br> <br>I'd asked (and at the risk of belaboring it, which I don't seek to do): <br>>Am I not allowed to express my opinions <br>>(so long as they're relevant and in good taste) <br>>on this (apparently) very culturally inclined list? <br> <br>[ ] Yes. <br>[ ] No. <br> <br>And I'll add, for an extra comfort in the waistband: <br> <br>I ought to be able to offer my views on Typophile (as on other lists) as a working professional without fear of battery by time wasting, sensationalistic, often vague and misleading baiting? <br> <br>[ ] Yes. <br>[ ] No. <br> <br> <br>And while we're about it, I'm curious as to your considered feelings about this other rambling I offered above: <br> <br>>The reason why certain fonts become <br>>a shipping part of an OS is indeed their <br>>cultural relevance. (Plus, licensing opportunities.) <br>> <br>>Or at minimum, because of a perceived belief <br>>(with or without research) that the chosen <br>>fonts would lend more relevance to the OS <br>>they're bundled with, through their own <br>>apparent relevance. <br> <br>[ ] Yes. <br>[ ] No. <br>[ ] Have no idea. <br> <br> <br> <br>>This stance is not for the sake of <br>>argument itself, but for my own self-improvement. <br> <br>I absolutely agree. <br> <br>Time is too short for baiting and fighting. <br> <br> <br>I don't know about you, but I'd rather be drawing type right now. <br> <br>Joe <br> <br> <br> <br></div>

I just don't dwell about that. <br> <br>Designers are free to look at whatever they choose. <br> <br>I am aware (from looking at 1:1 overlays of it that I've made from high quality scans), that there are popular faces out there from currently well known and respected designers whose characters - designed much later than mine - basically lay right over top of letterforms I designed by hand for some of my more popular faces, with little alteration, renamed.

For the sake of simply being contrary. <br> <br>Uninformed contrariety is counterproductive on a list like this, it seems to me. (In my humble opinion. FWIW.) <br> <br> <br>>Nobody dragged you in here, right? :-/ <br> <br>No, actually, I dragged myself in. <br> <br> <br> <br>>You are a slave, my friend, <br>>just like 99% of the rest of us. <br>>Denial only deepens your servitude. <br>>No baiting, no innuendo. <br> <br>Again, what in the world are you referring to? <br> <br>Of my being a slave to typography?

<div class=commentbody>Joe, I'm holding back because I'm afraid you'll waste my effort. You know how you keep saying much of your presence here is to prevent influentiable young'uns from being led astray by me? Well, conversely, people who have been doing something the same way (and in their mind successfully, apparently) for three decades are probably beyond hope, at least when it comes to online discussion. As I've said before, it's not possible to administer effective psychotherapy through ASCII. <br> <br>That said, what do you think it means when a text face has unconventionally dark color? If you really are curious about any of this, you should read Andy Crewdson's piece about Arnhem on his New-Series.org site. <br> <br>> how does it (simply as the named example in this case) avoid 'milking the masses'? <br> <br>It (the font) doesn't avoid or pursue anything, of course. But its <i>designer</i> didn't do it mostly because he thought it would be a best-seller, that's all. As a rule, that makes all the difference. <br> <br>> Do you really think that my review at other designers' types should exactly parallel yours? <br> <br>Well of course not. But I do think looking at others people's fonts helps, certainly culturally. So I'm just curious: do you? Bill Troop has claimed that most designers don't know what's going on among their peers. Although I find that hard to believe, it probably applies more to designers more focused on making money than those not. Any thoughts on that? <br> <br>> I don't worry about what other type designers should be looking at <br> <br>There you go... :-/ <br>I'm not meaning to dictate what other people do, I simply think looking at the work of your peers is culturally valuable. If you equate culture with materialism, I can see why you don't agree. <br> <br>> basically lay right over top of letterforms I designed <br> <br>Let's hear some names. I'm not necessarily doubting you, I just like to see justice served, and getting things like this in the open can only help. <br> <br>> And why in the world would you ever accuse me or my firm of such a thing? <br> <br>Because every other post you point out that you're successful in the field because your fonts sell well! Your benchmark (at least the primary one) seems to be money. <br> <br>> you wadded up the test <br> <br>Oh, it was a test... <br> <br>Battery: I don't mean to batter.

<div class=commentbody>>Joe, I'm holding back because <br>>I'm afraid you'll waste my effort. <br> <br>Oh, sure. Right. Like I would actually attack someone giving a thoroughly considered exposition about a typeface that was well presented and accurate.

And not just footnote someone else's work while wrapping in meanness. <br> <br>Go ahead. I know you have it in you to fly high, and go beyond Mr. Crewdson's piece. <br> <br>And we weren't talking about <i>Arnhem</i>, were we? <br> <br> <br>>(...) influentiable young'uns (...) <br> <br>Hrant, how old are you? 13? <br> <br> <br> <br>>(...)probably beyond hope, <br>>at least when it comes to online discussion(...) <br> <br>More pot calling the kettle black, I'm afraid. <br> <br>Why would working in the field for 10, 20, 30, 40, 50 years automatically dictate that a designer wouldn't be able to understand current lists and communicate on them? <br> <br>Do you really believe that all type designers who have worked more than 5 years are feeble? <br> <br>Analysis, based on empirical evidence: <br>This appears to be another core confusion for you, I'm afreud. ;-) <br>And it's led you into a lot of unwarranted and widely published, very public bigotry. <br> <br>Another test, because you've worked hard to earn it: <br> <br>Q. When should knowledgable, working type designers post to lists that [Hrant] populates? <br> <br>[ ] Only if working in type for up to 24 hours. <br>[ ] Only if working in type between 24 hours and 5 years. <br>[ ] Only if working for 5 - 10 years. <br>[ ] Only if working for 10 - 20 years. <br>[ ] Only if working for _________ years. <br>[ ] Never. [Hrant] can't tolerate working professionals. <br>[ ] Never. [Hrant] can't tolerate working professionals because they just don't understand the real circumstantial, consumer culture of type. <br>[ ] Never. Working means profiteering, and that's unacceptable since all type should be free as little butterflies. And after all, it just doesn't take into account the real culture of type. <br>[ ] Never. [Hrant] can't tolerate working professionals because they might actually be successful, and success is bad, very bad. <br>[ ] Never. [Hrant] can't tolerate working professionals because they just aren't giggly enough, like someone who has just swallowed a big bag of cannabis to avoid detection.

This is my [Hrant] list, so shove off! <br> <br> <br> <br>>As I've said before, it's not possible <br>>to administer effective psychotherapy <br>>through ASCII. <br> <br>And yet you waste so much time doing just that.

I'm not picking on you in particular, nor ever meant to. <br> <br>You just happen to be one currently dispensing irrelevant, misleading concepts. Then, as if that's not bad enough, it's laced with vitriol. <br> <br>Whether about design, how people react to design, the marketability of type, how well certain type did over time, why certain individuals or companies chose to do what they did. Whatever. <br> <br>When someone who actually knows the reasons or the history, says so and details that (quoting from empirical evidence, even generally), it's usually a good idea to accept it and acceed further argument on it. <br> <br>But that usually doesn't happen. Just more contrariety for its own sake. <br> <br>It's about listening and learning. Instead of trying to distract and disrupt the class. <br> <br> <br>>It (the font) doesn't avoid or pursue anything, <br>>of course. <br> <br>Explain, please. That makes no sense. <br> <br> <br>>'milking the masses' <br> <br>>But its designer didn't do it mostly <br>>because he thought it would be a best-seller, <br>> that's all. <br> <br> <br>To all the type designers on this list: When you start a new typeface development, do you ever know whether something **is going to be** a best seller? <br> <br>That it's a guaranteed slam dunk? <br> <br>I never do, and nor do I think about it. <br> <br>Hrant, I believe you are harboring an idea about that which simply doesn't exist in the real world. <br> <br>It appears to be coloring your thoughts in unproductive ways that are confusing you. <br> <br>Now, at the end of the production of the very lovely work that he did, don't you think that he hoped (being both a human being and obviously a highly skilled commercial artist) that it might have the ability to become successful? <br> <br>Yes, I should think so. Naturally. <br> <br>It's rational, that's why. <br> <br> <br>>As a rule, that makes all the difference. <br> <br>That has nothing to do with anything. Totally irrelevant. <br> <br> <br>>So I'm just curious: do you? <br> <br>Do you actually think I work with blinders on; in a bubble? <br> <br>Do you really believe that type designers of any stripe work that way? <br> <br>>Bill Troop has claimed that most designers <br>>don't know what's going on among their peers. <br> <br>You're actually going to fall back to quoting Mr. Troop on this? <br> <br> <br>>If you equate culture with materialism, <br>>I can see why you don't agree. <br> <br>More irrelevant flotsam. Ear elephant. <br> <br> <br>>Let's hear some names. <br> <br>I only mentioned it as an indication that I not only look at other designers' work with a world view, but that with such detail that I see where I'm being copied. Or, I suppose more precisely, where my development work is used as a 1:1 template by others. <br> <br>Yet, despite being clear and detailed about that, you still asked, <br>"But I do think looking at others people's fonts helps, certainly culturally.

Your benchmark (at least <br>>the primary one) seems to be money. <br> <br>Well, I realize by now that you still don't see it. But I only brought salability forth as evidence supporting the argument for what constitutes 'relevance'. <br> <br>I think I've already reiterated that. <br> <br> <br>>>> you wadded up the test <br> <br>>Oh, it was a test... <br> <br> <br>Of sorts. I should think someone as steeped in academia as you would recognize a test. And in any event, instead of avoiding taking it, to simply take it and be done with it. <br> <br>Sure seemed elementary to me. <br> <br> <br>>Slavery: just forget I mentioned it. <br> <br>Well, I only belabor this because I think you choose your very hurtful, unwarranted words very carefully. <br> <br>I think they step over the line of verbal sparring; over the line of trading ideas professionally about the profession of typography. <br> <br>I think it does a very big disservice to type and I for one wish you could find some empirical data that you can quantify to demonstrate how to stay on point and in a non-offensive, content-filled, constructive way. <br> <br>If it's supposed to be 'wrestling', go join WWE. <br> <br>After all, you'll get to be on TV. <br> <br> <br>Joe <br> <br> <br></div>

<div class=commentbody>> Like I would actually attack someone <br> <br>No, not attack. Just side-step. Like you keep doing. I've answered most of your questions while you've answered only the convenient ones, and only to go into a long-winded diatribe. Well, no more of this bitch-slapping for me. I'll just choose the issues that can help <i>other</i> people. In this case, there's only one: <br> <br>> do you ever know whether something **is going to be** a best seller? <br> <br>Of course not. But each time somebody makes a given font he strikes a different balance between materialism and culture. The best example I can think of is Carter's Cadmus: after years of making (or being cornered to make) highly inauthentic but profitable Greek fonts through Linotype, he decided to make a culturally significant one. It sold like one copy (to Cyprus), and it's highly probably Carter knew it wouldn't be as popular as the mass-milking stuff. There are other examples too - I know because designers have confessed that to me - because I <i>talk to them about stuff like this</i>. <br> <br>So, specifically who's work do you observe (admire?), and why? <br>And I don't mean from 30 years ago. <br> <br>hhp <br></div>

<div class=commentbody>>No, not attack. Just side-step. <br>>Like you keep doing. <br> <br>I guess you mean: like you've kept on doing, throughout this rather spirited type discussion. <br> <br>The pattern loops forever: <br> <br>1) I offer a professionally presented thought, freestanding or in reply to a forum member's question or simply adding a thought to an existing thread, because I think I have something true and well considered to contribute, as a working professional. <br> <br>2) You insult me and/or my clients, sometimes with bigotry. <br> <br>3) I reply with professional substantiation, on point. <br> <br>4) You then either: <br> <br>a) Insult me further, <br> <br>or <br> <br>b) run from the subject you started inflammation within, never apologizing for the attack on me or my customers, instead moving on to the next wild sensationalism. <br> <br>In all fairness, there is a surprisingly multifaceted number five: <br> <br>5) Sometimes you refer me to a standing article that's not even on point. Or, you try a hurried patch job. Or, you admit 'no empirical evidence'. Or, you quote Bill Troop. <br> <br> <br> <br>>Well, no more of this bitch-slapping for me. <br> <br>Aw, shucks. (Mommy, they aren't censoring 'shucks' here, are they??!) <br> <br>Actually, I wasn't....er...doing what you just said. <br> <br>All I asked for was a professionally presented critique from you, about a subject apparently important enough to you to recommend I find out more about. <br> <br>To paraphrase you, yourself and You (yes, all three personalities) from an August 12 post of yours: <br> <br>"It's a shame [you] couldn't seem to handle to heat." <br> <br>The grease fire on the stove that you chose to start. <br> <br> <br>Man, you dodge faster than Ricochet Rabbit: <br> <br>>I'll just choose the issues that can <br>>help other people. <br> <br>Gee, I guess that's other than me, isn't it? <br> <br>I guess I'll never get that in-depth, original thought from you about how <i>Renard</i> "mark[s] true [typographic or cultural] progress". <br> <br>(Again, to use your words, and again, only using the delightful <i>Renard</i> as the example you foisted, foist.) <br> <br>Oh, whatever will I do for help on the subject now? <br> <br>After all, I never look at other designers' work and Hrant won't even share his type viewing guide with me. Wauuuugggghhhhh! <br> <br>(Well, that was refreshing.) ;-) <br> <br> <br>And as I mentioned on August 15: I'm still waiting for a non-simplistic, non-naive explanation of 'Circumstantial culture'. I thought for sure you would have come back with - at minimum - photocopied grade school Venn diagrams out the wazoo about it already. Jeez. <br> <br>Well, whenever you have time. Between potshots. <br> <br> <br> <br>>So, specifically who's work do you <br>>observe (admire?), and why? <br>>And I don't mean from 30 years ago. <br> <br>Just can't give it up, can you? You know, Hrant, really. I've had enough insults. <br> <br>Look, I started discovering type in detail in the 1960s, cross-referencing which designers did what. I've lived with type studying it fairly continually since, and actually participating in the professional side of the industry since 1978. <br> <br>I spend a minimum of five hours with it daily and sometimes up to sixteen. <br> <br>I have my favorites and I have those whose work I care less for, as anyone would. <br> <br>There are thousands that are somewhere between those extremes. I feel as though I'm always learning, so my heroes are always changing. <br> <br>I actually enjoy it all, and even with most contemporary, horridly drawn stuff masquerading as type, I still try to find its silver lining. <br> <br>(I brought up Tony Stan earlier because he happens to be one whose work seems to have stood the test of time better than many.) <br> <br> <br>To the list: <br> <br>Beware the advice from a quack dispensing medicine with a skull and crossbones on the label. <br> <br>A slug from a jug of such glug is not likely to cure what ails you. <br> <br>Joe <br> <br> <br></div>

<div class=commentbody>Joe, <br> <br>That invitation gives me a warm and fuzzy feeling and I'll just bet Hrant serves tea and cake afterwards? Boy, I wish I were you. <br> <br>How about John Downer's work? I've heard Hrant just raves over it. Give it a shot! It's always polite to be agreeable.

<div class=commentbody>Talk about baiting... <br> <br>Anyway, since it's come up (off-topically), I'd say that Downer has made some great display faces, consistently of high focus and good craftsmanship. <br> <br>In terms of significant cultural contribution, I'd mention Triplex Italic, and of course Vendetta. A while back I wrote a pretty detailed and generally positive review of the latter, and the only opinion I've changed about it is that -as a usable text face- it needs some -admittedly tricky- optical compensation to convey its "abruptness" consistently across different sizes. <br> <br>Although he's been flexing his talent and great skills in lettering more than type design lately, he's actually developing a "workhorse" font called Paperback - few people know about that... correction: <i>knew</i> about that. :-) <br> <br>You see, Joe, you don't have to like somebody as a person to take their <i>work</i> seriously. Intellectual integrity requires objective curiosity. <br> <br>hhp <br></div>

At least of the former. <br> <br>I'll be more than happy to have a civil discussion about type with you once you can prove you can have a civil discussion about type - sans humanist baiting. <br> <br>(Oops.

I'm sure you can find them if you look. <br> <br>(Warning: It might require more than keyboard typing! I'm not quite dead enough yet for those things to be an easy find on ebay.) <br> <br>If that fails, simply try setting samples in my TF Forever. Or TF Habitat. Or TF Ardent, or TF Hotelmoderne. Or TF Twygmond. Or TF Masterstroke. Or TF Maltby Antique. <br> <br><a href=http://www.treacyfaces.com/sample.html target=_blank>http://www.treacyfaces.com/sample.html</a> <br> <br>Any type specimens you generate from typefaces I've designed should tell you a lot about me and how I look at type. (Bearing in mind that our Typesampler displays at monitor resolution.) <br> <br>Any type specimens you generate from typefaces I've helped our licensed artists to nurture and perfect before bringing to market (such as TF Alambic or TF Cirgeos) should tell you a lot about me and how I look at type. <br> <br>Just comparing my TF Forever's 'cultural contributions' to the world of the humanist sans ought to keep you occupied for some time. <br> <br>Our customers (however much you apparently loathe them) see these 'cultural contributions' and eat them up. Surely, you will come to recognize the differences, too. <br> <br>We have an excellent 28-page One-Liner and we have an in-depth 424-page catalog, each published this year. <br> <br>I don't believe you're on our mailing list. Have you ever cared about our original contributions to typography since 1984 enough to even sign up? <br> <br> <br>>(...) great display faces(...) <br> <br>See, I don't even feel 'safe' discussing display typography with you, because of your apparently blinding predisposition against 'obese x-heights'. <br> <br>Naturally, you're entitled to your opinion. But that particular clinginess coupled with an inexplicable disdain for anyone who worked (however successfully) over 5 years ago, seems to color all else counterintuitively. <br> <br>Leading you to strike out unnecessarily. <br> <br>Or striking you to lead out unnecessarily. <br> <br>One or the other.... <br> <br> <br>>Intellectual integrity requires <br>>objective curiosity. <br> <br>I just cannot believe I never knew that before you just lectured me on it. Zowie! <br> <br>But hold the press: now you're 'objective'? <br> <br>And where would you get the idea I don't like you as a person? I just find your public behavior professionally regrettable. <br> <br>Lather: You drive your unwitting opponent into a lather. With all the blather. <br>Rinse: You wash your hands of having caused anything, hoping the list is ADHD plagued. <br>Repeat: Get it yet? <br> <br>When will the pop psychology babble subside? <br> <br> <br>Anyway, I really have tried to sincerely and clearly state my position on your unwarranted, stupifyingly bigoted publicly published remarks. Including, remarkably, those which strike out at <i>customers</i> of our fonts. <br> <br>As of now, I fully expect you'll continue with the bombast. I cannot discuss type under those terms. <br> <br>To the list: If any of the foregoing has seemed self-serving, I profusely apologize. It was not meant to be. <br> <br>Joe <br> <br></div>

<div class=commentbody>Joe, don't you realize you're increasingly losing control of yourself? Get a grip, man - I'm not worth it. And just because I'm calm doesn't mean I'm manipulating anybody. I'm not out to harm you in any way. <br> <br>> I'll be more than happy to have a civil discussion about type ... <br> <br>Come on, just name the names of designers you admire! Just follow your own guidelines for "civility", and what do you have to worry about? This isn't some political campaign. <br> <br>> I'm too shell-shocked <br> <br>Then I was right, unfortunately. <br> <br>> there are probably fifteen years worth of displays and articles out there <br> <br>Please do list a subset for our benefit. I have to be frank and say that for somebody so financially successful (in the context of type) and so experienced, I've seen too little coverage of you and your work - and I do pay attention. What would you say the reason is? <br> <br>BTW, I spend as much time collecting references and reading up on type as I do posting here (largely thanks to my deep mining of the UCLA library's collection as well as ability to fetch me pretty much anything I want). <br> <br>Why do you have so much trouble getting specific? The only tangible opinion I remember you saying so far on Typophile is that large x-heights are a godsend. <br> <br>> Any type specimens you generate from typefaces I've designed should tell you a lot about me <br> <br>Well, duh. <br>But so can your answering some of my questions. <br> <br>> I don't believe you're on our mailing list. <br> <br>Sure, sign me up. But: <br>1) I have looked at your site. <br>2) Do you realize how many foundries there are these days? <br> <br>> I don't even feel 'safe' discussing display typography with you, because of your apparently blinding predisposition against 'obese x-heights'. <br> <br>I guess you never got my point. <br>My objection to obese x-heights is: <br>1) Largely limited to text faces. <br>2) A functional issue, not some prejudice. <br> <br>Furthermore, if I'm a charlatan, what do you have to fear so much? Let people judge for themselves. <br> <br>> an inexplicable disdain for anyone who worked (however successfully) over 5 years ago <br> <br>Complete fabrication. I admire many successful people who have been designing type for decades, as long they make <i>cultural</i> contributions. Names? Carter, Unger, de Groot, too many others. <br> <br>hhp <br></div>
