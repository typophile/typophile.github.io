body: "Typekit, purchase, rental, DRM, etc .. it's all good, but here is an idea that
  can be easily implemented right now and that will cover the <strong>100%</strong>
  of the web design community needs.\r\n\r\n<em>An online service that for a monthly
  fee allows rasterizing unlimited amount of text in a specific typeface. You select
  the typeface, the size and the color and it gives you a transparent PNG back. Licensed
  for a web use PNG that is. </em>\r\n\r\nIf you think for a moment how <em>exactly</em>
  non-standard fonts are used in the web design, it will immediately make perfect
  sense. They are used sparingly for headers, menus and such and they are always rasterized.
  The web designers need the PNGs, not the OTFs or TTFs. So sell them just that.\r\n\r\nIf
  the service fee is reasonably low (something like $10 per year per font, or perhaps
  $50 for the buffet), this will open up existing font portfolios to a much much wider
  designer audience. It should also curb the piracy to a certain degree, because people
  are stealing fonts predominantly for the online use.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, this should
  allow for using custom rasterizers that are font- or foundry-specific. Case in point
  - [[http://typophile.com/node/57114|Effra]] from Dalton Maag.\r\n\r\nMyFonts, for
  example, already have all the technology in place to make this happen. Just needs
  a trip to a lawyer and a web interface. It all can be up and running in a matter
  of weeks.\r\n"

    not a terrible idea from 'can it be done' standpoint, it's just what we were doing
    circa 5 years ago. sIFR is a better option than that in a lot of cases, and @font-face

    what we are still doing circa now. There is a lot of web designers that use pre-rendered
    text in their designs. What I have suggested is going to simplify their life,
    and give foundries more control over what's happening with their fonts in the
    online context.\r\n\r\nI fully understand that rendering on the end device is
    far better than pre-rendering, and I do not disagree that latter is full of problems
    as per your list. Font-face adoption for the design (as opposed its support in
    browsers) still has a long way to go, and the pre-rendered text is here to stay
    for a while. All I am saying that there is no reason not to improve at least some
    aspects of it. "

    Sure, graphics can be resized. But they will look icky.\r\n\r\nI suspect that
    the perceived plausibility of this scheme is influenced by where you're coming
    from: Stuart at Font Diner almost exclusively works with unusual display faces

  body: "Thomas, thanks for the reply. \r\n\r\nThe point I am trying to make is that
    the use of images for headers, menus, etc. is already an established practice.
    \r\n\r\nIf you look through a [[http://creattica.com/css/latest-designs|Creattica]]
    or [[http://patterntap.com/tap/collection/headers|PatternTap]] collections, you
    may notice how wide-spread its use actuallt is. For example, have a look at [[http://www.curbinnovative.com|this
    site]], which is quite typical as far as the use of technique goes. Even larger
    sites, like [[http://www.jivesoftware.com|Jive]] and [[http://www.akamai.com|Akamai]]
    use it.\r\n\r\nNo reason not to offer a special font licensing option for these
    cases. There is a lot of smaller designer shops working on smaller projects that
    can't really justify paying $200 for a font family, do not really need the actual
    OTFs, but would gladly use it for their designs. Offering them rasterized option
    not only means a better looking web, fewer reasons to look at the piracy and an
    additional revenue stream for the foundries, it also builds the relationship with
    them and makes them more likely to purchase the real deal later on. Similar to
    how village does it with their \"taster option\".\r\n"

    for posting this. I've become re-interested. \r\nJust as the increase in bandwidth
    has made @font-face a viable proposition so too, might some of these image replacement
    techniques be worth a second look.\r\nSome sites might not want to settle for
    the fallback font-family. On a well-optimized site the performance hit for this
    kind of stuff might be acceptable if not over-used.\r\n\r\nDesigners certainly
    want the kind of \"graceful degradation\" that fonts-as-images provide. But are
    they willing to put up with the unwanted side-effects?\r\n\r\n>This is an ugly
    practice, doesn\u2019t scale, doesn\u2019t reflow, >etc.\r\n\r\nIt scales somewhat
    but gets fuzzy. However, if there were onzoom or ontextsize change events built
    into browser javascript engines a true re-scaling could be achieved.\r\n(FF is
    finally, at least, providing a javascript property for detecting the zoom level.
    But no events as yet.)\r\nI've done some research and proof-of-concept work on
    this aspect of scaling and browser capabilities.\r\nReflow can be achieved right
    now, using javascript and Ajax. Kind of a production, though. Don't know if it's
    worth the hassles. Easier to apply it only to short headlines far left aligned!\r\n\r\nThis
    as a service? Not optimistic about that, but who knows.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://readableweb.com\">Rich</a>\r\n\r\n"
