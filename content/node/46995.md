body: I am trying to find a grotesque sans serif that could be very similar to [[http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/singles/process/maple_regular/|Maple]].
  I have looked at [[http://typophile.com/node/18671|all of these grotesque sans serifs]]
  but it seems that none of them are close.  Are there other typefaces which are based
  on Stephenson Blake that are very similar to Maple?
