  type, etc..) when creating a company logo.\r\n\r\ni've got some ideas though, however
  i'm still having a hard time in putting it in to a graphic form that's why i can't
  upload yet the designs i have in mind now.\r\n\r\nhere's a quick company background:
  it's an energy company with business of dealing with indigenious and renewable sources
  of energy (wind, geothermal,solar, etc..) and being a total energy company it is
  involve in all aspects of energy development from engineering, construction, design,
  and consultancy.\r\n\r\nthis is just an internal solicitations of logo designs of
  the company within its workforce that's why services of professionals were discounted.
  \r\n\r\nthanks to you all!"
