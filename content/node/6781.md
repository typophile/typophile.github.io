    target="_blank">prokyon</a>? <BR> <BR>I don&#39;t think either of those are right,

  body: My guess would be <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/handel-gothic/bold/testdrive.html?s=opodo&amp;p=48">Handel
    Gothic Bold</a> slightly condensed, but it errs on the side of boxiness where
    signa errs on the side of being too organic.

  body: It also looks like it could be a beefed up version of <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/cartercone/skia-cc/regular/testdrive.html?s=opodo&amp;p=60">Skia</a>.
    Wasn&#39;t there a bold weight of Skia at one time? Back in the heyday of programmatic
    TrueType?
