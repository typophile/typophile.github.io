  body: "I'm not sure that subtitles would necessarily be done using a conventional
    font. I suspect some special built-in bit-mapped font supplied with the subtitling
    equipment/software they use.\r\n\r\nThis is not Verdana/Tahoma, which would be
    the most likely screen fonts. I guess it <em>could</em> be Arial, at a crappy
    screen resolution. \r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
