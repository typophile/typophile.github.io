  body: "I didn't find this one. If it's a font, it's well hidden from the casual
    searcher.\r\nIf I had to make it from a font, rather than from scratch, I would
    start with Impact Bold Condensed http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/urw/impact/ and
    make the words as follows:\r\n_r_....\tuse n, shift the top curved portion of
    the interior contour up so horizontal stroke is about half as thick, cut off the
    bottom 60% of the leg\r\n_e_....\tshift the top curved portion of the counter
    up so horizontal stroke is about half as thick, same procedure for bottom stroke,
    drop bottom of counter to thin horizontal stroke.\r\n_s_....\tuse o, same procedure
    as for e to make top and bottom strokes thinner, cut openings in sides and add
    horizontal stroke.\r\n_t_....\tuse U, delete rhs, same procedure as for e to make
    bottom stroke thinner, thin vertical stroke to match lower case width, add rhs
    crossbar\r\n_a_....\tuse o, same procedure as for e to thin top and bottom strokes,
    cut opening in lhs and add horizontal stroke, square rhs bottom corner.\r\n_u_....\tuse
    u, same procedure as for e to thin bottom stroke\r\n_r_....\tsame as first r\r\n_a_....\tsame
    as first a\r\n_n_....\tuse n, same procedure as for r, but don't cut the leg.\r\n_t_....\tsame
