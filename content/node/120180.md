    why you are all so offended by the font used for subtitles in films so much! Can
    anyone enlighten me?

  body: "typography is more interesting than sports, celebrity news, the Prime Minister
    and the weather. As the \"nuts and bolts\" of written communication and therefore
    of all acquired human knowledge capable of being written down, plus the technology
    to do so, it is also more useful than some of those things. Doing it well makes
    life better. Doing it badly makes it worse. Perhaps some people don't care about
    that, but if that's the case, why would they waste time here?\r\n\r\nPersonally,
    I'm not offended by fonts used for subtitles. I'm offended when people who are
    paid way more than me make obviously lazy, lackadaisical and unconsidered font
    choices... That I could be making.\r\n\r\n:o)"

    But I guess if it fits the 70s... Typefaces don't always have to be pretty.
