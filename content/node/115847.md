  an undergraduate, Typophile was a big part of my formative design education.\r\n\r\nI
  was a teaching assistant for a section of Type II at my design school, The Creative
  Circus. As part of my TA duties, I had five to ten minutes of each class to talk
  about whatever type-related thing I wanted to talk about. I wrote a blog post about
  these mini-lectures, and I'd love to hear what y'all think. I'm sure there are things
  that some of our more curmudgeonly members can pick apart.\r\n\r\nhttp://edoctor.tumblr.com/post/83022679290/doctor-overanalyzes-typography-ii"
