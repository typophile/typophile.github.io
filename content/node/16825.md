body: I was wondering if anyone is familiar with pricing a commercial type design
  project in the UK that will go global through screens and possibly web (-big time
  hinting!-). What is even more important is timing. I roughly estimated 8 months
  of part time work (I can only work for it part time) and I 'm a bit afraid to say
  that to the client. And the fee is getting too spicy as well. Any opinions? I would
  be grateful.

    1. Do you want to: a. work by the hour and figure it out as you go along, or b.
    make a specification, get a price and schedule, sign a contract/letter-o-agreement,
    and then begin. (There are other ways, most usefully notably a combination of
    \"a\" for a little while, and then \"b\", but, there are lots of combinations
    that don't work so well). 2. if b is ever selected, the font development process
    should be specified, alpha through omega: font format(s) and tech details, glyph
    set(s), description of intended typographic use, appearance(s), licensing(s),
    exclusivity and schedule \u2014 figure out how many hours that means, multiply
    by \"your\" number of chits-per-hour, and see if it's worth it for both you(s)
    and the client(s).\r\n"

  body: 'I concur with David: it is very important to spec the development out before
    an agreement is reached. I usually begin by making a glyph set spreadsheet in
    which I can distinguish base glyphs and composites, then calculate design and
    hinting costs based on a glyph count.'

  body: "Thank you very much for your responses. \r\n\r\nI also considered similar
    issues and quoted the client. However, due to the amount of work involved the
    pricing seems to be a bit spicy. I estimated 45 days of work according to my rough
    plan, just for the creation of a single normal font (original). I have not got
    a clue about the timing an established professional studio. I 'd be really interested
    in having a rough idea of the work timings for such a projects (original font
    creation for a corporate client, licenced worldwide). Is the pricing of the licensing
    of a font different if it's for a global use over the internet (than buying it
    from fontshop for instance)?"

  body: "Spyros, \r\nThere are millions od prices ;), but we divide a design and production
    fee from and a licensing fee, so when you say \"Is the pricing of the licensing
    of a font different if it\u2019s for a global use over the internet (than buying
    it from fontshop for instance)?\" It's apples, and apples sauce. I.E. one can
    lic. from fontshop and pay for a single workstation, (or 2), or one can license
    for de world and pay another price. In design and production, every project has
    a different specification, schedule and price. Without having that info, pricing
    is best done at the dart board of intuition. "

  body: For custom work, the other things to consider are a) how badly do you want
    to do the job (not necessarily because you really need the money, although that
    is one reason to quote competetively, but maybe it is an interesting project that
    will be personally rewarding), and b) who is the client. Two of my three biggest
    clients are major international software corportations, and the third is an academic
    association devoted to Biblical scholarship. The latter gets a discounted rate.
