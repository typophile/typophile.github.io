body: "Hello - \r\n\r\nI'm a MFA student at Parsons the New School Of Design at NY,
  USA. For my Master's thesis I am pursuing a typeface design project - \r\n\r\nABSTRACT:\r\nEnglish
  + Hindi = Hinglish\r\n\"Hinglish\" is emerging as a commonly spoken language in
  India and amongst Indians living in USA and UK. It is used vocally, while chatting
  and it is often seen in popular culture such as TV shows, Movies, Books, Magazines,
  Chat rooms, Song lyrics etc.\r\n\r\nI want to design TWO display fonts that reflect
  this notion of being Hinglish. - A Latin (English) font that is influenced by Indian
  Culture and a Devnaagri (Hindi) font that is influenced by Western Culture. I hope
  to create a scenario for compare and contrast with my two fonts that can both reflect
  the notion of being cross-cultural.\r\n\r\nExamples of influences from Indian culture
  are:\r\nhenna, Rangoli, folk art, Warli, batik paintings, paisley designs, peacock
  symbolism, Indian Jewellery, miniature paintings, architecture, temples, religion,
  Bollywood etc\r\n\r\nExamples of Western Influences are:\r\nart deco, neon signs,
  grunge look, pop art, mordernism etc\r\n\r\nMOTIVATIONS:\r\n1) I am of Indian origin
  studying in the US and would like my work to reflect that duality.\r\n\r\n2) There
  are very few Display fonts available in Hindi and this has limited their use in
  \r\ngraphic design in India. Also amongst the ones available they are not influenced
  by such western motifs-\r\n\r\n3) There are very few display fonts in English of
  Indian influence - Barring a few exampls like -\r\n\r\nkalakari - by beth Shirrell\r\nSamaro
  and samaran\r\n\r\nIndia has a rich aesthetic tradition and I want to bring that
  into my display fonts.\r\n\r\n4) I hope these fonts can comment and reflect upon
  today's era of globalization and high information exchange.\r\n\r\n5) I chose to
  design Display fonts over a body copy as it allows me to be more expressive and
  pay more attention to aesthetics over legibility.\r\n\r\n\r\nINITIAL SKETCHES:\r\n1)
  Inspired by Indian Jewellery:\r\nhttp://rohiniblog.blogspot.com/2009/09/prototypes.html\r\n\r\n2)
  Inspired by Warli Folk art:\r\nhttp://rohiniblog.blogspot.com/2009/09/prototype-2.html\r\n\r\n3)
  Inspired by Indian Instruments:\r\nhttp://rohiniblog.blogspot.com/2009/09/prototype-3.html\r\n\r\n\r\nPlease
  feel free to comment on - my concepts, motivations, preliminary sketches and more
  -\r\nAny feedback, thoughts and suggestions would be most appreciated.\r\n\r\nThank
  you,\r\nRohini\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n "

  body: "My feeling is that a Latin alphabet is a Latin alphabet. You can decorate
    and distort it, but it will always be fundamentally Latin, particularly typographically.
    Trying to Hindi-anize it is like putting lipstick on a pig (sorry, bad metaphor
    ;-)\r\n\r\nOK... a better metaphor... take a random non-Indian, put stereotypically
    Indian clothing on them and ask them to speak with an \"Indian\" accent. I would
    not find that meaningful or interesting.\r\n\r\nPersonally, I think it would be
    more interesting to see meaningful comparisons or combined uses of English and
    Hindi. Maybe you could create pieces with side-by-side English and Hindi. You
    could craete visual metaphors for single words, and then alternate between showing
    the word in Hindi and English.\r\n\r\nI think one of the most interesting a meaningful
    things about language is when a word has no exact equivalent in another language.
    Or maybe the concept is just not as widely understood. Some examples would be
    Juche, Zen, Karma, etc.\r\n\r\nAnyway, I hope that is good feedback. I do think
    the project has a lot of potential, especially if you are well versed in \"Hinglish\".
    That is something people want to learn about and experience, but in a more meaningful
    way than type decoration.\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Hi Rohini,\r\n\r\nI like the idea of the project, but if I'm honest, without
    the photos and explanation, I wouldn't have sensed anything 'Indian' about any
    of those Latin initial sketches. That could be that I have the wrong perception
    of what is 'Indian', but I think it's more that they just look like decorated
    or oddly shaped Latin letters. \r\n\r\nI think with type you may be better off
    drawing your influences from type. What I mean is, it might be possible to do
    a Latin alphabet that has the feel of some of the forms of Hindi glyphs, as opposed
    to trying to decorate a Latin alphabet with 'Indian' things. \r\n\r\nIf that doesn't
    work, maybe dirtcastle's idea makes sense:\r\n\r\n\"Personally, I think it would
    be more interesting to see meaningful comparisons or combined uses of English
    and Hindi. Maybe you could create pieces with side-by-side English and Hindi.\"\r\n\r\nI
    think you could do a wonderful piece with combining the two. It would very representative
    of 'Hinglish' to find two typefaces that can be read in the same line, so that
    just as Hinglish flows back and fourth between Hindi and English, maybe so could
    the text. \r\n\r\nIt could be interesting to see some Hinglish dialogue written
    with the English words with the Latin Alphabet, and Hindi words with the Hindi
    alphabet.\r\n\r\nJust an idea - the initial sketches don't really seem to match
    up with the brief for me, though. Sorry!"
