  of Amsterdam and would really appreciate some feedback on the design so far. It's
  not finished yet, I'm considering changing some of the letters but it would be nice
  to have some opinions regarding the overall look of it so far. Thanks!\r\n\r\nBigger

    could be a little lighter, they stand out because they're so fat. To even the
    colour I'd suggest using lighter versions.\r\n\r\nIsn't the Amsterdam logo (XXX)
    normally used vertically in stead of horizontally?\r\n\r\nX\r\nX\r\nX\r\n\r\nin
    stead of\r\n\r\nXXX\r\n\r\nI get the tile-like layout, however it's somewhat black,
    too present to my liking. Maybe tone it down or make them smaller?\r\n\r\n"

    has a page with fonts he made from signage in Amsterdam. It''s all freeware, done
    by an amateur, but you might find some nice things at his site: [[http://home.tiscali.nl/r_keijzer/fontenwerkplaats.htm]]'

  body: "Thanks for the feedback! I\xB4ll definitely need to change some of the letters,
    I\xB4d like to add some in the Amsterdam School style (thanks for the link Micha,
    some nice stuff in it), just need to go for a walk and take some photos. The XXX
    can be used both horizontal and vertical, in the Amsterdam flag for example it\xB4s
    used horizontally, but you see it a lot on the vertical version on the coat of
    arms, on street signage or on the decoration of buildings. \r\nI think I\xB4ll
    try a new version without the black square background on the ornaments, just make
    the ornaments black on white and maybe scale up the letters a bit, it might look
    a bit lighter. I\xB4ll post it here when I have a new version. Thanks again!"
