  typefaces</a> at <a href=\"http://www.fountain.nu\">fountain</a> last night, wow
  I love them all !\r\n\r\n<em>Plumpo</em> designed by Peter Bruhn is particularly
  intersesting, why isn't it released already ?\r\n<em>Nordic</em> looks really promising,
  and I think I'll buy <em>south</em> as soon as it's out.\r\n\r\nWonder if <a href=\"http://www.bruhnfamily.com/\">the
  bruhns</a> are as nice in real life, as they are online."
