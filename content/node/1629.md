body: Had a neat opportunity to design the identity for the reverend who was officiant
  at my wedding. &#40;Somewhat precipitously, as the judge didn&#39;t show -- but
  that&#39;s another story.&#41; <BR> <BR>The logotype is in Adobe Caslon Semibold,
  with italic swashes. I like how the R and T look, but something&#39;s funny with
  the C... any suggestions? Also, can anything think of an elegant serif typeface
  with swashes and ligatures that might look better? <BR> <BR>The feeling I&#39;m
  gunning for is &#34;elegant and dignified&#34;. <BR> <BR><IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/1852.jpg"

  body: You might also consider Jonathan&#39;s eponymous <A HREF="http://www.typography.com/catalog/hoeflertext/"
    TARGET="_blank"> Hoefler Text</A>. All weights have a complete set of swashes,
    and you have the option of italic small caps with some great alternates as well.  <BR>
    <BR>The swash &#39;C&#39; is the same basic style as your Caslon example. You
    might try using a non-swash one instead, if you don&#39;t like the open, swoopy
    quality of the swash form. I personally prefer a lighter weight for &#34;elegant
    and dignified.&#34; <BR> <BR>-- Kent.

    swashes? Here is what I had in mind. I couldn&#39;t resist. Forgive me? <BR> <BR><IMG

  body: ' ;&#41; Glad you caught the mood in which that was sent. I think with anything
    that smacks of decoration it is all about find the perfect balance. <BR>--- <BR>Perhaps
    the capitalizing of W, M and O in Wedding Minister et Officiant?  <BR>--- <BR>This
    will sound arrogant to everyone probably, but when the design is elegant and sophisticated
    I think it looks sloppy to use all lowercase. Is that too hardcore? Maybe this
    will start a new debate. &#40; playing devils advocate :&#91; &#41; <BR>--- <BR>What
    about the third line of type being the same length as the other two? <BR>--- <BR>I
    do however like how the top two lines are resolved. It feels more calligraphic.
    And I love the way the R nestles itself in between the nC '

  body: I like Tiffany&#39;s blend...  No offense, but especially for a guy who&#39;s
    not exactly straight out of the seminary... adding a bit of the straight and narrow,
    elegant, staid serifs to balance swash excess... should send those wedding planners
    swooning. <BR> <BR>At least none of these examples have crossed the line from
    appropriately ornate to New Jersey living room, gold-leafed girly. I&#39;ve helped
    some friends with wedding stuff and the taste in type for invites and whatnot
    is scary. <BR> <BR>&#40;and hey... I know a guy who became an ordained minister
    via the back of a magazine; he may be a bit of an alcoholic but he&#39;s quite
    serious about his work!&#41;
