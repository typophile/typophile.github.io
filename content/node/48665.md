body: "So I am planning to make a simple and clean personal business card with a sleek
  and clean look to it. I already have the logo and I wanted to see if I could get
  some advice on a nice professional looking Sans-serif type face that will complement
  \ Times New Roman which I used in my logo. This is my personal logo.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/personal
  logo Cody G_5353.png]\r\n\r\n\r\nAny comments on the logo would also be appreciated,
  It is easy enough to recreate with any typeface, I just liked the way that Times
  New Roman looked. \r\n\r\nThank you "

  body: "hmm, I suppose it could use a typeface that will reduce down better, although
    I must say i never intended to print it at 1 cm\r\n\r\nNow that I look at it there
    is an unusual point of conflict between the r and i. I think that I will search
    for a new font for the words. Though I quite like the way the Times New Roman
    G wraps around the diamond."

  body: "Of these two, I prefer the top one with the name fully justified. I think
    the empty space left in the bottom version is awkward. I tend to consider how
    a logo can be combined with other elements on things like business cards and letterhead,
    and I think the top one has more possibilities. HTH.\r\n--\r\nNancy Foster\r\nFontzilla's

  body: Thank you very much for your input Nancy. That is true, the bottom one would
    probably create an unusual space when added to a card. Do you think the new set
    is an improvement over the old logo?

    floating a bit.

  body: ">> <em>Do you think the new set is an improvement over the old logo?</em>\r\n\r\nYes,
    I do prefer the new set over the first one. While the effect of the diamond shape
    going both over and behind the G is cool, it would be lost somewhat when reduced
    to the size needed for a business card or sent via fax. This is why I always design
    logos first in just black and white. That way I know it will work on a photocopy
    or over a fax. With your second set, the lighter blue thin cross hairs could be
    converted to black for things like fax cover sheets and still work fine. \r\n--\r\nNancy

  body: "I never noticed the h floating, perhaps ill have to print it out again and
    \ take a closer look at the h.\r\n\r\nYes, I did notice that before I redid it,
    at smaller sizes the corners of the diamond seemed to get lost and it just looked
    like a G. That's a good idea, to design it in black and white first. I probably
    should have done that with this one. In any case I have a long way to go as a
    designer and a very long way to go as a typographer. :)"
