body: "Hi folks,\r\n\r\nI was hoping to get some advice on choosing a font for a tag
  line. The original logo is a combination of stone and stone sans. The client envisages
  the new strap line being created in a script type font below the current logo. My
  concern is should i be adding a new font to the logo or would it be more appropriate
  to use an italic stone script. Any advice or direction would be greatly appreciated.\r\n\r\nthanks,\r\n\r\npaul"

    you would want to use as an alternative. And to some extent what category. '

  body: "\"is there some common fonts used for that type of tagline application?\"\r\n\r\nNot
    as far as I know, Paul. But I really do think that that choice would depend entirely
    on the context - what category, what the tagline says, how it looks when set against
    the logo etc. \r\n\r\nBtw, [[http://www.sudtipos.com/home|this]] is a great place
    to look for beautiful script faces.  \r\n\r\n\r\n----\r\nArun\r\n----"

  body: "thanks again for all your help with this folks, its much appreciated. Had
    a look at stone informal poms,  though think they have an idea of a handwritten
    tagline along the base of the logo but will do them a Stone Informal version to
    see what they think, meanwhile gonna check out some more script faces.\r\n\r\nPaul"
