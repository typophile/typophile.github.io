body: "Hello there. Ok, so this is a new logo for an Islamic TV station. The name
  in English is Qubaa (which is a reference to the first mosque built in Islam). After
  going through a number of different iterations, the client chose a Kufic script
  (like the one in the first image), which I fine-tuned into what became the fourth
  image. The client requested that I transform the first letter, the \"qaf\", into
  the Dome of the Rock, the Medinah mosque dome, as well as the Kaaba (in Makkah)
  respectively. The reason for this is because these three sites are the holiest in
  Islam. I abstracted them and added them instead of the first letter, but kept the
  two dots of the letter qaf above each symbol to retain a certain degree of legibility.
  I also changed the \"alef\" letter in the logo because it kind of looks like the
  mi'thanah (the tall structure you usually find in  mosques). The point of these
  three versions, according to the client, is to have the logo change every 10-15
  seconds when on-air. As far as Latin typography is concerned, I decided to go with
  H&FJ's Verlag (different treatments are in image 6).\r\n\r\nMy questions:\r\n- What
  is your first impression?\r\n- What do you think of the abstraction (and the degree
  of abstraction) of the symbols of the three images (in picture 5)?\r\n- What do
  you think of the colored versions (very amateurish work, I know--I kind of like
  the white-only versions) and what direction do you propose as far as the colored
  versions are concerned? Do you have examples of existing logos that might have a
  fitting coloring style for what I am doing? Do you think I should go 3d on it?\r\n-
  What do you think of the Latin font choice and type treatment?\r\n\r\nIf you have
  any other criticisms or points to make, feel free to share."
