<p>Thus saith Nick Shinn.</p>
<p>@Nick
Were you meaning that as in &ldquo;Boy, those proportional oldstyles, they sure are old-fashioned. But they look pretty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>or</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Scotch Modern didn&rsquo;t originally have proportional oldstyle figures, but I figured, &lsquo;what the hey, I like them, so why not&rsquo;&rdquo;?</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Scotch Modern is a close revival of a &ldquo;Modern&rdquo; (Didone) face of the 19th century.
Such faces never had oldstyle figures, then or until now, AFAIK.
Therefore it is anachronistic, not to mention ironic, to include oldstyle figures in a modern face!</p>
<p>However, Adobe made me do it. 
By including &ldquo;Proportional Oldstyle&rdquo; and &ldquo;Tabular Oldstyle&rdquo; as non-bracketed options in the InDesign OpenType menu, it appears that there is an error in OpenType fonts that don&rsquo;t have oldstyle figures. (This is strange, not to mention ironic, as Adobe&rsquo;s own Trajan is without OSF.)
Therefore, to avoid looking like there is a mistake in the typeface, I decided to produce oldstyle modern figures for Scotch Modern. Or perhaps they are modern oldstyle figures. Other than massaging the proportions, the only structural change from the lining figures is the removal of the foot serifs on 4.</p>
<p>At any rate, they work surprisingly well, and are quite interesting. In fact, Michaël Amzalag uses them pointedly, and copiously, in his <em>Interview</em> redesign, e.g.&ndash;

		<div class="commentbody">Simon, when did Australian printing kick up in earnest? I&rsquo;m guessing that it must have been somewhere in the mid-1800s, right? With imported type? Depending on the dates, you might be able to find plenty of neat locals things printed in faces like this. Perhaps that might give you a hint as to how you might use fonts inspired by it today…</div>

<p>Don’t let the rubbish from type textbooks scare you away from using high-contrast types. As Nick likes to point out, such types were the most popular types in use during the time when widespread literacy came into being, and they don’t seem to have held readers back. And back then they were being printed at smaller sizes, on crap paper, and often read under lighting conditions we would consider abominable. There’s no reason that a well-used transitional or modern face cannot be every bit as readable as an aldine, and the pedants who insist otherwise should be treated with suspicion. A few days ago I examined one of Baskerville’s original printings of Paradise Lost, and I assure you it is more readable (long s usage aside) than some of the best versions being printed today!</p>

<p>Well… back then, there was ink spread, since the pages were still being printed from metal type. Nick&rsquo;s fonts asde, many digital Didones are not optimised successfully for text. And it does not matter what your abilities as a type setter are… if the font isn&rsquo;t going to cut it, you aren&rsquo;t going to be able to pull off legible text with it. Every typeface has to be judged on its own merits. Styles are genres are only going to help you so far along when it comes to knowing what to do with a font.</p>

<p>I disagree with you, James, that high contrast is equally readable in text. I really think it is objectively a problem. I can&rsquo;t prove it, but that&rsquo;s what my eyes have told me all my life.</p>
<p>I do agree, though, about the old style numerals. Nick, in the discussion about ITC Franklin, James argued that old style numerals won&rsquo;t work well with faces with very short extenders, including ITC Franklin.</p>

<p>You&rsquo;re contradicting yourself.</p>
<p>However, I have had the same view of high contrast faces, having tried various fonts in text settings from the 1970s on (for offset printed work), and always been disappointed with the results, in comparison with letterpress examples.</p>
<p>I surmised that the genre is not ideally suited to offset, and also that the phototype and digital fonts available were lacking.
So I thought I&rsquo;d have a go, hence Scotch Modern. Even if I have been successful, it is still a difficult genre to use for typographers, as optical size, paper stock and ink gain are so critical. Added to which is the prejudice which exists against it.</p>

<p>Letter press has a built-in minimum for thins, and so has a kind of built-in optical adjustment, so you may be right that they worked significantly better as letter press.</p>
<p>My prejudice against them for text arose when I was a student in high school and college in the early &rsquo;60s, when almost all science books were in high contrast modern faces, on slick paper. [They had bigger character sets for math, I&rsquo;m guessing.]</p>
<p>They have a lot of flavor in display, and yours captures that well.</p>
<p>With less contrast, they can work in text, though they are still not my favorite, though that, I admit, is subjective.</p>

<p>Bill, you offered your own experience, which is by definition subjective, as an argument against the idea that high contrast types are in general &ldquo;equally readable&rdquo;.</p>
<p>The problem with high contrast types is not the contrast per se, but rather it&rsquo;s the too slight image of fine details, in particular serifs, in offset printing. So one might say that the difficulty in offset is actually the <strong>low</strong> contrast between paper and fine details. This is not an issue in letterpress, because even the slightest of serifs are substantial enough: on uncoated stock there is sufficient press gain, and on coated stock there is the bite of type into the paper, creating a crisp dimensional image.</p>

<p>On objectivity, I am not basing myself only on my eyes, but also history. The high contrast types of the 19th century went into eclipse. I believe that almost all popular text faces now have lower contrast than things like Bodoni, Didot, and the 19th century Scotch romans. I haven&rsquo;t studied the 19th century stuff in letter press, so I may be wrong, but my impression is that things like Century, Miller Text, and Chronicle all have lower contrast than the 19th century stuff. I suspect that this history indicates an underlying reality about the physiology and psychology of how we read.  So I don&rsquo;t think the &ldquo;prejudice&rdquo; is just prejudice, but rather a well founded belief that such high contrast, vertical stress stuff is a problem for the eye in extended text.</p>

I have, however, seen others from the 19th century are much worse. As I said my complaint is high contrast with vertical stress, and this, as printed isn&rsquo;t such high contrast.</p>
<p>As to the tight leading, I think that people today have a fashion of thinking that huge leading contributes to readability, less so than it actually does.</p>
<p>So you see my views aren&rsquo;t just a matter of going along with what&rsquo;s happening today.</p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<p>No, I&rsquo;m not dismissing anything. I&rsquo;m expressing a well considered opinion, which may none the less be wrong, that vertical stress with high contrast is less readable in extended text. And judging by what most folks have done in designing fonts and setting text for over a hundred years, most agree with me.</p>

Are they hard to read? Well, no, not really, once you get into them, but on the other hand I don&rsquo;t think they&rsquo;re as easy to read as most 20th century publishing using lower contrast types based on renaissance models.</div>

<p>I don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s true.
Sure, there was a revival of old-style types starting in the 1890s, but it took a long time for the Modern faces to be eclipsed.</p>
<p>I just had a look at a couple of Linotype catalogs, 1923 and 1958, and most of the typefaces in them are high contrast with vertical stress &ndash; including those named Old Style!</p>
<p>Pick any year in the 1950s or 60s and check the text type of the large circulation American magazines&ndash;you&rsquo;ll have a hard job finding anything that isn&rsquo;t high contrast and vertically stressed.</p>
<p>Even in news type, following the introduction of the Legibility Series in the 1920s, one still finds the old numbered Moderns being well used in the 1950s and 60s.</p>

To be followed by many other Goudy oldstyles.</p>
<p>From ATF and Benton, as Dan says, Centaur, but also Garamond (1919)
From Monotype: Imprint, Plantin, Caslon (recut) in the &lsquo;teens.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Caslon was first revived in 1844 with &ldquo;Lady Willoughby&rsquo;s Diary&rdquo;, with the original matrices, I think. It caused something of a stir because it was so much more readable than the &lsquo;Moderns&rsquo; that were then fashionable :)  Updike, who admittedly was a Caslon fanatic, said the revival was &ldquo;The typographic event of the mid-nineteenth century&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Following this, foundries gradually issued a lot of typefaces called &lsquo;old style&rsquo; based on Caslon, but with larger x-heights and I believe also less contrast. According to Mac McGrew&rsquo;s book, Bruce Old Style originated in 1869, Binny Old Style around 1863, and Bookman Old Style originates in 1860. Caslon itself was revived in the US supposedly from English electroplates at about the same time, also under the name &lsquo;Old Style&rsquo;. Later in the century they put the name Caslon back on it, and with hot metal type every foundry had versions of both Caslon and &ldquo;Old Style&rdquo;, often with shortened descenders. One of the most refined of the higher x-height revivals was Imprint, which I think you can still see used occasionally.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know, but I would guess from the 1860s on you will see a lot of &lsquo;old styles&rsquo; in print. The peak of the craze for Caslon was probably 1900 to 1925. After the Bembo and Garamond were revived, it lost some of its mystique as there were other good and refined old style revivals available, as well as the new stuff from Goudy, which was very popular also in the US. Today I sense we are about due for a new Caslon craze :)</p>
<p>By the way, I think the Scotch style, such as Nick has revived, in my eyes was never as problematic in text as the real Didones, which have more starved horizontals.</p>

<p>Lady Willoughby&rsquo;s Diary was influential, but the idea that it was &ldquo;so much more readable&rdquo; is a non sequitur. 
In fact, the revival was found wanting, and what grew out of it and did become popular, the Miller and Richard &ldquo;Old Style&rdquo; was, to all intents and purposes, a modern face, with high contrast and vertical stress! The same is true of the other &ldquo;Old Styles&rdquo; you mention.
So don&rsquo;t be mislead by the term &ldquo;Old Style&rdquo; as it was used prior to the more authentic revivalism of the 20th century, that was sparked by Morris' work in the late 1890s.</p>
<p>Updike was extremely prejudiced against the trade typography of the 19th century, omitting it from his history (e.g. he shows no sans), so hardly a reliable source as to what was significant then.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Nick, unlike your scan of Scotch, I find that Didot pretty bad as far as readability. The weight of the stem in the Scotch is carried much further into the top arch, compared to Didot and Bodoni, where the horizontal arch is thinner throughout.</p>
<p>The result to my eyes is that there is a lot of shimmer from the &lsquo;picket fence&rsquo; effect in your scan, because the heavy verticals are so dominant.</p>
<p>As far as the Old Style of Miller and Richard, here&rsquo;s what Jaspert&rsquo;s encyclopedia says: &ldquo;The stress is vertical, but though not abruptly so. Note the curves of the c, e, and p.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Remember that Caslon&rsquo;s o has a vertical stress, as well as some of his caps in many sizes. The c, e, and p have a slight old style stress in the Monotype version of Old Style that Jaspert shows.</p>
<p>But the important point in that note is &ldquo;not abruptly so&rdquo;. The gentler modulation is the main thing they took from Caslon, and with it lower contrast. Judging by the many later versions of Old Style, you are mistaken in saying that Phemister&rsquo;s original Old Style for Miller &amp; Richard has high contrast. In fact, the low contrast and big x-height is overdone, in my opinion, in the &ldquo;Old Style&rdquo;, though it is very readable. (I don&rsquo;t have a sample of the original Miller &amp; Richard type.) My problem with the Old Style is an aesthetic one, namely that it is rather dull looking&ndash;something that certainly can&rsquo;t be said of the Scotches, including your revival.</p>
<p>I never said that vertical stress was a problem in itself. There are great text faces with vertical stress, like Caledonia&ndash;a modified Scotch. What I do think is that those with vertical stress are less tolerant of higher contrast&ndash;you can push diagonal contrast a little more without getting into trouble.</p>
<p>And in any case text type needs lower contrast, lower than in your scanned example immediately above, IMHO. Note that this issue also is not simply absolute thinness of the thins, but also how bold the stems are in relation to them. Here in your Didot scan the result is exactly the thing I have problems with in text. It is beautiful in display, but that is another story.</p>

You&rsquo;re right, the heavy verticals here do dominate.
I don&rsquo;t think the problem is in the &ldquo;important&rdquo; part of the letters, such as across the top of &ldquo;n&rdquo;. It&rsquo;s more that the serifs and terminals are weak&ndash;and that&rsquo;s where the Scotch beefed up the Modern style, with long serifs and big ball terminals.
If the serifs and terminals are strong, then I don&rsquo;t think the abruptness of the transition from thin to thick is an issue. Example of a Scotch Modern, 1872:

<p>Bill: <em> Judging by the many later versions of Old Style, you are mistaken in saying that Phemister’s original Old Style for Miller &amp; Richard has high contrast.</em></p>
<p>It depends how you define &ldquo;high contrast&rdquo;.
I certainly get the impression of high contrast from this Victorian oldstyle (below, from the same magazine as the previous sample), looking at the hairline thickness of the crossbar in &ldquo;a&rdquo;, horizontal strokes of &ldquo;b&rdquo; and &ldquo;d&rdquo;, and the thin strokes of &ldquo;w&rdquo; and &ldquo;y&rdquo;, but at the same time there is much less contrast in &ldquo;e&rdquo;, &ldquo;h&rdquo; and &ldquo;n&rdquo; and across the top of &ldquo;a&rdquo;.

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Nick, here&rsquo;s my take on your great comparative scans of Didot, Scotch, and Old Style.</p>
<p>The way the arches are handled is, I think, as I said. There is a lot of variability because of ink varying quite a lot from letter to letter, but if you look at the lighter branches, I think you can see that in general the weight is carried farthest through the arch in old style, less in Scotch, and still less in Didot. This is more obvious in the digital revivals of these, which are mainly based on the metal.</p>
<p>However, I have learned from your scans something I didn&rsquo;t realize before.</p>
<p>A lot in the difference in look is not only how thin the thins are, and the transitions, but also just in the weight of the thick vertical strokes. The contrast is the ratio of the thicks to the thins and a lot of that here is that in Didot the thicks are thicker, say in relation to the x-height of the letters. The Scotch is lighter, and the Old Style a lot lighter. Thus a lot of the reduction in contrast from Didot to Scotch to OldStyle is lightening the stems.</p>
<p>The net result is a striking difference in typographic &lsquo;color&rsquo; in the three faces, with the heavy verticals punching you in the face, so to speak, in Didot. As you point out, interestingly, the heavier serifs in the Scotch does help relieve this, as well as lighter stems. The OldStyle dramatically changes it, giving a more open, lacy effect, but perhaps a bit too grey.</p>
