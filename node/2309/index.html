<div class="post-content e-content" itemprop=articleBody>Anyone here have any experience with MS' WEFT 3? My studio is redoing our web site and we want to be able to have greater control over the typography than just spec'ing Veranda. <br> <br>I did a search of the other threads and see WEFT mentioned, but no real info on it here. I would like to get a pro's and con's ...etc. <br> <br>Thanks!</div>

<div class=commentbody>Try searching the MS Typography site - it has gobs of stuff. <br> <br>But do beware two issues: <br>1) Browser/OS compatibility. <br>2) The apparent ease of swiping such embedded fonts. <br> <br>hhp <br></div>

<div class=commentbody>Thanks Hrant, <br> <br>I did do all the reading on the site. It was informative ... but I am a little cynical, as MS is the Great Satan. I was hoping some here have had some experience with WEFT and would be willing to share. <br> <br>I saw an earlier thread that you took part in that talked about the ease of swiping embedded fonts. That would be a conscern. <br> <br>I think our problem is as a design studio that designs mainly for print we are having trouble thinking in terms of type variables that you get with the web. <br> <br>I understand and accept it, but the designer that I am working with to create our site feels funny about not controling certain aspects of the user's interface, such as the type choice and treatment. <br> <br>One of the things I do not like about WEFt is that it is not cross platform or cross browser. So, even though you may be able to control the type on PC's using IE, you still ahve to account for NS and Mac's and thus you are back to the basic considerations with web design that you are trying to eliminate. <br> <br>Does not seem worth it, really. If it were up to me I would spec Ariel and move on ... <br> <br>;)</div>

<div class=commentbody>Erm, I'm no web guru - in fact I know little to nothing obviously - but WEFT didn't work so well for me. That is, it works fine if your end user is on a PC with Explorer 5 or above, but not at all if they're on a Mac. <br> <br>Feel free to check out {<a href=http://www.eightyproof.com target=_blank>www.eightyproof.com</a>, my site} & see the atrocity. On a Mac <i>none</i> of the text shows up. Though it looks fine on every PC I've seen it on. <br> <br>My apologies if your screen resolution is above 1024 x 768. Joe Clark would probably hunt me down if he ever saw such a thing.</div>

<div class=commentbody>I haven't really put much work into making my site function - I'm hoping over winter break I'll have time - but I'm not sure how I'll work around it. I'm also an idiot when it comes to coding. This site is the only site I've coded, and I taught myself everything I know about CSS, HTML, and JavaScript. Which is not much. But... <br> <br>I thought I could call up different CSS based on the OS/browser of my user. But WEFT writes the style declarations for font substitutions in the .html documents themselves - not the CSS. So I don't think using different style sheets will work. <br> <br>The release notes for WEFT say that the font tag doesn't work in MacIE4.5, but CSS declarations do. I tried the work around suggested in the release notes, but could never get it to work. <br> <br>Like I said though, I've done very little in the way of fixing anything. But I've never once seen the text on my site on a Mac. And I had mucho problemo with Netscape Navigator. <br> <br>Sorry this doesn't help much.</div>

<div class=commentbody>One big problem I've found with WEFT (other than the fact that it won't work on anything other than IE) is that, even if you have ClearType turned on, the embedded type won't anti-alias, which looks like crap most of the time. <br> <br>Nathan: you could always move the styles in the .html to a .css file and then call it depending on the user's browser. And font tags are deprecated anyways - there's simply no need to use them anymore.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Maybe they fixed it, then. I've only tried it one time, prior to discovering it only worked on IE, and embedded fonts wouldn't antialias. <br>My mistake, then. <br> <br>I still think, though, that WEFT will only be ready for prime time once it works under Mozilla.</div>

<div class=commentbody>I think WEFT is a fundamentally cool technology, which the MS Typography folks came up with, and the rest of MS is not that interested in. <br> <br>Support for WEFT has gone *down* over time, as it was once supported in the Mac version of IE. If MS as a company were at all serious about it, WEFT would have gotten built-in authoring support in Microsoft FrontPage. <br> <br>Darn shame. Some well-supported sort of font embedding for the Web would be a Good Thing. <br> <br>T</div>

<div class=commentbody>> This WEFT tutorial site renders nice and smooth for me <br> <br>On my end it renders smooth when CT is turned on, but 1-bit when CT is off. I wonder if it's a GASP issue, since the larger Times text in the boxes does render smooth no matter if CT is on or off. <br> <br>If the issue is the GASP settings, then it's really a matter of making sure the font is hinted well if you're using the range of sizes where smoothing is off (assuming CT is off). So it's not the technology's fault, more like a combined limtation of the hinting in a given font design and the font rendering algorithm in Windows (which is however the best out there, except maybe the Kaasila stuff). <br> <br>I need to do more testing. <br> <br>BTW, what do you guys know about security: how easy it is to extract a font from an EOT/WEFT page? Is it like PDF, harder, or easier? <br> <br>hhp <br></div>

<div class=commentbody>I've never tried extracting from an EOT. I know it is not simply a re-suffixed TTF file, but beyond that I don't know. Thomas has indicated that it is easier than extracting from a PDF. I find it hard to believe that anything could be easier than extracting from PDF <i>used to be</i>, but Acrobat's protection of embedded fonts seems to have improved considerably in recent versions.</div>

<div class=commentbody>>>Either your designer needs to learn to adapt to the context, or you need to find a web designer to design for the web. <br> <br> <br>Couldn't agree more. The wish to "control" what people see on the internet is - at best - outdated, naive and quaintly megalomaniac, however it also betrays a serious misconception of the medium that is being designed for. In short: You can't control it and neither can I, so get over it and move on, before more valuable resources are wasted on solving the unsolvable. <br> <br>The web is about the exchange of information, period. It is currently not a very suitable medium for the display of typographic integrity, whether that suits any of us or not (and yes, of course I *do* agree that current options for web typography are lamentable, limited and unsatisfactory, ). <br> <br>Flash, while fun and (typo-)graphically more fulfilling than HTML, suffers from serious usability problems, not the least of which is the failure of SearchEngines to index Flash content in a satisfactory manner, so if that is important to you, you may have to settle for Arial after all. Of course you could go out on a limb and use Verdana instead... <img src=http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif alt=:-) border=0></div>

But I think that its largely because people have more idea now that they can't have everything they want and still have 100% compatibility without paying a small fortune.* <br>About 4 or 5 years ago I wroe a cross plaform function library for DHTML - it was a learning experience as much as anything, which is fortunate, because not long after that new releases of Netscape and IE made it redundant.

There are so many browsers today that unless you really take care to fully test your script in all the browsers and be sure to keep it up to date to reflect changes in all the browsers, you'll block a chunk of people from seeing your site. <br> <br>There are still plenty of badly built sites out there that still assume the only two browsers are IE5 and NN4. Ugh. <br> <br>The best advice for designing for the web is to realize that the most you can is 'suggest' a visual presentation. You can't/shouldn't mandate it. <br> <br>But don't spec arial. yech. ;o) <br> <br>GlyphGate, I think, is just a browser detection system that then throws out embedded faces if it can. A lot of money for little benefit, IMHO.</div>

<div class=commentbody><blockquote> quoth <b>Hrant</b>: <br>What about using Flash?</blockquote>If your site has more than very short snippets of text, please don't. Flash is lovely for animation, getting better for GUI development and can be just the ticket for rendering vector artwork. It is, however, an abominable means of displaying even modest amounts of text. <br> <br>Any advantages Flash lends in terms of aesthetics (and at text sizes there are few) are overbalanced by loss of convenience unless you go to the trouble of ensuring that scroll wheels, keyboard accelerators and the like all work in your movie--something I have not seen done. I recently read through the Flash-based tutorials on this site and the experience was not pleasant. The type was too small for comfort on my screen (17" LCD at 1280 x 1024) and could not be adjusted, the antialiasing was appallingly bad, the lack of a history function (back/forward buttons) was frustrating and rendering speed was markedly inferior to HTML. <br> <br>Flash design (which is image-centric) should not be confused with web design (which is text-centric). The two aren't identical, nor even all that close in many respects. <br> <br><blockquote> sayeth <b>steve paxton</b>: <br>Non IE browsers account for around 6% now, and Macs are way behind that - people can't see the point of going to great expense to accomodate such minorities.</blockquote>I'd be a bit leery of drawing an serious conclusions based on general statistics. As one example, the <a href=http://www.google.com/press/zeitgeist.html> Google Zeitgeist</a> puts MacOS at 3% of web share while <a href=http://www.onestat.com/html/aboutus_pressbox24.html> OneStat</a> puts it at 1.49% and <a href=http://www.thecounter.com/stats/2003/May/os.php> TheCounter</a> splits the difference at 2%. That's quite a swing--Google claims twice the proportion of Mac users that StatMarket does. <a href=http://www.upsdell.com/BrowserNews/stat.htm#source2> Upsdell's Browser News</a> demonstrates nicely just how radically browser share can vary from site to site and also explains why statistics purporting to reflect the entire web audience should be taken with a grain of salt. <br> <br>In addition, strict market share does not tell the entire story. Historically, Mac users have skewed more educated, more affluent and more willing to purchase online than Windows users. So although Mac users make up only a tiny fraction of the total audience, they may make up a much larger portion of the audience that will actually buy whatever it is you are selling. To my knowledge, there is no research on the demographics of browser users, but it is entirely possible that users of minority browsers may likewise be more desirable than their sheer numbers indicate. <br> <br>There are really just too many factors involved for general stats like these to be taken too seriously. <br> <br>Besides, IE as a standalone browser is dead. MS has gone on record saying that no further standalone versions will be released for Windows or Mac, and the primary driver of IE/Mac, Tantek </div>

<div class=commentbody><blockquote>revealed <b>Refusenik</b>: <br>While checking out the Microsoft Typography site, I came across <a href=http://www.glyphgate.com/info/index.html>GlyphGate</a>, a server-side application that claims to offer a cross-platform solution to the limitations of web typography.</blockquote>I'm with darrel on this one regarding cost/benefit. It may engage in some tricky sniffing to determine browser capabilities, but as a practical matter there is no way to support <b>every</b> browser out there as this product claims. Just off the top of my head, one would have to test it with all released versions of Trident (IE 4+/Win rendering engine), Tasman (IE 5+/Mac), Seamonkey (NN4.x), Gecko (Mozilla, Netscape 6+, Camino, Firebird, Galeon, etc.), Opera and KHTML (Safari, Konqueror and OmniWeb 4.6+), to say nothing of such obscure rendering engines as iCab and OmniWeb (pre-4.6), older rendering engines used by the aforementioned browsers (such as IE 3, NN 3, etc.) or browsers for the Danger hiptop, PalmOS, the Symbian OS, etc. <br> <br>From the FAQ: <br><blockquote><b>Q:</b> What is Server Gated CSS Level 2? <br> <br><b>A:</b> The ability to publish a web page containing CSS Level 2 formatting to a server and view that page faithfully in a browser without CSS support. <br> <br>... <br> <br><b>Q:</b> What browsers are supported by GlyphGate? <br> <br><b>A:</b> All browsers are supported, at varying levels. Text of any language, any font, any color and any style is presented equally well in all browsers. Other types of formatting, such as border styles and margins, may or may not be supported by all browsers.</blockquote>So they plainly state that it doesn't do quite what they claim: CSS2 layouts are <i>not</i> magically viewable on non-CSS2 browsers. <br><blockquote><b>Q:</b> How are browsers without support for "embedded fonts" handled? <br> <br><b>A:</b> Even browsers that do not support font embedding are fully supported. Web pages are partially formatted on the server and text set in non-standard fonts are transmitted as images to these browsers.</blockquote> So it just sets your text as images in Mozilla, Safari, Netscape 6 (the 'Navigator' name only applies to Netscape versions prior to 6) et al. <br> <br>I would also add that I'd be leery if this thing served embedded fonts to NN4.x. I've heard nothing but horror stories from those who have tried to use the Bistream embedding technology in that browser--as in 'every page with an embedded font crashed the browser' kind of horror. <br> <br>Net-net, this product may be beneficial if you're serving sites using Thai or Arabic or some other script that is poorly supported in most browser/OS combos. It is not, however, a means of ensuring that 'every' visitor will see the layout/fonts you choose. <br> <br> </div>

<div class=commentbody><blockquote>opined <b>steve paxton</b>: <br>Well, I think that's a highly dubious statement anyway given Netscape's buggines in terms of actually working ;)</blockquote> Which version? NN4.x is an unholy mess, to be sure, and Netscape versions prior to 6.2 were beta-quality at best. However, I've been using Mozilla (the same 'guts' as NS, just without the AOL adware) since 0.9.4 and it's quite stable and acceptably fast. In fact, my SO uses Moz 1.0 on a 6-year-old Dell PII 266/160 MB and is quite happy with it. <br> <br>Firebird on OS X has been a bit dodgier, but I've been using it on my Win2K laptop since the Phoenix days with nary a problem and speed-wise it's comparable to IE or even Opera. <br> <br>And of course there's always the little matter of <a href="http://slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=03/11/29/1353243">security</a>. <br><blockquote>further posited <b>steve</b>: <br>But that still takes longer than developing for just one browser, and testing is a much longer process. Unless you want to stick to really basic stuff (which is a good strategy, but one many clients don't want to know about).</blockquote> It takes a bit longer, yes, but once you relegate NN4.x to the 'gets basic content + functionality' category it isn't so bad. In fact, if IE/Win were even as capable as IE 5+/Mac WRT CSS testing expense would be negligible. With the exception of heavy use of frames (generally a Bad Idea anyway) or hairy DHTML I find that pages tend to work first time out in Gecko-based browsers (Moz, Netscape, etc.), Safari, Opera 7 and IE 5+/Mac. Opera 5/6 typically boosts time by maybe 10% or so, IE/Win by 10-30% depending on what you're trying to do. <br> <br>It also matters what you mean by 'support'. If you're still locked into thinking that the pages must look pixel-perfect across browsers (which it doesn't seem you are), supporting multiple browsers can be a PITA. If you realize that pixel-perfection is a fool's errand, things get easier in a hurry. With a little practice, methodology like Steve Champeon's '<a href="http://hotwired.lycos.com/webmonkey/03/21/index3a.html?tw=design"> progressive enhancement</a>' makes supporting multiple browsers relatively painless. <br><blockquote>observed <b>steve</b>: <br>Hey, so the real figure could be as much as even maybe 4 or 6% at a push. I can't imagine any client not wanting to throw money at that market sector.</blockquote> I assume you're being sarcastic, but there are in fact sites that <i>do</i> take that percentage seriously. The creative director at the <i><a href=http://www.economist.com>Economist</a></i> is a regular over at <a href=http://www.webdesign-l.com>WD-L</a> and has explained many times that given their traffic levels, even 3-4% of their audience is large enough to warrant attention. <br> <br>Even if it weren't, it isn't like we're talking about breaking the bank. It's mostly a matter of not doing things that are actively hostile to non-Windows or non-IE browsers (document.all and such) and not browser sniffing and locking non-Windows browsers out. <br></div>

<div class=commentbody><blockquote>queried <b>steve</b>: <br>Hmmm, interesting.

I can't vouch for their methodology as I didn't purchase the whole report, but generally they survey a scientifically-selected sample. Selecting the sample for statistical validity is itself an improvement over the typical general-interest web stats, which are usually compiled by a web log analysis outsourcing firm based on users visiting their client's sites. Those users may or may not be representative of the web as a whole. <br><blockquote>qualified <b>steve</b>: <br>Well there are a few assumptions there. <br>1.

That I, or my client, has something for sale.</blockquote> I don't know very many clients who don't. :-) <br> <br>The big exceptions would be publication sites, which as I said tend to take an 'every last eyeball counts' approach, and government/education sites. In the U.S., U.K. and Germany, at least, the latter are covered by accessiblity laws that make the whole discussion moot. <br><blockquote>3. That Mac users are the kind of people that want my clients product.</blockquote> Yes, which is why I used 'may' rather than 'are'. :-) <br><blockquote>I'm not sure what you mean by 'much larger', but it seems unlikely that a group which consists of roughly 3% of the total is going to contribute a 'much larger' contingent in any subset - unless I'm selling Mac software of course.</blockquote> Well...say the Mac users account for just 6% of potential customers (those who would buy if they could). 6% doesn't sound like much, but boosting sales by 6% isn't something most companies would sneeze at. Wall Street tends to like that sort of growth, anyway, particularly when it comes with relatively little expenditure. <br> <br>Remember that web site construction is typically a relatively small percentage of a company's costs. Even for an outfit like Amazon, which has no bricks-and-mortar stores, the biggest costs for them are inventory, shipping and so on, not the construction of the site itself. <br> <br>Besides, what does being IE-only <i>really</i> get you in most cases? Some whizzy DHTML or other? Prettier text? Is there any research indicating that those things will add even 3% to total sales? Most of the big gains come from improving navigation, reducing page load time and the like</div>

<div class=commentbody><blockquote>asserted <b>Hrant H Papazian</b>: <br>Sure it costs more to do a two-tier solution*, and usually the expense is hard to justify, but I think it's not any harder than justifying good design in the first place.</blockquote> Except the cost of a two-tier solution is deceptively high. It isn't just initial construction that is more expensive, it's maintenance too. <br> <br>Even assuming the content is stored in a database and combined with templates at request- or publish-time, every time you want to redesign something on the site, add some new functionality or alter the structure (adding a new section/subsection, for example) you've got to do it twice. You've also got twice as much (OK, probably more like 140-170% as much, but still) code where things can go wrong. <br> <br>You're also setting up a false dichotomy here: neither IE/Win nor 'everything else' is monolithic. IE 5 &lt;> IE 5.5 &lt;> IE 6. They're closer in many respects than, say, IE 5/Win and IE 5/Mac, but the differences are still significant enough to warrant testing. So you're testing regardless. Likewise, 'everything else' includes everything from Mozilla to PocketIE on a cell phone. Those browsers have vastly different capabilities. Either you need to serve them straight-up HTML 2.0 (no tables, no CSS, no JavaScript, etc.) or you're back to testing and 'progressive enhancement' again. <br> <br>And then, of course, there's the question of what, exactly, is 'good design' in the first place. Is it really 'good' to take an approach contrary to the fundamental purpose of the medium (non-discriminatory access to information)? <br><blockquote>analogized <b>Hrant</b>: <br>The web is like a pet: you can't control it totally, but you can train it a lot with the right pragmatic and "humane" attitude - you don't have to let it run wild.</blockquote> I disagree slightly: the web is more like a child than a pet; you can <i>try</i> to instill the right values in it, but in the end it leaves you and goes into the broader word where it is entirely beyond your conrol. <br> <br>Remember how the web works: when you go to a site, you aren't looking at something that lives somewhere else, you're looking at a copy of that something that has been made on your local HD, complete with source code. Once that copy hits the user's browser, all bets are off. They can resize the text. They can zoom the whole page. They can turn off JavaScript, plugins, images and CSS. They can even gasp use their <i>own</i> stylesheets with 18px/18px Comic Sans if they so choose. <br> <br>As a wise man once said "the control you have is proportional to the control you relinquish." <br> <br>Indeed. <br> <br></div>

<div class=commentbody>OK ... Awesome responses! Thanks all. <br> <br>First, Hrant, about Flash. We want to avoid it for content. We are cool using it for some simple navagation, but we want to keep the site content in HTML to make it easy to search and easy to update. <br> <br>Second, as to the designer I am working with - well he is prez of our studio and cut his teeth in print. I agree that he should just get over the control issue, but with everything, life is never that simple. I am moving him toward the right mindset for this project, but I can't just make demands here. Sigh. <br> <br>I think WEFT is a cool idea, but not worth the effort. If we still have to account for variations in text we might as well just go simple and worry about other aspects of the site.</div>

<div class=commentbody><blockquote>postulated <b>Hrant H Papazian</b>: <br>I really think all that's missing is a nice third-party licensable (or included in Flash) infrastructure, or "engine", where you could just dump in the text in, choose some parameters (like size, line length, etc.) and the textual navigation would pop up looking and working great. I think somebody actually made something like this in Java - in fact I think it was Bitstream.</blockquote> I have concerns about licencing a text display widget in an era when web sites with budgets in excess of US$5-10K are few and far between. I don't see it getting used much, to be honest. <br> <br>That aside, your theory here sounds a little like the old /. joke: <ol><li>Develop widget <li>??? <li>Profit!</li></ol>What we've got here is the dreaded SMOP (Simple Matter Of Programming), which as most developers will tell you is often anything but simple. <br> <br>I probably spend as much time reading on-screen as anyone (often 8-12 hrs./day), but I really don't like it as much as old-fashioned dead-tree text. The reasons are fairly obvious: <ol><li>limited layout options <li>limited font choices <li>can't as easily see where one is in the text <li>you typically see less text at a time, so scanning about the page requires scrolling rather than just moving one's eyes <li>mousing + clicking is slower and clumsier than thumbing for moving back and forth to reread, compare and contrast <li>cannot hilight passages <li>relative discomfort of viewing emissive vs. reflective media for extended periods <li>being tethered to a desk or a laptop (the latter isn't as handy as a book, not even the thin'n'light varieties) <li>cannot dogear pages <li>redraw times are infinitely greater online (books have none) <li>high entry cost (price of a computer + 'Net connection vs. price of a book/magazine) <li>poor text rendering</li></ol> The unique advantages of online text balance the equation for short- to medium-length texts: <ol><li>Low incremental cost (even paid sites are typically cheaper than a magazine subscription) <li>Easy storage (a hard drive is smaller and holds a lot more than a bookshelf) <li>Portability (a laptop is easier to carry than a library) <li>Ubiquity (easier to find a phone jack or wireless hotspot than to find an adequate library/bookstore in many areas) <li>Automatic updates <li>Ease of copying <li>Internal searchability (the 'find' command) <li>External searchability (search engines like Google) <li>Easy cross-referencing (copy/paste into Google, M-W.com, etc.)</li></ol> There are also a few things that a browser does to mitigate the disadvantages of online reading: <ol><li>ability to resize text (text/page zoom) <li>proportional scrollbars <li>scroll wheel/arrow keys for moving around a page <li>keyboard accelerators for forward/back, links, etc. <li>bookmarks <li>ability reflow text (changing browser width)</li></ol> <br>Now, going through the disadvantages of online text, which ones does Flash address? Flash allows better layout control (point one) and a far wider selection of fonts (point two). Two points for Flash. <br> <br>Flash neither hurts nor helps with respect to points 3-9. No score. <br> <br>However, Flash does hurt us with respect to point 10: OS + Browser is always going to be faster than OS + Browser + Flash. Flash imposes <i>some</i> overhead, no way around it. Likewise, one needs a newer, more powerful computer to have an acceptable experience browsing a Flash page than browsing HTML, so it hurts again on point 11. On point 12, Flash's rendering of small text is notably inferior to OS X's native rendering, and I'll take your word that WinXP's antialiasing is better than OS X's, so Flash looses this one. Score 3 for HTML. <br> <br>Now let's look at the advantages of online text. Flash has no effect whatever on points 1-4, so those are a draw. <br> <br>Assuming proper authoring, updates in Flash can be more or less as simple as updating HTML (the text needs to be drawn in from a file on the server or similar), so we'll give it point 5. Likewise, it's possible to save an .swf file to your HD just as you can an HTML page, so point 6 is a draw as well. I have never seen any implementation of a 'find' command in Flash, but it shouldn't be <i>that</i> difficult to implement, so we'll give it point 7 as well. Point 8, external searchability, is a well-known problem with Flash. Theoretically, at least, one could include the text in a 'hidden' &lt;div> or similar to enable searching so I'll give you that point, too. Likewise, I've never met a Flash page that allowed me to copy a text snippet, but IIRC there is a particular sort of text that can be used (the name escapes me) that makes the text editable, and that text could allow copy/paste, so I'll concede point 9. Another draw, but only after an awful lot of hand-waving. <br> <br>Last, we'll look at the things browsers do to mitigate the problems with online text. Flash allows users to zoom, and we'll concede that your widget gives us proportional scroll bars, scroll wheel/arrow keys and keyboard accelerators. No score. <br> <br>Bookmarking is another well-known problem with Flash, but we'll wave our hands some more and say each page could be a separate movie or that there is some mechanism for bookmarking within a Flash movie of which I am unaware. So a draw on point 5. <br> <br>On point 6, Flash zooms to fit the screen, but doesn't reflow. If for whatever reason I've got a narrower display area than you anticipate, I'm screwed. Still, there may be a way to automagically determine the width of a Flash movie and reflow the text to accommodate it. Let's wave our hands and call it a draw. <br> <br>Final score: Flash 2, HTML 3, and *lots* of hand waving going on to get there. Notably, I haven't used Flash since v. 5 so I'm just assuming that there is some way to get a movie's dimensions at run time and that the editable text cast member can use an arbitrary font that isn't installed on the end user's system (my recollection is that it could not as of v. 5). Futher, to solve both the external searchability problem and the bookmarking problem we need to rely on techniques that will exacerbate the performance and entry-price problems. As well, I glossed over another issue: we need to license this widget, which means our costs for producing content go up, which in turn means incremental costs (cost per new page of text) will probably need to reflect that somewhat mitigating one of online text's advantages. <br> <br>Call me crazy, but it seems to me that right now, today, even with a whole lotta benefit of the doubt and assuming a widget that doesn't exist, Flash is still inferior to HTML for reading more than small bits of text. Seems to me efforts at improving online reading would be better focused on a base of HTML rather than on Flash. <br> <br></div>

<div class=commentbody><blockquote>sniped <b>Hrant H Papazian</b>: <br>So is hiring a designer. Just do it in-house! :-/</blockquote> <br>In 7+ years of web development I've never once gotten a call from an irate CEO at 11 p.m. on a Friday night saying a designer was preventing his mother-in-law from accessing the site with her iMac. I cannot say the same for browser-sniffing widgets. <br> <br>Perhaps you know a different sort of designer. <br><blockquote>As far as our clients ar concerned, the "fundamental purpose of the medium" is to make more money, so "good design" is merely what increases material wealth.</blockquote> Very good. Now, which is going to do more to increase material wealth: spending $X on browser testing to see that 3-8% more visitors get the branding, UI, etc. rather than a circa-1995 grey background'n'Times mess or spending $X on a two-tier system to ensure that IE/Win users get to see 12px-on-14px Bookman Old Style instead of 1em-on-1.2em Georgia? And what of the X% of Win/IE users who can't read that 12px-high text because they're near sighted? Or the Y% who decide to override your font choices just because they feel like it? Or the Z% of IE/Win users who have the contents of the page read to them via a screen reader and don't see that lovely type anyway (and won't get anything at all without non-trivial extra effort/expense if you're using Flash)? <br><blockquote>To me though it's about maximizing the cultural benefit of a tool, with a pragmatic -not a fundamentalist- mentality as to how to achieve that.</blockquote> And how does serving unstyled pages to everyone not using IE/WIn maximize 'cultural benefit'? <br> <br>If playing to the strengths of the medium is somehow 'fundamentalist', then pass the bible 'cause I'm in a thumpin' mood. <br> <br>Your approach is rather like trying to turn a pickup truck into a sports car. Yeah, you can hop up the motor, rework the suspension, add new breaks, wheels and tires...hell, you could slap the pickup body on a Corvette chassis if you like (I've seen it done), but at the end of the day what you have is a hopped-up pickup that will get spanked by a cheaper off-the-showroom-floor 'Vette at the racetrack and is far worse at hauling cargo, towing trailers or driving offroad than it was to start with. If what you want is a vehicle for hauling cargo that also has good road manners, you buy a BMW or Volvo station wagon. Maybe it won't quite run with the hotrod truck or the 'Vette, but it's cheaper and more utilitarian, not to mention more economical to own and maintain. <br> <br>Flash is the 'Vette, your two-tier solution is the hotrod truck and a browser-tested CSS solution is the wagon. <br> <br>Thing is, if you bother to learn CSS et all well, you can get 90%+ of the nifty presentation you would from your two-tier system out of a one-tier system that will be easier to maintain and expand, quicker to download, and more accessible to a wider audience to boot. <br> <br>Sounds pretty pragmatic to me. <br> <br></div>

<div class=commentbody>setmajer, it's great to see you've put a lot of thought into this stuff. <br> <br>> Flash's rendering of small text is notably inferior to OS X's native rendering <br> <br>Not really. Flash can render the highest form of text (handmade grayscale bitmaps) more reliably than MacOS (and even Windows) can.

<div class=commentbody>Just a quick update on font extraction from EOT: <br>After some asking around and some actual testing, it seems that it's not at all trivial to swipe fonts from an EOT page. Although the fonts are indeed saved as individual files in the browser's cache, there's no obvious way of making them work as fonts on their own. I guess it's possible to decipher (or swipe) the encryption MS seems to be using on the font files, and provide a utility to bring them back to TT (or PS), but I don't see anybody going to that trouble.

<div class=commentbody><blockquote>informed <b>Hrant H Papazian</b>: <br>Not really. Flash can render the highest form of text (handmade grayscale bitmaps) more reliably than MacOS (and even Windows) can.</blockquote> Is there an example somewhere? The tutorials on this site apparently do <i>not</i> use them, because the text looks like &#149;&#149;&#149;. <br> <br>Taking your word that they're noticeably better than native OS X/WinXP text at the designed size (it does make sense), how good are they if you zoom them in Flash? Better, worse or about the same as zoomed outline fonts? <br> <br>As well, we're adding to our incremental costs again, and I don't believe these greyscale bitmaps are in terribly wide use. <br> <br>Regardless, I'll give you the point with the caveat that there's some more hand-waving going on here. So it's still 2-2, even up, and lots of hand-waving to get there. <br><blockquote>Flash also has the advantage of allowing kerning - very important for onscreen readability (and legibility).</blockquote> Important, yes, but it's an incremental improvement. I'd vote for higher-resolution displays, reflective displays (for extended reading, at least) or even annotation/highlighting capabilities before I'd go after kerning. <br><blockquote>HTML doesn't kern (does it)?</blockquote> You mean hand-kerning? Not really. You can hack it by wrapping the problem pair in a &lt;span> and using the letter-spacing property to adjust the space, but it's crude and probably not worth the effort for anything other than an egregious headline boner (not that I expect many people take the time to hand-kern body copy even in print). Even there, given the differences in text rendering between platforms and unreliable fonts I'd say it would likely do more harm than good. <br> <br>If you mean automagic kerning based on the kerning pairs specified in the font, that would be an OS-level issue. Honestly, I don't know if OS X does or not as it's not terribly obvious which nasty pairs in the text above are due to lack of kerning and which are due to the coarse pixel grid. <br><blockquote>I'm not saying Flash is ready for prime-time in terms of extended reading, but I do think (not least by observing the wanton behavior of the OS/app makers) that it has more potential than HTML.</blockquote> Based on MM's progress so far? I don't know. They seem pretty focused on making Flash the app development platform Director could be but isn't (due to underpromotion as much as anything, really; it's far more capable than Flash as a programming environment). <br> <br>As well, there's SVG floating around out there. The SVG-RCC bit allows you to map arbitrary XML elements to an SVG display, which would <i>in theory</i> allow you to add vector fonts to XHTML elements. It's still at the Working Draft stage, though. <br> <br>And of course there's XAML, MS's Flash/SVG/HTML/DOM/CSS killer-to be. By the time Longhorn hits, &amp;deity; only knows what text will look like in that or where OS X text rendering will be. In principal, OS X uses display PDF, so there's really no reason it shouldn't have at least as much sophistication as Flash. <br><blockquote>Ah, but you've also not gotten calls from clients who decided never to contact you in the first place. That's my point.</blockquote> So you're talking wow-em portfolio showpieces? Sure, Flash allows some brilliant stuff in that area. No contest there. <br> <br>I'm talking production sites</div>

<div class=commentbody>> how good are they if you zoom them in Flash? <br> <br>Since pixelfonts (1-bit or grayscale) are built with funky outlines (to map to the screen pixels correctly), zooming destroys them. What you can do is detect the zoom level and sub another font that renders well at that magnification. But a user who zooms in isn't worried about readability (unless the Flash stuff is badly designed and the text is too small). <br> <br>> I don't believe these greyscale bitmaps are in terribly wide use. <br> <br>Because they're not available yet (at least not in a form most people would like to use). Yet. <br> <br>> I'd vote for higher-resolution displays, reflective displays (for extended reading, at <br>> least) or even annotation/highlighting capabilities before I'd go after kerning. <br> <br>Except those really are not available! <br>Kerning is available - just not in HTML. <br> <br>> You mean hand-kerning? <br> <br>Huh? I mean that the kerning in a font is ignored by HTML. <br> <br>> If you mean automagic kerning based on the kerning pairs <br>> specified in the font, that would be an OS-level issue. <br> <br>No, because the OS conveys kerns just fine - how else would Word be able to use them? <br>BTW, it's not automagic at all - we spend a lot of time doing kerning right! :-) <br> <br>> Based on MM's progress so far? <br> <br>No, based on the fact that they provide a flexible tool that an individual (with no shareholders to mind the bottom line) can use to develop some real onscreen text display. HTML doesn't. <br> <br>> So you're talking wow-em portfolio showpieces? <br> <br>No, I was trying to say that Flash gives designers more reason to exist. The clients of yours who have complained to you about browser-sniffing but not about the access are outnumbered by the clients (or actually non-clients) who didn't bother hiring a designer in the first place. <br> <br>The arguments you use to win clients are the same for using Flash instead of HTML. <br> <br>> .... one site, properly built .... <br> <br>A properly built site takes as much advantage of the differences in user setups as budget allows. <br> <br>> CSS doesn't do that at all. <br> <br>Then it's not enough, at least not all of the time. <br> <br>hhp <br></div>

But a user who zooms in isn't worried about readability (unless the Flash stuff is badly designed and the text is too small).</blockquote> That's precisely why users may want to zoom in. And 'too small' is subjective. On my screen for my eyes the text in this forum is at the bottom edge of comfortable legibility. For my GF, it's a shade too small. For my aunt, it's illegible. That's one of the bonuses of online text: no need for large-print editions. Flexible text size is a nicer solution, at least as far as the sort of ephemeral, moderate-length text people tend to read online. The violence done to line length by resizing the text might be too much for longer texts, but by then you've got bigger problems (eye fatigue from staring at an emissive display, for example). <br><blockquote>I mean that the kerning in a font is ignored by HTML.</blockquote> Vocabulary-check time. HTML is a markup language for describing the structure of a document. It really does nothing in terms of rendering a document to the screen. It just says "this is a 'p', this is an 'h1' and that's an 'li'". The browser then interprets those tags (typically as a paragraph, a level-1 heading and a list item, respectively) and applies formatting based on internal style rules. If it groks CSS, it will override those internal rules according to the rules specified in the stylesheet, if any. <br> <br>The little presentational candies (font tags, color and border attributes and suchlike) are corruptions introduced by Netscape back before CSS was a working draft, and are slowly being deprecated out. They really shouldn't have been there in the first place, but are and are still in wide use despite their drawbacks WRT bandwidth consumption, maintainability, etc. <br> <br>The point of HTML was that it could be viewed using a wide range of clients running on a wide range of devices: text browsers running on green sreen terminals, graphical browsers running on a PC, audio browsers running on a phone and so on. Fine points of display were intentionally left out because there was no way for an author to know whether the reader's device would even be capable of displaying multiple fonts or even boldface, let alone kerning and the like. <br> <br>CSS is a style language. It's entire raison d'etre is to define the look of a page. One of the design goals was to make it device-independant, so that the same style language could be used to style a document intended for a PC screen, for print, for a cell phone, etc. It is interpreted by the client application (a web browser, most commonly), which then applies the rules it understands and ignores those it doesn't. <br> <br>Neither HTML nor CSS is responsible for rendering the output; that's the browser's job. As I understand it, browsers typically use OS-specific drawing routines to actually produce the page. Leastwise, that's the only way I can explain why Firebird gets OS X's system-wide anti-aliasing. <br><blockquote>No, because the OS conveys kerns just fine - how else would Word be able to use them?</blockquote> Does Word display kerns in online text? I honestly don't know. I just know that on OS X at least, Word text is by far worse than text in Safari, Firebird, Flash, Acrobat, Illustrator...just about anything other than FreeHand with antialiasing turned off (which is hands-down the worst of all). If it does display kerns, you'd never know it. The text is <i>that</i> bad. <br> <br>It would actually surprise me if IE/Win didn't display kerns but Word did (my Win2K version of IE displays old-skool aliased text), as I'd expect them to use the same library for rendering text given how intertwined with the OS both are. <br> <br>To be perfectly honest, I'm not exactly sure how all the interaction between a font, an app and the OS plays out; that's a bit lower-level than I typically go. I do know that neither HTML nor CSS was ever intended to get quite down to that level</div>

<div class=commentbody>I just wanted to make two comments: <br> <br>WEFT: It was at one time really easy to rip off WEFT fonts if you were viewing the page as an end user. This was what I based my comments on. However, this appears to be no longer the case, which is a good thing. Similarly, fonts in PDF are less easy to rip off than they once were (not that I'm claiming they're "secure," just a bit less insecure). <br> <br>HTML: There is absolutely no reason that a web browser can't display HTML using the built-in kerning in the font you're viewing in (if there is any), except that it chooses not to. (The HTML text itself doesn't have to indicate kerning any more than plain text does. Place a plain text file in a DTP app, and it will have kerning.) <br> <br>T</div>

<div class=commentbody><blockquote>insisted <b>Hrant H Papazian</b>: <br>The interface should disable the Flash zoom and provide an intelligent way of size change.</blockquote> So more hand-waving, then. Can you even disable Flash zoom? <br><blockquote>Anyway, the OS has the kerning available, but browsers seem to ignore it.</blockquote> As I said, my understanding is that browsers use the OS's text rendering library. At least, they use MS's ClearType on Windows and Apple's Quartz antialiasing on OS X. Intuitively, it seems that kerning should be applied at the same level, no? <br> <br>I'm still intrigued by your suggestion that IE/Win does not apply kerning to on-screen* text but MS Word does. Perhaps a test is in order? Screenshots of some copy set in a font that should show kerning in Word, Win/IE and Flash? Maybe throw in Acrobat for grins. I'd be happy to supply screenshots for Safari, Moz/Firebird, IE, Preview, Word and whatever else you like on OS X. <br><blockquote>Kerning: defining pairs of letters and saying how much they should be moved closer or further way.</blockquote> Which information is then encoded in the font as kerning tables, no? <br> <br>Regardless, my point was that your work is long done by the time the browser gets the text; at that point the kerning in formation is either automagically applied or it isn't. Same with Flash. <br><blockquote>Intent, shmintent - I want results.</blockquote> Me to. Show me the Flash widget that supports scroll wheels, arrow keys, tabbing through links, forward/back keyboard accelerators, bookmarking, find, screen readers, updates from a publishing system, text zoom, proportional scrollbars, copying of text snippets and can be indexed by search engines and we'll talk. <br> <br>Actually, if you really want such a beast, I know a woman in NYC who's working on some sort of Flash reader for a reading comprehension test thingy she's developing in her spare time. I'd be happy to put you in touch with her if you like. <br><blockquote>But the point is that with Flash you don't have to convince anybody: you put kerning in your font, and it works.</blockquote> You have to convince them to go with Flash in the first place, no? And to spend the money for the development time to make Flash searchable by Google (how many clients don't care about their Google rank?), bookmarkable, updatable by whatever CMS and so on</div>

<div class=commentbody><blockquote>requested <b>steve paxton</b>: <br>Setmajer, you use links a lot - could you target them to _blank, so as not to interrupt the thread too much.</blockquote> Ctrl + click (CMD + click on Mac) opens links in a new window/tab automagically. You can also right click (ctrl + click on Mac) and select 'open in new window' from the context menu. <br> <br>Personally, I prefer not to have links targeted so I can decide whether to open up a new browser or not. However, if consensus style here is to target them I'll comply. <br><blockquote>Your discussion seems to have moved from when one should use Flash (or anything beyond HTML) to which is best - HTML or Flash.</blockquote> Without trying to put words in Hrant's mouth, I (at least) am arguing about using Flash for display of medium-long texts (i.e., more than 50 words or so). I do think there's a definite answer to that, though there are undoubtedly there are exceptions. <br> <br>Hrant's position seems to be (apologies if I'm getting it wrong) that Flash has more potential for text display. I'm skeptical, as I think the advantages of the browser currently outweigh the display advantages of Flash and rectifying Flash's shortcomings is, as yet, non-trivial. <br> <br>There's also a second point of disagreement: Hrant seems to think that the general best practice for web design is to make two versions, one for IE/Win and another for everything else. I disagree, first on the basis of personal experience that a two-tier system* has a higher TCO than a one-tier system and in fact is typically more expensive to produce, though it does require more expertise. I also don't think an IE-only solution really provides much value over a cross-browser solution, except insofar as an organization could better leverage existing Windows development knowledge</div>

I want <br>that to be my decicision. ;o) <br> <br>"My point is that although HTML is better at the moment, it has mostly <br>reached its ceiling" <br> <br>Realize that HTML really has little to do with text displaying other than <br>marking the content into some sort of semantically meaningful chunks. <br> <br>It's the browser and CSS that are made to handle the actual text display. <br> <br>As for Flash vs. HTML for reading, the advantage that HTML has for long text <br>is that it gives the end user more control than a flash file would. <br> <br>Maybe text blocks set in Flash does has better readability, but you need to <br>weigh that benefit against the cons (may be much harder to make <br>accessible...takes some control away from the end-user...requires the plug <br>in...may make the site harder to deliver to different browsers/devices, <br>etc.) <br> <br>as for the price debate, I think the only thing we can agree on is that the <br>gigantic, free for all budgets have been replaces with budgets of all sizes, <br>but with a bit more accounting in place. ;o)</div>

<div class=commentbody>> it gives the end user more control than a flash file would. <br> <br>No, just more than we've seen so far. <br>My point is that Flash can be made to do much more than HTML/CSS/browsers* - and I think it will eventually, especially now that good letterform rendering doesn't make it pointless. <br> <br>* Can I please just write "HTML" instead since we all really know what that implies anyway? :-/ <br> <br>hhp <br></div>

<div class=commentbody>"My point is that Flash can be made to do much more than HTML/CSS/browsers" <br> <br>Yes and no. They are different beasts. I agree you can do a lot with Flash if you take the initiative, but there can be a lot of drawbacks as well. <br> <br>"Can I please just write "HTML" instead since we all really know what that implies anyway?" <br> <br>HTML is just a markup language and it's device/display independent. Since we're talking mainly about typography, we probably shouldn't use the term HTML, as the only typographic information it can carry is semantic blocking (ie, this is a paragraph, this is a header) and the actual text content (but not the letterforms).</div>
