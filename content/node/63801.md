body: "I am mac based at work and I had an issue with a font.\r\nI opened a pdf in
  acrobat and the font on my screen was different and printed out different than a
  co workers computer did.\r\nI went to my font library in my macintosh hd and loaded
  the font that they said they had. Then the font showed up after i restarted acrobat
  and opened the file. I run suitcase as well. What is the deal? Do i have to have
  all the fonts i use in suitcase in this font library in my hd. I mean i go through
  a lot of different fonts during the year with different jobs. \r\nCan anyone give
  me advice on this?\r\n"

    If so, then the issue is acrobat. '

  body: It suggests that the font in question wasn't embedded in the PDF. Whoever
    made the PDF should make sure that the necessary fonts are embedded (also make
    sure that the font can be embedded - some do not allow PDF embedding which could
    also be a reason for this happening).

  body: hmm. Well it may be a pc mac font issue too. What do you think. But once the
    font was placed in my library of fonts on my hd it worked. I wish pcs and macs
    could play nice.

  body: I still think it's an embedding issue. If the font is embedded in the PDF
    correctly, it should look the same (barring screen rendering issues like ClearType
    or other technologies) *regardless* of where the PDF is viewed.

  body: "Open up the PDF and view the 'Document Properties-Fonts'. If the font was
    embedded you'll see something to the effect of 'Font Name -- Embedded Subset'.\r\n\r\nA
    correctly made PDF will open and print fine on a PC or a Mac (I've been doing
    this since 1993) and will contain all it needs (fonts, and images) to be viewed
    and printed as intended.\r\n\r\nInsert someone who doesn't know what they are
    doing and it's a crap shoot. (72dpi RGB images, fonts not embedded, etc.)\r\n\r\nIn
    Essence PDF (Portable Document Format) was created by Adobe to be platform and
    device independent.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.adobe.com/pdf/about/history/\r\n<cite>\"Regardless
    of the computer's operating system, PDF was reliable and consistent, displaying
    and printing the same every time.\"</cite>\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Acrobat-Fonts_5936.png]"
