body: "Hi Folks,\r\n\r\nI just released my first font in MyFonts. It's a text sans.
  If it makes success, I'll make a Cyrilic. Hope you like it! Here is a description:\r\n\r\nInspired
  by Italian Renaissance fonts like Poliphilus, Blado, Centaur and Arrighi, Lucca
  presents a simple charm and a powerful classic feel. It is cute, friendly, clear
  and superbly readable.\r\n\r\nIts low contrast provides Lucca a firm yet flexible
  substance, making it sensual and enticing. There\u2019s a certain degree of abstraction
  in the precise endings, and the whole design was made to survive even in the harshest
  conditions, conserving its readability and beauty.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Lucca

  body: Congratulations on an absolutely wonderful typeface. I love the letterforms!
    (Although, the cant of the 5 seems a bit awkward.) I hope it does well for you.
    (Wish I could afford it!)
