    Trajan, because it is very over-used. \r\n\r\nI would suggest setting your lettering
    as the test phrase and then searching for key words like 'elegant serif' or 'lapidary'.\r\n\r\n-

    to have the best keyword search capabilities. Unless I know the font is at another
    site, that is generally where I start searching for commercial fonts.\r\n\r\n-
