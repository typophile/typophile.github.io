		<div class="commentbody">Just to clarify: a logo is protected by a slightly different branch of intellectual property law &ndash; Trademark, not Copyright. Unlike copyright, which accrues to the creator upon the act of creation (under all copyright laws that I know of anyway), trademark protection is usually only offered after registration and a period of review. Also, the guidelines for determining infringement are specific to trademark law.  <BR> <BR>If &quot;Satan&quot; has any concerns, he/she should contact a trademark attorney for a professional opinion. <BR> <BR><i>Svastika</i> is a Sanskrit word derived from <i>svasti</i> (&quot;well-being, fortune, luck, success, prosperity&quot;). Svastika can refer in general to any auspicious mark or object, but it is most commonly used to indicate the familiar swastika symbol. Some claim that the direction of the arms has significance, but I suspect this is a post-WWII revisionism designed to distance the original symbol from the Nazi appropriation/corruption of it. Steven Heller wrote an entire book about this.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Paul, talking about unintentional swastika's: we once received a flaming letter by a FontShop customer who bought FUSE 1 and noticed the &quot;x&quot; in Ian Swift's <i>Maze 91</i>. This guy was so outraged he virtually accused us of being Nazis! I fear this negative conotation is so engrained in our collective memory that it won't ever go away. Then again, he was the only customer in the entire FS network we ever heard of who was irked by the character. Methinks it's just a question of interpretation, and I suspect some people to intentionally go looking for these kind of things. <BR> <BR>Graham, I'm very impressed. <BR> <BR>Satan, I really don't know. Personnally, comparing your design to the other examples shown here I think your interlocking Fs are a pure swipe, and I wouldn't recommend using it from an ethical point of view. Uvcurz, you're a free man. No offense, I don't wanna sound too harsh.

Also, I didn't want it to possibly cause a problem for my client in the future. <BR> <BR>- Paul</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I am very interested by the swastika issue. <BR>I can confirm that the clockwise or counterclockwise direction is an after-WW2 assumption, since the symbol has always been used with positive meaning in both directions before the Nazi appropriation. <BR> <BR>Actually I had a short discussion with Heller when he wrote an essay on Outwest for my &quot;Letters&quot; book (coming out before the end of.. etc. etc.) and I mostly disagree with his conclusions. I have not read his book, but I have read an article on Baseline and what I actually consider wrong is the preconception against blackletter (raised by Heller in another article). This is all part of a project I intend to develop on the redemption of the blackletter (and maybe the swastika) considering that, as Miles Newlyn pointed out talking about his Ferox typeface, perceptions towards graphic symbols always arise in context. <BR> <BR>When I will do it I will ask for the opinion of Typophile members. This tread has proved really interesting.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Well, most people are, but Heller seems to have a strong personal attitude towards the issue. In part I can understand but I just hate the idea of &quot;cursed&quot; graphic symbols or alphabets. And I'm glad Mattel or someone for them used Jon Barnbrook's Manson for Barbie's computer animation feature &quot;Princess Raperonzolo&quot;, also on DVD. First Snow White, now this. And I've found also the most banal use of Manson ever, paired with Trajan: for an Italian Shopping center. So &quot;sad&quot; I had to send it to Jon.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">What irritates me about Heller's book is his attack on the accidental use of swastikas - which would have been Paul's case if he hadn't noticed it. And this is in a book subtitled <i>Symbol Beyond Redemtion?</i>. He should be honest and leave out the question mark. The swastika might eventually redeem itself if it wasn't for people like Heller attacking football teams and skateboard companies for their choice of logo.  <BR>  <BR>I recently read Heinrich B</div>
