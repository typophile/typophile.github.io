    Bendays, etc. It was actually a brand name originally that generalised, sort of
    like a xerox copy meaning a photo copy. All of this explanation is for the younger
    readers who never knew the smell of fix, Bestine, or amonia :-)\r\n\r\nChrisL"

    90s): lino machines can actually output directly to\r\n\"paper\" instead of film
    (it feels a lot like velox, just thinner IIRC).\r\nThe drawback is that they have
    to have the supplies available and\r\nbe willing to swap them in for film, but
    I'm thinking that would\r\nraise the price (compared to film) only modestly. Oh,
    another draw-\r\nback is that you only get one thing out of it, not a thing (film)
    that\r\nyou can use to make multiple prints from. But of course you can\r\nhave
    a bunch of outputs of the same thing made.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
