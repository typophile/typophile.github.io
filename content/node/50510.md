body: "Any constructive criticism for this logo would be much appreciated.\r\n\r\nThis
  logo is for a restaurant that will be opening early next year in Laguna Beach, CA.
  The name is WaterMarc--it will be contemporary take on a seafood bar and grill.
  \r\n\r\nThe concept for the logo is that the \"W\" throws a shadow of a three-tined
  cocktail fork on the plate. I tried doing the W first and then the fork, but it
  didn't look right, so I drew the fork's shadow the way I wanted it to look first,
  then custom drew the \"W\" to kind of match it. I am a self-taught designer and
  have never tried to draw my own letters before, so I'm looking to this venerable
  community to help me out!\r\n\r\nThank you, and peace."

  body: "The fork being a \"W\" is brilliant, but don't show the fork itself, just
    the shadow. You'd make the \"W\" of the shadow upright (with the stem bending
    over the plate's contours*) and that's that. Very classy. They could raise their
    prices just based on that logo!  ;-)\r\n\r\n* Maybe use a slightly more contoured
    plate.\r\n\r\nBTW, interesting name they chose. Is the interior decoration going
    to involve watermarked coarse ecru wallpaper? Then I would go.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "This design captures the essence of what makes for a good logo--once seen
    always remembered. I disagree with hrant; I would leave the graphic exactly as
    is. If anything, I would think about softening the \"W\" a tad. It's a bit on
    the stark contrast side.\r\n\r\nDo you mean to use the text beneath? Don't! Find
    a way to work that \"W\" into the text as well, and you have a double-good design.
    But, just to stress: don't let that graphic anywhere in public with that text!

  body: "Yea, wonderful logo graphic! I love the fork. I'm not so sure I'm feeling
    the plate though. Have you tried it without the plate? It just seems like stock
    photography, feels a little amateurish, which doesn't do your graphic justice.
    Yea, I don't think you need the plate.\r\n\r\nAs for the text, too much. And it's
    sloppy, people are going to be eating there, if you are looking for class, stick
    with a font that would compliment your \"W\" I mean, why aren't you using that
    same typeface? so there's a connection with the two W's. It possibly will not
    work well, but it's worth looking at.\r\n\r\nBut great idea! I'd love to see it
    when you're finished.\r\n\r\ncourtney"
