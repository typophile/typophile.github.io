  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>Disclaimer: I really don&rsquo;t know anything about typography. I&rsquo;m just getting really OCD about the manuscript of the story I&rsquo;m writing (&ldquo;writing&rdquo; being code for <!-- raw HTML omitted -->toiling through<!-- raw HTML omitted -->).</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re in the en dash camp as opposed to the em dash (with regard to parenthetical thoughts, abrupt stops, etc.): How do you handle a dash at the end of a paragraph? It looks like books that use spaced en dashes mid-sentence opt for unspaced em dashes at the end of the paragraph. (The spaced en dash looks too airy to me in this situation.)</p>
<p>Yeah, succinctly wording written questions has never been my forte. Which of these examples are correct, if any?</p>
<p>John said, &ldquo;Hi, I&rsquo;m looking for—&rdquo;
vs.
John said, &ldquo;Hi, I&rsquo;m looking for –&rdquo;</p>
<p>John was looking for—
vs.
John was looking for –</p>
<p>Also (and I know the answer to this is blindingly obvious, but Google has failed me time and time again to the point where I&rsquo;m ready to smash my forehead through my computer screen), how do you format an ellipsis followed immediately by closed quotation marks? Unless my memory is failing me, Bringhurst says the space in front of the ellipsis should be removed if the ellipsis is followed by other punctuation. Quotation marks?</p>
<p>Thanks in advance for any help.</p>
<p>Edit: Bleh. For the project I&rsquo;m working on, I may just chicken out and dot-space-dot-space-dot my ellipses. I&rsquo;m using Bookman Old Style and I&rsquo;m not sure I like the look of tiny dot-dot-dot next to those big, waddling, page-swallowing characters, and I can&rsquo;t be bothered to switch fonts for a larger ellipsis or whatever. (See? I have no idea what I&rsquo;m doing.)</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>My <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Penguin Guide to Punctuation<!-- raw HTML omitted --> says only this:</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->   In the rare case in which a sentence is broken off abruptly without being    completed&hellip;the dash is written solid next to the unfinished piece-of-a-word    which precedes it.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>This rather makes me wonder whether your first example suggests the word for— has been cut short, whilst your second example suggests the following word has been stopped short.</p>
<p>Also, the first one looks to me like a faster interruption, whilst the second could indicate John was pausing slightly before listing what he was looking for, and was interrupted in his pause.</p>
