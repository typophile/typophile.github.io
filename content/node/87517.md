  class that I'm taking.  I'm supposed to make an exact replica of it.  I think I've
  figured out the font for the big letters...it looks like Smart Sans Light.  Unfortunately,
  it costs $54, which I can't afford.  Is there a free option, or do I have the font
  wrong anyway?  Also, what are the other two fonts?\r\n\r\n[[http://weareyoungmonster.com/files/gimgs/31_117scrsticker.jpg|Here]]'s
