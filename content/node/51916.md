  body: "At first glance I would agree but\u2026\r\n\r\nOkay a little background:
    I have a typeface called REI in my library from even before I worked here that
    we use when working on ads for REI. I was only assuming that REI was a generic
    name and was wondering if it is maybe a custom typeface or if it goes by another
    name.\r\n\r\nhere is another example comparing it to clarendon, the REI seems
    much more condensed. \r\n\r\n(clarendon and left 6 = \"clarendon,\" REI and right
    6 = \"REI\"\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/example_4345.jpg]\r\n\r\nthanks\r\n\r\n\r\np@rick"
