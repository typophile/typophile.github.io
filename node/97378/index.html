I&rsquo;m studying Communication Design at Fine Arts from Oporto (Portugal) and this year is all dedicated to typography. My teacher gave me this exercice to do for tuesday: to create an alfabet with different typefaces that must content fonts from different époces, authors and fisionomies. I&rsquo;ve been searching about the earliest typefaces used (Blackletters) since Gutenberg invented the letterpress and I couldn&rsquo;t find the 1st font ever used. Do you have any idea of what it can be?</p>
<p>Thanks</p>
