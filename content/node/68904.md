  body: "It seems likely to me that this is a customization of a more conventional
    serif. The A might be a flipped V with a tilde used for the crossbar. It may have
    started as an antiqued font, or that may have been done with techniques that have
    been mentioned here in the past (using PhotoShop, or Illustrator to add noise
    to the font outline). \r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
