  someone has played around with Gothic 13, redrawing the 'O' and slightly expanding
  the other characters, but I can't quite replicate the weight.\r\n\r\nMaybe it is
  an actual typeface? All input is gratefully appreciated."

    handmade (its like a diamond shape inside, the vertical stems should be a little
    bit thicker in my opinion).\r\n\r\nI also looked at Helvetica Inserat and if you
    manipulate it a little bit, you could get the same appearance as the logo, conserning
    the other letters.\r\nBut hey, Gothic 13 should also work fine, after some manipulation."

    Middleweight</a> from Hoefler & Frere-Jones. The Os are probably hand-drawn as
    Goran suggested.
