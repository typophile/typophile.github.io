  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>Not sure if this has been brought to anyone&rsquo;s attention on the Forum, but I just reviewed a survey in Oct. issue of <em>Graphic Design USA</em> on the <a href="http://www.gdusa.com/issue_2005/10_oct/lookout/lookout.php" target="new">Type Purchasing marketplace</a> from the type specifier&rsquo;s viewpoint.</p>
<p>Of note (by the readers surveyed):</p>
<p>Do you have purchasing influence with regard to type and fonts?
YES 88%,	NO 12%</p>
<p>How many designer font users or specifiers are there in your department or firm?
1-2  38%, 	3-5  21%
6-10  13%, 	11-15  11%,
16-25  8%, 	25+  9%</p>
<p>Which operating system does your company use for those purposes?
macintosh 88%, window 38%,	both 26%</p>
<p>Many of the comments by graphic designers are notable in terms of why and how the make decisions on buying fonts, but several comments just sound like &ldquo;the smart thing to say.&rdquo;</p>
<p>COMMENT BY GRAPHIC DESIGNER: <em>Before computers changed the designer&rsquo;s toolbox, type houses would provide large catalogues that displayed all manner of type style, size, specification tables (remember &ldquo;specing type&rdquo;?) and the like, for a wide variety of font families. We kept a huge library of these catalogues that we would &ldquo;troll&rdquo; for the appropriate font. The web has pretty much replaced this huge library, but nothing beats having the font resources right at hand. 
Obviously we cannot purchase every available font on the planet so I would suggest to type designers and foundries that they send more mailers, promotions and reminders that they have the right &ldquo;building block&rdquo; at the &ldquo;right time&rdquo; for the design I am putting together.</em> &ndash; Ron Kalina, Kalina Design, Exton, PA</p>
<p>The survey is followed by several pages Type Designers' questions &amp; answers.</p>

		<div class="commentbody">I guess it shouldn&rsquo;t surprise me, but it was remarkable how many said &ldquo;price&rdquo; was a factor in purchasing fonts. The price per font weight doesn&rsquo;t vary <em>that</em> much between foundries and resellers. $20-$40. I guess we have some more educating to do.</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Hmph. One of the things that influences my buying of a font is the extent of a family.
I want small caps; I want <em>italic</em> small caps! If there&rsquo;s a bold, a want bold small caps and bold italic small caps! All with matching OS figs (in the small caps font, please: why the Roman would contain the os figs and the small caps would contain lining figs is completely beyond me, but coming from a country with letters and numbers combined for postal codes it is a major major pain for typesetting.)</p>
<p>Am I the last designer on earth who uses such things for the sake of consistency? I don&rsquo;t want these things as extra styles, I <em>need</em> them so that if I&rsquo;ve decided on the use of small caps in my document I can use them throughout and not be faced with that hideous conundrum of encountering eg. &ldquo;USA&rdquo; in an italic section or bold heading and having to decide &hellip; now do i fake it (bad), break editorial style and set in caps (bad) or change the style throughout just to accomodate this incomplete font set (highly undesirable)?</p>
<p>Furthermore, if a serif face has a matching sans, I need it all to match: os figs, scaps etc.</p>
<p>As much as i love and use Eureka &amp; Eureka Sans, the Sans italic has no os figs! What kind of BS is that? I have literally had to change to lining figs throughout a document because of this.</p>
<p>Perhaps I&rsquo;m too uptight. But the main reason that designers give for buying type being &ldquo;appropriateness for their message&rdquo; and, essentially, recognizable, quirky style just makes me roll my eyes, throw my hands up in the air and give up on typography forever.</p>
<p>sorry. got a little ranty.</p>

Most designers don&rsquo;t use smallcaps even if it&rsquo;s right in front of them, even on multi-million-dollar projects.

<p>Quite true, Marian. As I said in my own opinion&hellip; several comments just sound like “the smart thing to say.”</p>
<p>If you know what you are doing, then just do it. Many graphic designers &ldquo;talk the talk,&rdquo; but as we all know few &ldquo;walk the walk.&rdquo;</p>
<p>What I take from the survey is that there is still great potential to market typefaces, and almost an obligation to show designers how to use type, both traditionaly as well as innovatively. It&rsquo;s like they are all waiting for another Herb Lubalin or U&amp;lc to be awed by type again.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s a wonderful notion, and I hope it&rsquo;s true, but I don&rsquo;t know if they are willing to buy enough type to pay for it. Gotta sell quite a few $40 units to warrant production, printing, and mailing a mag of U&amp;lc&rsquo;s quality.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s true that printing and paper costs are higher now, but if you recall for the first year or two of publication U&amp;lc was printed on low grade newsprint with black ink only. The &ldquo;quality&rdquo; of U&amp;lc was in its layouts and content, plus a bullpen of some of the best designers of that time.</p>
<p>Also, Aaron Burns initially focused on creating a mailing base of only type specifiers (built from mailing lists from PLINC, other type houses and subscription list from Graphic Design USA) and colleges with art programs. The ratio of type buyers to readership was extremely high. Eventually U&amp;lc sold ad space as well.</p>
<p>Developing a direct mail piece in <em>magazine-like</em> format by a foundry or font distributor would be quite costly today. A better approach would be to consider it a true publication, maybe quarterly. The production and printing cost, like any other magazine, would be paid in part by the advertisers, subscribers (if you are charging a fee) and direct purchase (instead of &ldquo;newsstand&rdquo; sales, it would be single issues ordered via internet, like <a href="http://www.artdesign.fr/boutique_us/liste_produits.cfm?type=23&num=0&code_lg=lg_us" target="new">étapes:international</a>).</p>
<p>All in all, it would still be major undertaking.
Hmmmm&hellip; guess we need to come up with another schema. ;-)</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>True, Dan. <a href="http://www.linotype.com/matrix" target="new">Linotype Matrix</a> seems to have the makings of a good trypographic periodical.</p>
<p>There are inherent pitfalls in creating a <em>U&amp;lc</em> clone by a single foundry, large or small. For one thing, there is a certain bias to content and a danger of seeming too much &ldquo;advertorial&rdquo; than editorial.</p>
<p>In 1990, Agfa launched a large format type magazine called <em>26</em> which lasted a short while since by corporate standards <em>sales</em> did not offset or justify the cost of publication. The attempt was valiant but no one seems to recall the existence of <em>26</em>.</p>
<p>If a company measures &ldquo;success&rdquo; of a publication strictly against the sale of fonts and within the advertising budget, then it is doomed to fail.</p>

<p>I agree with Norbert, I think for there to be a truly comprehensive type publication it needs to be done by a third party that is not a type foundry. How many of us would be willing to read a political news magazine for accurate information if it was published solely by the G.O.P.?</p>
