  respect everybodys knowledge and opinions on these forums, so anything would be
  helpful. The logos are just for a personal mark right now, nothing serious...maybe
  down the line sometime soon. My name might accompany it pd are my initials, or another
  idea I have is anyword that starts with p and design example: pangea design.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/pd.png]\r\n\r\nSpecifically
  I am wondering about what other contrasting colors might work with this logo, and
  the fact that when viewed smaller you lose the 3D Escher effect. \r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/pd2.png]\r\n\r\nHere
  is option numer two. I love this logo myself, I really think it pays homage to the
  Bauhaus and maybe even El Lissitzky. But everybody I've ran it past for critique
  says they read the word pool.  I see it, but like I said I have emotional attachment
  issues to this one.  If you guys/gals tell me it reads pool I will catalog it and
  wait for some high end pool supply company to come along and pitch it to them.\r\n\r\n-Patrick

  body: Actually, I think the first two shapes make a lower-case "r," which you really
    don't want. What about something like this[img:sites/default/files/old-images/pd-idea.jpg]

    only 1 color. Some good logos are geometric, but I think you would get better
    results drawing out 100 thumbnails of the the 3 ideas above (including Jay's suggestion).
    They all look like you began the project in illustrator."

  body: Meta, if you thin the bars which represent strokes in your second option they
    will look more like a p and d as opposed to two lowercase r. I like this one a
    lot. I enjoy the abstraction of letterforms and don't know that it needs to be
    exactly the letters. However, your first option seems to lack something which
    the second has potential for.

  body: "Here's just a couple variation on the prior suggestions. I also like the
    others's suggestions. Something about your sample #2 is interesting, if you can
    fix that lower-case \"r\" issue. It's like a little horizontal row of simple shapes
    that-- hey there!-- could look like P and D.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/pd-alt1.jpg][img:sites/default/files/old-images/pd-alt2.jpg]"

  body: Overall, the nice thing about having P and D to work with is that in the lower
    case, they are the same thing, just rotated 180. And each is just one line and
    one curve (or one box and one circle). So there's lots of room to play on their
    shape similarities.
