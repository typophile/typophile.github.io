    target="_blank">I thought so too.</a> But the legs of the R are too short to make
    it Avenir. <BR> <BR>Unless it&#39;s one of those cruelly man-handled faces.

  body: Yeah, you&#39;re right Karen - it doesn&#39;t seem to be Avenir. Not only
    the legs of the R are short, the stroke on the right leg seems to have a slight
    variation of width. <BR> <BR>It&#39;s 5:20 AM here... sleepy type spotting isn&#39;t

    alt="Neutraface"> <BR> <BR>It seems too bold, but that might be just due to the
    very huge size. <BR> <BR>Where did you get the sample from?

    <BR>&#40;I think my excuses are getting more creative.&#41; <BR> <BR>David, this
    one hasn&#39;t been manhandled, so it&#39;s OK. But I&#39;m surprised at the number
