body: "I've found something interesting. On this site, the quotations curve (\" and
  \") and the two hyphens together creating a pause form into one line --, like they're
  supposed to.\r\n\r\nIs there some sort of genious code on this site that does that?
  Does anyone know why the type is able to do this? Thanks.\r\n\r\n-- David"

    entry areas are flash, and they must all have a script set to combine two hyphens
    into the ASCII equavalent for the em dash.
