body: "February 6, 2007 \r\n\r\n<strong>Yes\u2013 new fonts from Fountain!</strong>\r\n\r\nWe're
  back. We have typefaces. Fine, fine typefaces. Lovely precious typefaces. We want
  to present them to you: \r\n\r\n<strong>Jalape\xF1o</strong>\r\nA happy, springy
  display face with an extra 30 dingbats. \r\nDirect link: (http://www.fountain.nu/catalogue/jalapeno.asp)\r\n
  \r\n<strong>Borgstrand Stencil</strong>\r\nAn expansion of Borgstrand. Two cuts\_-
  one with rounded corners, similar in flavor to the original typeface. The second
  \"cut-out\" version is specifically tuned for stenciling in the real world - since
  it has been designed to be cut out.\r\nDirect link: (http://www.fountain.nu/catalogue/borgstrand.asp)\r\n\r\nBoth
  typefaces designed by Martin Fredrikson. \r\n\r\n<strong>Eason</strong> \r\nEason
  evolved from Nicolas Jenson\u2019s 1470 roman. Jenson has been revived and remixed
  so many times, conscious decisions were made to transform Eason into a new creation.
  The postmodern result is very far afield from Venetian Renaissance types, a hard-working
  choice for the most demanding projects. Designed by Randy Jones.\r\nDirect link:
  (http://www.fountain.nu/catalogue/eason.asp) \r\n\r\nSee also how the whole typefaced
  evolved right here at Typophile:\r\nhttp://typophile.com/node/2349\r\nhttp://typophile.com/node/9290\r\n\r\n\r\n<strong>Anziano</strong>\r\nWhen
  creating a traditional typeface, you will be inevitably influenced by earlier designs.
  Anziano shows some touches of Weiss (Emil Rudolf Weiss, 1926). Bu Stefan has tried
  to find his own path with Anziano and has made a typeface design that lives on its
  own. \r\nDirect link: (http://www.fountain.nu/catalogue/anziano.asp) \r\n\r\nWe've
  made small printable PDF's of each of the new releases.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<strong>Upcoming
  fonts with a few words</strong> \r\n\r\n<strong>Dessau</strong>\r\nG\xE1bor K\xF3thay
  goes Bauhaus \u2013 in all sorts, ways, avriations and forms. \r\n\r\n<strong>Tycho</strong>\r\n
  Lucas Magnusson joins Fountain with a revival of famous danish astronomer Tycho
  Brahe's own fount. \r\n\r\n<strong>Atlantik</strong>\r\nDaniel & Sylvia makes the
  nicest (and weirdest) pattern/dingbat ever. OP-art springs to mind. I get all dizzy
  just looking at it.\r\n\r\n<strong>Flieger</strong>\r\nbased on an old airplane
  logo from the early 30's G\xF6ran S\xF6derstr\xF6m not only joins Fountain, but
  also makes a fanatstic gridbased script. Lotta Bruhn joins in to draw the ornaments.
  \r\n\r\nTake a fast peek in our Fresh/upcoming section. \r\nDirect link: (http://www.fountain.nu/catalogue/fresh_upcoming.asp)\r\n\r\n\r\n<strong>More
  Things</strong>\r\n\r\n\u2013 We've changed location, and now have a wonderful large
  office. Images to come as soon as we've gotten organized,and a bit more tidy. \r\n\r\n\u2013
  Small printed specimen of the last few Fountain releases coming real soon.\r\n\r\n\u2013
  Large book/catalogue with many nice pages later this year. As soon as all fonts
  has been transformed to OpenType. \r\n\r\n\u2013 Restructuring of website, due before
  the end of fall.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTills vi h\xF6rs igen \u2013 simma lugnt! \r\n\r\n<strong>Peter

  body: Nice work, Peter! Martin Fredrikson's work makes me smile, and I'm pleased
    that the U.S. edition of GQ magazine is no longer using Borgstrand so that I can
    slip it into a publication of my own sometime.
