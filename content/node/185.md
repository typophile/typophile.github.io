body: Hi, <BR> <BR>here&#39;s another logo I&#39;ve been working and will present
  it to the client next week. This is tricky one. The name of the company is called
  GRUPO REPOLHO. It&#39;s the portuguese name for &#34;cabbage group&#34; where repolho
  is the family name of the owners. The company is a big group of transportation,
  construction, machine rental and landscape/nature recovery related. <BR> <BR>On
  my first ideas I realized the logo needed a &#34;motion&#34; look like a wheel &#40;machine
  rental also added this wheel idea&#41;. Now the name REPOLHO &#40;cabbage&#41; was
  also a starting point, altough it&#39;s a kind of strange name for a company like
  this. <BR> <BR>So the task was to do a cabbage brand that has some motion and that
  looks cool. I came out with a logo that I personally like a lot, and I&#39;m showing
  it here for your advises on the type/font i should use along it. <BR> <BR> <BR>1.
  Here&#39;s a photo of a repolho <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"

  src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/10991.gif" alt=""> <BR> <BR>3.
  A preview on the cards, I&#39;m thinking on having the logo &#34;embossed&#34; on
  the papper, so the back of the card has the brand on papper with the negative emboss
  simmulated by the tint color...  <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/10992.gif"
  alt=""> <BR> <BR>The font I used is Adobe Myriad Pro which falls under the &#34;Overused
  fonts&#34;. Anyone has a suggestion on a typeface that match the mood of the brand/icon?
  Thanks in advance.

    kinf of machinery&#41;, but i would be carefull with the blank spaces on the perimeter
    leaves, y think is too thin and at small sizes specially embossed it wont have
    the definition that requires. <BR> <BR>well done <BR>CG

    from business cards to large trucks or billboards, you may have to create different
    versions for use at different sizes and for different printing methods which is
    okay IMHO. I also really like the green. <BR> <BR>Really good work imho. <BR>

    font so that I could see the result? No need for a big quality gif, just for visual
    reference. Those fonts are not on any testdrive I know and so it&#39;s difficult
    to see how they will work out. Thanks.

  body: '<i>The company is a big group of transportation, construction, machine rental

    to stress the latter aspects of their business, your logo might be a bit too organic
    looking. Perhaps you could try the same shape only more regularised? Or, perhaps
    you could provide two versions of the same form, for use by different businesses
    within the Grupo Repolho: so they could have a more mechanical looking version
    for their transport and machine rental and a more organic version for use with
    their more environmental businesses.'

    this is the reason so many flowers have five or eight petals. It also applies
    to artichokes, pineapples, and general branching rules in plants. <BR> <BR>I also
    think the cabbage logo is fine as it is. In fact, I&#39;d say it&#39;s brilliant.
    <BR> <BR>I would also go with a serif font instead &#40;but I must confess I generally
    dislike any sans.&#41; Perhaps you should consider a family with an incised weight
    to harmonize with the &#34;incised&#34; highlights on the outer cabbage leaves.
    Either way, something more organic-looking. <BR> <BR>Perhaps something by <a href="http://www.itcfonts.com/fonts/product.asp?nCo=AFMT&amp;st=keyword&amp;sk=kobayashi">Akira

  body: Hmm. A couple thoughts. --- Maybe you throw in some italic? Maybe the cabbage
    is turning in the wrong direction? I flopped it giving it forward motion. Maybe
    there are too many fiddly bits? --- Just thoughts. Conceptually it is very strong.

  body: It&#39;s a nice idea, Tiffany, but I think the addition of italic type adds
    a &#34;third dynamic&#34; - I&#39;m not sure how else to describe it - that weakens
    the design overall. <BR> <BR>Even having Grupo and Repolho in different colours
    threatens to do this, but the larger Repolho in green helps balance the design.  <BR>
    <BR>Adriano&#39;s original design at the top seems to have the most poise &#40;type
    choices aside&#41;. It reminds me a lot of the BP logo. The business cards are
    perfect, too, with the olive colour keeping the emphasis on the logo. <BR> <BR>Paul

    <BR> <BR>Looking at it again Adriano. The mark has such strong possibilities.
    Meaning it can stand on its own. I might consider treating the mark and text as
    separate enitities. Not try fit the type around the mark.

  body: Hello Adriano, <BR> <BR>First of all I would like to say I like the logo.  <BR>But
    second I have to say I agree with John Hudson. The logo works for me too much
    as &#39;healthy&#39;, &#39;reform&#39;, &#39;nature&#39;, etc.  <BR>You can use
    the gag of designing the logo for a mechanical company like that in a very &#39;nature
    shop&#39;-kind of way. But if you do that, the typography is very important.  <BR>You
    have to remember that it is a mechanical company. Maybe a straight forward kind
    of typo is better. Helvetica sounds good to me. <BR> <BR>Perhaps changing the
    colour is a help. You could do that for the differtent specialities within the
    company, thereby creating sub-logos. At least you take the edge of the &#39;nature-look&#39;.
    <BR> <BR>Regards, <BR>Ren
