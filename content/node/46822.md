  body: "I feel that Officiana Sans is a slightly condensed font as compared to Caslon.
    I think that Caslon is also a little too intricate to compliment a font as neat
    as Officiana Sans... \r\n\r\nIs there any particular reason that you aren't looking
    at Officiana Serif? That is a nice simple Slab serif Font that i think would work
    (it is a type system!) but then again it also depends on the context of it all.\r\n\r\nIf
    i had to pick a, I think Century Old Style?\r\n\r\nhttp://www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/scangraphic/century_old_style_sh/\r\n\r\n--\r\narjun"

  body: I am using officina serif for part of the text, but it's for a certificate
    and I wanted something a bit more distinguished for the title if that helps.
