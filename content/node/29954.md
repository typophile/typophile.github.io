body: "I can't remove Franklin Gothic Medium and Medium Italic from my PC.\r\n\r\nBecause
  of a new problem loading Photoshop 5 (it fails with a cooltype.dll error at \"Initializing
  Type Engine\") I've been trying to strip my fonts folder down to its bare minimum
  (it's my home machine, so there's not too much in there anyway)\r\n\r\nThese two
  ITC fonts framd.ttf and framdit.ttf show in my Windows font older with the Opentype
  icon, if I delete them, they seem to regenerate, after a couple of seconds and if
  I remove them using ATM 4 (with the remove files from disk option checked) they
  temporarily disappear from the Windows font folder, and then reappear with the TTF
  icon!\r\n\r\nI seriously doubt this behaviour has anything to do with my Photoshop
  problem (although it still isn't fixed), but it is starting to annoy me.\r\n\r\nNot
  that I have any particular aversion to ITC or Franklin Gothic, but I would like
  to feel that I'm in control of whether a font stays or not.\r\n"

  body: "The fonts are used in Windows XP's UI, so are 'system file protected' - same
    thing will happen if you try to delete Tahoma. We originally licensed outlines
    from URW, and licensed the trademark from ITC - the full set of fonts were used
    for corporate branding, but eventually ended up shipping with Publisher - two
    styles were shipped with Windows XP (and subsequently Vista).\r\n\r\nCheers, Si "
