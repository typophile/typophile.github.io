body: "This is not a genre of typefaces I usually spend a lot of time pondering, so
  I thought I would ask y'all for suggestions.\r\n\r\nLooking for a cursive, italic
  or possibly script font, at least moderately bold. It needs to be highly legible,
  warm, personal, and modern. Not too formal/frilly. Sauna Bold Italic (probably swash?)
  is the first thing that comes to mind.\r\n\r\nThoughts?\r\n\r\nT\r\n\r\n[Edit: moved
  to General Discussions]"

  body: "Extra info point: this is for a logo design.\r\n\r\nThose are all interesting
    suggestions! Capucine seems close to what I had in mind, but Coline Cursive and
    Insouciant are intriguing directions. Andron seems almost too normal/traditional
    for this purpose, but one of the letters that would feature in the logo is particularly
    gorgeous, so maybe!\r\n\r\nIt will be interesting to see what catches the fancy
    of the designer working with this. \r\n\r\nThank you all for taking the time to
    consider my question. Further ideas still appreciated, at least for another day
    or so!  :)\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\n\r\nT"

    too which might however be too much); or maybe Brevia Italic?
