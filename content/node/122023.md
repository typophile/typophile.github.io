  body: Can't find a match. Reminds me a lot of [[http://www.myfonts.com/search/times|Times]].
    At the moment, I have only alternatives with [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/fontbureau/starling|Starling]]
    and [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/ef-typeshop/riccione|Riccione]]. What's your
    sample origin? Magazine? Maybe bespoke...

    angled crossbar on the |e| are pretty distinctive, but I haven\u2019t found a
    match, either.\r\n\r\nAs Ryuk stated, any information on the source would be helpful...."

  body: "Depending on your date this might be a photo-lettering era design that is
    not digitized.\r\nMy closest find so far is the Apple version of Times Bold\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/TimesAppleBoldAsTomas_5733.gif][img:sites/default/files/old-images/TimesAppleBoldAspoint_6646.gif]\r\nYour
    letters almost look like someone like Tom Carnase,  Dave Trooper, Herb Lubalin
    or Ronne Bonder had redrawn Times Roman circa 1970.\r\nDon"

    2009].\r\nAccording to the following site, this is a free Cyrillic font:\r\nhttp://free.type.org.ua/en/vremena/\r\n\r\nLuc
