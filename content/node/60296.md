  body: "Well, those letters were installed in 1916, a decade before Futura's design.

    the Reichstag comes from an early time, which had its own architectural (and lettering)
    style.\r\n\r\nThose letters were designed by Peter Behrens, who was probably the
    country's most renowned designer at the time. But I think that Behrens' work became
    less popular in the 1920s and 1930s\u2026"
