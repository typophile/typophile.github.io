  at uni. For this I would like to use a font like or immitating analogue VCR type,
  as seen in the upper left of the picture below.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/700774_a15038e007_3751.jpg]\r\n\r\nYou
  could also rephrase that to: \xBBWhich font is used in this picture?\xBB\r\n\r\nThanks
  and bye\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEDIT\r\n\r\nFound a better picture.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/vcr_5116.png]"
