  body: Antibiotics should probably be number one on the list. There's not a single
    invention in history that's done more to improve our quality of life. The transistor
    should also be pretty far up there, as should interchangeable parts and the assembly
    line.

    - enabled for first time, really, the coordination of distant events & schedules/trains.\r\n\r\nSeaworthy
    clocks - allowing for rationalized navigation. \r\n\r\nThere's a BBC show that
    I used to watch, where this guy would take one simple \"technology\" (something
    we take for granted and see as rather mundane and obvious), and shows how revolutionary
    it was and how much it effected history.\r\n\r\nThe modern world is such an amazing
    web of such a myriad of interdependent inventions & discoveries, it's hard to
    prioritize them.  Take the discovery of antibiotics - I'll bet we can name ten
    prior inventions/discoveries that the discovery of antibiotics depended upon -
    take away one of them and no antibiotics.\r\n\r\nAnd that interests me too: what
    is the difference between a discovery or an invention?  Are all inventions merely
    discoveries?  Was the airfoil invented - or did we merely discover it in nature?
