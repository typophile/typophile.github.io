    format True Type works, <BR>so maybe you could try to use TTs. <BR>Toodle Pip,

  body: PostScript requires some reformatting from Mac To PC but TT or Opentype should
    be fine.

  body: 'Thanks guys, <BR> <BR>Yeah, Opentype works fine &#40;I think OTFs are entirely
    cross-platform anyway, aren&#39;t they?&#41;. Haven&#39;t tried TT as I never
    use TT fonts for work &#40;old school prejudice&#41;. <BR> <BR>But -- this, from
    <a href="http://www.macdisk.com/fontsen.php3" target="_blank">www.macdisk.com/fontsen.php3</a>:
    <BR> <BR>&#39;Indeed, for some time, it was already possible to put PC fonts &#40;True
    Type <i>as well as Type 1</i>&#41; in the font folder of some Adobe applications,
    like Illustrator and InDesign. The drawback was that the fonts were only visible
    for those applications, and not from all other.&#39; <BR> <BR>I&#39;m sure I&#39;ve
    heard this elsewhere as well.  <BR> <BR>R'
