  titles from the Fresh Prince and 21 Jumpstreet, Michal Jackson's BAD, and so on.
  NOT looking for graffiti typefaces, but custom made logo-marks - the further away
  from street-culture = the better.\r\n\r\nPlease help and attach links or images
  if possible.\r\n\r\nThanks!"

    in the gang\" then you got work from the real old school graffiti artists here
    are some artists from that time: dondi, daze, seen, taki 183. You can also check
    a book called \"subway art\" from Martha Cooper.\r\n\r\ngood luck"

    but by people outside of the culture."
