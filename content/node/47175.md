  working on a logo for a company which will distribute and sell the carhartt clothes
  (both work and street) via online shop in slovakia.\r\ni made this bunch of logotypes
  and now i can't decide which one fits best for this kind of company. \r\ni drew
  all the letters myself except of the version L - that is avenir.\r\n\r\nwhich one
  would you choose?\r\n\r\nthank you. \r\n"

  body: "Many of these could work...and given that fashion often uses interchangeable
    logos, perhaps a set of these would work.\r\n\r\nIn terms of the 'roots' of carhart
    (ag/industrial), I think E, I, and J are all contenders, with J maybe being that
    nice blend/crossover market angle."

    hand-drawn.\r\n\r\nmy personal favourite is version O, don't know why, it just
    feels good. i think i am not gonna look at them for a week or so and then i'll
    see which one will catch my eye."

  body: 'I like the way G hangs together and is centred without being too symmetrically
    dull, but it needs some refinement: the "l" is too much like "c", and the "a"
    too much like "d".'

  body: "Haha, didnt make out(bad eyesight?!) it had letters labeling each logo. What
    I was trying to indicate in my desciption was of course the logo labeled H, G
    would do as an alternate logo.  \r\n\r\nI love type!"

  body: I like the script type ones, i.e. G, H, J, K. Although I would probably slightly
    open up the space inside where the 'a' joins the 'r'.
