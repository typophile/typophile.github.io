  body: "When you posted this before I did a lot of searching for the script font,
    but I didn't find it anywhere in the stuff I had. I will try looking some other
    places, but i am interested in this answer too. At first I thought it might be
    from Jukebox at Veer, and then I looked at other scripts there with no luck.\r\n\r\nIt's
    definitly a font, as far as I can tell, but I haven't been able to pin it down.\r\n\r\n-
