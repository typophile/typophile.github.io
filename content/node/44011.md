body: Hi everybody. I'm working on one of 3 routes for a pitch for a UK government
  initiative to assist those who have been out of work due to disability, illness
  or personal circumstance, to get back into work. Although I have my own reservations
  about the suitability of such a device, the route I am working on uses a cartoon-esque
  character to convey the message. The character strives to be friendly but not patronising.
  Whether it achieves this ain't up for discussion. I do need some typographic advice
  though! I'm currently using Gill Sans Bold, which although perfunctory in this execution,
  feels uninspired. I played with some marker-pen type forms but this gave the piece
  a teacher-feel, which is a big no-no. The type should be direct, clear, bold, simple,
  unfussy and friendly. The demographic includes the aforementioned unemployed and
  various health professionals. Anybody got any suggestions? Time is of the essence!
  Thankyou.

    I'd argue that Gill Sans meets that requirement."

    FontShop's current freebie, and has a suitably bold, rounded look, perhaps? A
    little narrower than the other options so far, but characterful...\r\n\r\n_________________________________________________\r\nEver

  body: "Aluminium - I agree...Exec creative director doesn't though. 'Something like
    the Orange font' would be more suitable apparently. Which would be Helvetica Ultra
    thin I think. Hmmm. I say no way!\r\n\r\nUnit Rounded works well. As I have about
    2 hours to prepare about 10 executions, I probably shalln't be experimenting much
    more...\r\n\r\nThanks everyone for your suggestions. I'm a total newbie to this
    site... really impressed by rapid and helpful response...nice one. \r\n"
