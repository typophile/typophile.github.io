  I came to design rather obliquely, so to speak, I was never given a proper this-is-how-you-prepare-and-format-a-portfolio
  lesson. \r\n\r\nCan anyone point me in the direction of some resources on how best
  to prepare a portfolio? I can't seem to find much else beyond people selling the
  binders/cases themselves. Thanks!\r\n\r\nOther info:\r\n\r\n-This would be for book
  cover design. \r\n-At this stage I only have hard copies of some books and digital
  files for others (i.e., no cover flats).\r\n"

    mounted work and then placed in a huge $200 portfolio case that you then log around
    all over the place.\r\n\r\nEveryone does this once, and then realizes it's absurd
    and just takes actual sample pieces or 8 x 10 printouts.\r\n\r\nI imagine there's
    this portfolio-case industry cartel that secretly bribes art school professors
    while they're off on their summer sabbaticals."

  body: "I agree with Aluminum, portfolio cases are a nightmare, and there\u2019s
    nothing worse than watching eyes roll while you fumble around with boards. The
    best portfolios that I have seen are small spiral-bound books, these have the
    advantages of being easy to make and laying flat during an interview. Binders
    with sleeves are nice if you want to interview at a lot of different places and
    be able to swap pieces around, but they\u2019re also outrageously overpriced,
    and the prices on the sleeves themselves are even worse."

    in iPhoto and ship it off to Apple to be bound in a book.

    And that way if a client wants to hold onto it for a few days - or loses it -
    you aren't $h!t out of luck.\r\n\r\nBut I still use a binder, haven't gotten around
    to updating it in awhile."

    it is a standard size used by architects, etc. There are many quality papers you
    can print to, including photo papers, so image quality can be whatever you want
    it to be.\r\n\r\nBruce Hale, an awesome lettering artist and graphic designer
    here in the Pacific NW, showed my class how he does things and he uses 11\"x17\"
    exlusively for presentations, proposals, portfolios, etc."

  body: "Once my teachers saw the results, they started recommending every student
    to do their portfolios up in that way. It serves 3 purposes: You learn how to
    effectively present information, i.e., your portfolio; you learn how to prepare
    a press ready document with full bleeds, etc in a non-mission critical environment;
    and it looks professional when complete.\r\n\r\nImagine going to an interview
    and handing over a full-bleed, full-color book with glossy cover as your portfolio?
    Awesome."

    allowed to use a Muji A3 binders with sleeves. All transparent plastic and very
    disposable. You change the content twice and the binder starts falling apart.
    Not too expensive though. Well, not near $200 at least. To be honest I think we
    dedicated too much time to how to prepare portfolio (and how to prepare a degree
    show). The issue doesn't deserve that much time and in my opinion students should
    be given a bit more creative space. \r\n "

    No amount of preparation will disguise a portfolio of crap, but a crap portfolio
    of great work still gets noticed. Of course it does depend on where one is interviewing\u2014most
    design firms are pretty laid back and can be taken aback by someone who isn\u2019t
    as disheveled as the employees often are, but I would expect that the Madison
    avenue types are still pretty picky."

  body: I am a graphic design undergrad, and what I have seen more and more over the
    past couple of years are handmade books. Students are buying relatively good quality
    wide-format photo printers (Canon i9900, Epson 1280) and self-printing and assembling
    portfolio books that basically become portfolio pieces in themselves. Any thoughts?
    Has anyone else noticed this trend? I'm glad to hear some outside commentary on
    portfolios (besides the information that I hear at my school and in my design
    community).
