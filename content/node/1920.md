  body: a. Sabon Next. <BR>b. Sabon Next. <BR>c. Sabon Next. <BR> <BR>An alternate
    choice for the display size would be 1530 Garamond, but it isn&#39;t for sale
    at the moment. <BR> <BR>Apparently Adobe may yet release Robert Slimbach&#39;s
    magnum opus Garamond revival, which has been in the works for more than ten years.
    <BR> <BR>For me, one of the principal criterion in selecting a Garamond would
    be the italic. I&#39;d want an italic based on Garamond&#39;s not Granjon&#39;s.
    That said, I&#39;m currently reading a book set in Linotype Granjon, and rather
    like it.

  body: I was surprised that nobody had mentioned Sabon, Monotype Garamond or Berthold
    Garamond. <BR> <BR>I&#39;m not surprised that Stempel Garamond rated highly, but
    I have to say that I&#39;m not overly fond of it. I think it is just too &#34;chiseled&#34;
    for my taste as to what I want as a book face. There are even more chiseled looking
    faces that I like plenty, but not for book text. <BR> <BR>I would also note that
    as a typeface design, Adobe Garamond Pro &#40;OpenType&#41; is essentially the
    same design as Adobe Garamond. <BR> <BR>Normally I can&#39;t comment on unannounced
    projects, but Rob&#39;s Garamond revival is one that we have actually previewed
    in public. I will say that it is his top priority major project. I can&#39;t comment
    on a timeline, but it&#39;s getting plenty of attention and I don&#39;t expect
    it to end up on the back burner again. <BR> <BR>a&#41; Since I always have all
    Adobe typefaces, the one I&#39;d go out and buy would be Sabon Next. <BR> <BR>b
    &amp; c&#41;  Can&#39;t answer at this time. Would have to do a more careful evaluation
    of Sabon Next, and will soon be competing with our new project. <BR> <BR>Cheers,

  body: I don&#39;t think Sabon Next is a better choice than AGaramond. It&#39;s very
    contrasty and hard on the eyes. The Display version is just a bit too light at
    11 point, but the Regular is way too dark.  AGaramond seems just right, at least
    on my particular laser printer, but you have to use it at one-half point larger
    size to match Sabon Next.

    that it&#39;s hugely useful to list Sabon Next, and I&#39;m sure others might

  body: I think you have to do it based on the design at least as much as the name.
    Sabon qualifies more than many typefaces that are merely named Garamond. For example,
    ITC Garamond&#39;s relationship to the original seems barely more than nominal.

    be using the display version at 11pt anyway, but if the regular seems too dark
    this may simply be the way your printer handles it. In print, i.e. offset printed
    at 2400 or 3600 dpi, the regular is not too dark at all; in fact it can be a little
    light. I still think it is the best Garamond revival. Of course, I have a soft
    spot for <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/tiro/1530-garamond/">1530 Garamond</a>,
    but it is probably too authentic for daily use.

  body: 'I found strange to decide that a particularly weight of a particularly typeface
    is too light or too dark after tests on a particular laser printer. <BR> <BR>For
    example: to my experience, Apple laser printers give very bold type when HP laser
    printer give the reverse. <BR> <BR>And, specially, when the final output is offset
    litho, on a particular paper, what you&#39;ve got on a laser printer is irrelevant
    at all. <BR> <BR>If I comeback to Garamond question, I can say that Adobe Garamond
    was my prefered Garamond until I discovered that the general effect is too wide
    and too Italian compared to original French Garamonds &#40;from the various original
    books I had in hands from Estienne and others at the Imprimerie Nationale&#41;.
    Then, Stempel one, despite its angular shapes and Berthold Garamond despite not
    very available today as before, seems booth better. <BR> <BR>&#40;don&#39;t miss

    But some friends have say to me that german printers like pale printing &#40;?!
    the black ink is a bit grey&#41; So, I wait for the second edition due in next
    couple of days-weeks to see. <BR> <BR>The Prix Charles Peignot book &#40;composed
    in Sabon Next too&#41;, is better inked to my eyes. <BR> <BR>What can be wonderful,
    is too see a book composed with various Garamonds available on the market, each
    used at their best size. From the &#34;1530&#34; to the Berthold, Stempel, A Garamond,
    Sabon Next, etc. The result will be appealing to the eyes as old books can be.

    was complaining that Sabon Next was too dark, but we speculated that this was
    due to his laser printer. Stephen suggested that dark type can be a good thing,
    as demonstrated by Fred Smeijer&#39;s types, but I think there is a difference
    between type that is intended to be dark and type that just ends up that way because
    of a printer.
