body: "Hello again,\r\n\r\nMAQ is a company that is going to start giving out certificates
  for nurses and other people in the medical field. The certificate is for treatment/handling
  of prescription drugs, dosage and things like that for patients.\r\n\r\nThey take
  a test and if they pass they get a certificate that shows they are capable of handling
  prescription drugs.\r\n\r\nAnyway, I sort of mentioned the first idea that popped
  into my head to the client. That perhaps some version of the round stamp/seal that
  you usually see on old certificates, could be a nice logo. She really liked it for
  some reason but I hadn't really thought through how that would look exactly.\r\n\r\nSo
  the first versions I drew is suppose to remind one of the stamp.\r\n\r\nI would
  like to hear your opinions about the feather pen and the leaf. The pen would relate
  to the signing of the certificate making it official. The leaf would stand for growth
  and education. Is it to far of a reach or do you think this idea could work?\r\n\r\n\r\nThese
  sketches are pretty rough.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPeter\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/maq_concepts_4928.jpg]"

    but of all of them it seems the least related to certificates + prescription drugs
    - but keep it for some sort of eco-minded literature company. :D\r\n\r\nUnfortunately
    I'm not familiar with the certificates that you're referring to (and referencing
    here) - so I can't say how much they would or wouldn't remind me of those.\r\n\r\nAlso,
    it's also not entirely clear to me why some of them (2,5) have the little green
    \"collar\" at the bottom of the ring.\r\n\r\nThe leaf/feather is great though.
    It just doesn't seem to suggest medicine.\r\n\r\nC"

  body: "The feather/leaf icon is kinda interesting, not really for medicine. In addition
    I think you have to make the leaf a tad bit smaller. The size relation is off.
    \r\n\r\nAs for the rest of the stamp idea. I don't think they read as certificate
    stamps. #4 looks like a cross/hill and sunrise. #2 could work, but I don't understand
    the little green collar. #3 seems busy and to abstract. #5 I just don't like.
    It looks heavy. #6 you said it...alien like. You gotta keep in mind how this will
    work in black/white. #2 works the best out of all them. \r\n\r\nThe visual I saw
    when you mentioned the stamp on an old certificate seemed more organic, not so
    polished. Just some thoughts.\r\n\r\n\r\nwww.holadesignstudio.com"

    note on the name.\r\n\r\nMAQ is not going to be the name of the company. MAQ is
    the name of the research project that will set the base for the company. The real
    company name is still secret.\r\n\r\nIn this version I've replace the name with
    another word that has the right first and last letter of the real name.\r\n\r\nSo
    this is what I'm thinking now. The squares and the ball in the middle is supposed
    to symbolize the five Scandinavian countries that this company will cooperate
    with. The ball being Finland and the rest Sweden, Norway, Denmark and Iceland.\r\n\r\nFound
    a type that I think will work FF Sanuk.\r\n\r\nI want it to be a little stiff
    and not too organic like my first drafts. Also calculating drugs involves a lot
    of math and the test is basically a medical math test.\r\n\r\nHaven't picked any
    colors yet or done nay kerning.\r\n\r\nThis is by far my most difficult logo work
    so far.\r\n\r\n [img:sites/default/files/old-images/maq_logo_v1_3464.jpg]\r\n\r\n\r\nfeedback

  body: "Wow, out of those two, I like the first one better. I think that if you are
    trying to represent all the Scandinavian countries being in cooperation, they
    should definitely be connected. It also reminds me a little of all the plastic
    breakaway attachments and covers on medical sterile medical equipnemt.\r\n\r\nAs
    for the type, I'm having a problem with the \"R\". All the other letters have
    straight lines in them, and the Rs are curved on the tail. I know you are keeping
    the company name secret, but if we saw what the word really looked like, I think
    we could judge better.\r\n\r\nAs for colors, I would recommend blue and white,
    definitely. Maybe with a tiny bit of red.\r\n\r\n-Andrew Welfle"

    the real name is shorter and it looks better with the graphic then this does.\r\n\r\nI'm
    not sure if they will like this idea at all. They are highly educated people so
    don't know how they will see this.\r\n\r\nRight now I don't mind the R's because
    I think they give something extra to the type and the graphic as a hole.\r\n\r\nGoing
    to try some color variations. Blue being on the Finnish flag might be a nice addition.\r\n\r\npeter"

    for the cross I was the one pushing that idea to try and get the certificate seal

    I mention a cross they don't sound very convinced. From the first meeting I got
    the feeling that they don't want the logo to relate to anything medical, which
    is a little strange.\r\n\r\nI had the client on the phone the other day and I
    pitched this latest idea to her and I got nothing. I'm having some trouble getting
    an accurate idea of what they want. The only thing that she felt excited about
    was a certificate seal/stamp with tufts on it, feel like she was visualizing clip
    art and not a logo.\r\n\r\nSo now I've had my rant.\r\n\r\nTried replacing the

    is to give certificates in the hole of Europe. Can't really incorporate this into
    the logo either since it's just a goal.\r\n\r\nI'm starting to think that they
    commissioned a logo too early. The name that is secret is not a future name like
    I was told in the beginning it's just a unapproved proposition if it becomes a
    company which also is uncertain. They might also become an organization and then
    there will be some another name. The name MAQ will only stick as long as it's
    a research project. \r\n\r\nThey don't seem to want the symbol to relate to anything
    pharmaceutical. Right now I have no idea of what they want exactly. They said
    that they will show the logo to some people and get some feedback then get back
    to me in two weeks. I've made some written suggestion on where I would take the
