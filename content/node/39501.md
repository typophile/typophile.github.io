  body: "Hey Skippy,\r\nI have no idea about the 2nd one \u2026\_looks a little bit
    self-made: is the \u2018n\u2019 an upside down \u2018u\u2019?\r\n\r\nBtw., Beton
    is one hell of an inconsistent family! \r\nType IDer: \u201CTell me, does the
    \u2018A\u2019 have a left-pointing top serif?\u201D\r\nLight: \u201CYes.\u201D\r\nRegular:
    \u201CNo.\u201D\r\nDemi/Medium: \u201CSure.\u201D\r\nBold: \u201CNope.\u201D\r\nBold-Condensed:
    \u201CWell, yes!\u201D\r\nExtra Bold (by URW/E+F): \u201CNo way!\u201D\r\nExtra
    Bold (by Creative Alliance): \u201CYes, and now shut up.\u201D\r\n "

  body: "Florian - interesting about the differences in Beton. Guess the only thing
    consistent in life is inconsistency.\r\n\r\nStefan - Lunda Modern is indeed very
    close. Thing is, this is going to be shrunk down to the point where only the most
    discerning eye would be able to tell it's not quite right."
