  body: "I think this looks like the result of mangling Courier with a font program.
    The A and distorted S are evidence of this origin. The uneven legs on the 'n'
    would be easily done by moving some outline points, and I think the same is true
    about the other letters.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
