  body: "I'm not at all surprised that the license for including a font in an application
    is higher than licensing one copy of the font, since now the font will be used
    by everyone who buys a copy of the application - even if it is not directly accessible
    for use in other applications. (Word processors and graphics programs often come
    with full copies of fonts, usable by any application on the same computer. Their
    makers pay quite a bit to license those fonts.)\r\n\r\nThis is not at all the
    same thing as you using the font, and making documents with it. You are literally
    reselling the font, from their point of view."

  body: 'It is my understanding that app licensing and other independent software
    vendor licensing requires more legal expertise and negotiations for contracts.
    I wouldn''t know from personal experience. The bottom line is if you think that
    the price is too high, don''t pay it. At some point foundries and resellers will
    come to understand that this kind of pricing won''t fly. Alternately, there will
    be enough people willing to pay the price and things won''t change.  '

  body: 'If you are selling an app -- or making one available free on an ad revenue
    basis -- then you are making money from each copy of the app licensed to an end
    user. That means that the font embedded in the app is adding value and contributing
    to your income from each copy of the app licensed. So app embedding font licensing
    reflects that, and quite rightly: pricing reflects added value.'

  body: 'A book is a static text, and the font is not being ''used'' by the reader
    of the book. A font embedded in an app is, typically, being used by the app or
    by the end user in a variety of ways, e.g. displaying dynamic text or actually
    creating text. This is pretty straight-forward code licensing from the perspective
    of an app developer, like licensing an API or DLL. There''s a pretty basic cost/benefit
    analysis to be made that is the same for fonts as for other embedded code: roll
    your own, license from someone, or find an open source or free option.'

  body: "I can maybe see an argument for content creation...if the app is, in turn,
    creating media using the fonts. \r\n\r\nFor just displaying text, though, I find
    it more of an arbitrary distinction from any other use of 'displaying text' in
    the analog world. \r\n\r\nI agree totally on the cost/benefit analysis. "

  body: "<em>For just displaying text, though, I find it more of an arbitrary distinction
    from any other use of 'displaying text' in the analog world.</em>\r\n\r\nYes,
    in this respect the analogy is closer to that of webfont. But if part of the complaint
    re app embedding licensing for fonts is that it is too complicated, trying to
    make a licensing distinction between apps that display text and apps in which
    text is created seems unlikely to simplify anything.\r\n\r\nMind you, I don't
    think simplifying the licensing of fonts for app embedding is necessarily in anyone's
    interests, and I'm surprised to see some foundries trying to provide generic pricing
    for such licensing. Different apps have different capabilities and hence different
    needs, not to mention different value. It seems much more like the custom font
    development market in which I operate than the retail font licensing market, and
    I would expect any license agreement in such a market to be individually negotiated
    and subject to a particular agreement (as would be the case for most other embedded
    code). I understand that app developers might appreciate the convenience of a
    single license and pricing model, but that would inevitably mean that some of
    them would be paying more then they might otherwise, while others would be getting
    a great deal that fails to reward the foundry for the kind of value the fonts
    add to the product."

    that I have told are required for these kinds of licenses.

  body: "Just purely my POV/2 cents but a font for display text--be it in book form,
    or app form--seems to be the same business use to me. \r\n\r\nI may be wrong,
    but typefaces aren't typically sold based on the number of books sold that use
    them, are they?\r\n\r\nI'm not necessarily against the idea of licensing based
    on a percentage of sale, it just doesn't seem common."

    on the number of those who will make use of the font's compositional capabilities.
    \r\n\r\nI think this has been a great year for questions about how fonts are licensed,
    and a bit of a breakout year for ebooks, mags, and apps, while  game licensing
    of fonts just keeps humming along.\r\n\r\nSome might be puzzled by the unbelievable
    choice, but \"sorry state\" is, I think, a simplification. "

  body: Frode, pricing per unit is of course a sensible model, presuming a) there
    is a trackable distribution model for the app (such as downloads), and b) you
    can get the client to agree to ongoing payments.

    on this topic. We (www.monokrom.no) offer app licenses priced by units downloaded
    per month. It is certainly not a catch-all solution, but neither is licensing
    fonts for web nor print (think huge international magazine vs. student). With
    our app licenses, one of the goals was to offer a reasonable price for small and/or
    free projects. Up to 50 units downloaded* per month, the one-time fee per font
    is only slightly less than a regular 1\u20135 desktop license.\r\n\r\n* Meaning
    sold and/or given away for free.\r\n\r\n"

    trackable, but probably not for us. We are fine with that and trust our customers
    to purchase a suitable license. This is not much different from desktop licenses.\r\n\r\nb)
    We operate with a one-time fee, so this isn\u2019t an issue.\r\n\r\nMight I add:\r\n\r\nc)
    We are working on a solution for upgrades that allows the customer to deduct previous
    purchased licenses if/when downloaded units per month increases and they need
    a new license."
