body: "Following up on [[http://typophile.com/node/48608|these thoughts]], I've sketched
  (in pencil, pen, and FontLab) some ideas for my \"low-branching\" idea. Here is
  a FontLab example (ignore the horrible lumpiness), along with another idea on the
  left: instead of branching from the bottom of the initial stroke diagonally up and
  to the right, this one loops backwards.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Picture1_5038.png]\r\n\r\nBy
  doing this looping, the arch can spring from a more \"normal\" midpoint of the first
  stroke, but the whole retains the feeling of a letter written without lifting the
  pen off the paper. \r\n\r\nThe question arises: does the loop form a teardrop shape
  that will be too spotty and distracting to work in continuous text. (I did move
  the right side of the straight stroke in at the bottom to mitigate the thickness
  a bit."

  body: A geometric upright Italic is something I've never seen before, but I would
    definitely like to. This sort of thing seems to lend itself well to a humanist
    touch, but I'd love to see it done in a more machinated, geomtetric way. Not exactly
    sure what applications it could be used for -- maybe captions or footnotes?

    can also try to 'open' the loop, something like this:\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/enne_6218.gif]"

  body: "Thanks for the Auto link. \r\n\r\nRe: open loops, I considered that, but
    I thought a big open loop might push it further into the handwriting look than
    I wanted, and a small loop's counter wouldn't work in smaller sizes. \r\n\r\nThanks
    to you both for the ideas and encouragement."

  body: "The question about a distinctive feature is always: how does it relate to
    everything else? You only know when you design the other letters. \r\n\r\nAs an
    example, look at the recent 'Rocky' of Matthew Carter. I usually don't like pointy
    'a's, but here the way he relates it to everything else--compare the c and r--makes
    it work beautifully on this display font. It might not work so well in a text
    font, being too sparkly, but here it gives a very agreeable and lively bite to
    headlines.  "
