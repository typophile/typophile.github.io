I'd like to understand if it is clear what the intro is about. Specifically, that it is meant to be read from left to right as a timeline. Or should I add some visual aids to help guiding the viewer through the flow?

I went on assumption that an English-speaking person was going to scan the image from left to right, and given the content of the messages, it will be easy to recognize them as a sequence. It looks like I need to test this assumption on more people.

The reason for zigzaging is to allow for a larger font size without crowding things too much.

Ben, what I was trying to do was to show how the timestamping augmented and fit into a typical creative process flow. It is really a smaller part of the process, and I am concerned that putting it front and forward may assign it too much importance, and that would rub people the wrong way.

I do agree with you that having whole five items to read through might be a bit too much for an average Internet Speedy Gonzales. I was considering employing an animation to reduce the number of simultaneous on-screen items, but then the animations are harder to get right than a static banner.</div>

Bert, Darrel, I will give it another go. I had a version where there was a line waving up and down between the words, but it looked... erm... dorky... lol. Let me just put a simple straight line with five notches on it. It might just work.  

The arrows too I tried, to me it looks unbalanced:

Scribble some alternate arrangements? I'd try to put it on one horizontal line, but there are many possibilities. For instance since you say it's a small step in the process, I'm thinking you might try making the type smaller, and the type for «conceive» very large, but use color/opacity and the background gradient magic you have to get the visual hierarchy right, and shift the visual focus onto the small step that your tool focuses on.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Kim, Nina, thanks for the comments. The version with arrows was an example of something that I tried and that didn't quite work. I should've been more clear about that.

Here is a version with a timeline. I think it is actually starting to get there. The background and gradients still need work, but my main concern if the implied left-to-right progression needs to be hinted in some way.

		<div class="commentbody">Thanks, Ben. I agree regarding the arrows to a degree. Some sort of directionality hint appears to be needed, few people I polled noted that the timeline reference is not obvious. 

A simple animation would work, i.e. slide in Conceive, Implement, Record, Release and Assert from right to left in that order and assume the user is paying attention. Unfortunately for this option I just don't have time. So I have converged to the following version and this is what I will use for now:

In the end I converged to something far more simpler (not sure if the text is legible, but basically there's just a simple description of the site on the left and the invitation to join the beta on the right).
