  come across this type community and wish I had found it sooner. \r\n\r\nI'm currently
  a graphic design student trying to create a personal logo for myself, for use on
  a business card and other stationary. The logo is an ambigram. \r\n\r\nI won't tell
  you want it reads, I'd like to see if it is legible. \r\n\r\nAny feedback, good
  or bad would be appreciated. \r\n\r\nExcited to hear from you! \r\n- Melo"

    organic like your sketch in order for it to work.\r\n\r\nI'd also recommend adding
    a small loop and exit stroke to the 'o' (and by extension the base of the 'm')
    to make it read less like a 'd'.\r\n\r\n - Lex"

  body: I think an ambigram is appropriate if it speaks to you and about you as a
    designer. Before you start any mark, you need to be sure of what you're communicating.
    That is much easier said than done when dealing with your own mark (you know,
    I'm in the same boat...), but you have to do that first. Maybe try defining what
    your design style is, and what makes you unique as a designer. What specific part
    of design are you most passionate about? (For me, it was type, specifically individual
    letterforms, so I made a mark/image out of my initials, and the complexity of
    the mark speaks of the general complexity of my work.) If an ambigram is justifiable,
    it is absolutely appropriate. Just make sure you love your concept before you
    move forward, because for a mark like this, if you're heart's not in it, it will
    show.

    That said, I'm not sure why \"E\", \"L\" and \"O\" all have differnt widths --
    optically, \"O\" is wider than \"E\", which is wider than \"L\". I'd recommend
    a unified width for those three letter."

  body: I like that latest one. It would look great embroidered on a jacket, pin-striped
    on a motorcycle tank or maybe in the center of a phonograph record (recording
    labels are a place where we should see ambigrams far more often. They make more
    sense there).

  body: "The last one in your latest batch looks interesting. It resembles both a
    Chinese (or more generally, East Asian) seal and an Ancient Central American Hieroglyph.
    Now the question is, do you want that association? The \"Coca-Cola\" concept is
    entirely different, but not bad, either. It's like traditional Eastern influence
    versus traditional Western influence here. Which one is closer to your identity
    as a designer?\r\n\r\nI strongly recommend you to base your decision about the
    \"direction\" of the logo on what you want to express with your personally logo,
    and not just what looks better right now. Because in the long run, the one with
    the \"right message\" will grow in appeal, while the one with the \"shallow face\"
    will get old really fast."

  body: Either direction would be fine, but I agree that it should be that which best
    reflects you and your design. You will be able to push the one that is more true
    to you further, and more easily. Plus, of course, you want to be honest in your
    representation of yourself.
