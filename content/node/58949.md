body: "I have a freelance job for a small business that loves the font on their business
  card, but doesn't know what it is. I have gone through my books, fonts on my hard
  drive, identifont and whatthefont. Its sort of a mix - there is little variation
  in stroke width of the letters but then the cross bar is angled and has varied width.
  The other strange aspect is the serif - bracketed slab for most letters, but again,
  the 't' has a more pen drawn feel.\r\n\r\nI have taken a typography class but am
  definitely a novice, esp. when it comes to picking out poorly drawn faces or type
  that has been slightly modified (like in a vector program). The more I study this
  it seems it may be a combination of faces \u2013 but again I\u2019m just not sure.
  Any advice would be greatly appreciated.\r\n\r\nPS Just a big thank you to the creator(s)
  and anyone who posts on this site. My class was last summer, but this site (recommended
  by the professor) helped so much and literally saved me a few times. It has been
  in my favorites and a frequent reference ever since. Thanks a lot!\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/unknown-font_6344.gif][img:sites/default/files/old-images/unknown

  body: "I haven't been able to find this in the usual places for \"semi-pro\" fonts.
    This has the look of something one sees in \"4,000 fonts for $19.95\" CD's. I
    would feel safe in guessing that this comes from a freebie site, but it doesn't
    seem to be Dafont, unless I guessed the category wrong.\r\n\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
