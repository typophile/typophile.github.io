  to use to do some print design in 3D - fonts and objects in 3D. I would need vector
  export options / hi-res output with transparency if possible. It would be great
  if the software wasn\xB4t difficult to use for an Adobe CS collection user.\r\n\r\nIs
  there such a software?\r\n\r\nThank you,\r\nAlex"
