<p>If that university purchased Whitney for the other design consultant to use, should my design group have access to that typeface too? Or do we need the university to purchase another  license, as we are two separate businesses?</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I can see Gemma&rsquo;s dilemma: the licensing requirements for the font seem to contrast with the client&rsquo;s perception that they are buying the same thing twice for only one use. This is an issue that designers deal with all the time with all sorts of digital assets: fonts, photos, illustrations, original layouts, etc.</p>
<p>If a client requires that you use a typeface that you do not have, that may be an opportunity to have them purchase it for you (as apparently the other designer managed to do so). But no, now neither you nor the university have any claim to his font. I would say that most clients that do pay for typefaces don&rsquo;t fully grasp that this isn&rsquo;t necessarily something they get to walk away with.</p>
<p>Whether you want to openly press the university to cover the cost or whether you eat it as just the price of doing business (and thereby distinguish yourself from the other designer) is really your call.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Should an agency/studio pass along its font licence costs to the client?</p>
<p>Although the agency may get fonts for use on one client&rsquo;s job, it can subsequently use the fonts on work for other clients.</p>
<p>Is it unprofessional to use the same fonts on work for different clients? After all, if clients pay for an unusual font, shouldn&rsquo;t they get some measure of exclusivity? If the typeface is in more common usage, as Gotham is, why should the client pay for something that has little exclusivity, and will probably be used by the agency on work for other clients?</p>
<p>It seems to be a judgement call for the agency/studio, based on the re-usability of the fonts, and their cost as a proportion of the initial job expenses.</p>
<p>Perhaps it makes more sense to budget a &ldquo;new font cost&rdquo; factor as a general overhead into the hourly rate &ndash; unless one is going to restrict one&rsquo;s practice to fonts bundled with applications and OS&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>That may seem like padding to some clients, if all they want is in fact a bundled font, but in that case they&rsquo;re using the wrong agency/studio.</p>
<p>Even if you decide to make font licensing a general overhead cost, it may still be necessary to charge certain clients for exceptional font licence purchases.</p>

<p>In the end, your own billing practices are irrelevant. All that matters (ethically/legally speaking) is that all concurrent users of the typeface have a license from the type foundry.</p>

For fonts I plan to add to my library and continue to use, I pay. It&rsquo;s a business expense and I budget it in.

<p>Isn’t that a kind of (objectionable – depending on the EULA) resale? I mean: <em>you</em> licensed the font, for use on <em>your</em> computer. Thereafter, the client will likely use it on his/her computer. If another designer is going to continue the work in the future, will the client then ‘sell’ (=pass) the fonts to him/her? And back again?</p>

<p>it&rsquo;s not so much resale as it is : &ldquo;i&rsquo;ll arrange getting this for our job together and i&rsquo;ll borrow it first and i might charge you a little for the trouble&rdquo;&hellip;  or something.</p>
<p>it&rsquo;s cumbersome and confusing and makes strict EULA conformity seem almost impossible, which points out a big problem with the business model itself. 
if few understand it and even fewer like it - it&rsquo;s violation time.</p>

<p>Ha! Interesting loophole. I imagine the paperwork involved wouldn&rsquo;t justify it, though.</p>
<p>But, yea, in theory, one could just keep reselling the license back in forth, uninstall, install, uninstall again, reinstall.</p>
