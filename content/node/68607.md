body: "Dear typophiles,\r\nThe chart below is a summary of responses to the survey
  I posted here and on the ATypI list asking about our education and training. It's
  a very small sample, just 27 responses, and there's a subjective component in the
  interpretation of the data. For example, if a respondent indicated they were mostly
  self-taught in an area I gave the response a yellow box, but if a respondent said
  they studied a subject but learned a lot more on the job, I did not. My purpose
  was to provide anecdotal data to those interested in discussing this at the TypeCon
  Education Forum in August. A call for speakers will go out in the coming week. If
  anyone wishes to be added to the survey data between now and TypeCon, please contact
  me offline.\r\nMany thanks,\r\nJuliet\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/TypeEducationSurvey_5735.jpg]"
