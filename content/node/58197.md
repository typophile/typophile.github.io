  question but I would be very grateful for a few typeface recommendations.\r\n\r\nI'm
  looking for specifically for two fonts/typefaces, one to be serif and the other
  a sans-serif... but it is important that they are related in some way i.e. share
  other common characteristics. \r\n\r\nMy idea is trying to connote (through typeface
  selection) that something is simular but also different....two sides to the same
  coin as it were...two typefaces that look both simular and different at the same
  time.\r\n\r\nIdeally, I'm intending to use these typefaces at larger pt sizes, (i.e.
  16pt upwards) for short phrases....(not for extensive blocks of text)...so the font
  has to 'hold its own' against the surrounding white space. (I hope i'm making sense
  here!) \r\n\r\nI am aware this question is abit out of the ordinary, but if anyone
  had any ideas on this, I would be very grateful!\r\n\r\nMany thanks for your time
  and all the best,\r\n\r\nKim"

    with serif and sans serif designs that are meant to be companions, so you have
    lots of choices."
