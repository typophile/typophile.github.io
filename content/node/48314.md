body: "I'm wondering what to do about setting a long list in narrow columns when most
  of the list items are very short (FedEx), but some are very long (Middle East Studies
  Center of Portland State University). The list is some 600 items long. Wide columns
  would be lovely, but even at 8/9.5 Grotesque Light Condensed I haven't the space.\r\n\r\nSo
  far, indenting second lines seems like the best I can do. It's far cleaner than
  superfluous bullets or first line indents, but I'm not wild about it.\r\n\r\nAnyone
  seen this done well lately?"

  body: "The indented second line is a classic approach, it occurs to me that you
    could steal some leading and add some space between entries, possibly even a rule
    as well (in which case you wouldn't need to indent), the drawback with that would
    be a lack of aligning between columns, unless you could work a half line space
    in which might be too airy at the expense of useability.\r\n\r\nTim"
