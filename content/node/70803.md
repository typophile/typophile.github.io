  and am not familiar with the typeface used (\"IRCA\"). The client doesn't have access
  to the original design files/information. Would anyone here recognize it, together
  with its foundry of origin?\r\n\r\nThanks in advance,\r\n\r\nAndrew\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/irca-logo_4668.gif]"
