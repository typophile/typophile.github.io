  that one of the main characters was a font designer. I googled and found out it
  was not a typo.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.microsoft.com/typography/links/news.aspx?NID=5142\r\n\r\nWondering
  if there are any other movie characters who are font designers? Once in a while
  you catch someone who is a graphic designer or illustrator But even that is pretty
  rare.\r\n\r\nAnyone care to share their cinematic knowledge or is this the only
  example?"

    designed a font at one point. He was also designing web pages, Flash animations,
    etc. I think it was a "grunge" font.
