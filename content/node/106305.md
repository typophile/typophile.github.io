  I try to install/open one there comes up an error messaging reading, \"The requested
  is not a valid font.\"\r\n\r\nIs there any way to bring some of these fonts back?\r\n\r\nI
  think there's only been a small amount of data loss. :/"

    the fonts to the external did it do a complete file copy or merely a shortcut/alias?\r\n4.
    Does it happen with all the font files on the external?"

      glyph and Opentype information from the files, that would be fine."

  body: "Have you tried copying a couple of them back to your main drive, then loading
    the fonts?\r\n\r\nI suspect the problem is system-oriented and the font files
    are probably just fine. You might be able to find a good answer in the MS forums."

  body: Do you have FontForge installed? It may be able to recognise or diagnose something
    in the font files that the system is missing. If (you are positive) any of the
    fonts are subject to an open source license perhaps you could post one of them
    here for analysis?
