  body: "It\u2019s because in the old days, we didn\u2019t have the internet to ask.
    We had books, looked at them, and remembered them from practice. Simple <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rote_learning\">rote
    learning</a>. Take advantage of your resources, but if you always ask for help,
    you won\u2019t develop the same ability. \r\n\r\nA fun book to look through is

    a man a fish and you feed him for a day. Teach a man to fish and you feed him
    for a lifetime.\u201D</em>\r\n~ Chinese proverb"

  body: "Actually, although I do have a good collection of dead tree parts, I think
    most of my learning has been online. And because I asked. Or was wrong, in public.
    Same difference.\r\n\r\nPaying Attention is medium-independent. In fact I'm personally
    no fan of rote learning (even sympathizing with what Thamus told Theuth concerning
    writing in general). Which is probably one reason I dislike type-IDs.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
