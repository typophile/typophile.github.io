body: "This is the logo I am working with currently. The company it belongs to is
  a part of big wood processing group in Eastern Europe. All logos of the companies
  that belong to it look the same, so I can't do anything about the letterforms or
  colors. \r\n\r\nWhat I don't like about it but don't know how to correct is the
  negative space between character pairs r-a and t-d. I have taken the strictly geometric
  approach, spacing between all elements is the same. I tried to loosen all the letters,
  but it starts to look \"fallen apart\", and loosening only the \"ltd\" part attracts
  too much attention to it, although it has the least importance.\r\n\r\nWhat should
  I do or probably I shouldn't do anything at all?"

  body: "For the r you could bring the horizontal at the bottom of the arm further
    down than the first storey of the a and by curving the bottom of the t's crossbar
    and raising it (and the oblique) you could close that space, not to your standard
    space but slightly, the j seems slightly out of place, the curve at the bottom
    and the dot, you could try a (rounded) rectangle for the dot and make the body
    rectangular too. In the end though it is the differences that make the letters.\r\nTim\r\n\r\nAdd
    a swoosh, make it blue and you'll be there ;)"

  body: "Maija, don't worry too much about the uneven tone caused by the excess negative
    space between those particular letter pairs. Remember its a logo, not body text,
    so even tone and total consistency need not be prime considerations. It doesn't
    have to be perfectly even and consistent---logos are part design, part art and
    part compromise. \r\n\r\nThe narrow space between the letters looks the same as
    the stencil gaps in the letters themselves. I think you could comfortably space
    the letters out a bit by doubling the letterspacing. That will make the larger
    negative spaces appear less odd.\r\n\r\nThe curve on the j doesn't match the curves
    on the other letters; replace it with a curve from one of the other letters.\r\n\r\nYou
    can reduce the gap between r - a by compacting the arm of the r. Just slide it
    to the left. That component doesn't have to be the same width as similar parts
    elsewhere. I know, I know, its a modular design, but it has to be practical. Cheat
    to make it look right.\r\n\r\nThen widen the bowl (lower bit) of the a to take
    up some of the negative space under the arm of r. Next, narrow the arm (top) of
    the a by sliding it to the right. Then you can move the a to the left without
    it crashing into the r.\r\n\r\nTim's solution for the t is good. Paste the arm
    of the a onto the bottom of the t, then narrow it to make it fit. The bar of t
    is already much narrower than its equivalent parts on the a and r. Okay, so this
    logo was not totally consistent to begin with :-) Arms and bars on t and r in
    most fonts are much narrower than consistent modular proportions would have them.
    Your t was originally made narrow in proportion to the other letters.\r\n\r\nI
    would replace the sharp diagonal top of the t with a curve.\r\n\r\nAlso consider
    replacing all the square stem tops (b, l, d) with curves.\r\n\r\nTo be consistent
    and make the logo look fresh (contemporary), I would replace the Futura capitals
    \"WOOD PROCESSING COMPANY\" with a contemporary font.\r\n\r\nj a m e s"

  body: "I would worry about the spacing in between the _ra_ pair. I would worry about
    the spacing overall and make sure it is mechanically even. The open spaces within
    the letterforms set the pace for you to follow. The top version works more for
    me than the bottom. Why not have the tagline in yellow if that is where you think
    it is best placed?\r\n"

    perfectly even tone, but do what you can to even things out. Its art, and doesn't
    have to be perfect, but it helps to apply discipline for the sake of good design.
