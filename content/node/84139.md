body: "Hi everyone,\r\n\r\nI'm having a problem implementing OpenType features in
  web fonts. No matter what typeface or browser I use\u2014and I've tried several
  of each\u2014I can't get the CSS font-face property to listen to font-variant:small-caps.
  In every case, the browser synthesizes its own small caps by scaling the full caps,
  which of course looks terrible.\r\n\r\nThe typefaces I've tried with this are all
  open-source advanced fonts: Cabin, Cardo, Lato, and Sorts Mill Goudy, all of which
  support small caps at least in their roman, regular-weight face. I've used Firefox
  5, Opera 11.5, and the latest build of Iron (Chrome without Big Brother), all to
  no avail.\r\n\r\nIt's worth mentioning that other properties of advanced web typography,
  such as automatic ligatures (as well as the font-face property itself), are all
  working.\r\n\r\nYou can see my test page at http://www.utcolmus.org/test.html ,
  and the CSS file at http://www.utcolmus.org/main.css. Any help would be greatly
  appreciated!\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nBram"

  body: "There is no cross-browser support for this yet. That's why some webfont services
    and subsetting tools let you choose to subset the whole font (well at least the
    latin part) with small caps to give you a chance to use them. \r\n\r\nIn Firefox
    you can use small caps by calling the OpenType feature itself:\r\nhttp://opentype.info/blog/2010/08/14/better-web-typography-with-opentype-features/"

  body: "Update: apparently, the CSS3 specification that allows fonts to access their
    advanced glyphs apparently isn't fully implemented yet, even in Firefox, which
    is setting the standard for compliance. But Firefox has a hack built in, which
    is supposed to allow you to preview the ability of the browser to access these
    glyphs: http://hacks.mozilla.org/2010/11/firefox-4-font-feature-support\r\n\r\nI
    tried the Mozilla-only workaround, thinking it would be nice if it worked in at
    least one browser. But the workaround never loaded any small caps at all. I've
    updated the test page to reflect that problem\u2014look at the entries 2.1, 4.1,
    and 6.1: http://www.utcolmus.org/test.html"

  body: Hi Ralf, good timing! I've seen that article too. As far as I can tell, I've
    got everything in the syntax right. Maybe it can't be inline.

  body: 'I guess you stripped the small caps while generating the webfonts. I just
    checked one of the TrueType fonts, and it just has a basic 8 bit character set
    in it. '

  body: "Wow\u2014that's a discovery. I didn't even think to check. I built all my
    own webkits using Font Squirrel's generator, rather than downloading prepackaged
    ones. Maybe one of the options I checked did something wacky? I'll go back and
    rebuild the kits."

  body: OK, now I'm really stumped. I've tried a number of combinations, including
    downloading pre-made font-face kits and re-encoding my custom ones with every
    subset (except some language sets) checked. Nothing works, and the Mozilla hack
    always results in ordinary lowercase. I have no idea what could be causing this.

  body: "Did you try the raw TrueType fonts? Does it work there? Are you sure the
    small caps are now in the font and accessible via OpenType?\r\nI think with the
    Font Squirrel generator you would need to completely turn off subsetting, because
    the other options don't let you keep them. \r\n\r\nAs alternative, you can use
    the Font Squirrel generator to create a second font that has the small caps in
    place of the standard latin characters by choosing \xBBSmall Caps\xAB in the OpenType
    options. "

  body: "Sir Herrmann, you are terrific! Thanks for your insight. You were absolutely
    right\u2014the font subsetting on FontSquirrel was the culprit. Even with custom
    subsetting which (I thought) included all advanced typographic features, apparently
    some things are removed, and small caps seemed to be one of them.\r\n\r\nMy plan
    now is to use the Mozilla hack AND CSS3 specifications simultaneously, so the
    site is ready when CSS3 becomes fully supported. I'll remove the hack code thereafter.\r\n\r\nThanks
    again!"
