  series. The client was talking a lot about TNR Unicode and how it almost covers
  all the languages needed (Russian, Greek, Arabic, Hebrew, various languages with
  Latin script but special glyphs\u2026, everything bar Chinese and Japanese). I'd
  love to be able use some font other than TNR, but is there an option?"

  body: "Queneau, those don't have Arabic or Hebrew though.  I'm working on a font
    that's designed precisely for situations like this, but it's still a loooong way
    from being released.  Good to know though that it will have a market I suppose.\r\n\r\nThough
    I don't know any off hand, perhaps looking at fonts designed for biblical studies,
    as they should have at least the hebrew, greek, and latin, and if a font has greek
    and latin there's no reason it shouldn't have cyrillic as well.  Then you'd just
    have to grab a somewhat matching arabic font.\r\n\r\n<em>\xABEl futuro es una

  body: "Minion.\r\n\r\nWhen we bought CS4, two of the fonts included were (something
    like) \"Adobe Hebrew\" and \"Adobe Arabic\". Sorry, I'm at home & not planing
    to go back to work until Monday for once, but somebody can come up with the exact
    names.\r\n\r\nAnyway, the Latin character set included in these fonts turns out
    to be Minion.  To use them as full-blown fonts, you probably don't want to merge
    just the glyphs into Minion, since they only work as intended with the OT features
    in the \"special\" fonts. But the size of the characters and their fit will be
    the same as the Minion Latin characters. \r\n\r\nI do a fair bit of special language
    work with the Latin alphabet. I always use Adobe fonts, for the simple reason
    that the EULA allows the end user to modify the fonts, subject to some restrictions
    -- the modified font counts as one of the allowed copies, no redistribution, etc.
    \r\n\r\nSome other foundries allow this as well. I don't know if Miss Tiffany
    has updated her EULA listings. If you really want to use a certain font, is worth
    asking the smaller foundries, a few I've talked to (some under the Village umbrella)
    have no problem with such a EULA.\r\n\r\nMaking up \"special characters\" usually
    involves simply adding a diacritical, which is pretty easy. To have a properly
    encoded text file for any later \"repurposing,\" you do have to be able to modify
    the OT features (lookups) to get the characters without a Unicode codepoint, just
    how depends on the font editing program you use. It isn't that hard with most
    of them.\r\n\r\nHope this helps"

  body: "Thank you all! The problem seems to be just as difficult as I feared it would
    be.\r\n\r\nAndron surely looks interesting, I'll put that forward for consideration.\r\n\r\nAs
    for Minion, the idea sounds good, but the series will be typeset by different
    people, and the font should be usable straight from the packet, as most people
    (myself included) don't have font editing applications.\r\n\r\nIf it's TNR Unicode
    after all, how do I get that for my mac? Do I have to buy a more recent Office
    package (my current one is X)?"

    not actually the case. The Minion used in the Adobe Arabic, Adobe Hebrew and Adobe
    Thai fonts are specially derived instances from the multiple master sources, which
    in some cases have also been scaled to harmonise with the non-Latin design. The
    latter were designed, and then we spec'd a width/weight instances of Minion to
    serve as companion Latin."
