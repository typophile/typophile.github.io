body: "Hi again all.\r\n\r\nI have a customer who is using a typeface they found that,
  to me, looks like a cross between Helvetica Condensed and Franklin Gothic (with
  an enormous x-height, though they tend to use it in all-caps, so that may be moot).
  As such, it's a little bit like white rice. It needs a sauce-and-a-side that will
  bring out the brand they're trying to portray.\r\n\r\nAnd that brand would be old-americana
  and simultaneously high-end-and-classy. So I'm looking for a typeface, preferably
  high x-height, that plays well with what they're using and says that. I'm leaning
  toward things like this:\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/adobe/fairfield/</li>\r\n<li>http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/fontbureau/farnham/</li>\r\n<li>http://www.typography.com/fonts/font_overview.php?productLineID=100034</li>\r\n<li>http://www.google.com/webfonts/specimen/Kameron</li>\r\n<li>http://www.google.com/webfonts/specimen/Cantata+One</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\nSome
  Moderns might work if they have a reduced contrast between the thicks and thins,
  and if the serifs are a bit chuncky and non-delicate/fragile. Or some egyptians/clarendons
  might work if they aren't too Century-Schoolbook-y. \r\n\r\nOr, what works for you?
  Please help.\r\n\r\nFont sample of their pet typeface is available here: http://typophile.com/node/94619"

  body: "Farnham is pretty yummy dude, Sentinel is awesome too. But its hard to tell
    if it works without a sample of this Helvetica-Franklin hybrid. Farnham, Sentinel
    & Fairfield definitely says more class than Kameron so I'd rule that one out.\r\n\r\nchillyphilli"

    - great face, that.\r\n\r\nRiccardo - I shoulda thought of superellipses, they
    might match a shape. But nothing \"nostalgia but high-class\" there.\r\n\r\nThey
    went with Sentinel. I'm not displeased (although their sans, called \"Milford,\"
    leaves something to be desired).\r\n\r\nThanks again, all."

  body: "De Vinne can be considered a genre of typeface, and Publication JNL is typical.
    Looking at the ones on MyFonts, Romana* might be better, especially in your case
    since narrow = classy.\r\n\r\n* http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/bitstream/romana/\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
