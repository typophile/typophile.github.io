  Times uses is Gotham or something else? What serif face is the text set in?\r\n\r\nDon't
  have a sample so you'd need to have a copy."

  body: By the way, I'm loving the way this whole thread is red, black and grey. I
    think that's happened before. Anyone else (with a red black or grey picture) want
    to join in, you'd be most welcome.

  body: Actually, it occurs to me that these colours are often used for typographic
    stuff. Anyone know why?

  body: The first printing inks (Gutenberg) were red and black, though someone else
    (like Carl) would be better to explain why.

  body: "Nick, I'm here.\r\nAnd you should see my Flickr icon.\r\n\r\nI think the
    first/primary ink color was/is red [partly] because it's cheap to make, for some
    reason. AFAIK that's why farmhouses (being large, and needing constant repainting)
    are red. Hey, the Golden Gate Bridge too?\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
