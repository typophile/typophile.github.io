  body: "Spent some time in going through the usual suspects, and some lesser known
    ones, including digital efforts from the 1990s, and did not find a 100% match.
    \r\n\r\nHowever, Carisma Semi-Bold or Bold, with width compressed to 80 percent,
    is almost a perfect match:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/CarismaBoldDemiBoldCompressed_4344.jpg]\r\nIf
    you want to fish for similar fonts here is a <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/search/tag%3A%22Thick+%26+Thin%22/fonts/\">Myfonts

  body: "Hi Ryuk, if the font for the center part was squeezed, then perhaps the font
    for the outer part was expanded. Problem is that at this scale it's difficult
    to catch any earmarks.\r\ndon"

  body: Personally, I think it's all hand-lettering. Look at how different all those
    S:es are. It might well be based on a font, though.

    try expanding as suggested by don...apologies for the image quality- attaching
    a close up in another post...dunno if it'll help at all...\r\n\r\nThanks again
    for your help."

  body: Fair point birdseeding but I think diffs could also be due to the way the
    ink has taken to the fabric?
