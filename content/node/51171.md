  don't hold up at the sizes we commonly use for text these days. Many of them are
  revivals of older, metal typefaces, but are based on a model size that's much larger
  (12pt or 14pt) than the size at which they'll actually get used. The result is fine,
  light, wispy text type, instead of the solid, easily-read black type of classical
  book printing.</cite>\r\n\r\nSimilarly, we hear a lot of complaints about too many
  light anemic-looking typefaces being used in books.  Would it help to come up with
  an introductory list that people can refer to see what their options are to overcome
  this problem?\r\n\r\n1. MVB Verdigris\r\n2. ?\r\n3. ?\r\n\r\nRahim\r\n"

    the hundreds of excellent text faces designed specifically for today's workflow
    and presses, the old metal stuff, often poorly digitized, is still being used.

    now than it was in metal. That rarely has happened.\r\n\r\nBulmer, by the way,

    *However,* note that these are what FB is calling \"simple\" OpenType fonts --
    which basically means that they're just a straightforward format conversion, with
    minimal OTL features, kinda like Adobe's \"Std\" OT fonts. \r\n\r\nFB's sOT fonts
    provide the basic OT advantages of being single, cross-platform files with Unicode
    encoding (although the hacked ligatures, et al., are also still in their original
    positions for backward compatibility, and then duplicated with proper OT names).
    \r\n\r\nIn addition, there are a few basic OTL features, the most important being
    {liga} which allows all the double-f ligatures to substitute automatically now.
    The three basic fractions have been written into a {frac} substitution; the three
    basic superiors are in a {sups} substitution; and the two basic ordinals are in
    a {ordn} substitution.\r\n\r\nBut, for instance, no attempt has been made yet
    to integrate SC fonts with their Romans. That will have to wait for the development
    of ProOT fonts. AFAIK, the FB ProOT standard is still being finalized. I would
    imagine that Miller would be high on the list of FB fonts for re-development,
    but I have no specific knowledge.\r\n\r\nBTW, simple OT fonts are the same price
    point as the other formats. And I believe that if you already have a license for
    FB fonts in PS or TT format, you can get the equivalent sOT by request. But don't
    quote me on that. You'd have to contact the FB office directly.\r\n\r\n-- Kent."

    far more thoroughly than I the sciences of making typefaces and of reading them.
    So I'm going to go out a limb and see what you all make of a few ideas; there'll
    probably be some words that are \"non-tech,\" but I'll try to make the point.\r\n\r\nOne:
    Perhaps the \"busy\" and the redundancy Nick spoke of are essential to what so
    many of us want in book faces because they break up the uniformity of letter shapes
    and thus help them form into specific units (words) more easily. Maybe they also
    impart some basically recognizable features to specific letters. Some \"g-ness\"
    or \"q-ness.\" & those nesses help readers put them together into words.\r\n\r\nTwo:
    Perhaps there is some cultural familiarity at work here also. Perhaps readers
    come to \"know\" book faces (which are faces with these redundancies and busy
    parts) from early days of reading, and so these become established as \"book faces.\"\r\n\r\nThat's
    as far as I am able to go now. I'm already feeling over my head. But behind it
    I'm sure are some of the factors that have made me accept some faces and reject
    others for the work I do. I'm sure\u2013I hope\u2013there is something more to
    it than \"I don't like this type.\"\r\n\r\nTo Hrant and my original question to
    him: Perhaps in my general inclination to agree with you I am just echoing what
    I was told as a kid compositor. But there's some basis for it. Some years ago
    I learned that the Monotype house I used had TNR with long descenders. So we designed
    a quarterly newsletter with those descenders, and the thing did look notably better
    (letterpress). At this remove I cannot say if it read any better.\r\n\r\nI cited
    a few weeks ago in another thread the 900 pages I recently read in ITC Garamond.
    It was easy as pie, easy on my eyes. The most recent tome was 700 pages in Adobe
    Caslon, which I found more difficult to read. What gives there?\r\n\r\nBack to

    a really good question. My take on it is that different aspects have different
    advantages. \r\n\r\nSerifs have four advantages: \r\n1. Help the eye hold the
    line. \r\n2. Make the ends of strokes easier to detect. Tests have shown that
    the extremes in a glyph are more salient for reading. \r\n3. I think serifs also
    help to get even color while having wide enough spacing to relieve crowding. \r\n4.
    They also probably contribute to a distinctive \"word image\" better than sans.
    For example, a \"b\" and \"d\" are more different in a serif than a sans.  \r\n\r\nSome
    variations in design help evenness of color--for example, making the end of the
    r heavier than the end of the s. \r\n\r\nSome variations help break up the \"picket
    fence\"--the tendency of too much vertical emphasis and a dazzle, which is always

    we also don't proof with an imagesetter as much as we used to. When I got to Adobe,
    the type group had its own imagesetter down the hall, and we would crank out pages
    and pages of proofs to ensure that the weights of the text sizes were reasonable.
    Some time ago, we moved from one floor to another and lost the old imagesetter,
    and Adobe didn't want to keep chugging through the chemicals used for processing,
    so now we only get to proof that way once or twice during development. As everyone

    good at understanding that, it's Robert).\r\n\r\nIt was nice in the MM era, when
    one could just tweak the weight axis and have whatever they liked. Of course,

    most of the times at the book publishers we chose not to use the Adobe Garamond

    good typefaces to a variety of needs and demands. I even like the still existing
    practice of designing optical sizes and the quality has improved in that field
    as well.\r\nYou could argue about the actual *need* for all this improvement when
    you think about the world getting more and more digital and the *value* for the
    craftsmanship and the amount of work put into certain typefaces getting lower
    by the year.\r\nNot to mention that print quality has improved quite a bit since
    then, and it's really more the extreme ends of point sizes that need addressing
    when it comes to optical sizes.\r\n\r\nAll this must effect the type of education
    students get in schools when it comes to typography. Plus, students are not entirely
    clueless, they see what's going on around them, the vast majority of things to
    look up to and inspire by are digital or in some digital form or other.. so how

    and optical sizes and even good typography. Let alone appreciate the (price) value

    to benefit from this available practice in type-design and use it quite well in

    rather the Classical or Sentimental quality they are after. \r\n\r\nI hate to
    use the word Novelty in this context, but I can't help but thinking this is more
    what's on the minds of the designer/art director these days, or the aspiring designers/art

    there is more to 18th century printing than its roughness and relative distress.\r\n\r\nThe
    basic letter shapes of Williams Caslon are 18th century. It looks like \"Caslon\",
    it's named Caslon, and, to a similar extent as in Adobe Caslon, it has flexed
    serifs, and parses the uncoated-stock press gain of 18th century printing as both
    a softening of the outline and a reduced-contrast \"darkness\" that is the theme
    of this thread.\r\n\r\nThe technique, a complex drawing of each glyph, suggests
    the variation in cutting and randomness of printing artefacts that one associates
    with 18th century printing, as opposed to the subsequent sharpness and regularity
    of the Didone style -- and is quite different than the application of a thematic,
    reductive system, as in the design of Matrix or Charter.\r\n\r\nIt's not a 21st

    was to create a look that is \"contemporary classic,\" something with a timeless
    quality, rather than a design redolent of the era in which it was first created.
    I didn't want an \"antique\" or \"retro\" look. So my approach has been to adopt
    some features of the original look, which I think deserve reviving, while consciously
    rejecting others. Your account only notes the first, not the second.\r\n\r\nTo
    put it another way, my general approach to revival has been more like that of
    Matthew Carter's Miller, not that of Justin Howe's Founder's Caslon.  \r\n\r\nI
    was indeed inspired by the look of printed letter press, and have aimed to have
    my font, when printed by contemporary offset and direct-to-plate methods, possess
    some of the virtues of the letter press versions. However, I consciously rejected
    the 18th century look of clumpy inks and large ink spread due to printing on damp
    paper. My inspiration was the look of the ink and ink spread involved in early
    20th century printing. \r\n\r\nI also deliberately changed the look of 20th century
    metal type, as well. I did round external corners, as with letter press ink spread.
    However, I kept joins of branches sharp and unbracketed, contrary to the effect
    of letter press ink spread. Williams Caslon Text is more crisp internally, and
    in this feature, together with others, is a 21st century digital design, and not
    an 18th, 19th, or 20th century one.\r\n\r\nThe outlines, particularly of the lower
    case, do have a hand-modeled look. This modeling is designed to increase readability,
    and to achieve a welcoming, humanist aesthetic. It does not mimic the artifacts
    of Caslon's 18th-century punch cutting. I have seen the drawings of Mergenthaler
    Linotype Caslon Old Face, at the Printing Museum in Andover, which are based on
    blow-ups of metal type. These old Linotype drawings do indeed attempt to reproduce
    the irregularities of hand punch cutting. My outlines don't have this goal, and
    don't have these artifacts. "

  body: "Bill, your Caslon is a retro design.\r\nIt is in no way a modernization or
    post-modernization, but firmly in the tradition of 20th century old style revivals.\r\n\r\nHow
    can something that it is clearly recognizably as a \"Caslon\" revival be anything
    but a retro design?!\r\nDespite being revised at various times subsequently, the
    Caslon we all know and love remains an 18th century look.\r\n\"Caslon\", the collective
    archetype, is an 18th century typeface.\r\nFurthermore, the \"modeling\" you have
    employed, for purposes of readability, is strongly informed by the look of letterpress,
    which again gives the face a retro, antique look, as if the ductus, contrast,
    and serif shapes of Caslon were not cue enough.\r\n\r\n@William: <em>However,
    contrary to what you say, I consciously rejected the 18th century look of clumpy
    inks and large ink spread due to printing on damp paper. </em>\r\n\r\nI didn't
    comment on your rationale (and it should be noted that effects are not always
    as intended).\r\nI said that your face \"parses the uncoated-stock press gain
    of 18th century printing\", and could have added \"and earlier\".\r\nI suspect
    this is because you've followed the twentieth century manner of representing the
    appearance of old styles.\r\nIn revivals of later faces, such as didones, the
    tendency was generally to remove the trace of process and emphasize their simple
    geometry. For instance, the myth of the geometric Bodoni was long dominant, until
    ITC Bodoni in 1994 represented the letterpressed image.\r\n\r\n<em>I also, though,
    deliberately changed the 20th century metal look as well.</em>\r\n\r\nThe style
    of rounded external corners and sharp bracket joins, which you adopted as a representation
    of the letterpress process, has been in use since early in the 20th century, so
    you didn't change anything. As I mentioned, Goudy originated it. Benton used it
    in Cloister, his Jenson, in 1920. Digital fonts such as Bitstream Baskerville,
    and Monotype Bulmer, to name two digital 18th century revivals from the late 20th
    century, feature it. Your Caslon is similar to Adobe Caslon in its style of finish,
    although the proportions are different. Filosofia went further in playing round
    outside corners against sharp inside corners -- your foot serifs are slightly
    bracketed.\r\n\r\n<em>I did not attempt to ape the artifacts of metal punch cutting.</em>\r\n\r\nAgain,
    I made no comment on your motives. I pointed out that the irregularity, or \"modeling\"
    as you say, of your drawing (e.g. serifs are not uniformly copied and pasted,
    with that on the right of \"n\" being wider than that on the left) suggests the
    irregularity of punch cutting. And although your drawing does not reproduce specific
    gnarly artefacts, as Justin Howe's did, irregularities such as the beak of \"r\"
    that is slightly larger than the corresponding triangle in other letters (this
    detail is same-sized in many other Caslons) suggest an artefact of letterpress
    printing pressure, although that was not your intention. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    disagree that it is a recent digital phenomenon, there is nothing particularly

    of designing weightier serifed text faces, to compensate for the attenuation of
    the high-res digital-to-offset process, has been going on since the start of digital,
    and applies to both new and classic serifed faces. Yes, there have been more and

    Didot were earlier. \r\n\r\n<em>When you say that Goudy already did what I did,

    press just had to live with ink spread. <em>\r\n\r\nI have explained this before:
    the resolution of letterpress in Goudy's era was much higher than in the historic
    era (pre-didone). He was doing large drawings, not punchcutting at that time (his
    early career). Therefore he was able to produce letterforms which pastiched the
    vagaries of earlier, rougher printing. Look in<em> Goudy's Type Designs</em> where
    he described his problems with the technicians at Linotype who wanted to \"clean
    up\" his Garamond (e.g. straighten the slant on the vertical stem of \"a\"), because
    \"they had always done it that way\".\r\n\r\n<em>This means molding type in a

    it is not of your excellent typeface, but of claims that you are making for its
    originality which are exaggerated. Do you really believe that type designers for
    the past 100 years have not \"molded\" and \"modeled\" their drawing of type --
    especially in the oldstyle genre -- to both suggest and anticipate the effect
    of press gain? How does your drawing differ in stylization from that of Bitstream
    Baskerville or Monotype Bulmer?\r\n\r\nHere is Cloister, scanned from a 1920s

    I am well aware that because of the continual changes in technology, in order
    to *look* timeless, you have to keep changing. The effort to get digital revivals
    to actually look 'Classic' is the latest effort in a long standing one, as you
    say. One of the things I have done, reducing contrast, is part of the more recent
    efforts in revivals. I'm well aware that revivals of classics are of their time.
    Adobe Caslon, Founders Caslon are, and would be done differently today. I'm sure
    a late 19th century performance of Beethoven sounded a lot different than a late
    20th century one.   \r\n\r\nI don't know how original I've claimed to be, but
    I have claimed to specific things differently. A lot relate to readability, which
    you don't believe in, so I'll write about that elsewhere. \r\n\r\nThe example
    you give of Cloister I'm pretty sure is big. The point about a lot of earlier
    digital revivals is that they were based on larger sizes, where the ink spread
    makes less of a difference. One of the key things about doing classics right,
    in my view, is to reduce contrast in the 10-12 point area, not just in the 8 point
    and below range, which is where ATF did it. And Slimbach also tends to have pretty
    high contrast in the regular range. ATF was letter press, and the 'stroke' that
    ink spread adds was a kind of automatic optical sizing, in my view. So where I
    differ with Twombly and Simbach is that I've designed a regular size with lower
    contrast. However, it's not that simple, because actually my joins are pretty
    narrow. The look is influenced by the way the weight changes through the arches.
    \r\n\r\nAll the things I have done on this are only subtly different, but they
    add up to a different look. One of the things I am proudest of is that I think
    you can recognize Williams Caslon on the page from its texture, without looking
    at details. The differences are small but systematic, so they add up to a different
    \"look\". The other thing I am pleased with is that it doesn't look like anything
    else, like something that came out of Reading or KABK or Adobe. \r\n\r\nI do reject
    the retro label. I don't have a problem with retro, but this is not an exercise
    in nostalgia, and would be disappointed if that is the reaction. I hope readers
    will just see a comfortable, welcoming and highly readable font, not one that
    says \"18th century\" or \"old fashioned.\" Well, ok some of the swashes may look
    old timey, but they're not the heart of the font, and you can use them or not
    for a special effect.        "

    from have something that looks Caslon-ish, but it's hard for my eyes to tell,
    due to a combination of lack of experience, laziness, and poor quality scanning.
    Here, for example, is a paragraph from Google Books' 1897 copy of \"Dracula\":\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/dracula_caldwell_1897_6136.png]\r\n\r\n\r\nI

    derived from the 1860 Old Style Antique of Alexander Phemister. \r\n\r\nAs the
    Jaspert Encyclopedia of Typefaces explains, \"Its purpose was to cut a type that
    overcame what was regarded as archaic in CASLON. The serifs are slighter and more
    sharply cut. Stress is vertical, though not abruptly so. ...Ascenders and descenders
    are rather short.\"\r\n\r\nIn other words, Old Style was the first Caslon revival,
    though it was undoubtedly strongly influenced by current 19th century fashions,
    as Mosley points out. As you I think rightly note, it also does distinctly remind
    one of Caslon, even though it is substantially changed in some respects. \r\n\r\nAs
    I wrote earlier, that a re-publication of a text has to be in the same type as
    the era in which it was written is I think a questionable notion\u2014and in any
    case not a generally accepted one. I can understand not wanting it to look totally
    anachronistic, but aside from that, I think the main thing is to be readable,
    look good, and suit the mood of the piece. \r\n\r\nMy problem with Old Style and
    the many fonts derived from it is that I think they look dull. If you test one
    of the digital ones\u2014there are a bunch\u2014I think you will see what I mean.
    For me the original contrast is just a little too low, and the ascenders too short\u2014which,
    as Tracy notes, tends to make a face dull. Also short ascenders looks less \"literary\"
    in a book setting. I personally think they are less readable, but I know my view
    is very debatable. \r\n\r\nJust looking now at some of the digital versions, they
    seem rather high contrast compared to 19th century printed versions. See Bruce
    Old Style, Binny Old Style, and Old Style 7. Bookman is closer in being low contrast,
    but I think rarely used for books. Century Old Style is end 19th century and not
    so closely related to Caslon, but has perhaps more the feel of that era, if that's
    what you want. \r\n \r\nps. I would use old style figures with text. I notice
    that the \"Old Style\" font has them...\r\n\r\n\r\n "

    as it did in the era in which it was originally printed, for the printing then
    looked \"normal.\" In other words, true \"matching\" is, ironically, not authentic
    to the original feel, but adds a message of antiquity or nostalgia. \r\n\r\nSo
    the \"dialectic\" you rightly speak of should start with a recognition that mimicking
    is as a rule a poor idea. It is mimicking that requires a special reason, and
    not the use of a type that today looks \"normal.\" And if you choose not to mimic,
    then a wide range of possibilities opens up, many of which may be good ones. \r\n\r\nHistorical
    association is one factor, but I think it is generally best attenuated. If I remember
    rightly the Penguin Complete Shakespeare is in Plantin. But it isn't the original
    look of the first printing of Shakespeare, but of the 20th century revival, which
    looks \"classic\" and 20th century, when it was published. So the historical association

    the novel or play in Times New Roman vs Baskerville is going to make you think
    that differently about the characters in Huckleberry Finn or Hamlet. But a great
    film that has costumes and the look of an actor may make you think about these
    stories differently. I just think the influence of text type is less specific,
    less attached to the content of the story. It sets a mood rather than gives a
    specific historical reference. It is a step further removed from the content of
    the experience.\r\n\r\nI think the mood is more important than an historical connection.
    So, for example, I like Zach's idea of using Walbaum for Dracula, because it is
    a little unusual looking and stylish, so it might add to the general creepiness
    of the story. That Dracula was, in 1897, originally set in an Old Style (I checked
    on Google Books) I don't think is as important as the mood.   \r\n\r\nThe historical
    reference you can do more with display type, and I'm not against it. I agree with
    you that historical setting should be considered, but I have the feeling that
    I would put it lower in priority and you do, and I also think there's a danger

    it seems like there is a historico-philosophical parallel, despite the anachronism:
    both are rationalistic, but with an asterisk. Walbaum is the least strictly rationalist
    Modernist/Didone, if I'm not mistaken, and Dracula is full of characters who are
    too modern to believe in anything so mythical as vampires lurking in Eastern Europe,
    but find themselves forced to, written to readers who are similarly modern but

    You can't have it both ways, Bill!\"\r\n\r\nIf something classic is timeless,
    then having it belong in the 21st century isn't having it both ways - but having
    it \"retro\" <em>would</em> be having it both ways. If something is retro, it
    is ostentatiously dated, and hence not timeless. So I can argue that you have
    it backwards - although, in fact, something can be classic by having much in it
    that is of timeless merit without being entirely free of elements that are dated.\r\n\r\nOf
    course, Caslon really is an old typeface, and despite its popularity and merit
    which makes it a classic, the original face does have some characteristics which
    render it dated. A modified face, based on Caslon, can emphasize the timeless
    parts of the design and blunt the dated ones, or make the opposite design choice,
    and have something that is indeed 'retro' even if the timeless classic merits
    of the design are also present.\r\n\r\nAlso, I am surprised to see it suggested
    that a book ought to be typeset in a typeface belonging to the era in which it
    was written.\r\n\r\nIt seems to me there is no good reason not to typeset Shakespeare
    in Times New Roman, for example. Or <em>She</em> or <em>Tarzan of the Apes</em>,
    for that matter. The purpose of a type is to be something invisible to convey
    the words of the author to the mind of the reader, not to be something archaic
    with which the reader is not comfortable. You know, like a <strong>crystal goblet</strong>.\r\n\r\nThat
    being said, I also think that there are times when an exception is warranted.
    Thus, I would not at all mind curling up with a copy of \"The Well at the World's
    End\" or \"The Lord of the Rings\" typeset in, say, 14-point Kelmscott Roman.
    With generous leading, tight word spacing (which means words would be hyphenated
    at need), and decorative initials at the start of chapters (can you even tell
    a word processor to put the first line in all-capitals these days)...\r\n\r\nBut

    the thickness of the glyphs, but not with regard to features like reflection of
    the toner/ink and the kind of the black, which seem to be not less important than
    the paper and the quality of the fonts. The toner (of my printer) is on the paper,
    while the ink of the books is in the paper. So the text looks a bit raised, although
    the toner coat is thin. And therefore my prints are much more susceptible for

    I choose one designed in the 19th century maybe by a scotish type designer? maybe
    bookman oldstyle or something. I always have trouble with that.
