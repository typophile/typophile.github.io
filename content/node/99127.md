  body: LOL, but some letters look really nice, and besides this it would be the same
    if it was the other way around (i.e. drawing a Latin for an Armenian-only typeface).
    Unless you have enough cultural preparation and sensibility, you can easily end
    up doing a superficial work.

    Yes! Life is complicated.\r\n\r\n<blockquote>Unless you have enough cultural preparation

    abominations are carried out not by jingoistic westerner, but by Armenians!\r\n\r\nRelated:
    http://armenotype.com/2012/04/archipelago/\r\n\r\nAnd it doesn't help that the
    computer's copy-paste capability is well-suited to the very Armenian trait of
    saving effort... :-/  For example in that example the \xAB\u0576\xBB is a flipped
    \xAB\u0574\xBB - nevermind that the ascender ends up pointing the wrong way!  :-(\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    you know I am familiar with your approach, as you have been hammering it in our
    heads for \u2013 say \u2013 at least ten years\u2026 LOL I think it\u2019s good,
    but again it requires enough interest in the development of an original armenian
    typeface, not only in the latin part. :-)"
