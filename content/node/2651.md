    <BR> <BR>&#34;From the calligraphy schools of ancient China to the explosive new
    forms of David Carson, it&#39;s clear that type is more than just a vehicle for
    conveying information to the user.&#34;  <BR> <BR>&#34;Why should we care so much
    about this arcane art?&#34; - Nadav Savio. <BR> <BR>Out of curiousity, how many
    explosive typefaces did Carson actually draw himself? <BR> <BR>Arcane art. Is
    that a compliment or an insult? <BR> <BR>Overall, Nadav does a nice job considering
    his audience. <BR> <BR>bj

    In fact, everyone here has had the opportunity to teach someone else something
    be they small points or large. &#40;no pun intended.&#41; <BR> <BR>By definition,
    a teacher does not have to someone at a university or for that matter human. It
    only need be something that guides us further down our own path of discovery. '
