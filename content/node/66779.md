body: "The mission of Center for Advanced Design Research and Evaluation (CADRE) is
  to develop and execute relevant original research in the areas of architectural
  and engineering design solutions having an impact on: end users, including occupant
  well-being and user effectiveness; operational performance; and sustainability of
  the built environment. Dissemination of this new knowledge to end users and the
  design community is inherent in our organizational intent.\r\n\r\nAfter much discussion
  we decided the logo needed to be bold, technological, and organized. It could represent
  in an abstract fashion the ideas of dissemination, the center point for emerging
  ideas, a surveyors benchmark, form which new directions are established and buildings
  built.\r\n\r\nAlso, it is important to establish Cadre as a word and not just an
  acronym. Cadre vs C.A.D.R.E.\r\n\r\nMy concept originated from abstracted arrows
  that pointed to new directions, all emanating form the word Cadre.\r\n\r\nColor
  has not been applied yet. There is no budget for this. I am working on this probono
  through my firm.\r\n\r\nI would love to hear some thoughts from any one out there.
  Does it read? Should it be less legible? more? any comments.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\n\r\nC
  L Jones"

  body: With the parameters you have to work with, that is a good start. I like the
    fact that the isometric direction keeps changing. It looks too thin, though. I
    know that architects like slick forms, but I would doudle the weight of the logo.
    Try that and see if I'm wrong.

  body: "[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Arrows_Cadre_v14_3467.jpg]\r\n\r\n@ Tomi\r\n\r\nThe
    weight of the mark is something i have been having trouble with. If it gets to
    heavy it looses something, so finding that happy medium has been rough. Here is
    a heavier version.\r\n\r\n@ Cuttlefish\r\n\r\nSure it will fax. If you know how
    to operate a fax machine. If you are referring to the fact that the light gray
    might drop out, well you might be right. I will look at that when i start applying
    color.\r\n\r\nThanks guys."

  body: "This is looking interesting, but I'm bothered by the gray lines being flat
    rather than isometric. I say that as someone with a degree in architecture so
    it's something that stands out to me immediately.\r\n\r\nAlso, have you looked
    at it as one color rather than the gray and black? I think it might be a bit more
    impactful that way."
