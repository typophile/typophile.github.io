    $160, and we cannot afford it. I wish we could just buy one of four... Can anybody
    recommend any fonts that are close to Pretorian?\r\nThanks!!"

  body: "It looks like a condensed version of an old, predigital typeface called Romany
    was used. I know of no digital version.\r\n\r\nPretorian is DTP's revival of Pretoria.
    Seeing as to how they have no claim to the rights for Pretoria, I'll point you
    to Dieter Steffmann's version. He calls it <a href=\"http://www.moorstation.org/typoasis/designers/steffmann/samples/v/vivian.htm\"
    target=\"_blank\">Vivian</a>. No promises as to relative quality."

  body: Thank you so much of mentioning Pretoria. I was doing search on Pretorian
    and of course did not find Pretoria..., which we actually have on our Mac! (from
    Font Shop Berlin, if you are curious) Thank you, Mike.
