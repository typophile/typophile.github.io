  books, so offset printing is not even an issue. Anyhow: I'm luvvin this neat fluorescent
  red colour I came across and really want to use it for this project. What are my
  options?\r\n\r\nI searched the net for clever solutions, but couldn't find anything
  (except a printer cartridge called \"Canon Bc-29F\" with fluorescent ink \u2013
  but no further description on what results it gives). \r\n\r\nCheers."

  body: "Silkscreening is the same as screen printing. Basically large sheets of fine
    screen fabric stretched over a frame. Using photo emulsion you can burn and block
    out patterns into the screen which then, using a squeegee, you push ink through
    the empty spaces to make a print. It's fairly easy to do yourself, but you need
    a super intense light to expose the emulsion. I found a video of someone printing
    his already prepared screen. \r\n\r\nhttp://youtube.com/watch?v=qCZe9BWxCu0\r\n\r\nI'm
    not sure if regular printing houses do this, but there are probably studios in
    your town that will. Also you could hit up art schools and find a printmaking
    student to do it for you. This is how a lot of hand-printed t-shirts are made
    as well. I've used this technique for type in books before and it works really
    well. And like I said the ink comes in all sorts of colours like flouresents and
    glow in the dark. You can also print white.\r\n\r\nLook up \"silkscreen book\"
    on flickr for tons of images of small run books other people have done."

    solution, especially limited runs like 3 copies.\r\n\r\nIf you'd like to explore
    this option, these three are friends of mine:\r\n\r\n[[http://www.exquisiteletterpress.com/|Peter
    Fraterdeus]]\r\n\r\n[[http://www.boxcarpress.com/|Harold Kyle]]\r\n\r\n[[http://www.kennedyandsonsfineprinters.com/|Amos
    Kennedy]]\r\n\r\nI'm pretty sure all will take on custom jobs like the one you're
    talking about. You can do your set up on the puter and have polymer plates made
    for printing, with the ink color(s) of your choice. Pretty sure there are no limitations.
    The only setback here is that it's going to be pretty expensive, I think.\r\n\r\n"

  body: "I'd look into screen printing too...you could print the pages as a signature
    (ie, multiple pages on one large sheet) then trim and bind.\r\n\r\nThat said,
    the cost for both screen printing and letterpress is typically the set-up. So,
    both aren't really designed for runs of 3 or so.\r\n\r\nOne last option...back
    in the day (a decade+ ago in art school) one could by little sheets of custom
    color. They looked like foils. You'd place it on top of your laserprinted paper
    and apply heat to it, the heat would fuse the color to the toner in the paper.
    It was a way to emulate spot colors and foil embossing.\r\n\r\nthat might work
    if your use of color is in small amounts."

  body: "To clarify why I think letterpress is ideal for runs of 3 (as opposed to
    offset)...most commercial printers are not going to want to print a run of 3.
    There are lots of letterpress printers who would be happy to print a run of 3.\r\n\r\nAnother
    very modern option is the digital press that many small business printers have
    these days. I think the limitation here, however, is that spot inks are not possible.
    I could be wrong, but I'm pretty sure you're limited to the 4-color process with
    the digital printing technology.\r\n\r\n"

    It would be great to see some images.\r\n\r\nKoppa: I think I have to rule out
    letterpress for know. The book is more of a friendly gesture, and a young lad
    need some pocket change for womanizing, milk and cookies."

    you decide to screen print this yourself or send it out to a studio, printing
    could be a little costly. Especially for a friend job.\r\n\r\nIf that color\u2019s

    isn't very durable though, if it is the same I used to use. You would need to
    seal it somehow? And who knows over time\u2026\r\n\r\nAnyway, a hand applied wood
    block print could work in the right situation. Or any other low tech method, depending

  body: Another option you might consider is finding a press which has an Indigo printer.
    Indigo printing is a great option for short run printing. They can replace the
    inks with spot colors. I think it might be worth looking into for this project.

    time. That's probably a good bet. The solids are not the problem they used to
    be.
