body: "MIT did some testing on how long people looked at dashboard type to read it.
  They found humanist type more readable than geometric. They have narrower glyphs
  than geometric, based on circle-my take. Also Verdana, if that's what they used,
  has better spacing. \r\n\r\nCongrats to Carl Crossgrove!\r\n\r\n[[http://www.fastcompany.com/3028665/most-creative-people/introducing-burlingame-a-safer-font-for-your-dashboard?partner=newsletter#4|Here
  is an article on it.]] It's in the third slide. \r\n\r\nI would like to see a comparison
  to Clearview Highway, which used distance thresholds, as well as time, I believe. "

  body: Layout can make a legible typeface much less legible. All that whiz bang distraction,
    and lower contrast on the main message is an example of self-defeating strategies.
    I wonder where that dashboard design came from. I hope it's not real. Looks like
    they needed some more research :)

  body: "I don\u2019t think how long they looked at the dash is the acid test. That
    would be how many arrived safely at their destination, and if time is really the
    concern, how long it took them to get there.\r\n\r\nSome sort of rally/scavenger
    hunt would be a good experiment."
