  body: Was about to say "handwritten as the 2 /e are different" but it's [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/g-type/rollerscript|Rollerscript]]
    using alternate /[[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/g-type/rollerscript/smooth/glyphs.html#glyphs/556792/378|e]]
    and a possible alternate /s or /st ligature I was not able to find.

  body: Thanks Lex. Saw this one but thought it could have been something a bit easier.
    Or maybe it's a alternative version of Rollerscript and exclusive for 'Head &
    Shoulders'...

    activated; that's how it should be used.\r\n\r\nIf you want to buy it plase get
