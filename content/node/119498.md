  body: Olivine could have saved some money and standardized their brand if they had
    used Trend Sans--Trend Sans One is almost identical to Brandon Grotesque, and
    Trend Sans Five is very close to Pinstripe Limo. And Trend comes with an amazing
    variety of styles/variations.

    \r\n\r\nI'm trying to achieve a shadow effect like the attached font just like
    the attached\r\n\r\n jpeg[img:sites/default/files/old-images/98865_4831.png]\r\n\r\nAs
    there is not a Trend font with this shadow, how would I achieve this? Is it customized?\r\n\r\nThanks
    so much again for your help today..\r\n\r\nAppreciated,\r\n\r\nJason\r\n"

  body: "Actually, Trend Sans One (type) paired with Trend Sans Two (shadow) should
    do the trick (just change the color of the shadow type):\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/latinotype/trend/\r\n\r\nI
    believe you achieve the effect by typesetting two identical type blocks, one in
    each font, and aligning them one on top of the other."
