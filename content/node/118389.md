  body: "Confirming Kevin's guess of Futura with a custom /j. Baseline is also definitely
    set in Futura and to be precise should be either Futura from [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/futura|Linotype]],
    [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/adobe/futura|Adobe]] or [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/urw/futura|URW++]]
    (no [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/bitstream/futura|Bitstream]]/[[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/tilde/futura|Tilde]]).
    Type has also been slightly vertically compressed.\r\nThe rest of their identity
    uses [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/hvdfonts/brandon-grotesque|Brandon Grotesque]]
    (same kinf of /j as logotype but rounded, borrowed from it?), Times and Open Sans.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Untitled-1_5084.png]"

    And I can't believe I didn't figure Futura myself. What a rookie mistake. Wow,
    I must really be losing it. Thank you!!! :)

  body: daveward, I've seen Neutraface on this site so many times that I should recognize
    it on sight, but I still think it's something new every time. We all have our
    blind spots. Good luck with your rebrand.
