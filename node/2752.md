  body: I don&#39;t see the big deal with it. I loved the premise, but the execution
    seems a little convoluted. You are right, there are quirks, but not very nice
    ones

  body: One problem is that the italics is mechanically slanted, and 8 degrees is
    way too much to get away with that. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>

  body: OK. It&#39;s not just me. Thanks for weighing in on this. I&#39;m really searching
    for a type family to call my own &#40;for my design business&#41;. I bought Stainless
    and Dispatch a while back and told myself that was it... But, being a typophile,
    I can&#39;t stop hunting. Maybe I should stop and trust Stainless and Dispatch
    to do the job. &#42;sigh&#42;
