    of vintage, copyright-free illustrations. \r\n\r\nhttp://store.doverpublications.com/\r\n\r\nBut
    I don't know if you can download them, I think they sell their collections in
    books and CDs. Large books stores and libraries often carry a selection of Dover
    books in their art department.\r\n\r\n"
