  it's already been 13 years, and still going strong! We certainly wouldn't be here
  without the ongoing support and activity of this awesome community. \r\n\r\nHappy
  Birthday everyone!\r\n"

    Andreas St\xF6tzner for proposing the character in the \uFB01rst place and above
    all OP <strong>Adam Twardoch</strong>, who has made some of the most useful (and
    longest!) posts at Typophile to assist type designers wishing to expand their
    glyph and language coverage."

    big names) still don't get why a cap eszett is a good idea. I suspect they just
    have a hang-up against changing their precious alphabet in any way at all.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
