    apparently means something in French. (Anyone know what it means?)\r\n\r\nIf you
    can post a sample of this font, maybe we will recognize it by another name.\r\n\r\n-

    context I saw this, one was an article about DNA and genetics, probably means
    something like 'encoding'.\r\n\r\nAnyway, a picture of the font would be helpful,
    if you can show us one.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
