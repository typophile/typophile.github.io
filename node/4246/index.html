<div class="post-content e-content" itemprop=articleBody>Greetings, I need your help. Greetings, <br> <br>I have been a huge fan of Cassady & Greens Fluent Laser Fonts fort many years. I purchased the set of diskettes with the Postscript, etc. fonts way back when and have been using them ever since. As time went on I upgraded my Macs and now of course have no floppy drives. -- though I still have the diskettes. <br> <br>I have been using Gazelle FLF as part of my header and still love that font as well as many others. But as I copied fonts from one computer to another -- it now appears as GazelleFLF-fog. and just does not work any longer in the version of InDesign I am now using. <br> <br>I was so disappointed to discover that C&G is no longer in business. I am sad to seee that these fonts may be lost to the world. I have been trying to find Gazelle in a TT font for the mac -- I am looking everywhere. I hate to see this beautiful font no longer available -- can anyone help? <br> <br>Thanks, <br> <br>David (<a href=mailto:drice4@ix.netcom.com>drice4@ix.netcom.com</a>)</div>

<div class=commentbody>If you could post a graphic sample of the font in the type identification area of this site, I'm willing to bet someone could help you out. The font may exist under a different name or foundry. <br> <br>-Addison</div>

<div class=commentbody>I actually have these fonts also. Can't remember when I used them last. One of the first "collections" we licensed back in the day, the day we switched to mac. Hehe. If you do have the original floppies, I would suggest heading to a local Kinko's (or similar) and re-copy from the orginal to a zip or cd which you can read on your machine. </div>

<div class=commentbody>I don't have those - but the topic peeked my interest. During my education, the typography teacher told us about one of the first sets, I want to say Charlemange, but I know that's not it - and now I can't remember, but she mentioned that she has never ever been able to find a visual of the typeface (a career of about 20 years then) and placed to us a challenge to find it. Its been over 5 years now that I've known this, but I guess knowing the name would help eh? - if I heard it I'd probably remember again. <br> <br>In any case its always been in the back of my mind - this original typeface lost to the world...must find. Anyone know what I'm talking about and is there a visual somewhere? <br> <br>I know it starts with a C. <br> <br>To think a face is absolutely gone is odd isin't it. I heard that since Letraset stopped producing the transfers many faces are lapsing while they digitize only a select few. Scary thought, shouldn't there be a conservatory dept under the TDC, or FontBureau or something.</div>
