    I don't own my own press*, I rent a Vandercook.\r\nBTW my first generation business
    card** was light-on-dark,\r\nwhich is pretty tricky - although it's a lot easier
    on nice and\r\ndark black stock.\r\n\r\n* Although I do own two sizes of Pascal.\r\n\r\n**

    extra complication there was\r\nthat the ink was made using wine.  :-)\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    print shops:\r\n\r\nBoxcar Press: boxcarpress.com\r\n\r\nCranky Pressman: http://www.crankypressman.com/cranky_pressman/\r\n\r\nFor
    these places, you are best designing your own graphics or hiring a graphic designer.\r\n\r\nAlso
    google \"digital letterpress.\" Unless you want metal type, of course."

  body: "As Hrant said, you'll undoubtedly want someone local (and as I see that you're
    in London, there ought to be many options), but I can highly recommend a local
    letterpress shop here in Seattle, Day Moon Press. They've finally got a website,
    though I don't think it represents them very well as yet:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.daymoonpress.com/index.html\r\n\r\nI've
    worked with Maura & Jack many times over quite a few years; they are not only
    skillful but imaginative, finding solutions that use the varying levels of technology
    to good effect. For anyone in or near Seattle, or for whom geographical proximity
    doesn't matter, I can't think of anyone I'd recommend more. (And yes, that *is*
    saying something.)\r\n"
