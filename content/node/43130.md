  body: "The Maxim logo was drawn by Dave Farey. If it looks similar to the typeface
    Trajan, it's because it was also based on inscriptions on the Trajan column. Dave
    revealed in one of the talks he gave at TypeCon that it was right there in the
    stone:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/maxim_4950.jpg]"

    (font) than the original engraving. ;-)\r\nThere are differences, though. So,
    you\u2019re right about custom, Mark.\r\n\r\nTop: Logo\r\nBottom: Adobe Trajan

    he said about the origin of the concept.
