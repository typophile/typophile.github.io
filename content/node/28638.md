    enforcement thing by then. Getting a passport to visit the US is not something
    I want to do.

    Nice vibes to the place with Old-School bartenders and such. No food though. (Plus,
    it's less than a block from my apartment, a nice last-call bonus)\r\n\r\nOr Minnies
    is cool. 24 Hours, good food, reasonable prices, waitresses with piercings. \r\n\r\n"

  body: Linda, the Seattle book arts scene is wonderful - the PNW and western Canada,
    too. In addition to digital type, we will incorporate letterpress and printing
    history, calligraphy, hand lettering, graphic design, new media, etc., bringing
    everyone together in a delirious celebration of letters.

    time.  It's not like I need more projects to work on, but it's always fun to see
    what others are doing.  Thanks Tamye.\r\n\r\nWhat's the ATC scene like?  I figure
    if we're driving down from Calgary, I can load up the car both ways.  (Well, and
    save some room for wine!)\r\n\r\nLinda"
