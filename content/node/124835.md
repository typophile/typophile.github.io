  ?\r\n\r\nIt is used in the logo of canadian chocolate maker Genevieve Grandbois.
  I'm wondering if it might be a custom made font.\r\n\r\nThanks a lot"

    Nova]] <strong>A</strong> to get the circular /[[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/marksimonson/proxima-nova/a-semibold/glyphs.html#glyphs/655952/57|G]].

  body: "Thanks for the hint !\r\n\r\nThis is indeed a similar font, though it is
    not quite identical. Should I understand from this that the font used in the logo
    is probably custom made, as I suspected ?"

  body: Where do you see the differences? Because to me, at this size, I can't see
    any and believe me, that's probably very hard to match this /S. The other option
    I could see is [[http://www.typography.com/fonts/gotham/overview|Gotham]] but
    it has no circular /G even as alternative (that's actually why I suggested Proxima
    Nova instead of Gotham).

  body: Now looking at better [[http://lesjusticiersurbains.files.wordpress.com/2012/02/gg.jpg|sample]],
    I think now it's [[http://www.typography.com/fonts/gotham/overview|Gotham]] with
    a custom /G (underneath text positively set in it), Proxima Nova remaining the
    best ready-to-go option with a circular /G.
