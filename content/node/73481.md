body: "I just starting playing around with the word Iota by incorporating the actual
  greek alphabet iota into the word eyeota. Any thoughts? I know it's a pretty simple
  (and maybe too obvious) solution. The font used is Lobster 1.4 by Pablo Impallari.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/eyeota_3940.jpg]"

  body: I like the one on the bottom left the best, though it loses any translation
    of the concept of the iota. I think to improve it for the top left one, make the
    head of the iota more simler to the example you have in the middle, though I think
    the curvature at the bottom of the t may make it really hard to show off the iota
    concept.

  body: Sorry I didn't clarify, the bottom left is the original Lobster font. I guess
    that somewhat answers my question though.... So thanks.
