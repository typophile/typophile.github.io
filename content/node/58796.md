body: "First-timer here! Trying to restore graphics on an old piece of farm equipment.
  The pic I have here is slightly enhanced to bring out the color, it is really much
  more faded. I have two types in particular, mainly the makers name (\"Roths\") and
  the model (\"Garden King\"). I'll start with the garden king. I found the \"FEATURED
  ITEM\" font at Dafonts, which seems to be the closest yet, but maybe you have something
  closer? \r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/GARDEN KING copy_6083.jpg]\r\n\r\nThe
  funky arch on the leg of the \"K\" is tough to find, and the font seems more \"stumpy\"
  than FEATURED ITEM."

  body: Since these are pre-digital, it might be hard to find an exact match. [[http://www.letterbox.net.au/store/order_fonts_berber.php|Berber]]
    looks close for the first one.
