The video was one of the most touching I&#39;ve seen in a very long time, the song is a killer and it would simply have been nice to see someone like Cash win something... anything... on a channel like MTV. Instead we get Justin Timberlake. Yeah... right. I hope now that Cash is dead, someone at MTV is kicking him- or herself in the bee-hind ;-&#41;. </div>

I was utterly surprised to even see Cash nominated and thought it would have been neat if the old man snatched away the moon man from singers that grew out of drawing-board-designed boy bands. I&#39;m not that big a fan of Cash, but it would have been a great moment anyway. </div>
