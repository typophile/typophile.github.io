  body: Sometimes I get this warning with one font of a family but not the other.
    The classes in the fonts are the same, the encodings are the same, and the same
    glyphs exist in each font. Very weird.

  body: "You should try to avoid mixing glyphs from different scripts, in this case
    Latin, Cyrillic and Greek, in kerning classes. Divide your classes by script (Expand
    class kerning, reorganize classes, compress kerning classes) and see if the warning
    goes away.\r\n\r\nOh, and delete any kern pairs between glyphs of different scripts
    that may result when expanding your classes."
