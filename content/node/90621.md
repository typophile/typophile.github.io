  For instance, the EOT character (ASCII 4) would would be inserted as a symbol when
  I type cntrl + D.\r\n\r\nI have drawn the glyph in FontLab studio, but when I generate
  the font, the EOT character is not present.\r\n\r\nCould some kind soul explain
  how I can achieve this, or point me to a decent resource that I might try to understand
  the problem?\r\n\r\nThank you"

    do you know? Because pressing Ctrl+D in any software doesn't show it? (See Hrant's
    answer for that.) Or by inspecting your font with a utility that is able to show
    glyphs and assigned codes?"

    show it as \"^D\". Not a font in the world that can work around that ...\r\n\r\n(Except
    an Opentype font that substitutes the sequence \"^D\" with an actual glyph of
    one. But that would not be the same, would it?)"

  body: Control characters are by definition not displayable. They are special codes
    used to do things other than display characters, like ringing the bell on the
    teletype machine.

  body: "Thanks for replying guys. \r\n\r\nI'm writing the software that's supposed
    to display this character. The software is supposed to replace some legacy equipment
    that displayed the EOT character with a specific symbol. \r\n\r\nI know Ctrl+D
    works because it displays the following when I use Courier New:\r\n\r\nOn Windows
    XP:\r\n a square (\u25A1)\r\n\r\nOn Windows 7:\r\n a backwards L (\u2518)\r\n\r\nWhen
    using my custom font, I just get a space. In debug mode, I can see that 0x04 is
    put into the buffer for the EOT character. \r\n\r\nI'm pretty certain that whatever
    comes out of Fontlab does not have a symbol mapped to the 0x04 character. Is there
    anyway to map a glyph to the EOT character within Fontlab?"

    maybe you can do it. I placed a \"0\" at 0x3, generated the CFF font and opened
    it again.\r\nPS not in FontLab, in FontForge"

    term; you don't say what software you are using to \"prove\" your point.\r\n\r\nAnd
    those characters are neither 'a square' nor 'a backwards L'. What character(s)
    do you get when you press any other Ctrl+ key? What character do you see when
    you enter a key code that is not available in the font?"

  body: "As I recall, most Windows versions would display a box for a control character,
    probably because that's the font's 'missing character' symbol. I have seen it
    often enough instead of a ^Z or even ^@.\r\n\r\nIIRC, some TeX encodings use the
    U0000..U001F space for glyphs, and I already know that FontForge can stuff that

  body: "I've given up on trying to place a glyph into the EOT position and will instead
    handle the problem in my code:\r\n\r\nWhenever I see the EOT char (x04), I replace
    it with the section sign (xA7). In my font, I've replaced the section sign with
    the symbol I want to use. This only works because I know my software doesn't have
    to support the section sign.\r\n\r\nIt still bothers me that I had to handle this
    with code. Both Fontlab and Fontforge have the glyph at this position, but I can't
    figure out how to it.\r\n\r\nThanks for all the replies, I would have kept spinning
    my wheels looking for the \"perfect\" solution had you guys not convinced me it
    was difficult (if not impossible) to do."

  body: "Theoretically there is no specific problem with a character at this position,
    but the software has to support its actual drawing on screen. Your solution is
    as good as anything else; the use of other glyphs to display a Tab, Hard Return,
    Space, or other special character is common.\r\n\r\nAnd usually its 'special'
    status is indicated by having a different color than the surrounding text. See
    commands like 'Show Invisible Characters\" in your favourite text editor. (Microsoft
    Word, with its intrusive glaringly black \"hidden\" characters is an exception.)"

  body: Hmm&hellip; If your system uses Unicode as native encoding, you can probably
    hack things to emit Control Picture codes (U+2400..U+241F) instead.
