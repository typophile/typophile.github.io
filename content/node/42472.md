  1450 and 1550? I'm interested to know the names, locations, and dates.\r\n\r\nThere
  is an entry on Wikipedia under 'Spread of Printing', and there are some maps in
  Elizabeth Eisenstein's 'The Printing Revolution in Early Modern Europe', but I'd
  like to cross-reference them with alternatives, online or off.\r\n\r\nThanks\r\nWilliam"

  body: The Wikipedia article is shoddy. It lists the first printing in Canada as
    1766 and the first newspaper, The Novascotian, was established in 1724. I don't
    know how many other elements of the article are incorrect.

  body: 'I would recommend Daniel Updike''s two volume set: <em>Printing Types. Their
    History, Forms and Use</em>. No maps, but lots of names, locations and dates.'

  body: Consider Henri-Jean Martin's <em>The History and Power of Writing</em> again
    no maps. The book is a history of the economies related to writing and printing.
    So it covers printers, scribes, typefounders, printers, publishers, and book sellers,
    and does a thoroughly good job to explaining the relationships among the persons
    and technologies involved.

  body: "Don, I have found further evidence that the Wikipedia list is incomplete,
    and arguably inaccurate. Ken, I know the Updike tomes, and they are good. Charles,
    I've ordered your suggestion. Thanks to all of you.\r\n\r\nAt present I am going
    through the British Library record of incunabulae at St Brides. But this will
    require some padding out I think. The BL record contains all the books they hold,
    in chronological (and then city) order - but doesn't include anything they don't
    hold.\r\n\r\nI would welcome any other suggestions."
