  Normally I have Sophmores and Juniors, but this guy was older and a lot more mature.
  After the first class we talked and I found out that he was a captain in the Marine
  Corps and he had been deployed to Iraq and was in Fallujah. I also found out that
  he was working on both a Masters in Design Technology, and an MBA at the same time.
  A very impressive guy.\r\n\r\nAnyway he spent the semester designing a typeface
  that he wanted to use on a website he was creating. Not a bad first font. But it
  is the content and perspective that really recommends the site\r\n\r\nhttp://2dinar.com/issues/pages/brief.php\r\n\r\n\r\nJames\r\n"

  body: "James - thanks very much for this post. Indeed the content and perspective
    is, as you say, the part that recommends the site. There is a lot of poignant
    stuff to read here. I assume the header font is the one your student designed,
    yes?\r\nJordan"
