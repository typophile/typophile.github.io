  fall, as my boyfriend attends Brown for playwriting.\r\n\r\nI currently don't know
  anyone in the Providence area, and am hoping to connect with some type/design people.\r\n\r\nAny
  typophiles in providence? Or know anyone in the area?\r\n\r\nI'm also going to reach
  out to the RISD community, but thought I would start here.\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\nJeremy"

    of twelve years and his elderly pug...  :)\r\n\r\nAs ChrisL suggests, RISD would
    be a good place to meet fellow typophiles too.\r\n\r\nThere isn't much for bookstores,
    but in Downtown Providence there is a nice \"closeout / remainder\" store called
    Symposium Books with a nice selection of art books.  On nearby Matthewson Street
    is the best used bookstore in the state, Cellar Stories, which also has a decent
    art/graphic design area (IMHO).\r\n\r\nFeel free to contact me at jshallri@cox.net
    if you like.\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\nJohnH the Fontaholic"
