body: "Good evening!\r\n\r\nSome languages have problems with f-ligatures. One example
  is German, where ligatures across <em>Wortfugen</em> can be a source of confusion;
  another is Turkish, in which the dotless \u0131 requires special treatment.\r\n\r\nHave
  there been any efforts to identify (and compile a list of) such problems, and is
  it considered good practice to code those exceptions as <em>language-specific</em>
  OpenType alternates? Say, \"ligatures for dflt, no ligatures for german\"? Or would
  that go against users' expecations? How well are such features implemented in software
  at all?\r\n\r\nAnother solution, of course, is a Linotype (\"Sabon\") f, but you
  know, I do have a thing for nice fi and fl ligatures :)\r\n\r\nI'm aware there are
  a handful of excellent threads on OpenType and ligatures, but I haven't found one
  that answered my question \u2013 if there is one, please just point me to it.\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\nSebastian"
