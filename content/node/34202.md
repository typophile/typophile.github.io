body: "I am a fourth year student of graphic design trying to design her degree show
  portfolio. I have a lovely bulky A2 portfolio case full of work but the layout just
  isn't doing my work justice. Does anyone have any tips on how the A2 sheets should
  be best laid out? I will be designing and binding my own book of work at a later
  date but the A2 sheets are a requirement for asessment. What should the type image
  ratio be? How many pages to each project? This isn't a plea because I'm too damn
  lazy to do it myself, its just this is a very very important show for me and panic
  seems to be clouding my judgement right now. Any help or links is much appreciated,thanks!...must
  go drink more coffee...\r\n\r\nsara"

  body: hmmm...I usually do an A3 portfolio because it is more managabe but as you
    say, it is required to have A2 then erm...yup but make sure you have a variety
    of layouts. I tend to do mine double page spreads or if needed, 2 double page
    spreads per project. Why not use Indesign to match them up and have them inline
    with each other. Also, make sure everything is lined up well, no spelling mistakes
    and that you have well designed pages. About ratio, well it depends. I had a full
    bleed photograph once on one side and then just a vertical strip of mini photographs
    on the other side to accentuate my main, best photograph for my photography project.
    White space is good! So I think you need to try different layouts. Be creative.
    You are a graphic designer by the way! ahem ahem :D

  body: Yes, ironic, I know. Thanks for the advice missgiggles. Anybody want the name
    of my course so they ccan tell people not to do it !?! Just kiddin, I love it,
    its just slightly more of a hands on, fine art approach to all things graphic,
    hence the lack of confidence in my technical layout skills...
