  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>I bet this question has been asked a million times: basically, is there anything out there other than Times New Roman and Arial for the most common cross-platform fonts (for print)?</p>
<p>I am designing templates for a non-profit governmental, political conference that needs a lowest-common-denominator font that can be found cross-platform. The templates will need to be accessible by all staff members who will all share in generating a body of documents within a one-week time frame from a home-office printer (like I said, non-profit&hellip;); they will hopefully come across with some semblance of a brand and consistent look. (The staff members are coming from all around the world, most will be using their own computers&ndash;who knows how old their PCs are). Every year, the conference has defaulted to Times New Roman and Verdana as the body and header fonts, respectively.</p>
<p>As I am not too familiar with the PC system, does anyone out there now if there is a common serif font with non-lining numbers (like Georgia, but for print?)</p>
<p>Speaking of Verdana, I am similarly looking for a new sans serif font for the header type that is common to all/most pc&rsquo;s and macs. Arial and Verdana, so far, seem to be the only ones that don&rsquo;t need to be substituted when the documents are transferred from PC-Mac-PC. I used Franklin Gothic last year for table tents and name badges, signage that was generated on location, etc&hellip;but this year, the documents were sent back to me using Verdana once again (I think this is because when the PC users open a document with Franklin Gothic specified from my mac, it asks for you to choose a new, substitute font&ndash;so they just chose Verdana). Should I re-convert everything to Franklin Gothic?</p>
<p>As I will be working remotely this year from a different time zone, it will be hard to be the control freak who makes sure all documents are looking consistent before they are printed out</p>
<p>The logo that will be on all documents is attached (it uses Interstate, and the &lsquo;th&rsquo; is Caslon 540 italic).</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>&hellip;or, should I just throw in the towel and just make everything goof-proof in Times New Roman?</p>
<p>I think I could force them to print in Franklin Gothic bold/book for signage by sending a bulk of documents in PDF form, but for last-minute things, there is huge potential for bad things to be pushed out of the printer (like long names being hyphenated and titles being cut off, etc.)</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Thanks for all your comments&hellip;client will probably like Georgia BECAUSE of the bold (for name badges and table tents): good for old eyes who aren&rsquo;t sitting in the front row ;) (But, as I will not be there to look over documents before they are sent to print, there is a very good chance that everything is going to get bolded, capped, italicized, underlined and enlarged, just to make sure you don&rsquo;t miss that point.)</p>
<p>What do you think of Cambria? Or is that not yet common enough on most windows systems? Was that only intro&rsquo;d with Windows Vista?</p>
