  body: Congrats, Ricardo! I especially liked the alternates and the impressive range
    of weights. Do you plan to add italics?

  body: "Thank you people!\r\n\r\nIgor, yes, italics are in my plans since the begining.
    I've been playing arond with Progressiva since 2008 and the project had several
    stops in the process, when I worked in other type design projects and academic
    research. So I decided to release it since I have all the romans done. But I want
    to release the italics in the future. I just don't know when, because Directa
    Sans, the partner of [[http://www.outrasfontes.com/site/?page_id=50|Directa Serif]]
    are in my production queue also. :-)\r\n\r\nCatharsis, thank for the alert! I'll
    make the correction. Mental note: Never trust Google Translate for the samples."
