<div class=commentbody>The old site was just poor. The new site at least introduces hierarchy (yeah, that's a design concept.) It was trying to be undesigned, but it suffered badly from link overkill (compare to the "navigation" on the Oracle site: http://www.oracle.com/ .)
Yeah, this is an improvement.
As for the criticism about 1024 x 768. That may be the current web standard, but why limit it to a web standard when the audience (designers) very likely have much higher resolutions to work with.

<div class=commentbody>Joe, as you create for the web and I don't, I do respect your opinion. But I was always able to find anything I needed from the "old" homepage. I realize it will take getting used to, and after that I won't notice a thing, but it seems to me they've taken a few steps backward.
The Oracle homepage hierarchy (I assume you are talking about the right hand bar) isn't that different from what Emigre had before.

Oracle is bad because they have too many links. But that is still better than Emigre and Emigre still has way more links. Whats with the brackets everywhere? Where is the visual heirchy, where is the grouping, where is the contrast, etc.</div>

<div class=commentbody>The new site may have introduced hierachy by reducing the # of links but god save you if the this new site was an airport. You have to lean a whole new unorthodox UI structure! And the new UI is really deemphasized. The old site would 'get you to a plane on time' as it were.
That the old site was almost all UI was probably a flaw in the sense that it didn't keep you interested - not enough mystery/curiousity in the flat UI structure. That probably wasn't good for business.
Neither solution strikes me as very user centered. But then being 'easy' hasn't really been their 'gig' has it?</div>

<div class=commentbody>"Im not loving the current trend of big glammy picture links with no description of where its going. Spent half my time, playing hide and seek."
Exactly my point. Besides the fact the site does not fit in my monitor (17" Apple Display), the old one, like it or not, was a pioneering masterpiece in terms of design and usability. I was a little tired by it, but I enjoyed it immensely, as it was launched shortly after Emigre released my own Ottomat.
I think they should have kept its efficiency, just with a new design.

<div class=commentbody>Well, at least it's better than their old site, I think. For Emigre, it feels very un-funky, almost too mainstream. What would've been cool was to have a site as flexible and lively as the magazine itself.

<div class=commentbody>I figured out what is REALLY wrong with the site - no rollovers. With that long font list on the right, wouldn't it be nice if you could mouse over the font name and have the image display itself without having to click? </div>

<div class=commentbody>patty,
it does have that functionality. it just takes a few seconds for the image to appear. and i think a couple of them may be mixed up. what's your resolution? the rollover is below the blue rectangle with the links in the middle.
i like graphics and big images on a webite and, for a type foundry, big, proud displays of their typefaces is a good thing. having said that, anyone who does web design will cringe at the code and the lack of concern for usability and accessibility.
i still like they fonts though!</div>
