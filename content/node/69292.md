body: "We're getting ready to prepare a fairly large inlay for the body of a guitar.
  The outside ring is mother of pearl and we're going to engrave and black fill the
  lettering. Setting the type on an ellipse is really frustrating, there are so many
  compromises. \r\n\r\nThe pdf shows the inlay we're working on. Here's a picture
  of a similar inlay (without the lettering) to give some idea of context:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/inlayexample_5438.jpg]\r\n\r\nThe
  MA in MARIE is really irritating, but I just don't see any way around it without
  grossly large letterspacing. I would be open to other font suggestions, but there's
  limitations with our hand engraving, and no lower-case with the baseline on this
  one. \r\n\r\nIn all likelihood the materials in the inlay will make the efforts
  of typesetting go unnoticed, but that's OK - the main thing I want to avoid is the
  type glaring out or overpowering the design in any way. "

    of MA on an oval path.\r\nMy suggestion would be to go with a typeface which offer
    a fairly square shape of A, either with rounded/squared top or with an additional
    crossbar on the top."

    this:\r\nhttp://new.myfonts.com/fonts/p22/victorian-gothic/\r\nwould help."
