    and source of the document [government or corporate] are consistent with an IBM

    Telecom, or at the very least broadcasting/radio. But I found the same icon on
    a \"Riksenergi\" 2014 calendar.\r\n\r\nCan you enlighten me? And who is this Mikael

  body: "Kevin, thanks for sharing. My typewriter skills began with my Royal portable
    in Junior High, which served me well throughout my University Years. Later I made
    do with antique machines for documents that were best not passed to the secretaries
    -- who had the Selectrics. But I did become familiar with the typefaces on the
    elements for the Selectrics. I thought then, and I still do, that they were mostly
    well designed, within the limits of monospace. But I too was happy when my office
    moved to the Mac and laser printers in the early 1980s.\r\nDon"
