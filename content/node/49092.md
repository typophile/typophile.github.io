  looking for a typeface that would work with their existing logo. I would use it
  for the main navigation and headings throughout the site, but they might consider
  using it for everything else (including copy). Any suggestions? Thank you in advance.

    Arial if you have to work with a standard typeface for a website.

  body: "@ J Weltin,\r\nI'm not looking for a web font. I might employ sIFR for the
    navigation or just use images. \r\n\r\nI forgot to mention that the owner of the
    firm (who is also the lead designer) is quite fond of minimalism. Thus his projects
    generally take a modern approach. "

    one of my favorites is Gill Sans if you have it, I''m not sure how well it would
    go with the logo design though, you would have to try it out. If its a Serif font
    you are seeking you might try Minion Pro. Again I haven''t seen it next to the
    logo, but its a suggestion.    '

  body: "I think going with Gill would clash with Helvetica (both being sans serifs
    and all that). If the designer is into minimalism, and the logo is already in
    Helvetica, I say go with Helvetica. You don't need to stick with regular or bold,
    though. Check out the various condensed and expanded versions in the Helvetica
    Neue family.\r\n\r\nIs the company name pronounced as it's spelled, or is there
    an implied invisible \"e\" between the \"d\" and \"s\"?"

  body: "@Jonathan,\r\nFunny you should ask. I had the same question when I first
    saw the logo. You're supposed to read it \"David Design\", but everyone says \"David
    Sign\". So he's used to the latter now. As for the Helvetica suggestion - I'd
    like to avoid it, simply because of it's widespread use. I think I'm looking for
    something with a bit more character, but not too much as to \"overwhelm\" the
    logo. \r\n"

  body: "It'd have to be spelled David'sign to read as design, methinks. ;o)\r\n\r\nThe
    problem is that the logo *is* Helvetica, so anything with more character will
    likely overwhelm it. \r\n\r\nI'd say you're best off focusing on a serif face
    to contrast."
