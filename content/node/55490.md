  body: I think it's custom. However, they use a slightly customized Futura in a lot
    of their material.

  body: According to schwalbenkoenig on My Fonts.com Ikea uses a custom typeface,
    IKEA Sans, which is based on Futura. Antique Olive Nord is similar in weight and
    feel. The serif is also exclusive, IKEA Serif, which is based on New century Schoolbook.
