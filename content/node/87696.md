body: "Dear Bezier masters,\r\n\r\nI'm reposting this from [[http://typophile.com/node/86965|here]],
  because it's a different topic and problem now.\r\n\r\nI've tried to approach my
  problem (calculating curve speed) in a more general way, using the general cubic
  Bezier equation.\r\nI've constructed the first derivative, as suggested. Please
  correct me, if I made mistakes there. School was a looong time ago. But findings
  on the internet suggest that I did it right.\r\nThe function solveCubic returns
  as the first argument p1234 (identical to the middle on-curve point calculated by
  the known splitCubicAtT function, I just skipped the other points for now), then
  the result of the first derivative.\r\nAll are vectors (or coordinates).\r\n\r\nThe
  segment used for the results posted below (with t in 0.1 steps) is a quarter of
  a circle, or a quarter of as close a circle as one can construct with Beziers. The
  first derivative should then have all equal (more or less) values, right, in case
  of a circle? In other words, curve speed should be steady at all positions in a
  circle. Shown in the results in the rightmost column is the absolute value of the
  vector returned by the first derivative.\r\nBut the results differ by 8%. This doesn't
  look right. I've double-checked for a correct circle pie piece.\r\n\r\nWhere is
  the mistake or the misunderstanding?\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\nimport numpy, math\r\n\r\ndef
