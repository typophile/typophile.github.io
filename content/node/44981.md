  Monoxil Outliner, one of three font from my diploma project (along with [[http://typophile.com/node/44668|Klimax]]
  and Kakao). its design is based on the original [[http://typophile.com/node/33307|Monoxil]],
  which i made last year. i used that font only twice or so because it somehow didn't
  fit into anything :), but it worked quite [[http://www.urbanclash.sk/|nice]] with
  various outlines applied to it. \r\n\r\nso i decided to design a new font, especialy
  for use with outlines.\r\n1. i changed the proportions a bit (the white spaces in
  B, E, F, P, R and S are the same size, so they close at the same time when you increase
  the thickness of the outline)\r\n2. the ends of strokes are rounded\r\n3. all sharp
  connections have a very small rounded curve in the corner, so there don't appear
  any ugly triangles sticking out ot the shape when the letter has a thick outline.
  (because it is not possible to choose the type of the connections of the outline
  for text in indesign)\r\n\r\nthank you for your comments. ondrej"

    font a solution to the InDesign stroke corners. It's clever to make a font with
    considerations for stroke width, closing up the counters evenly across different
    letters. I like the gap in the R and the wide m, s and c. Your o is refreshing.
    Good stuff! :)\r\n"
