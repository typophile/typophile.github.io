    made it a bit more visible. No?\r\nBut you're right, Chipman, actually drawing
    the outlines of the letters and filling them makes this a lot more interesting.
    And Sagmeister didn't do that! :P I thought about that, for my entry, but I didn't
    quite know how to accomplish that with the letters I drew.\r\nAnd I got lazy.\r\nThat's
