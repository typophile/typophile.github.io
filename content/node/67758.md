    example: aakkoset (in English: the alphabet). Or how about this single word: Ratsastajattarinkikinko?
    (in English: Even also with the hand of female horse back riders?)? Finnish grammar
    is just the best.'

    64 cases!\r\n\r\nBut I finally realised why the radio news in Latin is so popular
    in Finland: the Finns are among the few people who would consider Latin declension
    rules simple. :)"
