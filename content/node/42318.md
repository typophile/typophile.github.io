  body: "Where's it from, can you give us some information that might help ID it?\r\n\r\nAt
    this point, I have to agree with Lex. It looks pretty rough and the letterforms
    are inconsistent (despite the fact that the A and I look similar, they also look
    hand lettered.) If you're sure it's a font, it would most likely be a free font
    or shareware font."

    You upload an image and it is analyzed using a form of OCR. It's worked well for
    me in the past.
