body: has anyone dealt with metrics &#40;that has been properly set in fontographer&#41;
  disappearing once you have generated the fonts and loaded the font into a program
  i.e. illustrator, quark etc.? <BR>all this being said, i realize fontographer is
  quite problematic especially in OSX. any suggestions?

  body: Once I had a similar problem where I got lazy and autokerned the font like
    4 times with no limits and thus no metric info was maintained. <BR> <BR>Export
    the spacing and kerning data to see hoy many pairs you&#39;ve got. <BR> <BR>Good
