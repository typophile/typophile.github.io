		<div class="commentbody">I wanted to comment in addition on your attendtion to adjusting the horizontal/vertical for optical monoline. It looks ideal. I'm not put off by the w. I think it fits the round bottom flat top rythm you have working. <BR> <BR>Areas that you might look at: <BR>k: problematic. your form may be the best, but it is odd. You won't be able to make this glyph fit the pattern anyways, what if you used the angle off the a for the top arm before hooking up? Also, the bottom arm would be more consistent if it bowed out right then stright down (thin the join like the a) <BR> <BR>t: Cheat the curve on the bottom. Make it start a little later so the t will sit down a little better. Not so much that you loose the roundness, but just a little sharper curve. <BR> <BR>comma: wonkey <BR> <BR>apostrophe: interesting <BR> <BR>Keep it up. I think you'll be able to do a nice upper set and a light and dark weight.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Matthew, this is really nothing short of amazing. Looking at some individual glyphs one might be tempted to dismiss it as just another constructed font, but I first saw the texture of the setting, and it immediately hit me: this is the true Egyptian style! :-&gt; One the other hand, your heavily ligated* settings look a lot like the Indian Devanagari script! Really huge potential there, in terms of a display face to accompany Indian text, or just Latinate text about Indian stuff. You've really shifted the nature of the Latin alphabet, but with practical subtlety - bravo. <BR> <BR>* I'd concentrate very heavily on this; and do look at Process's linguistically-aware (sorry, John - &quot;orthographic&quot; means something else to me) Lingua design -and its development- when deciding what pairs to provide. <BR> <BR>The glyphs that don't work are the &quot;k&quot; and &quot;x&quot;. For the former you need a simpler shape, or you could try the structure with a loop on top and a short arm on the bottom - or maybe an open loop with an arm. For the &quot;x&quot; try making the top a semi-circle and the bottom two distinct arms, like the &quot;H&quot; in PsyOps's inimitable Spanner. <BR> <BR>Other problematic glyphs are the &quot;t&quot; (not sure what to do about it) and the &quot;w&quot; (I'd make it like two &quot;v&quot;s). <BR> <BR>And yes, do make heavier weights (with no stroke modulation). <BR> <BR>This font also has potential for much more decorative treatments, like nipples* at the bottom of the bowls. <BR> <BR>* I squarely blame Tanya for starting me off on that foot today. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR></div>

		<div class="commentbody">Good suggestions everyone. Thanks for noticing the monoline adjustments, Randy. <BR> <BR>RE: the apostrophe, that was just one of the connectors used in the place of an apostrophe because one does not exist yet. :-) <BR> <BR>I was on the road all day today, but had a chance to update a few of the characters tonight: <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/26434.gif" alt=""> <BR> <BR>I made the &quot;e&quot;, &quot;c&quot;, and &quot;s&quot; a little skinnier. I curved the bottom of most letters that terminated flat before. I also changed the curve on the &quot;t&quot; and &quot;j&quot;. <BR> <BR>I like the curved &quot;x&quot; but don't know if it fits the grid right. <BR> <BR>I'm thinking about slanting the &quot;e&quot; and &quot;s&quot; like how the &quot;a&quot; is. Any comments on that? <BR> <BR>I also can't wait to see how the bold and light versions come out, not to mention the XXX version that will have nipples and more supple curves. ;-)</div>

		<div class="commentbody">This is really beautiful! I like the way the color font looks like certain early arabic scripts &amp; of course as Hrant said Indian ones as well. It was hard to see if the changes you made made the text easier to read or not. Maybe they made the letterforms too homogenous. My inexperience at evaluation greeking is probably to blame&hellip; Would you post something in English? <BR> <BR>BTW - Is the intent of this face that it be good at long text settings or is it meant to be mostly a display face? I think it has real potential as a text face actually! It is remarkably pleasant to roll your eyes over. <BR> <BR>I like the idea of the 'x' but what about two rounded bowls ( like the one on top) instead of the hybrid? For some reason the hybrid is catching &amp; holding my eye for too long.  <BR> <BR>The y is doing the same thing but to a much lesser extent. I think it's decender looks unrelated to the rest of the font. <BR> <BR>Have you looked at the forms from early arabic Kufic Script <a href="http://www.arabiccalligraphy.com/resources_detail.php?resId=1" target="_blank"><a href="http://www.arabiccalligraphy.com/resources_detail.php?resId=1">http://www.arabiccalligraphy.com/resources_detail.php?resId=1</a></a> or indian ( hindi + lots of others ) scripts? The hindi example is the best one for me in terms of showing the effect of the running horizontal line with shapes seeming to hang off it. Hindi is more extreme but the simulatity of effect is striking to me! <BR> <BR>I am excited to own this one.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">What do you mean by cheat? It seems clear that there are some rules you are applying in order to create the look &amp; distict structure you have - you mean deviation from those no? But think of regular roman characters. They follow rules too &amp; yet even there you have characters with distinct personalities - the M is really wide etc so - it seems like you could have judicious exceptions in several places &amp; end up with a face with increased interest &amp; readability. <BR> <BR>Did you cheat with the open LC k? <BR> <BR>Of course you are right that in general it is silly to try to make a face that is both solid in text &amp; display but I think you have a shot.  <BR> <BR>I am thinking of J Hoefler's Didot where display was accounted for in the details at large sizes rather than in the basic appraoch. Those faces can be really nice in display. It's not a completely parrallel example - especially since some folks hate it when a didone font is set in book texts - but the basic idea being that display quality &amp; text quality could be addressed in seperate cuts of the same family with happy results. That is a really classic approach after all.</div>

Try making the top of the Display &quot;K&quot; a circle quadrant. <BR> <BR>BTW, I had an idea: it hit me that Flathead has a certain Avant Garde feel to it, so what you might do with the display cut (or a version of it) is match the weight/proportions/etc. of AG, so people can intermix them in funky ways. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR></div>

		<div class="commentbody">I think my nordic heritage may be coming into play subconsciously. ;-) <BR> <BR>I put the serif on the display &quot;l&quot; because I didn't like it on the text version and it makes the display version just that little bit more different. I may get rid of it because you can make that same shape with one of the connectors. <BR> <BR>I think I will revert to the curved tail on the &quot;Q&quot; on the serif version, good idea. <BR> <BR>Mixing with Avant Garde, that's an awesome and crazy idea. I'll have to look into it. <BR> <BR>After printing this thing out, I have to say that it's making me excited for the readability factor. It's funny that in the beginning the idea was to lose some of the readbility in favor of the display properties.
