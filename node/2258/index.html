Both have potential to be very respectable designs for a universal design community (this is what you want, no?). If you go with a circumfrance of type, then be very articulate with the type selection and try to keep the type very small in relation to the icon/mark. It should appear as a thin solid ring, rather than a spacious airy circle of type. Add more verbage (i.e. descriptors, locations, dates, whatever), if necessary to fill the space.

		<div class="commentbody">I think your idea for an organization of designers against hate is a wonderful idea. However, this name for your organization is a terrible mistake. Let me explain why.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->It shows a misunderstanding of the psychology of hate, and will be counter-productive. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Psychologist Alfred Adler pointed out that the first step to anti-social behavior is to divide 'us' and 'them'. The next step is that 'they' are less than human and it is ok to hate them and use violence against them. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Recently psychologist Steven Stosney - <!-- raw HTML omitted --><a href="http://compassionpower.com">http://compassionpower.com</a><!-- raw HTML omitted --> - who has been one of the most successful in treating wife beaters and road rage, has pointed out that compassion and anger are opposites - and anger is a key component of hatred. Hatred and the accompanying anger impair a person's thinking, so that they no longer think in terms of problem-solving, but only us vs them, and whether to attack, defend, or withdraw. Compassion motivates you to understand the other person and act appropriately. When you understand the other person you can act much more effectively, whether it is to cooperate or oppose them.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->This is why 'hate the hate' is a terrible idea. It falls into the trap of perpetuating the stupidity that hate causes, instead of providing the understanding that leads to its cure. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Ecclesiastes said there is a 'time for love and a time for hate', and I do think that hatred is functional physical self defence. It blocks the compassion that would make you hesitate to harm the other person, and as a resulkt you may be killed yourself. Aside from battle, I see no benefit in real hate. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Hrant's views on this matter are in my opinion completely wrong, and would lead to a much worse world.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I think that your chances of being effective will be greatly if you contact and accept guidance from existing organizations fighting hate groups, such as the Southern Poverty Law Center - <!-- raw HTML omitted --><a href="http://www.tolerance.org/">http://www.tolerance.org/</a><!-- raw HTML omitted --> - and the Anti-Defamation League - <!-- raw HTML omitted --><a href="http://www.adl.org/adl.asp">http://www.adl.org/adl.asp</a><!-- raw HTML omitted --> . <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->These have long experience in fighting hate groups, and have had notable successes. I am not saying you should simply be a wing of one of these, but you should certainly talk to them and get benefit of their experience before going forward.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->By the way, note the logo for Tolerance.org - not great but not bad. <!-- raw HTML omitted --></div>

		<div class="commentbody">William, apparently you have no idea what I'm saying (wow, that's a first). <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The trap is to make hate an Evil thing. It is human. By coming to grips with it, we can control it, and make those whose hate is out of control more human, like us. In this way of showing compassion to them, we have a better chance of converting them to a &quot;control mode&quot;. So basically you're saying: I hate the fact that you're like that, and that makes us the same - but I'm in control of myself - you can be too. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Your view is entirely too orthodox and rigid, and is leading the world down this path of destruction we're seeing more of every day.

In this case I feel like it can be a great call to action.

		<div class="commentbody">&lt;font class=&quot;dontLookLikeCrap&quot;&gt;Both anger and hatred are Godly qualities. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Paul writes: For what I am doing, I do not understand; for I am not practicing what I would like to do, but I am doing the very thing I hate. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->That is, he hates doing evil. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->And in Rev. 2: <!-- raw HTML omitted -->`Yet this you do have, that you hate the deeds of the Nicolaitans, which I also hate. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->God speaking to one of the 7 churches, commending them for their 'hatred' of wrongdoings. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->As for anger, Jesus was angry at the moneychangers he found in the temple. Rather than making it a house of prayer, it was turned into an arena for profit. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->As Hrant stated and as the Bible shows, it's a matter of how you deal with your hatred and anger. It is a righteous quality to hate what is evil. The key after that though, is to not take vengeance into your own hands, which is what most people do. Rather, &quot;be at peace with all men, as much as it is possible.&quot; <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Two other quick notes. Hatred of a person is not the same as hating what someone has done or does. Also, because most people deal incorrectly with their anger and hatred, it makes anger and hatred seem wrong. If the anger can be used to start something good, then that is the correct kind of anger. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->But with that said, the logo &amp;/or name itself seems too ironic for me.  I think a possible problem with a logo against something that it very closely associates with is the initial confusion, and even confusion after people find out what it means. It's smart to be able to find similarities with your opposition, but maybe this is too close? Ultimately, it's your call. However, it's not a logo I would be proud of displaying, if I were in the group, no matter how well it's aesthetically designed. It has lots of baggage that you probably won't be able to overcome. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&lt;/font&gt;</div>

		<div class="commentbody">so we're comparing this organization to the actions of god?  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->If God and Paul had hate then we can congregate, advertise and propel some more?! With that example then you could say that Hitler followed a righteous path or any of the groups that hatethehate would target and it becomes a mute point. But somehow I don't think that's what the holy ones had in mind when its written that they &quot;hated&quot; - to become hate inc. and shower it on everyone you don't like hoping that they'd smarten up. For some reason I think that maybe god or paul had a bit more power to persuade. See, if I were a religious person and god just told me he hated something we were doing I would probably freak out and do what-ever he said. Will hatethehate have that power - nah. <!-- raw HTML omitted --></div>

While it might be fine for something truly wrong to make you angry, having that anger and acting upon the anger negatively are two different things. But I do think it is possible to have a just anger and act correctly. In the case of hatethehate, the anger is just. I'm just not sure promoting more hatred is the best way to go.   <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --></div>
