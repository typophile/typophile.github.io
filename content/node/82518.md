  finally putting this up for crit. I\u2019ve been reluctant to, but here goes. What
  do you think?"

  body: "I've liked it since you first posted a sample of it and I hope you find time
    to finish it one day.\r\nI can see you had some fun with alternates? I really
    like the \\A\\ in April (is that a trial for a smallcaps A?). And the Rswash_A
    ligature, in which I love little loop.\r\n\r\nThe horizontal connection in the
    \\K\\ stands out to me, although I see you have the same line in the \\R\\. IMHO,
    I think it's a bit too modern for this typeface. It might work in smaller sizes
    though."

  body: "Awesome! That's seriously elegant. It already looks pretty refined to me,
    but I'd like to share some ideas. Cool to see some Dutch words in there ;-)\r\n\r\nThe
    style of w and W, might be a personal or historical thing, but it tends to become
    a little dark (even in such a light typeface) and distracting. I'm not saying
    you should change it, but at least try a different structure if you haven't already
    tried that.\r\n\r\nThe style of k and K looks a bit out of place to me and I'd
    make one of the diagonals thicker.\r\n\r\nPerhaps s and S should have one or two
    terminals thickened as in the c?\r\n\r\nThe g looks a bit too geometrical to me.
    It seems to lack part of the elegance. Definitely stick with a double storey g
    though!\r\n\r\nI think your M needs rethinking. I prefer the middle part to almost
    reach the baseline and the side parts to be more vertical.\r\n\r\nThe proportions
    of your capitals are much different from the usual humanistic proportions. I'm
    not sure it looks 'wrong', but I'd like to see what it looks like with more humanistic
    proportions, e.g. much wider D, H, N, U, T, narrower K, wider E and F.\r\n\r\nKeep
    going! I'm looking forward to updates on this one!\r\n\r\n"

  body: "I\u2019m absolutely ready to play with the shapes here, but I think the rough
    proportions are good. It started out as an uppercase alphabet only, and the first
    iteration had more typical proportions. I landed on this because, 1: it\u2019s
    most definitely a display face and should be eccentric 2: The narrow caps are
    accentuating the na\xEFve geometry in letters like O/C/G. I intended the contrast
    to be larger than usual."

  body: "<em>Perhaps you could redesign your regular R based on the alternate R. Just
    a thought ;-)\r\n</em>\r\n\r\nI thought about commenting on that as well, but
    it will change the entire style of the face. As it currently is, it's kind of
    modern, but it will become a lot more retro if frode desides to change that R
    (and possibly K).\r\n\r\nAlso, I don't mind the different widths of different
    characters, as I understand their historical origins. Evening them out will result
    in a more 'modern' look.\r\n\r\nI've always liked the 'double v' take on the \\w\\.
    Maybe try to widen it a bit to allow the character to be a bit lighter."

    design. I like the way you've mixed wide and narrow proportions. \r\n\r\nTo me
    the M sticks out, it's rather narrow \u2014 I think I'd try bringing the centre
    vertex to the baseline but keep all the angles the same. The W may look a bit
    narrow too.\r\n\r\nHead of ampersand seems to be nodding to the right.\r\n\r\nQ:
    longer crossbar?\r\n\r\nK/k: try a branched structure?\r\n\r\nNumerals are splendid.\r\n\r\n\xA3:
    I think I'd go for a slanted stem in the roman, for this style of typeface, more
    elegant, the current one looks a little stiff.\r\n\r\nItalic /ae/ may be too much
    like /oe/?\r\n\r\nWonderful. Are you thinking about any other weights?"

    that well, especially because of the large bowls on the a and g. I prefer the
    single story a (but without the hook, perhaps a little less round?) as it brings
    it a bit closer to futura elegance rather than didot elegance. The double story
    a is a bit too 'nice' and tame, IMHO."

    stressed sans serifs is rather slim, and I wasn\u2019t aware of Sangbleu Sans
    until very late in the process. If this was a regular weight grotesque or humanist
    I don\u2019t think anyone would worry about being to close to something else.
    None of my shapes were inspired by Sangbleu \u2014 in fact this started out as
    more of a \"fixing Fashion Thin\" thing. I drew inspiration from Futura (rythm)
    and Neutraface (lowercase), Optima and Peignot (stress) and a bunch of concepts
    I\u2019ve been wanting to explore that people said you shouldn\u2019t, particulary
    retaining the geometry in the cursive.\r\n\r\nHope the US is treating you well,
