  body: "http://www.profonts.de/shop_uk/enter.html\r\n\r\nProfonts is a collaboration
    between Peter Rosenfeld and J\xFCrgen Willrodt of URW++. As far as I can gather,
    they are specialising in revivals of old script faces, plus some blackletter revivals
    drawn by Ralph Unger. Peter was at TypeCon. I have not seem J\xFCrgen for a few
    years, but he is sometimes at ATypI."

  body: Thanks, John! I do have his email address. It is difficult to keep track of
    everyone. Do you just know this or is there somewhere online I didn't look?
