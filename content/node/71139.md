  body: dude, if you don't know the font don't reply! Now everyone that looks at the
    forum will see a reply and think I was given the answer.

    it isn't hand-drawn someone will tell you, because we don't stop looking until
    Florian says it's solved. If it is hand-drawn, nothing will change the answer.\r\n\r\nAnd
    maybe next time, you can use a better title to describe your post. You've been
    a member for over 2 years, and must have heard us ask this over and over.\r\n\r\n-

    moderators can be wrong, too. There are a lot of threads where the solution is
    not so clear-cut. Quite frequently someone suggests \u2018custom/hand-drawn/lettered/similar
    to\u2019 and I might agree to that and mark the case as solved \u2013\_and eventually
    another contributor comes up with this obscure typeface I never have heard about
    before, which turns out to be the perfect answer."
