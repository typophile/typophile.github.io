  more shade on the hand as the font moves from light to bold. It doesn't fit with
  the font I'm working on at the moment so I'm ditching them for that, but I thought
  it was quite a nice way of doing it (rather than just making the outline thicker),
  so I thought I'd share it:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/manicules_5442.JPG]"

  body: "[img:sites/default/files/old-images/FigMan_5678.png]This is what I did in
    Figgins Sans.\r\nHowever, in types where I\u2019ve included manicules, I\u2019ve
    usually done two\u2014Regular and Bold\u2014 which are not style linked, because
    they have different Unicodes, 261E WHITE RIGHT POINTING INDEX, and 261B BLACK
    RIGHT POINTING INDEX. \r\ne.g. Fontesque:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/FonMan_6502.png]\r\nScotch
    Modern:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/ScoMan_5203.png]\r\nOther aspects
    of the manicule may be considered, such as the typographic quality of its counters
    vis-a-vis those of the letters in the font, and whether it\u2019s left or right
    handed\u2014i.e. with or without \uFB01ngers 2, 3 and 4. Perhaps we could have
    a different Unicode for left and right handed manicules?!"

  body: One reason for me not including it in the font was the black/white Unicode
    issue. I guess you could have both black and white versions style linked by having
    a bony old hand for light and a big muscly hand for bold.

    be expected, following an established model in a genre that\u2019s traditionally
    all-male.\r\nThough not etymologically correct, womanicules might be a good idea."

    be an all-black hand.\r\n\r\nAnd I like the idea of mapping the womanicule (new
    term?!) to Italic \u2026\r\n\r\nAs for Unicode, there are actually three pairs
    (left/right) of pointers encoded:\r\n261A \u2013 261B\r\n261C \u2013 261E\r\n1F448
    \u2013 1F449\r\nDON\u2019T ask me why.\r\nIt is a mess, of course. That\u2019s
    Unicode \u2026"
