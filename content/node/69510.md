  wonder if anyone can help me out with this specific issue I have, I've tried to
  illustrate it as clearly as I can.\r\n\r\nOn the attached image I've tightened the
  whole word as an example without manually kerning anything. Usually if I wanted
  to keep it at this general tightness my first instinct would be to match the space
  between each letter to the space either side of the \"o\". However, I've always
  been slightly confused as to what should be correct spacing (in this example) for
  the letters circled.\r\n\r\nA) I assume l's should have more space than anything
  else so I'd leave it as is.\r\nB) The \"s\" and \"t\" are touching here, how much
  space would I put between those?\r\nC) The \"r\" and \"a\" - nearly touching?\r\nD)
  \"t\" and \"i\" are especially close. Should they be pulled apart?\r\n\r\nAs I said
  these are some examples, ideally I'd like to know the correct relationship between
  each letter, number etc. Does anyone have the names of books/websites that define
  these rules? Everytime I pick up a book on typography it seems to just mentioning
  fixing the word WAR. I know about the W and A issue but what about everything else?
  (The number 1 always seems to be quite a distance from other numbers, particularly
  in Avenir, the typeface I've used in this example).\r\n\r\nHope that's clear, any
  help is much appreciated!"

  body: "See my notes on the \"tight but not touching\" spacing style:\r\nhttp://typophile.com/node/69306\r\n\r\nIn
    this display style, equalizing closest distances becomes more important than balancing
    areas of space.\r\nAlternatively: it looks like the letters are objects which
    have been horizontally stacked against one another."

  body: Thanks for that Nick, I had noticed your post previously. While your suggestion
    makes sense, looking at the Pepsi ad in your examples - specifically the word
    "that" I notice that the space between the "t" and "h" is closer than the space
    between the "h" and "a". So it doesn't seem as simple as  the kerned word "Helvetica"
    suggests. Or is it?

  body: "I'm not sure what the explanation for that is.\r\nThere are certainly different
    interpretations of the Tight But Not Touching style.\r\nAs the technique is manual,
    or \"eyeballing\", it might just come down to how the typographer feels on the
    day.\r\nI know I try and kern a font in a single session, getting into the zone."

  body: Well I like to think I'm comfortable with kerning as I generally practice
    Tight But Not Touching. But then I visit logo crit sites like Brand New and there's
    all sorts of folk pointing out spacing between certain letters that I just wouldn't
    have spotted. Is that just designers being picky?
