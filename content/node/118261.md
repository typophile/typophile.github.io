  body: "Jackfahnestock, the original typeface dates from 1932, the company dates
    from 1895, so I suspect the packaging design long predates the era of digital
    type (the digital version of the typeface dates from 2000).\r\n\r\nIt wasn't unusual,
    up until the advent of the computer, for designers to use type specimen books
    as the basis for drawing (and I do mean by hand) a logotype. Not all logos are
    hatched directly from a font file. \r\n\r\nAnd thus ends my cranky old(er) man
    speech.\r\n\r\nThe vertical and horizontal proportions have been played with a
    bit, and a few details squared off (such as the leg of the R), but I still contend
    that it is Futura Display:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/FuturaDisplay_3990.png]"

      a digital typeface. It was rather lazy of me to come straight here without any
      solid research beforehand. \r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nJack"
