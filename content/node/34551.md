  body: "Ryan, is the close-up at the bottom of this image an example of the typeface
    you are asking about? \r\n\r\n(Found it <a href=\"http://www.comicsuk.co.uk/ComicInformationPages/Eagle1Pages/Eagle1HomePage.asp\">here</a>.
    There are some other Eagle covers on this site, but none have a close-up attached,
    the way this one does.)\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Eagle1_20_3850.jpg]"

  body: Yes, but it might not be the font that was used for body copy in regular issues
    of Eagle magazine, since in this particular issue they have made the whole page
    look like a newspaper -- hence my question to Ryan.
