body: "Please excuse the uninformed question (I'll gladly be pointed somewhere if
  this was discussed before): I think I've never worked with a font before that had
  small cap parentheses, and now that the wonderful Whitman has presented them to
  me, I'm both thrilled, and not quite sure if/how best to use them.\r\n\r\nThe book
  in question is a German sorta semi-scholarly nonfiction publication. I'm setting
  quoted researchers' names in SC, so together with OSFs the small cap parens seem
  to work quite nicely in situations like these:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/parens1_3973.gif]\r\n\u2026but
  I'm uncertain for parentheses that have a cap-initialled small cap name and a year:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/parens2_6670.gif]\r\nThe
  small ones look nicer to my eye in the overall texture; but I wonder if that small
  cap parenthesis doesn't look a bit silly in front of the cap?\r\n\r\nMostly I guess
  I'm worried I'll open up a can of worms because sometimes these \"short\" parentheses
  will be rather close to a parenthesis with more stuff in it that isn't in small
  caps, so I'll need the full-height ones there\u2026 \r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/parens3_6143.gif]\r\nStuff
  like this makes me think I'll run into far less trouble if I just stick to the full-height
  ones. But the small ones look better. And what would one use them for, if not for
  stuff like this?\r\nCan you tell I'm confused?"

    my eye, the short parenthesis looks worse next to a full cap than the full paranthesis
    does next to a small cap or text figure. And if the text has cascading parantheses,
    you may get into even more trouble. \r\n\r\nBut yes, they look absolutely wonderful.
    By the way, have you found examples of historical use of small cap parantheses?

    I did find a couple of mentions on them on Typophile, but more in terms of a couple
    of type designers saying these might make sense to make &ndash; but without an
    exploration of how exactly they might be used. "

    wonder. There are people referenced in there with names like <em>LeDoux</em>,
    so that might get hairy (plus it would look a bit more \"unusual\", so the editor
    might object &ndash; I'm already glad he lets me do the small caps for names to
    begin with, as that seems to count as old-fashioned now?).\r\n\r\nI'm glad to
    hear there don't seem to be any hard-and-fast rules. I'll gladly make some variants

    worried the all-small-caps treatment wouldn't work for names that appear in running

    It looks like it might be possible to differentiate between parentheses for pure
    references (short ones), and comments that belong to the text (full-height ones)!

    included between the two quotation-parentheses - zeki, 1978 etc. - all in small
    caps, commas and parentheses included. I'm sure Whitman, like other quality fonts,
    was designed with a very strong attention to the details in every glyph, so why
    don't use those features when you have it?\r\n\r\nAbout the leading: my example
    text was set in 11/13, but I feel Whitman, like Adobe Garamond, tends to work
    better with a little less leading, in general - so that the text block looks \"thicker\".
    But it also depends on the line lenght of your page. If it can help in any way,
    sometimes I tried to reduce the leading from 13 to, say, 12,8, gaining one line
    per page and a much more thicker text block.\r\n\r\nBy the way, Zeki rules. :-)"

    I posted, my texts here also use parentheses for other purposes &ndash; so in
    those cases I'd use the full-height ones, and the \"short\" ones only for references,
    so that's a rule that seems to make sense. I was previously worried about mixing
    the parentheses styles/sizes in a somewhat arbitrary fashion. I'm too Swiss for
    arbitrariness. <:-)\r\n\r\nLeading: This is 11.25/13.6*, but my measure is a bit
    on the longish side \r\n(69 characters); I'm not quite sure yet, but I think it
    could use a hair more. \r\n(* I'm such a child of the digital age, I always arrive

    interesting content, and this definitely qualifies (an anthology about art and
    neuroscience, mostly). \r\nIt's great to learn about low frequency channel information
    in the Mona Lisa as a side effect to working. :-)"

  body: "<cite>\"I just don\u2019t think there\u2019s a need for these small-cap parens\"</cite>\r\nNot
    a dire need. But wouldn't you agree they are a subtle enhancement?\r\nIf you're
    talking need/functionality and not \"looking nice\", I'd argue that's pretty much
    the same in this case: they stick out less, so there's less obstruction of the
    \"flow\" of the text, and less errant attraction of attention to details that
    don't carry that much (crucial) meaning. No?\r\n\r\nRe setting names in all small
    caps: Would you argue that in any circumstance/ application, proper names *need*
    (as in \"depend on\") the distinction between caps and lowercase? FWIW, my German
    I.D. card (of all things!) has my name in all caps. As do my credit card, my bank
    statement, etc. etc.\u2026 not to mention all the shop signs of this world that
    have the owners' names in all caps. & that seems to work. (Note that I'm not saying
    it's necessarily good practice; but it seems to work.)\r\n\r\nBTW, I don't generally
    believe in thusly bells-and-whistles-laden typography. Sometimes I just set text
    in the Roman, maybe some emphasis here and there and let it be, and that seems
    ideal. Some texts (or more precisely: some *readers* of some genres of texts)
    just seem to need more help than others\u2026 to my understanding."

  body: "As I said, in the first example of Nina, I think the short parens are an
    advantage. Also I have set a situation with a lot of Biblical references, with
    the abbreviation in all small caps and the figures in text figures, and they definitely
    looked better that way rather than full parens. I think that in some situations
    they are a definite design plus. \r\n\r\nI was wondering if in Nina's case there
    were just a few references, much repeated, then all small caps for the names might
    work. But it is pushing it. Often, as Joe says, putting full names in all small
    caps is problematic, but I do think there are situations in which the short parens
    are very useful. "

    differs from text to text. This is an anthology with, uh, 15 contributions, some
    of which are rather cluttered with references while others have only very few.\r\n\r\nStupid
    question of the day: Is it \"wrong\" if I set them in SC every time, not just
    the first time they appear? \r\nRationale: If I set them in mixed case once they
    appear the second time, I lose the benefit of \"pulling them away\" from the running
    text (by means of small caps / short parens); I assume the reader will get used
    to the idea that small parens with all small caps contain references, and skip
    over them more easily if he (or she) isn't interested. So having all references,
    whether they appear for the first time or not, set in the same way seems logical
    to me, even if maybe it doesn't look so pretty\u2026 What do you think?\r\n\r\nI'm
    actually working on \"streamlining\" the small caps and parens right now. \r\nWill
    be curious to do some test prints later and see if it's \"too much\"."
