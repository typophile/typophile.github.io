  here on Typophile. Also, this may be a completely know idea that I am not aware
  of:\r\n\r\nI have noticed that Roman and Medium weights of character sets ranging
  from serifs to sans tend to be much more invisible (I am not using the word neutral-
  too amorphous and vague) in the sense that when I look at type in this weight I
  see the ideas or \"words\" being conveyed before I see the type. Is this just me?"

  body: "I find hairline weights are much more invisible at text sizes.\r\n\r\nAll
    joking aside, I suspect it is mainly a function of what we are used to seeing
    as readers. Because texts in bolder or black weights (or hairline weights for
    that matter) are used mainly for emphasis, we just don't see them as often. When
    we do, we are distracted, so to speak, by the difference in texture from what
    we are used to seeing. We pick up, either consciously or not, that we are seeing
    a special type treatment.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, medium weights are defaults
    and we tend not to notice the type treatment as much, and go straight to seeing
    the message.\r\n\r\nFor someone used to seeing texts set predominantly in a blacker
    texture, as in blackletter to use a historical example, would text set in a relatively
    lighter colour corresponding to the medium weight be as invisible? I have my doubts."

    curious as to other's reactions to this idea. As in, why do you think this occurs?"

  body: "<cite>\u2026why do you think this occurs?</cite>\r\n\r\nI think that this
    goes back to the old notion that people read best what they read most. Typographic
    hierarchies aren\u2019t as variable as we think they are\u2014they\u2019re as
    much convention as they are a design tool. Type designers take advantage of this
    and create heavier weights to draw attention to themselves within the context
    they\u2019ll most likely be used."

    Thanks for enlightening a new kid to the amazing world of typography."
