body: Has anyone here seen <i>Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban</i>? There&#39;s
  a magical map in the film &#40;and book&#41; called the Marauder&#39;s Map. The
  film version is very cool. The whole map is, if I remember correctly, a calligraphic
  or typographic construction &#40;it&#39;s meant to appear hand-rendered, but uses
  a lot of type forms&#41;. The map shows the grounds of the school, and the locations
  of everyone inside, but instead of line drawings of structures, the walls and rooms
  are made of words. <BR> <BR>You can see a few abbreviated versions on <a href="http://www.azkaban.com">the
  movie site</a>, but they pale in comparison to the one in the film &#40;which is
  much more detailed&#41;. Has anyone else noticed this great prop? Any thoughts?
  Any other images?

  body: 'they should have gone into how the map came about more, it&#39;s actually
    a crucial plot element that actually ties in with other characters &amp; future
    event, but i thought it was well done. even better than the diary in #2.'

  body: 'If you can abide it, stick around after the movie; the credits are a 10-minute
    walk <BR> through the &#34;school grounds&#34; trailing fading footsteps along
    a close-up of the map,  <BR>past the hundreds of people involved in the production.
    I didn&#39;t have the stamina  <BR>to seek out the amazing calligrapher who made
    the hand-lettered map,  <BR>or who made the rustic font used for the titles, but
    I imagine there is a neat easter egg  <BR>when the footsteps arrive there. The
    footsteps sometimes take on unique characteristics so watch closely....  <BR>
    I found this one of the best parts &#40;characters&#41; in the movie. '

  body: This topic is also <a href="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/38833.html?1087841145">being
    discussed</a> over in the Type ID section. <BR> <BR>I thought the credits at the
    end were very entertaining. It looked a bit like oragami created by M.C. Escher
    and a calligrapher. At one point you see Sirius Black&#39;s footprints wander
    by and turn into paw prints &#40;or maybe the other way &#39;round?&#41;. We usually
    watch the credits anyway, but this one was worth staying for more than most.

  body: The bird prints wandering around the owlery were a nice touch, but my favourite
    gag was the half-dozen footprints quickly fleeing the stink bomb store room. <BR>
    <BR>I&#39;m sure there are many jokes hidden in the writing on the walls[1]. I
    know that if I had to write hundreds of lines of unreadable latin, I&#39;d include
    the names of friends and family, subliminal messages, the ending to the seventh
    book, etc. <BR> <BR>[1] In another scene, one of the doorframes is covered in
    runes. One rune that stood out was the <a href="http://www.deadkennedys.com/">Dead
    Kennedys</a>&#39; logo.

  body: Oh wow, I didn&#39;t see the DK logo. I&#39;ve got to look for it. This thread&#39;s
    just giving me more reasons to re-watch this film. <BR> <BR>Aside from it being
    the best of the series.

  body: '&#123;best in the series} definately the best of the books, not sure if i
    agree when talking about the movies, they got the look right, but the story telling
    was weaker, i thought. ah well, i still have my imagination intact. ;^&#41;'

  body: Chris, The DK logo is on Professor Lupin&#39;s door frame; outside, on the
    left, near the top. You see it as Harry enters the room on his last visit &#40;when
    he gets the map back&#41;.

  body: I meant the film, but the book is great as well. I prefer the later novels,
    where the politics and breadth of the magic world are revealed. I&#39;m a sucker
    for tales with a fully-realized world behind them. <BR> <BR>I&#39;ve also got
    a weak spot for the film&#39;s director, <a href="http://imdb.com/name/nm0190859/">Alfonso
