  body: "I ran the compareFamily to a bunch of bought fonts as well and got similar
    errors in them too so I'm wondering how relevant/critical these errors are? I
    understand the script was made for Adobe, so not all of the checks are relevant
    to others.\r\n\r\n_____________________\r\n<a href=\"http://www.dinariraqi.com/\">Iraqi

  body: "I think I've got the answer already : the paragraph says basically that,
    in case of the vowel \u0906 (AA), one should use the Unicode code U+0906 instead
    of combining the characters \u0905 (A) U+0905 with \u093E  U+093E. For instance,
    if you try this last alternative in MS Word, the combination of the two characters
    is not obtained. They are just printed one after the other.\r\n\r\nWhat I don't
    understand is why Unicode has to bother highlighting this. Isn't this an issue
    that should be handled by a specific font ?"

  body: I suggest that you buy a book about Sanskrit and read the chapter about the
    Devanagari script. This will answer all your questions. There is no harm reading
    a book.

    because it is a text encoding issue, not a display issue. Unicode defines how
    text should be encoded."

  body: "Let's assume you read this:\r\n\r\n<strong>The Latin letter \"w\" is encoded
    atomically by Unicode, even if it can be analyzed visually as consisting of \"v\"
    + \"v\".</strong>\r\n\r\nAn Indian will answer:\r\n\r\n\"w\" is an akhand letter
    unsplittable into any components (e.g. \"v\" + \"v\"), just like \"\u0906\" is
    an akhand letter unsplittable into any components.\r\n\r\nAnother example:\r\n\r\n\"&\"
    is not split by Unicode into any components (e.g. \"e\" + \"t\"). \"&\" is \"akhand\",
    i.e. unsplittable. The same is true for \"\u0908\", which is not split into any
    components. Who learns the alphabet at school, learns all this."

    page 5, printed page 270)\r\n\r\nLooking at \"\u0908\" and the repha hook of e.g.
    \"Adobe Devanagari\"\r\n\r\nsee http://www.sanskritweb.net/temporary/I0.jpg\r\n\r\nit
    seems to me that modern Devanagari font designers and even the authors of the
    Unicode manual think that the hook above \"\u0908\" is identical with the repha
    hook; hence the expression \"can be analyzed visually\" and hence the identical
    design of the hook above \"\u0908\" and the repha hook of e.g. the Adobe Devanagari
    font.\r\n\r\nHowever, looking at the historical development of the Devanagari
    script from the ancient Brahmi script to the modern Devanagari script, it seems
    apparent that e.g. the long vowel \"\u0908\" cannot be analysed visually as consisting
    of the short vowel \"\u0907\" plus the repha hook:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.sanskritweb.net/temporary/I1.jpg\r\nhttp://www.sanskritweb.net/temporary/I2.jpg\r\nhttp://www.sanskritweb.net/temporary/I3.jpg\r\n\r\nThe
