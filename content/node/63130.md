  it looks so familiar and I feel like I should know it, but I just can't pin down
  the name. The three swash caps are very distinctive and I've found a few \"close
  but no banana\" typefaces. Can somebody pinpoint the correct match?\r\n-- \r\nDave

  body: "That's exactly the problem I ran into. I came up with the same match for
    the numbers (via WTF of course), but no matches for the script. Since the capitals
    are what's really distinctive, I separated them out and tried WTF. A few \"close\",
    but no good matches.\r\n\r\nI've been trying to match this one for almost a year.
    Coming here was like admitting defeat. This is the first time I've ever asked
    for font ID help. *shame*\r\n-- \r\nDave Ward Photography\r\nhttp://www.DaveWard.net"

    hmmm, that makes me suspious it's a knockoff on a free site.\r\n\r\nSort of has
    the feel of <a href=\"http://www.dafont.com/font.php?file=old_script&page=1&nb_ppp_old=50&text=Braarud+Fine+Art&nb_ppp=50&psize=l&classt=alpha\">Old

  body: "@ Dave:\r\n\r\nI applaud your effort to ID this on your own and there's no
    shame in asking for a second option after you've put in an honest days work. Unfortunately,
    most of the requests for ID aren't of this caliber.\r\n\r\nMight I ask where you
    found this image... it doesn't match the wordmark on their site. http://www.braarudfineart.com/\r\n\r\nIt
    may very well be an artist with a nice hand for script but lacking on the numbers
    so they 'borrowed' them from Shelley.\r\n\r\nYou could always try emailing the
    company to ask."

    think it is hand-drawn, perhaps modeled on Shelley Andante and K\xFCnstler-Schreibschrift.\r\n\r\nAndreas"

  body: "It's definitely a real typeface. The sample is a scan I made from a small
    printed version. The source is only 2 inches wide, scanned on a pretty louse-quality
    scanner at 600 dpi with 4x magnification. I then had to burn some of the thin
    strokes in photoshop for them to even show up clearly. The bad scan and the burning
    unfortunately create a bit of an illusion of irregularity which isn't actually
    there on the original. Wish I had a better scanner.\r\n\r\nI was thinking maybe
    it's a fairly common script face that has seldom-used alternate caps?\r\n\r\nNot
    long ago I had to match another script face which really puzzled me for a while
    until I realized it was just Bickham, but with the alternate swash caps used for
    every single occurrence of a capital letter. Maybe this is a case like that?\r\n--

  body: Took another swing at this focusing attention away from the cap letters. (It
    looks so damn familar) The best I could do was <a href="http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/tilde/flemish-script/?testdrive=custom%3D0%26dock%3Dfalse%26size%3D118%26w%3D720%26src%3Dcustom%26text%3DBraarud%2520Fine%2520Art%26fg%3D000000%26bg%3Dffffff%26goodies%3Dfit%26seed%3D28">Flemish
    Script</a>, which is close but no cigar.

    this font and smack my forehead at how obvious it should have been.\r\n\r\nBut
    the fact that it's stumped everybody here makes me feel a bit better about getting

  body: "I checked Part 1 of the Script Font ID Guide and Jason Walcott's [[http://www.veer.com/products/typedetail.aspx?image=JBT0000035#characters|Opulence]]
    (which is his version of the old film type Zoom Script) comes closest to the three
    initials, but not exactly. Also, the lower case 'r' is completely the wrong style.\r\n\r\nI
    agree with Andreas that there are variations that should not be seen if this were
    truly a font. I think someone did a nice job of borrowing from several existing
    styles and created something familiar-looking, but unique - and hand-drawn. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n-
