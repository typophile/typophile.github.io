  body: "I seriously doubt Wonderful is a font. \r\n\r\nWinter Wonderland is probably
    this same unidentified script here: [[http://www.typophile.com/node/75981]], which
    could be either a font or lettering.\r\n\r\nLooking at them together they could
    well be from the same hand but with little or no tidying up in the Wonderful."

    Script</a>.
