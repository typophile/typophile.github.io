  font appears in Wordpad, Open Office, etc but never in the fonts menu of Illustrator
  CS2 and Photoshop 7.0. I'm on Vista. I absolutely need to use this font. How can
  I get access to it from those Adobe applications?\r\n\r\nProblem #2 : I have several
  Japanese fonts but they never show up in the font menu of Illustrator CS2. Why?
  They show up in all the other progs, even Photoshop 7.0.\r\n\r\nThanks for the help!"

  body: Fwiw, I have noticed some fonts won't appear in alphabetical order in Photoshop,
    but show up at the very end of the list. I'm guessing someone didn't name something
    correctly. Usually these are freeware fonts, but not always.
