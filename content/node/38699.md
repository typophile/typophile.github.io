  looking for some good ultra-lite serif faces to use at very large display sizes
  without looking like medieval cudgels. Would like it to (more or less) to not look
  too different from Adobe Arno, which is what the body text will be. . . clean and
  reserved.\r\nWould appreciate some suggestions. Sorry to be so lazy, but very busy
  presently. Thanks in advace.\r\nVelo"

  body: 'Thanks, I''ve seen this, and he offers some very useful fonts, but what I
    really need is serif, in book style, not sans serif, or slab serif. Similar to
    what the NYTimes Sunday Mag uses when they do their cute stuff with ultra slim
    book styles at huge sizes. '

    is in the critique section and has an ultra-light weight. It hasn't been released
    yet, but I'm hoping to get it out there pretty soon.

  body: "I like it actually. . . didn't like it at first, but that's because I worked
    all day and was too uptight and had a rod up my a**.\r\nAfter a break and bottle
    of Stella it comes off much better. . . Newt is a good name for it. It's eccentric
    but consistent in it's style. It would be a good face to set Rimbaud in. A very
    good effort."

  body: Thanks! I don't know quite when to expect it to be available; I'm still in
    the early-to-middle phases of getting it out, but I'm trying to move quickly.
    Rereading, I see you were looking for something like Arno, which Newt resembles
    very little, but I'm glad you like it anyhow! I've never read any Rimbaud, but
    he sounds like he would be a good fit. Wish I could be more specific about a release
    date.
