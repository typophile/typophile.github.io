  body: "Interesting request. The first thing that comes to mind is <A HREF=\"http://www.vllg.com/Feliciano/Flama/mudTyper+Weights/\">Flama</A>.\r\nIt's
    tough to visualize what this would look like.\r\nA geometric face but a little
    more expressive?\r\n\r\n<A HREF=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/jan-fromm/camingo/\">Camingo</A>\r\n\r\n<A

  body: The Klavika (Process Type) is a really nice font. To my eyes, it has a technical

    well).
