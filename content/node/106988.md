  body: "I agree that it is probably custom. The PANIGUA capitals seem to be built
    on the Gothic even width principle, using squared forms. The only unusual feature
    is the termination of the N diagonal in the middle of the right hand stroke rather
    than at the base. Another squared Gothic font with a similar, but less distinctive
    N is Big Noodle Titling \r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/BigNoodleTitling_6264.jpg]\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/sentinel/big-noodle-titling/\r\nUnfortunately
    the A does not have angled sides.\r\nDon"

  body: "Hi.. \r\n\r\nI'm in two minds as to wether to put you out of your misery..
    and have the font used all over the shop.. or keep  schtum ;).\r\n\r\nI designed
    the logo, it is a font, with a special character... but I kinda like that it's
    unique at the moment - so may keep it under my hat.. bribes accepted though ;-)\r\n\r\nJamie\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
