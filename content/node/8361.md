  body: Steve, It reads like a brokerage firm and not a real estate company. It needs
    to be clairified that its real estate and not a stock exchange investment firm.
    What does the graphic mean? The colors are way to harsh, they look like a farm
    cooperative, make them more subtitle/upscale &#40;think investment&#41;. I&#39;m
    not in love with letterspaced type, it looks like a mistake.

  body: I agree with Dan on the concept, doesn&#39;t scream realestate.  What kind
    of realestate? Low-end High-end? <BR> <BR>That would be the first question to
    tackle.

  body: Danel, leaving aside the question of whether it&#39;s appropriate, I don&#39;t
    think the letterspaced type looks like a mistake. IDAHO aligns nicely with the
    width of the mark, and the color change makes a longish URL easier to read.

  body: My problem Marc is it is forced. No design should look forced. The letter
    spacing is design for design sake. This is not an attack, just my opion. Steve
    still has to address Peters comment. Its not just about design its about marketing.

  body: Thanks to all for the feedback thusfar.  The business purpose is the marketing
    and sale of real estate investment property in Idaho.  We cater to a wide range
    of investors.  From the lower end individual that is looking for a smaller single
    family rental property to the large, possibly multi-party investor looking to
    invest 10 million in a development project.  The logo needs to cater to both parties
    and everyone in between.   <BR> <BR>I agree with the potential for confusion given
    the lack of clarity with regards to type of investment.  Are we an investment
    brokerage i.e. stocks or we do real estate or what?  However, I&#39;m reluctant
    to throw a house or some such in the logo as 1&#41; We&#39;re not just talking
    about houses and 2&#41; Real Estate logo with a house = very common. <BR> <BR>I&#39;m
    at a loss on how to move forward.

  body: Steve, try moving the website to another location in the communications and
    add a tagline that clairifies the business. What does the mark mean? Is it something
    that means something in Idaho?

  body: At first the yellow triangle with a secondary triangle cut out of it &#40;on
    the left&#41;, reminded me of a paper airplane...crashing, a few seconds later
    I realized it was properly a stylized star with most of it missing. It is perhaps
    clever as an icon, but a bit of a stretch to catch. I do not like it for this
    reason. <BR>Aligning the 3x I&#39;s is very nice, consistant with the idea of
    investing-building/stacking.... <BR>Altogether a good start-keep going...
