  reveal a message from an overlay of coloured type, a little like the 3d glasses
  principle.\r\n\r\ndoes anyone have any idea what the print process is for this,
  for example which pantones are recommended, where to get the filters etc...\r\n\r\ni
  have found a printers that can do this, but it is not a big run and i don't have
  the budget. can anyone help?"

  body: "Back in the 1950s, if I lost the glasses that came with a 3D comic book,
    I could make my own with lollipop wrappers (cherry and grape -- worked pretty
    well, actually). Many years later, when a local TV station broadcast \"Creature
    from the Black Lagoon\" in 3D, I made my own glasses (and those for several guests
    at a 3d TV party) from theatrical lighting gels. The gels are more readily available
    at stage lighting companies (check the Yellow Pages), are consistent in color
    and are reasonably priced.\r\n\r\nPrinting process is not important -- good-quality
    color copies will work as well as printing, but the exact colors you use will
    probably have to be determined by trial and error. In my limited experience of
    goofing around with 3D drawing, I found that lighter shades or red and blue work
    better at \"disappearing\" when the appropriate gel is used."

    think the inks need to be semi-transparent. It seem I have a book at home that
    has the english in red and the dutch in blue...or something like that. I'll have
    to find that and check it out for you. Unless, of course, someone knows how at
    the moment. \r\n\r\nIt seems to me that the printer you  have found that can do
    this would know which colors you should use. No?"

    I remember of the cheap \"magic window\" stuff, all you need is a pure red for
    the obscuring pattern and a light cyan for the hidden print. Both should be screened
    if possible. That way, the eye doesn't pick up telltale outlines because all it
    can see are dots."

    is simply titled Sagmeister, written by Peter Hall, and published by Booth-Clibborn
    Editions (2001). \r\n\r\nIt features a red plastic slipcase that, when on the
    book, displays an image of a happy German Shepard named Xeno. When you remove
    the slipcase, the image of Xeno changes from friendly hound to snarling attack
    dog. You can see it here:\r\nhttp://designblog.rietveldacademie.nl/?tag=dog"

    black-and-white movies (such as one of the early Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde movies)
    used red/green makeup and red/green lights to make a character's appearance change
    in real time. Since it was a b&w movie the audience couldn't see the color change."
