  gameshow. It looks strangely familiar but I can't put my finger on it. Any sggestions?

  body: "The lettering is certainly post-70's, since there were no DVD's then, but
    I can't find an exact match for the MR & MRS lettering. [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/bagraphics/metro-gothic/|Metro
    Gothic]] seems closest for the M and R; The '&\" looks a lot like the one in [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/bomparte/sidewalk-cafe/|Sidewalk
    Cafe]]; and the S is similar to [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/urw/neuland/|Neuland]],
    for one suggestion. Other Art Deco fonts may have been involved, and some customization
    might be needed in any case, but I think these would help you get close unless
    someone knows the identical font.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

    from 1995, and that one is an exact match.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: Thanks Mike. Metro Gothic is a great start and that Sidewalk cafe '&' is ideal.
    I'll get tweaking now! Cheers.
