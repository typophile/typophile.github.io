  design. It's name is Fil \r\nLink : [[http://www.behance.net/gallery/Fil-Typeface-New-Weights/2656255]]\r\n\r\nI've
  redesigned it and now i want to make metrics and kerning adjustments. But i haven't
  got any idea where should i start. I looked for in typophlie to many topics but
  my now my head is really confused about this preocess. I'm using both macintosh
  and pc.\r\n\r\nFirstable What is auto-kerning? This can be a magical solution for
  me bacause im a kind of new as i said and i'm sure you all agreee with me adjusting
  metrics is a little bit boring in the end of design part. Actually Kerning is also
  is a part of design but i want to be a typographer in a way like step by step or
  font by font. I cant learn whole process in a short time.. I used Fontographer and
  Fontlab, Fontographer is like very basic for this job but it have a non-working
  autokerning tool i think..Is there something like that in fontlab or any other apps.
  i want to learn is there another auto kerning tools like this any application or
  any tip. I found iKern service but you should know i'm a student. And Kernmaster
  is also not for a student i think.\r\n\r\nOk if theres no autokerning i have to
  make it with my hands..\r\n_Simply and generally what's the process?\r\n_Metrics
  vs Kerning? explainings for a very beginner, tips?\r\n_Metrics. How you decide this
  values\r\n_Kerning. Shoul i adjust this for every pair in the font or there re some
  chars and mostly these are need kerning. \r\n_How many pair need this. Yes it depends
  but im tryin to understand.\r\n_Can i use kerning values of a font that is very
  similar to mine. How.\r\n_If I started to adjust values how should i check them,
  Is there any method for this. I found KernKing txt. This is a right way? \r\n_OpticalKerning
  values in Adobe applications, can i export and use them? any patch, or downloadable
  script link?\r\n_Any good writings about this issue in external websites?? \r\n\r\n\r\nThank
  you all :)"

  body: "Hrant: \u2018<em>I think most people got it, but for some it's just not how
    their mind works.</em>\u2019\r\n\r\nI reckon that Hrant is speaking in tongues
    here, because I have no idea what he is talking about. Kerning is a re\uFB01nement
    of the spacing, which is necessary because the grapheme systems in use for representing
    the Latin script are to some extent inconsistent. This inconsistency is caused
    by the fact that within the grapheme systems, like for instance roman type, characters
    with a different morphological background are combined. Also the rigid rectangle-based
    movable type paradigm is something that requires (\u2018optical\u2019) corrections.\r\n\r\nIf
    one is able to design and space the stuff, kerning should be no problem then.
    Perhaps de\uFB01ning kern classes and enumerating pairs is considered tedious
    work, but kerning is just directly related to spacing and therefore by de\uFB01nition
    easier to generate than the spacing itself. What makes kerning complex, is that
    it should be done in such a way that it is reproducible. Whenever changes and/or
    enhancements are made to a font, new or additional kerning pairs with the same
    (sort of) values as that of the existing ones should be easy to generate in a
    fully controlled manner. Automated/parametrized kern generation makes this work
    easier and the outcomes more consistent. \r\n\r\nIf one thinks that manually,
    i.e. optically, kerning is better than automated/parametrized kerning, then it
    should be not too dif\uFB01cult to de\uFB01ne what exactly makes manually kerning
    better. The outcomes can be used then to change the parameters in such a way that
    the automated/parametrized kerning results are identical to that of manual kerning.\r\n\r\nFEB\r\n"

  body: "I like the overall look of this, but I think you've got some problems in
    letter design that are going to cause problems in spacing and kerning. If the
    internal space isn't harmonious, then the spacing and kerning is never going to
    look right. For example, I think the leg on your L is too long compared to the
    other characters. The L is one of those characters that perhaps Frank was referring
    to that you can't totally solve, but shortening the leg a little would help. Also
    I wonder aesthetically about the difference between your M and N, with totally
    different structures, and the narrowness of the M. Also your numbers need work;
    they are not as good as the letters.\r\n\r\nSo I think, like Thomas, that working
    on the spacing, but simultaneously adjusting the characters, is the way to start.
    Because of its design, with single case, straight sides, bent arms on the VWXY
    it may not need a lot of kerning, maybe none at all."

    is when a font starts coming together, and really working... To me, it <em>is</em>
    like zen: slowly, iteratively ironing out the wrinkles, smoothing the bumps in
    the pattern just enough, and learning, learning to see. And that's why I'd very
    much disagree with James: If you want your first one(s) to be a learning experience,
    learning to space and kern them can teach you very much. (If on the other hand
    your main motivation is getting the thing out there, do look at algorithms, or
    other people; because really learning to do this takes some time :-), and like
    Hrant says, not everyone enjoys it equally.)"

    letterforms as integral to their spacing/kerning\u2019</em>\r\n\r\nThe more I
    measure Renaissance type, the more I am convinced that the proportions of Jenson\u2019s
    and Griffo\u2019s roman types, and their derivatives by Garamont and consorts,
    were the result of standardizations and systematization\u2019s in the production
    process of movable type, and that Jenson even \u2018designed\u2019 his famous
    roman on a grid. The spacing was de\uFB01ned by the grid and the length of the
    serifs preserved the spacing. Although not speci\uFB01cally on this part, I already
    placed some info on this <a href=\"http://typophile.com/node/73675\">topic</a>.\r\n\r\nWith
    a standardized system for the widths a punch cutter could theoretically control
    the spacing of his type \u2018from a distance\u2019, and hence the quality of
    the complete production. If the justi\uFB01er/caster was aware of such a system
    and the type was based on it, the widths could be simply distilled from the design
    itself. The simplicity of such a system could be an explanation for the fact that
    there is no documentation on this matter preserved from the early days of typography.
    \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As we all know, an incorrect
    spacing can ruin a typeface. The simplest possible method which might have been
    used by casters that I could reconstruct, is to take the n (designed on a grid)
    as a basis and to put just a little bit space at both sides of the serifs (the
    length of the serifs being based on the unit arrangement system). The resulting
    width can then be used for a large range of other letters and other groups of
    letters can be placed on widths based on parts (ranges of simple units) of the
    n. For instance I could distill this from Garamont\u2019s <em>Gros Canon Romain</em>
    type and the related <em>Moyen Canon Romain</em> from Van den Keere in the inventory
    of the Museum Plantin-Moretus, which are attributed to the sixteenth century (there
    is no documentation on the casting of these speci\uFB01c types and the dating
    is therefore a bit uncertain; I am trying to get the C14 method applied to the
    alloy, but it seems that there is not enough carbon in it).\r\n\r\nHrant: \u2018<em>But
    how do you quantize eyeballing?</em>\u2019\r\n\r\nThe power of the human eye is
    purely relative to the anatomy of the things perceived. In <em>Art and Illusion</em>
    (Oxford, 1987 p.255) Gombrich notes on this phenomenon: \u2018<em>The stimulus
    patterns on the retina are not alone in determining our picture of the visual
    world. Its messages are modified by what we know about the \u201Creal\u201D shape
    of objects</em>\u2019\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, a
    lot that we (think/want to) see is based on conditioning. Conditioning is based
    on conventions and conditioning preserves conventions. Thus the snake bites its
    own tail; to be able to use one\u2019s \u2018eye\u2019 like Fournier advocated,
    one has to be educated to look at type in the same way. What is considered to
    be harmonic, rhythmic and \xE6sthetic in type is merely the result of conditioning,
    i.e. cultural habituation.\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
    \u2018eyeballing\u2019 in case of type is purely relative to the underlying model.
    Sometime ago my Dean said that some matters [in art] can\u2019t be de\uFB01ned
    and I replied that if these can\u2019t be de\uFB01ned they simply don\u2019t exist.\r\n\r\nFEB\r\n"

    went nuts over the past 2 days.  Therefore, it would make more sense if read just
    after Nina's post above instead of today:\r\n\r\nFrank, The digital type variation
    on the unit system is indeed a grid, albeit much finer than what we typically
    call a grid.  The proportion categories of the roman alphabet have been around
    for centuries so I can easily see how the \"system\" you refer to in your theory
    is quite plausible.  While I can certainly agree that an analysis could bring
    about some repeatable mathematical process, I don't, for the time being, see that
    this would be faster than what Hrant calls \"eyeballing\"--at least not for me.
    \ If your latest  software, now in beta, can remove all the calculations for the
    user and \"know\" a very good outcome, this could certainly change my mind.  I
    guess my fear is that it would not do what I want and require adjustment, anyway.
    \ There are several ways to set spacing/sidebearings and the kerning needs to
    work in consort with the spacing method.  Hopefully, there is an \"open marriage\"
    possible where by the user (marriage councilor) can keep harmony among all parties.\r\n\r\nI
    agree with Nina's assertion about spacing and kerning being part of the whole
    design journey.  I find that there are glyph drawing corrections required and
    part of the \"tinkering process\" that we call type design.  The act of spacing
    and fitting places a focus on what may be weaker combinations that need to be
    revisited in the drawing--or even {calt} substitutions of alternates.  I would
    be nervous about turning kerning over to a software process and missing this vital
    part of the process without having the ability to reteach the software to follow
    what I might think of as a better path.  Yes, Nina, it takes some time--I seem
    to be getting slower rather than faster at design with the more I learn ;-).  This
    experience is invaluable though.  Turning over the space/kern process to software
    without the ability to understand what is being done, can leave you blind to what
    the results should be.\r\n\r\nAt any rate, I have come to agreeable terms with
    kerning and learned not to try and hurry through it any more."
