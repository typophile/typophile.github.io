body: "Greetings Typophiles, and Stefan Seifert in particular,\r\n\r\nAs you know,
  I've been playing with Centaur for some years now. I'm in love with the original
  metal version in all its optically scaled splendor. I consider the digital version
  available from Monotype to be inferior in quality, especially when compared with
  the intense beauty of the original. I've had discussions on and off with the folks
  at Monotype, but ultimately their business interests and my primarily scholarly
  interests in the font do not match well.\r\n\r\nI have fairly little time these
  days to draw letters, so, at the rate I'm going, it would be years before my Centaur
  designs would be complete enough to make a real font release. Yet, I feel it would
  be a shame for people not to have some access to the work I've done.\r\n\r\nThus,
  I have decided to make a release of the incomplete work in progress. It consists
  of four optically scaled variants. In order of increasing robustness, those include
  Monotype Centaur 60pt, Monotype Centaur 14pt, Monotype Bible Centaur 18pt, and Foundry
  Centaur 14pt. Most variants contain most of a-z, some contain a fairly complete
  A-Z as well, the Bible version contains 0-9, and there is very minimal punctuation.\r\n\r\nI
  am calling this release \"Museum\". I cannot legally call it Centaur, even though
  that is its true name, because of trademark law. As it turns out, \"Museum\" is
  the original name chosen by Bruce Rogers, so there is some historical justification.\r\n\r\nHere
  is the <a href=\"http://levien.com/type/myfonts/museum.html\">release</a>, including
  all FontForge and Spiro files.\r\n\r\nI hope that Typophiles enjoy these fonts and
  even manage to get some use from them. Since they are released under OFL, the door
  is open for someone else to come along and collaborate by filling out the glyph
  range. Last but not least, people may enjoy opening the Spiro drawings and seeing
  the logic behind the outlines.\r\n\r\nOther previous threads relevant to this one:\r\n\r\n<a

    years to finish a self-started font is actually not uncommon.  :-)\r\n\r\nA couple
    of things:\r\n1) So your four cuts are individual revivals of those four\r\nexisting
    fonts? As in no interpolation? Do they harmonize?\r\n2) Museum is a lousy name,
    sorry. Tying in with\r\nthe mythical flavor of Centaur, what about Muse?\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    a museum!\" fun to be had in the studio ;-)\r\n\r\nCouple of other ideas are Chiron
    and Lapith: \r\n\r\nChiron was \"the superlative centaur\" who in _Faust_ imparts
    \"important lessons in [Faust's] search for complete understanding.\" - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chiron\r\n\r\n\"Lapithes
    and Centaurus were said to be twin sons of the god Apollo and the nymph Stilbe\"

    springs to mind: Kellyson."

  body: "This is the second thread I'm resurrecting here, but I love this font, and
    I really hope to see a full version of Museum (or at least as full as is possible).\r\n\r\nIn
    the meantime, I've made a FrankenCentaur of my own using the letters from Museum
    Foundry, as much punctuation as I could get out of Museum Fourteen, the figures
    from Museum Bible, and everything else from a combination of Museum Bible and
    Centaur MT (with glyphs from the latter increased 10 em points in FontForge).
    \ It's my first time messing with the innards of a font, but I'm pretty happy
    with the results.\r\n\r\nHere's a sample that I typed up from the only book I
    own in Centaur (that I'm aware of anyway), Shambhala Centaur Editions' <em>Wild
    Ways - Zen Poems of Ikkyuu</em>:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/fisherman_3749.png]\r\nThe
    top image is using the custom Centaur, the middle image is with Centaur MT, and
    the bottom image is a detail of the first image, chosen because the fi lig is
    from Bible Centaur, while the ff lig is from the increased-weight Centaur MT."

    \r\nBe careful with that. Monotype might not like you distributing their \"proprietary\"
    typeface, even if only a tiny part.\r\n\r\nBut your sample shows how Raph's Centaur
    would hold up in poor printing conditions, as the screen rendering that you have
    is as bad or worse as any poorly printed page."
