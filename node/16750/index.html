<p>Modifications to the mold to create kerning is done by altering the set-width of the mold at the casting machine. Letters that are normally cast flush to the sidebearings can be undercut on the right side to kern onto the shoulder of the following letter. This subtraction of width is at the discretion of the casterman and can be overdone. All characters have a set-width designation stamped on the matix. When followed these widths create proper fitting and in the case of letters like f (roman) a kern is automatically created. In italic matrix suites there are many letters that kern on the right side and make tight fitting in a line.</p>
<p>Justification is the term given to the process of trimming the extra depth that results when a steel punch is over-depth into the matrix metal blank. Matrices are always over-driven since it is not really possible to strike the depth dead accurately. As a result the strike is made a couple of thousandths of an inch too deep and the face of the matrice is trimmed off to make the depth consistent over the entire suite of matrices. In bygone days this was done by rubbing the matrix on a file and trial casting until the height of the lead type was correct. I have two Ludlow Super Surfacers that I have adapted to trim as little as one quarter of a thousandth at a time, and this saves a lot of sore thumbs.</p>
<p>Some people use the term Justification to mean the side fitting of one letter to another, but the more common meaning is the trimming of the matix to depth.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve always heard it used to mean the lateral fitting aspect, since the  matrix bulges when stuck. In fact I was ignorant of the -now obviously very relevant- depth issue!</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>&lt;w=em&gt;3)Does broadnib pen equal the quill pen?
What is a split-nib pen? Does it equal a quill pen with disposable metal nib?</em></p>
<p>Broad nib and split nib refer to the way in which the nib of a pen, whether quill, reed, metal, etc. is shaped and hence the characteristics of the ink flow and kind of strokes and contrast patterns that can be made with the pen. A broad nib has defined width that determines stroke contrast. A split nib is thinner, pointed and much more flexible, so stroke contrast is determined by pressure rather than by the shape of the nib: the more pressure you apply, the heavier the stroke. As you apply pressure, the two sides of the split nib move apart from each other, but the surface tension of the ink means that the stroke itself does not split (unless you apply too much pressure; this has sometimes been exploited by calligraphers). Split nibs are usually made of metal, since it is stronger and can be flexed without fear of breaking. It is possible to make a split nib from a feather or from a reed, but the material is is less durable and, in the case of the feather, too brittle to last long.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>While this thread is nearly ten years old, and our friend Jim Rimmer is no longer with us, it might be worth adding a few comments.<br>
(1)  Jim&rsquo;s response is absolutely correct regarding modern casting machines, in which the matrices are often of a fixed overall dimension (these are frequently called &lsquo;flat mats&rsquo; or &lsquo;display mats&rsquo;).  In such cases the type caster dials in the correct &lsquo;set width&rsquo; of the intended character and the design of the machine will make a type of that width. Adjustments for alignment are also a frequent part of the casting process.
In pivotal casting machines, or the traditional hand mould, the foundry style matrix varies in width according to the character it carries. An i matrix will be narrower than a W matrix by the difference in the set width of the two sorts.  In the hand mould the substitution of one matrix for another automatically changes the set width, because the hand mould closes against the sides of the matrix for each cast.  In the pivotal caster this adjustment is made by loosening a large bolt and shifting the relationship of the two mould halves.  The pivotal caster was the first machine for casting type and its mould shares many of the features of the hand mould.
Regardless of the specific mould or machine, the kern is formed when the casting cavity is narrower than the letter sunk into the matrix, so that a portion of the matrix overlaps the bottom of the mould.   Metal flows into the overlapping portion and results in an extension of the letter that protrudes beyond the body of the cast type.</p>
<pre><code> (2)  Fitting or justifying a foundry matrix is a delicate task that involves a variety of steps.  (a.)  Fitting for depth of drive is described by Jim above.  Driven matrices, made with a punch are often slightly uneven in depth as well as being 'over driven'.  So the matrix must be adjusted to make the face of the 'eye' of the matrix parallel to the surface, and of the proper depth:  ie. A common depth of drive for display faces is .050&quot;.  (b.) Matrices must also be adjusted so that the letter appears upright or vertical, or in the case of italics it must have the correct slope.  Even when great care is taken in driving the punch a letter may be struck out of vertical.  Special 'squares' are used to check this, but in many cases it is finally a matter of using one's 'eye' to determine if a letter is standing up straight. (c.) The head bearing must be adjusted in order to align the types.  With the matrix's depth established and the letter made upright, one cuts away the end of the matrix, above the eye, so as to raise the position of the cast letter. Little by little metal is cut away and trial casts made until the base line of the letter is aligned with the rest of the font.  A special tool called an alignment gauge is used for this task. The visual requirements involved are the same as are now requisite for a digital type face.  (d.) The side bearing must be consistent from one matrix to another, while also establishing the proper 'set width' for the letter.  Side bearing is the metal margin on either side of the 'eye' (struck letter) of the matrix. It is critical that the proper amount of metal be removed, yet not too much. This is a highly subjective element in the process and fraught with peril, as it is quite easy to take off too much metal from the side of the matrix.  In the event that too much metal is filed or milled away the fitter can 'botch' the side of the matrix, raising a series of 'burs' with a chisel. These act to make the matrix wider, although they are not attractive and can wear down with frequent use.
 So you see, the traditional methods of fitting a foundry matrix to be cast with a hand mould or pivotal caster require hours of diligent, skilled work -- usually at least two hours per matrix.  Modern flat mats also require meticulous fitting, with only a few variations in the specific standards needed for the 'modern' caster. 
See &quot;Fournier on Typecasting&quot; translated by Harry Carter, for detailed information on this subject.  </code></pre>
