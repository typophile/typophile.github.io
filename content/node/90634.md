body: "Hello my friends at typophile.com\r\n\r\nAfter installing my new fonts in the
  system and opening Photoshop or InDesign or Illustrator and starting using my fonts,
  I had terrible problems with kerning facilities.\r\n\r\nWhen I use \"Optical\" or
  \"0\" kerning options, I get a great view of my fonts but when I use \"Metrics\"
  option, I have a disgusted overlapping with letters of my fonts. You can get more
  about this problem in attached images. I try to check the kerning pairs in my designed
  fonts and find that the kerning pairs are all prepared correctly and they have no
  problem at all.\r\n\r\nCould any one help me in finding a solution for this sophisticated
  problem.\r\n\r\nThank you for your time and help.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/1_6485.jpg][img:sites/default/files/old-images/2_3703.jpg][img:sites/default/files/old-images/3_4900.jpg][img:sites/default/files/old-images/4_5218.jpg][img:sites/default/files/old-images/5_5464.jpg][img:sites/default/files/old-images/6_4394.jpg][img:sites/default/files/old-images/7_5973.jpg][img:sites/default/files/old-images/8_4526.jpg]"

  body: It seems that it is a complicated problem. I do need a reply for such problem
    and I will be so thankful for that. It really frustrated me and made me so disappointed
    and I have a real impasse. Please, give me a solution and help me.

  body: "Did you generate the fonts as TrueType TTF or Postscript OTF? \r\n\r\nWhat
    is the UPM setting for the font?\r\n\r\nGo to InDesign and type \u2018VA\u2019
    (or any one of your problem pairs), place the cursor between the two letters and
    look in the Character > Kerning field. What value does it indicate (it should
    be given in parentheses)?\r\n\r\nIt seems like somewhere along the lines, your
    values are getting magnified, which suggests to me a mismatch between the units
    and the UPM and the format (or Adobe interpretation)."

  body: "Charles \u2014 I think one of us has misunderstood the question. I took the
    problem to be one where the values appear correct in the Font Creator program,
    but do not appear correctly when the font is set in Adobe applications.\r\n\r\nFor
    instance, the \u201CVA\u201D pair is shown in the screenshot from Font Creator
    with -117 kern pair value. But in the first screenshot, from Photoshop with Metrics
    kerning applied (i.e., the font\u2019s native values), the \u201CVA\u201D pair
    is obviously not being interpreted as -117. Unfortunately, Photoshop won\u2019t
    show you the value it\u2019s applying in this instance. Which is why I suggested
    reading it out of InDesign (which the o.p. says also exhibits the problem, if
    I read that correctly).\r\n\r\nLooking at the Font Creator screenshots, I'm seeing
    by the values that this is probably designed on a TT 2048 upm. I\u2019m thinking
    that maybe through some kind of mismatch somewhere along the way, the Adobe applications
    are assuming that this font is set on 1000 PS upm, yet still somehow applying
    absolute kerning values, not relative. That\u2019s just a wild-ass guess, which
    is why I was asking for more specific information to support or dispel some of
    my theory.\r\n"
