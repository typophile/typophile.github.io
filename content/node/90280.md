body: "In FontLab Studio 5.0.4 I'm opening a Type1 font that was generated by Fontographer
  3.5 on the PC. I'll eventually be adding small caps, Greek and some miscellaneous
  other things. I got the very basics working and decided to test things before adding
  in my small caps, Greek, etc. and exported as an OTF / PS. \r\n\r\nIn InDesign I
  noticed that text in a frame whose first line was set to \"Ascent\" was shifting
  up a bit from where it set in the Type1 font.\r\n\r\nLooking back at Fontographer
  the Ascent value was 714. Given that Fontlab was showing the \"Ascender\" to be
  685 I changed it to 714 figuring that would fix things. Hoever, it did not.\r\n\r\nWhen
  I open the OTF I just generated from Studio with \"Ascender\" set to 714, the \"Ascender\"
  value is back to 685. DTL Typemaster Light shows the same thing, no 714.\r\n\r\nI've
  read through many a post regarding these things but it simply seem like Studio isn't
  outputting the correct numbers. Is there an open or generate option I'm missing?
  Shouldn't the Ascender value be what I typed into that field?\r\n\r\nThanks for
  any help ,\r\nKen"

    issue.\r\n\r\nSo, the OpenType generation acually uses the numbers on the TrueType
    tab? Not sure I would have guessed that.\r\n\r\nThanks again!\r\nKen"

    have to assume that you have FL, and are able to open a font file (pfb, ttf, otf,
    or vfb) and view it.\r\n\r\nFrom the basic font display (the one that shows all
    the glyphs in the font), click on the little box at the upper left hand corner
    of that display. That brings up FONT INFO.\r\n\r\nExpand 'Metrics and Dimensions'
    (click on the plus sign next to the words). Right under the label \"Caps Height\"
    is a box labeled \"Copy values to TrueType metrics:.\r\n\r\n  - Herb\r\n\r\n"
