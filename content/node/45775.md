  body: "back in 2001 I got my first linux-enabled computer, dual booting with windows
    XP.  I had gotten used to photoshop and weaned myself from corel.  Slowly I started
    playing around with linux more, until the only thing I still booted into windows
    for was photoshop.\r\n\r\nThe GIMP was there, but it didn't have filters.  Yeah,
    it did everything else, but it wasn't as easy because I actually had to *do* whatever
    I wanted.\r\n\r\nIt's easy to click 'drop shadow' and see a drop shadow, but when
    I started using the GIMP I learned how drop shadows are actually made - to think
    about what it was I was doing.  I would make a copy of the shape, bump it down
    a layer and then fill it with black, blur it and then set the opacity to where
    I wanted it.\r\n\r\nThis functionality of *actually doing it* is still possible
    in photoshop, there's nothing stopping you.  Yes filters are there for your convenience
    and also as a way to copy your transformations into a style to be quickly applied
    to new objects, or to be transferred from one person to another.\r\n\r\nI equate
    it to this:  Learning to play a musical instrument involves both the ability to
    play, as well as the understanding of musical theory to be a good player.  If
    you taught somebody how to play an instrument, but ignored the theory and just
    always told them the right answer instead of equipping them with the knowledge
    they need to figure it out on their own, you're not helping them become a good
    musician, you're handicapping them and as long as they're paying you, you're cheating
    them out of money.\r\n\r\nTeach how to make a drop shadow without the filters,
    that process is the same everywhere.  Teach them to think about inner glows and
    strokes and all of that good stuff and get them to do it by hand and submit that.
    \ Learning layer effects they can EASILY do once they have that knowledge, but
    learning only layer effects won't help them one bit when they sit down at any
    bitmap editor other than Adobe\xAE Photoshop\xAE ;-)\r\n\r\nI HIGHLY HIGHLY recommend
    teaching photoshop in conjunction with software such as the GIMP, which is cross-platform
    as well as open-source.  Make it known how it's done in 2 different current programs
    and they'll hopefully seperate the skills for bitmap editing from the editor and
    be better able to adapt to the next bitmap editor that comes along.\r\n\r\nIt's
    like teaching web design versus teaching Adobe\xAE Dreamweaver\xAE web design.
    \ So many people who can manage to make a website in dreamweaver call themselves
    designers, but they don't know the first thing about the code they 'wrote' with
    dreamweaver and are lost without it.\r\n\r\n\r\nA good exercise for these kidlin's
    might be to have them take a source image, and re-create it first using their
    brains in one layer group, and then again as close as they can using photoshop
    layer effects, which I do believe are important to know, but only after you know
    what it is they are doing."

  body: "People who can\u2019t come up with an intelligent argument against Photoshop
    filters on their own probably don\u2019t know enough about Photoshop to be allowed
    to teach it in the first place. While many of the art and brush stroke filters
    left over from the 1990s should be jettisoned for the betterment of advertising
    aesthetics overall, there are also many extremely useful filters that production
    artists, designers, and photographers benefit from and need to know how to use
    if they\u2019re to effectively utilize contemporary technology.\r\n\r\nWhen I
    took painting classes, we learned about paint, brushes, thinners, varnishes, canvas,
    stretchers, boards etc. Drawing and drafting classes got into the details of pencils,
    pens, charcoal, crayons, rules, triangles, and scales. And when I took digital
    classes I learned how to use After Effects, Photoshop, Maya, and so on. An art
    education cannot just get wrapped up in theory and creativity\u2014it needs to
    teach the tools as well. Otherwise the students end up with a limited toolbox
    that will end up holding them back creatively when they can\u2019t get the software
    to do something important."

  body: "I whole heartedly agree with you James - many things that have remained with
    software are relics of a much uglier time in computer graphics.\r\n\r\nI just
    think there ought be be a balance between yes, teaching the tools needed, versus
    teaching one BRAND so well that they can't use anything else.\r\n\r\nTeach to
    educate but don't teach them into a corner.\r\n\r\nImagine if you were learning
    painting and they taught you how to use one brand's stuff SO well that you couldn't
    pick up another company's product and use it?  that would be both a useful and
    a useless education at the same time.\r\n\r\nLooking back, Adobe's huge, it's
    good, it's not going to go anywhere, but software changes, standards change, product
    lines merge and flex.\r\n\r\nI learned multi-page layout using Scribus, an open-source
    program most similar to Quark.  I know photoshop and illustrator (and hence the
    Adobe way of doing things).  I sat down at InDesign and in 10 minutes I knew how
    ot use it because I had 2 things:\r\n\r\n- I knew what multi-page layout software
    COULD do, I knew what to expect to find and how things worked\r\n\r\n- I knew
    the tools in that specific interface because they were analogous to tools in the
    rest of Adobe's suite.\r\n\r\nI then took an InDesign course that taught InDesign
    alone, and in the process, multi-page layout.  I sat down at a friend's computer
    that had Quark, which none of us had used and surprise surprise, I was the only
    one who could even begin to use it.\r\n\r\nTeach them 'bitmap editing' skills
    and theory separate from 'Adobe Photoshop as a bitmap editor' in the same class
    yes, it's important to know, but please separate the two so the people know they
    know more than just photoshop thanks to their education."

    photoshop that's why she asked me. I have already told her my argument against
    filters which essentially was that they're a tool not to be used in excess. There
    is a time and place but that should not be the extent of someone's education.
    But we are talking high school here so what is being taught should be basics.
    At the basics are photoshop filters. \r\n\r\nThanks for the other thoughts."

  body: "You mean the filter pull-down menus in Photoshop itself?\r\n\r\nWell, they
    don't calibrate the monitor.\r\n\r\nThey don't make you get you the characteristic
    of an output device (printer), so you can write conversion routines (aka custom
    profiles) so your printed work will match what you see on you now-calibrated monitor.\r\n\r\nThey
    don't force you to label your colorspace, so that anyone else who has do work
    with your image files (except people like printers, who don't use profiles) know
    where you started from.\r\n\r\nCome on, guys, there is basic stuff that has to
    be attended to before any other work can be done. \r\n\r\nAnd, there is no filter
    for sour grapes."

  body: "Well what I bleieve should be taught before any work is done is:\r\n\r\nfile
    formats!\r\n\r\nexplain how PNG, JPG, GIF, TIFF, PDF, PS, PSD all work, what their
    differences are and when to use them (if ever)\r\n\r\nToo many designers still
    send me files as compressed JPG at 90DPI and expect that I can use them for print
    work.\r\n\r\nResolution!\r\n\r\nTeach the kids a basic colour theory, the difference
    between additive (light) and subtractive (pigment)  because like it or not, they're
    probably taking photographs and eventually wanting to print them down the road,
    yet they don't understand the conversion that's taking place to get there.\r\n\r\nColour
    Theory!\r\n\r\nwhy not teach the kiddlins revisioning!  how to save and name their
    files for easy access and how to properly label and colour-categorize their photoshop
    files to make it easy to come back to after a year, or for another designer to
    understand!\r\n\r\nThe art of making and saving clean files is often the difference
    between talented designers and employed talented designers.\r\n\r\nYes, not all
    of these are photoshop-specific, but you can't possibly create anything in PS
    without this knowledge and use it.\r\n\r\nYou and I both know the main reason
    kids want to learn photoshop is to mimic the cool effects they saw on band poster
    x, or so they can spice up their myspace pages, which is the beginnings of a passion
    for design > water that seed by equipping them with the knowledge to create things
    beyond just photos and avatars and maybe they'll grow up to be designers some
    day!"

  body: "My argument would be, \"There is so much more to Photoshop (and digital art)
    than applying filters.\" As others have already pointed out, there are basics
    that need to be taught before you even get around to applying filters: working
    with bitmaps, working with resolution (including how to properly re-size an image),
    pixel graphics versus vector graphics, scanning a photograph, color correction,
    working with levels, curves, etc. Oh, and RGB vs. CMYK (!).\r\n\r\nOn the other
    hand, to echo innovati, one ex-high school graphics teacher has told me that his
    students just wanted to learn how to make \"cool-looking graphics\" and were impatient
    with \"theory.\" That doesn't seem to be the case here, though."

  body: "This is such a big topic, but I think a prerequisite course dealing with
    output devices and resolution would be a good way to start. Too many people rasterize
    type at 300 dots, and would never know what a 1200 dot 1-bit file was good for.
    I don\u2019t think you can build a proper file without knowing where is it headed,
    and that leads to color management etc. If a student had a fully developed sense
    of the production environment they would have a sense for the goal of using a
    powerful raster program rather than using filter to make some digital mess.\r\n\r\nFilters
    typically simplify a series of more complex moves. Maybe a good way to teach filters
    would be to have the students reproduce the effect without the filter."

    path of least resistance leads to the garbage heap of dispair.', would be all
    about understanding that less is not more. \r\n\r\nPhotoshop filters, layer styles
    and plug-ins too, should shown after learning how to stroke with the Pen tool,
    etc.. Fortunately, with photoshop there's at least three different ways to achieve
    the same digital technique ;)\r\n\r\nIs your friend's course more about post camera
