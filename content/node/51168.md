  it through the GD extension in PHP i'm not satisfied. attached is an example with
  too much space around the numeral 1.\r\n\r\ni'm guessing that ft2 could do better
  but the interface (i.e. [[http://us2.php.net/manual/en/function.imagefttext.php|imagefttext()]])
  provides minimal control.\r\n\r\nwhat other freetype front-ends should i consider?
  command-line tools, perl/ruby scripts, php extensions etc. are fine but i'm not
  going to program my own front-end in C.\r\n\r\nalternatively, are there other rasterizes
  i should consider?"

  body: Are you sure that space around the numeral 1 isn't due to the font metrics
    themselves? Fonts with [[tabular figures]] always have more space around the 1
    because the numerals are monospaced. To set text and headlines I would use a font
    with [[proportional figures]].

  body: "stephen, thanks for the tip. i'm embarrassed to discover that i failed to
    consider this possibility when selecting type font.\r\n\r\nthis is ITC Highlander\xAE
    by ITC Std Bold Italic. i just generated this sample from the linotype web site.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/mls-1_5660.png]\r\n\r\nso
    the numerals are not exactly monospaced but the pitch of the 1s on the top row
    surprisingly low, lower even than that of the 2s. and the 1 at the end of the
    last four lines looks like the beginning of a new word.\r\n\r\ni'm really not
    sure what to make of this. i'll be very disappointed if i need to scrap this choice
    of font."

  body: "I think the vast space around the '1's indicates that Highlander's figures
    are indeed tabular, as is the case with most fonts in the ITC range. Not sure
    what is happening in the '2' and '5' rows.\r\n\r\nHere are two alternatives to
    consider that have proportional figs:\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/singles/itc/itc_legacy_sans_bold_italic_osf/?sample_text=Legacy%201234567890&sample_size=48\">ITC
    Legacy Sans</a>\r\n<a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/singles/underware/sauna_bold_italic/?sample_text=Sauna%200123456789&sample_size=48\">Sauna</a>\r\n\r\nYou'll
    note that these are <em>oldstyle</em> or text figures, which means they descend
    and ascend like lowercase letters. Your options of fonts with proportional <em>lining</em>
    figures (numerals of the same height) will increase substantially if Freetype
    can take advantage of the figure options in OpenType fonts. Can it?"

  body: "hi stephen,\r\n\r\nthanks. and again, i think you're right. concerning the
    odd misalignments in the sample i posted above, i'd guess the linotype.com sample
    renderer left aligned bounding boxes rather than the glyph origins.\r\n\r\none
    important application i have is radio station IDs as web page title in a banner
    box. surrounded by a 4-capital call sign and a 2-capital waveband, oldstyle figures
    for the frequency look rather odd -- as though a beret or turtleneck-wearing designer
    might have been involved;-)\r\n\r\ni read the freetype documentation now. it loads
    font files, handles their info and renders glyphs. laying out a string is done
    by the library's client so my original question was confused. [[http://www.libgd.org/Font#char_.2AgdImageStringFT.28gdImagePtr_im.2C_int_.2Abrect.2C_int_fg.2C_char_.2Afontname.2C_double_ptsize.2C_double_angle.2C_int_x.2C_int_y.2C_char_.2Astring.29_.28FUNCTION.29|GD's
    string renderer]] accepts utf8 and html entities so i could use osf if i really
    wanted to.\r\n\r\nbut i think basically GD/freetype are doing what they are supposed
    to do given the font's design. my obvious choices seem to be: 1) choose another
    font; 2) find another text layout library that allows some kind of kern tagging
    of the string (i looked and didn't find); or 3) keep the font, GD and freetype
    and use a hack in  my php script to effectively trim the bearing and advance of
    1 numerals and perhaps decimal points."

    off the bearing and advance (respectively) off  numeral 1. and 3% and 0% from
    decimal point. looks ok now.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Picture_6071.png]\r\n\r\ncritique,
    anyone?"
