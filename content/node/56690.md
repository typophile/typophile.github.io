  want to know what happend if I do an autospacing to my whole font if I did manual
  kerning (OTF) The autospacing will affect my manual kerning? Or are they 2 separate
  things in the font?\r\n\r\nThanks in advance!"

  body: Spacing and kerning are two different things. Spacing is modifying the sidebearings
    on each separate letter. Kerning is modifying space between a letter pair. Fontlabs
    autospacing doesn't seem to be very good, btw.
