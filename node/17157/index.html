Extensis has released a new font manager, Suitcase Fusion. It incorporates some of the most popular features from both the Font Reserve and Suitcase font managers. In particular, it uses FontSense technology for auto-activation to distinguish between Postscript name duplicates. It also supports face-level activation of Macintosh font suitcases. 

There is also an flash animation on the main Extensis page showing the products being "fused".

Other font managers for Windows, such as Suitcase 9.2 haven't been updated recently. This is partly because a new version of Windows hasn't been released in several years. Also, Windows doesn't really provide a mechanism to make system-wide font auto-activation possible. On the Mac this is handled by a specific process called ATS server. I'm hoping that Microsoft makes something like ATS functionality possible in Vista.

It's also possible that plug-in based font auto-activation will emerge under Windows. Currently, Suitcase Fusion's plug-in based auto-activation is much more sophisticated in terms of figuring out what font was used in a particular document. It would be useful for Windows users to have access to that functionality as well. </div>

		<div class="commentbody">Is that the only reason there aren't new versions of suitcase for Windows? What about version updates, like 9.3? I recently used Font Expert 2005 and it seemed to have quite alot of features that Suitcase 9.2.1 doesn't. It probably would have been a superior product if they could have simplified it abit (user-interface is confusing, even though it is re-arrangeable). 

What keeps me coming back to Suitcase is just that, it's simple. I have a pretty organized file/folder system already in place and with Suitcase all I have to do is Drag and Drop. Font Expert 2005 doesn't make that process easy, plus if you're not careful you can easily delete font files.

I apologize if I sound like a nag Carl, you're a good guy. I think I just ran into more font issues than I was comfortable with and now I'm all out of sorts... I need to get back to the Mac!  </div>

		<div class="commentbody">I tried out FontExpert and totally agree with your assesment of the user interface. It's really "busy". However, I really like character table view and the properties pane. It's seems like it's aimed at people who know how fonts work and want be able to see the details. It would be cool if there was a way to open the font in FontLab from within FontExpert. 
IMHO, it's too bad that all of the details are exposed by default; some users might feel overwhelmed by details. 
Also, it seems like it's very file oriented, if that means anything. You pick font files and then install them.  Is there a way to create sets? There's a thing called a Worklist, but I'm not sure how to make more than one. </div>

		<div class="commentbody">Actually it works off the Windows File System. You work directly with the font file/folders... it doesn't however allow you to attach multiple font files just by selecting the root folder (you actually need to go thru every subfolder and select the fonts, very time consuming and tedious.) Another problem is if you fail to create a "duplicate/shortcut" of the font file and attach it to the worklist (a working list of fonts for the instance) you could easily delete that font when you deactivate it. It's abit more involved than the simplistic layout of Suitcase. I love that I can drag and drop a folder and all the subfolders are searched to include any fonts within, Font Expert 2005 doesn't do that. I love that you can activate and deactivate fonts on the fly, Font Expert 2005 doesn't do that, easily. But, like you said Font Expert does have some benefits, especially if you're a type designer. </div>
