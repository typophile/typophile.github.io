  of the same seminar on different days) by Edward Tufte here in the Washington, DC
  area. I find myself seriously tempted to attend. All of the registration methods
  requested including the reference code on the mailing label, which was PYR, which
  leads me to wonder: is FontLab peddling its user list to third parties, or is the
  PYR/Pyrus resonance merely coincidental?'

    in Chicago a few years ago, and didn't notice any pick-up in 'third-party' junkmail
    in the months after. (I don't recall the event having anything to do with Fontlab,
    however).\r\n\r\nGood seminar, and highly recommended (once), not least because
    copies of his four books come with it.\r\n\r\nI'm excited about why Tufte's in
    Washington these days, too. (Tapped by the president to bring some clarity and
    transparency and top-notch information design to town):\r\n\r\nhttp://www.edwardtufte.com/bboard/q-and-a-fetch-msg?msg_id=0003e0&topic_id=1#"

  body: "I'm guessing the PYR code is a coincidence. The company that makes FontLab
    tools has not operated under the name Pyrus for some time; they are now called
    FontLab Ltd.\r\n\r\nI enjoyed Tufte's presentation at the Boston ATypI in 1999,
    but information design isn't my field, and I recall that some friends who actually
    do information design referred to him as a \u2018snake oil salesman\u2019."

  body: "They were probably jealous of <em>TheVisual Display of Quantitative Information</em>,
    which he published himself because he was concerned that its quality would suffer
    if left to others. So yes, he is self-assured, and the book is beautiful, but
    that doesn't detract from the serious nature of the topic. Infographics don't
    get a lot of creative respect, so anything which raises its status should be lauded,
    not sneered at. \r\n\r\nI bought Tufte's poster reproduction of Minard's chart
    of <a href=\"http://www.edwardtufte.com/tufte/posters\">Napoleon's march on Moscow</a>.
    Printed with spot colour on a nice stock, it rightly respects the original.\r\n\r\nAs
    someone who's actually done a few charts, graphs and maps, I found Tufte's forthright
    debunking of misleading infographics, coupled with his high production values,
    to be quite salutary. And with an interest in the history of graphic design, I
    was fascinated to discover things like Playfair's work and the Dr Snow typhoid
    map in Tufte's book. IIRC, that stuff isn't in Meggs.\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: "I saw him at ATypI in Boston as well, and I went to one of his presentations
    in NYC a few years earlier. \r\n\r\nDuring the NYC talk he announced to the audience
    that the only typeface you need for charts, graphs and maps, was Bell Centennial,
    and that one shouldn't waste any money either licensing or commissioning any other
    fonts for that sort of work.\r\n\r\nDuring the break people were having their
    copies of his books signed, and he would joke with each one, and asked them what
    they did for a living and then personalize the inscription. When my time came
    he asked me what I did, and as he was looking down preparing the sign I told him
    I was a type designer. He quickly looked up and I said, \"Thanks a lot!\" sarcastically.
    He quickly looked down signed the book and said \"Next\".\r\n\r\nJamesM"

  body: When I attended books were included in the conference fee. The only two he
    had published at the time. He uses his books as visuals during the conference
    rather than projected images. Its one of his on going themes. I don't remember
    the exact fee, but I think it was in the $175 to $300 range.

  body: I went to his seminar in Arlington two or three years ago, and I believe it
    cost $380. It included three books ("Beautiful Information" wasn't out yet), the
    powerpoint booklet, and the Minard Poster. Lunch was not included. I doubt I'd
    pay on my own, but if your employer can pay for it, it's definitely worth it,
    especially if you don't already have the books.
