    know what it is.

  body: I flipped all the way through the serifed type families in the Jaspert &#34;Encyclopaedia
    of Type Faces&#34; and didn&#39;t spot this face. There were a number of Czech
    type designers, such as Menhardt, Ruzicka, Kapr and Preissig, but nothing showed
    a style as distinctive as this. <BR> <BR>This raises an issue that has bugged
    me for a long time. At least in the U.S., other than Jaspert&#39;s excellent book,
    there is very little that shows European typefaces that have not become digital
    fonts. We see a fair amount about English type, predictably, but almost nothing
    about Continental European metal typefaces. <BR> <BR>Does anyone know of any good
    references for that subject? Odds are they won&#39;t be in English, but type speaks
    for itself. This may be a question for Luc Devroye.

  body: ' <BR> <BR> I try to collect printer specimens of old Czech printers. It is
    a good source of information about type. Sure, there are many not digitalized
    typefaces. But these specimens are rarely to be find in the antique book stores.
    And if I find one, it is very expensive. But this typeface isn&#39;t listed in
    my specimens. <BR> <BR>You can try <a href="http://www.symposionbooks.com" target="_blank">http://www.symposionbooks.com</a>,
    they offer several type specimens of Czech printers. The store could send you
    the book abroad.'

  body: Filip, thanks for the link, but I cannot tell what most of the descriptions
    mean. I see two books that say &#39;Type Specimens&#39; but that&#39;s all I can
    understand when the description isn&#39;t English &#40;a few are&#41;. <BR> <BR>Maybe
    if you have time, we can write by e-mail, and you can explain a few of them to
    me. Today is not a good time for me though.  Thank you.

  body: Storm&#39;s Biblon has a similar feel. Loose curves, almost calligraphic in
    a way. As if the pen just kept <BR>going or the writer was a little too loose
    with his hold on the pen. Anyway, what I&#39;m getting at is that <BR>perhaps
    there is some sort of link. Maybe? <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/33375.gif"

  body: This face originated right here in the U.S. of A. -- it looks like Goudy&#39;s
    Pabst Oldstyle Italic.  <BR>You can get a very reasonably priced digital version
    from Vintage Type &#40;<a href="http://www.vintagetype.com" target="_blank">http://www.vintagetype.com</a>&#41;,  <BR>although
    I doubt it has all the central European characters. Also, the captial &#34;A&#34;
    is slightly different  <BR>&#40;the crest serif slants left in this sample but
    slants right in the VT version&#41;.
