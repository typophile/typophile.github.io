body: Does anyone know what typeface is used for body copy in Real  Simple Magazine.
  It looks like Trebuchet condensed but I can&#39;t find a postscript version of it.

  body: thanks everybody for your input and Mr. Spiekermann for the inside scoop.
    This was my first time on this forum and I certainly wasn&#39;t expecting Mr.
    Spiekermann to see this but I&#39;m trying to stop stealing sheep. Love meta...
    very cool font.....

    <BR>It&#39;s the MTV-thing, probably. Pictures are everything, text just gets
    in the way. So, if you use real skinny type, you&#39;re left with even less to
    read, which is GOOD &#40;if you&#39;re under the age of 35, haha&#41;.'
