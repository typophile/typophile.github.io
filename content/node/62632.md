body: "Hi Guys,\r\nJust like some of your wisdom please on things you have seen in
  relation to 'prohibited uses' and additional license agreements within Commercial
  EULAs.\r\n\r\nI have looked through as many EULAs as I can find and searched our
  Wiki here, but I'd love to know what people have seen in the way of category defining
  limitations on Commercial EULAs.\r\n\r\nI understand that there is basically 2 ways
  of approaching/viewing/creating a Commercial EULA, from the 'all you can eat' EULA
  where you can just go for it for the price of the Licensing Agreement (or Font),
  then there are the Commercial EULAs that have stipulations on the distinct areas
  you are allowed to use the Font via the EULA. Within the latter there can be areas
  commercially you cannot encroach without purchasing a secondary license or Agreement.
  And that is what I'd like to know.\r\n\r\n<strong>What areas or categories of Commercial
  License Agreements have you seen that have had listed categories that are interesting,
  making sense, ridiculous, or being unusual in the way of restrictions within it?</strong>\r\n\r\nI
  understand people have their various opinions on EULAs, but at this stage I'm just
  interested in what you've seen in your travels on the web or within the Font Industry,
  not what you think. I have already read enough opinion, just seen very few details.\r\n\r\nAny
  insights, observation, anecdotes, or wisdom, would be greatly appreciated.\r\n\r\nThanks
  in Advance guys.\r\n\r\nCheers\r\nDrJ"

  body: In the basic EULA, Marian Bantjes <a href="http://www.tiro.com/Restraint/index.html">Restraint</a>
    does not allow use with visual idenities, logos, outdoor signage, architectual
    details, advertising campaigns which include outdoor signage, television advertising
    or products were the typeface makes up the sole or major design element.

  body: "I buy fonts, but admittedly probably have never fully read through a EULA.
    I'm not sure many people do. We usually just click ACCEPT when we're installing
    software, for instance.\r\n\r\nSo, I usually hear about EULA clauses after-the-fact.
    \r\n\r\nPersonally, licenses that prohibit embedding in PDFs would make me think
    twice about purchasing the typeface...especially if it's a text face where I may
    very well have reasons to keep the text text.\r\n\r\nI have mixed feelings about
    the 'no logo' clause in things like House's licenses. If there work wasn't otherwise
    stellar, I'd probably hold it against them. ;)\r\n\r\n"

  body: The term "Commercial" has a very particular meaning when it comes to EULAs.
    Most EULA terms are for "Business/Personal Use". In almost every case "Commercial"
    uses require special licenses.

  body: "I also see 'Derivative' used a lot as a term placed in Commercial Licenses.\r\nI
    know what the word means, but the way some foundries use it throws me.\r\n\r\nSometimes
    the way the foundry has worded it sounds ambivalent, like..\r\n(A) Basically you
    can't create a thing with the font!!! Sounds like you cannot place it on anything.
    lol.\r\nOR\r\n(B) Do not take the font and turn it into some other identity. Presumably
    another font.\r\nI've read a couple of EULA's and wondered if the foundry knows
    what it means.\r\n\r\nWhat is your opinion & understanding of the phrase 'Derivative
    Works'? (Usually prohibited)\r\n\r\nCheers\r\n"

  body: Licenses that prohibit the embedding in PDF's are ridiculous. A PDF-workflow
    is pretty much standard nowadays, so prohibiting PDF embedding basically makes
    a typeface unusable.

  body: ">and then offered for sale as a different font.\r\n\r\nActually I would say
    \"and then redistributed as a different font.\" as there are some licenses that
    allow the creation of derivative fonts, but few if any allow that derivative to
    be sold.\r\n"
