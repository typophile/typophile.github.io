body: "Hi everybody,\r\n\r\nI am quite a newbie with InDesign.\r\nIndesign Paragraph
  Composer is great but I have one problem with it. In the final stage of corrections
  of a book, I would like to prevent Indesign from composing the paragraph when I
  am only doing minor changes. I would like to have control over the composition in
  the final editing, as any automatic breaks, hyphenations etc. have to be checked
  by the proof-reader again.\r\nEspecially in very long paragraphs even changing only
  one Letter from lower case to Capital can result in major recompositioning of the
  whole paragraph. This is beginning to anny me!\r\n\r\nHow do you handle this? Is
  there a way to switch to Single-Line Composer while keeping the composition created
  so far by the paragraph-Composer???\r\n\r\nAny help of experienced Indesign-Users
  welcome\r\n\r\nthanks,\r\nAxel"

  body: "Isolate the line you wish to edit by making it a separate paragraph.\r\nDo
    this by inserting a soft paragraph return, \"shift-return\", at the end of the
    line, and at the end of the previous line. You don't need to switch paragraph-composer
    mode for the line you're working on.\r\n\r\nA permutation of this technique would
    be to use regular paragraph returns, and change the justification style on the
    previous line, and the line you wish to edit, to \"justify all lines\". \r\n\r\nHowever,
    be aware that if the text is subsequently re-purposed, or significantly edited,
    the inserted paragraph returns will be potentially dangerous."

  body: I'll second Nick's suggestion as a valid way to have more (if not total) control
    over your paragraphs. Perfection often needs a dash of tedium.
