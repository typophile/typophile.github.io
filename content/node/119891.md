body: "hi to all\r\n\r\nI would like first to be excuse about my bad english. But,
  I know that genthemen you are will do this...\r\n\r\nI wanted to write here about
  ADF fonts, in order to answer to so many mails I received and to close, clarify
  some bad songs I can read from some who think better me what ADF fonts are. I hope
  that your contacts shoud make the rest...\r\n\r\nFor the presentation, I'm 48 year's
  old, maried with three children, my suns. I come from the print and desktop publishing,
  this explains, maybe, all my stuff. \r\nI started to work on fonts with fontographer
  to correct fonts for print job... Don't think that all commercial fonts are perfect,
  at least at this time. Maybe things are different now... That said, I still use
  Manutius2 to run the first drawings (yes I know, but it is difficult to change its
  ways), then FF to complete them with AFDKO and other tools... Initially, the free
  publication was far from what it is today. This is an area where I wanted to hire
  me as an artist, a painter of glyphs, keeping in mind that the goal was not to copy,
  but to learn from the essence of a character to develop my own vision and because
  I love make fonts.\r\nBaskervald is certainly very close to Baskerville, that's
  true but many things make it different. Baskerville is Baskerville, Baskervald il
  Baskervald. Universalis is not a clone of Futura as I could read it. Universalis
  resembles to Futura just because it is inspired from it. But when you look closely
  it is far to be a clone. Gillius No. 2 and Gillius just pull their traits from the
  spirit of GillSans, only the spirit and ultimately an style exercice. I thank those
  who view it as a modernized version of Gillsans. I did not have this claim. Berenis
  is a simple drawing, a didonne, any of elegance dedicated to the one I love. This
  is not a bodoni, just something in the same spirit. Bodoni is bodoni, Berenis is
  Berenis. Why to compare ? As design they are just alternatives but, are themselves
  own characters.\r\nWhen I forged mintspirit, it was for my personal use. I just
  shared with those who would like why not. But in no case be the font for mint distribution
  , as can be read, and in any case far from my words, and be peeled on her curves.
  In this sense, when a painter makes a painting, no one brings his knowledge to tell
  him to move the tree to the left, the green leaves would be better more clearer,
  and instead of the lake should be put a house. His painting is done with his sensitivity.
  No picture is ugly, you like it or not, same thing for fonts. If I chose to forge
  the \"e\" of Mekanus font like this is because I wanted so.\r\n\r\nTo conclude,
  a font is a design choice, guidance drawing made \u200B\u200Bwith the sensibility
  of the artist I am as a brush on a painting, which gives life to the lines to get
  letters... Nothing more.\r\n\r\nBefore leaving the pen. The ADF site is not abandoned,
  I will do updates later. I'm working for some time on other collections, commercial
  for this time. I take this opportunity to thank T\xE9 Rowan who has done so much
  publicity for ADF fonts and is very inspired by the work done.\r\n\r\nthank you
  for reading\r\nH.H\r\n"
