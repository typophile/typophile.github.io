body: "Hi\r\nI have a trouble with the kerning pair exceptions. When I compile the
  font some kerning pairs exceptions (B\xEF, C\xEF, F\xEF) are ok, but others like
  D\xEF, E\xEF, G\xEF, K\xEF etc ...  not recognize the exceptions. However in Fontlab
  seems ok and the classes for those glyps are similar.\r\n\r\nAnyone know what could
  be the problem\r\nthanks"
