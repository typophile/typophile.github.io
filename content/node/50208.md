  body: "Thanks Henrick, Rotis is the kind of thing I'm after, but I think I've overused
    it already so I've kind of gone off it. Kabel I think may be too much and compete
    with Brighton a bit too much.\r\n\r\nThe wordmark is attached.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Picture1_3608.jpg]"
