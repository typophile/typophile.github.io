body: "Hi,\r\ni'm a journalist and i'm going to work in a french panafrican satyrical
  magazine. As i'm going to be involved in the editing, i'm wanting to give suggestions
  about typography. As it is now, it's poor, and hasn't any relation to Africa \u2014
  times for text, and standart uninteresting fonts for titling. \r\nSo i'm interested
  about any fonts related to Africa all of you know. By this, i mean two things:\r\n\u2014
  fonts by african designers, or people with african roots, even without an \"African
  look\"\r\n\u2014 fonts inspired by Africa, with somewhat of an Africa feeling. Here's
  the African look.\r\n\r\nI have looked on google and not find much interesting things,
  and on here, which drove me to Building lettres but as for now, the site is empty.\r\n\r\nThanks
  for any help."

    have a pointer to somewhere you can still get the magazine. "

    on my topic, but it seems to be essencially about african alphabets, in non-latin
    writting, while i'm searching latin fonts. \r\nI d'like to get the first issue
    of BLetters, but i wait for someone to tell me how. \r\n\r\nSomething else : i
    need text fonts, not only display one. That's important.\r\n\r\ni think that using
    egyptian fonts might be an interesting thing; using something african by its classificvation.
    Algerians interest me less, as i think they don't fit well a newspaper."

    the historic scripts, but I may well be blurring Building Letters 1 and Afrikan
    Alphabets in my own mind. \r\n\r\nWould your readers associate \"Egyptian\" and
    \"Algerian\" style types with Africa? Even if these styles had African origins
    they've been assimilated into everyday global use. \r\n"

  body: 'I don''t think the readers would realise the links, but my idea is to gather
    elements of typographic design that rely on an african identity, even if it''s
    not obvious. It''s more about searching something true, and coherent, than to
    make it totally obvious. I''ll be fine with using a serif type which doesn''t
    look african at all but which was made by a designer from Africa. '

    it, and used to be a frequent Typophiler. \r\n\r\nI designed the Worldwide typeface
    in 1999, for the Worldwoman project, which has mainly used it for AfricaWoman.
    http://www.africawoman.net\r\nThe face is also used by several South African papers,
    such as the Sowetan, and Sunday Times (both Jo'burg) and Weekend Post (Port Elizabeth).\r\n\r\nSo
    although it's a Century adaptation by someone who's never been to Africa, it has
    a bit of provenance. "

  body: Will you need to be able handle text in African languages, or only in English
    or other European languages? If so, this may dictate what fonts will be useful,
    since many African languages use letters and diacritics that are not part of European
    character sets.

  body: "> Egyptian\r\n\r\nThat style really says nothing about Egypt. And anyway\r\nEgypt
    is arguably the least African country in Africa!  :-/\r\n\r\nI might instead look
    to the fauve, \"naturalist\" style of\r\ntype coming out of South America the
    past few years,\r\nand Eastern Europe the past few decades.\r\n\r\n--\r\n\r\nBut
    really, it will be quite hard to find a typeface that evokes Africa in both a
    subtle enough way to really work for text, and a strong enough way to actually
    matter. I have a feeling you need a custom font - second time tonight I'm recommending
    that!  :-/\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "You're right Hrant, but i don't know, the oldness, mecanical and rough feeling
    of Egyptiennes fits Africa in my view, better, anyway, than any other serif. The
    name is more a pretext than anything else. I'm looking Storm's Farao... And Peter
    Bruhn one.\r\nThe paper survive with difficulties, it hasn't any ads so there
    is no room for a custom type. Alas. That would be indeed the good idea. \r\nNick,
    that could have been nice, but if so many papers use it...\r\nJohn, the language
    is french only. \r\nAbout M. Vosloo, i saw some nice display types, but taht doesn't
    resolve my n\xB0 1 problem: text. And a display sans usable for short text. \r\nIt
    is not easy...\r\n"

  body: "> the language is french only.\r\n\r\nThat gives me an idea. Maybe use a
    font that conveys what Africa <cite>used</cite> to be about: colonialism. Not
    anything to celebrate, certainly, but a central part of its reality nonetheless.
    So I might suggest a face typical of mid-to-late-19th-century France, like a Latine
    or an Elzevir: those styles can have a nice, bittersweet air of nostalgia for
    a time when imperialism was motivated by sort of a romantic chauvinism (\"we need
    to force them become like us, for their own good\") more than by the mere crass,
    brutal materialism of today.\r\n\r\nSee this:\r\nhttp://typophile.com/node/7596\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
