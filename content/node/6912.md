body: help! <BR>we&#39;ve got a logo in Lucida which we&#39;ve been asked to produce
  large &#40;signage&#41;.  it looks terrible at a large size. Does anyone know of
  a font similar to Lucida which is actually smooth / looks good at a large size?
  <BR>Is Lucida just a crappy typeface or could it be the version we have? <BR>any
  suggestions gratefully accepted <BR>cheers

    <BR>This all depends on your personal taste of course <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"
    ALT=":-&#41;" BORDER=0>, but  <BR>all typefaces in the <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/search?search%5Btext%5D=Lucida"
    target="_blank"> Lucida family</a> are - technically speaking - <BR>proper quality
    fonts. If you have the original font files they  <BR>should look good at any size,
    as they&#39;re fully scalable  <BR>outline fonts.
