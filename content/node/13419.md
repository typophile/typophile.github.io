  trailer for for <em>Cronicas</em></a>, there are some subtitles that do some interesting
  things. They emerge from behind the speakers' heads (when the speakers are not facing
  the camera), as if emitting from their mouths. I've always been a bit skeptcial
  about subtitle gimmicks, but this one seems useful/purposeful.\r\n\r\nI've only
  seen a few instances of films using stylized/kinetic subtitles for speech, and usually
  I enjoy the effort. Anyone else have examples they liked/didn't like?"
