body: "Not sure where the best place to ask is, but I need some help.\r\n\r\nI'm a
  great lover of Baskerville (Storm's is the best, though I like Baskerville Classico
  as well...even though the italic version is a bit wonky in places), and I also just
  recently fell in love with <a href=\"http://www.dutchtypelibrary.nl/PDF/M504/DTLElzevir_M504.pdf\"
  target=\"_blank\">Dutch Type Library's Elzevir font.</a>\r\n\r\nI am particularly
  looking for a transitional font that has an italic with softer contours on letters
  like \"w\" and \"v\".\r\n\r\nI've tried ADF's Baskervald, but when printed @ 10pt,
  there's a lot left to be desired and I there are some kerning issues with the font
  as well, not to mention it doesn't work with Office 2010 very well (but that's Office's
  fault really).\r\n\r\nI've also tried Linux Libertine, which I like, but the italic
  version has very sharp angles for the \"w\" and \"v\".\r\n\r\nThe rub is that the
  font must be free. It's not that I can't afford a really nice font like Storm's
  Baskerville (which I own), it's that it needs to be distributed for free. I am working
  on a project where multiple authors will contribute complimentary and secondary
  works. As such, I want a consistent display format (e.g. font) for all supplentary
  works, but I can't purchase copies of a font for each author.\r\n\r\nAny suggestions
  would be greatly appreciated. The font will be used to create PDF and printed works.
  Thanks in advance!"

    :)\r\n\r\nThe italic <em>v</em> and <em>w</em> is angular in the main italic,
    but I can make a version for you that's not. Lemme know if you're interested.
    :) The Cursive variant, though, is rounded. So unless you would prefer the overall
    feel of it's main italic, Neuton Cursive may be better.\r\n\r\nHere's Neuton Regular,
    Italic, and Cursive:\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://21326.info/work/neuton/itals/regular.png\"

    is generally felt to be better... so if you can't use Baskervald, you might check
    that out.

    the range of quality free serifs in multiple weights is limited. Give Heuristica
    a shot: http://code.google.com/p/evristika/downloads/list . Personally I would
    categorize it as rationalized/economized old-style. \r\nOr you just get over the
    v/w of Libertine italic. \r\nOr you invest the small amount for http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/aah-yes/pevensey/

    trust your own eyes, or other people\u2019s advice."

    calls it a Scotch Roman, which would be a modern.\r\n\r\nAh, I'm confused. I was
    thinking of the IM Fell types (at igniomarini.com), which are distressed, and
    hence not suitable for normal text use."

  body: Many years ago, Adobe contributed a Type 1 version of Utopia to the X consortium.
    "In 2006, Adobe relicensed them to the TeX Users Group, under similar terms as
    the previous contribution, but now explicitly clarifying that the modifications
    to the fonts, and redistribution of the modified versions, was allowed." The PFB
    and AFM files are available [[http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/fonts/utopia|here]].
    To use these fonts under Windows, you would need to generate a PFM from the AFM
    using a program such as Proxima Software's free AfmToPfm 1.0, available [[http://www.proximasoftware.com/afmtopfm/|here]].
    A Mac-ready version of this free Utopia can be found in [[http://www.connectnw.com/redlers/fonts/cmfontsextra.dmg.zip|this
    file]].

      the typeface by the "font community" are crap. Slanted romans? There's some
      font smell in that.

    on the CTAN site were particularly helpful, and from them I was able to generate
    TTF files. I was also able to use that same site to generate OTF versions of Baskervald,
    which is better on my machine (for some reason) than directly downloading it from
    Arkandis. \r\n\r\nI juggled between Palatino, Baskervald, and Utopia...in the
    end, I believe I'll use Baskervald. Thanks everyone."
