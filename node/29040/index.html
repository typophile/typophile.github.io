<p>Sheesh, my six year old kid puts more serious thought into the fonts to use for the little sign we&rsquo;re making reminding him of the reward he&rsquo;ll get for brushing his teeth. Of course, his main criterion right now is to use fonts that I&rsquo;ve designed. The kids really love the idea that they have a proprietary font for just their use, until I get around to finishing it, which at the rate I&rsquo;m going will be a while.

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Ivan, maybe we should restart this thread. What were the instructions given to you by your teacher? Did you ask for more instruction after the teacher gave you the assignment?</p>
<p>Maybe I&rsquo;m giving too much credit to the student and too little to the teacher, but it seems to me if a student feels a need to come to Typophile to ask a question like this there isn&rsquo;t enough communication (and instruction) from the teacher.</p>
<p>This is a classic typography 101 assignment. I had it when I was a student. I did the word ECLIPSE and the typeface Trajan (gasp!). I took the C and reshaped it into a sliver of a moon. I still look at it as a breakthrough in my education as before that the teacher had made me cry and embarassed me in front of the entire class with my previous attempts. Instead of quitting something inside of me accepted the challenge and I went back to my sketchbook (ok I probably used the computer) and started playing with words, typefaces and shapes.</p>
<p>The assignment is to visually interpret a word. A typeface can help with the interpretation, but the letters also have to do some of the work. So, you should define each word as you know it and then turn that into something visual. Start sketching and see what happens. I&rsquo;ll bet you&rsquo;d be surprised.</p>

<p>No, not funny at all. That&rsquo;s typophile - someone asks a rather dull, uninteresting or silly question and the community either ignores it or goes off on an interesting tangent. I assume most forums (not just on-line) are like that if there&rsquo;s not a written agenda or moderator to keep people on-topic.</p>

<p>the first thing you should do is pick four of the words. if you can&rsquo;t decide, pick four out of a hat. however, be aware that should you decide to continue in design, your academic and professional life will contain millions of artistic, aesthetic, programmatic, and strategic decisions.</p>
<p>second, write the four words out. then define them so that you have a clear idea of the concept each word represents.</p>
<p>third, define &ldquo;expressive.&rdquo; either from the dictionary, or for yourself, or better yet, in both ways.</p>
<p>fourth, and this is the kicker, you absolutely must generate your own creative ideas. draw the words. draw them with different pens and pencils. paint them. type them on a computer. print them out small, print them out so each letter fits on an 11x17 (or A3) page. buy some blocks with letter on them and rearrange them. take pictures of type all around you for a whole day, print them, cut out the letters and make collages. these are just a few suggestions - the point is that you should open yourself up creatively. don&rsquo;t be afraid.</p>
<p>fifth, draw pictures of the words. by that i mean, images that express the ideas. find stock photography (gettyimages.com or istockphoto.com) that express the ideas. take your own pictures.</p>
<p>steps 4 and 5 will have to come together.</p>
<p>DO, then think. then DO again. repeat as often as you can stand it, because it will probably help you improve.</p>
<p>while you are THINKING, always keep in mind the concept of the word. look at the creative things you have done. try to imagine how steps 4 and 5 come together.</p>
<p>finally, i&rsquo;ve suggested some steps. this is only to get your started - you can find your own process as well.</p>
<p>oh, and post some of the stuff here that you&rsquo;ve done and you will get at least some constructive feedback.</p>
<p>good luck. have fun.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>&ldquo;if a student feels a need to come to Typophile to ask a question like this there isn’t enough communication (and instruction) from the teacher.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Why not? In the UK we were encouraged to make the most of all resources, so even if we were assigned a tutor for a specific project we were encouraged to go see other tutors, read, talk to the professionals, look for inspiration and advice everywhere so I don’t see why not Typophile, after all he asked for ANY kind of help, not for solutions. Maybe he just wanted to see how YOU would approach this task (in general). 
I find it silly to insinuate that because he’s paying for college, college should provide all the anwers. Is that the relationship we want students to have with their universities? One of a client that pays for a service?</p>
<p>&ldquo;why can’t we turn into something educational?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Again: I don’t think he was asking for you guys to do the job on his behalf. Ivan is just interacting with professionals, trying to find out, outside the classroom, what are the different ways to approach this exercise. So if someone asks you for advice you want to be paid, but if it’s “educational support” you are willing to do it free of charge? Typophile is an educational tool as well so why all this arrogance? Generosity is what makes Typophile such a great place. I asked for help many times, it was never intended as “can you do it for me?”. It was always more of an attempt to interact with people and see how their mind work. Plus Ivan&rsquo;s clearly a student, so what’s the fuss about a student asking for help. What’s so outrageous about it? Begging for a fish? Learn how to fish? Stop being lazy? Sorry but THAT was patronizing. Listen to yourselves&hellip; People seem to be too busy to give you a hand but are never too busy to give a little moral lesson, free of charge&hellip;..so what he has no ideas, it doesn&rsquo;t mean he&rsquo;s stupid. It happens to all students to panic a bit in front of a new task, big deal! Do your homework! What do you think he&rsquo;s doing?? This is actually part of his homework!
Ivan&rsquo;s not being lazy, he’s doing what he’s supposed to do: he’s looking for advice outside college. Good for you, mate. Ivan, you have all my support. In fact, I’ll have a look into it and let you know as soon as I can if I come up with something original, free of charge of course.</p>
<p>Welcome to Typophile, who recommended you to come here, by the way? Your tutor? Good for him.</p>

Moving for example could relate to motion but it could also refer to the act of producing emotions so you have more than one option and you can pick the one that inspires you most or the one that you think may surprise your tutor (maybe your fellow students will all use the word in relation to motion, so if you use the word as in “producing emotion” it’ll be less obvious and slightly more original). I know it’s just an  idea but I hope it’ll give you something to think about before you proceed with the actual graphic representation.</p>
<p>As Tim said in realtion to the word whisper: stay away from the obvious, try to evoke an atmosphere rather than seek for a literal representation ( I think that was what Tim meant). 
I had a quick look in my dictionary but I’m sure you can do a better job. Good luck. Oh and please make your cheque payable to&hellip;: )</p>
<p>Moving:</p>
<ol>
<li>in motion</li>
<li>producing strong emotion as in “a moving book”</li>

<p>Whisper:</p>

<li>speak very softly using one’s breath without one’s vocal cords, especially for the sake of privacy</li>

		<div class="commentbody">First of all, kudos to the kid for looking for professional resources. But, in the same breath, I do believe he can give it a whirl on his own first. I think it&rsquo;s imperative for design students to explore their own thoughts and ideas - that is the point of a college education. Ideation  developement is essential in the creative process. My advice as a design professional and educator is to research and seek ideas, yes, but think independently as well. If you learn that now, you&rsquo;ll be more successful in your senior-level classes and beyond.</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Lorenza,
Either you missunderstood my post or we have completely different concepts of what &ldquo;help&rdquo; is. In my years of teaching and parenting, I have always struggled to find the best way to &ldquo;teach&rdquo; that individual at that moment in a way that befits that instance. I believe that what Ivan needed just then was a bit of a wake-up call that he must do &ldquo;something&rdquo; first even if it is wrong before he gives up saying he has no idea. I also gave him a way to get started.  I firmly believe that the struggle in learning is imperitive and the best teacher of selfreliance.  The young man is a college student now, not a child. He needs to push himself to action. He could then bring the results of his actions here for help.  You learn far more from trying and being wrong than you do by doing nothing and hoping for divine intervention.
As far as I am concerned, the most helpful post on this thread was by Satya, a young student himself. Satya said, &ldquo;First at least try do something yourself. On the basic of that people here can give you the feedback..wheather they are working or not.&rdquo;
He later said, &ldquo;I am still waiting&rdquo; after getting no reply and offered to show his own work&ndash;still no reply. Satya may be young and inexperienced but was exactly right in his assesment.</p>
<p>I stand by every word I said above without apology. I truly want Ivan to learn to fish.  To do that, he must first go out and stick his line in the water.  That works far better than waiting for a cooked fish to jump into your plate at home.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I still think that, considering he&rsquo;s new on typophile, you guys could have been a little bit more supportive and less condescendent. And yes, I re read the thread and I feel exactly the same. We don&rsquo;t know if he&rsquo;s a &ldquo;young man&rdquo;. I took a degree in graphic design when I was well over 30. I had another degree before that and I had travelled all over the world. Still, in front of my first brief I felt very insecure and I remember it was very important for me to look at other people&rsquo;s work.  Nothing wrong with that. I think it&rsquo;s clear that Ivan was having difficulties getting started, maybe he&rsquo;s a hell of a designer but it&rsquo;s still insecure about his ideas and concepts. Maybe he came across Typophile and thought that this is what was all about: exchange of ideas and who knows maybe he would have helped YOU next time but he&rsquo;ll probably think twice about coming back now. If that was the first reception, can you immagine how comfortable he feels about showing you guys his sketches? Can you blame him? And why all this sending him back to his tutor then? Why do you assume he doesn&rsquo;t communicate with his tutors? Maybe he feels he needs the input from outside, that his tutor is not God and may not always be right. Plus at Typophile you have people from different backgrounds and culture, what beats that?  Carl, I agree I don&rsquo;t have enough information to determine that he had nothing but good intentions but we don&rsquo;t have enough information to decide he&rsquo;s a slacker either.</p>
<p>Serious guys: if you don&rsquo;t feel like giving a hand: fine. If you feel like you should be paid for that: fine, contact him by email or something and make an arrangement. It would not be the first time this happens at Typophile! 
But please think about before you call him lazy or before you suggest he should consider studying something else instead.</p>

sorry but am not at all agree with what you&rsquo;re saying. Dunno why, but you&rsquo;ve just turned everything other way. Am a student too, and I never had any problem with any of the members here.

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Satya: what I don&rsquo;t understand is this urge to be so judgemental and patronising. People do ask for help. If you think they don&rsquo;t deserve it, move on to the next thread. 
What you said about people being busy doesn&rsquo;t make much sense because it&rsquo;s their choice to read the thread and reply. Nobody&rsquo;s forcing anyone to be here! 
If it&rsquo;s a question of payment, then let those who think they should be paid, work out a contract or a price table. 
I don&rsquo;t see the need to determine if the student is kosher or not, or if his/her request is legit or not. Simply, I didn&rsquo;t &ldquo;detect any undertone&rdquo; (not even using my penetrating Freudian psychological analysis skills) and I happened to have the time to give a little encouragement. I didn&rsquo;t see any diabolical-immoral-unethical-shameless-conspiracy-against-the-poor-typophile-member in Ivan&rsquo;s few lines. So maybe it&rsquo;s not me who&rsquo;s turning things the other way (whatever that means). 
It doesn&rsquo;t make any difference to me if Ivan presents or not a sketch, to be honest, but that&rsquo;s me.  I don&rsquo;t feel the need to put rules in everything. I simply don&rsquo;t feel offended and don&rsquo;t feel the need to &ldquo;scold&rdquo; the &ldquo;vile slacker&rdquo;. 
Why put the guy on trial, you help if you feel like. If you don&rsquo;t, just ignore the message and let those who don&rsquo;t feel offended do what they think. He asked for ideas, which could also be suggesting a book (like someone did) or just share a similar experience. I don&rsquo;t think it should be a rule that the guy/girl should first show a sketch.  You may ask for it but you don&rsquo;t have the right to &ldquo;expect&rdquo; this and feel betrayed and cheated because the person doesn&rsquo;t comply with your request. He never promised anything.
He said in his 2nd post that he was grateful to those who had decided to help him, what else do you need: the naughty naughty boy on his knees?</p>
<p>Satya, I think some typophile members are simply awesome, and I have a great experience of typophile myself, which is why I&rsquo;m surprised to suddenly see all this resentment and all this detecting-insincere-undertones between the lines. Oh well&hellip;</p>

<p>I also agree with whoever said that if somebody has no ideas they don&rsquo;t belong in graphic design. I mean even if your first stab is trite how can you not see anything at all for &lsquo;grow&rsquo;, &lsquo;dark&rsquo;, &lsquo;drop&rsquo; or &lsquo;scramble&rsquo;? Being a designer is about being to visualize and conceptualize and I think we would NOT be doing Ivan any favor by handing him easy answers.</p>

<p>Education (assuming Ivan was actually looking for education&hellip;) is something you offer, not something you impose.
Exactly: don&rsquo;t help, isn&rsquo;t it what I was saying all this time? If you don&rsquo;t want to help Satya, don&rsquo;t help!
So Ivan doesn&rsquo;t belong here or even in the industry. What are you going to do about that? Make a petition and send a letter to West Lafayette&rsquo;s college of graphic design and have him removed? I don&rsquo;t get it, Patricia, you are being incredibly harsh.  I thought your issue was money, now it&rsquo;s about education principles? Who talked about easy answers, did you read my post? I said it&rsquo;s possible he was only looking for general advice.</p>
<p>Months ago some guy from a typographic magazine asked us to help him find a name for his e-newsletter or something (Satya you were not around yet). Anyone here remembers? He promised a prize ( I can&rsquo;t remember what it was&hellip;). A huge amount of people contributed, some names were actually really good. What happened to the guy and the reward? Anyone knows? Anyone said anything?
That was actually something to make a fuss about because:
a) he was in the creative industry, why couldn&rsquo;t he find a name for his magazine ?
b) he had the means to financially reward contributors
c) he actually promised he was going to reward the winner
d) he disappeared without saying a word. Nope, not even a thank you.</p>
<p>Has anyone demonstrated outrage? I think not. That, in my opinion, was not a very honest attittute and it went completely unnoticed. 
Now all this fuss because a first year student is not creative enough and needs a push, like this is something new&hellip;</p>

<p>Yes (although at least one student will do that).</p>
<p>Many people get into graphics to specialise in different disciplines other than type, students often don&rsquo;t appreciate the inter-connection of disciplines, but I don&rsquo;t want to defend Ivan, if he feels the need he can do that. I expect now most of us would love a project with a brief as free as this, but in the dim and distant (in my case) it was daunting and I was <em>aware</em> of type (or rather lettering), a situation that Tiffany acknowledged, although the purpose, I believe, of the exercise is multi-fold, one of which is the use of resources, the darkroom &amp; studio, type department, library, print and model-making departments (the astute will guess it was before easy access to digital). For that reason I don&rsquo;t condemn Ivan, although I wish he had shown some inclinations, on the other hand many students have asked questions here and demanded to be treated as children and received some barbed advice, that will, hopefully, reveal to them the difference between school and college education.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;ll be ten quid, I&rsquo;ll send an invoice.</p>

<p>I just think it&rsquo;s lazy to come here and expect us to do your work for you, whether you&rsquo;re a student or a paid professional (especially egregious). Having the ideas is the fun part, it&rsquo;s having the client reject them that sucks. Ivan has to learn this and if he can&rsquo;t or won&rsquo;t at least make an attempt on his own then he should consider whether this is the right field for him. I&rsquo;ve had a lot of design students work for me and if any of them ever came to me without an idea in their head and asked &ldquo;what font should I use?&rdquo; I&rsquo;d have fired them.</p>
<p>In any event, he&rsquo;s been awfully quiet of late, either he found help somewhere else or we scared him off, which would be a shame. I should add that I have learned a tremendous amount about type from frequenting this site and I already have almost 20 yrs experience.</p>

		<div class="commentbody">I know that Patricia. I saw your website ages ago and I realise you are an established designer with a solid career, no doubts about that. Again, I don&rsquo;t think he was expecting anything. He asked for help and said &lsquo;thank you&rsquo; to those willing to do so. Again, he did not ask for free education or parenting (!) or baby-sitting. For what we know about him, maybe he was just looking for suggestions (I think I am repeating myself) and maybe he didn&rsquo;t expect expensive, experienced, established designers to do the job for him free of charge. There&rsquo;s no indication to that. Jesse recommended him a book. That was a cool thing to do and a humble one too. And it didn&rsquo;t cost him anything.
Your first reply was about financial reward, then you added educational principles and now you seem to be sorry he has been scared off, when just few posts ago you seemed to be rather convinced he was knocking at the wrong door. You should be happy he&rsquo;s not around anymore. That would be consistent for someone who sacks inexperienced students with such aplomb.
To be honest, this is not about Ivan himself so it doesn&rsquo;t matter if he&rsquo;s around or not. I don&rsquo;t know him and I don&rsquo;t want to speak on his behalf but all these moral lessons and cliches about education methods are ridiculous.</div>

<p>My very first boss, to whom I owe a lot, used to say &ldquo;don&rsquo;t come to me with questions, come to me with answers&rdquo; which maybe the best professional advice I ever got. As Chris said, teach them how to fish. I learned more more from professors and bosses who were tough on me than from those who held my hand. I guess I carried that over when I became the boss - I never had much patience with helpless interns or assistants.</p>
<p>If Ivan learned from this thread that he should take baby steps towards solving his own design problems rather than immediately turning to the &lsquo;experts&rsquo; for advice then we did him a service. I hope he comes back with some samples for us to review.</p>
<p>You have to have a thick skin in this business, as in most.</p>

Ivan has done exactly nothing to kick off this assignment, be clear: absolutely nothing. He didn&rsquo;t even pick 4 words from the 14 evocative words provided. He didn&rsquo;t even try. Then there&rsquo;s a vaguely-communicated expectation that we will offer help. Others have pointed out how simple, how easy this assignment is. I have to agree. Ivan made it clear that he was not willing to take time to think for a few moments before asking the world to help him. Do you really think there&rsquo;s no evidence of laziness here?</p>
<p>Thought is the issue. If a student starts off unwilling to think, and in addition unwilling to communicate his request in a clear way, and furthermore expects others to do everything for him, and hasn&rsquo;t bothered to ask his professor for clarification, then it doesn&rsquo;t encourage anyone to be helpful, and it doesn&rsquo;t sound like there&rsquo;s much interest in design. It&rsquo;s not his age that&rsquo;s offensive, it&rsquo;s his breezy unconcern with detail, communication, problem solving and even basic manners. The only thing Ivan didn&rsquo;t do to turn me off is say &ldquo;thanks&rdquo; at the end of his message, completing the picture of entitled expectation. I&rsquo;ve seen that before here and it&rsquo;s repellent.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve noticed that Typophiles have demonstrated time and again their generosity with ideas, information, type IDs and more, so there must be some merit to the responses Ivan got. Ivan did say anything will help; he must be prepared for some of this kind of feedback. The thing underlying this is that Typophile gets a lot of these requests, and they range from very considerate, curious and engaged, to completely entitled and slovenly. A little thought, a little effort, a little punctuation go a long way.</p>
<p>As Chris pointed out, Ivan isn&rsquo;t a baby needing protection, he needs to discover what the ingredients of design are. Almost all the responses he got were meant to provoke thought. If he is unwilling to think at all, then there isn&rsquo;t a lot anyone else can do to help him. Spoon-feeding him answers isn&rsquo;t help, it&rsquo;s pampering.</p>

<p>I didn&rsquo;t bring that up. I thought it was you! Or someone else but not me. lol!
Anyway, I don&rsquo;t see the point of this: I&rsquo;m concerned about cheap hostility and cliches and you reply with more and more cliches. Oh, the master who treats students like shit and has no patience with interns but hey! It&rsquo;s for their own good! Sounds like a mexican novel (or a Chip Kidd book).
I hope at least you pay your employees a good salary because from here it sounds like the kingdom of fear. Or like a sweatshop.
And I don&rsquo;t see the point of comments like the first one Ivan received (thanks James), that&rsquo;s bullying. It&rsquo;s rude and pompous and I don&rsquo;t believe anyone can benefit from that.
Suddenly everyone seems to know what Ivan needs but please proceed to check out first. In US. 
I love the use of the word repellent. Very ironic.</p>

Not sure what that is like, but it sounds depressing. Why harass him, and if there was nothing for some here to post to help, why not just pass? Wait and see if he comes back with an attempt, since that was the suggestion of all the non-hatin' responses. Chiding won&rsquo;t prevent the next guy form coming along with the same Q.</p>
<p><em>I’ve had a lot of design students work for me and if any of them ever came to me and said “what font should I use?” I’d have fired them.</em></p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve had a lot of bosses that crap on any ideas they are offered, ad they play a passive agressive game of wanting you to reach theri conclusion. Eventually, you realize this is an inefficient game, and you just ask them what they want. Of course, the people like that are the ones most likey to gloat about firing people too. (Rather than see it as an unfortuate and expensive event for all parties, like any discipline.)</p>

Anyone seriously interested in creativity and design would really enjoy this project and the chance to experiment and explore with type.</p>
<p>Through asking though there has been some useful advice posted on ways to approach the project for Ivan.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re still in need of inspiration I&rsquo;d suggest getting the book &ldquo;A Smile In The Mind&rdquo; (Beryl McAlhone and David Stuart) Its full of clever and witty thinking :)</p>

Now serious, Darrel: I think Choz basically said what I said (just he put it with more class!). 
If I&rsquo;m not mistaken Tim is also not condemning and some people did offer some support, which means that they are not condemning Ivan either and that they don&rsquo;t mind offering some sort of professional advice, even if limited.
I don&rsquo;t see why you should speak on behalf of everyone here but there you go&hellip;

<p>You are responding in such a hostile and defensive way, I have to assume you are taking the comments here personally. Not a good idea for a designer. Design is generally very collaborative. Every idea isn&rsquo;t pure gold. And if there are no ideas, well&hellip;.</p>
<p>Consider that others' perspectives might be as valid as yours. Each of us has had experiences that led us to our present positions. You have no idea how deep that experience is in any given case. For instance, do you remember having to indicate clean type in the 1960&rsquo;s for a client presentation with a carpenters' pencil? Some of us do. Some of us have learned our trade under much more demanding supervisors than Patty, and we&rsquo;ve benefited greatly from firm direction and high expectations. Don&rsquo;t equate criticism with cruelty. You don&rsquo;t learn anything when you don&rsquo;t get honest feedback. You don&rsquo;t learn when you ignore honest feedback either. ;)</p>
