  fonts were 'based' on designs by other people? I know ITC Souvenir was originally
  Benton's, I'm wondering how many others were? Were a lot of Benguiat's fonts based
  on Benton's designs? Any help muchly appreciated. "

    became part of ITC's Type Library.\r\nAnyway, much of what Ed did earlier was
    really part of [[PLINC]]'s collection, and much of that were variants of older
    showcard and display designs."
