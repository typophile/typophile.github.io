  recent travels in Costa Rica. This has pretty much everything I covet in a piece
  of art. Texture, mystery, distress, elegance. And instructions for what you can
  and cannot do. Look at the exquisitely wrong letter spacing between the u and the
  m, the caprice of the flourished N, the vapor of smoke. Not to mention the shimmering
  ghost of the silver cigarette and the restrained iconography for \"no.\"\r\nMore
