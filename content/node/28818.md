  company and just did some quick sketches  (well not so quick for me...)\r\n\r\nHere
  is the question: should I use existing fonts and then apply the ornaments or try
  to draw cleaner versions and then trace in illustrator....\r\n\r\nI think for sure
  i'll have to trace the ornaments in illustrator, but what about the fonts? should
  I use existing ones? any recommendations? \r\n\r\nAny other suggestions or feedback
  are appreciated...\r\n\r\n* I am not lazy, it's just my caligraphic skills are very
  poor.... **\r\n\r\nThanks so much!!\r\n-p\r\n\r\n"

  body: You seem to be influenced by Marian Bantjes (http://www.bantjes.com/). I believe
    she does all of her lettering by hand. I suggest that you try doing the same.

  body: The second one seems a lot stronger to me (type and ornaments) and if you
    have the ambition to trace it, I say go for it. The ampersands seem a little off
    to me in both, but I'm not sure why.

  body: 'The direction your second option is taking is really lovely. I wouldn''t
    worry about fonts at all. You have gone far enough, and if you continue, that
    this would work without having to find a typeface. IMHO that will help this have
    a more bespoke and precious feel. '

  body: 'Second image: How about making the ampersand smaller, and/or maybe another
    colour? Unless you choose to change the actual shape of it. As it is, it looks
    too much like a reversed S, especially when there is a similar S just underneath,
    so the name looks like CUFFS'

    yes!, I was influenced by Marian Bantjes lovely treatments, I also admire <a href=\"http://www.siscottdesign.com/\"><strong>Si
    Scott</strong></a>'s work\r\n\r\nAlso, any websites or tips on how to trace (i've
    read here and there that the less anchor points in my bezier curves the better,
    but I wonder if there is any theory behind it...)\r\n\r\nThanks again!!\r\n\r\n-p"

  body: "If I was preparing your second image to redraw in Illustrator I would rotate
    the scan clockwise to help keep more of the bezier handles on the vertical and
    horizontal. I would suggest that your S is rather wide, adjusting it will mean
    your last flourish will also have to be amended. I would also look at the usual
    stresses of the middle of an S.\r\nTim"

  body: Your _S_ is a little wonky in the modulation of the stroke, it doesn't seem
    as refined as the rest of the letters which are nice. Try making the Ampersand
    smaller, it's definitely reading as a _S_ subconsciously anyways. Modulation on
    that is a bit wonky as well. Good start!

  body: "You will need thicker strokes on the U's, C and B. I would also look at a
    narrower B and broader Fs and Ts. You might also add some overshoot on the curved
    letters. This might give you some direction for the S middle stroke, think of
    it as drawing it with a broad nib. \r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/urw/britannic/\r\n\r\nTim"

  body: As Tim wrote, you need thicker strokes here and there. Keep in mind that this
    mark will be reproduced at a fairly small size to fit a business card (or smaller),
    so you don't want the thins to disappear. I am definitely reading the ampersand
    as an S, so work on that.
