  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>I really confuse with my question, it made dirty my mind for a days, &ldquo;Is typography a science?&rdquo;</p>
<p>50/50. I think Typography is mixture of art and science. Because, Typography is art and another side is science. The science side is about how to make the text and letters can be more readable, legible, and proper with people who want to use it.</p>
<p>The characteristics of science is:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Knowledge.
I think typography have it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Scientifically Ordered
I think typography doesn&rsquo;t have it yet.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Using the power of thought
Have it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Objective
Sure. The object is type.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>that&rsquo;s all..</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Interesting, I was wondering about &lsquo;scientifically ordered&rsquo; yesterday at Ampersand. Tim Brown was explaining his <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/ohbendy/5844599533/in/set-72157626864079627/">modular scaling system </a> into which you can plug in your &lsquo;key&rsquo; type size, and it returns a set of compatible sizes that click. (Try it out at <a href="http://modularscale.com/">modularscale.com</a> (still under development).</p>
<p>It made me question whether principles of typography can be so easily translated into Maths. Music can also be translated into Maths, but IMO something is lost in translation, and the results are not useful for creating music.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>i think typography may be a science someday. It has so many rules in its knowledge and making type. Now, typography is a part of design art yet.</p>
<p>If typography is science, which one it will be classified? Natural Science (the study of natural phenomena) and Social Science (study human behavior). I think it will included in Social Science. Because, the usage Typography is never separated with human&rsquo;s life. (while Wikipedia explain typography is an art and technique to arrange type). Typography may be included into formal science also, or applied science (the object is mainly engineering).</p>
<p>If typography is NOT a science. Why there is the academy discipline of it? Why there is professor of Typography? Why Typography is studied by people? I expect typography is a science soon. Looks! We only need to find the basic laws that universal.</p>
<p>Science is a systematic enterprise that builds and organizes knowledge in the form of testable explanations and predictions about the world. (Wikipedia)</p>
<p>Some characteristic of Science:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Knowledge
Typography is created by the ideas and curiosity of humankind. It can be as craft and engineering.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Scientifically ordered
To be a science, something needs a arranged knowledge. That arranged knowledge can be called as science. Typography has knowledge, about its history, legibility and readability, the role to human life. Even more, Typography has scope and experimental things. However, there is none arranging knowledge in typography yet.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Using power of thought
Knowledge comes from idea and curiosity of human. The idea and curiosity come from fact. Since Aldine has found, Akzidenz-Grotesk is labelled as wierd, Comic sans hated, I think Typography is really interesting. The people could judge and evaluate some type in majority way. It&rsquo;s a clue that it can be concluded into science.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Objective
The object is type and i said before, Typography has scope. And scope is preventing people to not step into outer boundaries. The Comic Sans case, the masters of type said the same thing. Comic Sans may not used as grave text, traffic text, ect. Some other said that Comic Sans have bad kerning. It&rsquo;s clue that Typography is science.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Adien, you are thinking about very interesting things but to do this kind of subject justice you have to bite off bits at a time and really chew them. What you are doing in your reasoning is too broad and too unfocused. As a result it feels like the kind of argument I might hear at a party. It is fun enough in some ways - but it can&rsquo;t be taken seriously.</p>
<p>Also many people are spending a lot of time doing this work now and it is getting less and less hard to find out about it. I suggest that you do look into this work. Take your time, but do your research!</p>

		<div class="commentbody">The modular scale is a system of ratios. You pick a key type size and the system generates a set of compatible sizes based on whichever ratio you pick. So in that slide, the key type size is 16pt. The modular scale shows two other sizes, 25.88 and 9.88 point, obtained by multiplying and dividing by the Golden Ratio, 1.618. Setting type at these sizes is said to be harmonious on the page/screen. For me there are so many variables (leading, line length, and of course the style of the font itself) that even with the modular scale you can still easily end up with a mess. A design eye is unavoidably crucial.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Modern notions of science tend to focus on method rather than on &lsquo;arrangement of knowledge&rsquo;. Knowledge can be arranged in any number of ways, many of them arbitrary, whimsical or willful. See, for example, the majority of typeface classification schemes, which certainly involve arrangement of knowledge but are anything but scientific. Science isn&rsquo;t something one has: it is something one <em>does.</em> So the question is not whether typography is or is not a science, but what it means to do science in the context of typography.</div>

<p>Bordens &amp; Abbott’s (2008) diagram of the scientific method</p>
<p>And if you want a nice start into researching the field of a scientific approach to the practice of typography, Kevin Larson has a nice piece of writing which isn’t that hard of a read:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/typography/ctfonts/wordrecognition.aspx">http://www.microsoft.com/typography/ctfonts/wordrecognition.aspx</a></p>
<p>Many people consider Miles Tinker to be one of the earlier contributors to this field. His work is not that hard to read either. You may need a bit of help with the statistics. I also (try to) keep a growing list of literature for my own records:</p>
<p><a href="http://readthetype.com/literature/">http://readthetype.com/literature/</a></p>
<p>You will most likely need access to scientific journal databases for the majority of this content, but it has been my experience that if you contact the authour directly they are more than willing to share their work. And Google Scholar seems to be far more successful than it used to be.</p>
<p>Additional threads include:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.typophile.com/node/59093">http://www.typophile.com/node/59093</a>
<a href="http://typophile.com/node/61626">http://typophile.com/node/61626</a>
<a href="http://typophile.com/node/58433">http://typophile.com/node/58433</a></p>
<p>And Craig (eliason) is correct. There is certainly no shortage of debate on this topic at Typophile. Chances are, the conversation you’re looking for had already happened several times. Good luck with your research.</p>

<p>No. Incidentally, Strizver doesn&rsquo;t use the term readability, but &ldquo;character recognition&rdquo;.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Are you saying that the widened crossbars are aesthetic, not craft, because their effect on text readability cannot be scientifically measured?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Not at all.</p>
<p>What can&rsquo;t be measured now, and may well be measured soon are two different things. And there are important things that may never be measured. What of readability can be measured and not is a work in progress in reading science.</p>
<p>You have insisted here on typophile that a science of readability, which would include measures of readability, is IMPOSSIBLE.</p>
<p>My TypeCon talk will show the science of readability already exists, and has begun to have interesting results, though a lot of progress is yet to be made.</p>
<p>Whether widened crossbars in themselves help readability I doubt, but they may in some contexts; it&rsquo;s not a settled issue.</p>
<p>Just to be clear, I also don&rsquo;t think that readability always trumps aesthetics. Quite often in display type maximum readability should be sacrificed to aesthetic goals. Also there are, of course, practical considerations other than ease of reading of continuous text involved in designing a page and a document—including hierarchy of ideas, ease of navigation for the reader, and more.</p>

Line spacing for both typefaces was 5.15 mm. The text was set flush left with a maximum line length of 33.75 picas.

		<div class="commentbody">Nick, I don&rsquo;t think Bill defined aesthetics as &lsquo;anything that can&rsquo;t be measured&rsquo;, and you had to delete a large amount of intervening text to stick those two statements side-by-side. In his final paragraph, Bill is talking about design decisions and how functional readability may be legitimately and knowingly reduced for aesthetic effect in some circumstances. He doesn&rsquo;t suggest anywhere that aesthetics is &lsquo;what&rsquo;s left over when you can&rsquo;t measure any more&rsquo;; rather, he is quite reasonably pointing out that the visual beauty of a text is independent of its readability. <a href="http://www.freewebs.com/kakayicalligraphy/foto%202.jpg">That seems to me uncontroversial</a>. Nor is it the case that the aesthetics of typography cannot be measured, but it must be measured in ways that differ from how we might measure readability, e.g. presenting different settings of the same text to people and recording which one they prefer to read, i.e. finding ways to quantify subjective responses to the visual appearance of text before reading.</div>

<p>I think the question of whether typography is or could be a science is less interesting than the question of the potential impact of science on practice. What about this question: if compelling scientific evidence suggested that readability would benefit from doing something that was contrary to the established canons of text typography, would you do it?</p>

That is a far better question! and put better than mine.  For me, the problem is &ldquo;what constitutes scientific evidence&rdquo;?  Just because scientists have done a study and post their results does not mean that their conclusion is a direct correlation of what the test measured.  My biggest concern is the quantum leap between measuring saccade count and inferring something more about it that what it shows.</p>
<p>If I were convinced that something that came out of a number of scientific studies countered traditional typographic practice, I surely would value that over tradition.  That being said, I don&rsquo;t particularly follow standard typographic tradition anyway.  Not that I have anything against it, it just does not interest me since there are thousands who already take that road and one more won&rsquo;t be of much value.</p>

<p>Nick, I am getting the feeling that you identify science with positivism—which includes such views as: if you can&rsquo;t measure it, it&rsquo;s meaningless or it&rsquo;s unimportant or it&rsquo;s purely subjective. And you think when I advocate the value of science I&rsquo;m advocating positivism. But science is not positivism, and I&rsquo;m not a positivist. And, as John said, I certainly don&rsquo;t believe the above idea that you seem to think I believe.</p>
<p>For starters, I think there is a lot about readability that we can&rsquo;t yet measure, but will be able to in the not too distant future.</p>
<p>I think the problem with most past legibility research is, to be blunt, that it has been poor science. If it had been good science, the results would have been much more compelling, and those working with type would have been more convinced of its value, and would be guided by its results. Most people dealing with type professionally haven&rsquo;t been much impressed by has come from scientific researchers on legibility, and I think their skepticism has been largely justified.</p>
<p>I wasn&rsquo;t intending to beat my drum again, but at TypeCon I will tell a lost story about readability, and some outstanding work on it. I think the whole story, which I only learned of in the past few months, will make a lot clearer what we have been going round and round about over the years here on Typophile, not very fruitfully. I don&rsquo;t mean that it resolves all the problems, but it does clarify a lot.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Bill, this has nothing to do with positivism or philosophy.</p>
<p>My posts have never been against science, I have used my knowledge of typography to debunk bad science, under which I include the idea that &ldquo;readability&rdquo; can be measured with regard to anything other than a specific document — certainly not to the individual constituent elements such as x-height, weight, leading, line length, and typeface choice, in any manner that will be prescriptive to typographers. A template is the kiss of death*.</p>
<p>Just because some scientists think they are conducting useful experiments doesn&rsquo;t mean that what they&rsquo;re doing is any better than phrenology or graphology.</p>
<p>I made a criticism of what you wrote in this post, in particular your definition of aesthetics and readability as two non-overlapping concepts, when you said, &ldquo;I also don&rsquo;t think that readability always trumps aesthetics.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In my opinion, aesthetics, courtesy of the skill and good taste that a practising typographer has acquired and embedded in a document, is an important part of readability. When I decide on the width of a sidebearing by dragging it until it looks just right, this is an aesthetic decision which I believe contributes to the readability of text which may be set with the font.</p>
<p>When I choose a particular combination of typeface, size, line length, and page layout for a particular text, by playing around in InDesign or Quark until it looks just right on the monitor, and printing it out on a laser printer, and trying to imagine the final job offset on a particular paper stock, I am using my aesthetic judgement to set values which may subsequently be measured.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think this issue is much different than the way people have been trying to create scientific advertising for over 100 years, with only limited success. If creating predictably readable (and actionable) documents has met with such limited success there, why should these efforts by any different? These new experiments don&rsquo;t exist in a vacuum, but have that baggage to deal with.</p>
<p>To clarify: reading research, good; readability research, bad.</p>
<p>*The most conventional, template-friendly area of typography is the book. So it&rsquo;s it&rsquo;s no surprise that this is the area (continuous reading of immersive text) where scientific studies are considered to have the most relevance. However, how is that engaged by readability studies that use, for instance, the RSVP method?!</p>

But they aren&rsquo;t the same, and sometimes, such as in a wedding invitation, or a monogram, an elaborate script that is not very readable may be just the thing aesthetically.

<p>Well, you&rsquo;re wrong, and I suspect your error is because you think of such research in the mold of some bad research that&rsquo;s been done. But as I keep saying and you keep not believing, there is more to science than that.</p>

<p>I disagree. The fancy script for a wedding invitation is used because it is more readable in that context.</p>
<p><em>Well, you&rsquo;re wrong, and I suspect your error is because you think of such research in the mold of some bad research that&rsquo;s been done.</em></p>
<p>There you go again, with the false interpretations.
I&rsquo;m right, because, as I keep saying, only the readability of documents can be measured—it&rsquo;s impossible to isolate the readability of individual typographic parameters and use such indices to predict the readability of future documents.</p>
<p>Even if one predicts the readability of a template, that will fail with diminishing returns, because people get bored, culture changes.</p>

<p>Very well.
However, isn&rsquo;t it true that the &ldquo;science&rdquo; of readability, as practised, claims to be somewhat more than it is, and almost invariably draws deductions that pertain to more than the specific documents tested?</p>
<p>Your myopia analogy is so BAD I won&rsquo;t even begin to address it.</p>
<p>How do you explain the readability of the Paul Rand book set in Univers Bold?
Readability theory says that a bold sans serif is not suitable for the text of a book, such things should never be. 
But the body text in question is not just &ldquo;aesthetic&rdquo;, it is functionally readable.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>it&rsquo;s impossible to isolate the readability of individual typographic parameters and use such indices to predict the readability of future documents.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Three factors involved in myopia are the shape of the eyeball, of the cornea, and the flexibility of the lens. If the eyeball is too long front to back, then one cannot focus at a distance as well. If the lens becomes too rigid, as in presbyopia, then also the lens cannot be adjusted as much for distance vs close work. And the shape of the cornea can cause myopia.</p>
<p>So by your reasoning, even though we can measure whether individual eyes suffer from myopia, it is IMPOSSIBLE to measure the separate factors of eyeball shape, cornea shape and the lens&rsquo;s ability to adjust, right? And to predict the total amount of myopia on the basis of those three factors, and a knowledge of their complex but determinate interaction, is IMPOSSIBLE. That&rsquo;s beyond the realm of science, IMPOSSIBLE, right?</p>

		<div class="commentbody">The context for a wedding invitation is quite different than for urgent medical instructions.  The invitation is meant to be read slowly and reread and commented on.  The people getting it in most cases already know about the wedding.  What is used on the invitation is more a product of the bride and grooms personal whimsey.  Why would anyone spend research grant money to test ledgi[-readi-know-get-the-point]-ibilty for a wedding invitation?  There are a few things that require quick reading and understanding.  Most of these are product graphics on equipment that can cause harm if not used correctly (anything from a jetliner control panel or nuclear reactor to medical equipment.  In those cases, the least problematic decision is the typeface.  All of the placement and proximity issues as well as most other human factors issues are the real issue.  If you want to spend time doing something valuable,test air traffic control systems for error prone configurations and let the mother of the bride duke it out with the grooms mother for rights to pick wedding invitations.  Wedding party families won&rsquo;t listen to you anyway.</div>

<p>Legibility has been used with many different meanings. One is ease of deciphering what letters are on the page or screen. Another has to do with speed of reading extended text.</p>
<p>Whatever way you slice it, readable or legible, wedding scripts are not designed to maximize these qualities that are desirable for extended text.</p>
<p>As Chris writes, with the wedding invitation, you are meant to linger over the names of the bride and groom, and think about the wedding as something beautiful and significant. The ornate scripts can convey this. Legibility or readability aren&rsquo;t so important.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p><em>Readability in the sense used in books on type and typography means ease of reading extended text.</em></p>
<p>Well, I haven&rsquo;t done a literature survey, but that sounds a bit simplistic.</p>
<p>In <em>Letters of Credit</em> Walter Tracy uses the word &ldquo;comfort&rdquo; rather than ease. Not quite the same thing.</p>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t done the historiography, but I&rsquo;m under the impression that &ldquo;readability&rdquo; emerged with a bifurcation of the meaning of &ldquo;legibility&rdquo; (originally used, for instance, in Linotype&rsquo;s Legibility Series of the 1920s, with much of the meaning now attributed to readability), the distinction becoming necessary when typographers realized that even the most easily decipherable of types could be made unreadable (in the sense of hyperbole) by poor typography.</p>
<p>Mention of readability in type books etc. is generally qualified against legibility, and described with an emphasis on the typographic qualities of page layout, not so much on the speed of reading book text.</p>

<p>I wasn&rsquo;t around in the 1930s.</p>
<p>However, I was a working typographer—art directing advertising and marketing from 1976 on.
When scientists and academic researchers tell me that things were not what I thought they were, that I&rsquo;ve got it all wrong and wasn&rsquo;t doing what I thought I was doing, or doing it blindly for the wrong reasons, and they know better, then I view their rewriting of my reality with extreme skepticism.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve read a lot of type and design books, and my overwhelming impression is that the term readability has been used in tandem with legibility as a twin concept, referring to layout qualities, with legibility meaning the decipherability of glyphs. As such, I have never thought of readability as &ldquo;ease of reading&rdquo;, and from the perspective of someone who wants the ad copy I&rsquo;m setting to be read down to the final call to action, I have always considered readability to be have a certain amount of push (at my discretion), rather than being a passive quality of a block of text from a type specimen, that can be dialed up.</p>
<p><em>Nick, wouldn&rsquo;t you say the &lsquo;typographic qualities of page layout&rsquo; are a means of improving readability — rather than an end in themselves (aesthetics aside)?</em></p>
<p>I would, and I also believe that&rsquo;s been the consensus among typographers for many years (as we have Lost the Real Story, according to Bill!)</p>

I don&rsquo;t want to get too deep into the weeds here on philosophy of science, but Bridgeman&rsquo;s hope that operational definitions are a magic wand to clear up terminology in science turned out not to work.</p>
<p>Such scientific variables as force, mass and time do not have operational definitions. They are defined implicitly as part of testable theories, and that, in my view is the best way to do it. Going round and round is the result of getting hung up on definitional matters, instead of trying to get good theories to understand and explain our experience. What are missing is not better definitions, but better theories.</p>
<p>By the way, the idea of &ldquo;construct validity&rdquo; of a term as explained by Donald Campbell provides an alternative to operational definitions. It is widely accepted in social psychology, I believe. I am not totally happy with Campbell&rsquo;s approach, but it shows how you have to depart of operational definitions.</p>

<p>I think he would have concluded that any theory that would be central to a science of typography, concerning such things as serifs vs. sans, line length, leading, or x-height, is not falsifiable, and therefore a science of typography is not possible.</p>
<p>For example, a serif-superiority theory that attempted to disprove the null hypothesis, &ldquo;Serif and sans serif fonts are equally readable&rdquo; would run into serious statistical difficulties of acquiring a random sample meaningful enough to enable falsification, beginning with the subjective categorization of candidate fonts. Try the keywords &ldquo;serif&rdquo; and &ldquo;sans&rdquo; at MyFonts, almost 10,000 fonts, and see what comes up.</p>
<p>At the moment, reading researchers don&rsquo;t even use randomized font samples. Without random sampling, if an experiment favors Times over Helvetica, that&rsquo;s all it&rsquo;s doing, not saying anything about serifs vs. sans. Formulating general theories about typography but only testing the usual suspects can&rsquo;t be good science.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s not just the fonts—there are other typographic strata that affect readability:</p>
<ul>
<li>layout</li>
<li>font size</li>
<li>leading</li>
<li>line length</li>
<li>paper stock</li>
<li>printing method</li>
<li>digital device</li>
<li>platform</li>
<li>browser</li>
<li>font format</li>
<li>hinting</li>
<li>reader demographic</li>
<li>typographer</li>
<li>text content</li>
</ul>
<p>Given the current narrowly defined methods used, it&rsquo;s a huge jump to extrapolate from laboratory to general usage, too big, in practice, for science. Bear in mind that the target is moving, too, with new technology.</p>
<p>It would be possible to come up with a few standard settings, and index the readability of certain fonts in those settings, for specific output devices and reader demographics. Would that be science?</p>
<p>Is my criticism—that falsifiability is in practice, impossible—valid?</p>

<p>No.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure, but I think you are making the mistake of thinking that because <em>explaining everything</em> in a specific field is unlikely or impossible, that <em>explaining some things</em> in a testable way is impossible.</p>
<p>For example, it is still impossible to completely explain the motion of the planets using Newton&rsquo;s theory. The interactions between the planets—the &ldquo;many body problem&rdquo;—has not been solved. But it is still possible to test Newton&rsquo;s theory satisfactorily in less complex circumstances.</p>
<p>Similarly, I don&rsquo;t expect anybody will explain <em>everything</em> about typography and the brain, but I do think there will be testable theories of <em>some things</em>, and in fact already are.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll go into this with examples after TypeCon.</p>

<p>Anything can be tested and theories corroborated, but the issue I&rsquo;ve raised is falsifiability, not <em>explaining things</em>.</p>
<p>Typography is not a &ldquo;many body problem&rdquo;.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re not just dealing with the mechanical performance of a physical object such as an eyeball or a planet, but with a far more complicated process.</p>
<p>Anyway, I look forward to discussing this further after TypeCon.</p>

<p>Testability and falsifiability are the same thing. You can conceive of observable circumstances that could contradict the theory. The idea is that the theory is sufficiently precise to exclude some possibilities. When theories are sufficiently vague, like most of astrology, you can&rsquo;t test them. &ldquo;Next week you will face important opportunities.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Unless you&rsquo;re an empiricist, in which case you would be testing for verifiability.</p>
<p><em>When theories are sufficiently vague, like most of astrology, you can&rsquo;t test them.</em></p>
<p>Astrological theory is quite precise, with regards to the calendar.
However, I will hold off comparing typographic theory to astrology until you reveal your &ldquo;testable theories&rdquo;!</p>

<p>To respond to the initial post. I&rsquo;ve always thought grasp of typography was something like epiphany. And that it can&rsquo;t be taught. Our exemplars are historic, and founded in artistic/craft concerns. Science? Like, who are the stellar exemplars of the typographic scientific method?</p>
