body: "Some time ago we bought the Bitstream Type Odyssey which contains a very nice
  <strong>[[Futura]] </strong>version. Unfortunatly it doesn\u2019t come with SC&Osf.
  And [[Bitstream]] doesn\u2019t provide them either. So I stumbled upon the <strong>[[Neufville]]</strong>
  versions. But I wonna know if those versions play (formally) well together before
  I take out my Magic Plastic Card. Does anybody has any experience combining the
  two?\r\n"

  body: not a direct answer, but if you're open to replacing Futura right out, [[Mark
    Simonson]]'s <a href="http://www.ms-studio.com/FontSales/proximanova.html">Proxima
    Nova</a> has all the bells and whistles.

  body: For technical reasons I would suggest buying the entire family, rather than
    just the SC version, then trying to pair with the other family. being that these
    have different metrics, I would assume that they would not look quite as good
    together. Although, I don't have direct experience using them in this way.

  body: forrest norvell (who's gone missing of late) calls Neufville's version "the
    most elegant version of the modern Futura." in a review of futura versions, which
    you can read at http://www.typomancy.org.

  body: I feel your pain but have to agree with Paul and Kyle... in the long run you'll
    probably be happier with the family version - but it's worth a try to see if the
    two will play nicely together.

  body: It's tempting to buy the whole family, but my budget doesn't allow me just
    yet. I'll see what I can do with combining the 2.

  body: Futura, I find, looks very uncomfortable with too much old style usage. Also,
    Bitstream's Futura, depending on how you are using it, can be finagled. If you
    use the right weights and alter the percentage to which you set the smallcaps.
    But, large but, one can only get away with this if used sparingly.

    of expensive, but on par with the others.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.bertholdtypes.com/home.html"

  body: "I didn't post about the Berthold version because, well, sometimes it's hard
    to find good information about Berthold types, for reasons that are documented
    elsewhere. At some point I may do a followup to that article where I can talk
    about that, as well as talk about some of the Futura-alikes out there, as well
    as give my own (sure to be popular) opinion on that eternal question: Futura or
    Neutraface?\r\n\r\nAnd yeah, I've been missing, first because of vacation, then
    because of computer \"issues\" (had to replace my laptop's hard drive twice, had
    a bad backup that had to be worked around and which sort of required me to upgrade
    to Tiger, had to replace the motherboard and display, etc), then had to play catchup
    at work for a while, but now I'm back. I'm sure you're all relieved."

  body: welcome back forrest! and not that it's a look alike, but have you seen Mark
    Simonson's Proxima Nova? It was love at first sight for me and i've been raving
    about it since.

  body: I checked out Proxima Nova, and while I like it, and it's certainly geometric
    in some ways, it feels more like a humanist sans to me. It's less rigid than Futura,
    and while I'm slowly getting tired of Futura's rigidity, I think its "precision"
    or "tightness" are probably the sources of its appeal to most people. It's definitely
    a more complete family than most of the easily available versions of Futura, though.
