  post here, although I've been frequenting the boards for a while. \r\n\r\nSo a brief
  summary of the concept... After moving to Wellington, NZ a few months ago, I began
  working on this as an observation/exploration of the type and design in the area.
  I was originally particularly struck by the Wellington logo(see below) but wanted
  to try to come up with something that would be a little more practical, while reflecting
  some of the more conservative signage around the city.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/wellingtonlogo_5694.png]\r\n\r\nOriginally
  I intended for this to be a display face, but I'm thinking I'd like to get it to
  work at smaller sizes such as 8 or 10pt. I haven't worked too much on the spacing
  yet, and still have a few glyphs to fill out. The PDF below has all the glyphs I've
  completed and some text samples.\r\n\r\nI'm fairly new to typeface design, so I'm
  sure there's lots of room for improvement on this. Any thoughts and advice would
  be greatly appreciated. "

  body: "How do!! Looks really nice. I like the concept. The first thing that stuck
    out for me was the lower case e, it seems too sharp compared to the rest of the
    glyphs. Something else that strikes me is the little serif you have on the capital
    H, I, K, L and U. Why isn't it replicated on the B, D, E, F, J, N, P and R? It
    could be too much if it was done, but at the moment it doesn\u2019t seem to be
    solid; the L's stick out in \"wet lands plan approved.\" maybe it is just that
    one sentence? The lower case looks very good though. Again I like where it\u2019s
    going! \r\n\r\nStef\r\n"

  body: "Thanks Bendy and Stef. I appreciate your thoughts. I see what you are saying
    about the e. The serifs on the caps is something I've been struggling with, and
    I'm glad you brought that up. I was trying to follow the logic of the lowercase,
    with the serifs being more of an entry and exit to the glyph, inspired partly
    by the scripty l, i and n from the logo. But it is kind of awkward and inconsistent
    in its present form. I'll give it a try with the serifs carried all throughout,
    as well as without any, and let you guys have a look.\r\n\r\nThanks again."

  body: "A fuller crit...\r\n\r\nThis looks really nice in text. I like the wide tracking
    and leading and think the serifs work very nicely...I'd add them to lots more
    letters, especially caps. The contrast is really nice and the glyphs seem to flow
    well and make nice word shapes. It's also really nicely drawn.\r\n\r\nThe glyphs
    I'd look at are:\r\nA: looks narrowish.\r\nD: maybe a hair too narrow?\r\nG: maybe
    a bit wide and/or the bottom corner could be lower?\r\nH,I: nice serif treatment.\r\nM,N:
    Nice joins.\r\nP: deeper bowl?\r\nV,W: Nice like the M and N.\r\nY: a bit narrow?\r\nZ:
    corners a bit too pointy; try bevelling more?\r\n\r\na: seems to need narrower
    sidebearing on the right.\r\ne: bevel the nose? or curve the crossbar? \r\nf:
    wider crossbar?\r\ng: ear looks stumpy and sad. Needs more energy I think.\r\nk:
    what about a looped arm? It's got a very pointy terminal.\r\no: pull out the bcps
    from the nodes more, it looks too oval.\r\nr: terminal needs more oomph at the
    end. Try cutting it more vertically?\r\nt: see f. Foot may need to be wider too.\r\nu:
    looks ever so slightly too wide.\r\nw: pull the feet apart more? Looks light.\r\nz:
    see Z. \r\n\r\nNumerals: lovely. The join on 9 needs thinning. \r\n\r\nThe punctuation
    is really neat. Comma and quotes look a little too fiddly/detailed. The tail is
    very thin.\r\n\r\n\r\nGood work, keep going :)\r\n"

    I could use a little help on are:\r\n\r\n1. Are the serifs in the upper case working?
    If not, should I give it a full serif treatment, or just get rid of them? I also
    added a few serifs to the diagonals in the lowercase. \r\n2. The LC serifs are
    a bit rounder than the UC serifs. Is this weird? I had originally drawn the UC
    with round serifs, but they just didn't look solid.\r\n3. Is the e still too pointy?
    I tried a more cursive e, which looks nice on its own, but is really distracting
    when set in text.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Picture2_4443.png]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Picture3_5145.png]"

    'e' (first \"other option\") is interesting - does it not work in text?\r\n\r\nI'm

    one I would address, by thickening the diagonal part or altering where the thickening
    starts top and bottom."

    going to agree with Craig and recommend the hybrid e; really interesting...have
    a look at Parisine Plus which has a similar shaped alt e.\r\nI prefer the fourth
    g (second 'other option')\r\nI'd like to see what it looks like with serifs on
    the inside of the top counter on S and on the bottom of the left side of the top
    of T. I think it might possibly be interesting to have a serif on the bottom crossbar
    of E (right side, pointing up)."

    judge the differences between the new alternatives - does the spine just keep
    getting thicker? One thing to watch is that a too-thick spine will start to make
    the terminals look weak. But this kind of contrast adjustment is best done looking
    at the other letters alongside.\r\n\r\nThe first new 'v' terminal - where it just
    turns vertical at the top - best fits your other letters' character, I think.
    And yes, I think that treatment is promising for helping out 'V' and 'W'."

    went back to the straightened exit strokes on vwy, but gave them angled terminals(not

    maybe I should just let it go. \r\n\r\nThanks! "

  body: "This is turning into an interesting puzzle isn't it?\r\n\r\nI like the curved
    diagonals and the angled terminals. The difficulty is that the curved upstrokes
    make the counters a bit too narrow, I think. And I think the angled terminals
    need to have a little overshoot. I think it might be too much to have both the
    curves and the entry serifs. I marginally prefer the ones with the entry serifs
    and angled terminals.\r\n\r\nI don't think the serif on T works, but I like it
    on S and E. I'm not sure about L. I quite like the occasional-ness.\r\n\r\nI'd
    go with @ number four too. \r\n\r\nI like the way you just have a flat (ish) terminal
    on d and j but think it sticks out a bit as all the other stems have terminal
    features. \r\n\r\nI think the arm of r should be wider?\r\n\r\nWhat about a small
    entry stroke for the z?\r\n\r\nBottom corner of G doesn't quite look right somehow.
    I'm not sure what I'd do to it. \r\n\r\nI'd make the tail of Q deeper and M a
    bit wider.\r\n\r\nThe e is super! I'd bring the left join of the crossbar down
    slightly (keeping the nice curve) but I think that's just my personal taste.\r\n\r\nGreat
