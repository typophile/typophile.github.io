  the many requests for a [[http://exljbris.wordpress.com/2008/02/03/museo-goes-lowercase/|lowercase
  of MUSEO]] I decided to have another go at it. The only drawback is that it\u2019s
  gonna take me longer to finish it."

    I also see problems with the w between o and e, it creates some kind of \u201Cwave\u201D
    effect. Other than that, I really like the uppercase and the face in general,
    great work so far."

  body: "Thanks Antonio. I've worked on the LC's for about a week now ... a really
    short time and everything is still open to change. I'm not sure about the a either
    although I like it much, I'm also considering the one on the image. I think you're
    right about w ... I've changed it slightly.\r\n\r\n [img:sites/default/files/old-images/MUSEO_LC3_6101.gif]"

    making italics for Museo, but I am considering it for Museo Sans."
