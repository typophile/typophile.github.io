    They are only baits. In the future, I will ignore your antisocial posts, and I

  body: "Skylar, like most artists you seem to be good at hallucinating. You have
    no idea what drives me. This isn't about intimidation or baiting - it's about
    dedication and persistence (which BTW are requirements for <em>designing</em>
    the type you clearly appreciate using).\r\n\r\nEven though I don't like type-IDs*
    (especially these days when it's mostly a matter of siccing some dumb software
    on a heaping junkyard of pirated fonts**) my only motivation here was not sabotage,
    but correcting what I see as a misconception. I might be overzealous -or hopelessly
    romantic- in trying to educate people who might only be interested in a quickie
    ID of a font they'll never pay for but the idealist in me believes that <em>public</em>
    (see below) attempts at education (which goes both ways - I learn things here
    all the time) benefit society, or at least this society of type.\r\n\r\n* The
    \"point of this board\"? If you mean Typophile, you're being ridiculous. If you
    mean the ID board, all I would say is it's a sad excuse for real typographic discussion
    (not to mention a piracy tool). The ID board should not and cannot exist in a
    vacuum outside of the Typophile umbrella. Why not? Because people like me -who
    are not here for mindless type IDs- will see you and possibly react.\r\n\r\n**
    Contrast with the ones here:\r\nhttp://typophile.com/node/96464#comment-522639\r\n\r\nLook
    at your over-reaction to my simple question at the beginning, and realize that
    you messed up by insulted me for no good reason. I suspect you're anger with me
    had been building up for a while. Is that because I confront ID parasites who
    don't really value type?\r\n\r\nAnd yes, whether as an artist you're successful
    or not is a moot point way beyond the fact that this is not remotely a blackletter.\r\n\r\n<blockquote>I
    will ignore your antisocial posts</blockquote>\r\n\r\nThat's your call. Just know
    that this is not a cocktail party. That would be even stupider than thinking type
    IDs are the point of type. And I'll be waiting for contributions by you beyond
    mindless* type-IDs (but I'm not holding my breath because you haven't managed
    that once in over six years now).\r\n\r\n* And often laughably desperate:\r\nhttp://typophile.com/node/96641\r\n\r\n<blockquote>If
    you want to discuss anything -- or take me to task on anything I've said -- feel
    free to email me through typophile.</blockquote>\r\n\r\nWhy does the thoughtful
    discussion you propose have to be done in private?\r\n\r\n--\r\n\r\nTal, I think
    you're making too easy a connection; narrow + rigid does not equal blackletter,
    and one letter by itself (which isn't even conclusive) does not a font make. I
    would recommend reading \"Blackletter: Type and National Identity\" by Bain and
    Shaw for a good introduction to that most luscious of typestyles.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: " I can see why the all caps looks blackletter in origin. Mostly because of
    the angles, it's reminiscent of the angle of the broad nib. Also the tight counters.
    If the tracking was tighter, it might actually create a texture of vertical lines.
    Also the diagonal of the R looks double jointed. But this is also very san serif
    looking. \r\n\r\nThe first image posted was just so small, it was hard to decipher
