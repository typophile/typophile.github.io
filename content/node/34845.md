  body: The practice might've come from wanting to space the letters more efficiently,
    like in <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/singles/carter_cone/mantinia_cc/&sample_text=SQuARe&sample_size=60">this
    example</a>.

  body: "If you mean things like the raised \"O\"s, that comes from the practice of
    lettering (typically in stone) where funny things were done to letters in order
    to fit the lines well, or save space/effort, or get fancy. As for the bullets
    between letters, the Ancient Romans did that between words, instead of using a
    blank space. But here it seems to be motivated by a desire to fill out the line.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "The superscript lowercase \"o\" with either dot or underscore below were
    also part of special mercantile and accounting symbols and characters, like the
    @ and #.\r\nTypically used to save space on tabular settings the word <em>Number</em>
    was frequently abbreviated to \"No.\" and to save even more space the dot or underscore
    was placed under the raised \"o\".\r\n\r\nI might be able to find samples of old
    mercantile pi characters, but not quickly."

  body: The use of dots as word separators can be dated back at least to the Mesha
    selle, about 842BC (written in Moabite, a language closely related to Phoenician
    and Hebrew). As for Mantinia, the <a href="http://www.fontbureau.com/fonts/Mantinia">Font
    Bureau Mantinia link</a> clearly establishes that it was inspired by the monumental
    lettering of imperial Rome. However, when I look more closely at the letters K
    and N in the word "Kingdom" above, I seem to get a closer match with <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/singles/carter_cone/itc_galliard_roman_cc/&sample_text=KINGDoM&sample_size=60">Galliard</a>
    than with <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/search/?q=mantinia&x=0&y=0&sample_text=KINGDoM&sample_size=60">Mantinia</a>.  I
    feel there is still some unresolved mystery.

  body: "On the dots as word separators.\r\n \r\nI believe the story is that in Semitic
    languages, which were the first to use the alphabet, they used dots and then spaces
    to separate words. In these, generally only the consonants were written. In Latin
    and Greek, which included symbols for vowel sounds, there were generally no word
    spaces. The word spaces were introduced into Latin and Greek by Irish scribes
    in the seventh century. \r\n\r\nMatthew Carter says that Mantinia is based on
    Andrea Mantegna's paintings and engravings of ancient Roman inscriptions. These
    evidently owe something to both the Roman stone carvers, and to Mantegna's own
    style. And then Carter is a third author.  "
