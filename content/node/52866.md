body: Is there a way to save the state of the windows in FontLab? Whenever I open
  up a file, or after I close a window, I have to resize and reposition the windows.
  It's really annoying.

    right-click on a font window and set the width of it to 8, 16, 24 or 32 glyph
    cells, a feature I find convenient.\r\n\r\nLife is full of vexing things and you
    could save yourself much in the way of annoyance by switching off your reaction
    to these things. Life is too short to let the small stuff like that get your goat.\r\n\r\nj

  body: I was asking because it felt natural that they would've included it in the
    program. A feature like that is useful and simple enough that it's just...expected.
    I thought there was a way, and that I was only unaware of it. Oh well.

    of remembering window size and position lead to this expectation. You have a good
    point, so I apologize if it seemed I was implying these things are too small to
    matter.\r\n\r\nYou're not asking for a lot and really the Fontlab folks should
    take note for future editions of their software.\r\n\r\n\r\nj a m e s"
