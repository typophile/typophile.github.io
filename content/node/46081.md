  that I'm doing for my blog ( http://whatype.wordpress.com/ ). This one shows the
  percentage of emissions that every country has signed to achieve by 2012.\r\n\r\nOnce
  again I would really appreciate every input you could give me on this.\r\n\r\nThank
  you so much in advance\r\n\r\nPedro Monteiro\r\nhttp://whatype.wordpress.com/\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/kyoto3b_6230.jpg]"

    know i pointed out only one, but each instance that is similar to this one. Still,
    its not a very large thumbnail.\r\n\r\nAlso, the alignment and spacing in the
    lower right corner.\r\n\r\nIt looks good tho!\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://evanmade.com\">evan</a>"
