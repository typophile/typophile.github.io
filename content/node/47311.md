  body: "My suggestion is to play around with the [[http://www.bowfinprintworks.com/SerifGuide/intro.php|Serif
    Font ID Guide]]. There are text samples of Roman and italics for many of the fonts,
    and you can pick characteristics of key letters you like, and see what fonts use
    them. It's awfully hard to have someone make suggestions, when we don't know what
    it's for, or what you consider 'fresh'.\r\n\r\n - Mike Yanega"
