		<div class="commentbody">_Joe: I will admit that your e-mail did prompt us to try and make these people a little more visible to everyone, I don't think there is anything wrong with that. Maybe we should say "thank you" for getting us to do something about it, even with this small step.

Typophile has never kept the identities of administrators or moderators concealed. Sure, perhaps we didn't surface our biographies to the "monstrosity" that is our home page, but this site is about the people who make up the larger community, not about us.

I'm actually very interested in the discussion that you propose, but I must remind you that we are not MetaFilter and do not try to be. There are a number of ways we can enhance the site - we know this - and we'd like to find ways to make it a better experience for everyone (finding the time is our biggest obstacle). As a matter of fact, for months now we have been re-designing and building what will eventually become Typophile 2.0, or 3.0 - or whatever version we are on :)


_William: Unfortunately Books has not gotten the attention it deserves in recent years, but it is still linked under "Resources."

Thanks, Zara, I stand corrected. Would it be possible to have a more prominent place? Then I think it might be more active, with new posts and reviews. </div>

		<div class="commentbody">This site is great. But I do hope that something is fixed with the tracking so that Christopher Dean doesn't have to write the word Tracking in every single thread. I mean, imagine if that caught on and everyone wrote the word Tracking.

If I do a search with the word Tracking, I find every single thread in which he has listed the word Tracking. What if I was looking for information on Tracking, as in letterspacing? I would be forced to sift thru all of his Tracking posts.

I therefore propose that Christopher use a different word, unrelated to typography itself, such as "disruptive," or "selfish."

Thanks.</div>

LOL.
And a lot of concurrance (if that is a word).

Moderators, can a link to the tracker be restored, and to a prominent place, labeled clearly eg. "recent posts"? That will make life easier for the newer users. The tracker, bookmarked, is what many veteran typophilers like myself use regularly as the entry to this great site. </div>

		<div class="commentbody">While I can understand the ease of using Typophile’s tracking functionality (and I second the request to be able to track a thread without having posted oneself), there are alternatives:
Bookmark the thread in question. Most browsers let you organise your bookmarks in folders, thus you could set up your Typophile folder.
Every thread has an RSS feed, see the little ‘rss’ link at the end of the original post. If you use a Feedreader, you can subscribe to the thread and keep track of new posts. In some browsers, you can store the RSS feed as a dynamic or ‘live’ bookmark.

Yes, until there's an alternate way to track a thread other than by marking it while I'm using Google reader, I'll stick to this method. Plain old browser bookmarking is only available to people who browse the internet via their own personal computer, which is I'm not. Should I replace the word "tracking" with "clapping" instead. :D

		<div class="commentbody">Unfortunately, this is getting into You People Suck territory real fast. The fact remains that this site is not per se “moderated” and the so-called moderators have done nothing to make themselves conspicuous or available. A “PLEASE READ” sticky thread about <em>how to post</em> is no substitute for a properly managed and open advisory of who runs this site. (It’s “a Punchcut gig.” What?)

Let me just ask one question here: More than half a decade in, why is it only now we are “meet[ing]” our “moderators”?

Typophile is not MetaFilter, but MetaFilter works better than Typophile and you should steal their ideas. I already have a list of suggestions from MetaFilter’s admins. A later thread will be posted.

 “I think Typophile is just great!” is not an argument against improvement, including the improvement of adding a MetaPhile section for discussions <em>of</em> Typophile.

Typography is a field that requires a long apprenticeship just to develop an eye. Well, guess what: The Internet has been around a long time (longer than the Web), and many online fora predate Typophile by years. Your own limited experience, and your gloss that things are just <em>fabulous</em> here, are no substitutes for a rationally managed and continuously improving Typophile.

We all have to remember that there is no paid staff or moderators here. This is a "for the love of it" group of volunteers who work here--they also have full-time jobs, full-time families, and the need for a few hours sleep on occasion. They are doing well more work than they are thanked by us to do. let alone paid by us to do.

We all know it isn't the most perfectly done site on earth and we would all like to see constant improvement. Since it is a"for the love of it" free gig, that only happens when more people volunteer their private time to do it.  The point is, any of us who has a problem with the site can also volunteer not just a verbal solution but pitch in the sweat off their brow to make it happen.  Pony up or be willing to live with the bumpy ride. Give the moderators the slack that you would want if you were doing it as a freebe.

Joe, your angry soul needs a little therapy. Perhaps getting outside and enjoying life beyond the internet would help. Or, maybe you'd like to volunteer your personal time to a community that you have been taking advantage of for over 4 years? Griping about it all the time is the easy part.

I have said this more times than I would like to admit, but we are well aware of areas on the site that could use improvements. To the development, the architecture, and the need for new and improved features. We do what we can - <cite>when we have the resources</cite> - but as a design firm that has full time clients, and with a small handful of people that have families and real lives outside of their careers, making these changes can be very difficult to achieve. But we try and we do what we can and we are making progress on the next generation of the site.

Moderators have <strong>always</strong> been present and known throughout the community, and have always been actively involved - for 9 years now. So making the claim that "…so-called moderators have done nothing to make themselves conspicuous or available" is absolute rubbish.

seriously, folks, joe clark is not "an angry soul",
and he's not "a troll".  he's a person who cares,
a lot, sometimes too much, and he speaks up...

he's the kind of spice that makes life interesting.

plus, since these are just electrons on the internet,
it's easy to ignore him if that's what you wanna do.

I recently left my other prime forum site (Adobe Forums) due to the disastrous changes that they made, causing an exodus of the best and brightest of the posters, I don't want to see Typophile follow that same route to disaster.

The level of moderation here is gentle and fair. You really can't ask for anything more.</div>

does joe clark favor heavy-handed moderation?

he cites metafile as an example, which -- to the
best of my knowledge -- isn't "heavy-handed"...

but i'll let joe speak for himself...
