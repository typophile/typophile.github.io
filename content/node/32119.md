body: The title of this book is _Portrait of a Marriage_ by Nigel Nicolson. Can anyone
  help me identify this type? It looks a lot like Bulmer, but I don't think that is
  it.

  body: "So much for that.  :-)\r\nBTW, other (older) names for this design are: Binny
    & Ronaldson #1; and Oxford. Monticello is the contemporary revival. This design
    is used in Updike's \"Printing Types\", and has a unique \"g\" (the only other
    place I've seen anything similar is in Fountain's Baskerville revival).\r\n\r\nAnd
    interestingly, just 3 days ago...\r\nhttp://typophile.com/node/32029\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: Wonderful! Thank you all so much. Now I can update the copyright page without
    totally changing the look of the book.
