    What are you using to create those images? The anti-aliasing is very weird-looking.\r\n\r\n

    good diagnostic letters for making an ID. This could just as easily (and likely)
    be a customized logo, done by some designer with no sense of adventure, or a conservative
    client.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: "I swear it's just Arial Black, obliqued and with a bit of a stroke added.
    That 'R' is perfectly Arial-esque, as is the crappy kerning between \"AS\". The
    small image size isn't very helpful, but I know Arial when I see it.\r\n\r\n -
