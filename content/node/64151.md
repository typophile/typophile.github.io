  body: "There's about 3 fonts there. I was looking at the connected script as 'handwriting',
    but then I guessed you were talking about the serif and sans fonts that looked
    hand-drawn. Did you check out Stephen Coles' list of hand-drawn text fonts? In
    my Script Guide they would be found in [[http://www.bowfinprintworks.com/Script06Pg1.html|Part
    6]], if I collected them.\r\n\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: "I do think at least the large serif lettering is a font, because I can't
    see differences in identical letters. The closest I found was [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/typadelic/jot/|Jot]]
    by Ronna Penner of Typadelic. It's possible she made a custom version for this
    company -- it seems that close to me.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
