  and i could find anything that would suit my logo, company name FOURMATION.\r\n\r\nOption
  1: Is the first attempt but decided that the font would be better suited to my logo
  if it was longer and narrower which ended up being Option 2.\r\n\r\nDo these work?
  Do they look ok? Is the kerning ok?\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\nMichael\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Fourmation_4988.jpg]"

    vote for #2."
