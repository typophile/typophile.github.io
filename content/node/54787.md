  body: "The closest resemblance I could find was [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/calligraphics/banjoman/|Banjoman]],
    and it's not particularly close. I have looked at the word \"pearlfisher\" so
    many times in the past few minutes that the word has lost its meaning.\r\n\r\nSomething
    in the back of my mind keeps saying \"Jeremy Tankard\", but I am having a terrible
    time getting my browsers to work today.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

    Island]] for Adobe must have been what I was thinking, because nothing else of
    his is 'broken' like this lettering.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: "Mike, funny: The exact same thing happened to me too, having \"Jeremy Tankard\"
    echo in my mind, looking up Blue Island and being disappointed that it's so different.
    \r\nMight it be completely custom? (I know, that's the easy way out ;-) )"
