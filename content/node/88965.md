body: "Hello dear community.\r\n\r\nI have a question \u2013 mainly \u2013 on font
  pairing (and I know about the [[http://www.google.com/#sclient=psy-ab&hl=en&site=&source=hp&q=typeface+pair+OR+pairing+OR+match+OR+matching+OR+combining+OR+combination+OR+tango+site%3Atypophile.com&pbx=1&oq=typeface+pair+OR+pairing+OR+match+OR+matching+OR+combining+OR+combination+OR+tango+site:typophile.com&aq=f&aqi=&aql=&gs_sm=s&gs_upl=779l779l0l2219l1l0l0l0l0l0l0l0ll0l0&bav=on.2,or.r_gc.r_pw.,cf.osb&fp=17aa82c2bf337dfc&biw=1229&bih=662|available
  threads]]). \r\nIn a document I use Cycles Eleven by Sumner Stone for body text
  and Montserrat (a Google Webfont freebie) for the headlines and subheadlines.\r\n\r\nIf
  you could have a brief look at the document attached please and give me some feedback
  on: \r\n\u2022 Do they work together? \r\n\u2022 Do they work together at the chosen
  sizes?\r\n\u2022 Is the headline and subheadline numbering ok?\r\n\u2022 Is the
  table of contents design ok? \r\n\u2022 Are the line spaces before and after headlines
  ok?\r\n\u2022 Page number typeface in footer ok (Lato)?\r\n\r\nThe questions cover
  the things I can change myself about the document design. The margins, the bodytext
  spacing and the bodytext font size is fixed. \r\n\r\nThank you\r\n\r\n_____\r\n\r\nP.S.:
  Lining Figures were planned, it was a mistake in the style definition. Thank you.\r\n\r\nPSS:
  Updated Version online, just for reference, thanks again."

  body: Numerals on TOC seem odd in old-style.  Lining makes most sense to me there
    since it is not running text and it throws off the apparent alignment.

  body: I'd suggest trying it with the page numbers on the TOC centering over each
    other rather than being left-aligned in their column.

  body: Cycles is wonderful, but I find your measure too wide. The sans is a comfortable
    pair for titles.

  body: "Florian, some quick things I noticed on your layout, which, in general, looks
    good:\r\n\r\nTOC page. I don't understand the ratio of having different alignments
    (left and right). And, since the entire document is set asymetrically on left,
    why don't you try to also set (align) the table of contents on left?\r\n\r\nSans
    typeface (Montserrat). Check the spacing between the words - they are too close,
    both in headlines and subheads.\r\n\r\nPage numbers. The minus sign before and
    after the number is unnecessary, in my opinion. Just put the mere number or, if
    you need a little graphical enrichment at the bottom of the page, try to insert
    the number inside squared brackets.\r\n\r\nSubheads. They look too big to me,
    try to set them at the same size as body text - the different typeface is enough
    to differentiate them from the boxy text. Also, try to define a better way to
    insert them before and after the body text: on page 2, for example, there's the
    same space before and after \"I.2. Donec urna lectus\", while there's should be
    more space on top.\r\n\r\nThose are some suggestions; others may have different
    opinions."

  body: "Thank you very much for your detailed feedback, Nicola! I adjusted the document
    accordingly. \r\n\r\nWhen fitting the subheads to the bodytext, do you take the
    x-height of the body text as a measure or the capital heights? My intuition tells
    me x-height, although the two faces vary quite substantially in x-height. \r\n\r\nThe
    TOC is laid out so that the page numbers align, which I find quite nice. If I
    left align the layout then I would need to put the page numbers first to create
    the same effect, which is a bit off. \r\n\r\nThank you"

  body: "\"When fitting the subheads to the bodytext, do you take the x-height of
    the body text as a measure or the capital heights?\"\r\n\r\nI'd say x-height,
    althought I don't have Monserrat and can't make a straight comparison myself.
    Anyway, if the typefaces don't stand on the same line, as in your case, I guess
    that you could set the sans the same size as the serif, or adjust its size - 0,5
    or 1 pts more or less - by judging how it optically looks right to you. They look
    quite balanced in example 3, anyway.\r\n\r\nAs for the TOC alignment, I understand
    what you're saying, but I usually set indexes that way, left aligned, with page
    numbers preceding chapter titles. Anyway, have a look at this excellent article
    by John D. Berry - very useful:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.creativepro.com/article/dot-font-tables-of-contents"
