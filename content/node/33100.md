  for a masthead/logo for Street Sheet newspaper and he keeps pushing me towards this
  one. Street Sheet is a newspaper on homeless issues and is produced in San Francisco.\r\nI
  am not happy with this masthead/logo, but don't know if I can make it work at all.
  He insists that the boots reach above the box, but I feel that it makes it less
  readable. This masthead goes on the top left of the paper, on the right is a blue
  box with secondary information.\r\nAny suggestions would be very appreciated."

  body: "I always look at the image before reading the post, so I can look at it with
    fresh eyes. I saw \"STROOT SHOOT.\"\r\n\r\nIt doesn't work because the letters
    are uppercase, while the shoeprints are lowercase. Try setting it as \"street
    sheet\" or \"Street Sheet.\"\r\n\r\nI'd also think about simplifying the tread
    on the prints so the 'e's read better. There's just too much going on inside the
    blue areas for them to be instantly recognizable as 'e's.\r\n\r\nHave you thought
    about what would happen if this logo had to be printed in one colour? (My suggestion
    would be to remove the box and print the letters and shoeprints in black).\r\n\r\n

  body: "Me too.\r\n\r\nI don't like the bootprints extending outside of the black
    rectangle either. But I don't think it would look good completely inside. Have
    you tried a version without the black?\r\n\r\nI know it's been said in the forums
    before: just because your professor pushes you toward something doesn't make it
    the best design."

  body: Thanks for your comments, I totally agree with you, I'll try it without the
    box, and a simpler tread. I'll post one with lowercase that I have.
