body: "Was playing around today instead of getting ready for a pitch.\r\n\r\nCame
  up with a few type treatments, based on exisiting or heavily modified fonts -- not
  sure what to do with them, maybe tshirts? I am seriously getting tired with clip-art
  and faux naive illustration art tshirts. \r\n\r\nNeed more, solid, type treatments
  on t-shirts in the future, mayhaps?\r\n\r\nI dunno.\r\n\r\nDo tell me what you think!\r\n\r\n"

  body: Nathan are you pining for the 70s. All that crashing type and ultra tight
    spacing. I would suggest looking more closely at letter combinations and let some
    of the type breathe. Type designers design the sides of the letters too.

  body: "Thanks Dan\r\n\r\nYeah, the stuff is pretty tight. I really was going for
    a very tight, tube-socks look. But, there is a question of balance that needs
    to be addressed.\r\n\r\nI think the kerning in the 70s was so tight, partly because
    of the jeans. There was a subconsious need to keep everything 'packed in' due
    in part to the tightening in their crotches!\r\n\r\n"

    just pure wordplay?
