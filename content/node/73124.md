  for various reasons, however because of the characters involved and the slightly
  unorthodox forms that I have created it's taking me a while to decide whether I
  have got the kerning right here.\r\nI've already consulted a very good typographer
  on this already and it was given a thumbs up, but Im interested to see if anyone
  else agrees.\r\n\r\nThanks! \r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/w_808_4384.jpg]"

  body: "Due to the optical illusion which always occurs with white type on a black
    background it makes the letters look more tightly kerned on the black than the
    white. However each version looks correct to me, so unless you want to be a perfectionist
    and loosen the kerning slightly on the black background so the eye sees them the
    same, I think you have done a very nice job :)\r\nIn fact I prefer the white on
    black as the kerning looks slightly tighter, yet the word still covers the same
    length."

  body: "Hey there,\r\n\r\nthanks for your input - very helpful.\r\n\r\nThomas - The
    WIN was problematic for sure and it is looser as you say,  the space either side
    of the 'I' is challenging , but when I was balancing the entire shape and 'colour'
    of the word they somehow needed to be spaced differently - however I will try
    and look at that again.\r\n\r\ntdabner - thank you - good points, it's encouraging
    to have your approval on this.\r\n\r\n\r\nthanks\r\n808"

  body: SO looks a bit loose, specifically its top part. Similarly TE looks tighter
    than ER if one focuses on the top part. Very very marginally, perhaps due to that
    protrusion on the left of E's bar.

  body: "Yes, but the top part of TE *should* be tighter than the top part of ER,
    because of that big honking gap on the lower part of the T.\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\nT"

  body: Oh, I realize that. However the protrusion on E drives the eyes to the top
    part, which makes it arguably more visually important than the gap at the bottom.
