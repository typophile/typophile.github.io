body: Okay, this isn&#39;t really an ID request, but I was reading a book set in Plantin
  and this got me curious. Does anyone know why the numerals in the regular weight
  of Plantin don&#39;t resemble the numerals in any other weight of Plantin, but instead
  resemble the numerals of Goudy&#39;s Italian Old Style? See the picture below. &#40;This
  only seems to apply to the LF

  body: This is very interesting. I tried to find an older sample of Plantin lining
    numerals, but they don&#39;t seem to have existed. All of the metal versions of
    Plantin I found only show old style numberals. I wonder if somebody at Monotype
    took a short cut when they did the lining numerals for Regular?

  body: I just took a look at Bitstream&#39;s digitization of Plantin, <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/bitstream/aldine-721/aldine-721/testdrive.html?s=1234567890&amp;p=48">Aldine
    721</a>, and it looks like the numerals are the same style in all weights there
    &#40;including the regular&#41;. This was probably digitized separately from MT&#39;s.
    The question is, where did Plantin MT&#39;s lining numerals come from, and when
    were they designed?

  body: <i>Rookledge&#39;s International Type Finder</i> &#40;1978&#41; shows the
    correct lining numerals in the regular weight, so they must have existed in pre-digital
    versions of the face.

    Titling MT</a> whose numerals appear to be hybrids of the two different forms.
