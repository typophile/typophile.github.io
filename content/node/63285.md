body: "The topic is not strictly typographical, but there's a design matter involved
  in it. Carl Gustav Jung's \"Red Book\" - a sort of personal diary kept by the master
  during his life - has just been published, in a kind of \"facsimile\" edition which
  reproduces his calligraphy and drawings (the text is also typeset for easier reading).
  Apart from the content itself, onirical and visionary, it is the design and production
  choice which is interesting: Jung's notebook is treated like a Medieval manuscript,
  somehow. There's some previews here:\r\n\r\nhttps://philemonfoundation.org/projects/red_book/"
