body: Hi typophiles! <BR> <BR>Largely motived by the excellent feedback I got on the
  <a href="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/30/53052.html?1100995864">previous
  thread</a> in which I posted the first &#34;code escape&#34; of the Cornu-based
  curve editor, I am now releasing a second version, as a <a href="http://casper.ghostscript.com/~raph/ppedit.tar.gz">source
  tarball</a> for Unix-like systems. <BR> <BR>I believe that the segfaults reported
  by Robin Houston are now fixed &#40;the ones due to coincident points due to his
  patch, the other ones due to numerical instabilities when spirals are too close
  to perfect circles&#41;. <BR> <BR>But the main thing you&#39;ll notice are the usability
  improvements; just click on a curve to insert a knot, or press Ctrl-D to delete
  one. You can also select &#40;and move&#41; groups of points at once. Double-clicking
  a curve closes it, and Ctrl-click makes a corner point, so you don&#39;t have to
  do the click,Ctrl-T combo. <BR> <BR>As before, you need either Linux &#40;or anu
  reasonable Unix&#41; system or OSX with Fink set up for development. The main libraries
  are Gtk 1.2 and Libart-2. I will post a native OSX version soon as well. <BR> <BR>Feedback
  is always welcome. It&#39;s possible at this point that I <i>am</i> going to pursue
  making it into a real product and/or licensable technology, so don&#39;t be surprised
  if there&#39;s a period of quiet followed by some kind of announcement.

  body: Raph, just downloaded and compiled this version. Clicked around a little.
    <BR> <BR>I like the usability improvements, drag selecting and the 3 useful modes.
    <BR> <BR><i>It&#39;s possible at this point that I am going to pursue making it
    into a real product and/or licensable technology</i> <BR> <BR>I think that would
    be smart. <BR> <BR>My offer from the previous thread stands. More as I get time.

    wondering how difficult it would be.'

    at all. The answer is basically: 1000 lines of code. Ordinarily, I could toss
    that off in a weekend[&#42;], but the fact is that I have never actually written
    a Win32 GUI app before, so I have to factor in the time it takes to learn the
    platform. <BR> <BR>So my current plan is to release the OSX version first, because
    it&#39;s easier &#40;it shares roots with Linux&#41;, then tackle the Win32 port.
    I make no promises when it&#39;ll be done, but getting good feedback sure helps
    motivate me! <BR> <BR>&#42;Ok, that&#39;s bragging a bit :<a href="http://i.cantcode.com"></a>&#41;'

    I can snag a corner of her harddrive for Spiro.

  body: 'This is very nice, and I&#39;m rather disappointed that I haven&#39;t been
    able to crash it yet. Feels much more solid. The selection mode is very useful;
    I love being able to move whole curves around. Predictably enough, I enjoy being
    able to close a curve by double clicking. <BR> <BR>But enough sycophancy: what
    don&#39;t I like? The invisible global modes, of course. &#40;The Apple Human
    Interface guidelines are very sound on <a href="http://developer.apple.com/documentation/MacOSX/Conceptual/AppleSWDesign/HIDesign/chapter_3_section_2.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP30000353/TPXREF110">this
    topic</a> IMO; and even vi tells you what mode you&#39;re in these days. <IMG
    SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif" ALT=":-&#41;" BORDER=0>&#41;
    Also the &#39;corner mode&#39; is redundant; Ctrl-click in curve mode is wonderful
    and sufficient. Two global modes, together with a clear visual indication of which
    you&#39;re in &#40;like a different mouse pointer&#41; would be fine I think.
    <BR> <BR>Adding a knot to a curve behaves rather confusingly. You have to click
    near the curve, and the knot is then added at the exact point where you clicked,
    which usually causes the rest of the curve to change slightly. I think it would
    be better to add the knot as nearly as possible directly onto the existing curve
    instead. For curves that don&#39;t intersect themselves, it seems &#40;experimentally&#41;
    to be possible to add new knots in such a way that the existing curve doesn&#39;t
    perceptibly change. <BR> <BR>It would be nice to be able to use the arrow keys
    to fine-tune the placement of knots. <BR> <BR>Probably you&#39;ve already thought
    of all these things. Just throwing them out as fuel or grist. <BR> <BR>PS. Hey,
    I&#39;m a regular!'

  body: I&#39;ve also been wondering about the discontinuities in the mapping from
    points to curves. For example, the following sequence of four curves appears as
    I move the selected point gradually leftwards. <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/30/54224.gif"

    not sure whether this is a problem; or if it is, whether it has a reasonable solution.
    Would it be feasible and/or sensible to favour curves that don&#39;t intersect
    themselves?
