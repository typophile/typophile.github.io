body: HI. I am trying to modify this site and can&#39;t even find the fonts for sale,
  so thought someone might know where to purchase them or equivalents for Windows
  XP. &#40;I have the Mac fonts, supposedly, but can&#39;t seem to convert them&#41;.  <BR>1.
  At top where it says &#34;Connecting the World through LIVE INTERNET BROADCASTS
  FOR PEACE,&#34; the font is supposedly TricorneSSK.  <BR>2. Just below that, the
  menu itmes are TricorneCondSSK.  <BR>3. At the bottom / middle where it says &#34;Tom
  Kenyon - LIVE Ghandarva from Belgrade...&#34; the font is supposed to be TriplexBold.
