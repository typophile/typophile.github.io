    posts with the same request. Let\u2019s focus on this one, okay?\r\nQuantity doesn\u2019t
    help. ;-)\r\n\r\nDo you have more information on this sample? What\u2019s the
    source? Is is from an old movie? Keep in mind that it might be hand-lettered.
    You can find similar typefaces when searching for the keywords \u2018faux greek\u2019,
    or \u2018runic\u2019. I haven\u2019t seen this one, though.\r\n\r\nAnd: <a href=\"http://typophile.com/forum/typeid/faq/#Q_2\"

  body: thanks florian!! I just haven't had any activity, glad you saw my 6th post
    and decided to answer. It is from a film by the Quay Brothers called The Epic
    of Gilgamesh, or This Unnameable Little Broom (1985) aka Little Songs of the Chief
    Officer of Hunar Louse. Thanks again, I really appreciate the help!

    Knowing the year (1985) rules out a lot of options.\r\n<a href=\"http://typophile.com/forum/typeid/faq/#Q_9\">Rest
    assured we have had a look at your sample. Sometimes (though rarely) we simply
    don't have a clue. The best way to \u2018revive\u2019 your thread is to post a
    little reminder in your original thread. Please don't create a duplicate thread

  body: If this is from '85 it is pre-digital, and is probably typeset. I've never
    seen this before. You might want to check P22's website, they have a number of
    historical fonts.

  body: "I think Chris is right, but there are a few similar fonts: I found [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/jnlevine/edessa/|Edessa]],
    [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/k-type/dalek/|Dalek]] and [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/agfa/xerxes-tr/|Xerxes]].
    You may find others at gaming sites, or freebie sites like Dafont.\r\n\r\nThe
    first of these seems closest in overall feel, and relatively simple changes, like
    using a C to make the E, should get you pretty close.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

    and typography for their work. Maybe it's custom.
