  body: Bruce - PhotoMerge in the PhotShop CS3 Beta does a great job - up to this
    point I  had found PanoramaMaker to be better - but the new beta version of PhotoShop
    does a job on panos I could not get to blend smoothly before. Both it and PanoramaMaker
    are easy to use. No learning curve

  body: Bob, thank you for the suggestions. My regular pro photography dealer (right
    in Southie, I'm sure you can imagine which place I mean) recommended that I download
    the Realviz app as the most easy and intuitive, which I did a couple of days ago
    for $120. Now that I've gone for a sniff at the Arcsoft site, PanoramaMaker looks
    to have a far simpler interface and it only costs $40! So much for easy and intuitive
    . . . Unfortunately, no tryout version of PanoramaMaker for Mac. I have p*ssed
    away so much time already struggling with Realviz, I may just buy the Arcsoft
    on faith, or jump into the CS3 beta (i'm on CS2 at the moment). First I have to
    go and reshoot my panorama (I'm doing all this for a single image, of one room
    interior, to put as a quicktime vr on a client's web site) with a more accurately-placed
    nodal point and with more image overlap. Should be pretty simple to do, though.
    Thanks again for the tip.

    not impressed with it -- having used some of their clip art collections in the
    past, I wouldn't call their interfaces \"easy and intuitive\" either, despite
    what it looks like on their website....\r\n\r\nBut when I got my camera, it came
    with a built-in stitcher that works just great -- I've only done one large panorama
    with it, but the only problem with it was the creature clicking the shutter.  :-)"

    the free download of Photoshop CS3 Beta would be my Choice for good and easy -
    by the way PanoramaMaker 3 was better than the current version (4) for Mac.'

  body: "@#$%^&*@#$%^&*!!!!!!\r\n\r\nI went to the Adobe Lab site, and was poised
    to press the \"download all 685 megabytes\" button when I saw sys 10.4.8. Oh,
    bother. Never wanting to be on the bleeding edge of technology, I don't upgrade
    everything very often* and at the moment am still on 10.3.9. So no go on that
    scheme, I guess.\r\n\r\nBruce\r\n\r\n*Here's an example: Apart from easy generation
    of PDFs in Quark 6.5, for the book work I need to do I'd still be plenty happy
    with 3.32r5. The disruption of an upgrade and having to learn to navigate around
    all the new \"features\" that I don't need always causes me no end of trouble,
    plus the domino effect that once you upgrade one thing, then it forces you to
    do a bunch more in related utilities and applications. (Grrr, I must have taken
    an extra curmudgeon pill with supper.)"
