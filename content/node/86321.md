  a portuguese city, also known as the baroque capital of Portugal. Our latest typographic
  extravaganza comes with a multitude of fonts designed to work like layers, allowing
  to insert color, lines, gradients, patterns, baroque, floral swashes, and many other
  graphic elements. Starting with Braga Base, you can add any of the twenty-three
  available styles, to create colourful typographic designs. Ask our detailed PDF
  specimen, showing all the features and how to use this type system designed by Dino
  dos Santos and Pedro Leal.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBest,\r\nDino dos Santos\r\nDSType"
