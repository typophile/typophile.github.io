You should shift ogonek to the right on &quot;Aogonek&quot; and &quot;aogonek&quot;. Lc &quot;k&quot; is too wide for me. All alternative acutes (Polish kreska) on sacute, cacute, nacute, oacute and zacute have too much stepper slope, and now should go to the left. It is nice that you did an alt.acute but for me the first one, is enough for Polish language too. All accents above (not dots) are to weak (light) for me.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">You have taken on an interesting challenge of having a greater variety of treatments of individual letters, and still have the whole harmonize and balance. I think a PDF with text would help to see how well it harmonizes or fails to and contradicts itself. The few words you posted promise a nice harmony and balance. If it does harmonize it would be valuable, as you would have achieved a greater differentiation of letters, and possibily easier readability, than is usual in a sans.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I get an error message when I try to start up your PDF. 'Acrobat cannot decript this document'. Can you check it? <BR> <BR>The more I look the more intriguing this is. Overall, I think the 'inconsistencies' work harmoniously together-though I want to see that PDF!  <BR> <BR>I wonder whether the h or k or both need the b treatment for the sake of the harmony of the font. Even though they don't have a 'reflection' they could, and it might look more harmonious. The ldq would still have a visual 'reason' not to have the bend.  <BR> <BR>The only character I don't think works is the g, because unlike the rest it looks odd to me and the oddness doesn't go away. A single story g might still keep to your design rules for this font and work better.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Hey Chris, you're talking alphabet reform! A pet project of mine since '98.

		<div class="commentbody">OK, the PDF works now. <BR> <BR>Not surprisingly, this is a face that cannot be evaluated in the normal fashion - otherwise one would blindly conclude &quot;it's ugly&quot; and leave it at that. The relevance of such a design is tied to the existence of the &quot;dark half&quot; of reading, the half where a reader doesn't notice the details of the font, but is affected by it nonetheless. <BR> <BR>Evaluating such a font requires a very strong understanding of readability, and the deeper mechanisms of reading, for example to what extent familiarity matters, and what details readers notice. I don't know anybody who can do this. But I can try to share some of my own hazy insight. <BR> <BR>- I think the &quot;a&quot; needs its lower-right spur. <BR>- And the &quot;g&quot; needs its ear. <BR>- The &quot;k&quot; needs staggered arms, maybe one of them bowed. <BR>- The &quot;v&quot;/&quot;w&quot;/&quot;y&quot; are too static as a group. <BR>- I'd make the &quot;J&quot; descending. <BR>- The &quot;@&quot; is too chirographic. <BR>- I'd flatten the UC acutes/graves. <BR>- The BP is off. <BR>- That &quot;L&quot; in the Pilcrow is bril! <BR>- I don't think the Differential should lean. <BR>- The Florin should lean though. <BR> <BR>BTW, looking at the vertical proportions and color, it looks like a face that would work best at larger text sizes, like around 12 point. But for that the spacing is slightly loose. <BR> <BR>Whatever you do though, don't expect virtually anybody to understand what this is about - the Modernist age is not good at tolerating such extrapolation - it's just something you'll have to believe in, and apply in the best way you can. <BR> <BR>&ndash; <BR> <BR>&gt; If that were not so, what would we strive for? <BR> <BR>I feel the same way. But some people like to celebrate more than strive. I guess they have more fun though. <BR> <BR>&gt; some of the letterform structures you used <BR>&gt; in your GIF look very Middle Eastern <BR> <BR>It's possible - although probably based more on my own [circumstantial] background than some actual &quot;old-world&quot; merit&hellip; <BR> <BR>hhp <BR></div>

		<div class="commentbody">Hmmm. The text in the PDF for me doesn't solve the harmony problem well enough. It may be the width of the letters is the problem rather than the forms, though. I suspect that you need to narrow the stemless letters - doesn't Dax do this? And also the a seems too wide to me. The flag at the top of the b sticks out too much; its seems visually higher than the straight ascenders - would shortening it make it more harmonious?  <BR> <BR>You have quite a challenge getting even rhythm into your unconventional forms, but if you succeed you will have something unique.

		<div class="commentbody">I am attaching another PDF witth the changes I have made so far.  This time I have only included a limited character set. <BR>I have slightly condensed the font and made numerous tinkerings. <BR>There is also a couple of words in other weights.  I actually started the face as a medium weight. Even though medium is the least usefull weight, it gives me clues about all other weights. I then did a bold and a black before starting the regular. I did not show the bolder weights before because they would not work well as a text face.  I still have much work to do on them all but would like your collective feedback on what I have so far. <BR> <BR>Thanks, <BR> <BR>Chris <BR><!--attachment: Lep-secondpdf-38713.pdf*mime_pdf.gif*application/pdf*56.0*Leporello6%2e19%2e04*Lep%2dsecondpdf%2epdf --><center><table border=1><tr><td><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/icons/mime_pdf.gif" align=left alt="application/pdf">Leporello6.19.04<br><a href="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/Lep-secondpdf-38713.pdf" target="_blank"><b>Lep-secondpdf.pdf</b></a> (56.0 k)</td></tr></table></center><!--/attachment--></div>

		<div class="commentbody">I think the narrower letters and the change in the serif on the b are both good improvements.  <BR> <BR>Now I see your idea of great variation in the letters in your 'cloaked' version. It think it is too much.  <BR> <BR>There is a balance between repetition and variation in any pattern to make it work aesthetically. I have heard, I forget where, that in music it is about 50-50. If the melody doesn't have some kind of repetition it doesn't come together as a melody, but just is a series of notes. Thus you have the typical establishment of the theme in four bars, the next four bars with variation of the theme, the third four a different variation, and return to the theme.  <BR> <BR>In other words with too much variation a melody just doesn't come together as a 'gestalt' that the mind can wrap itself around. On the other hand, if there is too much repetition it becomes boring and annoying, like the infernal 'Doublemint' jingle. <BR> <BR>I think that this kind of patterning principle also holds for readability. And I think you have gone too far in the variety direction. But if you figure a way to pull back - there are a lot of ways to do it because you have so much variation - you could end up with something that is balanced and innovative.  <BR> <BR>By the way, the narrowed top of the g works now for me, where it didn't before. But I think the connecting loop to the bottom is off somehow now.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Here is yet another tinkering.  Besides many small adjustments throughout, I have mostly abandoned the 2-version concept since the difference between Plain and Cloaked was so small it made no sense to keep both.  I went back to just &quot;Regular&quot; and made the entry strokes more normal and predictable at least for now. <BR>I also added, just for fun, a few dingbats that were in keeping with the libretto of the opera.

		<div class="commentbody">I'm just working on my first typeface, so be forewarned you are not getting the voice of experience here. <BR> <BR>The thing I like most about this now are your serifs at the top of the ascenders.  <BR> <BR>My suspicion is that if the n, h, and o were slightly narrower it would make for a better rhythm in the text. <BR> <BR>I wonder whether it would be better with the l with the serif on the ascender. The bl combination is a little jarring in the text. Having the d with no serif is more 'natural' looking as the serif on the d in a serif face is sometimes different than all the other ascenders.  <BR> <BR>The bottom serif on the l - should the terminal be more similar to the ascender serifs?  <BR> <BR>The i serif. I think this needs to relate more to the ascender serif also - maybe just being shorter would work. Now, with the serif bending down, it think it should overshoot like the o; it looks short now. Also you could consider putting a stem on the r. As the Underware fellows explain <a href="http://www.typeworkshop.com/index.php?id1=type-basics&amp;id2=&amp;id3=&amp;id4=&amp;id5=&amp;idpic=17#pictloader" target="_blank">here</a> the r usually has more of a notch than the m,n. And that helps keep the rn from looking like an m. If you are going to have as serif on the i you might consider doing something on the j and r also. <BR> <BR>I don't know what can work here, but I do think that the serifs on the ascenders are a success, and working the face to make it harmonize and work best with these is the way to go.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Chris, you're not speaking to yourself - on my end I was saving the best for last. <BR> <BR>Few people can appreciate what you're doing - it's way out there - it requires a dedication to the dark depths of reading - something very rarely promoted. <BR> <BR>Know that most type designers who see this will think it's garbage (and most of them won't have the balls to tell you). Some people will think it's &quot;cute&quot;. My advice is this: filter feedback based on context: learn to ignore certain specific kinds of advice from people who might be great conventional font designers but have no real idea of the dark currents sweeping to and fro in the recesses of the human brain. Or: Don't ask a poodle trainer to handle an anaconda. <BR> <BR>&ndash; <BR> <BR>It's a good time to back up. <BR> <BR>What I think you should go for (and you might already be doing this) is a font that creates a texture (at reading point sizes) the layman won't reject, but diverge the forms as much as possible nonetheless. I think you're actually being slightly conservative! But it will make for a great test case. You will have to publish a booklet (not related to typography) that uses it, and ask laymen (NOT other designers) what they think - and ask them in the most indirect -even devious- ways - to see what's really going on. <BR> <BR>Some specifics: <BR>-Why are the caps and numerals so conventional? <BR>-I'd make the eye of the &quot;e&quot; smaller. <BR>-I'd make the &quot;s&quot; narrower and the &quot;y&quot; wider. <BR>-I think your accents are generally smallish. <BR>-Try making the blank space a hair bigger. <BR> <BR>&ndash; <BR> <BR>&gt; There is a balance between repetition and <BR>&gt; variation in any pattern to make it work <BR>&gt; aesthetically. <BR> <BR>But there's a critical difference here between display and text, between deliberative and immersive reading. The threshold of harmony/discord depends on how deep into the subconscious you're aiming. <BR> <BR>What is seen as discord by our finicky -and subjective- conscious aesthetic appreciation is used by the subconscious to read more efficiently. <BR> <BR>&gt; the infernal 'Doublemint' jingle. <BR> <BR>Tellingly in fact, a study has shown the more obnoxious a jingle the more memorable it is! What we think we like isn't necessarily what we really like. <BR> <BR>&gt; I never liked the stepped &quot;k&quot; <BR> <BR>But it's less of an &quot;x&quot;. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR></div>

		<div class="commentbody">Chris, <BR> <BR>Yes I'm a neighbor not so far away. I do think your narrowing the o helped a lot. I don't quite know how to react to the typeface as it stands. It has polish, and a much more lively texture than most san serifs, which is all to the good. But to me it also looks excentric to a point that is a bit distracting.  <BR> <BR>It may be that Hrants view is right that the way to go is just all the way with the concept, and just make it as good looking as possible with its varied shape, or maybe even more varied shapes.  <BR> <BR>Emigre has done a lot of to me excentric stuff that has found a place in the type world, so maybe that is a model.   <BR> <BR></div>

		<div class="commentbody">Actually I think this (or at least what I'm talking about) is a world apart from the Emigre school, because the &quot;eccentricity&quot; is not [purely] for aesthetic effect - it's not a form of artistic expression. In fact more than eccentricity you could call it &quot;realism&quot;: referring to the reality that laymen don't care about formal aesthetics the way [most] type designers do - they're essentially concerned with accessing the <i>content</i> instead. Crazy laymen. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR></div>

I quite like the direction this is going, but a few things bother me.  <BR> <BR>1) The difference in dots for i and j, while I appreciate it, doesn't work for me.  <BR> <BR>2) The roman feels slightly as if it's leaning left, especially at smaller sizes. <BR> <BR>3) And speaking of left, the italic K needs to bulk up on its left side. <BR> <BR>4) The italic p looks too `pinched' to me; maybe bring the join down just a hair. <BR> <BR>Overall, though, I could see using this for a couple of projects I have.

		<div class="commentbody">Chris, as I said early in the thread, I found this alphabet as having too much variation in it. Your black version has changed the bent stems effectively into serifs, which for me work much more harmoniously. My guess would be that if you worked backwards and did the lighter weights with a similar treatment, you would have a result that would be more harmonious, and have more use. Two things still stick out to me as awkward. The 'k' having the serif go the opposite way from the b and h I don't see the visual logic in. Also the arm on the r seems too heavy or droopy or something.  <BR> <BR>A lot of successful faces, I have read, have started out very 'far out', and then the designers have pulled back into a more conventional direction, until they had a more conventional alphabet, but with a distinctive flavor.  <BR> <BR>Because type design is in my view by nature a very conservative field (unlike science), I think this is the wiser way to go. But of course I am just one pair of eyes, and not professional ones at that.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">William, <BR>Thanks for your thoughts.  I actually started the lighter weights that way and found the serifs too heavy.  I will give it some more thought now that some time has gone by and I am starting to get a better understanding of FontLab.  I still think the k and h fit my earlier stated design philosophy.  It may take some getting used to for many type-savvy people.  I have gotten so used to it now that it looks quite normal.  When I show it to laymen, they don't even notice even when I point it out to them. <BR>I really do appreciate your continued willingness to share your insights.  You, Hrant, Steve, and a few others here, have been a very supportive group of sounding boards who are always kind enough to take their time to critique my work.  This helps me either focus harder on the pros and cons or shows me possible errors of my ways.  Thanks to all my colleagues here online. <BR> <BR> <BR>ChrisL</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Chris,  <BR> <BR>I'm looking at your Cyrillic. Well, it's a beginning, but you have to do a *lot* of work on it. I recommend that you take a look at ParaType's typefaces. Since your font is black, I'd recommend taking a look at:  <BR><a href="http://www.myfonts.com/url?f55ca8b86e1a8e60af8495bfc7b5dcd8" target="_blank"><a href="http://www.myfonts.com/url?f55ca8b86e1a8e60af8495bfc7b5dcd8">http://www.myfonts.com/url?f55ca8b86e1a8e60af8495bfc7b5dcd8</a></a> <BR>and <BR><a href="http://www.myfonts.com/url?7492efd8ae9cb7d464a951168297962d" target="_blank"><a href="http://www.myfonts.com/url?7492efd8ae9cb7d464a951168297962d">http://www.myfonts.com/url?7492efd8ae9cb7d464a951168297962d</a></a> <BR><a href="http://www.myfonts.com/url?ccb28769dd0f8d2a65527e8cfe0ddaa4" target="_blank"><a href="http://www.myfonts.com/url?ccb28769dd0f8d2a65527e8cfe0ddaa4">http://www.myfonts.com/url?ccb28769dd0f8d2a65527e8cfe0ddaa4</a></a> <BR> <BR>The FreeSet shows you what you can do in a Cyrillic be to compensate the overly blackness (reduce the bowl). Currently, your be looks rather weak. Your Cyrillic i is far too deeply cut-in, looks as if it will fall apart. Connect the slanted element more firmly with the stems. Remember that a Cyrillic I is nothing like a reversed Latin N. Compare:  <BR> <BR><a href="http://www.myfonts.com/url?410beb03e5667abdc04b7075b0000d28" target="_blank"><a href="http://www.myfonts.com/url?410beb03e5667abdc04b7075b0000d28">http://www.myfonts.com/url?410beb03e5667abdc04b7075b0000d28</a></a> <BR><a href="http://www.myfonts.com/url?706f3090cb966e757739c1314953a1d7" target="_blank"><a href="http://www.myfonts.com/url?706f3090cb966e757739c1314953a1d7">http://www.myfonts.com/url?706f3090cb966e757739c1314953a1d7</a></a> <BR> <BR>Your Cyrillic ka and zhe are nice, although, since your typeface includes these strange curves like on the top of the Latin k, you might try to make the Cyrillic ka and zhe more curvy, as in the Black Grotesk or Bell Gothic examples:  <BR> <BR><a href="http://www.myfonts.com/url?e352c081f46e0ea7510a8a5cdbd4f6b7" target="_blank"><a href="http://www.myfonts.com/url?e352c081f46e0ea7510a8a5cdbd4f6b7">http://www.myfonts.com/url?e352c081f46e0ea7510a8a5cdbd4f6b7</a></a> <BR><a href="http://www.myfonts.com/url?c8bc472ba1152c4d8956565982c4b237" target="_blank"><a href="http://www.myfonts.com/url?c8bc472ba1152c4d8956565982c4b237">http://www.myfonts.com/url?c8bc472ba1152c4d8956565982c4b237</a></a> <BR> <BR>Fine-tune your Cyrillic el and de &ndash; the left stem of the de should really be slightly slanted. Your lowercase Cyrillic ef is too light, and you're not showing your uppercase ef, so it's hard do say. But you definitely should do some work on that.  <BR> <BR>The curvy teeth on ce and shcha work well, but they look awfully in the de &ndash; you need to think of something better there. Remember that the teeth in de should *never* point outwards, this makes the letter look like an unskilled skater. The teeth should be either parallel, or they may point inwards &ndash; you sure need some more solid work, and ideally an expert's advice on that.  <BR> <BR>For a start, your Cyrillic is adequate though. You managed to avoid the most horrific atrocities often found in first-timers' Cyrillics.  <BR> <BR>You may want to simplify the dcaron, tcaron, lcaron &ndash; refer to the diacritics article in <a href="http://www.magtypo.cz/download/TYPO_2004_10.pdf" target="_blank"><a href="http://www.magtypo.cz/download/TYPO_2004_10.pdf">http://www.magtypo.cz/download/TYPO_2004_10.pdf</a></a> <BR> <BR>The lslash in the Black cut as shown in <a href="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/Leporello_Black-53536.pdf" target="_blank"><a href="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/Leporello_Black-53536.pdf">http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/Leporello_Black-53536.pdf</a></a> is good but the Lslash is not. The slanted element in Lslash should be flatter (i.e. slightly more towards horizontal) and the right arm should be a bit longer. But principally, the Black is very handsome.  <BR> <BR>The junction of ogonek with the basic letter in the Bold cut is too thin, but in the Black, it's very good. In other words, in the Bold, it looks as if the ogonek is disconnected from the letter in a uglyish way.  <BR> <BR>As Robert already pointed out, the slanted element in the Light cut as shown in <a href="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/Leporellolite10-29-52377.pdf" target="_blank"><a href="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/Leporellolite10-29-52377.pdf">http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/Leporellolite10-29-52377.pdf</a></a> is just too thin. Also, it lslash, the slanted element is too wide, especially to the left. On the other hand, in Lslash, the slanted element is too short to the right, and too much pointing upwards (should be flatter). Also, in the Light, it really looks as if the ogonek were not connected to the letter, which gives a strange effect. Rotate your &quot;p&quot; by 90 degree to the right and look at the connection between the bowl and the stem: it's much &quot;stronger&quot; than your connection between ogonek and &quot;a&quot;. I do appreciate your attempt to make a sort of an ink trap there, but it's just too much of an in-cut.  <BR> <BR>Finally, the figures: somehow they look like a plain rip off from Akzidenz Grotesk. They don't seem to follow the style of the letters. They're just too plain and too round <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif" ALT=":-&#41;" BORDER=0>  <BR> <BR>Best regards,  <BR>Adam</div>

		<div class="commentbody">As usual, Adam comes down hard with a ton of invaluable insight! <BR> <BR>I myself would offer this important alert: <BR>When a font is structurally &quot;pushy&quot; (not mainstream) like your Latin most certainly is, you have to be very careful about how you <i>cast</i> non-Latin extensions. Since a font is something useful and -hopefully- not just a formal exercise, the various script components of the family have to be useful <i>in the same way</i> for a user to be able to combine the components with a controllable effect. The non-Latin instances of Leporello should be equally pushy, and in the context of users of each script. This is very hard to do for a non-native&hellip; <BR> <BR>So for example when Adam writes &quot;since your typeface includes these strange curves like on the top of the Latin k, you might try to &hellip;.&quot; I immediately think: it's not just about the shape, it's more about what the shapes are supposed to be doing. <BR> <BR>hhp</div>

It is a good feeling to know how helpful the world-wide Typophile community is and willing to share their expertise. <BR>I didn't realize that the numbers were so AG-like, it was not intended&ndash;Good heavens, dare I stir the wrath of Chicago? I'll quickly unAG them :-) <BR> <BR>Hrant, <BR>Forgive my lack of confidence in pushing the non-latin letterforms.  I am the kind of designer who depends on my eyes to see forms digested from my intelect.  Since, as you said, I am a non-native and perhaps too cautious in my first venture into Cyrillic (not much had been digested in that arena).  I will have another go at it and try not to be so timid. I know I can depend on my colleagues here online to tell me when I have &quot;overpushed&quot; in my attempts :-)  Thanks again for your continuing feedback. <BR> <BR>ChrisL</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Chris,  <BR> <BR>Very good changes. The ogonek in eogonek could be a bit more to the left (some 7-10% of the glyph's width), now its placement is somewhat not harmonous with the other *ogonek glyphs. Good work on the tcaron/dcaron/lcaron. I think your macrons are too weak and a bit too narrow. The slanted element in lslash is now a bit too bold, make it just as bold as the middle element of the lowercase &quot;a&quot;. But the boldness in the uppercase Lslash is OK. Actually, in this particular typeface, you could add a little curliness to your slanted element in Lslash/lslash, just like in Martin Majoor's Seria:  <BR><a href="http://cgm.cs.mcgill.ca/%7Eluc/atypi2004-prague/516-medium.jpg" target="_blank"><a href="http://cgm.cs.mcgill.ca/%7Eluc/atypi2004-prague/516-medium.jpg">http://cgm.cs.mcgill.ca/%7Eluc/atypi2004-prague/516-medium.jpg</a></a> <BR>or in the 1928 Polish Poltawski typeface:  <BR><a href="http://www.twardoch.com/tmp/poltawskilslash.jpg" target="_blank"><a href="http://www.twardoch.com/tmp/poltawskilslash.jpg">http://www.twardoch.com/tmp/poltawskilslash.jpg</a></a> <BR>This would mean that you'd have to make the endings of the lslash slanted element not completely vertical, but having a slight slant to the left (just as much as in the lower part of the t or l). The curliness wouldn't have to be much, too, but it would add some nice native flair. However, making the slanted element straight as you made it is also fine and looks good. The figures look more comfy now.  <BR> <BR>Also, something's wrong with your &quot;y&quot;.  <BR> <BR>Best,  <BR>Adam</div>

Since I am not a Russian speaker, I was most cautious about my drawing of the Cyrillic.  I felt uneasy departing too far from what was in my limited exposure to slavic languages. I really wanted this font to be as open to language difference as possible so I felt Cyrillic was a requirement&ndash;and still do. I do want to push the Cyrillic more as you suggest.  I would like to take you up on your generous offer to send scans of Pushkin and whatever handwriting and calligraphy you can spare.

Look at the text and you'll see that every time 'de' or 'el' appears inside the word, it creates a huge gap with the previous symbol. <BR>Second: usually Russian 'e reversed' and Ukrainian 'ye' are created by taking 'es'=c and putting a dash inside to create a mirrored bottom part of e.

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Chris, I found Mathew Carter&rsquo;s critique of your typeface really interesting&ndash;it helped me too. He said of some feature&ndash;one of the bent ascenders I think&ndash;that you don&rsquo;t really notice it text size, and if you don&rsquo;t see it, then you should cut that variation. The idea I carried away that when you do some design feature, it should be done with confidence, and to make a difference. That idea of being very intentional about making a difference with a design feature gave me a better concept myself.</p>
<p>Following this up, I wonder what Leporello &lsquo;Straight&rsquo; would look like. You is so polished and extensive, and that variant might be more quickly welcomed and have strong merits of its own, along with the &lsquo;bent&rsquo; versions.</p>
<p>Just a thought.</p>

I tried that last year. If you scroll back up to my June 20, 2004 post you will see:
