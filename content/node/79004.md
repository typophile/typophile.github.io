body: "In the past year or so, I've seen this one geometric typeface pop up in (I
  think!) at least three applications, all in billboard ads or public transport ads.
  I always notice it by subconciously thinking \"what's wrong with that Futura?\"
  and then seeing that it's a different typeface entirely - square tittles, less elegant,
  tighter-spaced, very different /t/ and /e/.\r\n\r\nAny clues?\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/110202-vinterreakategoir-top-se_5150.jpg]"

  body: Hmm, no, I don't think so. Different /t/ and /e/ again. I'll keep looking
    myself too.

  body: It may be an optical illusion, but it looks to me as if the weight of the
    a one the top line doesn't match the other letters, in which case it may well
    be the love-child of a Helvetica-Futura coupling...

  body: I think this is a custom typeface based on <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/fontlist/super_families/itc_avant_garde_gothic_itc_lubalin_graph/">ITC
    Avant Garde Gothic</a> with some hints of <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/fontlist/alternatives/helvetica/">Helvetica</a>,
    just like Nick describes it.

  body: "Maybe custom, but how about this one then? It's not the same typeface as
    the one above, I think (round tittles), and it's from an entirely different company
    (Bank vs. sports retailer) but it's got the same bent /t/ and bigger-apperture
    /e/ as the previous one, while retaining the Futuraesque /a/ and general geometric
    feel.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Knapp_lana_banklan_ansok_tva_6266.png]"

    706</a>. Although the general skeleton matches, the weight distribution doesn't,
    and the "s" is quite different (more ITC Avant Garde Gothic-like).

    Not a perfect match \u2013 the a counter is not round.\r\n(<a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/fontfont/ff_schulbuch/\">FF
    Schulbuch</a> also features the tailed t and the single-storey a, but is based
    on Helvetica and consequently has horizontal terminals)"

  body: Birdy's entry could be Century Gothic, except for the 't'. Again. But, frankly,
    I have never seen anything in the Futura/AvantGarde style with a bent 't' before.
    Unless someone has drawn one as an alternate in some font of this style, I'm far
    adrift.

  body: "Alright, sorry for leading people off on a wild goose chase, I just did what
    I should have done originally - googled up who did the brand. Turns out the first
    one is indeed a custom typeface, Stadium Sans by Stockholm Design Lab:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.stockholmdesignlab.se/#/1112/projects/clients/stadium/stadium/\r\n\r\nThis
    leads me to suspect the second one is probably also custom work, it's very, very
    close to Futura in so many other details that it might merely be a variant.\r\n"

    the font on its cover page, and it is called IkanoSans-Bold, thus also custom."
