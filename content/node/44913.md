  abbreviations mean? Some I can figure out but there are some that confuses me especially
  when its the exact same font but with different abbreviations at the end of its
  name. does typophile have a glossary of these abbreviations?\r\n\r\nAnd why does
  garamond have an ITC and Adobe version? What's the reason behind that? And other
  fonts for that matter?\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nMIYU"

    technology) ... not sure on the last two.\r\n\r\nKeep looking for Garamond's,
    you will find at least three other cuts, Garamond 3, Simonici, and Stempel. Each
    foundary tends to create their own version of this revival face, with small to
    major differences. The two you mention have the greatest difference, with ITC
    having a very large x-height (ratio of lower case size to cap height). This is
    usual on most ITC faces. Adobe has a very small x-height."

    Format:</strong> <em>e.g.,</em> PS (Postscript), TT (Truetype), MM (Multiple Master),

    figures), LF (lining figures), TF (tabular figures)\r\n\r\n<strong>Character set
    or language support:</strong> <em>e.g.,</em> SC (small caps), CE (Central European),
    STD (Standard -- generally a basic character set), Pro (Professional -- generally

  body: "It is possible to have tabular lining figures. In fact, this us the usual
    case.\r\n\r\nLining figures are figures that are all the same height (sometimes
    the same height as caps, sometimes a bit shorter).\r\n\r\nThere are also old style
    (also called ranging or lowercase) figures, which have ascenders and descenders,
    similar to lowercase letters.\r\n\r\nTabular figures are figures that are all
    the same width, so that they can be used in tables of numbers and line up vertically.\r\n\r\nThere
    are also proportional figures, which have different widths for better spacing
    when used in normal non-tabular text.\r\n\r\nAny particular set of figures is
    (usually) one of these combinations: Tabular lining, proportional lining, tabular
    old style, proportional old style. There are other possible number styles.\r\n"
