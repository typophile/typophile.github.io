  mark in Adobe Garamond (not Premier Pro) smaller than the width of the period, enlighten
  me! This obviously leads to the spacing to the following character being smaller
  after an exclamation mark than after a period. Rather annoying in my book. I have
  observed the same phenomenon with Slimbach's Utopia typeface.\r\n\r\nMats\r\n"

    period advance width was set to exactly 1/4em in order to make it exactly half
    the tabular figure width of 1/2em. '
