    that it is too bold. :)\r\n\r\nNaww, I kid. Just for a bit of variety. Personally,
    I am a big fan of the thin Clan."

  body: But the LAST font was that inscribed one that was so light as well. Typophile
    should alternate between light and bold, good and evil, Jedi and Sith.

    lighting up with the Klan, er ugh, Clan, made me think about Mr. Guston and the
    smokin' drivin' Klan characters he painted. So I was thinking of the title of
    the post more than the lovely light face we now get to enjoy."
