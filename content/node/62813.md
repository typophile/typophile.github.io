    a bit wider and the 'a' is a tad different. \r\n\r\n[edit] 'doh...that's Helvetica

  body: 'Oh, and to get it, you''d buy it from a foundry like Adobe. You might get
    away with just Helvetica, which is likely installed on your system already. '

  body: "Thanks. Helvetica Light Italic is a pretty close match if not a modified
    Helvetica type. I'm still hunting for the exact font.\r\n\r\nI don't consider
    myself a typography afficiando, but I've been seeing and admiring this font on
    billboards everywhere! Distracting almost."
