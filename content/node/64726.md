  the bottom is the same font as top but a different weight. the most similar font
  i can find is the set of porsche-like \"911\" fonts from iconian. i've seen this
  image's font elsewhere in print as well, but i've forgotten where. this image was
  made from a photoshop custom shape vectorized from a scan of the actual logo. the
  R, G, S, and K seem to be the key letters for ID.\r\n\r\n<em>(solved - \"Fireye

    has a similar overall feel but it's not exact.
