body: "Hello,\r\na friend of mine is writing an article about movie title sequences.\r\nHe
  has a question concerning the famous typographic one from <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0258000/\">\u2018Panic
  Room\u2019</a>, that might best be answered by locals, or people being familiar
  with New York City.\r\n\r\nWhere exactly are the places shown in the opening credits?
  Is their sequence a logical one \u2013 like a flight through the city, along a certain
  line? Or is the camera rather randomly jumping from some location to the other?\r\n\r\nHere
  are 22 stills from the sequence, in order of appearance.\r\n\r\nThank you very much
  for your help!\r\n[Bonus points if you can correctly identify Copperplate Gothic.

    east side to financial district to times square to central park... I think they
    are just randomly showing buidlings and iconic views of new york in a purely aesthetic
    way, in order to place the typeface the way they wanted to. these credits are
    very nice by the way, they actually appear in my upcoming book at the copperplate
    chapter. and I happen to have myself a very nice and big book about opening credits,
    which was released a short time ago; i dont have the title here, but maybe your
    pal should take a look, not to do the same one.\r\n\r\ndr"

  body: "from the website of the company who did the opening sequence:\r\n\r\n\"Panic
    Room\u2019s slow moving, aerial opening title sequence features dramatic architectural
    shots above New York City. \u201CThe titles themselves are constructed and fit
    so that they appear to be real and near but not attached to building facades,\u201D
    says CafeFX artist Akira Orikasa. \u201CIt was important to light and composite
    them so that the light shining on each title matches the lighting in the scene.\u201D\r\n\r\n\u201CWe
    balanced photo-realism with readability, and to give the titles a sense of weight,
    we worked on font selection, avoided redundancy in plate selection and, especially,
    created a lighting pattern that insured that the light shining on the titles captured
    and reflected the light behind, below, and around it,\u201D Orikasa explains.
    CafeFX employed Lightwave's radiosity rendering application to capture diffused
    lighting and color from the environment, and add a \"weighty\" dimensionality
    to the titles.\r\n\r\nCamera movement in the titles was captured, in part, using
    a method called Photogrammetry. \_\"(Director) David Fincher shot background plates
    of the city, then he wanted to alter the camera motion,\u201D Orikasa explains.
    \u201CWe had to create 3D camera motion that did not exist in the real footage.
    Photogrammetry allows you to move a virtual camera freely by taking a still image--in
    this case from the architecture photo stills from a high-res Imax camera--model
    the geometry of each building in the plate to match the still, then move the camera
    around. The result is the original shot seen from a new camera angle or motion,\u201D
    he says. Some shots we created using a mixture of several pieces of film and 3D
    textured objects.\"\r\n\r\nso actually, these are not video but animated stills...
    amazing.\r\n\r\ndr"

    informative!\r\n\r\nOnce more the typophile community proved to be a fantastic
    help \u2013 even though this request was not 100% type related (apologies for
    that).\r\n\r\nHypothesis corroborated: It\u2019s pretty much a travel across Manhattan,
    as Linda said; starting in the South at the Bay, going North via City Hall, Municipal
    Building and Puck Building, then passing Times Square and St. Patrick\u2019s Cathedral,
    finally arriving at the Central Park area with Dakota and Sheep Meadow \u2013
    where the further story of \u2018Panic Room\u2019 takes place. Great!\r\n\r\nAlso
    thanks to Mark & David for the additional information. Yes, he knows about this
    book, but he can\u2019t recall its title either, right now."
