  body: Don't think it's a font as it, rather a custom(ization) of an existing typeface
    but can't identify it. That could also be the Latin counterpart of a font used
    for the Philippine language (www.newportcity.com.ph). The only letters that look
    intact to me are /P, /O and /I, rest looking customized (some angles rounded).
