body: I have found a lot of great branding/design guideline PDF manuals for companies
  like Napster,Ebay, US army etc. I can't seem to find any branding guidelines for
  magazines. Does anyone have anything of this nature? or know any good resources?
  Scribd.com is a good place to find branding guidelines and any other type of document.
  Thanks.

  body: I would guess that most magazine guidelines would be for internal use, companies
    often have to make those things public because they work with outside vendors.
