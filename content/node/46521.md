body: "First I should mention that the goal here is not in fact randomness, because
  we want a \"natural\" effect, where adjacent glyphs are not identical--which is
  what would occur occasionally with a truly random disposition of glyphs.\r\n\r\nIn
  these examples, there are four alternates of each character in the font (including
  punctuation and, importantly, the space). They are sorted in four classes, @one,
  @two, @three and @four.\r\n\r\nVersion 1.0 was provided by Thomas Phinney. This
  is the first lookup.\r\nIt sets glyphs from a sequence of classes: 1234 1234 1234,
  which then repeats.\r\n\r\nVersion 2.0 is a tweak I provided, to deal with repetitive
  five-character sequences, as in \"they do the things...\"\r\nThis is implemented
  by the second lookup.\r\nIt sets the class sequence to: 1234 1324 3142, which then
  repeats.\r\n\r\nVersion 3.0 deals with the line-break problem. (Because layout applications
  don't carry contextuality from one line to the next, starting over every line, a
  word like \"the\" at the start of a line is set with the same glyphs every time.)
  This method was suggested by John Hudson. It works backwards from the fifth character
  in the line (chosen, again, to deal primarily with the problem of \"the\"). My code
  splits possible fifth letters into seven groups, arranged to separate those that
  occur most frequently in English into different groups. The seventh group is the
  default, and not coded. It includes all accented characters, as I have not bothered
  to make truly comprehensive classes, as I did with classes one through four, which
  might include them.\r\nThis adjusts Version 2.0 by changing the first four classes
  in the sequence, depending on the fifth character in the line, to one of: 3143,
  4324, 2413, 3214, 4132, 2314 or 1432.\r\n\r\n\r\n<code>\r\nfeature calt { \r\n\r\nlookup

    never tried to achieve a total random look, but the last 2 script fonts I've worked
    on (both connecting) I've gotten close to this effect just through using a lot
    of contextual substitution with certain classes. I would see Random substitution
    being most useful where the variations are subtle and letters are not connected.
    I've been adding contextual variations of ligatures as well which seems to be
    a useful thing for handlettering style designs.\r\n\r\nStephen"

    for comic strips. They intentionally simulate hand lettering, and they often have
    alternates (usually put in easy reach as UC/LC in a caps-only font) for the purpose
    of avoiding identical letters. (But the letter I usually has an alternate where
    the presence of serifs indicates a capital letter - or, rather, a letter that
    would still have been a capital even if the text weren't in all caps.)\r\n\r\nFor
    such a face, it might be worthwhile to get more elaborate.\r\n\r\nEach letter
    might have five forms. Which form is used depends on which letter, and which form
    of that letter, preceded it. But there are two (really four) possible successors
    for each preceding letter - one picked by shifting the letter. (And if the previous
    letter was shifted, another two.)"
