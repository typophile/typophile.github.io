  body: Sorry about all the extra posts. Initially, because I included links my comment
    got flagged as spam and in attempting to get that resolved, the duplicate ones
    showed up so I edited them out to the extent I could.

    but I still can't find \"Upgrade_FEA\" on that site.\r\n\r\nHello? Anyone from
    FontLab? How do I sort this?"

  body: "In that lower right part of the OT Panel, you need to add at least this:\r\n\r\nlanguagesystem
    DFLT dflt;\r\nlanguagesystem latn dflt;\r\n\r\nAdd others if your font support
    other language systems.\r\n\r\nThis is all related to the fact that the more recent
    versions of FontLab include a more recent version of the Adobe Font Development
    Kit for OpenType (AFDKO), which requires these language systems to be declared.
    It used to be optional. \r\n\r\nAnything you type in the lower right portion of
    the OT Panel in FontLab gets inserted at the beginning of all your OT code when
    it is compiled, and that's where you put the language system declarations."
