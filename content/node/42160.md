  format) to a more up-to-date format, OpenType. I've been using TransType Pro 3 to
  convert them and it converts them fine and all but I can't get them to show up properly
  on my PC.\r\n\r\nI have many different weights and want to put them all into one
  superfamily but it only shows up two weights on my PC but fine on my Mac.\r\n\r\nI
  was hoping someone would know how to solve this problem as it is very annoying and
  I have tried whatever I can.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/fontlist_6522.jpg]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/photoshopweights_4341.jpg]"

    must be unique for each font, and you can't have more than four fonts with the
    same NameID=1(Win).\r\n\r\nThere are more complications than that, but that's
    a key starting issue in such a conversion.\r\n\r\nT"
