      font is tall.\r\nBitmap fonts seem to be very pixelated, whilst this font seems
      to be smooth and flowing."

  body: If you look at the receipt carefully (like the 7) you see it was printed with
    a pin printer so bitmaps are the basis as Nick points out - just need a finer
    bitmap and more searcjing on web for the font.
