  missing. Previously if you set the Keyboard Increment, for example to 1 inch, selected
  an object and pressed Option+Arrow Key, Illustrator would duplicate the object 1\"
  in that direction.\r\n\r\nAnyone else run into this problem?"

    had problems with shortcut keys dropping out, but rebooting always fixes it for
    me."
