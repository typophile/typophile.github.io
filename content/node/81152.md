  body: Aren't software subscriptions one of Microsoft's big failures? It's sad to
    see Adobe's leadership so bereft of vision.

  body: "The subscription model makes sense in some cases. For example, let's say
    a design firm owns enough copies of Creative Suite for all their regular employees,
    but during occasional busy periods they need more copies for freelancers they
    bring in temporarily. Renting software for a few months would be cheaper than
    buying it.\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Christopher, here's Adobe's description:\r\nhttp://www.adobe.com/products/creativesuite/cssubscription.html\r\n\r\nLet's
    say you need Photoshop and don't qualify for an upgrade discount. If you bought
    it from Amazon it would cost roughly $650, but if instead you rented it from Adobe
    it would cost $49 a month (or $35 a month if you committed to subscribing for
    a year).\r\n\r\nI think the subscription model is mainly for people who can't
    get the upgrade discount, or who just need an app for a short period of time.\r\n\r\n"

    upgrade discount, or who just need an app for a short period of time.</em>\r\n\r\nNah...it's
    just a concession to the way we have come to expect things to work.  The current
    trend in merchandising is for the merchant constantly to have his hand in your
    pocket. SUPER DEAL! Get a smartphone for only $49.00, which is super only until
    you realize that you have to commit to spending around $1,500 on service to get
    the deal, or pay a hefty $325 termination fee if you back out early.\r\n\r\nOn
    a more positive note, the subscription model means that your software is always
    up-to-the-minute: bug fixes, enhancements and upgrades are part of the deal. Of
    course, there is a downside: if the later version replaces a feature you REALLY
    liked in a previous version with one you don't like, you're kinda stuck with \"progress\"..."

  body: "Cloud computing is not a financial model, merely a means of distribution.\r\n\r\nFor
    comparison, consider \"@fontface\": this is a cloudish means of software access,
    but may be licensed in varying ways \u2014 as a one-time payment or rental.\r\n\r\nThe
    subscription model is a bit of a stretch if it doesn't include periodical updates,
    making it suitable for companies like Adobe, which has established the practice
    of frequently updated (albeit bloated) products, for which customers have become
    accustomed to paying regular upgrade fees.\r\n\r\nIt's slightly different with
    fonts, as versioning does not sit so comfortably. A foundry would have to be extremely
    well managed in order to offer a subscription service that provided customers
    with its version of the latest font styles, annually. But I can imagine that in
    future as a viable business model.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    want to use an older version for a client or printer who requests it. For example,
    one of my corporate clients asks me to use the previous version of Creative Suite
    for their projects because that's what their in-house art department still uses.\r\n\r\nIf
    you own the software it's no problem to keep older versions on hand. (I have CS5,
    CS4, and CS3 on my Mac). But if you subscribe, you can't do that."

    geared to service providers than software licensors."
