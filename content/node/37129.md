body: Can anyone suggest a good text book for typographically designing/setting stationary
  (business cards, letterheads and documents etc)? Something like James Felici's Complete
  Typography book would be great, i.e. precise, mostly textual, detailed and informative.

  body: I haven't read it, but I was just reading <em>about</em> Jan Tschichold's
    [[http://www.amazon.com/New-Typography-Weimar-Now-Criticism/dp/0520250125/ref=pd_bbs_1/105-8790810-2567619?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1189821105&sr=8-1|The
    New Typography]], which apparently deals with such things in detail as part of
    his views on type. But if you're not into functionalist, asymmetrical design,
    it's likely not for you.

  body: "I blogged some on Tschichold\u2019s <i>Die neue Typographie,</i> primarily
    <a href=\"http://tianodesign.com/blog/?p=14\"> <b>here</b></a> and <a href=\"http://tianodesign.com/blog/?p=15\">
    <b>here.</b></a> I think there also may be a place or two somewhere on Typophile
    that I mentioned some stuff on <i>The New Typography.</i> Essentially, I had difficulty\u2014if
    not with what Tschichold wrote, then\u2014the way it is sometimes implemented.
    Also worth noting is that he renounced some things from that book later on. I\u2019m
    told that a better book of his to read is <i>The Form of the Book.</i> But, as
    it\u2019s a series of essays and not all of them are written by Tschichold, I
    can\u2019t say for myself yet. I\u2019m hoping to make it a birthday or Christmas
    gift to myself, since it appears to be a bit price, over $62 on Amazon.\r\n\r\nBut
    them\u2019s some of my thoughts. "

  body: "<em>The New Typography</em> is not especially helpful when it comes to stationary.
    The stationary section is dominated by promotion of the DIN letterhead standards.
    Business cards get only a tiny section because they were just breaking away from
    simple calling cards at the time, and what\u2019s there is pretty rudimentary
    modernist stuff. There have been a few good books about business card and stationary
    design in the last few years, I would recommend just flipping through them to
    see which of those designs still hold up after a few years."
