  body: "I think at first glance it almost looks arabic..\r\n(not automatically a
    bad thing)\r\n\r\nthe \"a\" reads like an \"E\" to me\r\nplus i'd say make the
    x height higher so the x height can be the same overall\r\n\r\nit seems like it's
    grid based but in the lose parts (i,d,r,a/E) it doesn't follow the grid\r\n\r\n\r\n[Marvin]"
