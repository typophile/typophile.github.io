body: "Hello everyone, have used this resource before, and now I'm hoping someone
  can help me with this!  What is the font for the text (not the word \"Vogue\") on
  the Vogue covers below?  Every time I think I've identified it, I notice the \"a\"
  looks different. (Even if it's custom for Vogue, the \"closest match\" would be
  great.) Thanks so much!\r\n\r\nhttp://www.mariasphoto.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/02/beauty-and-the-beast-vogue-cover.jpg\r\n\r\nhttp://www.bagnewsnotes.com/files/bagnews/images/LeBron-Vogue-Cover.jpg"
