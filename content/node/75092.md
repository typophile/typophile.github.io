  and its advantages. ("You can bookmark a page with a dog-ear" was one of the jokes.)
  I cannot find the thread, in which the link to the video was posted. Please help.

  body: "@ Nina\r\n\r\nI think, the video <em>Medieval helpdesk</em> is propaganda
    for ebooks. The message is, that it is normal, that there are always stupid people
    who have doubts about new technologies, but later it is even for them absolute
    normal to use it. Do you want to be a DAU or do you want to be approachable to
    new technologies? That\u2019s the message. In contradiction to that the other
    video points out, that humans have a tendency to forget about the comfort, that
    they already have, only because there is something new on the market."
