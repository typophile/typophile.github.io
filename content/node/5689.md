  body: Is this on a playground sign? I was not here for the original critique. How
    do the top two .org&#39;s fit in? <BR> <BR>I like the middle right decal. You
    could put the child from the bottom right in the middle right version. <BR>  <BR>I
    prefer the dark green in the decal.  <BR> <BR>Too many kids on the letters. Can
    you pick one or two letters? It is a lot to look at. The trees are also distracting.
    I would limit their use also.  <BR> <BR>The renderings are jagged. I&#39;d output
    them better. <BR> <BR> <BR>Andrew <BR>

  body: i was not here for the original posting either, so i am not quite sure what
    this is for, etc. <BR> <BR>I agree with Andrew&#39;s comments. In my opinnion,
    the middle one on the right is the only one that is a strong mark. The other ones
    need a lot of simplification and in general look unprofessional.

  body: If it&#39;s to solicit money, I think perhaps you need something a bit more
    formal/refined. A more abstract mark. Then back up the mark with plenty of photos
    of happy children in the rest of the marketing materials.

  body: Formal/refined...for a playground?  Yes, one of the primary uses will be to
    solicit funds, but how do you make the leap to formal?

  body: i don&#39;t know if formal is the right word -- professional and refined might
    be a better way to explain the direction you should take. for example, <a href="http://www.thechildrenshospital.org/index.cfm"
    target="_blank">http://www.thechildrenshospital.org/index.cfm</a> . . . The Children&#39;s
    Hospital logo is playful, yet professional.

  body: What I would guess Darrel is alluding to, is that you are not trying to attract
    children &#40;playful&#41;, you are trying to appeal to financial contributors
    &#40;formal/professional&#41;. Whenever I contribute money to a cause &#40;other
    than buying candybars from my neighbors children&#41;, I need to feel confident
    that the money is going to an organization that knows money and how to use it.
    This almost calls for a banklike look. <BR> <BR>Represent children/playgrounds,
    yes, but the purpose of this mark seems to be to promote contribution. Consider
    stability, professionalism, generocity and community first, then take a stab at
    the children/playgrounds. <BR> <BR>Technically, these marks look like very rough
    computer generated illustrations. Is that intentional? It doesn&#39;t seem appropriate
    IMO. <BR> <BR>Aloha! <BR>Scott

  body: For starters, the success of a business is not a derivative of a great logo.
    I have seen many businesses with excellent visual identities fail; likewise, I
    have seen businesses with substandard identities succeed. Frankly, I highly doubt
    that Kaboom&#39;s logo is what has driven their success, it looks to me like a
    mediocre concept that is poorly executed. The tag line, however, is excellent,
    which leads me to believe that there might be some very talented marketing heads
    behind this success. <BR> <BR>Having said everything I&#39;ve said, I have never
    had a project like this, thus, I&#39;ve never done sufficient research; therefore,
    I may be speaking completely out of ignorance to how these foundations run. <BR>

  body: Well Kaboom is a sound and a visual explosion.  <BR> <BR>I dont really like
    their logo personally. It&#39;s very generic. But kids could care less about the
    formal aspects of logos. <BR> <BR>I think it all depends on your audience, which
    I know nothing of. I was critiquing your logo on ways to improve it really. It&#39;s
    in a roughstage right now i think.  <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR>Andrew

  body: '&#34;Formal/refined...for a playground? Yes, one of the primary uses will
    be to solicit funds, but how do you make the leap to formal?&#34; <BR> <BR>Because
    you&#39;re asking for money. The first marks appeared to be targetted at kids.
    I assume you&#39;re asking money from adults. Perhaps &#39;formal&#39; was the
    wrong term...maybe more &#39;adult&#39; is what I&#39;m going for. <BR> <BR>It
    can still be &#40;and probably should be&#41; fun, but it shouldn&#39;t be childish.
    <BR> <BR>Now that I&#39;ve read the rest of the threads, I see others have said
    that better than I had. ;o&#41; <BR> <BR>&#34; Why does their logo work so well?&#34;
    <BR> <BR>I don&#39;t think it does. It&#39;s fairly generic. The name is interesting,
    but, again, kind of vague. A good logo isn&#39;t always necessary if they have
    a good product, of course. <BR> <BR>Anyways, think &#39;fundraiser&#39; more than
    &#39;playground&#39;. It&#39;s first and foremost a fundraiser FOR a playground.
    <BR> <BR>&#34;What about the simplicity here: &#34; <BR> <BR>That&#39;s better,
    but still much more of an illustration than a logo. You need to distill that down
    much more. Consider sun, slide, flower. Try and combine those in more abstract/simplified
    forms. <BR> <BR>Also, you don&#39;t need to use kids handwriting. Too obvious.
    ;o&#41; <BR> <BR>Finally, consider concepts like &#39;growth&#39;, &#39;nurture&#39;,
    &#39;empower&#39;, etc. <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR>'

    used for the fundraising aspect of the project, or will it also carry on -perhaps
    as signage on the finished playground? If the later, I&#39;d like to see you incorporate
    some for the playfulness of your earlier designs with this recent go-a-round.
    Maybe it&#39;s something as simple as the fern looking like it was drawn by a
    child using finger paints. Or maybe instead of a fern the icon could be a swing
    &#40;or other such item&#41; What is most important for this project &#34;Fernbank&#34;
