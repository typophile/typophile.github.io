    but I love to hear your thoughts on the freemium business model compared to how
    most other type designers sell. Do you think it pays of economically? You obiously
    draw lovely typefaces, which is the main reason why people want them, but as far
    as I can tell you also get a lot of free attention from various free font blogs
    and general word of mouth. (I recently told a friend he should seriously consider
    investing in Museo instead of using those lousy things he got of dafont, and had
    it been Gotham I suggested, the price tag would have been a rapid turn off.)"

  body: "Thank you very much, Stephen!\r\n\r\n@ Frode \u2014 I didn't got into this
    freemium business model deliberate. It has evolved in a very logical way from
    giving my fonts away for free and It hasn't crossed my mind still to do it any
    other way. For me it pays off, but that doesn't depent on giving fonts away only.
    To sell (enough) fonts more things are of course important and it is imho always
    a combination of how well-known you are, how you market your fonts, the likability
    of your typefaces and the price you ask for your fonts."
