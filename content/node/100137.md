body: "Hello, everyone\u2014\r\n\r\nI'm happy to announce now that Walleye, the culmination
  of over two years of (often intense) effort, is finally finished and available to
  buy! You can find it at [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/looseleaf-fonts/walleye/|MyFonts]]
  or [[http://marketplace.veer.com/font/Walleye-Volume-CTT0000654|Veer]].\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/WalleyePoster1_6006.png]\r\n\r\nI've
  put everything into this font that I thought I could legitimately make. Walleye
  supports the Latin, Cyrillic, and polytonic Greek alphabets, and includes a full
  complement of small caps for each of them. Combined, these alphabets support nearly
  all languages of Europe, as well as many from outside it, such as Mongolian and
  Lushootseed. Besides standard ligatures, there are <strong>special forms</strong>
  to prevent (or gracefully manage) collisions between pairs like <code>f\u201D</code>,
  <code>(j</code>, and <code>gj</code>. There are all the <strong>local features</strong>
  (such as for Romanian) that are needed for graceful display of sometimes neglected
  languages. Walleye also has case variants for punctuation.\r\n\r\n<strong>Numerals</strong>
  are also full-featured: both lining and old-style figures are available in monowidth
  and proportional variants, and super- and subscripts and on-the-fly fractions are
  available.\r\n\r\nIn <strong>Cyrillic,</strong> there are alternate forms for the
  preferred Serbian shapes of letters. The <strong>Greek</strong> is worth a bit of
  special attention. It has enough different display options to satisfy even a demanding
  classicist. And moreover, the design of the letters is a unique contemporary take
  on the old-fashioned calligraphic style of Greek fonts that was used everywhere
  until (often ugly) Latinized, \"modern\" alphabets began getting popular around
  the beginning of computer typesetting.\r\n\r\nI also think, and I hope you do too,
  that the <strong>design</strong> itself is no boring slouch. It's a friendly and
  entirely original design that doesn't try to fit in with any particular historical
  predecessors; it gets a lot of its character through luxuriously long scroll-shaped
  terminals and faceted shaping of round bowls. I've also made an effort to unclutter
  the design for easy reading by simplifying shapes like <code>a</code>, <code>k</code>,
  and <code>s</code> that would otherwise be crowded with serifs or finials.\r\n\r\nCheck
  it out\u2014and I hope you enjoy it!"

  body: "Congrats! Good to see this released.\r\nI really appreciate the originality
    of this. I especially like the roman /b/s, italic /k/s, all the /c/s, and italic
    /Vv/ through /Zz/. \r\nI find the spacing and color of the regular weights more
    satisfying than the bold. \r\nGood luck with it!"

    for it ;)\r\nI agree with Craig, the bold italic especially looks too loosely
    spaced, but maybe it looks better at text sizes. Overall, it's very nice. Good
    luck with it!"

  body: "Thanks, guys! And Dave, thanks for the tip on tags. I'm new using MyFonts\u2014it's
    my first font with them. \r\n\r\nSorry the bold weights aren't pleasing everyone.
    I believe I did my best, but I suppose since bolds are farther afield from my
    original inspirations, maybe they lose something in traveling into the new weight
    bracket. But I'm glad to hear that the regular weights are striking a chord. (I
    never thought of the /b/ as being particularly remarkable, but maybe I wasn't
    giving it enough credit!)"
