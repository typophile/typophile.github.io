  an eclectic selection. I Want something inspired by Victorian, Edwardian, Eclecticism,
  Art Noveau, Bahaus, Art Deco, Baroque era but made relevant to modern living.So
  I want it not to0 heavy, but a certain lightness to it, cleaner and strong recall.
  Any suggestions?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Yeah, you're probably going to need something with clashing styles, like
    an ornate font treated in a modern style, or a clean sans with ornaments applied.\r\n\r\nI
    agree with Toby. You're trying to say everything just a little instead of one
    or two things loud and clear. Refine, refine, refine."

    take a look in a foundry website, make a search by style and you''ll get lots

  body: "hmmmm, more eclecticism:\r\n<a href=\"http://www.p22.com/ihof/stgschrift.html\">P22
    St. G. Shrift</a>. The second font is a clean grotesque and you can use the first
    to add a bit more funkiness to the mix. It's clean, modern and with a few of the
    crazier characters thrown in it could definately reference some of the styles
    you listed above."

  body: "There is no use speculating on an appropriate treatment unless we have more
    to work with.\r\n\r\nSelecting a face (or a combination of faces) depends a LOT
    on the characters to be represented. By knowing which letters to compose, we have
    opportunities to suggest specific designs with unique standard, swash or alternate
    characters.\r\n\r\nIf, for example, the store were called \"L'Antique\" or \"Empire
    Boutique\" it would not be as difficult to suggest treatments.\r\nAlso, if you
    intend to use an additional tag line or have a graphic to be integrated they should
    all be worked on together.\r\n<em>N'est pas?</em>"
