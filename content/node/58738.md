  am not familiar with this word (and I'm not afraid to admit it :P), should I set
  it in italics or has it been Englishified enough to where I don't have to?\r\n\r\nex.
  vis a vis, voila\r\n\r\nmuch obliged!\r\nRachel"

  body: "thanks for the quick reply!\r\n\r\nFor future reference, outside of asking
    someone, how is this distinguished?\r\n\r\nIs it the mere fact that it's listed
    in the OED?  Because foreign words are listed in English dictionaries...\r\n\r\nOr,
    is the fact that it is of mixed origin, rather than just \"French\" as my dictionary
    lists for voila?"

  body: "English dictionaries mark words still considered foreign with something that
    specifically says \"foreign\". Look in the pronunciation guide to see if there
    is a symbol for it; usually it's a double dagger.\r\n\r\nThere is a certain amount
    of personal preference as to whether a term has been fully assimilated into English.
    For instance, my 1984 Webster's New World Dictionary marks \"voil\xE0\" as foreign
    but not \"raison d'etre\", and your dictionary may differ. Going by the origin
    alone is not enough if you don't know the word, as then you could end up italicizing
    such English words as \"inaugural\"."

    decide yourself what to set in italic?"
