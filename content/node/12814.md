  to you all: Am I crazy/silly/naive for loving this font? ITC Bookman is one of my
  favourite fonts to look at. I think the italics are great. I also LOVE the old swashes.
  \r\n\r\nHowever, in my 2+ years as a graphic design student, I've never really found
  a situation that screamed for Bookman as the solution. What do you all think it
  best suited for? \r\n\r\nI'm too young to remember the 60's and 70's which, from
  what I can gather, was the hayday for fonts like this. What was it used for back
  then?  Would any current use of the font automatically be deemed 'retro'? \r\n\r\nAnd
  since we're on the subject I thought I'd ask one more question: Are there any script
  fonts that have the Bookman feel to them? \r\n\r\nCheers!"

  body: One thought is the huge explosion of typographic tshirts that obliquely harken
    back to the beach culture of the 70s. It will be interesting to see if it surfaces
    in some form in the movie, <a href="http://www.sonypictures.com/movies/lordsofdogtown/">Lords
    of Dogtown</a>. Very unfortunate that they used Trajan. :^(
