  Gothic (or some other early 20th century sans used for text). I don't want a \"grunge\"
  font, just some softness/roundness in the edges. \r\n\r\nAny suggestions?"

  body: One of my all-time favourites, [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/cubanica/marquee/|Cubanica
    Marquee]] might be a fine choice. It not only gives you a certain roundness, but
    also some funny kerning issues, that give it more naive vernacular look. But it
    looks like a Latin-American sign, not early 20th century European type...

  body: "Metallophile is a very good suggestion. I wish it was more like News Gothic
    and not Futura, but it's definitely a choice.\r\n\r\nBeo Sans doesn't quit seem
    to fit the period (?)\r\n\r\nTelephoto is a bit too clean, the effect will wanish
    in smaller point sizes.\r\n\r\nCubanica Marquee is a nice alternative too.\r\n\r\nChristian,
    yes I have thought about similiar methods too, but I need lots of text and that
    method would be too slow and painful.\r\n"
