body: "Just a quirky typography tale and conundrum.\r\n\r\nThe Eurovision Song Contest
  is easily the biggest televisual event of the year in Sweden. The national selection
  for what song will get to go stretches out over six weeks, with over a third of
  the population seeing each qualification round and almost half the final. It's an
  enormous production on a mastodon scale, with artists, dancers, choreographers,
  set designers and TV producers spending months trying out everything to perfection.\r\n\r\nWhich
  is why I was so surprised when one of the performances switched typefaces in less
  than 24 hours.\r\n\r\nEric Saade is hotly tipped to win the Swedish selection. On
  Thursday, he entered the first rehearsal for his qualification round, performing
  the song \"Popular\". He's the young kids' choice and has an amazing crew of dancers.\r\n\r\nOn
  the big plasma screens behind him that form the main part of the set the word \"POP\"
  flashed in and out repeatedly. I saw clips from it at a preview show and was startled
  because the text was in... Hobo. :|\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/1-saade-2-002_6690.jpg]\r\n\r\nBut:
  at the dress rehearsal 24 hours later the Hobo was gone, replaced by an ultrabold
  condensed sans and giving off an entirely different impression:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/8-saade-004_5693.jpg]\r\n\r\nI
  wonder what made them change, that quickly and that late in the production cycle?\r\n\r\n"

    production haven't changed much since I worked in commercial television over thirty
    years ago (although the tools are entirely different). Graphics which will appear
    live during a production are usually among the last things done, since the turnaround
    time is relatively brief and rehearsal is rarely required to insert them properly.\r\n\r\nIn
    this instance, it appears that POP in Hobo is merely a placeholder, just plopped
    in; the final presentation appears to have been designed..."
