  Any suggestions? perhaps Garamond, Minion, Jenson (just throwin' some names out
  there) Thanx in advance\r\n\r\nIM"

    other options. \r\n\r\nThere are many serifs that will play just fine with Freight
    Sans, so let's narrow it down a bit. Can you explain why you won't be using Freight
    Text? Are you limited to your current font collection or looking for something
    new? Tell us more about your subject matter and audience."

  body: "<em>Are you limited to your current font collection or looking for something
    new?</em>\r\n\r\nI'll be purchasing Freight Sans soon and can only afford to buy
    one font family at a time(I thought buying Freight sans first would give me more
    mileage as far as use, ranging from print to signage buying the text first might
    limit me in terms of stylistic use). I will be purchasing Freight text later on.
    Also I don't wan't to limit myself to just using Freight text with sans.  I want
    to to expand my possibilities and I'm not really good with font combos (also Minion
    is available).\r\n\r\n<em>Tell us more about your subject matter and audience.</em>\r\n\r\nI'm
    designing a new logo for a property manager and I think that Freight Sans has
    the right personality and seriousness that the logo needs to convey. The name
    is Burns Glover Property Management. I also chose Freight Sans in anticipation
    of other applications such as signage of various sizes and newspaper ads."

    agree I like the look and the price is not bad either. I'll have to think about
    this one. How many CPU's?"

    for the use of the font software on 6 Devices at the same location.\r\n\r\nFYI.
    Tarocco is just recently expanded into a OTF family which now carry (redrawn)
    old style figures for all 7 weights. Also alternates have been added along with
    a set of ornaments. It will be released with Psy/Ops soon, but already available
    upon request.\r\n\r\n/SH"
