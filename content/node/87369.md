body: "<p>I have two projects right now that call for a solid Arabic font, and am
  having trouble finding a solution. It may be two separate fonts or one that does
  it all. </p>\r\n\r\n<strong>DESCRIPTION OF PROJECTS</strong>\r\n<ol>\r\n\t<li>The
  first project is a series of religious brochures that are text-heavy. <br />\r\n\t\tThe
  logo for this project is in decorative Thuluth calligraphy.</li>\r\n\t<li>The second
  is a series of Nasheed-like videos that will display Arabic text during the audio
  narration. <br />\r\n\t\tThe logo for this project is in the Ruq'a script.</li>
  </ol>\r\n\r\n<strong>TYPOGRAPHIC MATCHMAKING v.s. Traditional</strong>\r\nI don't
  want to create a big brouhaha here. I'm just open to either approach. My main concerns
  are:\r\n<ol><li>Readability<br />\r\n\tPrint project needs to be easy on the eyes
  at small sizes.<br />\r\n\tVideo project needs to be easy to read on screen.</li>\r\n<li>Traditional
  <br />\r\n\tBoth fonts need to harmonize with traditional Islamic or religious content.
  But it must appeal to progressive thinkers too, so going outside the constraints
  of old-school traditionalism is fine.</li>\r\n<li>Affordability</li></ol>\r\n<p>All
  of the Matchmaking fonts I have seen so far don't seem to fit as they appear too
  modern. But I love how matchmaking includes the Latin counterpart.</p>\r\n\r\n<strong>TASMEEM?</strong>\r\nI
  have an old copy of Tasmeem and only have the Emiri font. To me, this font, while
  beautiful, seems a little difficult to read at small sizes. Correct me if I'm wrong.
  At this point, the projects cannot justify the expense of upgrading Tasmeem and
  InDesign. \r\n\r\n<strong>MULTIPLE WEIGHTS</strong>\r\n<p>Both projects need the
  ability to have multiple weights. There needs to be a medium, light, bold, etc.
  I would prefer to find a family that has at least four weights. If there are strong
  opinions against doing multiple weights with Arabic, please explain your opinion.
  I'm open.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And perhaps I need to get a couple different fonts\u2026one
  for body copy and one for titles and headings.</p> \r\n\r\n<strong>SERIF/SANS SERIF</strong>\r\n<p>I
  would assume this font needs to have serifs. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>So far, I have only
  considered:\r\nhttp://www.rosettatype.com/Nassim\r\nIt seems to fit some of these
  constrains, but to me it appears more editorial than traditional.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>Looking
  forward to your recommendations, wisdom, advice, and of course, bulbs and flowers.</p>\r\n<p>\u2013paul</p>"

    of our colleague Sultan Maqtari : http://sultanfonts.com/\r\n\r\nHe has already
    some fonts that can fit perfectly/easily with your request and he is, as I said,
    in Yemen!\r\n\r\nPlease do not hesitate to contact us if you need any further
    request.\r\n\r\nOussama"

  body: "Hi Oussama\u2013\r\n\r\nThank you for the feedback. Yikes! I didn't realize
    my profile still said I live in Yemen. After leaving Yemen, I lived in Jordan,
    Lebanon and Syria for awhile. And I just returned to the US where I live in Portland.
    So thanks for the reminder to update the profile.\r\n\r\nSadly I never met Sultan
    Maqtari while in Yemen. But thanks for the link. I would like to support him too.
    I'm just a little confused. Are the fonts free or licensed? I can't seem to find
    a download/purchase/trial link. \r\n\r\nWhile many of his fonts don't seem to
    fit my current projects, I would like to play with Ausan. \r\n\r\nsalaam\u2013\r\npaul"

    to see his font Ausan in a text please send me the text to aratypo [at] gmaildotcom.
    I will send it back to you as a pdf. I will send you also Sultan's e-mail.\r\n\r\nSalam\r\n\r\nOussama"

  body: "Thanks for the suggestions Bahman. Adobe Arabic is too modern and as I mentioned,
    I need the additional weights.\r\n\r\nThe best I've found so far is KFGQPC Uthman
    Taha Naskh with comes in two weights.\r\n[KFGQPC= King Fahd Glorious Quran Printing
    Complex]\r\n\r\nOussama, I received an email and replied but never heard back.
    I can't find it now, but it was from Mr. Sultan.\r\n\r\n"
