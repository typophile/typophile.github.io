body: "Hello (Your name here)\r\n\r\n\r\nGeneral scope of project; \r\nThe project
  I\u2019m working on is selling. Which is done through the notion of a vending machine.
  \r\nThere are two products being sold 1. The font/typeface 2. Product packaging\r\n\r\nMy
  first solution to approach this concept, is to have a vending machine that stores
  Discs, where fonts/typefaces were sold on \u201Cfloppy disks\u201D by such foundries
  as FontShop during the late 80s to early 90s.  However with previous talks with
  my lecturer Discs have become very obsolete in this day of age.\r\n\r\nThe approach
  is finding another way of storing theses fonts, is to make a Font USB stick. Allowing
  you to store the font and still have future use by the consumer. \r\n\r\nThe vending
  machine which stores theses fonts will be sold in shops such as Magma bookstore
  where people with good income would buy fonts as Magma being a store to sell design
  books.  \r\n\r\nFonts and Typefaces are sold today online by via payable methods.\r\nThrough
  some research on Typohile.com font foundries that are selling fonts are have new
  ways of giving customers fonts without files like OTF TTF due to illegal font sharing\u2026
  This has put some designers off from buying fonts online. This is were the idea
  of selling fonts in shops can allow more designers purchase fonts over the counter
  by cash or card.  \r\n\r\n*Please note;\r\nThe vending machine is more of an installation
  to create its awareness and done at a gallery on limited days of the year or at
  typography exhibitions.    \r\n\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1)
  Do you think more people would interested in buying a font in the shops? rather
  then online?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2) Who are your target audience? And the age group of
  people buying fonts on your website?\r\n\r\n\r\n3) If there was a product that stored
  your fonts like \u2018Type USB stick\u2019 and can sold by your website and online
  - would you be interested in investing in that product?(example a fontfoundry USB)\r\n\r\n\r\n4)
  What illegal ways do have on cracking down on font sharing? As I know most font
  foundries are programming fonts to certain amount of computers and some needing
  licensing. \r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/type-usb-layout2web_4799.jpg][img:sites/default/files/old-images/woodtype-usb-layout-web_4686.jpg]"

  body: "All attempts at copy protection or other digital rights management with fonts
    have met not only with customer resistance, but with technical hurdles sufficient
    to make the product unusable. \r\n\r\nA market exists for font sales in stores
    on physical media, but those tend to be home and general office users, not designers.\r\n\r\nI
    do believe there is a market for designer novelty USB memory units. Memory devices
    in the shape of cartoon characters are already widespread, so I see no reason
    why other designs wouldn't be accepted as well. \r\n\r\nDemand for your product
    may not be sufficient for a dedicated single-product vending machine, but they
    may fit well along side other high-end devices in machines such as those in airports
    and hotels that sell iPods and such. \r\n\r\n\r\nThe above are all anecdotal assertions.
    The experience of others may vary and objective data may not bear them out."

  body: "I've always liked the idea of one-shot retail fonts. As a kid, I'd drool
    over the Letraset/DecaDry/Mecanorma dry transfer sheets. I'd occaisonally buy
    one even tho I had no real use for it. Rather than delivering the fonts on physical
    media, the font could be delivered thru a unique URL inside the package. Nothing
    fancy, just a folded card glued shut. The outside of the package could be a sort
    of album cover, like the square flags on MyFonts perhaps with a specimen on the
    flip side. That way the buyer isn't saddled with another undersized USB stick
    in the back of a desk drawer.\r\n\r\nA great advantage of selling fonts this way
    is that it opens the doors to a whole new group of font users. Font enjoyers who
    lack the knowhow to pirate fonts othe web can simply shoplift them the old-fashioned
    way. Everybody wins!"

  body: "Thank you Cuttlefish & Typodermic, for those great insights.\r\n\r\nCuttlefish:
    I know I couldn't store the physical font or typeface on the USB due to the 'EULA'
    - However I could have a code that allows the buyer to download the font or typeface
    from the type foundries.\r\n\r\nTypodermic: I did come up the CD packaging for
    fonts, which the packging for CD covers would look like the food packets you get
    in a vending machine(see attached 'Mock-Up.jpg') That idea changed with one to
    one crits with my lecturer. The reason I went for USB sticks is, they can have
    this use of being re-used over and over again by the buyer. My idea of selling
    them could be done limited edition at a typography exhibition. That way its being
    sold to my market who are at that respectable age, of not going into the shop
    to five finger discount.  \r\n\r\n"

  body: "The download codes could be unique and a limited run. Even if it's on a USB
    stick, someone can backup the font and ditch the stick.\r\n\r\nCheck out the old
    Letraset, Deca-Dry packages or some of other 1/4 page dry transfer lettering.
    The kind that hangs on a display peg instead of lays flat in a drawer. The alphabet
    was always visible through the cellophane. I used to look at my collection of
    dry transfer lettering sheets and think, \"what can I put these on?\". Those weren't
    fonts that I bought, they were packages of letters."

  body: "Firstly, I think that this is an interesting idea in itself. I am not sure
    how it would work, or how weel. Most people just buy them and download them, also
    creating a backup. The one thing that I find annoying is using multiple fonts.
    I have enough trouble with USB ports. Somehow, putting multiple font sticks into
    my computer would not make things easier on me.\r\n\r\nThat stated, there is another
    here that you are overlooking, I think. What about selling USB sticks in the shape
    of fonts, like you have posted? Personally, I'm always looking for new sticks
    myself. I'm in the market right now, because I want something bigger than my old
    8gb. But, my trouble has always been that they are not very exciting. Oh, I've
    found a few that aren't plain, but they cost an arm and a leg. \r\n\r\nJust another
    way to work this, in my opinion. ;)"
