<div class="post-content e-content" itemprop=articleBody>Concerning http://typophile.com/node/15992 here's
what I wrote to the ATypI list recently. I hope I'm not
the only one who feels this way..
"
> Neither process is easy, nor was the challenge faced by Peter

Not only difficult, but both also have a "dark side",
especially in this age of globalization. I don't mean to
be a troublemaker, but I hope there are enough signs now
(such as my essay in Spatium #4) that something like Peter
the Great's reform isn't automatically good in every way,
especially as times and politics change. I think we can
agree that at a minimum it's worth discussing potential
"complications".
I hope that somewhere in the celebrations there can be some
small room for sobering dissent as to the true effects of this
most notable case of Latinization on today's world, both within
typography and on a broader scale. I hope that's not too much
to expect of an *international* organization.
As with anything that a group of people are proud of, this can
be a touchy subject. But I think open discourse is still valuable,
and I very much hope to hear expressions of fruitful ambivalence
concerning this anniversary from other members as well.
"
It was Chris Lozos I think who recently made a small critique
of the Cyrillic structures, and although I think formalism is
always limited in relevance, I believe Chris does have a valid
point, somewhere; and in fact to me any script has features
and attributes that need objective attention in order to
improve, or at the very least to be really understood.

<div class=commentbody>Was it Nick perhaps? The new Typophile search rarely works for me (except for thread titles) so I didn't bother to try to track it down. It was something about Cyrillic "always looking like smallcaps", and I remember Maxim Zhukov didn't like that sentiment. Who was it?

<div class=commentbody>That was me. It was in relation to Greek matching the look of the latin text. I think it was a thread Nick started when he was starting a design of Greek to be part of an existing font. My point was that it is hard to mix scripts and be true to the script yet be true to the type design all while keeping it look even in color. My mention of Cyrillic was just an aside example to show how a reader might misconstrue the Cyrillic as small caps latin if it were on the same line as the latin. I probably didn't word it very well and Maxim misunderstood me. It was really not a big deal and Maxim was apologetic afterwards. I wouldn't make too much of that.

I'm not. I brought it up only to jog memories. It worked? :-)

I think what you just wrote is certainly highly relevant here.
