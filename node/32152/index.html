<div class="post-content e-content" itemprop=articleBody>Logo for Jeans manufacturer, who targets the young female customer group.
Any feedback will be invaluable.
Which feelings and associations you receive from the logo?

Thanks.

<div class=commentbody>My first impression was the logo was a cross between Tina Turner and a seahorse. Oh - wait, no, it's cross between little Maggie Simpson and a poodle!
It's like the ink splot a shrink shows you ... what does that say about me? Am I crazy?
ok, ok, some real feedback? The logotype isn't very readable; perhaps give it some air to breath? I gotta say, I don't see jeans, here, even expensive ones. The logotype to me seems like a law firm for snowboarders, but the logo is more fun and edgy. I think the logo could benefit from some simplification, however.
Perhaps try a more raw, curvy font like: http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/typo5/fashyon/

<div class=commentbody>No offense, but If I have see more of fonts like "Fasyhon" (not to mention the hundreds of free fonts there are out their like it) I seriously think I'm going to kill myself. That style is on ever current punkish/emo band right now and every product line designed for that demographic.
It's like a horrific experience they won't let you forget!</div>

<div class=commentbody>Just for the record - I never said I liked it; but it works for the demographic. I've learned the hard way that obvious works - for a reason.
You can use a leaf to communicate "environmental" and reach 90% of your target market on first glance, or you can be creative, smart, and witty -- and only reach other creative, smart and witty people. The brand name "Lobotomy Divine" doesn't exactly scream individuality.
Selling jeans is all about selling image, and if the target market is young women who want to look like Jennifer Anniston in a pair of jeans, well, then, you need to use what speaks to them.
Also, just for the record, I may be painfully out of touch ... what the heck is an emo band?

None.

<div class=commentbody>>> well, then, you need to use what speaks to them.
I get that...
Thanks for the link,
I liked Fashyon, It can be used without the logo - it's pretty pure slash logotitle typeface.
but together i hardly see any connection between them...
When both of elements are same quality, you loose the overall impact, i think. I think there should be a dominant one... i chose the seahorse (also called Hippocampus) shape.

<div class=commentbody>I can't help but see a man's profile in the negative space on the right side of the seahorse/Tina Turner/Lisa Simpson shape.
When I think of "young female" clothing, I think of Limited, Too (http://www.limitedtoo.com/) or abercrombie kids (http://www.abercrombiekids.com/kids/index.html).
My advice is to keep it very simple, but with a fun twist to it. Young girls don't care about the logo on the label (as evident by Limited, Too's outdated monstrosity - no offense to the designer, of course) - but they DO care about the name, so it has to suite the targeted customer. I'm not sure if "Lobotomy Divine" would attract a 12 year old shopper - or even more importantly, it might deter any parent shoppers.
EDIT: Also, the red/white and typeface look very gothic and angry to me. It might also have to do with points on the seahorse...looks like a sawblade</div>
