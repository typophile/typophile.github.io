body: We recently purchased new iMacs with Leopard. We have not been able to use our
  expert fonts in our font families. The fonts show up in lists within applications
  but we are unable to use them. Are the new Macs compatible with the Expert fonts?
  Has anyone had a similar experience or might know how to solve the problem? Any
  help would be appreciated.
