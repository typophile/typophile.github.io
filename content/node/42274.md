  has any suggestions for sans serif fonts with swash characters.\r\n\r\nStewf, this
  is a good time for one of your fabulous lists!"

    title doesn't contain some of the more interesting characters.\r\n\r\nI'd like
    to see fonts with swash capitals as well."

  body: 'Check the [[http://www.typography.net/info/fonts/Aspect2B_Sample.pdf|PDF

    I wouldn''t be surprised if he has more than he shows. '

    but I got my wires crossed & thought it was Aspect--which is also fascinating,
    but more artsy and less natural. Auto 3 is great. "

  body: "Nice! Right now I'm leaning a bit towards Aged, which I already own. It isn't
    swashy but it is girly without being too twee. This needs to be a gift book but
    kitsch is not my thing. Anthropologie used Aged awhile back and that's not a bad
    demographic to go for.\r\n\r\nBut keep the suggestions coming!"
