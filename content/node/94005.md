  just uppercase: all the standard Latin (except S) plus a few Greek and Cyrillic
  caps I was able to start easily from Latin. There are a few alternates in there
  too. Any general observations are welcomed, and I'm particularly interested in the
  Cyrillic \u0418. The current glyph (which is simply the alternate N reversed) doesn't
  feel right to me, but I can't really tell why.</em>\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Sample

    and below the baseline. As for X Y and Z, I don't think they're bold enough and
    also not wide enough.

  body: "\u0418: In isolation it looks unstressed, but in context you can see that
    the verticals are lighter than most verticals and the diagonal is heavier than
    most horizontals, which indicates the normal stress of a Latin N. For \u0418,
    start with an H. With regard to the weight of the verticals and how far apart
    they are, you want it to be as similar to H as is reasonable."

    have to look right. Look at Antique Olive Nord.\r\nI think the white space in
    A and V is poking slightly too far towards the top/bottom (respectively) of the
    glyphs (1). I would either (2) bring the stems further into the centre to push
    the top of the triangle in A down (and the bottom of the triangle in V up). Also
    might need to lower the crossbar in A slightly to accomodate, or (3) trim the

  body: "Okay, I have just updated with a PDF sample of my work thus far. (Please
    forgive the poor spacing and lack of kerning!) It includes all the uppercase Latin
    and Greek as well as all but three of the basic Cyrillic capitals. At this point,
    I am already aware of a couple of issues. I have difficulty giving Xi enough weight
    and maintaining balance between the top/bottom strokes and the middle one. (Any
    advice?) I'm also feeling as though Theta and Phi (also Cyrillic Ef) aren't quite
    right. I also think that the whole Cyrillic alphabet has some width inconsistencies
    to it, but I can't tell which particular glyphs are producing this problem.\r\n\r\nAlso,
    I've included a couple of alternates for Cyrillic (De and El) similar to the forms
    seen in, for example, Paratype's [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/paratype/quartal/extended-heavy/glyphs.html|Quartal]]
    and [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/paratype/mellnik-text/heavy/glyphs.html|Mellnik
    Text]] or 4th February's [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/4thfebruary/neultica-4f/black/glyphs.html|Neultica
    4F]]. My concern, though, is that these alternates might clash with the (purely
    stylistic) alternate Latin A. Would it be sufficient to simply separate these
    alternates using OpenType language-specific features, or is it better to omit
    the alternate A entirely?"
