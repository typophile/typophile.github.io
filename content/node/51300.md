body: When I startup my MAC with Leopard Linotype Fontxplorer X autoloads but it also
  loads MSWORD08 with Fontxplorer. The problem only started to occur after the install
  and use of FontXplorer. This seems very strange to me, but I am also just adapting
  to using a font manager besides font book. Has anyone experienced this problem or
  have any suggestions?
