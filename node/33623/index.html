  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">I am beginning to embark on my senior design thesis research. My school is shifting to a new journaling and process based approach to thesis development, so I neither have nor am allowed to have a concrete idea about where I want to go with this, just a loose focus. That focus is the connection between dreams, the imagination, the collective cultural wealth of world mythology, and how that ties into creativity and design. At the moment I am starting to consider with notions from Alan Fletcher, Neil Gaiman and Joseph Campbell. Along the way I also want to look at <em>The Golden Bough</em>, <em>Grimm’s Fairy Tales</em>, and various incarnations of the <em>Arabian Nights Entertainments</em>. 

My professors have already supplied me with a (huge) list of general materials that they want us to look at, but most of those are tied into modernism, something I am pretty sick of researching at this point as my school will keep beating the modernism horse until even the teeth have ground into powder. What suggestions do you have for books that might be helpful in researching dreams, myth, and design? Obscurity is not a problem—I have access to the Library of Congress, several large universities, and a few other large public and private libraries here in Washington. Please limit the books to stuff in English, though, as it is shamefully the only language I can read in.</div>

I think the best link between "the imagination, the collective cultural wealth of world mythology" and design might be image schemas - the mind's skeleton maps of, in this context, imagined worlds, scenes or stories - their layout and their changes or movement through time. The importance in Romance of image schemas, both in the large (plots) and the small (verbal style that requires spatial processing*) are my big literary-theoretical interest, and Romance is of course as close as literature gets to myth. If you like, I could dredge up some papers - Michael Kimmel's stuff is probably closest to what you want - but you should read Mark Turner's reasonably good book 'The Literary Mind' first. It's not perfect, but it's the best one-volume synthesis there is right now.

Three different structuralist approaches to All Stories, all hoary ancients but in at least two cases disappointingly not superseded, are Thompson's 'The Folktale', Propp's 'Morphology of the Folktale', and Frye's 'Anatomy of Criticism'. Of these, Thompson is an irreproachable collector of story motifs, and I don't know whether there's a more recent equivalent. Propp was a kind of better Campbell; though he's endlessly gestured at by academics, he's never been torn apart and rewritten despite some obvious flaws. For my money the Anatomy remains the most inspiring single book on literature, and half of it is a grand breakdown of all mythoi that cries out for reconstitution in image schematic terms. Again, Frye acknowledges that his account is preliminary, but in his case no one had the courage to fine-tune it before he went completely out of fashion. 

*http://cogprints.org/3239/01/Aspects%5Fof%5FCognitive%5FPoeti.html is an introduction to his own work by Reuven Tsur, who specialises in the effects and affects not of whole stories but of specific phrases and passages requiring spatial imagination. I think he's wonderful; does that kind of thing interest you too? If so, his 'Toward a Theory of Cognitive Poetics' is crucial: it's much cheaper ordered from his website.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I think there is a danger here of focusing too much on narrative, and getting lost in literary theory or philosophy. Stefan Sagmeister argues <a href="http://www.sagmeister.com/students3.html">here</a>, that graphic design generally doesn't tell a story. It provides an image that has certain emotional connotations. Sagmeister says on his site somewhere that he thinks that novels and movies can be richer emotionally because of it, and that's a limitation of graphic design. 

There are evocative images related to all religions and traditions of course, but that is a different matter. The iconic images are also related to more basic human experience, such as our it seems innate ability to recognize parts of the human body, such as faces. Frutiger's book 'Signs and Symbols' explores this. 

One of the most important things in developing your ideas is to move from a general focus to a specific problem or question. Reading will help this, if you take finding a specific question as your goal. An example would be, 'Do proportions of the human body influence design? How?' 'Are archetypal shapes derived from nature or innate to the mind?' 'Does religion inspire creativity or inhibit it?' 

I'm not saying these are great or what you would be interested in. Just that seeking a specific question or problem will give you a sharper focus, and you then will be able to better learn from your research. And, not less important, finish it in a timely manner. </div>

I have the same concern, but I would rather risk losing my way than just churn out another cookie-cutter thesis about modernism. I see stuff bubbling under the surface of design—primal ideas, creativity that’s the stuff of dreams, stuff that transcends just making a personal mantra out of “less is more.” I think this is rooted in my objection to the notion that design starts with modernism; this is all part of my exploration of the notion that designers have more in common with Michaelangelo than most people realize. And when I really start poking around I see it all going back a lot farther than the Renaissance, at the least to the days when <strong>A</strong> meant cow.

Maybe we aren’t always telling stories, but we’re still communicating big ideas, and those ideas start out as a dreams in somebodys head. And there’s a lot more to creativity than ideas randomly springing to life—inspiration assumes the presence of something inspiring, thus a new idea is a synthesis of old ones.

Fortunately I have a lot of time to get this ball rolling and stop it somewhere solid. And if it lands somewhere too weird, well, by the time I get graded on it it will not affect my financial aid anymore.</div>

Oh, I see where you are coming from now. As far as I am concerned, modernism is just another style. Those who make it into politics or religion--which it was for some of its founders--are just way off base. The key thing about taking it too seriously is that is dogmatic, and says that that is the only way to solve visual problems. 

The idea of making graphic design functional was already there. Also outside type and graphic design I think modernism is pretty much a disaster. Within graphic design--because it naturally needs the grid--it worked much better, and brought sans to the fore in a new way. 

But the theory of creativity is a thing in itself, and is basically the theory of problem-solving. 

I would suggest you look at the wonderful recent work of <a href="http://bantjes.com/">Marian Bantjes</a>, who is blowing the doors off modernist prejudice against ornament by doing it so freshly and delightfully. And why don't you ask her what moved her to leap out of the modernist straight jacket? And what she'd suggest. I bet she'll have some great ideas. </div>

According to Kallir the "A" is actually a man with his member. In his version
of the genesis of the alphabet, procreation is the key - and you can't get more
mystical than that!  :-)

> it naturally needs the grid

False.

On Bantjes though we agree.
Where did you first find out about her?
