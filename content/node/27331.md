  body: "You just don't stop, do you? :-)\r\n\r\nI'm not so sure about this curve
    you have on the top of some of your lowercase verticals. On the m, n, and r, I
    think it is OK. I don't like it on the i when the strokes get this thin. It looks
    too wobbly. It also makes me wonder why you have straight, flat entries on your
    ascenders.\r\n\r\nI like the ampersand."

  body: "Yeah, I know. Somehow in my head I'm envisioning a multiple master axis for
    the tops of these strokes that runs from straight to curved as the weight axis
    is increased as well. Wouldn't that be something! Then, your regular's curve would
    be in between the hairline and the heavy.\r\n\r\nBut then again, I envision a
    lot of things in my head, and I wouldn't assume that most of them are credible
    ;-)\r\n\r\nI remember Tiffany writing something about not liking sans serifs that
    have flat entry strokes a few days ago\u2026 or something to that effect. That
    made me think a bit. Quite an interesting perspective."

    help jog my memory.\r\n\r\nChris, this is looking really nice for a huge thin
    display font. I think the open bowl on your cap P is a little too open. But then
    this is coming from someone who doesn't really like open bowls.\r\n\r\n- a --
    is the entry stroke a little too long?\r\n- B (reg and sc) -- is the bottom bowl
    a little too large?\r\n- P (reg and sc) -- too open?\r\n- R (reg and sc) -- too
    open?\r\n- Q (reg and sc) -- tail too long?\r\n\r\nI wonder the same thing about
    the angled strokes on the i & j ..."

  body: tiff i think you were talking about Verlag and saying how you didn't like
    the shear on the light weight "t". I think that's what dan is referring to.

  body: "Tiff,\r\nYou may be right about the \"a\", I will try it.\r\n\r\nIn terms
    of the open strokes, I tried them before with more closure and they just look
    appologetic.  I think a harline weight needs a dominant negative space and the
    opened glyphs seem to help that for me. See my post above on the i for the i and
    j as well.\r\n\r\nRegarding the B, I have a real dilemma with the top bowl meeting
    the bottom bowl.  If the bowls are more equal, there is a hot spot at the join.
    \ I fought more with that spot than anyting else on the font. With a harline,
    a one unit move is about 10% shift and quite noticable. I am wondering if I should
    move up to 2000 UPM on this font?\r\n\r\n\r\nChrisL"
