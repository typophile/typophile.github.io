  body: "On a literal level I wonder whether trees and everest work, but if you used
    mountains you would be even closer to the evian logo \u2013\_which was my first
    reaction. I find the s too wide and the r is reaching a bit and I am not a fan
    of the letterspaced sub.\r\n\r\nTim"

  body: "At a conceptual level, I don\u2019t think that the pine tree arrows work
    with the name. When I see pines I think of, well, more friendly mountains. Everest
    is about as imposing as geological features get, and the uplifting pine trees
    clash with that. The letterspaced type at the bottom appears to be competing for
    attention with its superior; toning it down and letting it settle into a nice
    quiet state would work better.\r\n\r\nAt a nitpicky level, chopping off the terminals
    of <strong>s</strong> creates a letter that draws attention away from all of the
    others. It also makes the letter look unbalanced when one is looking at the left
    side of the logo while the right remains in periphery. It also creates a weird
    gap because the horizontal stroke of <strong>t</strong> does not extend to the
    left.\r\n\r\nThe notch in <strong>v</strong> appears to flare a tiny bit due to
    the wide counter and narrowing strokes, try tucking it in a little. \r\n\r\nI\u2019m
    not buying <strong>r</strong> at all, it\u2019s too tall, and may be too narrow.\r\n\r\nMake
    the <strong>e</strong>s taller."

    what to do about the icon. The client wants to stay away from a literal mountain
    interpretation. "

    doesn\u2019t strike me as one whose customers will have trouble just picking up
    on the words."

    to really like the idea of having one.\r\n\r\nIt probably doesn't have to be as
    prominent as it is."

    leaving aside the evian remark I made. A handsomely created and considered logo
    would serve your client better than an obvious one.\r\nhttp://images.google.com/images?svnum=10&um=1&hl=en&safe=off&client=safari&rls=en&q=everest+logo&btnG=Search+Images\r\n\r\nTim"

  body: Even before reading Tim's post I thought immediately Evian. Maybe just changing
    the colours could help avoid the association with Evian.
