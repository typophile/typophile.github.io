  be found at http://www.acidfonts.com.  The cost is absolutely free.  \r\n\r\nI've
  been trying to find a digital version of Yagi Double for years \r\nand even made
  one myself in 1995.  These typefaces I found were very\r\nfaithfully reproduced.\r\n\r\nLook
  around in the free typeface websites.  Who knows?  You might find \r\nsomething
  very interesting!"

    fonts were originated in the Facsimile Font program. I'm glad that it has been

  body: "Bob, thank you for responding to my comment on Yagi Double,\r\none of my
    absolute favorite typefaces.  \r\n\r\nI never thought that I would read from the
    man who drew the types.\r\n\r\nI've loved it ever since I was a child in the 1970's.
    \ Probably\r\nwhen I watched ABC's Rhyme and Reason game show on TV, back then.\r\nNotice
    the podium before Bob Eubanks?[img:sites/default/files/old-images/rhymeandreason_5433.jpg]"
