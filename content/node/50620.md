body: "Our NC controller that we rescued in 1978 has this sculpted plate on the front:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/superiorelectric_3484.jpg]\r\nWe've
  modified the machine extensively, but we still use this controller's \"brain\" to
  machine the brass parts on our guitars. \r\n\r\nWe also have a three spindle printed
  circuit board drill made by Excellon. Here's the plate on the spindle head:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/excellon1_4751.jpg]\r\nAnd
  the base has their name carved in gabbro granite across the front. It looks really
  cool:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/excellon2_5602.jpg]\r\nThis table is
  so large we had to have the building built around it. "
