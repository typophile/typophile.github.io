body: "Hi all, I'm a graphic design student and this is my first try to design a font.
  This typeface is my school project that I've been working on now for a while. Since
  it's my first typeface I wanted it to be a display font. Here's a rough sample .pdf
  what I have now (i haven't done any capitals yet).\r\n\r\nApologies for the glyphs
  \"y\" \"x\" and \"z\", they look horrible. The question mark is also a bit weird
  and squarish... \r\n\r\n(Note: I haven't payed too much attention to the kerning
  yet.)\r\n\r\nAnyhow, all the critique is more than welcome, I really need it!\r\n\r\n"

  body: "This looks very promising. The characters \u201Cy\u201D, \u201Cx\u201D and
    \u201Cz\u201D need a lot of work, as you yourself point out. I also think that
    the style of the \u201Ck\u201D, although it looks good by itself, looks too different
    to the other characters. It looks too narrow, somehow.\r\n\r\nAnd is it just me,
    or does the \u201Co\u201D look more upright than the other characters?\r\n\r\nBut
    all in all this is a lovely beginning, and I look forward to seeing the font with
    capitals."

  body: "Good morning (or evening) and thank you for your good pointers!\r\n\r\nI
    should concentrate on my \"horrible glyphs\" (i do them last because they seem
    to be the most annoying and difficult ones to make, eh. Also as a native Finnish
    we don't really use letters \"z\" and \"x\" in our language so maybe my eye is
    not used to the shapes of those letters).\r\n\r\nIt's true Arild, that the \"k\"
    might be too different from the other characters, so I should do some modifications.
    I do like the style of it so maybe I should try to just fix the proportions to
    go more with the fellow characters. Now when I look at it, it might have bigger
    contrast than the other characters, have to check it... I'm also going to check
    the \"o\" and \"v\" too like you two pointed out that there's something to work
    on.\r\n\r\n\u2013\u2013\r\nI forgot to tell about the background of this font.
    This typeface is my final thesis of my studies (I'm not a student of typography
    so I've kind of had to figure out things on my own and because of that there might
    be some really elementary mistakes in my design). The first part of the project
    was to go to Spain (north part of Spain) to shoot and examine some street typography.
    I was inspired by the boat typography I found from the tiny fishing villages.
    In \"el capitano\", I'm trying to capture the spirit of the little wooden colorful
    boats and the custom hand painted names and numbers on them. \r\n\u2013\u2013\r\n\r\nThanks
    for your opinions, keep it coming because it really makes me see the things!\r\n\r\nI'm
    horrified about the capitals because they seem to be super hard to make and I
    have huge problems to make them fit to the kind of roundy style of the lowercase.
    Oh well, back to the work!\r\n\r\n"

    other fonts in the same style, like Dolly italic from Underware.

  body: "I actually think the u and the v are okay, but I'm a fan of that style so...take
    my opinion as...opinion :)\r\n\r\nFor the y, try using the same stroke as in the
    v.  Arild: the o also looks upright to me.  I can't tell which yet but the pq
    looks a bit odd.  Like the p droops too much or the q is suckin' its stomach in.
    But looking on their other side they seem to match up so, maybe look into that
    see if they connect to their stems where they really need to."
