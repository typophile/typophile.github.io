body: Hello, I&#39;m writing because I&#39;m starting a work which is set on chinese
  characters on MAC but I must make some experiments with some chinese fonts to see
  if the system really accept the uncoding. So I would like to know some links with
  freeware chinese fonts to install on computer. I made a search on some links but
  every thing that I found was not good to make download because they didn&#39;t work
  at the computer. Anyone can help me with this situation? Thanks

    maybe even WinXP, if possible&#41;, it already comes with some Chinese fonts &#40;I
    think&#41;.

  body: In fact I already install OSX 10 and I configure the system to apply chinese
    but I must get some free fonts for now only to see if everything is OK. If the
    client really want to do the work we must buy some fonts but for now I only want
    to prepare and testing the computer. Thanks Eduardo
