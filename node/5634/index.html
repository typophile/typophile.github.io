<div class="post-content e-content" itemprop=articleBody>I've been reading the posts and archives and have found much of what I need. But I wonder if some of you could help me. I have been working with a partner doing architectural photography and this has expanded into a limited design company. <br> <br>I felt strongly that I needed to expand my type collection. I have the fonts that come with Photoshop CS and other versions and the Adobe Type Classic Collection and have been following your advice to shop around and buy fonts you like and I have bought a lot! <br> <br>But I wonder if there are some basic, useful fonts you would find indispensible in your collections and also the fonts you like the most. <br> <br>I know I will have to buy some fonts specifically to meet a customer's needs. I will spend another $500-$1,000 (preferably the 500) at this time on my general type collection and want to make sure that what i have is representative of a quality selecion. <br> <br>I'm using Windows. <br> <br>Thanks for reading this and for any help you can give me. <br> <br>Sharon <br> <br></div>

<div class=commentbody>Hi Jim, <br> <br>I bought a font from you when your website had just come online. Your service was wonderful and I have several more of your fonts on my list. <br> <br>Dan, <br> <br>I wish I had asked this question earlier. I have some of these fonts, but these packages look good. I agree about Conrad. <br> <br>Our business is based in Nantucket and that name is used a lot in business names. I've tried to find some fonts that show the Nantucket name as well as indicate the history and heritage of the island. I'm considering MVB Chanson d</div>

<div class=commentbody>When I started out, I purchased the Bitstream Full Library <br>on CD-ROM to make sure I had access to equivalents of the <br>"standard" typefaces plus a whole bunch of really cool fonts <br>for a more than reasonable price. I haven't regretted that <br>purchase ever since and upgraded to Bitstream's TypeHigh <br>CD-ROM when it came out not so long ago. <br> <br>For the rest I concentrate on truly original and distinctive <br>type families. <br> <br>Dan, I'm pleasantly surprised about the pricing of these <br>Linotype collections. It appears Linotype faces aren't as <br>expensive anymore as they used to be.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Oh, I like that Storm Collection. <br> <br>I have bought a lot at Myfonts but I just wondered how blindly I was wandering. <img src=http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif alt=:-) border=0> <br> <br>I'm also looking at 3islandpress fonts.

<div class=commentbody>Sharon, if you want New England, you really should look more into Font Bureau (<a href=http://www.fontbureau.com target=_blank>www.fontbureau.com</a> Boston), or anything from Tobias Frere-Jones at Hoefler & Frere-Jones Typography (<a href=http://www.typography.com target=_blank>www.typography.com</a>). Bitstream is in New England, too... and MyFonts... at least they're <i>headquartered</i> in Cambridge. <br> <br>After having lived in Providence for four years, I really get a kick out of the Providence Type Foundry (<a href=http://www.provtype.com/index2.html target=_blank>http://www.provtype.com/index2.html</a>), too; or at least its font names. <br> <br>Unfortuantely, I can't say that Linotype has anything distinctly "New England." We do sell a lot of typefaces to New Englanders, though. <br> <br>Yves, I think that <b>all</b> of Linotype's products are reasonalbly priced now (no, I'm not saying this just because I work in the <i>marketing</i> department). I mean, the gold edition will still set you back 10 grand, but it is ENORMOUS. <br> <br>Most of the font collections are very nicely priced. The Take Type Collections <a href=http://www.linotype.com/6-1785-6/taketype.html target=_blank>http://www.linotype.com/6-1785-6/taketype.html</a> <br>are really broad, with a lot of one-off display faces, but they all have a few good text families (including the first appearance of Conrad, on Take Type 3!). Our new special packs sell five or six fonts apiece, at an average of 6 EUR a font, I think. <a href=http://www.linotype.com/6-1788-6/compilationvaluepackages.html target=_blank>http://www.linotype.com/6-1788-6/compilationvaluepackages.html</a> <br> <br>Plus, we will soon be offering student discounts (if we haven't had them before) <br> <br>And in the name of good, fair competition, I should add that the best of Unger's fonts are available from us, too ;)</div>

<div class=commentbody>Thanks so much, <br> <br>I like a lot of the Font Bureau collections but I think I like the Myfonts Linotype collection better to start with. That and the Storm czech collection.
