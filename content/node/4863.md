  figures as alternates to the standard proportional figures.  <BR>I&#39;ve designed
  and included monetary symbols to fit with the  <BR>Tabular figures but it dawns
  on me that periods and spaces  <BR>should match too. Maybe... <BR> <BR>Am I crazy?
  Periods are really common within a range of numbers. <BR>For example: <BR>4545.094598
  <BR>3458394.9084 <BR> <BR>And as shown above, would throw off the tabular setting.
  <BR>Is this reasonable with OT?'

    space, and make the period/comma/dash/etc. exactly the width of the space, so
    you can &#34;pad&#34; as needed. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>

  body: You &#42;can&#42; do it. But I don&#39;t think you need to. <BR> <BR>The only
    reason for tabular figures is to make them line up from one line to the next in
    a table. In such setting, it is expected that the numbers will be aligned on the
    decimal &#40;a period in English, a comma in many other languages&#41;. So the
    width of that alignment character becomes irrelevant. Any separator characters
    will then also line up, so as long as one is consistent in their use &#40;spaces,
    thin spaces, commas, periods, whatever one uses to do numbers like &#34;1,000,000&#34;&#41;
    <BR> <BR>Now, that&#39;s the question of necessity. A tabular period and comma
    would put more space around them in setting numbers. I am curious to hear folks&#39;
    opinions about whether this would be aesthetically pleasing. <BR> <BR>Regards,
    <BR> <BR>T

    was thinking the same thing.  <BR>If there was an easy way it might be nice but
    the problem still <BR>remains, how would the user deal with really wide spaces
    and periods?  <BR>Not well I&#39;m thinking. Best left for a real monospaced typeface.
    <BR>  <BR>However,  I could see working up a mono period and space that only activate
    <BR>when surrounded by numbers... <BR>&#40;this relates to the &#42;can&#42; mentioned
