body: Aside from not being aesthetically pleasing, so many things are just plain wrong
  about this advertisement. This image has no hierarchy and the type sizes seem to
  be chosen at random. Upon seeing it my eyes has no clue as to how to read it or
  what info is most important, first I see the words WLAE-TV followed by tuition auction
  and after that its all a blur. More than two different typefaces are used. If I
  counted correctly there are 5 different typefaces, including the chalk type in the
  image which is distracting. I don't believe that any rulers/grid lines were used
  as none of the text is aligned. Overall this has to be one of the worst things I
  have ever seen in print.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/badtype_4114.jpg]
