  body: I&#39;ve found it depends on the &#34;x&#34; height.  <BR>There&#39;s something
    neat about having the tops of the &#40;main&#41; accents on the lc/sc line up
    with the top of the caps. Whatever it takes.

  body: 'I think in general SC accents should match the UC ones, because: <BR>- The
    congruence with the UC accents in an all-caps line is nice &#40;since that&#39;s
    basically display usage, where congruence is central&#41;. <BR>- In mixed-case
    setting SC are generally used for acronyms, which tend to be less accented; and
    anyway mixed-case text is more divergent &#40;which is related to textiness&#41;
    so it&#39;s less disruptive to have two kinds of accents. <BR> <BR>Of course if
    you can have <i>two</i> sets depending on how they&#39;re used...  ;-&#41; <BR>
