body: Badly drawn lettering will never go away.  We, who absolutely despise it, should
  learn to accept it as part of the typographic landscape.  Then, we should ignore
  it!  Some of it looks pretty good.  But, that's not what draws some people to what's
  being sold.  It's like Jackson Pollock's so-called paintings.  People dove head
  first into that, just because it was unique.  Strike bad lettering!  How about unique?  At
  least some of those informal forms are unique.  To each, their own.
