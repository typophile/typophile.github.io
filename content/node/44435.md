  I'm new here (and to design/typography), so feel free to tell me (nicely, hopefully)
  to go away. :)\r\n\r\nI'm working on a producing a DVD of a ballet performance,
  and would like advice choosing type for the titles and/or opening and trailing credits,
  taking into account both the medium and some cultural/historical context if possible.
  The music was composed by Rossini in 1816, but the dance was composed by Violette
  Verdy, a living (French) ballet dancer and teacher of dance. It was performed last
  month by the Indiana University Ballet Theater here in Bloomington, IN.\r\n\r\nI
  have zero budget for this project, so I'm going to be limited to free faces, or
  those that I already have (standard Windows stuff, plus the stuff which came with
  Adobe Suite CS2).\r\n\r\nI'm leaning in the direction of Garamond Premier for titles,
  but I'm not sure it would be readable on a standard-definition TV screen for credits.\r\n\r\nI'd
  appreciate any thoughts any one is willing to share!\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\n-- John."
