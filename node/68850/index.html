  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>I just released Tempest, a headline serif font in MyFonts, but while I worked on that, I wanted to make a more playful, whimsical little brother for it.</p>
<p>Some glyphs still need work, and kerning is just in it&rsquo;s infancy, but you get a feel for the font here:
<img src="/images/old-images/Tournedot_4074.png" alt=""></p>
<p>I&rsquo;m thinking of making some alternate glyphs; a and g are done already. I used them on the pdf, so you can see them there.</p>
<p>I started with a serif design, but veered off pretty quick; Tournedot needed something different, so I turned it into a semi sans with pretty galligraphic tones going on with V, v, W, w, A, M and so on.</p>
<p>What do you think?</p>

<p>/g/ and /y/ are quite off-kilter. They jump out to me, but at the same time they also pleasingly reinforce the bounciness of the font.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think the /a/ extended intersection works as well as /e/&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>/M/ looks weak to me in the upper left.</p>
<p>I wonder if there&rsquo;s a way around the almost-crash of &ldquo;Fu&rdquo; (in &ldquo;full character set&rdquo;). I can imagine the low-hanging serif of /T/ posing a similar problem.</p>
<p>The subtle swellings of the lines are attractive.</p>
<p>Charming stuff!</p>

<p>Yes, those g and y do jump out, but that was my intention, and that a-extension is still at try-out stage. T and F serifs do extend a bit too much. And I&rsquo;ll go through the whole character set to see any thin/thick points.</p>
<p>And ligatures are still under production, as well as kerning pairs; there&rsquo;s less than 200 of the buggers, so it&rsquo;s clear that there&rsquo;s still work ahead.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>This is a lot of fun, and clearly very refined. I love the /g/.</p>
<p>I think the single-story /a/ works better than the double, but part of that is because the double is too narrow by just a bit. Come to that, the /s/ might need widened a tad as well&hellip; Like Eliason, I&rsquo;m not sure if the extended intersection is working super well on the /a/ but it&rsquo;s not bad.</p>
<p>/i/ and /r/ seem very slightly heavier than the rest. I think it&rsquo;s that they don&rsquo;t have the same stroke variance as some of the other characters. I&rsquo;m looking at them amid /n/s and /h/s and the like, and when I cover up the the curved parts I can see the stems are the same. But having that thin part makes the character seem lighter as a whole. I doubt you could bring that into the /i/, but you might shave a hair&rsquo;s breadth off the side to compensate. As for the /r/, you probably could increase the stroke disparity.</p>
<p>Lastly, I notice that you have two different styles of serif, one of which has a couple of sharp(ish) corners and the other of which is more curved. For the most part, I think these have been used appropriately, but I would switch them on the tops of the /I/ and /i/. The /I/ is very easy to mistake for an /l/, and I would expect a capital letter to have the slightly more formal &ldquo;bent&rdquo; serif. This would also segregate them by height (bent serifs up at cap-height level, curvy ones at x-height) which would seem to make sense. This is all just my instincts talking, however.</p>
<p>Very nice work. I especially like the punctuation!</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Thanks, Tristan-</p>
<p>Happy to hear that you like my font.</p>
<p>I tried a and s wider, but they looked out of place, and had to come back with them. That a extention I just had to do; otherwise e was just a fad. (Well, I did use it in P and R as well).</p>
<p>I tried to make i to look lighter, but it just went too far with even a slight chance, so I left that as it was.</p>
<p>Upper case has different height from ascenders, so serifs can be playful as well.</p>
<p>Thanks for your comments. Happy to see that people really look at my stuff.</p>
