  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Hi, 
I am working on my thesis project right now. So I came upon this question: How many serious type designers are there in the world right now? I know its kind of hard to say because there is so many people out there that make fonts for fun. But I kind of mean those that not necessarily live from creating type, but are very much devoted to type design. Those that have the knowledge to create typefaces that can stand out among all the junk. I am looking for the number of those people that would be able to develop a complex and satisfactory fontsystem. Not only from the technical and programming perspective but more important from the design side of things. I hope I have narrowed it down a bit. I am not expecting exact numbers (even though they would be nice), but if someone has researched this before I would be glad for some inside.
Thanks
Henning</div>

	<div class="card-body">
		<div class="commentbody">Based on the definition of "serious" provided, I think the total is much larger than people are suggesting. Certainly, I'd say 300 is the wrong order of magnitude entirely. Especially since one of the criteria offered is that the person may not make their living designing type.

I think the number is measured in thousands. If you look beyond the "A-level" names Carter, Hoefler, Berlow, Kobayashi, Schwartz,  (etc) you find a whole bastion of incredibly capable type designers. Chester, Crossgrove, Simonson, Darden, Ragan, Downer. Oops don't forget about the Thierry Puyfoulhoux's hiding out in the alps designing fonts to fuel their whitewater adventures. Duprés cranking out types. Pingerras. Porchez. Hughes. Tankards. The Meaves from Mexico, and the Alejandro Lo Celsos from Argentina. Looking through something like the FontShop catalogue, I find myself looking at many of the names attached to very polished, and extensive families and say to myself: "where do all these people come from?" Beyond that there is yet a deeper layer of excellent typophiles who labor in relative anonymity. I can think of many here on Typophile who would fit the criteria proposed, but would probably not make most people's list. Miguel Hernandez? Eduardo Omine? Christian Robertson? Chris Lozos? Kris Sowersby? How many Keith Tams are there who are capable of making great type, but are busy doing other things? Or working behind the scenes like Miguel Sousa, Paul Hunt, Andy Clymer, Jean-Baptiste Levée etc.

Not to mention, non-latin type designers as Thomas mentions.

Of course the trickiest criterion you propose is this: <em>Those that have the knowledge to create typefaces that can stand out among all the junk.</em> The quality of the type is only part of that equation.

My stratification of type names is mostly nonsense, but you get my point. I got past thirty without even thinking to include Slimbaugh, Speikerman, Stone, or Frutiger. This is a long list indeed, so I won't be accepting any challenges, but what kind of list wouldn't include Peter "Mustardo" Bruhn. Oh wait, he's not very serious.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">The participants in Indie Fonts 3 give some idea of the diversity of backgrounds and intent against which any claim of 'serious" must be judged. Given that there are different markets for fonts, there are different kinds of "serious"; and it does seem that "serious" means making the majority, or a significant amount, of one's income off type design -- although people who are headed in that direction may be quite dedicated.

The number of foundries represented by Myfonts ("Welcomes 13 new foundries" -- summer 07 newsletter) gives some idea of how many are doing business.

And then there is the question of what constitutes "type design".
The way it stands at the moment, that term casts a broad net, including everything from one-person outfits creating original fonts, to technical production work for software companies.

If as I agree there are thousands of us, perhaps we should have our own organization, as our interests are not fully served by trade organizations that lump individual designers together with software giants.</div>

Again, it depends on what one means by "can stand out among all the junk". Many of the names you list have not done that in my view. In fact the way you're portraying things it's like the junk is in the minority!

> perhaps we should have our own organization

Yes! And as I suggested years ago, it should be called "TyD".
You know, an unstoppable flow.  :-)

		<div class="commentbody">Nick: to suggest that Miguel is not a typeface designer simply because he works for Adobe is unfair. It seems to me the size and nature your employer has little to do with whether or not you are a type designer. I agree that seriousness can be measured many ways. Earning a significant portion of your income from type design could be a useful distinction in some cases. I purposely cast a wide net, because I consider myself a typeface designer. I make the majority of my living as a graphic designer, but more than 10% is typeface design. Still, I humbly submit that my ability to draw and sell orginial typefaces from scratch, should justify the title regardless of income precentages.

Hrant: Every single person I mentioned has developed and is able to "develop a complex and satisfactory fontsystem." You may not like their types, but these people make quality typefaces that are useful in the real world.</div>

That's your inference, not mine!
I was merely observing that in font production there may be division of labour, and it's all called type design.

		<div class="commentbody">He he. Another venerable maxim: don't try to read between the lines of a forum post. Appologies Nick. I agree, about division of labor all falling under the label type design. My point was: even if worker bees at the larger shops don't get their names on the final font, they are certainly capable of taking a design from concept to delivery and are type designers in their own right.

Hrant: 

I think I am following his criteria :-) I'd be curious if you'd call me a typeface designer? Or yourself? 

Junkiness is indeed personal and probably not the best criteria. I was just looking at the homepage at FontShop and saw this face I'd never seen before by a guy I'd never heard of: FF Speak designed by Jan Maack. Is it standout? I'd say probably not. Is it junk? I don't think so. Is it well done? Absolutely. To me, I'd have no trouble calling Jan Maack a Typeface Designer even though the world probably wont remember his typeface 50 years from now. It's less about the label, and more about the capability. Plus I think there's still more than enough junk left over after you make room for the Jan Maack's of the world to to warrant your 90% maxim.

Ultimately who cares? It's a good question for the breaks between sessions at typecon, but good for little else. Everything I've said, boils down to this:

I'm constantly surprised by the number of quality typefaces that I would be happy to use, designed by people I've never heard of. I'd like to think that type design is a craft practiced by a fraternity of a few hundred, all of whom I've heard of, but then I discover somebody jumped the velvet rope when I wasn't looking.</div>

So in my carefully calculated answer I didn't include living designers who'd made a non-junk font a few years ago, but had moved on to different, more profitable things. I don’t know if Jan Maack qualifies under this definition, but there are many living type designers who are retired, resting, on sabbatical or between jobs "right now".

		<div class="commentbody">Randy, I mostly agree with you. Except for the part that you're abiding by Henning’s criteria. :-)  And if it matters: I think both you and I are on the border of his criteria, because we can make non-junk type (although you might be further ahead than me on the ground, especially in Latin) but neither one of us has really proved excellence. That said, I'm realizing that my own definition of "junky" would not exclude as many people as I might have thought; although 90% of people produce ho-hum ephemeral stuff, maybe "junk" is too unkind a label for all of them. OK then, I'm officially doubling my near-blind estimate to 200.  :-)

		<div class="commentbody">In my way of using the term, a typeface designer does some things that are significantly different than the production work that occupies most of Christopher Slye or Miguel Sousa's time, designing glyph shapes and setting the overall "feel" of the typeface.

Now, I consider both Miguel and Christopher to be typeface designers, but that's because they've each designed a typeface (Calouste, Elmhurst) in addition to doing extensive production work. There are lots of other people who have done font production work at Adobe at one time or another who I don't think of as type designers. Invaluable members of the team, but not type designers.

I also have what some would consider a high bar for quality in my head. So by my understanding of the original request:

<cite>Those that have the knowledge to create typefaces that can stand out among all the junk. I am looking for the number of those people that would be able to develop a complex and satisfactory fontsystem. Not only from the technical and programming perspective but more important from the design side of things.</cite>

... I don't think there's any way in heck that there are a thousand type designers in the world, even across all languages. I'd be surprised if there were more than 500 globally.

I'm assuming "complex and satisfactory fontsystem" implies a range of weights and perhaps other variables (width, style) in a comprehensive system, including typographic goodies whether in separate fonts in "old formats" or in the same font in OpenType.

Thats exactly what I meant. Thanks for clearifying and adding to the criteria. 

“right now” doesn't exclude those "type designers who are retired, resting, on sabbatical or between jobs". I rather mean those that have the knowledge to create type. no matter if they are drawing curves at the moment or not.

I think this is more interesting to non-type people; you can say, "The type world is about as big as the puppetry world or the harpsichord-making world, and much smaller than the soccer world or the hang-gliding world".

For freelancers who haven't published independently, you could go through a FontFont catalog (or contact FSI) and develop a list of their designers. Same thing for Linotype.

I just checked the US Census site to see if maybe "type designer" was listed under the  index of occupations. It wasn't. Even in the detailed <a href="http://www.census.gov/hhes/www/ioindex/cens_260_296.html">breakdown</a> of "Arts, Design, Entertainment", where Millinery Designers and Sign Designers are referenced, it goes without mention. A look at the alphabetical <a href="http://www.census.gov/hhes/www/ioindex/occ_t.html">breakdown</a> yielded some interesting type-related professions that managed to get listed: hand compositor, type cutter (they lump this in with a host of other machine operators), and typographer. I would guess that type designers would likely fall into one of these classifications: 27-021 (Commercial and industrial Designers), 27-024 (Graphic Designers), or 27-029(all other Designers).

But that's only for the US, and couldn't figure out how to pull numbers out of this website. Furthermore, I'm not sure what kind of maintenance is regularly performed on there classification scheme, so you couldn't find the most obscure profession listed and then infer "there are at least fewer type designers than Klingon translators/Penny Farthing BMXers/Autogyro mechanics in the US." 

Edit: <a href="http://www.bls.gov/">The Bureau of Labor Statistics</a> might have been a better place to look, but I don't have time to figure the site out.  </div>

Agreed. Which is why I suggest presenting foundries with a brief "to develop a complex and satisfactory fontsystem".
It would presumably list production criteria such as styles, weights, encodings, features, as well as usage specifications -- a hypothetical publication might be a good "client".
The researcher would assess whether the foundry is adequate to the task or just b*llsh*tting, as a client would have to.
However, that's not always easy, as many suppliers offer services they don't have in-house -- which is quite legitimate; so some kind of "first person judgement" would be required at some point, to assess the junkiness factor.

Rather than presenting the brief as a hypothetical exercise, it might be better to ask if the foundry/designer has done such a project in the past -- either as a commission, or as a retail product -- and what the resulting typeface is.

Note that this only counts people whose fonts are listed at MyFonts (i.e. either on sale or listed for reference). Most notable font foundries are included, though some are not. The database is very incomplete. For example, John Hudson is only credited as having designed two families, which is obviously wrong, since only the old Tiro Typeworks-exclusive fonts are counted.  

MyFonts sells very few non-European fonts. There are probably at least as many people who design Chinese, Japanese, Arabic, Indic, Thai etc. fonts that are only distributed in local markets, or people who do European-language typefaces but are not included in the MyFonts count. 

I think it would be fair to say that there around 1,000 active type designers in the world.

		<div class="commentbody"><em>What might be a more manageable figure is “How many people are earning a full time living in type design.” This will take the number to to low double digits, I would think.</em>

By this criteria many historical designers would not qualify starting with Garamond who died deeply in debt. Bodoni wouldn't qualify either, nor Baskerville, nor even Gutenberg himself who made his money as a printer. Excoffon made his living as an advertising art director, as did Dwiggins for many years. There are a great many serious designers who didn't make their living designing type, but still produced important typefaces. Let's see, Tschichold, Cassandre, Eicher, Abrams, et al. Victor Gualtney doesn't make his living through type design, but there's no way he could not be considered serious.

I think any measure of who's a type designer has to be based on intent. In fact those who are <em>not</em> making money at it might be considered to be more serious. Why else are they doing it?

It might be better to consider how many people in the world are serious about typography and the work back from there. Between memberships in various organizations there have to be several thousand with a large percentage of them type designers.

Please change my opinion and mind, logically.

If I write something, then digitise it, have I not designed a typeface ? An original typeface ? If I offer it for sale, and it sells, is this not type design ?

Working on the premise that what I have stated is wrong, there are a lot of typefaces out there, based on handwriting, that are not designed. What are they ?

As far as I can see, the rules and restrictions placed upon the design of the alphabet, while sensible, are the rules that a few have taken upon themselves to instigate. The alphabet has been there for many a year longer than these people, and my concept of how I draw, or design three lines to make an A, is one I determine myself, while observing an aesthetical appearance about it. If I like it, and others choose to use it, who has the right to tell me it is wrong and incorrect ? The rules, then become a mere guideline to aesthetics, and not strict rules at all.

		<div class="commentbody">Typotheticals, there is first an issue of definition. I believe the way the words are most often used by careful writers in this field is that type, lettering and writing mean three different things. 

Type--or better a 'font'--is a set of templates of letters that are used repeatedly in any order to compose words seen on paper, the screen, solid letters put on a building, etc.

Lettering is the act of building up letters by hand to produce words. 

Writing is the act of moving an instrument by hand to produce a moving front that leaves letters and words behind.  

The question of how much type should be influenced by writing is another issue.

Oh and and to answer your question, it is possible to turn a piece of handwriting into a font, but the two are defined as different things--one writing the other a font. And they are different as the font will contain a limited set of letters that will be reproduced according to the instructions in the software.

		<div class="commentbody">Let me have one more bash at this. Guttenberg produced type in which each letter, say 'A', was the mechanical reproduction of a single design, stamped into a matrix. These predetermined, nearly identical letters were then arranged into words. That's type: arranging of pre-determined letters into words. 

And that puts different demands on the crafter of the words. In particular, every letter has to fit with every other letter that it might be next to in the languages contemplated for use. 

The letterer or writer of words can adjust each letter ad hoc to suit the letters on either side, as well as above and below, and the margins. 

So type design has different demands on it than lettering or writing, even though all are created by the hand and the eye.  </div>

Yes, open type script faces are attempting to recover some of the flexibility of writing and lettering. But they are still more limited, and will always be, because they have to be predetermined by rules, and not done by creative problem-solving on the spot. 

But the more important thing is that type has, I believe, proved superior as far as readability for extended text. Taking months or years to get the letters optimal for readability, then reproduce them, has improved readability over hand written text. 

That's still not true for aesthetics. Hand lettering--either on paper or the computer screen--regularly beats type for logos, titles, etc. </div>

I got to agree something that this pushes. It supports your side, and that is it really irritates me that when you get those eternal "what font is this ?" for anything that resembles letters. Technology has not only lowered the standard of writing, it has also lowered the ability to distinguish between a digital construction and a physical construction.

With the limited (yes there is one) scope for the production of new typefaces, how many type designers will there be in 20 years ?

If we had an Opentype with the multiple master feature encompassed within, and a random number generator (probably based on the clock)we would end up with basically a typeface that would be near endlessly original each time.

Wouldnt be great variations, but still variations.

Myself included. 
I laughed (cried really) with everyone else at the royalties I was getting. 
Today, we send royaty checks that people want to cash. Everybody gets checks on huge %s compared to back then, 
(but I don't get any 'cause I thought of it.)

Cheers!</div>

Probably a clerical error or for something else, as those royalties belong to Microsoft. </div>

		<div class="commentbody">I was hoping he started Myfonts (Font Bureau has a classy line-up, and I don't mean to downplay that retailer) because I have never heard how it got started. Typowiki doesn't say much except that it is owned by Bitstream. If they started it, my hat is off to them. I have always thought that Myfonts is a great equalizer, giving the 'everyman' designer an outlet with fair return.

Maybe both. David likely had the idea while at Bitstream but had to wait for Al Gore to invent the interwebs before his dream could become reality. He probably left a hidden note behind the liquor cabinet when he left. </div>
