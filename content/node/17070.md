  body: "I've also been chasing this down and somehow it feels somewhere between Bodoni
    SH(SB?) and Bauer Bodoni by Elsner & Flake. Very close, but neither exactly match...
    unless there is a display version.\r\nThe lower case \"f\" of the sample is narrower
    and tapers towards the top more \"gracefully\" than the others. Or is that just
    the optical foreshortening caused by the curl of the magazine's spine?\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/sample_lc.png]supplied

    it's not it either.\r\nPatty, Stephen... any other suggestions where to look?"

  body: "I think the Linotype Bauer Bodoni I originally linked to is closer than the
    Elsner & Flake version. It's slightly narrower, more like the Bodoni SH. They
    are all awfully close.\r\n\r\nI do think the f is foreshortened from the magazine
    spine.\r\n\r\nWhat is the difference between SB and SH anyway?"
