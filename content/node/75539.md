  body: "It's interesting to me to note that the DicSans shown in Atwe's link looks
    a bit different than the one on the book covers. Did anyone else think that too?\r\n\r\nThe
    shape of the 'a' in particular seems like a distinctive feature of the Moleskine
    lettering, but the 'a' in the PDF sample at Molotro Type seems not quite the same
    to me. I didn't examine other letters, but that one caught my eye.\r\n\r\n- Mike
