  font at the MoMA NY and would like to use it. Does anyone know what it is, and where
  I may be able to purchase it, please? \r\nRegards, \r\nTony[img:sites/default/files/old-images/photo_6410.JPG]"

    from CR8) or FontForge (Linux/Unix) on a freely-available Helvetica-style font
    (Free Sans bold, TeX Gyre Heros bold, URW Nimbus Sans bold -- all available under
    an open-source licence) to remove the centres from the letters you want all-black.\r\n\r\nIf
    you don't have the time, I reckon the blokes here can whip up a custom job for
    you. Likely to cost a small bit, but they'll know better than I."

    in \u201Cstate\u201D gets it, but not the \u201Ca\u201D in \u201Cwhatnot.\u201D
    And for some reason all the \u201Ce\u2019s\u201D survived unscathed."
