  4.6 for Macintosh User Manual - three-hole drilled with chicago screws\r\nScanFont
  4 for Macintosh User Manual - thermal bound\r\n\r\nThey're both letter-sized, digitally
  printed on bright white paper, with vinyl covers. Together, they weigh about 7 pounds
  and are yours if you pay for the shipping (from San Francisco, CA 94110) or get
  them from me in person.\r\n\r\nMessage me if you want 'em!\r\n\r\n- Amy, aka l'Abecedarienne\r\n"
