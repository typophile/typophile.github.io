  done but I was always curious as to whether he based his letters on fonts or if
  his initial stages of design was to use a specific font.\r\n\r\nBesides the obvious
  Capital F do any of you guys know of an ornate font that is similar to the \"ANT-MAS\"
  in the poster, or do you think that it is hand done?   \r\n\r\nhttp://www.burlesquedesign.com/store/p_fantomas.jpg\r\n\r\nCheers"
