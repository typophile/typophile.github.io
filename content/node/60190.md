body: "I'm involved in doing a reprint of a book where Janson Text was used with many
  long dashes throughout the writing. The font is absolutely correct except the long
  dashes are a tad bit shorter in the original text than those supplied in Linotype's
  1985 version of Janson Text. Is there an optimal way to shorten the dash? It's clearly
  longer than a hyphen but should be about 20% shorter than Linotype Janson's long
  dash. Replacing it with a smaller font size in every instance (400 pages) is the
  only option that comes to mind.\r\n\r\nI wonder if Nicholas Kis cut both dashes
  and hyphens in the originals, if there was a distinction back in the late 1700s.

    emdash\r\nReplace: emdash + char. width: 80% (you can specify this in the same
    window: Change Format Settings > Format > Advanced Character Format > Horizontal
    scale).\r\n\r\nHope this helps."

  body: Ah, no, I wasn't aware one can specify the emdash length. Thanks so much.
