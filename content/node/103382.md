body: "Hello!  I am not sure if this is a font or if it is a custom designed logo.
  \ It is a letter that I love, but would like to have as an \"H\" vs. the E.  Unfortunately,
  I do not have the font in any other letters of the alphabet.  Any guidance you can
  provide on what font it may be (or similar), or if you believe it to be a custom
  designed logo, I would appreciate! \r\n\r\nBest,\r\nHaley "
