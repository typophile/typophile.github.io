body: 'Why do external links to the Typophile forums/wiki always come up as Page not
  Found? Almost everytime I''m redirected via an external link to the Typophile forums
  I receive the Page Not Found page and it''s pretty frustrating. Lately, I was at
  Cameron Moll''s blog and he as several links to references thru Typophile and all
  of them are broke. Why is this happening, and is there anything that I can do as
  a member to keep if from happening to me? '

  body: I think this may have something to do with the way typophile was ported over
    to the new server??? old threads have all been renamed, so old links will be broken.
    you may want to email cameron and ask him to please update his links. i don't
    see any other reason why typophile links would show up as Page Not Found unless
    the address is incorrect.
