  parties in the college dorms, when they were the dorms staff. So thats why their
  company is name THE STAFF. They play latin, hip hop, techno, everything music. They
  have had this logo for about 2 or 3 years but they think its too boring and complicated
  to use. So i'm in charge of refreshing it.\r\n\r\nThis is my first proposal, i think
  it can work but at the same time i think something is missing.\r\n\r\nComments,
  suggestions and hard critique is always welcome :)"

  body: I like the old one better. I think the logo you've come up with is a little
    confusing and even misleading--the entire composition doesn't seem to 'grab' me
    the same way the other one does. I think you should play around with it or show
    us some variations so we can better help.

  body: "thank you! \r\n\r\n@fath, the problem with the old one is the usage, they
    cannot use the entire logo always, because of some brushes behind the St circle.\r\n\r\nIm
    posting the new proposals in a few hours for you to help me :)\r\n\r\nthank you
    guys..."

  body: "Hi again!! i was looking for some variations in typography and this are the
    ones i liked the most. At first i liked the round-chunky type i was using but
    i thought it could simplificate a little...until i got to #5...\r\n\r\nplease
    comment and critique which logo you like best :)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/progress-01_4626.png]\r\n"
