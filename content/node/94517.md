  body: "Hey, beggars can't be choosers.\r\n\r\nThe way I was trying to help you is
    by opining that this is probably a manipulation of a font; if so, you won't find
    it as a font, but you could redo the manipulations if you find the original font.\r\n\r\nYou
    see all those bulges? Flatten them out and then ask again - somebody might be
    able to figure out what font this <em>was</em>.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
