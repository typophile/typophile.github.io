  it's high time we started bringing back the medieval practice of coming up with
  shortcuts for writing common words. I write a journal nightly, and last March I
  came up with a few such ligatures. The original short list has grown a fair amount,

  forms. Maybe someday I'll bother to put them in a font that I make, but for now
  I just use the handwriting forms.\r\n\r\nHere's an example of them in action in

    parts are not the cumbersomely drawn type designs but the tiny bits above them
    which you\u2019ve actually written, this is where the music plays. In the designs
    you try to develop how this could look in formal type, alright. But these designs
    reveal that you are not familiar enough with the nature of type forms evolving
    from scribal forms. Many of them look artificial and constructed, not natural.\r\nMy
    advise would be: keep on with it. Exercise writing with a broad nib pen, study
    carefully and in extenso the works of Latin scribes. Study their way of writing
    (!!) abbreviations, and how those forms were subsequently transformed into cast
    type. Study the tiniest details of that with utmost care. You\u2019ll see by time,
    your own  inventions will get better by that.\r\n\r\nAnd look into Capelli (if
    you didn\u2019t already).\r\nLast but not least, s a member of MUFI I may also
    suggest that you have a look at the MUFI recommendation. There are many abbreviational

    cannot be readily deciphered and require conscious learning) and lament the loss
    of that practice in Greek typography. However focusing on spreading new handwritten
    forms would put this very high on the list of Things That Cannot Happen. Even
    introducing new typographic forms (which laymen only have to read, not make) is
    in Everestian challenge. And when you think about it, since handwriting <em>is</em>
    become far less relevant (although not threatened with extinction - organisms
    die, but concepts don't, at most they become dormant) why handicap the results?
    Simply make notan. Yes, it's harder to make-look-pretty, but it's also harder
    to eat brussels sprouts than chocolate cake.\r\n\r\nMost of all, the central question
    is always: Why? If you do this purely as an act of self-expression, that's not
    design, it's self-centered. Better would be to figure out how it could help other
    people. I think there very much is a readability advantage to heavy ligation (when
    done with a lucid and meticulous strategy) but it's very hard to leverage, and
    even harder to sell.\r\n\r\nThe one powerful weapon at your disposal is linguistic
    context: with the benefit of surrounding words even vaguely decipherable components
    can come together to deliver the content. But that does mean a ligation should
    only be deployed when there's enough context, otherwise the individual-letter
    version should show up. And that's not something our software does yet...\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    in the future. Basically, I figure I'll always be the only one using them, but
    I enjoy them, so that's enough for me. However, if someone else picked them up
    and started writing with them, I'd be absolutely tickled. I have a vague idea
    that someday I'll write a book and then set it in a font of my own designing and
    maybe use these. That's the only thing I can think of that might even have half
    a chance of popularizing the ligatures, but I don't really believe it would. I
    guess it might make me a little bit more memorable as an author, though.\r\n\r\nAndreas,
    I looked at the MUFI code chart and there's some really interesting stuff in there.
    My initial reaction was going to be, \"these ligatures are different from the
    old ligatures, because I don't have the same handwriting or circumstances as any
    of the old-time scribes. These ligatures are based on me, not the medieval.\"
    And I guess that can hold true for the handwritten forms. But looking at the symbols
    in MUFI, a lot of them do have a certain elegance to them that my drawings don't.
    If I decide to put these in an actual font, I'll take another look at MUFI. And
    someday I'll have a broad-nibbed pen to practice with.\r\n\r\nWhat's Capelli?
    And Hrant, what's notan? All I get from Google is the design principle of alternating
    dark and light, but that doesn't seem to make sense. And T\xE9, I'd love to find
    out more about the German economic script. That wouldn't be S\xFCtterlin, would

    does make sense is instead defining the relationship of the blacks and whites
    (notan) which can only be done \"purely\" by drawing the boundary between the
    two. So I would base the compounds not on how you'd [be forced to] originate their
    bodies by hand, but how their notan would best serve a purpose.\r\n\r\nHowever,

    contractions were encoded in Unicode, because mediaevalists wanted to be able
    to transcribe diplomatics as plain text. But it seems to me a poor solution, because
    a) the set is limited to the most common contractions so only works for some documents
    and not others, and b) ignores Gothic and Greek abbreviations that scholars also
    need to deal with. I recently made a font for transcribing diplomatics of both
    Greek and Latin Byzantine seals and coins, for which the encoded mediaevalist
    characters were no use at all. So we handle everything with just regular Greek
    and Latin characters, and the scholars use XML to mark up the diplomatic in the
    transcription, which is then displayed via OpenType Layout features.\r\n\r\n<a
    href=\"http://people.mozilla.org/~jdaggett/tests/byzantineseal.html\">Here is
    a sample</a>. Note S-like shape in the diplomatic transcription of the obverse
    side that is actually a contraction for '\u039A\u0391\u0399', which becomes apparent
    if you copy and paste the text into a plain text editor.</a>\r\n\r\n[The term
    'diplomatic' refers to a transcription that represents the appearance of the original
    text, rather than its meaning. When seals and coins are published, it is usually
    with both kinds of transcription.]"

    the fact that these ligatures, or any other form of \"heavy ligation\", is not
    likely to come into general use any time soon. What you have done can still be
    useful, rather than merely self-indulgent, even if all it does is serve as an
    inspiration to others who might go on to produce something practical.\r\n\r\nSince
    heavy ligation adds to the burden of learning how to read and write, even if it
    makes the task easier after the learning is completed, that is a major strike
    against it. We want children to learn to read and write as quickly as possible,
    so that while myelinization of the brain is not yet completed they have as much
    time as possible available for other learning.\r\n\r\n(Ultimately, I think we're
    going to want to genetically modify ourselves so that our brains don't stop growing
    at age 2, and so that myelinization is postponed to reflect the fact that we spend
    more of our lives learning, and start doing later on. Why would we do that? Because
    some people - including some of those likely to be in positions of power - feel
    we need more advanced science, more advanced mathematics, than we now have. In

    as derived from a ligature of \u017F and s, I can't get excited over its loss
    as \"cultural damage\"; not all typefaces used for setting English have the ff,
    fi, ffi, fl, and ffl ligatures - and most typefaces dropped the ct and st ligatures
    ages ago - and no one complains about that.\r\n\r\nIf the Dutch suddenly decided
    that \"ij\" is just a digraph of two separate letters, and not a letter in any
    sense whatever, would this be \"cultural damage\"?\r\n\r\nWhile I don't think
    that the Germans are under any obligation to drop the \xDF to avoid confusing
    foreigners, if the increasing level of contact between speakers of different languages
    means that this unique feature of German is confusing or too much bother or whatever,
    I don't see this as a harmful form of homogenization.\r\n\r\nWhen it comes to
    the x-height of Armenian typefaces, I tend to take the opposite view, and root
    for the retention of Bolorgir tendencies, because in that case I can't see that
    anything is gained in making one script look like another.\r\n\r\nIf the Armenians,
    on the other hand, switched to the Latin alphabet, then there would be a gain
    which <em>might</em> make the cultural loss worthwhile. But a very limited gain
    - since, after all, this wouldn't make anyone understand the Armenian language
    who didn't do so already. And the Armenian script has no inherent legibility issues.\r\n\r\nWhen
    it comes to the Hebrew alphabet, I could see switching to Latin as advisable.
    But of course it won't happen, because the cultural concerns are intense with
    a tie to religion. However, the ancient script was much more legible, and so a
    \"trued-up\" version of ancient Phoenician (unlike the nightmare Romanized versions
    of the Hebrew square script suggested by Gill and Schoenfeld, which I cannot in
    good conscience recommend) might be a possibility."
