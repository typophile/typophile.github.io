body: "I'm trying to write a program which has to parse a TTF/OTF file's KERN table,
  search through the subtables until it finds a format 0 subtable, and extract the
  kerning pairs.\r\n\r\nIt seems to work OK as long as the format 0 subtable is the
  first and only one (which seems to be the case for all the fonts I have).  However,
  I have doubts about the reliability of my logic to skip past multiple subtables
  of differing types.  I definitely need to test this functionality.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately,
  I don't seem to have any fonts which have multiple kerning subtables.  Does anyone
  know where I can find one?  Specifically, a TrueType (or OpenType/TT) font which
  contains multiple subtables in the KERN directory, (and preferably where the very
  first subtable is not format 0).\r\n"

  body: Thanks.  I've examined both Brill and EBGaramond; neither one appears to have
    a KERN table.  Indeed, Brill appears to be exclusively an OpenType/PS (CFF) font,
    which means by definition it can't have one.  I assume they both define kerning
    via GPOS instead...

    and should be present in previous OS X releases as well."

  body: "Thanks.  I suspect most such fonts are indeed going to be found on Apple
    platforms.  I'll see if I can track some down.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, however,
    I think I've managed to improve my logic so it should at least fail gracefully
    if it can't parse the tables as expected."
