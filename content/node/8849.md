body: I made a small TrueType style-linked family of fonts &#40;Rg, It, Bd, BdIt&#41;
  which work fine on my Mac, but when i test it on Win, Italic is displayed as a Regular
  &#40;in WordPad&#41;, or Italic in unavailable &#40;in Word&#41;. I have tripple
  checked the naming, and all seems to be fine. I suppose it has somehting to do with
  the &#60;head&#62; information, and i see how macStyle has to be set. Where is windows
  styling set? is there a bit i can change? <BR> <BR>Another problem i have with this
  family is inconsitant interlinear spacing. When i change the styles, the vertical
  lenght of the text changes, although the lineGap, ascend, and descent values are
  identical in all four fonts. Would anyone know what else can be a reason for such
  behaviour? I&#39;ve spent a couple of nights trying to work it out, and i think
  i am at the limit on my own possibilities. Thanks for listening.

  body: Font styling on Windows is entirely name based. It is difficult to suggest
    what might be wrong without looking at the fonts. If you want to send me the fonts,
    Peter, I&#39;ll check them for you. <BR> <BR>Regarding the interlinear spacing,
    see my <a href="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/4101/53053.html">recommended

  body: 'Thanks for sending the fonts, Peter. It took me a little while to spot the
    problem: the regular and italic fonts had different weight classes in the OS/2
    table: the regular had &#39;Medium&#39; weight &#40;500&#41; and the italic had
    &#39;Normal&#39; weight &#40;400&#41;. I set the regular font to 400 also, and
    the fonts work correctly. <BR> <BR>Windows apparently won&#39;t recognise an italic
    variant if it has a different weight class from the roman. <BR> <BR>I&#39;ve sent
    you Font Validator reports on all four fonts, which you will want to review, as
    there are some minor bugs in other areas.'
