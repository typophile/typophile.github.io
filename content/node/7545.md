    You seem to be working in the right direction. Which definition is the word &#34;resound&#34;
    referencing? An echo or being filled with sound? Have you considered any clever
    ways of incorporating one of those definitions? I guess I&#39;m just not sinking

    on their original&#40;primordial <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"

    It is rather confusing how to read it. On #2 I tried to give another vision of
    their old &#34;design&#34;.  <BR>You are right about #5. It surely is like a lighting
    company, but the effect was rather pleasant, so I used it just to bulge the number
    of variations. <BR> <BR>To Scott :  <BR>&#62;&#62; The name is &#34;resoundnet&#34;,
    right? Why all the emphasis on RE-NET?  <BR>&#60;&#60; Yes, that is the correct
    name of the company and the way they want it to appear. The emphasis on Re-net
    is connected with their company policy. I don&#39;t know what exactly it means,
    but it is a Must. <BR> <BR>&#62;&#62;Which definition is the word &#34;resound&#34;
    referencing? An echo or being filled with sound? Have you considered any clever
    ways of incorporating one of those definitions? <BR>&#60;&#60; I am delving into
    the sounds right now and trying to incorporate another form, because this radio
    waves are trite nowadays. On most of the variations I tried to use it, because
    I knew that it was going to correspond to the client more delicately. <BR> <BR>&#62;&#62;
    I guess I&#39;m just not sinking my teeth into any of your current solutions yet.
    <BR>&#60;&#60; I will post some new design after day or so. <BR> <BR>Note : The
    client&#39;s expectations are not so high, so I guess something simple will do
    the trick. <BR> <BR>If you want to comment more on the variations, which I posted
    so far - feel free to do it.'

    You can&#39;t make two names with equal emphsis and expect anything but confussion.
    I&#39;m confussed, pick one name! Use the one that the consumers write the check

  body: I don&#39;t think there was anything offensive in Tanya&#39;s post. She was
    simply stating a principle many of us learned in design school and is relevant
    to your post - if it doesn&#39;t work in B&amp;W its not going to work in colour
    so work out the black and white version first. That makes it much easier to see
    the balance and shape of the design as well as the spacing.

  body: Galin, I don&#39;t think Tanya meant anything personal. Those of us who were
    trained pre-internet typically have a different perspective on rules and traditions
    of design. I used to feel pretty strongly about making designs work in black and
    white too, in fact, I still work that way most of the time; however, with the
    advent of the internet, there are businesses that exist soley online that have
    virtually no printed media support. With this understanding I have compromised
    my stand on the black and white approach to those types of businesses. <BR> <BR>The
    real disappointment comes when there is no preliminary thinking on paper &#40;concepting,
    sketching&#41;. My current mindset is that if the concepts are worked out on paper
    first, then the black and white approach has been applied sufficiently. <BR> <BR>As

    she expresses herself&#42; strongly, but not necessarily directly at individuals.
    If you can manage to put that in context, you&#39;ll benefit more from good advice.
    BTW, looking in your profile I see that your personal quote is &#34;Express yourself&#34;!  :-&#41;

  body: '&#42;aww shucks thanks Hrant - been too busy lately that&#39;s all. <BR>
    <BR>Anyway - won&#39;t bother defending my comments as most of you have done nicely
    already.  <BR> <BR>I have nothing against gradients per say - just gradients in
    a corporate identity. So least I explain why a bit further. <BR> <BR>Beyond the
    fact that most times they are a cheap effect with little to no purpose in relation
    to the company, they are also hard to reproduce or very expensive for the company
    to reproduce in various media&#39;s and materials. Automatically you can&#39;t
    make a stamp, it won&#39;t be clear on fax coversheets and will lose detail on
    photocopies. Vinyl cuts &#40;for the neon sign or office storefront&#41; will
    be difficult and expensive. The logo itself won&#39;t be the same in reverse for
    say if the logo is being placed in a newspaper or magazine ad on a black background...ect
    ect. there are many reasons why this has been a general rule of thumb - and some
    people do break them but you should have a very, I repeat very strong reason for
    doing so. It is intrinsically related to the company - this effect? Is the company
    rich enough to reproduce it well? If not ...your going to get upset the day you
    see your logo basterdized or poorly displayed.  <BR> <BR>If all one care&#39;s
    about is its&#39; display on screen because it&#39;s an internet thing well your
    design won&#39;t last come the day &#40;if it comes&#41; when your client goes
    public. I&#39;d plan for your clients future in order to help them succeed - cause
    well...that&#39;s our business.  <BR> <BR>just some thoughts.'

  body: Galin, you would do yourself a big favor to work with other professionals,
    like marketing people. They could rationalize creating one name idenity. I would
    take the approach of tiering the idenity, like Resound a division of ReNet. This
    allows the consumer a heirarcy of understanding. What your client is asking is
    to create a blivit. Ten pounds of s_ _ _ _ in a five pound bag.  <BR> <BR>If your
    client won&#39;t listen to professional advice then they don&#39;t respect you
    and you will make tons of hours of work and you won&#39;t get paid. <BR> <BR>Tanya
