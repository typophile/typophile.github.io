  the font is that National Geographic is now using for their TV Channel. All of their
  ad spots, branding, etc., have this wonderful sans serif font that I can't quite
  figure out what it is.\r\n\r\nThe site is here: http://channel.nationalgeographic.com/\r\n\r\nI've
  also attached an image for your viewing pleasure as well.\r\n\r\nThanks for your
  help!\r\n"
