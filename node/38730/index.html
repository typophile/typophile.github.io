  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>Hi,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m starting thinking my question are boring but I&rsquo;m curious and new in the (fantastic) world of typography.</p>
<p>So, my last question concerned the choose of a typeface for a novel book body. Now I&rsquo;m asking how much the ligatures are important in a book.</p>
<p>Can ligatures influence the choose of a font?
I just found the font &ldquo;Esta&rdquo; (&ldquo;Esta ligatures&rdquo;) with a large number of ligatures (e.g. for s+h, s+t, s+k, f+r, f+y etc. etc. etc.).</p>
<p>Do you know other typefaces with similar range of ligatures, suitable for a novel book body?</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

		<div class="commentbody">The most important thing about a font is not if it has ligatures or not. If it does have them then you aught to ask - is this better than not having them - eg is this an improvement? And if it doesn&rsquo;t, does it suffer from not having them? There are plenty of fonts that have poorly designed ligatures so having ligatures and even larger numbers of ligatures are not a mark of quality per se. Quality has to do with if the font supports reading - this applies to the ligatures as much as any other aspect. Learning which fonts support reading &amp; which ones don&rsquo;t can take time. The other relevant question has to do with the tone struck by the font when set in text. Of course a good fit with the paper to be used in the book is an issue too.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I must admit ligatures, especially historical forms like st-ligs etc. seem to ba a bit of a flovor of the month/year thing to me, especially since OT. I agree with Eben, ligatures do not improve legibility/readability per se. It&rsquo;s just that some faces actually need them to set properly, some don&rsquo;t (which in return doesn&rsquo;t make either better than the other, per se). To me Ligatures just seem to be a bit of an overestimated topic as of late. Like Eben, i&rsquo;d choose a typeface rather going by things like content, style, tone/color, and yes, sometimes by era. If you&rsquo;ve come that far, then you can still look if the font actually includes all the ligatures you might need and if thery&rsquo;re well drawn. To me giving the sheer number of ligatures first priority in chosing a typeface is like bying a car just because it features an ashtray while others don&rsquo;t.</div>

<p>Has anyone done any research into whether or not quaints actually detract from legibility? Personally, I can’t help but stop to notice them in many typefaces, but that might just be my type-geek tendencies. I wonder if the general public find it annoying every time <!-- raw HTML omitted -->st<!-- raw HTML omitted --> or <!-- raw HTML omitted -->ct<!-- raw HTML omitted --> pop out at them?</p>

		<div class="commentbody">With the old style typefaces I find that the f-series of ligatures, besides being necessary in most instances, add a suble elegance to the typeset copy without being distracting. But I&rsquo;d avoid the st, ct etc. ligatures, which draw too much attention to themselves in body copy (at least today; maybe four hundred years ago readers were used to them). Many typefaces, however, are designed such that ligatures aren&rsquo;t required; in such cases, an fi ligature, for instance would look silly (e.g. Trump Mediaeval).</div>

<p>I am going to have to disagree. Not emphatically, but gently. Using a rule of thumb rather than looking &amp; deciding on a case by case basis may work most of the time but it&rsquo;s not ideal.</p>
<p>The goodness or badness of a ligature for text is always on the same basis - &lsquo;does it solve a problem in a way that supports reading&rsquo;. BTW some classic &lsquo;st&rsquo; &amp; &lsquo;ct&rsquo; ligs I have seen are quite thin and don&rsquo;t distract too much. And actually they may have even supported reading. Where as &lsquo;st&rsquo; &amp; &lsquo;ct&rsquo; ligs that were made after they fell from common use were I think made for a different reason - to attract attention &amp; look old. My guess is that the different motivation resulted in a showy presentation - and so they are not good for reading. But they were probably good for making a sign look &lsquo;old&rsquo; - maybe. Also, depending on the design you might get a nice sy lig for instance. Keep in mind too - just because it hasn&rsquo;t been done doesn&rsquo;t mean that it cannot be done.</p>
<p>There is also such a thing as a Spontaneous Ligature - where letters are allowed to overlap but retain their basic design. I know Verdana has at least one.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I agree with your statement &lsquo;does it solve a problem in a way that supports reading&rsquo;. And what I meant before, I don&rsquo;t think ct/st/etc ligs are <!-- raw HTML omitted -->important<!-- raw HTML omitted --> for book body type (which was the original question), you don&rsquo;t <!-- raw HTML omitted -->need<!-- raw HTML omitted --> them for legibility. At least not as much as some of the other ligatures; c and t do not collide into each other, and they are perfectly legible on their own. A loop between those letters, no matter how thin, attract (my) attention. :)</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve read a book a while ago set in a Garamond-like typeface which for some reason had ligatures turned off (I guess), and the f collided with the b, h and other f&rsquo;s, and it was really distracting in my opinion. I think it was so apparent, that even non-typophiles would see it.</p>
<p>But I guess if you look at it on a case by case basis, there might be occasions where more different ligatures are appropriate. But I still think that such a decision would probably be made on a stylistic basis (to make something &lsquo;look old&rsquo; or &lsquo;luxurious&rsquo;) rather than for legibility. But maybe I&rsquo;m wrong. I haven&rsquo;t read any studies about ligatures in long text, if there are any. :)</p>

		<div class="commentbody">I&rsquo;m probably just echoing what others have said, but in general I find historical ligatures distracting in anything more than a couple of paragraphs. Generally designers make the connecting loop to round or large and this bothers me both as someone reading and a designer. I think it does slow readers down if the ligatures are poorly designed because they create uncommon word shapes.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">The basic f-series ligatures are necessary to avoid clumsy collision combos, but there is another form of collision which you can avoid manually. When an italicized word is followed by a punctuation mark other than a period, that punctuation mark should always be italic too, otherwise italic slams into upright roman. Not everyone agrees with this, but I insist on it as a style point in my books.</div>

<p>Recognizability is also important. Will a layman reader or even a reader with slight visual impairment be able to discern two characters tied to together? Will fl be seen as a funny capital A? An oddity?</p>
