body: "Hi\r\nI'm working on the graphic design for an exhibition at a museum. There
  are going to be some rather long text on posters hanging in the exhibition room.
  What i need is a typeface  that looks ok when set quite large (24pt +++) and also
  is easy to read. sans or serif; I don't know yet. I have used Avenir for other parts
  of the exhibition, and it works great. The typeface i'm looking for this time doesn't
  need to compliment  avenir in any way. Anyone?\r\n\r\nThanks:)\r\n\r\nbest regards,
  \r\n\r\nalex"
