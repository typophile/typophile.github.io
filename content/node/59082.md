  Design. So far I know that Art Deco movement was influenced by Mesoamerican Art.
  Do you know other movements, designers, typographers or graphic artist that were
  influenced by Aztec culture?\r\n\r\nthank you very much in advance\r\n\r\ni."

  body: Josef Albers was interested in Pre-Columbia civilizations, but I'm not sure
    about the Aztecs specifically. And <a href=http://kimeratype.com/>Gabriel Garcia
    Meave</a> has a number of typefaces inspired by the Aztecs and other such civilizations.

    Garcia Meave and Leonardo Vasquez, both from the DF, gave a great presentation

    in Pre-Columbian civilizations; I\u2019ll look forward to find any relation with
    the Aztecs.\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s a shame that can\u2019t go to the ATypI conferences;
    I\u2019m from Mexico City but this year I\u2019m studding abroad, why they didn\u2019t
    do one year ago or in one year time ;(\r\n"

  body: "Correction: the right name is Gabriel Mart\xEDnez Meave. Maybe you are confusing
    him with Gabriel Garc\xEDa M\xE1rquez, the well known Colombian writer. By the
    way, Garc\xEDa M\xE1rquez has a Mexican son who happens to be a graphic designer
    and type designer, [[http://www.gonzalogarciabarcha.com/gallery.asp?gallery_id=3337|Gonzalo
    Garc\xEDa Barcha]], but he\u2019s more interested in colonial era. Gonzalo has
    Mexican Motifs, a dingbat font who includes some pre-hispanic icons, though.\r\n\r\nAbout
    the question: I think the biggest Aztec influence in graphic design is in Mexican
    designers. Since nineteenth century, Mexican people has thought that Aztec past
    is the most authentic source for \u201Cmexicanity\u201D (a desperate attempt for
    erasing the Spaniard, <em>conquistador</em> roots). Because of this, a lot of
    artists have identified themselves with Aztec world (Diego Rivera, Jes\xFAs de
    la Helguera, Jos\xE9 Obreg\xF3n, Jos\xE9 Clemente Orozco\u2026). A book about
    this: Enrique Florescano, <em>Im\xE1genes de la patria</em>, Mexico, Taurus, 2006.\r\n\r\nAt
    little scale, the same is for Mexican graphic designers. It is not my specialty,
    but as far as I know, graphic designers outside Mexico are/were not much interested
    in Aztecs. But certainly you could write to Gabriel Mart\xEDnez Meave: I am sure
    he can tell better than me. You can find his e-mail address at kimeratype.com.mx"

  body: "Srpatron,\r\npolish graphic design, sculpture and architecture of 20's and
    30's were strongly influenced by Aztec patterns. It was a time of searching some
    kind of national style as a Modern interpretation of \"folklority\". Designers
    used motivs taken from polish and ethnic minorities' (eg. Huculs) art, and blended
    them with mesoamerican details to get stronger feeling of antiquity or tribality.\r\nThis
    eclectic style, half avant-garde, half decorative, transformed before the ww2
    into a government style.\r\nThe best example of the style's flavour is \"Seasons\",
    a painting by Zofia Stryje\u0144ska:\r\n[[http://www.culture.pl/pl/culture/artykuly/wy_wy_stryjenska_poznan]]"

  body: "There are many examples of \"Aztec\" (prehispanic is more accurate) aesthetic
    implementation on the \"institutional\" architecture, graphics and sculpture from
    the 30's to the 80's. A kind of exquisite brutalism was the signature style of
    the national identity. If you want a much more figurative example look at the
    Ciudad Universitaria original buildings like the Central Library or the Dean's
    Tower.\r\n\r\nI think that the strongest influence lies on the people's taste.
    Take blackletter as an example, it is not prehispanic but it has this brutal and
    exquisite character which made it popular in M\xE9xico.\r\n\r\nAlso take a look
    into Gabriel's personal site http://www.meave.org/Site/intro.html\r\n\r\nPaco
    Calderon, the cartoonist, who is also very talented has some strips representing
