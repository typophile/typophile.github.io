body: "Hi Everyone, I've been trying to match my logo with a font for a while now,
  figured I'd ask here for suggestions seeing as there are so many pro's. I have a
  simple blackletter ambigram logo, picture a Lucida Blackletter connected to itself
  flipped, kinda like this: e\u01DD, to make the initials es with a cursive s. My
  problem is pairing this symbol with a good font for my name and other info on my
  business card and potentially my resume. Until now I've been using Helvetica 67
  condensed medium, which is just to bland for me to keep using. Can anyone give me
  some pointers or suggestions on pairing fonts with blackletters? "

  body: "Hi,\r\n\r\ngenerally speaking, I think there are these 2 ways to go:\r\n\r\n1:
    you try to find something very close to your logo type/lettering\r\n\r\nor\r\n\r\n2:
    you make sure the two typefaces are easily distinguished from each other so\r\na)
    the mix won\u2019t be mistaken as unintentional and\r\nb) you don\u2019t risk
    to go too busy with your logo.\r\n\r\nIn your case only no. 2 makes sense I guess,
    so I would go for something clean and straightforward. I once used FF DIN with
    a bold blackletter and it turned out to match quite well.\r\nMeta can also look
    good with blackletter, although I\u2019d rather go for FF DIN since it has almost
    no (visible) contrast (which I think works better with a vertically stressed blackletter)\r\n\r\nThat
    said, an ambigram consisting of two letters (if i got you right) is much more
    forgiving in terms of pairing than longer blackletter text.\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\nJ\xF6rg"

  body: "Wow, what happened to my Umlaut! Hehe, anyway\u2026\r\n\r\nEsteban,\r\nI
    think the pc-de font is way too individuated (don\u2019t know if this is the right
    word) to be paired with your ambigram, it distracts from your initials and the
    other way round. The eye is struggling and it takes way too long to get what is
    actually written there.\r\n\r\nI\u2019d rather look for a font more suitable for
    text since otherwise you\u2019d have to bring in a third typeface for letters
    etc. Did you think about a font for letters?\r\n\r\nI\u2019m struggling with the
    \u2018s\u2019 in your ambigram. I still keep reading it as \u2019ee\u2019, with
    one \u2019e\u2019 flipped over. Maybe it\u2019ll work if you smoothen the broken
    forms? Right now, they look wrong in the \u2018s\u2019.\r\nThat said, the flipped
    e sits too high (optically), I\u2019d move it down a bit to get a more balanced
    look.\r\nYou could also try to open the counters by cutting the diagonals BEFORE
    they hit the curve instead of lengthening them, I think the \u2018s\u2019 and
    the whole mark would benefit from that.\r\n\r\nAnd I don\u2019t think that \u2018framing\u2019
    your ambigram with your name is a good idea (unless you make it an ambigram, too,
    but I guess this would be sth of a reach). Did you try to put your name beneath
    it? Or next to it? Single-line? Two-line? Try every composition you can think
    of and boot out what doesn\u2019t work. It\u2019s the only way to find out.\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\nJ\xF6rg"

  body: "Thanks for the input J\xF6rg, I agree that framing the mark was negative
    for the readability. I liked that it looked like one big square, one visual unit,
    but I wouldn't even bother to read my own name, I just knew it was there.\r\n\r\nIn
    terms of modifying the mark, I've made some quick unrefined changes that I would
    like you to look at. I agree to an extent about the \"s\" sitting too high optically.
    I think I will be able to lower it and have the 2 forms staggered a little bit.
    I don't think I like the idea of ending the bowl diagonal before the curve, I
    think that for the \"s\" it is crucial to have that bit extend in order to imply
    a cursive letterform. Anyways take a look and let me know what you think, I am
    doing some type studies for the rest of my name. For letters I use Helvetica condensed
    a lot, i use it on my letterhead and stationary, I like it because of the endless
    options. However, I don't think I will use it for my logo, it seems to plain for
    me, tooo neutral.\r\n\r\nEsteban\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/ES_MODIFIED_6380.png]"

    be a symbol, not really a type choice, if I go with CPmono for a font, like I
    have it shown, and use helvetica for other body copy, is that too much font difference?
