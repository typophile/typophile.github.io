  body: "\"Fashion\"  is such a weasel word. A cool logo for a target clientele of
    50+ with about $100,000 disposable income per year could be quite different from
    one for 25 year olds with $30,000. Also it could be quite different for a new
    line of dressy shoes, tailored suits, or Lolita look outfits, to name only a few.
    If it's to cover a wide range of categories, this might push the logo towards
    those that already exist.\r\nAnyway these sort of deals can only work where there
    is a clear understanding of what the client wants to achieve. Only then can someone
    say I have what it takes to make this work, or nah, I'll pass on this one.\r\nDon"

  body: "> Ok, but perhaps they might know someone who is? :)\r\n\r\nSome of the folks
    here might do a fine job, just follow the normal procedure of asking to see examples
    of other logos they've designed. You might also want to post your notice at graphic
    design sites, and also check with some of the local design firms in your city.
    \r\n\r\nIn my opinion, two weeks to design a logo is rushing it if you want to
    do a proper job. You may go through several rounds of concepts and several rounds
    of revisions. "
