  body: "Hi (from an amateur typographer, but take it as you wish). \r\nSo here it
    goes.\r\n\r\nYour font has a <strong>nice horizontal flowing feeling</strong>
    to it yet you should <strong>improve one or two things</strong>:\r\n\r\n- The
    <strong>lower stem+belly connection on the \"b\" and \"d\"</strong> should get
    fixed, as in a simplified curve from the base to the stem instead of a complex
    stem to curve intersection (specially the \"b\"). It would prevent it to be a
    \"brake\" in the horizontal flow of the line. <em>On the other hand your font
    will get \"rounder\"...</em>\r\n\r\n- The other thing is <strong>the horizontal
    bar on the \"a\", the \"e\" and specially the \"3\"</strong>. There are to many
    curves. It gives your characters a <em>blurry look</em>. Probaly if you eliminate
    the top or the bottom curve joint of the inner intersection it'll lighten up without
    loosing the design.\r\n\r\nI think you can develop a very nice font if you keep
    it up. <strong>I specially like the \"z\".</strong>\r\n\r\nKeep it up!\r\nCheers.\r\n\r\nBy
    the way,\r\n<ul><cite>its still heavy WIP as you see</cite></ul>\r\nwhat's WIP???"
