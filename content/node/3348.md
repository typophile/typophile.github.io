  is ...  <BR> <BR>Maybe we need a contest of type design, here in Typophile, why
  not?  <BR> <BR>The designs in the critique section are in a highest level, enough
  to take people like Pyrus on the prizes &#40;Fontlab, Bitfonter..&#41;, &amp; Myfonts
  with a nice contract.. <BR> <BR>I Wanna win, dont you ;&#41; ? <BR> <BR>Miguel H. '

  body: ' It&acute;s a fact. T-26, Thirstype, PsyOps, FontFont, the list is great
    but, how can we start this kind of Idea? The most creative future typographers
    are outhere, the prizes are an important think, for me is not easy to imagine
    a contest who shows the typophile spirit, there are many experimental fonts under
    construction here, and many categories, the chance to win is too atractive to
    any typophiler if ...happens ! '
