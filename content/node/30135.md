body: "I know this problem has been discussed before. Google advanced search is not
  my friend today. I have an InDesign CS2 file. I am using Tyfa from Storm in Postscript
  Type 1. (client does not have license to Opentype version.) The small caps are going
  to jibberish when I output to a PDF. Any ideas? Do you know where the other thread
  is? \r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n"

  body: I had this too once, the small caps - which was part of the font, not a "small
    caps" setting - came out bitmapped. But this was from Quark 6, not Indesign.

  body: "You were using Tyfa?\r\n\r\nYeah. It is a separate font file. So frustrating.
    Probably wouldn't happen if I could use the OT version. Grrrr."

    and running the .ps file through Distiller? \r\n\r\nBesides that, I got nothing.
    PDFs and font embedding confuses the hell out of me. I have heard of some issue
    with Central European Type 1 fonts and PDFs generated from InDesign CS.\r\n\r\nGood
    luck!"

  body: "No I was using Today Sans. But it was so frustrating - it printed fine but
    in the pdf it looked like hell. I ended up saving the files as .eps and opening
    them (page by page - luckily there were only 6 pages) in Illustrator, re-saving
    as a pdf. Pain in my butt.\r\n\r\nI'm having lots of tech problems right now,
    Mercury must be back in retrograde."

  body: "I had forgotten this happened before. Frantisek was kind enough to assist
    me with OT versions. However, as I've mentioned I have to us PS Type 1 for this
    project.\r\n\r\nWhat is apparently happening is some bad encoding. Oh poodles!"

    WORKED!

  body: "Have any of you ever had a problem with the letterforms being okay (not bitmapped
    as patty described above) but the order of the keystrokes changed? \r\n\r\nIn
    2001 I did a 256-page large-format book, heavy to text. Thomson Shore was the
    printer and  wanted it as PDF rather than native Quark files. Fine by me. I printed
    to Postscript and ran Distiller, and sent the job off. Didn't bother to proofread
    the PDF because I had just had a complete read done on the latest set of corrected
    page proofs (those proofs printed from Quark). \r\n\r\nWhen I got the printed
    books back, to my complete horror, on one page the text changed from -- they'd
    hoped -- to -- they \u2018d hoped. [Not sure how easy it is for you to see this
    on-screen, but instead of the first word having y-apostrophe-d, it was y-space-singleopenquote-d.]\r\n\r\nI
    went back to check my native Quark file and it was fine. \r\n\r\nThis experience
    made me permanently distrustful of sending files off in PDF form without YET another
    round of proofing. Made me look careless as the typesetter, when in fact I had
    been scrupulously careful to have a complete professional read done before converting
    to PDF (in addition to prior proofreading work earlier in the project).\r\n\r\nHas
    anyone else had this experience?"

    font encoding gone awry.\r\n\r\n(I still owe you at least 3 replies via e-mail.)"

  body: No but I had my H&Js go missing once, creating some truly horrible line breaks
    and rivers. But that was an earlier earlier version, probably before even Acrobat
    4.

    with Cocon. This happens especially with Freehand (yes, I know... but some clients
    still insist on using it). Some days the only way around it is to convert text
    to outlines. Good job there are usually only a few pages!"
