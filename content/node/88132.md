  of Find my Font, about 3 month ago here:\r\nhttp://typophile.com/node/84965\r\n\r\nIn
  fact, many of the features added in our new release 2.3.01, are based in your comments
  and much more of your comments are also carefully examined and prioritized for a
  future release. Many thanks for that!\r\n\r\n<strong>So, what's new in Find my Font
  v2.3.01?</strong>\r\n\r\n<strong>1. Minor improvements on Font Image Identification
  & UI</strong>\r\n\r\n[[http://www.findmyfont.com/images/stories/fmf/screenshots/FMF-Win-Connected-Letters.png|<img

  for bigger image]]\r\n\r\n<strong>(a)</strong> Improvement in font matching speed\r\n<strong>(b)</strong>
  Matching list shows more similar fonts\r\n<strong>(c)</strong> Added Horizontal
  & Vertical splitters to the 4 main screen areas\r\n<strong>(d)</strong> Added context
  sensitive menu (right click) on all font lists to:\r\nOpen / Locate font file /
  Install font / Browse for Specific Family / Copy font name / Copy font path\r\n<strong>(e)</strong>
  More accurate remaining time estimate\r\n<strong>(f)</strong> Added font's copyright
  info in font details area\r\n<strong>(g)</strong> Fixed screen capture bug on Mac
  OS/X Lion\r\n<strong>(h)</strong> Made Splitter tool Sticky, to perform multiple
  cuts\r\n\r\n<strong>2. New feature: Browse fonts by Visual Similarity</strong>\r\n\r\n[[http://www.findmyfont.com/images/stories/fmf/screenshots/FMF-Win-Browse.png|<img

  for bigger image]]\r\n\r\nApart from Find my Font main functionality -to identify
  fonts in images- many of you have said that \"it's a unique & different way to browse
  your font collection\", therefore I think you will love this new feature.\r\n\r\nYou
  may now browse for fonts on your computer by typing a part of a font's name. \r\nThe
  program displays a list with fonts that contain that word in their family name or
  font style. You can then render a custom text preview using any of the browsed fonts.\r\n\r\n<strong>The
  good news is, the font-matching button is still active:\r\nThis way you can find
  fonts that are visually similar to the browsed font, according to the letters you
  specify!\r\nWe think this as an important and invaluable feature for Font Designers,
  Graphic Designers and Type Enthusiasts.</strong>\r\n\r\nAs always, you can compare
  the different editions and download a 30-days free trial on this page: <strong>[[http://www.findmyfont.com/index.php/download/compare-editions|Find
  my Font Editions Comparison]]</strong>\r\n\r\nAll typophile users already having
  a promo-code/license can download Find my Font Pro v2.3.01 by going to the following
  page and entering your license number: <strong>[[http://www.findmyfont.com/index.php/members/product-update|Members
  - Update (to latest version)]]</strong>\r\n\r\nI will be really glad to read your
  comments/critique about the new features and especially the \"Browse Font by Visual
  Similarity\" functionality.\r\n \r\nThank you again for your time,\r\nand your valuable
  feedback.\r\n\r\nFivos Vilanakis\r\nSoftware Engineer\r\nSoftonium Developments\r\n\r\nProduct

  body: "Hey Fivos, I was just thinking about FindMyFont yesterday.\r\n\r\nGreat that
    there's a new version, I don't know why, but I had a little trouble with the first
    one on my workhorse XP machine and just didn't have the time to figure out what
    was wrong.\r\n\r\nWill get you some feedback very quickly. I'm working with a
    small, but always growing, open-source font library, and we can definitely use
    something like this.\r\n\r\nRich"

  body: "Hi Rich,\r\n\r\nwe don't have any issue reports from our clients regarding
    Windows XP.\r\nThe only requirement is that you must perform the installation
    using an admin account.\r\n\r\nAs I remember you already have a Find my Font Pro
    LicenseNo, therefore I propose to try again and if you have any issues installing
    it, post them here or send me an e-mail to resolve them - whatever you want.\r\n\r\nI
    will be glad to read your comments on our new release.\r\n\r\nFivos\r\n"

  body: "@Fivos\r\n\r\nBTW - I'm a former network engineer/administrator with a lot
    of experience with Windows installation problems. I was the third-level guy -
    the guy they called in when the first two techs failed. And unless something was
    truly broken, <strong>I</strong> never failed. (Just true, that's all.)\r\n\r\nI
    began playing around with Find My Font today.\r\n\r\n1) I am absolutely sure I
    installed the newer version some weeks ago, yet when I went to launch, the icon
    brought up the older version. Just odd, that's all I'm saying. After that, I uninstalled
    the older version and re-installed the newer version and everything's fine now.
    But unless I'm losing my mind (perfectly possible), the install of 2.3.01 either
    wasn't successful, or didn't replace/overwrite the previous version. I'm just
    mentioning this so you can double-check.\r\n\r\n2) I have not looked at the tutorials
    yet. But simply trying to figure out how the program works by looking at the interface
    and making educated guesses is a bit difficult. Too difficult - and I don't think
    it has to be this way.\r\nThat I have to have an image of a font and that it needs
    to be in the left-hand box is fairly clear and obvious. But it would be more obvious
    if the box were not blank by default, why not a greyed out \"Font Image Loads
    Here\" or something like that? This way, the second the user opens the program,
    it's unavoidably obvious that an 'font' image needs to be opened and that it will
    display in the left-hand panel?\r\n\r\nNow, I'm at the point where what's not
    clear to me is what kind of image is best to use to get the best chance of an
    accurate match. Should it be a phrase, or a word, or a single character? When
    I click the image more than once, it tiles within the \"preview\" box below it.
    There, too, what exactly is being displayed in the lower left hand box? Is it
    what the program \"sees\" in trying to find a match? It's unclear.\r\nIdeally,
    I should be able to learn these things without going to the help section or a
    tutorial. \r\nI'm getting a pop-up box that says something about a 1 letter bitmap
    which I don't understand, too. I'm being forced, really, to go into the help and
    tutorial sections and it seems to me, the idea of the program is very simple and
    this shouldn't be the case.\r\n\r\nThe idea behind the program is simple to understand:
    Provide an image of a font, select a folder or directory that has a font collection,
    and ask the program to find a match. That's it. Very simple.\r\n\r\nYet, it seems
    a little more difficult than it should be to make this happen quickly. Everybody
    hates \"reading the manual\". In fact, they <strong>don't</strong> read the manual!
    And if you're going to be relying on a thirty day and/or disabled features demo
    or something like that to generate sales, it's important that it be as easy to
    use as it can be.\r\n\r\nPlease understand that I'll certainly figure out how
    to use the app, I'm just passing along these points of confusion as a good beta
    tester!  If you'd like to switch to email on these observations, let me know.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\n\r\nRich\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Hi Rich,\r\n\r\nand thank you for your valuable comments.\r\n\r\n----------------------------\r\nAbout
    this one:\r\n<blockquote>1) I am absolutely sure I installed the newer version
    some weeks ago, yet when I went to launch, the icon brought up the older version.(...)</blockquote>\r\nThe
    only difference in installer prior v2.3.00, it was it offered an option to launch
    the application at the end of install.\r\nAs the installation always requires
    an admin-level account, any files created on this first run were owned by the
    admin and they might not be accessible for a normal user account.\r\nThat's the
    only thing I can think it's related to the issue you mention.\r\nAnyway, the last
    installer is tested again & again with many different XP accounts and I hope this
    is not an issue anymore.\r\n\r\n----------------------------\r\nI really appreciate
    your comments and ideas about how a first-time user can figure out the basic program
    operation.\r\nExperienced users, have no problem to start using the app. right
    away,\r\nbut you are right that people hate to read manuals.\r\nWe have already
    started to design a simple screen to stay on, and navigate the new users through
    the required steps:\r\n\r\n1) Tell the App. where your fonts are (once)\r\n2)
    Load or Capture a font image\r\n3) Click on it to select 1-3 distinct letters\r\n4)
    Type the actual text in [Text to Match] field\r\n5) Click the [Mach Fonts!] button\r\n\r\nThat's
    all ;) \r\nand you are right, we should make these simple steps more obvious.\r\n\r\nThanks
    again for your time\r\n\r\nRegards\r\nFivos\r\n\r\n\r\nPS-1: We are already testing
    Finf my Font v2.3.02-beta, which supports Postscript Type-1 fonts (both Mac &
    PC format) and Mac Font Suitcases (OTF/TTF/Type-1). I will post the details just
    after release in a couple of weeks.\r\n\r\nPS-2: I will be really glad to read
    some comments about the \"Browse Fonts by Visual Similarity\" functionality. What
    do you think?"
