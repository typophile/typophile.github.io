    Nike. 2 solutions, depending on what you need:\r\n- alternatives: nothing to do
    but different design [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/andrijtype/oksana-sans|Oksana
    Sans Fat]] and [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/rekord/grim|Grim]]\r\n- do it yourself:
    pick any fat geometric sans of your choice and remove/fulfill counters from [[http://www.myfonts.com/search/Code|Code]],
