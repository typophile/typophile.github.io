body: Hi, <BR> <BR>I&#39;m a video artist trying to simulate the look of closed captioning.
  I&#39;m wondering if anyone out there might have a recommendation for a font that
  resembles the one typically associated with closed captioning. The look varies from
  TV to TV and from program to program, but generally looks something like the image
  in the next post. <BR> <BR>It would be a super bonus if that font were free or low
  cost. <BR> <BR>Thanks very much for any thoughts!  <BR> <BR>Best, <BR>Neil

    white on a black background.

    target="_blank">monospaced fonts</a>, including the ones at the MyFonts link I
    provided. <BR> <BR>Many of these should provide a similar feel, or you might find
    the same one your system uses.
