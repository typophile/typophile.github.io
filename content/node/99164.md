body: "Hello\r\n\r\nI'm looking for a rich feeling, classy looking typeface for a
  men's online buying guide publication. Perhaps something with a serif, although
  I'm not partial. I have seen ITC Lubalin Graph Demi used elsewhere, and it looks
  great. We would like to not copy them, however similar recommendations are welcomed.
  \r\n\r\nYour recommendations are much appreciated. \r\n\r\nThank you. "

  body: "@availium13, what kind of a serif face? slab or just serif?\r\n\r\nI would
    see Stag as classy, but not rich. http://www.christianschwartz.com/stag.shtml\r\n\r\nAlso,
    TheSerif would be okay. (?) http://www.lucasfonts.com/fonts/theserif/"
