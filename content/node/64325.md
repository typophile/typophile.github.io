  adaptations of the traditional hand drawn styles.\r\n\r\nI have built up a nice
  collection of examples, but I have this one (attached) that I need more on. It is
  a very popular style at the momennt.\r\n\r\nI am looking for more good examples
  and information on this style specifically\r\n\r\nAny help would be appriciated.\r\n\r\nGustav\r\n\r\n"

    also does work with similar spiraling swashes, although his hand-lettering is
    more type-based than calligraphic.
