  body: '&#62;&#62;I would NEVER change Nike or Coca-Cola... <BR> <BR>Maybe Coke should
    change their logo to keep up with their image... <BR> <BR>From lawsuit brought
    by International Labor Rights Fund and United Steel Workers of America against
    coca-cola: <BR>==========================================================================
    <BR>Complaint against Coca-Cola for Use of Anti-union Death Squads in Colombia
    <BR>==========================================================================
    <BR>This case involves the systematic intimidation, kidnapping, detention and
    murder of trade unionists in Colombia, South America at the hands of paramilitaries
    working as agents of corporations doing business in that country. The violent
    persecution of trade unionists in Colombia has been at epidemic proportions for
    many years. Since 1986 ... over 3,800 trade unionists have been murdered. Presently,
    more than 60% of trade unionists murdered in the world are Colombian. <BR>This
    case...is brought to remedy and prevent the violent persecution of trade unionists
    at various <BR>locations of one particular company doing business in Colombia

  body: the logos seem old because they are old - but I don&#39;t think that&#39;s
    a good enough justification to re-design an identity that&#39;s become part of
    our visual culture. - if it ain&#39;t broke....plus those logos were designed
    to be long lasting and withstand the test of time - and is that not the sign of
    a successful design anyway? I&#39;d be afraid that if anyone were to re-design
    them now they&#39;d add some contemporary crap to it - and it would have to be
    redo again next year. i.e. ups and its freakin swoosh.

  body: i agree with the anonymous post. being an old logo doesn&#39;t justify a redesign.
    as long as the logo is still a good represenation of the company why change it?
    especially when the logo is as established as those you listed? <BR> <BR>off the
    top of my head the only logo i can think of in need of a facelift is AAA.

  body: the IBM trademark needs to be changed. Paul Rand may have been a conceptual
    power house but he had weak typography skills. the UPS and Westinghouse marks
    were the best he did and even they are only ok.

    to <BR>Pepsi - not the ying-yang-like mark, but if they want to continue the &#34;taste
    of the new generation&#34; gig, they need to keep redoing the wordmark <BR>Chevy
    - what would be the point? <BR>honda - bland, but not dated <BR>nike - definitely
    not! this logo still looks cool and fresh, and there is no wordmark per say, so
    they can combine it with different settings of &#34;nike&#34; to change the look
    <BR>espn - definitely dated, but recognizable <BR>ABC - it&#39;s dated, but it
    still works just fine'

  body: change the coke logo? the epitome of logo? hell, no! they may change whatever
    they want to, but the coke logo should stay untouched. forever. if you ask me.
    some logos become more valuable the older they get and the coke logo is one of
    them. <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif" ALT=":-&#41;"
