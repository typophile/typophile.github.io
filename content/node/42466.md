    for them to step into a good design agency without much hassle? Or will there
    always be a problem in design?

    agency is doing pro life work and a right to life person is looking to work there,
    I can see clashes.\r\n\r\nThe one thing you have to remember is that a junior
    is expected to do what she is told, not to make policy decisions. That said, you
    always have the option of leaving if the work assigned to you bothers you ethically."

  body: "when i was at mtv i interviewed students for internships and assistant positions
    every wednesday. our needs were for a fair amount of busy work. i'm sure priorities
    vary between hiring situations.\r\n\r\ni saw geniuses and fools and everything
    in between. the successful hires were not necessarily the most talented. the most
    brilliant among them often had attitude problems. straight forward eagerness and
    abilty to learn was a hallmark of the kids with professionally clean portfolios
    displaying a range of very good to so-so work. \r\n\r\ni felt that they were trainable
    and smart enough to be pro-active about their own evolution. clean portfolio style
    indicated an ability to follow instructions and protocol, and in the \"almost\"
    quality of the creative i saw potential and aspiration. \r\n\r\na bit counter-intuitive
    at first, but i learned from experience that the most \"stunning\" work often
    did not come from the most employable candidates."

    over careless presentation of amazing work (which was statistically rare but i

    they are going to balance out but hopefully,  someone will be happy to have me.
    (I hope) :) Any advice for 'do's and don'ts' for CV and portfolio?\r\n\r\nPS what
    do you think universities have to improve on? I know my tutor keeps informing
    us that they can not teach us everything and that employers inform them of what
    they expect out of graduates in the design industry i.e. graphic design. What
    do you personally think in regards to this issue? What is there too much or too
    little of which needs to be sorted drastically to mould the designers of the future."

    find agreement. One person will like one piece, another might not. After a while,
    it starts to feel like you are just trying to find people you can comminicate
    with. Every shop has a level of compromise. A good attitude has to do with not
    making an issue of this. Look for a mentor that you believe in. '

    firing myself but I do have some advice.\r\n\r\nI think it is vital to get to
    know your local industry and what sort of work you want to do.\r\n\r\nI was a
    bit shocked when recently chatting to a student who was about to graduate and
    I asked him what he wanted to do. He had no ideas or enthusiasm at all, he shrugged
    and said \"hmmm something collaborative\". When I graduated I could have given
    you a huge list of design jobs I'd love to try.\r\n\r\nI also agree with the idea
    of a simple, professional resume. One of my first jobs was doing clerical duties
    for an Architect. One of my tasks involved opening and filing the HUNDREDS of
    graduate student resumes that were sent to us. All got copied and filed, reviewed
    quickly by the business manager and very few got to the Director.\r\n\r\nHope
    these thoughts help somehow.\r\n\r\nZennie :)\r\n"

    styles:\r\n\r\n1. Full-size pages stuck into an Itoya (black plastic) book of
    sleeves\r\n2. An insanely overpriced fake-leather book of sleeves\r\n3. Metal
    books of sleeves\r\n4. Printed pages worked into some kind of high-end binder\r\n5.
    Really over-the-top handmade books\r\n6. Loose items and boards to be passed around\r\n\r\nI
    seem to have the most luck with 6, because my biggest skill is the ability to
    explain every detail of my work. But it has killed me in interviews at firms that
    expect people to try and wow them with #5. #1 is another option I like because
    it is flexible, simple, and unpretentious. Is it ok to work sample pages into
    a simple portfolio book and have a few loose items to pass around at most places?
    I know that not having something really wild will always kill me at firms that
    expect a wild, hand-made portfolio with a nice leave-behind, but I don\u2019t
    usually want to work for those people, so if it\u2019s an uncommon problem I\u2019m
    not too worried."

    I don't have a LOT of experience handing out physical portfolios, but the easiest
    portfolio for me was to print out color 8.5 x 11 'boards' (just laser prints)
    and bind with nice card stock cover using removable binders. Once in the interview,
    I can easily dismantle it to pass around.\r\n\r\nThe catch with 'wowing' people
    with your actual portfolio case is that you REALLY have to wow them. Most tend
    to just burden their work with an overly ornate/pretentious package so, if anything,
    better to err on the side of simplicity (which is something we should remember
    in all facets of design, actually ;o)\r\n\r\n"

    my degree is over once and for all :D I have been making my own portfolio box.
    I recently went to a portfolio critique in Manchester, where designers from local
    companies spared time for students. It gave me a whole new insight into the do's
    and don'ts but I guess that was just the opinion of two that I managed to see.
    By the way, they loved the portfolio box which was great :D.\r\n\r\nPS I am looking

    gone with loose items. I've put work in PDF's to send when applying for the job,
    but I've never felt putting together a book would be worth it in the end. Maybe
    it's cost me some jobs, who knows, but my work is my work and I'd rather show
    it than select pages I think are the most attractive. Someday I might go for a
    book style, but online and PDF portfolios are widely accepted these days, and
    following it up with a few hard copies at the interview is acceptable in my books.\r\n\r\nThat
    said, depending on the field you are going in to, a well put together portfolio
    can show your own design sense and attention to detail when trying to land that
    first <em>good</em> job. "
