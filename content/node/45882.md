body: Can anyone tell me if the ATF typefaces are public domain? I am considering
  digitizing a typeface from one of the old specimen books (1934), but wasn't sure
  if another company now owns the copyright to those designs. Thanks in advance.

    under US law. However the names are trademarks, so you cannot revive the old face
    and use the ATF name without an agreement with whoever currently owns the rights
    to the name. '

  body: "I think James meant to put a \"not\" in the second clause of his first sentence.
    Technically, the design of a typeface is not copyrightable in the US. \r\n\r\nThere
    are some circumstances under which a design is patentable. I believe some ATF
    faces received patents. But patents are much shorter lived than copyright and
    would have expired. \r\n\r\nIIRC, for a while someone (ATF-Kingsley, I think it
    was) was maintaining the registration of the trademarks. But trademarks can lapse
    if the mark is abandoned. You would have to undertake a trademark search with
    the USPTO if you were thinking of retaining the original name.\r\n\r\n-- K.\r\n\r\n"

  body: Thanks James and Kent. I've heard type designers reference these books quite
    often, it was my impression that since ATF no longer exists, the designs are fair
    game for digitizing. Other than the naming issue, it sounds like I was right about
    that. Anyone else care to chime it?

  body: "I am thinking the same as you, and also had doubts about digitizing some
    of them. I thought that if any issue, it would be naming them. Also, I like to
    actually find more information about type designers who worked for ATF. The books
    don't mention any designers names. I wonder anyone would know anything about that
    too. Well Chris, I did add more questions.\r\n"

  body: There is also the question of which faces are useful now - the faces in the
    ATF catalogs had a context. If you design outside of a context there is a danger
    the design ends up being rootless and therefore of marginal interest. There is
    one design in there I think is amazing. If I get the chance I may want to riff
    of of it one day....

  body: I see Eben. Today's typography is stunning. But I think there are few things
    that can be done from an old face. Like starting with an imitation, which will
    then become something else, better, newer. I am kind of nostalgic.

    from the always accurate wikipedia:\r\n\"Although typeface design is not subject
    to copyright in the United States under the 1976 Copyright Act, the United States
    District Court for the Northern District of California in Adobe Systems, Inc.
    and Emigre, Inc. v. Southern Software, Inc. and King (No. C95-20710 RMW, N.D.
    Cal. Jan. 30, 1998[1]) found that there was copyright in the placement of points
    on a computer font's outline, i.e., because a given outline can be expressed in
    myriad ways, a particular selection and placement of points has sufficient originality
    to qualify for copyright.\"\r\n\r\nThis would lead me to believe that as long
    as it hasn't been digitized, it should be okay, but maybe sources other than Wikipedia
    should be consulted..."

  body: "The IP rights to the ATF library were still very much owned and being protected
    in the early-to-mid nineties. At that time the person to contact regarding licensing
    was Mark A. Lester, Esq., in Los Angeles. This may still hold true although I
    don't have current contact information for him. If he's still practicing he's
    probably in the phone book.\r\n\r\nThe one thing I found most frustrating about
    trying to deal with them was the fact that they weren't really interested in licensing
    for a single font or single family. They were far more interested in licensing
    the entire package.\r\n\r\nI also do not know which of their library of faces
    they claim IP rights to. The very old ones, in my mind at least, probably have
    no protection at all."

  body: "<cite> > As I said I have interest in the designer, </cite>\r\n\r\nThe prime
    force behind the design of most ATF faces was indeed Morris Fuller Benton, with
    some 200+ designs to his credit. The names of the numerous drawing office workers
    who did most of the drawing and production on those are shrouded in the mists
    of time.\r\n\r\nATF also published designs from outside designers. Mac McGrew
    gives attributions for many, many faces in his very thorough <cite>American Metal
    Typefaces of the Twentieth Century.</cite> I recommend anyone look up any face
    they're contemplating reviving.\r\n\r\n<cite> > The very old ones, in my mind
    at least, probably have no protection at all.</cite>\r\n\r\nLet's assume for a
    moment, for the sake of argument, that typeface designs were copyrightable. In
    the U.S., works published before 1978 were afforded a maximum of 75 years protection
    if all renewals were made in a timely fashion. Anything published before 1933
    would have entered the public domain by now. (One more year to go on any designs
    that were <em>new</em> to that 1934 catalog ;-)\r\n\r\nSo, from several angles,
    it seems that the legality is fairly clear. But this does not address any of moral
    considerations or intrinsic creative value of such an undertaking. If you haven't
    already done so, read and consider the various motives and approaches that John
    Downer categorizes in his <A href=\"http://www.emigre.com/Editorial.php?sect=2\">Call
    It What It Is</a> article.\r\n\r\nBut hey, Benguiat revived Benton's Souvenir
    for ITC in the &#146;70s and that was well-received -- for a while, right? On
    the other hand, look what happened after that ;-) As Eben said, context is important.
    Souvenir in the ATF 1923 catalog looks really nice, IMO. Souvenir in the &#146;70s
    seems cliche now. Souvenir these days would be downright dorky.\r\n\r\nDon't get
    me wrong. I'm not slamming revivals. (Heck, I'm about to embark on one of my own
    -- well, more of a restoration than a revival, really.) I'm just pointing out
    some of the considerations that anyone should think through before doing so.\r\n\r\n--
    K.\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: For designers of faces prior to the birth of ATF, for those faces which were
    the products of all the older foundries you could refer to the individual Design
    Patents at the PTO. There weren't a large of number of designers and in some cases
    I believe the face was attributed to a single individual at a given foundry rather
    than the real designer.
