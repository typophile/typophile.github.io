body: hi, I&#39;ve wanted to know the name of the font used on the Computer Arts &#40;see
  sample&#41;. The &#34;C&#34; is very PSYOPS / Reykjavik / Reform, but I&#39;ve checked
  and no such luck. Anyone? <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/21072.jpg"

  body: It reminds me of <a href="http://66.70.183.115/fonts/fontshow/db.cgi?db=default&amp;uid=default&amp;ID=33220&amp;ww=on&amp;view_records=View%2BRecords"
    target="_blank">T-26 Metsys</a>, but it&#39;s been tweaked away from that. The
    broken t is an obvious characteristic. If Gareth Hague didn&#39;t design this
    one, he has someone looking over his shoulder.

  body: Mike&#39;s right. It definitely has some serious Metsys underpinnings. I wonder
    if it&#39;s a non-commercial variation from Gareth and David James. Many of their
    faces tend to riff off of each other. Take <a href="http://www.veer.com/results.asp?image=ALT0000124">Sylvia</a>
    and <a href="http://www.veer.com/results.asp?image=ALT0000127">Aminta</a> or <a
    href="http://www.veer.com/results.asp?image=ALT0000105">Enabler</a> and the upcoming
    Anomoly &#40;I&#39;ll try to find an example of this...&#41; for instance.
