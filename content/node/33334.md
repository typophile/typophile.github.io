  body: "timd: actually, you're right, it's based on 12-fold symmetry, rather than
    a Fibonacci spiral.\r\n\r\nSo probably the simplest way to do this is to take
    a 1/12th slice, draw it more or less by hand, then replicate it around 12 times.
    That slice also has a mirror symmetry, but it may be easier to just draw both
    halves rather than trying to draw a single half and doing a mirror copy.\r\n\r\nI
    find the Fibonacci spiral more appealing - it's closer to what's in nature - but
    it is more complicated to pull off, for sure.\r\n"

    gave me a lot more control and broke away from that Spiral-graph look. Start with
    2 lines (straight or curved) then blend them together using 20, 50, 100 steps,
    sometimes the more the merrier. You can alter the lines themselves (adding anchor
    points and curves), and/or you can alter the blend path (more anchor points and
    curves as well). You can also blend multiple lines together for an even more intricate
    look. This method would be closer to mimicking that Certificate look.\r\n\r\n"

    increases it becomes more spacial. \r\nI apologise if I am unclear with my explanation.
