    \r\n\r\nI would try making the middle peak less heavy than the lower joins. Also
    you might experiment with the traditional thick-thin-thick-thin pattern to see
    how it goes with the decorative elements. "

    I had a bunch of freelance jobs just to use it more. \r\n\r\nThis project is a
    little irritating, tho. The paths that Illustrator is generating when I start
    blowing strokes up and converting them to outlines are horrible; I think I need
    to redo some stuff in Fontlab and start over. If I\u2019m going to keep doing
    projects with lettering and type manipulation I\u2019ll need to buy a copy of
    Freehand."

  body: James, I am guessing that when you bold this as a result of the 'strokes'
    you have to make it wider, ie, redraw it, in order to restore the balance of the
    original. Thus, for example, when the two 'V's are farther apart, the middle peak
    will be less heavy. This is part of the "joy" of doing different weights of an
    M or W, with all those diagonal strokes squished in a small span.

  body: "What is the original letterform? the thin black outline?\r\n\r\nIf so, I've
    found that it's usually the inside shape is usually what your eye judges. When
    I do outlined/dimensional letters, what I usually do is (illustrator):\r\n1-outline
    my text\r\n2-copy and paste the text in back of the original and stroke it to
    the desired width.\r\n3-with the stroked letterforms, I release the complex paths,
    and delete the forms I don't need.\r\n\r\nThis leaves you with the inside forms
    (or top layer) as the original type outlines, with a thicker stroke on the outside
    (or bottom layer). Here's a quick (poor) example:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Untitled-1_4865.gif]"

    Logo and Lettering Bible]] might be of some help on this project. He has a whole
    chapter of "Type Trix" in which he shows how to do all kinds of outlining, shadows
    and decoration, and some of the pitfalls. I''ve never done any of this, but he
    seems to know a lot about it. '

    paths. Just use the appearance window and drag the stroke underneath the fill.
    You can add as many strokes as you can bear this way, without compromising the
    shape of your letterform.\r\n"

  body: "<em>use the appearance window and drag the stroke underneath the fill.</em>\r\nYes,
    it can be done that way too. Hmm, somehow that never crossed my mind. My main
    point was to make one of the inner shapes the true letter form, and the black
    frame an outside stroke.\r\n\r\nSorry to completely dominate your blog post, James."

    a shape's outline by using the stroke panel in Illustrator.
