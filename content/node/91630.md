body: "I'm looking for a good guide to Open Type and all of its features, especially
  the programming methods available.  \r\n\r\nPreferable something a little less arcane
  than the standard \"encyclopedia\" that passes for a lot of programming manuals.\r\n\r\nThanks
  all."

  body: "Both the Microsoft Typography and Adobe Opentype web pages contain official
    specifications as well as extensive listings of all currently defined features.
    Most of them come down to \"this feature should be implemented as a Single Lookup,
    and that as a Contextual one\" -- not much of <em>programming</em> required.\r\n\r\nCombining
    the few available commands can make things <em>interesting</em>; take, for example,
    Tal Leming's <a href=\"http://talleming.com/2009/10/01/fraction-fever-2/\">Fraction
    Fever 2</a>. There are also a couple of threads in the Build section that discuss
    writing out arbitrary numbers in Roman form.\r\n\r\nAnything particular you are
    looking for?"

  body: "OT feature code is not a programming language in the usual sense. There are
    no functions for system info, there is no random function, there are no functions
    period.\r\n\r\nI find it's easiest to think of it as a formalized kind of search
    and replace language, something like GREP or regular expressions."

  body: "http://www.microsoft.com/typography/otspec/features_ae.htm\r\n\r\nIt would
    be nice if layout apps supported the random feature.\r\n\r\nAt the moment, complex
    pseudo-random coding has to be put into the font, included in a feature such as
    \u201Ccalt\u201D. Most annoyingly, it doesn\u2019t work (in InDesign) when tracking
    exceeds +20.\r\n\r\nIdeally, I would like to be able to create several glyphs
    all named \u201Ca.rand\u201D in a font, and put a simple instruction in the \u201Crand\u201D
    feature: sub a' by a.rand; \u2014and then the layout app would cycle through the
    alternates. Or some such thing."

  body: "There is an <em>operator</em> called \"rand\" in the CFF specifications --
    but I doubt it is supported by all (or some) type engines.\r\n\r\nI can't imagine
    anyway how that would work in an interactive way, such as when typing in text.
    Would you see the glyphs on screen squirm and wiggle as you are typing? How about
    system redrawing -- zooming in and out would also cause your glyphs to change!\r\n\r\nI
    suppose the same goes for attempting to support the OTF feature \"rand\", as it
    may display these same side effects."

  body: my idea was to have three our four versions of the same glyph and simply have
    the engine chose a random one on every corresponding keypress.  So it wouldnt
    really be controllable by the user at all.  Or, to hide an easter egg in the font,
    for example to have it morph into something similar to comic sans every april
    first for the entire day. I am a playful one.
