    sorted in InDesign's font menu, and the culprit* was a faulty Italic Angle value
    -- the Italic Angle of the \"Italic\" font was set to 0 (zero). The value on the
    other italics in the family (e.g. Bold Italic, Semibold Italic) was also incorrectly
    set to zero, but for some reason the sorting of those fonts was not affected.
    Only the plain \"Italic\" was sorted out of order.\r\n\r\n*The fonts' naming was
    all correct BTW, so that wasn't the problem"

    choose the terms incorrectly but I think the idea is clear."
