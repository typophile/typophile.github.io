body: "[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Picture1_3718.png]\r\nThis piece of lettering
  will serve as a hanger in a retail space. I am producing it out of aluminum (water
  jet cut from an \u215B-inch thick sheet). I am interested in all critiques but particularly
  those pertaining to refinement of the lettershapes, interaction between letters,
  & spacing. I would like to keep this a relatively low contrast script. Structurally,
  the paperboard models I have produced are sound enough and balance well enough.
  Dresses hang by their straps that fit into the notches between the m & o, and the
  a & n. The PDF shows the hanger at actual size on a piece of 11x17 paper. (I have
  not removed overlaps in the font file, but will before producing this.)\r\nThanks."

  body: "Cool idea. The /ga/ connection seems like the least convincing part of the
    design (looks like /g/ is desperately reaching out with both hands to hold on
    to /a/). I might try making the shapes of the top of /g/ and of /a/ more similar
    to each other, e.g. both having gaps like the /g/ currently has. The lachrymal
    terminal at the very start feels a bit all alone. \r\n\r\nBe sure to post pics
    of the finished product here!"

    legibility. It was readable already, so\u2026 It works with that 'o' twist."

  body: "[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Picture3_5990.png]\r\n\r\nThanks Craig
    and Tomi. Especially good to hear from you Craig, and you bet I'll put up pictures
    once this is cut. I've worked out a few of the kinks and character relationships
    and gotten a bit farther along I feel. Tomi, I've got a good bit of stress riding
    on that /r/g/ connection, so I'm keeping it more simple and structurally sound
    for now."

    it not be possible to arch it (for better support)?\r\n- A quite important issue

    body: Could be, but there's also an image of the hanger 'in use' on his site...
      though it could be a prototype and not a commercial run... I couldn't find any
      'in shop' images unfortunately.
