  body: Thank you. <BR>AS <BR> <BR>PS/ <BR>I moved a folder &#40;an important one&#41;
    from where it was <BR>to a subfolder of &#39;posta in arrivo&#39; &#40;coming&#41;
    to have it <BR>on the top of the interface &#40;Outlook&#41; and it disappered.
    <BR>I am so sad. Sorry for the off-topic. It was not a folder <BR>with job e-mails.
    I am so sad.
