  like to introduce you to my latest design, Cinzel.\r\nCinzel is a typeface inspired
  in first century roman inscriptions, and based on classical proportions. However
  it\u2019s not a simple revivalism. While it conveys all the ancient history of the
  latin alphabet it also merges a contemporary feel onto it. \r\n\r\nMore info:\r\nhttp://www.behance.net/gallery/Cinzel-Typeface/5654455\r\n\r\nThanks!"

  body: "Elegant and interesting. But I\u2019m wondering why you didn\u2019t make
    the Decorative glyphs a stylistic set in the main fonts, rather than doing them
    as uppercase/lowercase in the decorative fonts. Using a stylistic set would give
    print users the full range of glyphs (decorative case, uppercase and lower (small
    caps) case) in a particular weight with proper kerning between glyphs.\r\n\r\nDavid\r\n"

  body: "Hi David. thanks for the compliments :) \r\nA Stylistic Set would make total
    sense to me as well, however the font was primarily designed for the web, mainly
    for the Google Web Fonts Library, and that means I couldn't use open type features,
    since, as far as I know, you can't use them through Google's \"embedding\" method.\r\nI
    thought of making a print and web version but that might end up being confusing,
    and so I just shared the files like that.\r\nBut, who knows, I might work a bit
    more on that in the future, also the ligatures on the decorative styles are made
    with kern pairs (O+O and H+E) surely not the best solution, but it was a way to
    try to bring some interesting shapes to the web. \r\nNatanael\r\n "
