    is an image of another Serkisoff face</a>, which confirms my thought about the
    middle symbol at the \u2018eight\u2019 and \u2018nine\u2019 positions: this looks
    very much like the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_numerals\">Hindi
    numeral 2</a>. But I can't make any sense of the rest of the symbols.\r\n\r\nAre
    you familiar with Ottoman timekeeping practise? They kept the daily count of hours
    from sunset, which they called 12 o'clock, so clocks and watches needed to be
    reset every day."

    Can you explain the system, which form represents which numeral?

    case a brilliant design to give the Arabic scripted world a visual equivalent
    for Roman numbers, typical for watches - with opportunely tapered shapes. It can
    take its place next to Ya\u1E25y\xE0 Boutem\xE8ne's uniquely profound structural
    solution for morphing Latin shapes onto Arabic graphemes (see Roland Meynet, L'\xE9criture

  body: Brilliant. I though that "u" and "cedilla" are multipliers, not "matchmaked"
    forms, so not everything wanted to work as a system. I should have a look at standard
    numerals before writing my previous post.

  body: "Hello everyone,\r\n\r\nI have just come across this interesting discussion.
    \r\n\r\nThe classic book on the topic is Otto Kurz, <em>European clocks and watches
    in the Near East</em>, London, Warburg Institute, 1975. You can also find additional
    useful references on this topic in [[http://books.google.com/books?id=J3G4quReeVcC&pg=PA285|David
    King, <em>World-maps for finding the direction and distance to Mecca</em>, Brill,
    1999]], pp. 285\u2013289. The list in footnote 24 on pp. 286\u2013288 shows that
    such numeral forms on clocks and watches appeared already in the early-17th c.,
    perhaps even in the 16th c. \r\n\r\nConcerning the tu\u011Fra above, I can't read
    it because it is mostly hidden by the minute hand, but it appears to be an Ottoman
    name, and thus is not related to Serkisoff. The number (327 or 227) at the right
    could be a serial number, or, far more likely, an abbreviation for the Hijra year
    1327 (= 1909) or 1227 (= 1812). Given the photo of the watch displayed above,
    I would opt for the latter date.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\nFC\r\n"

  body: 'Sorry to bump an old thread, but I have a pocket watch very similar to the
    Serkisoff watches pictured, although mine reads "SERPOS & CIE \ CONSTANTINOPLE".
    Unable to find anything online without the proper terminology, I was luckily able
    to decipher the numerals on my own (read: I spent my weekend at the library).
    The strange thing I noticed was that my watch has two 1s. The face is almost identical
    to the first picture in the thread, but the face reads ''12, 1, 1, 3, 4, 5...7,
    8, 9, 10, 11''. It doesn''t look worn off or anything, just like they put the
    wrong numeral on it. I would appreciate any knowledge anyone has regarding my
    seemingly odd watch.'
