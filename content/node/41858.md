body: "(such a newbie, I accidentally had posted this in the sans critique section.
  Thanks to the people who originally responded)\r\n\r\nHi all,\r\n\r\nI have seriously
  considered designing a sans typeface. I\u2019m looking to see if anyone knows some
  great texts or other resources for designing said type. I was looking at both Gotham
  and Avenir as inspiration, but wanted to make a face that was unique as well. Aside
  from two typefaces i designed while I was a student, i don\u2019t feel as if i actually
  know many rules of thumb that create a good typeface.\r\n\r\nI had a tendency to
  try and force all my letters (aside from lc m,i) into a monospaced width, and tried
  to force everything into a neat little system. It came out looking something like
  the bastard child of DIN Engschrift and Franklin Gothic, with Modula as the surrogate
  mother. The more I looked up close at Gotham, Avenir, and others like them, the
  more I wanted to try and make a serious typeface of professional quality. I know
  it takes years for that, but i may as well start while I\u2019m young.\r\n\r\nSome
  points I\u2019m thinking of (in order of importance):\r\nProportions and ratios
  of individual letters compared to others\r\nItalics (obliques)\r\nnon-alphanumeric
  characters\r\nAchieving 3-4 weights (maybe this comes after I get a single weight
  down)\r\nCondensed\r\nSmallcaps\r\n\r\nAlso, what typog program would be recommended?
  This Adobe whore doesn't know what the standard/favorite is.\r\n\r\nAny resources
  or books would be much obliged.\r\n\r\nBest,\r\n\r\nAndy"

  body: Why do you feel that you have to design a gothic or sans serif type. If you're
    doing it for self satisfaction, that's another matter.

    great chapter on font design. It walks you through creating a font, letter by
    letter and has tables grouping letters in ways that give you a logical process
    to work through."

  body: "Robert,\r\n\r\nI guess the answer would be for my own self gratification,
    but also to further my skill set. I'm only two years out of school (BFA GD), but
    I find myself increasingly interested of the type side of design. I think I would
    enjoy designing a typeface. I guess there may be a concern as to why we need another
    sans, with all the choices that are already there. So I would say that i \"have\"
    to design a serif because a) I find their forms very simple and elegant, and b)
    I feel like serifs or contrasting widths would be a little overwhelming to start
    with. I know that whatever I create most likely won't be anything that Robert
    Bringhurst will ever write about, but I'm looking to start out."

    inspiration for the bold?
