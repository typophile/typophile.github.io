body: "Hi,\r\n\r\nDoes anyone know if there is a way to control how FontLab decides
  the size of bitmaps pasted in the background? When I paste my capital letters from
  Photoshop, the bitmaps are automatically scaled to the caps height. This is fine
  with 'A' and 'H', but not with 'C' and 'O' which I want slightly taller than the
  caps height. And when I do the same with '\xC5', the bitmap is suddenly enormous.\r\n\r\nI
  would simply want them all to be pasted to the same scale. Is that even possible?\r\n\r\n/M\xE5ns"
