They recently published the 6th edition of their their manuscript publication guidelines which includes a lot of typographic recommendations, most of which are downright hilarious.

<cite>
apa.cls is not in any way connected to, endorsed by, or probably known at all at the American Psychological Association.  APA does not even accept manuscript submissions in LaTeX source.  The author of apa.cls has made every effort to achieve typesetting results conforming to  the APA manual, because he uses it for his manuscripts.  However, he is not responsible if the editor does not approve of a manuscript  typeset with apa.cls, if your computer blows up while processing your manuscript with apa.cls, or for anything else that may go wrong with apa.cls, or with anything else for that matter.</cite>

Following up on Bert's comment, maybe the APA has decided to return to this very ingrained (in America, at least) typewriting-derived habit.

		<div class="commentbody">>That double space is a purely American habit

The practice of double spacing after periods is in the US known variously as "English" or "French" spacing, and has been common at one time in those countries, as well as the US. It is not an American habit today, as most style guides, I believe, are against it. The one Christopher refers to is an outlier. I also can't remember ever seeing printed material like that. It used to be standard practice in typewritten material, where it has some rationale. 

For some of the story you can read the [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_spacing_at_the_end_of_sentences|Wikipedia article on double spacing.]]

ps I see in Harry Carter's "View of Early Typography" that a hand manuscript of 1450 has wide spacing between sentences, and the famous Berner sheet of Garamond has many sentences spaced very widely.

For the Computer Modern (10pt) font, the interword space is 3.33pt, and the extra space is 1.11pt; however, for the Computer Modern Typewriter font, the extra space is equal to the interword space, 5.25pt, giving in fact two spaces after a period. Here is how it looks with LaTeX. The inputs are essentially the same, one with \textrm (Roman font), the other with \texttt (the typewriter font):

All depends on whether the emphasis is on reading or editing.
For reading, you're right. It's ridiculous. But for marking it up by hand during editing, it might make it easier to mark off a particular sentence without messing up the next.
That might be the thinking, as strange as it might seem.
Giving ease of editing precedence over the readability of the finished product.
APA also calls for double spacing. Also silly in the final product. But when you're editing on paper, that extra space comes in mighty handy.
(I do quite a bit of editing of APA papers.)
That said, it's not going to be enforced by anyone or anything. In spite of what v6 might say. APA-specific software doesn't enforce it and those apps don't get upgraded too often.

		<div class="commentbody">By the way, I'm wondering whether Jan Tschichold had an influence on killing the double spacing. His rules for Penguin have a single space after a sentence. 

Or was it the advent of machine type setting? I can imagine that in hand composition justifying text by adjusting space between sentences might have been an easy and clean option. 

With machine setting, I believe that adjustment of all word spaces in a line for purpose of justification became relatively quick and easy. </div>

		<div class="commentbody">As I mentioned before in a similar thread, kerning of the difficult cap-lowercase combinations (in Linotype two-letter "logotypes" at first) rendered "double spacing" unnecessary.

Previously, if only a single space occurred before a "T_o" or similar combination, that didn't sufficiently associate the capital with its word.

Even today, double-spacing improves the appearance of certain types that have kerning between the space and letter characters. For instance, when the period at the end of a sentence is kerned under an "f", and the following sentence begins with a T.</div>

Also₂: HTML rules on whitespace collapse make it impossible to end a sentence with two spaces unless one or more of them is nonbreaking. In fact, you can end sentences with a hundred spaces, tabs, and carriage returns and they’ll all be collapsed to a single space (modulo certain CMSs and blog platforms that try to turn such runs into <code>BR</code>s).

i noticed something odd in an .html doc one day,
and explored to find that the person had changed
double-spaces at the end of sentences to a combo
of plainspace-nonbreakingspace, which meant that
when that beginning plainspace fell at the end of a line,
the nonbreakingspace would be the first "character" on
the next line, and would dutifully present as a space,
causing a weird void to appear at the start of the line.

The four per-em space is pretty close in width to the space. Two of them after the period does a pretty good job of approximating two spaces. In fact, I think a four per-em space followed by a six per-em space is right on the money width-wise but not sure.
Also, using the zero-width space might prevent the wrapping to the next line of the last space character that you observed. If it doesn't help, the only answer, I think, is to get CSS in on the act.

		<div class="commentbody">you know what was interesting about that slate article?

most articles there, especially from the writer who did
this one, draw a few hundred comments, after a while.

this one had a thousand comments  right off the bat,
and the total count has since climbed to over 2200...

so people obviously _care_ about this issue!  really!

p.s.  and -- at least at the start -- the overwhelming
majority of posters said "i use two, and i ain't changing".
