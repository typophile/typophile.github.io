    this time, but it's not like the fonts will evaporate after a single use. \r\nHow
    big are the chances you can do something for this client again? Then next time
    you'd already have the fonts. \r\nAnd like Bendy says, can't you just get the
    one or two styles you need?"

  body: "Thanks for all the notes everyone!\r\n\r\nBendy, that's my question exactly.
    If my client's license allows me to use it, then I could acquire the font and
    use it just for this client's projects. But is that legal?\r\n\r\nI could get
    the one or two styles I need, but in the end I'm trying to avoid incurring costs
    but still stay legal. I guess the real question falls back to what Bendy asked.
    Does the client's license allow me to use it for that client's work, even though
    it's not on the client's computer?\r\n\r\nNina, true, I may be doing more work
    for this client, but I might not. In essence it's like I'm trading my work to
    get a font. I see the invested future value there, but if I can avoid it I'd like
    to.\r\n\r\nNick, great suggestion. How similar would you say Opus is to Optima?
    70%? 95%? I wish I were better at comparing faces.\r\n\r\nLinden, alas, this <em>is</em>
    a commercial job. Thanks though!\r\n\r\n"

    you'll need though.\r\n\r\nRe licence, it will depend on how many licences the
    client has for Optima. When I license fonts, I usually buy 'up to 5 machines'
    so I can send fonts to our design agency or printers if needed. The client needs
    to know how many licences they hold and whether they're site licences or machine
    licenses. If they have the EULA, read that to see if they're allowed to send it
    to their printers/designers...you can always uninstall it afterwards."

  body: "Unfortunately, your client's license does not permit you to use Optima. Your
    client most likely has a license to use Optima on a specific number of computers,
    at his office's location. If you did the work on one of his computers, in his
    office, you would be covered. If you did the work on one of his computers outside
    of the office (like on one of his laptops), you would probably also be covered.
    But you cannot acquire the font from him (or from someone else who might have
    it) and be covered by his EULA.\r\n\r\nI think that you have three (legal) options
    in this case: First, you could license just the fonts that you need for this one
    email blast. Second, you could use a typeface very similar to Optima, like one
    of the ones mentioned above. Third, you could opt not to do the work for the client.
    If you absolutely have to buy the fonts, and the client is paying you less than
    the cost of those fonts for the work, then this project is not economically viable.
    You should not do work for a client at a loss (unless, perhaps, you think that
    you might get more work from the client in the future, and you can afford the
    loss of time and funds at the moment)."

  body: "Bert Vanderveen:\r\n<cite>The older digital versions of Optima lack the subtle
    curves in stems etc. of the original</cite>\r\nThis is interesting. What I heard
    and remembered - which may well be wrong - was that while the tapered curves of
    the original Optima <em>were</em> included in the font outlines of even the earliest
    Type 1 and TrueType renderings of Optima, since the taper was subtle, it didn't
    show up properly on the printed page... due to the puny 300dpi resolution of the
    laser printers at the time.\r\n\r\nThat is not to say that processing power, or
    something like it, wouldn't have been an issue. Hinting algorithms embodied within
    the fonts themselves dealt with making sure that character alignment didn't do
    violence to the widths of stems in screen display and things like that. For the
    subtle taper of Optima, instead of dragging boundaries to the nearest pixel boundary,
    while one might drag the base of the curve there, what one then needs to do is
    dither the dots to represent the boundary's gradual tapered movement.\r\n\r\nThat
    may not have been anticipated - leading to Hermann Zapf designing a successor
    to Optima for laser printer applications that didn't have the taper. The name
    of which I don't recall off the top of my head."

    I think your source is BS.\r\n\r\nTo be sure that a font is definitely public
    domain, one has to take into consideration the maximum period of protection of
    25 years. Hence my documents here\r\n\r\nhttp://www.sanskritweb.net/forgers/publicdomain.pdf\r\n\r\nand
    here\r\n\r\nhttp://www.sanskritweb.net/forgers/publicdomain2.pdf\r\n\r\nHowever,
    since font buyers are dimwits believing the lie that a font is design protected,
    even though the protection period has lapsed, Linotype does no longer bother to
    waste money on protecting fonts for the full period of 25 years. Hence even Hermann
    Zapf's Zapfino fell into public domain.\r\n\r\n"
