  using filters??? \r\n\r\nhttp://forums.adobe.com/servlet/JiveServlet/downloadImage/13466/line_art_example.gif\r\n\r\nI
  have experimented with various tutorials and filters in photoshop (cutout, stamp,
  notepaper etc) hoping to replicate the clean smooth lines (image is based of a photo
  I presume), but are yet unable to get so nice and clean lines, so I'm not sure if
  I meant to be doing something else before applying those filters etc or.\r\n\r\nDoes
  anyone know or can provide me with some advice and tutorials on how to do such work.\r\n
  \r\nAny help would be great"

    designer could output vectors that good, assuming they were either an illustrator
    in additional to their role, or, if they were supplied a finished illustration.\r\n\r\nBut
    if you're working for a studio, the practical thing to do would be to hire an
    illustrator, as James said, because that is painstaking work."
