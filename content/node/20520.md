  is listed to his credit, but I had no idea how extensive his training and passion
  for furniture was until I read parts of <a href=\"http://www.drleslie.com/PMADMagazines/Spreads/bernhard3_large.shtml\"
  target=\"new\">this article</a> from PM magazine, March 1936:\r\n\r\n\"... [Lucian
  Bernhard] became a member of the Deutsche Werkstatten where he went to work in the
  carpenter shop to learn how to design furniture constructively. He then found that,
  in order to plan good furniture, one had to start with the room in which the furniture
  was to go. In fact, one had to learn not only how a room was built but how a whole
  house was built. So, there was nothing for it but to study architecture, which he
  did. Soon he was designing homes, factories and office buildings, inside and out.
  He designed wall papers, fabrics, hardware, lighting fixtures, rugs, as well as
  furniture.\"\r\n\r\nI thinks there's a lesson here. "
