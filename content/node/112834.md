  body: "After quite a bit of digging I didn't find anything closer. BTW I find this
    version more appealing than the scratchy strokes of ITC Tempus Sans. \r\n\r\nThe
    designer, Phill Grimshaw, says that he was drawing Roman capitals, but when the
    serifs are amputated, the proportions  can perhaps be seen as a better fit to
    Greek inscriptions circa 500 B.C. than to the formal Roman capitals of the Trajan
    column. I would include the capital letters of ITC Tempus Sans in the group  loosely
    identified as \"Greek sans.\" \r\nSome interesting runners up:\r\nPlato\r\nhttp://www.identifont.com/show?G4N\r\nPaestum

  body: Good job guys, very similar. Perhaps one using the other for its source of
    creating it. It's very close but yeah I love the cleaner lines of this one. Will
    keep looking. Thanks.

  body: "I was curious how close the Crafts Study design is to ITC Tempus Sans so
    I smoothed out some letters in ITC Tempus Sans and compared them to the sample.
    I found that while the basic structure and feel is close, the positioning of the
    strokes is substantially different. If Crafts Study was made from ITC Tempus Sans,
    the designer did a considerable amount of editing in shifting the position of
    strokes. The designer might simply have drawn Crafts Study from scratch, using
    ITC Tempus Sans as a general reference. So there may very well be a new font for
    Crafts Study.\r\nIn any event I find the look of Crafts Study to be quite appealing
    and in some ways more suitable for Arts & Crafts type headings, posters etc than
    the ITC Tempus Sans or the several \"Greek sans\" that I mentioned. If you find
    a matching font I would be interested in any information that you could post here.\r\nDon"
