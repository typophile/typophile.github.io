    mark used in the polytonic orthography of Greek, marking the absence of an /h/
    sound in Ancient Greek for an initial vowel. It is also used to indicate the ejective
    or glottalized voice in Americanist orthography of several American languages,
    such as H\u0259nq\u0259min\u0259m (see [[http://www.languagegeek.com/salishan/henqeminem_text.html|this
    link]]). So Unicode uses the same code points for Greek and Latin.\r\n\r\nThe
    combining turned comma above, U+0312, is not used in Greek, and I'm not sure there
    are orthographies where it is used together with U+0313. But I suspect they can
    be flipped versions of each other.\r\n\r\nThis has nothing to do with the caron,
    even though dcaron, lcaron, and tcaron have superficially apostrophe-like carons."

    use or Greek. The Americanist linguistic orthographies originated in the typewriter
    era, so the original form for that variant of U+0313 was an actual comma. The
    Greek spiritus lenis has a somewhat different shape, more tightly curved than
    a comma. If you have Arno Pro, take a look at it for an example. Arno Pro mostly
    doesn't have combining diacritics, but you can look at U+1FBF (or U+1FBD), which
    is the spacing form of Greek U+0313. The spacing turned comma in Arno (U+02BB)
    is quite different, although in combination with g (U+0123) the difference is
    less."

    Indeed it seems common usage to make U+0313 look much like a comma."

  body: "Yes, sort of. I mentioned Arno just because they put a lot of good work into
    the polytonic Greek for it, but lots of other fonts are relevant too. Just for
    reference, here are the shapes in Arno, but Nick's examples work very well also.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/accent-breathing1_4639.png]\r\n\r\nIn
    Greek, U+0313 is the combining form of U+1FBF, and they should look the same.
    They are both breathing marks, and both should look like Nick's \"breathing\"
    form. \r\n\r\nThe problem is that Unicode has combined two similar but slightly
    different forms in U+0313. However, you probably aren't making a polytonic Greek
    character set. In a font that has extended Latin support but no polytonic Greek,
    a comma shape (Nick's \"accent\" form) is appropriate for U+0313. And actually
    even in a font with both extended Latin and polytonic Greek, if you have precomposed
    glyphs for all the polytonic Greek letters with breathing marks, then the U+0313
    grapheme can safely be comma-like, since it will only be seen in Latin contexts.\r\n\r\nOf
    course, the number of people who use polytonic Greek is probably several orders
    of magnitude larger than the number of people who use Salishan languages, not
    that either is of much commercial significance :)"

  body: 'Just one remark. Curiously enough, Unicode defines 77 precomposed Greek characters
    with psili from U+1F00 to U+1F30, for instance U+1F00, U+1F02, U+1F04. You can
    see them in the following Unicode chart: http://www.unicode.org/charts/PDF/U1F00.pdf.
    I downloaded the xml file containing <a href="http://archimedespalimpsest.net/Supplemental/ArchimedesTranscriptions/Method/"><strong>Archimedes
    Method</strong></a> in polytonic Greek. The character U+0313 does not occur even
    once in the file. There is however plenty of precomposed unicode tharacters with
    the psili. '

    you take a look at the Unicode code chart, you'll see that these precomposed characters
    decompose to sequences including U+0313. In theory (for the sake of machine text
    processing), the correct way to encode Greek in Unicode is to use the base character
    plus combining modifiers, but in practice people tend to use the precomposed forms,
    because these are much more widely supported by current software. The precomposed
    glyphs in the extended Greek section are a legacy of older standards that used
    different principles being folded into Unicode, sort of like the presentation
    forms in extended Arabic.\r\n\r\nThe precomposed forms contain all the glyphs
    that you need in normal everyday use, but for prosodic marking or certain situations
    involving transliteration from epichoric alphabets, you still need combining diacritics."

  body: "Polytonic Greek and Americanist orthography are unlikely to overlap in usage,
    but it's still a bit of a shame that Unicode decided to unify the combining psili
    with the combining comma above, considering the different design traditions for
    these two uses. But then there are other cases of unfortunate unifications in
    Unicode.\r\n\r\nI agree with David (archaica)'s recommendation about the design
    of the comma above. He has explained it nicely.\r\n\r\nIs the combining comma
    above used frequently in American orthographies? Many Salishan languages seem
    to use the modifier letter apostrophe to mark ejectives after the consonant, following
    IPA, instead of putting the comma above the consonant."

  body: "Good old U+0313. The combining comma is preferred by some communities and/or
    linguists, but other communities and/or linguists prefer the modifier apostrophe
    instead. (Linguists have often been the main arbiters of orthographic decisions,
    but this is changing nowadays.) Although for a while now the variation has been
    due to technical capabilities among computers and typesetting systems, it\u2019s
    largely an aesthetic issue at this point.\r\n\r\nWhen reproducing older texts,
    such as those gathered by linguists in the early 20th century, using the combining
    comma is obligatory if one aims for precise reproduction. And precise reproduction
    of old materials is becoming very important with the spread of digital language
    archives, endangered language corpora, and other language documentation efforts.\r\n\r\nBTW,
    the combining comma was used for quite a few other language families besides Salishan
    \u2013 and its neighbors Wakashan, Chimakuan, Chinookan, etc. \u2013 since nearly
    all languages in western North America have one or two ejectives. I\u2019ve also
    seen it used for Mesoamerican and South American languages, Siberian languages,
    and Caucasian languages. Basically anywhere an American linguist might have encountered
    ejectives, there you\u2019d find the combining comma pop up.\r\n\r\nIn linguistic
    transcription it\u2019s much less common in new work as people move to IPA, but
    transcription traditions in some circles can be extremely hard to change. In addition,
    historical linguists prefer to use older symbols rather than invent new ones due
    to the structure of their science, and so even people otherwise using IPA \u2013
    e.g. me \u2013 will maintain crufty old Americanist transcriptions in certain
    situations.\r\n\r\nI personally dislike the combining comma, but I think my dislike
    stems largely from its poor implementation in many fonts. I don\u2019t mind it
    too much when reading works set by the US Government Printing Office back before
    WWII, for example. (The USGPO printed for the Smithsonian, among a few other sources
    of linguistic research back then. Someone needs to do a typographic study of their
    practices and products over the years, which are a standing testament to the versatility
    of Scotch Modern.)\r\n\r\nAs for its relationship to the caron as used in dcaron,
    lcaron, tcaron, I don\u2019t think the combining comma should be considered related
    at all. The comma-accented caron is in my experience always an apostrophe shape,
    rather than the slightly smooshed appearance of many true combining commas. The
    two diacritics are in any case very different in their functions. You might also
    consider h-caron, i.e. U+0215 \u021F, which lacks the comma-accented form despite
    having an ascender because it lacks the weight of typographic tradition. It\u2019s
    used for IPA /\u03C7/, a voiceless uvular fricative, in some American languages."
