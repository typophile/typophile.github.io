  Wide in their logo and other marketing material. During this year I'll be making
  various stuff for them like a calendar, website, posters and a magazine.\r\n\r\nSo
  I need to find a serif companion to use in the magazine and on the posters to get
  some variation.\r\n\r\nAny and all suggestions appreciated\r\nPeter"

    sharpening your own choosing skills and dive into it. There are lost of resources
    where you can see typefaces in action. Just hold your sample of Dax Wide next
    to those \u2014 see if you like it and you\u2019re all set. Right?\r\n\r\n. .

  body: "Being a kind of indeterminate round/square face, Dax will mix well with other
    faces that have that quality.\r\nFor instance, in a headline type, something with
    slightly smoothed corners might be interesting. \r\n\r\nAnother thought: the \"Venetian\"
    angle of the crossbar in e suggests that Dax might pair well with Giovanni (which
    also has similar \"ascenders taller than caps\"), or my own <a href=\"http://www.shinntype.com/goodchild.html\">Goodchild.</a>\r\n\r\nDax's
    extremely short capitals suggest using another face with drastic short capitals,
    e.g. something by Les Usherwood such as Leawood.\r\n\r\nThe trick is to identify
    thematic features of the typeface and, as Bert suggests, look through type catalogues,
    or the FontBook, to find other faces with similar qualities.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Thanks, yes I will of course do as Bert suggested. Holding up diffrent versions
    next to Dax Wide and see what i like. I just wanted some suggestions, you never
    know, someone here might have found something that works great with Dax Wide.\r\n\r\nThe
    problem is going to try and convince them to buy a specific font. They do have
    a budget but we haven't discussed that part yet.\r\n\r\n\r\npeter"

    is also a serif version \u2013 FF Signa Serif. You might look at this.\r\nBTW.
    If you're searching for a quite readable \"Dax\", check out FF Daxline."
