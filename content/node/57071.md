  Friendly Font Pack]] ($10!) and I noticed that it contains the Matthew Carter typeface
  Nina. (It also contains Carl Crossgrove's Othello Pro, an added bonus).\r\n\r\nAny,
  about Nina...\r\n\r\nI've been doing a search for information about Nina, but all
  I can find is the the same droll marketing pitch on everything. \r\n\r\nAnyone have
  any knowledge of this typeface?"

    be something more about it in the book <em>Typographically Speaking</em>, by Margaret

    Books is showing that it is listed in the back section, \"Checklist of Typefaces
    Designed by Matthew Carter\"</a>. (I'm at work right now, so I can't go look at
    my copy.)"

  body: "Dan, have you seen <a href=\"http://www.microsoft.com/typography/links/news.aspx?NID=1470\"><em>this</em></a>
    Web page? If memory serves, Nina was designed for the smallish screen of Pocket
    PC 2000 (Si?). Its Cyrillic and Greek versions were developed not by Matthew Carter
    but by <a href=\"http://www.vu-par.com/WhoAre_F.htm\">Fran\xE7ois Villebrod</a>.
    I don\u2019t know who did the Hebrew."

  body: "Dan - yes, Nina was developed as a UI font and was used in Windows Mobile
    smartphones (Windows Mobile now uses Segoe, Microsoft's branding and UI font family).
    It can be considered part of the Tahoma and Verdana family. As you may know Verdana
    was designed along with Georgia for use with web pages (as the sans serif & serif
    fonts), and Tahoma was designed for the UI. Nina was designed to address the UI
    requirements on smaller screens such as phones, where every pixel counts, and
    where legibility and readability are even more critical. Hope this fills in the
    gaps from the above links.\r\n\r\nBill"
