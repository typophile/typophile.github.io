  body: "I would say this isn't a font at all, mainly because none of the tails on
    the g, j, or y are close to identical. Usually there would be some kind of uniformity.
    \r\n\r\nHowever, it could be something that someone manipulated from a basic face
    like sand. I yield to the experts on this site. \r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: I would disagree, as the "n", "o", "g" & "i" are identical to each other.
    I don't know which font it is, however.
