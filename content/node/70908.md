  downloaded the trial version of cs5 (previously using cs3) and have been working
  on stuff since yesterday without any issues...\r\n\r\ni'm working on a wedding invitation
  in illustrator using (of course) bickham script, and when i try to use an alternate
  glyph, it won't use the one i've selected \u2014\_it uses another alternate, and
  no matter what alternate i pick, it uses the same one. i've tried checking/unchecking
  all of the options in the opentype menu but nothing seems to solve the problem.
  i've also attempted to quit/restart illustrator and my computer, and i have the
  same problem. i've validated the font in fontbook, and it says it's fine...\r\n\r\ni'm
  confused and google searches won't bring anything up (at least, nothing that i've
  searched for has been successful) and this forum is the only place i could think
  of that may have experienced something similar. \r\n\r\nhelp? "

    (CS4), in which case the culprit was a style sheet that had some OpenType options
    pre-activated, which then proved, uh, difficult to override locally."

  body: Unfortunately this is a known bug in Illustrator CS5 that we just discovered.
    We are hoping it will get fixed sooner rather than later. It's a bit mysterious
    and we're still looking into it, so I don't yet know if there's a decent workaround.

  body: "oh. hm. \r\n\r\nwell, i guess that's sort of a relief... that there's nothing
    wrong with my font, and that it's not my fault. haha.. um. ok, now it's frustrating.

  body: I had a similar problem once, only with ligatures. It turned out to be added
    tracking that was causing it.

    month.
