  body: Difference in o leads me to believe this is hand drawn and not a font.

  body: It looks to me like a pasteup of copied letters. The third /o, the one on
    the right, is the same as the others, only slightly rotated. The /p is just an
    upside-down /d. Given that, I agree with Bob that it likely is hand-drawn.
