  help me find fonts similar to <a href=\"http://www.dafont.com/droid.font\">Droid</a>.\r\n\r\nI
  have the font I want in my mind, but I just can't or don't know how to find it.\r\n\r\nIt
  could be <a href=\"http://www.goodmagazine.com/\">Good magazine</a>'s font, but
  somewhat more \"rounded\", retro-but-not-too-retro style.\r\n\r\nAnyone? I would
  really appreciate any suggestions."
