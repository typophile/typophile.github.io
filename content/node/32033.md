  graphic design school and she asks from time to time for help, right now she needs
  me to help her find a quote from one or each of the following, Robert Besley, Claude
  Garamond or Francesco Griffo.\r\n\r\nIf any body has any info on where I can find
  these or if somebody has any, I (she) will really appreciate it.\r\nI thank you
  in advance.\r\n\r\nbadbye"
