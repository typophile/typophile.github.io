Now is for real. No more 'friendlies' where points are not at stake and may bore the audience. What do you think or bet will survive and get to the finals?
[img:sites/default/files/old-images/groups_4754.gif]
Feel free to add your bet or hopes. Just add a related or unrelated font if you will.
As I write this it is 4 hours and 12 minutes to the kick off...

Surely the link between music and typography is Apple? Apple invented both digital typography and digital music. </div>

<div class=commentbody>So far the only things I've really paid attention to has been type treatment in shirts (font/gemena/capitals) and team logos (the Swiss team had a new one).

Maybe it is that people get a big kick out of both of them or just that they are having a ball while talking type? Either way, it's hands off for the non-footballers here and a heads-up to those willing to toe the line :-)

The great ideal of dutch football has always been to play effective but not without playing beautiful as well.
Tonight they beat the current world champion Italy 3:0.
They could make it to the final (against Germany maybe?).</div>

God, I hope those Italians get sent home as soon as possible. As for the Dutch football style, if those long passes weren't beautiful, I don't know what is. Good job, Oranje.</div>

<div class=commentbody>I'd love to see a Type Design Euro 2008 where representative typefaces from each of the 16 countries battle each other. But due to my lack of knowledge, I'm afraid I can't name a single type design from Romania, Croatia, Turkey, Austria, and Poland...
It would be interesting to compare type design and footballing prowesses of the Euro 2008 participants. Type-wise, my hunch would be that the Netherlands become strong favourites.

Spain 4 - 0 Russia had a lot of gols, Oléeee! It is going to be exciting to find out if Spain will make it better this time around. For forty something years they have been under achieving on big competitions...
I highlight the awesome performance of <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zlatan_Ibrahimović>Ibrahimović</a> who scored a BIG one against Greece.
I guess that in every café bar in Portugal people were delighted when that ball got in ;-). I say that because the last Euro final, the Greeks took it...
I couldn't find a better picture of Ibrahimović, but this one is fun ;;-)

<div class=commentbody><cite>Spain 4 - 0 Russia had a lot of gols, Oléeee!</cite>
You mean Spain 4 - 1 Russia. So that's even more goals. Spain were mighty impressive, but one does feel bad about Russia having to play without Arshavin (suspended for first two matches) and Pogrebnyak (out injured), two of their best players who guided Zenit St. Petersburg to the UEFA Cup title.
Russia have struggled internationally since the former Soviet teams all went their separate ways (with a few exceptions like Lev Yashin, most former Soviet stars were non-Russian), but I thought that for once they had a genuine pool of talent. I guess the only Cyrillic users among the Euro 2008 participants are too young and inexperienced. With Greece struggling as well, it's back to Latin-alphabet dominance in the European Championships.
Pop quiz: when were the two times that a non-Latin-alphabet-using team won the European Championships?</div>

<div class=commentbody>What an eventful night.
Jon Bon Jovi delayed his Amsterdam concert until the game had ended. Minutes after the final whistle he came up and started with an inpromptu "Rocking all over the world" -- wearing the national shirt!
(The rest of the concert was awesome as well, an entertaining and surprising mix of golden hits and some of his latest, including an extra long version of "Keep the faith". A Very Good Evening. My sympathy goes out to my poor brother Henk, who supplied the tickets but had to forego 'cause he had a nasty accident, involving a few beers, a bike, a lamp post, and his face, in that order...)</div>

<div class=commentbody>As favorably inclined as he was towards all things British, Argentine writer Jorge Luis Borges was not a fan of football. He is supposed to have said, "El fútbol es popular porque la estupidez es popular." In translation, "Football is popular because stupidity is popular."
I happen to love football, but I do see that football is often used as an excuse for displays of frightening stupidity. Istanbul in recent memory has been the setting of a particularly tragic incident, the stabbing deaths of two English fans who had come for a UEFA Cup match. So I see how David can feel that way about football.
By the way, I don't get the point of that Google search result comparison. Soccer is only used for association football, but football is used for several different variations including the rugby codes, American football, Aussie rules, and Gaelic football, so it will get a lot of non-association-football hits. Also, contrary to popular belief, 'soccer' is not a uniquely North American term; it is also used by Australians, New Zealanders, and many Anglophone Africans.</div>

<div class=commentbody>I was thinking that today I would place some info about <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guus_Hiddink>Guus Hiddink</a>, for the excellent job he did with many national teams. I am a fan, specially international sports, being soccer / football (or vise-versa) one my favorites. That is why I started this thing. Mixing or relating typography to football or soccer is that easy. I do see it, and if it is just me, that is even more interesting :-)
I started to collect some links at some point cause I just wanted this to go on without incidents, and the results are random search results that have or may not have a relationship with the main topic, Type & Football / Soccer (or vise-versa). I will go ahead and speculate: Football is News, News is Interest which lead us to text and imaginery that will some how be imprinted to a surface being it paper or computer screen, or whatever it will be in 110 years (lasers ? ).
And that is all there is to it. It is really fun, come on ? Is it not ?
As for <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jorge_Luis_Borges>Jorge Luis Borges</a>: Once a friend of mine told me while we were on a touristic incursion in the Costa Brava; he said "Borges used to write like a englishman". My friend is Argentine. So my replay to him was "Borges writes like Borges - <a href="http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=boludo">boludo...</a>". I suppose he (Borges) said that because of <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colosseum>this</a>, and if it is not a starting point to answer the question as if to be or not in a 50 thousand people crowed may result in physical damages or bumps, it will certainly end up with more questions.
The thing with Soccer v Football search result comes from exactly it: Soccer is Football and Football is Soccer. I am sorry I can not be more vague about it. Thank God I did not mixed Soccer and Football (or vice-versa) on this <a href=http://www.typophile.com/node/46055>fashion.</a>

Now the picture is taking form. It will be one of these teams to move up to the next level:
Sweden or Russia?
Romania, France or italy?
That will make to the next quarter-finals. It could be Italy, as they are always helped by the Ball Gods. We will see.
I don't like the idea that Germany - Portugal comes this soon in the competition, but hey, whatever. This could benefit other teams, and, maybe, just maybe we could have a unexpected champion: Romania, Spain or Turkey...

<div class=commentbody>I’m not very optimistic. Of course I hope our boys make it but if they play like in the last two matches they won’t beat Portugal.
Russia played really well tonight.
I’m looking forward to seeing them against Oranje.
BTW - what does “Podolski, sì alla Juve” mean?
Any Italians around? Podolski scored three times for Germany so far.</div>

<div class=commentbody>@ clintonite " anyone know what the dutch font is? ".
I was told that most of these fonts or similar ones are found on Dha Phont.
I think Germany did not played well in two matches. Their first match was very good. Anyway, having a very good first round does not mean that you are going to make it to the end... Italy seems to play bad at start, as I have seen before, and make it to the final...
I like to point that Croacia, Turkey and Russia are the ones to be looking at. Another very interesting match will be Netherlands - Russia; Guus Hiddink is excellent and has proven to be a super coach and the russians are playing a good ball.
Here, a better picture of the coming matches:

<div class=commentbody>Oy Vay,
I actually watched the turkey-croatia match yesterday on a hd projector at some friends house, in istanbul. the house was filled with 9 guests, 8 of them turkish (the 9th one being me). and though I really dont like football, I have to admit that it was unbelievable. And the way back home was also interesting.
I can't imagine how its gonna be if they win again on wednesday.

Turkey is in for the next big one. Against all odds: 119th minute comes immediately before 120th minute.

Well, actually the thing is, if you don’t score as much as the other team, you lose.
Goals so far in the tournament:
Turkey: 6
Germany: 7
I think the Ball Gods had so much work supporting Turkey that they might be exhausted.</div>

They have got 2 keepers. It is going to take a lot of water! Germany has more rest then Turkey, that is a disadvantage. The way I see it, anything could happen, but all points to the favorite.
I am expecting a great match today. Is Russia going to do one of theirs? I am sure the Orange will provide. Enjoy!</div>

After a interval since the last big one, here goes a calling for your bets.
I have found DW-World which has news in many languages. I tried to pull another nice cover but I was unable to get one. If you do know where to find one, feel free to place it here.

As if we all know already who is going to move to the final, it still is uncertain: You never know what is going to happen. Sometimes things just happen by chance, and this game is full of it. if you are german I know exactly where your cheering is going, but, again, I would say that this is up to the gods.
Enjoy and don't forget the BIG mug of beer

Indeed sire, you know you game. By the way, sorry that the Orange didn't
make it ;-)
Yes, I sincerely didn't know what to think; the turkish players didn't want to
give it up. They were down few key player with injuries.
Germany played well, not playing well. As is characteristic of the germans, they controlled somewhat the game and not taking risks. Again, as expected.
That soccer, footbal, fussball, fútbol &c. is a game of violentia I totally desagree.
It in the end creates a atmosphere that embraces everyone envolved —but that goes for international competitions only, where the players make little money and without clubes pulling the strings.
I will go on and come back up with a nice ending report of the final.
