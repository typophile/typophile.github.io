body: "This pediment was broken during a building renovation, and I need to find a
  font that closely matches to create a replacement stone. I know the original \"1942\"
  was probably carved by hand, but unfortunately the budget does not allow for that
  now. Any suggestions on a font that gets close?\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/1942_5771.jpg]"
