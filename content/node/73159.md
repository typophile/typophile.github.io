  from the Modern family. Really love Miller and Monotype Modern but I'm hoping to
  find something that is less commercial and exposed, something a little more unique.
  \r\nAny suggestions would be appreciated!\r\nThanks in advance!"

    not great as a text face. If I use Scotch for display purposes what would you
    suggest as a suitable text face?\r\nThanks again."

    differ, which is why I revived this style in the first place.\r\nSure, it bucks
    conventional wisdom -- for some reason art directors consider 400 (Garamond) and
    500 (Bembo) -year old designs more readable than a 150-year old design. Sackbutts
    over saxophones. Go figure. "

    believe the sackbut is an ancestor of the trombone; well said nonetheless...)"

    out yet. It has only been available for a few months.

  body: The Scotch Modern style is very handsome, and seems to have returned to vogue.
    I would also agree with Nick that his Scotch Modern is quite readable, and it's
    on my shortlist for the right project sometime...I quite like it. (Props, Mr Shinn)
