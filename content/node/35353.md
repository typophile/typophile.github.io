body: "Hello Typophiles!  So, I after giving my second round of this logo to the client,
  she has gotten back to me and told me that she cant decide so she wants me to...and
  i just can't handle this kind of pressure!  I was hoping I could get some opinions
  from any and all on which version of the logo they like the best.  Critique on how
  I can make the logo better (without modifying it too much as the client is expecting
  to see something similar) would be great as well!\r\n\r\nClient: Salon \r\n\r\nThe
  variations:  On the top you will notice the \"M\" is a bit wider.  I drew this type
  by hand and kind of just eyeballed it at first and this is how it ended up.  Upon
  shrinking the logo down, i noticed that (at least I thought) the M seemed a bit
  wide for the rest of the set.  I know that that is allowed, but it seemed to look
  odd to me so i created the bottom two with this is mind.  The only other variance
  is of course the flourish off the the last A.\r\n\r\nPlease let me know what you
  think, like, and dislike! TIA!\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/mslnlogo_6022.jpg]"

    the first two, and the flourish on the A seems more natural on v3 than v\r\n\r\nIt'd
    be cool if you could break that M somewhere to match the D, all the variance seems
    to be at the end of the word... but you said you're picking from these 4, so I
    guess that's of little-to-no-importance.\r\n\r\nAll that said, version 3 would
    be my choice."

  body: "thanks for the comments!  And good suggestion on breaking the M, i will give
    it a go (a change like that seems minimal enough that it might be cool with her).
    \ \r\n\r\nI was leaning towards v4 because it seemed more fluid to me (the flourish
    seemed to flow better), but hmm....now you've got me thinking."

  body: "I like V3 as well. The flourish on V4 feels a little awkward with that abrupt
    change in direction. I still think the angle on the M could be more decisive.
    Everything else looks like it has a place but the M still needs more to relate
    to. Using the angle of the A's might be too much but maybe tightening it up to
    a 90\xB0 could help relate to the geometric construction. I would also tighten
    the kerning between the A and I, or open it up a little next to the D. Key word
    is decisiveness. "

  body: I like v3 best in concept, but I think the flourish still needs work. Try
    to get it closer to something like a logarithmic spiral.

  body: "Exactly. V3 is better but the curve is bumpy. Make it more spiral. Mathematically
    correct. It will probably have to be a bit bigger to match the letters.\r\n\r\nWhat
    I would suggest is to also try and join the D (I don't see a reason if the A doesn't
    have a cross bar that D should be broken) and make M just as big as other letters.
    I still find it distracting in V3 and V4. You're having some problems with ID
    combination at the bottom because D is broken.\r\n\r\nIs this some hair salon
    or something like that?\r\n\r\nAnd when you present the next image of the logo
    (especially this one that will have a lot of breathing space around it), please
    make it breathable and use some more spacing. It's easier to see the goods and
    the bads if the surrounding area is not distracting."

  body: "ktz, v3 works pretty good. Agree with Litera and Cerulean on the spiral and
    reworking the M. Russ's approach is nice, but I like your original D and weight
    used on the letters. It just feels more original.\r\n\r\nwww.holadesignstudio.com"
