  for children to read? The single-story \"y\" and \"g\", the \"a\", etc., all look
  rather amusing and fun. They seem to be more decorative variants of the parent font,
  however. \r\n\r\nI assume children find it easier to read this sort of type. Correct?
  Is it that the single-story shapes are perhaps less complicated and more readily
  recognizable by children? Or is it that these characteristic letter shapes themselves
  are smaller and more compact variants, therefore making them \"infants\"?\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\n\r\nChristian."

    differentiated and based on forms easily recognizable by beginning readers and
    writers. I can't say whether or not there is any basis for this assumption.

  body: I think the idea is that the shapes are more similar to the shapes that are
    used when basic handwriting (block letters) is taught, so they're not confused
    by the inconsistency. I'm not sure it matters. Kids aren't that dumb. They catch
    on pretty quick, in spite of the inconsistencies and exceptions. They learn English,
    don't they?

    just as learning to write Chinese characters takes extra time in school, so does
    learning how to spell correctly in English.\r\n\r\nOf course, this slight disadvantage
    is compensated for by the fact that English-speakers don't have to spend a lot
    of time in school trying seriously to learn any second language, thus its technical
    and scientific leadership was attainable, however much it seems that at present
    we are bur resting on our laurels."

  body: "Riccardo, thanks for digging up those older threads. In addition to what
    Mark said, I repeat what I have written before:\r\n\r\nIn my opinion, the significance
    of a single-storey \u2018a\u2019 for children is, at least, debatable. Such a
    typeface might come in handy for teachers, when it is both used for reading and
    (as a model for) writing. Apart from that, the benefit of avoiding confusion of
    \u2018a\u2019 and \u2018a\u2019 is soon outweighed by the potential \u2013 and
    likely \u2013 confusion of \u2018a\u2019 and \u2018o\u2019.\r\n\r\nChildren are
    not stupid, they can handle more than one representational form per character.
    Their world doesn\u2019t end at the edges of their primer. They do spot and effortlessly
    read a lot of different \u2018a\u2019 glyphs every day: caps, italics, serifs,
    sans-serifs, scripts, fat letters, condensed letters, single-storey and double-storey
    \u2026\r\n\r\nFurthermore, here\u2019s what the researchers involved in the <a
    href=\"http://www.kidstype.org/\">Typographic Design for Children Project</a>
    at the Department of Typography & Graphic Communication (University of Reading)
    have found out about <a href=\"http://www.kidstype.org/The%20project/Testing%20typography/Typefaces/typefaces.html#infant%20character\">infant
    characters</a>:\r\n\r\n\u201CMost children in our study were well aware that there
    were different forms of a and g, and some even made the point that single storey
    a's and g's are what we write and double-storey a's and g's are what we read.
    Some commented favourably about what they perceived as the 'normal' g used in
    Gill Schoolbook.\r\n\r\nOther thought that double-storey a's and g's were 'harder'
    than single-storey a's and g's, but this did not affect their reading performance.\r\n\r\nIf
    infant characters are used it is important that there is clear differentiation
    between charactes such as o, a and g. This is the case in Gill Educational, for
    example, but not in Avant Garde Gothic or Helvetica.\u201D\r\n\u2014 <a href=\"http://www.kidstype.org/The%20project/Testing%20typography/Typefaces/typefaces.html#infant%20character\">

  body: "Thank you for the informative replies!\r\n\r\nI certainly find infant variants
    of typefaces interesting to read - \"interesting\" in the fact that their single-story
    letter features tend to jump out at me as oddities. As an advanced reader I (like
    most of us are) I'm capable of reading even partially obscured letterforms, partial
    words, etc. One learns to recognize words and entire phrases in even the poorest
    of conditions. Of course, I'm speaking as an adult. \r\n\r\nAs for children, I
    think the issue is not as clear as some would like to think. While infant letterforms
    might mimic a child's handwriting (typically, at least), the child must eventually
    move on to fill the grown-up shoes of readers who are more readily familiar with
    standard letterforms. Which is especially true in this day and age of typed/on-screen
    material. Handwritten material (with a few exceptions) is going the way of the
    dinosaur. It might be best to move children into reading standardized type as
    soon as possible. perhaps avoiding infant variants entirely. Of course, this raises
    the issue of the importance of handwriting as an important step in the development
    of literacy."

    present four studies indicating that the size and design of the typeface in textual
    material for children aged 7-9 may impair speed of reading and comprehension,
    and measurement of reading attainment. The first study compared the speed with
    which sample sentences were comprehended. The sentences were printed in Arial
    font with an x-height of 4.2 or 5.0\u2009mm. The sentences were verified 9% more
    quickly when presented in the larger typeface. The second study compared reading
    age on the Salford Sentence Reading Test when the typeface remained at the initial
    size (x-height 3.3\u2009mm) throughout the test, and when it decreased in size
    as usual. The average reading age measured with the larger font was 4 months older.
    The final studies compared the font Sassoon Primary with the font Verdana and
    showed that Verdana was read and searched more quickly."

    on the one hand, or Gill into Futura on the other (e.g. for Europe). \r\n\r\nMight
    it not be that the type already existed (for grown-up aesthetic reasons) when

    example.\r\nMincho is an ordinary book typeface which is equivalent of Roman in
    western world. Japanese schoolbook face is aimed to provide a good example of
    written form (with pencil). It has some different stroke from Mincho, in which
    many strokes are stylized. Hiragana has shorter swash in each stroke to make children
    to learn how to achieve legibility. This typeface is used in primary shool books
    (age 6-12). After that, Mincho replaces it entirely.\r\n\r\nGoing back to Latin,
    as many people said already, I assume that the whole purpose of schoolbook typeface
    is that to teach children how to write (than to read). Therefore I think serifed
    schoolbook faces are pointless (e.g. Bembo). Upright italic typeface with serifless
    capital letters satisfies the purpose much more effectively. Hopefully, it should
    be monolinear to imitate pencil writing (Is this the reason why Comic Sans is
    popular in schools? At least I'm convinced). And it should be replaced with roman
    as soon as children become aware of the difference bewteen written form and typographic
    form."

    children. If they are being taught to print one way, then the reading material
    they see in class should, presumably, be made the <em>same</em> way - at least
    if it's sans-serif.\r\n\r\nThis, of course, doesn't require extensive research
    on testing reading speeds. Instead, it has to do with the questions students ask
    teachers, or errors made when children print by imitating the printed model. Even
    if such typefaces aren't used in books, they might be used in display charts illustrating
    the alphabet.\r\n\r\nOf course, this suggests the use of faces that simulate handprint
    instead of Infanta variants of normal typefaces. Fortunately, though, it is unlikely
    that anyone will stoop to teaching the children of the future to read with Comic
    Sans or anything similar. (And then there's the culturally-sensitive and politically-correct
    Papyrus...)\r\n\r\nI know that when I was young, although Century Schoolbook was
    used for early readers, there was a sense that the \"canonical\" form of the print
    alphabet was Caslon - all other typefaces being deviations from that one truth.

    over the place, not just in class. Most of the letters they see do not use the
    \"infant\" forms, so restricting the materials used in their class materials is
    of minimal help.\r\n\r\n- They already have to learn 52 letters, 10 numerals,
    and and assorted punctuation. Maybe about 65-70 characters altogether. Learning
    just a couple of variants is really going to be that hard?\r\n\r\n- If you want
    to avoid confusing them, actively *teach* them that these letters can take two
    different forms. They are going to encounter them anyway. What will really confuse
    them is encountering them without being told what they are! Similarly for sans
    vs serif and other concerns....\r\n\r\n- The one and only study on the subject,

    selling points (and a problem) of these schoolbook versions is that we think children
    have a lot of difficulty understanding letterforms because of our adult conventions,
    For adults it is more difficult to learn different shapes since we are not used
    to them, for children this is far easier since they see every letterform in a
    different context anyway.\r\n\r\nSo actually we make it much harder than it should
    be. Of course there are other problems, such as dyslexia, but a simple schoolbook
    type solution won't help there (nor will some of the so-called dyslexia-fixing
    typefaces, which complicate the matter by introducing far too many variables instead
    of looking for a simple solution)\r\n\r\nSince trying to teach children writing
    in block letters has been extremely sub par, the difference between the taught
