  body: It may be custom, but it reminds me a bit of VGC&#39;s Glyphic Series and
    the closest contempory match to that face is Typeco&#39;s <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/typeco/glyphic-neue/medium/testdrive.html?s=simon%20SIMON&amp;p=60">Glyphic
    Neue</a>. It&#39;s not a perfect match, but it&#39;s similar in weight and stress.

    to approximate the same look. It&#39;s reasonably close.
