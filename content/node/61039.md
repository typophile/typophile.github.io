  body: "I can't get the link to work, but the image you posted looks like a simplified
    version of Old English. Sometimes the blackletter types are not easy (enough)to
    read, so custom versions are designed to make the letters simpler and more legible
    to modern readers. The cliche of blackletter type for newspaper titles seems to
    be a kind of joke to me these days. No one thinks we could recognize a newspaper
    without that type style on the masthead?\r\n\r\nAt least USA Today gets credit
    for that much sense. They made something recognizable without blackletter.\r\n\r\n-
