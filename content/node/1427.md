  body: these sites are so tiny. everything about them is tiny. only a geek would
    bother pressing his face so close to a screen to read them. flash is so memory
    intensive &#40;yesm even with high-speed&#41; it make speople program words and
    images very tiny. I found all of the above sites and links inconsequential because
    of their small size. they just don&#39;t matter.

  body: '&#34;these sites are so tiny.&#34; <BR> <BR>well, I&#39;m working at 1152x870
    and I see no problem  <BR>with any of the listed sites. some of them lean to the  <BR>small
    end of the scale, but thanks to nice bitmap type, I  <BR>had no problem making
    out the letters &#40;though, I can&#39;t  <BR>read spanish&#41;. <BR> <BR>as for
    Flash sites, I&#39;m not a fan either. they tend to  <BR>move slowly and cause
    crashes &#40;for me, anyway&#41;. but  <BR>they do provide the most flexibility
    for those wanting to  <BR>showcase their design, and they allow for zooming in  <BR>on
    type.'

    <BR>When I decided in college &#40;in Mexico City&#41; that for my thesis I wanted
    to design a typeface all my teachers were completely baffled. There was only one
    teacher who had taken type design courses in Switzerland and she was the dean.
    I didn&#39;t get much help from <i>Academia</i>. <BR> <BR>Tiypo, I think, is still
    going. I recently e-mailed Paco and he talks about it like it&#39;s still alive.
    <BR> <BR>The magazine Matiz &#40;you can read about it in Step and Comm Arts&#41;
    was one of the first and greatest forums for showcasing mexican typography and
    it kicked absolute &#149;&#149;&#149;. Too bad it&#39;s gone now. Nacho Peon &#40;<a
    href="http://www.igloodesign.net" target="_blank">http://www.igloodesign.net</a>&#41;
    and his sister Monica Peon did some great typefaces for that magazine and for
    personal use too. <BR> <BR>Right now, I have no clue what is going on, since I&#39;m
    very removed from the professional designers back home. It seems like they are
    a little late to the party '

    know if Mexico is the best place for that.'
