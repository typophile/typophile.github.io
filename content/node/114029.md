  body: "Looks like a font to me. Note the repeating letters are the same.\r\nEasy
    to make this type of font and quite a few are available.\r\nStill no exact match
    but you might like Face Type's Strangelove as a substitute http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/facetype/strangelove/
    The name might have ironic connotations for a wedding but refers to Dr.  Strangelove,
    Stanley Kubrick\u2019s cinematic masterpiece about the end of the world in nuclear
    war. Don't miss Captain Kong with his cowboy hat riding the H-bomb like a bronco
    as it is dropped from the bomb bay of a B-52 or the beautiful melody of Vera Lynn
    singing Until We Meet Again as the bombs explode all over the world. Great lettering
    in a well constructed font. \r\nDon\r\n"

    not the same indeed. \r\nI quite liked the \"S\" and the \"J\" letters as they
    are in the wedding invite\u2014narrow but still sort of \"open\". \r\n\r\nPerhaps
    any other suggestions on narrow fonts?\r\n\r\nC.\r\nPS: Dr. Strangelove, excellent

    hope I am not being difficult, but there is something very simple about the strokes
    in that wedding card font that is just what I am looking for. It has a sort of
    modernist feel to it. Do you know what I mean? It's kind of a condensed Gotham,
    but handwritten...\r\n\r\nTks!\r\n\r\nC."

    because any keyword I think to use (or that the designer assigns themselves) yields
    all sorts of very different fonts."
