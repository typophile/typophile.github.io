body: 'Is blackletter masculine, while Roman is feminine? <BR>It tends to be darker,
  but also narrower, but certainly more rigid and angular too. <BR> <BR>If so: <BR>Is
  contemporary typography overly feminine, making a blackletter revival [even more]
  justified? <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>'

  body: Certainly, in a general sense, more and better black-  <BR>letter types can
    be offered that give an art director more   <BR>range or a broader palette to
    work from. But to suggest   <BR>that a revival is more justified because of masculine   <BR>qualities
    is a stretch.  <BR>  <BR>A revival is an organic thing, it won&#39;t come from
    a panel   <BR>of specialized practitioners. Getting type designers to   <BR>create
    a revival is like trying to push a string. You have   <BR>to get end-users &#40;graphic
    designers, etc.&#41; to use it.  <BR>  <BR>Perhaps a better approach to help it
    back into the   <BR>mainstream &#40;which it certainly deserves!&#41; would be
    to   <BR>raise awareness and provide more research. The kind   <BR>you&#39;ve
    already shown. This will give designers the   <BR>courange to use it and the ammunition
    to sell it to their   <BR>clients.  <BR>  <BR>An example. A recent project I did
    for a biotech firm   <BR>involved creating a program for their key customers.   <BR>The
    program had to be &#39;trusted,&#39; &#39;exclusive&#39; and   <BR>&#39;professional&#39;
    without being &#39;promotional.&#39; One of the   <BR>directions we pitched was
    a blackletter word mark. The   <BR>client initially loved it for it&#39;s journalistic
    flavor, but in the   <BR>user testing it totally backfired. The users believed
    it to   <BR>be too &#39;journalistic.&#39; The audience is generally used to   <BR>being
    misrepresented in the media, and therefore the   <BR>program would lose credibility.
    I wouldn&#39;t expect this   <BR>broad perception, among this audience, to change
    in   <BR>their lifetimes. But that won&#39;t stop me from trying it  <BR>again,
    given an appropriate audience.  <BR>  <BR>I&#39;d love to start a thread here
    showing some good   <BR>blackletter usage.

  body: what i like about blackletter is its androgeny. i really like the contrast
    of the strong dark forms and the delicate embelishments and script inspired forms.
    Even texturas which i&#39;d say lean more masculine in the blackletter family
    have the graceful gothic capitals. maybe frakturs are more masculine, but the
    influence of the brush infuses femininity to my interpretation of the letterforms.
    I&#39;d place rotundas more on the femenine side, but the heavy strokes and unfussy
    forms lend a hint of masculinity. To me roman forms are more masculine with their
    rigid structure brought basically into alignment of the stone chiseled forms.
    Actually I think most types have a good balance between the masculine and the
    femenine. What makes us want to classify a type as one or the other? It&#39;s
    interesting to think about.

    exactly! And this androgeny is superbly encapsulated in the fraktur &#34;o&#34;.
    <BR> <BR>But you really think Roman is masculine? It&#39;s all round and airy
    - very feminine to me. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>'

  body: actually i&#39;d say the majascule is more masculine and the miniscule more
    feminine but the contrasting angular/rounded nature of the modern roman alphabet
    gives it great balance. I&#39;m particularly fond of it myself. but again why
    am i sexxing type? LOL!

    usually just a matter of curves... ^.^

  body: I think curves &#40;in a broad sense&#41; can look masculine and some feminine.
    It&#39;s probably very personnal too. Just to go countercurrent, I&#39;d say Bembo
    looks masculine and Frutiger looks feminine to me. I could go in details why but
    I&#39;d need to know the english vocabulary for the letter parts and I don&#39;t
    yet =&#41; <BR> <BR>

  body: I think subtle details are very feminine and things that are more chiseled
    are more masculine. <BR> <BR>Seriously though, it would be nice to figure this
    type gender stuff out, maybe it would help make some logos targetting women less
    cheesy-looking.  <BR> <BR>This reminds me of Hrant&#39;s post about Mrs. Eaves
    being a beautiful woman with a speech problem. Each have their own personnality,
    we could probably even put photos next to them =&#41; <BR>
