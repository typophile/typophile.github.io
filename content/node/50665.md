  wine producers to help people who need to relabel old bottles (and for general interest).
  Most are quite straight-forward, but I\u2019m completely stuck on [[http://www.warre.com|Warre\u2019s]]
  which has recently switched to the open/engraved typeface below. It looks to me
  a bit like a Baskerville, but I can\u2019t find any mention of an open/engraved
  Baskerville. \r\n\r\nFrom the way they use it in their publicity materials, it looks
  like they do have a full font rather than just five custom letters and I think it\u2019s
  unlikely that they invested in a private design.\r\n\r\nAny thoughts would be gratefully
  received!"

    looking again, I wonder if they have used some sort of fake-bold version of it?
    There\u2019s an awkward-looking gap between the \u201Cshadow\u201D (not sure of
    the right term!) of the leg and the bowl of the R which I could imagine resulting
    from some sort of automated processing."
