  map, but the font has some surprising features for what looks to be a fairly standard
  looking gothic sans design. Note the triangular De and El, for example.\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/spammap_5943.jpg]\r\n\r\n\r\nSorry
  for the large image. That's how it came to me."

  body: I suspected it was Franklin Gothic. That 8 is a bit of a giveaway. Of course,
    not having a recent version of MS Office there is no way I could find a match
    for it. Thanks.
