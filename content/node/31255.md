  the FF Milo Regular for free?\r\n\r\nThank you."

  body: I was able to download it then, but if your question goes beyond merely interest
    in who was able to download it and you're asking if someone can send it to you,
    I don't think that most around here would consider that to be ethical. Foundries
    like FontShop make fonts available for free at their own discretion, so if they
    decide to only allow a font to be available for download for a limited time, then
    it is not up to one of us to decide that it should be downloadable in any other
    context. Sorry if that's what you're asking; maybe you can scrounge up the money
    somewhere to buy it, as there's nothing better than buying the perfect font for
    a project.

    trial versions of the full families. If you'd like to get more samples of FF Milo,
    give FontShop a call.

    web site you have to buy it. Otherwise its stealing.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.fontshop.com/features/free.cfm
    \r\n\r\nTo find more new fonts: Clan and Preface. Both very legal downloads. Very
    nice too.\r\n\r\nMikey"

  body: "No problem. I think its great too. In fact its on my buy list. You should
    have a look at Fedra by Typotheque too. Milo looks very much inspired by Fedra.
    Fedra really has some quirky details: the dot over the i, the capital R, lowercase
    k, lowercase b. I would say its very special. Milo is much more neutral and utilitarian
    but it is gorgeous anyhow. Have a gander Kievit- from the same guy a Milo- Michael
    Abbink.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.typotheque.com/data/specimens/pdf/FedraSansPro.pdf\r\n\r\nI
    see this is your first post- welcome to Typophile.\r\n\r\n\r\nMike Diaz :-)"

    clear with my post. I was trying to say that it's always best practice to contact
    the source for a clarification of their policy rather than assume it's ok to distribute
    the fonts."

  body: "Hey Mike, thanks for the links. FF Sanuk Fat looks indeed pretty fat altough
    is a good set. Kievit looks pretty similar as Milo. But I think Milo set stills
    have some more charming details then Kievit.\r\n\r\nAnd I\xB4ll try to contact
    fontshop to ask for an authorization to get the FF Milo from you guys were smart
    enough to get it in the right time.\r\n\r\nRegards."

  body: "All right. To clear things out, wich means I\xB4ve lost the oportunity of
    my life. Hope they will give away FF Milo again in the next future:\r\n\r\n\"Unfortunately
    the posting on Typophile was misleading and we only offer the free fonts for a
    limited time. If you do not download the font while its available on FontShop.com
    then you must purchase a license for use.  If you do download the font while it
    is available from our site you may keep it indefinitely however you may never
    send it to anyone else or distribute it in anyway.\r\n\r\nI've contacted Typophile
    and the recipient of the posted email to have both removed to avoid any future
    confusion.\" \r\n"
