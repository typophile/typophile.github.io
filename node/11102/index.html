The ankh fits in so well with the dagger and double dagger that I include it in all my fonts as a potentially useful symbol or ornament.

		<div class="commentbody">This is nice. Agree with the comments so far, and yes Hrant you were being a bit harsh. ;-) Yes, perhaps the 'E' is too narrow, and while I appreciate the idea behind the 'B' perhaps it as well is a bit tricky. But that 'U' is wonderful. The '0' looks like a football to these old eyes. I *LOVE* the 'g' and the overall flavor. If you are attempting to show rubrication on the '¶', perhaps the thicker vertical stroke should be in the center. The 'fj' ligature is too wide as perhaps is the 'ft' lig. The idea of the  ankh is nice too. What if you lowered the cross stroke so you could elongate the opening and make it look less 'martian' like too?</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Thanks for the suggestions, Hrant, Joe &amp; Tiffany. <BR> <BR>Hrant: You're right about the &quot;@&quot; (at), and you and Tiffany are correct on the &quot;0&quot; (zero) as well. (It seemed a good idea on paper.) I'll try an approximation of a super-ellipse. <BR> <BR>Wish me luck designing the lower-case figures&hellip;. <BR> <BR>I'll re-examine the widths of the upper case set. I really do want to try to keep the classically narrow glyphs narrow, but one more pica might be in order, especially for UC &quot;E&quot;, &quot;F&quot; and maybe &quot;L&quot;. I think the UC &quot;B&quot; will work at its current width, but I may have to give up on the smaller upper curve. <BR> <BR>Joe: As far as that tricky UC &quot;W&quot; goes, I haven't (yet) been able to make the crossings work properly with the pixels, resulting in some extremely clogged glyphs. The result that you saw posted was the least objectionable of the various options that I tried. I'll give it another look, though &ndash; in fact, I would prefer it if I could get the double-V to work. The true solution is out there, Scully&hellip;. <BR> <BR>&hellip;which leads us to the alien ankh. <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif" ALT=":&#41;"> <BR> <BR>Tiffany: your suggestion makes perfect sense, and I will incorporate it, posthaste. I also like your idea on the &quot;¶&quot; (pilcrow), and I'll adjust the various ligature widths as I fine-tune the spacing and kerning problems. (lc &quot;s&quot; seems especially troublesome in spacing &amp; kerning&hellip;.) <BR> <BR>I'm especially glad that the lc &quot;g&quot; and UC &quot;Q&quot; and &quot;U&quot; were appreciated. Those glyphs really hold the spirit of the font that I was trying to create. <BR> <BR>Thanks again for all of the great suggestions. Any others will be equally appreciated. <BR> <BR>David</div>
