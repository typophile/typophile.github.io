    of those things -- for <em>whatever</em> reason, people believe it is (or, for
    up-and-coming versions, should be) possible to \"read\" or \"open\" or \"import\"
    a PDF into InDesign and get their original document back.\r\n\r\nCan't do that
    -- it has been compared to reverting your hamburger into a cow.\r\n\r\nYou can
    always try Recosoft's <a href=\"http://www.recosoft.com/products/pdf2id/\">PDF2ID</a>,
    but mind you, this is <strong>not</strong> a 'conversion' back to InDesign, but
    rather an 'interpretation' that may or may not result in something like your original
    ID document.\r\n\r\n[Ed.] And while the above may be true of your <em>InDesign</em>
    document, if you are only interested in the plain text, you can always try a \"Save
    as .RTF\" from within Acrobat Pro."

    your hamburger into a cow.\r\n\r\nit's true that you can't do it if you are using\r\nthe
    current standard tools and file-formats,\r\nwith a .pdf created with those current
    tools.\r\n\r\nbut with \"better\" tools and file-formats,\r\nit's possible to
    \"round-trip\" your .pdfs...\r\n\r\nthat is, the text that you pull out of a .pdf\r\ncan
    -- with just a little minor massaging --\r\nbe used to create the very exact same
    .pdf.\r\n\r\nthe biggest problem with text from a .pdf\r\nis that the paragraphing
    is lost.  but it is\r\nquite simple to write out an \"empty\" line\r\n-- that
    is, a line with a \"dummy\" marker --\r\nbetween paragraphs to retain that structure.\r\nbut
    it's just that most tools do not do that...\r\n\r\nso, no, it's not really equivalent
    to turning\r\nhamburger back into a cow.  or at least it\r\ndoesn't _have_ to
    be that impossible...\r\n\r\n-bowerbird\r\n"
