  body: "In CS for Mac, it works in InDesign, but not Illustrator or Photoshop --
    in those the right-hand negative sidebearing is ignored, so the denominator doesn't
    tuck under.\r\nIt doesn't work in Quark 7, as that app ignores the OT feature
    code for fractions, making fractions on the fly from the numerator, fraction-slash,
    and denominator characters.\r\n\r\nI think it's OK to ignore the present non-functionality
    of my nut-fraction feature in Illustrator and Photoshop, as I don't consider those
    to be situations where people use fractions (although there may be exceptions).
    And for Quark, users still get proper fractions, only they're \"slash\" fractions,
    not \"nut\".\r\n\r\nNonetheless, I may abandon this feature when the typeface
    is released, with the nut fractions (quarters, eigths, thirds and sixteenths)
    only being available as composite characters from the glyph palette.\r\n\r\nAs
    with many OpenType features, I think documentation is extremely important, and
    what may really be needed for a multi-featured OT typeface family is a hard-bound
    user manual, as well as a similar online resource at the foundry.\r\n"

    Illustrator may be another case. Fractions in dimmensions or technical illustrations
    are certainly possible.  I just wish that OpenType features were supported completely
    by at least all publishing applications.\r\n\r\nChrisL"

  body: nick, just curious, why do you prefer nut fractions? and why is the fraction
    bar -359 and the characters 360? was that intentional?

  body: "1. The nut fractions are the traditonal ones used for this style (scotch
    modern) of face.\r\n2. I don't exactly recall, other than it was a bit tricky,
    but I think I must have positioned the bar by eye, dragging the sidebearings,
    so the numerical values just came out that way."
