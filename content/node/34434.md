  for the banner of text brandishing each Scrubs DVD release. I've included an image
  with as many copies of the text as I could find.\r\n\r\nThey are all slightly different
  perspectives due to being taken from 3D DVD cover mock-up press art, but should
  be easy enough to place for you guys.\r\n\r\nIn fact, I am pretty sure I will have
  this font somewhere in my masses, just need to know what it's called. Thanks in
  advance. :)\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/scrubs_seasons_5426.jpg]"

  body: "At first I thought American Typewriter would be the wrong answer, because
    I saw one version with the R having a very upcurved tail, but then I found one
    that showed the same sort of R as the samples. I think that's the right answer.\r\n\r\n-
