		<div class="commentbody"><p>Hey, just finished a thesis on this&hellip;.</p>
<p>There is quite a bit of information floating around on the internet, but what most people that try to approach this subject don&rsquo;t realize is that dyslexia is really just a blanket term for a wide variety of reading / writing disabilities. To really approach the problem, I would recommend narrowing your initial investigation to a limited number of manifestations of dyslexia (ie: letter-reversal, scotopic sensitivity, etc.). &ldquo;Read Regular&rdquo; for example really only addresses the issue of letter-reversal. And while there is little info available for the kinds of things you are looking for (x-height ratio, etc), I have found that the best method is still one-on-one testing with dyslexic individuals (in my case school children). I&rsquo;m sorry that my thesis is not online yet, it should be once I solidify a distributor / publisher.</p>
<p>Hope that helps. Let me know if you have any more questions!</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Hi Leigh,</p>
<p>I took a pragmatic approach when designing the freebie Lexia Readable (<a href="http://www.k-type.com">www.k-type.com</a>) - common wisdom in UK education regarded Comic Sans to be the choice of font by/for people with dyslexia. I decided to base Lexia Readable on the shapes and spacing in Comic Sans, to try to retain its accessibility and friendliness, but to add a more contemporary, adult feel and lose the comic kiddiness so that adolescent and adult dyslexics might not feel patronized. I used the internet to research the preferred x height, the advised non-symmetry of characters, and the use of the simpler, handwritten forms of a and g for instance. However, after talking to and exchanging emails with dyslexic people, professionals and university lecturers I too began to doubt whether a single font could ever be one full and worthy response to the wide variety of conditions covered by the umbrella term dyslexia.</p>
<p>Enjoy the journey!</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Hi Keith,</p>
<p>thanks for the advice. i have also since realised that one typeface is not going to solve all of the problems a person with Dyslexia would face. However, it is still my belief that there is a need for more legible typefaces that are well designed, that we can all use to set type in, but that are also specifically for Dyslexics. It is, unfortunately, a shame that i have been unable to continue with this project, as my tutor at Bucks decided two weeks ago that it was not an appropriate project for the course. A little frustrating as i am a huge type enthusiast and a typographer by trade. Plus i have two or three sketch books of research. But, it is undoubtedly something i wish to continue with after my studies. Maybe i will apply to the design council for funding to research the project further? Who knows, but i have included a lot about Lexia in my research, and it is a very interesting face.</p>
<p>Thank you again,</p>
<p>Leigh Middleton, UnitProDesign.com</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I also fooled around with this for my Thesis project as well. What I found was that making certain characters different from each other in relation to shape (b, d, p, q, I, l, 1 for example) can help those with learning disabilities. Take a look at Spiekermann&rsquo;s ITC Officina and FF Info Display, as well as Clearview Highway, Parisine, Neuzeit, and even Thesis for some examples of this kind of idea. When I made my typeface for my Thesis project I made sure that all of the previously mentioned letterforms all had different shapes.</p>
<p>Also, I would study Cyrillic alphabets as well, I believe they might offer some potential ideas.</p>
