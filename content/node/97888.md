  design. As usual, my list of name alternatives grows faster than a rabbit population,

  but there's this other mind:\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>To which extent is the name of a font
  a catalyst for good sales?</li>\r\n<li>How important are these characteristics in
  your opinion?: (e.g. Is <em>Palatino</em> a name as good as <em>Book Antiqua<em>?)</li>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Semantics.</li>\r\n<li>A

    including Book Antiqua. I don't think Book Antiqua has been marketed per se, so
    much as served as a stand in for an already popular font to get around licensing
    issues (presumably). It's all a moot point since a single company now owns the
    rights to both faces.\r\n\r\nThat said, the name Palatino has not seemed to stand
    in the way of its success. Hard to say how much it contributed."

  body: "I always thought that Palatino was a great name, from the \uFB01rst time
    I came across the typeface in the 1970s.\r\nImmediately, it conveys the patina
    of classical antiquity (if one knows a little about Ancient Rome), and the capital
    P is a distinctive feature of the face, its open counter also referring to the
    style of antiquity.\r\n\r\nThe allusion to Antiquity is appropriate for a design
    which follows the principle of the \uFB01rst humanist types, basing letter forms
    on broad-nibbed scribal styles that are considered to be classical and ancient.\r\n\r\nWhile
    Renaissance styles of type had been revived since the days of Morris, and designers
    such as Goudy had produced new designs in the Renaissance idiom, they had referred
    to the printed tradition. What Zapf did with Palatino was address the process,
    which is what made it so radical and of its own time. The name, in providing a
    type-historical critique of the face\u2019s genesis, may even suggest that the
    design is Post-modern.\r\n\r\nBook Antiqua is a phony name, seeking to deny the
    plagiarism of a clone by asserting that the original is generic.\r\n\r\nSo yes,
    <em>semantics</em>! "

  body: "The name is very important.\r\n\r\nIt has to have the right feeling, it has
    to make a designer want to see what the font looks like, and hopefully confirm
    what the designer thinks it would look like. Choose a name that sounds right (doesn't
    have to be a positive sound or meaning) and that brings attention to what makes
    the font special when set in that font.\r\n\r\nAnd what H\xE9ctor said.\r\n\r\nOne
    of the best-named fonts is Newlyn's \"Luvbug\". Another really good one is Parkinson's
    \"Azuza\" (not least because it's \"misspelled\" so does not get overwhelmed with
    search results against the SoCal city).  I've helped name other people's fonts
    (like Sindre's \"Satyr\"*) and have pages of names ready to go; making as many
    fonts is another matter.  :-/\r\n\r\n* http://typophile.com/node/81129\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "Many current font names are either Anglo- or Germanocentric.\r\n\r\nA font
    name better be reasonably short\u2014at the maximum, three syllables\u2014and
    easy to say. Just think of a string of style names that may follow a family name,
    like \u201Cultrabold extra compressed oblique\u201D. If the typeface is multilingual
    its name should be easy to transliterate to other (non-Latin) scripts, and easy
    to say for the target users. Arno, Bembo, Octava, Pepita are easy; Haettenschweiler,
    Benguiat Gothic, Cheltenham Handtooled, Agedage Cancelleresca, Berthold Englische
    Schreibschrift are not."

  body: "Coming up with a name which has some relation to the design of the typeface
    seems most appropriate but I've never really done that. I guess it's somewhat
    logical as I rarely have a central design philosophy behind my typefaces. Considering
    my last name is Silvertant however I do have some options for personal typefaces
    which refer to my name. I do want to name one typeface after myself.\r\n\r\nGenerally
    though I give my typefaces names which to me resemble the design. I'm aware it's
    very subjective and it might not work for others, but I like how personal the
    name is. Each word invokes a certain feeling or atmosphere so I do try to match
    that to the typeface.\r\n\r\nI do however make sure it's not hard to market. I
    won't use names which are very long or very complex, I never use names consisting
    of more than one word (descriptive names like Sans, Serif, Grotesk etc. not included)
    and if there is a character in my typeface I feel needs to be shown prominently
    I try to include it in the name. I also try to show several letters and TRY to
    avoid a repetition of letters.\r\n\r\nI also want my typefaces to be easy to pronounce,
    but I don't make sure that it will be pronounced in only one way. I tend to use
    Dutch words sometimes and I'm fine if people pronounce it differently than I do
    or don't know the meaning of the word.\r\n\r\nBy the way, I always wondered how
    you're supposed to pronounce Calibri. Does anyone know? C\xE1libri or Cal\xEDbri?
    As a Dutch person I use the first pronunciation as it's similar to the Dutch 'kolibrie'
    (hummingbird). I can imagine most people will use the second pronunciation though.
    As Lucas de Groot is Dutch I wonder if he had intended a certain pronunciation
    or he doesn't quite care either.\r\n\r\nDo you feel like the pronunciation should
    be a specific way or don't you care about the pronunciation of your typefaces?\r\n\r\nAgedage
    Cancelleresca... I feel like this one goes too far in terms of pronunciation,
    either way. 'Agedage' sounds terrible no matter how I pronounce it."

    on the second syllable: Cal\xEDbri."

    course, Book Antiqua was a name considered for Palatino before it received its
    current name. (EDIT: My memory was playing tricks on me. It did have a different
    original name, but that was \"Medici\". In addition to Aldus, actually Aldus Buchschrift,
    there were also two differently-named titling forms of Palatino, [[http://www.identifont.com/find?similar=Michelangelo&q=Go|Michelangelo]]
    and [[http://www.identifont.com/find?similar=sistina&q=Go|Sistina]].)\r\n\r\nAnd,
    for that matter, the typeface that probably ought to be called Palatino Book is,
    of course, instead known as Aldus - and it is not as widely used as it deserves
    to be - and so this typeface provides <em>two</em> studies in the choice of name
    for a typeface."
