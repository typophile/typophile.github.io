  of shops that are spread out round the city - a bit like a shopping centre but not
  all in one place.\r\n\r\nThey have specifically requested some form of logo based
  around the cathedral which is within the city, however, my inspiration has run out
  since the cathedral isnt greatly unique.\r\n\r\nI have designed the logo (which
  should be underneath) - does this look ok? Im not sure if it works well or not.\r\n\r\nAny
  comments or suggestions would be greatly appreciated![img:sites/default/files/old-images/Logo-Design-8_5923.gif]"

    It's far too heavy and modern.\r\n\r\nTry experimenting with key elements of the
    cathedral \u2014 a single tower, spire or buttress \u2014 as opposed to trying
    to fit the entire structure into the mark. Also, don't try to be so trendy with
    the type.\r\n\r\npenn"

  body: I'll comment on the mark - it is quite nice, but I mistook it for a block
    of skyscrapers before I read your note. Perhaps try losing two vertical edges
    that go down from the triangle part ?

  body: "I don't think the Bauhaus-ish font goes with an old English cathedral. My
    instinct would be to try a very British sans like Gill. I realise you aren't actually
    promoting the Cathedral, it is just a visual reference for Durham, but I'm sure
    you could come up with a much stronger image.\r\n\r\nWhat sort of shops are they?"

  body: "I personally dont want to use the cathedral within the logo since i dont
    think it will carry through properly - however, the client is really keen to have
    it in the logo. I have designed others that arent based around the cathedral but
    not sure if he will like them or not.\r\n\r\nI do agree with the comments - i
    think the font is way too modern for the logo (with the cathedral) and i should
    try something a bit more British.\r\n\r\nThe shops are a small collection of little
    boutique shops including a cycle shop, hardware stores, jewellery shops and some
    cafes! They arent a shopping centre as such since they arent housed under the
    same roof!\r\n\r\n"

    linked on the Type I.D. forum.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/durham_4544.PNG]\r\n\r\nI
    think your image captures it alright but, as I said earlier, it needs to be stronger
    unless you perhaps find a typeface that works with your lighter treatment. "

    chose is the exact opposite of \"gothic\". You can almost taste the 800 years

  body: "Guys, thanks so much for the comments thus far - it has been really useful.
    Im not an expert in this area and enjoy designing logos but this client really
    stumped me with following the idea on the cathedral. \r\n\r\nI want to try and
    keep the font type as simple as possible and think that gothic fonts can quite
    often look too detailed which doesnt always replicate well in printed material.
    Ive created this version with gill sans and i think it looks better - comments?
    Does it work better than the first version?\r\n\r\n@tintin81 - love the look of
    the mark you attached. Looks simple and maybe something along the lines of that
    would be much more suitable. I think i was maybe trying to concentrate too much
    on the outside of the cathedral rather than inside - gives a different perspective
    on it. Incidentally what is the font used in the mark? It looks very simple, plain
    but totally 100% effective with the mark!\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Logo-Design-9_4762.gif]"
