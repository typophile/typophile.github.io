    body: "Thanks for your help Miss Tiffany.  I posted the attachment in the ID Type
      board after you responded because I thought that I submitted the attachment
      in the incorrect forum the first time.  I was trying to correct my mistake.
      \ I should have known that a typeface expert would have a keen sense for the
      slightest detail (and would notice that I posted the same thing twice).\r\nI
      am an undergrad student in my senior year.  Hopefully, I will be as talented
      as you are one day.\r\n\r\nThanks again"
