    powerpoint. It&#39;s the quick hack.

    InDesign is okay, but even here you get better control with Distiller.  <BR> <BR>Btw

    Except the CMYK-Check I don&#39;t see anything that truly makes me wanna get this
    thing. '

    down your computer and go have a beer instead. Your brain will thank you later.
    Seriously though, if you are able to use Distiller to turn the EPS or PS files
    from Quark into PDFs, you&#39;ll suffer much less color shift in your final files.'

    than each one separately. In the future I will guess you can&#39;t buy individual

  body: CD is in many ways problematic. It includes an Activation like Microsoft has
    with XP, which I absolutely do hate. Adobe was one of the easier companies in
    terms of pre-criminalizing the users, seems those days are gone. Then they only
    offer an upgrade either for the single progs or from Photoshop to the Suite. Not,
    however, from the Design Collection to the Suite... and thus I have to pay more
    than 1000 Euro, no matter which way I go. I

    on Photoshop CS from NAPP and its founder hates the CS name. I am more critical,
    as I said its a corporate way to make us spend money we don&#39;t have on programs
    we don&#39;t use. How sad. But at least InDesign will bury Quark once and for
    all. Dann

    dump her like that...  Stupid Adobe. <BR> <BR>Stupid Adobe too for the product
    activation.  All it takes is some bored 15 year old a week and product activation
    isn&#39;t a problem.  It&#39;s going to be circumvented anyway, why spend the
    money to make it?  It&#39;s like they WANT to alienate their customers.

    pictures of their pieces. <BR> <BR>Light is one of the worst enemies of paintings.
    That&#39;s why these places have such low illuminance levels. And that&#39;s why
    they usually don&#39;t open every day of the week &#40;the cumulative effect of
    lighting in a year is pretty important&#41;. <BR> <BR>I hope you won&#39;t do
    it again! ;-&#41;
