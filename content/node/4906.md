body: Hello, everyone. <BR> <BR>Does anyone know about FontLab5 information? <BR>And
  I want to know when FL5 will launch? <BR>I&#39;m using FOG4 &amp; Illustrator8 now.  <BR>I
  heard that FontLab announced FL5 in Typo Berlin2004. <BR>I&#39;m curious about it
  is possible to run FL5 in MacOS9 or not. <BR>If FL5 is not available in OS9 ,I would
  like to purchase FL4.6. <BR>

  body: 'At Typo Berlin 2004, an early preview version of FontLab Studio 5 was announced.
    The software will most likely be released in Autumn this year, first for Windows
    and subsequently, for MacOS X. We have not decided yet whether the software will
    be available on MacOS 9.  <BR> <BR>Regards,  <BR>Adam Twardoch <BR>Fontlab Ltd. '

    soon as possible rather than working to make it OS 9 compatible.

  body: Thanks Adam. <BR> <BR>Studio 5? Does FL upgrade considerably? <BR>I&#39;m
    looking forward to see FL Studio5. <BR> <BR>Stephen. <BR>&#62;Hot dog! I hope
    FL will spend their time getting the Mac version  <BR>&#62;out as soon as possible
    rather than working to make it OS 9 compatible. <BR> <BR>I hope so too. But as
    for my Mac being too old, OSX does not run satisfactorily. Therefore, If FL5 is
    not available in OS9 ,I would like to purchase FL4.6.  <BR>Some day,I bought new
    Mac, I will be going to upgrade FLStudio5 immediately. <BR>

  body: Kunihiko - <BR> <BR>I have mixed feelings about FL under OS 9. <BR>I used
    4.5 and 4.6 under OS9 up until this past December. <BR>A new machine was a small
    fortune but FL was crashing around <BR>10 times a day so I finnaly switched. Also,
    some features like <BR>Anchors will not work with the OS9 version.  <BR>The metrics
    window seems to be smoother under X too.

  body: Adam, nice little presentation. Do you know how much the upgrade will be?
    Does it depend how recently somebody bought 4.6? <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>

  body: I thought it was version 2.5 I started with, although perhaps there was a
    2.0 release. I remember it was advertised in one of the design mags, probably
    <i>How</i>, and there was a special deal to get it cheap. I didn&#39;t have enough
    money to buy Fontographer at the time, so I opted for this new FontLab thing.
    We&#39;ve grown up together.

  body: Adam, as far as I can tell in the new metrics window the numeric data still
    resides above the glyph showings. Will the user have the ability to flip flop
    these two windows so the numeric data can sit below the glyph showings? <BR> <BR>Stuart

  body: Adam, thanks again your additional info. <BR>This information is very helpful.  <BR>Especially,
    metrics and kerning method seems good. <BR> <BR>Eric , thanks your advice. <BR>
    <BR>&#62;A new machine was a small fortune but FL was crashing around  <BR>&#62;10
    times a day so I finnaly switched. Also, some features like  <BR>&#62;Anchors
    will not work with the OS9 version.  <BR>&#62;The metrics window seems to be smoother
    under X too. <BR> <BR>I see. <BR>I was using the demo version. Since I had not
    mastered yet, I have not noticed the problem. <BR>It seems to be better to use
    FL under OSX rather than OS9. <BR>Anyway, my having to do is saving money for
    new machine. <BR> <BR>Kunihiko
