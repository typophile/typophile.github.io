  I've tended to prune my app's font lists down quite a bit over the years so likely
  don't run into the performance issues some do. \r\n\r\nShe's recently installed
  a LOT of fonts (few hundred from the looks of it) and now her system is beach balling
  a lot. They were put into Adobe's own font folders (not OSX's system folder).\r\n\r\nMy
  initial hunch is that that's just too many fonts to be loading into memory and that's
  what's slowing OSX down.\r\n\r\nBut the other odd thing is that inside her apps
  (such as Illustrator) a lot of the fonts show up with &lt;brackets&gt; around the
  font name, so it might look like this:\r\n\r\nfont name\r\nfont name\r\n&lt;font
  name&gt;\r\n\r\nAnyone know what those brackets around a font name indicate? I assume
  maybe it's a damaged or missing font? "

    documents, but is missing (not installed).

  body: "Are these old Postscript fonts? My experience with bracketed names is that
    it indicates a style referenced in the suitcase, but for which there is no PS
    font found.\r\n\r\nIn InDesign, you can get a style name in square brackets when
    you change font families and the style designation from the previous family does
    not have an equivalent in the new family. So, for instance, Minion-[RomanOsF].\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Mark...that could be, though it appears that these show up even in a new
    blank AI document. No characters appear, so it is likely a missing font (or many
    damaged)?\r\n\r\nGood info kentlew...thanks. These very well could be older PS
    fonts. \r\n\r\nIn terms of performance, is the likely issue just too many fonts?
    Or could it be that there's just some bad fonts? "

    how fast certain apps start up, but I don't think it will cause an overall slowdown.\r\n\r\nYou
    may want to run Font Book or a third party font manager and see if any issues
    are found."
