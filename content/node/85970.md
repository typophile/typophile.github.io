    been 'borrowed from' from my blog here (and elsewhere). It seems biters are everywhere
    all the time ...sigh.\r\n\r\n\"Imitation is the highest form of flattery\", ...really?
    I think imitation is the lowest form of poverty.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n"

  body: "I wasn't really accusing the author of plagiarism, at least in this case
    (I don't think the idea is very original. I'm pretty sure someone used it before).*
    Just pointing out the similarity.\r\nThat doesn't mean, of course, that there
    aren't many lazy people out there that will copy anything they see.\r\n\r\n* Here's
    an interesting piece related to this issue:\r\nhttp://observatory.designobserver.com/feature/designing-under-the-influence/2727/"

  body: "I think this single subject matter is the one and only I feel worthwhile.\r\n\r\nThat
    being - the Individual.\r\n\r\nWhen you have beaten down people in teaching positions
    schooling the anxious wannabes - mediocrity has won the day. There is no way in
    hell that at that young one's time of critical development their own sense of
    inner strength can be attained when being taught to comprise.\r\n\r\nAnd what
    falls along the wayside is the respect for other people's Individual creative
    acts.\r\n\r\nI was taught not to do what has already been done. If you look to
    a Master - seek what they sought, not do as they have done. Not because it is
    the intellectual property of someone else - but more importantly - because each
    of us has a unique contribution to give within our creative disciplines. It is
    there to be found and developed. \r\n\r\nSeriously, I don't want to talk like
    what's her name.\r\n\r\nAgain, it's not about intellectual property - it's about
    being an Individual. It is the Individual who contributes something worthwhile.
    Not the imitator, the plagiarist, and certainly not the one who is paying homage.
    And when the Individual has been strengthened through proper schooling - there
    is no such thing as a \"diminishing frontier\" (cited from your linkage), because
    there simply is no such thing as a 'frontier' to begin with. \r\n\r\nThere are
    no boundaries on creativity. Only the beaten generation talk in such terms as
    \"diminishing boundaries\". And on the note of 'style', this too comes from being
    aware, and having developed, your own language as an Individual. Which btw is
    part of an ever-on-going linage - graphic, or otherwise - because nobody stands
    alone and everyone \"is part of the maine\".\r\n\r\nSo when someone condones,
    \"imitation, influence, plagiarism, homage and coincidence...\", they truly lessen
    us all by undermining the Individual. \r\n\r\n\r\n[/rant]\r\n\r\n\r\n"
