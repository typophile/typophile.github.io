  on the up-and-up?  One of my pictures showed up there (with a nice link back to
  my blog) but other than that, it's a mystery to me. \r\n\r\n (Not that I consider

  body: "\"Nacho\" is a contraction, both for the name Ignacio, and also sometimes
    used in software/signal piracy for things that are \"not yours\" (e.g., a \"nacho
    chip\" in your cable tuner would give you access to channels that are \"nachos\",
    i.e., not yours). This site is about sharing images found on the web, so, as a
    user of the site you would be submitting photos that are not yours, hence the
    name \"nachophoto\". \r\n\r\nI've never heard of it before, but I figure that's
    how they came up with the name. Since it does at least link back to the sources
    of the images, it may be no more infringing than Google Image Search.\r\n\r\nOf
    course, since you found a photo there that is yours, this explanation might not
    make as much sense."

    for my removal request, but the thought of having to go through and search on
    every blog topic -- how the photo was listed -- isn't high on my priority list....)"

    come from -- beware!
