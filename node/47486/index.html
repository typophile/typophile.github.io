		<div class="commentbody"><p>Eben, perhaps what Sii hints at is that its best to define your brief <strong>before</strong> you pick software configurations. Since you won&rsquo;t &ldquo;officially&rdquo; (hehe…) define your brief at Reading until November/December, there is no need to lock yourself into to anything now. It isn&rsquo;t a good idea to try to &ldquo;start early&rdquo; on your project anyway, as things may change once you hit the ground in the department and see all of the resources available.</p>
<p>Besides, who knows what technological changes might come to the field between now and whenever you need to implement what you need to implement?</p>
<p>I licensed Vista and Office while I was writing my first essay over the Christmas break. I would have waited longer, but there was no other way to typeset Indic fonts properly on my Mac (which was the topic of my essay!). I didn&rsquo;t use my PC partition again until June/July, when it was time to produce the font in VOLT.</p>
<p>But if I had done an Arabic font instead of a Devanagari one, I might have:</p>
<ol>
<li>licensed a copy of InDesign ME instead of InDesign</li>
<li>started in VOLT earlier, since I could have properly tested my font then on my Mac side in InDesign ME along the way (instead of on Windows in Word 2007). This wasn&rsquo;t an option for me, since there is no &ldquo;InDesign South Asia&rdquo; or what have you.</li>
</ol>
<p>Paul also did a Devanagari, and he has XP. The version of VOLT that you need in order to write for the latest Indic shaping engine works on XP, too. I guess you&rsquo;d just have to test on Vista as well as in Office 2007 on XP… you could ask him right now at the conference.</p>
<p>As a Mac User who has always worked on secondary PC as well, I must add that I don&rsquo;t understand this &ldquo;oh no, let&rsquo;s stay with XP&rdquo; business from Windows users at all. Vista is a better OS, at least every way that I look at it. Which—I must say—is from a <em>type</em> POV. That is the future, and I don&rsquo;t want to go back to previous OS problems.</p>

<p>While I was in class at Typecon, Adam showed me his setup which was a VM ware with a wide variety of flavors of Win and maybe other OSs. Most impressive. So what I have now is the VMware plus XP. If I need to (per the brief as you correctly point ) I will add additional software to this. Sadly I will only be able to get up to 3GB memory with my vintage 17'' not the 4 he recommended but that will still be better than 2.</p>
<p>Si, Dan,  I haven&rsquo;t decided what latin to take on. It might simply be Cyrillic for all I know. It is great to see how the parts all relate better. Thanks very much!</p>
<p>Manlio, I am sorry. My sympathies!</p>
