body: Anyone have any good recommendations for a PHP/MySQL-based shopping cart/inventory
  tracking system?  I&#39;m going to be selling both fonts digitally &#40;infinite
  inventory&#41; and selling hard goods, so the system should be able to handle both
  those... <BR> <BR>Also, I&#39;m looking for something open-source that I don&#39;t
  have to pay a buttload of money for. <BR> <BR>Thoughts?
