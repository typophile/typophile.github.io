body: "Hi all...\r\n\r\nI'm beta testing a font using InDESIGN. After doing some kerning
  and generating the OpenType font, when I look at it in InDesign test, there's no
  change in the kerning I just performed. If I generate a PostScript version of the
  font, then open THAT in FontLab and re-generate the OpenType font, it seems to work
  (the kerning appears as I have edited it).\r\n\r\nIs there a reason Fontographer's
  opentype generated font doesn't access the kerning?\r\n\r\nI use LinoType Explorer
  to load fonts. Could it be reading an older version of the font? \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIs
  there something I'm doing wrong? \r\n\r\nThanks,\r\n\r\nRob"

    Just stick them in the Adobe fonts folder."

  body: Did you clean caches? Under tools menu you can clean the manage folder which
    gets rid of the cache in Explorer; and also clean application caches which will
    clean out any Adobe cache of it.

  body: "Stephen, \r\n\r\nThanks for the quick response...\r\n\r\nIf I generate the
    font in FontLab and open it in LinoType Explorer, the kerning shows up. Also,
    to clean the cache, it says I will need to restart. Not sure I want to do that
    each time I make a change in the kerning.\r\n\r\nRob"

    typeface a different name (eg apply a version number). This has been suggested
    before by designers somewhere on this site (meaning it\u2019s not my wonderful
    personal insight\u2026)"

  body: I have an older version of Linotype explorer, but mine just asks for a password
    before cleaning the application caches. Restarting will clean Adobe caches, but
    I think the point of doing it with Explorer is so you don't have to restart. Mine
    has always updated properly just through Explorer. First I delete the font from
    the list in Explorer then clean both caches and then load the updated version.

  body: "You can put the font files directly into /Applications/Adobe InDesign CS5/Fonts
    (replace CS5 with your actual version number). Font files placed there are instantly
    picked up by InDesign. InDesign does not \"lock\" them so you can overwrite them
    directly from Fontographer or FontLab Studio, switch to InDesign and you should
    instantly see the changes. \r\n\r\nDo you have an external features definition
    file associated with your .fog document? "

    really know what an external definition file is.\r\nStephen, you suggested renaming
    the font. Does renaming a font automatically change the PostScript and Bitmap
    ID numbers for the font?\r\n\r\nNaming fonts has been an issue for me since the
    latest Fontographer version was released. I have had to go into Fontographer 4
    to look at the ID numbers of fonts to make sure I don't get any conflicts.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHIS
    BRINGS ME TO ANOTHER QUESTION... I'll create a new thread for it.\r\n\r\nThanks
    guys!\r\n\r\nRob"
