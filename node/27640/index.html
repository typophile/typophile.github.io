The content referred to "displaced persons", not media skew.

But perhaps even mentioning this could be considered skew, i.e. how the issue is "cut". That onvolves timing, also. So it's interesting that German-Polish WW2 issues are emerging, in the light of the two Polish-born stars on Germany's World Cup team, and Gross' revelation about being in the SS, as well as this. Could be that there's a consensus that the issue is cool enough to handle, and negotiate reparations?

Reparations seem to be recognized more widely as a realistic prospect with political appeal, -- Hezbollah, for instance, yesterday promising financial support for those recently bombed out of their homes in Lebanon.

But I dunno, while reparation is one way to atone for past grievances, it would be terrible if it was institutionalized as an acceptable cost of "solving" political problems with bombs.</div>

I don't think so… looks rather tight to me. I can't tell everything from the photos… but if they keep the tight-but-not-touching treatment to the headline areas only the design might be OK overall.

The BBC article is interesting. The German media coverage of the exhibition that I have seen has focused on how little the exhibition focused on Germans who were dispersed from Poland. It was supposed to be an exhibition on refugees in gerneral.

I saw interviews with several political and cultural figures from Poland who had visited the exhibition and who seemed quite relieved about the actual focus. They thought that it was a perfectly good exhibition. But I also remember a counter point made by a woman from Prague, though. She thought that the exhibition didn't focus enough on "why" the Germans were forced out of Eastern Europe, referring to the level of enthusiasm for Hitler in the Sudetenland before 1938, etc. 

Of course, I saw these interviews on German state TV, so there is certainly the possibility of bias in the opposite direction of any BBC bias…</div>

BTW, Hzballa has always had that policy in place.* That's why they're so popular, and attacking them only increases grassroots support. They even applied that policy to the Christians who collaborated with Israel during the civil war; these were the people who carried out the Sabra-Shateela massacres (with Israeli help) no less. And when was the Jewish golden age? In Spain, under the Muslims. This is not a war of religions, it's a war of global financial domination versus human decency. Faith is simply leveraged to motivate the peon masses.

* Which makes me wonder if that's why Israel destroyed so much: maybe they're trying to bankrupt Hzballa! Collateral human damage? Those in power don't care a cluster bomb cluster about that. However, soon enough the world will rebuild Lebanon again... while Israel remains mired.

As for Israel destroying much in Lebanon: you're obviously watching/reading too much al-BBC. This was the impression they intended to create, by reusing images, some of which were doctored. The New York Times was also surprised to realize that the same man shown dead in the rubble one day, was seen a few days later in another photo mourning the destruction. If Israel wanted it could raze Beirut. Fact is it was selective. 

Make no mistake, Israel's actions are not all justified; but no other government in the world would respond more discriminately if attacked -- and you know it. 

Hrant, you can keep ignoring thbe religious dimension. By reading BBC you wouldn't even know the latese arrests shared a "faith" (in what? not in Marx or in humanity). But if this IS about money, then if Israel+Britain+Canada+US = capitalism; and Hezbollah+Syria+Iran=socialism, then I'm giving up my Canadian  NDP membership and going capitalist.</div>

This is a very complex story. During some periods, the Muslim rulers were more tolerant and enlightened than those in Europe. This led to a flowering of culture, both Muslim and Jewish. In other periods, fanatical Muslim rulers forced conversion of both Jews and Christians under threat of death. 

The whole story, which I haven't studied, had a big impact on the history of both the Muslim and Christian worlds. The Muslim scholars of the tolerant periods revived Greek learning, which when transferred to the West contributed to the Renaissance. The fanatics I believe helped cause the decline of the Morrocan kingdoms and their eventual military defeat on the European continent by Christians in the areas of Spain and Portugal.  </div>

As an aside: the complete term 'Spanish Inquisition' should be used in this context, since as an institution and in its operating method it was unique and not related to the Roman Inquisition which had jurisdiction only over baptised Catholics and operated under episcopal oversight. The Spanish Inquisition was a secular creation established by Ferdinand and Isabella and remained under the direct control of the Spanish monarchy. As such, it was used to give bogus legal justification to the theft of Jewish property by the state and by the monarchs' favoured supporters. ]</div>

Are you saying that the design is refined and polished, whereas the content is raw?
The typography is appropriate to the distancing provided by the objectivity of the institution mounting the exhibit, in which case the typography represents the cool analytical institution, juxtaposed against the issue which is still emotional. So it's appropriate, whereas rough grunge typography, more representative of pain, anger and war, would be inflammatory.</div>

Yes, authorised by Sixtus IV, but managed by the crown. Ferdinand & Isabella wrote to the Pope requesting permission to establish the Spanish Inquisition and for it to operate in a unique way that differed significantly from the inquisition that developed during the Middle Ages. The latter was remarkably strictly regulated from an early period precisely because the scholastic Churchmen understood the potential for abuse and had no illusions about the temptations of secular power. The use of an institution intended to uncover theological heresy as a tool of state repression emerges in the early modern period with the strengthening of the aparatus of secular authority. In Spain, this coincided with the defeat and expulsion of the Moors and the subsequent efforts to consolidate a Christian national identity, of which the Spanish Jews were victims.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Interesting though, that when my ancestors (Central/Eastern European) were clearing feces and rubbish from town streets, bathing infrequently, and possessed of as much learning as the animals they milked, the Muslims of the time were by far our social and cultural superiors.

Macksood Aftab writes that:

Cities like Baghdad, Damascus, Cairo and Cordoba were the centers of civilization. These cities were flourishing and Muslim scientists made tremendous progress in applied as well as theoretical Science and Technology. In Europe, however, the situation was much different. Europe was in the Dark Ages. It had no infrastructure or central government. To the Muslims, Europe was backward, unorganized, carried no strategic importance and was essentially irrelevant. This considering the time period was in fact true. Nevertheless the Catholic Church (which at the time was the strongest institution in Europe) successfully convinced Christian Europe that the Muslims were infidels. This caused Europeans to think that Muslims were culturally inferior to Europe and thus Europe was unable to benefit from the new scientific discoveries being made in the Islamic lands before the 1100's. By doing this Europe kept itself in the Dark Ages while from China to Spain Islamic Civilization prospered. During the Crusades there was limited contact between Muslims and Christians and not much was transferred. As A. Lewis explains, "The Crusaders were men of action, not men of learning."

Which appears to be just as true today. Maybe America's "left-wing" scholars (labels, labels) will one day feel comfortable asking the rest of us in the west to look in the mirror and consider the possibility that our own prejudices - and thus, our propensity to *allow* western governments a free hand in wrong-headed foreign adventurism - have caused the kind of "terrorism" (response?) we see today. Instead, individuals who are able to think freely and ask the hard questions are either censured or simply ignored. 

The tragedy of our century (this one and the last) is that the beast rages because it cannot (or will not) see its own face in the mirror.   </div>

Did I suggest that the inquisition was justified because 'things were that way everywhere on those days'? That isn't the sort of argument I employ. 

I think there are entirely legitimate moral and theological criticisms to be made of the Roman inquistion and, more specifically, of some of the methods employed by the inquisition. But at the same time I think it is very necessary to talk accurately about what the inquisition was, how it was organised, how it operated, what its aims were, etc. So this is why I think it is important that the distinction between the Roman inquisition and the Spanish inquisition be recognised, because the latter was distinct in several respects with regard to both its organisation, its mandate and its methods.</div>

That's taxation. It's just not funded by the general public purse or by income taxes (rather, it's more regressive than an income tax).

Typequake, I gave you the reference so you could see for yourself. As you can see from my discussion--which I don't want to repeat--I think Hrant's political views are extremely misguided. 

I agree with you--and the Biblical story--that jealousy and zeal (it is interesting that the Hebrew terms are the same word) can lead to hatred and then to violence.  </div>

BTW, something more on-topic: it's interesting how Hzballa is
redefining what a guerilla movement can be, for example in
terms of visual language / graphic design. Look at the middle
of the tape in this photo:
http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/shared/spl/hi/pop_ups/06/in_pictures_in_the_rubble_of_southern_beirut_____/html/12.stm

Their (perceived, and admittedly partial) victory has a logo!
Frame 9 is also interesting, especially how the prominent typo
has somehow not pervented them from getting the other attri-
butes (like the distinctive placement of the lines) right.

Here's the first piece of news for you: it is possible to criticize Israel's operations and still acknowledge the role of fundamental Islam in promoting terrorism and barbarism against infidels, democracy, and women. If the Hezbollah kidnapped the two soldiers from Israeli territory as an anti-global protest, it sure kept its motives secret.

		<div class="commentbody">Speaking of "radicalism" - much of which is caused not by the radicals themselves, but by other right-wing governments interested in resources and markets in which they are not welcome (except at the behest of the well-fed upper classes of said markets), but I digress . . . 

Mention "terrorist" or "Islamic fundamentalist" in a room full of your average business crowd, and you'll get nods of approval followed by head-shaking and epithets of "animals" and "bastards." 

Mention "Zionism" in the same room (Israel's own version of American neo-conservatism - yes, they *do* exist) and you'll get your head bitten off.

On the one hand you have the Islamic terrorist, and on the other you've got the Zionist conservative element in Israel (and America.) To be fair, neither is really any better than the other, and both most certainly deserve each other. But one side, at least, needs to begin to make concessions. Any takers?   

Here's a little brain-teaser I like to throw out there sometimes: "The American Invasion of South Vietnam." It's there. You just have to look for it. But no one said it'll be pleasant.

Christian, you are misinformed. Zionism in general does not refer to any particular political ideology. As the Wikipedia puts it, I think accurately: "Since the founding of the State of Israel, the term Zionism is generally considered to mean support for Israel as a Jewish nation state."

You are entitled to your opinion, but I strongly disasgree that of those who want Israel as a nation state and the terrorists who want to destroy it are "neither better than other." Israel was founded by the Western powers through the vote of the UN as a place of refuge for the Jews after WW II. This conferred some legitimacy on it at the start. The local populace didn't vote, but after repeated wars to exterminate Israel, which they lost, and expulsion of Jews from Arab countries, at some point Israel is legitimate any way you look at it, in my opinion. And by the way it is the ancestral home of the Jews, and Hebrew is the ancient local language of the area--not Arabic, which comes from the outside Arab imperial conquerers. 

In my view Israel made a big mistake in building settlements scattered around the West Bank and Gaza. But this does not change the most fundamental aspect of the situation. Both Hamas and Hezbollah have the declared aim of exterminating the Jewish state. And they celebrate terror attacks to do it. Recently, Israel pulled completely out of Gaza and earlier out of Lebanon. And the government announced its intention to pull out of most of the West Bank. The response has been completely unprovoked indiscriminate attacks on civilians as well as soldiers by Hamas and Hezbollah. 

There has been great suffering on all sides in the middle east, and wrongs have been committed by both sides. But as one Israeli leader put it, "There is a difference between the arsonist and the firefighter." They are not morally equivalent. Israel has demonstrated with both Egypt and Jordan that as soon as its neighbors  are willing to live in peace, Israel makes peace, and keeps it.

Palatine, The equation is not zionism and terrorists, it is Israel and its Arab neighbours. Israelis dream to peacefully coexist with Arabs within and without. The majority of Israelis currently believe the solution lies in territorial compromises, and like  William pointed out, clearing the settlements (this process has begun). Other Israelis question the wisdom of this, given that past concessions did not put an end to terrorism. They are, in my opinion, in the wrong, but at least Israel is an open society were these ideas are debated.

The Arab neighbours are not all ready for peace. Egypt and Jordan are on board, but Assad of Syria in a speech this week called for the destruction of Israel. The Iranian position is well known and the two countries have been funding Hezbollah.

I am sorry if you view terrorists as the moral equivalent. They have been engaged in murder and violence against Israelis and Peace-seeking Arabs -- soldiers and civilians.

		<div class="commentbody"><em>Mention “Zionism” in the same room (Israel’s own version of American neo-conservatism - yes, they *do* exist) and you’ll get your head bitten off.</em>

I'm going to take issue with this because I think it is important to understand how the conservative element in Israel came to the forefront, and how this differs from much of the social and political impetus of the Zionist project beginning in the 19th century. Whatever criticism one wants to make about Zionism, it cannot be equated with American neo-conservatism. For most of its history, the social and political aspect of Zionism was a predominantly left wing, both before the creation of the state of Israel and in the history of that state up until 1973. The anarcho-collectivist kibbutz movement was for very many years the cliché of Zionist organisation. Israeli politics was dominated by the Labour party from 1948 until 1973. It is also worth noting that while the USA gave aid money to Israel during those years, the amount of money and trade benefits it gave to Israel was not significantly different from what it gave to many other countries.

In the late 1960s and early 1970s, the Soviet Union actively courted governments in Syria, Egypt and other Arab states, selling them weaponry at low cost and offering them beneficial trade arrangements and aid money. The USA, fearing a Soviet sphere of influence covering much of the Middle East, determined that it needed to have a stronger presence in the region. After the 1967 war, it became clear to the Americans that Israel was their best bet as an anti-Soviet ally in the Middle East. The 1973 Yom Kippur war was a proxy fight of the Cold War, betwen Soviet sponsored Arabs states and US backed Israelis. As a result of the war, the Israeli economy was badly damaged and needed support from the US. The ascendancy of the conservative, right wing element in Israeli politics stems from this time, as does America's huge investment in Israel as a major ally. This investment is roughly the same in real terms, by the way, as the aid and trade benefits the US gives to South Korea, which demonstrates that US support for Israel is a strategic one and not a result of the American Jewish lobby group.</div>

CNN for example does not defend South Korea and does not attack North Korea with nearly the same totality and draconian detail as it does Israel and the Arabs*. Furthermore, if lobbying had no effect, the US wouldn't be <cite>run on it</cite>. Lastly, the Soviet Union is gone, and Russia's military threat is now not leveraged against Israel, but it's been getting much worse for Arabs, not better. Don't distract by placing original blame on the USSR. If you want to put most of the blame for the misery in the Middle East on a single country, put it on the UK, which, having had to give up first-hand imperialism, now acts as a henchman.

Yes, but markedly the Americans opposed Britain and France over Suez, refused to support or sanction it, and condemned the whole escapade, including Israel's part in it. The US voted in favour of the UN resolution calling for immediate withdrawal of Israeli, British and French troops from Egypt.

Again focusing on the Cold War origins of US foreign policy in the Middle East: during the Suez crisis, the USSR threatened to send troops to support the Egyptians. After the crisis, Eisenhower asked the US Congress to authorise the use of American military force <em>if requested</em> by any Middle Eastern nation (as well as a large sum of money for aid to countries in the region, to counter Soviet influence). The first application of this new US policy was in 1958, when Lebanon requested US forces to help quell a rebellion sponsored by Syria and Egypt.

The latter situation is a good example of Lebanon's persistent problem: as the smallest, militarily weakest and most internally diverse nation in the region it is prey to other countries exerting pressure on it (especially Syria, and now Iran), and has been for a very long time. Its situation is very similar to that of the Balkan states: fractured along religious lines, strategically important because of its coastline, and the regular battleground of proxy fights between larger countries that consistently undermine the fragile situation within the country. Syria, Egypt, Israel and now Iran have all been guilty of this.</div>

Which is why I wrote that Israel's collusion has been with the West, not the US (the former, like any complex entity, never being totally unified). And one could say the Suez incident was significant in another way: it most probably helped convince Israel to move its lobbying to the other side of the Atlantic.

> as well as a large sum of money for aid to countries in the region

That can't be overstated. If they really wanted peace, the US
and Israel could simply <cite>buy</cite> Hzballa's support from right under it.

> <cite>if requested</cite> by any Middle Eastern nation

How passé...  :-/

BTW, Syria's presence in Lebanon was also by invitation. They did however overstay it. Even though, and this never gets mentioned in the superpower's media, it is Syria that deserves credit for stopping the 17-year civil war, in spite of all the external sabotaging*. As to your characterization of Lebanon, there's some truth to it, but it's also inaccurate in important ways. In spite of everything (or maybe <cite>due</cite> to everything) there is a great sense of unity in the country**. And when you claim that Syria exerts the most pressure on Lebanon, I would point out that it was not Syria that caused billions of dollars of damage in one month, in the process killing both a greater number <cite>and a greater proportion</cite> of civilians than Hzballa could ever dream of. Somebody said terrorism?

* For example, the car bomb was invented by Israel, being first delpoyed in the early years of the civil war. And subsequently being responsible for about 1/3-rd of the ~250 car bombs that went off over the years. That (and other things) can make you wonder about the Hariri assassination...

** Compare Lebanon to Jordan, where more than 60% of the
population thinks its peace treaty with Israel is an outrage. You
guys want democracy? Now we know why: setting up more wars.

Plus you might be surprised how ambivalent most Lebanese (I mean beyond the Shee'a) were about him... until he got killed. As we say in Armenian: "Kna merir, yegour sirem" - "Go die, come let me love you". Everybody leveraged his killing, and distorted his past life, to further their own ends. You should have seen the abrupt "policy shift" that some leaders went through - puts Tschichold to shame.

Saudi Arabia? That was the hotel where the delegates stayed. It's telling that you've been made to believe Saudi Arabia deserves any credit (beyond sending big-spending tourists to Lebanon lately). It was the patience, persistence and cleverness (and yes, to some extent dastardliness) of Syria that allowed it to see the war through, and impose a Pax Romana. Not the ideal outcome, but better than anything anybody else had managed. Hariri wouldn't have spent his and Lebanon's billions to rebuild everything without it.

Or, let's put that way:
 Husayn al-Husayni from Ba`albak, the key architects of the Taif Agreement (and one  of the founders of the Amal Movement;  forced to leave it by Hafez al-Asad since he didn't want to cooperate with the PLO.)

As al-Husayni said  ( the real life vs. the original Taif): "What is being implemented is neither the Taif agreement nor the constitution".


Moreover, Albert Mansur (defense minister in the first cabinet formed after Taif)  wrote a  book about this issue, and like al-Husayni, I don't think that he saw Syria as clever.... or that Syria is willing to see Lebanon as an Independent country.

David Fromkin:
A Peace to End All Peace. The Fall of the Ottoman Empire 
and the Creation of the Modern Middle East

		<div class="commentbody"><em>If you want to put most of the blame for the misery in the Middle East on a single country, put it on the UK</em>

Ironically, that is exactly the impression that it was German policy to propagate following vol Moltke's return to Germany from service to the Ottoman sultanate. As the Kaiser said, 'Our consuls and agents must inflame the entire Muslim world against this hateful, lying, and unscrupulous nation [England]'. So even if one does seek to put the blame for the situation in the Middle East on one country -- and the UK certainly deserves a lot of blame -- , one ends up involving other countries in that process. And of course the German involvement continued after the collapse of both the Ottoman empire and the German crown. Lebanese Christian crypto-fascists and the Moslem Mufti of Jerusalem were both welcomed to Berlin by Hitler and given financial support. Egyptian 'green shirts' of the Young Egypt party modelled themselves on the German Nazi party and provided intelligence to the Germans during WWII. Sami al-Jundi, one of the founders of the Baathist movement in Syria and Iraq, had <em>Mein Kampf</em> translated into Arabic, and along with Saddam Hussein's uncle, Khairallah Tulfah, was open about describing themselves as 'racists, admiring Nazism, reading its books and the source of its thoughts'. With funding from Adolf Eichmann, the Mufti organised pogroms against the Jews in Palestine in the 1930s and '40s. After the German defeat in 1945, Nazi war criminals resurfaced in the Middle East, where they were protected and employed in training security, police and armed forces in Arab states.

So trying to pin the blame for the misery in the Middle East on any one country is both simplistic and fails to stand up to historical scrutiny.</div>

My point was that the specifics of the political situation in the Middle East are in many ways a product of the Cold War, as <em>both</em> the US and USSR vied for influence in the region, armed opposing proxy armies, and dumped a large amount of 'aid' money, much of which went into the pockets of corrupt Arab officials. The latter is worth drawing attention to because the corruption of Arab leaders has directly contributed to the rise of militant Islamist movements within those countries, whose governments need to direct anger and resentment outwards -- at Israel and at the USA -- if they are to survive themselves.

So I have to wonder, who's using Hzballa as a tool, Iran or Israel? When this battle broke out, Israel claimed that Iran had timed things to avoid being talked about at the G8 summit. Well, if Israel really wanted the G8 to talk about Iran all they had to do is wait a couple of days before massively escalating the incident... And nobody should be shocked if it turns out that those two soldiers and their hapless fellows were paraded back-and-forth at the border until they were attacked. This is exactly the sort of thing that goes around in the Middle East and especially Lebanon* with Israel being the most skilled and well-endowed performer. Of course North Americans have been conveniently conditioned to exhibit a knee-jerk sarcastic denialism to these sorts of claims: "Yeah, it's all a conspiracy, a bunch of rich people are meeting in caves to plan our doom, riiight." Livestock staring at their food instead of the abattoir hardware.

		<div class="commentbody">First of all, it's inherent in politics that formal statements are made for popular consumption. When Bush makes his grandiose statements, do <cite>you</cite> believe him? No you don't. Humans are not black-and-white, they just act that way sometimes to get a better deal. The absolutist huffing-and-puffing from both sides during the formulation of resolution 1701 was simply negotiation.

Politicians get popular support by appearing strong, and they don't get radical support if the people are not unhappy about the status quo. Nobody would give a crap about Nasralla if Arabs as a whole didn't feel that the West and Israel are trying -and largely succeeding- in subjugating them. Slogans by definition have to be more polarizing than anybody really thinks is possible, or sometimes even desirable. Ergo: if Israel concedes enough, Arab warmongering would melt away. You would be left with a somewhat smaller country, but without katyoushas and worldwide vengeful hate directed at you. And you'd still have the region's most powerful military (and 200+ nuclear bombs) to protect <cite>legitimate and just</cite> borders. But Israel isn't really prepared to concede anything; the withdrawal from Lebanon in 2000 was done to escape Hzballa attacks on the IDF (and not as Israel claims to abide by some UN resolution - Israel has unconcealed disdain for the UN), and the "concession" in Gaza was nothing more than an experiment running a large open-air jail.

In any case, even if you think Arabs can never be appeased (even though anybody who's lived among Arabs will tell you they're one of the most accomodating peoples around) you still shouldn't use the mere words of your enemy as a true indication of what they <cite>expect</cite> to be able to achieve - what they would be satisfied with in the end. That's either simple-mindedness, or demagogy.

> I wonder why your silence on this key point?

How conveniently you forget: I have said many times that Israel needs to exist
(and it needs to exist in that area). It's just that -crazy thought, I know- it also
needs to <cite>behave</cite>; behave as a member of this planetary family, instead of seeing itself as a special, persecuted loner. Not because there is no truth to that, but simply because the future of Jewish children depends on it.

Another conspiracy theory. For six years Israel waited for the opportunity to have its soldiers kidnapped? So it can release hundreds of prisoners as it did in previous trades? It's pure speculation based on prejudice. 

It's alarming how you are willingness to believe the worst of Israel and the converse from the Hezbollah. In fact, Israel has a tradition of doing everything to avoid loss of its soldiers, while terrorists engaged in suicide to attain their ends.

Well, I would be surprised if you could find a link in which you say that. On the other hand I am an old guy and may have forgot...

In any case I am pleased to hear it, and it is interesting to me. If Israel needs to exist, then  it has the right to self-defense. And it is obvious that the government of Israel cannot wave away the threats of extermination as bargaining exaggeration, as you seem to. After all, they have been backed by an over fifty year war of mainly terror attacks, but also some major battles, including the massive attempt to strangle Israel in the cradle, so to speak, in 1948. When a government regularly has citizens being killed, many of them children, it cannot afford to underestimate the enemy. 

So why you can you never find any good thing to say about the actions of Israel or the US, nor any bad things to say about the Syrians, Hezbullah, Hamas, etc? Is it so important to you to always flatter and support the most radical views in the Arab world? </div>

And although we might discuss what "radical" means (you probably classify my rejection of democracy as such, but I think it's just plain logic and sense) you can't accuse me of supporting Arab radicalism (and you can't pretend Jewish radicalism doesn't exist) because I believe the world needs Arabs and Jews to share that land, and share it fairly enough to quell radicalism.

		<div class="commentbody"><em>Ergo: if Israel concedes enough, Arab warmongering would melt away.</em>

From the same logic, though, it follows that in order to encourage Israeli concessions, its opponents would reduce warmongering in response to concessions until, presumably, concessions have increased to the point your envisage and the warmongering has melted away.

There are a number of historical problems with this theory. The first is that, taking your own statement that 'Israel needs to exist (and it needs to exist in that area)' we can perhaps set a minimum size of territory for Israel to occupy, a size which constitutes a viable state and which would be an acceptable concession to the Arabs. What is that minimum size? In order to be a viable state, it probably needs to be larger or at least more contiguous than that specified in the UN partition plan in 1948 (using the same criteria for a viable state now being applied by many people in discussing a possible Palestinian state). But let's ignore the viability issue for a moment, and consider an Israeli state equivalent to the partition plan of 1948. What historical evidence is there to suggest that the Arabs would accept that? They certainly didn't accept it in 1948. The situation in 2006 is surely different, as I'm sure you will be quick to point out, but it is different on the basis of repeated Israeli defeat of aggression from Arab states, to the point where those states have given up on open warfare with Israel. This leads to the second observation, which is that the war being waged against Israel by non-state forces such as Hezbollah, Hamas, Al Aqsa, etc. has repeatedly increased in response to Israeli concessions, which are clearly taken as signs of weakness to be exploited. As your own statements reflect, there is an unwillingness to accept actions by the Israelis as a concession. You see the withdrawal from Gaza as an exercise in running an open prison; there are plenty of Israelis who see it as an exercise in making it easier for Hamas to lauch rocket and mortar attacks into southern Israel, make cross border raids to kill and kidnap Israelis, etc. I have little doubt that both views are valid from the perspectives of the people who hold them. 

This is a terrible and intractable situation, because neither side is encouraged to make any concessions, because neither has any reason to believe that the other side will reciprocate.</div>

It's about the future, not the past. They would accept it because it would be a godsend, at this point. They're desperate (and with good reason). How else do you think they get their young men <cite>and women</cite> to blow themselves up? And how else could they actually believe that Hzballa won this latest battle? Because it is in fact a small victory, the only kind they are allowed.

That they would accept it is not a matter of history, but of common sense. In the current circumstances, it would in fact be a great victory for the Arabs. Which is why it's probably too much to expect from the Jewish side, one of their great motivators being a fear of somehow letting down the Holocaust generation (but to the point of shortchanging the future generations, I feel).

Intractable? There we agree. And it will remain so as long as the voting population of the superpower remains so one-sided. Another hope for real change however lies with China, when it overpowers the US (along the way demonstrating that democracy is not what prosperity -both material and cultural- really needs).

> neither has any reason to believe that the other side will reciprocate.

But it remains, that the greater responsability for peace falls at
the feet of those with the greater power of making it a reality.

John, I don't see how this squares with the massive evidence that Israel has a lot of world pressure to make concessions, and has actually been willing to make concessions for the sake of peace. Israel gave up the Sinai for peace with Egypt. It also made peace with Jordan. 

In 92, Israel agreed to a road map for withdrawal from the West Bank. And then Barak offered to pull out of most of the West Bank, and pulled out of Lebanon unilaterally. Sharon, the most aggressive and brutal of Israeli leaders, unilaterally pulled out of Gaza. Do all these count for nothing?
 
If we look at the response, it looks from where I stand that the Palestinians and Hezbullah have been the ones unwilling to concede that Israel has a right to even an inch of territory. After the road map, there was peace and a difficult process that was none the less moving forward. When Barak offered by far the best deal so far, Arafat walked away from the table and started a new wave of terror assaults against Israel. And Hezbullah continued cross-border assaults in spite of the withdrawal, and loudly trumpeted the destruction of Israel. After the unilateral withdrawal from Gaza, the response was continuing indescriminate assaults against Israeli civilians, and finally an attack on soldiers.    

I think the facts show that the Israelis have been brutal fighters, but in fact are eager for peace. 

Hrant, the policy of always being on the side of the underdog becomes immoral when the underdog is a serial murderer on the run. And more to the point is a terrorist. 

Also the view that the Israel is not the underdog is, from a Jewish perspective, a myopic one. At the beginning, Israel would have been extinguished by Arab attacks from all sides, except that the various parties hesitated because they were quarreling about how to divide up the territory. This allowed Israel to arm. 

After this Israel, population now I think about 6 million, only has been able to survive against the Arabs, population 323 million, by turning itself into a modern Sparta, a state in which every adult is a trained and potentially active, determined soldier. And this only in combination with massive incompetence on the Arab side has kept it alive. In spite of this, the state was almost lost in the '73 war, according to many. 

Now we have Iran doing what much of the world thinks is developing nuclear weapons, and explicitly saying that it wants to wipe Israel off the map. And Hamas and Hezbullah echoing the same policy. I wish that 'Israel under seige' were imaginary, but it is an almost 60 year nightmare. </div>

History has not shown any nation to act purely when involved in bitter conflict, and I cannot imagine any country handling the situation with fewer casualties.

Fair? The side with the largest amount of weapons and most advanced weaponry kills more people, and this has always been the case (which is not the same as saying that the side with the most advanced weaponry always wins). Modern weaponry is designed to kill huge numbers of people, and it is an apalling norm of modern warfare that civilian infrastructure is treated as a legitimate target. [The Falklands War in 1982 was probably the last conflict between modern armed forces in which neither side targeted civilians.]

Speaking of 'unfair': as many Lebanese have said in the past month, it wasn't fair for Hezbollah to unilaterally involve their country in a conflict with Israel. The extreme view is that of the Lebanese writer Michael Behe, who was cheering Israel on in the pages of the New Republic and castigating his government for its own failure to stop Hezbollah setting up a de facto separate state in southern Lebanon.</div>

Of course Israel has made concessions. But they're small,
and they're more than anulled by all the crimes it commits.

It's not the number, it's the <cite>proportion</cite> of civilians killed (both in Iraq and
Lebanon) that helps one see who is the more capable and willing terrorist.

As for the "Hzballa started it" stance, just like William's convenient latching on to official political proclamations, it's either simple-minded or an act of demagogy. Just like any other country Lebanon is not devoid of idiots, and in fact has more than its share of opportunists.

From the Jewish perspective, the unspoken undercurrent justification is that the world is out to get them. The small aspect of truth in that is both dwarfed and amplified greatly by Israel's actions. A self-fulfilling prophecy.

Israel does not think that the US and Europe are out to get it. Nor Egypt nor Jordan. Nor even Palestinian leader Abu Abbas, whom they accept as a man of peace. They do think that Hezbullah and Hamas are out to get them. 

Are the Israelis deluded in thinking this? Well, let's look at the evidence. First both declare openly they are out to eliminate the Jewish state. Secondly they send terrorists across the border to attack innocent Jews going about their business. Thirdly they have regularly shot rockets from Gaza and Lebanon to kill Jewish civilians. 

And you, an Armenian, minimize open threats of 'ethnic cleansing', backed by actual violence! Shame on you, Hrant; you really ought to know better.   

Israel had a perfect right to respond to these attacks. Whether the response was appropriate is a matter of legitimate debate. My friends in Israel said early in the effort that the government were fools to listen to Generals who didn't know what they were talking about. And now there are massive protests against the government in Israel for a what they think was a badly conceived and incompetently executed battle.

The basic dilemma that Israel faced is that it had no good options. Whether the Israeli counter-attack was just a sickening and needless loss of life on both sides, or a justified move, is in my opinion going to depend on the coming months, and whether we end up with a strengthened and peaceful Lebanon. My Israeli friends think that it is going to go from bad to worse. I am a bit more hopeful, but of course I have no idea.     </div>

		<div class="commentbody">If you search Ha'aretz English edition, you'll find a lead article of the weekend edition in which Israel's stance (and the Jewish world's) on the Armenian Genocide was debated--fiercly and critically. Perhaps you could stop your Own Shrill Whining and consider the pluralistic character of the Israeli society. It takes time to heal these wounds and to bring people around. Your style in incendiary, not helpful.
Further, it seems that your rage about the Armenian genocide shapes your view of middle-eastern affairs. Emotions, not facts or logic. It would seem that in spite of all the arguments you raise--some of which are valid--your position boils down to "I am Armenian and therefore I side with the Arabs".
You started this debate with your cryptic (but easily decoded) comments, and it took you dozens of posts to be explicit. Yet no one "persecuted" you. At worst you have been labelled a Jew-hater. But no worry, you too may come around.</div>

Hey, sounds just like Lebanon! "We have no problem with you - we love you! That's <cite>exactly</cite> why we destroyed all your bridges, polluted your sea, and killed 1000+ civilians." Put words into action, if you mean them. "It takes time, it all takes time... but IF YOU PINCH ME I'LL CUT YOUR BROTHER'S HEAD OFF BEFORE YOU'VE PUT YOUR HAND BACK IN YOUR POCKET, ARAB!!"

Rage, say the barbarians.
Look in the mirror - that's our only hope of stopping the lies.

Israel has no anti-Arab marriage laws. It simply failed to embrace civil marriage (to my mind, a big failure), and Jews are affected more than Arabs.

And perhaps you care to read the article on the AG before you comment? Or are you hermetic to anything else than BBC?

I hope your family doesn't get "pinched" by a missile carrying pellets and ball bearings designed to kill civilians since it cannot damage military equipment. 

Polluted the sea, really?! How disproportionate! (I am still searching the map for the "Lebanese sea".)</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I didn‘t follow all of this thread, so I may be a bit OT, but these kinda discussions seem to always lead nowhere. What it does reminds me of, is the particular stance mainstream America has towards Israel: it's comparable to that of the Netherlands up to a couple of years ago — Israel being the good guy and all the Arabs on the other (evil) side. Based, of course, on a national sense of shame: more than a 100,000 Dutch jews were killed by the nazis after being deported by (mostly) Dutch officials during WW 2 (helped by the invention of a very hard to forge ID by a dutch government employee).

In a way the Israeli people are on the other side of the fence now, dishing out, punishing. And I know that most of them hate themselves for that. As they should…

Strange, that people have such disregard for the lessons that history can teach them. And that they are so often guided by guilt.</div>

No, Bert, you've got it wrong. The Israelis are not in the position of the Nazis or their Dutch collaborators. They have been under regular attack from the outside by those with the declared aim of at the very least eliminating the state of Israel. And many of those have often acted as if they would be very happy to finish what the Nazis started. 

Are you unaware of this? And are you not aware that Israel made peace when they had the chance, with Egypt and Jordan? And there were willing to negotiate even with Arafat, who walked away from the negotiating table and started a new terror war? That Israel vacated Lebanon and Gaza, only to be attacked by rockets and troops by those with the declared aim of destroying Israel?

As I wrote above, I think Israel made some terrible mistakes--the invasion of Beirut, the settlements scattered all over the West Bank. And they have treated the Israeli Arab population as second class and have been at times been brutal occupiers. They have, however, been facing a relentless enemy full of hatred whipped up by demagogery from rotten governments, unwilling to make peace and willing to rejoice in terror attacks. 

There is plenty to fault Israel for. But if you look at their opposition, you will see it is far worse, unwilling to make peace when Israel has longed for it for sixty years. 

Bert, before you accuse the Israelis of being like the Nazis, read some history. And talk to some Israelis and some Arabs. Then make up your mind. 

ps. If you think that Israelis are wracked with guilt over defending themselves, you haven't met too many Israelis :)</div>

		<div class="commentbody">No William, Bert seems to be aware of much more than you. Paradoxically thanks to Israeli crimes, the Dutch have finally shed their guilt. Even the Germans are now rising back up. The much bigger issue though is when the US will be able to shed its media's svengali.

The moment you come to accept that the world has gone as far as it can in repairing the effects of the Holocaust, you will start your journey back into the fold of humanity. The other peoples of the world are waiting for your mental recovery.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Ahenakew

Your statements are almost just as bad, and you should also stare at the mirror for linking the Holocaust to the middle eastern dispute, and harder for mongering hate* (even if you don't advocate violence). Holocaust or not, Israel's neighbours didn't accept the Jewish state's right to exist, years before the occupation of the territories.

You could also clean up your style, but that's a different story.

Maybe then try with
A Tale of Love and Darkness (Amos Oz) or 
This year in Jerusalem (Mordecai Richler) or try to travel to Israel. I did it many times and it's an incredible experience, it helps you understand how people live there, what they think and how they raise their kids ( Israel it's incredibly beautiful, children-friendly and clean) and everytime you watch the news you relate to these people and you stop judging the whole thing like it's some sort of football game. Shimon Peres told few stories about Oslo's negotiations in some book, I can't remember the name. He described how Arafat and his crew kept threatening to take the next plane and abort all negotiations every 10 minutes and every time they had to convince him to stay and keep talking. Then one day he did that and people were already exhausted and Shimon Peres told him: "ok, then go: see you there". That <cite> see you there </cite> is so representative of the whole situation, isn't it? It's like saying, well, the problem is not going away just because you refuse to negotiate, is it?
Whatever you think of that, I think Oriana Fallaci was right: Arafat was a horrible person and he's done nothing for his people. And yes, I do know there are loads of myths surrounding Oslo but still, it could have been a start. No?
