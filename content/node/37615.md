  body: "Hi Anna,\r\n\r\nwhat\u2019s the name of the book? \r\nCould it be hand-lettered,
    too? (Hard to say from 4\u2014different\u2014characters \u2026)\r\n\r\nAll I can
    contribute is that the capital \u2018A\u2019 with the minuscule structure is typically
    Italian (\u2014and so is the \u2018B\u2019 with loop). There are <a href=\"http://www.dafont.com/ecolier.font\">some
    free fonts</a> that feature that contrast caused by using a pointed flexible pen,
    but all of them show the \u2018other A\u2019, as it is used in France.\r\nI\u2019m
    not aware of any digital version (of the Italian school script) which has contrast."

    I sat in on his <a href="http://atypi.org/05_Brighton/20_main_program/view_presentation_html?presentid=327">On
    airlines, flame bows and speed loops</a> presentation at ATypI 2007 Brighton and
    it was brilliant.
