body: '[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Untitled-1_5005.jpg] I was hoping you could
  help me to identify the font used for the "Legends" as well as the "Restaurant &
  Bar" I think they are different, but I might be mistaken. Sorry the picture is at
  a bit of an angle.'

  body: I found the Legends portion! It's Gabriola, however I checked and still don't
    think Restaurant and Bar is the same font
