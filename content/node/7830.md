  body: Ugh. I feel for you. <BR> <BR>Opening the E makes things worse, IMHO. That
    eliminates most of the 1 series. The &#34;sun&#34; in  1b and 1c looks too moon-like,
    and it looks weak in 1d. I&#39;d abandon that route. <BR> <BR>Of the ridge solutions,
    2b is probably best. But those holes... To be truly evil, of course, you need
    a big happy sun &#40;cf. the old <a href="http://www.dc-8jet.com/Images/na-dc8-logo-gif-tn.gif">National
    Airlines logo</a>&#41; poking out to the left of the mountain.

    as it was to post these, I did leave that version out of the mix. <BR> <BR>Maybe
    I&#39;ve given up too soon on trying to pitch something they haven&#39;t seen
    yet. <BR> <BR>Mahalo! <BR>Scott

  body: 'Scott: <BR> <BR>From what I see here I&#39;d be inclined to roll with 2b.
    2c has potential because of the ridge&#39;s reference to a graph but it doesn&#39;t
    look as cool. I&#39;d leave the 1 series behind. <BR> <BR>Thinking out loud: <BR>
    <BR>Could you drop the top border to the height of the small caps and have the
    tops of the letters form a ridge? <BR> <BR>Is it a matter of colour? Maybe the
    blue on silver &#40;as sober as it is&#41; creates a too lurid feel. What about
    a more navy blue? What about a navy field and reversed letters? Yeah registration/trapping
    issues but the serifs would survive and it might look sharp. <BR> <BR>In this
    respect see this &#40;~2Mb PDF&#41; <a href="http://vpl.ca/MDC/CIO_Fall_04.pdf"
    target="_blank">http://vpl.ca/MDC/CIO_Fall_04.pdf</a> which is the magazine we
    publish. The cover is silver. Our blue &#40;Pantone 2925U&#41; doesn&#39;t fair
    well, the red &#40;485U&#41; does but don&#39;t use it for finance, and the gold&#39;s&#40;123U&#41;
    okay. Go to the back/second to last page where there&#39;s the ad for Word On
    The Street and see the purple and violets pop against the silver. The effect in
    real life is really nice. Also the yellow and greens. I don&#39;t have those colours
    here but I&#39;m sure you&#39;d be able to zero in on them. <BR> <BR>A silver
    rule between Sun Ridge and Financial Group? <BR> <BR>Not a fan of the white counters
    in S and R but if you&#39;re stuck with &#39;em then that&#39;s that. What happens
    if you add MORE of them? Or is that too insane?... <BR> <BR>Or put on the brakes
    and say I had an epiphany and here&#39;s a totally new direction...and then start
    again. Ugh, I can feel time pressure from here. <BR> <BR>Hope any of this helps.
    Don&#39;t despair. <BR> <BR>Jon'

  body: Scott, 2A or 2B might be more on track. What bothers me is the box. Try loosing
    the box from the S and make the ridge a free form shape.

  body: Scott, you need a creative director or marketing expert with writing talent
    to assist you with your clients. I&#39;ve more than once convinced a client that
    &#34;The Kings new clothes&#34; would be better in red than green.  <BR> <BR>I
    once shot a product that was a rectangle and put it on a linear textured background
    and had that at an angle. After the posters were printed the client came back
    to me and asked why the lines on the background didn&#39;t aline with the product.
    I explained that due to the distortion of the camera it would never look right
    if they were in the same direction. It was bought hook, line and sinker

  body: I can&#39;t tell you how many times I have steered clients away from the wrong
    choice, and taken control of the direction. Once in awhile, however, no matter
    how much consulting I do, a client will not get past their emotional connection
    with something; hence, we end up with a framed, logotype that&#39;s missing a
    few teeth. <BR> <BR>Thank you for your comments, and the others here as well,
    as I am recommitted to salvaging this project. I am going to try to squeeze in
    some time to go back to the drawing board on this one and present a solution they
    will have to connect with. <BR> <BR>Mahalo! <BR>Scott

  body: Scott you sound very self-belittlingly. The logo is not so bad and if the
    client likes it, then it&#39;s his choice.  <BR>  The rigdes on 2b are good and
    maybe you should evolve the design from there. <BR>  I don&#39;t like the murky
    silver. It creates a bad sensation. <BR>  consider the following... <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/54365.jpg"

  body: Galin, please respect the designers here. There was a post or posts about
    making suggesitions, modifiing posts. Please go back and read some of those. I
    never tell a designer what to do other than a suggestion or a marketing direction
    and only in words.

  body: 'I will follow your advice Daniel. Nevertheless, I do respect the designers
    here and maybe even more than you can believe. Please give the link of that post
    in order to read it. I suppose it was better to post the colored sun idea on the
    last color version, than merely post something of the sort : &#34;I like 2b, 1a,
    etc.&#34; ---that kind of post is common here, and it&#39;s not so all-encasing
    either. It surely says personal opinion about the work of the other designer,
    but we all express in different ways and that is the good part of it. If all of
    us were machines and each of us responded in predesigned patterns, than it would
    be a dull monotony. <BR> <BR>If there was a hint of disrespect, it was unintentional.
    <BR> <BR>Salute <BR> <BR>P.S I still think that incorporating the sun in the box
    is a good idea.'

  body: Daniel, I appreciate your defense of the integrity of the designers here.
    <BR> <BR>Galin, don&#39;t sweat it. I did not feel the least amount of disrespect
    or offense by your renditions of my design. Especially in a predominantly English
    language international forum like this where there are varying degrees of English
    communication, I don&#39;t have any issue with showing visuals to explain your
    concept. I was involved in the previous discussion that Daniel referenced. I don&#39;t
    necessarily agree with the perceived verdict to refrain from including visual
    versions of the posting designer&#39;s concept, the main reason being that the
    posting designer can accept and implement, regect and disregard, or completely
    ignore any response. For me, the beauty of this critique forum is that I can bounce
    my concepts off of some super talented and insightful designers

  body: Scott, I feel your pain. I&#39;ll also step apart from the group and vote
    for 2C. I think 2B is too jumbled stylistically, and the mountain peak feels weak
    without an outline. <BR> <BR>Try 2C without the dark upper-right corner. Or, perhaps,
    make the mountain ridge cut down between &#39;Sun&#39; and &#39;Ridge&#39;, then
    fill in the box behind &#39;Sun&#39; and make &#39;Sun&#39; the grey color? This
    will make it look like a ridge rising against a blue sky. Or perhaps make the
    entire box a jagged ridge without any box shape on top? <BR> <BR>Is there any
    way to fill in the S and R? I&#39;m sorry, but that is terribly distracting to
    my eye, and it looks to me as though someone forgot to fill in the counters with
    grey. If you bring this &#39;printing mistake&#39; aspect up with the client,
    maybe they&#39;ll let you change it. <BR> <BR>I guess my basis for these suggestions
    is that I see about 3 or 4 graphic moves in the design that all serve to make
    the name harder, rather than easier, to read. Perhaps you should pick one &#40;i.e.,
    the ridge shape&#41; and get rid of the others. If any of this is unclear, I can
    clarify. Good luck! There&#39;s a good logo in there, keep hacking at it.

  body: While Dan has a point, this is also a basic critiquing method. As visual designers,
    it makes perfect sense to communicate visually when critiquing. You show something,
    people scribble on it. I say let the OP decide if it&#39;s a big deal or not.
