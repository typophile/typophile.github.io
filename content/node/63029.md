  body: "Lower case \"s\" top seems a bit dark and compressed (like it got squooshed
    by a weight falling on its head). The LC \"t\" is interesting but perhaps its
    top is a bit too thin - the left crossbar seems to interact with the curve up
    to the terminal in a not so nice way - too abrupt perhaps? Maybe ease up on it
    by lowering the \"t\" ascender? Overall feel of the typeface is nice enough -
    it feels like a \"Victorian-styled\" Courier. Perhaps the comma tail could be
    extended just a bit more as right now it can be easily mistaken for a period.\r\n\r\nHope
    this helps, take with a grain of salt, and ultimately you will need to decide
    what works best with what you envision for this typeface."

  body: "I find the \"r\" a little unbalanced, something in the curve, maybe a little
    too long.\r\nMost of all, tough, I think the \"Ch\" ligature don't work as intended:
    I keep reading \"herritt\" with a swashed \"h\". The \"C\" letterform should be
    more distinct, maybe wider/rounder."

  body: "Bemerx25 and Riccard0, thatnks very much for your feedback.  I'm inclined
    to agree with all your thoughts and have made some modifications accordingly.
    \ I've attached a revised speciment sheet (Cherrittsample2.pdf) above.  I've also
    added in a few more ligatures.\r\n\r\nBemerx25-I particularly like the idea of
    Cherritt as a 'Victorian Courier'.  Thanks again to both of you for your feedback!\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: just a word to say i think that the minus 'w' and 'x' seems bolder than other
    letters.

  body: "Lefty, on reflection I agree-the 'v' as well I think, thanks for spotting
    it.  I've just added a sample three above, having put the three glyphs on a slimming
    course.\r\n\r\nThanks again!\r\n\r\n"

  body: "I like the idea behind this, but find the same problem with the lc t as Bemerx25.
    \ I also find that arcing problem in the bottom section of the numeral 2.  Also,
    the p and the q don't seem to work.  It may be that the curve of the descender
    is too weak.  I'd agree about the lc s and find the ss glyph too perfunctory,
    as if you have tried to compromise between too much of a difference in size and
    no difference whatsoever. \r\n\r\nFinally, I find the exclamation mark really
    jumps from the different text samples because it is very, very heavy. \r\n\r\nThat
    said, I'd love to see the next generation[s].\r\n\r\nmgk"
