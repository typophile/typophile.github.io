body: "Term used by type designers and [[calligraphy|calligraphers]] to describe the
  area where a stroke splits or branches off from a [[stem]]. The prime example of
  branching occurs on the lower case <strong>h</strong>, and in most [[typeface]]
  designs is repeated, often with variation on <strong>n m u</strong>.\r\n\r\n<strong>Etymology:</strong>
  \"branching\" is most likely borrowed from biology, and is analogous to the split
  form of branches on the trunk or stem of a plant.\r\n\r\nSome [[typographer|typographers]]
  and [[type designer|type designers]] prefer the term <strong>join</strong> or <strong>joint</strong>."
