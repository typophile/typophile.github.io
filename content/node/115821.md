    body: SHE thinks it's too much for a grandmother who has already supported her
      through school while struggling.... WHEN she could just have a FREE font.  Thanks
      for your concern though.

  body: "Then it's probable you should compromise on your font choice. Or this might
    be a good opportunity to teach a young person about the value of hard work (which
    font design very much involves). Because most font designers are in the same financial
    boat as you, and you need to understand the essential problem with your request,
    especially in a place dedicated to type designers. Just because you can get something
    for free doesn't make it a good idea in the overall.\r\n\r\nAnd let me ask you:
    what are some ~$30 items you have bought for her recently?\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

title: Does anyone know a similar font to Snell Roundhand?  I just hate paying so
  much for a font when there may be something similar.
