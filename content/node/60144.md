  it was originally created in 1925 by Lucian Bernhard, but I can''t find any information

  body: Based on the design and the time period I'd guess it was for advertising purposes.
    If you could find it in an original specimen book or find an original specimen
    that would more than likely answer your questions.

  body: "Meredith --\r\n\r\nLucian Bernhard was an important and influential German
    poster designer of the period. The Lucian typeface, designed for Bauersche Geisserei
    (as was the similar Bernhard Roman), was based on one of his styles of lettering.
    Bernhard subsequently designed a few other typefaces in this same style for other
    foundries, including Bernhard Booklet and Bernhard Modern Roman (ATF, 1937).\r\n\r\nI
    can't say what the \"intended use\" of the design was.\r\n\r\nThe 1920s & 30s
    saw a bit of a trend in these type styles with small x-heights, tall ascenders,
    short descenders, and wide capitals. Compare Cochin (Deberny & Peignot, 1915;
    Monotype, 1917; ATF, 1925) and Egmont (Amsterdam Typefoundry and Intertype, ca.
    1930s).\r\n\r\nI believe the first use of Lucian in an American book (maybe the
    only) was the first title issued under the Random House imprint -- Voltaire's
    <em>Candide,</em> illustrated by Rockwell Kent, composed and printed by the Pynson
    Printers, and issued in April 1928.\r\n\r\nThis information was gleaned from Mac
    McGrew's <em>American Metal Typefaces of the Twentieth Century</em> [New Castle,
    DE. Oak Knoll Books, 1993] -- seek out a copy through your university's library
    -- and my own copy of the 1975 facsimile of the Random House <em>Candide</em>.\r\n"

    but I don't know if it's widely available.
