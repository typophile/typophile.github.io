  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Greetings to the forum. :-)

I've been trying and trying to identify the fonts in the samples attached, but with (almost) no success so far, thus I would greatly appreciate if you could please help?

Sample 1 (which is from 1986):

[img:sites/default/files/old-images/pop86_3499.JPG]


Closest match I got so far was <a href=http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/berling/>Berling</a>... (I'm only somewhat in doubt cos of the italic "f"?... It could also be that it may possibly have gotten misprinted, though, don't know?...  Since it's printed in plastic...)

Sample 2 (which is from 1997):

[img:sites/default/files/old-images/pop97_4368.JPG]


No idea of this other one. Also no idea whether the obliqued letters are the actual italic version of the font, or then just custom slanted?... (Possibly the later?...)

I'm also adding all other characters I have from the sample I have from this font, if useful:

[img:sites/default/files/old-images/pop97all_4965.JPG]


Once more, thank you greatly, for all further help, identifying these fonts. :-)

I think you're right about Berling.

With regards to the font used in the second sample, hmm, I see... (You mean something as what's referred for example <a href=http://help.adobe.com/en_US/Acrobat/8.0/Standard/help.html?content=WS566B3A80-3839-4e12-B776-FCFBF60D09EA.html>in this article</a>, correct?)

Curiously, though, the printed source of this sample does include also other fonts, and these other fonts do all appear correctly... I wonder, would this be "weird" at all, or?... I.e. I mean, it is possible that, in case a file has more than one font, some may have been embeded properly, and only one or another not, right? (Which would be the case here, then, I guess.) Or? Hmm...

On the other hand, hmm, would it by chance be possible that the Adobe Serif Substitution Font as you mention, would have been chosen "deliberately"? Or not at all? In other words, are these Adobe Master Susbstitution Fonts exclusively for being "called up" when the original font in a document is missing, or can themselves as well be chosen to be the original font from the start, just like any other font, or?... (I hope you understand my doubt?... And please do pardon my ignorance... :-P)

Also, would there be any website you could please refer me to, where I could view the charmap of the Adobe Serif Substitution Font, and as well the italic version of it? Much appreciated. (Been looking, but can't seem to find that anywhere...)</div>

Not possible because it won't show up in any font selection menu. It virtually is a 'ghost font'.


> <em>Or not at all? In other words, are these Adobe Master Susbstitution Fonts exclusively for being “called up” when the original font in a document is missing, (…)</em>

Correct

> <em>or can themselves as well be chosen to be the original font from the start, just like any other font, or?...</em>

No, because this is not 'any other font' -- it's an automatic substitution font whose characters and letter widths are squooshed and stretched to perfectly fit another font's widths.

> <em>Also, would there be any website you could please refer me to, where I could view the charmap of the Adobe Serif Substitution Font, and as well the italic version of it?</em>

No, there isn't, for the reasons mentioned above. This font was never intended to be used on purpose.</div>
