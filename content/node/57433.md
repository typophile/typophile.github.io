  body: "Hi Nick, I know one or two members frequent facebook, and post messages there.
    Or through Twitter.\r\n\r\nPersonally I prefer instant messaging or even skype,
    although I'm not sure how many members are on skype, or enjoy talking to starngers
    (even though it's free).\r\n\r\nAndy\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: "No, I mean WHERE IS IT? There used to be one I'm sure. I need to get in touch
    with someone specific and certainly haven't got the time and can't be arsed with
    \ all that Facebook/twitter baloney. - I just yawned and looked out of the window
    - Really? oh how fascinating!\r\n\r\n\r\nNick Cooke"

  body: One option is that you can look at their Typophile profile by clicking on
    their name or icon and send them an email from there. You could also ask for their
    Skype or other IM name by email if it isn't too baloneyesque. You could also ask
    a mutual pal to put you in touch with each other.
