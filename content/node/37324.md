body: I am looking for a typeface that is inspired by traditional Mexico that has
  the elegance of a Bodoni with the angles of a Latin. Any suggestions?

    I wouldn\u2019t say that it\u2019s \u201Ctraditional Mexico\u201D per se, but
    it is Latin in flavor. "

  body: "I'm glad someone brought this up because there are some serious HOT FONTS
    coming from Mexico and other latin countries. Although not a requirement, I would
    start with fonts designed by actually Latin people. There aren't a lot of Mexican
    typographic traditions per se, so naturally these fonts are cutting edge to many
    of us!\r\n\r\nhttp://www.pampatype.com \r\nSeemingly focused on literary types.
    Rayuela=beauty!\r\n\r\nhttp://www.kimeratype.com/ \r\nI think I love everything
    coming from the guy! Mexica says it all. Artifex is wonderful too. His custom
    designed types for El Economista really conveys the \"super-ellipse\" theme prevalent
    in Mexican design.\r\n\r\nI ditto Bohemia, by Argentian Edurdo Manso. I own it.
    I love it. And it is certainly elegant like a Bodoni. The Bold is scrumptious
    as is the rest of the family. I'm in the process of working with it now. Relato
    and Relato Sans might also be of interest to you too.\r\n\r\nFunny Patzcuaro is
    mentioned. I'm of the opinion that many of Storms' types have a rustic wrought
    quality seen in Mexican type.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.stormtype.com/typefaces-fonts-shop/families-31-mramor\r\n\r\nSee
    Patzcuaro in action: http://www.lospoblanos.com/ Super beautiful!\r\n\r\nGalliard
    and Mantina are also very Spanish. Even Sophia could work.\r\n \r\nRuben Fontana
    just released some fonts through FontShop- very chiseled.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/neufville/andralis_nd_regular_fa02_ot/\r\n\r\nhttp://www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/neufville/andralis_nd_bold_fa04_ot/\r\n\r\nBut
    on the other side of the world there is a very special text system by Portuguese
    designer, Ricardo Santos- not chiseled but lovely.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.vanarchiv.com/atlantica.html\r\n\r\nI
    suggest you browse Luc Devroye page and check out what's happening in the Mexican
    font scene.\r\n\r\nhttp://cg.scs.carleton.ca/~luc/fonts.html\r\n\r\nhttp://cg.scs.carleton.ca/~luc/mexico.html\r\n\r\nI
    hope you find what you are looking for,\r\n\r\nMike Diaz :-)"

    face.\r\n\r\nThere are some Latin faces out there that are strictly display -
    and fun to use. Hmmmm, oh, like House Industries Latino family.\r\nhttp://www.houseind.com/index.php?page=showfont&id=142\r\n\r\nOn
    the other hand, forget it - they aren't elegant - just fun!"

    I was checking places like pampatype and Gabriel Mart\xEDnez Meave's work, and
    it didn't have the contrast and elegance I was looking for. I think I have some
    new directions to try out.  Thanks again."
