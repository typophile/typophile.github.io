body: 'hi to you all, <BR> <BR>this being a forum of experts I wondered if you could
  possibly help me to identify a font I saw used some time ago and of which I unfortunately
  have no visual to go with this post. <BR> <BR>well, just in case: <BR>the font I
  saw looked a bit like &#34;Fette Fraktur&#34; &#40;or a similar font&#41; but was
  broken up into a grid of tiny pixels &#40;all separated by a small space - not &#34;compact&#34;
  like a bitmap font going with a PS Type 1 font&#41; . the kind of look you&#39;d
  probably get when you display a Fraktur font on a big LED display with angular LEDs
  all separated by a thin line from each other. <BR> <BR>it&#39;s a quite intriguing
  sight: that historical Fraktur feel combined with present day &#34;computer&#34;-looks
  - a marriage of old and new quite different from Jonathan Barnbrooks &#34;&#40;Spindly&#41;
  Bastard&#34; for example. <BR> <BR>do you by any chance have an idea if this is
  a &#34;known&#34; font - commercial or shareware? in that case I&#39;d be happy
  if you could give a hint where to look for it - but then again it might as well
  have been especially made for that brochure I saw it used in... <BR> <BR>TIA <BR>Peter'

    target="_blank">&#34;Brea&#34;</a> by Corey Holms that is somewhat like what you
    described, except that it is more of the Old English Blackletter style.

    Fraktur/computer characteristics.

    target="_blank"> Linkety link</a> - I was thinking of that one as well, but indeed
    it&#39;s  <BR>more of a script.
