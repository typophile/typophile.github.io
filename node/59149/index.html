  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Hi,

I have tried to search the forums for anything on this subject but could not find anything. I am designing a book in Adobe Indesign ME CS4 on mac and we are using Microsoft's Traditional Arabic font in Regular and bold. I am not able to export a PDF as I get a message saying the font cannot be embedded due to licensing restrictions. Does anybody know who designed this font and is it possible to buy a unrestricted version? I have tried calling Microsoft Corporation but with no success. I am able to print the file as Postscript and then open it in Preview which converts it to a PDF. I can then save as a PDF from here but this seems to only work with A4 page size. My book is square and I cannot get this method to work for my size.

Thanks in advance.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">First of all, this font is set to "Editable Embedding". So there is no restriction on embedding the fonts into a PDF. 

We hear problems like this from time to time (with Microsoft fonts, even though embedding is set to Embeddable). So my suspicion is that it is a problem with Adobe Acrobat and its settings that prevent certain fonts from being embedded.

Has anyone else experienced this problem with other fonts set to Preview & Print or Embeddable Embedding?

Ascender has a license to a wide variety of Microsoft fonts, but unfortunately this is one of the few that we cannot offer. We have tried to obtain the rights from the original designer/foundry without success. So there is not much further I can suggest to help.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Hi Billdavis,

Thanks for the reply - yes seems strange as I didn't have this problem with CS3 Indesign ME. It worked as long as you had the font installed on your system. I will look at the Acrobat settings. We may not use this font after all so that will be better than exporting the pages as jpegs and then importing back into Indesign to make the PDFs.</div>
