  &#39;stara&#39; is just the letterforms stretched and played with. The &#39;Neil&#39;
  part should be it&#39;s bold version. thanks! xx natty <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/36835.jpg"

    Not sure what those a&#39;s are, though.

    called Temperance, and it&#39;s one of the most beautifully  <BR>fragile, f&#42;&#42;&#42;ed
    up Helvetica-Times hybrids you&#39;ve seen in  <BR>your lifetime. <BR> <BR>Hi
    Natalija, it&#39;s been too long! How is the expert in everything  <BR>pink doing?

  body: It is real. I&#39;m running an &#39;on the street&#39; art remix project.
    This is my first piece. It&#39;s been given to another artist who will &#39;remix&#39;
    it.  Then to the next artist and so on. Each time someone is finished I photograph
    it so that the evolution is recorded &#40;or de-evolution via weather or govt!&#41;
    Naturally I started with pink on the grey phallic poles of our steralised urban
    environment. Hopefully I can print up big photos for an exhibition after the project!

    border=0> Great! I really dig these kinda projects. I can  <BR>imagine what it
    must feel like to be driving by and  <BR>suddenly notice the pink pole, a visual
    anomaly  <BR>that makes your day a little more surreal. And then  <BR>to wonder
    what that exactly was you saw and what  <BR>it could have meant. Very nice...
    <BR> <BR>Will you be posting the photos online as well? If  <BR>so please let
    us know!
