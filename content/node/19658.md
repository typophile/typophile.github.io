    body: thanks manlio, yes i agree metro gothic is very similar however it is very
      heavy and of course as you've pointed out the "a" is very different. thanks
      for the suggestion. - K

  body: This one is hard to ID since there are billions of techno/sci-fi fonts (especially
    free fonts) out there. These are relatively easy to create and if this was a logo
    it was probably custom.
