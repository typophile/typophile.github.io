  in his <em>Mechanik exercises: or the doctrine of handy-works applied to the art
  of printing</em>: \"By the typographer, I do not mean a printer, as he is vulgarly
  accounted, any more than Dr Dee means carpenter pr mason to be an architect: but
  by typographer, I mean such a one, who by his own judgement, from solid reasoning
  within himself, can either perform, or direct other to perform the beginning to
  the end, all the handy-works and physical operations relating to typographie.\"\r\n\r\nThis
  typographer definition endures in time. But, what the definition of typedesigner?
  Is just someone who can preform, or direct others to perform the beginning to the
  end, the digital handy-works of designing  a typeface? or is just a 'modern' definition
  of typographer? \r\n"

    \"typographer\" that's been watered out, as people make the photographer connection
    and assume a typographer creates type. "

  body: 'Ralf, bricklayers are professionals too! But while the bricklayer is rarely
    a designer, the typographer these days is generally an expert in both designing
    and setting the page, both macro and detail typography. In the analogy that would
    be both the designer and builder of the structure, with pre-fabricated materials,
    the bricks or type. '

    What's the difference between a typographer and a graphic designer then?\r\n\r\nMaybe
    then someone wants to edit this page:\r\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_type_designers"

  body: ">What's the difference between a typographer and a graphic designer then?\r\n\r\nTo
    me, the difference is that graphic design involves photos, charts and illustrations
    as well as type. \"Typography\" refers only to the arrangement of type on the
    page, not the other elements. So I would put it more accurately: \r\n\r\nTypography:
    the craft and art of laying out and setting text on the page or screen. \r\n\r\nA
    typographer is someone with expertise in typography. Will that do?"

    statements. I just wonder which ones are really useful. :-)\r\nI don't know anyone
    today who would just arrange type for a living. They are all graphic designers,
    screen designers or something like that. \r\n\r\n<cite>A typographer is someone
    with expertise in typography.</cite>\r\n\r\nThis would also be my definition.
