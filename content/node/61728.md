  she found somewhere on the web. She can't remember exactly where, though.\r\n\r\nI'm
  specifically looking for the \"a\" and \"y\" that are on the far left and far right
  of the middle line and the ampersand that's on the line above that.\r\n\r\nAny help
  or direction would be greatly appreciated!\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/101_img3472_6060.jpg]"
