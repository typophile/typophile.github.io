  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>In the past several weeks, I have received two separate distribution agreements from entities with whom I have done business, and which I find rather alarming.</p>
<p>Both agreements contain non-disclosure provisions—but, since I haven’t signed the agreements yet, I don’t feel bound by them; nonetheless, the parties shall remain nameless, and you can fill in the blanks.</p>
<p>In one instance, an established entity has offered to market my fonts for a 60% take; in the other, for negotiating OEM licenses, another entity wants 80% of the take. However, in both cases, these entities want zero percent of the liability, in the event that anyone files suit for copyright or patent infringement, or whatever.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right: the distributors want 60% or 80% of the upside, and 0% of the downside. Is it just me, or does this seem to be a gross abuse of what is effectively market monopolization?</p>

<p>Gross would be 99%, I think. But it sounds much like pitchforks and torches to me, and if we &ldquo;man the walls&rdquo; they&rsquo;ll be no one on the phones.</p>
<p>Another idea is perhaps to negotiate? (that&rsquo;s when they say 80, then you say 40, then they say 79, then you say 39, and so on).</p>
<p>Yet another idea is:  if there is in fact 0(%) downside in the protection, marketing, sales and support of your fonts, you should be able to do it yourself for free! and keep all 100%! (something I wish I could do but it seems to cost something to protect, market, sell and support fonts, build tools, blog, and hire guards for the walls).</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Those percentages are excessive for essentially acting as a distributor. Although as distributors it’s not surprising that they’re unwilling to take on risk; it’s your product after all, not theirs. They’re just helping you sell it.</p>
<p>Setting up your own store is a partial solution, although the setup and upkeep is not trivial. The sales I make through my store are only about half as many compared to the sales I make through online middlemen. So, if I dumped my third-party distributors, maybe it would be a wash. The extra money I would make on direct sales would compensate for the sales lost not dealing with a distributor. Except right now I’m making money on both, so I would actually lose money if I went totally independent, as well as the extra exposure being on a big site provides.</p>
<p>So, yeah, set up your own store – or maybe ask around about joining some other small foundry’s store that’s a good fit; that kind of mutual cooperation and assistance seems like a worthwhile path to explore.</p>
<p>And still look for bigger distributors who don’t insist on a huge cut. For us small foundries I suspect there’s no room for negotiation with them. Unless you’ve got something really hot that the distributor wants, it’s no big deal to them if they don’t sign you up.</p>

<p>Which would probably work to everyone’s advantage until the enterprise became successful enough to be bought out by the Elephant in the Room—which shall remain nameless—or sued into nonexistence for some alleged patent infringement—which appears to be Apple’s preferred method of protecting its market share.</p>
<p>There is undeniable value in having one’s fonts listed on the big sites. Sheer gravity attracts many potential buyers, and sophisticated search/sort/tag routines can drive a lot of traffic to one’s wares which might not have otherwise shown up. The large aggregators advertise aggressively and cover the infrastructure costs. In other words, yes: they provide a valuable service, which would be expensive to replicate.</p>
<p>On the other hand, independent foundries provide the products which the behemoths flog so effectively: in other words, it’s a symbiotic relationship. The problem is, the mutual nature of this interdependency isn’t reflected in the revenue and risk-sharing terms offered. Half a loaf may be better than none; 20% to 40% of a loaf is another matter entirely.</p>

<p>How valuable is the customer data you collect from your own store? Do you use it to market directly to your customers and to help you decide who to target with marketing efforts intended to bring in new customers? Would you be able to customize your marketing well without data collected from direct sales?</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->We could use some sort of United Font Designers<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>What we should do is work together to commission an online store platform that makes selling fonts easy. T-shirt designers have a wealth of online shop themes and plugins because they pay for addons for Wordpress e-commerce and Zen Cart. A group of font designers could pool resources to generate a series of Wordpress e-Commerce plugins to integrate everything from menus to type testers to web font generators. Contact me if you are interested.</p>

If you think they can sell three times more than you then you getting only 40% is good.

<p>You are indeed prohibited from using that information to market or sell things to folks, sure; I think this is pretty common and pro-consumer. Customers get quite unhappy when they buy a font from MyFonts and then receive unsolicited email from another party – even if it’s from the person or foundry that designed or released the type itself.</p>

You could include “for a limited time, visit the designer at xxxx.com for a free limited edition bonus x,” or something to that effect. I’m not sure how this would work, but I think it could be done; please email us at <a href="mailto:info@myfonts.com">info@myfonts.com</a> if you would like to discuss this further.</p>
<p>We very specifically tell users when they buy type from us that they will not get unsolicited commercial email from any third party; if we allow you to use those email addresses to contact buyers, then we come liable for violating our promise to them.</p>

<p>The liability issue really wasn’t the main point: it simply served to emphasize that “partnering” with these distributors has taken on a rather lop-sided meaning—as have a lot of other terms in the virtual economy, such as “free” and “unlimited.” Generally, one walks hand-in-hand with a partner; when the relationship is unequal, it feels more like the partner is acting as if he has a hold on another part of one’s anatomy.</p>
<p>Bottom line: foundries create the products, the mass marketers sell them. Without product, the mass marketers got nothing; without the mass marketers, foundries would have to create their own markets, advertise, develop and maintain sophisticated e-commerce websites, and handle all the nuts-and-bolts little problems that attend everyday life.</p>
<p>So, once again: it’s a symbiotic relationship. The proceeds ought to be divvied up accordingly.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I think you should add an opt-in* for receiving emails from the foundry, allow foundries to directly solicit sales (at least of MyFonts products) but require a CC/BCC of any communication**. Since you&rsquo;re providing the contact info it can be abused anyway, but at least with this mechanism you&rsquo;ll get foundries to do marketing for you; everybody wins (except users who are touchy about even being offered an opt-in - a rare breed).</p>
<ul>
<li>Or even an opt-out, although that might push the touchiness (see end) threshold too much.</li>
</ul>
<p>** Action can be taken if the communication violates the agreement.</p>

<p>Anyway If I&rsquo;m going to go through all you suggest, it would really just be easier for me to include some sort of freebie coupon code or link as a pdf in the zipfile.  However, I don&rsquo;t know how much this would feel like the customers are getting something extra, or more than what they paid for; which is the effect I&rsquo;m after.</p>
