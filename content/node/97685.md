body: I saw this in a recently produced documentary photography book, being used to
  typeset quotes. It resembles handwriting in pen and ink, and is slightly blotchy
  in outline. I wonder if the spaced out characters are indicative to the font or
  whether they have been treated that way. The spacing makes it look modern, but the
  characters, especially the r and ascending/descending characters look old fashioned.
  Any clues?
