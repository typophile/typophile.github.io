  Titling Light Swash, but the budget doesn't allow to buy the whole package, and
  unfortunately HFJ doesn't sell the individual faces.  So we're sadly left trying
  to find a Typeface that will be able to fit the following:\r\nA) Sold individually,
  not as package\r\nb) Have some of the same characteristics as Hoefler Titling Light
  Swash, particularly the uppercase \"E\" and \"K\"\r\n\r\nThanks and help is greatly
  appreciated.\r\nDaniel\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/hoeflerTitling_6739.jpg]"

    Display Italic Swash</a> might work.\r\n\r\nPs. I couldn't get Font Bureau's site
    to load, I'd recommend licensing it direct from them."

    single font for an increased amount. '

  body: "WOW!  you guys rock.  Thank you so much!\r\n\r\nMiss Tiffany-\r\nGreat suggestions.
    I think that might work.  I also looked into the HFJ licensing individual fonts,
    but you have to purchase it for a WHOLE bunch of seats, which isn't really worth
    it $$ wise, cheaper to buy the whole family.\r\n\r\nLorem- These look really promising
    as well, esp the Caslon Italic Swashes.\r\n\r\n\r\nAgain, much appreciated."

    sturdy alternative.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/eva_6628.png] \r\nIn
    addition to Miss Tiff\u2019s suggestion:\r\nGaramond Premier Pro has an alternate
    \u2018k\u2019. And if you dig the light weight, you can go really slender with
    it as it comes in optical sizes \u2013 this one would be \u2018Light Italic Display\u2019."
