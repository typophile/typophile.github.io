  body: I was labeled at Helvetica which made me REALLY proud as my Grandfather emigrated
    from Switzerland so my last name is of Swiss origin. However, reading the description
    didn't match me at all.

    more fonts and more questions I would end up more along the lines of Whitney.

    the only way they can propagate the species is through online font matching services.\r\n\r\nSounds
