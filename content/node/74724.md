  body: Just as digital type allowed grunge and all the other lovely experiments we've
    been looking at for 20 years, photo-type liberated a whole generation of typographers
    from the confines of metal type and standard spacing. It's not as bad as some,
    not as good as others. Just a moment in typographic time.

  body: "The reason Nick's first example is good and Brian's is shit is in the details.
    In Nick's example, look at the consistency of rhythm as the round forms touch
    the straights, wonderful! It might be overly tight for today's taste, but it was
    done with skill and a sensitivity to typographic rhythm. Nick's second example
    demonstrates the same attention to detail, Brian's looks like crap.\r\n\r\n"

  body: Close but not touching was the way of the world in the 70s-80s.  If you cut
    your typography teeth back then, tight looks normal.  Take a look at old U&lc
    and see how even body text was tight. A lot of it has to do with the fit of the
    type. The type designed then had big x-height and a tight fit.  Remember the old
    Apple ads in ITC Garamond?

  body: Haha. Mine wasn't meant to look good - just be super tight. I can definitely
    see the rhythm in the original example, it doesn't look bad, just tight.

  body: That was the style when I first started trying to set and spec my own type.
    It seemed sophisticated at the time, even rebellious. There was something "now"
    about it. It took a few years to unlearn it and discover that there is more to
    spacing type than "as tight as possible".

  body: "I started in the late 80's so just caught the end of this period and remember
    seeing the first ads that were set really open, lots of condensed sans fonts super
    spaced out. I'm actually seeing a lot of stuff now that looks like the Stelazine
    ad.\r\n\r\nGood thing about \"tight as possible\" makes kerning a lot easier!"

  body: I'm ecstatic that the "everything must be loose" trend is dying to over, from
    jeans to type. Many of us brought up loving especially the work of Herb Lubalin
    (U&lc, Avant Garde to Lubalin, Smith & Carnase and friends) will probably forever
    prefer tighter settings for advertising and display work. Sure, many are absolutely
    correct, massively tight/overlapping doesn't work for everything, and looser sets
    generally work much better for applications such as books and other long materials.
    The one thing I've always tried to get across to anyone I trained in proper spacing
    and kerning is not so much demanding everything be set loose or super tight (which
    remains my preference), but that it be done evenly. To me, the worst spacing is
    trying to mathematically space each character exactly the same distance apart
    (which I still see way too much in some large display applications). Anything
    from super tight/touching to quite loose can look great if proper visual "rules"
    are followed. To some, that can be the hardest thing to teach, but it's always
    worth the effort to achieve fine typography, as well as optimal readability and
    legibility.

    this tight spacing using the Rutherford photo typesetter, which, I believe, existed
    long before VGC's Typositor.
