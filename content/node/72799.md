  body: "Wow. A 19-letter ambigram is a tough piece of work, and I think you did a
    pretty good job already. I would love to offer some help but I feel like I'd need
    a lot of time to find ways to improve it, and I really have to go to bed early
    tonight :-)\r\n\r\nOne question though: Have you considered using a vector drawing
    tool to do this? If not, I'd suggest you do. <a href=\"http://www.inkscape.org\">Inkscape</a>,
    for example, is free and awesome. It may take an hour to get used to, but it'll
    be worth the time, particularly for your project where you have to duplicate the
    halves all the time."

  body: "Hey, thanks Sebastian. \r\nI appreciate the Inkscape suggestion and have
    already downloaded it - still figuring out the basics. I've found a couple online
    tutorials for vector font creation, but if anyone has any favorites, feel free
    to pass 'em allong. Also, for all the font masters out there - anyone know a font
    that is similar to what I have here (I realize that my style is inconsistent)?
    Im looking for just some inspiration on how to standardize my font across the
    various letters. I like the \"Haile Rober\" section of text best if that helps.\r\nMany
    thanks! "

  body: "Well, as for font suggestions, <a href=\"http://www.google.ca/search?q=celtic+fonts\">google
    \"Celtic Fonts\"</a> or similar terms. You could also use the category/tag systems
    on sites like <a href=\"http://new.myfonts.com/tags/Irish/\">myfonts</a>.\r\n\r\nI'm
    not sure whether \"vector font creation\" is the correct thing to look for. You
    will probably find tutorials for <a href=\"http://www.fontlab.com\">FontLab</a>
    and <a href=\"http://fontforge.sourceforge.net\">FontForge</a>, both of which
    allow you to design the single letters instead of whole pieces of artwork. Instead,
    get Inkscape and look through the <a href=\"http://inkscape.org/doc/index.php?lang=en\">online
    documentation</a> (or just play around for a bit, that works too). There are also
    some great screencasts on Youtube that explain vector programs quite well.\r\n\r\nIf
    you want typographic advice on how to draw good letters, I'd say look around in
    this forum. There are many threads like <a href=\"http://typophile.com/node/72465\">this
    one</a> with plenty of links to type design tutorials.\r\n\r\nCheers!"
