body: "<strong>[[Indices]] : [[Technical Info]] : Digital Signature</strong>\r\n\r\nA
  digital signature is a way to authenticate the authorship of a file. Only [[OpenType]]
  and [[TrueType]] fonts are capable of being signed with a digital signature as the
  signature is stored in an [[OpenType Table]] named <a href=\"http://www.microsoft.com/typography/otspec/dsig.htm\">DSIG</a>.
  In the case of TrueType [[flavor|flavored]] OT fonts, the digital signature is the
  singular key which determines whether or not the font is marked as an OpenType font
  with the <em>O</em> icon. This means that TT flavored OT fonts that are not signed
  will not display the <em>O</em> icon and TT fonts that are signed but have no other
  OT features will display the <em>O</em> icon.\r\n\r\n<strong>Additional Articles</strong>\r\n<a
