  body: "Both the Q and the K would depend on what the rest of the typeface looks
    like. The Q with the centered tail is quirky and doesn't scan quickly, but it
    might be appropriate if the rest of the alphabet exhibits similar characteristics.
    \ \r\n\r\nThe K's don't stand alone - the first K has a broad, extended appearance,
    while the second K is more vertical and sleeker. Which one matches the other glyphs?\r\n\r\nTaken
    by themselves, I like the first Q and second K as members of an alphabet; for
    artistic value, I like the second Q. And still the second K.\r\n\r\nBut then,
    that's why there's Open Type and alternate glyphs!\r\n\r\n- Herb"

  body: I agree with both. As stand alone letters I like the first Q and second K,
    but that could easily change depending on their surroundings. Are the letters
    a part of a typeface?
