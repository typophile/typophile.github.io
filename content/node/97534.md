body: "hello folks, i have aquestion about ot scripting.\r\n\r\nthe font i'm working
  on is uppercase only and it has a lot of stylistic sets. of course i had to include
  lowercase glyphs too, but they just mirror the uppercase glyphs. however, for the
  alternative glyphs, i don't do uc and lc for each one of them, only the uc.\r\n\r\nthen
  i put only the uc glyphs in my stylistic sets classes and so for this to work with
  the lc as well, i'm doing a lookup that changes lowercase into uppercase before
  each substitution.\r\n\r\nfeature ss01 {\r\n\tlookup ss01a { sub @lower by @upper;
  } ss01a;\r\n\tlookup ss01b { sub @class_0 by @class_1; } ss01b; # they contain only
  uppercase \r\n} ss01;\r\n\r\nthis way it's more organized, easier to script and
  the font has only one alternative glyph for both the uc and lc version of each base
  glyph. but is this method okay from the performance and usability point of view?\r\n\r\ni
  hope it's all understandable :) thanks!"
