  body: "The \"Oberg\" line is Bookman Black (vendor unknown). If only a roman exists,
    then it needs to be condensed to 80% and slanted 15\xB0. The second line I cannot
    identify; it is too fuzzy.\r\n\r\n[edit]\r\nIn addition, the /G in \"Oberg\" has
    been modified.\r\n\r\nFYI: Please do not post duplicate Font ID requests; edit
    your original to push it to the top instead. That saves a duplication of effort
    on the part of those trying to help."
