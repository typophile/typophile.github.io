body: I can&#39;t make suitcase preview my fonts correctly. I have <BR>5 related designs
  in FontLab, all separate files. When <BR>I generate either truetype, type 1 or OTF
  then drop them  <BR>into suitcase the preveiw will only show one or two  <BR>fonts,
  or none at all. But when I use them in illustrator <BR>they seem to work fine and
  dandy. Can anybody help?
