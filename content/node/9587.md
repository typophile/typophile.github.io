body: So, I&#39;ve followed the many suggestions on typophile and am now ready to
  make my font public. What is the standard information to include in an EULA? Do
  I model mine after an existing example? What do I need to change, if I decide to
  follow my previous question. And what worked for you when you first started. Perhaps
  there is another thread that explains this, however I couldn&#39;t find one. Thanks
  for your help <BR> <BR>tim

  body: Tim, I would have to say that modeling your user agreement after an existing
    one is not such a bad idea. Take a look through a half dozen or so and pick and
    choose from these to create your own that fits your needs and desires. Keep what
    you like, throw out what you don&#39;t.  <BR>  <BR>Of the half dozen you choose
    to reference for your model make sure that they are reputable sources. The more
    legitimate the foundry is the more likely their licensing is legitimate to.  <BR>  <BR>But
    remember copying is bad. It needs to be <i>your</i> license in the end.  <BR>  <BR>Otherwise
    get a lawyer. But he/she would probably start from an existing one as well.   <BR>  <BR>I
    think you could write one yourself.  <BR>  <BR>Good Luck.   <BR>  <BR>-smc <BR>
    <BR>PS. I&#39;m glad you liked my joke. I thought of it over a pile of beer-battered
    shrimp. Not to mention the beer.
