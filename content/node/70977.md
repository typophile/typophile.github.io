    shouldn\u2019t that be Gotham instead of Univers?"

  body: "Ugh, it looks like they tried to imitate the NYT with the masthead, but they
    gave up with the rest of the layout and wound up with That Thing. Why is it that
    filmmakers who otherwise have such attention to detail think it's okay to just
    throw together a newspaper like that, especially if the newspaper plays some sort
    of role in advancing the plot (which it usually does if they bother to make their
    own newspaper)? It always takes me out of the film when there's a poorly designed
    newspaper with an important plot-point headline.\r\n\r\nEdit: It's [[http://www.dafont.com/germanica-family.font?text=The+Gotham+Times|Germanica]]."

    Kanzlei is the original name.

  body: Ah, okay. I just went through DaFont until I found the right one, which is
    my SOP to identify poorly-spaced grunge or blackletter fonts.

    \r\nhttp://www.whysoserious.com/    Its the brown note that has the heading \"To
    Do\" at the top. I was recommended to use broken typewriter, just wondering if
    you all concur or would suggest anything differnet?"

  body: It looks like they used Courier and did the broken baseline manually, which
    is funny because a broken typewriter is one time where that sort of effect should
    be consistent.
