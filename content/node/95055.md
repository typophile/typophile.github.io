  seen anything like it and think it would look great on a scrapbook page I have planned.\r\n\r\nI've
  been looking around for a while and haven't even come close to identifying it...
  would someone here happen to know what it is so that I can finally satisfy my curiosity,
  and hopefully get that scrapbook page finished.\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/273875221059417300_p7izraKw_f_4099.jpg]"

  body: "One of the classic \u2018openface\u2019 or \u2018handtooled\u2019 faces is
    Goudy Handtooled and this looks a lot like it except for the flourishes. I suspect
    it started life as one of the cuts of Goudy Handtooled and was then modified,
    which would account for some of the irregularity/roughness."
