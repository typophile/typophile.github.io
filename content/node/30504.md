  body: "Thanks so much, all! I'm not gone, I've just been buried under two theatre
    jobs. Plus I have an intern, so I can't surf at work as much as I used to -- gotta
    set a good(ish) example... Don't worry, I'm spreading the gospel of responsible
    typography out here!\r\n\r\nI miss you folks and am making sure to get to TypeCon
    this year."
