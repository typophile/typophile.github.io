  I think it quiet beautiful. Look at the \"R\" with the big head and small feet.
  Looking for something like that. I know a font named Gotham by Hoefler which got
  that kind of characteristic but its still far away from that handlettered font on
  the sign.\r\n\r\nThanks for help!\r\n"

    This sign was hand painted, not made with any font. So I regret we can''t offer
    you a match. If you''re interested in that ''R'' form in particular, have a look
    at <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/singles/mark_simonson/mostra_one_bold/?sample_text=SORTEZ&sample_size=74">Mostra</a>,
    though its alphabet is in a very different style overall.'

    could be a simular font in a digital version. If there is none, theres none. but
    if someone got an idea of a font with strong simularities, it would be nice to
    know.\r\n\r\nCheers \r\n\r\nRuwen"
