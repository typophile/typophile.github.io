  <BR>I just wanted to give a particularly notable update: the current issue of TYPO
  &#40;#8&#41; is one of the most valuable issues of any type magazine I&#39;ve seen.
  Eye should be envious. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>'

    one I missed in your earlier thread. Intelligent discussion like this is so difficult
    to find.

  body: Hrant, you might want to join the Typographic Circle, <a href="http://www.typocircle.co.uk"
    target="_blank">www.typocircle.co.uk</a>, You&#39;ll then get Circular, our magazine
    which we&#39;re trying to publish at least a year. The current issue has articles
    by House Ind, Richard Frick on Cuban posters, Andy Altman of Why Not Assoc and
    Robbie Sparks on 30 years of advert typography in London.  <BR>Not only are the
    articles high quality, but the design of the mag is plain drop dead georgous.

  body: I was just thinking about joining the Typo Circle, but I find it odd <BR>that
    the membership costs more for overseas applicants. Folks <BR>abroad should have
    a <i>discounted</i> rate as they are unable to <BR>attend local events, not <i>increased</i>.
    I understand the need to <BR>cover postage costs, but there is only one mailing
    per year, no? <BR>

  body: Bruno, I once got come back issues, and did enjoy both the content and presentation.
    <BR>&#40;Let me check the state of my wallet...&#41; <BR> <BR>BTW, the site says
    there are two issues per year, and you can buy an issue without becoming a member,
    for BP10 - is that where the BP20 comes from? <BR> <BR>Plus you get a free FontZone
    membership? Hmmm... <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>
