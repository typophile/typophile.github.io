  body: "Nice. Just two ideas:\r\n<li>If you're thinking about text composition as
    well as display, will the tails on the <strong>a</strong> and <strong>u</strong>
    be distracting in full paragraphs? They're the only decorative flourishes in an
    otherwise rather austere design, and they might create an inconsistency in spacing
    (<strong>gh</strong> will set closer than <strong>ah</strong>, <strong>nn</strong>
    will set closer than <strong>un</strong>).</li>\r\n<li>To my not-so-fresh-anymore
    eyes, the top and bottom of the bowl on <strong>b</strong> look thinner and more
    tapered than the corresponding strokes on <strong>g</strong>."

  body: Actually, the tails fill in pretty neat in small sizes, but I am considering
    leaving it on the <strong>u</strong>. Not sure about the <strong>a</strong>. It's
    a very important letter to me, also the notch and the tail is a signature result
    of the technique and tools (a flat nibbed pen ran twice, first vertically, then
    horisontally). I'll look into <strong>b/g</strong>.

  body: "Hrm, if you're going to use the flourish on the d and the a, I'd probably
    make the j and r also use it and possibly the f, or at least see how they'd look
    with it.  The r as it is now looks a bit clipped at the join compared to the m,
    n, and p, although all of them seem a bit slim.  The q on th eother hand looks
    great.\r\n\r\nMaybe for the a (before doing other changes mentioned above), if
    you move over the join for the tail a little to the bottom left and then pull
    down more for the curve on the bowl.  Right now, it feels like it's been pushed
    way over to the right.  Something more like this (I didn't touch the bowl in this):\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/untitled_sans_quickfixtest_a_4044.png]\r\n\r\n<em>\xABEl

    Thanks for commenting the <strong>a</strong>, Matt. I made it slightly less dramatic.
    It works better but still keeps it's spirit. "

  body: i'm only going to make one statement at this point and that is that your curves
    seem inconsistent. whereas the curve-to-straight portions of the h, m, n, u seem
    to have a certain speed and tension, the curves in a, e, o, s feel much more relaxed
    and easy. before going further, you should try to reconcile these two elements
    with each other. that is my own personal view.

    based on some sketches I did and the method described earlier. The curve-to-straight
    thing was in there right from the start and I'm not sure if I'm comfortable moving
    so far away from what I first intended."

  body: the curves seem to harmonize better now. the split stroke at the tail-join
    of the a is confusing to me-it doesn't seem to follow any of your usual typeface
    logic, but perhaps you meant it that way? in any case, the join would be improved
    if you moved it even slightly more towards the bowl of the a. the spine of the
    s is incredibly wonky, especially as it thins noticeably through the middle. the
    k feels static to me. most likely it's just the angles-they don't seem to jive
    quite right. i like the g, i might make the upper loop larger and the lower smaller,
    but that may just be my own personal taste.

    head, but decided to go with a smaller one. Just taste, I guess."

    in the upper case, it looks perhaps a little bland compared to quirkiness of the
    lower case. I wonder if the round shapes are a little anemic compared to the straight
    stems? It''s hard to tell from the parts-generated letters in the pdf, but I think
    there might be some weight-discrepancy all over. That might actually work on a
    face like this, but I''d look into it.  '

  body: "Is it just me (or my computer) or are some of the longer stems a good bit
    thicker than shorter stems?  Like the j and the alt-j, the straight one looks
    chunkier.  Maybe it's just my eyes plying tricks on me with the way the semi-serifs
    are placed in there making a sequence like \"un\" feel like the middle two stems
    have different widths at the top and bottom. Not necessarily a critique, just
    be aware.\r\n\r\nI echo Dan about the g, although I think it might have the same
    weight as most of the others, but the e and o and f to me seem a bit thin.  The
    R looks somewhat anemic, but what might work better is to lengthen out the P R
    E F characters, which have a lot smaller horizontal width, so maybe make them
    as wide as the V or N might help.\r\n\r\nAlso you P and R have quite distinct
    bowls on to, is this intentional or just testing two types?  If so the one you've
    got on the R is the one to go with.\r\n\r\n\r\n<em>\xABEl futuro es una l\xEDnea
