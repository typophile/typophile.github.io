  body: Elena, note that the OT size feature does not involve &#39;differents drawings
    for each size in a OT font&#39;. Rather, you make different fonts for each size,
    and put information in each font that specifies for what point size or range of
    point sizes it should be used.

  body: So you&#39;re saying that if somebody uses an Adobe OT font with different
    optical sizes, InDesign will automatically choose the correct size based on the
    point size? So is each discrete optical size defined to cover a certain point
    size range? <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>

    this is for activating MM optical instances. Never tried it. <BR> <BR>&#42;I was
    holding out for InDesign ME CS, but am now thinking I&#39;ll probably get both
    for testing purposes.

  body: Yes, that&#39;s exactly correct. <BR> <BR>This was a feature that was put
    into InDesign 1.0, before Adobe moved away from MMs. The feature has not &#40;yet&#41;
    been extended to apply to OpenType. <BR> <BR>T

    be <i>removed</i> from future versions of InDesign? Might it happen when support
    for OT optical instances gets <i>added</i>, or do you think it&#39;ll stay in
    there even then? <BR>2&#41; What does InDesign need to see to recognize an optical
    axis? Just see &#34;Optical&#34; as the name, or is there some encoding in the

  body: 1&#41; Hard to say. Perhaps it will get removed when or after Adobe completely
    drops support for multiple master fonts. No date has yet been announced for this.
    <BR> <BR>2&#41; MM axes have short names &#40;&#34;Op&#34;&#41; and long names
    &#34;Optical Size&#34;&#41;. Presumably InDesign is keying off one of these. Axes
    do not have any other kind of encoding AFAIK. <BR> <BR>Regards, <BR> <BR>T

  body: First, you should try to avoid having the fonts installed in two different
    places. It just causes confusion &#40;for apps as well as people trying to figure
    out your problem&#41;. <BR> <BR>Second, would I be correct in thinking that those
    are the only styles that show in other applications as well? <BR> <BR>My guess
    is that you are running Windows 2000 or XP. To get full MM support on those OSes,
    you have to install ATM. Unless you want to pay for ATM Deluxe, install ATM Light
    4.1, and the patch to 4.1.2. <BR> <BR>Alternatively, if you don&#39;t want to
    access the MM instances in apps other than Adobe&#39;s InDesign/Illustrator/Photoshop,
    just remove the fonts from the system fonts folder. Then the ones in the private
    Adobe location will get used, and you don&#39;t need the system level support.
