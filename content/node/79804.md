body: "i need to write a profile for a writing class, and i figured this would be
  a great opportunity to track down a sign painter.\r\n\r\ndoes anyone in the los
  angeles area know how i might get in touch with cosmo avila, the sign painter whose
  lettering inspired christian schwartz's font los feliz? should i just email mr.
  schwartz or whoever it was at los angeles magazine that found mr. avila?\r\n\r\nmy
  first draft is due on the 15th, so if i can't find him in time, do you know any
  other sign painters in LA?"
