  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>I sit here in front of my laptop on a cold winter night in Apopka (Orlando), Florida; writing my first blog entry. I wasn&rsquo;t sure what to write about or whether to specifically write about something font-related; so I have decided just to write something very general.</p>
<p>Since it is the start of the new year, I&rsquo;ll wish every one a Happy New Year 2010 and hope you get what you need this year - a new job (like me), love (like me), and continued faith (like me.) Notice I said, &lsquo;continued faith.&rsquo; Oh, yes; I believe. I believe in things yet unseen. Mainly because I feel it&rsquo;s the difference between remaining hopeful and not being hopeless. And maintaining sanity in a very insane world.</p>
<p>As I read different stuff online, I often say &lsquo;There but for the grace of God go I.&rsquo; There is much tragedy that occurs everyday. It helps me put in perspective what is truly devastating (the loss of a loved one) vs. what can be viewed as a phase that will pass (unemployment or financial challenges.)</p>
<p>I have gone through both and although I don&rsquo;t want to, will probably go through them again. Such is life. Enjoy the good times and persevere through the bad; and hopefully be able to tell which was which in due time.</p>
<p>In this spirit of thankfulness, I&rsquo;d like to list a few things I&rsquo;m grateful for:</p>
<ul>
<li>family and friends</li>
<li>faith</li>
<li>fontsturct</li>
<li>the ability to lose what at one time I thought was the best job ever and remain hopeful that a better one will come along in due time</li>
<li>the ability to make it through the ups and downs of each day</li>
<li>the ability to still love myself even though I continue to make choices that don&rsquo;t always work out for the best</li>
<li>the ability to forgive - myself and others</li>
<li>the ability to still believe in myself</li>
</ul>
<p>Maybe 2010 bring you some of the best that life has to offer. Peace.</p>
