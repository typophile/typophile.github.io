  body: "Which learning difficulties are we talking about here? Dyslexia or other?
    If dyslexia you should follow this thread: http://www.typophile.com/node/36906\r\n\r\nIn
    case of dyslexia I would not do so because of the way shapes and colour is perceived
    by a dyslexic. \r\n\r\nWhy do so in the first place? It reduces legibility and
    makes it harder even for those without difficulties."

  body: "I'm certainly no expert, but 'learning difficulties' is rather vague. We'd
    probably need to know more info as well...age target? Screen? Print? In what context?\r\n\r\nI
    think reversed type is useful on-screen. I wouldn't do it a lot on paper, but
    that's not based on any specific accessibility guideline that I'm aware of."
