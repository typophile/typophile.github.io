    who knows how to produce a good form. The census department pulled it off, maybe
    Obama should send those guys over to the IRS.

    set up a committee to crowd-source a blue ribbon panel to investigate the various
    issues, preparing a report that can be forwarded to the president outlining several
    options. \r\n"

    the announcement]] of the 1996 contract award to Two Twelve Associates. It was
    a sole-source award based on Two Twelve already having served as a consultant
    to the Bureau of Census, and that's supported by Harris' account of having approached
    the Bureau with her redesign ideas. So anyone who wants to work with the IRS (bring
    a long, long spoon) should start now before the IRS starts issuing sources-sought
    announcements and RFIs and whatnot.\r\n\r\nOf course, government proposals are
    my specialty, so if Typophile wants to form a consortium and go after the business....
