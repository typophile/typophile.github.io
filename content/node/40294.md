  indexes, pointers, hands, digits, etc):\r\nhttp://www.flickr.com/groups/manicule/\r\n\r\nMany
  of the submissions extend beyond the confines of typography, even into the third
  dimension, but I figured it might be of interest nonetheless.\r\n\r\nFor those of
  you with Flickr accounts, please feel free to add any images you might have!"
