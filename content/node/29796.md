  was the only piece of [[Kinneir]] and [[Calvert]]'s work on display in the <a href=\"http://www.designmuseum.org/exhibitions/current-exhibitions/designing-modern-britain\"
  target=\"new\">Designing Modern Britain</a> exhibitiom, and I think that changed
  on Sunday.\r\n\r\nThere was also a London Underground display with some some posters,
  an upholstery swatch and a repro  platform seat with integral enamelled roundel.
  And a small case with some [[Gill]] and [[Monotype]] material.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/web009_4720.jpg]\r\n\r\nThe
  <a href=\"http://www.designmuseum.org/exhibitions/current-exhibitions/alanfletcher\"
  target=\"new\">Alan Fletcher</a> exhibition downstairs was (to my mind, and my  wife
  agrees with me)  much  better.  Some pictures later."
