  designer but before i do i still need to get a few things in order, one of them
  is setting up my own website. I was wondering if maybe you guys could point me to
  some of the websites you think are very well executed and give a good straight forward
  overall view of the work and the designer.\r\n\r\nI'm not a web designer so i'm
  hoping some of your suggestion might lead to a few ideas on which direction i'd
  like to go with the website.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance !\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    mine: www.jltypographicdesign.com\r\n\r\nI did it in iWeb a couple of years ago.
    It's due for an update, which I'll be doing in Adobe Muse \u2014 a program I highly
    recommend for print designers who want an easy-to-understand, InDesign-like web
    design program."

    template site, specially for portfolio i. e. wordpress. Wordpress has so many
    free templates for portfolio makers.

  body: "Hello, Evie. \r\n\r\nAs Steve pointed out, go with something ready made.
    For example, Behance.com offers free usage of their website space to show off
    your portfolio. When you'll get more accustomed to web design, you can make your
    own from the very beginning.\r\nSome samples: \r\nhttp://www.iliasmeletis.net/\r\nhttp://www.hiromuradesign.com/#/vi/\r\nhttp://www.ferhatcelik.co.uk/\r\nhttp://www.redcreative.gr/en/work/\r\nhttp://www.mousegraphics.gr/\r\nhttp://www.clintonstringer.net/index.html.\r\n\r\nGood
