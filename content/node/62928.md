body: "Being just a student, I have been passionately checking out Typophile, without
  ever feeling comfortable enough to join the discussions by posting something of
  my own. I am looking for an advice from you guys because I have been learning from
  Typophile just as much /or even more/ than I have been learning in school. After
  days and days spent in the library and here trying to read and find everything I
  could about Trade Gothic Condensed- I still do not feel confident about using it
  for body copy. I like the way it looks, but does it work? There are not many books
  written on this particular typeface. \r\n\r\nThe project in question is my own branding
  identity. I am using letterspaced capitals of Trade Gothic Bold Condensed No.20
  in my logo. I was thinking about using Condensed No.18 with strong leading for body
  copy and Condensed No.20 for key points and prominent emphasis in all of my promotional
  materials. I personally like  the richness of simplicity, the contrast of these
  two achieved also by means of color  and noticeable difference in size. I like the
  idea of setting them  in such relationship to each other, but do you think this
  contrast works or would it be painful for the trained eye to read it? What is your
  opinion on tracking Condensed No. 18 in small sizes? Would it be stronger or work
  better just to use Trade Gothic Light for body copy? \r\n\r\nI decided to go with
  Trade Gothic in the first place because I personally think that it is a beautiful,
  simple, clear, strong typeface. I love to look at it (that also might have something
  to do with me being in love with the old jazz cover art);  it plays well with other
  faces. I need something simple, yet versatile for my Portfolio book. There is also
  a personal story behind this choice and that story dates back to my childhood. \r\n\r\nI
  found a topic here addressing combining Trade Gothic with a good, complimentary
  face, but I would rather stay within this family, than contrast Trade Gothic with
  a serif typeface.\r\n\r\nI look forward hearing from you all and I hope that someone
  will have an opinion about this...\r\nThanks a lot!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: I would say generally that it should be fine. Of course your point size, tracking,
    printing, design, etc. all affect the legibility. I would trust your eyes, and
    print proofs to check things along the way. Like you said it is a simple, clear,
    strong typeface. I think your instincts are good.
