  thought it was Berthold Antiqua. But the \"a\" doesn't look like. [[http://criacaocriativos.blogspot.com/2010/05/25-classic-fonts.html|Source]]\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Bodoni_5661.jpg]\r\n\r\n-----\r\nI
  have another question, not related to Bodoni: is there a way to subscribe to certain
  posts (or to all posts one has participated in), in such a way that every time there's
  an activity/reply to one's post or post one has replied in, an email notification
  be sent? Sorry, but I couldn't find anything in help, nor did I get any reply to
  my email sent to the webmaster. Thanks much in advance."
