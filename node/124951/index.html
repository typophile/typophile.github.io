  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Thanks for giving this thread a look.

So here is my difficulty, though I am somewhat familiar with graphics design programs like gimp, photoshop, inkscape, etc. I am having trouble converting my creations into a 10x10 pixel font file format.

I am completely new to this field.

I found this site http://www.pentacom.jp/pentacom/bitfontmaker2/

...which seems to have the basic design concept simplified enough, but it doesn't look like the end product will be monospace.

I tried using font forge and made some progress with it, but I don't understand most of it. It seems if I adjust the "bitmap strikes" whatever they are I can create something like what I am looking for, but I am still not sure how to make something of uniform width and height and the numbers I put in don't seem to match up or make sense to me. For example putting in 10 gives me a grid that is 8 tall and 10 wide? I don't quite understand. The terminus.fon file displays in the application I am using in a clean 16x8 pixels (or so the application claims), but loads on font forge on an 11x8 grid but set to 14 pixels in bitmap strikes? These numbers don't seem to add up.

If anyone knows of a way (preferably free) to create what I am trying to do, I would very much appreciate that information. Or if you can create a font file and post it that would generate a 10x10 pixel font, that would be even better! I am pretty desperate to put my designs into a usable format. My ocd can't stand rectangles over squares!

Thanks in advance!</div>

<img src="http://666kb.com/i/cy5gp8lf5j7l980b4.png" title="hosted by 666kb.com"/>

Fontforge gives the glyphs a height of 10px and a width of 10px. The height is divided into an upper part (which lies above the baseline) of 8px and a lower part (which lies below the baseline) of 2px. To change this ratio (800:200 by default), go to "Element" > "Font Info" > "General" and modify the "Ascender" and "Descender" values.

To change the width of the glyphs, select all glyphs in the overview window, go to "Metric" > "Set Width", and choose the width you want.  The font will be monospace if you simply make all glyphs the same width.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Thank you all so much for your help! The project I'm working on has moved forward by leaps and bounds with your help, but I've hit some more very frustrating snags...

It seems the last font I created/saved doesn't work at all and loaded as either some other default font or not at all. Something to do with it's size? I'm struggling to figure this stuff out.

I tried using Fontstruct and experienced some success, but by the time I had finished somehow the font was no longer 10x10. I think it was reading it as something much bigger that what it really was, possibly? So I am about to beat my head against a wall... I wish I could invite one of you to look over my shoulder while I did this... I'm going nuts!

This is the font I am trying to create... nothing special, just a dirty ascii font for my own purposes.... But I can't get it to work.

I am just venting at the moment. I've been working on this thing for 16 hours now...

Anyone know of a 10x10 font that I could use as a basis? Can post a link to an example 10x10 .fon or .ttf with the requested deminsions? It would be amazing! I've done some google searches but the fonts that come up for me don't seem usable or the right deminsions. Thanks in advance for any advice or support! It is much appreciated!</div>

What font format do you generate? With what operating system and program do you intend to use the font?

I am not sure about Windows and MacOS, but in Linux, the most convenient bitmap font format nowadays is TTF. Choose "File" > "Generate Fonts" to create the font file. Choose "No outline font" as the outline format and "(faked) MS bitmap only sfnt (ttf)" as the bitmap format. This will create a TTF file that has no outlines but has the bitmap glyphs included.
