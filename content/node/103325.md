    an older version (1994) by URW\r\n\r\n------------------\r\nI found it using \"Find

  body: "My 1983 Letraset catalogue tells me that Camellia was released in the Letragraphica
    range and is from 1972. Unlike as with most other typefaces, the catalogue does
    not list a designer for Camellia though. The design date at MyFonts do not seem
    to be quite accurate, it seems to tell us when Linotype included the typeface
    in their library rather than the year of first release. The Linotype website though
    credits Tony Wenman with the design and also lists 1972 as the year in which it
    was first released. \r\nCamellia does not have any capitals but it used to have
    condensed alternates for all lower case characters. Neither [[http://www.linotype.com/88760/Camellia-family.html|Linotype]]
    nor [[http://www.fonts4ever.com/product_info.php?products_id=888|fonts4ever\u2013Elsner
    + Flake]] seem to have digitized them. URW does not list Camellia (anymore)."
