  body: "Italics are tough to ID because sites often don't show them until you look
    at the family level. I have thought of making an italics Guide, but I am already
    overwhelmed with my existing Guides. I might be able to make an Italics key to
    use with the Serif Guide that already exists.\r\n\r\nI thought this Lady Gaga
    italic would be from a smaller foundry, and I checked Psy-Ops, but it wasn't one
    of theirs.\r\n\r\nAny other ideas? (probably should start a new thread.)\r\n-
    Mike Yanega"
