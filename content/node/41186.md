  know in previous school there was something told me about some designers who played
  with the postscript fonts. My tutor was talking about the fact that every letter
  changes, none was the same. I really can't find anything in the library and on the
  internet about the designers who have done this. Please can you help me?\r\n\r\nI'm
  currently doing my ISTD assingment and I'm looking at graffiti right now. (maybe
  any suggestions about that?)\r\n\r\nThank you all!\r\n\r\n(excuse me for my poor
  English, I'm actually Dutch) ;)\r\n\r\nThanks!"

    van Rossum and Erik van Blokland</a>. Beowolf is the typeface that had a randomizer
    built in.
