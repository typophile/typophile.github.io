  family.  I have a client I'd like to create a logo with it for... \r\n\r\nI love
  it and it fits their business perfectly,just curious about your thoughts on the
  font itself?  "

    in a logo is the gaps. If/when the logo is small enough they'll become noise -
    so might need to -carefully!- enlarge them.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    of B and left-hand R a bit problematic. Something not right to my eye."

  body: "Not use how recently it came out, I stumbled upon it searching for a look
    for this particular client.\r\n\r\nYes, I think the contours so make you think
    a bit, which can be good or bad - depending on who's doing the looking I suppose.
    \ \r\n\r\nBut I seriously have the hots for it and if the client doesn't go with
    it, I'll have to figure out some other way to use it.  "
