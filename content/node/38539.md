body: "Hello everybody, a couple of weeks ago I was chatting with <a href=\"http://www.tht.it/\">Claudio
  Piccinini</a> and he showed me a (working!) copy of [[FontStudio]], the mythical
  Letraset font editor from the early nineties. He was taking me through the features
  he used to love the most and at some point he showed me [[Automatic Text]], which
  was basically a generator of preview text sequences of characters, useful for checking
  and editing your font spacing/kerning. <!--break-->\r\n\r\nThis was the original
  window:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/automatic-original_5593.png]\r\n\r\nI
  then set out to reproduce the same behavior, which I found very useful, in FontLab
  Studio via Python. It took a while to find a way to write to the metrics window
  (FontLab\u2019s Python documentation is terrible) but eventually:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/automatic-text_4818.png]\r\n\r\nThis
  is the end result, using the command \u201CGenerate h beside all characters\u201D:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/automatic-text-result_3785.png]\r\n\r\nI
  think it\u2019s very useful, but I\u2019ll let you be the judge on that. \r\n\r\n<strong>Get
  Automatic Text:</strong> You can get the code, with installation instructions, over
  here: <a href=\"http://code.unicoders.org/hacks/trunk/automatic_text.py\">automatic_text.py</a>
  (or you can <a href=\"http://unicoders.org/code/hacks/trunk/automatic_text.py\">read
  the source code online</a>).\r\n\r\nComments and ideas are welcome. I developed
  and tested it on my copy of FontLab Studio 5.0.4 on Mac OS X 10.4.9, if anyone could
  test it under Windows that would be awesome. I couldn\u2019t find a way to produce
  radio buttons via the FontLab Python API, so I had to fake them with checkbox controls,
  which is suboptimal because it\u2019s not their default behavior. \r\n\r\n<strong>Known
  issues:</strong> \r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>At the moment you can only enter either glyphs
  in the range <code>[a-zA-Z0-9]</code> in the text boxes, or the glyph names with
  the <code>/name</code> notation;</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\nThat\u2019s it, I hope this
  helps people with their metrics/kerning development. Cheers."

    I can't seem to coax it into working properly under Windows (with FLS5). All it

    enough to puzzle out. Hope someone else has better luck and can prescribe a solution.

  body: "I worked around the first issue (the script was reordering your glyphs by
    Unicode name by default) by implementing an idea by Karsten Luecke: generate a
    temporary disposable copy of the font, sort <em>that</em> by Unicode name, and
    then delete it. This slows things down a bit, but it\u2019ll do for now. I\u2019m
    still curious as to why the glyph index is considered important, thought. As far
    as I know it\u2019s a record of the order in which glyphs were entered into the
    font, maybe people are using to keep track of something more interesting? Also,
    is there a better way to get all the glyph names in a font, sorted by Unicode
    name? Now that I think of it, I could avoid the issue altogether and just use
    the default index order, but it didn\u2019t seem significant enough to me.\r\n\r\nAnyway:
    thanks, Karsten!"

    were correct to suppose that the copy I'd snagged contained HTML code as well.
    I supposed much of that could have been commented out (or stripped out), but I
    didn't know what legitimate Python stuff might have been nearby and possibly whacked
    out by accident. (Someday I really have to read up on this stuff.) \r\n\r\nThanks
    for the follow up as this will clearly be a time saver. \r\n\r\nBest,\r\nErnie\r\n"

  body: "Thanks for the script. it looks really helpful. I will dive into it a bit
    more as I have to do the kerning for several fonts just now.\r\n\r\nTo answer
    your question why someone would care about the order of the glyphs (at least why
    I care): In Opentype fonts with hundreds of glyphs you need some order to find
    you way and to help the user to find the glyphs in the InDesign glyph pallet.\r\n\r\nand
    now I have a question myself: Why in the first place you need to order the glyphs?
    If you (like me) have you glyphs in a nice order (with the help of a custom encoding
    file) I would like to keep it like this.\r\n\r\nregards\r\nGeorg\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Hi Georg, thanks for the explanation, I hadn\u2019t paid attention to the
    InDesign glyph palette issue but it does sound like something significant for
    font developers. As for the glyph sorting, when I first developed the script I
    tested it with several of my (in progress) fonts, where the glyph index wasn\u2019t
    really significant. That meant that when I was generating the sequences they weren\u2019t
    making any sense. I could have sorted them alphabetically by glyph name, but that
    would have meant having more random sequences like having the infinity glyph near
    the lowercase i just because both started with the same letter. Sorting via the
    Unicode ordering seemed to make the most sense to me.\r\n\r\nDoes this explain
    the need for sorting or do people still think it would be best to leave the glyph
    order untouched? I can remove the sorting step if needed, but I would like to
    do it only if it\u2019s regarded as the best option by people who use the script."

    try to get the glyphname extension (for smallcaps and figures) from the font.
    I would try to test if \"a.sc\", \"asmall\", \"a.smcp\" are in the font. You there
    are no standards for naming glyphs so you have to support several.\r\n\r\nRegards\r\ng"

  body: "Having already used it (and it's great: thanks Antonio!), I try to answer
    Reetsde's remarks:\r\n\r\n1) You have not so much need for this, since as you
    select a glyph, when you open Automatic Text, the glyph name is already typed
    in the box. Additionally, you can just copy-paste the name of any glyph cell (so
    you can use the \"selected glyphs in font window\" feature).\r\n\r\n2-3) Same
    as above. Since we still have not a glyph naming convention being thorough and
    univocal, I think this would be more a hindrance than a useful feature.\r\n\r\n4)
    I leave this to Antonio's discretion, but I think it's not so essential."

  body: "Hello everyone. I worked a bit more on Automatic Text and on another script
    dealing with kerning stuff, and I have now changed idea regarding the sorting
    of glyphs. Yeah, at first it might be unexpected to have glyphs in random order
    when generated by Automatic Text, but fixing it just means putting order in your
    \u201Cmessy\u201D glyph index, which sounds like a good thing to me. So, in order
    to encourage people (and I\u2019ll put myself first) to actually organize their
    glyphs in a sensible manner, I think Automatic Text shouldn\u2019t do any re-ordering
    for you, which is what it will do starting from version 0.3 which should be out
    in a few days.\r\n\r\nGeorg: regarding your requests about having more ranges
    available, I understand they\u2019ll be helpful but I fear having too many options
    might make the dialog window more messy than it already is. As Claudio suggested,
    a good ordering of your glyph index plus the \u201Cgenerate behind selected glyphs
    in font window\u201D should help you with accented letters, punctuation and figures.
    For small caps I have another script in the pipeline which basicaly converts all
    the caps in the current metrics window with their small caps counterpart.\r\n\r\nI
    also fixed the issue with being able to only enter glyphs in the <code>[a-zA-Z0-9]</code>
    range in Automatic Text, but before releasing it I\u2019d like to make up my mind
    about a dependency issue I just introduced. Stay tuned."

  body: "Hey Josh: I started coding in Python because I was sick of using PHP for
    my Web development work, then I started using it for general automation. I was
    delighted to find out it was the de-facto standard in the tyographic world. Python
    per se is not hard at all to learn (it\u2019s a pleasure compared to other languages),
    but you might find it easier if you already know concepts of generic programming.
    In any case, Python is considered very good even as a first programming language,
    so don\u2019t be scared. There are some good, free guides on the Web about programming,
    and some use Python as the teaching language like <cite><a href=\"http://www.ibiblio.org/obp/thinkCSpy/\">How
    to Think Like a Computer Scientist</a></cite>. \r\n\r\nMost of all, what helped
    me while I was beginning (and still helps me, since I can\u2019t really consider
    myself as a great programmer) is reading other people\u2019s source code, figuring
    out why it worked and why it was written in a certain way. Then I could modify
    it for my needs and maybe add some of my own ideas. After that you gain confidence
    because you already know how to solve a certain set of problems, and then you
    can move on to more interesting ones. My advice is to pick a project that would
    be helpful to you right now, like building a photo gallery for your Web site,
    and automate its production. Sure, you\u2019ll hit roadblocks along the way like
    \u201Chow do I install new libraries?\u201D \u201Cwhere do I find the libraries
    I need?\u201D \u201Chow do I get a list of file names from a directory?\u201D,
    but all these will be chances to dig deeper and learn more."
