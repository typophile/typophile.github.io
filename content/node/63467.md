  fonts.\r\n\r\nI read that Avant Garde Gothic was inspired by Bauhaus design ( http://www.adobe.com/type/browser/html/readmes/ITCAvantGardeStdReadMe.html
  ).\r\n\r\nI would appreciate it if someone can provide images to show similar font
  design from 1920's-1940's.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance,\r\n\r\nAkira Takiguchi  akira.takiguchi

  body: 'Oldnick, I don''t know the story, but I don''t think that''s quite right.
    Twentieth Century is indeed a Futura knock-off or adaptation, but Avant Garde
    is to me quite different in feel. It is generally wider, has much shorter ascenders,
    and has the distinctive very wide CG and ce --which to me are hideous, but that''s
    beside the point. '

    remember seeing lettering on a poster (for skiing?) from around the same period
    that looked similarly like a precursor to Avant Garde."

  body: "Thank you very much for comments.  Heller's articles mentioned by David are
    titled aggressive and I would love to obtain a copy (if possible).\r\n\r\n\"Herbert
    Bayer\" looks visually an ancestor of \"ITC Bauhaus\".\r\n\r\nMy cause for the
    question is the image below, which I suspect is a postwar faked stamp on a military
    jacket.\r\n\r\n[[http://www.history.jp/images/gebpolrgt18.jpg]]\r\n\r\nLooks similar
    to Avant Garde but certainly \"R\" and \"1\" is different.  Thus the query.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: "<em>@William Berkson:</em>\r\n\r\nTwentieth Century is a precursor to Avant
    Garde because, unlike Futura, it is a monoline face. Avant Garde, likewise, is
    monoline, but renders all of the letters in pure geometric shapes. The larger
    x-height and shorter descenders was an ITC trend in many of their revivals."

  body: "Jackson: I think it is actually a book cover.\r\n\r\nNick: Are you sure about
    that? To quote Mac McGrew (referring to the metal version): \"Twentieth Century
    is Monotype's copy of Futura, and in display sizes is essentially an exact copy,
    while composition sized are only slightly modified.\" If you showed both faces
    side by side with no labels, I doubt if anyone could tell which was which. The
    only obvious difference I can see are the quote marks. I could accept Vogue, which
    is more geometric and monoline than either Futura or Twentieth Century, as a more
    likely influence on Avant Garde."

  body: "The Bauhaus-guys were really into using \u2018building blocks\u2019, which
    accounts for the geometric look of a lot of their products. Historically the use
    of geometric forms goes back to the days of Albrecht D\xFCrer, but in the case
    of sans serif more specifically to the golden age of lithography (the latter half
    of the 19th century). \r\n\r\nLithographic artists used books with samples of
    lettering where the more modern forms of lettering (sans) were often based upon
    geometric forms. A later pendant for this are the guides for painters (meant are
    house painters who often doubled as sign painters) who were also trained in painting
    letterforms starting out with geometric forms. I have seen samples in the historic
    village of Enkhuizen in the NL. And there are also sample books in the same lieu
    for stone masons, architects and so on. \r\n\r\n. . . .\r\nBert Vanderveen BNO"
