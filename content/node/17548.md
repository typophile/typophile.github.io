  (Central-eastern Europe).\r\nI am working on a logotype (more type less logo :)
  for a consulting company. They are selling a portal engine named \"Celerus\". The
  Corporate font for all the printed stuff is Rotis Semi-serif, so I must use it also
  in this case.\r\n\r\nI designed a few special characters for this project instead
  of using the originals. \r\nThis is an early stage of design (the \"n\" is still
  without serif)\r\nPlease if U grlz&guys got time, take a look at my work!\r\nMudan[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Celerus.jpg]"

  body: "While I'm not clear why you have to use the corporate font to create the
    logo your present special characters do relieve some of the predictability of
    Rotis, however the L and R look a little light, especially with the Es, an answer
    to that might be to work on the serifs of the E, especially on the crossbar. You
    have kerning issues throughout, but must finish the character development before
    you can adjust them.\r\nTim"

    body: "Dear Tim! \r\n\r\nThanx for the comment.\r\nI have to use Rotis because
      the company sells different softwares, and in all of the different products
      they use Rotis. I also think it fits to the product so I'm not gonna change
      it.\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: "What Tim is saying makes sense. If all of the packaging using Rotis it might
    be more interesting to use a different typeface which contrastst with the it.
    If anything, Rotis is a display font. For me anyway. I think the fact that you
    did draw some unique letters helps. If you would have used the type out of the
    can it wouldn't be enough to differentiate it.\r\n\r\nThe N seems a little naked
    compared to the other characters that all have at least one semi-serif. \r\n"

    body: "Miss Tiffany!\r\n\r\nI agree, \"n\" is naked. That is a mistake. I'm working
      on it right now. I have to modify a bit. In this phase there is no place for
      a serif. I have to check the lower case for an example.\r\n\r\nWhat about an
      \"E\" like this? It is a bit lighter... It differentiate the logo more, but
      still Rotis. (I'm not allowed to change the basic type)[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Celerus02.png]"

  body: About 3 weeks ago when this first posted I thought I would try to help out
    with a few letter tweaks, I wish I had posted earlier but I had wanted to finesse
    them a bit. Well I have just been too busy to pursue this so it was parked. If
    this is still of interest and perhaps any help here was the work (in progress).
