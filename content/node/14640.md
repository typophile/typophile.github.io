  \"organic\" jewelry for people with Large gauge holes in their ears.\r\n\r\nI know
  it still needs work, and I always enjoy reading your critiques so I figured it was
  time to throw one of mine out there.\r\n\r\nThank you."

  body: "Hey Forrest,\r\n\r\nI am sorry to say that it doesn't work for me. The type
    is somewhere near okay (the lowercase e looks smallish, though), but the twig
    just doesn't have the right feel. Too literal, in my opinion.\r\n\r\nI think the
    rather straight shape of the words collides with the loose treatment of the twig.
    The two should be a unity.\r\n\r\nThe twig refers to the organic, but I think
    some reference to jewelry might be better.\r\n\r\nKeep up the good work! \r\n\r\n----------------------------------------------------\r\nMy
    work is a game. A very serious game [M.C. Escher]"

  body: A few points one loose the twig as Bart suggests. The G has the shape of an
    ear with an ear ring hanging from it already. Maybe slighly modifing that shape
    will make it clearer what you are making. Over all the letter and word spacing
    needs major work. Start with one word get the spacing working then use that word
    as your benchmark for the other two. Good start keep going.
