body: How is it that 100 years later, News Gothic is still as fresh as it ever was.
  It&#39;s quite possibly the best workhorse sans ever. &#40;No really.&#41; Lots
  of people have digitized it &#40;Linotype, URW, Elsner &amp; Flake, Adobe, Bitstream
  -- the latter being my usual fallback&#41;. <BR> <BR>So, now <a href="http://www.fontbureau.com">The
  Font Bureau</a> offers the latest addition, <a href="http://www.fontbureau.com">Benton
  Sans</a>. With 21 weights and styles it could be everything I ever wanted from News
  Gothic. <BR> <BR>According to the FB site, Cyrus Highsmith collaborated with The
  Font Bureau designers in the production and the project was originally started by
  Tobias Frere-Jones in 1995.  <BR> <BR>I haven&#39;t gotten my hands on it enough
  to know firsthand, but I wonder how much of the design is true to to the News Gothic
  I&#39;ve grown to love and how much of it is an interpretation of Benton&#39;s other
  sketches and/or work. <BR> <BR>Are you as anxious as I am to test out this face?
  Will this do to News Gothic what FF DIN did to reg&#39;ler DIN? Or what Helvetica
  Neue did to Helvetica olde.

  body: Aww, you usurped the discussion at my place, meanie! It was <BR>inadvertent,
    I&#39;m sure. And I&#39;ve swiped from Typophile plenty. <BR>So never mind. <BR>
    <BR>I think Benton Sans &#40;or Gothic as it was called in the previous <BR>FB
    catalogs&#41; has done well as a magazine face simply  <BR>because it offered
    more cuts. Mags require a lot of styles. <BR>I&#39;m not sure I see enough of
    a difference from the onscreen <BR>previews to determine whether the design itself
    is reason <BR>for picking it over News Gothic. I think it&#39;s merely the new
    flexibility. <BR> <BR>I&#39;ll print the PDF soon to have a closer look. They
    really need <BR>to offer a text sampling PDF too.

    in the back of my mind that I should post stuff quickly, without looking over
    my shoulder at Typographi.ca or MS Typography or Speak Up for that matter. =&#41;

  body: 'Stephen -- <BR> <BR>It&#39;s not quite precise to say that Benton Sans was
    previously called Benton Gothic, as the two remain slightly different families.
    Benton Gothic was the original family of styles developed for various corporate
    customers, under Frere-Jones&#39;s guidance.  <BR> <BR>The design family was reworked
    under Cyrus&#39;s direction for retail release. As you might imagine, when a series
    is developed piece-meal for a variety of clients, each with particular needs,
    the family may develop some idiosyncracies and inconsistencies across the spectrum.
    So &#40;I was told&#41; the FB team wanted to harmonize the family and revise
    it slightly for this release -- hence the new name. <BR> <BR>You&#39;ll notice
    that the range of weights and styles is slightly different between the two. The
    earlier Benton Gothic has seven weights from Thin to Black and only two widths.
    Benton Sans has eight weights from Thin to Black and four widths. So right away,
    things will be different. <BR> <BR>At a more subtle level, there are small differences
    that, to my eye, betray the Highsmith touch. Here is one of the more obvious examples,
    Benton Gothic Black Condensed and Benton Sans Black Condensed: <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/4100/22743.gif"
    alt="Benton &#39;a&#39; comparison"> <BR> <BR>The differences lie mostly in the
    curves of the &#34;shoulder&#34; and &#34;belly&#34;. Subtle; but to me, I can
    just see the two designers, clear as day -- Tobias on the left, Cyrus on the right.
    It just jumped out at me when I first looked at the new release specimen. <BR>
    <BR>Joe -- <BR> <BR>If I recall correctly, Tobias spent a bit of time looking
    at a whole bunch of Benton&#39;s original work at the Smithsonian -- not just
    News Gothic, but Franklin Gothic and all the others as well. As a result, the
    Benton Gothic family was not meant so much as a reinterpretation of News Gothic
    specifically, so much as a sort of &#34;Benton gestalt&#34;. <BR> <BR>-- K. <BR>

  body: Kent, thanks for the great insights. Funny how something so subtle can be
    so striking when your eye is tuned to see it. Also, thanks for the images. &#40;You
    posted what I couldn&#39;t.&#41; Also, you&#39;ve confirmed my suspicion about
    News Gothic versus a broader interpretation of Benton&#39;s body of work... &#40;Who
    among us now will be the subject of future designers&#39; tinkering.&#41; <BR>
    <BR>Can I trouble you for a posting of the roman/regular weight of each. &#40;Hamburgevons
    or handgloves or whatever.&#41; &#40;Pretty please with a tilde on top?&#41; <BR>
    <BR>Oh, and Stephen, of course not. =&#41;

    Heidelberg Gothic italic is a strange hybrid. Erik Spiekermann was art directing
    the project as part of his overall design for Heidelberg Drucksmachinen. My initial
    italic was a bit more &#39;normal&#39; -- e.g. fully cursive e -- but Erik wanted
    it more idiosyncratic. One of the nice things about this project is that the typeface
    is <i>always</i> incredibly well printed <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"

  body: Joseph -- <BR> <BR>I don&#39;t actually have access to the fonts themselves,
    so I can&#39;t provide your request. I grabbed those images from the PDFs. I see
    that the Benton Gothic web page is no longer found through the FB front door.
    But it seems the PDF is still hiding on the server. So, you can still grab the
    Benton Gothic PDF for yourself <a href="http://www.fontbureau.com/images/specimen/pdf/BentonGothic.pdf"
    target="_blank"> here</a> and compare for yourself.  <BR> <BR>-- Kent. <BR>
