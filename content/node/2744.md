body: I&#39;m making a transition from web design into print &#40;and am having a
  great time doing it!!&#41;.  But I&#39;m wondering, does anyone know of a forum
  where I can talk technical details. <BR> <BR>I have questions ranging from pre-press
  &#40;which I know is a big can of worms&#41; to layout / grid systems &#40;which
  I know is a bigger can of worms&#41;. <BR> <BR>Can anyone point me to any good online
  resources?  Or can we start a discussion here? <BR> <BR>Nathan

  body: I&#39;m sure some of the Typophile people wouldn&#39;t mind helping you out,
    even though the main focus of the forum is typography. <BR>You could also try
    <a href="http://www.yayhooray.com" target="_blank">YayHooray</a>.

  body: Changing from Web to Print. Yippie, the tide is turning. I always found webcoding
    boring as hell and am SO happy to have a partner who is ace at doing Flash/ActionScript
    stuff, so I can concentrate on working on PAPER. I&#39;m getting old, must be
    why I LOVE the web but dislike progging. Maybe I&#39;m just too intuitive and
    impulsive for that, all my codes were always buggy as hell :-&#41;.  <BR>If you
    have any questions, I&#39;m sure folks here can help you out. As typography is
    still more a print thingie, many here will know how to get a decent PDF done and
    grid and layout IS typography, so... it is even ontopic :-&#41;

  body: I too am in the process of doing the web-to-print transition. It&#39;s been
    good so far, reading up a lot. <BR>YayHooray is a nice resource if you can filter
    out the pointless bickering and trolling.

  body: Currently, I find myself printing out a bunch of drafts on my inkjet just
    to check type sizing, etc.  Type looks so different when printed vs when it&#39;s
    one screen.  The size and weight always throw me. <BR> <BR>I need to get confident
    about selection there. <BR> <BR>HD, you mentioned PDF.  Is that the prefered way
    to hand off to a printer.  Not sure about Quark, but InDesign has a nice packaging
    feaure that lets you export all the images, settings, fonts, etc.  Very handy.
    <BR> <BR>Also, my existing issue has to do with margins.  I&#39;m doing a brochure
    piece that has a contemporary design style &#40;you know, a 1/4&#34; white margin
    that frames moody background photos&#41;.  Anyway, it appears fine in InDesign,
    but when I print, my margins seem off?  Looks like I have everything set correctly.  Can
    I post the file here for someone to take a look? <BR> <BR>If so, what format?  PDF
    or the actual InDesign file?
