body: "hi guys,\r\n\r\nI just joined this forum and I am very interested to learn
  more about typography.\r\nFYI, I was a student in graphic design program but I dropped
  out after my first year because I just  don't have enough money to continue so,
  while I am trying to save the money, I was thinking to keep on practice because
  I am still not very clear when to stop or dram the line what is good enough. \r\n\r\nI
  have few books about typography from my class textbook \r\nThe Elements of Typographic
  Style by Robert Bringhurst\r\nThinking with Type by Ellen Lupton\r\nTypography Workbook:
  A Real-World Guide to Using Type in Graphic Design by Timothy Samara\r\nThe Ten
  Commandments of Typography by Paul Felton and Jonathan Barnbrook\r\n\r\nbut I need
  to say that I am not very book person :(  \r\n\r\nI am just wondering what is the
  best practice for me to do it daily?\r\nI am more than willing to make a commitment
  to my self to sit for 2-3 hours every single day and only to play around with typography
  (I have two jobs).  \r\n\r\nFor my future goal, I just want to work around typography,
  publication,web/motion and branding. My current goal is want to have a better handle
  of kerning, spacing, and choosing the right combination of font type for poster
  design. \r\nPlus, I want to learn how I can create my own type face. \r\n\r\nI was
  thinking to took some words from magazine articles/lyrics, type it manually, and
  play around so, I can have better handle at spacing and kerning but I dunno. \r\n\r\nby
  the way, is they any some kind of online courses (small budget) for typography?\r\n\r\nthanks
  guys\r\n\r\n"

    and few people visit here. You are not being ignored, but just not seen.\r\n\r\nI
    would post your questions in the main forum, where they will get more attention."
