  on 'type in motion'.\r\n\r\nSince I have not specific experience in this field I
  can only comment about general aspects.\r\n\r\nHowever, I would like to know if
  people here could recommend good bibliography about the subject.\r\n\r\nThe thesis
  aims to the history and changes happened in animated typography during the XX century.\r\n\r\nThanks
  in advance.\r\n\r\nR."

    Is this the sort of stuff you are looking for?"

    graduation thesis) related to 'type in motion', etc.\r\nI know there is the 'Type
    in motion' serie (http://www.typeinmotion.com/), but beside of that... any advice?\r\nR."

    I also think it had a great influence on the sci-fi user interfaces of many popular

    \ &\r\nMotion Graphic Design: Applied History and Aesthetics\r\n\r\n\r\nMotion
    graphics design as a whole doesn't delve into type motion specifically. The same
    key techniques used in creating the aesthetics of any object in motion is applied
    to text, as single objects. There should be a sub discipline dedicated to type
    in motion, but the readability of the text is left to the judgment of the designer.
    It can't be too fast, too blurry, or too small. But those rules depend on the
    context of the project. There are a few specific books out there, but they just
    reiterate motion design principles and not specifically outline special techniques
    for text. "
