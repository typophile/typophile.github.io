body: Hi, <BR> <BR>Ive created an eps but everytime I try to print it the page comes
  out with crazy code along the top. Ive printed other pages which come out fine.
  Ive also created other eps&#39;s all of which dont print but give me a few lines
  of crazy type. <BR> <BR>Any ideas why this is happening? <BR>It has now started
  up beside me and is printing the same pages with type over and over, a poltergeist
  perhaps, any explanations? <BR> <BR>thank you in advance, <BR>David.

  body: Do you have a PostScript RIP?  Even a software RIP? Most Epson&#39;s need
    help when it comes to EPS files.  A software RIP is a couple of hundred dollars.  In
    the meantime, open your EPS in PhotoShop and save ait as natve Photoshop.  This
    should print fine.

  body: We have an Epson 3000 that sometimes starts to do this ... I&#39;m sure it
    isn&#39;t random ... but it always seems random to me. I can send ascii and binary,
    ascii just goes slower. When it happens to us the prefs from the software rip
    are deleted and it goes away.
