  finding a similar font? [img:sites/default/files/old-images/3688ab49ce4acd821ce932f7ac1d3a709232563c_m_5677.jpg]

  body: "Middleton designed a slab serif called Karnak Obelisk which had the rounded
    A and M. Some versions of Memphis also had the rounded A, but I did not see the
    M. An Intertype version of Memphis called Cairo, did have a rounded M.\r\n\r\nI'm
    not sure of any digital font that's too similar except [[http://www.fonthaus.com/products/fonts/view.cfm/sku/AP10103|Keynote]],
    which has alternates that are rounded.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
