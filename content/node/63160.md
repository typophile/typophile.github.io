  I figured someone could point me to a decent resource on an overview of the major
  web development programming languages that are used today, and situations you might
  need each one. \r\n\r\nDoes a resource like this exist? Book, webpage, whatever.\r\n\r\nThanks
  to everyone in advance.\r\n\r\nAdam"

    markup.  So I guess you should go to pyton.org , java.com , or php.net (though
    php technically are not programming). webdeveloperplus.com, dev-tips.com, and
    devsnippets.com also a great place to visit for mid~advance coders.\r\n"
