  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>I am basically a self-taught graphic designer (okay a few classes, but mostly reading lots of books), who only works for non-profs (aka no budget). I never charge for my work, including all costs associated with my work. I get lots of compliments and work hard to make my work look like it isn&rsquo;t done for free (which has only been accomplished because of the help I&rsquo;ve received from the people at this site). And this leads me to my point&hellip;</p>
<p>Many <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->THANKS<!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --> to all those who over the years have helped answer my type id questions and evaluate my designs. I will never be able to afford all the gorgeous fonts I&rsquo;d love to have, but so appreciate all the hard work that goes into them. But because of the efforts of the people here, I&rsquo;m able to quickly fix problems and identify fonts and only purchase the ones I really need.</p>
<p>Through this site, I&rsquo;ve learned to admire font design as the fine art it truly is. And I really respect those of you that have responded to my ignorant questions with reponses that didn&rsquo;t make me feel so stupid after all.</p>
<p>So from someone who was forced to become a graphic designer (I was the only one who could figure out how to use ALDUS pagemaker at the time) and has truly become obsessed with design work&hellip;</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->A pat on the back and kudos to all at this site! You guys are awesome!</p>
