  I was under another name&#41;. In the process of thinking about going in another
  direction with my identity &#40;but really don&#39;t want to&#41; and was wondering
  if anyone would be so kind as to critique this logo. I would definitely appreciate
  it. <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/67667.gif" alt="Logo

  body: Hi James. BJ has a good point, who are you trying to reach. folks in technology
    who needs branding and annual reports, club owners who need flyers, galleries,
    ? <BR>Well lets move on and assume you know what market it is for. What about
    the mark as a visual element. <BR>I suggest you balance it more. Top logo is best
    in my opinion, but it needs more balance. If you are familiar with kerning and
    spacing, it is important that things look balanced. This can only partailly be
    done by measuring distance. Think of this in terms of volume and not only distance.
    The side of the G looks like it lines up with the edge of the M if you were to
    draw a straight line, however since the G has curves and is not straight like
    the M there needs to be adjustments made. You have made this more difficult be
    boxing all elements in a grey box. Well I have made a mock-up to get you started
    in the right direction. <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/67705.jpg"

  body: Well &#34;mode&#34; is kind of my own shortening of the word &#34;modern&#34;;
    as for the period, it&#39;s an representation for the slogan I had recently added
    &#34;It always has been about the art...period.&#34; <BR> <BR>Also I&#39;m really
    not trying to reach a certain market, I&#39;m just a graphic designer &amp; I
    take all clients. Hope this helps.

- body: If it&#39;s for &#34;period&#34;, some other color than red. Perhaps white,
    and still keep MODE in red.

  body: '&#34;Mode&#34; means &#34;fashion&#34; in Danish, and I think it is the same
    for French language. As you are not a fashion designer perhaps it is a bit confusing.
    If you like to use something that sounds like &#34;Mode&#34;, and is similar in
    meaning, perhaps consider shortening it to &#34;Mod&#34;.  <BR>You are not trying
    to reach any specific market- I understand your point that you would just like
    to get work and it is not important if it is from corporate clients, a .com, a
    restaurant, ? Still consider that certain places have more or less of certain
    demographics. Consider how many senior citizens, immigrants, white, black, educated,
    blue collar, white collar, small business, chains, etc...... and if you like to
    work for everyone, well target to largest demographic in your area. <BR>btw. I
    am not sure why it was suggested you change dot from red to another color. I do
    not see a problem with it being red.'

- body: It reads first as a dot, and so I wouldn&#39;t have a problem with red. But
    if you are going to combine it with a tagline that tells you it&#39;s a period,
    then it just reminds me of the kotex/playtex &#40;whoever&#41; commercials with
    the red period...and not just the typographical one. Sorry for the reference!
    But better the issue comes up now than later.

  body: Have you considered using &#39;design&#39; or &#39;graphic design&#39; instead
    of &#39;graphics&#39;?

  body: Brian. Point taken &#40;in your counter-critique&#41;. Perhaps the size is
    part of the problem and not just the color-not sure. <BR>Darrel has a good point
    about using the word &#34;graphics&#34;. It has association to desktop publishing
    vs. &#34;design&#34; or &#34;graphic design&#34; which brings to mind a more skilled
    and qualified professional sounding person. Then again perhaps if James does not
    want the more difficult clients that demand more processes and comps to please,
    perhaps the word &#34;graphics&#34; is ideal. As James mentioned he did not want
    to target specific industries- ironically the process of elimination &#40;by choosing
    to use wording such as &#34;graphics&#34; vs. &#34;design&#34;&#41; has already
    begun. Just to clarify- I do not think there is anything wrong with desktop publishing-
    client expectation is lower, so it the pay, but the volume make up for it.

  body: Finally made it back here. Thanks for pointing out these things. But I have
    for a long time often comtemplated the word &#34;Mode&#34; in question and I&#39;m
    very aware of it&#39;s two meanings. It also serves as a synonym for &#34;method&#34;.
    Well, since &#34;method&#34; didn&#39;t quite sound appealing for a name, I chose
    &#34;mode&#34;. <BR> <BR>Also changing &#34;mode&#34; to &#34;mod&#34; and &#34;graphics&#34;
    to &#34;graphic design&#34; sounds like a plan, I&#39;ll be trying out some roughs
    for it later on.

    GOD FORBID if I should do the &#34;Spike Lee&#34; thing with that Mo&#39; Design.
    I think I&#39;ll stick to the original path I said on the last post and see what
    comes up.
