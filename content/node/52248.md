  frequently on type design and signage, with a mix of user science. Most importantly,
  I'll be using this blog so that I won't forget to work on my typefaces, which I
  really need for my portfolio. I need ten works, with at least two hand-drawn or
  hand-painted among the bunch. I don't know how to paint, nor do I know how to draw
  skillfully with the pen (or pencil).\r\n\r\nI need the portfolio so that I may apply
  for the Information Design major in our university. Right now, I am taking up Computer
  Science. So if I get accepted, I will be taking two majors at the same time.\r\n\r\nWish
  me luck, random reader."
