body: "Hi all.\r\nUnfortunately I only have one low-resolution sample of the font
  I'm trying to identify, and that sample contains a slightly modified letter. Thus
  I have a feeling that this will be a challenge. Here it is:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Logo-main_5065.png]\r\n\r\nThe
  letter 's' is modified a bit, I don't have the original. The word written is 'Veiskille',
  in case it was unclear.\r\n\r\nAs far as I know it was found on the web some time
  around 2000. Not much help there, I guess.\r\n\r\nAny help would be appreciated.\r\n\r\nAll
  the best,\r\nKristian"
