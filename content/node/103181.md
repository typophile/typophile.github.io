  others and no luck...\r\n\r\nWhat I am told by the person's whose image this is,
  is that it was created for him about 9-12 years ago... \r\n\r\n[this might help
  as it means the font has been around a while] and that he does not have the original
  font name or file.\r\n\r\nSo, before having to force him to 'picking a new font',
  I figured I'd give this a shot...\r\n\r\nThank you for your help oh masters of fonts!\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\nE."

    some other fiddling would be required also. obviously.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/snap_5305.png]"
