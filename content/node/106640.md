  noticed this rounded geometric sans in a Behance gallery. Single-story \"a\" and
  \"g\", with unusual slab and monospace-like \"i\" and \"l\".\r\nThere are three
  more posters using it here: [[http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/123834672/max_h-1000+max_w-1000/01.jpg|1]]
  [[http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/123834687/max_h-1000+max_w-1000/01.jpg|2]]
  [[http://images.cdn.bigcartel.com/bigcartel/product_images/123834705/max_h-1000+max_w-1000/01.jpg|3]],
  where you can find other critical letters such as \"y\", \"M\", \"J\" etc.\r\n\r\nAny
  ideas?"
