  to use with Delicious? This is for a course catalog, so trying to generate excitement
  from college freshmen and appeal to their parents at the same time. :) \r\n\r\nI
  read about Delicious here, in an article for beginning book designers:\r\nhttp://tianobookdesign.com/blog/?cat=5\r\n\r\nCould
  Delicious be used with Gentium? I also have access to Sabon, Minion, and other typefaces
  available through Mac OS and CS5. I would really love to learn more about type -
  this is my first post here. Please let me know if more details would be helpful.
  Thank you very much!"
