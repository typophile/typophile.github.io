    errors in them too so I'm wondering how relevant/critical these errors are? I
    understand the script was made for Adobe, so not all of the checks are relevant
    to others.\r\n\r\n_____________________\r\n<a href=\"http://www.dinariraqi.com/\">Iraqi

    upgraded from AFDKO 2.0, and I'm wondering if I've done something wrong. The old
    Autohint macro was still in the macros folder and now that doesn't work either.
    I've deleted all the old macros and reinstalled just the new ones but still getting
    the same message. Anyone else struggling?"

    body: "I see that you have installed the new FDK scripts for FontLab macro's,
      and I assume that you also updated the shared script files under Macros/System/Modules
      - in any case, if you used the script 'FDK/Tools/FontLab/installFontLabMacros.py'
      the installation will be correct.  In this case, I do not know of a reason to
      have the problem you report. Would you be willing to  post your vfb file for
      me to look at? You could perhaps make a small subset font to make it easier
      to send. If so,  send me a zip file at rroberts@adobe.com. Please rename the
      extension to 'adobe' - that helps avoid problems with the firewall.\r\n\r\nAlso,
      what version of Python  of FontLab, and which OS ( Mac or Windows) are you using?
      \r\n\r\n- Thanks,  Read\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Hi Read,\r\nI don't think it is a problem with the vfb file, as I've tried
    it on other fonts (including Adobe Source Sans) and had the same results. I thought
    there might have been a problem with the way I installed the FDK folder. Initially
    I just deleted the old one and pasted in the new one then ran the installFontLabMacros.py
    script to save the macros into [C:\\Users\\DavidRowland\\Documents\\FontLab\\Studio5\\Macros].
    I've tried again by restoring the old FDK folder and pasting the new one into
    the same place to merge the two (I also deleted all AFDKO files from the [C:\\Users\\DavidRowland\\Documents\\FontLab\\Studio5\\Macros]
    folder. I then ran the installFontLabMacros.py script again and started Fontlab.
    The old autohint script (in outlines folder) now works again, but the new one
    (hinting folder) still gives the <cite>Hinting F. Skipping glyph F. Failure in
    processing outline data</cite> message.\r\nI'm running Fontlab 5.0.4 with Python
    2.4 on Windows 7 PC.\r\nI also tried running the FinishInstallWindows.cmd script
    in case that was part of the problem, and got the following message:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/cmd_5775.JPG]\r\nMy
    account type is administrator so I'm at a loss as to why this would be the case.
    Even so, I tried the <cite>Type \"autohint -h\" (no quotes) and hit \"Return\".
    This should give you the Help information about the Autohint tool.</cite> step
    from the installation instructions. I got the autohint help but also this message
    flashed up:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/autohinterror_4019.JPG]\r\nDoes
    any of this information help at all?\r\nAt least I have the old FDK working again,
    so if you can't solve the problem, please don't worry about it.\r\nCheers,\r\nDave"

  body: "I can't be sure that missing the 'MSVCR100.dll' is the only problem, but
    it is a sufficient problem. The issue is that the FDK is compiled with an older
    version of the Microsoft compiler tools, in order to be compatible with Windows
    XP.  Windows 7 no longer includes this library.   I thought I had solved this,
    by compiling this library into the autohint program, but this is obviously not
    the case. You can work around this by downloading the file, and copying it to:\r\nC:/Windows/system32/\r\n\r\nYou
    can just google \"MSVCR100.dll download\"\r\nbut it can certainly be downloaded
    from:\r\nhttp://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=5555\r\nPlease
    download and install this file, and then let me know if you still have a problem\r\n\r\n"
