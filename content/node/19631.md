  type with serif/san serif identity issues.  Please let me know what you think.  It
  is definitely a work in progress so I am open to all input on revisions.\r\n\r\nThanks!"

  body: It is a display typeface for a graduate level typography class assignment.  No
    purpose as of yet.  It was inspired by an eroded typeface at a cemetary, thus
    the disconnected elements.
