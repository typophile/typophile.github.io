  very helpful and I'd appreciate one more question:\r\n\r\nThis time, I'm trying
  to find a font that looks similar to the twix font[img:sites/default/files/old-images/twix.jpg]\r\n\r\nI'm
  sure the logo itself was done as an in-house custom job, but if anyone could recommend
  a font that looks similar, I would definitely appreciate it.  I've been searching
  online for quite some time and haven't come across anything yet.\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n-Brian"

  body: Its only four characters, I bet its custom. Maybe someone has made a free
    font based on it. Try the free font sites and some elbow grease. If you only need
    four characters you might consider drawing it yourself. Just some thoughts.
