<div class="post-content e-content" itemprop=articleBody>Friends,
Hello! I'm the managing director of a small non-profit arts organization that performs, teaches, and hosts dance and movement events. We're the only modern dance studio in Indiana, where there is a small (at best) dance community. Although we've been around for 28 years, we are frequently being compared to the local ballet school; a more classical dance and has been around for 50 years.
A few years ago, (before I worked here) the organization got a grant to improve its corporate branding. They bought a font (DaVinci) and created a logo (attached).
I came along, with a minimal graphic design background, and I don't like the logo. It seemed to open, to unsubstantial. So I modified it, inversed the color, and set it inside a circle (also attached.)
The 30th anniversary is coming up soon, and I'd really like to present them with a modified, better logo that isn't drastically different that what is here. I'd like it to show a sense of movement, of flow. I'd like it to be free-form without being wacky and all over the place. Basically, I want to keep a sense of modern dance within the logo, but I want something that will still look smart on a letterhead.
I would love any advice you have to offer that might lead me on the right path. Thank you very much!</div>

<div class=commentbody>The line quality is rough/autotrace looking, and you have too many ideas. The spirals and chicklets are not helping.
A good test for a mark is to reduce it to around 1/4" in height and fax it and see if it still reads. I would simplify the ideas and look to available type that is going to be more legible.
Maybe you don't even need the two figures. Maybe type only, or just a gesture that says movement. Maybe that gesture could be part of the type.</div>

<div class=commentbody>I think the font does a fine job of communicating movement on its own -- you might want to think of perhaps tinkering a bit with one or two letters to emphasize that idea.
But the logo itself is just too confusing.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Thanks for the comments! I've been toying with the idea of just getting rid of the logo itself, but I don't know if the artistic director would be down for that. Do you think it would be improved by removing the little spirals and the little confetti-looking marks?</div>

<div class=commentbody>Hi Andrew.
Maybe you should zoom into the figures and take a part of a body that keeps the essence/movement [moving hand/torso/muscle structure...], or take a piece of clothing they could be wearing [twisted shirt/tie/a dress suggesting the movement of the body underneeth...] Something that has a place in the imege already but could be isolated and refined, croped in and made more powerful. [?]
Maybe take a photo of two people performing this movement and take a detail and work with it... you could even have an evolving mark that zooms closer and ends up with an abstract shape [body part/clothing/hair...] that conveys the same message as this one does holistically.
I find that a photograph or something tangible is a good starting point when designing anything, even type. Then you can usually give it a physical quality: weight, texture, movement. Then a simple shape can be attributed to a space or material or somehow suggest a material quality, be it finely chipped out of steel [Walbaum] or set in huge concrete blocks [Akzidenz Grotesk figures]. Or something like the Johnnie Walker logo.

<div class=commentbody>I'm not sure this script is quite right and a lone dancer doesn't really suggest a collective, but anyways...

Edit: I missed the obvious in the one above.

<div class=commentbody>I quite like the original figures. Try removing the swirls and 'confetti' as it doesn't say anything IMO. As for the typeface try to find something dynamic and better crafted like <a href=http://www.sudtipos.com/fonts/4>Alma</a> or <a href=http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/underware/auto-2/italic>Auto</a>.

<div class=commentbody>I like the feel of single dancer. I think you should create the two dancers in that style. The way they are now, it's pretty rough. I like the smooth style of the single dancer.</div>
