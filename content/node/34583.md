    CFF', and I imagine that a lot of people will be. \r\n\r\nI know there are companies
    whose business it is to film conference presentations and sell DVDs afterwards.
    <a href=\"http://www.iplayback.com/category/8\">Here is one</a>. Of course this
    is not a large conference, so I don't know whether it is worth their while. \r\n\r\nThe
    more technical programs would perhaps be more commercially worth filming, as these
    are more 'need to have' information that you can't get elsewhere, except at other
    conferences. I imagine a fair number of those who come to look at Typophile--and
    there are evidently thousands--would buy such DVD's. Maybe even some of the companies
    whom the speakers represent would be willing to fund these up front, as they would
    promote their products. "

    cams. The regular type must be getting cheaper & cheaper. We could just turn them
    on, point them & let them run. It wouldn't be 'perfect' but it might be waaaaay
    better than nothing. The main issue would probably be sound actually. What does
    JP think?

    that someone with more time shooting with a video camera might be able to do more
    or get better picture quality than I might. And, it might be a good idea to find
    a way of getting sound out out of JP's massive sound rig. It might also be a good
    ideas to get some ambient sound as well and maybe mix them 70-30% or something.

    great unless there is a person there at all times.\r\n\r\nWe have a ton of footage
    from 2004 and 2005 - raw, unedited, and needing loving hands to shape it into
    something digestible. JP can plug into her system for audio, but we can't add
    more to her already full plate. To document properly really requires a separate
    set of dedicated volunteers who won't be dragged away into other areas.\r\n\r\nAnyone

    alone see. I would be willing to do some editing tweaking etc to be able to catch
    that stuff. I was thinking that while the footage/quality might not be 100% compelling,
    if the topic/presenter/etc is exciting to you you might be willing to watch/listen
    all the same. I know I would. Also, if it wasn't a big DVD of stuff but was just
    a series of podcast sized audio and or video ( small & digestable ) that might
    be VERY sweet for some of us. \r\n\r\nAs an experiment maybe I could take for
    instance; the Cyrus Highsmith media to see what it's like to do, how long it takes,
    etc. And to check to see what people think of different approaches. I could try
    out making a audio podcast, a video podcast, and if we have a way to access the
    slides other than video - maybe a PDF with embedded sound? Or a video podcast
    with sound & the slides as stills?\r\n\r\nThere would be a question about how
    to get it hosted too maybe...\r\n\r\nSomewhat related: Will Typeradio be showing

    beginners. He is super knowledgeable about Fontographer and FontLab, and can answer
