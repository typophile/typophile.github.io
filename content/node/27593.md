    little Comma. Unfortunately being the world's most contented cat is no defence

  body: "Sorry for hijacking the thread. Of course I blame planet_embroidery for starting
    the cat comments ;-)\r\n\r\nI've been trying to work out the nine lives of Comma,
    which I guess he didn't (she didn't, it didn't) have after all. I get <em>Period</em>,
    <em>Comma</em>, <em>Semi-colon</em>, <em>Colon</em>, <em>Ellipsis</em>... then
    maybe <em>Exclamation Point</em>, <em>Question Mark</em>, <em>Interrobang</em>,
    and then what?.. that's only eight lives[img:sites/default/files/old-images/]"

    - I'm exclusively a cat-person, so I've never had to think about a good name for
    a dog. Comma was almost called 'Mrs Eaves', which I think would be a great name
    for a cat, but as he was a boy that whole 'Mrs' bit just didn't sit right.\r\n\r\nKen
    - I definitely think that 'Period' would have to be the final life, although as
    he was an Australian cat, it'd really have to be 'full stop'. :-) Oh, and I think
    a hypen would round out your punctuation set nicely."
