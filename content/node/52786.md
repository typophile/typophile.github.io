  the files with Postscript 1 fonts for Mac. Since more people will be working with
  similar files PC workers included i persuade my client that will all user Open Type
  Fonts to avoid Cross Platform issues.\r\n\r\nMy questions is:\r\n\r\n1 - The fonts
  for this design are very common: Helvetica Neue, Adobe Garamond, Zap Dingbats (for
  bullets). Can i just replace an Helvetica Neue Postcript for and Helvetica Neue
  with OTF without having any noticeable change in the design? I don\xB4t know maybe
  older Postscript Helveticas Neue to the more modern OTF version has some difference
  somewhere i cannot appreciate, letter X height or else. I just would not like my
  60 pages design to move text frames when changing fonts.\r\n\r\n2 - I am checking
  Font Folio 11 (OTF) and there is Adobe Garamond Pro (or Garamond 3 LT Std or Garamond
  Premier Pro), not just plain Garamond. Is there any difference at all with its Postscript
  1 version for Mac? \r\n\r\n3 - I cannot find Zap Dingbats in Font Folio 11, but
  ITC Zapf Dingbats Std. Is the same? \r\n\r\nSorry for the long text. Thanks for
  any info!\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\nSebastian\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    <em>I just would not like my 60 pages design to move text frames when changing
    fonts.</em>\r\n\r\nYou should be able to switch from the Type 1 version of the
    fonts to the OpenType version with very little or no reflow at all. If some glyph
    metrics were changed during the conversion to OpenType, it was because the metrics
    in the Type 1 were considered a bug.\r\n\r\n> <em>Adobe Garamond Pro (or Garamond
    3 LT Std or Garamond Premier Pro)</em>\r\n\r\nThe only thing guaranteed these
    three families have in common is the name \"Garamond\". They are different families
    and are NOT interchangeable. They share the stylistic design and that's about
    it. They have many differences in terms of design, metrics, weights, styles, character
    coverage, OpenType features, etc.\r\n\r\n\"Adobe Garamond Pro\" is the OpenType
    counterpart of Type 1 \"Adobe Garamond\".\r\n\"Garamond 3 LT Std\" is the OpenType
    equivalent of Type 1 \"Garamond Three\" (a.k.a. \"Garamond 3\")\r\n\"Garamond
    Premier Pro\" only ever existed in OpenType format.\r\n\r\n> <em>not just plain
    Garamond</em>\r\n\r\nThere are many [[Garamond]] \"cuts\". If \"Garamond\" is
    the only name that appears on the application's fonts menu, perhaps you're using
    the [[http://www.microsoft.com/typography/fonts/family.aspx?FID=28|Monotype version]].\r\n\r\n>
    <em>I cannot find Zap Dingbats in Font Folio 11, but ITC Zapf Dingbats Std. Is
    the same?</em>\r\n\r\nThe Type 1 version was named \"ITC Zapf Dingbats\". \"Zapf
    Dingbats\" is probably the TrueType version that comes installed on Windows(?).
    There's no guarantee that the TrueType version be equivalent to the Type 1 or
    OpenType versions, but they should be similar for the most part."

  body: "BTW, the PC Type 1 fonts (<code>.pfb</code> and <code>.pfm</code> files)
    can be used in Adobe applications running both on Mac OS X and Windows. \r\n\r\nOn
    Mac OS X, the system won't let you install PC Type 1 fonts. \r\n\r\nHowever, if
    you put the <code>.pfb</code> and <code>.pfm</code> files into one of the following
    folders: <code>/Library/Application Support/Adobe/Fonts/</code> or <code>~/Library/Application
    Support/Adobe/Fonts/</code> (where ~ is your user folder) then the fonts will
    be visible in all Adobe Creative Suite applications (but they will not work in
    non-Adobe applications such as TextEdit, Apple Keynote or Microsoft Word). \r\n\r\nOn
    Windows, you can install the fonts on your system as you normally would. Alternatively,
    you can put them into the <code>C:\\Program Files\\Common Files\\Adobe\\Fonts</code>
    folder. This way, they will be only available in Adobe applications but not the
    other Windows applications. \r\n\r\nBy putting these fonts into the folder <code>/Applications/Adobe
    InDesign CS3/Fonts/</code> on Mac or <code>C:\\Program Files\\Adobe\\InDesign
    CS3\\Fonts</code> (or appropriate, depending on your InDesign version), you will
    make the fonts available only within InDesign but not other applications. \r\n\r\nThe
    Adobe-specific font folders on both Mac and Windows accept OpenType and TrueType
    fonts (<code>.otf</code> or <code>.ttf</code>) and PC Type 1 fonts (<code>.pfb</code>
    and <code>.pfm</code>), On Mac, they also accept Mac Type 1 font suitcases. \r\n\r\nAlso
    note that rather than copying files into those locations, you can put shortcuts/aliases
    that point to font files or even entire folder trees. The last possibility is
    particularly attractive. \r\n\r\nFor example, I often keep copies of the fonts
    that I used in a certain project in a specialized folder for that project, along
    with the actual project documents and assets. To open the project, I quickly drag
    the shortcut/alias for the project fonts folder into the Adobe-specific font folder,
    and the fonts are instantly installed within InDesign, Illustrator and Photoshop.
    I can quickly drag the folder shortcut/alias for an entire folder tree that holds
    several hundred fonts into the Adobe-specific folder, and I don't have to bother
    activating all those fonts in my font management app. This is very quick and does
    not clutter the font menu in the other applications. \r\n\r\nSometimes it helps
    me to get a somewhat \"dodgy\" font to work. Even if it does not work in the system,
    it may work just in InDesign, where I often need it. \r\n\r\nSo: the Adobe-specific
    font folders are a useful alternative to system font installation, allow use of
    folder shortcuts pointing to entire folder trees, and allow using PC Type 1 fonts
    on Mac OS X. \r\n\r\nA."
