  I had sketched it some months ago, but only started recently. <BR>I would like to
  have some good crits, please. Spacing an weight balancing is off right now. I only
  have the glyphs in Freehand. I would like to get the basic perfect before I go on
  with the rest. <BR> <BR>It has to be a font the works very well in small sizes.
  I will not make a big family out of it, just the regular bold and black. Caps and
  numbers are not available yet. They will be made upon this basic look-and-feel.

    I will try that and make an update later. <BR> <BR>&#62; &#40;Ole, you&#39;re
    really taking critiquing seriously! Cool.&#41; I like that too. Keep &#39;m coming,
    Ole. I think you&#39;re right. I had it in my head but was not sure. With you
    saying that makes me sure that I have to change it. The first reaction is always
    the most important. <BR> <BR>&#62; the x-height is way too small; But that will
    change if I make the ascenders and descenders smaller. Like Ole also suggested,
    it will then have less negative space. <BR> <BR>&#62; and the weight is too light.
    Too light? Are you sure? I printed it many times in different sizes and it seems
    to be OK. How much darker does it have to be than? Is there something like a golden
    rule that I can follow? Do you have maybe a reference font that I can check up
    on? <BR> <BR>I&#39;m personally not so sure about the &#39;s&#39;. Do you see
    a problem there? Another thought is that I would like to make the bowls of the
    &#39;d, p&#39; g, q&#39; a bit more round so that the little serifs more distinct
    &#40;if that makes any sence&#41;. Or would you leave that like it is? <BR> <BR>Thanx, '

    UC accents. Otherwise once you figure out the modulation issue you&#39;ll have

    Now, if you&#39;re still going for small sizes, that&#39;s fine, in fact your
    vertical proportions are much better now for that; but the color will be too light

  body: I like this typeface. But you really should make another one as well keeping
    the funky modulation intact. It is cool. <BR> <BR>Hrant, I think the monogram
    is supposed to be GB as in Gabrielle Birnstein, the lucky reciever of the typeface.
    Am I right Ren

  body: Hi guys, <BR> <BR>magnus, that&#39;s absolutely correct with the monogram.  <BR>
    <BR>hhp, what and where do some of the characters look mechanically inclined?
    Just to get a good feeling for what I should look out for. <BR>With my italic
    I just, like you could see, mechanincally inclined it. I &#39;italized&#39; it
    here and there to get the typical italic look and feel. But in fact it is not
    a real italic.  <BR>Therefor the width is still the same. My spacing is a bit
    more tight than the Regular, but I can change that back.  <BR> <BR>I think you&#39;re
    right with the ampersand. I&#39;ll change it. What about keeping it in the italic?
    Would that work? <BR> <BR>This are the original sketches with the funky modulated
    typeface. I will start on that this weekend and keep you updated. I&#39;m looking
    for a good name for it, so if someone has some good ideas... <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/53063.jpg"

  body: 'Hi Randy, <BR> <BR>Welcome back. :-&#41; And thanks for the nice compliment.
    Coming from you I think that means something. <BR> <BR>Yes, it came right after
    Nordic. I guess you can see my handwriting. Could you recognize it as my font,
    not knowing that it came from me? <BR> <BR>About the funky version, I will finish
    it based on the sketches. I won&#39;t overwork Insider to push the modulation
    back in. This font will mainly work onscreen and needs no funky modulations; it&#39;s
    a working horse. Insider became more round over the time and the funky one needs
    a bit more tight curves. You can see that clearly on the sketches.  <BR> <BR>I&#39;m
    really looking forward for working on the funky font. I&#39;ve overcome my frustration
    and feel that I&#39;m up to the challenge now. <BR>The glyphs that frustrated
    me most are: b, e, s &#40;although I now kinda like it with the funky curves in&#41;.
    <BR> <BR>hhp, what&#39;s going on in your head? :-&#41; I don&#39;t see it beeing
    the name for the font, but perhaps the sample book that I will make for it. It&#39;s
    a great theme where I see some interesting images. <BR> <BR>Later, <BR>'

    <BR> <BR>For he who cares, this is an update of Insider. I&#39;ve done some heavy
    curvecontrol and mucho kerning. I&#39;m almost ready with both fonts as singles.
    I want to crosscheck them because I have the feeling there are some inconsistencies
    &#40;width, accents, spacing&#41;. <BR> <BR>Some minor things I will finish later:
    change ampersand in the Roman, change oe and ae in Italic, check numbers in Italic
    &#40;I have the feeling spacing could be improved&#41; and implement your crits
    ;-&#41; <BR> <BR>I want to start working on the InsiderBlack Roman and Italic.
    Then I will interpolate the Bold. I will also make the Regular a bit more heavy,
    it&#39;s a bit to light now. <BR> <BR>Later, <BR>'
