  body: Play with the &#39;TT&#39; joint. Right now, it&#39;s an awkward smashing
    of two words into one. The box with bars is fine, but you need to align it with
    something &#40;most likely the baseline of your type&#41;.

    a face, and then start playing with the &#39;TT&#39; junction. Or perhaps apply

  body: The bars don&#39;t really look like bar charts to me. I&#39;d show a variety
    of heights of 3 bars to give the appearance of a bar chart. The minimum number
    of repeating elements required to establish a pattern is 3. <BR> <BR>I also agree
    with what others have said concerning the &#39;TT&#39; and the box alignment.
    The Ts should either join purposefully, or contrast &#40;separate&#41; purposefully.
    The way it is now complicates the visual parsing of the words a bit, and therefore
    the name. <BR> <BR>Also, doesn&#39;t red have a negative market connotation?

  body: Much thanks for the feedback Chris.  It was decided just recently not to use
    the bars at all. &#34;Charts&#34; are trite and over-used. To imply a &#34;chart&#34;
    without actually using the bar elements is good enough and maintains the austere,
    staid feel I am after.  So the icon will be just the bold square.  <BR> <BR>Not
    sure what others have said regarding the box alignment. I missed that.  I am playing
    with the TT juncture as well. Any suggestions there -- i.e., should I play with
    kerning to get the TT&#39;s to join?  I am using futura bold. My second choice
    would be to use contrasting colors.  thanks so much for the feedback.

  body: Bob -- I think you may have a comprehension problem with the type by setting
    it all in caps. It&#39;s much more difficult to read than caps and l.c. If you
    run charttricks together, why not capitalize the words if the client will allow
    it, as in ChartTricks. The subhead runs too wide in measure for all caps to be
    readable. As for the icon, use something that is recognizable like the no parking
    slash in a circle.

  body: 'I am not a professional, so I can only give you the innocent eye test ...
    The difference in colour within CHARTTRICKS makes this less uncomfortable, but
    I&#39;m afraid, for me, this is not working. It looks not so much austere as dull.
    The problems I think I have are: <BR> <BR>1. The box has no significance. With
    those heavy lines it does not conjure up an image of a chart, for instance. It&#39;s
    just a box. If it reminds me of anything it is a ballot paper. <BR> <BR>2. There&#39;s
    no tension: it&#39;s a series of blocks: a blocky box, and a rectangle of blocky
    capitals. It&#39;s neat, but it is the regimented neatness of the suburban lawn.
    Whether it be a contrast of type, or of line length, or of position, or of colour,
    some sort of injection of life is needed. &#40;The first version actually had
    more tension.&#41; <BR> <BR>3. The bold box and the bold type all make it rather
    heavy. Is this necessary. Heavy typography is the typography of shouting. Is that
    what you want? Lighter weight caps might have more elegance and subtlety, and
    perhaps be more &#34;austere&#34;. <BR> <BR>I&#39;d say: Don&#39;t be bullied
    by the client. If he knew how to design this, he&#39;d do it himself. Perhaps
    you need to start with something outlandishly odd and then move it towards respectability,
    rather than the other way round. Show him what he really wants, not what he thinks
    he wants.'

  body: The typeface chosen is to condensed in relationship the the square beside

    regular kerning. <BR> <BR>Or another possiblilty would be to combine the T&#39;s
    into 1 and make the new letter half grey and half blue. The transition of grey
    to blue could conceptually relate to the idea of trading. <BR> <BR>The box tells
    me nothing about trading, In fact if anything it tells me not to trade and be
