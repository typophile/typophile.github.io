    you are all new to this buying stuff 'thing' and wondering: 'Shag Lounge' is a

    been there last friday. :)</em>"

  body: "Ooohkay, Sadly enough you didnt 'get' it. Not in the sense of actually getting
    the font, but in the sense of understanding how all this works, or should work.
    There is no legal FREE copy / version / whatever of that typeface. Got it?\r\n\r\nWant
    it? Buy it!\r\n\r\n<em>( Maybe someone else will write some more about this. I
    wont. Its too hot for this.\r\nJust a few more things: I dont think any fellow
    Typophile will send you the typeface. Neither do I think that anyone will send
    you a link to illegally download a bootlegged copy of it. Thats it. For now. )</em>\r\n\r\n<a

  body: "<cite>please i still need that font SHAG LOUNGE</cite>\r\n\r\nThis is definitely
    the wrong forum to ask for free copies of commercial fonts. If you want Shag Lounge,
    follow the link Dav mentions. Alternatively, you might try -- for example -- <a
    href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/category/myfonts/index.html\">www.myfonts.com</a>
    and follow the link to category \"funny\". With some luck you find something similar
    at a lower price?\r\n\r\nKarsten"

  body: "\r\nNew to typophile.com, but certainly not new to the biz.\r\n\r\nSometimes
    young guys don't know the ropes and don't realize there is an easy way to get
    the font you need for a client. Usually all you have to do is ask. Compared to
    the overall cost (not just what they're paying you -- if they're paying) and the
    projected returns, a font like Shag is well worth the $$ investment. Show your
    client the font, explain how you'd use it, and present them with the cost. It's
    just like stock photography\u2026 And every young designer should learn to work
    WITH their clients.\r\n"

  body: "Dan,\r\n\r\nSadly I wish it were that simple. My clients (publishing companies)
    are pretty tight fisted when it comes to buying fonts. As a result I tend only
    to buy them when I know I am going to have a lot of uses for them. It means I
    end up going with the reliable workhorses and not having a lot of \"flings\",
    at least not on my clients's dime."

  body: "Yes, fresh fonts are often seen as a designer's indulgence.\r\nAnd that may
    be true.\r\nThe way to find out is to present comps set in a choice of either
    an Adobe/Apple/Microsoft bundled font that's free and everyone has, or something
    special that will have to be bought. If it really does make a difference that
    the client can appreciate, then the outlay should be no problem.\r\nYou can certainly
    do comps for web work, which is low resolution, using screen-grabs from type-testers
    such as Veer's Flont. But unfortunately for Seb, House industries don't do that
    feature... no doubt to disable unscrupulous designers from using screen-grabs
    for finished art.\r\n"
