  body: "This is perhaps lettering which is not matched by a specific digital font.
    \r\n\r\nA good approximation is to be found in Salvo Sans\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/SalvoSansAsULTIMATE_4149.gif][img:sites/default/files/old-images/SalvoSansAsWARRIOR_3949.gif]\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/fontbureau/salvo-sans/\r\n\r\nDon"

  body: Based mostly on |R|, and the relatively narrow |T|, it reminds me of Avant
    Garde Gothic (Medium, plus some distortion due to metal embossing).

  body: "Based on the _R_ and narrow _T_, I would agree that Avant Garde Gothic Medium
    is closer [img:sites/default/files/old-images/AvantGardeMedAsULTIMATE_4655.gif][img:sites/default/files/old-images/AvantGardeMedAsWARRIOR_4384.gif]\r\nThe
    \ _U_ and _A_ are too narrow.\r\nSo, no exact match, but this is the best substitute
    so far.\r\nDon"

  body: "I suspect it\u2019s Interstate by looking at the slightly square /O and the
    relatively short, sharply straight /R leg. The same thing can be said of Alright
    Sans. I suspect this is a micro-genre now (A larger aperture of /R, which is balanced
    not by a long leg but a short, but bolder straight leg)"
