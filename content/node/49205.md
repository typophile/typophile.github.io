body: "I'm crazy about the proprietary font that Typophage made for Lancome. Obviously
  I can't buy their font, since it's not for sale. Does anyone have ideas for another?
  I tried Civility, and it won't work for my project. Basically, I want the script
  to be huge and light on the page. \r\n\r\nhttp://www.typophage.com/fontes-exclusives/lancome.html\r\n\r\n<img
