  body: "I definitely appreciate the help. I love this face.\r\nAfter doing a little
    comparisons on the links you gave me, I think it's the Elsner+Flake version of
    ITC Modern No 216, which seems a little lighter:\r\nhttp://new.myfonts.com/fonts/ef/itc-modern-no-216/modern-no-216-ef-light/waterfall.html\r\nThanks
    much."
