  body: "I don't know how new this is but there was a time when plotters were used
    to either cut vinyl or spray paint signs.  They uses a very crude spline method
    to accomodate the machinery (rounding errors in scaling occurred as well) and
    improve speed.  The weight and angles were not precise by typograhers standards
    but most people never gave it a thought.  The image is not big enough to tell
    but there may be excess gaps or traps in the crotches of the w showing crude enlargement.
    \ Or, it just might \"sign guy\" and his personal handywork.\r\n\r\nChrisL"
