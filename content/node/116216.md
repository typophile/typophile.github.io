  entitled to give this to your attention:</cite>\r\n\r\nWe're pleased to bring to
  your attention our research symposium: <strong>\u201DMaking Traces. A multidisciplinary
  approach to graphic trace making\u201D</strong> to be held at the University of
  Southern Denmark, Odense, on November 19th to 21st 2014, in the hope that you would
  like to attend.\r\n \r\nThe symposium has a multidisciplinary agenda, seeking to
  place the study of graphic traces close to the core of contemporary humanities,
  and to link it to studies of communication, culture and cognition.  More specifically,
  it aims to study (i) the processes of making and perceiving graphic traces, (ii)
  the graphic traces themselves (as texts) and (iii) the relationship between articulatory
  dynamics, gesture and traces. It brings together scientists, scholars and practitioners
  from a number of fields, including social anthropology, social semiotics, eco-social
  semiotics, cognitive neuroscience, typography and calligraphy, in a shared effort
  to understand the profound impact graphic traces have on large-scale human cultural
  patterns as well as on individual scale cognition.\r\n \r\nPlease visit the [[http://www.sdu.dk/en/Om_SDU/Institutter_centre/C_CMC/Forskning/Symp_MakingTraces|symposium\u2019s
  website]] for further information and registration. Please feel free to forward
  this information to anyone you think might be interested. We hope to welcome you
  in Odense, Denmark, in November.\r\n____\r\n"
