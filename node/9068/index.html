  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Hello Typophiles, <BR> <BR>I am working on an identity for my old client, now the employer. Actually, it is a very little bit of re-design, and mostly working out a set of routines and documents for office use - with renewed CI. <BR> <BR>(Set up) <BR>As the correspondence is mostly being sent per email, there is no real need for the letterhead being offset-printed (First, I was against it, totally. But then, if you think about it, it makes sense - why have a stock of 1000 sheets of paper without any good use?). <BR> <BR>(Issue) <BR>Anyway, I am now trying to make &quot;a form&quot;, be it a Word or a Acrobat document or anything other format, with letter-head embedded, where a colleague of mine could type his or her letter. So now I am struggling with the following problem: <BR>- I cannot embed Type1 fonts into Word-documents and I don't have and cannot make Windows convert my Type1 font to TrueType, which is what Word could have possibly embedded; <BR>- if I use Acrobat and make a form there, it wouldn't add a page automatically, so it'S always a one-pager (plus, it has printed the footer as if it was a blurred image, though it was just a font). <BR> <BR>(Additional) <BR>I have Adobe CS coming my way, with Acrobat 6 (I think) packed inside. For a 5 people office it should be ok to install it, if we need it (I asked the shop, they said - oh, sure). <BR>We have MS Office. <BR>The fonts are all Type1 (ttf versions would cost us the same price again - thank you FontFont). WinXP says it cannot convert Type 1 font as the copyright forbids to do so (thank you FontFont again). <BR>I have ATM DeLuxe installed. <BR>I have no font editor installed and am not going to have one. :/ <BR> <BR>What would you recommend? <BR> <BR>I know, this sounds like, &quot;oh, I am so dumb and poor and lazy&quot;, but I am trying out everything, what I can - and stuck pretty much on the same place&hellip; :/</div>

		<div class="commentbody">One thought that may or may not apply here. In a time where everyone uses email, recieving a nice printed piece of paper with the company identity in offset or even letterpress with some communication on it can stand out quite nicely. <BR> <BR>So, from a marketing standpoint printed letterhead could serve a purpose. <BR> <BR>Sorry, I do not have an answer to your question, but I thought I would at least share a little. <BR> <BR>Good luck with your project. <BR> <BR>Mike</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Would this work? &ndash; <BR> <BR>Make the typesetting and the logo one single file created in Illustrator, with &quot;convert to outlines&quot; applied to the type. Then place it in your letterhead document. <BR> <BR>If you're working in Word, this will also give you nicely fitted type, which you wouldn't otherwise get, as Word doesn't support the kerning in a font.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Mike, <BR>I agree with you and that was also my point (or rather, I would consider it as being a good point, as I was trying to persuade the then-client with traditional arguments), but as I see what kind of correspondence comes and goes here, there is no need for perinted matter, and the guys want to have everything done in 2 minutes. Sending a letter with a snail-mail would cost them time and money (time would be the 1st reason at all). :/ <BR> <BR>Nick, <BR>I've made them a letterhead a year or so before, embedded it into Word file and they were using it as a template for all their writing. Now, as I am working with them, I try to set things nice and clear. Franklin Gothic was used as a corporate font and they even succeded in using it consequently throughout the correspondence (which made me glad and proud of them). One could even embed it, if he wanted. Now I am trying out a new font, FF Kievit, which I have only as a Type1. Word still seems a good - or rather the only possible - way to go, but I cannot embed the font into the document. :/ <BR> <BR>Ah, courier has just brought me the Adobe CS! Nice&hellip;</div>
