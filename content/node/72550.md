  we're under the gun to fix a broken situation. so here's the deal: I have until
  this afternoon to preset a headline (and companion text) face to meet these qualities.\r\n\r\n-
  personal\r\n- approachable\r\n- authoritative\r\n- passionate\r\n- happy\r\n\r\nit's
  going in print (catalogs, mailers, signage, etc) and online. right now, print is
  the first order of business. it's going to sit with food. and it will be mostly
  for mood, not necessarily promotion (I think that's where a good companion face
  will come in handy).\r\n\r\nI'm working from the type specimens I have on hand,
  but I know there's a lot more out there. what do you guys think?"

  body: I should point out the reason I came to typophile with this (other than the
    community's well-informed perspective). the specified font will be purchased for
    an entire agency, which means a small sales boost for some excellent foundry I
    may not have otherwise found.

    yes, the world's most interesting man.\r\nAnd what is the worlds' most interesting
    typeface?\r\nHelvetica.\r\nSo there must be something wrong with this procedure.\r\n\r\nAll
    those words, except for authoritative, mean just one thing: not too stiff and
    formal.\r\nSo how do you resolve casual and authoritative?\r\nCould it perhaps
    be one of those compromise faces -- a \"clean\" sans serif with the corners slightly
    smoothed?\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/hvdfonts/brevia/\">Brevia</a>,
    perhaps, with fashionable large x-height and short capitals?\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    you for getting right to the point! yes, it's ad-man speak for sure. but these
    actually relate to this brand in very believable ways. \r\n\r\nit's mid to high
    end goods. mostly gift-focused, but a lot of 'special treat for yourself' products
    too. definitely appeals to a sophisticated crowd, but it's not for cooks really.\r\n\r\nI'm
    actually leaning toward OurType's Parry right now. it has the wide, comfy, casual
    look the client likes. there's a good range of weights. it's not so styled they'll
    be tired of it 6 weeks from now. bonus: the Grotesque pairing might come in handy.\r\n\r\nNick,
    I tried to throw Bodoni Egyptian in the mix, but it wasn't quite what the client
    wanted (we've had a little back and forth already this morning).\r\n\r\nI've gotten
    an extension through Monday morning. hopefully, I can do a little more research
    between now and then ... without dropping my other projects ;)"
