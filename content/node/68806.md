body: "hello. i wondered if anyone could provide any help or advice with fontlab?
  at the moment it seems to have set a default descender of -250pt. the typeface i've
  created drops below this and when i test/generate the font all the descending glyphs
  are clipped slightly where the tails exceed the descender line. \r\n\r\ni imagined
  dragging the descender below the lowest point would have solved the problem but
  it didn't seem to affect it. perhaps there is another way?\r\n\r\nany help would
  be greatly appreciated."
