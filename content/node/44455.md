body: "Hi guys, hope you can help. I am slightly new to the technical side of typography
  and in the current process of creating my own typographic identity. I know it has
  to work at all sizes, for posters, packaging, billboards, letterheads and business
  cards.\r\n\r\nWhen I design the typeface do i create one identity, one image, one
  file and then scale it down for stuff like my letterhead? or do I create various
  sizes which then can be applied to various mediums?\r\n\r\nWhat is the professional
  way to do this?\r\n\r\n\r\nhope you typoheads can help me here!!"

  body: "Usually when you design a logotype you would design different version for
    different conditions. These conditions are defined by all the uses you can imagine
    the logotype would be used in - these works as limitations on the complexity of
    the design. For instance, if the logo is to be printed in flexography in one inch
    width that sets some harsh limitations colours and details. So you take the worst
    case uses and work your way up from there. Usually a simple black version of the
    'mother' logo is created to be used in these worst case situations, and proper
    colour logotypes are then used in normal usage.\r\n\r\nSize concerns are solved
    also be making several versions for different sizes. The typography can be optimised
    for small usage by slightly widening the letterforms, increase the letterspacing
    and increasing the x-height. All these differences should be harmonious and coherent,
    and invisible to the layman's eye.\r\n\r\nWhether one, a few, or many version
    of the logotype is needed, depends on the character of the logotype, so your milage
    may vary."

  body: You should save all the logos in individual EPS files. The logos should be
    created using vector art only - if at all possible.

  body: cool. We i am using illustrator so it will be vector art anyways wouldn't
    it? does it matter what size i make the logo in the first place? should i create
    a massive image first, or does that not matter?

  body: "Illustrator will create vector art, except if you have applied any filter
    that renders a bitmap results - e.g. like a drop shadow. The logos should then
    be in 100% of the size they are to be used in. The largest logo version is free
    to be scaled up, but the other variations should not be scaled, so that there
    are only a number of absolute sizes/version of the logo used across printed elements.\r\n\r\nWeb
    versions of the logo is much more complicated (in practical usage). It depends
    who designs the webdesign and uses the logo. If they know what they are doing
    it's better just to give them the EPS logo made for small size. You can supply
    GIF, and JPEG versions for web use, but often they won't fit the usage and the
    web-designer will ask for the EPS anyway."
