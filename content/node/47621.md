    it is. As you know, the whole thing is pretty much volunteer. So TypeCon is all
    of us and we all help to create it in our different ways. \r\n\r\nPeter, it was
    great to see you and Stefan. I'm glad the Swedish delegation was there again to
    \"represent.\" You guys are always great fun to have around. But next time, get
    your stuff to me in time to go in the goodie bag ;-)\r\n\r\nNancy, I enjoyed what
    I was able to see of your presentation. As someone said to me in the hall afterward,
    you always manage to make the most seemingly mundane things so fascinating.\r\n\r\nMark
    (\"Jupiter Boy Hatley\" ;-), it was great hanging with you & Pam (and Craig and
    Jason) at the Roycroft, however briefly.\r\n\r\nIt was great to see many of the
    usual suspects and meet some more Typophiles face to face. \r\n\r\nHope to see
    y'all again next year in Atlanta!\r\n\r\n-- Kent."

    say hello. It is great to hear the many comments. I thought I would rest up today
    but instead found out about a printers auction today in East Aurora and saw letterpress
    equipment sell for far too little (and scrap). Luckily I was able to get Laurence
