    even search for hotels by their vicinity to famous locations (Madison Square Garden
    seems closest to that address you listed).\r\n\r\npersonally i'd recommend the
    Milford Plaza, but it's not really nearby your address there.. it's up just a
    few blocks from Times Square. nice hotel though, and reasonably priced considering
    the very central location."

    friend of mine spoke well of it once, and I passed his tip on to some friends
    who were here last July for TypeCon... they liked it... not too expensive, either.\r\n\r\n160
    E. 25th St. (tel. 1-212-679-0680), between Third and Lexington Ave.\r\n\r\nMy
    old <em>Let's Go</em> guide says, \"54 spacious rooms, each decorated by a different
    artist.\" Another good reason to check it out.  :-)"
