  and experimented by making a typeface (lower case only as for now), as I didn't
  have access to formal teaching. I won't try to classify my influences as they're
  obvious enough. I'd be happy for any and all critique, as nitpicky or general as
  you like. I'm also interested in your ideas of serifed upright cursives in general
  and if the fact that some letters are cursive and some not bothers you.\r\n\r\n[[http://users.tkk.fi/ituomi/sample.pdf|Link
  to sample pdf file]]\r\n\r\nAlso if there's some other typefaces I could learn from,
  let me know!\r\nI'm very grateful for your time, thank you!"

    of the letters.

    but that is no matter: creation before classification.\r\n\r\nI would smooth away
    the crimp in the tail of |y| and the slight bump on the lower right of |g|."

  body: 'Some of the quirks are kind of charming. /s/ tries too hard to be horizontal
    in its spine, and its terminals also look out of character. My eye really catches
    on that ball terminal in the loop of /g/. /a/''s "puppy-dog" tail looks like it
    might present spacing difficulties. '

  body: "Thanks for the suggestions and kind words.\r\n\r\ndhannah is right, Century
    Schoolbook was an important inspiration. I smoothed /y/ and /g/ out as per cerulean's
    suggestion (great finds!) and reverted /s/ to an older, curvier version thanks
    to eliason. He was right about it. I'm really attached to the ball terminal on
    /g/ so I've just made it slightly smaller...\r\n\r\n[[http://users.tkk.fi/ituomi/sample2.pdf|Link

  body: "If this is really your first font, you've got talent. General advice: Try
    out all suggestions before ditching them, and add pics to your posts, you'll get
    more feedback.\r\n\r\n- Some of your curves are quirky. Try RMX tools if you want
    to make this into something worth selling.\r\n- The middle strokes of 'a' and
    e are too thick.\r\n- The top terminal of a is too small. Make space for it by
    moving it to the left, and decreasing the size of the bowl.\r\n-The tail of 'a'
    is cut off at a weird angle.\r\n- Lovely curves in b and d!\r\n- c is falling
    backwards. Move the top to the right, or the bottom to the left.\r\n- Top right
    of e is too squarish, not round.\r\n- f is nice, but perhaps a bit wide. Check
    how it looks next to some other letters.\r\n- Bottom terminal in g still too large.
    I'd ditch it entirely though.\r\n- Because of your open serif structure, n and
    h look too wide next to o.\r\n- Nice k!\r\n- Compare the thin part of the curve
    in n, to that of p.\r\n- o is too light\r\n- You might want to try to enlarge
    that little spur on the q, to add character.\r\n- The bottom serifs on the inside
    of p, q, f, and r need to be bigger than usual, to prevent the letter from falling.\r\n-
    The shoulder in r is somewhat unsatisfying. I think it needs to increase in thickness
    already before it hits the ball terminal.\r\n- s spine is too thick, and s is
    top-heavy. Make the top narrower, and compare the serifs.\r\n- t's curve is too
    sharp, not round. The top horizontal stroke could extend a bit further to the
    right.\r\n- u is too wide. It sometimes needs to be even smaller than n, but your
    n is also too wide, I think.\r\n- Serifs on diagonals (v, w, etc.) lack character,
    and too small.\r\n- Compare the serifs on top of x, to those on the bottom. \r\n-
    I think you need to push the ball terminal of y to the right, less curvy.\r\n-
    Nice subtle curves in z! Perhaps try a similar subtlety in k, to tone it down
    a bit, and make this more suitable a a text font.\r\n\r\nGood luck. Don't trust
    your critiques blindly, but try their suggestions. Take care of details, but don't
    lose the bigger picture. Look at stroke thickness, some of your thicks and thins
    are a bit out of tune.\r\n\r\nCheers! jasper\r\n"

  body: "Ohh, and start working on some caps. They'll give you helpful insights for
    your lowercase, and allow for a bit more creativity. Think of how you want to
    incorporate the 'cursive' style in the naturally more rigid uppercase.\r\n\r\nWhat
    you're trying to do with the middle stroke in 'a' and e might be a bit too calligraphic
    for this style of font. "
