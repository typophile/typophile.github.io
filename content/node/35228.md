  body: "Sorry about the link, you caught me with my pants down...\r\nWell , before
    I noticed I didn't attach the image to the post. :)\r\n\r\nI doubt the script
    is handwritten, it must be a font. There's not too many scripts around that it
    could be?\r\n:) j/k\r\n\r\nOn another note,\r\nwould there be any rational to
    use a geometric Futura for a romantic/period theme?\r\nPerhaps, is it a case of
    the recent popularity of hairline fonts, or perhaps a hairline font does fit the
    theme and outweights the coldness of a geometric... since it's such a small weight
    perhaps the geometric attributes don't come into effect anyways?\r\nNah, probably
    just a favorite type of the designer.\r\n\r\nWhat do you think?\r\n\r\n"

    hire Typophile!

  body: "Michel, my apologies, you are correct about the letter <strong>t</strong>.
    (Shame on me, I should have noticed!) MyFonts has some info on <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/foundry/ef-typeshop/\"><strong>Walter
    Florenz Brendel</strong></a>, which explains a bit about the slight variations
    from Futura. And I guess that at least in the case of <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/ef-typeshop/volkswagen/\"><strong>TS
    Volkswagen</strong></a>, he is slyly winking at those who know that Futura has
    been the typeface used by Volkswagen since the 1960s, when Helmut Krone created
    <a href=\"http://www.enchorial.com/HelmutKronePages/HelmutKroneCh4_p68_69.htm\"><strong>those
    iconic ads</strong></a>...\r\n\r\nAs for that other website, my advice is... don't
    go there."

  body: Ricardo, thanks for the references. As for "that other website", I must confess
    that the only alternative I have found so far to cross reference fonts is looking
    at their Berry name used by TeX and fontinst -- nothing user friendly, to say
    the least. Any better suggestion would be most welcomed.
