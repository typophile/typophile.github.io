body: "Hey Guys,\r\n\r\nI have been given the pleasure of creating an identity for
  an alternative energy company.  In short their value proposition is to provide cost
  effective ways to convert waste into useful energy, hopefully resulting in energy
  independence for the US.  The communication needs are a real challenge due to the
  following objectives:\r\n\r\nKey Words & Emotive Phrases \r\n\u2022 Urgency ~ These
  technologies are needed, now. \r\n\u2022 Savvy \r\n\u2022 Progressive ~ They mentioned
  Apple as a brand and philosophy they admired. Non-traditional \r\n\u2022 Recycle,
  renew ~ The underlying concept. However slightly different than the traditional
  recycling model. \r\n\u2022 Heart ~ Passion for what they do and how they can help.
  \r\n\u2022 Green\r\n\u2022 Simple \r\n\u2022 Clean\r\n\r\nThe Must Nots \r\n\u2022
  Must not be associated with the traditional Environmentalist crazies. \r\n\u2022
  Must not appear to be a \"tree hugger\" company.\r\n\r\nSo the challenge is to be
  professional enough to be taken seriously while leaving an element of environmental
  purity.  I'm not so much asking for ideas on the mark (unless you feel like dropping
  an idea) although I would greatly appreciate any typefaces that would communicate
  or closely communicate the objectives at hand.  You guys are the best so please
  let the links roll :)"

  body: A little bit of thought led me to <a href=http://beorcana.com/specs2.html>Beorcana</a>,
    brand new from [[Carl Crossgrove]] and much discussed on Typophile. It's non-traditional,
    but in a different way than Apple's (I think now over-imitated) ultra-clean, sleek
    identity. It has a real warm and human feel to it, which is right up your company's
    alley. A concern might be that the strong humanistic element would lead a bit
    to the "tree-hugger" feel, but I think that it's clean and refined enough that
    it wouldn't be a problem if handled correctly. I think, ultimately, its utility
    rests in your hands; I shudder at the poor uses of Optima I see floating about,
    but I believe that smart, considerate use of Beorcana for the company might be
    an interesting move.
