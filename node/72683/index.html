  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>Cooper Union&rsquo;s new typeface design program, organized in conjunction with the Type Directors Club was just recently announced. It is currently a certificate program offered through Cooper&rsquo;s continuing education department. The new website has all the info on curriculum, faculty bios, and application details:
<a href="http://coopertype.org/">http://coopertype.org/</a></p>
<p>While there have been many type design workshops and classes offered in North America before, this is the first program of its kind to take place on the continent. Having moved to New York not too long ago myself, I must say I can&rsquo;t think of a better city to hold such a program in – if for nothing else than to have access to such a vast pool of talented type folks living in the area.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Cooper Union and the Type Directors Club couldn&rsquo;t be much better organizations to have involved. Among other things, Cooper has made typography a priority with their Herb Lubalin Study Center of Design and Typography, and the TDC&rsquo;s annual typeface awards are among the most notable in the industry. Plus it goes without saying that both have long typographic histories that include some of the greats of American type, lettering, and design.</p>
<p>The <a href=http://coopertype.org/curriculum/>course list</a> and <a href=http://coopertype.org/faculty/>roster of people involved</a> for the first term alone is quite impressive (not to mention surprisingly diverse), and I&rsquo;m sure the second and third terms will be just as good. More information will be posted on the site as it becomes available.</p>
<p>I apologize for shamelessly tooting the horn of a project I&rsquo;m obviously involved with, but I&rsquo;m really excited about it and thought some of you might be as well. As always, I&rsquo;m appreciative of any feedback – critical or otherwise – and am happy to answer any questions.</p>

<p>Typeface Design is growing as a discipline, and the spread of dedicated programs of study worldwide, as opposed to modules within general design courses, is a great indication of a maturing field (SCAD, Bs-As, Zurich, Barcelona, FADU, Amiens, Pueblas&hellip; I&rsquo;m forgetting some, I&rsquo;m sure). Well done to the CU for hosting the new programme, the institution has a great tradition to build on, and is a natural candidate for a full-length program in the States.</p>

<p>Cara Di Edwardo, Alexander Tochilovsky, and I have been working with Cooper and the TDC to get this going, and we&rsquo;re pleased to be able to offer a more intensive typeface design program here in New York. We&rsquo;ll keep an eye on this discussion and are happy to answer your questions about the curriculum and admissions process.</p>
<p>As Nick pointed out, we are eager to maintain the diversity of our offerings through the course of the three terms. So we also welcome proposals from potential guest lecturers or workshop leaders.</p>

<p>Please direct the &lsquo;official&rsquo; questions about the program through the <a href="mailto:type@cooper.edu">type@cooper.edu</a> website so we can centralize inquiries. We&rsquo;ll try and get a FAQ page up as we figure out all the questions people have. Already I&rsquo;ve gotten inquiries about student visas for foreign nationals and I can&rsquo;t answer that one just yet, but I&rsquo;m working on it so stand by. There&rsquo;s something on the State Department website that makes it very confusing so I have to seek a consult from our Undergrad admissions people. Standby for that answer.</p>

<p>It is our thought that as a certificate program, with a less demanding work load than a Masters program, Type@Cooper would appeal to many working designers, giving them the practical skills and a broad view of typeface design history and theory at an affordable price.</p>
<p>The format of having electives and guest speakers available to folks outside the program will allow graduates of the program to stay connected (beyond the one year) to both the offerings of Type@Cooper and the TDC.</p>

<p>Why? It’s not like having and MA is a huge advantage in the design field. Sure it might make getting a type design job a little easier, but they’re still so incredibly rare that it’s a pretty big gamble. It makes sense to have another option for people who don’t want to put an enormous amount of time and money into what’s really vocational training.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I wouldn&rsquo;t necessarily be seeking an MA in type design to further my career. It&rsquo;d be more for the immersive learning environment and the experience. To dedicate an entire year or so to type design is a pretty big undertaking with not too much reward. But the undertaking would be considerably less of a burden if the States had an MA program of its own.</p>
<p>Granted, you don&rsquo;t need an MA to be a successful type designer, but I don&rsquo;t think many people go into it with the impression it will make them one of the best.</p>
<p>cdiedwardo makes a great point though. the Cooper program may end up being just as popular, if not more than Reading and KABK simply for the fact that it is not as much of an undertaking. Also, with the location being what it is, that&rsquo;s an undeniable attraction since it will be so close to so many designers.</p>

<p>James, just to clarify, the program is actually <em>three</em> terms long, ten weeks per term. Students will be awarded certificates only after successfully completing the full three terms. I understand your concern—it is indeed a big investment of time (though far less than a full Master&rsquo;s program). In this uncharted territory, it&rsquo;s difficult to predict the student base. But we&rsquo;re optimistic, since we&rsquo;ve received a substantial amount of interest already.</p>

<p>The fundamental principles are sidebearings, alignment zones/overshoot, vertical proportions and stem widths, and these are easiest to grasp in a plain sans serif.</p>
<p>Besides, starting with a revival sets a prosaic tone for a type design course. 
It&rsquo;s overly academic, like art school in the 19th century, where the subject of drawing classes was a plaster cast of an old statue.</p>

<p>Most people come to a type design course with an idea they are interested in exploring. Having different styles being developed in class adds to a certain visual richness, and allows the instructor to point out issues that emerge from the different styles.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve had students start with blackletter, handwriting, sans serif, serif, historical revival, carnival/circus type, tombstone lettering, western lettering, various styles of formal calligraphy, and more. All of those styles, and the problems they presented to the student designers were great teaching opportunities for the entire class.</p>
<p>Thanks Michael, I did take it as a complement, and sensed no ire.</p>
<p>Jesse, I don&rsquo;t doubt that there is great interest in the program. I hope that interest continues after the first year or two. Time will tell. Good luck.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Thank you, Nick and James, for sharing the benefit of your teaching experiences.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a good point, Nick, but I tend to agree more with James&rsquo;s sentiments. The basic principles can be taught with almost any style of letter, and the diversity of classmates' projects will be instructive to students.</p>
<p>Over the years in my undergraduate typeface design class at Pratt, I&rsquo;ve let students choose between revivals and original designs. The most important thing is that students choose projects that can maintain their enthusiasm through many, many hours of potentially tedious work. But I&rsquo;ve found that most beginner students reach better results when working from some kind of source material. Sources have ranged from a few words on a WPA poster to a full alphabet in a Deberny &amp; Peignot specimen (with permission, of course), and interpretations have ranged from &ldquo;recuttings&rdquo; to &ldquo;reconsiderations&rdquo; ([[http://www.emigre.com/Editorial.php?sect=2&amp;id=1|John Downer&rsquo;s terms]]). I encourage students to work on designs that fit their skill levels and interests, and a simple sans serif may be just the thing for some of them.</p>
<p>For students who are less familiar with type anatomy, working from a source provides the opportunity to learn, through critical observation and meticulous reconstruction, key principles like letter proportion, weight distribution, and maintaining/breaking a system. And since many variables have already been established in the sources, students are able to focus more attention on the fundamental principles Nick mentions.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s true that a beginning designer may not be fully prepared to handle a revival with the nuance and care that it deserves. But the goal in the first term is to learn, not to produce the best possible product. (How many designers' first attempts at typefaces have been masterpieces, anyway?) We have the luxury of three terms, and the larger project in the second and third terms will provide the opportunity to design a more finessed finished project.</p>
<p>And James, I certainly hope Type@Cooper won&rsquo;t detract from your SVA CE enrollment. I expect the difference in time commitment makes your class far more feasible for some students. Let&rsquo;s hope there&rsquo;s room for both!</p>

<p>James (Terminal), sure, you can teach skills from anything, but in my experience, having taught both ways, it&rsquo;s a more solid start to keep it simple.
If everyone is pursuing their own script or circus font or some such thing, many are going to have difficulty grasping the fundamentals around which most Type 1 fonts are structured.</p>
<p>The basic principle of spacing/sidebearings is succinctly demonstrated in a sans serif, visually and numerically, but that is not the case with a serifed type:

<p>They are going to get a chance to do their own thing in terms two and three.</p>

<p>Yes they are going to have difficulty, but they get a great deal of satisfaction when they do get it right.</p>
<p>And an entire class doing a geometric sans would be the kiss of death from a student enthusiasm point of view. Face it, type design is a tedious pastime and anything you can do to keep a student engaged in the process is a good thing. Everyone staring at one another&rsquo;s geo sans would not be a good thing.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve tried that, and was surprised at the individuality of student responses. This was in a general design course, and for such students, giving them all the same clearly defined project had many advantages, compared to the do-your-own thing approach, where the biggest problem, which always ended up confounding several, was that they didn&rsquo;t have an idea of what they wanted to do. After all, as &lsquo;designers&rsquo; they were used to working from briefs, not creating their own.</p>
<p>But isn&rsquo;t motivation irrelevant here? As you yourself have often mentioned on Typophile, type design is indeed a &ldquo;tedious&rdquo; pursuit, so wouldn&rsquo;t one expect students of this course to be sufficiently steeled for that, and admitted to the course accordingly?</p>
<p>Jesse: <em>The most important thing is that students choose projects that can maintain their enthusiasm through many, many hours of potentially tedious work. But I&rsquo;ve found that most beginner students reach better results when working from some kind of source material.</p>
<p>But this is a specialist course for those committed to type design, not part of a general design course. Aren&rsquo;t students being admitted on the recognition that they are type-designer material, i.e. (a) they are suited to grinding out massive OpenType fonts and (b) they have some original ideas for typefaces?</p>

<p>Students in Continuing Ed seem to know what they are getting into, but most undergraduate students have no idea what they are in for when they sign up for the course. All have told me that it was much more work than they expected. Some have admitted that they hated it and never wanted to do it again. I think finding out what you don&rsquo;t want to do as a designer may be more important than finding out what you want to do. And regardless of a student&rsquo;s expectation, isn&rsquo;t keeping a student motivated one of the key tasks of the instructor?</p>

<p>I haven&rsquo;t seen the prospective students, but I would imagine that they already have plenty of motivation, given how overdue a course like this is in North America.</p>
<p>If they couldn&rsquo;t hack a first-term project making a sans serif font, they will find out in a hurry type design is something they don&rsquo;t want to do!</p>

<p>I think the least you can do is demand that they finish a simple geo sans in two weeks. Most professionals should be able to do one over the weekend. They might as well get use to the work load and time frame that is expected of them as professionals.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Concerning foreign students and visas, here is what I can say.</p>
<p>No one needs to have a special visa to apply to or attend Type@Cooper, immigration status is not a factor at all.</p>
<p>Cooper Union cannot help to get a student visa to study (which is good news and a little bit bad news) because the program doesn&rsquo;t require enough contact hours to qualify. This is only bad if you come from a country who&rsquo;s citizens must jump through hoops to get a tourist visa to the US. It&rsquo;s good because thanks to Homeland Security, schools now have to charge enormous fees to foreign students to offset the expense of doing the ten years of follow-up paperwork per student.</p>
<p>I am told that there are quite a few Brazilians who have come repeatedly to do the Architecture Certificate program in Green Building courses here at Cooper. They have all come on tourist visas.</p>
<p>The only difficulty is that a tourist visa limits you to a certain number of months visit. Still, the fees that get charged to foreign students are more than just about any round trip airfare in the world.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Bill, 
Cristobal correctly lists the fall lectures. These will be held in an auditorium that can accommodate a lot of people.</p>
<p>The elective workshops will have limited enrollment, and priority will be given to those in the program as an optional course in addition to the core, but included in the price of the program. We expect there will be a few open places in these workshops for people outside the program.</p>
<p>In the fall 2 weekend workshops are planned; Drawn Letters with Ken Barber, and Experiment and Expression in letterform design with Mark Jamra.</p>
<p>Richard Lipton and John Downer have agreed to teach lettering/design workshops in the spring. We are still working out the details of a few more electives for spring on the technical end of font production. I imagine we can open those up to more people.</p>
<p>FYI, Cooper Union Continuing Education&rsquo;s website is set up in such a way that makes it impossible to list these options and allow people to enroll directly through the site. If you are interested in signing up to attend anything at Type@Cooper (other than applying for the whole program) you need to call them during office hours 10 am—6pm. The number&rsquo;s on the website.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Hi folks: a bit late to this thread, I also want to wish the Type@Cooper program the best of luck and heartily agree that it’s about time this kind of comprehensive type education is offered on this side of the Atlantic!</p>
<p>For those looking for something a little lighter on the time commitment scale, due to the demand for my summer SVA CE workshop Turning Letters Into Type, I’m also scheduled to teach a semester-long version of it on Monday nights in both the Fall and Spring semesters (with more intensives planned for next summer as well, if as James M. points out there are enough students to go around). I believe the difference between my class and James’ is that mine is taught in a computer lab with TypeTool available to each student — for now, until SVA upgrades to FontLab for a more advanced version of the class — so it’s digitally hands-on as well as lecture/critique in format.</p>
<p>The fall class starts Sept. 20, and registration is available [[http://www.schoolofvisualarts.edu/ceCourseFinder/app?sDay=0&amp;sTime=0&amp;sLoc=&amp;sDept=&amp;sCourse=GDC-4458-A%09&amp;sInstructor=&amp;sKeyword=|here]].</p>

<p>James: agreed, I asked SVA about this as soon as I saw the disparity in fees assuming it was an error, but apparently that&rsquo;s how they price these things. I wasn&rsquo;t even aware there was another type design class being offered simultaneously with mine until I saw this thread, so I guess they&rsquo;re not too concerned about either the potential redundancy or the price difference.

<p>Computer labs are money pits for schools. The costs of space, hardware, software, printers, toner, networking, cooling, staff, etc. get really ridiculous in schools, especially when vandalism and theft get factored in. They’d probably do much better by just demanding that all students provide their own.</p>

<p>Admittedly, that can work in the United States, where the students (or the parents) can afford it. But not every school in the world can demand to their students to buy a laptop. And we must not forget that it is not only about buying the computer, but about licensing the required software. But, on the other hand, I see your point and I agree: it is not efficient for the university to provide computers for the students that can have (and actually have) their own laptops.</p>

		<div class="commentbody">In many colleges in the USA, laptops are required just like text books&ndash;and this is for all majors. There is a sort of quiet, behind-the-scenes thing that happens where students who show a great financial need, are given loaners by either the school or charitable minded corporate sponsors. I remember, what seemed to me to be an incredible financial burden in 1962, when I had to come up with the money to buy a Yashica-D for a freshman photography class at CMU. At least I was not in engineering where they not only had to buy a slide rule but books of log tables.</div>

<p>Thing is, the price difference is $430. Cost for a basic but functional Windows laptop with 4 GB of RAM: $400. TypeTool is $100. Total, $500. So, it&rsquo;s hard to justify the course-in-the-lab pricing from a student perspective, really. (Not that I&rsquo;m denying all the expenses the school has in running the lab, which add up.)</p>

<p>This is quite accurate. There is a trade off of luxury and efficiency vs. cost effectiveness.</p>
<p>Running a type design class in a computer lab allows students to scan and print and to use other applications to test a font in a layout), reliable access the Internet, and file sharing. Access to networked printers allows students to inspect their work on high quality print outs quickly and throughout class time and to get ready for critiques on the fly. Of course, there is a cost for this luxury.</p>
<p>Obviously, many serious design students already own a laptop and if money is an issue would better spend those funds on a laptop and legal licensing of software so they can obsess over BCPs at home.</p>
<p>For Type@Cooper, we&rsquo;re doing something in-between&hellip;we&rsquo;ll have dedicated equipment and AV support without the full lab environment.</p>
