  body: Snoooopy. I remember reading about this somewhere. <BR>The unicase font itself
    is custom, done by <BR>a major branding house. i can&#39;t remember who. <BR>
    <BR> If you are interested <BR>in a typeface that&#39;s similar, you could try
    <BR>myfonts.com and type in &#34;sans&#34; <BR> <BR>

  body: Wow -- I liked the old Gymboree logo much, much better. It was simplistic,
    but it was cleanly done and seemed to be more oriented toward its audience.

  body: If I remember correctly, the Gymboree case study is in a design book.  <BR>Was
    it Landor possibly? <BR> <BR>A previous Gymboree redesign is discussed below.

  body: Never mind. I thought that was a previous <BR>redesign because of the dated
    photos and logo. <BR> <BR>Somewhat sure it was Pentagram who created <BR>this
    font. <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR>

    stuff always has two audiences: the kids, and the people who pay for it. Like
    an educational software package will have the front &#40;&#34;grab-and-show-mommie&#34;&#41;
    side designed for kids, and the back &#40;&#34;Hmmm, let me see if this is good
    for my kid&#34;&#41; side designed for adults. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>'
