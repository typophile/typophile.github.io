  body: As nobody's suggested anything better yet, it could be a heavily modified
    [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/urw/stop/Stop]]. Manually slanted, hence the wonky
    curves, stretched a bit horizontally and a left leg added to R. If it is Stop,
    the yellow outline would be the original type and the black would be an inline
    effect, not vice versa.
