body: "In my font, I have rather large (or, more specifically to this question, long
  and to the left) descenders.  While I've figured most of the time if, for instance,
  a j comes right after a g (which would cause overlap), I'd just have an alternate
  j, I figured since Spanish has a typographic tradition both of a lowered \xA1 (as
  a descender character) and a raised (as an ascender), I'd have it be lowered normally,
  since i prefer this style, but if a descender would cross over, to have it push
  up the more modern raised style.  (incidentally, this would also provide a nice
  alternate glyph for people who prefer it raised).  After ransacking my brain for
  an hour or two why I couldn't get it to work, I realised that neither TextEdit nor
  Pages nor any of the Cocoa apps seem to support chain substitution on latin fonts
  (which Font Forge mentions somewhere in the docs that some apps won't because of
  some technicality in the opentype format).  While I could just do \"ligatures\"
  that would cause the substitution, eventually that could start to build up in combinations.
  \ Is there any more compatible way to do this?\r\n\r\n(the image shows traditional
  placement on \xA1ay!, then crossover on \xA1j\xF3der! and then the modernised variant
  ... no kerning for it ... to prevent crossover also on \xA1j\xF3der!)\r\n\r\n"

    you think it would be strange to have both versions in the same piece of typesetting?

  body: "Kerning was my first thought -- but in this font, a \xBFy combination (which
    happens with relatively high frequency in Spanish) would be kerned so far apart
    as to be distracting.\r\n\r\nI don't think it would be too weird, at least, certainly
    not more than having a full em of extra kerning or crossover.  Whilst I've never
    seen them in the same document before, some major publishers like C\xE1tedra are
    still a little confused as to which they use, with about half their books now
    using the raised, and half the lowered, although the rest of the font is the same,
    or barely noticeably different.\r\n\r\nI actually forgot I was going to place
    the raised in a stylistic set, thanks for reminding me about that.  I guess since
    the only two languages that use \xA1\xBF are Spanish and Galician I can plan for
    the only collisions (y, y-acute for old Spanish, j, and j-dotless for transcriptions
    old books).  I guess I was hoping for a \"more correct\" solution in case it started
    coming up a lot more with some other characters later on in the design process.\r\n\r\n<em>\xABEl

  body: I think this is why you don't often see a long tail on the j in fonts. Same
    thing with the f, but less so if you can have f-ligatures.

  body: "Well, the main old (metal) reason was to reduce the chance of breakage. In
    digital the main reason has been to reduce unsightly overlaps. But now with OT
    the reasons are mostly -if not completely- gone.\r\n\r\nFor the \"\xA1j\" I wouldn't
    raise the \"\xA1\" - way too much potential for confusion with the \"i\". I would
    instead give it a shorter descender when it occurs before a \"j\", and in this
    (exteme) case maybe not even kern it when OT support is lacking - the huge gap
    would be worse than the touching. Anyway unsophisticated typesetters are unlikely
    to mind unsophisticated typesetting!\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "Mark: you bring up another good point:\r\n\r\nIs there an OpenType method
    for defining glyph changes at the beginning or end of lines? (not that I would
    expect such a feature to be supported by any piece of software).  There are some
    camps that prefer punctuation outside of the main block of text when it comes
    up on the margin.  I figure that would generally be considered a program feature,
    but is it possible to encode it within the font (let me first say I'm not planning
    on doing it, just a theoretically example, \xE0 la encoding proper quotes substitution
    in font)\r\n\r\n<em>\xABEl futuro es una l\xEDnea tan fina que apenas nos damos

  body: "It is interesting how different people come up with different solutions.
    My first inclination would be to make a ligature for gj, and to use an alternate
    \"j\" when it follows an inverted question mark. The \"y\" is a tougher case,
    but reminds me of some old metal fonts like Monotype Garamond italic, where you
    both have to make some extra ligatures, and an alternate \"y\" is helpful to boot
    -- sometimes to be used in making the ligature.\r\n\r\nI think a reader far less
    likely to complain about -- or even notice -- alternate letter forms than to complain
    about letters that overlap.\r\n\r\nIn passing, I think you may have the sidebearings
    too tight on the j -- how does the word \"Kilimanjaro\" look?\r\n\r\n"

    still do crossover on the \xA1j \xBFj combination (Times).  I'll try out hrants
    solution and see how it looks.  The annoying thing is that while these combinations
    will come up in no languages but Spanish and Galician (and more so the former),
    they come up all the time.  Kilimanjaro looks okay to me, maybe a tad more space

    your \"a\" needs work on the sidebearings, and the \"i\" is generally too tight

    with some half rounds -- m's and n's -- Another test word would be one ending
    in \"ing\" (which comes up a lot in text), and really shows when the \"i\" doesn't
    have enough sidebearing space, particularly when \"ing\" follows a \"t\" or \"r\"
