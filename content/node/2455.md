  body: Kris, I love it. I am not a type designer, so I can not really offer much
    in the way of technical criticism. But, I can tell you that I like it. The face
    is pleasing and seems to have nice ballance. <BR> <BR>Nice work!

  body: How is it considered bifurcated?  I thought that meant split in two? <BR>
    <BR>I like it though.  But I have to say that the bottom of the &#34;head&#34;
    &#40;can&#39;t remember what it&#39;s called&#41; of the R should be thicker.  Also,
    what about moving the tail under the baseline?  It sticks out so far that it creates
    an awkward space between the letter next to it. <BR> <BR>And the E looks very
    thin, should be wider I think. <BR> <BR>The C looks small. <BR> <BR> <BR>Really
    good start.

    correct terminology. I am more than willing to stand corrected, though. <BR> <BR>kris'

  body: 'I think those are called cupped serifs. <BR> <BR>The style is nice. The trouble
    I see is a color issue. It has to do with your thins. Take a look at the BETW
    combination. The B has some of the thinnest thins in the whole face. Compare it
    to the BE. The W is even more thick than them. True they won&#39;t be exactly
    the same, but they should &#42;look&#42; the same. I&#39;d shoot for a uniform
    thin slightly less than the arms of the E. <BR> <BR>Oh here&#39;s a tip on E&#39;s.
    The arms shouldn&#39;t be of equal thickness or they will look unequal. I start
    with them equal, then add a hair to the bottom &#40;heft is needed at the bottom&#41;,
    and shave a bit off the middle. Again the key is making them &#42;look&#42; the
    same. &#40;top of T = bottom of E&#41; <BR> <BR>While I&#39;m at it, here are
    some common construction issues with caps: <BR>F: Equals the E with the middle
    arm moved down slightly &#40;sometimes extended&#41;, and the bottom right serif
    extended &#40;how much is up to you&#41; <BR>L: Equals the E with the bottom arm
    shortened. <BR>P: Bowl equals the top of the R dropped down a bit &#40;or the
    R is raised up a bit.  <BR>X: Watch out for <a href="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/21083.html?1074095015">this</a>
    problem. &#40;scroll down&#41; <BR> <BR>Keep an eye on the curves on the S. They&#39;re
    wobbly through the spine. <BR>I&#39;d try a different leg on the R. With those
    fancy pants serifs it want&#39;s something more than a straight crutch. &#40;also
    raise up the waist '

  body: '&#62;&#62;With those fancy pants serifs... <BR> <BR>That&#39;s pretty much
    it, isn&#39;t it! It&#39;s just a bloody fancy, almost pretentious typeface. It
    is amazing what a few grouped beziers can say... <BR> <BR>&#62;&#62;And cupped
    serif does sound better. <BR> <BR>Do you think? I reckon &#34;bifurcated&#34;
    sounds fancier, &#34;cupped&#34; sounds more friendly, and reminds me of bra&#39;s.
    Thanks for the feedback, I realised that it is quite rough at this stage. It is
    a digitisation of a speciman I found in an old type journal. I am pretty much
    using it to have a play and familiarise myself with the older titling proportions.  <BR>
    <BR>kris.'
