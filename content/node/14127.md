body: "It was a slow weekend, I had an idea and so Texter was born. Texter is a web-based
  tool to allow the previewing of typefaces and I hope it will be some use to people
  here. Try it <a href=\"http://www.bombsites.co.uk/texter/\" style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">here</a>\r\n\r\nIt
  runs on Javascript and Flash with most of the hard work being done by <a href=\"http://www.mikeindustries.com/sifr/\">sIFR</a>
  there is no server-side programming used. It is a light and simple alternative to
  the likes of Mudtyper*.\r\n\r\nIt is not a massively complicated system, so I'm
  not going to ask for money to licence Texter, but instead I would like to provide
  Texter licences in return for font licences. I hope this is a fair system, let me
  know what you think. \r\n\r\nIt's early days with this yet, so all and any feedback
  would be appreciated. More information on <a href=\"http://www.bombsites.co.uk/index.php?id=17\">my
  website.</a> <!--break-->\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\n\r\nEd\r\n\r\n*It has been pointed out
  to me that Mudtyper supports kerning, unfortunatly Texter can't as dynamic text
  in flash doesn't support kerning.\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Hi Ed,\r\n\r\nIt looks quite nice and I'm sure it will find its usage. But
    it could be a problem, that nothing in a flash file is secure. There are some
    handy tools around that can extract anything from a flash file. The nature of
    a font previewer is to test the font, so you have to include the all common characters
    and it will be delivered as outlines. \r\n\r\n--<a href=\"http://www.astype.de\"

  body: "Yes, I know that embedding fonts like this can be seen as a security risk,
    but there are steps to be taken to secure the fonts and pretect copyright abuse.
    The guidelines <a href=\"http://wiki.novemberborn.net/sifr/show/Protecting+Commercial+Fonts\">here</a>,
    show 1) how to someone \"prevent somebody from downloading the .swf file and using
    it on their own PC and potentially taking the font file\", and 2) restrict someone
    using the .swf file from a different domain. \r\n\r\nI'm not sure how water-tight
    these steps are. But I'm sure circumventing them is a lot harder than going to
    the wrong places and downloading the whole of the Adobe library (for instance).
    I don't think this method is less secure than posting a sample PDF is it?\r\n\r\nI'll
    look into the security side of things over the next couple of days and report
    back.\r\n\r\nThanks for the comments,\r\n\r\nEd"

    me</a> any details about the tool? I don't want to be offering something that
    is insecure. I have been experimenting with .swf decompilers that claim to turn
    the .swf back to a .fla, but I'm not able to extract any useful data. The fonts
    just get exported as another .swf, which ought to be, again, useless.\r\n\r\nCould
    someone really just take Gotham out of the header on this site? If this is real,
    then putting fonts in flash files is tantamount to freely distributing them.\r\n\r\nI
    really hope this isn't the case."

  body: "Yes. Thats right.\r\n\r\nThe issues are whether the safeguards work. So far
    I've not been able to get around them to the extent of getting anything useful
    out of the file. But I'll carry on trawling the dirty under-belly of the web for
    a bit to see if I can find something that can.\r\n\r\nI don't see how this can
    be any less secure than useing a font embedded in any other flash application.
    Most people seem to find that level of security acceptable.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime,
    If anyone would like to offer advice on how I can make it a better tool then I
    would be very grateful. I am working on the ability to select different typefaces
    via a drop-down list. This should be ready by the end of the day (London time).\r\n\r\nI
    have discovered that it is possible to batch process the .swf via the method shown
    <a href=\"http://www.communitymx.com/content/article.cfm?cid=243EE\">here </a>.
    Which could save anyone who wants to use this a lot of time.\r\n\r\nDo people
    find it works well and efficiently? I'm stuck here on a 2.2Mbit connection, so
    find it hard to judge what it is like other connections and other places.\r\n\r\nThanks
    for the help,\r\n\r\nEd"

    my hosts must have left the work experience boy in charge while they went to lunch.
    \r\n\r\nSo there <strong>is</strong> a program that does claims to be able to
    extract .ttf files from .swf files. Which is quite scary. Have you seen it in
    action? Would it work if a non truetype font was embedded? (I guess it would)
    \r\n\r\nI think there are some important questions here. One thing to say it that
    Texter is no less secure than any other flash based apps out there. I guess there
    is nothing to be done about this? :-(\r\n\r\nThis is all troubling."

    any flash file back to an .fla project, so every flash file is open like any javascript
    or html file.\r\n\r\nA way could be to convert the font symbols, (every glyph
    is a symbol attachet to a global font symbol), to an grayscale image with alpha
    channel. I think this would work, but someone have to code such a conversation

    that is able to extract fonts, lying around on the internet in the usual dodgy
    places. So it is likely that if someone wanted to steal a font, they would have
    to actually buy the program first. Which seems to be against the ethos of most
    of the people we are worried about.\r\n\r\nStill, Texter is available for use
    if anyone is prepared to allow their fonts to be used in flash files. "

  body: "Thanks for the suggestions Andreas, I'm not worried about the .fla file,
    as sIFR is opensource, just peoples font outlines. \r\n\r\nI'm not a good enough
    coder to start playing with complicated scripts, this was just meant to be a simple
    alternative for displaying fonts made from readily available components. I wanted
    something like this for myself and had an idea how to make it happen.\r\n\r\nAs
    a summary, I guess putting (or allowing people to put) any font into a public
    flash file clearly has risks. Some people are prepared to take those risks, some
    aren't. These risks are obviously highlight for type designers. It is however
    much better to know about this than not.\r\n\r\nIf anyone would be prepared to
    risk putting their outlines in a flash file and thinks they could make use Texter
    let me know. It's been made now.\r\n\r\nThanks for the all the comments.  \r\n\r\nEd"

  body: "I have made some trys. If you export your pdf directly form InDesign all
    Type1 & OpenType CFF fonts will be included CID encoded. The \"spacing\" (glyph
    wide) will be set to zero or around zero. \r\nThere is a tool around - and some
    acrobat versions too, with the ability to extracting these data. But its hard
    to add an OpenType header to it. So in the end, the user gets the CFF encoded
    data and with the right tools he can import the glyphs into FontLab. But everything,
    mapping, spacing, kerning, OpenType features are lost. In case of a large OpenType
    font like Zapfine Pro, you must be a really informed font developer to get some
    usage out of it. \r\n\r\nSo its cheaper to license the fonts. But all depents
    on the method of how a pdf will be generated. Some people made it with the default
    distiller functions and the encoding will be preserved. This happens a lot on
    simple Type1 fonts.\r\n\r\nIn general I recomend setting up nice specimen files,
    but to avoid the showing of whole alphabets or to made special bitmap renderings
    of these pages and include these pages into the \"normal\" pdf.\r\n\r\nBut you
    have to generate the pdf files without these full alphabet pages, since you can
    delete a page afterwards, but the font data will be untouched.\r\n\r\nExample:\r\nspecimen
    file showing samples on page 1 and all glyphs on page 2.\r\n\r\n1. Generate the
    pdf from InDesign.\r\n2. Print page 2 as Bitmap file into a new pdf.\r\n3. Generate
    the same pdf file without the last page showing all glyphs (page 2)\r\n4. Attach
    the bitmap pdf to the last generated pdf (Step 3.)\r\n\r\nSo you have a nice printable
    specimen file but without all the glyphs in it. \r\n\r\nBut its just a suggestion
    to made it real hard.\r\n\r\nBack to the flash issue, its a matter of time if
    this tool or any other is spreaded over the net, and its an easy click and save
    to TrueType function, not possible today for pdfs. But even this can change.\r\n\r\n--<a
