  I couldn't help thinking \"okay cool, but what I really want to see is examples
  a double where they are different - and are not ligatures.\" The example doesn't
  have to be typographic. In fact, it is likely not to be.\r\n\r\nSo here is my request
  : do you have faves? If so post them please. I am interested to what if any patterns
  might emerge. Thanks!\r\n\r\nTriple & quad examples also most welcome! And other
  letters eg. double a, y , g etc too if you like."

    doubled in African orthographies to indicate long vowels; these would be used
    contextually when a vowel is doubled:\r\n\r\n{a e o u} -> {a.narrow e.narrow o.narrow
    u.narrow}\r\n| {a a.narrow e e.narrow o o.narrow u u.narrow}\r\n\r\nBut the effect
    has to be so subtle in order not to stand out that it didn't seem worthwhile,
    and I'm not convinced there is any benefit."

  body: "<em>Does Latin have any words with a double \u201Co\u201D?</em>\r\n\r\nVery
    few. You get compounds along the 'cooperation' line: cooperio, cooptatio, coopto,
    etc. These are usually seen with hyphens, though, to emphasise that the oo represents
    two vowels sounds, not one.\r\n\r\nDoubled vowels in Latin are always pronounced
    independently. In ecclesiastical pronunciation, this extends to foreign names
    so, for instance, Aaron is pronounced A-aron (something which become obvious as
    soon as one encounters it in Gregorian chant notation)."
