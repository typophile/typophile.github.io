  body: "The spacing and alignment looks great. The effect on the type is intersting
    - how'd you go about it? The only thing that's really bugging me is that \".net\"
    is on a different baseline then the other words.\r\n\r\nI think a Lakers fan would
    be happy with it!\r\n"

  body: "Thanks for the kind words chadbrewer.  The characters were hand drawn in

    CS2 is a real time saver now that you can set strokes to the inside or outside
    of a fill.)\r\n\r\nHere's what the logo might look like in its natural surroundings...\r\nhttp://images5.theimagehosting.com/heynow.12.jpg\r\n\r\n\r\nI'm

  body: "Looks good to me too, the shorter t version pulls it together, my only real
    concerns are the G the upright (bottom right) looks a bit thick compared with
    the rest of the logo and the L and G could do with a touch more space to their
    right.\r\nTim"
