  body: ' The outlines of Verdana you clearly can&#39;t re-use. But the bitmaps are
    a more confusing issue. If you just took the Verdana bitmaps and made them all
    fit a fixed-sized box, I think it&#39;s not ethical to redistribute &#40;you could
    always use it yourself&#41;, even though it might very well be legal. <BR> <BR>On
    the other hand, there are few ways to make bitmaps at that size, and if you pretend
    you made them yourself nobody can complain &#40;but you&#39;d need to hide the
    association&#41;. It&#39;s better to get permission, but considering it&#39;s
    MS you&#39;re extremely unlikely to get it... <BR> <BR>I think your only real
    recourse is to start from scratch and make a mono bitmap font, perhaps visually
    compatible with Verdana. The bonus with this approach is that you can fine-tune
    the letterforms to better fit the mono space. The outlines you&#39;d have to make
    yourself &#40;or re-use a public source&#41;. But I see no problem with &#34;Veranda&#34;
    - it&#39;s actually nice, especially when you consider that it&#39;s a wide and
    flat design.  :-&#41; <BR> <BR>hhp '

  body: While I mostly agree with you, I&#39;ve just found out FFF Star &#40;<a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/fontsforflash/fff-star/"
    target="_blank">http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/fontsforflash/fff-star/</a>&#41;  by
    Fonts For Flash &#40;<a href="http://www.fontsforflash.com/" target="_blank">http://www.fontsforflash.com/</a>&#41;,
    which is a 8px bitmap font based &#40;imho&#41; on Verdana. <BR> <BR>I don&#39;t
    follow the if-they-steal-I-can-steal-too philosophy, and I know nothing about
    them, but they&#39;re selling FFF Star by the light of the day, via MyFonts, so
    maybe, and I say maybe, a thing like this is perfectly legal. <BR> <BR>If so,
    and I still doubt it, I could distribute my little font to the six persons who
    asked me, and sell it to the one who was willing to pay for it... <BR> <BR>g.
