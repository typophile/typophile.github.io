  Bergquist]] (John Baskerville), 2003(?)\r\n\r\nBaskerville 1757 is an attempt to
  re-create [[John Baskerville]]'s original type such as it was really meant to look
  \u2013 on paper, and not in some sanitized universe of ideal shapes. This means
  that the proportions of the text sizes have been preserved, and the tendency to
  pare down hairlines and to prettify serifs and other detail work has been firmly
  resisted. Also, this version contains only what Mr. Baskerville himself wrote: Roman,
  italic and small caps\u2013 no anachronistic boldface.\r\n\r\nFigures are lowercase
  or 'ranging' text figures of course. Those who occasionally need uppercase or 'lining'
  figures will however find them in the small cap font . Roman and italic ligature
  fonts are available, as the period design makes these not only desirable, but actually
  necessary.\r\n\r\n<strong>External Links</strong>\r\n<a href=\"http://www.fountain.nu/catalogue/baskerville1757.asp\">Baskerville
