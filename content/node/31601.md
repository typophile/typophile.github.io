  of timidness. This is the first logo I've done which was solely typographical work,
  as I decided that was really the only way to go. So, I'm new to this, but please
  rip it to shreds! I need guidance in this new arena! :)\r\n\r\nSo - The company
  is Avari, jewelry wholesalers and retailers. They gave me free reign on the design,
  and originally I started with something way different, with color, and graphic symbol...
  Then I decided to do some research. \r\n\r\nI noticed the biggest names in the jewelry
  business (like debeers, scott kay, tiffany, etc.) Had no graphic symbols - what
  they are selling is not jewelry, it's their own name! So they use an authoritative
  serif typeface, as a general rule.\r\n\r\nI wanted to create something authoritative,
  to command respect, yet keep a level of elegance - they do sell jewelry, after all!
  So, I used a modified LYNN typeface, with caps, spaced pretty wide apart, and for
  the cross-through on the \"A\" I used a calligraphic brush and did it freehand.
  I did about 60 versions of this general style, 85 versions in all for the logo.
  I kept it pure white-on-black to keep it real formal, like black-tie.\r\n\r\nComments??
  Is the cross-through on the \"A\" too unoriginal? I had other versions which were
  more interesting, but I felt were too busy... Looking at it now, I think the letters
  might not be spaced evenly apart... what is a good process to do good kerning?\r\n\r\nThanks!
  :)\r\n\r\n"

  body: "My main issue with your logo is that it's not incredibly memorable (although
    the logos you mentioned are not especially distinctive either, except by their
    constant and consistent use by their companies). The curved A crossbar, as you
    said, isn't very original, but it especially doesn't say much to me about Avari.
    What do they see as distinguishing them from their competition, if anything? What
    makes the name \"Avari\" something that consumers should want in their jewelry
    collections?\r\n\r\nRegarding kerning, it's largely subjective, based on trying
    to create an even balance of black and white across the type. With that in mind,
    I'd definitely tighten up the space between the V and second A and maybe a bit
    between the second A and R.\r\n\r\nSomething that I and others on Typophile usually
    aren't fans of is using fake small caps, as you appear to have done here. By this
    I mean shrinking down capital letters to serve as small caps instead of using
    an actual small caps font. The problem that appears when you do this is that the
    artificial small caps end up being less thick and thus \"lighter\" than the regular
    capital letters -- check out the weight difference between the strokes of your
    big and small A's. My recommendation is not to do this small cap business at all:
    either make your logo all full-height capitals or use lowercase letters. If you're
    committed to the small caps look (which some feel conveys a sophistication, but
    I feel generally looks a bit phony), you should look for a typeface that has a
    small caps font.\r\n\r\nAs to your choice of typeface, I'm not crazy about Lynn
    -- I don't find it especially memorable, as you would want for a typographic logo.
    It's impossible not to mention Christian Schwartz's <a href=http://www.houseind.com/index.php?page=showfont&id=536&subpage=viewfonts>Luxury
    Collection</a>, which he created based on examining fashion and jewelry advertisements.
    I think that Luxury Diamond might work very nicely.\r\n\r\nThe typical ones to
    use for luxury logos are \"modernes\" (EDIT: I think I meant \"didones\") like
    Bodoni and Didot. Some alternatives might be <a href=http://www.veer.com/products/typedetail.aspx?image=SHT0000010#flont>Walburn</a>
    or <a href=http://emigre.com/EF.php?fid=97>Filosofia</a>. I would love to see
    you use <a href=http://www.emigre.com/fontpage.php?PFilU.html>Filosofia Unicase</a>
    to differentiate yourself. Generally, I'd like to see a jewelry logo that evoked
    the others in the field but at the same time was obviously unique. Two quick ideas
    that came to me (I don't know if they're good, but ...) are using <a href=http://www.veer.com/search/results.aspx?keyword=fournier&producttype=TYP&pricemodel=RM%2CRF>Fournier
    and Fournier Le Jeune</a> together, with a Le Jeune capital A and Fournier \"VARI.\"
    Fournier is the epitome of extravagance and ornament, so that could be a nice
    way to send out that message. My other suggestion is <a href=http://www.veer.com/products/typedetail.aspx?image=IHT0000138#flont>Zaner</a>,
    which has really terrific thick and thin strokes that could suggest elegance,
    well, elegantly. (On a side note, I guess I'm really promoting other Typophiles'
    fonts in this post. It wasn't especially intentional -- I must just have seen
    them recently)."

  body: "Numbers 1 and 3 are more interesting. However, I still have the problem of
    not learning much from the logos about the company. Maybe I could get a sense
    of refinement, but nothing to differentiate Avari from its competitors. Unfortunately,
    being that these are done freehand, they look a bit <em>too</em> freehand. For
    a logo, the most prominent part of an identity, you want it to be perfectly executed,
    and the crossbar swashes you've made aren't quite there. For example, the one
    in the third example above looks very shaky. If you want to continue with this
    concept, you should edit the curves of your crossbars in Illustrator to make it
    smoother and more uniform (like the outlines of a nice typeface).\r\n\r\nOthers
    may feel differently (type is often subjective), but for me, Lynn just isn't memorable.
    I am reasonably accomplished at identifying typefaces, but I would have trouble
    picking it out of a hypothetical lineup. Even if you're not crazy about the ones
    I suggested, take a close look at them, as well as some of the Adobe ones you
    probably have on your computer (Adobe Garamond Pro, Adobe Jenson Pro, Myriad Pro,
    Chaparral Pro, etc.). Try to get a sense of the little differences that make each
    unique. Maybe then you'll see what I mean: Lynn just isn't an especially interesting
    design, which is exactly what you need for a typographic logo. Possibly others
    can explain what I'm trying to say by agreeing or disagreeing with me."

  body: "\"I still have the problem of not learning much from the logos about the
    company.\"  I think sometimes, the logo doesn't have to give away too much. It
    might just give off a sense of something e.g elegance, sophistication etc, and
    not much else. If you want to convey something authoritative, then going down
    the simplistic route i.e typographic, is a good way to go. Unfortunately, this
    then leads to the problem mentioned above that it can be difficult to differentiate
    it from other identities, making it not particularly memorable.\r\n\r\nMaybe you
    could alter the font in someway to subtly (as auricfuzz is saying) communicate
    more. For example, you could try altering the counter of the 'R' or the 'A' into
    the shape of a diamond or jewel. I'm not saying this is the correct way to go,
    but offers the viewing public an extra dimension to aid with communication.\r\n\r\nI
    too don't particularly love or hate the chosen font, and in my opinion having
    the caps all the same height would look better.\r\n\r\nHope this is of some use?\r\n\r\nDave"

      head for what I was getting at. I am not trying to say anything at all about
      what the company *does*, hence the lack of any symbols. The big names (Tiffany,
      DeBeers) don't say anything, either. The name is what they sell, and the name
      is who they are. If DeBeers dcided to get into fragrances and dump diamonds,
      the transition would work fine, and it would be the New Hot Stuff, I bet. It's
      all the name.\r\n\r\nBut then, I am told the typeface is not memorable, so I
      need to work on that, if I'm trying to sell the name. :p\r\n\r\nThe other designs
      I showed, I was afraid their strike-throughs were *too* interesting, to the
      point that they were distracting and not clean enough.\r\n\r\nDoes anybody have
      comments on why DeBeers' and Tiffany's typefaces work? (and by contrast, mine
      doesn't?)\r\n\r\np.s. - why Avari would be better than the other jewelers? No
      clue. The owner didn't have a real answer. Without disclosing confidential information,
      he just has a different business plan."

    don't think those other fonts are good choices for this company, as I don't think

    I think what makes them more memorable, or interesting, is they seem to make more
    use of contrasting hard lines and curved edges. Lynn seems to be very straight-forward.
    I think Lynn has the correct feel, in the sens of severity and seriousness, all
    business, but now I think i'm growing to dislike, because of what you said...

    I like 2 and 3 better than 1 -- and maybe 3 slightly more than 2. \r\n\r\nI would
    suggest two things. First, even though Aviano seems better balanced than when
    you were using faux small caps, I'd still prefer if you made all the letters the
    same height. I think that having all capitals instead of small caps makes the
    design look classier and more timeless. Second, I can't be sure, but it looks
    like the diamond crossbar of the second A is slightly smaller than that of the
    first. I'd suggest you make them both the same size, even if you decide to keep
    the first A capital and the second A small cap.\r\n\r\nAlso, to clarify my earlier
    statements -- I wasn't necessarily suggesting that the logo needed to tell a whole
    story and be overwhelming in its symbolism. My problem was that looking at the
    previous logo, I didn't really \"get\" anything about the company, which to me
    suggests that the logos weren't distinctive or memorable enough. The flat diamond
    crossbars and the crossbar-less R just seem to work to make the new logo something
