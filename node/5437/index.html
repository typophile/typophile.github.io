I like it's feminine quality.However,it is very feminine and might alienate most of the male population. How is the place decorated? Your script style is quite elegent and sophisticated. I like the script in the top version but feel like the widow thing is a little much. I think I need more info for an accurate assesment.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Thanks, David, for the response! <BR> <BR>The restaurant will serve unique gourmet food, dinners will be quite sophisticated and &quot;fancy&quot; (like Macadamia Nut Crusted Sea Bass) and lunches will have a more casual feel (like Porcini-Gorgonzola Burgers). <BR> <BR>It is a long restaurant, half brick walls; the other half of the walls are painted with impressionistic european murals (many have the shape of the window in the top example.) The owners don't necessarily want any correlation to the &quot;brick&quot; or the literal name persay, but they do really like the unique paintings. <BR> <BR>Here is another sample that is just the script writing but not quite as &quot;much&quot; as sample &quot;f&quot;. <BR> <BR>Any ideas on how i might create a logo to represent the ambiance and type of food without being so &quot;feminine&quot;? <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/39728.gif" alt=""></div>

		<div class="commentbody">I don't think restaurant logos NEEDS to echo the specifics of the food. That's what the food is for&hellip;the food will generate its own reputation without the need of the logo. Of course, you need to hint at the differences between a drive in burger joint and fine dining, but I think that's about the extent of it. <BR> <BR>The logo should represent the 'vibe' though, IMHO. And I think yours does a wonderful job. I like both implementations and I think they can both be used together just fine. <BR> <BR>Is that your own calligraphy?</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I really like the hand-lettered look of Escrita, but I don't think the addition of the bricks does the logo justice. I agree with Scott's point about the versatility of a type-only logo. If the owners like the use of the brick imagery, I think it could be more effectively included elsewhere in some of the collateral, such as a separate, subtle graphic element on menus, promo materials, etc. The type-only logo is elegant and seems to fit your description of the restaurant on it's own; no need for added bells and whistles.  <BR> <BR>Nice work Sally!</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Sally &ndash; I may have been a little unclear, English is not my native language. <BR> <BR>What I meant: 'THE' was a *font*, the rest was calligraphy. And I thought that 'THE', being just three letters, looked out of place with the rest. And should be executed as calligraphy as well, to be in harmony with the rest. Another way of looking at it, if you were to keep the font, you would need more letters, say 'THE RESTAURANT' or similar length. Then it would be strong enough to play a role in a font/calligraphy contrast. <BR> <BR>Then I said (and you didn't understand this): while calligraphing the word 'THE' you can *still* make it capitals, and make it upright (regular) (not slanted), depending of what's looking good. <BR> <BR>Haven't said so yet, but I think you're a skilled calligrapher. <BR> <BR>And I think getting rid of the pictoral element I saw in your first posting was an improvement. <BR> <BR>Going to London for three days now, see you later. <BR> <BR>&ndash; <BR>S</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I agree with Scott. 'RESTATURANT' can't be placed there. You have in versions H and I created an unbalanced arrangement where all the elements are placed east-south-east of each other &hellip; (sorry, if my English is inadequate: first 'the', then a little down &hellip; then 'Brick', then a little down &hellip; and so on). <BR> <BR>Maybe, as Scott said you should drop 'RESTAURANT' underneath, and then, for balance, 'the' (or 'The'?) should be placed somewhere above 'ick' or 'ckLa' &hellip;  <BR> <BR>Whether or not 'RESTAURANT' needs a bolder face as regards to signage &hellip; well that depends on the technique of the sign, the colours, the walking speed of the specific street and so on. Although I wouldn't make the so bold/heavy that it were to compete with 'Brick Lane' <BR> <BR>&ndash; <BR>S</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Yes, 'the' needs a little more weight, if the marks has got to be printed in small sizes. <BR> <BR>Determine what is the 'worst case' as regards to small size and printing on coarse materials. (Paper napkin?) Then look at the counters of 'h' and 'e' &hellip; do you want them to be filled when printing very small sizes? No? Well, then you have an indication of just how big and how heavy the 'the' should be. (But as Scott says, it shouldn't be very much). <BR> <BR>Have you considered/tried a capital-T in 'the'? It certainly would fit in with the rest as regards to style (calligraphy, old times and so on). Moreover, it wouldn't add some weight to the element. But then again, maybe it doesn't work &ndash; but it think it should be tried, before you declare the design finished. <BR> <BR>Looks nice now, positive as well as negative. I can just imagine it applied to signage, matchboxes, menues and so on. <BR> <BR>&ndash; <BR>S</div>
