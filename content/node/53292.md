    of Alejandro Pauls' style. Check out Veers' massive script collection to begin
    with."

  body: "Thank you very much. You just made my week!\r\n\r\nActually I started out
    wanting to make a connecting brush script and ended working in reverse, I liked
    the the solidity of the individual characters... much like they were individual
    marks. After I finished Pooper I did not think about joining them again until
    years later. It was a fun exercise that spanned almost 7 or 8 years. My son Jacob
    is now 10... he was the impetus for the font, so that should tell you when the
    font began and how long it has taken. I am now in the process of doing another
    variation of it... based on an alternating axis for terminal strokes. Maybe June!
