body: "Hello, I'm looking for a font similar to the attached gif below. I found a
  free one, Bujardet Freres. Obviously it is an automatically traced font simply imported
  in any font software. I would like to find a consistently designed type which follows
  the same structure of the pictured one. Now you experts, can you help me? I'd be
  very grateful for it.\r\n\r\nDaniele\r\n\r\n[IMG]http://i47.tinypic.com/2je1jps.gif[/IMG]"

  body: "The Bujardet Freres font is not the same as your sample. See the R -- it's
    not the same. [edit: neither is the N] I Looked in the Solotype Catalog since
    often these revivals can be found there, and the closest I saw was one called
    Tuscan Dotted (p. 36), but it was not identical. The R did have a similar leg,
    unlike the Bujardet font. I think if you searched on Tuscan, or Victorian, or
    1800s, you would probably see what's available in styles of this vintage.\r\n\r\n-

  body: "Thanks for the insight look, helpful, true they are not the same font. What
    interests me here are the finals of the latter, this flowery or horns style ornament,
    which I also believe is the main characteristic of this font. So, any other typeface
    that apply the same ornaments?\r\n\r\nthanks again\r\nDaniele"

  body: "Yes, I think that would often be found in the styles I suggested searching
    for. The way the terminals split is one characteristic of the Tuscan styles, which
    you might also find with the other search terms. Solotype, HiH and a few other
    foundries, seem to specialize in more antique styles from the late 19th century.
    That is the time period I think you want to look at.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
