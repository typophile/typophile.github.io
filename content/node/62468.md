  really clean and he does a lot of commercial work.\r\n\r\nThe idea for the mark
  is cast shadows of his abbreviated name. I thought it reflected photography without
  being clich\xE9.\r\n\r\nThe font is Museo. <3\r\n\r\nWhat do you all think?"

    tried to work a similar shape like that before, i could never make it submit.\r\n\r\nbut
    the F is interesting. i almost see in it a similarity to the focus box marks (the
    90 degree L on 4 sides)...\r\n\r\noverall the mark and typography is too large
    for the space (if this is a business card?)\r\n\r\nis photography a different
    font? why is it sooo opaque? it's barely visible"

  body: "Thanks for the feedback.\r\n\r\nIt's not a business card.\r\n\r\nI designed
    it on my plasma so I didn't realize how dim 'photography' looks on regular monitors
    until now. \r\n\r\nYes, the 'C' is a biatch. I actually used Illustrators 3d Bevel
    thingy. The 'F' turned out a lot thinner vertically so I widened it manually to
    make it more balanced with the 'C'. I didn't really touch the 'C' after the effect.
    What would you improve?\r\n\r\nCool observation about the focus marks, didn't
    see that.\r\n\r\n@mk2 - don't squint your eyes =)"

  body: "Here is another batch I created. I tried playing around with the \"C\" shape.
    The first 3 alike I wanted to represent the front of a lens.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/logocomps_5661.png]\r\n\r\nThis
    is a previous one. It's supposed to be an f and c shape but I think the f looks
    too much like an e. \r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/logocomps_1_3419.gif]"
