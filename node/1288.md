body: I&#39;m not precisely a historian of type, and so this question has been irking
  me lately... Where did the binocular g come from?  It looks to me like it evolved
  from a cursive letterform, but it&#39;s not accompanied by other cursivised forms,
  in most cases &#40;such as the 3-like z and delta-curved d&#41;.  &#40;Which is
  unfortunate, because I&#39;d love to see a face influenced by those forms.&#41;

    and Caroline Minuscule.

  body: 'Re-reading Gill&#39;s <i>Essay on Typography</i> I just found this: <BR>
    <BR><blockquote>&#0182;Again, take the letter G. The evolution of our modern small
    g is seen to be chiefly due to the prevalence of &amp; consequent familiarity
    with hastily scribbled forms &#40;see fig. 3&#41;. [below] Nevertheless, in no
    case does the scribe imagine he is inventing a new form; he is only concerned
    to make well or ill the form with which he is familiar. <BR>&#0182;By the sixth
    century a form of writing obviously more natural to penmanship &#40;see British
    Museum Harl. MS. 1775&#41; had been evolved. And the process continued until all
    resemblance to the Roman original was hidden &#40;see B. M. Add. MS. 24585&#41;.
    <BR>&#0182;I am not concerned to describe in detail the history of the process
    in its technical and economic significance. The point that chiefly concerns me
    is that, with whatever tools or materials or economic circumstance &#40;that is
    hurry &amp; expense&#41;, the artist, the letter-maker, has always thought of
    himself as making existing forms, &amp; not inventing new ones.</blockquote> <BR>

  body: I think just looking at the g in most samples of Carolingian Minuscule will
    give you a good idea on how to shift between the different g-forms back and forth
    in history. The more you&#39;ll get, anyway, the most complete the picture will
    be. Gill&#39;s example may be misdirecting, since the samples are all redrawn
    by himself. &#40;Hi, Nathan, anyway! Hope you&#39;re OK! <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"

  body: the evolution of the capital A is also pretty interesting - morphing through
    time and much usage from a basically stylised ox head, with the apex originally
    facing down, to what we see today.
