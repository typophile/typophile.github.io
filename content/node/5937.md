body: Hi, I&#39;m working on the re-design of a sports magazine. I&#39;ve decided
  upon Olsen as the text font and I&#39;m looking for a sans to use for heads, decks
  and sidebars - and therefore need a font with a variety of weights and itals. At
  the moment I&#39;m using Trade Gothic Cond for heads and regular for sidebars. I
  also have Akzidenz, Eurostile, Futura, Helvetica, Interstate, Franklin Gothic, Gil
  and Univers as possible alternatives. Olsen has double storey a&#39;s &#43; g&#39;s
  should my sans have the same? or should it contrast more? Any suggestions from what
  I already have, or should consider to purchase would be appreciated. thanks.

    post didn&#39;t make you cringe too much. Max is a great font, will be ordering
    it when I finish this post. <BR>Thanks again, <BR>Kirsten

  body: Morten, I&#39;m a big fan of FF Olsen - as you might remember last year I
    asked you if there was a PDF available, and you said you were working on one.
    Is it ready?  :-&#41; <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>
