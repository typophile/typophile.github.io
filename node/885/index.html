<div class=commentbody>The two popular votes -which were arguably resorted to because the "official" jury vote was unpopular- were typographic, but that jury vote itself was lettering. Very nice lettering, but lettering. And the International Boating Association wouldn't use an airplane skywriting its name on their shirts. <br> <br>hhp <br></div>

<div class=commentbody>I love the shirts we ended up with last year - and there were a lot of entries to wade through. I only hope this year's contest will bear similar fruits, and we see some design concepts not seen last year. Perhaps if we limit the number of submissions one can submit, designers will be more selective about what they send in. IMHO, Rich Roat <a href=http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/2009.html>described it best</a>.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Hey, I personally discuss <i>chocolate</i> on Typophile! Lettering obviously has a lot of synergy with type, even more than aviation has synergy with boating... So it's fruitful to discuss it, at length even. I do it myself, to the extent of the little I know about it. But discussion aside, it's not crazy to think that something as singular as a logo on a mass-produced t-shirt benefits by being focused on the topic. The two popular-vote shirts didn't have the superb execution of the jury winner, but they were more appropriate, more in tune with the entity they were conveying. <br> <br>I might be sounding like a fundamentalist, but focus in a visual piece is a virtue, right? <br> <br>-- <br> <br>I was wondering why the jury chose a lettering piece. Because it was well-executed? Or if you look at the jury members, you might see a tendency to favor "organic" things. I love animals, but if you don't really like type that much, maybe you shouldn't spend so much time with it? John Downer for example is a highly skilled and talented letterer, and he seems to be increasingly focusing on that instead of type design. I still hope he has some great secret type design he'll spring on us (I mean besides Paperback, which so far is disappointing), but if he's more in harmony with lettering, why force it? Focus is good. <br> <br>hhp <br></div>

<div class=commentbody>Look, I don't know precisely why my design was chosen (although I'm happy and grateful it was), but there was nothing in the guidelines saying you had to use type. Other than including the name "Typophile" and sticking to certain practical limitations, pretty much anything could qualify. <br> <br>A purely typographic solution is an obvious choice for a Typophile shirt because of the general subject matter, but that's just one possibility. Why limit it to that? And, after all, the other one that was chosen (which I think is a really cool shirt, by the way) was an <i>illustration</i> and didn't have any more type on it than mine.</div>

<div class=card-body>
<div class=commentbody>The submitter's responsability is limited to the piece(s) submitted, not the <i>result</i> of the competition. The result is the responsability of the organizers* and jury. As for the submission guidelines, I don't think it would have been smart to have a strict typographic requirement (that would have potentially excluded genial non-typographic submissions), but maybe a nudge in that direction would have been helpful. I mean like in your case, since you make great fonts as well as lettering, it might have prompted you to submit a typographic piece instead, and it might still have won! On the other hand, such a nudge would have to be endorsed by the jury, and I'm not sure they would have gone for it. <br> <br>* To be fair, the organizers did a superb job overall (as I've said before). The only thing that was a no-no was allowing submissions from Typophile staff. <br> <br>> the other one that was chosen ... was an illustration <br> <br>Yeah, but not of a dog or broadnib pen or a paintbrush, but of a <i>typecase</i>. Plus the original version (which for some reason lost the "California Job Case" punchline) had type in it. <br> <br>The kind of shirt I personally would have ideally liked to see chosen would convey the passionate and technical discussions of type that we have here. It's hard to do that without being trite, and I know that my own submissions failed pretty badly overall. <br> <br>All I know is, this is type-land, so the ideal shirt would be typographic. <br> <br>hhp <br></div>

<div class=commentbody>re: allowing submissions from Typophile staff. <br> <br>C'mon, is that so wrong? As designers ourselves, we had a few ideas too. (Actually, Joe was the only one to toss his designs into the ring) - but since we are divorced from the selection process (one was chosen by a panel of judges and the other by popular vote) I see no harm in it. <br> <br>I think the trick here is selecting a shirt that looks <i>cool</i> and not <i>overly geeky</i>. The job case shirt has a nice ambiguity to it, so only type people get it. That said, I'd say we've shipped equal amounts of shirts - no one of the two is clearly dominating the race. <br> <br>jb</div>

<div class=commentbody>> is that so wrong? <br> <br>Come on, man, are you kidding? Why do you think it's a standard clause in any reputable competition? Usually not even blood relations are allowed to participate! <br> <br>When it comes to public perception (for better or worse an integral part of our social reality), it's not enough to have good intentions, you have to steer clear of any <i>potential</i> damage to your reputation, especially when you have so little to gain! It's common sense, man. <br> <br>Can you imagine if Joe's entry had won? What would people think? Could you really blame some people from having their suspicions? It's not like they're your best friends and can have total faith that you're "fair" guys. So in the end you're damaging Typophile's reputation. And what do you really gain by allowing staff submissions, besides an ego trip? It's a <i>bad idea</i>, and you need the self-discipline to hold back. <br> <br>> no one submitted with their names attached. <br> <br>But the names would have -and of course did- come up at the end. <br>Even before the end, when you consider that the popular vote did provide the names. <br> <br>> "light-lettering" <br> <br>Yeah, I remembered that too! Superb thread. <br> <br>hhp <br></div>

<div class=commentbody>Hrant, that's good food for thought. It definitely crossed my <br>(our) minds last year and clearly there are trade-offs. In the <br>end, I (we) just wanted to raise the bar and ensure a shirt <br>we could be proud of (and wear!) was in the running. Toward <br>the middle of the contest it was very clear there were plenty <br>of good options and I quit submitting. <br> <br>In the end, when the designs went to the judges, they were <br>all presented anonymously. The judges didn't know they <br>picked Mark Simonson's design. <br> <br>Anyone else feel like 'staff' submissions dilute the <br>credibility of the contest or of Typophile? I tend to think <br>that if we were a corporation it would smell fishy, but that <br>since our whole mantra is open collaboration that I want to <br>contribute just like anybody else. On the other hand, we <br>will be receiving more corporate sponsorships of this <br>contest this year... <br> <br>Sorry, my thoughts are all over the place. But, the last thing <br>I would want is for someone to cry foul or feel the contest <br>was somehow loaded or unfair.</div>

<div class=commentbody>> Toward the middle of the contest it was very clear there were plenty of good options and I quit submitting. <br> <br>You might have even pulled your submissions out. Anyway, the past is the past, and I'm sure the Typophile Tee contest will be [even] better this time. <br> <br>> I'm not sure my name has that much chachet in the type world, Hrant. <br> <br>Well, it wasn't just you, and "cachet" can be negative too. Anyway, my point was that seeing the organizer of the event in the list of people to choose from is awkward, and it distracts from making a sound decision. But hiding the names wouldn't have been the ideal solution, Joe not participating would - even if that means less good work for the jury/members to choose from. <br> <br>BTW, what do you guys think of giving paid members of Typophile multiple votes or something (assuming you [have to] do a popular vote again)? <br> <br>hhp <br></div>

<div class=commentbody>Depends. One major factor is the scope, or scale. <br> <br>((speaking generally) <br>If you had a competition among a small, tight-knit online community, <br>or among a group of friends, with the <br>winner getting a pat on the back, then the question of <br>whether to include staff submissions wouldn't be an issue. <br>The overriding factor would be, Let's have some fun. <br> <br>When you include big-name judges and cash and prizes, <br>when you get exposure at major design portals, <br>then you widen the scope and heighten the expectations. <br> <br>So Jared and Joe now have to weigh <br>the joy of submitting and the competitive desire to WIN <br>against the perception of wrongdoing should one of them win. <br> <br>That's a tough call, but it's easy for outsiders. <br> <br>Last year, this issue was discussed, if only briefly. <br>Because I was going to be involved in producing the <br>Tshirts, I renounced <br>my eligibility. It can't hurt to err on the side of caution. <br> <br>At the same time, I can see where J&J are coming from. <br>Some of the initial designs were lacking, and Joe's pride <br>kicked in + they conceived this online type oasis, <br>and they spend money out of pocket to make it hum. <br>It must be weird not to be able to submit to your own contest. <br> <br>(you could still create stuff, submit stuff, post stuff, get feedback <br>and just refrain from sending your stuff to the judges) <br> <br>? <br> <br>anyway, I would hope that we don't suck all the fun <br>out of this before it even starts. <br> <br>that would suck. <br> <br> <br>bj</div>

<div class=commentbody>> i'm not going to think that there's a "conspiracy". <br> <br>Just to be clear, me neither. When it comes to Typophile, I have faith in Jared and Joe, otherwise I would mind that they are the de facto "kings" here*. But you can be sure somebody will complain (probably right here on Typophile) and create malaise. <i>And again, for what real gain?</i> <br> <br>* <a href=http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/30/6294.html target=_blank>http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/30/6294.html</a> <br> <br>As for the "just have fun" thing, I guess there are different ways of having fun. Some people can have fun just organizing something like this and seeing it come through so well (and I suspect J&J did enjoy that aspect). You can't eat your cake and have it too.
