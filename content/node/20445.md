  body: "Since it has been mentioned, how about something to prevent a missed close
    italics command? I often get a page where italics is used, and not turned off
    and every following message is in hard to read italics.\r\n\r\nIf a &lt;/i> and
    &lt;/em> was inserted at the end of every message by the forum software, it would
    prevent this from going beyond a single thread."

  body: "well it would be better for the software to search for an open tag and only
    put a tag where they don't find a closing. But anything to get it working i suppose!!\r\n\r\nAlso
    what about getting rid of the annoying click to activates? Pretty easy to use
    another embedding method and you can get great search engine rankings with the
    replacement content!"

  body: How about an option to view long conversations on a single page? And how about
    a "lite" site, sans-Flash for visitors on the %2 of computers without Flash installed?

  body: "what do you mean long conversations on a single page? You mean like 100 posts
    per page or something? I find that pages also have way more posts per page than
    most forums. Maybe an option to change this setting in your account would be helpful?\r\n\r\nMy
    view on the 2% of people without flash is they need to install flash... But you
    could put in some good replacement content for search engines for those without
    it!"

    a topic runs onto the second or later pages.

  body: "One thing I find annoying is the larger text settings of the first post as
    seen on Macs. On PCs the first post is the same text size as the reply thread.\r\n\r\nThe
    larger text size on Macs is fine for just a few sentences, but on long copy it's
    unwieldly. I've been reluctant to start off a topic with long copy. Instead, I've
    posted the main idea and followed it up my own reply adding the longer copy."

    use IE, Firefox and Netscape as well.\r\n\r\nGuess I don't have to be afraid of
    long first posts. One is forthcoming soon. Thanks for the input."

    within a day or so. I just as soon focus in on what attendees feel would be most
    useful. I've got to pear my presentation down in order to keep the "snore factor"
    down ;-)

    complaining until I realized nobody else was seeing that. Much better with Safari.
