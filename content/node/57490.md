  a pixelfont on a grid. I haven't drawn numerals yet, but I'm thinking it would be
  good to have old style figures as well. Being a large pixel font, I think it should
  be no problem.\r\n\r\nWhat do you think?\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Borobet_6191.gif]"

  body: 'It being a large pixel typeface, it is nice and readable, and has some nice
    serifs to it.  Because of the density of lines at the bottom of the lowercase
    A, the lowercase A looks a different weight to the rest of the typeface.  '
