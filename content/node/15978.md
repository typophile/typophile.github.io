body: Any help in identifying this typeface and/or locating where it might be purchased
  would be greatly appreciated. My thoughts are that it does not exist in digital
  form, but as metal type. Either way, I would greatly appreciate any information
  or leads.  Thanks!

  body: "It looks like a condensed and redrawn version of either MT Old English Text
    or BT Cloister Black - they're both very similar. Then it has had a fancy engraved
    drop shadow added to it.\r\n\r\nIf it's only a piece of one-off display setting
    you're doing, it occurs to me that you could fake this digitally by setting the
    line in the MT Old English Text (even Linotext would do at a pinch) at 100% black,
    duplicating the type with an offset to the right and down a bit, sending the offset
    to the back, tinting it with a 50% screen of black and setting a custom line halftone
    (around 60 degrees and 60 l.p.i.) on it. If you're working in either Illustrator
    or Freehand you can also use the outline stroke feature to fatten up the drop
    shadow so it goes right around the foreground type."

    body: "Thanks for your feedback, but it's neither Old English or Cloister, I have
      both fonts and neither has the curly 'e.' \r\n\r\nWe duplicate this font all
      the time using high-res scans, but it would be much more convenient to have
      it as a digital typeface. I should have specified that the line shading isn't
      part of the typeface, but yes, you're right, an added feature."
