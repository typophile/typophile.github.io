<div class="post-content e-content" itemprop=articleBody>I need to find a typeface that when you see it inmediately you think: Latino América.
Is there such thing as »recognizable« Latin American typefaces? or typefaces that people
could define as such, as is the case for example of Cheltenham, Century,
News Gothic, Goudy in North America?
Thanks
Patricia</div>

<div class=card-body>
<div class=commentbody>That's a very good question. There are certainly fonts that stereotype Latin America, or have been used so often for Latin American content that they have become falsely associated with the culture (<a href="http://www.fontshop.com/showfont.cfm?fid=LH.398.0.0">Lithos</a>).
For something authentic I'd look to almost anything by <a href=http://www.kimera.com.mx/mac/tipoinicioing.html>Gabriel Mart&#237;nez Meave</a>.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Hello,
first is very difficult (almost impossible i think) to estabilsh a identity concept about latin america. We are multicultural, plural and each country have different cultures and reallities.
For a panorama o latin america prodution in the last years take a look in this website:

<div class=commentbody>Patty, latin american typographic scene has been under great efervescence during the last three or four years. Since then some quality foundries have appeared and as Stephen Coles noted every place is developing it's own characteristic work.
Gabriel Martínez is a must, he is actually the most oustanding mexican typographer, but south america -specially Argentina- has a more developed type scene. To my eye Alejandro Lo Celso's work has a very refined latinamerican taste.
I can only say that there is not enough tradition in latin american type as to have characteristic faces yet. If I had to define the distinctive characteristic of latinamerican typefaces of the last years I would say that chunkyness, quirkness and organic angularity, but there are as well another trends towards, voluptuosity and roundness.

Stephen you are right about Lithos (help!); but which other fonts stereotype Latin America outside Lithos or Optima? (Only to know for not to use them and break the chain)

<div class=commentbody>Well, Optima could qualify as a latin american looking face as I find that it shares some similarities with Gabriel Martinez's work.
A very popular byble edition the "Biblia Latinoamericana" is set on Korinna, indeed many ITC and Bitstream "ugly" faces with a naive charming intention may match this kind of look such as Belwe, Benguiat, Seagull or Souvenir.
I think that the essencial characteristic behind this look is the hand carved or hand made quality, which is present in many in the previously posted examples.
Stephen, you're welcome.

<div class=commentbody>Interesting, Hrant. According to <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fauvism>this</a>, <em>fauve</em> is French for wild beast.

<div class=commentbody>That sounds very general. My instinct would be to go for something sharp and modern, to avoid various stereotypes. There are good links in posts above from rafaelneder, rs_donsata, and Miguel Hernandez. Not to beat it to death, but Latin America is a big place, and not at all uniform. Best of luck.</div>

<div class=commentbody>I'm with the folks who advocate avoiding stereotypes. I live in an area that has a 40% Hispanic population, and there are a couple of free Spanish-language newspapers available at the bus stop I use every day to get to work. Every now and then, I pick up a copy and use my VERY limited knowledge of Spanish to see what's buzzing among many of my neighbors. Being typographically inclined, I also notice that there is precious little, typographically speaking, to distinguish these publications from the others, all written in English for English speakers, that are available at the bus stop.
So, if you want to know what constitutes up-to-the-minute Latino typography, visit Spanish-langauge websites, go to a library and check out their Spanish publications, or hang out at bus stops.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Or typefaces are different, as much as they have a purpose to meet.
But I think is true that one thing is how people from other parts of this world think of what will convey Latinamerica, (using Hrant word, or how expats think they have to portray themselves to the eyes of other cultures: <br>(the stereotype-face),

<div class=commentbody>Bureau Grotesque (once labeled as having "too much salsa" by the AD of Time Mag.), Giza, Rhode and now FB Titling Gothic are all working hard down there. In addition, Cyrus' faces, like Prensa and Dispatch do very well. We've been doing a lot of custom work and licensing in L.A. (admittedly a huge place), over the past 10 years. I'm not sure if this is because we speak the language (literally), or our fonts do, but having exchanges with designers, editors and publishers every week, if not every day, also helps. By and large, I feel L.A. publications, ones that must attract L.A. audiences in the 100's of thousands, are drawn to organic, hand-made-looking and humanist inspired fonts rather than modernist, computer modernist styles, or anything "Germanic" (whatever that is). We are expecting to see, in the next 2-5 years, much more home rown design there and expect it to go along these same stylistic lines, but who knows. </div>

<div class=commentbody>That makes sense, William. I read most of the thread in one pass, and assumed David was replying to Hrant's comments about Los Angeles.
Hrant, thanks for the pointer to "El Universal." A handsome newspaper, that one.</div>

Which ones would you recommend for Corporate Identity?

<div class=commentbody>I actually wouldn't recommend Zocalo for a newspaper. Although technically it seems super, it simply has too much character. News is better told by a balding middle-aged man (sure, with a Jalisco accent) not by a morena Acapulcan vixen. Here's an example of what I mean:

It's really way too... ¡festive! in a context like this. Unless maybe you're a Palestinian whose home has been razed or something.

<div class=commentbody>Patty, go for the cliché if this is what your audience can easily digest and understand, I don't suggest you should use Lithos or Latino Pack (but if it works fine then it must be ok) but we also must remember that strong conventions are necesary for plain understanding.

<div class=commentbody>Hrant I actually like Zócalo a lot on El Universal, it has the exact amout of energy needed to tell the news, because news usually have a very strong flavour in México, not to say this is the common place or healthy practice but many newspaper's most popular section is the "red news" (la nota roja).

Ha ha! How about if the typographic voice has flavor AND the headlines are written to match? Forget the illusion of objectivity, go for the local identity, right down to the editorial and design voices.
I've always thought there should be colorful, genuine TV announcers with lots of subjective flavor to their reports. Not everyone needs to pretend to be "fair and balanced". </div>

<div class=commentbody>Patty,
I wouldn't say there's a particular type to associate with Latin-America, since our foundries -when printing started in America- used European material for their labour (mostly). Even though, modern attempts have been made. Héctor's fonts are a good example, in my opinion.
....................
I am not sure if the following can help you, but anyway I post it. These are some qualities I have noticed in present, hand-drawn lettering in my homecountry (México). Maybe it could help you when choosing your type. At least, the display type.
Corrosion (due to climate factors or to cheapness of materials)
Irregular baselines
Elaborate -almost Victorian- ornamentation (outlines that outline outlines!)
Lack of mechanical precision
Colour explosion (primary colours). Words might even have different colours to them in a single sentence.
Mixed use of serifs in the same "font".
Mixed use of bold type along with italics set in smaller sizes and in diagonal angles.
Lots of ornamental "dingbats" like stars, dots, lines...
A lot of signs are still done by hand and not by computer. A colleague of mine has a formal training in Graphic Design, but still makes hand-rendered signs for several clients.
There's even a design style in vogue in México called Feísmo ("uglyism" is my free translation of the term). Some fonts have been made with that approach in mind (I recall "Luchita Payol" from Edgar Reyes, another colleague of mine- you can ask him for samples at fabrikavisual@hotmail.com).
.................
Of course there are stereotypes, but stereotypes are not to be avoided without a second thought. Stereotypes have the great advantage of aiding in easiness of communication. I have seen lots of (in my opinion: farfetched) type from US products that try to depict Latin-America. Although they seem to me to be more a Tex-Mex result, they actually convey the flavour of the latin countries to the US people due to repeated media exposure.
..................
I wouldn't say Lithos would be the wisest choice. I would go for a more grungier contour...

I am living in München. If I can be of any further help for your project, feel free to contact me at moshdesignerERASETHIS@yahoo.com

<div class=commentbody>Its hard to tell what is a latinamerican type. I m thinking about music and I could not say Piazzola is more or less latin than Shakira or Cafe Tacuba... so different fonts will talk about them, right?
we dont have tradicional latinoamerican text font but a lot of display ones that I feel represent latinamerican spirit like <a href=http://www.sudtipos.com/fonts-mariabrug.htm>Murga</a>, <a href=http://www.sudtipos.com/fonts-candombe.htm>Candombe</a>, <a href=http://www.sudtipos.com/fonts-habanos.htm>Habano</a> and maybe some others like <a href=http://www.sudtipos.com/fonts-portenia.htm>La Portenia</a>

<div class=commentbody>thanks all for the neat input, I certainly have a broader idea of how to approach the project if it materialize.
In the mean time…I think I am in love with El Dorado and its lucious italic.
Talking about Oxtail, in the beggining I didn't see what you were saying then I tested it and indeed it could work, the tail and the counters (d, b specially) give a nice twist to its egyptian origin.
