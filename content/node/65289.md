  the menubar font as well as the fonts listed underneath the folders.\r\nThe second
  is a screengrab from an artist's website.  I think it is a variation of a familiar
  font.\r\nExcuse me, but I just recently begin falling in love with typography.  I
  have a lot to learn!\r\n\r\n"

  body: "What a blast from the past :-) \r\nI think OS 9 used Chicago for menu bars.
    Can't remember what the smaller font is, sorry.\r\n\r\nThe font in your second
    image looks like Courier (probably Courier New), check if you don't already have
    that on your computer, it comes with\u2026 uh\u2026 OSX maybe?"
