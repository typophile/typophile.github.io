body: "Ugh, I can't decide on a name for this font!\r\n\r\nI narrowed it down to either
  \"VAS DEF\" or \"Tubers\".\r\nBut now I can't decide between those two.\r\n\r\nI
  took a poll on Facebook, Twitter and Flickr,\r\nbut the results came out pretty
  even. \r\n\"Tubers\" got a few more votes, but\r\n\"VAS DEF\" had a much louder
  fan base\r\nwho type in all caps a lot.\r\n\r\nI like both names, but I feel like
  I really\r\nneed to just pick one. So I need some help.\r\nFont pic is below I think.\r\n\r\nWhich
  name do you like better?\r\n\r\n-chank\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/tubers_v_vasdef_6109.jpg]"

    the standard weight. (Otherwise...VAD DEF is fun)

    a long name.
