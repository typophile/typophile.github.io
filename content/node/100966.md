body: "I did a search first and found several helpful comments from H\xE9ctor but
  could not find an answer for this. \r\n\r\nI'm setting the text for a friend's family
  history. He is a scientist and very well-read, but I am not sure if his typographic
  style is correct. He grew up in Chile, but his family is from Asturias in northern
  Spain, so the book is intended for family members in both Chile and Spain. At the
  moment, he is using commas and hyphens in places where I would use en-dashes and
  thin spaces. For example:\r\n\r\n. . . prerrom\xE1nicos, -conocidos tambi\xE9n como
  en arte de la monarqu\xEDa asturiana- , como son las Iglesias . . . \r\n\r\nHe is
  setting off the phrase at the front end by starting with a comma (closed up right
  next to the end of the word), then a word space, then a hyphen immediately preceding
  the first word of the phrase. At the end of the phrase he follows the last word
  immediately with a hyphen, then a word space, then a comma, then a word space, and
  then the first word of the next clause.\r\n\r\nWould this be correct usage for Chile
  and Spain? Or can someone suggest a different approach? It makes me nervous to see
  a comma all by itself, with a space on either side.\r\n\r\nAlso, to confirm something
  that I read about Mexican usage in an earlier post from H\xE9ctor, when I am setting
  ranges of dates I should use a hyphen and not an en-dash? As in . . . los siglos
  XVI-XVIII . . . ? Is this correct for Chile and Spain?\r\n\r\nMany thanks,\r\n\r\nBruce"

    with en-dashes with no space on the \"insides\", but certainly no commas.\r\n\r\nSo
    like this:\r\n. . . prerrom\xE1nicos \u2013conocidos tambi\xE9n como en arte de
    la monarqu\xEDa asturiana\u2013 como son las Iglesias . . . \r\n\r\nBTW is that
    \"en\" supposed to be an \"el\"?\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: Thanks, hrant. That is certainly a clearer way of expressing it. Yes, I was
    typing quickly so the "en" was indeed supposed to be an "el"!

    we don't use the comma like that. Remove the extra space."

    books, and so one can look at Spanish-language books to see how they're typically
    punctuated.
