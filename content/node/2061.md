    subtle. It looks more like the type is butting up against her head. I almost said
    you should move the type. Hmm. Maybe Alice should go lower?

    areas of type, not be distracted by an even mass of color. As you said its alot
    of information for a poster. Could you make the logos at the bottom of the page
    smaller? All those different designs are visually disturbing. Especially the Acad---
    logo by alice&#39;s foot. She&#39;d hurt herself if she stepped on that one. Dan

    80% of what you have now. and perhaps following the grid a bit tighter. <BR> <BR>In

    white space. <BR> <BR>Possibly smaller body type by about the same %, but I&#39;d
    keep the line spacing. <BR> <BR>Also try de-emphasizing <i>from</i>. Maybe bring
    the top of the A in Alice up to the Bottom of the S in Songs. Then fit the from
    in the hole between the i and g? You might need to either go with a heavier weight

    Try something wildly asymmetrical &#40;maybe using alice&#39;s line of vision

  body: i think it feels waaaay too crowded.  the illustration of alice is just stuffed
    in there, being contained by big words...  i&#39;d free up some white space. <BR>
    <BR>it&#39;s hard to look at the poster near the bottom.  all the overlapping
    and different styles and numbers jammed together is a little illegible.  i mean,
    i can read it if i try, but it&#39;s messy.   <BR> <BR>i made some quick adjustments
    in photoshop to show you a way to free up some white space and make the overall
    poster be balanced.  the typography, however, i couldn&#39;t look at in detail
    because it&#39;s a low-res screenshot... but i reworked the overall compostion.   <BR>
    <BR>one other thing to think about is why is the leading for the top information

    IS that top info? <BR> <BR>let me know what you guys think. <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/20482.gif"

    the typographic layouts are something i couldn&#39;t change in photoshop easily,
    and i would&#39;ve stuck to the grid if i was working in illustrator.  i think
    the title arrangement can be better.  all i did was made it smaller and moved

    me. <BR> <BR>First of all, the size is A2 &#40;40 x 60 cm&#41;, which is why  <BR>I
    was hesitant to go smaller with the type. Randy&#39;s  <BR>remark and Loren&#39;s
    tinkering convinced me otherwise,  <BR>so thank you both. Also Eduardo was spot
    on with the  <BR>grid remark. On the other hand, it&#39;s always been my firm  <BR>conviction
    that the grid only stays in as long as it helps.  <BR>If it starts to hinder,

    border=0> <BR>IMO the big plus of this scenario is that it gives a sense  <BR>of
    purpose to the whole lay-out, as I explained to  <BR>Randy earlier on. It conveys
    the &#34;Through the Looking  <BR>Glass&#34; symbolically, it creates a narrative
    as Alice  <BR>actually looks at the title and it also parallels the  <BR>whole
    &#34;skewed reality&#34; concept without having to do  <BR>anything too literal.
    <BR> <BR><i>&#62; the text on the bottom looks really crowded now</i> <BR><i>&#62;
    I agree with Chris, though, that the text at the bottom  <BR>is too heavy. Would
    doing it only in the Mrs. Eaves,  <BR>with caps for months work?</i> <BR> <BR>Well
    you can&#39;t win them all: the text at the bottom  <BR>is organized in a calmer
    fashion &#40;less type sizes,  <BR>everything flush left, see HD&#39;s remark&#41;
    and most  <BR>importantly leaves a maximum of white space available  <BR>for the
    thing that really needs to catch the eye of  <BR>the people: the illustration
    and the title. Setting  <BR>the dates in Gothic No. 13 allows me to control the  <BR>focus
    points: what do people need to learn when they  <BR>look from a distance? What
    is going on and when. Once  <BR>they&#39;re interested they can come closer and
    read the  <BR>rest of the information. I think it&#39;s difficult to do  <BR>better
    than that on a small poster &#40;40x60 cm&#41;. <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"
