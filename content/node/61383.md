body: "A question often rises about book designing - should the overall design of
  the content, and the choice of typeface in particular, reflect the historical context
  of the text? Robert Bringhurst, among others, dealt with this matter in \"The Elements
  of Typographic Style\", suggesting that a relation between form and content is preferable.
  Other designers, like Jost Hochuli, seem less cathegorical. I'd like to add a little
  contribution by suggesting you to take a look at how John Morgan and Gareth Jones
  managed to treat aesthetically Oscar Wilde's \"The Picture Of Dorian Gray\", in
  the Four Corner Books edition. I haven't seen the book phisically, but the reasons
  behind the designers' choice are very interesting: \"For this new edition of the
  book, artist Gareth Jones re-imagines the story as a costume drama set in 1970s
  Paris, in a large format edition that returns the book to its origins in a magazine\".
  The fonts used are ITC Benguiat for the headline and ITC Garamond for the body text,
  both related to Seventies magazine style. An insightful review of the book has been
  published in a recent issue of \"Grafik\" magazine - a very useful reading for understading
  the designers' choices.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.fourcornersbooks.co.uk/Dorian.html"

    Brit artists tend to be big on gimmicky ideas, with rudimentary skills at actually
    making things.\r\nThis Four Corners series could be compared to a \"ghost written\"
    book.\r\nSo let's hope the real designer was well paid.\r\n\r\nThe Dracula sounds
    interesting--a different typeface for each character--wow, what a brilliant idea!
    LOL."

  body: "I think that the historical context should indeed be considered when choosing
    typeface.  I work for a library system in the southern United States and we have
    our own \"press,\" mainly focused on reprinting local historical texts.  I am
    the \"design department\" for these efforts, and I am constantly looking to original
    text samples (when available) to aid my choices.\r\n\r\nFor example, I am in the
    process of re-designing a medical dissertation text from 1849, and am fortunate
    enough to have a scanned copy of the original typeface available to reference.
    \ I have been able to find two fonts that come very close to matching the original,
    and am doing my best to present the text in a very similar way as that original.\r\n\r\nWhen
    making these decisions, the audience is another important consideration.  For
    most of our projects, the audience is \"old-world local;\" little old ladies and
    good ol' boys who want to preserve the \"heritage\" of the local area. As a consequence,
    I mostly don't venture into anything too modern, unless the subject matter calls
    for it or presents some room for re-interpretation.\r\n\r\nVery good, very thought-provoking
    question, ncaleffi...!"
