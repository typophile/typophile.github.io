body: "Hello, \r\n\r\nI have been trying to identify the black font on this invitation
  for the last 2 hours, using various apps and font identification sites, but with
  no luck.  I figured I should ask some experts! The most unique letters are definitely
  the lower case \"s\" and \"g\", which extend below the other letters and overlap
  when next to each other.  \r\n\r\nI would greatly appreciate any help anyone can
  give me. \r\n\r\nThank you! \r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/DSCN6566-1-1024x767_5820.jpg]"
