  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Hi, <BR>The logo will go on the heads of the guitars, and is the first name of the guitar maker. The woods are generally dark so I'm picturing this in white or cream, although if I can figure out how to get it to look good in metallic gold, I might go that route. Anyhow, after some sketching, I've cleaned up my favorites a little and here they are. Please let me know what you think, and I'll rework the best ones some (well, a lot) more. <BR>Thanks, <BR>Brian <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/64445.jpg" alt="guitar logo roughs"></div>

		<div class="commentbody">I don't know that I would necessarily worry about what kind of music these guitars will be associated with. If they are good guitars you won't want to limit the market and the market will in turn not want to be limited. By that I just mean most guitarists who are in it for the long haul don't only own one guitar because they can't create all the sounds they want to with one guitar. Their &quot;vocal&quot; range is dependant upon several different instruments. <BR> <BR>When I saw these first sketches, the three on the left were more interesting to me, the bottom two being stronger than the top. The bottom being expected, not necessarily a bad thing, and the middle being the most interesting. The bottom could have a little bit more of warmth by adding more of that wedge serif you've used on the R. The monolinear nature of the middle though needs to be pushed and explored. I'd say play with contrast.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I asked a few questions, and he (Henry) doesn't ever plan on making electric guitars. I haven't asked about tuning key colors but I will soon. <BR>He and his friends basically just play classical guitar music, like maybe something you'd hear from eric clapton. Some fingerpicking, but also using a pick, or strumming by hand. Nothing heavy, and nothing country. I do think the middle two are off because of this, but I'll try a few more revisions on just the middle-left one.  <BR>I think the bottom left may end up being the best so I'm saving it for last - I think the single-stroke E would mirror the R really well. <BR> <BR>In the meantime, here's an update on the first one. Thanks again for all the thoughtful comments! <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/64683.gif" alt=""></div>

Think dirty, rough, customised, worn; the blues to me (I'm a big fan) is all about feeling, emotion, empathy; try and get some blood, sweat and tears into the logo.

		<div class="commentbody">I almost didn't mention any names because I don't want to have too specific of a feel. The main thing is that it will go on acoustic guitars that don't need amplification. Some other ideas I'm trying to go for are: natural, man-made, and quality. <BR> <BR>This version is an angled script like D'Aquisto, Fender, and Gibson. I think the logo should look like a guitar logo, but hopefully it can still be unique.  <BR> <BR>I'm also concerned about the loop in the H and the loop in the y balancing. Also the n is not at exactly the same slant as everything else (it's baroque! -er, not really) so that the left stem of the n didn't get too clogged up where it meets the e and the stroke at the top of the n. I took out a small wedge at the top of the n to help. I'm not sure how much this will come into play if we need to screen it. But maybe this non-perfect angle makes it seem less mechanical. <BR> <BR>I do still want the final logo to feel personal and have some character even though I might not be going directly for 'blues'. So I just might end up giving it some texture, as long as it doesn't take too much away from any quality aspect.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I think all of the slightly irregular things in the logo (the loops' balance, the n slant) actually contribute to it's 'authenticity', it'd look too mechanical if everything slotted together too well IMO. <BR> <BR>That said, I would maybe bring the H loop down a little, so that the left stem of the H has a bit more length to it &ndash; this may help the balance a little too without looking deliberate! <BR> <BR>Jordan</div>

		<div class="commentbody">All right, I think I owe another update. As you can see by the posting dates, this isn't a rush project! <BR> <BR>I gave Henry four different &quot;directions&quot;: <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/67763.gif" alt="directions"> <BR> <BR>He chose the third idea. I'm pretty sure at this point that we'll be using a gold decal. The area for the logo on the guitar is fairly small - roughly 8p x 3p. The pegs &amp; hardware will be metallic gold, and the wood is a fairly dark brown. After many adjustments, including redrawing the grid, here's what I came up with. <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/67764.gif" alt="whattya think"> <BR>Since the gold lettering will show up lighter than the brown wood, the reversed logo is probably more accurate.

While looking at the fi (good catch!), I also noticed that the 'ry' ligature is too tight, creating an optical illusion almost (The further back you are when you look at it, the more you can't tell where the r ends and the y starts). In (b), I tried making the r-y joint rounded, but pulling the pen back inside helped define the r, especially at small sizes, so in the last version (f) I redrew the joint so that it was the same style but spread apart more. <BR> <BR>(a) is the version from the last post. (c) and (d) show two versions of the h, to get rid of the appearance of &quot;fi&quot;. <BR> <BR>I also spaced the letters out more. This helped them match up with the new 'ry' spacing and also made them easier to identify. <BR> <BR>The letters involve a few sharper angles where previously there were curves. Also, the first downstroke on the h, n, and r have a bit of a flair, and this also happens on the upstroke of the y. I know this still doesn't have the personality of some of the previous logo versions, but hopefully that at least gives it something. <BR> <BR>Lastly, I leveled out the bottoms (e) where before I was keeping the 45</div>

These logos would work on any kind of guitar, and if Henry ever changes his mind about electrics in the future, you won't need to do a redesign. <BR> <BR>I really like the symmetry in a/a2 and b/b2. I also agree with Tim that the ry lig looks great in b/b2. <BR> <BR>Just a thought: what if you took the 'h' from c/c2 and rotated it 180 degrees to make the y? <BR> <BR> - Lex</div>
