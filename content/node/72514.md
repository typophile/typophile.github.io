body: "I've been looking for this brush script font for a long time with no luck.
  It's quite different from the most common marker script like <a href=\"http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/efscangraphic/flash-sh/\">Flash</a>
  or <a href=\"http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/ef/balloon/\">Balloon</a>. Any ideas?
  \r\n\r\nThanks a lot.\r\n"

    Slant</a> from the House Sign Painter set. Possibly a bit more stroke was added,
    but this is at least very similar to your sample. There were literally dozens
    of similar styles in the film type era, but a much smaller number were digitized.
    URW has some heavy brush scripts of this type, but I did not see an exact match.\r\n\r\n-
