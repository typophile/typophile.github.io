  body: Peter and Hrant, those character  <BR>combinations are a valuable bit of information.  <BR>Thanks.
    <BR> <BR>Mrs Eaves and Classica seem to take two  <BR>different approaches. Mrs
    Eaves tends to  <BR>connect characters while Classica likes to  <BR>share strokes...
    &#40;I&#39;m speaking in broad  <BR>generalities&#41;. Does the sharing of strokes  <BR>help
    or hinder readability? That lowercase &#34;ir&#34;  <BR>combo seems like a stretch.

  body: ' Peter, is that list off the top of your head? If so, it&#39;s still helpful,
    thanks, but could you possibly find something official/methodical for Swedish?
    That would be great. And even more important than pairs would be word frequencies.
    All my own data comes from cryptographic and linguistic analysis, which I have
    access to thanks to UCLA. Except for the Polish data which I can thank Adam Twardoch
    for. I&#39;ve been wanting to put it all up on my site, but... <BR> <BR>BTW, here&#39;s
    an idea: Could we have some kind of repository here on Typophile, where people
    submit frequency lists &#40;with info about the source&#41;? That would be killer.
    I&#39;d contribute whatever I had &#40;as long as I find the time to type it in...
    Or maybe I can do OCR&#41;. <BR> <BR>Ligature Style: <BR>The difference comes
    from the fact that Thierry is an accomplished calligrapher. And although I&#39;m
    not a big fan of calligraphy in type design, if tempered it results in some great
    ligatures, that&#39;s for sure. Yeah, some of them are pretty crazy, but remember
    that you never &#42;have&#42; to use a given ligature, but in any case each one
    is aesthetically superb. If you look at the &#34;AA&#34; in Mrs Eaves, for example,
    you can see it doesn&#39;t really &#34;sit&#34; very well. In terms of functionality,
    however, we could argue about which is better: constructed or painted ligatures.
    And of course that applies to type in general. I happen to think paint is for
    walls. <BR> <BR>Linguistic Hierarchy: <BR>In terms of Latinate writing systems,
    the main ones would be, in ~order: English, Spanish, French, Portuguese, German,
    Italian, and after that I wouldn&#39;t try to guess. But note that you might consider
    this order to be somewhat moot, because, for example: there&#39;s less piracy
    in Germany than in general; on the web Dutch has a disproportionate presence;
    and other factors. <BR> <BR>BTW, concerning &#34;customizing&#34; for languages,
    more important than ligatures would be spacing/kerning: it can have a very large
    effect on setting. For example, round-round shape-pairs have a very different
    frequency in English and French. And in English the word &#34;the&#34; is more
    common than fully &#42;half&#42; the letters of the alphabet, whereas since it&#39;s
    not as common in Spanish, you might sacrifice its spacing in favor of the &#34;ate&#34;
    string, for example. <BR> <BR>hhp '
