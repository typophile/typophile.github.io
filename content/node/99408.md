  body: "Looks very close indeed, though differing heights of 'l' and 'k' , the 'g'
    and in particular the position of the horizontal 'bar' in the 'e' aren't quite
    there. \r\n\r\nThe text was taken from the film of the same name released in 1948
    if that's any further help. Possible custom font?\r\n\r\nThanks again!"

    hand-lettered, although of course sometimes based or modelled on commercial typefaces.\r\n\r\nAny
    particular type of fonts used in \u201948 that you\u2019re interested in, or just
    any fonts commonly used at the time?"

  body: "Thank you for the response Grafenburg.\r\n\r\nIn answer to your question,
    I'm interested in US fonts in common use in 1948 and more specific ones! (Please
    excuse the long explanation below...)\r\n\r\nMy focus on '48 is that it dates
    the coining of the word 'beat' by Kerouac and thus the start if the 'beat' movement.
    (Not to be confused with the later manufactured, madison avenue 'beatnik' trends
    of the mid 50's to early 60's!).  Thus, early fifties fonts would also work I
    think.\r\n\r\n I'm looking to put selected phrases/words used by Kerouac/Burroughs/
    Ginsberg etc into typefaces that fit the period/style. I selected the above 'he
    walked at night' font as these gents used typewriters but I'm interested in other
    serifed/ stylized fonts too!\r\n\r\nHave established that 'palatino' was created
    in '48 but that's about as far as I've got so any other suggestions/ thoughts
    would be very gratefully received!\r\n\r\nThanks in advance for your help\r\n\r\nSteve"

    really click with type aficionados) would be finding fonts that convey the right
    feeling no matter when they were made.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    the era than to strictly stick to fonts from that time. \r\n\r\nMany fonts look
    back, some look forwards. As a result many that were in use at the time won\u2019t
    convey the era to the modern viewer, no matter how true they actually are to it."

  body: "Fair points. Am still hopeful of achieving the look of the 'generation' whilst
    not being anachronistic. However, I do most definitely agree with you that font
    'date' is far less important than the right 'feeling'. A nice date would be the
    icing on the cake though! \r\n\r\nThanks for the feedback. Will drop a question
    on the design forum and see what comes up..."

    letterforms I used to create my font were from the 1923 ATF specimen book. However,
    once upon a time, things didn\u2019t become obsolete or fall out of fashion quite
    as quickly as they do today\u2026"
