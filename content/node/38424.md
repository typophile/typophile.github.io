  body: "Frutiger is often used for wayfinding, and is one of the great sans faces
    of all time. \r\n\r\nFrutiger is probably as close to 'perfect' as you are going
    to find, but I'm not sure if you want perfect. In a hospital you don't usually
    have to look at signs from long distances, so I would think that the mood or look
    you want to create is most important. Therefore, you have a very wide range of
    fonts that are possible. \r\n\r\nFor example, Bliss is a warmer sans than Frutiger,
    and that might be a nice lift of mood in a Hospital.  "

    could also depend on the particular hospital, and also the wayfinding model. \r\n\r\nWe're
    working on signage for a hospital where corridors run for about a 100mtrs from
    main nodes (where directories are placed). Facility pointers need to be readable
    from at least about half that distance. For that project, by the way, Myriad has
    worked quite well. "

    the site is \xABmodern\xBB and offer the best medical treatment. At the same time

  body: "Hi there:\r\n\r\nDoes the hospital have an existing identity? Your choice
    needs to fit in with existing graphics otherwise it may cause confusion and convey
    a \u201Chodge podge\u201D unprofessional quality. This can trickle down into how
    people perceive the hospital.\r\n\r\nMyriad and Frutiger are tried and true for
    the purpose, but hardly groundbreaking (I like Myriad better). Maurea is lovely.
    Scala Sans is excellent for way-finding, but if not used correctly can be industrial
    and clinical- use warm colors and graphics. Look at Metro.net as an example.\r\n\r\nArrival
    does not have condensed weights yet.\r\nChevin may be too trendy if not used correctly
    for a hospital- it's nice tho. Clearview is just not attractive and too masculine
    for my taste- a Meta Highway? However, it does have a complement of extensive
    weights and styles.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/PreviewofUntitled_5703.png]\r\n\r\nAnd
    speaking of Meta- if you combine Meta with Frutiger you get AXIS by Akira Kobayashi...
    it will cost you a pretty penny though, but its better looking than Clearview
    or Meta and fresher than Frutiger or Myriad. It is expressly designed for way-finding.
    I know- its an offbeat choice.\r\nhttp://www.typeproject.com/index.html\r\n\r\nOthers
