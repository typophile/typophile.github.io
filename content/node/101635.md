  body: FindMyFont is wrong, this is not Bebas, /R is totally different (as /M, /C...).

  body: proportion-wise, it's frustratingly close to berthold akzidenz grotesk condensed
    with a hefty stroke...(?)...

  body: "@bojev: you're right, Bebas is close but that's definitely not it unfortunately.\r\n@tashddl:
    thought also to Akzidenz-Grotesk Condensed Light but wasn't decided to accept
    it as an answer (artifiacially emboldened). I can bring at the moment only 2 more
    similars: [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/typetrust/heroic-condensed|Heroic Condensed]]
    and [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/canadatype/trump-gothic|Trump Gothic]]\r\nBTW,
    what's the sample origin? That could make the search easier...\r\n"
