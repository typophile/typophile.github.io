body: Its been a while and I need a (fairly extensive) refresher, as my understanding
  of the application is fairly limited. I'm wondering if anyone has a tutorial recommendation?
  I'm thinking books are the way to go, though if anyone swears by another format
  (dvd, etc) I can give it a shot. Thanks!

  body: You could take a night course. I took one years ago (I think it was UDA).
    It's definitely a good way to immerse yourself in it. They're usually one night
    a week for 4 or 5 weeks.

  body: The best resource I've found for Flash is the f1 key [Flash's online help].
    Seriously, force yourself to read the help manual. Then as you are using the app,
    you will remember enough to at least know what is possible, then you can refer
    back to the manual for the specifics. I still use the ActionScript help quite
    a bit, and I've been doing it for years.

  body: There are many authors who are experts on Flash and most other main user applications
    and it seems they are all putting out DVDs. (Aside) I'm wondering how far Adobe
    will change its interface when it becomes one of their products? The reason I
    mention this is the new release of Micromedia Suite (8?), maybe they will keep
    it a separate product line, competing against itself. I hope I didn't give the
    evil empire any thoughts.
