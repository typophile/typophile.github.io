  body: "It must be <strong>[[http://www.findmyfont.com/index.php/fonts/font-preview?fset=Dafont-1&ffam=Adolphus%20-%20Regular&fid=17e67c69c7d0f26badf62e2875bea9e4&fsize=60&text=Smile%20Center&wrap=2|Adolphus]]</strong>
    free font by Adolfo Rojas with a modified /S.\r\nNote though that this font looks
    like an outline theft of <strong>[[http://www.findmyfont.com/index.php/fonts/font-preview?fset=ITC&ffam=Mixage%20ITC%20Std%20-%20Book&fid=576c4b9b486163eb238124008f352f25&fsize=60&text=Smile%20Center&fit=1|Mixage
    ITC]]</strong> by Aldo Novarese (1985), therefore I strongly recommend to use
    the original font and modified it to suit your needs, rather than using the knock-off."
