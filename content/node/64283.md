body: I'm looking for a list of typefaces that were in popular use in Britain from
  1920-1970. used in posters/book design/advertising etc. Separating them by decade
  would be extremely helpful. Does anyone know of any resources or know of any off
  the top of their head? Many thanks!

  body: "Thanks Jeffrey,\r\n\r\nYes that is very good although I was possibly thinking
    of trying to avoid it because of the over use, but maybe It should be used anyway,
    Im also aware of Transport, Johnston, Joanna, Perpetua etc. that were created
    around this time, and also some of the slab serifs that were popular in the 1930s.
    But I was also wondering if anyone knew of anything a bit more unusual or interesting. "

  body: "Your tackling a very vast timeframe, and a lot of things have happened and
    changed in this period in design. Trying to pin it down to a list of typefaces
    is hard, because some might have been very fashionable in the 30s but quite out
    of style in the 50s. As I said Gill Sans immediately comes to mind (and Joanna
    and Perpetua are also by Eric Gill). Johnston is a typeface that shares characteristics
    with Gill. So I guess that's a very recognisable British style. Unless you want
    to go for the full on design history approach, I would advise you to narrow your
    field of vision down to a smaller period. And then have a look at british graphic
    design from that period and try to find the common thread, or formal simularities.
    There's probably design anthologies of British graphic design you can have a look
    at. You can always return here to find out which typefaces are used in those designs.
