  body: "Oops, sorry, I did not mean to make a dramatic announcement that goes front
    page. I was simply updating my profile! My point was just to say that I am not
    keeping a blog here because I have one elsewhere, just in case someone clicked
    on the link to my blog. Now that this has been automatically put front page, I
    might as well give explanations. (Feel free to disregard this self-indulgent post!)\r\n\r\nDavidikus
    is my blog. I often describe it as:\r\n\r\nDavidikus is the visual diary of an
    exile in London. David is almost exclusively a photoblog, in English and in French
    about all sorts of things happening in the life of its owner, in London, Paris,
    Rome, Milan, Rio de Janeiro and other places...\r\n\r\nDavidikus is not the chronicle
    of my life. Davidikus does not show extensively all that I do or eat (I am sure
    you will be grateful for that). Davidikus is about sharing photographs of what
    I have seen and I have like or dislike, what has shocked me, intrigued me... Davidikus
    is about what struck me.\r\n\r\nDavidicus means \xAB David\u2019s \xBB or \xAB
    of David \xBB in Latin. There were too many Davidicusses on the web so I decided
    to call the blog on my work Davidikus to give more visual rhythm to the second
    part of the word - & as an inconscient  homage to Zeiss Ikon. I was reminded later
    that I always complain people replace the mute c in my last name (Ranc, pronounced
    [r\xE3] or /r\xE3/) with a very loud k (Rank). Therefore, Davidikus means \xAB
    David Ranc\u2019s \xBB or \xAB of David Ranc \xBB. \r\n\r\nDavidikus is not a
    typography blog but there are some pictures of type in use (often \xAB vernacular
    \xBB inscriptions, type sculpted in stone, cast in iron etc.), or lettering. Davidikus
    currently showcases a type I am working on (called Bergamote).\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/logo

    now: oblivion! Apologies again.\r\n"
