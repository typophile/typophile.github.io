  body: The weird thing is that in the bolder weights of Koch Antiqua &#40;and its
    clones&#41;, the design changes quite a bit. So there are weights that are closer
    to the weight in the sample, but with the wrong detailing. It makes me think there
    is an alternate version of Koch Antiqua, perhaps under a different name. Maybe
    something from an old photo display font, for instance. Then again, maybe they
    just took a bold weight and modified it to look more like the light weight. That
    seems the most likely explanation to me, the more I think about it.
