  to uni to study medicine (and escape design!). Unfortunatley, I need to recreate
  the logo and the main office don't seem to be able to tell me what their font is
  (or in fact have any high resolution versions of their logo for that matter... meh!).\r\n\r\nAny
  ideas? It would be great to know what both the logo font and the \"global health,
  local issue\" text are if possible. You can see it [[http://http://www.medsin.org|here,
  at the top of their site]].\r\n\r\nThanks in advance for your help and for being
  such a great resource!\r\n\r\nGomi."

    pretty close to [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/adobe/myriad/|Myriad]] (may be
    Semi-Condensed Black). There are also [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/typodermic/expressway/|Expressway]]
    and [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/fontbureau/interstate/|Intersate]] which have
    the right /d but look (far) less close for the rest.\r\nThe baseline is small
    but considering small details (spurless /G and /C finials) and that all work should
    have been done with \"free\" materials, I guess [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/mti/arial/|Arial]]
    would get you pretty close (if not matching)."

    like you say, with some extra editing on the 'd'). Thanks again for the quick
    response!"
