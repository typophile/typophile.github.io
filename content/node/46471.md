  Going for a compass, native woodcarving look.  I know the water drop is ubiquitous
  but, it is what the client wants.  I have it down to these three designs.  Input?\r\n\r\n[[http://www.cjeder.com/nwl1.png]]"

  body: "I like the second one. It's simplistic and after reading your blurb, noticed
    the compass impression. Do you have to use the abbrevated NW instead of Northwest
    in the name? \r\n\r\nWhat's the reasoning behind having a \"native woodcarving
    look\"? "

  body: NW vs. Northwest, I haven't worked with the type enough to have an opinion.  I'll
    take it that you suggest "northwest".  As for the native woodcarving look.  I
    want to reference the artwork of the pacific northwest Indians to keep the piece
    regional and highlight the cultural and environmental issues regarding the health
    of NW salmon fisheries (hence the orange color).

    in two.

  body: 'Isn''t salmon more of a peachy-pinkish color? As for the Native American
    angle, I don''t think it''s resolved in these marks, it''s almost too subtle.
    Perhaps instead of a style, you consider using a recognizable symbol... Off the
    top of my head, I see a simplified feather/compass illustration. Something three
    dimensional, but not overly detailed. '

    updated the colors, and tossed in a couple of extra options.  As for the native

    any reference you try to make to this style of art will be lost on most.

  body: "I can't help but notice Jayyy speaks from Florida.  Native art is very much
    a part of northwestern (and southwestern) culture, and I don't think the reference
    will be lost at all.\r\n\r\nThat said, I don't think the logo is quite there yet.
    The top two are my favorites in this last set, but I think you need more organic,
    woodcut-style lines like the salmon has. The top left one is interesting, but
    it's getting dangerously close to an 80's paisley.\r\n\r\nThe middle two logos
    look like a cat's head to me, and now I can't see anything else. They're just
    too symmetrical and sleek to look like Native art.\r\n\r\nOh, and not to sound
    hyper-pc, but I thought the label \"Indian\" was banished decades ago!? Where
    I grew up, it was just as bad as the horrific n-word!"

  body: "I like the top right one. It definitely reminds me of the Pacific Northwest
    Indian woodcarvings.\r\n\r\nThe top left looks like a heart to me (a real heart
    with valves and arteries).\r\n\r\nSomething about the \"NWWaterLaw\" text bothers
    me. Maybe it's the typeface, maybe it's the small caps...I can't put my finger
    on it."

    caught my eye as well. I think it's the absence of spacing between NW Water and
    Law. It's a lot of mixing caps, smallcaps and lowercase without much breathing
    room. \r\n\r\nI also agree with Eileen that you need to vary your line weight
    to help emphasize the organic nature of wood-carving. "

    my monitor, it's much closer to the actual color of salmon on the plate, ready
    to eat.  Additionally, by softening the color so much, the logo loses a lot of
    it's original boldness and vibrancy.\r\n\r\nJust my two cents..."

    better and less faint.\r\n\r\nThat said, I think you need to bump up to a semi-bold
    or bold so the text will hold its own against the thickness of the icon.\r\n\r\nDavid"
