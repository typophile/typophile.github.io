body: hi, <BR> <BR>i&#39;m looking to purchase, sooner or later, a font from John
  Baskerville.  I started looking around on the net and to my astonishement there
  are a lot of choices out there! I knew about the ITC and the Berthold versions &#40;book
  &amp; regular&#41;, but now I discovered that there are quite some big families
  &#40;with osf &amp; sc&#41; from new foundries like Stormtype &#40;<A HREF="http://www.stormtype.com"
  TARGET="_top">http://www.stormtype.com</A>&#41; &amp; Fountain &#40;<A HREF="http://www.fountain.nu"
  TARGET="_top">http://www.fountain.nu</A>&#41;.  <BR> <BR>So, type-experts out there;
  which one seams to be the superior design? Or the most versatile? <BR> <BR>mac&#43;

    the best Baskerville &#40;in the classical sense, I guess&#41; is the one by Monotype.
    But I&#39;m not sure what name that goes by now. <BR> <BR>And &#34;Revival of
    the Fittest&#34;&#42;&#42; hand-picks four Baskervilles to analyze: ITC New Baskerville
    &#40;low readability&#41;, Monotype Baskerville &#40;high contrast&#41;, Berthold
    Baskerville &#40;heavier, and lower contrast - maybe your best bet for setting
    small text in offset&#41;, and Mrs Eaves &#40;which is not very literal at all&#41;.
    <BR> <BR>&#42; Don&#39;t buy it - it&#39;s just a glorified specimen book. <BR>
    <BR>&#42;&#42; By Print Magazine. Some nice insights, but glaring faults as well.

  body: ' Depending on what kind of job it&#39;s for, I&#39;d pick either Mrs Eaves,
    Storm&#39;s John Baskerville, or Monotype Bulmer. All three are available in OT
    versions. Bulmer &#40;whose OT version you can now get through Adobe&#41; is a
    different font but a good alternative if you want to set your choice apart. '
