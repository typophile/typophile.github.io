  work. I was going to use the name \"Red Door Design\" until it came to my attention
  that there are a handful of existing agencies with the same name. \r\n\r\nSo I decided
  to use my last name instead \u2014 \"Aranda Design\" \u2014 and developed a logo.
  Interested to hear anything that anyone has to say.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Picture4_3430.jpg][img:sites/default/files/old-images/Picture5_5564.jpg]"

  body: I'm not loving the way the A makes the ends of the D curve. Would be better
    as a straight line I think.

  body: I was hoping someone would say something about that. My initial design used
    straight lines, but I thought it needed to tie a little bit better to the typeface
    of "Aranda Design". Though it seems I didn't quite hit it on the head. I'll post
    the other version later.

  body: "i agreed with picard, the curves at the end and beginning of the D does not
    help to see the A. it took me a while to see the A, i saw the pencil and didn't
    look further first - now i cannot not seeing it anymore. I'm not sure about your
    choice of typo, sure the style make it somehow personal designer but there is
    maybe too much difference about the A of the typo and the A of the logo.\r\nThat
    said about details, IMO your mark is great.\r\n"

  body: It took me a while to see the A, probably because it's bolder than the D,
    unless it is just an optical trick.

  body: "Thanks for the feedback. You guys are echoing exactly some of the things
    I was thinking myself. I just needed to see if I was over-thinking. \r\n\r\nYes,
    the A is bolder than the D. That was the only way I could make all three \u201Clevels\u201D
    work. I think if I ditch the curves at the ends of the D, the A should be more
    apparent. I rather like the typeface, but I see what you mean about the A's not
    being similar enough. The letters in the mark are based on Gill Sans. Maybe I
    should try that for the type. "

  body: i think the two are working, but i prefer the second, much much more Classy
    and pro, and the reference to the A is immediate.

  body: Yep, A is kind of hard to see, and without seeing it the mark looks kind of
    busy, because of the element count. Secondly, the mark has too much whitespace;
    basically the positive parts are way too thin and neg/pos balance is not there.
    Also, the concept is interesting, the bent pencil looks quite a bit unconventional
    and geometrically forced. Lastly, placing the mark between the words is not working
    for me personally. All in all, the mark has a lot of promise, but needs more tinkering
    with.

  body: Oh well, I think this one's going in the trash. Doesn't seem like people are
    picking up on it the way I thought they would. And I don't really see any apparent
    way to make it read any better.

  body: "Just a thought to share.  Have you considered alternate names?  Simplification
    is sometimes a great way to create impact and a clever name.  I would consider
    using just your initial \u201CA\u201D and the word \u201CDesign\u201D in a classic
    font like Helvetica or Bodoni.  Maybe the A in red and Design in Black or Grey.
    \ It could be a nice play on your name and a statement of precisely what you do

  body: "Ed, have you considered using a heavier weight for the D? I think the A just
    needs more to knock out of. You're right that it's not working, but I think it
    may simply not be working *yet*. Also, I strongly recommend not flanking the mark
    with type. It's too noisy and disruptive to the flow. Also, I think the mark needs
    room to read, as it is trying to use angular relationships to create an implied
    formal relationship.\r\n\r\nDon't give up!"

    stuff and give constructive feedback. Since I joined this forum, everyone has
    been nothing short of a class act, and that's something rare and worth appreciating

    and implement some of your suggestions. Look for some new comps over the weekend,
    as I have my hands and brain full with my eight-to-five until then."
