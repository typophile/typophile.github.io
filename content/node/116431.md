  body: 'Close but I think it''s called Nouveau by Alan Cairns and based on Rennie
    Mackintosh''s work. Check out this link to a Luc Devroye page: http://luc.devroye.org/fonts-54813.html'

  body: The copy of Nouveau that I have found has no copyright or creator information
    contained in the file. Guess we must trust Luc Devroye's info that it is by Alan
    Cairns etc.

  body: I have a printout of the original ReadMe file by Alan Cairns of Sechelt, British
    Columbia. he says quite a lot about the font, including that it was created in
    CorelDraw and put into the public domain, except for commercial use - in which
    case he asks to be contacted.
