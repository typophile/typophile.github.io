      of the <a href=\"http://www.cs.princeton.edu/~aahobor/Lucy-Day/Images/Movies-50/Batman-Forever.jpg\">logo
      for the movie \"Batman Forever\"</a>.\r\n\r\nAnd in fact, there is a font called
      <a href=\"http://www.dafont.com/font.php?file=batman_forever&page=1&nb_ppp_old=10&text=Teamworks&nb_ppp=10&classt=pop\">Batman
      Forever</a> which will do the job.\r\n\r\n(Okay, now that I've posted a link
      to Dafont.com, I'm going to crawl back into my hole.)"

    for a \"real\" (not free) font that looks like the Batman typeface, <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/russell-square/\"
    target=\"_blank\">Russell Square</a> might do the job.\r\n\r\n - Lex"
