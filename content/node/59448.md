  body: "Why do we use the term \"squooshed\" when it was obviously extended?\r\n\r\nJust
    curious. There were better descriptions for this effect in my early days of specifying
    type -- like pseudo extended, for instance.\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: It could be squooshed from the top. If you're stretching in one direction
    it could always be interpreted as squooshing/smooshing/smashing in the other direction.
    The result and the crime is the same.
