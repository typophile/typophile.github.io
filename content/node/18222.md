  good in font classification.. the only thing i wanna know now is WHAT DAMN FONT
  IS THIS? :)\r\n\r\ni tried whatthefont, looked through the text-serifs in bringhursts
  bible, looked through fontshop-catalogue, etc... its on my tongue, but my mind is

  body: "They are much better adaptors than inventors. In my mind most of their good
    stuff is not original but an interpretation like Monoline, Gridnik, or the Architype
    series. A lot of the \"original\" stuff came a year after something better in
    the same genre was released. \r\n\r\nProxima > Gotham > Context\r\nBliss > Sterling"
