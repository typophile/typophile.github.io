body: "Hi. I just started using Fontlab Studio 5. I have two questions:\r\n\r\n1.
  How do you delete anchor points? I select the anchor point and hit delete and it
  only deletes the point, not the accompanying line(s). In other words, it keeps the
  shape closed, just gets rid of the point.\r\n\r\n2. Where is the help section? It's
  not on the top right like other programs. And when I go to find the manual in the
  applications folder, all that is there is the icon for FS5. I did purchase the software.
  Maybe it's on their site?\r\n\r\nThanks in advance,\r\nPablo"

  body: When I click straight on an anchor point and delete it the outline will stay
    intact. When I draw a square around an anchor point (selecting it but not directly),
    deleting it will also affect the line it's on.

  body: "There are two operations: \r\n\r\n1. Removing a node while keeping a contour
    as close as possible to the previous shape. \r\n2. Breaking a contour. \r\n\r\nYou
    can use the Eraser tool to remove a node keeping a contour as close as possible
    to the previous shape, and you can use the Knife tool to break a contour. You
    can also right-click on a node and choose Break contour. \r\n\r\nAnd then, there
    is the operation of deleting a node. Depending on the settings in the preferences,
    it behaves like the Eraser tool or like the Knife tool (plus actually deleting
    the node). \r\n\r\nI think it might be useful in <strong>FontLab Studio 6</strong>
    if hitting Delete behaved the way it does right now (according to the Preferences
    setting), but that there would be two modifier keys, e.g. Alt+Delete always deletes
    the node while keeping the contour, while Shift+Delete always deletes the node
    and breaks the contour. Do you think it would be useful? \r\n\r\nCheers,\r\nAdam"
