  body: 'Just for a laugh, my last post to Mark &#40;and his earlier comment about
    needing a 12-step program&#41; prompted me to make the following List. Maybe some
    of you can suggest better/additional items? <BR> <BR> <BR>These are the Twelve
    Warning Signs that you may be a Fontoholic &#40;alt. spelling: Fontaholic&#41;:
    <BR> <BR>1. You dream about fonts. <BR> <BR>2. You tell other people &#40;who
    could not care less&#41; what font the menu is set in. <BR> <BR>3. You look at
    magazine ads to identify the fonts. <BR> <BR>4. You know the urls of over 10 font
    sites by heart. <BR> <BR>5. Your copies of font books are falling apart from being
    used. <BR> <BR>6. You know the names of over 20 type designers. <BR> <BR>7. You
    name things after your favorite fonts. <BR> <BR>8. It ruins your day when you
    can&#39;t think of the name of a font you KNOW you know. <BR> <BR>9. You hang
    out all day waiting for ID posts at newsgroups and forums online. <BR> <BR>10.
    You need to buy a bigger hard drive to house your font collection. <BR> <BR>11.
    You spend days developing elaborate font classification schemes for your font
    files. <BR> <BR>12. You hate it when you know a font, but someone ID&#39;s it
    before you do. <BR>'

  body: 13. You buy magazines &#34;for the articles.&#34; <BR> <BR>14. It ruins a
    movie for you when they use a typeface that didn&#39;t exist at the time the movie
    is supposed to take place. <BR> <BR>15. You can page through a 2-inch-thick font
    catalog without falling asleep. <BR> <BR>16. The first thing you do when you go
    to a used or rare book store is check to see if they have any type specimen books.
    <BR> <BR>17. You find it difficult to read sometimes because you&#39;re noticing
    the typeface.

  body: 'Great stuff. I sense a new thread coming.. <BR> <BR>No. 2 happens to me all
    the time. Sometimes people get downright hostile and act like I&#39;m a freak.
    Oh wait, we &#42;are&#42; freaks. And everytime I go &#34;Look! Futura Extra Bold!&#34;
    or &#34;Hey, it&#39;s Gill Sans again!&#34; my girlfriend acts like she doesn&#39;t
    know me. &#42;Sigh&#42; <BR> <BR>Another one that happens all the time: <BR> <BR>-
    People stare at you in disbelief for being an illiterate in these times when all
    you do is get a really close/long look at the poster/billboard &#40;to figure
    out if it&#39;s Helvetica Condensed or Franklin Gothic&#41;'

    <BR> <BR>You need a new girlfriend. ;-&#41; <BR> <BR>I&#39;m lucky. My partner
    is almost as much of a type freak as I am. She just has no interest in spending
    her time on sites like this.

    with really cool g&#39;s. <BR> <BR>Oh, and I, like Mark, am one of the lucky ones
