		<div class="commentbody"><p>Aren&rsquo;t these letters that have been cut from wood on a jig-saw? Do you know whether there is a complete alphabet? I ask this, because it&rsquo;s possible that these were custom made for this one name. Even if there were a full alphabet, the &lsquo;font&rsquo; may have been a set of templates from which to cut the letters, and not anything like a digital font for your desktop. (My daughter bought a set of letters for her daughter&rsquo;s name &ndash; not the same design &ndash; and they were evidently made on a jig-saw, cut following patterns.)</p>
<p>For something with a similar feel, this reminds me of Ray Larbie&rsquo;s <a href="http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/typodermic/jillsville/">Jillsville</a>. If you replaced the slab serifs with ball terminals (which I&rsquo;d guess was done to make cutting the pieces easier), the look would be similar, I think.</p>

		<div class="commentbody">Yes they do have the full alphabet, and its sold at 2-3 different retailers which is why i thought maybe they probably just had a font, typed it into the computer, and let the wood cut, such as many engraving companys do. I tried to email 2 of the sites, 1 had no clue as they said they personally do not make the letters. And the other said they could not give me the information i wanted. I cant get ahold of the 3rd site :(  But tyvm for finding one close as well.</div>
