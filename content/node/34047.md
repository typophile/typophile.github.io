  body: "Well, they are sloped in plenty of fonts that I've examined. It looks like
    it's a foundry by foundry policy, although the majority seems to favor no sloping.\r\n\r\nIn
    one sense, I understand the decision, in that sloped operators or other math symbols
    don't really have any meaning in the realm of math (at least not the math I've
    handled), like sloped or italic letters do. However, it's always been a pet peeve
    of mine that if I had a situation where I needed to use a sloped symbol for some
    reason I needed to hunt for one.\r\n\r\nAs a typesetter, I always preferred consistency
    of slope within a font and switching to italic as needed. As a type designer,
    I like the idea of including both within the italic version of a font, with sloped
    versions available as alternates (or the default, depending on preference) so
    they entire issue isn't driven by mathematical requirements."

  body: "When typesetting mathematics, geometric symbols (like equals, plus, union,
    brackets, etc) are never slanted.  Letters are frequently slanted, but most letter-like
    symbols (such as nabla and infinity) are not.  An interesting symbol somewhere
    in the middle is the partial differential, whose slant is often somewhere between
    upright and the italic slant.  Does anyone know if the partial differential has
    been traditionally viewed as a slanted character?\r\n\r\nI'm guessing that foundries
    that slant math symbols do so because just a few nonslanted symbols (such as a
    plus) in the middle of a whole bunch of italic text would look odd.  It's clear
    that the symbols are not intended for intensive typesetting of mathematics, since
    so many symbols are missing.  In fact, that often makes me wonder why foundries
    even bother to randomly include a few of the more esoteric symbols (such as the
    integral symbol).  Presumably anyone needing this symbol would need other technical
    symbols and would be using a more complete math font.\r\n"

    standard encodings.\r\n\r\nInteresting that you mention brackets Stephen -- those
    are usually slanted in italic fonts, on the assumption that they are not primarily
    mathematic symbols. So if those who set maths can choose between roman or italic
    fonts for things such as a/<em>a</em> and (/<em>(</em>, why not for the plus sign,
    the multiply, etc.?"

    body: "@Nick: <cite>these characters are in the standard encodings.</cite>\r\n\r\nTrue,
      and I guess if you want to adverstise a font as having such and such encoding,
      it should have all the characters.  However, we've seen enough errors (or questionable
      choices anyway) in the encodings to be a bit skeptical of them.  (For instance,
      the \"omega1\" Adobe name.)\r\n\r\n@Nick: <cite>Interesting that you mention
      brackets</cite>\r\n\r\nI think the sloped brackets are included in italic fonts
      because they can be used an non-mathematical symbols (ie, parentheses).  In
      general, mathematical symbols are pretty rigid, in the sense of having few alternate
      forms.  This is probably because the symbols are used so infrequently compared
      to letters, and because of the danger of ambiguity since math symbols often
      stand by themselves without benefit of a baseline or other symbols nearby.  Is
      it a slanted vertical bar, or a slash?  Is it a slanted plus, or a negated minus
      sign (whatever one might use that for)?  Another reason is that the demand for
      math fonts is not that high, so alternate styles were never really developed
      (because it's expensive!), and hence it's tradition to have just one version.\r\n\r\nI
      think it would be interesting to create a sloped math font and see how it reads.
      \ I don't think there would be much demand for it, though.\r\n\r\n@Tupper: good
      point about short snippets.\r\n"

  body: "<em>Interesting that you mention brackets Stephen \u2014 those are usually
    slanted in italic fonts...</em>\r\n\r\nIncluding slanted brackets in an italic
    font is good in that it allows the user to choose (assuming that there is a companion
    upright font with upright brackets). Nevertheless, I'm with Bringhurst on slanted
    brackets and parentheses: generally better not used.\r\n\r\n<em>When typesetting
    mathematics, geometric symbols (like equals, plus, union, brackets, etc) are never
    slanted. Letters are frequently slanted...</em>\r\n\r\nI'll add that I (as one
    who reads mathematics content regularly) don't think of the letters in math content
    as being slanted, but that there are both slanted and upright letters. Both variants
    of a single latter can occur in close proximity with completely different meanings.
    I might be more likely to confuse m and n than m and <em>m</em>.\r\n\r\nWith long
    unbroken streams of English text, variants forms are useful for demarcating sentences
    (upper / lower-case) or indicating different voices (weight & slant). Mathematics
    writers generally break up mathematical utterances into very short snippets.\r\n\r\nOne
    geometric symbol that could be seen as having slanted forms is the slash / back-slash
    (which can be used in mathematics to distinguish between left and right quotients)."

  body: "In proper math setting, numbers are not slanted/italic either. Basically,
    variables are slanted, and have odd spacing (looser than in text), numbers and
    symbols are upright.\r\n\r\nI think the reason is that italics were chosen for
    variables primarily so that the variable a and the article a are not confused.
    Similarily the el/one confusing is also harder to make, and to a lesser extent
    the zero/O error.\r\n\r\n"
