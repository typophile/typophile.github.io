  collapsed with all my data including my huge collection of different fonts... However
  the most painfull is that I don't remember the name of the font which I always used
  to mark my photos for years. I'm attaching the screenshot from a watermarked photo.\r\nI
  would be so happy if somebody recognize it and could help me with identifying the
  font.\r\n\r\nThank you very much!\r\nAnton"
