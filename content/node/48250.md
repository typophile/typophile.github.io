  as I do with my morning coffee, and I keep noticing certain fonts with an \"office\"
  weight, version, style &c.\r\n\r\nWhat does it mean? To my eyes, and I'm only up
  to the Mm's in the sans serif section, it looks like they sort of pseudo mono-space
  it and cross breed it with Courier.\r\n\r\nAny thoughts?"

    would be a typeface with characteristics optimized for office reproduction systems,
    such as laser printers, photocopiers, and fax machines, at a typical correspondence
    size (10-12 pt).\r\n\r\nThis may or may not relate to any real world definition,
    but it should, because I say so."

    I think they are also somewhat condensed. I need a magnifying glass to inspect
    the book closer.\r\n\r\nAnyone else?"

  body: "When I produced a typeface for a private client a couple of years ago, I
    supplied them with an 'office' and 'book' weight. As cuttlefish suggests, the
    office weight was designed to be used on office reproduction systems, while the
    book weight was intended for offset printing. The intention of providing two weights
    was to try to counteract the darkening effect of lower resolution printers to
    achieve a balance of blackness between office reproduction systems and offset
    printing (the low-res 'darkening effect' is a result of the 'rounding-up' of the
    printers rasterizing software). I also sold the client with the suggestion that
    the office weight would (somewhat negligibly) use less ink/toner and therefore
    would save them money etc..\r\n\r\nAnyway, I think you grasp the idea, but what
    I wanted to add to this post was that a few months after I had signed-off the
    work to the client I was showing the design to a fellow designer who asked whether
    I had based the character widths and spacing for the office weight on Times New
    Roman. I thought this a bit strange at the time, but maybe this could explain
    the 'pseudo mono-spacing'  and condensed forms?\r\n\r\nmike"
