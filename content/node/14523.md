body: "Hello, \r\nI'm quite happy with what I achieved today, so I take liberty to
  post a work-in-progress (hope this is the right place, and you won't mind). \r\nI
  don't know, I'd call it an 'egyptian', maybe bold? \r\nI like the shape of 'q b
  d', which reminds me of a 'serif din'; and 'a' is no bad either. I wonder if I could
  better match the 'e o c' with the general style. Maybe force the uprightness of
  the p on the 'e o c' letters? \r\nOf course, no metrics or kerning whatsoever.  \r\nAny
  suggestion welcome. \r\n\r\nthank you very much \r\nm."

    curves are too heavy,  Compare this to your o and see if you think they should
    be closer in thickness.\r\n\r\nKeep working__works in progress are welcomed.\r\n\r\nChrisL"

  body: It has a marlboro vibe to it. I like it anyway.

  body: I think this is akin to what ChrisL said, but the bowls on b q p d, as well
    as the shoulders on h and u, seem to have a 'bump' in the curve. Almost a corner,
    in fact. Take a look at what Peter Karow called the <a href="http://briem.ismennt.is/2/2.3.2a/2.3.2.06.illusion.htm">'bone
    effect'</a> (2/3 down the page).
