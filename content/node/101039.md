body: I'm at such a loss looking for the font from this sample. We are talking hours.
  I am grateful if you know of something close that I can cobble together a few words
  for a new project that is due soon. Disregard the cap "P" and "B" open stems if
  they aren't in your findings. Any ideas? Thanks!

    for clarification, I'm looking at the Book Extended variation."

  body: "Thanks DefiantOne for leading me back to Ocean Sans. I didn't see the extended
    versions earlier. Its lower case a's and e's still aren't exactly right, but it
    is the closest font going! This should at least get me through comping up new
    designs for presentation. \r\nThanks again!\r\n"
