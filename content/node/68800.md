  body: "First, I don't think it's the same font. The white lettering on black backgrounds
    is the same as \"ERYKAH\", but I don't know what font it is. I think the magazine
    logo is (maybe) a customization that started as a slab serif, but it may have
    been drawn from scratch. The A is the real oddball, and I can't think offhand
    of a slab serif with that style A.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
