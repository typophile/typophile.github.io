  I came across some font design books that I thought I would get for myself.\r\n\r\nDoes
  anyone have any recommendations on good books?  The ones I'm thinking of getting
  are The Elements of Typographic Style - Robert Bringhurst and Thinking with Type
  : A Critical Guide for Designers, Writers, Editors, and Students (Design Briefs)
  - Ellen Lupton.\r\n\r\nThanks for your input.\r\n\r\n-Will"

    Sheep & Find Out How Type Works - Spiekermann/Ginger also the Logo, Font & Lettering
    Bible - L. Cabarga

  body: "both books are very good. thinking with type isnt as in-depth as bringhurst
    (\"the typographers bible\"), which im still reading. i see it as a lexicon you
    can always go back to if you're unsure about anything.\r\n\r\nit also has a good
    list of different typefaces suited for text, with short descriptions on their
    history and which cuts are the best."

  body: "i think <em>Thinking with Type</em> would be a good preface to <em>The Elements
    of Typographic Style</em>. while Bringhurst's book is the \"typographer's Bible\",
    it can be a lot to chew on\u2026 but still a definite must-read.\r\n\r\nas for
    actually drawing and creating letters and fonts, the <em>Logo,Font & Lettering
    Bible</em> will help you to learn more about some of the technical stuff.\r\n\r\n\r\n----------\r\nnc"
