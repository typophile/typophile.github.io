  of glyphs, same encoding, and  glyph names, but the unicode entries are incomplete
  or missing in one of them.  How do I either:\r\nCopy the good unicode names from
  one font to the other without changing the outline, bearings or anything else?\r\nor\r\nCopy
  the outline and side-bearings to the font with the good unicode names?\r\nAnother
  question: is there a quick method to sort and color all the component glyphs of
  a font in Fontlab?\r\nMany thanks.\r\nVladimir"

  body: "The easiest way to do this would be to simply copy the cmap table from the
    good font to the other one. I would use DTL OTMaster for this, which is a simple
    copy/paste operation, but if you want a no-cost option you could use TTX: dump
    cmap table from one font and merge it to the other.\r\n\r\nNote that this relies
    on the glyph ordering of the two fonts being identical.\r\n\r\nAnother way to
    do this, in FontLab, is to save a .nam name-to-unicode file of the good font,
    and then use it to Apply Unicodes to the other font."

    you kindly described.\r\njasonc - I tried to learn Python a while back, trying
    to simulate physics ideas, but it was hard to remember the commands unless one
    uses it constantly. "

  body: "John I have managed to install TTX on the Mac and to create .tx versions
    of my fonts, and to edit the cmap there. The reverse process of recreating a .ttf
    file  (In Terminal type ttx and drag the .ttx file there/ ) is not working. Any
    other way to use TTX i.e syntax to copy cmap from A to B directly?  \r\n\r\n\r\nThanks\r\n"

    it can be done in a split second.\r\n\r\nSelect all glyphs from the source font,
    and then copy and paste the codepoints (paste special) to the destination font."

  body: Tak erwindenissen. I remember FontCreator the can-do little software fondly
    from my first experiments with handwriting font  years ago. Glad it seems to be
    developing well.  I did download the PC  trial but the fonts I wish to deal with
    are in different encodings. In Fontlab I could rearrange the glyphs, but on the
    Mac the paste-special command there changes some Unicode names in the target font.
