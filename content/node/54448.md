body: "Only this forum would appreciate the pain...to think that someone deliberately
  formatted this newsletter/advert. \r\n\r\nShe took great care, within the limitations
  of the email format, to make it appear cheerful: a mix of Comic Sans, Times Roman,
  Georgia and Arial, including italics and underscores, in five colors and many sizes.
  Sprinkled with typos and bad punctuation too. \r\n\r\nWe have to file this under
  \"doesn't know any better\" but am I wrong to think less of this correspondent?
  I've disguised the personal onfo.\r\n\r\nThis is just one third of the entire email,
  which went on and on and on...\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/ugly-email_6298.gif]\r\n\r\n"

    example of why one should hire a professional."

    but the double comma is a new one on me. I am at a loss to imagine the intent.

    dance follows the theme as her typography does, the Turkish, Egyptian, Moroccan,
    Latino, Bollywood, and East Coast swing styles would be fused into one glorious
    routine.\r\n\r\nYou all crack me up. This is so much better than showing this
    in horror to my husband or a friend and getting a \"so what?\""

  body: "It is indeed fascinating to see how two apparently identical designs but
    (more than) a century apart are viewed so differently. This reminds me of an old
    newspaper advert, possibly for The Guardian, which depicted two photographs of
    naked women in almost identical poses. One had a slender body with small breasts
    and a rather timid/detached facial expression, while the other had voluptuous
    forms and looked more\u2026 forthcoming. The slogan said something like \"Why
    is this art and this porn?\""
