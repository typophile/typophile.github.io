  using titling figures. Unfortunately I'm sometimes required to work with Adobe Caslon
  Pro in Apple Pages. Apple Pages doesn't give OT figure controls.\r\n\r\nSo - are
  there any fonts that default to proportional oldstyle figures (like Georgia) that
  would serve as a suitable replacement for Adobe Caslon's figures?\r\n\r\nI know
  I could probably export the Caslon oldstyle figures to a separate font file, or
  just exchange the title for the oldstyle figures in Caslon - but really, I'm much
  more willing to buy a similar font, than I am to buy a font editor, just for this
  single use..."

    chose your font (Adobe Caslon Pro, here) click below left on the 'weel' button
    and chose 'Typography' and then chose 'Number Case'. there you can chose the Number
    style.\r\nGood luck!\r\nPS Still I like working with Pages; it's much better than
    Word."
