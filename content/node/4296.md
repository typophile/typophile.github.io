  body: It&#39;s a near certainty that it&#39;s handlettering.  <BR> <BR>&#34;Come
    in We&#39;re Open&#34; and &#34;Sorry We&#39;re Closed&#34; signs exactly like
    this have been sold at hardware stores for as long as I can remember. I&#39;d
    say the designer scanned and combined them for this hybrid version.  <BR> <BR>You
    might find a font with a similar style to the script, but I doubt very much you
    will find an exact match.
