  here could help me. \r\n\r\ni was wondering for quite some time what\xB4s the font
  on the old russian medium format \"Lubitel\" cameras, to be more precise the Lubitel
  166B. i attached a picture for reference. i don't even know if there was a typeface
  used for this or if the lubitel font is just a drawn logotype. the closest i could
  get is Aachen Bold, but that\xB4s cleary not the font used. \r\n\r\nif anyone knows
  something about this, i\xB4d appreciate any information, thanks!"

  body: I'm stumped. It's sort of a short, squat variation of Playbill. Kind of a
    Aachen/Playbill hybrid. I like it though! Hope someone can track this down.
