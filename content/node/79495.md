    up at \"transcription\".\r\n\r\n<em>I provided links, info, and encouragement
    to the school's PR dept. to use a Kent font, but it didn't happen...</em>\r\n\r\nWell,
    if he's not talking about his own work, I guess it's no slight. \r\nNonetheless,
    Century and Helvetica are a bit prosaic to entice typophiles with."

    used the actual title I provided, instead of just the subtitle. Adding the entire
    blurb I wrote would have provided even more context. \r\n\r\nI can understand
    trimming the description, but the title&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;?!\r\n\r\nI
    don\u2019t suppose there\u2019s anything you can do about that at this point,

    with History</em></strong>\r\n\r\nFrederic Goudy famously quipped, \u201CThe old
    fellows stole all our best ideas.\u201D What does it mean to be innovative in
    a realm (typeface design) where the essential forms (the shapes of our alphabet\u2019s
    letters) have been more or less fixed for centuries? As a creative professional
    engaged in such a circumscribed craft, type designer Kent Lew will examine his
    field\u2019s self-referential proclivities within a broader historical and cultural
    context, drawing parallels with other artistic disciplines, including music and
    painting. Reflecting on notions such as allusion, citation, transcription, revival,
    and homage, he will weave a narrative of type history\u2019s recurrent efforts
    to convincingly marry past and present and to infuse old forms with new life.\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    LF/OSF and SC than light, semi-bold, and black variants. But then Kent includes
    a semi-bold! Way to go!"

    not generally my style to script my presentations precisely enough to stand alone
    in print. I tend to work more from outline and improvise quite a bit. But it\u2019s
    my intention to get this particular talk worked out more thoroughly, so you never
    know.\r\n\r\nStill, don\u2019t hold your breath. \r\n\r\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\r\n\r\nAnd
    for those who are not familiar with my reference above, the French folk song \u201CAh
