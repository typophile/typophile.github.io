  body: I think what Miss Tiffany was getting at is it would be a lot easier for us
    to help you if you showed us some examples of the kind of thing you're looking
    for. Then we can try and figure out some fonts that might be similar.

    not sure 80s is the vintage you\u2019re looking for.\r\n\r\notherwise I think
    of the Mods and fat tightly spaced Euro sans. \r\n\r\nEurostile was Italian and
