    what to do with that exclamation point. :)\r\n\r\nI prefer the variation on the
    bottom left (without the exclamation point). The one on the top right is my second
    choice. \r\n\r\nHowever, the thing that really bothers me is the vertical alignment
    of the words. It feels out of balance to me. Maybe try experimenting more with
    type size and alignment and leave the exclamation point out entirely?\r\n"
