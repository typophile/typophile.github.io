body: "Hi guys this my first time here as I have a client that has me stumped. The
  fonts have been converted to line and nobody knows what the fonts are anymore so
  I turn to you guys to help out.\r\n\r\nThere are 2 logos which I think are from
  the same fonts but they have been possibly pulled about there are some suggestions
  of Britannic bold, but also some of Candara hence my issue, I have tried various
  ways of finding out which they are but to no avail.\r\n\r\nThanks\r\nDoug"
