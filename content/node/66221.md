    should be handled at the font level. If you choose a language for a text in InDesign,
    it converts dumb quotes to language-specific quotes already when you type them

    is there a language menu in the character palette which gives the option to select
    (amongst other languages) one of 5 [five] different types of German. What does
    this do - what are the changes I would expect to see?\r\n\r\nThis is not merely

  body: Michael, FWIW the selection between many variants of German has to do with
    spell checking (and hyphenation); German orthography was reformed a couple of
    times recently, plus there are diverging spelling rules for Switzerland (where
    we don't use the eszett).

    make the car do what the driver expect - ie go forward and also maybe have a more
    niche feature (gear-stick). The dealer is like me though (earlier) and has a glazed

    and can cater to a specific typographic need if so was your desire.

  body: "Principally, there are three \"levels\" of this kind of support: \r\n\r\n1.
    Keyboard layouts\r\n2. System- or application-level replacement of characters\r\n3.
    Font-level glyph replacement through OpenType Layout\r\n\r\nAd. 1. Mac OS X provides
    better (\"richer\") keyboard layouts than Windows. In Mac OS X, all the standard
    keyboard layouts have a very extensive access to various more or less useful characters
    through the \"Option\" key. For example, the U.S. English keybaord layout produces
    the opening double quotation mark (\u201C) through Option+[ and the closing double
    quotation mark (\u201D) through Shift+Option+[. Also, Option+] and Shift+Option+]
    provide access to the opening and closing single quotation mark (\u2018, \u2019),
    the latter also serving as the proper apostrophe. Option+\\ and Shift+Option+\\
    provide access to the guillemets (\xAB and \xBB). \r\n\r\nWhat I like about the
    Mac OS X keybaord layouts is that there are quite reasonably localized. For example,
    the Polish keyboard layout uses exactly the same keystrokes for the Polish-localized
    quotation marks (\u201E and \u201D plus \u201A and \u2019 and also the guillemets).
    \r\n\r\nBoth keyboard layouts provide the endash (\u2013) and the emdash (\u2014)
    through Option+- and and Shift+Option+-. \r\n\r\nThe German keyboard layout unfortunately
    has some mistakes. Since Shift+2 produces the straight quotation mark (\"), it
    would be useful to provide the proper German quotation mark through Option+2 and
    Shift+Option+2. Those would be \u201E and \u201C. Unfortnately those keystrokes
    produce \u201C and \u201D, which are useless in German. The opening German quotation
    mark (\u201E) is mapped to Shift+Option+W while the closing mark (\u201C) is mapped
    on Option+2. This hardly makes sense \u2014 but at least they ARE available. \r\n\r\nBy
    pressing those special keystrokes, you always get the proper Unicode codepoints
    in the text, so the final text encoding is \"right\". \r\n\r\nIn Windows, right
    Alt could serve a similar purpose but does not. In the Polish layout, the diacritic
    characters are mapped to right Alt+letter, but all the other keys are not mapped
    to anything useful. \r\n\r\nAd. 2. Some applications (Microsoft Word, Adobe InDesign)
    have an option \"Use typographer's quotes\" or \"Use smart quotes\" that replaces
    the standard \"straight quotation mark\" characters by the proper marks while
    typing. Microsoft Word also provides other replacements such as two hyphens to
    endash and three hyphens to emdash. This is done by replacing the actual characters,
    i.e. the Unicode codepoints in the text. This is how it should be done. \r\n\r\nMac
    OS X 10.6 introduces this ability on the system level. The System Preferences
    tab is now renamed to \"Language & Text\" and has a Text tab that includes a \"Smart
    quotes\" dropdown menu. But it's not really done right because it's not language-sensitive.
    \r\n\r\nSimilar features are available on some websites \u2014 although not here
    on Typophile. Whenever I input the straight quotation marks (using Shift+' on
    U.S. English or Polish, and Shift+2 on German), the character codes are replaced
    when a posting is sent off. \r\n\r\nAd. 3. The OpenType Layout mechanism has a
    \"locl\" feature that allows replacing certain glyphs by other forms depending
    on the language of the text. Note a big difference: when the replacement is done
    through an OpenType Layout feature, the Unicode codepoints in the underlying text
    stay the same. So this is NOT a good mechanism for implementing smart quotes.
    The \"locl\" feature is useful for selecting different glyphs that on the encoding
    level share the same Unicode codepoint \u2014 but the quotation marks have different
    Unicodes. \r\n\r\nAll in all, the \"smart quotes\"/\"typographer's quotes\" mechanism
    (level 2) and customized keyboard layouts (level 1) are the best way to implement
    this. Stay away from trying to implement this on the font level: you will do more
    harm than good to your users. \r\n\r\nBest,\r\nAdam\r\n"

    applies the correct quote style based on the language set to the paragraph (when
    \"Typographer's Quotes\" is checked in the Preferences; can be redefined per language
    in the Dictionary section) when you manually insert quotes, and on importing when
    \"Typographer's Quotes\" is checked in the Import options.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately,

    It sounds more like a gimmick \"because we can\", than a useful enhancement.\r\nCompare
    automatically replacing single and double <em>straight</em> quotes with curly
    ones. I imagine you can get quite far, using OTF replacements, but I'd ne'er be
    able to properly typeset Shakespearian text 'nymore. 'Nuff said."
