  language stationery, especially as applies to the mandatory small print we have
  so much of in the UK?\r\n\r\nI've attached a couple of pdfs of my attempt. I'm happy
  with the address details but organising the small print at the base is proving a
  bit clunky.\r\n\r\nThanks\r\nAnthony"

  body: "I have used an italic for a second language in the past. I'm not sure if
    that is a no-no but it does delineate.\r\n\r\nAnother option you have when using
    two colours as you are, is to treat one language or the other with the second
    colour. Perhaps a 70-80% of that blue would bring it down to the same intensity
    of the grey?\r\n\r\n(wish we used A4 sheets here)\r\n\r\npd"

  body: "I suggest using the same number of lines for each block for The members of\u2026
    You could also put those back to back right ranging the one on the left in the
    centre with the limited liability text on either side so you get an almost symetrical
    appearance at the bottom of the page, with all aligned at the bottom rather than
    top. Couple of words taken over could improve the look at, ag and gyfreithwyr.
    Also why are the Welsh details first at the top and second at the bottom and the
    righthand block looks to be a touch lower than the other three.\r\n\r\nTim"

  body: "Is the use of color an option? I am not sure I would use italic for one and
    roman the other. It seems to me that both languages are important. Unless you
    can convey equal importance, using italic or a second color can make one seem
    of less import. Maybe I'm exaggerating. \r\n\r\nIf there are two colors associated
    with the company I would opt for color. IMHO.\r\n\r\nI wondered the same thing
    as Tim. The order should be the same at the top and bottom. However, I prefer
    them lining as you have them now. Creates a nice baseline for the content of the
    letter."

  body: "I would steer clear both of colour and italics. There's no functional reason
    to draw attention to the differences between the languages. No-one's going to
    think: \"I wonder which one is Welsh? I know, it must be the green/italic one.\"
    What matters most is to remember (1) that the letterhead is not seen alone, but
    always with some text on it; (2) that the other text is always more important
    than the stuff on the letterhead; and therefore (3) that too much busyness in
    the letterhead will be a problem. What people do look for in the letterhead is
    information when they need it, and from that point of view a logical structure
    is useful.\r\n\r\nHave you considered:\r\n\r\n(A) Definitely be consistent in
    placement left/right top/bottom.\r\n\r\n(B) Personally, I'd put the DX numbers
    either with the address or on their own. I'd keep fax, telephone and email all
    together. One logically separates \"document\" communication from electronic/voice
    communication.\r\n\r\n(C) How is this going to work with Direct Dial telephone
    numbers and direct emails? It's bound to get used that way: someone is going to
    type on DDI and personal email addresses. Give some thought to where those will
    go, and how they will relate to the general email and telephone information you
    have pre-printed.\r\n\r\n(D) Are you sure you have all the stuff in the small
    print you need? It would be pretty usual to have something saying that they will
    not accept service by email. You might want to check whether they need that.\r\n\r\n(E)
    Has the time come to abandon the E. and W. by the email and web addresses? All
    of us can recognise an email or a web address simply by its format. The use of
    E. and W. seems to me to be simply to produce symmetry with T. and F. But is it
    necessary? If not, it's clutter.\r\n\r\n(F) Going back to the idea that the letterhead
    is only half the story (you have to imagine it with a letter on it), how will
    the margins look on this? A typed letter is bound to have (and should have) much
    wider margins than the edge you are implicitly marking. How will that look?\r\n\r\nPaul"

  body: "Generally I agree with Paul, except for one point: There is a functional
    reason to differentiate the two languages. The issue isn't that English and Welsh
    look the same; it's that anyone wanting to read the form or document deserves
    to have the text, in their language, made available in a clear sequence. For anyone
    reading English, it's a bother and confusing to scan over Welsh to locate the
    next English bit, and I imagine, vice versa. Should everyone reading the document
    be forced to read the same info in 2 languages in order to find what they want?
    \r\n\r\nWhen designing multilingual forms or documents, one can assume the readers
    want to follow the information in one language, not hop between two or more languages
    (even if they are capable of hopping). In this case, bold or colored text for
    Welsh (or English) essentially offers any reader an immediate choice of paths;
    they can choose either, and either is equally readable, but they run in parallel
    and are not confused easily. Multilingual documents that differentiate between
    languages visually are easier to navigate. \r\n\r\nIn a similar vein, maintaining
    consistent order (Welsh left, English right) is another useful way to make the
    various language paths clear. \r\n\r\nThere may be an issue with implying some
    heirarchy with font styles, but a robust type family, or an application of color
    should fix that. Then again, there may actually be a hierarchy; if the majority
    of readers are Welsh, then that is more important. "

  body: "Thanks for all your advice.\r\n\r\nAs usual, this process has unfortunately
    been a rather reactive one, as I expect you might have experienced yourselves.
    The welsh office didn't get involved in the design process untill recently, and
    the IT guys didn't think to stick their oar in until yesterday. So issues of extra
    languages and fitting the design around an existing template appear after the
    work has been signed off.. \r\n\r\nI need to consider how to maintain consistency
    with their other english speaking offices' stationery, so the use of the w. &
    e. need to stay, but I do agree with you Paul. On a previous version the contact
    details stacked vertically and the prefix made sense for the alignment. The format
    stuck. The DX numbers have also stayed where they are as that is the convention
    on the other items.\r\n\r\nAs for differentiating using bold/italic/tint/colour,
    surely that convention would also need to apply to the address and contacts at
    the top which is actually hybrid, rather than parallel, ie two addresses that
    share phone numbers etc. I may have to resort to a key line between the two languages,
    much as I hate to say it..\r\n\r\nGood interesting challenges, thanks for the
    help\r\n\r\nAnthony"

      you feel that a smaller point size and a larger gap, as well as sorting out
      the order of things, is enough? I can't really do different colours as I feel
      I would need to apply those colours to the address, and it's not clear whether
      just to differentiate the address details or to include the phone numbers as

  body: "Well this is typography, isn't it. Try to find a solution without resorting
    to rules, boxes, tints, etc. You already have 2 colors (plus white) to work with,
    a font with 2 weights, and is there an italic? Not to mention font size.\r\n\r\nTry
    more things; there are several variables here that should give you plenty of room
    to discover an elegant solution. \r\n\r\nIf grouping/separation issues are getting
    you down, talk to the users of the document; it's an editorial decision as well
    as a typographic one. "
