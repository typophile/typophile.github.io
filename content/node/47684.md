body: "My high-end academic company has used Times New Roman as their \"logo\" for
  the last 17 years. It's even in giant silver letters on the office wall. I asked
  for the logo file and they said \"oh, just type it.\" Cringe. Cringe.\r\n\r\nAs
  their new director of marketing, I'm trying to help them modernize. Fortunately,
  we're re-branding and they're up for a logo change, but I'm sure any extreme departure
  from Times New Roman is out of the question.\r\n\r\nSo, we're shooting for a high-end,
  classy, luxury typeface that still has some academic tendancies. \r\n\r\nDoes anyone
  have any suggestions? \r\n\r\nI will definitely look at them all. Thank you!"
