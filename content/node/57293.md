    forgotten the name of. \r\n\r\nAs for the effect, though, that'd be really easy
    to emulate in Photoshop. "

  body: "Thanks for those wonderful alternatives.\r\nThis font was pretty common on
    tacky paperbacks and New-Wave compilation albums c.1978-1981. I'm pretty sure
    it was a standalone typeface rather than a treated sans-serif such was its prevalence."
