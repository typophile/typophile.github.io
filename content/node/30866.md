  Germany and around the world. I have the feeling, that the original typeface might
  have been changed, somehow squeezed (width ?) ?\r\n\r\nHowever - I'm not certain
  about the name of the font being used - does anyone have a clue?\r\n\r\ncheers,\r\njan"

    that's besides the point.

  body: Nope, [[squooshed]] is the exact opposite of stretched -- it creates a condensed
    face, not an extended one. I know the TypoWiki says it applies to both, but I
    don't agree.

  body: Nope, it creates exactly the same effect. That's why I want a distinction
    between the condensed and the extended end result, otherwise you simply don't
    know what you're talking about.

  body: Fair cop guys; I agree with the need to distinguish between these heinous
    crimes of glyph distortion. I will use the sq... term with more diligence in future.
