    Roman with the serifs chopped off. That doesn\u2019t look too good. If you can\u2019t
    avoid it, do it yourself in a vector graphics editor of your choice."

  body: Hrant, Your right it seems to be a altered version of something else - I had
    not downloaded it and opened it - I just went from R.s idea and put sans times
    in search, now I have and it is quite strange with including arabic and cyrillic
    glyphs , and accented glyphs with serifs - and he is right the t is not right
    nor is the r. The Garden Centre could be a mash up of two fonts.
