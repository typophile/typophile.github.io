body: "At the University of Reading in 2000 we never referred to Capital as Uppercase
  and small letters to lowercase. \r\n\r\nThe terms are incorrect and referred to
  typecases and the placements of the metal slugs.\r\n\r\nCapitals is the correct
  term referring to there Roman roots. And small letters is the only real term for
  those little versions of the original Capitals. \r\n\r\nNow we need to know are
  they Figures (figgers: UK English) or Numerals?\r\n\r\nIt would be interesting to
  know what the non-english terms are for Capital letters and small letters?\r\n\r\n"

    old technology. Tiffany was not really climbing on her high horse \r\nabout semantics.
    So you can say upper and lower case and font and \r\nfoundry, even though you
    are just talking about some code in a \r\nprogram. And 'small letter' ascenders
    are usually taller than \r\ncapitals, so if you want to be nit-picky (nobody actually
    has to pick \r\nnits, lice eggs, out of anyone's hair, since we've got good \r\nmedicines!)
    that horse won't run either. \r\n\r\nI'd like to know about figures vs numerals
    too, though. "

  body: "Vince the terms uppercase and lower aren't \"incorrect.\" Earlier scribal
    terms were majuscule and minuscule and these are still common in calligraphy.
    Uppercase and lowercase are printers terms in the sense that the terms are not
    used before the introduction of printing and do refer to storage and distribution
    placement. But the words are common usage and definitional. The word type, also
    a printer's term, itself was not used to describe \"letters\" until as late as
    1701. \r\n\r\n\"Capitals\" and \"small letters\" seem less useful in that they
    are less precise and can refer to other things. University of Reading huh?"

  body: "I prefer numerals, simply because it is more widely understood and has close
    parallels in so many different languages. Figures seems to have been a specialised
    Anglo-American typographers term, and awkwardly has other meanings, e.g. diagrams
    or illustrations in a book.\r\n\r\nI prefer uppercase and lowercase to capital
    and small, similarly, because they are more precise. What's a 'small letter'?
    5pt?\r\n\r\nThe best technical terms are majuscule and miniscule, which of course
    predate typesetting, but they are not familiar to many people.\r\n\r\nYes, the
    terminology of upper and lower derives from typesetters' cases, but it is widely
    used outside of the type business and has been for a very long time. It also figures
    (oh, look, there's that imprecise word again) in the user interfaces of many applications
    that non-specialist users employ on a daily basis without difficulty. For instance,
    my text editor has a 'To Uppercase' text conversion function.\r\n\r\nAlso, while
    upper and lower clearly refer to typesetters' cases, we call alphabets that have
    a functional majuscule/miniscule distinction 'bicameral'. So there is another
    sense in which our alphabet is 'cased', that is now independent of the origins
    of the term; there is for instance some evidence that the Crimean 'palochka' letter
    has recently 'assumed case', i.e. a monocameral letter has become bicameral."
