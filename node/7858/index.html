		<div class="commentbody">Hi <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Over the past ten years I have had quite a bit of experience of this, from trying to find a job, to interviewing for my own agency. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I found that the best route was to call up and ask if people could spare 15 minutes to look at my work. I never asked for a job, just for advice. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Next, when I went to visit an agency I would ask if they could recommend any other good places to approach. Sometimes they would call up and make an appointment with friends at other agencies for me. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->My business partner loves it when people send a letter thanking her for seeing them. She gave a job to someone for that reason once. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->From your point of view, you should be asking for placements. Try and line up a whole string of them, most people will pay you something. This puts you top of the list if a job does become available. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->From the hiring point of view, I like to see good work. But  a lot of people have good work. I want someone who wants to learn more&hellip; so I would never say that you think you are good. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I personally think that most graduates don't try to find work, they might mail out a cv, or a CD-ROM, but if they really want a job they have to put in more work. The only way to find work is to get sat down with your folio in front of someone. If you get a placement, just make yourself really useful, not only in terms of design, but by offering to cut stuff out, buy coffee, anything which makes you look like you'll work your  off. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Good Luck <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Jim <!-- raw HTML omitted -->=== <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><a href="http://www.sumodesign.co.uk">http://www.sumodesign.co.uk</a><!-- raw HTML omitted --></div>
