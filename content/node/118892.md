  body: "Edited\r\nQuite unique. Looks like an art project. Perhaps no additional
    letters.\r\nI wonder what common font is similar to the shapes of these letters
    before the swoosh serifs. Look like acrobatic versions of the garalde serfs found
    on Erasmus, Times Roman, ITC Garamond, Minion etc. The _w_ is a lowercase version
    of the _W_ in Herman Ihlenburg's Copperplate. http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/archivetype/archive-copperplate-head/\r\nIn
    the same vein as the mystery font, but only part way there, Emerge BF https://www.myfonts.com/fonts/bomparte/emerge/\r\nDon\r\n"
