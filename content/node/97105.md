body: "Hello!\r\n\r\nI'm looking to find this typeface. Sample is attached, since
  it was displaying properly inline. \r\n\r\nIt was certainly handset by the ever
  matchless Reid Miles, but it must have been created from some standard face of the
  time, right? I was looking at Akzidenz Grotesk (in some sort of condensed weight)
  as an alternate but it's not quite right. Looking to \"borrow\" this design for
  a poster promoting a one-time DJ night I'm doing spinning all jazz wax.\r\n\r\nThanks
  all!"
