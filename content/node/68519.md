  for screen and print. I'm using Berthold Akzidenz right now but I would like to
  use a typeface that is not used quite as often as Akzidenz. Any input would be appreciated.

    slabs, you might try Proxima Nova, Franklin Gothic, Avenir, Museo Sans, Mundo
    Sans, or Benton Sans.

    Rail Alphabet</a>. New Rail Alphabet is a new interpretation of the sans typeface
    Rail Alphabet by Kinneir and Calvert back in the 1960's. Calvert designed Calvert
    for the Tyne and Wear Metro. It shares a lot of similarities with Rail Alphabet
    but obviously has big slabs attached.\r\n"
