    body: "I want to design a logo, that should be associated with these. It's for
      a software development consultancy so nothing big and renown. Number 7? Not
      sure why I wanted that... Probably for its magic and fairy tale association.
      Number 7 also goes very well with the UX rule of 7\xB12."

    to pick all that up, unless it looks like an emoji stream or something (yuk).\r\n\r\nThere
    might be one way though: emulating the amazing Unilever logo."
