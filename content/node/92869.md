  the fonts used in the above supermarket logos. I've tried, and failed to locate
  any suitable matches. I'm told that they are probably proprietary fonts based off
  of modified versions of existing fonts. Even having a closely matched font would
  be extremely useful.\r\n\r\nI can't divulge too much about the project, tho I can
  say that it will be a comedy website with more than a little tongue in cheek humor
  aimed at these retailers. I'm telling you this in the hopes that former employees
  of the companies may come forward with enthusiasm!\r\n\r\nhttp://www.udsu.co.uk/files/minisites/54703/asda.png\r\nhttp://www.aaronfencing.co.uk/img_gallery/accreditations/Tesco-Logo.jpg\r\nhttp://1.bp.blogspot.com/-aGw3DBxs2Eo/TqSc87KV_AI/AAAAAAAAAgY/BJl40lw0f40/s1600/sainsburys_logo.png\r\nhttp://www.zillibaby.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/bigmorrisons.png\r\n\r\nThanks
  guys,\r\n\"Phil Shelf\""

    treatment is required to make them look closer to your originals.\r\n\r\nGood
    luck with your comedy website :)\r\n\r\nPS: Why all Super Market logos are created
    with so bold and \"fat\" letters? ;)\r\nIs this a subconscious message like \"consume
    more\" - \"have plenty of food\" - \"be fat too\"?"

  body: "Hi, sorry for the late reply. I just wanted to thank you. Your suggestions
    are pretty much perfect. I'm happy to use slightly different fonts as it helps
    me distance myself legally from any backlash! \r\n\r\nI think you're onto something
    with the trend in chunky lettering! Retail is full of subliminal messages and
    subtle manipulation!\r\n\r\nThanks again\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
