    Arabic AT+AC:\r\nhttp://typophile.com/forum/366\r\nSo please post Arabic-Related
    problems here next time.\r\n2. Though I never use M$ Access, I can guess from
    my experience with M$Word 2.0 upto 2003 that you have to set the corresponding
    fields to Arabic Language + Right to Left Direction. Emphasizing: Direction has
    nothing to do with Justification that can be made right, left or center.\r\n3.

  body: "Sallu,\r\n\r\nIt seems this is more an error by Microsoft than one caused
    by your installation / machine / configuration. The font for this dialog might
    be hardcoded to one that does not contain Arabic characters. I'm guessing, but
    it's still displayed RTL -- so it's recognized as Arabic --, and the same text
    displays fine in other dialogs -- so it's not a text storage thingy.\r\n\r\nYou
    could contact Microsoft to report it as a bug, or perhaps they already have a
    fix."

    is with control only or Accsess engine not supporting Unicode in field names.\r\n\r\nCan
    you tell which version of Access you use? And whether you use localized versions
    of Access and Windows.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nSergey"
