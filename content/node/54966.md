  local council, as part of this we have 3 stationery spots that will have printed
  posters. \r\n\r\nWe are looking to do something a bit more interesting that your
  usual poster and wuold like to use the  print technology that make a printed poster
  look as if it's moving, you walk past and the poster changes. It looks like those
  fake hologram card I used to get when i was a little-un, slight ridges to the print,
  each ridge with a different picture that comes into view when your at the right
  angle. (hope that makes sense)\r\n\r\nI have been trying to search for it for ages
  on google and can't find anything. \r\nDoes any one have any ideas about this or
  know what printers offer this sort of printAany help or pointers would be amazing,
  if your around Torquay a few free pints is on offer as well.\r\n\r\nCheers\r\nmartin"
