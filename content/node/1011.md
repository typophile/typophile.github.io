  body: Makes sense. <BR>We already associate light weights to &#34;elegance&#34;/&#34;seriousness&#34;
    anyway.

  body: In many ways I think black weights are more human than light weights, but
    I&#39;m not so sure they are always more funny. I&#39;d like to see what you are
    thinking. Can you post some examples?

  body: Interesting topic. Maybe they usually end up &#34;funny&#34; because the femimine
    Carolingian foundation of most contemporary work makes dark weights chubby and
    cute. But if you picture a really dark fraktur for example &#40;or anything angular&#41;,
    I&#39;d say it&#39;s the opposite of funny. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>

  body: When a typeface gets very bold, its features become more  <BR>exaggerated
    until it becomes almost a caricature of the  <BR>&#34;normal&#34; weight. I think
    exaggeration is the key. It is, after  <BR>all, one of the basic elements of humor.

  body: I don&#39;t think a Black weight <i>has</i> to be a funny caricature, and
    sometimes it plain shouldn&#39;t be - it depends on the character of the face.
    Galliard for example is a very &#34;joyous&#34; design, so its Black is perfect.
    But Patria&#39;s Black should be &#40;and will be&#41; austere. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>

  body: I would agree with that. I should have said that features  <BR><b>can</b>
    become exaggerated to the point of caricature.  <BR>I was just speculating why
    some very bold faces do look  <BR>&#34;funny.&#34; I didn&#39;t mean to imply
    that all of them do.  <BR>I&#39;m thinking of things like Cooper Black or Gill
    Kayo, for  <BR>example.

    unrelated channels to voice their dissenting opinions. You could say that&#39;s
    a natural and useful &#34;automatic&#34; tool for fighting injustice, since the

  body: Sorry guys, <BR>I started this thread, but I couldn&#39;t react myself sooner.
    <BR> <BR>I was just wondering this question myself. Because as you commented right,
    when a face is made bold, it starts becoming a caricature. Several people have
    tried different theories to make type more bold. But most of them didn&#39;t loose
    the caricature factor. Why is this? <BR> <BR>Couldn&#39;t there be a way to make
    type bold, whitout this effect?  <BR> <BR>And I have a second question. Now we
    take bold type for granted, but it is a &#39;modern&#39; feature of faces.  <BR>

    by the moderators. I am happy to abide by the rules ...etc. <BR> <BR>I made the
    comment because for me type and books are a way to relax and find some small enjoyment
    in a difficult world. It is a minor irritation to be reading along with a smile
    and then encounter a slogan that slams &#39;my president&#39;. I just do not want
    to deal with that while I am here. <BR> <BR>Please do not make the assumption
    that I am not active, engaged or that I am somehow creating a lifestyle of avoidance,
    as that would not be correct. <BR> <BR>I have invested a great deal of time researching
    this who Iraq situation, talking about it and staying abreast of it. I read a
    number of publications that deal with word issues, events, politics, policy and
    so on. <BR> <BR>Typophile and type related pursuits are a break for me. That is
    all. <BR> <BR>Thank you for the polite and helpful responses and I am glad my
    question did not derail the topic of this tread! <BR> <BR>;&#41; <BR> <BR>'

    of a lighter  <BR>&#62;wheight? <BR> <BR>A good example of a bold different from
    the regular is Frantisek Storm&#39;s <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/storm/lexon-gothic/"

    design, written by Storm himself, scrolling down the page. <BR> <BR>I think it&#39;s
    more interesting when bold and regular actually have different designs, but like
    Hrant said, it depends on the overall design.'
