		<div class="commentbody">Peter &ndash; <BR> <BR>I'm going to guess that what is happening is the translation from FOG to Postscript to FL. Postscript doesn't make a distinction about point types, coding only the coordinates of the on-curve points and the associated control points. If I'm not mistaken, PS doesn't handle decimal places, so coordinates are rounded to the nearest integer when a PS font is generated. Non-orthogonal curves and tangents are particularly susceptible to this. <BR> <BR>When FL reads the PS data from the font, I'm guessing that if the points aren't exactly colinear (due to rounding) that FL will not interpret them as tangent points per se. I would presume that your points and controls are still in the proper places (allowing for rounding). I'd be curious to see a screenshot with the control handles showing. For instance, did FL add a handle to the bottom side of that lower, outside curve point? <BR> <BR>I'm just starting the arduous transition to FL myself and am by no means an expert. Someone more technically savvy, like John Hudson, might have a better explanation. <BR> <BR>&ndash; Kent. <BR></div>

		<div class="commentbody">Peter &ndash; <BR> <BR>I've been thinking about this and spending some time with the FontLab manual.  <BR>I had an insight that I think might help. <BR> <BR>The FOG model is point-based. But the FontLab model is segment-based.  <BR> <BR>What I mean is that in FOG you are usually focused on what kind of point  <BR>you're placing. Whereas in FL, the emphasis is on what kind of line segment  <BR>is being operated on. FOG has three kinds of points &ndash; corner, curve, and  <BR>tangent. FL doesn't make these distinctions. <BR> <BR>FL distinguishes between two different kinds of line segment &ndash; a straight line  <BR>(which they also call a <i>vector</i>) and a curve (a bezier curve). A curve is described  <BR>by four points &ndash; two end points on the curve (<i>nodes</i>) and the two bezier  <BR>control points on the handles. A straight line is controlled by only two nodes &ndash;  <BR>one at either end, with no control handles. <BR> <BR>FL also distinguishes two different kinds of transitions between line segments &ndash;  <BR>a node can either be a smooth connection or a sharp connection. <BR> <BR>So, if you have a curve meeting another curve, then the node will have two  <BR>control handles, one contributing to each of the two curves. If the connection  <BR>is smooth, then the two handles will be co-linear &ndash; that is, they are linked  <BR>and stay aligned with each other &ndash; so this kind of node is what FOG would call  <BR>a curve point.  <BR> <BR>If two curves meet and the connection is sharp, then the two control handles  <BR>can be moved independent from one another. This node would then constitute  <BR>a corner point in FOG. <BR> <BR>If two straight line segments meet, then the node does not have any control  <BR>handles and is necessarily sharp. This would also be considered a corner point  <BR>in FOG. <BR> <BR>If a straight line meets a curve, then the node will have one control handle on  <BR>the curve side. If the connection is sharp, then this control handle can move  <BR>any which way and the node would be considered a corner point in FOG.  <BR> <BR>But if the connection is smooth, then the control handle on the curve side  <BR>will be co-linear with the vector segment meeting up with the curve and will  <BR>only move in a line with this vector &ndash; and this is what FOG would call  <BR>a tangent point. <BR> <BR>Does this help? <BR> <BR>So, you need to notice whether the node between a straight line and a curve  <BR>is smooth or sharp. When it is selected, you will see off to the side of the  <BR>node either a circle (smooth connection) or an x (sharp connection). You can  <BR>also turn on all connection types for every node, whether selected or not, by  <BR>selecting the button from the View/Show Layers toolbar. <BR> <BR>So, for example, if you select the node on the top of the inside of your  <BR>counter, you will see whether it is a smooth connection or not. If it isn't,  <BR>then double click the node to toggle the connection style. When the connection  <BR>is smooth, then you can change the &quot;curve&quot; on the right side to a straight line  <BR>by selecting the right control handle of the node and deleting it. (Deleting  <BR>either control handle of a segment will convert it to a straight line vector, since  <BR>a curve needs to be defined by two control handles.) <BR> <BR>Once the right-hand segment is a straight line and the left-hand segment is a  <BR>curve and the node is a smooth connection, then the handle on the left will  <BR>only move in line with the straight segment and you will have, in effect, a  <BR>tangent point. <BR> <BR>I hope this makes sense and is helpful. <BR> <BR>&ndash; Kent. <BR></div>

		<div class="commentbody">To follow up on Kent's thorough description, I wanted to add that FL has an excellent way of keeping users on their toes with regard to what is allowed in the world of PostScript Type 1 fonts: <BR> <BR>FL doesn't let you form a curve by anything other than two points with control handles. In Fontographer, you're allowed to create a curve that has a BCP handle on one end, and an &quot;empty&quot; point on the other end. But this can produce errors, since it is effectively creating a point-on-top-of-point situation. FL shows you that this is happening by immediately introducing a complimentary BCP handle when you create a curved segment. It invites you to define the curve properly. <BR> <BR>FL also makes you aware of the nature of Type 1 curves, by making the &quot;closepath&quot; and start/end points a tangible part of the path. This can be disorienting at first, and seem like a hassle, but it reveals the nature of the curves and allows greater control. <BR> <BR>Lastly, if you turn on the &quot;connection type&quot; layer as Kent suggests, FL does another neat thing: when two consecutive BCP handles cross each other's paths, the connection type indicator flips to the opposite side of the point, notifying you that the curve is not constructed as well as it could be. <BR> <BR>Lastly lastly, setting the preferences to show points in color is another handy visual cue.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Yes, Hrant. To the best of my knowledge, that is considered a Type 1 no-no. It's my understanding that BCPs are considered points, along with vertices. When you create a one-sided curve, you are invisibly creating a BCP on the opposite end of the curve. That invisible BCP (invisible in Fog, at least) is located directly on top of the vertex, so then you have a point-on-point situation. Whether or not this is as likely to cause spiking as two vertices on top of each other, I'm not sure. But it's worth staying away from it (yeah, it's annoying, I agree). <BR> <BR>Alan</div>

Hmmm, Python script, anyone? <BR> <BR>A similar thing (legal but ill-advised) is to leave off explicit inflection points (like in the spines of an &quot;s&quot;), although this is actually commonly done by some otherwise fine designers (if rarely in very obvious spots such as the &quot;s&quot; spines). One good reason to define all your inflection points explicitly is TT output/conversion - it consistently blows up, at least in Fog. But I think there are other reasons too.

Alan Dague-Greene provided good example of what I mean. <BR> <BR>&gt;I'm curious, where did you get the factor of 0.55197 when making a &quot;perfect&quot; circle?  <BR> <BR>Did we publish this number somewhere or you just draw a very big circle in FL? :-)  <BR> <BR>Actually I don't remember how it was calcualted in the early days of FL, but now I would do it this way (pardon my math): measure a distance (along x or y direction) from the point located at 45 degrees on a curve and a midlle point of the one-quarter curve. On a curve it is: R * (4 + 3 * X) / 8 [where X is a value we want to find], on a circle: R / sqrt(2). <BR> <BR>Finally our X is [in C math notation]: (8 / sqrt(2) - 4) / 3 <BR> <BR>Precise value is: 0.55228474983079339840225, which is quite close to the value we use in FL (and which history I don't remember).</div>

		<div class="commentbody">There is no way to draw a precise circle with the cubic Bezier curve, but it is possible to approximate it. You can draw a 1/4 of a circle (90 degrees) with a single curve with a minimal error: to do that you need to set a length of each BCP to that magical factor multiplied to circle radius. As an experiment you can draw a circle in FL (it will produce 4 curves) and measure the length of each curve's BCP. Then take a calculator and divide it to half of the curve's diameter. <BR> <BR>Btw, it looks that calcualtion in my previous message may not give the best approximation. It will place the middle point of the curve exactly on the circle, but total approximation error may not be minimal. To calculate the ideal &quot;factor&quot; you need to render a curve and then approximate it with the curve minimizing the <b>total</b> error. As I understand it is how we got the original value.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Well, it's probably not really related to the main issue. But here's an explanation: if you draw a &quot;perfect&quot; circle (using the application's tool, or maybe a physical one and then trace it), and you measure the length of the BCP arms in each quadrant, they are about 0.552 of the whole length. This is the value required in cubic bezier math to get a &quot;perfect&quot; circle. BTW, &quot;perfect&quot; is in quotes because you really can't represent a true circle in beziers (of any order). <BR> <BR>The way this <i>might</i> be related to the main issue is this: if you were to convert a one-sided curve to a near-equivalent two-sided one, some sort of preset factor values might be the trick. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR></div>
