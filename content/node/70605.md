  (@font-face) and take out glyphs you dont need to make the font files smaller.\r\n\r\nThe
  font I am going to do this with has a @font-face kit on\r\nhttp://www.fontsquirrel.com/fonts/DejaVu-Serif\r\nso
  its an open source font\r\n\r\nI've searched google on this, but cant find the post
  I remember reading on it. Once I edit the font I need to regenerate all the version
  of the file again which means the .ttf, .woff, .eot, .svg, .js (cufon)\r\n\r\nAnyone
  know what program to do this with or what website would help regenerate all those
  files?\r\n\r\nThanks"

  body: You can cut them out with FontLab. I don't really see the point. Unless you're
    using tons of @font-faces, the file sizes really aren't all that large. And unless
    you're taking out a lots of glyphs, it won't really affect it.

  body: Oh haha, well in that case it could help I guess. I forgot about Fontsquirrel's
    subsetting, it's pretty helpful.

  body: Funny thing is that some of the DejaVu fonts crash the subsetter. Have not
    figured why...
