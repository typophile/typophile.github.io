  Hydro74.com </a> with some great illustrations, Type treatments and an updated Font
  / Symbol section.\r\n\r\nOn a personal note... Joshua Smith is incredible, it's
  rare to cross a designer that has so much detail and variety to their design. It's
  visually intense. Visit and marvel at his work. (He's also been a member of Typophile
  for almost 4 years now.)   \r\n\r\n"

    who wanted to print out his type treatments. Now they have to use up an extravagant
    amount of black ink to do so. \r\n\r\nMr. Smith you should make a poster with
    all of your type treatments on it to sell or for download as a pdf!"
