  body: "Well, <a href=\"http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/exljbris/calluna\">Calluna</a>
    is neither bad nor expensive&thinsp;\u2014&thinsp;but you could use <a href=\"http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/adobe/minion\">Minion</a>
    instead. It is similar in style, certainly not inferior in quality and you might
    already have it on your machine in a sufficient range of weights. This leaves
    you some room to purchase a complementing display typeface."

  body: "I think Calluna is quite beautiful and holds up well next to other faces
    with much heftier price tags (this is my extremely inexperienced lay-opinion).
    I find the \"direction\" or \"flow\" characteristic to be very nice; it adds character
    without sacrificing legibility or seriousness. Because this \"direction\" is more
    pronounced at larger sizes, I'd feel comfortable using it in both lengthy text
    and display settings.\r\n\r\nAlso, I don't have Minion pre-installed, and I only
    have the bold and italic faces... however, as necessity dictates, I wouldn't be
    at all surprised to find myself buying the rest of them sometime in the future....
