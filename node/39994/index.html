<p>I credit Barbara Kruger more for her inroads into the male dominated 80s art scene (and her impact on graphic design - she redefined red) than for any effect she may have had on consumerism. The average consumer wouldn&rsquo;t know who she is. Not to diminish the power of her work.</p>

<p>The phrase &ldquo;I shop therefore I am&rdquo; is not a mockery of consumerism, but a recognition of it as a cultural imperative. Her important early work, after all, comes soon after the development of cultural studies as an academic discipline. The idea of &ldquo;popular culture&rdquo; was an oxymoron until around 1970.
The graphic style she used was not an imitation of commercial media. It had something in common, certainly, in the image+text combination, and Futura and color bars were popular at the time. But that was her style (she had worked in publishing), and also had resonance with, of course, John Heartfield&rsquo;s work&ndash;another artist who worked as a commercial graphic designer.
It was her medium, her way of expressing herself, not a parody.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Kruger had an exhibition in Glasgow in 2005, commissioned by GoMA, specifically related to violence against women, in her classic agitprop text+image technique:
<a href="http://www.studio-international.co.uk/reports/kruger.asp">http://www.studio-international.co.uk/reports/kruger.asp</a></p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re looking to discuss sexual politics in her work, why not choose that, where she directly addresses the issue?
I wouldn&rsquo;t say she particularly addresses consumerism in her work, although her use of commercial media may give that impression.</p>
<p>Barabara Kruger is one of that generation of &ldquo;second wave&rdquo; feminists, and there&rsquo;s no denying that sexual politics is an important element in her work, but I would echo Ricardo in saying that there&rsquo;s more to it than that, and ironically by focusing on it and pigeonholing her as a consumerism/shopping/women&rsquo;s issues artist, you&rsquo;d be missing the point.</p>
<p>I like what she has to say, and the way she puts words and images together.</p>
<p>At the same time and place as the GoMA exhibit, she showed a more recent direction, an installation (four walls of an enormous room in an old transport terminal) involving four simultaneously screened movies of &ldquo;talking heads&rdquo; she had written and directed, with text captions.</p>

I know Kruger did the work of I Shop Therefore I am but did they have permission to use it? It was bastardised. That&rsquo;s not what my tutor told me. Hmm&hellip;I wonder.</div>
