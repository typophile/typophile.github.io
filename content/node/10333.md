  body: Hello Timothy. <BR>You must said if your image &#40;typography&#41; must have
    a young or a old abordage. Serif, cursive &#40;script&#41; or a sans serif typography?
    <BR> <BR>Regards / Ricardo

  body: Another point of view, this cataloge show only one win? If is it you can use
    the same type face which was used on that win or you can follow the same typography
    abordage of the trademark which distribut that win with the objective to give
    more coeirence to all the product. Its only ideas tell us something with more
    detail. <BR> <BR>Ricardo

  body: What&#39;s the atmosphere of the catalog? <BR>Wines from everywhere, or just
    certain parts of the world? <BR> <BR>I&#39;ve done only one wine list &#40;not
    a catalog&#41;, and I used <BR>Octavian, with its killer italic and nice smallcaps.
    <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>

  body: sorry, more details. it&#39;s more than a wine catalog but still mostly a
    wine catalog with a large offering of diferent wines form california to itali
    to france. the distributer also offers champagnes, scotches, port, etc. the audience
    in mind is younger &#40;early to mid thirties&#41;. the client wants a catolog
    that is &#34;super sexy.&#34; also if it&#39;s not to much to ask i wouldn&#39;t
    mind some suggestions for serif, cursive &#40;script&#41; and sans  typefaces.
    <BR> <BR>thanks in advance.

  body: 'I&#39;d go with FF Scala. Modern, yet humanist. Legible and robust even in
    small print, and the option to also use the sans serif. Clarendon might also be
    a good choice, but the design has to be specifically retromodern for that.  <BR>
    <BR>Why not Mrs. Eaves... it&#39;s a nice typeface.  <BR>tribute and Filosofia
    also spring to mind... and what was that fishbook font font from mvb... although
    maybe that is a bit TOO heavy on the classic touch. '
