body: So this font was found on an old book. Having a real hard time trying to classify
  this font. I presume it's hand rendered with a calligraphic pen but i have no info
  on the origins or style of these letter forms. Anyone here got any ideas?[img:sites/default/files/old-images/die_eisernen_riegel_zerbrechen_5613.jpg]
