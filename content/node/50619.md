  body: "I think this is Minion Black with some modifications to the outline. Note
    in this comparison how some of the shapes are identical (in particular, the counters):\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/minion-2_3582.jpg]"

  body: Brilliant work, Mark. The counters. Something very few beyond the type designers
    would think to check.

  body: It still has the same "gestalt" in spite of the changes (especially the "a"),
    even though the details didn't fit. It's like how you can recognize a person,
    even if they change their hair style or grow a mustache. I didn't notice the identical
    counters until I compared them side by side.

  body: "excellent. The serif on the g is very similar to that of the baskerville
    g. I think? \r\n\r\nSo its not that typeface directly?"

  body: No, it's a modified typeface. Most likely, it was converted to outlines for
    modification and is being used as art rather than as a font.
