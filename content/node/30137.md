  body: The <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/60/">web developer toolbar</a>
    for Firefox will do what you want. After you have installed it, click on the "Information"
    menu and select "Display Element Information". When you mouse over text it will
    tell you (among other things) typeface and font size. I am still looking for a
    plug-in that displays all type info such as font weight, line height, word spacing,
    etc.

    tell the difference. I only looked at it quickly, but seriously, no difference.
    Maybe I'm not cut out to be a typographer after all :-0\r\n\r\nThis isn't a Firefox
    Plugin, but it sorta can tell you what you want:\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://culturedcode.com/xyle/\">Xyle

    I would love to use that, but alas I haven't a MAC. However it's in the must have
    applications list for when I do."
