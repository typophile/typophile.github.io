  <BR>Rebranding this mark for a small/regional company who are distributors of mid-range
  to high end office furniture. They&#39;ve been in business since 1986. URL: <a href="http://www.shaddy.com"
  target="_blank">www.shaddy.com</a>  <BR> <BR>The toughest part was finding the right
  font for the word SIM. In these sketches, the word SIM uses Argus Extra Bold and
  for the tagline Eurostile or Helvetica Neue. I invite any suggestions and/or alternatives
  for font use, color scheme, and design.  <BR> <BR>Best, <BR>MJ'

  body: I think 3 works, I&#39;m not a fan of knocking out a logo out of a box. As
    for the colors I like the rich red but I like OFFICE FURNITURE in black. Its just
    my opinion

  body: 'I like the Argus for the main logotype, but I&#39;m not too keen on any of
    the others. Could be that it&#39;s too early in the am for lucidity <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"
    ALT=":-&#41;" BORDER=0> <BR> <BR>Just some notes: if you&#39;re doing the knockout
    thing, make sure the box is big enough &#40;1, 5&#41; as opposed to too tight
    &#40;2, somewhat&#41;. Eurostile caption text flows well with their existing logo
    but not so well with the new. <BR> <BR>What about incorporating elements of this
    logo: <BR>http://www.shaddy.furnishgroup.com/sw/themes/930/images/40004647_title.gif
    <BR> <BR>It&#39;s part of the header inside their site and doesn&#39;t look too
    bad IMO.'

  body: Thanks for the feedback guys. <BR> <BR>I&#39;ll have to agree with both of
    you.  I prefer the logos without a knockout, and i do not think the Eurostile
    font is appropriate for the caption text. <BR> <BR>I&#39;m looking at option 4
    at the moment; however, i&#39;m still undecided if Helvetica Neue is appropropriate
    for the caption.  In addition, would anyone suggest the use of ALL caps over lower
    case in this instance? <BR> <BR>Cheers, <BR>MJ

  body: I don&#39;t mind using all caps as long as you use small caps rather than
    titling caps. Something about a whole line of text in title caps just makes baby
    Jesus cry. <BR> <BR>What about mixed case? As long as you don&#39;t use Meta or
    something similarly high-tech looking, you won&#39;t risk a cliche logo.
