      glad you like the face Colin. Listen, 32,668 glyphs. \r\nThat's 3p per glyph,

    put it like that but it's still priced way out of my league. I'd have my credit
    card out in a flash if it was nearer \xA3500 so I'll hold out for some alternative
    pack or format options in the future.\r\n\r\nAre there any package prices/discount
    options for (Regular Non-italics - Thin. Extra Light, Light, Regular, Medium,
    Bold, Extra Bold, Heavy and Ultra ++ the Condensed Pack)? The Starter Pack is
    too basic and there doesn't seem to be anything between this and the Professional
    Pack. I don't use italics in my work much and the individual weight prices are
    a little costly when trying to build custom packs.\r\n\r\nThanks again,\r\nColin"

  body: "Sebastian - Soho hits a nice sweet spot in slab land. It's clear you've been
    reading <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/theguardian/story/0,,1566047,00.html\">the
    <em>Guardian</em></a> and it's not a bad idea to offer something of the same flavor
    to those who appreciate <a href=\"http://christianschwartz.com/gdnegyp.shtml\">Schwartz's</a>
    and Barnes' work on that paper.\r\n\r\nI'm interested in how you came about the
    double-story lowercase 'g'. The connection between bowls is very cramped. Do you
    not recommend this 'g' for small settings?"

    body: "Thanks Stephen,\r\n\r\nJust for the record Soho was well under way in mid
      2004. \r\nSoho is in many respects Neo Slab. As early as 2003 it \r\nwas clear
      that slabs were gaining momentum in the UK in \r\na big way and I wanted to
      try to capitalise on that. \r\n\r\nI showed the design as a 'coming soon' design
      in May 2005 \r\nat a presentation for Faces in the UK. I showed slides of the
      \r\nunreleased sans and the slab serif versions. It didn't arrive \r\nuntil
      nearly two years later because I bit off more than I could \r\nchew in my spare
      time. It was originally a much bigger project \r\nand if I'd stuck to the original
      plan it wouldn't have got \r\nreleased until 2037.\r\n\r\nI personally like
      the fullness and openness of the g you mention. \r\nI don't personally think
      there is a problem until you go under 10pt.\r\nWith 3 g's to choose from I'm
      hoping there's one for every occasion."

  body: "Thanks for the background, Sebastian. It's easy for us critics and users
    to forget how many years can pass from initial concept to release. Don't be afraid
    of revealing what inspired you along the way, be it Guardian Egyptian or otherwise.\r\n\r\nAnd
    thank you for the 3 'g's! I contend that the huge counters of your 2-story 'g'
    create a distracting heaviness in the center of the letter. But one of the great
    benefits of the OpenType era is that type makers are incorporating alternate forms
    where they might not have before."

  body: "Hello Stephen,\r\n\r\nIn terms of influences I guess a nod to Dispatch by
    \r\nCyrus Highsmith which must have influenced my decision \r\nmaking on some
    level as the only 'modern' slab serif \r\ndesign with multiple widths I was aware
    of at the time. \r\n\r\nDefinitely a nod to the open nature of Gerard Unger's
    \r\ntypefaces like Argo and Dave Farey's Cachet which informed \r\nthe design
    of Neo, the starting point for Soho. I've \r\nalways liked both a great deal.\r\n\r\nThe
    Guardian typeface is excellent and may well have \r\nhad an influence on some
    level since it's appearance \r\nbut I've been working on this slab design for
    a long time. \r\n\r\nI actually dug out a slide from that May 05 presentation
    \r\nwhich I'm attaching. The designs obviously matured since \r\nthen and become
    more conservative but you can see where \r\nit's heading.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/28_6326.jpg]"

  body: "I am very fond of the Guardian Egyptian, and to my eyes Soho is a very different
    animal. The Guardian Egyptian is for a start not a true slab serif as it has angled
    serifs, rather than square ones, as this does. Its starting point is the proportions
    of traditional serifed faces, whereas Soho is much wider. It also has more prominent
    'slabs'. \r\n\r\nLooking at the 'influences' I can definitely see the influence
    of Chachet on Neo Sans, but I don't see where the Argo comes in..."

      William,\r\n\r\nI'm just talking in broad terms about a sans design with \r\nsuch
      open terminals. Argo is obviously more nuanced and 'typographic'.\r\nI think
      Argo has influenced a lot of modern sans designs."
