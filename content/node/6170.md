body: If anyone would like to share, explain, enlighten or warn any information regarding
  registering a typeface name I would be most grateful.  <BR> <BR>After working on
  my design for months now I found a name I like &#40;that is not used - I hope&#41;
  and would like to proceed in this area sooner than later. <BR> <BR>Is it really
  that hard? How long does it take? Is a lawyer really needed? Where does one start
  after they think they have found a name that is yet unused? <BR> <BR>smc <BR>

    of question that never gets an entirely reliable answer. <BR>c&#41; Those in a
    position to own typeface names will rarely help you do it yourself. <BR> <BR>hhp

  body: This is an excellent question, and it&#39;s good that you are concerned about
    it. <BR> <BR>There are a couple of things you can do on your own. First, conduct
    as much research independently as possible. Go to all the major foundry and distributor
    sites, such as Linotype, Agfa Monotype, Adobe, Font Shop, Bitstream, myfonts,
    Phil&#39;s Fonts, etc., and do a search of their databases to see if the name
    is in use within their published libraries. Also check the more prominent indie
    foundry sites, such as Emigre, House, Font Bureau, P22, etc. They are all likely
    to have trademarks on typeface names. Search the Typophile forums as well, to
    see if any works-in-progress are using the name you&#39;re interested in. This
    won&#39;t cover every type design in the world, but it&#39;s a good start. <BR>
    <BR>Another method to ensure at least some degree of uniqueness in your font&#39;s
    name is to include the initials of your foundry, or some other identifier. Akin
    to ITC Conduit, Adobe Garamond, P22 Preissig, FF Blur, etc. It&#39;s not a perfect
    solution, but it is helpful. <BR> <BR>I&#39;m almost certain that you&#39;ll need
    an attorney if you actually want to do a formal trademark search and registration.

  body: I&#39;m suddenly painfully aware how fuzzy my knowledge in this area has become,
    despite having done it in the past. <BR> <BR>As I understand it, you can trademark
    the name, but not the design itself. Does that sound right? Methinks that the
    font pirates out there try to beat this loophole by renaming the font to something
    new when they bundle their &#34;1001 fonts&#34; CDs. <BR> <BR>It used to be that
    if you want to copyright a font, you needed to copyright it as <i>software code</i>,
    and file it accordingly. I&#39;ve seen a program that takes a font file and converts
    it into a large text file, which you would print out and send in with your copyright
    application. However, I think there have been <a href="http://www.typeright.org/suit_01.html">rulings</a>
    which have changed the nature of what you would file today. <BR> <BR>If someone
    could clarify these points, I think we would all benefit.  <BR> <BR>Typeright.org
    has some good <a href="http://www.typeright.org/features.html">articles</a> in
    this realm. <BR>

  body: Thanks for the feedback. It has given me a good launchpad. I am remembering
    the <i>poor mans</i> copyright suddenly - a sealed self addressed, post-marked
    envelope containing the pertinent information. It is, after all, better than nothing.
    <BR> <BR>In the meanwhile, here is a lengthy but good read about <a href="http://www.typotheque.com/articles/gorilla.html">how
    to</a> name. <BR> <BR>I am going to take a swim through <a href="http://www.typeright.org">typeright.org</a>
    and see what I can find. Thanks for the pointers. <BR> <BR>Wish me luck. <BR>

  body: the poor mans copyright is a old wives tale...  I will post more tommorow
    on how to copyright the name.  Its costs around $300 to do it nationally. and
    usually takes about 4 months or so to have it complete.  you do it with the library
    of congress, asuming your in the states. <BR> <BR>more later.  bed now <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"

    But, I think there is enough of a difference and no one is competing, really.
    Are they? If anything the name here at typophile is more an homage. But I guess
    that doesn&#39;t matter. Or does it?  <BR> <BR><i>This is the reason I would never

  body: "I know this is an older thread and perhaps past the point of usefulness for
    Sean, but naming a typeface design or family is less science and more voodoo.\r\n\r\nI
    have personally named as well as supervised the naming of easily over two-hundred
    typefaces (excluding weights) while I was managing the Type Design group during
    the Compugraphic through Agfa Corp. days.\r\n\r\nThe only reason why you should
    take great care in naming is that you truly expect to profit from the sale of
    the fonts. If you truly have designed a uniquely recognizable face and not just
    a derivitive then you should seek reliable counsel. In this case both a general
    and FULL legal trademark searches are necessary.\r\n\r\nIt's not enough to search
    just typeface names. Once you get a copyright lawyer a full search might disclose
    potential conflicts by a trade name owned by someone else. It also depends on
    the strength of an existing brand name. Example - \"Mustang\" might be okay, but
    \"Corvette\" has no chance.\r\n\r\nGenerally, even if you named a typeface it's
    apt to get changed if a large foundry decided to license and market it.\r\n\r\nAs
    with fine artists, performers, authors and the like, once a person or thing becomes
    \"popular\" it then becomes a branding issue for marketing purposes. \r\n\r\nMany
    custom typefaces for clients were basically mandated by the companies that used
    them, such as IBM Didot, Keds Rounded.\r\n\r\nHistorically, many times designs
    were named by or as homage to the designer, typecaster or foundry; Bodoni, Plantin,
    Benguiat, Stone, Antique Olive, &c. (please, no flaming on my use of ampersand).\r\n\r\nTypefaces
    were often named from their initial use in publishing (Times New Roman, ITC Avant
    Garde Gothic, Hiroshige). Instances when foundries developed uniquely derivitive
    cuts, the foundry name was added (Bauer Bodoni, Stempel Garamond, ITC Garamond,
    Adobe Garamond).\r\n\r\nOther than that, places, things, girl friends, food and
    pet names comprise the majority of typeface names.\r\n\r\nBasic rule: The greater
    the revenue potential, the more critical the branding.\r\n\r\n--------------------------------\r\nYes,
    I'm old, but I'm back in style!"
