  body: Well, it's not the same font, but it kind of reminds me of a heavily modified
    Serif Gothic Heavy.

  body: I would say that you could find similars and with some Illustrator handywork
    come awfully close. Most likely, your samples were done by hand.

    more black</a>" section of our extra bold font list has a few that might work.
    But I agree that hand lettering is the way to go.
