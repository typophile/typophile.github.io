  but.\r\nI remember having to look for the Kaufmann typface and having it named as
  something else.\r\n\r\nDoes anyone know what name that might be? I think it was
  something with coffee?\r\n\r\n\r\nThanks"

  body: "FYI -- Kaufmann Bold is the very first typeface I used. It was for a business
    card that was a class assignment in Print Shop during Jr. High (7th grade). \r\n\r\nWe
    had to learn the California Job Case, set the card using a composing stick, lock
    it up using furniture, set the pins to hold the card stock in place, then print
    on a hand press.\r\n\r\nTo paraphrase Robert Duvall in \"Apocalypse Now\" --\r\n<em>There's
    nothing like the smell of ink in the morning.</em>"
