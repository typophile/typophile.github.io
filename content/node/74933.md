  \"Psycho Killer\" set in a typeface? Or is that an effect on a typeface? I am working
  on a project influenced by this album cover and I cannot seem to figure this out.
  Any help would be much appreciated.\r\n\r\nThank you for your time,\r\n\r\nDuncan\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/TalkingHeads-1977-PsychoKiller_4395.jpg]"
