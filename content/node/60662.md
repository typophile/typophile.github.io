  proofs before casting hotmetal on an Intertype using \"Linotype Permanent\"\r\n\r\nThis
  is a typical sans serif jobbing font that I have available at my favourite Hot metal
  typesetting shop.  I don't plan to use it digitally except for layout and line length
  checking so it can be any similar font with the same character metrixes.\r\n\r\nThe

    in the latter is actually nicer.\r\nFolio has a different Q."
