  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">i am currently taking a Typography One evening course and i was wondering if people could tell me what i should expect from the class.

i was hoping that we would start off with some nitty-gritty exploration of the mechanics of type and would be learning by inking or hand-lettering letterforms. so far, we haven't really done any of that. we just dove right in and were given assignments with almost no discussion about basic things that i had expected to learn (spacing, scale, measurement, etc.)

i enrolled in the class to learn the very fundamentals of working with type, but it seems like we are skipping far ahead without first learning the basics.

am i wrong to assume that the class would cover first-things first?

btw, the course is offered by a "respected" art school.

thanks for any insight.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Well, everyone I know seems to define "first-things first" a little differently, and I suspect that there are as many "ideal" ideas for a Type 1 class as there are Type 1 instructors.

I can only say what I learned in Type 1. We learned to group some typefaces in five, very basic categories (sans serif = Futura, old style = Garamond, transitional = Baskerville, modern = Bodoni, slab serif = Serifa).

We also learned how to properly space letters next to one another, how to space words, and lastly, how to space a few lines. That was it, and actually, that was quite a bit of work. We had a series to accompanying type history/terminology lectures. The stuff went over my head, but later, after having it repeated to me several times over the next semester and a hlaf, I got it, and was glad.

btw, my course was offered by a "respected" art school ;-)

hope that helps…</div>

i sort of thought that we should be learning about spacing words and lines and stuff like that before being given assignments to design a poster, etc.</div>

James Craig's <em>Designing with Type</em> is used at many schools. There are project descriptions and many student samples of assignments you can review at the official web site <a href="http://www.designingwithtype.com/" target="new">DesigningWithType.com</a>.</div>

i already have (and have read) 
the elements of typographic style
stop stealing sheep & find out how type works
thinking with type by ellen lupton

as well as various other design and type books, so i am not a complete neophyte, but i was just expecting that there would be more discussion of the mechanics of using type before we were given the task of putting it to use on a practical level.

i know i don't know, which is why i am asking ;)

		<div class="commentbody">Without knowing the approach of your instructor, an initial "practical use" of type could lead to a better understanding of the mechanics <em>provided</em> that the class assignments are critiqued on the basis of fundamental typography and not "graphic design" criteria.

That could stimulate class discussion and participation as analysis <em>after the fact</em> with the intent of redoing the assignment with new found understanding of fundamentals, followed by another group critique.

As I said, I don't know the planned curriculum or stated outcome of the course (this should be clearly stated in the school's course description), but several instructors have voiced their personal frustrations to me regarding the building of effective and viable typography courses.

Incidentally, I have just devised an interesting class assignment for beginning graphic design and typography students. It's in the early stages and not field tested yet, but the intent is to help students develop a sensitivity to type [[color]] and how to use it as an element of page layout.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I find it surprising that there is no intro to type history at the start of the course to help ground you and show you where type comes from. After all, how can you understand where you're going if you don't know where you've been? Was there a pre-requisite for the course in terms of knowledge or understanding? I'd certainly address the instructor or school regarding this.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">There are as many ways to teach as there are to learn.

Questioning your teacher's lesson plan is one thing, expressing what you hope to gain is another. If you weren't given a lesson plan (or you were and it is devoid of the history and mechanics), I would suggest you approach your professor. Don't ask them to change the schedule, but let them know what you're interested in.

At the very least, they could give you extra-curricular guidance or inform you of the appropriate class to apply for next semester. It may be that be as simple as a misleading nomenclature of the courses.

Good Luck,
