  body: "Logofive.html - absolutely not liking - too much exercise/gym/athletics/dance
    feeling to it. Consider the abstract human concept  a dead end.\r\n\r\nLogofour.html
    - there's something nice about the simplicity of these approaches - they're straight-forward,
    nothing too dramatic, and they would help the audience focus more on your work/portfolio.
    Not sure about 9 & 10 - just a tad too faddish and for some reason I keep thinking
    of the Phillies (American baseball team). Also the fact you had to explain the
    concept suggests that it's probably not the strongest. I think 8 is probably the
    best from this group - straightforward, simple, and nice.\r\n\r\nLogothree.html
    looks like logofour.html and so I have no comment.\r\n\r\nLogotwo.html - uh...no.
    Too cliche. Also you overuse the shutter imagery by placing it on absolutely every
    single \"o\".\r\n\r\nLogo.html - stay away from color until you've nailed the
    concept. I know I've seen the brush/shutter concept used before so its not new
    and you're not really innovating here, so stay away from it as it's a bit old
    and cliche.\r\n\r\nThat's my 2 cents. Hope it helps.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
