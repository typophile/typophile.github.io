  think the font is the same in both pictures but just different size. But what is
  the name of the font?\r\n\r\nThank you in advance!"

  body: "Actually, both font and the context in which it is used -- a \"technical
    article\" -- suggests this is the original <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_Modern\">Computer
    Modern</a>, the default font for TeX created by Donald E. Knuth.\r\n\r\nOne of
    the tell-tale signs would be the proportions are ever so slightly different for
    different sizes. In its native habitat, CM fonts are scaled and spaced according
    to its intended output size. The image is not large enough to accurately measure
    it, but I'd eyeball that the large bold title is more flattened than the body
    copy.\r\n\r\nThese are not regular fonts; there are no exact counterparts in TTF
    or OTF format, because the scaling is done on the fly. Even OpenType features
    cannot do that (yet?). So best you can hope for is a precalculated font for 8pt,
    another for 10pt, and yet another for 12pt. (And so on.) If you do, beware the
    odd character mapping you will find in fast rip-offs. TeX has one of the weirdest
    native character maps <em>ever</em>. For example, it has no \"space\" glyph --
    just because you don't ever need one inside TeX."
