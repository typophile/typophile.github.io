body: Has anyone been to this particular museum in Offenbach? I recently had dinner
  with the daughter of the director and, although she didn't seem to know much about
  it, explained to me that it was a museum related to book arts and typography. If
  anyone has any more details, I'd love to know.

    Rare Book rooms. Go there first and then by all means go to the Klingspor. Amazing
    collection.\r\n\r\nMichael"

    still own millions of matrizes from Stempel and produce new (old) Stempel fonts,
    not only for the museum, but for still existing letterpress fanatics around the
    world (in german height 23,56 mm or anglo-american heigt 23,32 mm).\r\n\r\nMr.
    Gerstenberg, the owner, is the last in Europe, who produces lead fonts professional,
    after Mr. Hartmann from Bauersche in Barcelona stopped the production end of last
    year.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.schriftenservice-d-stempel.de/kontakt.htm\r\n\r\n\r\nGeorg\r\n_______________________________________________\r\n\u201EIch

  body: "The Klingspor Museum is delightful! The building is small, so there is not
    a \"permanent collection\" on display. Instead, they have rotating exhibitions.
    Like any museum, some exhibitions will probably interest you more than others.
    Just take a look at their calendar for the year.\r\n\r\nThe real Klingspor Museum
    gem is their library, which you could get an appointment to visit. "
