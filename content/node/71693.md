  if anyone knows what typeface is used for this. I've loaded the picture here: [[http://twitpic.com/1pc1oj
  | Joe Blow]]\r\n\r\nIt's the only picture I have that I took from the packaging.
  \r\n\r\nI also have seen the trailer for the movie The American and at the end they're
  using a certain font for the credits. I took a screen shot of it at the end which
  can be seen here: [[http://twitpic.com/2024t9 | The American]]\r\n \r\nYour help
  is greatly appreciated in identifying these two fonts. Thank you. \r\n\r\n"

  body: "Jan, thank you for your reply. I'm looking into it right now. \r\n\r\nFlorian,
    thanks for taking the time to reply. By maltreated I'm assuming you mean the typeface
    was altered in a way, or do you mean just not used correctly? Thanks for your
    input. "
