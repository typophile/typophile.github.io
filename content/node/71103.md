    thing is far from daunting. ;)\r\n\r\nBtw, for those who missed the discussion
    on this immensely important topic of Ikea's font choice last year \u2013 read
    some of it here:\r\nhttp://typophile.com/node/61222"

  body: "It seems some country subpages work better than others, and some browsers
    work better than others. Tweaking the fonts for external pages requires playing
    some tricks and it is not really reliable. Please be assured that the JAF webfont
    service as such works consistenly across browsers \u2013 I realise that these
    fun projects may give the wrong impression regarding the reliability of my webfonts
    (which, btw, are not even used in the Futurizer).\r\n\r\nNick, which country did
    you try? I found that some pages (such as Canada) are particularly Flash-heavy,
    which doesn't work very well in Safari, and others (such as Germany) have subframes
    that display Verdana (which might be possible to fix).\r\n\r\nMiguel, are you
    really seeing Arial? That's strange. I tested with Chrome Win and Mac and it shows
    Futura for me, except for some Verdana in Flash and inline frames. Do (referrer-controlled)
    webfonts generally work in your browser?"
