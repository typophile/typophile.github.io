  I have no control over. The process is that I receive pictures that I will then
  deconstruct and try to read their meanings from there through typography I will
  design a visual representation of what I found. If you are interested let me know.
  Thanks.\r\nReading into images\r\n"

    body: "I am a student of the University of Wollongong studying Graphic Design.
      I am in my final year of study and am doing a Major Project. I am interested
      in type so I decided to explore type through an investigative process. My aim
      is too see how I can generate a type by being influenced by things outside my
      control. That is why I am asking for a photo from a random source. I thought
      that Typophile would be a good place to start seeing as though it is a forum
      for people interested in typography.\r\nAll that has to happen is you send me
      a photograph of whatever you want, I will try to then use this photograph to
      inform my typeface. The pic would have to be at a res of around 200-300 and
      at a standard photograph dimension of  8\u201D X 10\u201D.\r\nIf your interested
      my e-mail is jlm80@uow.edu.au   \r\n"
