  this internet site are to alter the k/K shape letters to \u0915/\u0915 lower and
  upper case shaped letters on keyboards and other things for spiritual philosophy
  reasons.  There are reasons for this that have been mentioned on the internet, for
  example over on this internet site: http://Kalphabet.googlepages.com (old google-sites
  address) or http://sites.google.com/site/Kalphabet (new google-sites address).\r\n\r\nThe
  downloads on this internet site are typing stic\u0915er templates that could be
  used to print and then stic\u0915 on \u0915eyboards and other things that have k/K
  shape, for example, fax machines, mobile or cell phones, PDA and even old fashioned
  typewriters etc.\r\n\r\nThe typing stic\u0915er templates here available from this
  internet site were used for printing by using an online printing service called
  'Moo' or 'Moo.com,' http://www.moo.com and the typing stic\u0915ers printed were
  relatively cheap under GB Pounds \xA37 (in yr. 2012) compared to buying custom printed
  \u0915eyboard stic\u0915ers or buying a Cherry MX \u0915eyboard with custom \u0915eycaps.
  \ Moo.com has Stic\u0915ers x 90 product (in yr. 2012)  see http://uk.moo.com/products/stickerbooks.html
  and the description for them is, for example:\r\n\r\n\"Use your artwor\u0915 or
  photography to create 90 postage stamp-sized stic\u0915ers, bound into a poc\u0915et-size
  boo\u0915. Perforated along one side, each stic\u0915er sheet is easy to tear out
  and share.\"\r\n\r\n\"MOO Stic\u0915ers are printed on thic\u0915, high quality
  vinyl. Photos and artwor\u0915 print equally well, and the glossy finish ma\u0915es
  the colours 'pop'!\"\r\n\r\n\"'Printfinity' gives you the option of printing a different
  design on every single Stic\u0915er in the boo\u0915. Choose a range of different
  photos or designs.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nPlease note that User would have to cut these to
  size with a scissor.  \r\n\r\nDownloadable from here are alter k/K shape letter
  stic\u0915er templates so that other Users too could benefit from customizing their
  PC, laptop or netboo\u0915 \u0915eyboards and also other things cheaply by downloading
  from here.  \r\n\r\nThere are stic\u0915ers for the offending K shape letter \u0915eycap
  seen on \u0915eyboards. \r\nStic\u0915ers for other \u0915eycaps that have the offending
  k/K shape  in within different words, for example, \"Caps Lock\" have been catered
  for. \r\nItalic and both white and blac\u0915 \u0915eyboard colors have also been
  catered for.\r\nAlso laptop and netboo\u0915 sizes were seen and hopefully have
  been catered for.   \r\nDevices were seen that a person might have where there be
  devices displaying the k/K shaped letter inside words and thus different sizes have
  been catered for.\r\nBoth double-dec\u0915er and single-dec\u0915er options for
  certain \u0915eycaps have been catered for.\r\n\r\nScissors to trim the stic\u0915ers
  would be required.  \r\n\r\nThe fonts used for the typing stic\u0915er templates
  are BBT font and Rail Model font.  There are 4 templates that could be downloaded
  by Users from here and then they could all be uploaded to Moo.com in one go:\r\n\r\n1.
