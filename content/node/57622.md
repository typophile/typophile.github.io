  but I'm not sure. \r\n\r\nThe V, R, G and E are distinct as are the k, v and g along
  with the 3. \r\n\r\nThanks bunches for your help!\r\n\r\nGraham"

  body: "To me, this looks like a hand-drawn composite design, based on a number of
    Art Nouveau typefaces (sort of). in other words, I am not sure that this is an
    actual Art Nouveau type style. I think it may be an artistic idea of an Art Nouveau
    look. Certainly I can't say that I know every Art Nouveau font, but the books
    I have showing them are pretty good, and this doesn't seem to match anything in
    them.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
