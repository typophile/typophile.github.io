    target=\"new\">ITC Elan</a> is also very close, and possibly a bit less expensive.\r\n\r\n-

  body: 'Kind of off-topic, but also sort of on topic: I helped John Langdon with
    a proposal while he was doing work for this movie, he created a logo for the movie
    name and I have yet to see it in any of the previews, I comped up his work into
    the real situation he was proposing to the creators of the movie. I''m wondering
    if they''re just holding out or using it for content inside the movie in the situation
    John proposed rather than the actual title? I guess I''ll have to wait and see
    the movie.'
