  I work at, and she mentioned that design within large type books could really be
  worked on. As far as typography goes, I found a page that mentions some type size
  and line spacing guidelines, but nothing about specific fonts. I know that certain
  fonts read better at smaller sizes - are there fonts that work better at larger
  sizes for greater readability? (Especially for those who have limited eyesight.)\r\n\r\nIt
  makes sense that larger fonts automatically make it easier to read, but frequently
  the fonts chosen are unattractive... If anybody has any information on this or suggestions
  about fonts, that would be great.\r\n\r\nDavid"

  body: "> are there fonts that work better at larger sizes for greater readability?\r\n\r\nIn
    terms of \"normal\" adult readability:\r\n1) There is an upper limit, probably
    around 15,\r\nabove which readability drops like a rock.\r\n2) The larger the
    size the smaller the x-height should be.\r\n3) Physically very large books are
    meant to be held (or often placed, like on a lectern) further from the reader;
    so the type basically ends up looking as large as let's say 11 point type in a
    regularly-held book.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, for people with very poor eyesight,\r\nreally
    large fonts with really large x-heights help.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
