body: "Hello all,\r\n\r\nI was recommended this site for logo/design critiques. I'd
  love some feedback.\r\n\r\nI'm working on a new logo for a video production company
  that specializes in digital filmmaking and webTV, called Redhill Media. I've got
  a couple of concept logos in the works and was hoping to get some feedback at this
  stage. I'm not a logo designer by trade (though I do have a background in graphic
  design as a motion designer), so I'm looking for any pointers you can give me. \r\n\r\nLove'em?
  Tell me why! Hate'em? Tell me why! Can you think of a way to improve on any of them?
  I'd love to hear it. \r\n\r\nThanks in advance,\r\nJustin\r\n\r\n\r\nFirst concept.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/rm
  color sample 1 - brown_6456.jpg]\r\nAdded \"h\" ascender upon request (they like
  to spell it RedHill even though it's one word).\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/rhm-concept-logo-small_6637.jpg]\r\nTrying
  to play on the \"digital filmmaking\" and \"web/tech\" aspects of the company...
  might be too much though.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/rm-digitized-logo-small_4091.jpg]

    for me ... but that might be personal preference than anything.\r\n\r\ngot any
    more background info on where the name came from, why it was chosen etc, that
    would help a lot in pushing the design in a great direction?\r\n\r\nIn saying
    that ... what you have isn't all bad (by any means) I just feel they're fairly
    generic outcomes ... i.e, you only started scratching the surface of the covered
    ideas.\r\n\r\nThere's an idea ... a scratched digital surface ... where ideas
    (and digital video) are uncovered.\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n----------\r\n<strong>Paul

  body: "Hi Paul,\r\n\r\nI've been getting a mixed reaction about the typefaces treatment.
    Some who really like it, others who have found it distracting. So far they like
    it.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, there isn't any more info on the name and it doesn't
    appear to have any special meaning (just sounded cool, I guess). I've definitely
    tried the \"hills\" idea but also didn't want to go with anything too obvious
    or cliched.\r\n\r\nAs it stands, the three humps (\"hills\" if you will) created
    by the \"r\" and \"m\" represent the three founders of the company. That info
    not obviously being apparent to anyone not in the know, but they seemed to like
    that idea so far. I've been trying to make the three \"hills\" concept more apparent
    in different ways, but it always comes off poorly (or at least so far).\r\n\r\nAs
    far as your scratched digital surface idea, though not bad (and any and all ideas
    are extremely appreciated right now), I'm envisioning it as a little more complexity
    in details than I believe to be appropriate. They've also made it apparent to
    me that the goals are something simplistic and iconic (they are looking for easy
    scalability, and detailed scratched digital surfaces are going to get funky when
    small). \r\n\r\nMaybe an abstract symbol or shape (I've tried numerous abstract
    hill shapes... nothing seemed to work so far though)...\r\n\r\nAnyway... I'm still
    at it, so should I come up with any more interesting mockups, I'll be sure to
    post them.\r\n\r\nThanks again for your time/input!"

  body: "A new \"three hills\" approach. I'd like to say it still resembles an \"r\"
    and an \"m\" as well (really more of an \"s\" than an \"r\", but can maybe work
    on that). Thoughts on this direction?\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/redhill-three-hills-logo-small_6676.jpg]"

  body: I'm thinking I like the latest concept better. Although, you may want to change
    the red to the middle "hill" to bring that more into the focus and reenforce the
    name. It does run the risk of being a little obvious. Also, is the typeface being
    used set in stone?

  body: "Thanks for the input imavery,\r\n\r\nI do have a red middle hill version
    as well (below) that does definitely work better for emphasizing the name. My
    desire with the left hill being red version was to try to have the hills form
    the \"r\" and \"m\" like before (even if only on a very abstract level). The \"m\"
    not being so hard, but as it stands the red hill obviously resembles an \"s\"
    too much. I'm still playing with it, but if it can't be done effectively I will
    likely go with the middle red hill (still playing with transparencies, hill shape/heights,
    etc. as well).\r\n\r\nAs far as the typeface, no, it is not set in stone. I am
    getting mixed feelings about it from different sources and am open to suggestions.\r\n\r\nRegards.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/rm-three-hills-middle-red_6143.jpg]"

  body: "If you won't be able to make those hills readable, then the middle one should
    be red. But if you do make it, than you'll have to make the first one red.\r\n\r\nBut.
    If you go in the direction of hills, simplify type. Don't use those unfinished
    strokes, because you do need just one symbol in your logo, not more. Logos with
    more than one emphasized visual specialities tend to be confusing.\r\n\r\nBu beside
    all these. I like the hills approach much more.\r\n___________\r\n<em>Robert Koritnik</em>"
