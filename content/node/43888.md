body: I remember awhile back that House Industries mentioned they were working on
  a set of typefaces based on the work of Tim Biskup. I'm a big fan of his work and
  I wondered if anyone had heard if it's still being released. I haven't heard a peep
  about it for quite some time.

  body: I haven't heard anything either. IMO it's always best to contact the foundry
    directly with these types of inquiries.
