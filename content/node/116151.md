body: Hey guys! I'm currently working on some collateral material for a brand I've
  created. I'm looking for a serif style font that has variations in their baselines
  for its numericals. Fonts in the vein of [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/tilde/poster-bodoni|Poster
  Bodoni]] or [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/dootype/encorpada-classic|Encorpada Classic]]
  are what I've been playing with. Thanks for any suggestions!

  body: "The type of numerals you're after are called \"old style figures\" or \"ranging
    figures\" or (more rarely, but quite suitably) \"text figures\". They were unpopular
    for about a century (after being the standard style for text cuts of typefaces
    for the previous four centuries or so), but have recently had a significant resurgence
    \u2013 just about any professional serif face designed in the past decade (and
    quite a few in the preceding ones) will have them somewhere, and quite a few will
    have them as standard.\r\n\r\nThat said, the high-contrast style you've been looking
    at (the \"didones\" or \"moderns\" originally appearing in the nineteenth century)
    feature old style numerals more rarely than most \u2013 mainly because that's
    precisely when they went out of fashion, so the original fonts now revived often
    didn't have them. Here's some that MyFonts throws up for a search for didone+old-style
    numerals:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/search/tag%3Adidone+tag%3A%22old-style+numerals%22/fonts/"

    lining and OSF \uFB01gures in most of my typefaces, so don\u2019t tag it with
    a keyword, which is why it didn\u2019t show up in the MyFonts search.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
