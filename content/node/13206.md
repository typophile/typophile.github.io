  body: "Hrant posed that same question just before the Typophile Relaunch. It seems
    that the critique section is not the motor behind Typophile that it once was,
    or could be. He suggested that visitors spend more time in that section (and maybe
    less in others?)\u2026\r\n\r\nTypophile feedback can be quite helpfull.\r\n__\r\nwww.typeoff.de"

  body: "a few thoughts:\r\n\r\nwith the relaunch it's hard(er) for me to really track
    what's going on in the critique section. this is because i haven't really caught
    on to the whole rss thing, there are no longer emails concerning new posts in
    this area, and the critique folders are all in a subdirectory that doesn't display
    when it's been updated from the main forums page.\r\n\r\nalso with the update,
    some people may not have figured how to upload samples of their work. as of now,
    attachments can only be made by the thread's author to the first post in a thread.
    so if you want to show updates, you must edit your initial post and add another
    attachment there. (i THINK that should work)\r\n\r\nand even before the relaunch
    the critique section was waning, it's true. i think part of this is because fewer
    designs had been cropping up on the boards. (quite a different story for the logos
    section of the critique board) and with the designs that had been popping up...
    not many had the wide appeal as Pill Gothic or Olduvai. From my experience with
    posting Kilkenny, Interloc and Village, it seems that there are a few dedicated
    critique fans and then a few other people who would comment based on their affinity
    to the particular typeface. i think that original designs are likely to get more
    comments as well, as they seem to be inherently more interesting."
