body: "I need to create a logo for a robotics group, the CyberKnights.\r\n\r\nI am
  thinking of having CYBER in one font, sort of like a more modern font, and having
  KNIGHTS right next to it in a more old looking font. (And no, I am not looking for
  a combination of Arial and Old English Text, otherwise I would be embarrassed to
  be on this forum.) Afterwards I was planning on making slight adjustments to the
  logo, such as turning the T into a sword or something generic like that.\r\n\r\nAlternatively,
  I could just put the whole logo in one font. \r\n\r\nNotes: I've tried slab serif
  (Vitesse, Sentinel, Soho...) but it's not really doing it for me. It creates more
  of a varsity sport look.\r\n\r\nAt the moment I lack inspiration, and I need either
  a perfect font or two different fonts that complement each other perfectly. Any
  ideas?\r\n\r\nAt this point even crazy stuff would work (something electrifying,
  etc., but not Jokerman obviously lol)\r\n\r\nEDIT: For clarification, I don't want
  to use anything calligraphic or anything reminiscent of old English / medieval text."
