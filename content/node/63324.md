  especially when it's type advertised on this forum. \r\n\r\nevery time i see tungsten
  (the current featured face) i'm tempted to get it...\r\n\r\nand i did actually get
  tribly black mostly because of the lil ad on here. \r\n\r\nso, people who sell type...
  i have no idea if you can measure sales from here, but you pull me in often.\r\n\r\n"

  body: I admit to using AdBlock on Firefox, but I have an exception set for Typophile
    and a few other sites. In Typophile's case, at least, the ads are informative
    to my interests and rarely annoying.

  body: "Just deactivated it for this page. Now there is a rather inconspicuous ad
    from H&FJ for Tungsten and a nervous gif from Fontbureau with contents hopping
    to and fro desperate to attract my attention. The former is ok but the latter
    gets definitively on my nerves.\r\n...\r\nNow after posting this comment the ads
    have disappeared. Is that some kind of reward for frequent posters? ;-)"
