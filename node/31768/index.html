  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Hello! 
For the body I want to choose a sans serif that is helvetica-like, only a bit more narrow. But not as narrow as Helvetica condensed, of course. I had Imago from BQ for a similar project, so I don’t want to use it again. It should also be a bit more contemporary and lighter (and softer) than Imago. The Magazin will not look crammed, there is a lot of white space and room for large photos. 
I am happy to hear your suggestions.
Your choices for a serif companion (interview-passages, quotations, editorial) are also welcome. 
best regard, anton</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Hello Stephen,</p>
<p>thank you for your answer. 
First I took a look at paralucent light condensed. What startled me first a bit was devicefonts’ website that can not conceal the companies interest in &ldquo;fun fonts&rdquo;. But p. really seems fine, i.e. serious. The &ldquo;g&rdquo; adds some personality. Plus a real italic is rare for this kind of fonts. Is the kerning really good? &ldquo;a&rdquo; and &ldquo;g&rdquo; nearly touch each other in the preview window, it might also be a screen problem, though. But: the dot on the i seems really big, that is for sure.</p>
<p>Trade Gothic is always a choice, but with this font I always think of pages full of text, and not of open and somewhat airy layouts. and maybe not &ldquo;european&rdquo; enough.</p>
<p>Bulldog, hmm &hellip; it is a bit to narrow, and its elegance is maybe not so appropriate for this job (science, hiTech). But I have been using it for another client for years.</p>
<p>Spiegel: Here in Austria Der Spiegel is read a lot and it would seem a bit odd, if people think &hellip; hm this magazin font reminds me of someting &hellip; I think this is the reason why no magazin I know uses this (very good) font.</p>
<p>Brown Light looks great in the FontShop Preview Window, and it is the font that I give some consideration. It also has the modernist (helvetica, imago-like) feeling, that I wanted. Does anyone have experiences with this font? It seems worth a try. 
Or: is there another Brown-like font that you know?</p>
<p>Qualifying Softer: Hmm. Maybe I was thinking of this squarish quality, that can be found in Paralucent. But this feeling only is conveyed in the more extended versions, I think. So maybe it was a bit contradictory.</p>
<p>thank you for your help so far.</p>
<p>PS: Good FontFeed at fontshop!</p>
