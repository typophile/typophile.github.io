    I ask you, since I am doing a font that also must be built up with thousands of
    points on each glyph \u2013 how did you do it? =)\r\n\r\nI recently posted this
    thread:\r\nhttp://typophile.com/node/19828\r\n\r\nFor me it seems impossible to
    make a user friendly font when the font has a lot of points. On the other hand
    I have seen fonts that carries over thousand points on each glyph, so I guess
    I must be doing something wrong?\r\n\r\nIs there some tips you could share, I
    would be very grateful. \r\n\r\nThanks, and once again - VERY cool typeface you

    Brazil Inspired (Die Gestalten Verlag) which features some of the best from this
    great country (but not all of them). Gilberto Gil is actually Brazil Minister
    of Culture (when he was elected, there was an article in the Guardian calling
    him the Minister of Cool...it's like Bob Marley (RIP) being elected Minister of
    Culture of Jamaica, or something equally...unusual for European standards...maybe
    not for the American though (see Arnold Schwarzenegger case etc.)

    you added, subtracted, collaged, overlaid ribbons etc, and photographed & cleaned
