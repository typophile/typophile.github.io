body: Both of the books in my bookshelf which were printed in the sixties &#40;1967
  and 1968, in the UK, to be exact&#41; are set in this face. I&#39;m pretty sure
  I&#39;ve seen it in other books from the library too, some PKD novels I think. <BR>
  <BR>I have linked to the scans instead of attaching them because they are quite
  wide &#40;1100 pixels or so&#41;. <BR> <BR><a href="http://users.on.net/~dancallaghan/sample1.png"

  body: I think those samples are Caledonia, by W. A. Dwiggins, which has been around
    since the late 30&#39;s, and is a very popular text font. <BR> <BR>Bitstream&#39;s
    <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/bitstream/transitional-511/" target="_blank">Transitional
    511</a> is their version of Caledonia.  <BR> <BR>There is also <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/new-caledonia/"
    target="_blank">New Caledonia</a>, which I suppose is a slightly modernized version
    that looks virtually identical.

  body: I hate disagree with you Mike, but I think this looks more like Baskerville
    to me. It&#39;s got some not-quite-Baskerville-ness to it &#40;like the closed
    bottom loop on the g&#41;, but I think it&#39;s a closer match than Caledonia.
    IMHO.

  body: It&#39;s OK for us to disagree Mark. Usually I learn something when that happens.
    One of the other not-quite-Baskerville-ness features that set me off in the other
    direction is the Q in Sample 1. I couldn&#39;t find ANY Baskervilles with a Q
    like that. It looks like some sort of Scotch &#40;Caledonia,  or Bruce Old Style
    -- but not Scotch Roman&#41;. I agree certain letters like the C and t look  more
    Baskervillian, so Caledonia isn&#39;t quite right, for sure. Bruce Old Style has
    the wrong C serifs, but has a better Q and J than any Baskerville I can find,
    and the t is closer than Caledonia&#39;s. <BR> <BR>So far, I don&#39;t feel very
    good about any of the suggestions. Do you have any other ideas? &#40;here are
    the samples below, so we can see them more easily&#41; <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/53508.gif"

  body: The &#39;s&#39; is also interesting.... no top serif sticking up, and the
    &#39;u&#39; seems to have flat top serifs, rather than angled. <BR>  <BR>I think
    it has the gestalt of Old Style No. 7/Bruce Old Style. I know very little about
    metal type, but presumably if there was an Old Style No. 7 there were at least
    six others that didn&#39;t make the leap to digital format. Perhaps this is one
    of those -- retains the overall qualities of Bruce Old Style, but differs in some
    details?

    think this has made it to digital. Interesting face, though. I thought there was
    something English-looking about it.'

  body: Well done Mark! I agree that looks like it. Mystery solved.  I appreciate
    you keeping me on my toes -- it&#39;s tempting to stop looking with the first
    thing that fits a few of the earmarks without looking at all the letters.  You&#39;re
    very thorough. I will try harder to emulate that.

  body: Yeah, that&#39;s a pretty obscure one. Never noticed it before. According
    to Jaspert,  <BR> <BR>&#34;A roman dating from c. 1790, perhaps from the Fry Foundry,
    but its early history is obscure. ... Linotype Georgian designed by G. W. Jones
    &#40;and Victorian&#41; are similar to the Stephenson Blake design, but there
    are a number of small differences....&#34; <BR> <BR>It doesn&#39;t say when any
    of the others were done and it appears this face was only in use in England. I&#39;ve
    never noticed it before this. It&#39;s not in any of my other books. Very interesting
    face.

  body: This turned out to be both an educational and expensive thread for me. John&#39;s
    post about &#39;An Atlas of Typeforms&#39; got me looking for a copy, which led
    to finding an old Intertype Catalog, which in turn led to finding a 1912 ATF Specimen
    Book &#40;I always wanted one of these&#41;. I bought all three,  a total of about
    2,000 pages of type books, for just under $200, which feels like a bargain.
