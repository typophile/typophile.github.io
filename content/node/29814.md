body: "Inferno Press is please to announce -- after two years' work -- the publication
  of <strong>Sem Hartz and the Making of Linotype Juliana</strong>. This is the first
  book dealing exclusively with the design and development of one of the most elegant
  -- and overlooked -- typefaces of the twentieth century.\r\n\r\nFrustrated by the
  dearth of information about Hartz in English, Inferno Press commissioned Mathieu
  Lommen, a curator at the Special Collections Department at the Amsterdam University
  Library and friend of Hartz, to write the story of the design of Linotype Juliana.
  Lommen's text has been laser-printed on archival paper using a newly digitized version
  of Juliana. In fact, <strong>this will be the inaugural appearance of this font</strong>.
  Photographic reproductions of Hartz's early drawings for Juliana are tipped in,
  and the cover is letterpress-printed on a Nepalese Lotka paper (various colours).
  8 1/4 by 5 inches. 15 pages. 100 copies. Stitched into soft covers. Price C$40.
  North American orders add C$5/copy. Elsewhere add $7/copy. Dealer discounts available.
  For more information, and an image of the cover, please visit Inferno Press's website
  at http://infernopress.blogspot.com.\r\n\r\nBooks may be ordered directly from the
  Press by email <mailto:inferno_press@...> or by calling 604 731 6365. We accept
  payment from PayPal <https://www.paypal.com/>accounts, international money orders
  or (in Canada) personal cheques. Cheques must be made out to Paul Razzell.\r\n\r\nOur
  address is\r\n\r\nINFERNO PRESS\r\n1857 West 4th Avenue, No. 227\r\nVancouver, B.C.,

  body: "The Juliana used in the book was digitized by David Berlow of the Font Bureau.
    Please contact the Font Bureau directly concerning their plans to release the
    font. I can tell you they have done a fine job, and I look forward to seeing it
    used by discriminating designers. In the meantime, you can see the font at work
    in the book: copies are still available. \r\n\r\nBest,\r\n\r\nPaul"

    we saw some photos of the new digital version used in text, and some peeks at
    the original drawings, it might be more enticing."

  body: "I'm glad to see this come out. I have a copy of the tasteful small book in
    Dutch about Hartz, as well as a copy of Hartz's obituary in Quaerendo (IIRC),
    and waiting for more has been a tantalizing!\r\n\r\nI'm curious about Berlow/FB
    doing it, in terms of the rights acquisition, something usually tricky when the
    Dutch are involved! :-)  Is there anything you -or possibly David- can share about
    the \"mechanics\" of what took place in that respect?\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
