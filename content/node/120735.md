body: "At first this typeface looks like American Typewriter Bold or Typewriter Serial
  Heavy, but the ball at the upper tip of the 3 is more pronounced. Someone probably
  just customized it but I would still like to know if anybody knows of any other
  fonts that have this kind of typewriter-meets-Cooper-Black sort of look? \r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/23-trace_6653.jpg]"

  body: "Can't find something like that.\r\nIt makes me think of American Typewriter
    + a bad quality raster-to-vector processing which made the upper tip of 3 pronounced
    and also destroyed all fine corners points.\r\n(it's a common kind of deformation
    if you do a raster-to-vector conversion on a low quality image)"

  body: Yes, I know it looks like American Typewriter. Even if it's a result of a
    bad raster-to-vector job, surely someone on Typophile must know about a similar
    typeface that has this look. It's not a matter of taste or opinion, it's simply
    a request for a similar typeface.

  body: Thank you for taking the time to respond, @fvilanakis  and @DPape. I've settled
    on AmericanTypewriterBQ and then I'll customize it.
