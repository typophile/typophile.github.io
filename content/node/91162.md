    is structured in a very monotonous way, making it hard to distinguish the individual
    characters and character-groups that make up words. Helvetica for body text is
    an absolute mis-use of it. Pick a humanistic sans if you need to go with a sans.
    Garamond has an absolutely different flavor than Helvetica, which tells me you
    do not know what tone the text should communicate. So for which tone do you want
    to go, what is the environment of the text?"

    wanted to start off by saying that.\r\n\r\n--\r\n\r\nYes, Helvetica is LOL for
    text. In fact for me the only way it\r\never works is very light and very large.
    And no, it's not the\r\ndefault sans for the web, because Windows (you know, 95%\r\nof
    systems out there) doesn't even have it. Arial fills in for\r\nHelvetica, and
    it's close (it's less un-texty) but anyway on-\r\nscreen things change so much
    compared to print that it's a\r\nmoot point.\r\n\r\nAll things being equal, assuming
    there's no stylistic clash the\r\none sans that I believe in (in terms of textiness)

    travel books, at least in the States.\r\n\r\nYes, I'm saying we don't use sans
    serif for text much in the U.S. I believe Europe is a different story. But unless
    you're aiming at a European audience, or the author is willing to put up with
    diminished sales so that you can show 'em, by God, you would most likely be better
    off with a serif typeface.\r\n\r\nHaving said that, we've used TheSans successfully
    in art books, usually semi-light, or regular if the setting size is small. Also
    Scala sans and Quadraat sans. \r\n\r\nWe do set one (sort of) academic journal
    in Helvetica, <cite>boundary 2</cite>.  A number of people have tried to get them

    Quadraat Sans has a better color and better modulation. These three faces also

    used to set them a bit tight by means of negative tracking and in the case of
    body copy you need them to set them normally and with more leading that if you
    were setting a serif face because the visual cohesion of the line is weaker due
    to the lack of serifs.\r\n\r\nAlso light sans faces are no good for long body

    old wives tale.  I was reading in "Just My Type" how people studying legibility
    based on what people could actually read (gasp, you mean not just a theory?!)
    found out it really had nothing to do with what was "more legible" based on the
    standard thinking: x height, large counters, etc...; but rather on what people
    were used to reading.  That is, what fonts were closest to the ones they see everywhere
    everyday.  I think that''s pretty valid.  Think about the blackletter fonts used
    by the Germans for so long.  It takes me a great deal of effort to decode those

    style of letter affect its high-\r\nspeed decipherment? Although I don't know
    the\r\nanswer to that, I can confidently believe that the\r\ninherent qualities
    of letterforms are not irrelevant,\r\nthat they contribute to how smoothly/quickly
    this\r\nfamiliarity can be gained; I'm also confident that a\r\ntypestyle can
    have inherent flaws that place upper\r\nlimits on how comfortably it can be read
    no matter\r\nhow much you're exposed to it.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    Understand, I'm not questioning you, just trying to understand you.

  body: According to what I remember from this book, as long as the text is fairly
    well set other things become more important for good readability like a writing
    style that aids the prediction of meaning and good contextualization.

    \ It sure looks like Univers 65 to me. Probably metal type set at the Westinghouse
    Printing Division in late 60s to 70s.\r\n"

  body: "Hrant, it may not  kind, but it is fair. The evaluation of performance of
    any product falls on a bell-shped curve. If it is a manufactured item, somebody
    gets the good ones where the numbers are close to the zero defects point. Others
    don't.\r\n\r\nTo put a point on it, if you ask the guy who bought the Yugo that
    falls at the extreme left of the curve, he'll tell you it's a great car.\r\n\r\nType,
    esp. type as software, doesn't have those manufacturing issues. But acceptance
    is also a bell-shaped curve -- in me, for example, you've found one of the few
    people who doesn't like Gotham. Doesn't make me either right or wrong, just far
    out on the curve.\r\n\r\nSo asking for \"best,\" even with an exhaustive survey,
    just gives you that curve. Buried in that math, of course, is evaluation. As Nick
    said, if you include a fair bit about \"best for what,\" you shorten up the curve.
    \ A general \"best\" is just a poor thing to ask for, anyone working beyond the
    level of a neophyte should know that.\r\n\r\nTo be kind would be to just ignore
    such posts, which I usually do, In this case, I feel strongly enough about the
    *general* unsuitability of a sans for bookwork in the U.S. to reply, with the
    stated exceptions of travel and art books -- or a specific case where it would
    be appropriate. Reason needed there, of course."
