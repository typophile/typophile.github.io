  body: "The only duplicated letter in the logo is the 'a', and it seems to be identical,
    so that makes it look like it's probably a font. More letters would be more conclusive,
    but it has an amateurish look about  it. Casual lettering like this could practically
    be done by anyone, and is so cheap and easy to have made into a font, that it
    could well be a custom font that we'll never find. The spurs on the 'q' and 'J'
    are what keeps this from being ordinary hand-printing.\r\n\r\nMy biggest problem
    in looking for this is deciding what category to search for it under. I looked
    at several categories of hand lettering at Dafont with no luck. I was guessing
    it wasn't a commercial font, but I just don't know.\r\n\r\nMaybe someone else
    has an idea?\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
