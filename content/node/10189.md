body: We are using InDesign on 4 computers on a network.  If Computer 1 opens the
  file it says the font for Arial OTF is missing... if Computer 2 opens it, it&#39;s
  fine... I have 2 computers that use the same Arial font and 2 that don&#39;t...
  I&#39;ve went to my font folder in WINNT and erased all the fonts and reinstalled
  the same fonts on all 4 computers but...still the same problem... HELP...

  body: Have you checked the preferences on all your InDesign copies? Maybe a preference
    was changed. Try trashing the preferences on all the computers, then restart InDesign.
    Its my first thought.

  body: Darlen, I have had this same problem with Meta. <BR>It appears differently
    in the text pulldown. When you open a document across diferent computers, we get
    the same errors. Maybe CS2 will solve this. <BR> <BR>Hildebrant.
