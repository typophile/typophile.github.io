body: Hi, does anyone know how they made psychedelic typefaces in the 60s? Was it
  all handwritten?  Why did they make it the way it was? Where did its origins come
  from? and how did they print the psychedelic art posters?

    done a comprehensive study of the genre, and some dedicated Googling would probably
    turn something up.\r\n\r\nThis old hippie's take is that the recognized masters
    of the art--such as Rick Griffin, Stan Mouse, Victor Moscoso and Wes Wilson--hand-lettered
    their posters, which were sometimes printed offset and sometimes silk-screened.
    At the tail end of the phase, commercial typesetters like Photo-Lettering Inc.
    got into the mix.\r\n\r\nAs far as origins go, I would opine that Push Pin Studios
    was probably a strong influence. Their brash revivals of Art Deco probably prompted
    a look at other style of the past, notably Art Nouveau, which heavily influenced
    psychedelic poster work."

  body: For the British take on it you need to look at the work of Michael English
    & Nigel Weymouth. There was a bit more of an influence from the current "establishment"
    art movements such as Op Art & the British strand of Pop Art from the likes of
    Peter Blake & Richard Hamilton.

    -- the psychedelic drugs.\r\nThese can cause a disruption of the sense of vision.\r\nOther
    than taking the drugs, the scene in Terry Gilliam's <em>Fear and Loathing in Las
    Vegas</em> where the carpet comes alive gives a good idea of the kind of swirling
    distortions that may occur, providing artists with inspiration to transpose such
    interesting images to straight reality.\r\n"

    style of a scene that had a mass appeal and so became widely marketed.

    Never Knows\".\r\n\r\nTape loops came from the classical avant garde (Terry Riley
    to be specific) far before The Beatles used it. 1950s.\r\n\r\nThat was an interesting
    time in music, with pop stars learning from experimental classical composers.
    Terry Riley's <cite>A Rainbow in Curved Air</cite> for example heavily influenced
    Pete Townshend's work on Who's Next.\r\n\r\npbc"

  body: "AFAIK, the specific effect Paul invented was new, whereby an input was re-recorded
    over itself, slightly out of sync, for a progressive, echoey degeneration. After
    a certain number of over-dubs, the effect became too muddy, and it became necessary
    to manually ease up the recording head.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure the Beatles' interest
    in sound effects can be traced directly to contemporary classical music -- they
    grew up listening to the Goon Show, with sound effects by the BBC Radiophonic
    Workshop, and George Martin had worked with the show's comedians. Prior to his
    involvement with the Beatles, he had produced all kinds of music at the dog's
    body Parlophone, including classical, novelty, and \"regional music\", and under
    the moniker Ray Cathode, even released an electronic dance tune, recorded at the
    Radiophonic Workshop. \r\n\r\nSo it's reasonable to assume that Martin turned
    the Beatles on to such experimentations and special effects, which came from a
    commercial recording studio milieu, rather than an avant garde classical source.

  body: "The Beatles were certainly aware of the avant garde. This is from the wikipedia
    article about <cite>Tomorrow Never Knows</cite>:\r\n\r\n>McCartney supplied a
    bag of \xBC inch audio tape loops he had made at home after listening to Stockhausen's
    Gesang der J\xFCnglinge. By disabling the erase head of a tape recorder and then
    spooling a continuous loop of tape through the machine while recording, the tape
    would constantly overdub itself, creating a saturation effect, a technique also
    used in musique concr\xE8te.\r\n\r\nThat Stockhausen piece was realized in 1955-56.
    Terry Riley had also created what he called a Time Lag Accumulator (2 reel to
    reels with tape loops) in the 50s which achieved the same thing as disabling the
    erase head.\r\n\r\nIt is also true that the BBC was using tape loops in the 1950s
    for sound effects so the phenomena was concurrent.\r\n\r\nWhatever the case -
    back then pop music was a very different animal, with the largest stars looking
    everywhere for information/inspiration. This was also true in early punk rock
    - as many musicians as came from the David Bowie/Iggy Pop school came from the
    avant garde (think Stockhausen, Mauricio Kagel, John Cage, Sun Ra, The Art Ensemble
    of Chicago).\r\n\r\nPeople that are serious about what they do tend to be aware
    of the history of their craft. Nick - you seem to be.\r\n\r\npbc"

    with creating the effect called Flanging, wherein a second tape of the material
    was delayed intermittently by applying thumb pressure to the flange of the tape
    reel, creating a swirling--otherwise known as \"The Big Hurt--effect.\r\n\r\nAnd,
    FWIW, something very much like the \"Time Lag Accumulator\" was marketed as the
    Echoplex in the 60s and 70s, as was used extensively on Led Zeppelin's first two
    albums."

    do one-off of posters and menus for food or weed.  The REAL stuff got washed away

    used on the psychedelic posters had a name yet in the 60s, and what they were
    called? Or if it got it's name after this. Like the Fillmore font and the Arnold
    Boecklin font? Or do you know which fonts they were inspired by?
