    to be \u201C$24.95,\u201D now I see \u201C25.\u201D Nice too see that designers
    have diners all figured out!"

  body: "Just looking over the original report.\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter a <em>very</em> brief
    review:\r\n\r\nFrom [[http://www.hotelschool.cornell.edu/research/chr/pubs/reports/submissions.html|the
    sumbision guidelines]] page on their site: \r\n\r\n<em>\"Submissions are read
    for general acceptability by the academic director of the Center for Hospitality
    Research and then sent in blind form to industry and academic reviewers.\"</em>\r\n\r\nNot
    sure if this makes it officially \"peer reviewed\" but at least it's more than
    self published. If we check out who's on the Advisory Board we see \"[[http://www.hotelschool.cornell.edu/research/chr/board/russell.html|Steve
    Russell]], Chief People Officer, Senior VP, Human Resources, McDonald\u2019s USA.\"
    \r\n\r\nIf we check out the Senior Partners, we see \"[[http://www.mcdonalds.com/usa.html|McDonald\u2019s
    USA]]\" is third on the list.\r\n\r\nThe second authour, [[http://www.hotelschool.cornell.edu/research/facultybios/faculty.html?id=43|Kimes]],
    who is most likely [[http://www.hotelschool.cornell.edu/students/phd/phddetails.html?id=sy229|Yang's]]
    supervisor, has an impressive background. Note that [[http://disneyworld.disney.go.com/|Walt
    Disney World Resorts]] was a previous client of hers. \r\n\r\nThe three different
    menus (numbers with a $, numbers without, and numbers written in words) differed
    slightly in their design. Each used a different colour elastic binding so that
    the server could tell which was which. A possible confound. Overall, this looks
    like a pretty tight study. Well written, and seemly good stats, but I'm not that
    good at math (yet). Judging by the graphic design of the publication, someone
    has obviously spend a lot of time on it and are attempting appealing to corporate
    culture as well as academia.\r\n \r\nThanks for the link Sii. Research is fun!"
