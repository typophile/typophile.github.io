  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Hi, everybody. It seems that Windows 8 not only updated Segoe UI. As you may guessed, Microsoft updated Times New Roman and Arial. But, to my surprise, Comic Sans MS also gets a big update! It now supports Italic and Swash...

Well, the Italic typeface actually just looks like an oblique one. But the Italic Swash part is just crazy...</div>

Second, as far as I know Comic Sans has a popular use. Do people who set their texts with Comic Sans use swashes? I doubt it. This feature will probably stay buried. I like Comic Sans as it is.

If I could have written this text in swashed Comic Sans I'd have been able to convey my feelings more effectively.</div>

Probably not yet, but they will quickly learn to misuse and possibly even use this feature; especially since it appears to be a separate font rather than an OT 'swsh' feature.

Good point. I just hope people leave behind the frivolous Comic Sans fashion before they notice the swash adjunct. But by that I'm just willing to forget that, precisely with this expansion, Microsoft is trying to trigger a <i>second wave</i>.</div>

Yeah, what I said... 

The day we see church bakes sale signs with alternates and swashes you can fly me out to Redmond so I can buy you a beer.
:o)

Of course, when that day comes it will be nothing but swashes and alternates.

... So my employer is about to upgrade our system to to Windows 7 ( :o/ yeah... ) I guess we miss out on this version until we get upgraded to Windows 8 in about - oh, 9 or 10 years.</div>

Can't wait! So, these new fonts have licensing allowing any user to host and link to them? And there are WOFF versions available from MS or do we convert them ourselves?

Sorry conversion to WOFF isn't currently allowed under the Windows EULA. On the plus side most of these fonts (or equivalents) should be available via our licensing arrangement with Ascender/Monotype, if not now, then in the near future (once enough browsers support OT). 

We posted demos by Font Bureau, Font Shop and Monotype that show both OT support coupled with @font-face delivery. Link here... http://blogs.msdn.com/b/ie/archive/2012/01/09/css-corner-using-the-whole-font.aspx </div>

Oh.

SD: ":-) as noted we updated all the "web fonts", making them more relevant and useful on the CSS OpenType enabled web."

(Except for the format and licensing.)

SD: "...We posted demos..." 

I know, and we are are happy to support OT features even if we(btype), need to write a per-feature line of CSS for each browser <em>and! </em> put a different font file on the stack to suit each browser/OS combination, <em>and! </em> put a different naming structure on font families to suit each browser, and &tc.

But, I'm imagining millions of windows users happily working along in the integrated world of windows and the web 'til finding a web publishing barrier with the dandy new features of the fonts they are accustomed to doing with whatever they like. 

So, and this is not the first time I've thought this even though it's not my problem — I'm concerned for the safety of Comic Sans.

I had similar worries about @font-face, but I've found that most web site publishers seem to be able to work out what they can and can't do with our fonts, and the hosting services have done a good job of helping guide site owners along the right path. 

The inclusion of OpenType  features in the web fonts will help web site designers understand what OpenType can bring to their content and inevitably they'll seek out providers like The Font Bureau to provide alternates above and beyond the web safe options.
