  body: "Seems pretty close to Pistilli Roman, although this 's' looks thinner. We've
    talked about this typeface before, and if there is a digital version, that may
    be what this is. The sample I am seeing is in the Phil's Photo 'Homage to the
    Alphabet' book, and is a film type.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

    Phil Martin's [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/urw/didoni/|Didoni]] being the closest
    digital version to Pistilli Roman. I think that might be your answer.\r\n\r\n-
