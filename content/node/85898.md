  Typography site]] with documentation on OpenType, ClearType and general information
  about typography and typeface design. I\u2019m also sure most of you know it\u2019s
  been around since 1996 and much of the content hasn\u2019t been updated in a quite
  a long time.\r\n \r\nAs the newest member of the Microsoft Typography team, I\u2019ve
  been tasked with giving the site a thorough review and with a view to making targeted
  updates. As part of this process, I wanted to get feedback from the community of
  users (you folk!) as to what needs to be updated, clarified or added. \r\n\r\nI
  might be opening a can of worms here, but feel free to contact me, either by leaving
  a comment or sending a direct message. We\u2019d love to hear from you!\r\n\r\nThanks
  everyone!\r\n"

    The process is still clinging to 1996: including the fax. (Yes!) Do you still
    listen to Dj Bobo over there? The documentation is scarce (when it\u2019s not
    overwhelming, as in Beat\u2019s raster disaster), and the few provided docs are
    saved in an ancient MS Word format not accessible to newer word processors, the
    links to sample files are dead etc. Truetype hinting is the elephant in the room
    right now and you guys could really get us somewhere if you\u2019d make it a little
    more accessible. How about a video tutorial section explaining the basics of the
    program?"

    </cite>\r\n\r\nWhy on earth should we independent type business stakeholders step
    in on demand and provide professional content input to sponsor MS\u2019s promotion
    activities? \r\nSorry, but I fail to follow you.\r\n\r\nIn my opinion it is not
    convincing policy if a player like MS does generously commission a handful of
    decent typefaces (though decent they are indeed) and eventually edit a range of
    technical specifications un-updated since more than 10 (!!) years, now stumbling
    in and asking for \u201Cadvice\u201D. \r\n\r\nWhat is typography for MS? A playground?\r\n\r\nIn
    the sphere you\u2019re acting in you should admitt that substantial (professional)
    consulting is not something to get for nothing. But maybe it\u2019s just me riding
    the wrong horse here\u2026\r\n\r\nI can\u2019t help smelling that this is yet
    another \u201Cplease-do-my-homework\u201D request of which quite a bunch is overcrowding
    this place for a while.\r\n\r\nHowever, personally I wish you success with your
    job, naturally.\r\nNo hard feelings, I hope.\r\n\r\nRegards, A. St."

  body: "No intend to dismiss the posts above, but:\r\n\r\nMay I offer my thanks back
    to the (original) Microsoft Typography team? I've read literally each and every
    page and Word document top to bottom, and it was all I needed to get a thorough
    grasp of the innards of Truetype and Opentype fonts. So much unlike Adobe's half-hearted
    stab at documentation.\r\n\r\nI think I would enjoy a good overview of currently
    supported OTF features in Uniscribe (admittedly, I haven't visited the pages lately
    so it might already be there). Cleartype has been talked about a couple of times
    in the Build forum, it might be about time to get an official stance on that as
    well."

  body: "First of all, congratulations again on your new job!\r\n\r\nAndreas, I don't
    think Aaron is asking us to contribute content; to me it seems wholly reasonable
    market research to find out what people like / don't like about the site before
    updating it.\r\n\r\nAaron, one thing I've been confused by is the structure of
    the site: the homepage doesn't seem to fully list all the subsections (Without
    a bookmark I'd be searching for ages for the character design standards \u2014
    as I wouldn't automatically think to look under 'articles') I'd also like to see
    the design standards cover characters in blocks, and be a bit more complete (though
    of course this needs to be realistic). It could even be a wiki. The structure
    at the moment has been enough to discourage me from exploring further than absolutely
    essential research.\r\n\r\nIf I were in your shoes I'd want to look at the site
    analytics to see which sections of the site are actually used, as I suspect a
    lot of it is redundant. I can't honestly see who the site is aimed at: it seems
    to target both people who need to know about cleartype hints and people who don't
    know how to install a font. Disaggregating the target visitors would be hugely
    beneficial."

  body: Sounds like a good idea.  Perhaps some of us had not been there in a while
    since there is not much new there anymore.  I think it would be great if you could
    go through and make everything current and consistent. That is not a small task,
    but a major computing company should be able to handle it with all the skills
    and technology it has at hand?

    goal of this thread is not to ask for a serious review of the site, but to help
    inform my work and give a more complete perspective on what needs to be updated.
