  body: "Identifont (http://www.identifont.com/find?font=Ole&q=Go) says its Ole by
    Henrik Kubel (A2-Type, 2006), but when I go to the Playtype website, that Ole
    is a serif face.\r\n\r\nPerhaps Identifont has the wrong name attached to the
    sample?\r\n\r\n"

  body: The Playtype webside is just not displaying the type correctly and is substituting
    what appears to be Times. If you look at the PDF specimen for Ole available on
    that same page it is the correct face.
