  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Hey, all. So I'm finding that, for my current project in InDesign, I'm always having to adjust the "Space After" paragraph property manually. I'm working with a baseline grid of 4pt, so I want most paragraphs to have that 4pt (0.0554 in.) space after. The problem is that I'm working with mostly material that I didn't generate (it's an editing job), and even text that I import has that space at 0.0556 inches. Because all my leadings are multiples of 8pt, the snap to baseline grid forces two 4pt spaces after paragraphs (I also have to change every instance of .00007 in to 0 in, for lists where I don't want spaces).

So I've found the Find/Replace feature useful for applying formatting such as text size, leading, and underline options with a broad brush, but for whatever reason, I can't get it to work for Space After. I set the "Find Format" box to the space after I don't want, the "Change Format" box to the space after I do want, and then when I click find, it tells me it can't find any instances.

Anybody tell me what I'm doing wrong?

Peace,
JT</div>

As for importing it unformatted, I'm not sure...I think InDesign applies defaults to it anyway, doesn't it? Anyway, I'd really prefer not to add double the work to the job if possible. Thanks for your suggestions, though. 

Anyone else have an experience like this?

Scripts are just little automation doodads built into InDesign to make life easier. My process is to import the text and reformat using my own paragraph styles - but that's just my way of doing it. I guess there are a dozen different ways of doing things</div>

That's why you should use the paragraph styles. 
Set them up once, and you will have none of these problems. You can even map the paragraph styles in the original document to your styles when you place the document. </div>

My original question was not, "How would someone do this?" but "Why does the Find Formatting feature have an option to search for space after if it cannot, in fact, do so? Or am I using it incorrectly?" Sorry if I confused anyone. –_–

Try that and see if it helps.

That way it picks up that particular paragraph style and changes that one value.</div>

No wonder you're pulling your hair out! Sounds like a real nightmare.

Welcome to the wonderful world of typesetting and layout! As I said before, which isn't much help to you, personally I would have imported the text without any pre-existing formatting and done my own from scratch. 

Regardless, and unfortunately, it sounds like you're going to have to do it manually.

Sometimes you have no other option than to kill all the formatting and start over with precise paragraph and character styles.  This appears to be one of those times.  I'm sorry that it's not the answer that you're looking for, but it <em>is</em> the only answer that's correct.

Here is why: the Find/Change format options are exact.  If you import text that is 6.295pt, InDesign will round that off in the <em>displays</em> to 6.3pt.  But when searching for it in Find/Change, ID still treats it as 6.295pt, so it won't be found.  Either find that discrepancy somehow and account for it in your search, or start over.  I wish you luck.</div>

^ Well, that tears it...no way I'd be able to determine what it means by .0597 in (the default, despite my earlier typo) in the display box.

Yeah, I guess it'd have been better if I'd just started clean...next time...
