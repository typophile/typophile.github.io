  with figures not aligning in tables with one weight typeset next to the other.\r\n\r\nTo
  illustrate this better, I have attached a sample file as an example.\r\n\r\nMy fonts
  have slightly taller cap, lower case and ascender and descender alignments.\r\n\r\nIn
  FontLab these parameter settings are automatically calculated and used to generate
  the OTFs.\r\n\r\nIs there a parameter setting in FontLab that I need to adjust manually
  in order to correct this issue of alignments with tables?\r\n\r\nAny help would
  be much appreciated. Thank you."

    you have a fixed leading set or are you using autoleading? \r\nOr perhaps fixed
    leading on one side and autoleading on the other? \r\nOr maybe the side with the
    bold has plus leading added?"

  body: "@majus\r\n\r\nThank you for your feedback.\r\n\r\nActually, the fonts being
    discussed have been released for a while now.\r\n\r\nI received an email this
    morning from a customer who is using my fonts in LibreOffice application (similar
    to Word) on a Mac. I never heard of it.\r\n\r\nI asked customer to email me back
    a export text.rtf file to reimport into my InDesign file for testing.\r\n\r\nI
    got a similar thing happen when I selected my regular and bold weights (side-by-side).\r\n\r\nAs
    per file attachment above.\r\n\r\nSo, I decided to get to the bottom of it.\r\n\r\nI
    copied and pasted all glyphs into a new FontLab window and left the default setting
    created by FontLab. I did this for the new Bold weight of my font as well.\r\n\r\nWell,
    to my surprise, the fonts in the tables now work fine? Alignment on both sides
    is good.\r\n\r\nI am now trying to make another set of fonts, updating the parameters
    in FontLab (as recommended in FontLab) for the 'WinAscent' and WinDescent' to
    see what happens.\r\n\r\nIf the alignments jump again, then these parameter values
    are important and are key in making this all work correctly.\r\n\r\nI'll let you
    know what happens after I perform this last test. I suspect that the alignments
    will be off after I update (auto) parameters in FontLab based on my internal glyph
    alignments heights, etc. We will see...\r\n\r\nI just never tested for this sort
    of thing, but now, I need to get a handle on this whole problem and resolve for
    future font update and releases.\r\n\r\nI'm surprised no one else has chimed in
    with a similar occurrence when testing their fonts. Stay tuned...\r\n\r\nThanks
    again."

  body: "Alex,\r\nLibreOffice and NeoOffice are both variations based on the OpenOffice
    suite, an OpenSource version of the MS Office suite. I have tried all three at
    various times, and the results were mixed. On a Mac, I would not use them on a
    day-to-day basis -- but that's just me.\r\n\r\nLibreOffice probably is contributing
    greatly to your customer's problem, but even so it needs to be fixed -- something
    I would have to have all the files to figure out. So at this point: good luck!\r\n\r\nGeorge"

  body: "FAYI, \r\nOkay, I was able to finally resolve the problem.\r\nAs suspected,
    when I updated the font parameters (auto button) in FontLab for:\r\nMetric and
    Dimension>Key Dimensions and TrueType-specific metrics\r\nI got the same mis-alignment
    issues with tables in InDesign.\r\n\r\nSooooo, I painstakingly went parameter
    by parameter until I found the culprit.\r\n\r\nAnd, it's the [OS/2] TypoAscender
    and the [hhea] Ascender causing all the issues.\r\n\r\nI took the largest 'auto
    button' parameter in my entire font family of weights and styles.\r\n\r\nI think
    you need to use the largest values here because I did not want 'tops' of glyphs
    to start clipping in some apps.\r\n\r\nAnyway, and used the same 'values' throughout.\r\n\r\nEverything
    aligns perfectly now.\r\n\r\nThank you, George.\r\n\r\n@George Thomas... drop
    me a personal email akaczun@verizon.net\r\nI would like to discuss other stuff
    on a personal note."

    this earlier, would have saved myself much testing.\r\n\r\nBut, at least I have
    conformation that this, indeed, is the correct way to proceed going forward.\r\n\r\nNow,
    to re-master all my font families... Oh, boy!\r\n\r\nI wish this would have been
    documented somewhere beforehand.\r\n\r\nBut, I'm happy to final understand how
    all this works.\r\n\r\nMuch appreciated.\r\n"
