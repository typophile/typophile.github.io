  (5 k)</TD></TR></TABLE></CENTER><!-/Attachment-!> <BR> <BR>I have been following
  the critiques for sometime and I have learned a lot from them. This is a design
  that I did for an independent study in school. I have really tried to finesse the
  forms to make them as ledgeable as possible given the quirkiness of the crooked
  stem. I&#39;m not sure if it fits within this category of type or the sans serif.
  I decided its more of a serif face than a sans. Anyways, I just wanted see what
  the typophiles thought. Weather good or bad I can handle it.'

    I did. I&#39;m still trying to perfect kearning pairs and letter spacing in fontographer
    so some spaces might real bad. In some cases it&#39;s unavoidable because of the
    nature of this design. This is still with the tilted crossbar on the E,F and f.
    Great advice though, keep it coming.  <BR>pairth'

  body: ' Pablo, your text setting confirms a suspicion I originally had: your curved
    stems do work, but occasionally they come together to form distracting patterns.
    You wouldn&#39;t want to abandon them for that reason &#40;especially since this
    is no book face&#41;, but if you have the energy consider doing what Excoffon
    did &#40;in his Mistral, and elsewhere&#41;: account for the realities of linguistics,
    like what letter patterns &#40;pairs and triplets, at least&#41; are common, and
    hence need special attention, in terms of causing you to tilt a given stem one
    way or the other. <BR> <BR>I can see that you have two lc &#34;els&#34;, and you&#39;re
    choosing different ones in your text - that&#39;s great! But since a normal font
    can only have one, which one you choose should depend most on linguistics. And
    you should ideally do this for all the letters. <BR> <BR>BTW, if you have even
    more energy, make an OpenType font that automatically chooses the version of the
    letter that looks best in the context of what&#39;s close to it...  :-&#62; <BR>
    <BR>---- <BR> <BR>In fact, I think I just had a revelation: <BR>The more a font
    uses irregularity &#40;whether it&#39;s an  imbalance in color, or elements that
    don&#39;t align - like the stems in Leonor&#41;, the more it has to consider real
    language in managing the proper placement of its irregularities. The more regular
    a font is, the easier it is to avoid linguistics without affecting the results
    - but I would argue that regularity &#40;at least in the sense of formal aesthetics&#41;
    is essentially counter to readability &#40;and legibility too&#41;. <BR> <BR>hhp '

  body: ' Hrant <BR>It&#39;s very cool to see that you&#39;re interested in linguistics.
    I too have studied a little linguistics in school. Mostly just reading on my own.
    I didn&#39;t know about Excoffon and his use of linguistics in his typedesigns.
    How much time, would I need to do that? And energy? <BR>I think your on to something
    with your theory. In fact I wrote a note the other day in which I dubbed your
    theory the Theory of Regularity &#40;my computer froze when I submitted it&#41;.
    I think it has a nice ring to it like an important theory that&#39;s sweeping
    the design and scientific community. First the Ivy Leagues then the art schools.
    Then when you&#39;re old Hollywood will make  a movie about you.  <BR> <BR>Of
    course, legibility depends on other factors &#40;context, repeated usage, etc&#41;
    but I think the regularity theory might contribute to a certain degree in the
    legibility of a font. The thing I find interesting about your theory is that it
    seems counterintuitive to all that I&#39;ve been taught about good typedesign.
    That&#39;s a good thing because maybe it creates a basis for challenging the standard
    notions of readable fonts. Maybe designers should consider language as a way to
    create interesting letter combinations that read well but when seen on their own
    are a little desparate. Then when set in text it uses your theory &#40;which you
    will publish on Typophile.com&#41; to create a highly legible font. <BR>I know
    it&#39;s late. <BR>Pablo '

    I don&#39;t know - it depends on what kind of person you are. <BR> <BR>Time: Basic
    linguistic awareness doesn&#39;t drain much time, it&#39;s mostly just an &#34;attitude&#34;.
    You might spend maybe 20% more time than you would without it, but your results
    will be much better. It includes small things like using certain test texts for
    setting your font, but also subtle changes to a letterform based on what other
    letters it might be next to, etc. But if you want to go to high level &#40;like
    write special software to show you what&#39;s &#42;really&#42; going on in language&#41;,

    <BR> <BR>I don&#39;t think the &#34;Theory of Regularity&#34; :-&#41; is very
    important - I think it might serve mostly to make designers aware that letterforms

    I do seems disruptive to the status quo. :-/  You know, so many people declare
    that it&#39;s good to &#34;think outside the box&#34;, but usually it&#39;s just
    to serve their ends - they dislike change just like most other people. There&#39;s
    so many wrong things in typography, but I don&#39;t mind that - what I mind is
    people denying it - it kills the soul - it results in people wasting too much
    time trying to satisfy The Customer, at the expense of culture. <BR> <BR>&#62;
    Maybe designers should consider language as a way to create interesting letter
    combinations that read well but when seen on their own are a little desparate.
    <BR> <BR>Good thought! It&#39;s pretty simple, really: people read words, so we
    need to design not letters, but words! Duh. <BR> <BR>hhp '

    <BR> <BR>&#62; all his linguistical adjustments for French &#40;or whatever language&#41;
    didn&#39;t help when people started using Mistral in other languages. <BR> <BR>Well,
    considering that French and English as well as the other &#34;big&#34; languages
    that use the Latin alphabet are all Indo-European, I think there&#39;s enough
    overlap that any linguistic awareness particular to one language will generally
    have some positive effect overall in another language. But I totally agree that
    it&#39;s best to optimize. Maybe have the basic font with its spacing constant,
    but have kerning files &#40;which can be external, at least in the PostScript
    format&#41; for different languages, and let the user choose. <BR> <BR>Also note
    that OpenType can do this sort of thing very elegantly. <BR> <BR>&#62; Are we
    supposed to begin designing typefaces with words in mind before anything else?
    <BR> <BR>I don&#39;t know - it really depends a lot on what personally turns you
    on. But it remains true that -during immersive reading- we decipher words most
    of the time, and resort to recognizing/compiling individual letters mainly when
    we encounter an unfamiliar word &#40;which is rare&#41;. <BR> <BR>hhp
