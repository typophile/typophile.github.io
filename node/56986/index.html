  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">So I'm currently looking to create a personal mark for placement on resume, website and possibly a business card. As much as I need this, I'm also looking to make this a good learning experience so please feel free to be blunt and honest. 

I've decided to show a variety of samples just to see if anyone sees any potential in a particular direction. The focus thus far is on my name and my initials 'KM' as I don't particularly want to brand myself as a company, just as an individual. (Is there a danger in doing something as common as your initials?)

Any and all feedback and comments are appreciated. Thank you in advance.

@dave, yeah you're probably right but I don't imagine that I'd use that symbol much smaller than it is in that image. As for the type, none of that is finalized, I just wanted to show placement.

@graphicurious, I will definitely try that. I just want to make sure it works in 1 colour first.</div>

"F" is a great option, and I like the first one you posted in this thread, you've turned it from a scripty "m" into a spiral. A spiral can mean a lot for design. "motion" "moving" "progress" "progress bar" "controlled creativity", etc.</div>

F is gorgeous. I guess I don't see too many anagrams that are just one letter. I think its rather useful to have a mark recognizable from another orientation. I also get the read that these are waves--the creative flow.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">@melo: Very nice. FWIW the mark has grown on me. It is simplistic, beautiful and it is memorable. A couple of things though that stick out in my opinion. One, the angle of mark doesn't match the angle of the italics. Two, second line is overpowering the top one. I think smaller type in the second line might work quite a bit better. I'd also consider setting both lines in italic or dropping the italics altogether.

@bemerx25: [[http://www.hyperic.com/images/customers/mosso-logo.png|This one]] ? Even if they were not deprecating its use, it is pretty far from Kevin's version. As in "impossible to mistake one for another". Three vertical strokes at a slight angle is a very generic pattern, so it all comes down to the styling and decoration. And these are different between these two logos.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I was thinking the same thing. Why not just add a K with the same styling? I already had the idea in my head before even getting to mk2's comment. I know it isn't exactly like your strokes, but I was just concepting... try something like this:

		<div class="commentbody">Ouch, that sucks. I liked F as well. I also like B though. I think you should design a mark in the style of B and place the mark either above or to the left of the name. Maybe a typographical mark that knocks out of a distinctive shape in a creative way? Is that vague enough for ya?</div>
