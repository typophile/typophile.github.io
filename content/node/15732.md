body: Hi. I'm looking for information and recommmendations on where to source a budget-friendly
  yet useful collection of fonts for students of a 3rd level course in graphic design.
  The collection would need to familiarise the students with all the important typefaces,
  historically and aesthetically. The budget is 2,500 euro or thereabouts. Any clues?

    Type Classics for Learning</a> ($99!) is the best overall value for a starter

    <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/info/bitstream-type-odyssey-2/?refby=typographica\">Type
    Oddyssey</a> (1,450 fonts for $1495) or the <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/info/linotype-font-cds/#LinotypeEssentialsCDs?refby=typographica\">Linotype
    Essential CDs</a>. Make sure you ask about an educational discount.\r\n\r\nFinally,
    top it with the best of contemporary typefaces with any of the <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/products/libraries.cfm#fontfont\">FontFont
    CDs</a>. They offer a 30% educational discount."

    from the internet which they then go on to either stretch or condense to their
    heart's desire.\r\n\r\nEarly days:-)"
