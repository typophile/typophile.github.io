  am having some issues with some math equations. In their Word document they used
  Cambria Math to do their math equations. I have my body copy set in Adobe Garamond
  Pro. The math equations are not showing up. \r\n\r\nIs there anything out of the
  Adobe Library 11 that will map the same as Cambria Math. I don't have Cambria Math
  on my computer to substitute what I am currently using. \r\n\r\nThanks for the help. "

  body: "The fonts that \"map the same as Cambria Math\" are the unicode math fonts.
    There are very few available if I rely on the readme file of the experimental
    <a href=\"http://github.com/wspr/unicode-math\"><strong>unicode-math XeTeX package</strong></a>.
    There are Cambria Math, Asana Math, Neo Euler and a non yet available STIX font.\r\n\r\nI
    just tried that unicode-math package on a my Mac on which VMware Fusion is installed
    and also Microsoft Office 2007 with Cambria Math (under Windows XP Professional).
    Here is what I get (I formatted the equations with standard TeX commands).\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/unicode-math_6013.jpg]\r\nHere
    are the same equations with the Fourier package that I use almost daily  with
    pdftex (Fourier is a Type 1 font)\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/fourier_3907.jpg]\r\nThat
    tells you how the fonts look (with XeTeX for the unicode fonts and pdftex for
    Fourier).\r\n\r\nNow it is unclear how to get the equations out of Word 2007.
    Those equations can't even be read by Word 2008 on OS X. I tried some software
    that purportedly translates them to LaTeX, but without much success. Does anyone
    know if there is a reliable tool to take equations from a Word 2007 document and
    process them with some other software?\r\n\r\nMichel\r\n"
