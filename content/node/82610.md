  guy, call Prelo Slab.\r\nHe will be the highlight, the head, the headline in my
  brochure print work, for local property developer. I try to find him a suitable,
  easy on the eye partner, for the body part of the design, anything head down. \r\n\r\nI'm
  not certain it's a right choice to start with, but the developer's projects are
  very grey, glass, concrete, minimalist like designs, which I find very suitable
  for Prelo use. \r\n\r\nWould you be kind to please make some recommendations, which
  other typeface I could marry with it, one that also looks fine in small print ?
  \r\n\r\nYour time and expertise greatly appreciated. \r\n\r\nBest regards\r\n\r\nSebastian\r\n"
