    Schoolbook?\r\n\r\nFYI: Three weights of Century Old Style are bundled with Adobe
    CS2.\r\nLatin Modern Roman from <a href=\"http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/fonts/lm/\">CTAN</a>\r\n
    \ is not the most beautiful font in the world. But it is free and is in the same

    which is an updated version of Phil Martin's revision of Century Schoolbook?\r\n\r\nYou
    can get Grad Regular, Italic, and Bold for $29 each or all three for $59 at\r\n\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/marksimonson/grad/\r\n\r\nRahim\r\n"

  body: "See Typophile's [[http://typophile.com/node/18207|\"Good Libre Fonts\"]]
    page. Century Schoolbook L is one of the freely available URW fonts.\r\n\r\nst\r\n\r\nP.S.
    I see that the information on the wiki page doesn't include a great way to get
    these fonts, except by finding a friend with Linux.  You could let me know if
    you are interested and don't have Linux experience."
