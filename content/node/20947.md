body: "Hi typophiles,\r\n\r\ndue to working on a pitch for a consumer brand in the
  broad field of media, I am attempting to create a characteristic and legible wordmark.
  Based on the letter forms of an old logo of mine I am tweaking on new letters for
  the new wordmark.\r\n\r\nThe project is confidental, so unfortunately I can only
  show the second part of the wordmark, a sort of \"ad-on\" to the main-brand: \"Media\".
  )\r\n\r\nIn the (selfish ;) prospect of someday completing a typeface I'm considering
  the new letters to match somehow with the old logo letters...\r\n\r\nThanks in advance
  for your advice!\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/typo_sero_5056.jpg]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/typo_media_4479.jpg]"

  body: "It seems reasonable in a way but I don't love the M. All the other letters
    share characteristics but your M is kind of a one-off. It doesn't share the mind-set
    of the other letters - just the line thickness.  It has weight distribution problems
    too but since I don't think you should keep the form I won't get into that. I
    would also consider (maybe) adding a tail/s to the 'i'.  You can see them on Trebuchet
    ( one tail on top) , monoco ( two ) , or platelet (one on the bottom). If time
    is an issue you could ask a typophile to make you an M & maybe an \"i\" too. If
    not, keep posting ideas & we will critique them.\r\n\r\n"

    body: "Thanks Eben,\r\nalready applying your suggestions\u2026 \r\nI'm not so
      sure about the tail of the \"i\",  but I didn't feel too comfortable with the
      \"M\" either. It's really far away from the previous shapes.\r\nStill tweaking
      the \"M\", it still looks a bit forced and lacks some elegance.\r\nYour thoughts
      are appreciated.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/typophile_media2_4090.jpg]"

    inspiration\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/itfmecanorma/eurostile/extended/\r\n\r\nI
    would also look for more differentiation of the e and a. If the final mark involves
    an s I would amend the line modularity to take it away from the vertical and add
    it to the diagonal.\r\nTim"

    be, perhaps, a hair wider. The _i_ seems to be tilting backward also. \r\n\r\n"

  body: "Getting better. Here is what I would try now:\r\n\r\nM: look at the bends
    at the top & examine how there are handeled in the e next to it. Do you see how
    the bends are thicker/stronger? I suggest you emulate that. Look at the middle
    of the where the two sides join. The two parts comming down need to be stronger
    too. BUT you also need to consider the dip. After you have made the two middle
    parts stronger you may need to make thge cut slightly deeper. Let your eye guide
    your decision. I agree with Tiff that the bowing feet of the M also need to be
    addressed. I see at least 3 ways to potentially handle it. One way would be to
    make the come straight down. Try that 1st. It's easiest. You also might c onsider
    making the middle foot shorter to echo shorter upper & lower arms of the e & a.
    You might also consider taking the tail of the i you have, reversing it left to
    right & using it on the left foot of the m. I think TIFF is also correct about
    the width. It could be a bit wider too.\r\n\r\ni: You can try several things with
    this too. You could let the I come straight down. You could also modify the tail
    so that the shape isn't a litteral echo of the other letter shapes. You could
    flatter the curve a bit or just make it shorter or both. You could experiment
    with cutting it vertically vs. on a digonal. Other ideas are possible too. Do
    you see the illusion Tiff is talking about? You need to see it to correct for
    it. \r\n\r\nCheers!"

    body: "Thanks for your advice!\r\nAfter having a worthwile look at eurostile and
      your suggestions I tried harder on the \"m\".\r\nUnfortunately due to another
      project my time on this logo was dramatically cut so I have very little time
      to finish this logo pitch, namely next monday.\r\nIn the long run, introducing
      more diagonal shapes is a valid point and seems quite necessary.\r\nFirst variation
      of the \"m\" has straight feet, while I tried to apply some subtle bow on the
      others.\r\nStill tweaking on some curves...\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/typophile_media3_5172.jpg]"

  body: 'Looking at the r in sero I don''t think that the down stroke on the d should
    extend or the the beginning stroke on the m extend so high either. The last one
    seems to fit with the ''sero'' the best. And it seems to be nearly there. Since
    it is just a pitch not final art you are probably at a good enough sort of stopping
    point. Good luck with the pitch. Did you ever try a shorter middle leg on the
    m?  '
