body: I've previously published a book typeset in Palatino.  Examples in the book
  were presented as an italic in greyed boxes.  I'm considering revising the book
  for a second edition, and among other changes I am using the more readable (and
  to me, visually interesting) Aldus.  I'd also like to ditch the italic in favor
  of a sans serif, but am unsure what pairs well with this typeface.  Any recommendations?  (Likewise,
  any reservations against mixing sans serif and serif in this fashion?)

  body: "Actually, while I'm on the subject...\r\n\r\nPart of the reason I'm switching
    to Aldus is because, originally, I had artificially altered the width of Palatino
    due to its rather wide stature.  I have since seen the error of my ways and thought
    Aldus was a better way to go about it.  However, I have a vast preference for
    Palatino's more script-esque punctuation.  Aldus's commas and exclamations seem
    blandly round by comparison.\r\n\r\nWith the advent of the new Palatino Nova,
    has a face more suitable for extended book text been created?  Conversely, how
    egregious would it be to simply slip Palatino's punctuations into Aldus?  Or,
    just to simplify matters, is it so bad to simply set Palatino's width to 92.5%
    as I had before?"

  body: "Regarding [[squooshing]]: You should do what looks good to you, but usually,
    compressing or expanding type by more than a few percentage points is dangerous
    as it messes with the delicate proportions of the verticals and horizontals and
    the thicks and thins. For example, my newspaper compresses its headline type by
    90%, which I cringe at every time I see it. So I'd suggest Aldus over compressed
    Palatino.\r\n\r\nRegarding Palatino Nova: There's also an <a href=http://www.linotype.com/109957/aldusnova-family.html>Aldus
    Nova</a>. I haven't had a chance to use Palatino/Aldus Nova, but I've heard good
    things. I've read that Zapf designed them to work with digital typography, as
    opposed to metal.\r\n\r\nRegarding sans-serif pair: Rather obvious, but have you
    looked at <a href=http://www.linotype.com/111707/palatinosans-family.html>Palatino
    Sans</a> and <a href=http://www.linotype.com/113189/palatinosansinformal-family.html>Sans
    Informal</a>?"

  body: Yes, I have, but I've only seen them available as rather expensive "packs"
    and was hoping for a suggestion already part of my collection.  *laughs*  But
    perhaps I should just bite the bullet.  Thanks for all the help!

    high-end collection fonts available in much less expensive four-weight packs,
    so it might be less expensive than you think. '
