body: "The hole in this b\u2019logue and my truancy from TypeCon since 2009 has clearly
  left me with some \u2019splaining to do. I went back to school; this after years
  of considering myself done with it. There to welcome me back to the design program
  we had begun together was the graduating class of seniors. With a flush schedule
  and an abbreviated program I finished up a year behind them. Friends pictured below
  interspersed: <a href=\"http://www.reganfredjohnson.com/\">Regan Johnson</a>, <a

  Altamira</a>, <a href=\"http://colinpinegar.com/\">Colin Pinegar</a>, & <a href=\"http://r-emerson.blogspot.com/\">Rory
  Bruggeman</a>.\r\n<a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/education\">[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Class_photo_5240.jpg]</a>\r\n[[http://www.fontshop.com/education|Above:

  away to school again I took the opportunity to change my life around some. I had
  had it with doing good work. Great work was the stuff I now hoped to busy myself
  with and getting to it came with a sense of urgency. I pursued the hard stuff; stuff
  I found particularly challenging, like writing well about art & the humanities,
  making sophisticated use of color, designing in themes or material with which I
  had no experience. With individual projects I stuck to the rules:\r\n<blockquote>Let
  it be something you haven't tried before<br>\r\nabout which you care<br>\r\n& let
  it be fun\r\n</blockquote>\r\nThe highest highlight was making lots of new friends
  and reconnecting with plenty old ones. It was great to see <a href=\"http://jedart.blogspot.com\">Jed
  Henry</a> again. He's now moved on from animation and become a children's author
  & illustrator. Designer <a href=\"http://www.designbymann.com/\">Chris Mann</a>
  is consistently good. In his work each piece takes full ownership of the elements
  from whence it is made. Additionally, it was my pleasure to study letterpress printing
  and typography under fine printer & private publisher <a href=\"http://trystpress.com\">Rob
  Buchert</a>. Rob asks his students to keep a photographic journal of surprise letterforms
  they encounter.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Letter_6148.jpg]\r\n[[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F|Above:
  F.]]\r\n\r\nA particularly fun project required showing up to class with a pair
  of scissors; We were not told why. The student was to take one large press-sheet
  per letter in his name, and go to&#8202;\u2014&#8202;cutting out the letters. \u2018Don\u2019t
  draw on it, just cut.\u2019\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/David-name-drop-000_4723.jpg]\r\nThis
  served as a base exercise for the text face I'm presently working on during my short
  apprenticeship with Mark van Bronkhorst. <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/nondescriptes/5980508155/\">More
  on this soon</a>.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/David-name-drop-001_5325.jpg]\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/card-back_4561.jpg]\r\nAnd
  if you can, why not print a card in seven spot inks?\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/card-front_4856.jpg]\r\nAbove:
  Four-bar correspondence cards. The seventh spot ink, rubber-base black, turned out
  to be a bad idea; That's why you don't see it here.\r\n\r\n<blockquote>No matter
  how good the school is, his education is in his own hands. All education must be
  self-education. Let him realize the truth of this, and no school will be a danger
  to him. &nbsp;<a href=\"http://books.google.com/books?id=o_9IRsRNiPcC&q=%22All+education+must+be+self-education%22#v=snippet&q=%22All%20education%20must%20be%20self-education%22&f=false\">Robert
  Henri</a>.</blockquote>[img:sites/default/files/old-images/diploma_3542.jpg]\r\n\r\nI'm
  now working a short apprenticeship in type design & production with <a href=\"http://www.mvbfonts.com/browse/sans\">Mark
  van Bronkhorst</a>, to whom I respect no small lot, and upon whom I dryly put the
  title \u2018master,\u2019 for effect."
