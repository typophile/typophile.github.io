  body: Got mine in the mail -- it looks great so far! I expected it to be merely
    design, but a lot of it is retrospective essays and so on.

  body: I had to re-open this thread. Just had to!! <BR> <BR>If ever there was a book
    to purchase for someone in dire need of visual stimulation, it is this book. Did
    you realize that you were buying a visually historical journey that would feel
    like a fall down the rabbit hole? Did you realize that you were buying a signed
    and numbered book to treasure and keep near to you for constant gratification?
    Okay. Maybe I&#39;m a House junkie, but still it is seriously off-the-friggin-chain!!
