body: "Dear Typophile members.\r\nI'm compiling some letters (drawn by someone else)
  into a font. The letters are meant to be used in icon bitmaps sized 24 x 24 pixels
  and the characters were drawn to match this grid. However the result should not
  be a pure black/white pixel font but should show some gray tones as well. Please
  see attached image (desired look).\r\nI made the font in TypeTool. The trouble is,
  I can't produce the right look in Photoshop when using the font. I use 8 pt size.\r\nThe
  UPM is 1024 and each pixel is 128 units (8 x 128 = 1024). Also every letter spacing
  is 128 units.\r\n\r\nClearly I'm doing something wrong. Does anyone know how to
  do this right?\r\n\r\nMany thanks!\r\n\r\nM\xE5rten\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/desired-look_5810.png]"

  body: "Hi oldnick, thanks for helping me with this!\r\n\r\nThe glyphs were drawn
    in XaraX, so they are scaled perfectly and that's why it works. In the XaraX example,
    no font is used, it's just the glyphs drawn directly.\r\n\r\nThe two other images
    are from Photoshop, using the font that I created. First without anti-aliasing
    and then with anti-aliasing set to \"sharp\". The trouble now is to align the
    vector font with the screen pixels to get the same result that I got from XaraX.\r\n\r\nDoes
    it make sense?\r\nThanks."

  body: "As Jason pointed out, ALL measurements must equal whole pixel values for
    the font to work.\r\nTherefore, the Ascender AND Cap heights MUST equal 896 and
    the Descender MUST equal 128. The Left Sidebearing should be zero, and the Right
    sidebearing 128.\r\n\r\nBTW, if you scale everything 200% and generate a TTF-flavor
    font, your measurements would be ideal (2,048 UPM) for the format. "

  body: "Thanks guys.\r\nI've gone through the Font Metrics and this is how it's set
    now:\r\nAscender 896, Cap height 896, Descender -128, left sidebearing 0, right
    sidebearing 128. I moved some anchor points that were off the grid by 1 unit.
    I also tried to change the UPM to 2048, but that didn't seem to change anything.
    \r\n\r\nI've used auto-hinting on \"A\" and \"B\" in this example. Should I?\r\n\r\nI
    think it looks a little better, at least the scaling is right, but some gray is
    still leaking to the neighboring pixels.\r\n\r\nAny ideas what could still be
    wrong?\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Pixels_6548.png]"
