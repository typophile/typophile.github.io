  in norway. Ir will be used for signage, letters, exhibitions, publications etc.,
  must work in all sizes, and feature small caps, osf and the usual \"expert\" stuff.
  I want it to be modern, legible, and with a tiny \"twist\" to it. With \"twist\",
  i mean Oversized ink traps, signature letters, characteristic italics etc. I've
  only found one so far (after thinking for one hour), is etelka by storm type foundry
  http://www.stormtype.com/typefaces-fonts-shop/families-15-etelka\r\n\r\nideas, anyone?
  should condensed versions be a criterium?\r\n\r\nthanks!\r\n\r\nalex"

    organization? Etelka seems a bit too 'trendy' for some institutions, which to
    me would call for something more classic.

    other fonts you've looked at to pinpoint exactly what you are looking for.\r\n\r\nMaybe
    you could draw some influences from the famous jewish architect: Daniel Liebeskind.\r\nHe
    has done an amazing jewish building in Berlin for the Holocaust victims which
    is definetly contemporary: \r\nhttp://www.daniel-libeskind.com/projects/show-all/jewish-museum-berlin/\r\n\r\nEtelka
    might be too trendy for an American audience but norwegians are used to these
    types and it is definetly not too trendy.\r\n\r\n"

    dignity appropriate to a museum, I think Fedra, both the sans and serif, would
    be very good. \r\n\r\nIn the US [[http://www.nextbook.org/|Nextbook]], an organization

    goes with the ''Next'' idea, and has the visual message that they are not a stale
    repetition of past ideas--which is unfortunately very common--but a fresh take
    on Jewish tradition and culture. The combination of the straight and italic in
    the symbol just adds visual interest, and matches with both the roman title and
    italic subtitle. '

    Jews feel they are subject to regular unfair and negative portrayals, and so the
    clients, if they are Jewish, are likely to be sensitive, and maybe hyper-sensitive,
    to this. I may be wrong, but I suspect they want to look contemporary, but not
    'cutting edge' or 'edgy'. I think the main thing is to find out what the client
    thinks is appropriate.\r\n\r\nI really admire the designers of the 'Next Book'
    identity and magazine, as they managed to hit just the right note.  "

    OK, I'm way more emotional about type than the public will ever be. But the challenge
    is of hitting the right emotional note, which the client and the museum visitors
    will intuitively feel. I am a fan of Soho, but I would think that something more
    humanist, like PMN Caecilia, would be more suitable, if you want to go in the
    direction of a slab. I still like Fedra better for this use, as it has both very
    modern and humanist qualities.  \r\n\r\nI will be interested to see what Alex
    comes up with and the feedback from the client. "

  body: "How important a companion Hebrew font is depends on whether they will actually
    use Hebrew to identify items, etc., in the exhibitions. \r\n\r\nIf it the museum
    material is bilingual, then of course it is very important. It the Hebrew is only
    in displayed items, it is of secondary importance. \r\n\r\nVisually harmonizing
    Hebrew and roman is difficult, because Hebrew has thick horizontals and thin verticals,
    and roman is the other way around. \r\n\r\nThe most usual way to harmonize is
    by putting them in mirrored columns, so to speak. \r\n\r\nOne way is to use 'sans'
    style in both scripts, as these have less contrast. An interesting effort is the
    Hebrew font 'Erica Sans', (as in Eric Gill) which manages to 'Hebraicize' features
    of roman type in a good way. You can read about it [[http://www.oketz.com/iontef/|here]].\r\n\r\nYou
