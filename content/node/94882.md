body: "I decided to throw together a tumblr blog of my 3d type explorations. I know
  I'm treading well-worn ground here, but I'm teaching myself the software and having
  fun with type while doing it. Although there's nothing particularly groundbreaking
  here, there may be something of interest to the people that frequent this board.
  Hope you like it.\r\n\r\nhttp://coreyholms.tumblr.com/ \r\nand for those of you
  that don't like tumblr, I'm also replicating it all on my flickr site.\r\nhttp://www.flickr.com/photos/whinger/sets/72157630637179352/\r\n\r\nIf
  you don't like flickr or tumblr, sorry, got nothing else for you.\r\n\r\nHere's
  a teaser image [one of the better ones, ha].\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/tumblr_m7ex6598wI1rbwzc4o1_500_4707.jpg]"

  body: 'Thank you Hrant, your opinion means a lot to me, so I''m glad you like it.
    There''s not much to the, beyond pure playing with forms. I hope to be able to
    actually make something from it at some point. But for now I''m just playing and
    learning. '
