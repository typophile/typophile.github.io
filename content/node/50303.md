    \r\n\r\nI'm not personally a big proponent of randomization, but I think in some
    designs it could work fairly well. I guess its success would be determined by
    whether it achieves what you expect. I don't think too many fonts fool the reader
    into thinking its really hand made, although in short settings that may be achievable.
    When I design hand-lettered fonts, I just try to make the lettering set more convincingly
    and fluid.\r\n\r\nHave a look at Montague script (just released). It uses lots
    of contextual programing, but there is nothing random about it.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.veer.com/products/typedetail.aspx?image=UMT0000367\r\n\r\nStephen"

  body: you can never have 'true' randomization with OT fonts, the best you can get
    is some kind of 'pseudo-randomization'. it's not really all that hard to accomplish,
    depending on how random you want your text to appear. P22 Cezanne Pro is pretty
    nice when you have contextual alternates turned on. It cycles through 3 variations
    of glyphs, but the cycles are thrown off by higher level glyph substitutions that
    happen first to solve for shaping problems (such as that problematic t). The interaction
    of the cycling and the pre-emptive glyph substitutions gives a fairly organic
    texture IMO. As with any OT scripting/regular programming, it's about problem
    solving and there are ususally more than one way to crack any specific nut.

    Pro]], [[http://www.ascenderfonts.com/font/captain-quill.aspx|Captain Quill]]).\r\n\r\nI
    think it can be a nice effect and is especially well-suited to handwriting or
    calligraphic faces. I don't think one should enter a project like this with the
    idea that they're going to fool people into thinking it's \"real\", but I think
    it's a good route for introducing variety which would not otherwise be present
    (or which would only be present by a lot of manual intervention on the part of
    the user). While it's true that it is not too hard to <em>accomplish</em> (implement),
    we found it at times challenging to tweak and proof, to retain the pseudo-randomness
    while not introducing ugly or conflicting combinations. It is part design and
    part programming, and is probably best dealt with when both designer and programmer
    understand the goals and limitations of this effect going into the project (even
    when designer and programmer are the same person).\r\n\r\nAs to feedback: Lindsey
    Pro has been out for a while and I'm not aware of any negative comments on the
    pseudo-random feature, though I'm not sure whether a large percentage of our intended
    audience is able to make use of it. Captain Quill has only been out for a short
    while. I don't think we are in any giant hurry to do a lot of this. It's neat,
    and fun to play with, but I think it's best reserved for a few faces. One can
    end up spending a long time tinkering with no discernible improvement; only differences.\r\n"

    Lettering Swing uses (pseudo) randomization. That is, they have three sizes of

    the size of the previous one - though this is of course a clever illusion. There
    are a few extra twists with ligatures and such, and they may add code to also
    ensure that if you have the same letter twice in a row it looks different, but
    the basic technique is the randomization.\r\n"

    Type\" (that was his section title) and gave Local Gothic and Blakt\xFCr as examples

    appeared randomly over letters), while Ken Barber then talked about \"Determinism\"
    (\"proposition that every event is caused by an unbroken chain of occurrences
    that have preceded it\"). He used the PacMan world champion as an example and
    showed that the guy solved the PacMan mazes by pre-empting a huge series of events
    \u2014 similar to a chess play. He then made a point that a deterministically
    engineered typeface can appear \"organic\". He said that type is similar to lettering
    but is an even more controlled system than lettering system. He then said that
    the Studio Lettering project implemented rules based on deterministic behavior
    to achieve the goal of organic appearance, mimicking the lettering system they
    chose to follow. \r\n\r\nA."

    shapes relative to one another.\r\nIn a four-alternates font, even with four versions
    of a ligature, that only produces four alternates for, say, f_i.\r\nHowever, with
    no ligatures for that combination, there are 16 possible glyph-representations
    of the two character sequence.\r\n\r\nIf the intention is Thomas' *appearance*
    of randomness, which is to avoid repetitive sequences of glyphs AND keep identical
    glyphs as far apart as possible, there's only so much that can be done with a
    limited number of alternate sets. For instance, with four sets, I haven't beeen
    able to come up with a better cycle than this:\r\n1234 1324 3142\r\n\r\nAs it
    cycles, there is repetition at the 13-character interval, but to avoid that by
    running a longer cycle, then you get sets repeating too closely.\r\n\r\nThe more
    sets in a font, the less the confliciting criteria interfere with one another.
    Five sets is much better, and six way better. However, in an extended Latin font,
    each extra set is another 300 glyphs (yes, all marks etc. are necessary), and
    quite apart from the extra glyph-drawing time, that creates kerning problems.
    I found that I really had to rationalize class kerning severely in a 4-set font,
    or else it wouldn't compile, so that dissuaded me from adding another set.\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    have to agree 100%. So many graphic designers I've worked with don't notice these
    ugly repeats in typefaces that are meant to look distressed or organic. And when
    you leave the world of graphic design -- apparel designers, industrial designers,
    etc. -- their sense of type is just barely above that of the general public, in
    that they are aware of the existence of fonts and how to install them, but not
    too much beyond that. So I guess the question then is, \"Do people maybe pick
    up on this stuff at a subconscious level?\" I guess that really depends on the
    typeface and its application. Taking the above mentioned Montague Script, if you
    designed a wedding invitation in Montague and then designed another one in let's
    say Zapf Chancery, I think most people would identify the one designed in Montague
    Script as being somehow better, although they might not be able to tell you why.
    But \r\n\r\nI think of fonts right now as early synthesizer music. We'll look
    back in decades to come, when transparency, tonal gradation, faux paper weights
    and textures, and lots of other features will be supported in fonts, and laugh
    at a lot of the \"fancy\" tricks we used in 2008. It might be comparable to the
    $10,000 keyboards in 1985 that sort of sounded like a flute, and sort of sounded
    like a trumpet, but are pretty laughable now if you're trying to create the authentic
    sound of an instrument. Not that we should give up on new software and coding
    features -- I think with all the new technologies out there, the way type interacts
    with these applications and devices has barely been explored. But it definitely
    feels like we're in a transitional period, and font technology probably won't
    plateau for a couple of decades at least."
