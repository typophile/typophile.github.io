      and went down to the last question, click on THE LINK which is an actual link

  body: "<em>if I was to hand draw, what typeface should i use</em>\r\n\r\nWhy not
    just start drawing \"outline block capitals\", add a \"3D shadow\", and see how
    it works out? You can use just about any sans serif typeface as a reference for
    what the alphabet looks like, if you forget the shape of some of the letters :-)
    Alternatively, for a more authentically inept vernacular look, perhaps it would
    help do be slightly unfamiliar with the alphabet, so you could try doing it totally
    plastered.\r\n"
