		<div class="commentbody">Chicago suggests droping the periods in &ldquo;Ph.D.&rdquo; (Doctor of Philosophy), preserving the case distinction between the &ldquo;P&rdquo; and the &ldquo;h&rdquo;, but doesn&rsquo;t suggest going any further (15.21). In Elements, Bringhurst suggests eschewing all superfluous punctuation (5.4.4), such as with the British take on &ldquo;Mr&rdquo;, but also recommends using small caps for anything besides two-letter geographical acronyms and proper names (3.2.2)—the logic being that in some faces, full caps will be intrusive and mar the color of the page. If this seems to be the case with a given face for the word phrase &ldquo;PhD&rdquo;, then it would only be consistent to treat similar, mixed-case abbreviations (such as Mr, Dr, Jr) in like fashion.</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Recently it was my task to ‘calm down’ a text churned up by all-caps names, acronyms &amp; abbrevations. I intentionally wanted to break with conventions, as it just felt wrong to emphasize the formally necessary but negligible entourage of supplements instead of the actual message, by optical means.
Mixing caps w/ small caps even increased the ‘noise’. All small caps seemed to be only the second-best option: distinction would be leveled, information lost.
So I ended up trying a mix of small caps w/ lower case—a rather unusual &amp; delicate approach, I guess. And, besides the text sort, the particular font in use being the linchpin of success, of course.
What do you think, is that a reasonable alternative?</p>

<p>As to the small caps lower case letters &ndash; looks fine in the samples shown. Probably only works when the small caps are a bit taller than x-height, though that can usually be &ldquo;arranged.&rdquo; In my business, you&rsquo;d also have to watch for an angry editor; we work for one publisher where the editorial department decided that since GmbH <!-- raw HTML omitted -->might<!-- raw HTML omitted --> appear in the backmatter (and since notes and bibliographies tend to be visually broken up anyway), there will be no small caps in backmatter, at all.</p>

<p>Strangely enough, if you Google &ldquo;bringhurst+designer&rdquo;, you get great swacks of hits with things like &ldquo;designer Robert Bringhurst&rdquo; in them, so I&rsquo;m not sure that this was a particularly recent phenomenon.  It&rsquo;s also my understanding that he did Elements, at least in the beginning&hellip;.</p>

That’s very right. But at least they can’t claim it’s the ‘wrong case’. (Oh well, editors <!-- raw HTML omitted -->will<!-- raw HTML omitted --> complain anyway as long as it isn’t ugly yet.)</p>
<p>Thank you, Matthew, for this information. So it’s legitimate, hooray! ;-)
The Economist, no wonder … indeed, it’s economic, concerning space.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->It looks somewhat strange<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
and
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->works when the small caps are a bit taller than x-height<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
Yes, the method really depends on the font <!-- raw HTML omitted -->and<!-- raw HTML omitted --> the affected letters. I tried it out on a group of honourable people, with different results (orthodox way on top, ‘calmed down’ on bottom—notice how the ‘core names’ emerge from their title junk.):
[img:sites/default/files/old-images/abbr_4352.gif]</p>
<p>While Linda’s prefix really does well, the Diplom-Ingenieur looks kinda odd, imho. The i.R. (German suffix for ‘retired’) is quirky, too.</p>
<p>By the way, the actual names (w/out titles) are (even ‘more’) sacrosanct, aren’t they? Or would anyone small-capitalise LeRoy’s ‘R’—let alone the E.T.A.?</p>
<p>Eric, that’s true for a PhD or a Dr—but certainly fails with a Lieutenant Colonel.</p>

<p>Most fonts have small caps that are too close to x-height.
When I was working as an art director, I almost always had to make small caps bigger, by half a point usually. A compromise, as weight was affected.</p>
<p>Typical usage:</p>
<ol>
<li>Acronymns in text, e.g. the problematic &ldquo;U.S.&rdquo;, with the same letterforms as lower case</li>
<li>A line of all small caps used as a subhead</li>
<li>Titles (as in this thread).</li>
</ol>
<p>With small caps that are barely larger than x-height, all these usages suffer.</p>
<p>Now admittedly the problem of too-small small caps was traditionally ameliorated by letterspacing (tracking) them out, but that&rsquo;s a bit of a work-around.</p>
<p>IMO, small caps should be around 120% of the x-height. Most are under 110%.
Another reason for larger small caps (from the type designer&rsquo;s perspective) is that they are very necessary in Cyrillic, with many more common shapes between cases than in Latin.</p>
<p>Why do type designers make small caps so close to x-height? I suspect it is because we visually balance the effect of equal amounts of small cap text with U&amp;lc text, one-to-one (symmetry), and that does not correspond to typical typographic usage, which is asymmetric, requiring a small amount of small cap to hold its own against a much larger quantity of U&amp;lc.</p>

<p>In your example above, I&rsquo;d simply make it <!-- raw HTML omitted -->John Johnson, PhD<!-- raw HTML omitted -->.  In some cases, where someone has equivalent degrees &ndash; both an MFA and an MBA, or an MD and PhD &ndash; I&rsquo;d list both.</p>
<p>My brother-in-law is a good example: he&rsquo;s both an MD and a DVM, but I don&rsquo;t think he has a business card, since he successfully plays the stock market, and no one in the tax haven where he lives, cares.  ;-)</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Krania, I have 4 projects a year that list about 50 names, all with multiple degrees. The editor, and she is a good one - insists on the spacebands after each comma, no exceptions.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve set type for more years then I care to remember, and I have never been asked to drop the spacebands between degrees. Is this something new? We may have been asked to give 1-N spaces to save room, but without space looks like a typesetter didn&rsquo;t know what he/she was doing&hellip;</p>
<p>BTW - for PhD why even bother consulting Chicago Manual of Style? It was explained to me that the person spent their time and earned their degree - they are entitled to it as is. Even if it is to be set in Small Caps - the h would remain in lower case &ndash; just the nature of the beast.</p>
<p>Oh, and Linda, in your argument of periods or no periods - this is just typesetter opinion - either way should be okay - but just be consistent. If one degree is given it&rsquo;s punctuation, then it is said without giving - all degrees on that layout - should have periods. Same holds true without - than none shall receive&hellip; :-)</p>

<p>Had (past tense, thankfully) one client that had several different divisions in one relatively small building &ndash; each division had a unique way of writing the address.  I made the absolutely radical suggestion that everyone standardize on one form: you&rsquo;d have thought I suggested they all run naked through downtown in -40 weather.</p>
<p>So I was asked to come up with a recommendation &ndash; I presented them with a list of 22 alternatives! &ndash; and gave the rationale for my choice.

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I would not recommend setting PhD all in capitals, even if only because Ph should be thought of as one letter (the Greek Phi) and not as two (this is why the initial for Philippe is Ph. and not P. for say). Perhaps a good ligature would do, though? I thought that when I get my PhD I might write ΦD or Φd or something like that - I need to have a look at fonts which have a good set of Greek letters which mix well with the Roman ones etc. I wish I had done my Doctorate of Philosophy in Oxford where it is still abbreviated DPhil, which looks and sounds SO much better.</p>
<p>The rule on abbreviations in French is that if the abbreviation includes both the start and the end of a word, it is not followed by a point, otherwise it is. Hence &lsquo;M.&rsquo; for Monsieur (in very ancient use it is Mr, though) but &lsquo;Mme&rsquo; for Madame or &lsquo;Mlle&rsquo; for Mademoiselle.

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Linda,</p>
<p>Perhaps you would know if such a thing exists: At work, we have a very old and badly photocopied document which lists the correct abbreviation or acronym for universities. We use this list, which is by no means complete (and is also faded and illegible at the edges of the pages), for listing all the professors names and degrees, and where they earned them. I&rsquo;ve been Googling to try and find a similar online resource, but to no avail. This mysterious compendium also serves as our style guide for that section &ndash; which, I believe is where the strange no spaces rule originated.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, listing only the highest degree earned is not likely to be an option since we also include the conferring University. I presume some students want to know where there professors were educated and what kind of education they have, but like many things, we continue because &ldquo;we&rsquo;ve always done it like that&rdquo; without knowing exactly why. It certainly would be a whole lot simpler if we could do away with it all, believe me.</p>
<p>Do you know of any resources like that?&hellip; or some official organization that determines how university names can be abbreviated? (lol)</p>
<p>Just thought, as a sidetrack and thread hijacking, that you might have some insight.</p>
<p>Thx!
K.</p>

<p>In your mind&rsquo;s eye, imagine A, D, &amp; B in smalls; leave the f lowercase.</p>

<p>The other problem with using smalls in these kinds of instances comes when you need to make it plural: say, when you have lots of MPs. In most cases the small cap &ldquo;s&rdquo; is hardly distinguishable from the lowercase &ldquo;s&rdquo;.</p>
