  body: ' I&#39;ve always assumed it was &#34;treh-byoo-shay&#34; and nobody&#39;s
    ever corrected me... <BR> <BR>What&#39;s goofy about this typeface is the strange
    shift from the regular weight to the bold weight. The regular weight has flat
    terminals &#40;at the top of the t and h for example&#41;, but the bold weight
    shown in the Big Brother logo has angled terminals. <BR> <BR>Is this an anomoly
    or is this some design feature I&#39;m just naive about? Did multiple designers
    work on the different weights? <BR> <BR>//joe '

    <BR> <BR>&#34;Trebuchet MS, designed by Vincent Connare in 1996, is a humanist
    sans serif designed for easy screen readability.&#34; <BR> <BR>&#34;Trebuchet
    takes its inspiration from the sans serifs of the 1930s which had large x heights
    and round features intended to promote readability on signs.&#34;
