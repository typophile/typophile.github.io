  publisher is asking me when he was born/died. Every online source I find just quotes
  the same info: that he was the fella who actually engraved the designs (not the
  punches themselves) for romain du roi.\r\n\r\nAny further information, or leads
  as to where I can find more information on him, is much appreciated."

    the book on le Romain du Roi to which he contributed (do you have it?) does not
    have an index, and I don't have time to look through it now to see if Simonneau's
    dates are cited.\r\n\r\n[Updated to fix name spelling. Thanks, Craig.]"

  body: "The French Wiki on <a href=\"http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louis_Simonneau\"><strong>Louis
    Simonneau</a></strong> does not give much more information: he was born in Orl\xE9ans
    22 may 1654 and died in Paris 16 jan. 1727. The reference (E. Bellier de La Chavignerie
    , L. Auvray) does not say much more. Here is a grab from Gallica.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Simonneau_5766.jpg]\r\nThere
    is no mention of the Romain du Roy, just of the paintings he reproduced."

    This inquiry is an entry in the timeline in my upcoming book on commercial engraving,
