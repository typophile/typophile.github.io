body: I just got an email from someone in Australia requesting a quote for a custom
  font family in two weights plus italics and "reasonable" extended characters. Says
  "I have a specific design in mind". This would be for exclusive corporate use. What
  is an appropriate range to charge for this sort of project? Since I'm based in the
  USA, what special considerations might be necessary for dealing with an Australian
  client?

  body: i actually just did this for someone in california. based on time, id' charge
    at the very least 15K. the project was about six months of daily back'n'forth
    on an altered version of an existing typeface. not fun.

  body: "I wonder why he's come to you and not say a local Australian type designer?
    Is he a fan of your work, or maybe he's just spamming a whole bunch of freeware
    designers that he thinks may work for less money than established vendors who
    do corporate work. Is the \"specific design\" he has in mind one of yours? If
    not I assume he's going to want you to do something that's similar to an existing
    font and indeed that seems like trouble. The way you describe it the whole thing
    does seem a bit fishy. \r\n\r\nAnyway re. pricing treat it like any other work
    for hire, ie. your hourly rate x expected number of hours plus additional fees
    / mark-up for changes.\r\n\r\nCheers, Si"

  body: Si- I suspect that is exactly what is going on. The actual email I got was
    just as vague as I described, and I have not yet replied. My only released fonts
    (learning projects made years ago) have been distributed at free font sites like
    [[http://1001fonts.com]] and [[http://dafont.com]] so, while he might think my
    fonts have some merit, it is likely he has contacted other free-fonters out there
    too.

  body: he's clearly shopping on price. this will be a difficult sales cycle at best,
    and the design process will more than likely not be productive. i would not consider
    this a serious sales prospect.

    an existing font he'd seen on dafont.com of my design for exclusive use plus condensed
    and bold versions, though not specifying which font.\r\n\r\nThis guy seems more
    legit than the last one: has phone numbers and links to a German design studio
    web site on which his name appears with an email address from the same domain.
    Still smells a bit fishy, based on the similarity to the last one, but not as
    much so. What do y'all think about this? Anybody else getting a letter like this
    lately?"
