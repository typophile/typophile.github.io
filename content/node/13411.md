body: "My client's logo (workmark, specifically) is his company name \"CHOP!\" set
  in Aldous Vertical (which is extremely condensed). Whenever possible, it is presented
  as an absence, laser cut from the paper (a few tiny tabs were added to allow the
  workmark to function as a stencil). \r\n\r\nI am designing his business cards and
  a brochure. However, this wordmark is difficult to design around. Anything he has
  printed must be square. The workmark is essentially square as well. Because the
  back of the paper will feature the wordmark laser cut in reverse, I have restricted
  myself to using the front only. \r\n\r\nCan anyone suggest a clean, elegant, sans
  serif font to use with Aldous Vertical? There will not be a great deal of body text.
  I have been playing with Avenir and Ledger Light. I can not decide of I should select
  something condensed or rather go for contrast?\r\n\r\nAlso, any suggestions on where
  I might place the business card text in relation to this cut away wordmark would
  be greatly appreciated. I generally prefer to avoid centred designs, but with the
  square within a square I am designing around, it might be the best option in this
  case.\r\n\r\nThanks for your help.\r\n\r\nTim\r\n"

    the idea of Avenir Light. You might also look at Emigre's Vista Light
