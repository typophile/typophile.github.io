  body: 'Some notes on process. <BR> <BR>I have thought a lot about the process of
    creating a face. I have long believed that the medium/process used to create a
    face is nearly as important as anything else. The modernists wanted to divorce
    themselves from medium in their designs, but their compases, graph paper and technical
    pencils betrayed them and show through as clearly as do the chisels and brushes
    of lapidary hands. <BR> <BR>I have heard a lot of people talk about drawing faces
    out on paper first, which I have never done since I was in the fifth grade &#40;my
    first font was a memphis style looking thing with a triangular &#39;A&#39; done
    as a bitmap font in ResEdit&#41;. I have heard about people writing alphabets
    with tradtional calligraphic impliments, which I have tried, but I have shakey

    with a process lately the yeilds some interesting effects, and helps immensely
    with traditional serif text faces &#40;note that this is the same process I used

    then the calligraphic stroke I put on it, then the finished characters, which
    I edit bezier handle by handle. <BR> <BR>I am curious about other peoples&#39;
    processes. What do you do when you start to design a face? What time-saving techniques
    do you use. &#40;Time is important in letter design, ask the originators of the
    cursive egyptian glyphs that some argue are the foundation for our alphabet&#41;.
    How do you make organic shapes from bezier curves. Do you trace hand drawn samples,
    or are you good enough to just draw them on screen looking at your sketches, or
    do you start from scratch?'

  body: 'Christian -- <BR> <BR>The Dwiggins templates that get mentioned periodically
    were used in the first drafts of his Falcon typeface. Their use was documented
    by Dwiggins in his letter to Ruzicka. This was later published by the Harvard
    College Library as <I>WAD to RR: A letter about designing type</I> &#40;perhaps
    ironically: completely hand-lettered&#41;. Dwiggins&#39;s employment of stencils
    in general &#40;usually for the creation of ornaments -- what he once called &#34;geometrical
    spinach&#34;&#41; was described in detail by his assistant Dorothy Abbe in her
    book <I>Stencilled Ornament &amp; Illustration</I>. <BR> <BR>The templates shown
    by Dwiggins in <I>WAD to RR</I> comprise an ascending stem, an x-height stem,
    an arched leg, and a bowl. <BR> <BR>This template method was not his usual process.
    And as far as I know, this is the only time he experimented with them for type
    design. And it is worth noting that two years after the RR letter, Dwiggins completely
    abandoned the template-derived letters of the first Falcon. In a letter to Chauncey
    Griffith in August 1942 he wrote: &#34;Falcon No. 1 now seems terribly clumsy
    and heavy and dead in its modelling and in its proportioning. The essence of type
    design, as I get it now, is to hit a middle ground between mechanical exactitiude
    and the flow and variety of a written hand -- <U>suggesting</U> some of the flow
    and variety, but controlling it so the letter can be repeated . . . Falcon B is
    all drawn free hand. I passed up the straight-edge lines, angular junctions and
    templates of No. 1.&#34; <BR> <BR>&#40;Tiffany, anything to add?&#41; <BR> <BR>If
    you can find a copy of <I>WAD to RR</I>, I recommend reading it. &#40;I see several
    copies available from the network of dealers at abebooks.com, but they aren&#39;t
    cheap.&#41;  Also, you should look for a copy of Walter Tracy&#39;s <I>Letters
    of Credit</I>. <BR> <BR>A photostat is a reproduction made by a photographic process
    -- often used for enlarging or reducing, also for making halftones, etc. -- involving
    a large process camera, photographic paper, chemicals, that sort of stuff. That&#39;s
    how we used to do things before all this new-fangled digital stuff came along.

  body: Ymmy. I love hearing other talk about the process. A great analogy would be
    tasting an amazing dish, not knowing the essential ingredients at first, enjoying
    it for what it is. Then joining the chef in the kitchen to see what goes into
    making it and then tasting the dish again only to be able to taste the different
    ingredients. <BR>  <BR>I would also highly recommend reading Chris Burke&#39;s
    book on Renner  The chapter on Futura is most applicable to your questions, but
    the entire books is worth any typophile&#39;s time. Also found at Hypen is Fred
    Smeijer&#39;s &#39;Counterpunch&#39;. And also ... not to exclude the plethora
    of information ... anything on Gill. The reason I like Gill&#39;s way of looking/seeing,
    is because he saw &#40;as all those old schooler&#39;s probably did&#41; the negative
    as well as the positive. I cannot say that I have carved stone &#40;missed that
    opportunity&#41; or cut metal. But just the act of it must force you too see things
    much differently. &#40;Thoughts?&#41; &#40;&#40; I think I have the &#39;Letters
    of Credit&#39; photocopied too. &#41;&#41; <BR>  <BR>As for Dwiggins, well Christian
    I have an entire folder from the Kentucky archives should you be interested as
    well as two binders full of notes and such. Including the &#39;WAD to RR&#39;
    as well as different templates used by WAD. He was, from what I can gather, on
    of the first to draw at the template size for the routing machine. &#40;correction?&#41;
    Goudy drew at much larger sizes which had to be sized down and so lost even more
    detail. And the fact that Dwiggin purposefully put seemingly odd nooks and crannies
    ... well one reason could have been because he knew that the cutter would lose
    some of it at 12 point. maybe? <BR>  <BR>Some might think that Falcon in it&#39;s
    original form was odd, but that is where I think it was at its best. When he stopped
    experimenting and starting conforming is when is became boring. Grief, I need
    to re-read my own writing on Falcon, but I really think that is true. One former
    Reading Professor agreed with me on that too. <BR>  <BR> <BR>Grief, it is early...  <BR>  <BR>Obviously
    because there is no longer &#40;necessarily&#41; a need to cut metal and draw
    larger templates, it isn&#39;t necessary to add overly exaggerated nuances to
    the letters &#40;unless on purpose&#41;. But in your letters, Christian, those
    are the characters that I find most interesting. The UC &#39;K&#39;, the splayed
    &#40;RIGHT?&#41; UC &#39;M&#39;, your UC &#39;Q&#39; and the details of the &#39;X&#39;.
    The angle of the pen in general I do really like, but I can see where is some
    characters it becomes too much. For instance, the UC &#40;alernate?&#41; &#39;A&#39;
    and &#39;E&#39;, as well as the &#39;C&#39;. the &#39;S&#39; loses some of the
    uniqueness IMO too. your lc &#39;b&#39; is a little to Tschichold &#40;RIGHT?&#41;
    or was it Bauer? Grief! I really like the lc &#39;e&#39;, the cross-stroke on
    the &#39;f&#39; is too high IMO. again the lc &#39;k&#39; is wonderful. Wasn&#39;t
    it you that said &#39;k&#39; is your favorite character? I&#39;m not sure about
    the descending stroke &#40;?&#41; serif &#40;?&#41; on the &#39;t&#39; and the
    &#39;l&#39;, it seems contrary somehow. and I like the lc &#39;y&#39; and some
    of the details again in the &#39;x&#39;. <BR>  <BR>Shrinking the window just now.
    reviewing the characters. the alternates &#39;AFE&#39; stand out too much &#40;approx
    viewing them at 14 pt&#41;the beard on the &#39;G&#39;, the stroke becomes too
    think and the end of the beard becomes too thin? Still like &#39;KLMNOPQR&#39;.
    &#39;S&#39; is almost sans serif looking. maybe just a little less curve on the
    &#39;VWX&#39;. the &#39;Y&#39; needs ... kinda looks like a martini glass. the
    vertical stroke needs to be shortened? the &#39;Z&#39; is too wide? the &#39;b&#39;
    is quite as obvious, but still stands out. i really like what happens to the &#39;g&#39;
    at the smaller sizes and the &#39;k&#39;. what was odd in the &#39;pq&#39; is
    now very nice and the &#39;w&#39; is almost just right. the &#39;x&#39;, your
    nuances help to leave it open IMO. i still like the y and the z isn&#39;t as bad
    either.  <BR>  <BR>what at larger sizes is calligraphic is now useful. woah that
    sounds too much of a blanket statement. but your faces, Christian, have always
    had a utilitarian/bookish flavor to them. which is so much more useful and wouldn&#39;t
    it be nice if the books we read were nice to read? <BR>  <BR>it is early. i&#39;ve
    just ridden a bike for an hour. these statements could be over the top. Christian.

    that all of the letterforms were cut in mirror image for casting. Dwiggins would

    to draw each character. IMO the characters are unique with a similar &#40;or same&#41;

    I think I will have to make a sans from the lineal. Any suggestions on those terminals?
    <BR> <BR>Thanks, Kent, for your run down on templates. I was fascinated by the
    idea because I copy/paste a lot in illustrator. Obviously the serifs are copied
    a lot as well as the bowls. I&#39;m kind of embarassed to say that often I copy

    I. <BR> <BR>Like I say, this font is as much an experiment on process as anything

    a very good result. This one only took one night for the first round. I&#39;m
