body: "Hi guys,\r\n\r\nI was recently working on a project where i thought the title
  really needed a serif font with a wide swashed capital J.  I could really imagine
  what i was looking for, yet i'm not sure if this is from memory or just fantasy
  :)\r\n\r\nI found something vaguely similar to what i'm after in the image below,
  yet what I'm particularly thinking of is slightly more modern and bigger, wider
  swashes.\r\n\r\nAny suggestions would be highly appreciated!\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/cherylbailey_5087.jpg]"
