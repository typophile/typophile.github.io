body: Hello, I am a student, re-designing a newspaper about homeless issues. I want
  to make it look more elegant than street. I'm looking for a typeface that has a
  high character count and is legible at small sizes, preferably something that is
  being used today in papers. Any suggestions?

  body: I too like Charter, but Arnhem is also a nice font for this sort of thing.
    I believe it was originally designed for newspaper work . . .

    a student. On reflection, that's OK, most of us who have been professionals for
    quite a while hope we are still students. "
