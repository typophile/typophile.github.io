  and the extra bold as masters and will interpolate the rest of the weights.\r\n\r\nHowever,
  when I kern I would prefer that the kerning automatically will apply to both masters
  and the generatad weights in between. Right now the pairs I add only applies to
  the weight I have chosen to kern.\r\n\r\nOr... could I decide wheather to use the
  same kerning for all weights or kern the both weights differntly and then interpolate
  the kerning also?\r\n\r\nAnyone with this experience?\r\n\r\nThanks in advance!\r\n\r\nG\xF6ran"

    the Extra bold anyway.\r\nWhen you\xB4re happy with the kerning on these, interpolate
    the kerning in the intermediate weights.\r\nThis works best if you have the the
    same kern pairs in both masters.\r\n"

  body: "Hi Toby \u2013 eller kan man s\xE4ga Hej kanske ;-)\r\n\r\nYes, they will
    be the same. At least as a start. I have a system for that already, that correspondence
    to the sidebearings difference in the weights. Then I will only make certain excpetions
    where needed, that has more to do with the different shapes in letter forms between
    light and bold.\r\n\r\nI guess I could just save the Metrics file and then import
    it into FontLab for the other weight, but the best would be to be able to actually
    \"see\" the kerning isntantly on both weights.\r\n\r\n<cite> This works best if
    you have the the same kern pairs in both masters. </cite>\r\n\r\nThis will also
    be easier achieved if the kerning was active on both masters right from the start.\r\n\r\nIsnt
    it possible to activate the kerning to apply for both masters? There must be...\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    metrics as .afm file. then activate your bold weight and import the metrics file.
    it will ask you what to use - select only the kerning.\r\n\r\ntitus"

  body: "i am sorry, i didn't read the second post. yet, i don't see the difference
    between having the same kerning active on both masters from the start, or adding
    the same values - which gives you the same result.\r\n'interact'? i thought they
    should have the same values? and if they differ, they are interpolated when you
    generate an instance."

  body: "Yes, I know. With interact I mean that I want to lets say kern the A + V
    on the extra light, and then switch to the Extra bold and se how the kerning pair
    will work on both masters. If I change the light, I also want the Bold o be changed
    automatically. I want to see it happen \"live\" is what I mean.\r\n\r\nWhat I'm
    trying to do is to develop a system on a font where the sidebearing-difference
    is related to the kerning so they could share the same kerning value. I convinced
    it will work on this particular font, but I would love to be able to compare them
    both instantly.\r\n\r\nFor example, if the Light O has a sidedearing that is 60
    on both sides and the Bold has 40 and a kerning pair is needed on O A. Lets say
    the preferred kerning is -20. That could be the same as -30 if the sidebearing
    was bigger on the light etc. So what I am doing is making a system from the start
    that relates to the sidebearings difference. Well, at least a try to do this :)\r\n\r\nI'm
    having problems describing this idea in english, but maybe you get the point?"

  body: "Your wish is understood, I think.&nbsp;&nbsp;;-)&nbsp;&nbsp;If the weights/styles
    are compatible (in terms of both spacing and kerning) then it'd be better to space/kern
    one, and only in a second step copy values to the other master as described above,
    to check and correct values where necessary.\r\n\r\nIf you manage to keep them
    1:1 compatible, then only one style actually needs kerning values: generate the
    kern feature (with FLS' \"Update kern feature\" or the AFDKO2 script) and copy/paste
    it to the other fonts. If you use AFDKO2 to generate fonts, you wouldn't even
    need to do this but just refer to a common kerning file. So kerning values need
    not be present in all masters. But it is most unlikely that this would work."

  body: "Well, on some fonts, if seeing the kerning on both masters \u2013 the kerning
    could also be used as a tool to find small errors in sidebearings (or developing
    a system where the kerning and sidebearings work together). That is pretty much
    why I want this function to be available.\r\n\r\nI am not talking about a traditional
    serif font here, but if you take a look at Flieger Pro, it is easy to see the
    positive sides of being able to see the kerning right away on both masters.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.autodidakt.se/index.php?page=flieger\r\n\r\nI
    could here decide that I want to use only one kerning (to save time) and then
    adjust the sidebearings according to that on each master to make the joining strokes
    \"connect\" to the next glyph where kerning is needed for that.\r\n\r\nI think
    it makes sense in a way. Especially when the sidebearings in <strong>not</strong>
    the same on both masters."
