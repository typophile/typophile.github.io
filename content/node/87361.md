  and left-leaning italics?\r\n\r\n(I did a quick search but couldn't find anything
  already posted, incase there's a thread already I'd be grateful to find out where.)\r\n\r\nCheers!"

    how I\u2019ve always called them ever since I\u2019ve been there.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.linotype.com/1410/Roemisch-family.html\">Roemisch</a>
    and <a href=\"http://www.linotype.com/1582/Venus-family.html\">Venus</a> both
    have italics and contra italics. I\u2019m sure there\u2019s more. Some of the
    fat faces by Figgins and other English foundries from the 19th century used to
    have contra italics as well."

  body: 'Depressing how many backslant fonts are (or seem to be) just mechanically
    slanted obliques (especially non-script style ones): I imagine it would be an
    interesting exercise to try and work out what the cursive dynamics would be of
    writing right-way-round letters but from right to left (whereby the natural italic
    tendency would be backslant)...'
