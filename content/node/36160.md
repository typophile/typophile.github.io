body: "I have settled on type design for my senior BFA thesis. Unfortunately that\u2019s
  not something a thesis anyone has done at my school in a while, if ever, so I don\u2019t
  know how prepared my professors will be to guide my through this. So as part of
  my research I am looking into how people handle a type design thesis at schools
  where such a thing is not a rarity. If anyone has posted a BFA type design thesis
  online, published it in a magazine, or just wants to <a href=\"mailto:james.puckett@gmail.com\">email
  me a PDF</a> I would really appreciate knowing about it\u2014and might even cite
  it! I would also appreciate any advice on potential pitfalls to avoid, timesavers
  to keep in mind, or unexpected and overlooked sources of information."

    It wasn''t a thesis per se, but it was a school project on type design and very
    interesting academically. '

  body: James, I don't know if this is useful, but Reading's <a href="http://www.rdg.ac.uk/AcaDepts/lt/"><strong>Department
    of Typography</strong></a> has an online list of past theses, with links to the
    ones that have been published. There's no direct link; sorry -- you'll have to
    click on "research" and then, on that page, "past theses". Good luck!

    \r\n2. Use [[http://briem.ismennt.is/|Briem]] and [[http://www.amazon.com/Letters-Credit-View-Type-Design/dp/1567922406/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1/102-9247567-6612147?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1187234238&sr=8-1|Tracy]].\r\n3.
