  for a fall festival, and I was shooting for something reminiscent of beer and the
  wheat harvest, with some feeling of history and handcrafted but orderly. I iterated
  a bunch in ink on paper, and then chose the one I liked best, and have been trying
  to work out the details on the computer. I would love your feedback on shapes, counters,
  terminals, letter-spacing, etc. Thanks in advance,\r\n\r\nPeter"

  body: It is nice! I am noticing the collision of s-t. A cool ligature here would
    be nice. Also the thin terminal of the /e feels slim compared to the rest of the
    serifs and even the /t. Cool work!

  body: Great points. I had the same thought about the thinness of the e terminal.
    Thanks for the thoughts!

    happy about, and am trying some ligatures. I wonder, should I also have a ligature
    for the e bumping into the s?\r\n\r\nPeter\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Heidelfest_6472.png]\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Ligatures_5854.png]"

  body: I like the second one. But now the e_s almost-collision seems unresolved.

  body: "I assume a small connection would be appropriate?\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/eConnection_3428.png]\r\nNow
    I'm wondering about the s_t space. Maybe a bit too much? Trying to keep the stem
    (right term?) of the t from bumping into the terminal of the s."

  body: I think the /es connection is working nicely, but I wonder about bumping the
    crossbar of the /t to the right a bit to move it away from the /s? Perhaps something
    with just a bit more flair at the beginning of the word might balance it more.
    Perhaps a bit more flourish on the /H?

    I think I'm going to end up doing this one (below). A subdued flourish on the
    H for balance, but overall closer to the simplicity of the original. I think.
    You can sense my conviction wavering, but I have to print this really soon!\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Heidel_final_5847.png]\r\nThanks
    a ton for the feedback.\r\n\r\nPeter"

  body: Yes this is quite a nice evolution. I think you made the right choice about
    being subtle with the flourish.
