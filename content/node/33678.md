  body: '"DIN Bold Alternate" sounds like <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/fontfont/ff_din_bd_bd_exp_bd_alt/">FF
    DIN Bold Alternate</a>, but I''ve never heard of "DIN Gothic". Perhaps <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/fontfont/ff_din_lt_lt_exp_lt_alt/">FF
    DIN Light</a>?'
