  formats are unrecognizable in my Mac OS X 10.6. The files are all in .afm .inf .pfb
  .pfm formats and I could not find the TrueType or OpenType format at all.\r\n\r\nI
  have looked up on Google, they said it's a kerning format, etc.\r\nBut I need help
  on how to compile all of them into the .ttf format? So that I can use this typeface.\r\n\r\nThanks
  so much."

    to make them usable on a Mac."

    Quite often conversion from one format to another is\r\nnot allowed in a font's
    license. On the other hand, I'm\r\nof the opinion that if a font is legally owned

    it's OK.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
