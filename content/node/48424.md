    unique set of attributes that you want to apply to several different runs of text,
    make it a Character Style and apply at will."

    press, say option key, and select a word from here and a sentence from there...
    (As you can in Apple TextEdit for example.)\r\n\r\nThe idea and some comments
    in Ubuntu developers forum:\r\nhttp://brainstorm.ubuntu.com/idea/3674/\r\n\r\nEyedropper
    is handy but it doesn't copy styles, only the parameters.\r\n"

    I notice TextEdit pastes the selections on separate lines after a copy -- pretty
    neat.\r\n\r\nA related feature I occasionally miss from my old PageMaker dayz
    is selecting columns of text. With PageMaker, you could select any text <em>vertically</em>,
    right out of the middle of running paragraphs, and cut, copy, or format at will.\r\n\r\nThe
    thing is, these sort of things are not built-in behaviour. A programmer has to
    physically work around the \"single-selection\" paradigm that has been a part
    of GUIs for ages."
