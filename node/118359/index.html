<p>instead of saving ink and paper with such minor steps like having really short descenders and huge x-heights, each letter could now encode the letter following it in its typeface, thus cutting the length of texts almost in <!-- raw HTML omitted -->half<!-- raw HTML omitted -->!</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m assuming that for readability, words would still be separated with spaces, and so one might have a 27th neutral typeface for the last letter of words with an odd number of letters.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Well, I admit this proposal was made in jest.</p>
<p>Introducing a set of syllabary symbols into the Latin script similar to the Japanese katakana would be a simpler way to increase the density of texts.</p>
<p>The idea (if it wasn&rsquo;t obvious from the original post) was that, in one possible implementation of the scheme, a letter in Artistik is that letter followed by an A; a letter in Arnold Bocklin is that letter followed by a B; a letter in Cheltenham is that letter followed by a C; a letter in Lydian is that letter followed by an L; a letter in Optima is that letter followed by an O; a letter in Peignot is that letter followed by a P; that sort of thing.</p>
<p>However, since this requires recognition dependent on fine details of the letters, the obvious refutation of this proposal is to present the clearly better alternative of reducing the type size by 30%.</p>

<p>I am proposing leaving out every second letter in every word.

<p>So, since the use of different typefaces is an available degree of freedom, I exploit it to convey actual textual information.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->What are you proposing this for, and why would you only omit the second letter? How does this cut the length of the texts almost in half?<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>Well, if you have 26 different typefaces to work with, then each typeface can stand for a different letter.</p>
<p>So if you have a letter, the letter it is stands for one letter, and the typeface it&rsquo;s in stands for the letter following.</p>
<p>If I omit all the letters, how can anyone see what typeface they&rsquo;re in? Or perhaps you meant that you thought I was omitting only the second letter of the word, instead of <!-- raw HTML omitted -->every<!-- raw HTML omitted --> second letter - omitting the fourth letter, because its identity is given by the typeface of the third letter, omitting the sixth letter, because its identity is given by the typeface of the fifth letter, and so on, also.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Take it a step further and encode every word in the dictionary as one revival of the Garamond types.<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>There may be <!-- raw HTML omitted -->enough<!-- raw HTML omitted --> of them, but would they be easily enough distinguishable for the system to work?</p>
<p>Thus, there are even more than 676 typefaces in existence, but using the typeface of a letter to indicate the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->two<!-- raw HTML omitted --> letters following is clearly not practical.</p>
<p>Now, another degree of freedom would be to use the Greek, Cyrillic, Armenian, or Ethiopic scripts to represent letters. Or, to get enough visually distinct objects to represent all the words in the dictionary, there are Chinese characters. But while the Chinese characters map systematically to the syllables of Chinese, how would one map them to the words of English in a memorizable fashion?</p>
<p>To find a high-efficiency writing system for English, one option might be to adapt the Korean script&hellip;</p>

Certainly knowing the context helps in making the appropriate associations. I could have deciphered this if the appropriate associations would have been made, whether it&rsquo;s by recalling memories or by being creative in my thinking—both seem to be linked to the capacity to associate.</p>
<p>I have to admit though—being Dutch—for some reason I didn&rsquo;t even consider trying to fit /y into the words (as it&rsquo;s not a common letter in the Dutch language), which might have given enough insight to guess the words. Although, not being well versed in (American) politics I&rsquo;m skeptical as to whether I would&rsquo;ve guessed &ldquo;lobby congress&rdquo;. Those are not words I generally use.</p>
