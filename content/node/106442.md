  Pop and Rocket Pop Outline are influenced by product packaging and cereal box art
  from the 1960's and 1970's. The fonts will work as companions or separate. Best
  used over 36pt as a headline display face, these fonts will bring a bold playfulness
  to any project where a vintage or retro style is in the concept. The style reflects
  the era when things were indeed, mad, where men (and some women) did crazy art for
  vinyl records, food packaging and kiddie products. Sugar frosted blue donut cereal
  is yummy for your tummy like... Rocket Pop and Rocket Pop Outline. Buy both and
  get the discount! Watch for the Cerealboxx Set coming soon that will include the
  astroluxtype fonts, Sugarbang! Koo Koo Puff and Rocket Pop together in one box.
