  cannot find the threads. (Searching seems to be disabled)\r\n\r\nI am re-filing
  all of my typefaces and I am looking for a better way of organising them. Currently
  they are alphabetical. Yes, I know, it doesnt work at all.\r\n\r\n\r\nAny links
  to previous threads or suggestions will be appriciated.\r\n\r\nGustav  "

  body: I use Linotype FontExplorer and use it kind of like iTunes making playlists
    like 'sans' 'serif' etc.. then more specific ones like 'techie' 'round' 'text'
    this really seems to work for me!

  body: I organize by foundry because that is how I know them. I tag using description.
    (Although I've only recently begun doing this because I seem to trash my font
