  body: Brian, don&#39;t get discouraged by a lack of meaningful feedback, or sarcasm
    from Ole. Everybody has a starting point. <BR> <BR>It appears that you started
    off with a &#34;bitmap grid&#34; and blurred the letters in Photoshop a bit. Perhaps
    go back to the original grid and refine some of the shapes, and especially, the
    numbers. If you are going to bring it in to Photoshop, maybe you could experiment
    with the bitmap halftone screens to come up with something off the wall. <BR>
    <BR>If you need some suggestions about methods of creating scratch fonts in Illustrator,
    feel free to email me at <A HREF="mailto:bjharvey@apollo26.com">bjharvey@apollo26.com</A>.
    <BR> <BR>When you&#39;re new to this, sometimes you just need a method to the
    madness. <BR> <BR>bj
