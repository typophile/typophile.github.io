body: "In Ali Smith's first novel, Like, there is a chapter where a 7-year-old girl
  is reading a book called \"One Hundred And One Great Wonders Of The World\". It's
  rare to have descriptions of letters or fonts in fiction, so I enjoyed these little
  observations:\r\n\r\n \"\u2026It's funny how the letters that make up words can
  look like people. They can look like different people depending on what book they're
  in or what sign they're on, depending on how they're written or painted. In this
  book the small a's look sort like small nice people with fat stomachs. The other
  way of doing a's, the round way, makes them look like they have long faces. The
  capital M on Matterhorn looks like it's had its points sharpened ready for a fight.
  Some e's can look smiley but usually they look like they do here, mean, like they're
  laughing or something horrible. Small d's always look like they're wide awake. Small
  g's like they're holding out a hand to shake it, or if they have loops underneath,
  like they're looking at you with their mouths open.\"\r\n\r\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Like-Novel-Ali-Smith/dp/0151003505/ref=ntt_at_ep_dpi_5"
