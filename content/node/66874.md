body: "I'm looking for a clean font that is equivalent to FF Trixie. I love the option
  of FF Magda to choose between a distressed or a clean version. Unfortunately, FF
  Magda is too techno-ish for my purpose.\r\nI tried a lot of Typewriter Fonts, but
  everything i could find was close, but not the same as a clean FF Trixie would look
  like. Different serifs, kerning, etc.\r\n\r\nAny idea? FontBook shows a \"Typewriter\"
  Font. Unfortunately without any reference to designer or foundry. And googling \"Typewriter\"
  is, well, you know\u2026"

    If you can locate that then you can probably get a clean character set from a
    typewriter museum. '

  body: "Hi Florian, I guess the Elementa is the closest, you can get. I'm not 100%
    convinced with the different weights of the font but it's a good call. Cheers!\r\n\r\nThat's
    what they say on letterror.com, quite a cocky attitude from those guys, but anyway:\r\n\xABTrixie
    was taken from a typed sample from a typewriter owned by a friend in Berlin, Beatrix
    G\xFCnther, or Trixie for short.\xBB"

    a clean version them self. "
