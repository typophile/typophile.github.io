  serif on the lowercase i which makes things a little interesting. Oh and bonus points
  if you can ID the film the text is referring to. (That I know the answer to)\r\n\r\nThank
  you.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Yes, just noted that myself. I also first thought it was Officina but changed
    to the wrong track\u2026\r\n\r\nThe sample is quite small but this definitely
    looks squooshed. It may well be small enough to make the turning stems of Officina\u2019s
    r, n, m disappear."

  body: I'll take your word for it that it's Officina. And yes, the film in question
    is The Others. Good guess.

  body: FF Unit is "straighter". This is most probably ITC Officina. Sure "feels"
    like it.

    need to be sorry. When you design type for other people to use, you have to live
    with bad use. If you write a pop song, tone-deaf people will sing it in their
    bathtubs. Or \u2013 much worse \u2013 at Karaoke. Whatever the circumstances,
    your work has entered the public domain and you have to see any usage at all as
    a compliment.\r\n\r\nMind you: people who pay for their type usually take a little
    more care not to harm it. \r\n\r\nI bet that 90% of all ITC Officina in use that
    I see comes from a font that somebody \u201Cfound\u201C \r\non their hard drive.
    The license fees are certainly not in step with its widespread use."
