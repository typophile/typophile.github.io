body: I've read the thread on  Greek typography -- well, a goodly portion of the almost
  300 posts. All the talk about scribes and pens lead me to wonder what effect  the
  ball-point pen has had on type. Does anyone *like* the writing from ball-point pens?
  Can we blame/credit it for the proliferation of sans-serifs? Etc.

    to generate stroke contrast (even though that was essentially dumb luck). Which
    to me however does not mean it deserves pride of place in type design.\r\n\r\nBTW
    there was actually a historic, long-running discussion between Nicolete Gray and
    Gerrit Noordzij about the relevance of the ball-point pen versus the broad-nib
    pen. Gray's position was that the ball-point pen is (or rather, was) the tool
    of our time. All I have to say is: now that we're back to the index finger I hope
    our typefaces don't start looking like they were made in pre-school!\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    a horrid germ-laden plastic contraption (tethered for some reason, as if anyone
    would be remotely inclined to make off with it), at which point I reach into my
    jacket and produce this gleaming aerodynamic artefact, ostentatiously click it
    a few times, and proceed to autograph said document with \uFB02ourish. Of course,
    I <em>could</em> do that with a fountain pen, but they\u2019re messy and tempremental,
    I can\u2019t be bothered to \uFB01ll them all the time, and they don\u2019t click.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/3cccd0025c608665623f058ddba2786a_5792.jpg]\r\n<em>Parker

    had them with little plastic cartridges, so the spill/leakage problem was less.
    And the ball point pens of the time leaked, too. But the cartridges were a little
    expensive, and I could write smaller with a ball point....\r\n\r\nI was more interested
    in whether or not anyone felt the rise of the ball point had an effect on type
    design & the rise of the sans serifs."

  body: "Charles, I think the chronology is wrong for the ball point pen to have been
    a force, at least early on. Sans were first used for text in Germany, by the Bauhaus
    and then others as part of the modernist movement there. My own pet theory is
    that this was partly a nationalist thing: a way for German designers to reject
    blackletter for text, while not appearing to be traitors to foreigners, who had
    used roman style text for centuries. They weren't aping Italians or French, but
    rather becoming 'International'. The internationalism also matched the socialist
    ideals, which many modernists had allegiance to. \r\n\r\nBall point pens didn't
    become widely used until after WWII: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ballpoint_pen#History
    . So they could have conceivably helped ease the acceptance of the 'international
    style' that had started in the German speaking world. But they couldn't have been
    the thing that started it. \r\n\r\nThere are now plenty of scripts and lettering
    influenced by the ball point pen, but they don't seem to be all that popular."

    monoline scripts were used in technical drawings (standard as from 1919) and scientific
    illustrations long before (1850ties) the Bauhaus even noticed typography as something
    that could be designed. Before the first technical drawing pens such as the Standardgraph
    were constructed, round-tipped pens such as the Ornament-Feder by Brause or the
    Redis-Feder by Heintze & Blanckertz were used."

    Germany I believe that a lot of scientific writing was published in roman script,
    even while black letter still dominated elsewhere. So probably those technical
    and scientific captions would have been done in roman style, rather than fraktur,
    right?\r\n\r\nGiven that pencils go back to the 16th century, it is interesting
    that the thin monoline script never, it seems, became a model for printing. Perhaps
    they just don't work that well for the eye, at least in extended text. "
