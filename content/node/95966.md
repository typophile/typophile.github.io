  body: Do you want to set body text with the slab-serif? And which kind of slab do
    you mean? One with some stroke contrast and bracketed serifs (Clarendonish) or
    one with almost no stroke contrast and square, abrupt serifs (Rockwellish)?

    its italics are slightly wider than the uprights.\r\n\r\nI think Bitstream Vera
    is classified as a slabbie, hence so are its derivatives (like DejaVu).\r\n\r\nComputer

    wider? If you can make an Italic wider you can probably also make it uniwidth,
    which increases functionality (not to mention makes it less ugly).\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    body: "Hi oldnick, \r\n\r\nTo my eyes it's horrid, too curvy. It's quite feminine.
      Don't like the r, k, and g. It feels rather geometric. I also don't like the
      bilateral slabs. I suppose the feeling I'm after is mechanical. \r\n\r\nMaybe
      I should settle for  Grotesk, or a Neo-Grotesk Sans. I think I'm far too picky
      at times with slabs. I like Helvetica, but I really dislike the upper-case R
      in Helvetica, especially in italics. Akkidenz-Grotesk is pretty good. FF meta
      deserves a special mention for it's curves, very organic. \r\n\r\nI like Frutiger's
      r but not their a, and q. \r\n"

    body: "Old nick - Certainly I like women. However for I've been through a variety
      of Serifs. I have Adelle basic at the moment for a slab serif. It's pretty good.
      The shape of the bilateral slabs, I like a lot. The beak of c, and r are very
      nice indeed.\r\n\r\nI just wanted to get more variety.\r\n\r\nI prefer the grotesk
      types in sans because I am obsessed about the ear, link, and loops of the lower
      case g. Lastly call it snobbery, or you can call it Autism. \r\n\r\nThank you

    Haas took it upon themselves to refashion a more fashionable (and semi-ubiquitous,

    U.S. Supreme Court ruling, as is the typeface Century, of itself and under its
    Bitstream/Monotype variants?\r\n\r\nDoes the German equivalent of our Supreme

    maybe old news to you but I thought I\u2019d mention Museo has a \u201CMuseo Slab\u201D
    companion too that isn\u2019t quite as curvy. Shares the overall shapes of Museo
    though so probably not your cup of tea.\r\nI think you have a great one with Adelle.
    I can potentially think of a few more but they\u2019re all in the ~$40-per-style
    range. Does that qualify as \u201Ccheap\u201D for you?\r\nAlso, you might hate
    it, but I thought I\u2019d mention Bree Serif is free: http://www.type-together.com/index.php?action=portal/viewContent&cntId_content=2998&id_section=166"
