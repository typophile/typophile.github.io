  body: It is a great face based on Futura, <BR>it was cut in three weights &#43;
    slanted, condensd and shadow. <BR>If you wish &#40;Mr. Lauri Johnsen?&#41; I could
    post a scan later.

  body: I am not sure Mr. Miles Davis, sincerely, I would like to. <BR>It has pleasant
    differentiations, and the Uc are Roman Capital <BR>proportions based -- moreover,
    Futura is a text face, and I see <BR>more Futura than Gill Sans in Semplicita&#39;.

  body: I don&#39;t think it&#39;s based on any particular face such as Futura. <BR>You
    can see bits of Erbar, Bernhard Gothic, Kabel, etc., in it, plus some unique features.
    <BR>No Gill. <BR>There were a lot of &#34;mash-ups&#34; in that era, as different
    type designers from different foundries from different countries did their own
    version of the look du jour, the geometric sans. <BR> <BR>It would be like saying
    that all present day sans serif faces that are slightly squarish, semi-condensed
    and open-fitted, with a 4-letter name, are versions of Meta, forgetting other
    sources like Quay Sans, and the general lettering aesthetic of the day. <BR> <BR>

  body: "And now we have two \"interpretations\", one worse than the other, from Durotype
    and Canada Type.\r\nDon\u2019t know who was the \"someone reputable\" mentioned
    by Stephen, but I have been working very sporadically on a \"philological\" digital
    version for a few years, and I admit I am pretty disturbed by these bad quality
    \"hacks\", made without a care.\r\n\r\nIf you have to reinterpret and use something
    as a basis, Kris Sowersby\u2019s Karbon is a serious effort, not these.\r\n\r\nWhile
    I am at it, I just received FontShop's newsletter\r\nIn this statement:\r\n\xABAldo
    Novarese\u2019s work for the Nebiolo Foundry in the 1930s led to several types
    that were rigid and modernist, but always designed the Italian way, with the hand
    and human proportion in mind. One such was Neon, the model from which Canada Type\u2019s
    Patrick Griffin developed the Gala family.\xBB\r\nthere are more errors than words.
    Very professional. :)\r\n"

    never released their version because they couldn't get in touch with the rights
    holders or Novarese\u2019s estate.\r\n\r\n<blockquote>FontShop's newsletter</blockquote>\r\n\r\nI
    didn't write this newsletter (nor have I since August 2010), but I imagine the
    errors come from the writer relying on the foundry's description. Care to make
    some corrections? I'm sure FontShop would oblige."

  body: "In the 30\u2019s Aldo Novarese was in his teens. He had barely started at
    Nebiolo at the end of the 1930\u2019s, if I remember correctly. Maybe he\u2019s
    talking about Alessandro Butti instead? Neon is a design by Giulio Da Milano,
    it has nothing to do with Novarese.\r\n "

  body: "Antonio has already made the corrections.\r\nI add that Novarese never designed
    typefaces \"rigid and modernist\", and neither Butti, for what matters. The first
    efforts by Butti, dating from the 1920s, show a fascination with the sinuous forms
    of late-19th century letters, and he never designed anything \"rigid\".\r\n\r\nThe
    first works by Novarese should be the Etruria series, from 1939 onwards, if I
    recall correctly. Ah, Stephen, I hope if someone chooses the Canada Type \"reinterpretation\"
    of Semplicit\xE0, he will dig deep. I would not do it."

    quality hack\"? It took me and Bill Troop almost three years to finish that family.
    Reputable veteran type designers and art directors served as consultants on its
    development. We have received nothing but kudos from people who have licensed
    it.\r\n\r\nHelp me understand your perspective please."

  body: "It's not a quality issue, but one of interpretation.\r\nI suspect, by his
    use of the term \"philological\", that Claudio thinks that in updating the type
    (rather than producing an authentic revival) you have strayed too far from the
    original.\r\n"
