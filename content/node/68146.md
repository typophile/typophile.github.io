  an idea of the font or something close (if it's a modified font)?\r\n\r\nThanks,"

    old thread</a> than to start a new one on the same topic (yes, I see you did,
    without success). Ryuk now has spent time to locate links for Courtrai and Aeronaut,
    although they already have been posted in the other thread. <a href=\"http://typophile.com/forum/typeid/faq/#Q_9\">Rest
    assured we will have had a look at your sample</a>, even if there\u2019s no perfect
    answer yet. Not every letter is from a font. This might aswell be custom lettering.\r\nF"
