  a limited budget, I need to slowly expand my collection as my workload increases
  (and my wallet). I've been aquiring typefaces steadily (among those the ones I love
  and I urge you guys to buy are Alana from Laura Worthington, Gelato Script from
  Schizotype and Owned from Typodermic) and I do so when possible but that is not
  the case right now.\r\n\r\nSo, please enlighten me in this topic. <strong>Which
  free fonts do you consider completely indispensable? </strong>"

  body: "<em>How would you define decent level of quality?</em>\r\n\r\nWell, Andralexis
    obviously wants to use them for professional purposes. That means the recommendations
    should reflect this need. Ultimately that is something for the professionals here
    to decide, not for me. \r\n\r\nWith decent level of quality I would mean that
    the outlines are crafted with a certain skill and correctness concerning font-construction
    guidelines, that the letters are properly spaced and that there is some level
    of kerning. Further that the programming part of the font is done well, so that
    it works well in different programs and operating systems. Some free fonts have
    problems here. \r\n\r\nTo me personally Ingleby looks quite horrible, some letters
    are completely unbalanced, the a tips to the right, the c to the left, the e is
    horrible, the o is stressed to the wrong side, the q-serif is missing, the w too
    wide, the x crossbar is mirrored, etc...\r\n\r\n\r\nHere is a comparison to Minion:\r\n<img

  body: "> <cite>I thought Adobe gave it away with their software\u2026</cite>\r\n\r\nIt
    is true (at least on the Macintosh)  that MinionPro comes with the Adobe Reader,
    which is itself free. The font is however not installed systemwise, it stays inside
    the application, and I have no idea for what use. I strongly doubt the eula would
    allow you to install it systemwise.\r\n\r\nIf you look at the README file for
    the <a href=\"http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/fonts/minionpro\"><strong>LaTeX
    Minion Pro Package</strong></a>, you can read<code>\r\n---\r\nFiles\r\n[...]\r\no
    002.000: This version is included in recent Acrobat Reader\r\n           installations
    and is currently for sale.\r\n---\r\n</code>What do you make out of such a last
    statement? (Is it possible that older versions of the reader had a eula that would
    not have forbidden the installation?)"

  body: "Hmm. I'm a late arrival. To answer the question, I don't find any font completely
    indispensable. Actually, I don't find any font to be partially indispensable.\r\n\r\nI'd
    assume that as a designer, you've purchased InDesign, which comes with a lot of
    fonts. So, I suppose that you're looking for fonts not used by other people, for
    a sort of \"self-branding\" purpose? The free font world is populated by some
    giveaways from larger families, which might work for advertising. The open source
    world still has a lot of dogs, but careful prowling will turn up promising fonts,
    and a few real gems. That's where a font editing program is useful. \r\n\r\nIn
    my word -- books -- useful is far more important than new, which lets judicious
    purchases go a long way. I understand that it is a world many find boring, and
    not terribly profitable. Again, I'd prowl fontsquirrel, dafont, and the TeX font
    resources. Open source fonts and FontLab Studio will teach you a lot, as well
    as expand your font library.\r\n\r\nTry Lato, BTW. http://typophile.com/node/77283\r\n\r\nAnd
    look at the League of Moveable type. I don't find the Goudy clones too useful,
    but while he lacked a sense of space, Goudy was a good man with a curve. Some
    of these \"based ons\" might work for you.\r\n\r\nActually, just Google \"open
    source fonts\" and spend a couple days going to the sites. \r\n\r\nFWIW"

  body: "One doesn't need to go that far and compare Ingleby with Minion. Just take
    [[http://www.aldusleaf.org|Crimson Text]] for example, which is still under development,
    but already superior to the odd flavor of Ingleby. Or [[http://www.linuxlibertine.org/|Linux
    Libertine]] \u2013 another open source font. Just type words like \u201Ecoequating\u201C,
    \u201Crecognizeable\u201D or \u201Cconcept\u201D... Anyhow that is just my personal
    opinion. \r\n\r\nConcerning Minion and the Adobe Reader, it seems like the software
    doesn't give a licence to use the font. The Eula says that a licence to use the
    software (and fonts) is issued only for the ways of use and purposes described
    in the documentation (help, online Adobe docs, etc\u2026). Since there is no word
    in the documentation of how to install Minion, it seems that the Eula forbids
    it. (However it is another question, if the Eula is applicable in every country.)"
