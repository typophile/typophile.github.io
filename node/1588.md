  body: It&#39;s very close to Times, but that&#39;s not it exactly. Could be some
    other version of Times, but the two sticking points are the descending J and what
    looks like parallel serifs on the T. <BR> <BR>However, whatever font it is, it&#39;s
    a slanted Roman, not a true italic. And it is stretched, too. So I&#39;d be surprised
    if it&#39;s anything too far from Times.

    lurking about. <BR> <BR>Good to see Henry Winkler back on board, Isaac. If&#39;n
    you want to grab some vittles later this week, fire me an email hoss.
