body: I can't identify the san serif font in the attachment and I'm on a pretty tight
  deadline.  I've tired fonts that appeared similar at first glance such as Avenir,
  Frutiger and Frankin Gothic but they were all slightly different when I took a closer
  look upon comparison.  Can anyone help?!
