body: "Hi, \r\n\r\nFirst post and looking to identify a font. I have a sneaky feeling
  it's a custom font made by the designer. \r\n\r\nThe font is used on all these wedding
  invites and cards: \r\nhttp://birdandbanner.com/french-flea-market/\r\n\r\nPlease
  take note of the \"JK\" and \"JP\" \r\n\r\nThank you very much "
