  before so thought I'd try again!\r\n\r\nI need to know what typeface is used on
  <a href=\"http://www.artifice-design.co.uk/changeyourlife.jpg\">this book</a>.\r\n\r\nMy
  client is a literaray-agent and they want me to mock-up a special one-off version
  of this book cover as a leaving present for someone! So, I need to retitle it and
  obviously want to use the original font if possible.\r\n\r\nAny help is much appreciated
  as always,\r\n\r\nArtifice"

    are actually Adobe Sans, which means the intended font wasn't embedded properly.
    The Helvetica Bold Condensed suggests that the other lines were supposed to be
    the same face in a lighter weight.\r\n\r\nMy collection of Adobe Sans grows every
    day. "

  body: "You're right, Erik. It's strange that the cover designer would embed all
    the fonts except that one.\r\n\r\nI suppose the original poster should set the
    text in a lighter weight of Helvetica condensed but not embed it to replicate
    the cover exactly.\r\n\r\n - Lex"
