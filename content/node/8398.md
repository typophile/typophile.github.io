body: Hi - trying to figure out what font has such a pronounced tail on the t - almost
  like a sans serif clarendon. <BR> <BR>The sample is from an ADC mailer and shows
  a piece that won an ADC silver in &#39;84... <BR> <BR>thanks for your time...<img

    not an exact match. <BR> <BR><a href="http://houseind.com/house.php?kit=HG23FONT-FO&amp;sub=view"

  body: The old Phil&#39;s Photo book shows Jay Gothic with an alternate &#39;t&#39;
    that is a lot like this, but the typeface itself is more square than this sample.  <BR>
    <BR>You could also do some editing to <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/eurostile/demi/testdrive.html?s=Print&amp;p=48"
    target="_blank">Eurostile</a> outlines and get fairly close. <BR> <BR>I think
    Patricia is right -- it looks like the old Print magazine logo, and it is probably
    custom.
