body: "OK, after too long sketching and thinking about this, I finally got Karen Cheng's
  book \"Designing Type\" a while back, and then had a coronary when I realised exactly
  how involved it is to actually digitise letterforms. After working as a small-time
  designer for several years, I recently realised that I'm addicted to type - but
  didn't truly appreciate the craft of type design.\r\n\r\nAnyway - long story short,
  I have spent the last few days in drawing some letterforms and already (having printed
  them out at various sizes) need some feedback (e.g. give it up, and stick to your
  day job Steve).\r\n\r\nMy intent is to produce a reasonably tight design, that would
  be useful for display, headings, and short runs of body text. I have always leaned
  towards sans type in my design work, so want to produce a serif that is clean, with
  serifs that are quite deep, yet slim, producing something that looks more geometrical
  without being distractingly so.\r\n\r\nThanks for any feedback.\r\n\r\nSteve\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Steve, thanks for the bump, I was meaning to comment but forgot. \r\n(Please
    remember the salt; you know I'm just a beginner at this.)\r\n\r\nThe serif shape
    on this reminds me a lot of an initial design one girl in my type design class
    proposed. The advice she was given by our teachers \u2013 which may also apply
    here \u2013 is that with small and thick serifs like that,* you can't go very
    small before they stop looking like serifs, and start looking like strangely clogging
    terminals (did you notice any of that when checking it at different sizes?). That
    shouldn't really be an issue for display though I guess. \r\n* In fact, hers were
    even shorter and thicker IIRC, so there may not be too much of that danger here.\r\n\r\nAlso,
    I'm wondering if the \"a\" is wide compared to the \"h\" and \"n\"; it may help
    to do an \"o\" first to get a sound concept of the width proportions of the straighter
    and rounder forms. (And/or to look at manymany other fonts & compare how they
    handle the proportions.)\r\n\r\nPlease do not give up! I think it looks really
    interesting, and I'll be curious to see how this progresses. "

  body: "Thanks peeps... Believe me, I'm having a real confidence crisis (must be
    turning 40 that does it)... Waiting with baited breath for the brickbats to come,
    so I was encouraged by your comments. I've been working on my handgloves today,
    but really want to get the e and s finished before I post it up again, as it looks
    a bit odd with the v on the end. The g was really fun!\r\n\r\nThanks for the comments
    on the widths. I was really trying to maintain colour, but the a was a bit wide,
    you're right. This has now been sorted, along with several other changes. When
    I mentioned to a friend today that I was really excited about designing a typeface,
    you can imagine the reaction. Hopefully this means I'm now a typophile :)\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    better. Keep going (and I'll keep going, too!).

  body: The bowl of a looks so square compared to the humps of h and n - I'll be interested
    to see which direction the other letters go. It will also be worth watching if
    the one-sided serifs result in a nice tight interlock, or whether the interletter
    space becomes distracting.

  body: "I have to smile... it's like quicksand. The further you go into it, the more
    of a predicament you can find yourself in! I hope the 70's connotations aren't
    along the lines of Boogie Nights! I've been looking at this too long today, and
    have lost the plot a bit... I can see the s is too expanded, and the v trailing
    diagonal is too light, but thought I would just put it here for a while and see
    what I think about it in a day or so when my eyes have relaxed.\r\n\r\nThis is
    really a book cut I guess, but perhaps the shapes add more (too much?) personality
    at larger sizes.\r\n\r\nAt smaller sizes, the hump of the n, h etc should mellow
    out optically making it appear more square at text sizes, which is why I haven't
    added any traps in the arch/ascender joints.\r\n\r\nSteve\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/dawn_6701.png]"

  body: "This is looking good. My comments are all on how the letters work with each
    other (i.e. some elements in some of the letters make them feel like they're not
    necessarily part of the same typeface).\r\n\r\n\u2022 The \"s\" -- maybe the top
    and bottom should be rounded a little more. I think the s might be a little wide.\r\n\r\n\u2022
    the curves in the d where the bowl meets the stem seem out of place with the curves
    in the other letters\r\n\r\n\u2022\_the curve in the n is nicer than the curve
    in the h"

  body: "Jonathan, thanks for your comments - really just confirming niggles that
    I already had. I have completely redrawn the bowl and counter of the d, as this
    was actually traced from my initial sketches, and somehow I just hadn't captured
    the curves the way I wanted. The trailing diagonal of the v has been beefed up,
    the s smoothed out, slimmed down, and reduced contrast, and the curves on the
    h bought into line with those on the n... Hopefully this is more pleasing overall
    - I wanted to get these characters more or less right before I compounded my problems
    by drawing the rest of the alphabet!\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/dawnbook_6309.jpg]"

  body: "Hi Steve, this could turn out quite interesting I think, definitely worth
    keeping going with it. The g is fun.\r\n\r\nI think there are elements slightly
    fighting each other. You have a soft round terminal on the tail of the g, but
    square ones on e and s. Your h and n are quite round on the arch, but the a seems
    a bit flattened off. Once you decide which parts to harmonise, drawing the other
    letters should be a bit easier. I wonder if you might make the horizontal serifs
    a little shallower? I think the thin stroke on v is still too thin, next to that
    o. s might be better with the northwestern curve taken in a bit. g might be a
    bit light?\r\n\r\nHope that's a bit helpful :)\r\n"
