  body: "It's so familar, but I just can't come up with a name (and the sample is
    too low res to produce any good hits on Whatfontis or Whatthefont).\r\n\r\nThought
    it might be by Jean Francois Porchez (Typofondrie), but haven't found a match
    yet."

  body: Sharper and higher res would be good - like Kevin said this looks like something
    we should get easily.

  body: "This type of letter is called a semi or demi-serif. Searches at Myfonts using
    these terms produced similar fonts but no match.\r\nSemi-serif fonts are easily
    made by playing the game of \"snip the serif\" with existing fonts. Fashionable
    10 to 20 years ago.\r\nBTW, the zero is unique.\r\nAs Kevin says, perhaps something
    by Jean Francois Porchez.\r\nBackground looks like a cheque or bond. Bespoke font
    for a financial institution? Was there a corporate name with the sample you posted?\r\nDon"
