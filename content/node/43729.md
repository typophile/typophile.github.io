body: "hello everyone\r\n\r\nI was asked to estimate a price for a custom font, for
  corporate use and would like to have a closer idea of a possible price table (if
  there is such) for a custom font.\r\nCan anyone light me on this.\r\nhow much would
  you charge for a three weight sans (no italics) western/roman default encoding?\r\n\r\nI
  know this can be a sensible question, I'm not asking for a rigorous budget estimate:),
  just need have an idea on it, since I haven't got a clue.\r\n\r\nThanks in advanced."

  body: "You could start by inquiring about corporate licensing for three fonts from
    a number of font vendors. Most likely you would get prices ranging from high 4
    figures to mid 5 figures per font (and sometimes more!). If this is the price
    your client would have to pay to license an off-the-shelf font for corporate use,
    you can figure out how much more to charge for a unique custom solution with similar
    licensing.\r\n\r\nCustom work is not cheap. Corporate licensing is not cheap.\r\n\r\nDo
    not give your work away."
