    should be avoided, but overlapping of components is okay.

  body: "@hrant - Components mean that the glyph outlines aren't defined in that character
    position, but are created by referring to other positions.  If you 'decompose'
    such a glyph, the outlines are now in their character's position. For example,
    the O-slash position could have pointers to the 'O' and the 'Slash' (component)
    or it could have the outlines right there (decomposed). There's a slight saving
    in file size using components; I believe that they must be decomposed before creating
    an open type font.\r\n\r\nNow why rendering agents should display them differently,
    I have no idea. Possibly something to do with the rendering sequence, or outline
    directions,  or conflicting hinting, or ... or ...\r\n\r\n- Herb "

  body: "Got it. But why ever leave overlapping outlines in the position? For one
    thing they take up <em>more</em> room than the overlap-removed one. So I assume
    Yanone is talking about referred components.\r\n\r\nAlso:\r\n- I assume the rendering
    varies because for referred components each glyph is rasterized individually,
    then the bitmaps are merged. If so, that means it's slower than rendering a single
    outline-merged glyph. So you're trading rendering speed for download speed.\r\n-
    Component referral only saves space if you use a component enough times (which
    might be as low as three, or even two, depending). For something like the cedilla
    there's probably no contest, but for the slash, I wonder.\r\n- A problem with
    referred components -especially overlapping ones, and in darker weights- is that
    there's no opportunity for modulation. For example the lower curve of the /C/c
    should get thinner when a cedilla is attached. Then there's the ogonek, which
    likes to affect the base glyph bigtime...\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    parts of a component are rendered to bitmaps separately and then the bitmaps are
    combined. Overlapping bitmaps are not a problem. Overlapping contours require
    the rendering to figure out the overlap and present a bitmap.\r\n\r\n\"For one

    a landscape oriented rectangle and a portrait oriented rectangle overlap and use

    at Adobe, where they make CoolType, that I both saw it and was taught about it
    being a problem. That was why they never allowed overlapping outlines in their
    western fonts.\r\n\r\nOf course it is unavoidable for connected fonts, whether
    they are Arabic, Indic, or western connected script fonts. But that doesn't mean
    it shouldn't be avoided where practical."

    taught about overlapping TT at Adobe?\r\n\r\nThe TT spec allows overlapping contours
    and components from 1.0, and the only experience I've had where that didn't render
    properly was corrected by Apple in their iOS about two years ago, partly, I was
    told, because there isn't any software on the web that renders \"western fonts\"
    differently from \"eastern fonts\", and Apple has a lot of eastern fonts that
    follow the TT spec.\r\n\r\nBesides all that, last time I tried to stroke and fill
    a live font on the web, the support was so inconsistent, forgetting about the
    overlap issue, that I had to include SVG and graphics to make my presentation
    show up on all browsers. \r\n"
