  been trying to find this typeface forever &mdash; already tried <em>Identifont</em>
  and <em>WhatTheFont</em> with no joy&hellip; Anyone have any ideas?"

  body: "Hi Pieter. Thanks for the quick reply.\r\n\r\nThe flipped letter idea never
    even crossed my mind, but now you&rsquo;ve pointed it out, it seems obvious! I&rsquo;ve
    added an image of the 'darker' text, which supports your idea further.\r\n\r\nAny
    idea what the font might be, prior to &lsquo;flipping operations&rsquo;?"
