body: Good day. <BR> <BR>I have attached my two new fonts, each with a variation.
  The first is Intimacy, based off of handwriting samples &amp; writing to another
  slowly &amp; creating a closness between reader &amp; writer. The second is Urgency,
  based off fast paced daily life &amp; the need to get information across quickly.
  Please let me know which characters are working &amp; which are not. Thank you.

  body: I think the Urgency cut is a lacking some intimacy.  :-&#41; <BR> <BR>For
    example if the Intimacy cut has a monocular &#34;a&#34;, probably the Urgency
    shouldn&#39;t have a binocular one. And generally, quicker writing is <i>more</i>
    fluid, not less. <BR> <BR>You might consider just swapping their &#34;slantedness&#34;.

  body: For me, &#34;intimacy&#34; seems more urgent, and the &#34;urgency&#34; seems
    more intimate. Why? Because if you are in a hurry, you probably won&#39;t take
    the time to draw out the details. And I also think that &#34;urgency&#34; should
    be slanted. Very fun however.

  body: 'Hrant, Tiffany: urgency doesn&#39;t imply hurried. I think think what Jessica
    is getting at with &#39;Urgency&#39; is the need to clearly and carefully letter
    important information. These designs reminded me of the notes my mother used to
    leave for me: not in their style, but because Very Important Information was always
    written very carefully in neatly formed, generously proportioned &#39;printing&#39;,
    while the stuff around it was in her normal writing.'
