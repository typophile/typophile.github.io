  (for the book cover battle and for future friendship perhaps) and came up empty.
  Then this came up as the illustration for a blog article in my RSS feed. Could someone
  tell me what it is?\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/monospace_type_id_4932.jpg]\r\n\r\nIncidentally,
  I really dislike it when people create fully-typographic images and then don't mention
  what typeface it is in the notes!\r\n\r\nThanks in advance,\r\n\r\nAndi\r\n\r\n[<a

  body: "Thanks guys - it never ceases to amaze me how good people here are at IDs.\r\n\r\nAutoscape
    is definitely a keeper, too - as a refugee from the 90s, I could always do with
    a slick monospace :) Probably couldn't have justified the cost for the type battle
    though, but it's definitely coming out of my Christmas pay!\r\n\r\nThanks again,\r\n\r\nAndi\r\n\r\n[<a
