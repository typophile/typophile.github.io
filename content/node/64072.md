  offer walks in the ruhr area in Germany. During these walks you can learn something
  about typography. We have taken lots of photos and now we need lots of information
  about the fonts on our photos. Of course, we are both interested in the name of
  the font and in little stories around it. \r\nJust visit our flickr-group \u201CRoute
  Schriftkultur\u201C and note information under our photos. We will change the photos
  when we have enough information because we have more photos than we can show on
  flickr.\r\nThank you very much!\r\nhttp://www.flickr.com/groups/1239436@N24/\r\n"
