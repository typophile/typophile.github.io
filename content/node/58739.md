body: does anybody know if there are courses that give you a basic knowledge in graphic
  design and typography to help prepare a portfolio to present in a design school.
  I would need courses from august to december, anywhere in europe.

  body: I don't know  of any classes specifically but I'm sure a simple google search
    could get you started or, better yet, get in touch with your prospective schools
    and ask what they would recommend.

  body: "FWIW, in Germany that seems to be quite common; a bunch of design schools
    offer such courses themselves (which are mostly rumored to make it easier to get
    into that specific school). In German, the word is <em>Mappenvorbereitungskurs</em>
    (portfolio preparation course).\r\n\r\nAnother thing to look out for is that many
    design schools (again, specifically in Germany, dunno how it is in other countries)
    have something like \"portfolio days\", the idea being that prospective students
    can bring in their portfolios and have them critiqued by some professors of the
    school, who would then give specific advice if they'd consider accepting it or
    not, and if not, what you can do to make it better (i.e. increase your chances).\r\nThese
    sessions can be anything from very helpful and constructive to shattering, but
    of course that also tells you something about the school at hand, and teaches
    you to not flip out if they act all important. ;-)\r\n\r\nGood luck."
