  of Polish [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitution_of_May_3,_1791|Constitution
  of May 3]].\r\nI would like to make the arabic version which has some \"revolutionary\",
  \"enlightment\", \"modern\" flavour. I don't want to repeat any Bodoni or Didot
  forms - rather to find (as a base for further thinking) something originally grown
  in Osman empire, historically coincident (1790-1848). \r\nOur [[http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Belarusian_al_kitab_marked.jpg|native
  tradition]] is not the best starting point as it is a rural script.\r\nCould you
  advice some search paths?\r\n\r\nThanks in advance."

  body: "Take a look at this historical oddity:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/bickham-arabic-small_6167.jpg]\r\n\r\nThis
    is a rare example of an attempt to write Arabic using the pointed, split nib steel
    pen that was the predominent writing implement of Europe from the mid-17th Century
    onwards (and which directly influenced the styles of type of the Romantic period
    in which you are interested). Arabic, like European scripts before this time,
    has mainly been written with a broad nib (traditionally a reed pen), and all the
    major styles of Arabic writing have been based on this tool.\r\n\r\nNow, the example
    shown above -- from an engraved plate dated 1741 at the end of George Bickham's
    <em>The Universal Penman</em>, showing \u2018the oriental languages\u2019 -- has
    numerous problems and almost certainly was written by someone who did not know
    Arabic, but it is interesting nonetheless. It represents a genuine if faulty attempt
    to write something like the naskh style of Arabic using a new tool, and just because
    it hasn't really worked doesn't mean that it couldn't be made to work. Every time
    I look at this, I'm struck that there might just be a typeface in here somewhere.
    To pull this off, you would need to understand two things very well: the grammar
    of the naskh style, and the characteristics of the split nib.\r\n\r\nThis image
    also has an interesting if unclear history. Bickham's plate is dated 1741, which
    is when it was engraved and printed, but the actual writing on which it was based
    predates it by at least almost a century, appearing in Louis Barbedor's <em>Les
    Ecritures financiere</em> (Paris, 1647). Bickham's version is the better engraving,
    as to be expected from such a master, and he has rendered the forms more smoothly,
    but the content and even the size is identical. I've no idea whether Barbedor
    wrote the original himself, or if he too copied it from somewhere else. The 17th
    and 18th Centuries were periods of intense exchange of knowledge and ideas, not
    all of them properly credited."

    you, John - this is exactly the kind of thing I needed!\r\n\r\nSpacing and letterform
    mistakes aren't important here (some parts look like latin handwritting, don't
    they?). But it's the hand of crafted penman, his hard tool and its high contrast
    producing crisp details, what makes the example very useful for me. Thank you.\r\n\r\n"
