  using font instead of 'caption' is acceptable in the world of TV news? \r\n\r\n\"Mr.
  Rather requests that his <strong>font</strong> not associate him with CBS News.
  So no 'Former CBS Anchor.' We thank you and Dan thanks you.\"\r\n\r\nhttp://www.contactmusic.com/news.nsf/article/now%20rather%20boots%20cbs_1002051\r\n\r\nSi

    industry for the subtitles or IDs, based on the fact that they were created with
    font capabilities of the graphics tools used by tv stations.
