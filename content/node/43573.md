  mean. I get the feeling that it is extremely similar to Flareserif 821 BT, but not
  the exact one, as I appreciate very slight differences (for example, in this credits
  sequence, the upper-case J is on the baseline, in Flareserif 821 BT it extends below
  the baseline). Thanks in advance.'

    The original metal version of Albertus Bold had a J like that.
