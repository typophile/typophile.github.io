    Gothic Extra Condensed</a>, with the A.G. Condensed R? (Since that's the only
    letter that doesn't match). Or conversely, A.G. Condensed with the S from Block
    Gothic Extra Condensed?\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

    one -- those are <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=catalog.fontdetail&displayfontid=M.103092.0.4&attributes.sampleSize=32&sampleText=REINCARNATION&sampleSize=32\">Monotype

    as well. Which makes sense, because the Gloss & Matte line is set in <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=catalog.fontdetail&displayfontid=M.103092.0.5&attributes.sampleSize=32&sampleText=GLOSS+%26+MATTE&sampleSize=24\">Monotype

    Monotype Grotesque series. De-frickin'-licious."
