  only am I exceedingly impressed with this font family, or rather, full type system,
  but I also received a lovely letterpress broadside in the mail. \r\n\r\nAll in all
  it was an excellent customer experience. Among other things, I had a question and
  it was answered promptly by Mr. Jamra himself. Their prices are quite reasonable,
  too.\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\nChristian."

    for many years. He's a meticulous craftsman, a dedicated teacher, and an all-around
    good guy. I'm glad you got to experience some of this for yourself.\r\n\r\n"
