  body: Jonathan Hoefler did an ambitious revival of the Didot types for <I>Harper&#39;s
    Bazaar</I>. He also published an excellent specimen for HTF Didot which provides
    a good deal of historical information about the neoclassical style. You might
    try contacting Jonathan at <A HREF="http://www.typography.com" TARGET="_blank">
    Hoefler Type Foundry</A> and see if he still has any copies of his <I>Muse no.
    1</I> Didot specimen available. <BR> <BR>-- Kent.
