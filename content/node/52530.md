  pretty baffled.\r\n\r\nLong story short, I work for an American company in the UK.
  I get and back-up work to a US based server. All of my fonts are owned by the company
  in the US and emailed over / downloaded from the States, so are the same fonts used
  by my American colleagues.\r\n\r\nWe're all running CS4 on OS 10.4 or later.\r\n\r\nNow,
  here's the catch: when I open a document in InDesign from the American server, the
  fonts (normally Helvetica Neue or Gotham, both OTF) are appearing as the same font
  but as a T1 version, which means that I have to convert all the fonts back to OTF
  even though technically they should already be the same. We've had this issue in
  all of the Creative Suite as well as opening them up on PC here in the UK as well,
  and it seems to happen in any document, no matter what version of CS it was created
  in.\r\n\r\nI'm running out of ideas now and although it's not a major problem converting
  the fonts, it is a little annoying and certainly adds to potential for a cock-up
  somewhere down the line.\r\n\r\nAll advice or ideas welcome, many thanks!\r\n\r\n "

    (which is already somewhat dubious, licensing wise), and they automatically change
    from OTF to T1? \r\n\r\nThat's impossible."

  body: "This title is misleading...I was hoping for something more interesting. The
    problem probably somehow relates to the company using both versions of the same
    fonts. You can always use features like File > Package... to see what fonts the
    document is using as well as collecting them out. \r\n\r\nMore importantly, do
    Britons think that Tobias Frere-Jones' Interstate should be called Dual Carriageway?
    Come to think of it, what font do UK highway signs use...? Gill Sans? I suppose
    I could look it up..."

  body: "<strong>\"That\u2019s impossible.\"</strong>\r\n\r\nThat's what I thought,
    but apparently it's not.\r\n\r\nI can only conclude that the program is reading
    the original fonts as T1 which seems very, very odd, but still doesn't really
    help me.\r\n\r\nBut outside it being impossible, do you have any constructive
    suggestions or ideas?\r\n\r\ncanderson: Many thanks. I've delved a little further
    and it seems that the font type isn't actually recognised, but it would seem to
    be defaulting to naming it (T1) in the type palette. \r\n\r\nThis may be of interest:

    think that 'Dual Carriageway' has quite the same romantic connotations... ;-)"

  body: This is what happens when we start monkeying around with our fonts. ;^) I
    would email the foundries from whom you licensed the fonts and ask for their help.
