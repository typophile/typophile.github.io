  body: "Thanks Ryuk. \r\n\r\nYour Suggestion is always spot on. This is matching
    upto 92% only problem is that \"the letter \"\" t \"\" is different\". \r\n\r\nI
    have looked at Gill Sans, Stag Sans, Gill Sans MT but no luck. \r\n\r\nalso you
    can visit \"[[http://www.southernductworkservices.co.uk/]]\"  \r\n\r\nto help
    further. \r\n\r\nThanks Again."

    I don't see any difference with Albertus, /t included. \r\nBut if it matches up
    to 92%, that should let you only 8% to tweak ;)"

  body: Seconding Ryuk's choice of Albertus. However - the logo you've shown us, Hasnain,
    is <em>not</em> the same as the logo at the link you gave. Different fonts. So
    ... which are you after?

  body: "That's what is giving to me by customer. \r\n\r\nNow I am scratching my head
    too. \r\n\r\nCan you advice the second font and I see how the things go, otherwise
    I will use the font which matches exactly, and rest will be adjusted manually
    on the machine. \r\n\r\nand thanks for putting your time into this. \r\n\r\nRyuk:
    not offended at all by your comment. I find you the most honest in that case,
    Thanks. \r\n\r\nThanks\r\nRegards,\r\nHash"
