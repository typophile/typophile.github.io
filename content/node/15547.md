  figure out how to get them to actually work.\r\nAlso (and I am sure that it is an
  obvious question) I can't get the 'smart quotes' to work in the typeface either.\r\nNobody
  wants to see inch marks in place of proper quotes do they?\r\n\r\nI would appreciate
  any help that anyone has."

  body: "There was a discussion here a while back about the idea of using OpenType
    to do smart quotes. The consensus was that it would be a bad idea; that it should
    be left to the application to do. There was a good reason, but I can't quite remember
    what it was.\r\n\r\nDoing alternate ampersands is easy. Create your normal ampersand
    in the normal ampersand slot. Then create your alternate ampersands, naming them
    ampersand.alt1, ampersand.alt2, etc. (The alternates do not need Unicode values
    assigned, but you may use PUA codes if you want programs like MS Word for Windows
    that don't yet support alternates to be able to access them.)\r\n\r\nCreate a
    \"salt\" feature defined thusly:\r\n\r\nfeature salt {\r\n  sub ampersand by ampersand.alt1
    ;\r\n} salt;\r\n\r\nThen create stylistic sets like this:\r\n\r\nfeature ss01
    {\r\n  sub ampersand by ampersand.alt1 ;\r\n} ss01;\r\n\r\nfeature ss02 {\r\n
    \ sub ampersand by ampersand.alt2 ;\r\n} ss02;\r\n\r\netc., for however many alternate
    ampersands you have. \r\n\r\nThe \"salt\" feature is the default alternate for
    programs that don't support more than one alternate. The \"ss0x\" features are
    for programs that support \"stylistic sets\". You will see all of them in programs
    with glyph or character palettes. In Adobe apps, they will also show up together
    in a pop-up under the ampersand in the Glyph Palette."
