  stuff I perused this morning that seems kind of close, but not:\r\n\r\nBauhaus\r\nBernard
  MT Condensed\r\nEurostile\r\nFutura Condensed Medium\r\nHaettenshweiler\r\nHiragino
  Kaku Gothic Std\r\n-Impact\r\n-Poplar Std\r\n-Univers\r\n-Kozuka Gothic Std (H)\r\n\r\n[-]
  are the most similar so far.  The Univers I've got on the system isn't that large
  of a collection, so maybe there is a variant."

    is not far off. The cent sign is the most different, but I can't think of a font
    with one quite like that."
