  body: Considering that the boats cost $1.5 million each, I'd venture to say that

  body: Thanks. You're probably right. Shame. It's awesome, but I guess it needs to
    be with that price-tag! I've searched loads of retro fonts, but this just has
    something about it...anyone seen anything similar?
