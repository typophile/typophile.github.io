body: I have attempted to turn on SmallCaps in InDesign CS, running on WinXP. Works
  find with Western typefaces. For Cyrillic, &#40;i.e. Adobe&#39;s Open Type Warnock
  Pro, Palatino Linotype or Minion&#41;, it only will small cap the latin text and
  not the Russian. The only font that seems to work properly for both is Lucida San
  Unicode. <BR> <BR>I know, I know., Russian is usually not small capped, but I need
  it to match the Latin heading.

  body: The &#39;smcp&#39; feature most likely does not include the Cyrillic characters
    in the font you&#39;re using. That is to say, the font is working the way it was
    built to work, with no feature for Cyrillic small caps &#40;or glyphs to support
    it, for that matter&#41;. <BR> <BR>Alan

  body: Alan is correct, the fonts to which you refer do not contain Cyrillic smallcap
    glyphs. However, because they do contain an &#60;smcp&#62; feature, InDesign will
    not apply fake smallcaps. InDesign will only apply fake smallcaps if the font
    contains no OpenType feature for smallcaps, regardless of whether particular characters
    are convered in that feature. <BR> <BR>There are relatively few Cyrillic fonts
    with proper smallcaps. I know of several in development, but only a handful from
    Paratype &#40;non-OT, last I checked their catalogue&#41; that are currently shipping.
    My take on this is that if a font contains any smallcaps it should contain appropriate
    smallcaps for all the characters supported, but obviously Adobe have decided to
    spend their resources in other ways.

  body: Okay, that sucks.  If ID can&#39;t find glyphs for the small caps being made
    it should fake them. <BR> <BR>Though, truthfully, since ID won&#39;t let you faux
    italic and bold, etc, without going through hoops, it shouldn&#39;t let you do
    it with small caps either.  Something I realise when I small capped Myriad and
    realised it looked wrong. <BR> <BR>Can someone explain why Myriad doesn&#39;t
    have small caps?

  body: Cyrillic miniscules are already functionally small caps anyway.  I&#39;m thinking
    that u, ye, f, a, r, and b &#40;this forum doesn&#39;t seem to support Cyrillic
    characters&#41; are the only ones that aren&#39;t already small caps. Do the standard
    miniscules not match the Latin small caps in some way?

    <BR>No, they are not <i>functionally</i> smallcaps: many of them are &#60;i&#62;visually&#60;/i&#62;
    similar to small versions of the capital letters in upright style &#40;not in
    cursive italics&#41;, but there is a typographic function for actual smallcaps
    in Cyrillic text just as there is in Latin text, e.g. acronyms, running heads,
    etc. The typical difference between Cyrillic smallcaps and Latin ones is that
    the former tend to be slightly taller, in order to distinguish them more clearly
    from the similar lowercase letters, whose proportions also differ. This is something
    to be kept in mind when designing fonts that combine support for multiple scripts.
    <BR> <BR>A few years ago I was commissioned to design a set of Cyrillic smallcaps
    for Minion Cyrillic for a publisher who needed them for a book that included some
    words that always appeared in all-caps. See attached PDF. <BR><!--attachment:

  body: Yes, I got permission from Adobe, and also ensured that the client had appropriate
    licences for Minion to cover the installation of the custom fonts. Arguably, if
    I had drawn the Cyrillic smallcaps from scratch and had not used any Adobe data,
    I wouldn&#39;t have needed permission, but it&#39;s only polite to ask and Adobe
    have been very good about granting such permission so long as the licensing is
    properly arranged.

    sure the &#34;lesser craftsmen&#34; grovel for permission with breakfast, lunch
