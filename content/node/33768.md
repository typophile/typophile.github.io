  face used for the Nandos fast food franchise here in Australasia; a student put
  it in front of me last week and I confess I'm stumped. Please see the example below.\r\nThanks
  in advance for the i.d. or any suggestions you might have for what to use in its
  place.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Nandos_5995.jpg]"
