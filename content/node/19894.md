body: "Hi typophiles,\r\n\r\nI am in the organizing committee of the Dutch Indoorrowing
  Championships (in Dutch: NK Indoorroeien). For those who have never heard of indoorrowing,
  please don't laugh. Since the beginning of the event 16 years ago, the number of
  participating sporters has grown every year (1400 last edition). The event takes
  place in December in Amsterdam.\r\n\r\nAt the moment a friend and I are redesigning
  the house style of the event. This also means designing a new logo. The current
  logo exists of the word \"NK Indoorroeien\" set in Helvetica Neue. I think this
  logo is poorly outdated and doesn't fit the event (anymore). \r\n\r\nI know how
  hard it is to design a good logo. We have been busy drawing for a long time now
  and it's time to make some final decisions. We decided that the logo will exist
  of an abstract drawing of a rower and the word \"NK Indoorroeien\". I need your
  opinion on the last part, the word \"NK Indoorroeien\", which is a tough word to
  deal with. First of all the word is quite long. Second, there seems to be a problem
  with the two r's, because each r belongs to another part of the word.\r\n\r\nThe
  keywords for the event are: professional, dynamic, fun. My last thought was to keep
  the idea of the old logo, but to use a different font. I tried a lot of different
  fonts, but I really liked John Sans, because it is both tight and friendly. I really
  like the endings of the \"K\" and \"r\". It is almost like a splash of water.\r\n\r\nWhat
  do you think?"

    split up the words, you might need to kern the lighter one a bit tighter. However
    without the accompanying illustration it's hard to guess if the logo as a whole
    is going to work. You could explore using two colours or tints to break the words,
    would it be wrong to break it into two lines with indoor and roeien aligning on
    the left with NK outside the alignment.\r\n<strong>NK</strong> indoor\r\n<strong>NK</strong>
    <strong>roeien</strong>\r\nThe second NK is just to align the two words, I tried
    word spaces but they seem not to be permitted.\r\n\r\nTim"

    it would look like a boat with ors coming out of it. Like what you have done so
    far though. '

    if they work. It's always good to have input from people with some design knowledge.
    I'll post the final logo when ready..."
