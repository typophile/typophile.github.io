    work.\r\n\r\nAnd on another note, the <em>fi</em> in the thread title is kind
    of annoying me."

    fi in the title is indeed looking horrible (especially for a site dedicated to
    type)."

  body: "Nice job on working the \"o\" into other letters. I've seem some ambigrams
    go real south in that scenario. Very well done for a first. The texture is nice
    too.\r\n\r\nI second the comment on the <em>fi</em> in the thread title. "

  body: "Thanks for the feedback, guys!\r\nThe legibility is indeed a bit off perhaps
    (as with most ambigrams, I find), but I put aesthetics first, so I'm glad to hear
    at least I succeeded at that ;-)"
