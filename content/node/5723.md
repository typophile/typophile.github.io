    and I&#39;m not crazy about the angus hugging the &#34;K&#34; either

  body: The angus is one element. And the word Kautz is another. If they are side-by-side
    as in version 1 and 2, they shouldn&#39;t touch ... because the eye wants to see
    them as &#34;one thing and another thing&#34;, not &#34;one thingand another thing&#34;
    &#40;pardon my English&#41;. <BR> <BR>If they on the other hand are intertwined,
    it&#39;s okay ... but watch out for production difficulties. <BR> <BR>I think
    the &#39;tree&#39; must have to go. <BR> <BR>Beware that in version 1 and 2 there
    is too much space around A. <BR> <BR>In version 3, could you avoid &#34;cropping
    the angus with a scalpel&#34;? You may have to put the angus in a frame ... I
    haven&#39;t got any solution to this right now ... Maybe version 2 could be realized

  body: You might explore creating a medal, like they give out at a county fair. Implying
    award winning, gold medal that sort of thing. That would be one way of separating
    the illustration from the type. As its constituted now the look hardly looks premium.

    each other ... where will the design be applied? <BR> <BR>The drawing of the angus
    needs to be simpler and clearer. The drawing must be recognized instantly. <BR>

    more of a bull rather than a steer or heifer. Not sure if either of that matters.

    and possibly a sign. <BR> <BR>darrel -- thank you for the suggestion -- i went
    with an image of the &#34;live bull&#34; because the cows are not always sold
    for the sole purpose of butchering &#40;in fact, most of the time they are not.&#41;
    <BR> <BR>do you think these logos are hitting the mark, or should i revisit more
    concepting? <BR> <BR>

    abstract, &#34;sketchy&#34; illustration similar to what i&#39;ve used, i agree
    it needs some work &amp; clarification. <BR> <BR>What do you mean, Scott, about
    the type in #2 flipped to read right? &#40;do you mean with the &#34;KAUTZ RED
    ANGUS&#34; to the right of the circle?&#41; <BR> <BR>Thanks again everyone for

  body: I mean, &#34;RED ANGUS&#34; is upside down. Turn it right side up. This action
    might require some kind of divider between &#34;PREMIUM&#34; and &#34;RED ANGUS&#34;
    &#40;bullet points, or something&#41;, but I don&#39;t like reading upside down
    on a logo.

  body: 'Sally - I like where you are going - the illustration is better in these
    second rounds - but I think you may also try something a little more removed from
    such a literal illustration  you run the risk of it looking clip arty. <BR> <BR>Something
    with clean lines that would work well in single color - &#40;the merril lynch
    logo comes to mind for obvious reasons&#41; but what about a hoofprint or something
    with just the horns cradling the type?  <BR> <BR>I can totally empathize with
    you - I do design work for a supplier to the dairy industry. Udder dip, mating
    supplies and bull um... well lets just say essence... and there is so much cow
    imagry in marketing pieces and ads and so forth that a mark that is distilled
    down to a quicky symbol may play stronger than a more illustrative approach. Just
    a thought -  <BR> <BR>having said that so far I like #2, but agree with Scott
    about flipping the type right side up at the bottom - perhaps also think of using
    that seal without an enclosure around the type.'

  body: Sally, I&#39;ve made an assumption I shouldn&#39;t have. Is this mark being
    developed to be for the consummer of the beef or is it towards the distributors?
    What comes to mind on the consummer level is Boars Head Brand.

    which is why the consumer-end comes to mind.  <BR> <BR>This is a logo more for
    a Ranch, a Red Angus breeder, than anything to do with the consumer-end. Although
    the cows bought may be butchered it is much different than buying beef in a grocery
    store. Does that make sense? <BR> <BR>Here is another idea . . . I took #1 and

  body: 'I like your first designs better.  <BR> <BR>The circle with K and bull on
    top of each other is far too complicated. It&#39;s like your telling two jokes
    at the same time. Which is better: a drawing of a bull, or a drawing of K defined
    by the negative spaces? I think the bull. But certainly not both on top of each
    other. <BR> <BR>The circle as it is now is not likely to be reproduced in small
    sizes, let alone in one colour &#40;where the rightmost part of the K would grow
    out of the shoulder&#41;. <BR> <BR>If you were to balance a circle next to KAUT
    and the subline, I would place the circle higher, sharing a horizontal axis with
    only KAUTZ, not with both lines, thus letting the subline &#39;hang&#39; underneath.  <BR>

  body: Sally, <BR>The logos you have designed look nice, but they do have a food
    design feel to them and after reading other posts it seems like many of the people
    think the company sells steaks not livestock. Perhaps you should think more &#34;ranch&#34;
    than individual &#34;cow&#34;. Your design could show a few cows in a field, indicating
    breeding cow &#40;without going completely graphic&#41; rather than hamburger.
    Or not even show a cow, a branding iron, rope or fence sign are quick imagery
    that comes to mind when thinking ranch. Maybe it&#39;s something as simple as
    showing a whole cow to get rid of the food association, the severed head sort
    of leads one to think of butchery.

  body: If your selling cattle to ranchers the odds they know what Red Angus Beef
    is.  Sally you might loose the Cattle Illustration and make it straight type.
    I was thrown off in the beginning thinking it was a consumer logo.
