  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>Art Nouveau:</p>
<p>Art Nouveau was a time period in the early to middle nineteenth century that was characterized by the absence of straight lines.  The style was greatly influenced by nature and was generally organic in form.  It was very decorative and ornamental and often resembled leaves, flowers, vines, birds, insects, etc.</p>
<p>[img:sites/default/files/old-images/2459129362_1cf9f78fb6_3708.jpg]</p>
<p>I thought that this work, &ldquo;The Kiss,&rdquo; by Peter Behrens, was a perfect example of Art Nouveau.  The flowing hair of the women (or woman) is very natural.  The colors are also extremely natural, not bright or enhanced.  Although these women are not necessarily &ldquo;photo-realistic&rdquo; and do not look like reality at all, they are still obviously an artistic portrayal of two (or one) beautiful women.  I really like the thick contour lines combined with the sections of flat color.  I also like the symmetric composition.  I just think the entire piece just comes together to create something really beautiful.</p>
<p>Russian Constructivism:</p>
<p>Russian Constructivism was a movement in both art and architecture in Russia that began around 1913.  This style is characterized by complete abstraction and a push towards modernity.  It was often extremely experimental and very geometric.  Generally speaking, the movement was extremely objective and minimal.</p>
<p>[img:sites/default/files/old-images/chimage_5874.php.jpeg]</p>
<p>&ldquo;Beat the Whites With the Red Wedge&rdquo; has always been my favorite Russian Constructivist piece.  Not only am I attracted to the balanced yet asymmetrical composition, but I also like that there is a message behind it.  It obviously has to do with the struggles and disagreements occurring that occurred during the Russian Revolution.  I think that I have a much harder time creating and appreciating a work that doesn&rsquo;t have a specific message or purpose behind it.  I like the combination of black, white, red and gray as well.  I just think that this is probably one of the most successful designs that I have ever seen as far as getting the message to the viewer.</p>
<p>Futurism:</p>
<p>Though Futurism began in Italy it soon became an international art movement. Futurism is inspired by machines and the new industrial age that spread throughout Europe in the early 1900s.  There is also a paradox found in the Futurists' work that both embraces and denounces the new and exciting world that was evolving before their eyes.</p>
<p>[img:sites/default/files/old-images/473px-Blast2_4573.jpg]</p>
<p>Out of these three movements, I think Futurism is probably my least favorite.  I think that I do understand the message behind it, and that does make me a bit happier.  I like the mechanical and kind of robotic look that it entails.  The cover of the &ldquo;Blast&rdquo; by Wyndham Lewis in particular seems like a good composition.  I find it very interesting in that the darkness of the work makes it look angry and harsh, but then if you look at the work as a whole, it seems more like it is giving a positive message about the industrial age.  I also like the different textures that Lewis creates different amounts of the same color ink in different areas.  I like how the lines on the right resemble a person (or a group of people) and the same type of lines on the left are arranged completely differently to look like buildings.  Again, I think this is just a really effective overall composition.</p>
