body: "I am posting this under General Discussions because it concerns a very technical
  issue that transcends Arabic. \r\nMy favorite iOS apps (ArtStudio, Pages for iPhone
  and iPad) render Arabic mark positioning correctly, except for an otherwise excellent
  \ app called InkPad. InkPad for the iPad is a superb vector drawing app and renders
  Arabic fonts correctly except that mark positioning goes haywire for all Arabic
  fonts. The attached image shows how the pink marks on my AlQuds SemiBold  font are
  displaced in Inkpad from their intended position shown in black. The adjustments
  differ for each letter but the app applies them in the opposite direction up or
  down!\r\n I wrote to the developer a few years ago but the issue is too technical
  for them. Can Typophile experts help pinpoint the trouble?  Thanks."

  body: "Very interesting bug. It's strange that sometimes the error is up and sometimes
    down. Can you derive a pattern relative to the actual GPOS anchor data, or to
    the default heights of the marks and how these are adjusted in the GPOS? I'm guessing,
    just by looking at your example, that the GPOS values might be being applied in
    reverse, i.e. that when you lower a mark from its default height, InkPad is raising
    it, and vice versa. But I'd need to see how your mark glyphs sit relative to the
    0,0 position in order to determine what's going on.\r\n\r\nIn order to determine
    what's at fault, you need to find out what layout engine InkPad is using for OpenType
    Layout."

  body: 'Hi John Indeed it is a simple flip of the positioning instruction reversing
    the direction. If you draw a line through the locus of midpoints between the pink
    and black marks in the diagram, you will get the original level of all the top
    marks at around the 620 mark . For what its worth I attach the Marks positioning
    data. '

  body: I can't offer any more advice without knowing how InkPad is doing OpenType
    Layout shaping. Is it using Apple's CoreText engine in the OS, or something else?
    [Note that I've heard reports of CoreText GPOS bugs in Sierra and the latest iOS,
    but nothing like you show here.]

  body: Thanks I have written to the developers of the app, StoneStudio, and asked
    them to look into the discussions here and respond. The app is open source and
    the code is at https://github.com/sprang/Inkpad

  body: "The InkPad app developer wrote me the following, which confirms John Hudson's
    suggestion that CoreText may be responsible.\r\n\" have checked this program's
    source code and found that using the iOS system CoreText in this program. So,
    maybe this problem can't be fixed so far. But I will do my best to see if this
    bug could be fixed in the future.\r\nThanks again for you using my app and reporting
    this bug.\"\r\n\r\n"

  body: Are you able to test some other Arabic fonts in InkPad to see whether this
    is a common problem or something that is only affecting your font?

  body: I did test that - it changes the mark adjustment values in the fonts that
    have them which I tested. Al Nile however is unchanged, probably because the marks
    have no positioning changes.
