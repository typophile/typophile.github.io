  body: "You can search the site for references to these. In spite of the fact that
    we see questions about it a lot, I think finding the font anywhere has been difficult.
    The site that had Aktuelle wouldn't allow selecting it, and Spoleto seems MIA
    online (I have it in my collection), and Opti Sport Script is another alias (from
    the impenetrable CastCraft folks).\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
