  body: FLS is too old to know these Unicode ranges exist, but it you locate the text
    file "uranges.dat" in one of your FontLab folders, you can add the information
    about any new Unicode ranges and thus make them accessible in FontLab.

  body: "\"uranges.dat\" is a text file and can be edited with any plain text editor,
    e.g. TextEdit if you're on a Mac (make sure to save the file as plain text, not
    formatted text after any changes).\r\n\r\nYou have to add a line for each of your
    new Unicode ranges with its first and last code point, like this:\r\n\r\n<code>0x1D7F6,0x1D7FF,
    \    Math digits monospace\r\n0x1F500,0x1F5FF,1F500 Pictograms\r\n0x1F680,0x1F6C5,1F680
    Transport and Map Symbols \r\n0x20000,0x2A6DF,20000 CJK Unified Ideographs Extension
    B</code>\r\n\r\nAfter a restart of FontLab, the new Unicode range entries will
    be displayed in the drop-down menu."

  body: "Thanks Jens. I tried it and it doesn't work. I noticed on the uranges.dat
    \ file when opened in TextEdit shows just the start and end code points, each
    followed by a comma then the range name, like so:\r\n\r\n0x2460,0x24FF,Enclosed
    Alphanumerics\r\n0x2460,0x2473,    Circled numbers\r\n0x2474,0x2487,    Parenthesized
    numbers\r\n0x2488,0x249B,    Numbers period\r\n0x249C,0x24B5,    Parenthesized
    Latin letters\r\n0x24B6,0x24E9,    Circled Latin letters\r\n0x24EA,0x24EA,    Additional
    circled numbers \r\n\r\nYours, however show start,end,start   no comma then range
    name.\r\n\r\nI tried:\r\n0x1F500,0x1F5FF, Pictograms     but that didn't work
    either.\r\nIt's also difficult to know exactly where to put the data.\r\n\r\nThat
    would be a great idea Hrant - It would be so easy for FontLab to have a page available
    where one could  just copy and paste the data from the internet into the uranges.dat
    file.\r\n\r\nNick"

  body: "Nick, I think if you omit the start number after the second comma, that range
    will be grouped under the previous name. Maybe that\u2019s why you don\u2019t
    see them in FL?\r\n\r\n<blockquote>What about somebody making and publishing a
    uranges.dat</blockquote>\r\n\r\nAre you looking at me, Hrant? ;)\r\n\r\nIndeed
    I seem to have added new ranges to my uranges.dat a while ago, I think I made
    it manually, so I can\u2019t guarantee it\u2019s completely up to date. I\u2019ve
    added it to my JK Font Tools repository on SourceForge: http://sourceforge.net/p/jkfonttools/code/6/tree/trunk/FontLab/Data/uranges.dat"
