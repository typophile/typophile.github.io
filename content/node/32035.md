  body: 'If it is an OT font and you are working in FontLab, go to the features panel
    and "build kerns." Compile, and then write off the feature file, which you can
    open with a text editor. In that file, the "kern" feature will show both your
    plain pairs kerning and your class kerning. The classes as defined will be at
    the top of the file. '

  body: "The Classes panel allows you to save its contents, so you can apply it to
    another font. (Menu list at top left of the panel.)\r\n\r\nIf you make a class
    for \"O_right\" and include O', C, G and Q, as well as the accented versions of
    those letters, you only need to manually kern O (providing the other characters
    are similar enough in shape). And so on for all the other character kinds that
    require kerning.\r\n\r\nUsing this principle, you only need to manually set a
    couple of hundred kern pairs for each weight of a font, and the rest of the kerns
    are handled by the class-based system.\r\n\r\nThe rest of the information -- the
    lists of glyph classes and their contents -- is transferred in FontLab's \"flc\"
    files, by using the menu at the top left of the classes panel."

    maybe. It always seems to scew up, or maybe I don't understand the program well
    enough. If so, I'm not alone: take a look a Monotype Bulmer OpenType, purchased
    through Adobe (though I doubt it is Adobe's fault). There is a class _f which
    has as its members all the f_ligatures. It is specified to kern only on the LEFT.
    But somehow, when the pair \"f\" and \"quote\" (also a class) got kerned, that
    value was applied to all the members of _f, even though that is a kern on the
    RIGHT. So, \"Jeffi\" (a nickname in a novel I've read) would have what amounts
    to a word space between the \"ffi\" and the apostrophe with the possessive \"Jeffi's\".\r\n\r\nI
    prefer to take control & only work with the features files."
