  a loop are proportionally less in weight than the other letters. Is this to optically
  balance it out so it doesn't end up looking too big? \r\n"

  body: "Yes (although more about weight than size). In a text face busy letters (like
    often the \"s\" as well) have to look lighter when large/magnified in order to
    end up looking the correct weight at small sizes.\r\n\r\nAlso, I believe a good
    binocular \"g\" must necessarily look a bit small and a bit vertically cramped
    in order to avoid more important things going out of whack across the font as
    a whole.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    body: 'Thanks for clearing that up hrant. Another thing is can you tell me roughly
      how much of weight goes into it generally speaking? From what I can tell it''s
      always a tad less by about 20% than say for a p, P, O, o, e, a and the loop
      matches that of the spine of an s" in some cases  Is that about right? '
