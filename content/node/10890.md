    <BR> <BR>I will assume it is Bodoni &#40;Bitstream or Linotype&#41;, and I will
    also assume it was also somehow &#34;compressed&#34; by the graphic artist who

  body: Not sure. The serifs in your sample are quite thick, they&#39;re almost slab
    serifs. The G and the L are very different. It&#39;s probably an existing face
    &#40;but I don&#39;t know which&#41;.
