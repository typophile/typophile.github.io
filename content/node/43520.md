  (below), this is a screengrab from the opening menu page of \"Pandora's Box\", packaged
  by the Criterion Collection.\r\n\r\nI am looking for the main sans serif font, I
  noticed it has perfectly round capital letter O, like Gotham, and uses lower case
  N, and the X is very peculiar too, but I can't find the font yet.\r\n\r\nAny help
  is appreciated!\r\n\r\nThank you!\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/DSC04798_CW_4596.jpg]"

    looking this way. It may have been chosen for the DVD conversion. The menu on
    the right would not have been part of the original titles, but it is stretched
    as if at the edge of a bubble screen.\r\n\r\n"

    image looks like it's a screen capture from a DVD menu. It's a wide image so you
    probably didn't notice the menu items on the right."

    S, they're perfectly matched.

  body: "[img:sites/default/files/old-images/bayer_sans_6340.jpg]\r\n\r\nthank you
    jupiterboy, i think you nailed it! i did a quick test (above), and it looks really
    good to me, all the letters from the example look correct (as far as i can tell),
    including the A, R, O, X, E, A, L, S, even the G!\r\n\r\nyeah i don't know too
    much about classic films, but i think when the criterion collection chooses to
    re-release a classic/great film on dvd, they do a whole repackaging thing, quite
    lavishly, with new special features, film transfer, packaging, titles, etc.\r\n\r\nalso,
    i am pretty sure the criterion logo was designed by pentagram, although i don't
    know (and doubt) if they do the individual rebranding for each film. \r\n\r\noh
    and yeah, i didn't exactly do a screengrab, i took a picture of my tv screen,
    thus the warping on the edges.\r\n\r\ni am curious now to see the original opening
    titles, let me check the dvd!\r\n\r\nthanks again, i really appreciate it!!!\r\n\r\n"

  body: "true, Asvetic, maybe i should have said, even the S. yeah, it is kinda stressful
    and not harmonious that S, like it is all nervous. oh well, still really like
    the font! i didn't know it was designed by herbert bayer.\r\n\r\nhmm, on myfonts
    it says this is the font used on the bloomingdale's bag, not sure if this is true?
    \r\n\r\nmore info from myfonts:\r\n\r\nBayer Sans, is based on the typography
    of the Austrian-born artist Herbert Bayer. Bayer worked as a teacher and graphic
    designer at the Bauhaus, a revolutionary German art school, during the 20\u2019s.
    His specialty was commercial art and he had many \u201Cradical\u201D views on
    typography and its interaction with society. Bayer felt that written language
    should be merely a graphic version of spoken language. Thus, he advocated a single
    alphabet without majuscules and miniscules. Bayer\u2019s designs are simple, geometric
    letterforms that lend themselves to lowercase form. This font, based on the typography
    of Bayer and his students at the Bauhaus Werkstatt (studio), was digitally modeled
    by Noah Rothschild. Bayer Sans features a complete character set including European
    characters, alternate letters with adjusted widths and designs and ligatures.
    Included are the \u201Cf\u201D characters and a special linked double-o.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/bloomingdales_bag_4311.png]"
