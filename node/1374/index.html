<div class=commentbody>There are a lot of good things about Heller and his writing. There's also this certain nagging unease, something that smells like an "unholy" agenda - it's hard to put into words, and quite possibly in part in my/our imagination. <br> <br>For example: <br>Why write a book that purports to wonder if the Swastika is beyond salvation as a symbol, while in fact Heller's foregone -and suspiciously convenient- conclusion is that <i>no it must never even be allowed to heal</i> as a symbol. <br> <br>hhp <br></div>

<div class=commentbody><b>David said:</b> <br> <br><i>first and foremost: i don't like to use labels. tags. e.g "large chunks of Heller's writing".</i> <br> <br>Well you don't have to worry, then, because it's me who's saying "large chunks..." not you. How is that a label or a tag? <br> <br>Look at it this way: <br> <br>Q: What can I not stand? <br>A: A sizeable amount of Mr Heller's output. <br> <br><i>what is "an irrational prejudice"?</i> <br> <br>His ravings on the Swatika have turned me off a lot of his more lucid studies on graphic design. An enormous pity, I'm sure, and not very rational, but true as the day is long, all the same. <br> <br><i>you're a historian - what field? where?</i> <br> <br>You'd make a fiendish inquisitor, David. What? Where? Why? How? Prove it! Prove it!... <br> <br>My fields are 19th and 20th century nationalist propaganda and Irish book history/typography and I'm attached to the universities of Reims and Paris 7. <br>Have I satisfied your curiosity? Will I post my CV along with any future criticism of Steven Heller? <br> <br><i>most important: if this thread is going to be like "raed the txet", "killing" each other.....forget it</i> <br> <br>I'm glad I'm not the only one with irrational prejudices. I can see why you like Heller. He's all for 'forgetting' things he doesn't want to see or hear too. <br> <br><b>Hrant said:</b> <br> <br>...<i> this certain nagging unease, something that smells like an "unholy" agenda - it's hard to put into words, and quite possibly in part in my/our imagination.</i> <br> <br>That pretty much sums it up for me.

So now i am in a hurry to find a better topic where i can generate a good argument. I would still like to write about typogaraphy around postmodernism. <br>I am thinking to write about the use of type in illustration. Can we use type as an image rather than information. <br>What do you guy's think? <br> iS ANYONE HAVE ANY BETTER SUGGESTIONS? <br>I don't wan't you to do m work for me but i would appritiate any help! <br>Thank you looking forward to hear from someone ... <br> </div>

<div class=commentbody>Try the book series 'a closer look'; critical writings on graphic design, <br>edited by Michael Bierut (of Pentagram) and ...Steven Heller(!!!) <br> <br>Judging from its first volume it puts the post back in postmodernism. <br> <br>Or the ode. <br> <br>Either way, I've found it useful as food for thought. <br> <br>From a strictly personal point of view I'd appreciate anyone trying to do some thorough work on fab sister Corita Kent, from a design/typographic angle. <br>Maybe your next project? <br> <br>Best of luck Maria, <br> <br> <br></div>

<div class=commentbody>post-modern: <br> <br>1. Wolfgang Weingart (Basel, the new style) - he mixed type weights within the same word, arranged type into images; he rejected the order and cleanliness of the Swiss design and typography. ===> <br> <br>2. Dan Friedman (New York, the new style) - in 1973 Friedman wrote: <br> <br>"legibility (a quality of efficient, clear, and simple reading) is often in conflict with readability (a quality which promotes interest, pleasure, and challenge in reading).

<div class=commentbody>Modern typography kinda sucks. What is groovy about funny mirrors and sparkler types. Thankfully torquois, mouve and purple went out of fashion in India about three hundred years back. Unfortunately modern typographers have not learned from the mistakes of the past. Typographers these days seem to think they have entered the pre talki days of the movie industry with the addition of "colour". <br> <br>I hate to be a stick in the mud but what about something really "radical" such as "letterpress typography rocks". <br> <br>Long haired typography. Now that's groovy! <br> <br><a href=http://www.lanstontype.com/GiampaLunenbergBoat.html target=_blank>http://www.lanstontype.com/GiampaLunenbergBoat.html</a> <br> <br>Gerald Giampa <br> <br>Next time Heller wants to elucidated his theroy about the evils that intrinsically lurk behind the skirt of in the innocent Swastika form he might try to convince me at a town hall meeting here. <br> <br><a href=http://www.lanstontype.com/ShyloGiampa.html target=_blank>http://www.lanstontype.com/ShyloGiampa.html</a></div>

<div class=commentbody>Maria <br> <br>"can we use type as an image rather than information?" <br> <br>This instance does not cover post modernism, but certainly answers the question of type as image. <br> <br>One man who has made a very in-depth study of the question without ever asking it of himself, is Chris Stern of Grey Spider Press. Over the past few years he has designed and printed a collection of typographical broadsheets, so rich in concept as to be almost paintings rather than merely a collection of wood-and-metal-type posters. <br> <br>If you contact him, you may be able to get him to send you a photocopy or some other representation of his work. <br> <br>He can be contacted by e mail at: <br> <br><a href=mailto:flywheel@premier1.net>flywheel@premier1.net</a> <br> <br>You can blame the intrusion on me. <br> <br>Jim Rimmer</div>
