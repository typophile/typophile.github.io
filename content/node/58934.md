  body: "This is a tough one. The G seems like it would be a good clue, but I couldn't
    find anything much closer than [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/itc/willow/|ITC
    Willow]]. This would take a fair amount of editing to get very close to your sample,
    even ignoring the special effects.\r\n\r\nThat G is one key, but nothing's popping
    up. Could you get Whatthefont to accept the image? Might be worth a try, since
    nobody here seems to have any ideas.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
