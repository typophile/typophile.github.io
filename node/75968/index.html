<p>I also just read and enjoyed your article in <em>Reform Judaism</em>, titled <em>Einstein&rsquo;s Religious Awakening</em>. Now I know that this might not be the correct forum, but&hellip; I did have two comments to make regarding the later article.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Why is the title (and your name) set in <em>Adobe Caslon</em>??? In fact, why is the magazine set in TNR? Please help them see the light (typographically speaking)! I would much rather read the magazine set in your own beautiful rendition of Caslon.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Was Einstein&rsquo;s &ldquo;awakening&rdquo; not a <em>spiritual</em> one, rather than a &ldquo;religious&rdquo; one?</p>
</li>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Thanks, Adam. On the typography.</p>
<p>They have used Adobe Caslon for display and TNR for text for a long time. Actually I think Adobe Caslon is rather nice for display; I don&rsquo;t think it works so well as text. Of course, I think my Williams Caslon Heading and Display would be still better, but they&rsquo;re not yet complete or published. I do think that Williams Caslon would be much better suited for the text of this magazine. TNR is a great face, but rather impersonal and a bit cold. But I&rsquo;m not the designer of the magazine, it&rsquo;s not my call.</p>
<p>I also didn&rsquo;t do the title of the article, which I only saw after publication. I do think it is accurate to call what happened to Einstein as a child a religious awakening, though I don&rsquo;t use those words in the article. Later when, as a pre-teen, he firmly rejected a personal God, but kept a deep religious feeling about his work, I think it is a toss-up whether you call it spiritual or religious. He himself says that in one sense, but only one, he is &ldquo;deeply religious.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Einstein&rsquo;s religious views are fascinating and hard to categorize, which is what the article is about. I had a lot more to say, but they cut it down to a journalistic report on Einstein, and not an assessment of his views, which I did a draft of. Another time and place, I hope &hellip;</p>
<p>ps For anyone interested, the article (without the print formatting) is [[http://reformjudaismmag.org/Articles/index.cfm?id=1828|online here.]]</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>William,</p>
<p>Thank you for the detailed response.</p>
<p>The reason that I made the comment regarding <em>spiritual</em> versus <em>religious</em>, is simply because the term religion (and thus, religious) is, for the most part, associated with doctrine, or any form of a defined <em>system</em> of belief. As far as I know, Einstein never attended shul, prayed &ldquo;Adon Olam&rdquo;, or proclaimed &ldquo;Pour thy wrath upon the Gentiles&rdquo; during a Seder. He was (as you mentioned) &ldquo;in awe of the heavens&rdquo;, and saw God&rsquo;s silhouette in the very fabric of creation and the universe. As such, I believe that the term &ldquo;spiritual&rdquo; is perhaps more appropriate.</p>
<p>Perhaps Einstein&rsquo;s increased sense of spirituality was, at least in part, due to the apparent failure of the greater Logical-Positivist project. Kurt Gödel’s <em>Incompleteness Theorem</em>, which delivered the coup de grâce to Logical Positivism, also left the door (slightly) open to more spiritual (and less positivist) conceptions of the natural world—it let some &ldquo;mystery&rdquo; into the equation.</p>
<p>Now, just to keep the topic within the realm of typography, I agree that TNR is a superb typeface (for columns), but its ubiquity makes the magazine look cheap, and it certainly lacks the so-called &ldquo;air of authority&rdquo; that a good Caslon commands. I will write to the editors and share my typographic misgivings with them.</p>

		<div class="commentbody">I think that Einstein&rsquo;s spiritual or religious feelings were very strong from his childhood, and never diminished. Einstein was a friend of Gödel, I believe, but he had a very strong feelings about the mystery of the natural world from his early teen years, long before the incompleteness theorems. (This is what I get from Max Jammer&rsquo;s book.) Also there are many reasons to see mystery in the world other than Gödel. This is not the place to go into it, but I do discuss it in my new book, Pirke Avot: Timeless Wisdom for Modern Life.</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Very enjoyable essays, Mr. Berkson. Are you planning additional installments to discuss the specifics of your display and heading sizes? Given how independent Caslon&rsquo;s optical sizes are, I&rsquo;d think you&rsquo;d have more to say on the subject than most. I&rsquo;m intrigued by how eclectic Caslon&rsquo;s influences are across those sizes. Have you been able to trace any of the specific influences, or do any specific sizes stand out as more idiosyncratic than the rest?</p>
<p>Williams Caslon is likely to become my favorite Caslon revival. As much as I appreciate Justin Howes&rsquo;s magnum opus, I don&rsquo;t have any of the right applications for it in the kinds of works I publish. Adobe Caslon, as important a work as it is, lacks that essential Caslon warmth as you discuss in your essays; also, for my purposes, it lacks italic small caps, which are essential to taming the menagerie of acronyms I have to work with.</p>
<p>Has Typophile run a thread yet about the release of Williams Caslon Text? If so, I haven&rsquo;t been able to locate. If not, they should.</p>
<p>The earlier Caslons thread on Typophile should also be extended to mention the release of your text size, since it does mention your work in progress a couple years ago. Also, the Caslon page in Typowiki should be updated to reference and link to it.</p>
<p>On a complete side note, would you be willing to entertain the idea of adding small-caps lining figures to Williams Caslon Text? I know you have plenty of more important things to worry about with your project, but I sure could use them to help tame variable names, program names, Canadian ZIP codes, and other alphanumeric scrambles.</p>
<p>And finally, could you give us a status update on Williams Caslon Display and Heading? I&rsquo;m in no way wanting to pressure you to finish sooner - things need to cook until they&rsquo;re done - but I&rsquo;m sure I&rsquo;m not alone in being genuinely interested in what you&rsquo;re working on.</p>

<p>Williams Caslon Text does have small caps lining figures. You can access them by going to Character/Open type/All small caps. Unfortunately, in InDesign the &ldquo;Open Type&rdquo; option, at least in CS4, is well hidden. You have to click on the box at the top right of the Character window to access it.</p>
<p>On the Display and Heading sizes. A basic character set for the Roman exists for the Heading Medium size, and for a &ldquo;Small&rdquo; text size regular. The Heading size Medium is based pretty closely on the Great Primer of Caslon, 18 pt., and the proportions of the Small text is based on Caslon&rsquo;s Long Primer, about 9.5 pt. These are both sizes that historian James Mosley singled out, I think rightly, as some of Caslon&rsquo;s best. I also did the a small set of characters of Display italic for my [[http://www.jewishpub.org/product.php?id=444|recently published book.]] (I didn&rsquo;t do the cover.) The display italic is more of my own thing.</p>
<p>Here is the display italic in the book:</p>
<p><img src="/images/old-images/Avot_Acknowledgments_grab_4670.png" alt=""></p>
<p>.
And here is a bit of the Small in the Appendix:</p>
<p><img src="/images/old-images/Avot_Appendix_grab_3851.png" alt=""></p>
<p>.
I had been thinking to wait for demand to do the Display and to complete the rest, but now I&rsquo;m thinking that having the rest will really help to get the Text size out there. In fact, I had to continually restrain myself from increasing contrast, which magically makes everything more pretty and elegant, though in my view less good for text size. So I will get to this sooner rather than later, but I dare not say how quickly—unless there is a commission to finish it, of course!</p>
