    some pretty distinctive characteristics, like the diagonal terminals in \u2018C\u2019
    & \u2018S\u2019, the leg of the \u2018R\u2019 \u2013 and even the apostrophe stands
    out. Have a look: <a href=\"http://www.typophile.com/node/39012\">How does everyone
    identify typefaces?</a> \r\n\r\n<cite>Could you please also tell me if there are
    any fonts that are similar or identical that I may download for free?</cite>\r\n\r\nYou
    can have <a href=\"http://www.houseind.com/index.php?page=freefonts\">House Slant</a>
    (+ 2 other beauties) for free. And you can read about <a href=\"http://letterror.com/content/value/index.html\">the
