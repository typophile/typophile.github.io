  PDF series on graphic design that was well-designed and also colorful and had many
  examples in it, approaching design basics and explaining design for non-designers.
  I've since lost it and have no recollection of the title... It explained typography
  as well, including leading, kerning, tracking... \r\n\r\nDoes anyone have a similar
  guide (of the basics of design, not just type) that I could easily get a hold of?
  \r\n\r\nThanks!"
