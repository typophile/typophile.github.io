There it states that, &ldquo;Nowadays, successful feature films may be dubbed into Spanish in up to three different &ldquo;standard&rdquo; versions: Iberian (or European) Spanish for Spain (Castilian Spanish); Rio-de-la-Plata Spanish for Uruguay, Paraguay and Argentina, Mexican Spanish for Mexico; and another one for the rest of Latin America.&rdquo;
I would think that the OT spec would recognize the divergence of the Spanish languages to a greater degree than it does.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">The differences in pronunciation and vocabulary between different regions for Castilian (i.e., &ldquo;Spanish&rdquo;) are substantial, but this doesn&rsquo;t affect typography. &ldquo;Voces&rdquo; might be pronounced &ldquo;vothesh&rdquo;, &ldquo;vos&rsquo;s&rdquo;, or &ldquo;vose&rdquo;, but it&rsquo;s spelled the same everywhere, and any rules concerning syllable division, accent marking, digraphs, capitalization, etc. are also the same everywhere. So far as I know, all the countries concerned follow the orthographic standards set by the Real Academia Española, so even when the RAE changes something that might affect OT behavior - like the changed alphabetization rule of 1994 - it is adopted everywhere. Of course, this could always change in the future, at which time a new tag might be needed.</div>

<p>I have had a situation where we needed a translation of a brochure into Spanish. There were 2 Spanish speaking individuals as part of the clients team. They were from different countries though and kept getting into arguments about the translation. It was sort of like a Mac vs PC flame-war thing. They each wanted the translation to be done by different people because of the kind of Spanish. This was to be a printed document so no phonetics were involved. They were both pretty passionate about differences. I never got the grasp of what the problem was, most of their arguing was done in Spanish. Eventually, the project was dropped.</p>

<p>It has been a while but I think one was from Pueerto Rico and the other from western Mexico. Since I don&rsquo;t speak Spanish, I am not sure exactly what was going on.

<p>You&rsquo;re right; I guess my vocabulary is way out of date (I haven&rsquo;t been in Spain much in nearly 20 years). I checked with a friend who says &ldquo;calculadora&rdquo; used to be the &ldquo;official&rdquo; word, but everyone now would call a PC an &ldquo;ordenador&rdquo; (modeled on the French word &ldquo;ordinateur&rdquo;).</p>
