body: "Who reads font promotional material? I've released a few fonts at MyFonts and
  Fonts.com and, I always hit a snag writing the promo material. Are such articles
  actually necessary? Who reads them anyway. I read them to get some idea what people
  are wrinting about their fonts. Some type fanatics might read them. The search engines
  sift through them, I guess. However, I don't think that sales are going to be improved
  by great copy. I never was very good at copywriting. So is there a point to spending
  a lot of time on a description? Maybe I'm missing something.\r\n\r\nJames"

  body: In the advertising trade, it's called <strong>romance copy</strong>. Straightforward
    letterform descriptions may be efficient and/or informative, but you gotta give
    people a reason to fall in love with your font.

    some dingbat stds janitors should support meta data standards that can \"see\"
    better than any outline analyzer ever could. D'oh!"

  body: "The history behind the design is alpha and omega to me, or at least almost:
    maybe beta and psi? If there is no story, I make up my own based on the looks
    of it. Or I just don\u2019t care to license it, because I suspect it\u2019s just
    another trendy thing with little or no substance. Of course, if the romance copy
    is too Wurthering Heights-ish I might think that the designer is just trying too
    fool me."

  body: You could simply post an image of a font here in these forums and ask the
    crowd for some descriptive phrases or adjectives that might apply. Make it pithy,
    and reassure the potential buyers that they're making a lasting, useful choice.
