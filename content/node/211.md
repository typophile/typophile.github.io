  of a corporate identity. These aren&#39;t limited to  <BR>mom and pop shops, some
  of these logotypes identify  <BR>well-established, global companies. Some of them  <BR>have
  been around a surprisingly long time. Too long. <BR> <BR>We want to see them here.
  <BR> <BR>Rules: <BR>1_ Show us the odd, the strange and the poorly  <BR>designed
  logotypes or word marks of the corporate  <BR>world. <BR> <BR>2_ Submit marks from
  companies that a lot of  <BR>us would recognize. <BR> <BR>3_ Provide some background
  if you know any. <BR> <BR>4_ Post a graphic please. <BR> <BR>5_ Show us stuff we
  can learn from. &#40;Even if  <BR>it&#39;s learning from other people&#39;s mistakes.&#41;'

  body: Joe and I had the opportunity to design this client&#39;s site, which has
    evolved a little since we released it.  <BR> <BR>The corporate style guide placed
    a strong emphasis on the proper use of Benton Gothic, so we were intrigued by
    the corporate logotype, which uses a manually-squashed version of Benton Gothic
    Black.  <BR> <BR>Someone should approach Siebel with a small contract to clean
    this logotype up.  <BR> <BR><IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/4100/639.gif"

  body: ' You stole my thunder... heh.  <BR> <BR>At first glance, it&#39;s a typical
    American corporate logo. <BR> <BR>On further scrutinization, you&#39;ll see that
    it&#39;s Benton Gothic &#40;based on Benton&#39;s Trade and News Gothic faces.
    From FontBureau?&#41; an otherwise great typeface but used here it&#39;s stretched
    150%. Note how the cap S is unnaturally wide in the curves. Finally, the cut strokes
    are an attempt to customize this beauty one step further. <BR> <BR>The Lesson:
    next time you want to use an extended face get one for the job. But don&#39;t
    force an otherwise beautiful face to contort its way into something &#39;original.&#39;

    of all the MFB related gothics &#40;Franklin, News, Alternate, errr.. Lightline?&#41;.
    It&#39;s in the FB 3rd edition specimen book. FYI, Trade Gothic was done by Jackson
    Burke &#40;at Mergenthaler&#41;, not MFB. '
