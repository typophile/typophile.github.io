  <BR> <BR>As they say, &#34;the proof is in the pudding.&#34; Maybe it&#39;s time

  body: These just drive the stake in further. <BR> <BR>This is sad. I&#39;ve always
    been a friend of the underdog  <BR>&#40;Apple, Netscape, Betamax&#41;. But, alas,
    we all want an  <BR>underdog that is actually better or at least has a chance.  <BR>Increasingly
    not so with Quark.

  body: I hope the competition forces them to do better.  <BR> <BR>InDesign is becoming
    an impressive standalone, in my opinion. I will miss Quark. <BR> <BR>Some time
    soon, maybe someone with free time will start a software obituary blogger. I would
    have to contribute some poetry for Quark.
