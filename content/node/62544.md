  has been reignited by researching Dieter Rams and his time spent at Braun.\r\n\r\nThe
  face used on both my camera, and the famous hi-fi systems he designed seems to be
  the same, and altogether lovely.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/braunnizo561_4625.jpg]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/braunsk55_4858.jpg]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/braunt1000_5201.jpg]\r\n\r\n\r\nThank
