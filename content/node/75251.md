  body: "I would loosen all pairs of Integrity EXCEPT the first one\u2026 In other
    words: use \u2018In\u2019 as the starting point. \r\n\r\nIMO the best way to kern
    a word is to [1] find the difficult pair(s) that\u2019s kind of unfixable and
    then [2] work from that starting point and do the others\u2026\r\n\r\n(Some thing
    with Flower: there is a big whole between F and l. Kern that a mite and then adjust
    the other pairings to emulate this.)"
