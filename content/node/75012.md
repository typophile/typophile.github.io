body: "Hi there.\r\n\r\nAnother newbie question :)\r\n\r\nDo you use FontLab to generate
  OpenType features of Arabic script? When I try to compile/generate some font with
  fina, medi and init features, generated output is always deformed or reordered.
  So I tried to write complex (=unstable) scripts to generate VOLT code from FontLab
  font, but it's sometimes unreliable.\r\n\r\nAny suggestions?"

  body: "AFAIK, people who do Arabic fonts with FontLab always use Volt, actually
    any one doing complex OpenType layout and using FontLab seems to be using Volt
    as well. The other option is to write feature files by hand and compile it externally
    using AFDKO which what FontLab is using under the hood anyway.\r\n\r\nMyself,
    I like to keep my glyph design and OpenType works always in sync, so I use a font
    editor that can do both reliably."

    Dr. Hosny? FontForge? I am sure many people here would like to learn in detail
    about your experience, with thanks. "

  body: "If not FontForge, what else ;)\r\n\r\nMy experience is very positive, actually
    it is the sole font editor that I've ever used. The most important \"feature\"
    of FontForge (besides being free, as in freedom, software), is its very responsive
    maintainer who has always been more than willing to implement features or fix
    bugs mostly within few hours. Thanks to its freeness, I can now even implement
    the features I want, patches are always welcomed.\r\n\r\nAs far as Arabic is concerned,
    it supports all OpenType features that I ever needed (mark positing, glyph substitution,
    contextual and non-contextual and so on). It has a powerful GUI where all OpenType
    work can be done, but also supports Adobe OpenType feature files and can merge
    them to existing fonts or generate them from existing features in the font. Also,
    unlike Volt, it preserves existing OpenType tables and the font and thus can be
    further edited.\r\n\r\nIt has also have powerful scripting, both Python and its
    own scripting languages, that simplify many repeated tasks, but also allowed me
    to do many neat tricks.\r\n\r\nI developed many Arabic fonts using FontForge,
    lastly is my [[http://amiri.sourceforge.net| Bulaq Naskh revival]], and there
    are more Arabic fonts in the pipeline."

  body: "<em>If not FontForge, what else ;)</em>\r\nThank you Dr. Hosny for the positive
    and informative comments. Perhaps you can re-publish them in a new thread devoted
    to Arabic on FontForge. \r\n\r\nIn the past I briefly tried FontForge on Ubuntu
    (Linux) Operating System and it worked well. Today I installed it on Snow Leopard
    (it is displayed within the X11 protocol which has to be installed as well) and
    it looks great on a big screen. However it kept crashing when I tried to delete
    a glyph outline I am not sure if it is the X11 or FF that is causing this.\r\n\r\nYour
    generous commitment to free type and wide experience in Arabic type design emboldens
    me to suggest that you kindly compile and publish a detailed explanations of key
    steps in the use of FF for Arabic.  That would be a great service to the community.\r\n\r\nFor
    example is there an 'empty' FF OT file for Arabic that can be the basis for a
    designer to \"fill in\" the glyphs of his or her design? I mean one in which \u0627\u0644\u0644
    the basic glyphs are named and displayed, with standard substitution and other
    tables necessary for the correct operation of Arabic (Persian Urdu, etc.) will
    be included in the file. \r\n\u0623\u0644\u0641 \u0634\u0643\u0631 \u0648 \u0628\u0627\u0631\u0643
    \u0627\u0644\u0644\u0647 \u062C\u0647\u0648\u062F\u0643"

  body: I wrote a preliminary tutorial in Arabic while ago, it can be found [[http://www.ojuba.org/wiki/docs/%D8%AA%D8%B7%D9%88%D9%8A%D8%B1_%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%AE%D8%B7%D9%88%D8%B7|here]],
    I did not manage to finish it, unfortunately, but is should cover the basics.
    Having a font template is a nice idea, I don't currently have one for that purpose,
    but you can use the [[http://svn.arabeyes.org/viewvc/art/khotot/kacst/one/|KACST
    One]] font as a base (the font itself is GPL, but the layout code has all been
    done by me and I put it into public domain). As part of the Bulaq Naskh revival,
    there will be a font with a simplified subset of glyph alternate and more conventional
    OpenType code (i.e. more widely supported than the current Amiri font) and I hope
    to provide it a template for other to use freely.

    it carefully. Yalla shidd elhemme [encouraging words] and finalize it as you intended.\r\nKCAST
    One.sfd downloads as a text file in the browser. I copied/saved that as a text
    file with .sfd extension.  FF did not recognize or open it. I wonder why.\r\nFF
    works fine on the Mac except for the use of the keyboard delete shortcut. "

    (just right click and save as), if it doesn't work then most likely that your
    FF installation is too old and can't open new files.

  body: No luck but I will try later. FF is newly installed on OS10.6 but is crashing
    often; I read that on 10.5 X11 was giving problems with FF so X11 may still be
    the problem.
