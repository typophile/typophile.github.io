  so far (such as photo.net) seem to have a lot emphasis on the technical aspects
  of photography, to the expense of the \"art\" side. \r\nI percieve the readership
  of this forum to be technically strong, but also with a great sense of design. So
  I'm looking for a photography forum of a similar veign. \r\n\r\nAny ideas?"

  body: Adobe used to have some nice forums, but a recent redesign has ruined them
    (for me at least). Since you don't have the experience of them when they were
    faster and more useful, you might not mind. The Photoshop forums (one each for
    Mac and Win) and the Photography forum might cover what you want.
