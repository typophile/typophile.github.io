  body: well, i think that it certainly affects the "team spirit". Imagine this by
    considering the shape combinations, whether they are aggressive or neutral, the
    coloring, agressive or neutral? And to sum up, yes i believe it does.

    baseball. Wonder if those are Curt Schilling's sox? I had a Grade 4 teacher who
    blew a gasket every time she saw \"Toronto Maple Leafs\" --- should be Leaves,
    she'd scream. Proves that in hockey at least you do have to know how to spell
    in order to win.\r\n\r\nThe Rockies logo looks like something on a bottle of mineral
    water.\r\n"

  body: Curt Schilling is horrid. A friend of mine interviewed the Sox for a radio
    show and said he's as unpleasant in person as he comes off. It's kinda like having
    Dick Cheney on your team.

    a few days ago Hank Steinbrenner said, \"As bad as they want it, they'll never
    be the Yankees with their brand.\" These really are brands, in the most generic,
    traditional sense of the term, for whatever fans make of things. \r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: "This topic was inspired by a conversation I overheard in an elevator yesterday.
    Two women were looking quizzically at the Rockies logo, trying to figure out what
    GR stood for.  One suggested the team was from Grand Rapids, Colorado (is that
    a place?) while the other wondered if the full name was \"Grand Rockies.\" \r\n\r\nI
    was wholly amused.  Sure, I really want to fix the wonky bowls of the Red Sox
    B, but, in my opinion, it's not nearly as lazy as either of the Rockies logos.\r\n\r\nWow,
    YES, the BOSTON needs kerning, and RED looks like it's bouncing along inside a
    stage coach wheel.\r\n\r\nGiven the expansive sports branding empire, how do these
    logos end up so glaringly imperfect? "

    possible that the spacing has been this way for a long time. Red Sox fans may
    value traditional iconography far above legibility or other similar considerations.
    \r\n\r\nUnder the circumstances, I don't think it's really possible to \"fix\"
    anything. "

    with an overly thick outline, destroying the integrity of the font. Don't they
    know you don't just stroke a character ... you follow that up by pasting an unstroked
    version on top that maintains the font design.\r\n\r\n"
