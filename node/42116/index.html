Im applying to school for advertising; part of their admissions requirements is a home test in which one of the assignments is to create a b/w logo for a fictional company called &ldquo;Overnight Express&rdquo;. No other information is included so I had went under the assumption it was a shipping company. Below is what i&rsquo;ve created&hellip; plz rip me apart =]</p>

<p>First, it&rsquo;s too complicated. I always look at my work at an inch square - about the size it would appear on a business card. I simplify (and simplify) until it&rsquo;s recognizable at a glance when it&rsquo;s THAT small.</p>
<p>Gradients are never a good idea in a logo - they don&rsquo;t reproduce well on photocopies or faxes.</p>
<p>The font looks smashed together on the left and too spaced on the right; but before you work on kerning, look around at other fonts. All caps doesn&rsquo;t score high for readability, but I think you could find something more elegant. <a href="http://www.houseind.com/index.php?page=showfont&id=18&subpage=viewfontspecimens">Neutra Display Bold </a>comes to mind.</p>

<p>lol @ escort service; but id rather not joke around too much with it just incase the admissions officers dont get my sense of humor and tell me to gtfo</p>

<p>Imagine the logo being used as a 3/4-inch diameter rubber stamp that gets photocopied a few times and then faxed. If the logo won&rsquo;t survive that kind of treatment, it&rsquo;s probably too complex.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>but you said it yourself that the application process is looking for other aptitudes of creativity. maybe thinking outside of the box is one of those? usually is in my opinion. yes, we know overnight has a lot to do with shipping and express is fast and the two together means fedex or something of the like, but really. a thoughtful and witty approach to such an open ended thing is probably where they are trying to see who goes beyond the everday monkey thinking and steps it up.</p>
<p>if it were me that would be the first thing i&rsquo;d look for.</p>
<p>i agree with the other comments. gradients = bad and so on&hellip; maybe there&rsquo;s a better way of visualizing night/day than a gradient (if that IS what you were trying to do and not just be &lsquo;cool&rsquo;) keep pushing.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I question somewhat the value of this forum helping you on your application.  If I&rsquo;m wrong, please tell me, but I&rsquo;d think the purpose of the application is to assess your background and at what level you&rsquo;d enter the school. If we contribute too much to your final result, it kinda skews the school&rsquo;s perception, doesn&rsquo;t it?  Anyway, if I think back to my entrance portfolio for school, it was absolutely abysmal.  I&rsquo;m still shocked that I was let in.</p>
<p>In short, I would push yourself to create the best logo you can, but don&rsquo;t overdo it.  If you&rsquo;re only 16 or 17, you shouldn&rsquo;t be expected to design like a pro (or even close to one).  As someone pointed out, this is likely to be more a test of your thinking than your actual design ability anyway. That&rsquo;s what you are going to learn in school.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>@jonsel,</p>
<p>I see your point, though I disagree.. I think this forum is highly valuable and very helpful in my case. About the school&rsquo;s perception being skewed, maybe if I were to ask someone else to do the work for me, but I&rsquo;m not here looking for a handout; rather just a critique, some advice and direction. In the end, it will still be my own creation, the difference is that I took the time to apply independent research to create a better product. I think its fair game.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a competitive portfolio so they&rsquo;ll axe the worst&hellip; and that scares me to death! (Its all or nothing for me, Im 24, skipped out on college, and 2.0 HS GPA, so i need to leverage my artwork into getting accepted). Ive been drawing all my life so i think my fine art is pretty good&hellip; but im not really knowledgeable about logo design.</p>
<p>Bottom line is I would like to advance my knowledge as best I can in order to deliver the highest quality work possible at time of my review. Again, its competitive, so i&rsquo;m under the assumption my competitors are on design forums also. (Quite possibly even reading this =\ )</p>
<p>and @alum, Will,</p>
<p>i wouldnt doubt that for a minute&hellip; i self taught myself everything i knew that got me my current job (im in IT), but i hate it&hellip;! Kinda the reason im going back to school. Trying to get a decent paying job in NY without a degree is almost impossible! (i got lucky)</p>
