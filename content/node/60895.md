  font on some random generator site, but he cant remember where or the font name.
  I'm going to use it as the basis for a logo for kickdrum, amps, etc. Anyone have
  any idea what it is? I need it for stencils, presskits, etc.\r\n\r\nAll the \"Font
  identifier\" sites have epic failed me on this one. Im stumped completely.\r\n\r\nAll
  help is greatly appreciated."

    Stone Serif Phonetic IPA]].\r\n( Well, partially of course, the original is much
    more extensive. )"
