  body: Thanks for your comment oldnick it realy looks similar, especialy the "a"
    and the "g". But the upper stroke end of the "c" is not ball pointed, the bowl
    of the "r" is bigger and rounder, u and d have diagonal cut serifs, the t is much
    higher, the W has a pointed bottom. Maybe it could be a custom version of the
    romana ultra cut http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/urw/romana/t-ultra/ ?

  body: "This looks very close to an old FontBank font called <a href=\"http://www.buyfonts.com/value_for_money/delavan.htm\">Delavan</a>,
    which I had noted was approximately Romana Black. There is probably a QBF version
    of Romana (who know what they called it -- Maybe Mike F. would know) that may
    give a full range of Romana versions, beyond the six that URW/E+F/Linotype show.\r\n\r\n-
