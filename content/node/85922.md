body: "Hi,\r\n\r\nI'm designing a book which heavily references the late 70s/early-80s,
  particularly European trends during that time. I was a wee baby in the early 80s,
  and my print archive has very little from that period. Plenty before and plenty
  after but during that period is a bit of a blind spot.\r\n\r\nI think the body of
  the book will be set in sans serif type, but I'm not sure what was popular then.
  Image searches reveal a lot of Avant Garde for headlines/display but I'm not going
  to set page after page of text in it.\r\n\r\nIf anyone was designing a lot of books
  then, what faces were they using? I'm guessing Univers was popular, but anything
  else used a lot then would be great to know about. Am I wrong and should be looking
  at a serif face? \r\n\r\nAny thoughts/contributions would be most welcome.\r\n\r\nThanks"

  body: "Trends in music and art particularly. Think early electronic album covers,
    art publishing, magazine design. Is that a bit more help?\r\n\r\nI'd be interested
    in a specific version of Helvetica, a cut closest to photo-letting perhaps, if
    such a thing exists. Straight out of the box Helv Neue has become a bit of a genre
    spanner, to quote the Mighty Boosh."

  body: "Designers in the 70s and 80s sometimes used Optima as a book face. They felt
    the mix of thin and thick strokes made Optima easier to read than standard sans
    serifs with their uniform stroke weight.\r\n\r\nDesigners may have also liked
    Optima because it was designed by Hermann Zapf, whose Palatino was incredibly
    popular as a book face in the 70s and 80s."

    for the Optima tip as well. I might mix serif and sans, Palatino is really nice,
    haven't used it on a commission before.\r\n\r\n"

  body: "The faces I used then have not generally proven to be era-specific.\r\nFor
    instance, News Gothic, Univers, Futura and Helvetica all span many decades in
    popularity.\r\n\r\nAvant Garde and Eras would be more time-trapped.\r\nBut be
    sure to set Eras so tight it's practically illegible!\r\n\r\nHowever, the real
    trick to conjuring an era, or addressing its typographic personality, is not just
    selection of a typeface, but considering its implementation in layout.\r\n\r\nHere's
    a book layout by Paul Rand, from 1985, using Univers Bold:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Rand_4907.png]\r\n\r\nNote
    how Nevile Brody used Univers in the most influential style magazine of the era,
    <em>Face</em>, with Times as main body:\r\nhttp://80scasualsblog.blogspot.com/2010/07/face-magazine-aug-1983.html\r\n\r\nhttp://thefacearchive.tumblr.com/"

  body: "Thanks Nick, always very helpful!\r\n\r\nYour comment is really interesting,
    and I've been considering the way I'd use whichever typeface I use for the job
    and how I can evoke the time frame I'm referencing from the start of the job.
    I think I'm heading for Univers after a few test spreads so it's really nice to
    see the example of Paul Rand's use of it in bold.\r\n\r\nThanks again Nick!"
