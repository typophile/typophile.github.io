body: "I\u2019ve noticed that the letter C is employed in a rather redundant manner
  these days. With K doing such a nice job for the soft C sound, who really needs
  C? We already have S for that. \r\n\r\nShould I include a C in my fonts in the near
  future, or should I leave him out?\r\n\r\nI think, I think so."

  body: "About 15 years ago, I created for myself an phonetic alphabet in which all
    unnecessary or redundant characters were either omitted or re-assigned new sounds.
    For example, the c became the ch sound. Backwards, it is the sh sound. I could
    go on...\r\n\r\n"

  body: Most people use O+hyphen anyway. But you should still include a Ccedilla and
    ccedilla because French & Portuguese languages do not employ the letter s . .
    . ever.
