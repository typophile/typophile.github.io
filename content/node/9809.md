body: Hello all, first post, newbie typophile. <BR> <BR>I am working on a lawyers
  business card and letterhead which uses Copperplate Regular true type version. I
  have been asked to find a fitting sans serif companion that is mac/windows available
  to be used as the body copy. <BR> <BR>Also, a script &#40;my inclination&#41; or
  other style font to be used in creating a monogram with the letters DRB. The client
  &#40;really a friend of a friend who owes a favor&#41; just wants something simple,
  no connecting letters or anything, just something to put in the background, a watermark
  if you will. <BR> <BR>As a side note, I have found great info here, and references
  to great reading as well, which is simply awesome. Thanks everyone.

  body: It depends on what you&#39;re trying to convey. For a strong, formal, traditional
    effect, try <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/bitstream/bank-gothic/">Bank
    Gothic</a> &#40;also see the E&#43;F version&#41;. If you want something a little
    more stylish, I&#39;d go for <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/ef/bernhard-gothic/">Bernhard
    Gothic</a>. <BR> <BR>There are a number of classic fonts, though, that I&#39;m
    sure would work. Franklin Gothic &#40;make sure to get a good version&#41;, Gill
    Sans, Frutiger, even Helvetica. <BR> <BR>For the monogram, may I suggest <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/snell-roundhand-script/">Snell
    Roundhand</a>. It&#39;s very elegant and formal, but still quite legible.

    is indeed Copperplate gothic without serifs. But it is probably too much alike
    to be a good companion.

    Gotham</a>, which has wide caps and is geometric might be a companion.

    g in there you might correct.&#41;

    I have much to learn, much much to learn. My friends friend will be so pleased.
    I actually have been playing with Snell Roundhand for the monogram, it was my
    first choice, now I have more, excellent. Best forum ever!

    shapes. Anyone have a suggestion, or somewhere to look for inspiration?'

    a combination of the supplementary swash capitals, heavy enough to work as a watermark/ghost
