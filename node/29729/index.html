Yes we are fully aware users provide this content. It is up to a website to provide functionality to manage this user knowledge- just like a wiki manages knowledge.

I'm sorry, the original post did not and does not mention the word functionality, and appears to invite "improvements and enhancements". Why shoot down ideas in a thread which invites ideas? If the original thread is worded incorrectly, please moderate or ammend it.</div>

Why does the critique section get the red-headed step-child treatment? Plus, there's a little section in there on "Typography" that has nothing to do with "typefaces on the chopping block."

Exactly! 

More links around to each of the heavily used areas too. eg:

Under "Home » forums » General Discussions" we could have:
 [ Post a new topic | My topics | Active topics ] and General Discussions, Design, Critique, Build, Release, Type ID Board, Special Interest Groups and to make it the BOMB you could have text links to the critique areas too. I know it seems like alot but it would cut the number of page loads I give the site by 1/2 to 2/3. And it would make me so happy!

Oh! And thank you very much for asking!

	<div class="card-body">
		<div class="commentbody">There are a number of suggestions not yet implemented that were in the 'bug' thread when Typophile 5 was in Beta. 

Some that I remember, in two categories:

NAVIGATION TO NEW POSTS

1. Have the page navigation at the top as well as the bottom. Many suggested this earlier including me; it is renewed above. I would think this would be easy to implement. 

2. Mark Simonson suggested to include in the 'all recent' results the categorization of posts by menu area. Addicts like me frequently use this as a button on our browser bar, and that category information would be helpful. 

3. Someone recently pointed out that clicking on the 'new' highlight on the right brings one to new posts--almost. It brings you to the last new post if there is only one page. Otherwise it brings you to the first page. If this were fully functional--bringing you to the first new posting in a thread--it would be a big improvement for the frequent visitor.

MENU IMPROVEMENT     

1. Eliminate sub-menus, so the all menu items show updates. How to do this while keeping the same number of menu items: 

1A. Combine the Build and Release categories into one top-level. (Release is much less active than Build.)

1B. Put all the Critiques into two categories: Type Design and Logo/Corporate ID. --The latter has many more postings than the other critique categories.
This would put everything on one menu level, and then show updates. 

2. (New suggestion) The 'special interest' area seems to have little activity. A possible better use is to make it one category: 'Typographic Education: Teachers and Students.'  

2A This category could have a 'Frequently asked novice questions' with answers at the top. Eg: what are best books and web sites for beginners to learn about typography and type design. 

2B This category could also have at the top list of 'Resources for teachers' list, eg links to the sites of teacher Mark Jamra, James Craig, Ellen Lupton. 

Of course, it would be good to have a mechanism for updates of both the novice student and teacher lists. Edit: perhaps the Wiki would be  a good device for both lists, and keeping them updated.  

I am not saying that all student questions should be shunted to this category, but those that are clearly asking for homework and term project help could be shifted to this category by moderators. They would still get help, but people could then choose whether they want to be involved in this--there have been complaints on this score before on a number of threads. 

CONTRAST

Oh, and one more. My pet peeve: put white or at least a lighter grey behind the text on the postings. Contrast (short of dazzle) increases readability. 

PS

If you have to prioritize to one or two improvements, in another week  you might put up a survey question what changes people most want. 

Oh, and Typophile is great. Yay hooray!</div>

No, of course they have a choice. I didn't put it well. What I meant is that people who don't even want to look at these novice questions--and several have written to this effect--would be free to ignore the whole category and spend not time on it. Those who want to help students could navigate there. </div>

The big -and I mean BIG- two:
1) Please fix the search/archives. Please. It's very discouraging
to type gobs for years and then not be able to access any of it.
2) Revive emailing of posts. If you don't want to (liability issues? I understand
I guess) then please make the RSS work for real real. If you don't do that either,
then in the Tracker please mark the section (like "Type ID") the thread is in.

1) Regarding search, allow us to sort the results by recency. I often want to find the latest posts regarding an ongoing topic or theme.

I think the "typography" section of Critiques would be used more if it were given more space. Currently, a lot of people post designs and things into <code>Forums>Design</code> for critique, rather than the <code>Forums > Critique > Typography / Composition</code> section.

Now, if you were to break off an entire forum just for typographic education, that might be a place to put it. I personally think it should be integrated more into the Design Forum, but hey, whatever.</div>

Yes, my proposal just reflects the reality of what is going on, and puts it upfront in the menu structure.  

The basic thing is that the forum sub-menus should be eliminated--it seems from the low traffic that they are an extraneous layer--one layer too many for navigation. </div>

I tried to get RSS working in the past, and the net result was having to install new apps that I never used, something that annoys me no end, so allow me to make sure by asking: is that a "master" feed that I can subscribe to once and get everything "delivered"? But if so, why would I still need the tracking page?

Also: is there a way to exclude certain subfeeds (like Type ID) from the master feed?

More than completeness (I no longer read everything) it's a matter of efficiency: it's a pain to manually subscribe to things when all I need to do is gloss over a given post (with its section name and subject heading) and decide if it's worth enough. Since interesting digressions are the norm here, individual posts are worth more than where they are.

		<div class="commentbody">I apologize if this isn't what you are soliciting, but I belive it is an issue that will have to be addressed eventually: Typophile has become a major information hub for type-related topics (Bravo!). In that role, it has to evolve to continue providing so much to so many. It's clear from other posts that some topics or threads are buried, and some are too prominent. It's also clear that some topics or headings are trafficked much more heavily than others. 

My suggestion is basically: re-organize the front page and "Forums" page to accomodate the changing uses we've discovered for Typophile. For example; I'd put Type ID, Free Fonts, Student Topics, Critiques, Designing Typefaces, and Using Type* at the top, most prominent, since they are the busiest areas that receive the most repeat questions. All critique areas should be handled the same, and it should be structurally clear that a critique posting should not go in any other area. Essentially I am saying: analyze how Typophile is used, and re-org it to make those pathways most intuitive, immediate, clear and distinguishable to everyone, not just lifer type nerds.

"Hottest", "Wettest", "Meanest" "Handpicked" or whatever could be underneath those basic categories, since they represent digested versions of all the different areas. Right now, there's some opacity in those lists since the latest poster and time aren't shown, so I find them less crucial to show at the top. 

I wouldn't suggest this if I didn't think Typophile was worth the effort, and again, I think this kind of evolution is inescapable. 

*Notice my simpler, clearer laymens' terms. Though they aren't considered industry terms, they clarify distinctions that we've all noticed aren't intuitive to all users of Typophile. For additional clarity, the taglines under each section can be more informative, literal, specific:

CRITIQUE
Submit in-progress designs for feedback

A chopping block might not mean the same thing in Romania, Greece, Venezuela and France.  ;)

The one thing I would add In a prominent place: "Type Selection Help", which could be everything from our lists of condensed sans, Garamond versions, Book types, Superfamilies, or whatever comparison tools people need to help them select type. There is a steady stream of posts asking for type recommendations, and it deserves its own area, complete with some methods of showing or linking to samples.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Agree with put navigation (for multiple pages) at the top. Furthermore, if you add a post to any page other than the first, it currently takes you back to the first page of the thread. I think you should be returned to where you left off.

For IM's - first of all there should be a way to reply to the IM without having to go to the bottom of the page. Second, they crop up 2, 3 or 4 times at the top of the page. Third, when you delete them it takes you to the Typophile homepage rather than the page you were on. Fourth, the space for typing is absurdly small.

I also think the "Logos/Corporate ID Design" and "Typography/Composition" don't belong in Critique - at least not as it is currently described (typefaces on the chopping block). For years I thought that section was only for feedback on fonts. I had no idea until recently that there were designs up there as well. I think this needs to be at least clarified if not changed.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">a couple suggestions/comments:
maybe since navigation is an issue, the bar on the right can have a floating div so that it stays put even when the rest of the page is scrolled up or down.
i miss the old front page and how dynamic it was in terms of typography with the type gallery. I mean Mercury is REALLY nice, but i'd love to see something fresh each time i visit the home page. i also don't like that i can't right-click links on the front page so in my bookmarks i link right to the tracker page.
Re answers to Frequently Asked Questions: There is already a [[FAQs]] section in the wiki, which i believe is a better place to house this type of information than a thread. There is no wiki page for [[Typeface Pairings]] (yet), but I feel that the wiki format is best for massing this type of info in a concise manner instead of having to dig through multiple threads, or even one monster thread to find relavent info.</div>

Great suggestion, will make reading through long threads much faster. 

I would propose additional thing that I used to on some other sites. Right now, "Last reply" column on forum page contains a link to user's profile. It will be much beter to change this to have a link to this last post itself.

No, it's not. I edit spelling and such all the time. But some people will say something jackass, have a ton of people reply to that effect, then change the original post so that the repliers seem way out of line. 

Recanting and apologising are different than making it seem that you never said anything dumb to begin with. I think it kills the spirit of some threads, that's all.
 
I meant honest more as a courtesy thing. We should each do it anyway when we edit for anything other than speling(sic), but some don't.

It's just an idea.

To me -quickly- changing your mind about something you've written is OK,

Is it a copyright breach to reproduce an article from a journal/magazine (or part of it) or part of a book (say, part of a chapter)? Even if I reference it, would that be ok? 

The same for photos: I notice people post photos from other website (I've done it myself a couple of times). Shouldn't we add the name of the photographer and the source everytime we do it or is that not necessary? I notices people upload other people's stuff a lot but I'm not sure this is a good thing.

Like you can't copy the whole thing, or even most of it.

And some authors will make trouble for much less. Like I remember encountering strong if civil resistance from Maxim Zhukov for the idea of sending somebody* a copy of a single table from an article he'd written for Typography Papers; this, even though it was from an issue no longer available for [direct] sale.

I don't off the top of my head remember the limitations on making direct copies under Fair Usage laws like you mentioned, but as I recall most of it comes down to common sense. Are you unfairly impeding someone's right to make a profit or to obscure an author's moral rights? Then don't do it.

This is a wierd part, because no matter what a person says in their copyright, or shall we say EULA?, others still have legally protected rights to directly quote or discuss a person's work, or to display an image of the object under discussion as long as it cannot be mistaken as the original source.

This might be ruffling some people's feathers, but I'm curious how that plays out in Fontland?</div>

		<div class="commentbody">My 2¢. I'm fairly new to Typophile, so please take my comments with a grain of salt.

My first impressions of the bulletin board were that it was very user-unfriendly, had minimal navigation, and no ability to follow (subscribe) threads that interested me. As a result, I would read the first few posts of an interesting thread and then forget to follow up on the the next day.

I belong to another online community called <a href="http://www.flyertalk.com/">FlyerTalk</a>. They use a great bulletin board in their fora that has many of the features requested by other users in this thread. IIRC the software house that created it is <a href="http://www.vbulletin.com/">vBulletin</a>.

Perhaps you'd like to look at the features it has to offer.

Regards,
Frank.

Why, when I post a comment, must I be taken back to the <em>beginning</em> of the thread?

I've already read the previous posts before replying; I'd much rather be taken to the thread's <em>last</em> post.</div>
