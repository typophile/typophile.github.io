body: "Dear Typophiles, \r\n\r\nFor a publication about Robert Slimbach, I'm looking
  for digital samples  (PDF, high-resolution bitmaps, high-quality photos) showing
  his typefaces in action. These might be book spreads, posters, newspapers, corporate
  identities or other quality typographic works. \r\n\r\nI'm looking for samples in
  all languages (not just English), both older (using the old Type 1 fonts) and newer
  (showing the OpenType versions), exhibiting both \"classical\" and \"original/inventive\"
  use of his typefaces, in particular his less known typefaces (i.e. not necessarily
  Minion). High-profile work, well-known brands etc. are also welcome. \r\n\r\nAnd,
  of course, I'm looking for works that I would be permitted to use in the publication
  (both print and web). \r\n\r\nAs a reminder, below is a list of Robert's typefaces.
  \r\n\r\nPlease contact me directly at adam@twardoch.com with the subject line \"Slimbach\".
  \r\n\r\nMany thanks in advance! \r\n\r\nRegards,\r\nAdam\r\n\r\nAdobe Garamond\r\nAdobe

    years in National Geographic magazine. A very nice example of Minion and Minion
    Expert on heavy paper, showing desirable ink gain (which also makes the face seem
    less narrow, to its advantage) is in the first American edition of Gitta Sereny''s
    book on Speer. The book shows adept use of all ligatures, small caps, and osf,
    and is also notable for the designer''s decision to turn the kerning off. A detailed
    description of the many modifications that have been made to the face over the
    years would be helpful. '

    German book, why on earth didn't they use Walbaum [Standard] or Prillwitz? \r\n\r\nKepler
    MM (Multiple Master) remains remarkable for being the most ambitiously flexible
    text typeface ever released. It is an entire foundry in one font! The range and
    depth of the axes is a stunning technical achievement.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, Kepler
    also illustrates the inadvisability of updating classics when the philosophy seems
    to have been, 'let's take 75% Walbaum but throw in a couple of distinctive ideas
    from Baskerville, a couple of inimitable Claude Garamond touches, a bit of Fournier,
    a bit of Didot' etc. etc. The result is a deracinated aesthetic that is not altogether
    persuasive. "

    attempting to stake intellectual property in metrics. But why assume Duden has
    a license? Maybe they do ... I hope they do ... they probably do ....\r\n\r\nI
    would expect the fonts to have different names ... as a matter of principle whenever
    I have modified a typeface I always put in the copyright notice copyright the
    copyright holder, modifications copyright by me. I don't think Adobe has ever
    claimed a copyright stake in its customers' modifications, but I can imagine others
    might. Whatever font copyright is, anyway. The copyright notice in a font is mostly
    wishful thinking as we know."

  body: Well, I would assume that Duden has a license. Of course, I can't verify it,
    but for a company like them, I would find it unusual to work without proper licenses.
    Also, has Kepler been bundled with Adobe design software? Like very many Adobe
    fonts, Duden could have acquired Kepler this way. But I don't know the history
    of Adobe's bundled packages.

  body: 'I don''t like Utopia at all, but the redoubtable Kathleen Tinkel found it
    very useful and always set one of her UNESCO magazines in it. I was going to make
    the same comment about William''s original note - - of course he is right, you
    have to see the font in mass. Also consider that the old, inferior optical instances
    of MinionMM have been substantially revised and improved in the OT ''Opticals''
    series. The overriding weakness of the font for me is the italic - - it seems
    clumsy set next to the cool, practical elegance of the roman. The overwhelming
    importance of Minion for me is the degree to which we can tolerate its slight
    compression. I don''t know of any design, other than Times, that does compression
    so comfortably. And all Times-haters would be are advised to remember that it
    is Robert''s favourite font. By comparison, I find Stone Print just a trifle too
    compressed, though I think its expanded cousin Cycles is one of the top two or
    three text faces of the PostScript period. '

    Robert's perspective, but it is inarguably worth investigating. He has great technical
    skills, and has produced a large body of disparate work, albeit of scant originality.
    But you could say some of the same things about Goudy. Just because Goudy now
    seems fussy and dated doesn't mean that he isn't worth thinking about. \r\n\r\n>BTW,

    was trying to do: he was trying to make a practical typeface that was as compressed
    (space-saving, green) as possible without offending the reader. In this he succeeded
    where everyone else has failed except Robert.\r\n\r\nTimes wasn't about the sublime,
    it was about the purely functional, and amply demonstrated Morison's versatility.
    For Morison truly was interested in the sublime, and directly engendered the printing
    of more sublime books than any other single figure in the 20th and 21st century
    combined. \r\n\r\nWho was it who said more pragma, less dogma? "

    And he succeeded. He just wasn't in a position to force-feed it on people. On
    top of that, Legato is something New, which is extremely rare and helpful.\r\n2)
    Times was fine when it was created (mostly because of ink gain), but it hasn't
    been fine for a long time. And Times was never sublime. And sublime (which to
    me has mostly functional and very little stylistic relevance) is a Good Thing.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
