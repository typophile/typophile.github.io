body: I want to find out how you guys kern. what do you think makes for good kerning?
  Do you look for specific problematic pairs of letters, or do you try to make the
  entire words themselves have even &#34;coloring&#34; or weight? Do you treat words
  first, and then their relationship within sentences? <BR> <BR>I need some experienced
  advice as how to best approach this. <BR> <BR>thanks!

  body: 'Are you talking about kerning existing fonts in graphics apps or fonts you
    are developing in a font editor? <BR> <BR>Assuming it&#39;s more likely the latter,
    here&#39;s what a lot of type designers do, briefly: <BR> <BR>Once you have your
    basic spacing set and things are looking good with unproblematic glyph combinations,
    you go through and find pairs of glyphs with problematic right and/or left sides
    &#40;A, L, T, etc.&#41; and then put these in your kerning/metrics editor amongst
    &#34;normal&#34; or &#34;control&#34; glyphs &#40;usually runs of H and O&#41;
    and add kerning until you get even spacing or a reasonable facsimile. As a reality
    check, generate and install the font and set some words, sentences, paragraphs,
    etc. in a graphics program and go back to the kerning editor if necessary. <BR>
    <BR>It&#39;s a pretty tedious task, so it&#39;s good to be as systematic about
    it as you can &#40;e.g., make lists or tables of possible pairs, etc.&#41; and
    take advantage of tools and shortcuts available &#40;e.g., Kerning Assistance
    in FontLab and FOG, class kerning, etc.&#41;. The thing NOT to do is just dive
    in and start kerning pairs at random or to attempt to do kerning before the basic
    spacing is worked out. I also don&#39;t recommend auto-kerning.'

  body: 'For each script for which I design, I build a set of spacing/kerning test
    words, ideally one example for every possible combination of letters. Note that
    this usually means using words from multiple languages: some Latin letter combinations
    are only likely to occur in transliteration of Arabic or other semitic languages.
    These words are sorted according to the pair they exemplify &#40;aa, ab, ac, ad...&#41;
    and I produce one version, using glyph names, for use in the FontLab metrics window,
    and one version using actual characters for making test documents in InDesign
    or Word. For bicameral scripts, I will typically have five kerning lists: lowercase-to-lowercase,
    uppercase-to-uppercase, smallcaps-to-smallcaps, and uppercase-to-lowercase and
    uppercase-to-smallcaps. <BR> <BR>I generally space a type as I&#39;m designing
    the glyphs, rather than as a separate step between outlines and kerning. I adjust
    the spacing as I go along, so that by the time I am ready to start kerning I have
    the spacing largely how it should be. Even so, it isn&#39;t unusual for me to
    adjust the basic spacing of some glyphs once I start kerning. <BR> <BR>I import
    my kerning lists into FontLab&#39;s metrics Window, and start working my way down
    the list. I generally concentrate on the specific pair that the word is included
    to present, but will also kern other pairs in the word if they are in obvious
    need of attention. This is helpful, because when I encounter them again further
    down the list I can confirm whether the kerning is good. <BR> <BR>Basic smallcap-to-smallcap
    kerning can often be derived from the uppercase-to-uppercase kerning values, so
    I usually export the latter as an AFM, globally adjust the values in a spreadsheet,
    change the names to reference the smallcaps, and import the values. Often, only
    about 20% of the imported values need to be adjusted to account for, e.g. difference
    of angle between uppercase and smallcap diagonal strokes. <BR> <BR>After I&#39;ve
    finished kerning, I generate a font, and print out my test word document from
    InDesign and Word. Then I go through it with a red pen marking pairs that seem
    too tight or too loose and that need adjustment. <BR> <BR>Recently, in some Arabic
    projects, I&#39;ve engaged in OpenType contextual kerning. This is not for the
    faint of heart.'
