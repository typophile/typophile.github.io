    all that many bytes to a file\u2014the pair itself and the value. As I understand
    it (and I may be mistaken), that\u2019 a whopping six ASCII characters, maybe\u2026"

    presumably, a lot more kerning\u2014than the font you are creating. The font file
    is 764kb in size\u2014relatively large, but not large enough to choke my Windows
    7 Pro 64-bit Grandpa Box\u2026"

  body: "What kind of kerning are we talking about? GPOS or kern table?\r\n\r\nA full
    kern table with 10920 pairs (the maximum that any application will use) adds about
    65 kB to a font file.\r\n\r\nFor GPOS kerning, it\u2019s not that simple to calculate."

    set in the Metrics Window, concentrating on\u2026metrics. Thoughtful spacing can
    eliminate the need for many kerning pairs; study Frederic Goudy's typefaces for
    examples\u2026"

  body: "In the latest updates of some of my fonts I have removed the KERN table,
    and used GPOS kern only. This saves, as Jens said, around 50kb per font.\r\n\r\nFor
    desktop fonts it's not necessary, but for web-fonts it's a great optimization.\r\n\r\nKeep
    in mind that web developers do everything in their power, and spend considerable
    effort, to optimize things (images, css, javascript, etc) saving every possible
    byte.  And not only bytes... they also optimize the number of request that the
    browser make to the web server (by combining multiple files in just one, for example
    sprites for images and creating only one JavaScript file containing all the code
    from multiple files).\r\n\r\nOptimized webfonts are always welcome by web developers,
    because the size of the files is an important concern in many situations.\r\n\r\nMore
    info about optimizations and performance here: http://developer.yahoo.com/performance/rules.html\r\n"
