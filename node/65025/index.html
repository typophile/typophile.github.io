  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Hi

I'm currently designing a TV brand for an ISTD project. I am looking for a typeface to be used on screen and for print.

After reading this thread - http://www.typophile.com/node/3413 it stated for maximum legibility on screen a typeface with a high x-height should be used.

So please recommend some san-serif and slab-serif fonts with high x-heights.

I have used http://www.neutura.org/Neutrino.html for my logo if this helps :)

Thanks in advance</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Ah sorry good point!

The brief is -
——————————————————————————————————-
We’re an international TV Brand. We love our drama, reality TV, films, soaps and niche programmes. We commission gutsy programmes and blend cool drama with our own lifestyles. We segue effortlessly from escapist, to gritty, to humanitarian, to sensationalist.

The picture is fantastic. What’s missing is the frame. We’ve lost our mojo. We are too passive – lost in the avalanche of brands (movies, adverts, sponsors, TV shows) screaming for attention.

We need to build a big, bold brand – to forge emotional connections with our audiences – to be open and compelling – rooted in truth and effect. We want to carve out a place in people’s hearts – be a challenger and express a clear point of view. We need to be more than expected – not just any other channel.

The Brief
We want you to develop the identity/look and creative direction of the channel.

Name
Channel X is only a working title – we want you to come up with a name that reflects the personality and values of the channel.

Logo
Create a logo that represents the channel. It can be live action, animation-based and it needs to have a strong, bold attitude that feels alive while being essentially typographic. This needs to be applied for on screen use and for a range of channel marketing materials and merchandise.

do
– create a distinct, expressive, cohesive, entertaining, exciting channel look.
– have a strategy that is driven by the proposition ‘stimulation for the masses’.
– relate the look to channel content.

don’t
– create typical logo idents that feel generic.
– create typical TV design.

Target Audience
Our audience
– love being entertained.
– are not affluent but have sophisticated spending and tastes.
– are articulate but not necessarily university educated.
– are 16–45 with a slight male bias.
– are a cultural mix.
– includes young parents.
——————————————————————————————————-

I feel the channel is trying to be like a mix of Channel 4 and MTV.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">It doesn't really match your logo, but I used to rely quite heavily on Poppl Laudatio for video/screen work - it's very good at that. It's not technically a sans, but its flares do give it great visual interest at larger sizes. However in print I would not use it for more than a couple of lines of text; for that I would find a font that matches Laudatio but with a smaller x-height (and perhaps not as wide). Maybe Pascal.

If you want something more contemporary and rigid, try FF Balance, which actually evokes "TV" to me quite strongly. It even has gentle traps, which would compensate for dot gain in video. Also, you could use it for print text, but still not long text.

Logo feedback in that other thread.

Unless you start digging into display type you’d be hard pressed to find a sans with an x-height small enough to impact legibility on screen except in the heaviest or most compact weights. The kind of small x-heights that effect legibility are found in serif designs like Centaur and Mrs. Eaves which really aren’t likely to get used on screen anyway. </div>

As for the typeface that goes along with it, shouldn't it be less curvy? Does the typeface behaves well along with the logo on those "coming up next" screens? 

Very interesting project, I'll keep an eye on this one.

<strong>lula,</strong> look around. it's one of many übertrendy generic block faces around at the moment. entirely geometric, not visually adjusted. yes they float, but they're (probably?) meant to..</strong>

regarding the original question, i think <strong>James Puckett</strong> summed it up in his post. it's really more about how you use it.

so the brief basically calls for 'original but mass-consumerist'. good luck.

That doesn't mean that - when you make a logo - you don't need to compensate for the typeface's shortcomings.
But see the appropriate thread:

BTW, the ends of the "bones" in your icon look like they're thinning out, because they haven't been optically adjusted.
