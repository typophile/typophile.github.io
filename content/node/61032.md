body: "Hi,\r\n\r\nHas anyone succeeded in defining the fields for sample text (ID
  19) in the name table and have it successfully validated by Font Validator?\r\n\r\nIt
  appears that when any arbitrary string is defined in the Macintosh part of that
  field (19 1 0 0), Font Validator will give the following error: \"E2015 The sample
  string contains a character that is not mapped in the font name string(1, 0, 0x0000,
  19), character at index 0 is not mapped.\"\r\n\r\nLooking at this error I get the
  impression that Font Validator expects the sample string to be identical to the
  font name? But this contradicts what the name table spec at http://www.microsoft.com/Typography/otspec/name.htm
  says: \"ID 19 Sample text; This can be the font name, or any other text that the
  designer thinks is the best sample to display the font in.\"\r\n\r\nI checked the
  name table of the generated font file with spot to see if something else strange
  has happened during the generation of the font -- specifically the first character
  of that field -- but nothing...\r\n\r\n\r\nThanks in advance,\r\n\r\n-Paul van der

    sure that's <em>not</em> what it means. My understanding is that FontValidator
    expects all of the characters in sample text string to be mapped in the 'cmap'
    of the font, as I think the original idea for the sample text string was to render
    the string using the font where said string resides."

    platformID 1 in TTF flavored OpenType fonts can be successfully validated by Font
    Validator, while an identical entry in CFF variants will produce an error. I have
    always considered this to be a bug in FV.\r\n\r\nOf course, it makes no sense
    to put characters in the nameID 19 string that are not mapped in the \u2018cmap\u2019,
    but I don't expect anyone to do this.\r\n"

    it seems strange that this error already occurs with a sample string of \u201Cabc\u201D
    in a fully functional font, right?</cite>\r\n\r\nYes, that's what I'm getting
    at.\r\n\r\nBut just to be clear: the rule that Validator purports to be following
    is to check that the characters in that string are mapped <em>in the cmap subtable
    corresponding to the string's platformID and encodingID</em>. So simply having
    the glyphs present in the font is not enough; for a Mac (platformID 1, encodingID
    0) name string, they need to be mapped in a cmap subtable with platformID 1, encodingID
    0. So if such a cmap subtable were not present or did not map those glyphs with
    the character codes in the 'name' string, that error could occur (and <strong>not</strong>
    be considered a bug in Validator).\r\n\r\nBut assuming you do have an appropriate
    cmap subtable that corresponds to the 'name' entry, I suspect the nature of the
    Validator issue might be something like an error in converting text encodings
    between the name string to the cmap or something like that (e.g. assuming Unicode/UTF-16
    but finding MacRoman,single-byte). That is really just a guess though. There are
    probably lots of ways that could get messed up :-)\r\n"

    a look at the cmap tables but it will take me at least a week of reading specs
    and disassembling fonts before I understand its structure. Not worth it.\r\n\r\n\r\n-Paul
