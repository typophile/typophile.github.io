  body: "Probably the font is first created as a clean version, and then texture is
    added in Photoshop. The texture is simplified to only be black and white. Select
    the letter with the magic wand and soften this selection, f.i. with a blur and
    use this altered selection as a mask for the the texture. There are also other
    ways to do this, but this seams the easiest to me.\r\n\r\nTo then create vectors
    out of this one can either manually trace it in Illustrator or use the autotrace.
    Results may vary, so one should experiment. If one wants to make this into a font,
    it should not contain too many nodes, otherwise it will cause problems in use,
    so one should probably clean it up manually. There are also other applications
    for tracing, which you could try. To make this into a font, you need a typedesign
    program, like Fontlab, Fontographer, Typetool, Glyphs or Glyphs Mini. Which one
    you choose depends on your budget, and the amount of features you want to use."
