  body: I need some help...  I have imported my font into fontographer as two seperate
    font files.  I have the font without the arrows kerned and spaced correctly.  Now
    I am trying to import the kerning and spacing information from the font without
    arrows into the font without arrows, but it is not working.  Can anyone give me
    a step by step break down of the process????  Thanks!
