  probably one of the last letterpress specimens \u2013 was released in\r\na limited
  edition, consisting of two volumes and an accompanying box with large format prints.\r\n\r\nThe
  project was started under the appeal \xBBbitte setzen!\xAB in summer 2008 by Munich
  Designschool (www.designschule-muenchen.de) in collaboration with the letterpress
  printshop \xBBFliegenkopf\xAB (www.fliegenkopf-muenchen.de). The ambitious goal
  was to create a specimen of the approximately 170 different typefaces of the workshop.\r\n\r\nFor
  photos and further information, take a look at this pdf:\r\nhttp://www.lazydogs.de/files/specimen/bitte-setzen_E.pdf"
