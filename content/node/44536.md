body: "Not sure if I'm just missing something but when I build paragraph styles in
  InDesign and apply them to text the style definitions are applied to the text. I've
  been able to then modify the style definitions (say change the typeface, size or
  color) and have those modifications appear in the text where ever that style was
  previously applied. \r\n\r\nHowever now I'm finding situations where I modify the
  style, but the text that already has the style applied does not change to show the
  modifications.\r\n\r\n1. I'm in InDesign CS3, but I've now had someone tell me its
  happened in CS2.\r\n2. The paragraph style doesn't have the \"+\" by the name to
  show that the text using it has been modified outside of the style definition.\r\n3.
  This is not text I'm cutting and pasting or placing from an outside source. This
  is text that I've created directly in the InDesign document.\r\n4. I don't have
  the file in question, but I don't believe there were any Character styles applied,
  though if there were, it seems it should only leave those characters alone, not
  the whole paragraph.\r\n5. Even though the changes don't show up, selecting the
  type in questions shows the correct style is applied in the paragraph style palette.
  Editing the style shows the changes are there.\r\n\r\nAny questions to help me figure
  this out I'd be happy to address. Thanks in advance for any suggestions.\r\n"

  body: Probably, maybe, you need to "Apply style, clear overrides" In CS2 anyway,
    you sometimes don't see a plus by the paragraph style name, but somethings don't
    take effect until you clear overrides. BTW, if you do this, any direct formatting
    you have done will be lost.
