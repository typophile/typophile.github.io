  used as the body font for Monopoly? Anybody who can name it ill be eternally grateful!
  Its a difficult one to chase up.\r\n\r\nIt has very distinct 'W's and '2's \r\n\r\nHere's
  a copy of a title deed where its used:\r\n\r\n"

  body: Was Kabel always used for Monopoly? I know the game came out during the depression,
    and Kabel was designed in the 20s, so that is possible. But the ITC cut didn't
    come until the 70s, and I played the game before that time. Were the cards of
    my youth in a different face?

    1957 to the late eighties.

    changed the face several times. Why choose Futura or Gill Sans when you have Kabel?
    Ill have to check when my set was made\r\n\r\n"

    versions, mine from the British... and of course Gill Sans was for many years
    the default choice for practically everything in the UK. I bet if I fish out my
    old Scrabble set, the rules inside the box lid'll be in Gill there too...\r\n_______________________________________________\r\nEver
