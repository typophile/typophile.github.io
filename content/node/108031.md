body: "Hello there. I am a designer and web developer. However, lately I found myself
  oddly attracted to typefaces, and I would like to create my own. I already know
  quite a bit about vector images and other tools needed to create fonts, but I would
  like to learn more about the actual designing process of a typeface:\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>How
  to maintain consistency between letters in a typeface?</li>\r\n<li>What features
  make certain letters easier or harder to read?</li>\r\n<li>What are 'standard' metrics
  and ratios used for different kinds of typefaces, and what are the pros and cons
  of each?</li>\r\n<li>What design choices were made in famous fonts like, for instance,
  Helvetica, and why?</li>\r\n<li>What features are important for a text font, and
  what features are important for a headline font?</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\nI am sure
  that there must be quite a few books or ebooks about these subjects. However, I
  have not been able to find anything myself yet only finding books about 'typesetting
  books' than books about typesetting.\r\n\r\n\r\n~W-M"

    I seem to be in a sarcastic mode. Am I missing your question here? I entered \r\n\r\n\"designing
    typefaces for the web\" in \r\n\r\nhttps://duckduckgo.com/\r\n\r\nThe third listing
    was actually about typeface design,\r\n\r\nhttp://vector.tutsplus.com/articles/web-roundups/how-to-design-typefaces-fonts/\r\n\r\nmany
    of those links might interest you, esp.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.creativebloq.com/computer-arts/create-text-font-fontlab-6108829\r\n\r\nTook
    about 3 minutes, with the first-try topic I searched for... (While I only bill
    $60/hr, I do have a 4-hour minimum. Where do I send the bill? I do charge when
    the asker is too lazy to make a simple, kindergarten effort)\r\n\r\nThe only tip
    here you possibly haven't seen is to use DuckDuckGo to cut down the incessant
    adds on Google when the topic being searched returns so many possibilities to
    sell you something... \r\n"

  body: "Hello mister Ellertson.\r\n\r\nI am familiar with DuckDuckGo, and I love
    it for its trackinglessness and its zero-click tools.\r\nI am very sorry to have
    wasted your time. I thought I was asking a valid question; in hindsight it looks
    like my initial search-queries were badly formulated.\r\n\r\nThe main reason that
    I created this topic was not to let other people search for me, but to ask designers
    who have been making typefaces for a long time on their opinions of must-read
    books about creating typefaces. I would rather have the opinion of a professional
    instead of '8 must-read tips about typefaces', if you know what I mean.\r\n\r\nThe
    article you link to is very interesting. Thank you very much.\r\n\r\nI also happened
    to come across <a href='http://typophile.com/node/12157'>this page on the Typophile
    wiki</a> earlier today, which was hidden quite deeply. It seems like a great list
    to pick some books from.\r\n\r\n\r\nBut if anyone else would like to share their
    professional opinion to offer on this subject, I'm all ears.\r\n\r\nThank you
    for your time and effort,\r\n\r\n~W-M"

  body: "Good for you, the Typophile wiki you cite is a very good place to start.
    Much better than internet musings.\r\n\r\nThe only thing I'd add, that shows up
    all too rarely, is the fit of letters, esp. in running text (rather than in a
    few letters or words, as found in headlines or advertisements). \r\n\r\nThe letterforms
    themselves, and how to draw them for various implementations (many ways to put
    ink on paper or pixels on a screen), are one thing. The fit of them in all their
    possible combinations, and the inevitable compromises that occasions, is something
    that just doesn't make it into print. Probably this is because because compromise
    is always involved, and compromise always means more than one solution is possible.
    As best I can tell, this is a skill you have to develop yourself, and for most
    of us, it does not come quickly."

  body: "You've come to the right place (even though so far you've only received advice
    from somebody who has never designed a font). It's only recently that Typophile
    has become sufficiently usable again, so hopefully you'll get some real help soon.\r\n\r\nThe
    thing is, a really good book on type design has yet to be written. But Cheng's
    \"Designing Type\"* does a good job of opening eyes. As does what we around here
    call The Triumvirate: http://typophile.com/node/15349\r\n\r\n* http://www.amazon.com/Designing-Type-Karen-Cheng/dp/0300111509\r\n\r\nMostly
    learning to design type seems to involve a great deal of observation, and a necessarily
    personal development of style. Just be prepared to invest a lot of time, with
    only a small likelihood of substantial material reward.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
