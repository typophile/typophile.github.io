  <BR> This is a basic lowcases-only font. <BR>One idea is to put circles inside as
  many letters as possible. Another solution i am thinking about is to put kind of
  a dingbats-like symbols. <BR> <BR>At the moment the numeric letters are missing,
  and i am still wondering how to refine v/w s and z.

  body: ' i dig the little things like the assymetrical m and w, but the the a seems
    gigantic. c, e, and o look smaller than the other letters that share the round
    shape. maybe make the counter smaller in b, d and similar letters? i like the
    alternate a at the bottom better. it feels more comfortable to me. f is cool,
    and i like e, but as i said, it looks small, and maybe could be slightly more
    related to the rest of the font. the crossbar in t may need to be a little bigger
    to aid recognition of it. at first glance it could seem like an l with a swoopy
    tail. as for z, you&#39;re on your own. '
