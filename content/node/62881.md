  on it. I know condensed fonts are for cramming more words in a spot, but should
  you use them just because you like it better than the regular version? Or do you
  only use them when you need something on 1 line and there are too many words to
  make it fit?\r\n\r\nAnd if you use both together on say a table of contents page
  or on the same page will that still look good or is that acceptable?"
