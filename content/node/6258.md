body: Hello, <BR> <BR>I was looking on the web to find a version of Univers which
  I encountered some time ago, called &#39;Univers BQ&#39;. I think this was a digital
  version from Berthold &#40;but now it can&#39;t be found on their new site&#41;.
  It was a superior digitalisation than the Adobe/Linotype one &#40;See also Detailtypografie
  by Forssman &amp; de Jong&#41;. And it had the original &amp;-sign!  <BR>I know
  there is something like the Neue Univers &#40;with the new numbering system&#41;
  from Linotype, but I don&#39;t like it as much as the old one. Could this old &#39;Univers
  BQ&#39; version be for sale somewhere? <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/30/4653.gif"

    many round shapes, you can substitute an alternate <i>a,</i> for instance, in
    a word like <i>page,</i> where you would otherwise have three circles one-after-another.
    Having read Hrant&#39;s pages, I would now say that this improves the Bouma. The
    alternative characters can break the pattern, and even substituting a single letter
    can radically change the look of Futura. <BR> <BR>There were originally several

    were you asking whether the Univers grid you referenced was an original? Hard

    <BR> <BR>I think that&#39;s probably close to the truth - we can probably consider
    that the experimental characters were exactly that, rather than something to be
    eventually used. <BR> <BR>I actually used one of the &#34;g&#34; variants in a

    - think about an ultra-black condensed!? <BR> <BR>I was reminded about something
    yesterday, about the Univers ampersand. I mailed Adobe about this a little while
    ago - you know of course that now the Adobe Univers is available as OpenType?
    Anyway, I remarked to them that a new digital Univers, without the &#34;proper&#34;
    ampersand, seemed like a missed opportunity to me - they could have had it as
    an alternate form. <BR> <BR>I don&#39;t believe it&#39;s been changed.'
