  place to start. \r\nI am a student in my final semester at college and working on
  a research project about Environmental Design. \r\n\r\nI am hoping you all could
  provide some suggestions as to Design firms that specialize in this area and would
  be willing to let me shadow with them for a day in order to get a better understanding
  of what goes into projects of this type.  \r\n\r\nI am in Rochester, NY, but I can
  travel if needed. If possible, you might suggest firms in the Philadelphia/Baltimore/DC
  area, or Denver/Boulder area, as I have friends/family in these areas who would
  be able to accommodate me. \r\n\r\nThank you so much for any suggestions or even
  a point in the right direction.\r\n\r\n-Karl"

    design is something else (although that is not to say someone here doesn't dabble
    in that as well).\r\n\r\nhttp://www.lib.berkeley.edu/ENVI/GreenAll.html is a place
    that might help\r\n"

  body: I am getting the feeling from the searching I have done so far, as well as
    your response, that I am not using the correct term "Environmental Design". I
    am looking for firms that do way-finding, signage, and maps.

  body: No, the term is correct but I think Don interpreted it as "designing in a
    environmentally sustainable way" - which is still an excellent thing to do. I'm
    not too familiar with any design groups that specifically specialize in way-finding,
    signage and maps in your area. In my experience it seems to be done by just regular
    design groups, not necessarily specialized. You may want to check with local museums,
    art galleries, etc. and see who they use. Good luck!

    jot down the various companies named. I\u2019m sure Paula Scher and Michael Bierut
    at Pentagram would love to have you drop by if you could arrange to arrive on
    a slow day."

    just because he\u2019s on their board. I know almost exactly nothing of Gericke
    or his work, and if either were interesting that would be true on their own merits
    independent of SEGD."

  body: I'd follow Joe's suggestion. There are SO many books available now which include
    the companies' information that it should be easy to find some. And don't forget
    to look at the major design magzine annuals as well.

    the $500 annual membership. Thank you all for the input though!
