  body: 'Can''t find a font that could match all design specifications (more at converse.com).
    So, here are only similars (as Heroic Condensed): [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/canadatype/trump-gothic|Trump
    Gothic]] (matching almost everything from /G, /K, /R to /M and /W except /J),
    [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/flat-it/rama-gothic|Rama Gothic]] (overall design
    looks OK but everything is almost off)'
