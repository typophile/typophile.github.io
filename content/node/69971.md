  looks compressed vertically, the \"G\" in \"CATALOG\" looks distinctive to me.\r\nWhat's
  the closest font to this?\r\nThanks in advance.\r\n--jim "

  body: "Well, when in Edit, I hit the \"file attach\" text string and attached the
    file....but I guess it didn't work.  Additionally, I realized as soon as I posted
    that this was the \"Posting Guidelines\" and not \"Type ID\" board, but a search
    of \"Delete Post\" didn't turn up any directions on how to do that.\r\nI'll try
    again with the \"file attach\" but over in the type ID forum *and hope it works
    there), and perhaps this could be deleted by sysops?  I'm really not going out
    of my way to crosspost."
