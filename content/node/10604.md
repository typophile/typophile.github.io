body: I just discovered this site about a week ago and have enjoyed reading the mostly
  honest and thought out critiques here &#40;It&#39;s rare to find that in most forums&#41;
  <BR> <BR>Anyway I thought I would take advantage of others experience and see what
  I could do to improve on this logo. <BR> <BR>The company is a small employment agency
  that wants to seem &#34;contemparary, national, and friendly&#34; She has looked
  over a few samples I provided her and likes this one, but I think it needs a little
  more, It does&#39;nt have much personality yet. <BR> <BR>Any suggestions, tips,
  etc... would be a huge help. <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/70969.gif"

  body: just for legibility sake, on the first one I can reed the &#34;g&#34; a lot
    better. As for the smile concept below it need maybe a bigger/different smile
    bellow. Have you tried to apply color to the 2 words?

  body: Option one seems to me to be the one to go with. You could make the g have
    a lopsided &#40;more to the right and tapered&#41; grin and curve/shape the ear
    or develop a two storey g. If you follow Adriano&#39;s suggestion of two colours
    you could kern the dp.

  body: I like it - I think it is simple and clever and very friendly. Don't be distracted
    by trying to prove it is designed. I think perhaps a weight change in single color
    versions would help and might give that tiny bit extra you are looking for. I
    would love to see what two colors you plan to use as I think that the branded
    image and trade dress will carry a large part of the personality as well. I am
    eager to see where you go with it. Good job.

  body: What's up with the spacing between d and p? You have such tight tracking that
    the space looks odd.

  body: "Voiceof,\r\n\r\nI just found this thread, and I must say I kinda like the
    logo. I don't know if I'm to late with my answer, but I'll do it anyway. The idea
    is good and it has a personality for itself. As a logo I think it'll work.\r\n\r\nMaybe
    try to take the 'serifs' (or how are they called?) off of the 'p' and 'd' to accentuate
    the circles more. The stems then connect directly to the circle without that little
    serif.\r\nYou have to re-space it a bit then and do some optical glyph corrections,
    but that might work.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\n\xAEen\xE9\r\n\r\n<strong>Also tired of
