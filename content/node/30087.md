body: "This is a bit off-topic, but since so many here use Adobe's Creative Suite,
  I think it's germane enough. Adobe today announced that sometime tomorrow, the Photoshop
  CS3 beta will be available from labs.adobe.com for owners with license keys of Photoshop
  CS2, the Creative Suite, and various Video and Web bundles.\r\n\r\nFor a quick taste
  of some new features, head to <a href=http://layersmagazine.com/adobe-photoshop-cs3-public-beta-preview.html>Layers
  Magazine</a>, which has a free series of video tutorials from Terry White. For subscribers,
  NAPP has a <a href=http://www.photoshopuser.com/cs3/index.html>CS3 learning center</a>.\r\n\r\nGleaned
  quickly from NAPP's info, here are some of the biggest new features in PS CS3:\r\n<ol><li>a
  new user interface (now it's more similar to that of the updated Adobe video products
  and Lightroom)</li>\r\n<li>a big evolution of Camera RAW</li>\r\n<li>the \"quick
  select\" tool</li>\r\n<li>improvements to Curves and the Print dialog</li>\r\n<li>a
  black-and-white conversion tool</li>\r\n<li>Auto Align and Auto Blend, which takes
  some of Photomerge's tools and makes them available to single photos</li>\r\n<li>many
  changes to Adobe Bridge</li>\r\n<li>Smart Filters (similar to non-destructive effects
  in Illustrator)</li>\r\n<li>improvements to cloning and healing (there's now a Clone
  Source palette)</li></ol>\r\n\r\nThis is just a cursory list. The single feature
  I'm most excited about is Smart Filters, as I'm all for a completely non-destructive
  workflow. I may chime in sometime tomorrow with my actual impressions of it, if
  I'm able to download it. I am incredibly excited by this news; I wasn't thinking
  that I would find out about PS CS3's new features until Spring next year!\r\n\r\nP.S.
  <a href=http://indesignsecrets.com/photoshop-cs3-beta-to-be-posted.php>InDesign
  Secrets</a> has some info on the beta release (but no features). The interesting
  thing is why they say that an InDesign CS3 beta in unlikely."

    to leave the PC users out in the cold like the did with the Lightroom beta.\r\n\r\nEDIT:
    And a terrific FAQ <a href=http://photoshopnews.com/2006/12/14/photoshop-cs3-beta-qa/>here</a>

  body: Looks pretty cool, but what's the deal with Intel only? I'm on a Mac at work
    and might give this a spin but I run a dual core AMD based system at home. And
    why won't they release a linux version? There are plenty of creatives who are
    a little bit geeky and don't like being locked. If I had creative suite on linux
    I'd never boot windows again.

  body: "<cite>And why won\u2019t they release a linux version?</cite>\r\n\r\nBecause
    they know that BSD Unix is superior to Linux, so it makes more sense to just stick
    with OS X, which plenty of Linux users graduate to eventually."

    still doesn't appear to be available from labs.adobe.com yet (unless I'm missing
    the link).\r\n\r\nEDIT: BTW, Thomas, do you happen to know of any updates to Photoshop's
    typographic features? I didn't hear of any changes to type or vectors on any website
    nor in screenshots."

    searching turned up <a href=http://www.adobe.com/cfusion/entitlement/index.cfm?e=labs%5Fphotoshop>this
    link</a> that should, once you've logged in with or created your Adobe ID, allow
    you to download the beta. Mine's downloading right now! Exciting times.\r\n\r\nThe
    news is that you can download and use the CS3 beta even without a license key,
    but then it's only for two days. With a license key, it's largely indefinite (like
    Lightroom has been)."

  body: "Photoshop still rules! I used Capture One/Pro one and found it made for photographers
    with little computer knowledge or care. It was made for studio volume processing.
    \r\n\r\nI recieved an email today from Apple for a trial download of Aperture..
    but it's Intel/Mac only.... I bought my Mac G3 about 2 years ago just to carry
    around for photography and now all I use it for is checking websites while watching
    TV because the I-Photo thing is useless. And Nikon's software while a bit better
    is about as useless too.\r\n\r\nPhotoshop it will be forever. \r\n\r\nand don't
    even f... talk about that crap I-Footo that comes with the mac that's for children.\r\n\r\nand
    the Lightroom is a bit light for me too. It seemed better than Capture One but
    I'll keep Photoshop."
