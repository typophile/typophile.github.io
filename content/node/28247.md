    a couple like that out there amongst the \"legitimate\" commercial fonts. I'm
    not talking about clones, but designs that show an unhealthy resemblence to established
    faces. Gal\xE1pagos Design Group's <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/showfont.cfm?fid=FF.11569.0.0\">New
    Age</a> for example, as well as their <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/showfont.cfm?fid=E.8014.0.0\">Extreme
    Sans</a>. And Garage Fonts' <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=verity.search&font_categories=1&font_categories_search=font_name_search&searchstr=veljovic\">Darwin</a>."
