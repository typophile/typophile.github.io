body: I'm having a problem finding how to use the Futura ND's old style numerals in
  InDesign; when I type in numerals in the normal manner in Fontexplorer's preview
  panel, they show up no problem; but in InDesign I just get regular numerals. The
  old style ones are there in the glyphs pane, and I could manually insert them this
  way but there's a lot of numbers to do; are there special key commands that I'm
  missing? Any help appreciated!
