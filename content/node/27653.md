  that you take the font size, muliply by some number (or divide) and then you get
  your leading.\r\n\r\nThanks."

    width, x-height, and other factors. Do what looks right in each situation.

  body: "Hi Billy\r\n\r\nStephen's right. There ain't no magic number.\r\n\r\nThe
    closest you might come to a pre-set formula is the (factory set) default value
    for auto leading in Adobe InDesign and Quark XPress \u2013 120% of the type size.
    In other words if you set 10pt type the leading will measure 12pt from baseline
    to baseline. That's only two points extra to the body size \u2013 almost certainly
    too tight for sans serif faces, and not necessarily ideal for the majority of
    the serif faces either; I advise my students NOT to use auto leading."

    or your font's x-height is very high or low. Always proof and adjust.

  body: I'd stay away from the 120% formula. There's no way that anyone can depend
    on a set formula, even if it "works" some of the times. X-heights, ascenders,
    descenders, style of the typeface, weight of the typeface, and the personality
    of the typeface are all factors. The secret is optical adjusting.

    leading is proportional to <em>a</em>, <em>d</em>, & <em>L</em>\r\n     <em>(meaning

    52 chars/line?\r\n   * at 12-point with 52 chars/line?\r\n   * at 8-point with

    Generally, some recommend more leading for sans serifs, and I personally think
    this is right. \r\n\r\n3. How loosely or tightly the letter and word spacing is
    also has an effect. \r\n\r\nGenerally, there are too many variables and with computers

    Just test it. \r\n\r\nOh, and leading is a critical factor in readablity, so all
    the more reason to test it in each case.  "

    to consider the specific typeface's rythm and weight (for example didones requiring

    think that a list for a specific typeface like the one that Michael suggests or

  body: Yeah, plus it depends on the layout - line width, page margins, etc. Just
    make sure if it's a multi-column layout that the leading doesn't overwhelm the
    gutter btw the columns. You also have to consider the weight of the type, serif
    or sans, and how dense you want it to feel.

    time to describe a method like this and really exemplify how the leading should

    of letters and the lines of space.\r\n\r\nThere are guidelines that tell you to
    have the linespace grater than the wordspace, but not having it too big or the
    lines will fall apart. But how does this translate in relation to the inner spacing
    and such? When is the leading too small? When is it to big? I would like to be
    able to answer these questions just by looking at the way that the different spacings
    relate to one another, but I don't know how to check this."

    as printed nowadays, capitals are usually only used for proper nouns, not for
    new sentences (which may mean extra space between sentences); \u201Ck\u201D is
    very rare. There are fewer tall letters, so less leading is needed."

    is willing to extend to. If there are limits there would have to be trade offs
    concerning font choice, point size, leading, margins. I do find that generally
    speaking InDesign's default leadings or Centaur work very well for book text and
    poetry. Historically there have been famous type and book designers who have not
    liked leading at all. But I think that works only in quite specific cases.
