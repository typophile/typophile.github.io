  License Expires\" in the attached image? It's from an antique Brooklyn liquor license
  I have.\r\n\r\nThanks.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/thislicenseexpires_font_5524.jpg]"

  body: "Overall design of [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/solotype/diablo|Diablo]]
    comes closer to me but you'd have to add flourishes \"\xE0-la-Ambrosia/Asteroid
    Primo\" and fix /S spine to match almost perfectly this design.\r\nNote about
    Diablo, quoted from its description, that could \"add sense\" to this suggestion
    and confirming the \"New York/Brooklyn connection.\r\n<blockquote>Diablo Light
    was originally called Fabric and was issued by the Farmer, Little & Co. foundry
    in New York.</blockquote>"
