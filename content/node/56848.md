  body: The sample is linked on the word 'logo'. The attachment for some reason wouldn't

  body: "I think this is a custom logo, and it seems to me that it may be based on
    a simplification of [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/adobe/bickham-script-mm/|Bickham

    for the shape of the z's.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
