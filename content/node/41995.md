  I was done. I would appreciate some feedback on the logo I made for my site:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/wwjdl_5335.gif]\r\n\r\nI
  wanted something clean and sharp that could be used in a variety of ways; printable,
  over complex backgrounds, possibly on t shirts & other mediums, looks good in black
  & white as well as other variations that include multiple colors. I also want to
  be able to add it to a new background image for the site to easily create a different
  look (sorta like the backgrounds on MTV's website)\r\n\r\nHere is a screenshot of
  how I'm using it as the logo currently.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/wwjdl2_6679.gif]\r\n\r\nPlease,
  let me know your thoughts on this. I think it's the first logo I've made that isn't
  crappy."

  body: "Are you being sincere or ironic?  I'm not trying to be obnoxious, but I honestly
    can't tell.  \r\n\r\nFrom a purely aesthetic perspective, I find the question
    mark to be very odd - it doesn't look like a question mark, and is encroaching
    on the L.  The huge pixelated arrow in the background is competing in space with
    the second \"W\", and the first Ws of each line are also competing with each other
    in a distracting way.   The \"wnload\" in color and style reminds me of Howard
    Dean's campaign materials from a few years ago, which is probably not what you're
    intending.   Instead of the font & image mashup you have here, I'd stick with
    one font for the WWJDL, and one for for the \"What would Jesus download\", the
    latter being in sentence case and italics.  Then you can use color to set off
    the \"wnload\" if you need to, although that just hits you over the head with
    the joke (which is why this reads as parody to me).\r\n"

  body: I think it's cute, but the question mark stands out immediately as being off.
    I don't agree with losing the L, as that will only confuse people when navigating
    to the site at www.wwjdl.com

    that the viewer has to read the mark as this first, then back up and try and figure
    out why the L is there. I don't know a synonym for download\u2014Rip?\r\n\r\nOn
    another note, I suspect you are in somewhat of a backlash against this whole concept.
    After \"What Would Jesus Drive?\" and \"Who Would Jesus Bomb?\" I think we've
    all had about enough of this deific speculation."

  body: "Well, from a quick glance at your website, it's clear you're not being ironic.
    \ Unfortunately, I think that your branding is off the mark; namely, it doesn't
    reflect the same intention as the other \"WWJ*\" messages.  What Would Jesus Do
    / Drive and Who Would Jesus Bomb both intend to make the listener apply a critical
    eye to his/her attitudes or behavior in regard to personal conduct, choice in
    vehicle or political opinion about military violence.  Do you intend to have people
    question their internet usage?  I suspect not, since your site seems like some
    sort of Christian portal.  Let me know if I am off the mark here.  Also, I want
    to second jupiterboy's observation that DL strays too much from the expected 4
    letter abbreviation.\r\n\r\nAs a result, although this may be slightly off topic
    or out of line, I suggest your reconsider your branding concepts behind the creation
    of your ID.  It is my view that, in fact, this is the most confounding factor
    in your process.  Since your starting point is unclear, I can't see how your ID
    could clearly express an unclear idea.  (Or the only thing that will be clear
    is that your idea is unclear ... but I digress)."

  body: "I think he's hit the nail on the head.  I like the \"?\" and the \"DL\" that
    reference downloading.  I like the font selection and stroke, but I would do something
    slightly different with the \"DL\" to drive home the point.  Maybe an outline,
    different color or try making it slightly smaller than the \"WWJ\"?  \r\n\r\nMaybe
    just try that with the \"L\".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n=====\r\nhttp://goscreative.com\r\n"
