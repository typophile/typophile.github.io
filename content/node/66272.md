body: "Hi Typophiles,\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://typedia.com/\">Typedia</a> could use
  your help. As more typefaces, designers, and foundries are cataloged, its missing
  pieces of reference information grow increasingly obscure and difficult to hunt
  down\u2014for the average visitor. You, on the other hand, have particular expertise
  in knowing, for instance, the Release Year or Country of Origin of a particular
  typeface.\r\n\r\nHelp build Typedia as a complete reference by participating in
  Font Fridays. Doing even just one <a href=\"http://typedia.com/good-deeds\">good
  deed</a>, then <a href=\"http://typedia.com/blog/post/font-fridays-lettering-and-type/\">leaving
  a comment</a>, can net you a new prize each week. This week it's a copy of <a href=\"http://typedia.com/blog/post/font-fridays-lettering-and-type/\">Lettering
  & Type</a>.\r\n\r\nDo a <a href=\"http://typedia.com/good-deeds\">good deed</a>!\r\n\r\nTim"
