  got these screenshots from a developer using my one of my fonts developing an application
  in Cocoa. This is a TrueType font, hinted in the y-direction. (Prob not hinting
  related, since this is on a Mac). The kerning is class based. I wonder if it should
  be flattened for a TT file, but in any case missing kerning is clearly not the issue.
  The strange spacing gaps are not in the font file, and I haven\u2019t seen them
  in any other application. The gaps kick in and out until 17 pt size, when everything
  goes back to normal. They also differ in intensity with various alignments (left,
  right or centered text). I\u2019m generating the font from Fontlab. \r\n\r\nAny
  idea what might cause this? \r\n\r\n"

  body: "Hi Frank,\r\n\r\nI have the same problem on OS X and it seems it\u2019s not
    related to a special typeface. I found this bug(?) some month ago, during writing
    a text in an App, where the System is \"responsible\" for kerning/spacing.\r\n\r\nTry
    out the preinstalled GillSans at 15 or 16 Point and 17 Point in TextEdit with
    the word \"Total\" for example, and you will see, that the \"To\" in 15 or 16
    Point isn\u2019t kerned correctly (to much space between). \r\n\r\nI think the
    problem is present in Snow Leopard and Lion (10.7.5.). Not sure how it is in Mountain
    Lion.\r\nAnyone?\r\n\r\n\r\n-Thomas"

    what they do different. Or, in any case, narrow it down to what causes the problem.
    My font works just fine in Textedit."

    system-wide."

    you assume this? Apple has managed to screw up its font handling at least twice
    since the release of OS X, if I am not mistaken. Apple\u2019s core mission (pun
    intended) now appears to be the production of boutique consumer electronics; Macs
    are no longer effective professional design tools, IMHO\u2026\r\n\r\nhttp://www.typophile.com/node/96562"

  body: Is this just within the XCode environment itself, or does the problem still
    exist when the program is compiled for use? Assuming the latter, UILabel doesn't
    use Core Text for layout, for the sake of speed, so I don't think it uses any
    kerning at all (regardless of whether flat or OT), but as you say, this doesn't
    explain the odd spacing. The UILabel class defaults to 17pt system font, so this
    may be one clue. But I don't have any clever ideas about why your font is working
    differently from the system fonts in this situation.

    has the most robust interface in terms of options for generating Mac TrueType
    formatted fonts. I do not have a great deal of experience in doing this and no
    experience with AAT, but I have managed to resolve system level complications
    (in the deep, distant past) by converting a font to the Mac .dfont TrueType format.
    If you do not have FontForge up and running I would be happy to run the basic
    conversion for you but note that it would be just that, with no AAT bells and
    whistles."
