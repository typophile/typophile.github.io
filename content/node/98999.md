body: "Hi all\r\n\r\nWhen customizing bullets in Word 2010 on a PC, Word will replace
  the bullet (U+2022)with a lower case o. This seems only to be an issue when the
  bullet is picked from an OTF-font. If picked from a TTF-font, the bullet works properly
  (I have tested a dozen OTFs up against the same amount of TTFs, all with the same
  result). \r\nNow, when producing an OTF-font, is there any way to solve this issue,
  other than, as I have done, adding a bullet with a different unicode value to the
  font?\r\nAnd would you happen to know why this issue exists in the first place?\r\n\r\nYour
  help will be much appreciated.\r\n\r\nWarm regards\r\nElias"

    method are you using to input the bullet character?

    Word 2010, I:\r\n\r\n1) Choose the bulleted list icon, then choose Define New
    Bullet.\r\n\r\n2) Click the Symbol button and set the font to the font I wish
    the bullet to be taken from.\r\n\r\n3) Choose the bullet glyph (U+2022) from the

  body: Have you tried selecting a glyph from an OTF font other than the bullet character
    itself in the Define New Bullet selection? I'm suspecting it will also not work,
    but it would be one of the variables I would try to isolate. The whole bulleted
    list mechanism in Word is a bit unusual in that the bullets are part of the formatting
    rather than part of the text, so it is entirely possible that the Word programmers
    included or inherited an assumption that the 'symbol' option source in this mechanism
    is a TrueType font.

  body: 'That''s not the issue, Nick. Elias isn''t trying to insert a bullet character
    in the text: he''s trying to get Word''s custom symbol for bulleted lists function
    to accept an entity from a PostScript font. He''s already confirmed that he can
    do this with a TrueType font, so the input mechanism for the bullet isn''t the
    problem.'

    CFF format is seriously flawed, no?

  body: I think it is more likely an example of how software developers have inherited
    code written by people who ignored PS Type 1 fonts in the past, and hence made
    assumptions about TrueType fonts as sources. In a case like this, I would guess
    that the symbol insert is somehow grabbing a TT glyph direct from the font's glyf
    table, rather than inserting a character code and mapping via the cmap table.
    So when it encounters a CFF font it can't find the glyf table and is unable to
    insert the symbol.

    the bullet glyph (U+2022). If I customize the bullet list with other glyphs from
    an OTF-font, they show just fine. This is also why the best solution I've been
    able to come up with so far is to add another bullet with a different unicode-value."
