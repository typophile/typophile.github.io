  some very groovy dynamic qualities...\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/h_x06_6175.jpg]\r\n\r\n...only
  problem is that I have yet to gain command of my new discovery, lol! \r\n\r\nThe
  brush has the ability to lay down a 3d-ish stroke that has some pretty amazing tonal
  and textural qualities. I barely have any idea on how much ink to load for a constant
  stroke. As you can see I have a long way to go, yeah.\r\n\r\nHope you don't mind
  me posting this most crude prototype. I'll post my developements as I get a grip
  of this thing.\r\n\r\n__________\r\nHiro"

    letter shapes, if that's the correct use of the term, I may have to let the brush
    interpret, yeah.\r\n\r\nhrant, nice link thanks - great to see a new artist, new
    to me anyways. D\u2019anastasio's (I did a little diggn'), work has an edge.\r\n\r\n_________\r\nHiro"
