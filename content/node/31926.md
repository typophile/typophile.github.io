body: "Hi.\r\nI am looking for a set of pictograms (restroom, arrows etc) that have
  a similar quality to FF Transit or FF Info pict. \r\nBasically something 'friendly'
  and well resolved, not too irrelevant or silly and not too generic (like the AIGA
  Symbol Signs).\r\n\r\nI seem to recall seeing a set of pictograms that were very
  similar to FF Info pict, though the symbols were outlined not solid.\r\nAny ideas,
  anyone?\r\n\r\nThanks."
