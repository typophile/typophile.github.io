  body: "You've just blown up the picture in the previous post, doesn't make any difference,
    really, to identifiability: It's a fairly open-countered sans with a straight-leg
    R. (Gotham? Usually is these days.) But then we knew that. The seemingly straight-ending
    C and S are vestiges of the extremely small size.\r\n\r\nMaybe detective work
    could help? Where did you find this?"

    distinctive C & S is why I want to find this font so badly. Gotham doesn't look
    like that at smaller sizes. "
