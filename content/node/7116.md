  body: Gah! Whatever it is, it&#39;s awful. However, you&#39;ll get a decent match,
    and <i>much</i> better draftsmanship, from <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/janson-text/55-roman/testdrive.html?s=FIGURE&amp;p=72">Janson
    Text</a>. Hope this helps!

  body: Another candidate is <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/paratype/kis-bt/">Kis</a>,
    which may be even closer in capturing the &#34;roughness&#34; of the original
    sample.
