  body: "Since there is no picture, I am forced to read your mind, which makes this
    experiment much more difficult.\r\n\r\nOkay, please concentrate on the image.
    Are you seeing it clearly? Please concentrate harder ... I need your cooperation
    if we are going to succeed.\r\n\r\nAh, yes. I'm getting an impression. I see a
    \"T\". Does that mean anything to you?\r\n\r\nIt's coming in stronger now. I believe
    I am seeing the words, \"Trade Gothic.\" Would that be correct??\r\n\r\n\r\nThank
    you ladies and gentleman."
