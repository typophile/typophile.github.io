body: Hey I'm working on a personal logo and I'm looking for an alternative to the
  Aaargh font by Tup Wanders. It's free but I'm not a fan of the CC License by Attribution
  tag it has. Most importantly, I've been looking for a typeface that has a similar
  lowercase a to the one Aaargh has. An example of what I'm not looking for is something
  like the lowercase a in Mank Sans by Manfred Klein. Any help would be much appreciated.
  Thanks.

    might be even better too.
