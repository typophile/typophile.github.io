body: Hello all. I've been working on a book, medium, and bold version of this font
  for some time now and I need to get some fresh eyes and opinions on it. It's sort
  of a hybrid of Avenir, Futura, Gotham and well, any other sans-serif you think it
  may look like. (the x-height is Helvetica) I've poured over this thing for a while
  now so if there's any changes you'd make I'd love to hear it. Thanks.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/aero_specimen_6354.gif]

  body: "Hi Galen\r\nThis looks really nice so far, with some subtle idiosyncrasies.
    The overall proportions are very pleasant and your optical correction is pretty
    good in that it appears monoline. There are a few bits that I'd polish even more,
    but take my words not too seriously as I'm only a beginner...\r\nI'm looking at
    the book weight.\r\nC may need a hair more weight at 9 o'clock.\r\nCrossbar of
    F is usually a slight bit lower than on E (because the bottom stroke of E is not
    there to eat into the counter).\r\nThe straight section of G isn't quite decisive
    enough...looks like it's not sure whether to be straight like Gotham or round
    like Avant Garde. I'd go with Gotham.\r\nJ is quite wide and the curve seems maybe
    to need more smoothing into the stem. \r\nM and N have noticeably different overshoots
    at cap line.\r\nBar of Q could be a gentler slope; it looks a bit too far right?\r\nS
    is not quite smooth.\r\nV and W need more overshoot at the baseline. Z and z may
    need a slight bit more weight on the horizontals.\r\n\r\nhm and n need the top
    of the arch (outer contour) moved right. m, r and ntilde need the spur to be the
    same as n and p. \r\ns is falling backwards.\r\nI like u without a spur. v and
    w need overshoot.\r\n\r\nNumerals are good shapes! I think 2 needs some smoothing.
    Counter of 4 is quote small. 5 looks a bit bottom-heavy. \r\n\r\nAsciitilde may
    be a bit light. ae doesn't usually have the a's spur. Placement of acute and grave
    accents needs checking (acutes further right, graves further left).\r\n\r\nVery
    nice overall, keep going! :)"

    they are in the same genre. But it''s clearly not copied, so I don''t see the
    serious trouble! '

  body: "Thanks Bendy. A lot of good stuff there. Some of your comments were things
    I had in the back of my mind but wasn't sure about. (overshoots, falling S, etc.)
    I'll get back with some alterations. \r\n\r\nAnd I'm glad to hear that Aero shares
    some characteristics with such a nice typeface. Thanks for the compliment!"

  body: "Looks like you're on the right lines! I think you've got the arch of h and
    n right, it's looking much stronger. I'm slightly wondering if the right hand
    extrema of those curves should be a notch higher?\r\nI like this :)"
