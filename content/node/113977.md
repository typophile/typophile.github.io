  every online type identifier has failed to identify this font. \r\n\r\nI tried to
  suggest choosing a more refined font, and came up with some alternatives. \r\n\r\nNaturally,
  my workplace wants to use this font for their taglines; however, someone long ago
  converted all the existing text into outlines. Also, of course, none ever created
  a style guide or anything that names the font that survived the migration to the
  new servers... and almost everyone who was here at that time is now gone. \r\n"
