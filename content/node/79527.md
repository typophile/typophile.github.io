body: "Hi everybody,\r\n\r\nI was recently asked to write a short article about typography
  (readers will mostly be graphic designers) for a new journal dedicated to posters,
  initiated by local designers. I've decided to present the Roman Scherer types as
  they're fascinating, Swiss and obscure. I remember seeing a beautiful specimen when
  I was studying in the Hague at the TypeMedia Master course.\r\nThe idea was of course
  to complement the article with scans of a Roman Scherer specimen. The article focuses
  on polychromatic types and I'm looking for some scans. The designer I know, who
  kindly offered me to scan pages the specimen he owns, can't find it anymore unfortunately.
  I have to find illustrations by the end of this week! I contacted the St Bride Library,
  as they have one specimen but only with monochromatic types\u2026\r\n\r\nI'm wondering
  if someone, a lucky Roman Scherer type specimen owner, would be willing to help
  me with this project. There's no money, all I can offer are copies of the journal
  and a selection of stunning swiss chocolate.\r\n\r\nOnline samples:\r\n1. http://amassblog.com/?p=127\r\n2.

  I traced from the second online resource:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Poster-articleRomanScherer-illustrationP_5359.png]"
