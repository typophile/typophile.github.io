  while I was still in my 2nd year. It was a simple sans designed to understand the
  basic proportions and how the letters work together. But now I have made some changes
  to give the design a new look. \r\n\r\nI would really appreciate if you guys can
  spare some time and mark me some feedback on the design. I want this face to work
  in the text as well as in display settings.\r\n \r\n\r\nThanks a bunch,\r\nSatya\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Hi Sayta, I like the 'square curve' thing as for example in 'g' or 'y' and
    I think that it works remarkably well in text sizes. Just a few remarks/things
    I noticed:\r\n\r\n\u2022 Make vertex in 'M' the same as in 'V' or apex in 'A'\r\n\r\n\u2022
    'S' and 's' still leaning back\r\n\r\n\u2022 Lower the connection on stem 'r'\r\n\r\n\u2022
    Liked first spur solution of 'G' better\r\n\r\n\u2022 'Y' a bit wider\r\n\r\n\u2022
    Make top 'J' as 'f'\r\n\r\n\u2022 Inkttrap solution for tail 'Q' ?\r\n\r\n\u2022
    Bottom stem of 'd' and 'u' like 'a' or 'l' ?\r\n\r\n\u2022 Slash (/) too bold
    (backslash seems better)\r\n\r\n\u2022 '!' narower at bottom\r\n\r\n\u2022 Not
    sure about 'K' and 'k'\r\n\r\n\r\nThese (short) bullets read a bit harsh but they
    are just what I would do ... absolutely not binding :) "

    unordered list :)\r\n\r\n'S' is better, but it seem to lean a tad forward now.\r\n'G'
    is great.\r\nI like the first 'J' better.\r\n'M' is fine\r\n'Q': tail maybe a
    bit the left?\r\nI like the second 'd' (also 'u') most\r\nNice improvement on
    'C'!\r\nThink second 'r' is better. Top maybe a bit lighter\r\n\r\nMaybe for K/k
    you could consider a solution like this very rough sketch:\r\n(K should be broader.

    seems a little distracting  too in smaller sizes, especially when printed out.
    \r\n\r\nAlso I wonder if the lowercase 'e' should run slightly over the x-height?

    at Linotype, Germany, most of the things I learnt while in those three months.
    It was an amazing learning overall.\r\n\r\nWhich lc 'y' are you talking about?
    Because I have already changed the previous one in the recent updates. Although
    I liked it but since it was affecting the texture, I had to change it.\r\n\r\nI
    have kept the overshoot same throughout. Does it looked lower in the 'e'?\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/ee_5328.jpg]"

    one with this version, and another with the earlier, to take a call. \r\n\r\nThe
    earlier version (without the curved descender) had a certain edginess which matched

    from the readability point. "
