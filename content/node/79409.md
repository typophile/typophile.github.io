  period maps. One that I have hanging on my wall is an 1857 Map by a cartographer
  called John Blair. The map is labelled by hand and I am trying to find a commercial
  typeface which approximates to the style used by Blair. Note the very long serifs
  on the capital letters.\r\n\r\nI've looked and looked for a typeface which might
  be similar but with no luck. \r\n\r\nCan anyone help? \r\n\r\nMany thanks in advance!"

  body: Thanks Renko, page bookmarked in case I need that style of typeface, but this
    one is different (but also engraved). It was interesting reading Nagel's account
    of the problems he ran into trying to make the font, as I am running into exactly
    the same problems too!
