		<div class="commentbody"><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Aren't we visual communicators?<!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->In application, that is often a very bogus term, since much of what graphic designers do is not communicative at all; it is at most evocative and even then tends toward the hopeful rather than the proveable: one hopes that the choice of colour and arrangement of elements <!-- raw HTML omitted -->suggests<!-- raw HTML omitted --> something to the viewer that will evoke the desired response. This is not communication. Communication is the transfer of an <!-- raw HTML omitted -->idea<!-- raw HTML omitted --> from one mind to another, measurable by the accuracy of the transmission. Despite the barrage of visual imagery in our society, the vast majority of communication is still linguistic, either verbal or literary. The only true 'visual communicators' are people who work with information design systems, which codify mental concepts using symbolic equivalents.</div>

Just because it is easier to measure word transmissions does not mean they communicate any more effectively than visual transmissions.  As humans, we tend to give greater value to things we can easily measure.  We call this data so it sounds oh so scientific. We don't want to point out the shortcomings of the human race so we ignore things we have no data for.  One day when we are smart enough to figure out how to measure more abstract things, they will suddenly become valuable.  Until then we just focus on only the data we have been smart enough to collect.  Was it as easy to measure the communication that took place in the nonverbal video of the Rodney King incident? Not easy to measure.  Was there visual communication taking place? You dag gum betcha.</div>

That said, it's highly useful -and necessary- to consider <!-- raw HTML omitted -->concepts<!-- raw HTML omitted --> as being pure. For example pure Art is when you create something motivated only by the need to express yourself - which of course never actually happens. But there is some Art in any act of design. The key thing though is that -for the act to cross a certain threshold into Design- this need to express has to be an unintended, or at least an undirected, force, emanating inescapably from your human-ness, sort of <!-- raw HTML omitted -->in spite<!-- raw HTML omitted --> of yourself. For example, if you make an upright Italic simply because you've &quot;always wanted to&quot;, or if you believe that  design comes from the urge to create, then you're being mostly an Artist; mostly selfish. Design comes more from a desire to <!-- raw HTML omitted -->serve<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt; we tend to give greater value to things we can easily measure. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Very true.

When I make a painting, even a digital one, it is Art (or fine art (it doesn't have to be good to qualify)), the making of a fine peice of design is an art.  If your the making of your designs is an art then you are a good designer, if your paintings hang in a gallery you are an artist. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->John,  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt;&quot;There is no grammar of visual imagery, there is no syntax, there are no rules of morphology: there is nothing in it that makes language language.&quot; <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I have to disagree with you.  Of course it all depends on the definition of the word language, but assuming it means something along the lines of a system of comunication that is agreed upon by the group of people that use it, then images certainly have a linguistic properties, with a full grammer and syntax. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Taking line drawings as an example.  What does the line represent? In simple line drawings, it is commonly agreed (it's grammer) that a line represents an edge or division. This is arbitrary, it is a social construct.   <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Conventions of perspective are another grammer of imagery.  From full on renaisance three point perpsectives, to cubism, to simple drop shadow. They are all grammers necessary to show how objects ought to be arranged by our mind when we percieve the image. Perhaps analagous to word order in a sentance. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I would go on to argue that nearly all qualities of images are subject to conventions such as these.  Even in photographs. Even the use areas of light or dark colours to show shadows and highlights. This is essentialy linguistic, in that they need to be agreed before being understood. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Abstract painting is intersting in this respect, but I would say subject to the same rules.  Abrstact Expressionism seems to me to have been built on a fraud, at least as far as its emotional content is concerned. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Ed. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->ps.

If you called me a gazelle, i'd hafta laugh, i'm not that fast; if you called me a cornflake i may be offended because i can be a bit flighty&hellip; one of the greatest features of symbols is that they don't mean &quot;exactly&quot; anything. there is a certain amount of &quot;play&quot; where a symbol can be more literal or more figurative. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Words can be just as arbitrary as visual symbols. In a class on lanugage and culture the story was told of a fire that was started in a factory that all began when a sign was misread that said &quot;Empty Gas Drums&quot;. Knowing the outcome, i'm sure you know what that meant, but those at the factory understood an entirely different meaning. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->John, i think it's humorous that you're championing language as a superior communicator of ideas in a thread that is basically an argument between the meaning of (verbal) terms. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I am fascinated by verbal language. I believe there's good reason to call the study of it language arts. i think it's beautiful to be able to choose words as an artist would choose her pallette to convey different shades of meaning, but in the end it is the reader who decides what the text means, no matter what the author intended it to mean. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->that's why i think making a distinction between &quot;designer,&quot; &quot;artist,&quot; &quot;communicator,&quot; etc. is bunk. to me. these terms overlap but have slightly different meaning, but you could choose any one and i think i would get the general understanding of what you are trying to convey - so call yourself what you want.</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><!-- raw HTML omitted -->I have to disagree with you. Of course it all depends on the definition of the word language, but assuming it means something along the lines of a system of comunication that is agreed upon by the group of people that use it, then images certainly have a linguistic properties, with a full grammer and syntax.<!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->But that is a very superficial definition of language that completely ignores the seminal importance of language in cognition and self-consciousness. Language, to a very large extent, makes us what we are as human beings, while visual arts at most contribute to what we are as members of particular cultures. So, above, Bill makes some comments about associations with colour, e.g. death, marriage, but these are specific cultural associations, and make even this level of 'visual communication' increasingly problematic in multicultural societies. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted -->John, i think it's humorous that you're championing language as a superior communicator of ideas in a thread that is basically an argument over the meaning of (verbal) terms.<!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->That's not nearly so humourous as the idea that we might have such an argument without words, but this is what the fantasy of 'visual communication' would suggest: that I could post a graphic that would make a point, and all the rest of you would post graphics making contrary points and refining previous graphics, and that this would constitute a conversation in a sense even remotely similar to our verbal exchanges. Because communication is not limited to a one-way transmission of information from source to recipient: it is the beginning of dialogue. One-way communication is the specialty of totalitarian and other repressive regimes, which it should be noted, favour visual and emotive media &ndash; notably film and television &ndash; over the textual and the reasoned (books, newspapers, journals, Internet discussion groups). <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->One-way transmission is also, of course, the primary characteristic of television and of most advertising, which assumes an unequal relationship between the power of the seller to persuade and the inability of the consumer to resist or even question whether he actually needs the product. This is the sort situation in which 'visial communication' is effective: the manipulation of emotive response, usually ending in a credit card transaction. And this is why I do not consider it true communication, because ideas are actually anathema to the process, because ideas are generative and lead to other ideas, especially in the context of dialogue, while advertising and totalitarianism only want to put <!-- raw HTML omitted -->one<!-- raw HTML omitted --> thought in the recipient's mind: buy this, assent to this&hellip;.</div>

Your remarks about why &quot;visual communicator&quot; isn't valid makes sense to the left side of my brain, but my right side has turned a deaf ear. Paul used the term &quot;problem solver&quot;.

		<div class="commentbody">I've been arguing, perhaps over-strenuously, against 'visual communication' because I think it is something that too many people take for granted without really analysing, and also because I believe language is of an order of communication many times more sophisticated, more adaptable, more generative, than anything possible in visual, non-linguistic modes. But this is in part because the kind of communication that interests me is communication of <!-- raw HTML omitted -->ideas,<!-- raw HTML omitted --> and I'm quite strict that communication, properly understood, requires a significant identity between the message broadcase and the message received, which I don't think is reliable in visual media: heck, it is often difficult enough with language, which is why most effective communication involves a two-way transmission that clarifies meaning via discourse.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->There is, obviously, a common and less rigourous use of the term 'communicate' that is often applied to the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->impression<!-- raw HTML omitted --> that we get from a visual cue, such as a particular arrangement of form and colour in design, a gesture or facial expression, or, as Hector notes, the way someone is dressed. I think Erik Spiekermann is correct when he says 'We cannot not communicate', <!-- raw HTML omitted -->if<!-- raw HTML omitted --> that is understood to mean 'We cannot not create an impression'. And most graphic design is about creating impressions (often false ones, it must be said). Impressions are important: what psychologists call 'thin-slicing', rapid intuitive judgement or inductive reasoning based on very short exposure &ndash; the proverbial first impression that is often correct &ndash; is an important method for navigating through life. And what is characterised as 'visual communication' is an attempt to exploit this method by creating specific impressions, usually based on cultural associations. But I still don't think you can get away from two factors: 1) the necessary correlation between what is broadcast and received, which is the basic measure of <!-- raw HTML omitted -->successful<!-- raw HTML omitted --> communication &ndash; if the impression your design creates is not the impression you intended or hoped for, is it really communication? or is it a purely unilateral action on the part of the viewer? &ndash;, and 2) the range of impressions it is possible to suggest are incredibly crude and small in number compared to the range of complex ideas that can be communicated through language. This is why the language of advertising people tends to rely on broad and vague  notions &ndash; we want this to look elegant; we want something playful; it needs to be dynamic; etc. &ndash;: because the kind of impressions one can 'communicate' visually (inspire, really) are that crude. Thinking about Erik Spiekermann's dictum again, one can say even that design primarily creates one of two impressions: 'We suck' or 'We don't suck'.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Psychologist Karl Buehler said that there are three levels of language. First expressive-Ouch!; second communicative - run!, third descriptive - take your third left and you will see the train station.  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->The idea is that the later levels presume the earlier. Popper added argumentative - no, it's the fourth right, not the third, because they've moved the station entrance. Language can operate on the descriptive and argumentative levels in a much richer way than others.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->But, John, when it comes to expressive and communicative levels, the visual and aural and smell and taste can do heavy lifting. Just think of how much of a movie's success is dependent on the actor's expression and tone of voice and body language. Yes, you often can't follow the plot of a movie without subtitles of a film in a language you don't understand. But dubbing destroys so much of the impact of a film compared to the tone of voice, even when you don't understand the words. As to vision, just substitute Miss Piggy for Marilyn Monroe, and you are going to get a different film, even with the same words.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->With graphic design, the non-verbal elements are very important. Part is communicating heirarchy through visual relationships, as well as other conceptual relationships through visual relationships. And of course making sure words are easily readable - not easy in small sizes. And part is emotional tone and mood through color, use of space, illustration, photography.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->It seems to me that a great graphic designer adds that emotional punch as well as clarity. To carry the metaphor further, you need a screenplay, but the screenplay isn't the movie. The great graphic designer is like a great director, and can turn the words into something more powerful than words alone.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I am a writer and love language, words, books - and even letters! But I know there is more to life, and graphic design is part of that more.</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><!-- raw HTML omitted -->But the tea pot is visually communicating&hellip;<!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->This simple observation goes some way to reconciling some of the ideas in this thread. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->As Joe points out <!-- raw HTML omitted -->it is the tea pot itself that is communicating<!-- raw HTML omitted -->. One can say the same thing about anything else that we look at, including the products of graphic design: they can be said to communicate, and even if there is something metaphorical about this use of the term, it is close enough to a phenomenal description to be acceptable. Okay, so a thing can be said to communicate &ndash; and since I gave the example of the Japanese tea pot, I have to admit that what it communicates goes beyond a vague impression: it is a sophisticated carrier of aesthetical values of a particular culture. And, of course, this was also my point about type design. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Even so, there remains an important difference between saying that a thing communicates something to the viewer and saying that the maker of that thing communicates with the viewer. In the latter construction, you meet all my previous criticisms of the unreliability of non-verbal communication, because it remains very uncertain that what the thing communicates to the viewer is going to share significant identity with what the maker wants to communicate. [To get theological for a moment, one could even make this observation on a grand scale: noting that what creation communicates to most human beings is not necessarily what God intended to communicate; hence the need for verbal revelation.] <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->So, Tiffany, I don't think <!-- raw HTML omitted -->you<!-- raw HTML omitted --> are a visual communicator, but what you design is. The relationship between what you might want to communicate and what a specific design actually communicates to a particular viewer may range from close identity to complete dissonance, over which you will only ever have very partial control.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Guillaume, I entirely agree, and I think my exchange with Héctor and Joe about the tea pot is precisely about this idea of signification, of things as carriers of meaning. My point is only that this does not necessarily constitute <!-- raw HTML omitted -->communication,<!-- raw HTML omitted --> which is the transfer if meaning, between the maker of a thing and the beholder of a thing. Which is why I question the idea of designers as visual communicators: the term implies a certainty that is largely absent from the practice. But note that while I do not think visual communication is anything like as powerful or reliable as verbal communication, I do not think signification &ndash; the investment of meaning in a thing &ndash; is in any sense less phenomenal than communication. Indeed, I wouldn't be much of a Catholic if I believed that. Signification may, in fact, be much more powerful and effective than mere communication, or it may be as banal as the emptiest verbal expression: to a very large degree it depends what is being communicated or signified, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Pace,<!-- raw HTML omitted --> McLuhan, the message is also the message.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">John, I usually find myself agreeing with you in this forum, but on this issue you are just flat wrong, and significantly wrong for this issue at hand.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->In the first place, 'communication' does not imply the certainty that you claim. According to the Concise Oxford Dictionary one meaning of this word is 'd. impart (feelings etc.) non-verbally (communicated his affection)'. So non-verbal communication is one normal understanding of this term, including its ambiguity.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->What the philosophical term 'signification' means is in fact probably a lot fuzzier than the normal English 'communication', which is ambiguous enough.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I think you are confusing communication with description. I mentioned Karl Buehler's distinction above, and I think it is valid. Verbal description is a way to communicate, but there are many other ways. For example animals communicate a lot, but do not describe, with the possible exception of the dance of bees and apes who have been taught sign language. If Buehler is wrong, tell me why.    <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Typefaces are abstract shapes with no direct descriptive reference, and so they are quite ambiguous. One can be more decorative, one more spare, and so on, and then there are historical associations and memories of where the same kind of face is used. Hence typefaces by themselves can communicate, but are quite limited in what they can communicate by their design.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->However, typefaces are only one ingredient or one tool of the designer's trade, and the good ones are going to use every visual means to communicate effectively. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->What is most important to understand, is that non-verbal communication is often emotionally more powerful and persuasive. It is not for nothing that most designers are paid in one way or another for advertising. But this goes for any communication. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->And the messages are much more specific than 'this is good' or 'this is bad'. Let me take two examples from what I am work I am doing now. First, by the design of my book 'Sayings of the Sages' (I am author and designer, but not publisher), I am trying to communicate: &quot;These sayings are a precious legacy, which you would want to know, but they and the discussion of them are warm and accessible and not threatening.&quot;  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->To get the 'precious' and 'classic' feel I am using a classic design, with red and black on ivory paper, using Jenson. To keep it welcoming the book is not too fat, and each set of sayings with all of its explanation and discussion guide is on one set of facing pages. There is also a fair amount of white space. I hope the cover will have some of the clean black and red Jenson, with a gold filagree frame, and everything will have classic repose and beauty.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->All this is a quite specific impression I want to create, and whether I succeed or not, this is exactly one important kind of thing that good graphic design can do. Actually I could go through every design decision, and tell you how it is designed to give a specific message, or to increase easy of access and understanding. Of course, beauty is one goal, but that is because it serves my purpose.   <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->A related kind of challenge is in a chart I am now working on of the Sages, including a time line. Here I am trying to include a great deal of information in a way that the reader can easily grasp. This is the kind of problem that Edward Tufte discusses in his books. Here the designer is using 'visual logic' to match the concepts that are you are attempting to communicate. And the design decisions are also not value neutral. For example, events of the outside world and the dates of the sages are prominent in my design. For Orthodox Jews this is subversive of the idea that all the sayings are in fact 'mi-sinai', from Sinai, from God, and timeless. And I mean it to be subversive; it's a conscious decision designed to be persuasive of a point of view.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Now graphic designers also regularly use illustration and photography with text also, which again can communicate even more specifically, and often with great emotional power. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I don't like the term 'visual communicator', which has no poetry, or is the opposite of poetry. But Tiffany is right on target concerning the task of graphic designers. It communicates to me, clearly and verbally!   <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt;I do not think visual communication is anything like as powerful or reliable as verbal communication <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Powerful and reliable are two different things. Right on 'reliable', wrong on 'powerful'. I will give you an example.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->A lady I knew liked my work and had me out to talk to her community about applying traditional ethics to modern life - in fact she had done a Master's thesis on this topic, I learned.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->She was very friendly, then I didn't hear from her for some time afterwards. Well, I blew that, I figured. Then I spotted her at a conference, buying a book. She saw me out of the corner of her eye, but seemed reluctant to acknowledge me. Ah, well. Then she turned suddenly, blew me a kiss, and rushed off. There was no mistaking the sincere affection, but what was that all about? Two months later I read of her death from cancer. This was her kiss goodbye. I cherish her memory. Would an e-mail; 'sorry I haven't been well, best wishes' have done the same as that blown kiss that haunts my memory? Did it communicate? With ambiguity, but what power.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">&gt; I questioned whether it was reliable enough for someone to describe herself, professionally, as a 'visual communicator'. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Well, we are now on the same page. Your point about the greater ambiguity of visual communication is generally sound, as I have acknowledged. However, no graphic designer claims that they are going to communicate for their client by visual means alone, without language. What is rather conveyed is that the designer will help make the visual *dimension* of the communication complement the words, so that the overall communication is more effective and persuasive than words alone would be.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Designers never claim to substitute for the writer, so your argument is misplaced. You don't acknowledge that using the visual dimension to communicate text more effectively is in fact the task of a graphic designer - which I take to be Tiffany's point.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->In a very text-heavy setting, a lot of that effort will not be emotional, but pragmatic: making the text easy and comfortable to read. But even in text-heavy environments, the emotional dimension is very important, because you want to increase the chances that you are going to be read, and have the emotional tone of the visual match the tone of the text.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Also even in text-heavy environments the visual design can be critical to understanding. Maps and equations are examples. The graphics of these communicate much more effectively than verbal explanation of the same thing. And effective visual presentation of information just from the point of view of quick comprehension is a field in itself, as Tufte's books illustrate.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->When there are fewer words and more graphic elements, then the visual will play a stronger role, but still in service of the client's message in words, with their persuasive purpose. For example, I think of the great theatrical posters that Christos Tsolerides has put up on Typophile for critique. These could have just had the name and location in large Arial letters black on white, no illustrations, and verbally communicated just as well. But they certainly would not have been as inviting to the potential audience.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Now as to the power of the blown kiss. I took this example to acknowledge your point about the ambiguity of visual communication alone, but to make clear the additional power that the visual element can add power that is not in words alone. First of all the blown kiss, with the expression on the face, did communicate affection and good will powerfully; you are just flat wrong that it failed to communicate. The full sad meaning, it is true, only became clear when I learned more. But my point is that I could have the same information from e-mail messages, as I said. The blown kiss was way more powerful than words alone.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">William, I think the power and 'full sad meaning' of your experience is really an example of the importance of the interpretational context. This is what changed between the blowing of the kiss and your eventual understanding of it.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->But I don't want to analyse to death what is obviously a profound personal memory for you, so I'll clarify what I meant when I wrote that I don't consider 'visual communication is anything like as powerful or reliable as verbal communication'. I'm clearly not referring to emotional power: I'm talking about the power of language that comes from its flexibility, sophistication, its productive ability to create context, i.e. power as effective ability, not direct force. I'm not saying that the raw impact of visual media is less powerful than that of language; obviously this is not so, and this is why people rely on visual means to attract attention, inspire a emotional response, and communicate impressions within a framework of cultural associations (such as your example of a 'precious' and 'classic' feel). Visuals do all these things well. But what I've been talking about is the power of language to communicate, especially to communicate ideas, especially complex ideas; again, this is power in the sense of effective ability, of 'having the power to do more'. I come back to the example I raised earlier: this discussion could not be had visually. In terms of <!-- raw HTML omitted -->communication,<!-- raw HTML omitted --> language is more powerful because it has more effective ability to convey ideas from one mind to another.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Darrel, start reading at the beginning. The idea of a 'visual language' is a metaphor (a point on which my friend who is both a painter and a philosophy professor is adamant). Human language is a unique activity that is only vaguely and inaccurately paralleled in other forms of communication. The difference between the conventional and culturally-bound 'systems' of meaning in art and design and the centrality of natural language to human thought and to self-consciousness is huge. Indeed, the former is only understandable by virtue of the latter. As soon as you start to consciously think about something that you are looking at, it ceases to be visual and starts to become thoughts in your mind that are formed through language.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">&quot;We/one cannot not communicate&quot;, is by Paul Watzlawick. Even if Erik Spiekermann made use of this phrase. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->In fact, one of the most stimulating books on communication, though the title doesn't suggest it, is &quot;Die Krise der Psychologie&quot; by Karl Buehler. (By the way, I prefer to think of Buehler's three &quot;levels&quot; as &quot;aspects&quot;.) <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->What John Hudson calls communication &ndash; to &quot;communicate an idea&quot; &ndash; sounds like &quot;transmit an idea&quot;. I have some reservations against using the word &quot;communication&quot; that way.  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->To speak of &quot;communication&quot; requires not only somebody uttering something by words or gesture or leaving physical marks here and there, i.e. &quot;design&quot;, but also somebody interpreting these utterances *some or another way*. Some one saying something and another one not even paying attention may be communication too &ndash; to the understanding of a third who considers what he sees as being meaningful. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->What are &quot;ideas&quot;? You never &quot;have&quot; them but must conceive of, or guess at, them. The only thing one actually &quot;has&quot; are the marks, the material side of signs: sounds, gestures, ink on paper, which are to be interpreted. But these marks are just as unstable as are &quot;ideas&quot; themselves, especially when it comes to &quot;visual/visible language&quot;. Unfortunately, communication by visual means is not a subject taught at schools, and so there are no lessons in ethics of use. What some one considers a mark, someone else doesn't necessarily too; and not in all circumstances all aspects of the mark are of importance. (This latter aspect can be found in Buehler's writings too, he calls it &quot;abstraktive Relevanz&quot;.) <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Whether a designer regards &quot;design&quot; as problem-solving or otherwise is his personal choice, based on his background and motivation for becoming a designer. To me, design as problem-solving is not the worst description &ndash; I assume that most design jobs are in fact tidying up visually things that others are incapable to lay out properly. Just like philosophy is, or can be, tidying up thought &hellip; <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&gt; Should a graphic designer be called a graphic designer?  <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Good idea!</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Karsten, I'm not happy with the phrase 'transmit an idea', because this suggests exactly the kind of one-way message broadcast that I have criticised at length in this thread, and which is the norm of most of our media, and the form and matter of virtually all graphic design. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->To me, the ideal of communication is conversation, particularly the free exchange and <!-- raw HTML omitted -->co-development<!-- raw HTML omitted --> of ideas among knowledgable people who express themselves well in their common language. This is why I consider visual communication inherently stunted: even the most generous parallel &ndash; e.g. metaphors of 'visual language' &ndash; cannot recognise anything like the common language that makes conversation possible, either in kind or in scope. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I agree with Joe that your post was very well said, and this is precisely my point: the complexity of the thoughts that you communicate, the complexity of my reading of them, the complexity of incorporating them into the overall conversation of this thread so far: all these things are only possible because of the sophistication of language. Like virtually everything else in this thread, the thoughts conveyed by your 'well said' post are not something that could be communicated visually. Complex ideas are the domain of language.</div>
