  body: I think from looking at the thread Yves linked, that the House <a href="http://houseind.com/house.php?kit=3009-FO&amp;sub=view"
    target="_blank">Outerspace</a> was used, but some of the characters were reversed,
    like the M, Q and U. I think the N in your sample is an upside-down U from the
    same font.

  body: 'The sample posted by Peru is of a typeface I have long sought.  <BR> <BR>It
    has been used in Sanrio&#39;s Little Twin Stars character logo: <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/22776.jpg"

    <BR>&#40;Sorry, these were the best examples I could find online.&#41; <BR> <BR>I
    have also seen it on the occasional old t-shirt. And it still exists today in
    Oakland, CA on the sign for Dave&#39;s Market on Park near-ish to MacArthur. <BR>
    <BR>I would LOVE to know what this typeface is, if it&#39;s available digitally,
    or if I can make a digital version.'
