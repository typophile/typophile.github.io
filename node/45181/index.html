typotherapy+design, Keep Six Contemporary Gallery and the Festival of
Architecture and Design invite you to:
MyType: An exhibit of limited-edition, new modernist
posters by graphic design genius Noel Nanton.
Exhibition dates: May 2- May 18th. 2008
Keep Six Contemporary Gallery 938 Bathurst Street, Toronto, Canada.
Free Admission.
Featuring new fonts designed by typotherapy, eye-popping popsicle colours, bold abstract shapes, and a very new take on classic modernist typography.
Starting with the premise that typefaces are as expressive as the words they form, typotherapy has created a series of large-format posters that explore the relationship between positive and negative space. Letters speak, and if you remove them from the constraints of sentences and even words, they have a language of their own.
MyType uses the craft of typography to find new ways of speaking using fonts famous and unknown including Helvetica, Avant Garde and typotherapy creations like Tomeri and VWmobile.
