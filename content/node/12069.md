  for his involvement with Typophile, Jared Benson is an interface designer with an
  insatiable typographic addiction. He launched [[Typophile]] on his birthday in April
  2000 in hopes of creating a venue where designers could get together to share knowledge
  and critique one another's work. Jared originally vetted the idea for Typophile
  with [[Jonathan Hoefler]] while interning at [[The Hoefler Type Foundry]] in summer
  of 1999, and later launched it as a component of his BFA thesis.\r\n\r\nWhen he's
  not spending every waking moment working on Typophile, he's acting as Executive
  Creative Director at San Francisco interface design firm [[Punchcut]]. From 2004-2010,
  he served as a member of the [[FontFont TypeBoard]].\r\n\r\nJared has designed a
  number of typefaces, however none have yet made their way to the retail market.
  His bitmap fonts can be found scattered throughout the Typophile Critique boards.
  \r\n\r\nHis bitmap font, QC Sans, is bundled with the Qualcomm developer SDK and
  is becoming a popular choice on many mobile carrier's handsets. QC Sans was developed
  in collaboration with [[Christian Robertson]].\r\n\r\nJared has a BFA in Graphic
  Design from Brigham Young University. \r\n\r\n"
