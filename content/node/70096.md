body: "\"Hey Russ, we designed these diagrams in AutoCAD to show how people are suposed
  to do this complicated thing we're talking about, which can result in people getting
  injured and property damaged if done incorrectly. Can you get a bunch of 'em printed
  up on vinyl deacls?\"\r\n\r\n\"\u2026 Well, no. I can't.\"\r\n\r\nHave any of you
  had this pleasure? In one of the designs, a relatively simple 2 colour layout with
  a solid colour background fill which would be made up of about a half dozen objects
  in a graphic design application, bloats to 5227 objects in ACAD. \r\n\r\nOh, & Keeping
  it topical, type is a complete mess too.\r\n\r\nArg."

  body: "Hello,\r\nwe have this all the time from the interior designers we work with.\r\nSimple
    solution is to output as a DXF or DWG file then reopen in Illi, tidy up and resize.
    \r\nOr print to PDF from Autocad (assuming you have this plugin for windoze).\r\nIt'll
    still probably look rubbish though:-P\r\nMartin"

  body: "- or just send me a screen capture :o)\r\n\r\nThe files came to me as a PDF,
    then a DWG, then DXF. All the same. \r\n\r\nWhat I really want to know, is what
    is the issue. Why are AutoCAD vectors so Kaflooey in IA or Corel? Is it a Postscript
    thing? \r\n\r\n"

  body: "Never really found them that bad, we only usually have to adjust a few line
    weights and then its mostly fine. \r\nThe worst bit is when they export it with
    all the different layers. \r\n\r\nOne thing has always confused me  which is why
    does AutoCad produce such huge PDF files with soo little information in them."

  body: "I work in a engineering department - I know squat about AutoCAD*, except
    that a I can import a DXF of a building plan and it can come in 100s of thousands
    of individual objects, and I know it wasn't drawn that way in ACAD. \r\n\r\nany
    cuve is broken into small line segments. Lines can be broken into small segments.
    Line thicknesses are rectangles bisected into triangles around each line segment,
    across dozens of layers. There can be twenty lines stacked on top of each other.\r\n\r\nI'll
    have to trySketchUp but if it is a download, my work net nanny won't allow it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n*I
    used to know ACAD quite well in DOS, before it became \"user Friendly\"  :o) \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: strange, I've never had it separate into individual line segments before,
    I wonder if its a prefs setting or if the engineers aren't drawing one continuous
    line?
