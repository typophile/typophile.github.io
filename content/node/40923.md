  body: "The E/3 reminded me of the old Letraset font Quicksilver, but the other letterforms
    are not good matches. Searches of Veer, MyFonts and FontShop with 'fat' and 'rounded'
    did not come up with this (btw, Stewf, if you're listening (and have any influence),
    FontShop should please retain the user test sample until he/she changes it. Annoying
    to have to change each page that is displayed).\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
