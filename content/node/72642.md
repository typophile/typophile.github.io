body: "Dear readers,\r\n\r\ni have been searching the forums for this topic, and found
  some questions and answers, but it didn't help me in solving my problem:\r\n\r\nI
  have kerned an extensive opentype font (that should end up in a postscript otf file
  finally) in fontlab 5 on windows XP.\r\n\r\nI am using about 125 kerning classes
  (but also with exceptions if necessary) and kern single glyphs that don't deserve
  a class (as they are alone anyway). in metrics window, the pair count in the table
  on the right says there are 5982 pairs defined. in the bottom of fontlab window,
  it says \"Pairs: 5874\" (why is there a difference?) When i update the kern feature
  with fontlabs tool, it results in 5874 POS-instructions (plus 5 \"subtable;\" lines
  in between).\r\nwhen i want to compile the opentype features (including 'kern'),
  i get this (and only this) error message:\r\n[FATAL] <Fontname> GPOS feature 'kern'
  causes overflow of offset to a subtable (0x1101c)\r\n\r\n\r\nwhat i read so far
  (my interpretation):\r\n<ul><li>a kern table in opentype fonts is limited to 64kb\r\n<li>someone
  here on the forum says the commands are limited to about 15.000 (but i am having
  problems with \"only\" about 5800 - maybe my commands are \"larger\"?)\r\n<li>if
  i manually delete about 800 lines from kern feature, the feature compiles.\r\n<li>there
  can be more kern subtables, with adding \"subtable;\" command somewhere in between
  (which does not seem to work for me - how is the syntax?)\r\n<li>if there are conflicts
  in kern classes, fontlab creates subtables by itself, some of the glyph combinations
  are not kerned then anymore due to overlaps. (this is not the case here, i don't
  have any conflicts in classes - no error messages when compiling, nothing found
  when clicking the ying-yang symbol in fontlab kern assistance.)\r\n<li>there is
  the suggestion to use the AFDKO kern feature generator. but this special script
  relies on robofab, which i tried to install, but this one again relies on fonttools,
  which i tried to install, but this one relies on a mathematics script collection
  for python, which i am not able to install ... so i am stuck for the moment on this
  path, as it get's more complicated with every step i take.\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\nwhat
  i'd like to do / could do:\r\n<ul><li>get robofab installed and try AFDKO generator\r\n<li>lern
  how to use the subtable command correctly\r\n<li>reduce kerning pairs - i am able
  to push them below my \"personal\" 5000 commands limit for the moment, but it does
  not seem to be a good solution when i want to expand the font further.\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\nany
  ideas, facts, best practices, ... ?\r\n\r\nthanks for your help again\r\nSebastian"

    of next week: It is an FLS5 script* which makes an AFDKO syntax kern feature,
    automatically splits subtables, and if necessary enforces use of the extension
    lookup type.\r\n\r\n* No dependencies on RoboFab or anything else."
