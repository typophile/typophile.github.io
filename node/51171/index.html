  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">John D. Berry, in [[http://www.creativepro.com/article/dot-font-a-new-face-for-small-text|an article on MVB Verdigris]], writes: 

<cite>Too many digital "book" faces don't hold up at the sizes we commonly use for text these days. Many of them are revivals of older, metal typefaces, but are based on a model size that's much larger (12pt or 14pt) than the size at which they'll actually get used. The result is fine, light, wispy text type, instead of the solid, easily-read black type of classical book printing.</cite>

Similarly, we hear a lot of complaints about too many light anemic-looking typefaces being used in books.  Would it help to come up with an introductory list that people can refer to see what their options are to overcome this problem?

		<div class="commentbody">Great topic, Rahim. Book designers really need to cast their net wider. Despite the hundreds of excellent text faces designed specifically for today's workflow and presses, the old metal stuff, often poorly digitized, is still being used. Here are some of my favorite digital typefaces designed specifically for long-running text:

<a href="http://www.houseind.com/index.php?page=showfont&id=171">Paperback</a>

And there's no reason to remain married to ye olde oldstyle serifs. Contemporary slabbish and semi-serif designs are just as effective for book text:

Digital type designers have been on the job since day one (Think Quadraat, Charter, Scala, etc.)
In fact it is one of the central issues of contemporary type design.
Many of my faces address it.
And yet lots of books are still set in wishy-washy versions of Perpetua and Bembo.
Go figure.</div>

As in: "Bembo Book Pro VP"? It is probably something that should be terribly obvious to me; but it ain't right now.

& why did Monotype leave that hideous long-tail R in the basic character set? Don't tyhey look at text composition and see how bad it looks in a line and on a page?

		<div class="commentbody">Both Dante and Bulmer came through the fires of conversion to PostScript at Monotype with good color intact. It'd be interesting to know how that happened, why those two came out OK when so many did not. I do recall reading about some work that went into Bulmer.

It has amused me that Bulmer came out OK when it was made for PostScript, for as a hot-metal face we had problems getting it to cast right in all the Monotype shops I worked at. It may even be a better face now than it was in metal. That rarely has happened.

Bulmer, by the way, deserves looking at for book work. It has a lot of components, and it is very nicely compact. I always look at Bulmer when I need to fit a lot of text into a book.

Thanks, Florian.

		<div class="commentbody">When we were asked to update the classic Swedish typeface <em>Berling</em> by Karl-Erik Forsberg we made thorough investigations and found boxes of unused Berling type in metal at a printing museum in the south of Sweden. From these we made trial prints in 8 pt and it's from these the new [[http://www.linotype.com/116522/berlingnova-family.html#|Berling Nova]] was based. It turned out much darker and not as edgy as previous digital (and photo setting) versions (we saved that for the [[http://www.linotype.com/116524/berlingnovadisplayregular-font.html|display]] version). I'm rather happy with the result.

I totally agree.  Even though the problem has been identified by some and solutions have been offered, the importance of avoiding that problem and actually using those new solutions has yet to penetrate the culture of book typesetting so that it becomes more of an expected norm and less of a surprising exception.

Still, I think it would help to speak out more about the importance of doing this in various magazines, industry publications, conferences, blogs, etc.  Consistent communication is key.

		<div class="commentbody">Regarding Clifford:

At FontFeed, FontShop has posted Akira Kobayashi's long essay about how he came to make Clifford and about how he made the face. Go here:

http://fontfeed.com/archives/akira-kobayashi-on-ff-clifford/

About halfway down, the book page that shows a Victorian-era woman is from "A Gift of Light," a study of 19th-c photography (I designed that book for the University of Notre Dame Press in 2002). 

It was printed on a dull coated sheet, and Clifford really works well. It has great body weight for text, captions, and backmatter. It is very easy to read.

The book may be hard to find. Libraries with extensive library holdings in photography may have it. But I have heard that it did not sell well, and that the publisher pulped the remaining copies (without asking if I wanted to buy some!)

Clifford and Miller are pretty much my "house faces" these days.

		<div class="commentbody">All of the Font Bureau Retail fonts are now available in OpenType format. *However,* note that these are what FB is calling "simple" OpenType fonts -- which basically means that they're just a straightforward format conversion, with minimal OTL features, kinda like Adobe's "Std" OT fonts. 

FB's sOT fonts provide the basic OT advantages of being single, cross-platform files with Unicode encoding (although the hacked ligatures, et al., are also still in their original positions for backward compatibility, and then duplicated with proper OT names). 

In addition, there are a few basic OTL features, the most important being {liga} which allows all the double-f ligatures to substitute automatically now. The three basic fractions have been written into a {frac} substitution; the three basic superiors are in a {sups} substitution; and the two basic ordinals are in a {ordn} substitution.

But, for instance, no attempt has been made yet to integrate SC fonts with their Romans. That will have to wait for the development of ProOT fonts. AFAIK, the FB ProOT standard is still being finalized. I would imagine that Miller would be high on the list of FB fonts for re-development, but I have no specific knowledge.

BTW, simple OT fonts are the same price point as the other formats. And I believe that if you already have a license for FB fonts in PS or TT format, you can get the equivalent sOT by request. But don't quote me on that. You'd have to contact the FB office directly.

from Karmina's description:

"Karmina is a text typeface developed mainly for pocket books and budget editions. It was built to withstand the worst printing conditions: low quality papers, high printing speed with web presses and variations in the ink level of the printing press. More…

Some of Karmina’s most representative features are the rather large serifs, intended to work perfectly in small reproduction sizes, the sharpness of the shapes, including some calligraphic reminiscences, and the large and yet graceful ink traps in the acute connections. Structurally, Karmina combines a significantly large x-height with relatively compressed letterforms. The result of these features grants Karmina outstanding legibility and economy."

Do you think Iowan Oldstyle's large x-height and dark color give it similar advantages when used in small sizes and bad printing conditions, leaving aside that it is not economically compact as Karmina?

I disagree with that conclusion. I've actually used it in a couple books. One needs to take care with the specs, but it can work fine. It's large x-height and proportions give it a particularly approachable feeling that is not appropriate for all settings, but works well in certain others. In this way, I consider it in a class with Stone Serif.</div>

Maybe you're right, but my quotes around "book" above hopefully save me from having to retract. :-) I was referring to sizes ideal for reading a long book, as opposed to a publication where other factors (such as economy) take higher precedence. And it's for this reason that "Book" cuts of fonts typically have a smaller x-height* (and lighter color, and tighter spacing). For smaller text (and books that for whatever reason need to be set with small text) Iowan is just fine.

* This is because, as you might agree, extenders
need to be leveraged more in immersive reading.

> I do find the short extenders a problem

Indeed.
Just try to read one of the unfortunately
numerous books set in ITC Garamond.

--
All this leads to a question I've asked myself (and others, actually :-) concerning the relationship of vertical proportions and authenticity: don't you guys think that a large x-height is anathema to certain styles, like Venetian and Garamond? It's interesting to note here that Mandel believed that a font can't really be French unless it has a small x-height.

As luck would have it, I have been reading essays in a book set in ITC Garamond. It is 9 or 10 over 12 points, set at a measure of 27 picas. 

It is in a different category than Stone Sans. The Stone Sans I find a little less comfortable than I would like, but still highly readable. Reading the essays in ITC Garamond in that setting is really a chore. I really think my eyes have a harder time holding the line.

		<div class="commentbody">To Nick's question:

There are people in this discussion who have studied far more thoroughly than I the sciences of making typefaces and of reading them. So I'm going to go out a limb and see what you all make of a few ideas; there'll probably be some words that are "non-tech," but I'll try to make the point.

One: Perhaps the "busy" and the redundancy Nick spoke of are essential to what so many of us want in book faces because they break up the uniformity of letter shapes and thus help them form into specific units (words) more easily. Maybe they also impart some basically recognizable features to specific letters. Some "g-ness" or "q-ness." & those nesses help readers put them together into words.

Two: Perhaps there is some cultural familiarity at work here also. Perhaps readers come to "know" book faces (which are faces with these redundancies and busy parts) from early days of reading, and so these become established as "book faces."

That's as far as I am able to go now. I'm already feeling over my head. But behind it I'm sure are some of the factors that have made me accept some faces and reject others for the work I do. I'm sure–I hope–there is something more to it than "I don't like this type."

To Hrant and my original question to him: Perhaps in my general inclination to agree with you I am just echoing what I was told as a kid compositor. But there's some basis for it. Some years ago I learned that the Monotype house I used had TNR with long descenders. So we designed a quarterly newsletter with those descenders, and the thing did look notably better (letterpress). At this remove I cannot say if it read any better.

I cited a few weeks ago in another thread the 900 pages I recently read in ITC Garamond. It was easy as pie, easy on my eyes. The most recent tome was 700 pages in Adobe Caslon, which I found more difficult to read. What gives there?

Back to work for me.

That's a really good question. My take on it is that different aspects have different advantages. 

Serifs have four advantages: 
1. Help the eye hold the line. 
2. Make the ends of strokes easier to detect. Tests have shown that the extremes in a glyph are more salient for reading. 
3. I think serifs also help to get even color while having wide enough spacing to relieve crowding. 
4. They also probably contribute to a distinctive "word image" better than sans. For example, a "b" and "d" are more different in a serif than a sans.  

Some variations in design help evenness of color--for example, making the end of the r heavier than the end of the s. 

Some variations help break up the "picket fence"--the tendency of too much vertical emphasis and a dazzle, which is always threatening in roman type, and is bad for text. </div>

"Question: Was the topic of the ITC Garamond book
particularly interesting, versus the Caslon one?"

Both books were equally fascinating, and moving at times. Garamond was the big McCullough bio of Harry Truman. Calson was the same writer's bio of John Adams. Both verged a bit too much toward hagiography, but that's always a danger of biography.

Caslon types have never pleased me very much. They all seem a bit spiky and sparkly, lacking in the dark color that started this here discussion. I rarely specify a book to be set in any form of Caslon. I know that a participant here is at work on a Caslon; I shall attempt to bring an open mind when I can see it.

I know I'm not "supposed" to like ITC Garamond. Being the serious typographer (ahem) that I am. But it posed no reading problems. Even the few instances of faked small caps did not pester me. Nor the lining figs.

Well, I don't think that's it. I think that the variation helps the signal--the letter and word shapes--come through easily and strongly. I don't think it's noise.

		<div class="commentbody">Wow!  Thanks so much, Stephen.  I really appreciate the PDF.  The typeface and the color it produces on the page are lovely, nice and dark like FF Meta Serif or FF Clifford. 

(Request: can FontShop provide a PDF specimen just like this for all its fonts?  The official one with the characters and a few sentences doesn't provide a good sense of what that font might look like in its native setting.)

Interesting that you said that about the text and medium weights.  I said the same thing to myself when I saw the book and medium weights for [[http://vllg.com/Village/GalaxieCopernicus/mudTyper+Weights/|Galaxie Copernicus]].  The medium weight for that one looks properly dark in print.

[[http://vllg.com/KLIM/Feijoa/mudTyper+Weights/|Feijoa]] also only comes in a medium weight, but any smaller weight would cause a loss in the darkness level. 

By the way, is there a name for these typefaces like FF Milo Serif that have slightly larger x-height and low ascenders?  I know Copernicus is a 21st century Plantin.  What family of resemblance would FF Milo Serif belong to?

But is it fair to call it dark? To me even the Medium doesn't qualify for that descriptor... In which case I have to think the designer doesn't intend it as a dark face - especially accounting for the hefty x-height.

On the other hand, on a low-res printer or
in letterpress it would show more weight.

		<div class="commentbody">In recent years, Robert Slimbach has been more concerned about ensuring the text weights are heavy enough. Actually, it's always been an important topic, but I think fashion has drifted in that direction lately.

Unfortunately, we also don't proof with an imagesetter as much as we used to. When I got to Adobe, the type group had its own imagesetter down the hall, and we would crank out pages and pages of proofs to ensure that the weights of the text sizes were reasonable. Some time ago, we moved from one floor to another and lost the old imagesetter, and Adobe didn't want to keep chugging through the chemicals used for processing, so now we only get to proof that way once or twice during development. As everyone knows, laser printer proofs require some mental adjustments (but if anyone is good at understanding that, it's Robert).

It was nice in the MM era, when one could just tweak the weight axis and have whatever they liked. Of course, now, we still develop MMs and generate instances, but the end user doesn't get to choose. Recent Slimbach faces have offered good options though, I think. The medium weight of Garamond Premier was created specifically to offer something for more substantial text settings. (The text in the Garamond Premier Pro specimen book is set in the medium weight.)</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Reviving this old thread, with a new(?) question:

Is it generally a bad idea to use a darker-than-regular weight of face for book use? 

I ask because I'm selecting a house face for a small startup publishing imprint, and I keep coming back to this thread, as I'm looking for something on the dark side. One option I'm drawn to is <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/singles/creative_alliance/garamond_premier_pro_medium/">Garamond Premier Pro Medium</a> – the regular weight seems too light. But maybe the medium would look too heavy in such an extended setting? It's hard for me to tell without seeing an extended specimen. Perhaps someone here has experience in this area.

While I'm commenting, I'll agree with Stephen that <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/singles/monotype/bembo_book_pro_roman/">Bembo Book</a> looks really nice. I'm also considering Feliciano's Merlo and Rongel, which have just the kind of darkness I want, but the open-bowl P's are holding me back so far...</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Zach, when we talk about a darker face for book, it's more in it's contrast and proportions. A medium weight like the Garamond you mention can work very well for books, since it has enough contrast to hold well on rougher paper.
However, most of the times at the book publishers we chose not to use the Adobe Garamond cause it was simply to "beautiful" for book text and too perfectly cut that somehow made it more of a display face or for larger sizes.

The best would be to print some text with several fonts you want to check out on the actual type of paper you plan to print your books on, many book printers have already made samples, or can do it for you if you plan a long relationship with them. That would be the most ideal test.

About the Bembo, ALL the Bembo's are too light!! (well almost all except some rare cuts you won't be able to find anywhere). I don't understand why they still keep using it for books. I was once asked to design a 6pt. Bembo to meet with the Publisher's demand for small sizes, to match reproductions of Older publications.

One thing I learned is the the Publisher's world is quite conservative and many have their own specific punctuation rules and demands from a book-typeface, that it's really hard to get in there - any typeface that doesn't fit those rules get's ignored. It almost demands custom typefaces for each publisher.. phew :)</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I’m glad this topic has been running for so long (it started about a year and a half ago!). I agree with Nick Shinn’s comment from back near the beginning: you can’t force people to do good design. Some good digital book faces have been around for about 15 years, but most designers don’t realize that it’s important to use (and pay for!) them. Some of my students recently produced a newspaper using ITC Fenice for all the text (without asking me first). It’s dreadful, spidery and impossible to read more than a few sentences without getting a headache. 
I remember a conference in (I think) New York City at the end of the 1980s. Monotype put it on and there was discussion involving me, David Berlow, and a few others about optical sizes for digital type. We were just starting to get small caps and oldstyle figures in PostScript type back then. I had experimented with adding stroke weight (dipping in “digital chocolate”) with a few faces, with varying (mostly bad) results. I'm so glad that type is now better than it has ever been since Gutenberg. </div>

		<div class="commentbody">Indeed. Technology and quality of typefaces have improved immensely, certainly since Gutenberg. The possibilities now are almost endless when it comes to producing good typefaces to a variety of needs and demands. I even like the still existing practice of designing optical sizes and the quality has improved in that field as well.
You could argue about the actual *need* for all this improvement when you think about the world getting more and more digital and the *value* for the craftsmanship and the amount of work put into certain typefaces getting lower by the year.
Not to mention that print quality has improved quite a bit since then, and it's really more the extreme ends of point sizes that need addressing when it comes to optical sizes.

All this must effect the type of education students get in schools when it comes to typography. Plus, students are not entirely clueless, they see what's going on around them, the vast majority of things to look up to and inspire by are digital or in some digital form or other.. so how do we suppose they'll be interested in this rather old-fashioned practice in legibility and optical sizes and even good typography. Let alone appreciate the (price) value of it.

There are several magazines and publications out there that seem to benefit from this available practice in type-design and use it quite well in most parts (look at the recent redesign of Interview, or T. Thy both have an art-direction that is typography-aware. But is it really from "Need" or "Necessity", or rather the Classical or Sentimental quality they are after. 

I hate to use the word Novelty in this context, but I can't help but thinking this is more what's on the minds of the designer/art director these days, or the aspiring designers/art directors out there.

There are new and harder challenges ahead (and present) when it comes to typography and technology, and considering the available "solutions", although some being quite exciting, we still have a long way to go.

And go put a price tag on that. Yikes!

What about the concept of Optical sizes and legibility for Screen (vs Print)?</div>

Exactly. So if the book designer follows the normal practice of not matching the era of type to the era of the text, where's the "twist" that Zach speaks of?

		<div class="commentbody">@Bill: <em>...not an attempt to look like 18th century printing.</em>

Surely there is more to 18th century printing than its roughness and relative distress.

The basic letter shapes of Williams Caslon are 18th century. It looks like "Caslon", it's named Caslon, and, to a similar extent as in Adobe Caslon, it has flexed serifs, and parses the uncoated-stock press gain of 18th century printing as both a softening of the outline and a reduced-contrast "darkness" that is the theme of this thread.

The technique, a complex drawing of each glyph, suggests the variation in cutting and randomness of printing artefacts that one associates with 18th century printing, as opposed to the subsequent sharpness and regularity of the Didone style -- and is quite different than the application of a thematic, reductive system, as in the design of Matrix or Charter.

It's not a 21st century idea: Goudy was the first to develop it in Kennerley (1911).

	<div class="card-body">
		<div class="commentbody">Nick, your characterization is off the mark. 

My aim in this revival was to create a look that is "contemporary classic," something with a timeless quality, rather than a design redolent of the era in which it was first created. I didn't want an "antique" or "retro" look. So my approach has been to adopt some features of the original look, which I think deserve reviving, while consciously rejecting others. Your account only notes the first, not the second.

To put it another way, my general approach to revival has been more like that of Matthew Carter's Miller, not that of Justin Howe's Founder's Caslon.  

I was indeed inspired by the look of printed letter press, and have aimed to have my font, when printed by contemporary offset and direct-to-plate methods, possess some of the virtues of the letter press versions. However, I consciously rejected the 18th century look of clumpy inks and large ink spread due to printing on damp paper. My inspiration was the look of the ink and ink spread involved in early 20th century printing. 

I also deliberately changed the look of 20th century metal type, as well. I did round external corners, as with letter press ink spread. However, I kept joins of branches sharp and unbracketed, contrary to the effect of letter press ink spread. Williams Caslon Text is more crisp internally, and in this feature, together with others, is a 21st century digital design, and not an 18th, 19th, or 20th century one.

The outlines, particularly of the lower case, do have a hand-modeled look. This modeling is designed to increase readability, and to achieve a welcoming, humanist aesthetic. It does not mimic the artifacts of Caslon's 18th-century punch cutting. I have seen the drawings of Mergenthaler Linotype Caslon Old Face, at the Printing Museum in Andover, which are based on blow-ups of metal type. These old Linotype drawings do indeed attempt to reproduce the irregularities of hand punch cutting. My outlines don't have this goal, and don't have these artifacts. </div>

		<div class="commentbody">Bill, your Caslon is a retro design.
It is in no way a modernization or post-modernization, but firmly in the tradition of 20th century old style revivals.

How can something that it is clearly recognizably as a "Caslon" revival be anything but a retro design?!
Despite being revised at various times subsequently, the Caslon we all know and love remains an 18th century look.
"Caslon", the collective archetype, is an 18th century typeface.
Furthermore, the "modeling" you have employed, for purposes of readability, is strongly informed by the look of letterpress, which again gives the face a retro, antique look, as if the ductus, contrast, and serif shapes of Caslon were not cue enough.

@William: <em>However, contrary to what you say, I consciously rejected the 18th century look of clumpy inks and large ink spread due to printing on damp paper. </em>

I didn't comment on your rationale (and it should be noted that effects are not always as intended).
I said that your face "parses the uncoated-stock press gain of 18th century printing", and could have added "and earlier".
I suspect this is because you've followed the twentieth century manner of representing the appearance of old styles.
In revivals of later faces, such as didones, the tendency was generally to remove the trace of process and emphasize their simple geometry. For instance, the myth of the geometric Bodoni was long dominant, until ITC Bodoni in 1994 represented the letterpressed image.

<em>I also, though, deliberately changed the 20th century metal look as well.</em>

The style of rounded external corners and sharp bracket joins, which you adopted as a representation of the letterpress process, has been in use since early in the 20th century, so you didn't change anything. As I mentioned, Goudy originated it. Benton used it in Cloister, his Jenson, in 1920. Digital fonts such as Bitstream Baskerville, and Monotype Bulmer, to name two digital 18th century revivals from the late 20th century, feature it. Your Caslon is similar to Adobe Caslon in its style of finish, although the proportions are different. Filosofia went further in playing round outside corners against sharp inside corners -- your foot serifs are slightly bracketed.

<em>I did not attempt to ape the artifacts of metal punch cutting.</em>

Again, I made no comment on your motives. I pointed out that the irregularity, or "modeling" as you say, of your drawing (e.g. serifs are not uniformly copied and pasted, with that on the right of "n" being wider than that on the left) suggests the irregularity of punch cutting. And although your drawing does not reproduce specific gnarly artefacts, as Justin Howe's did, irregularities such as the beak of "r" that is slightly larger than the corresponding triangle in other letters (this detail is same-sized in many other Caslons) suggest an artefact of letterpress printing pressure, although that was not your intention.

		<div class="commentbody">Nick, there is a difference between "retro", which appeals to nostalgia, and "classic", which appeals to a sense of timeless rightness.  

You don't acknowledge the reality of this category, but most of the rest of the world does. 

The effort to produce better digital versions of classics has been a major movement in type, including Slimbach's efforts. And the phase of digital "new classics" with optical sizes and lower contrast is phenomenon of the past 10 or 15 years, including Bembo book and indeed various recent Caslon revivals other than mine.   

When you say that Goudy already did what I did, you are simply failing to understand the issue. Goudy did letter press, and letter press just had to live with ink spread. Now with offset printing and digital type we can decide selectively what of the effects of ink spread to accept and reject. This means molding type in a different way, and new decisions on how to do it. This is only one issue involved in revivals, but it is an important one.

Your analysis is reductive and dismissive, and so in my view misses or dismisses important issues.</div>

I do, and I would say that any Caslon revival is both classic and retro, but I fail to see how something that is timeless can be a 21st century typeface. You can't have it both ways, Bill!

<em>The phase of digital "new classics" with optical sizes and lower contrast is phenomenon of the past 10 or 15 years, </em>

I disagree that it is a recent digital phenomenon, there is nothing particularly new in the process of updating the classics, it goes on all the time. The process of designing weightier serifed text faces, to compensate for the attenuation of the high-res digital-to-offset process, has been going on since the start of digital, and applies to both new and classic serifed faces. Yes, there have been more and more optically-enabled faces since 1995, but Adobe Garamond, FB Eldorado and H&FJ Didot were earlier. 

<em>When you say that Goudy already did what I did, you are simply failing to understand the issue. Goudy did letter press, and letter press just had to live with ink spread. <em>

I have explained this before: the resolution of letterpress in Goudy's era was much higher than in the historic era (pre-didone). He was doing large drawings, not punchcutting at that time (his early career). Therefore he was able to produce letterforms which pastiched the vagaries of earlier, rougher printing. Look in<em> Goudy's Type Designs</em> where he described his problems with the technicians at Linotype who wanted to "clean up" his Garamond (e.g. straighten the slant on the vertical stem of "a"), because "they had always done it that way".

<em>This means molding type in a different way, and new decisions on how to do it.</em>

If I am being dismissive, it is not of your excellent typeface, but of claims that you are making for its originality which are exaggerated. Do you really believe that type designers for the past 100 years have not "molded" and "modeled" their drawing of type -- especially in the oldstyle genre -- to both suggest and anticipate the effect of press gain? How does your drawing differ in stylization from that of Bitstream Baskerville or Monotype Bulmer?

Here is Cloister, scanned from a 1920s magazine ad: note the heft, the molded roundedness of the serifs, and the sharpness of the internal joints.

	<div class="card-body">
		<div class="commentbody">Nick, on timelessness, I wrote that the goal is a *sense* of timeless rightness. I am well aware that because of the continual changes in technology, in order to *look* timeless, you have to keep changing. The effort to get digital revivals to actually look 'Classic' is the latest effort in a long standing one, as you say. One of the things I have done, reducing contrast, is part of the more recent efforts in revivals. I'm well aware that revivals of classics are of their time. Adobe Caslon, Founders Caslon are, and would be done differently today. I'm sure a late 19th century performance of Beethoven sounded a lot different than a late 20th century one.   

I don't know how original I've claimed to be, but I have claimed to specific things differently. A lot relate to readability, which you don't believe in, so I'll write about that elsewhere. 

The example you give of Cloister I'm pretty sure is big. The point about a lot of earlier digital revivals is that they were based on larger sizes, where the ink spread makes less of a difference. One of the key things about doing classics right, in my view, is to reduce contrast in the 10-12 point area, not just in the 8 point and below range, which is where ATF did it. And Slimbach also tends to have pretty high contrast in the regular range. ATF was letter press, and the 'stroke' that ink spread adds was a kind of automatic optical sizing, in my view. So where I differ with Twombly and Simbach is that I've designed a regular size with lower contrast. However, it's not that simple, because actually my joins are pretty narrow. The look is influenced by the way the weight changes through the arches. 

All the things I have done on this are only subtly different, but they add up to a different look. One of the things I am proudest of is that I think you can recognize Williams Caslon on the page from its texture, without looking at details. The differences are small but systematic, so they add up to a different "look". The other thing I am pleased with is that it doesn't look like anything else, like something that came out of Reading or KABK or Adobe. 

I do reject the retro label. I don't have a problem with retro, but this is not an exercise in nostalgia, and would be disappointed if that is the reaction. I hope readers will just see a comfortable, welcoming and highly readable font, not one that says "18th century" or "old fashioned." Well, ok some of the swashes may look old timey, but they're not the heart of the font, and you can use them or not for a special effect.        </div>

You do well to do so because, strictly speaking, Retro as a style is pretty much confined to the 1950s to 1970s, a period marked by the death of letterpress and the ascendancy and triumph of the phototypesetter and offset lithography. Powdered wigs (Caslon) and snuff boxes (Scotch Roman) were not <em>au courant</em> at the time...</div>

Nick, the twist I was referring to isn't typographic – it's in the content. When I'm close to finalizing the design of the first book, I'll probably post samples here for critique, and explain the twist then. I realize Caslon isn't a 19th century face – but as Bill said, lots of 19th century books (including many of the original editions I've been working from) were printed in Caslon.

And to weigh in on Nick and Bill's debate, with my humble two cents as a quasi-informed type consumer, what I liked about Williams Caslon was precisely the quality Bill is underlining – it's classic, and a Caslon can't be otherwise, but it does have some kind of contemporary, updated feel. I know not why, but that's my impression. It makes sense to me that Boston Magazine is using it.

That's unlikely. In the first half of the century the style of text type was modern (didone). Mid century, some rough old Caslon type, with long "s", was used for a few historical pastiches. In the second half, a genre of modernized "old style" emerged, but it wasn't named Caslon and was a far cry from what we would recognize as Caslon today, although there are some latter day Caslons (e.g. 471) which are based on it, erroneously.

		<div class="commentbody">Nick, as the Mosley article makes clear, copies of a fairly original Caslon were available in the US beginning in the 1850s. I don't know how widely they were used. 

Although "Old Style" is significantly different from Caslon itself, it does indeed adapt some of Caslon's look, so that Caslon itself is not too alien to a 19th century look.

According Mac McGrew, Caslon itself became very popular in the US when Vogue magazine adopted it in 1892. Also according to him, Caslon 471 is not based on Old Style, as you say, but on Caslon itself, in the version from the electroplated version available in the US from the 1850s on. ATF acquired this as part of the consolidation of foundries at the end of the 19th century. 

I don't know how much 471 and the later 540, with reduced descenders, were recut from the electroplated version, but I am guessing that ATF redid it and regularized it with the Pantographic punch cutter. The digital 540 is based on the larger sizes of Caslon, not the smaller sizes, which is why it works well as a display face, but not a text face. </div>

		<div class="commentbody">@Bill:<em> Caslon 471 is not based on Old Style,</em>

"Caslon 471 was designed by the staff of American Type Founders as their first revival of Caslon. It is based on the Old Style No. 1 typeface used in an 1865 specimen book from the L.J. Johnson foundry in Philadelphia."

That's from the Caslon wiki. Not always a reliable source. However, unless one were to inspect these types closely, I suspect it would be hard to say just how much "Caslon" of what size there is in them.

Anyway Bill, although there was some marginal use of more authentic Caslon types in the 19th century (and especially towards the end), I was suggesting to Zach that what he is seeing as book-text "Caslon" in the original editions of lots of 19th century books is probably a modernized old face. 

<em>Although "Old Style" is significantly different from Caslon itself, it does indeed adapt some of Caslon's look, so that Caslon itself is not too alien to a 19th century look.</em>

That's pretty sloppy, given the variation in Caslon's types between sizes. This argument appears to be that all old styles that aren't Garamond, Jenson or Bembo are Caslon! As an alternative to the usual Shavian eulogy, how about a little Homer (Simpson, that is): "Caslon, is there anything it can't do?"

I would say that Caslon <em>itself</em> was indeed alien to the 19th century, because it was revived in the 1840s for historical pastiche and found wanting for any other use.

		<div class="commentbody">Nick, the Old Style from Johnson was indeed the electroplated Caslon. Mac McGrew explains that while it was Caslon, "Johnson simply called the face Old Style, as family names were a later development." But it is, in fact Caslon, and not a font derived from the Miller and Richard Old Style Antique designed by Alexander Phemister in around 1860. 

And hence, Caslon 471 is indeed based on the originals, but I think recut, and not the same.

By the way, that also shows you that the matrices from the Electroplated Caslon were around in the US since the 1860s. As I said, how often they were used, I don't know. 

The real Caslon craze it seems only started in the 1890s, according McGrew. 

We've disagreed before about to what extent the Phemister Old Style face resembles Caslon—where I'm also not in full agreement with Mosley——so I'll just let that lay. </div>

		<div class="commentbody">Nick, you may well be right – the (digitized) originals I'm working from have something that looks Caslon-ish, but it's hard for my eyes to tell, due to a combination of lack of experience, laziness, and poor quality scanning. Here, for example, is a paragraph from Google Books' 1897 copy of "Dracula":

[img:sites/default/files/old-images/dracula_caldwell_1897_6136.png]


I look at that and think "Hard to tell, looks like Caslon, or something in the same ballpark at any rate" :)

Here's that paragraph in Bill's Calson for comparison:

[img:sites/default/files/old-images/dracula_williams_caslon_6282.png]


(Though as a side note, a week ago I decided I'd use Storm Walbaum for Dracula, and probably Williams Caslon for some of the other books. Unless Nick keeps giving me second thoughts...)


It seems like the "Old Style" the article refers to is the same face that I've seen in a lot of early 20th century books, but never known the name of, e.g.:

	<div class="card-body">
		<div class="commentbody">Zach, I do think your samples are "Old Style", meaning one of the faces derived from the 1860 Old Style Antique of Alexander Phemister. 

As the Jaspert Encyclopedia of Typefaces explains, "Its purpose was to cut a type that overcame what was regarded as archaic in CASLON. The serifs are slighter and more sharply cut. Stress is vertical, though not abruptly so. ...Ascenders and descenders are rather short."

In other words, Old Style was the first Caslon revival, though it was undoubtedly strongly influenced by current 19th century fashions, as Mosley points out. As you I think rightly note, it also does distinctly remind one of Caslon, even though it is substantially changed in some respects. 

As I wrote earlier, that a re-publication of a text has to be in the same type as the era in which it was written is I think a questionable notion—and in any case not a generally accepted one. I can understand not wanting it to look totally anachronistic, but aside from that, I think the main thing is to be readable, look good, and suit the mood of the piece. 

My problem with Old Style and the many fonts derived from it is that I think they look dull. If you test one of the digital ones—there are a bunch—I think you will see what I mean. For me the original contrast is just a little too low, and the ascenders too short—which, as Tracy notes, tends to make a face dull. Also short ascenders looks less "literary" in a book setting. I personally think they are less readable, but I know my view is very debatable. 

Just looking now at some of the digital versions, they seem rather high contrast compared to 19th century printed versions. See Bruce Old Style, Binny Old Style, and Old Style 7. Bookman is closer in being low contrast, but I think rarely used for books. Century Old Style is end 19th century and not so closely related to Caslon, but has perhaps more the feel of that era, if that's what you want. 
 
ps. I would use old style figures with text. I notice that the "Old Style" font has them...

I agree, though looking anachronistic is a somewhat subjective experience. On Dracula I ended up switching to Walbaum because -- bringing us back to the original thread topic -- it had a darker look, both in color and tone, which I think fits well with the text, even though it wasn't written in Germany or in Walbaum's era.</div>

This is certainly true for those who don't know any better.
As long as a type looks suitably old to the reader it will do. 
However, for those who are aware of the vintage of both text and type, there is a dialectic present, which one would hope has been considered by the typographer, because it effects the meaning of the work.

I wouldn't say that type has to match the era of the text, but if it doesn't, there should be a significant reason, not just "close enough".

		<div class="commentbody">And for those who do know better, the idea of "matching" is simplistic. 

If you exactly mimic the look of an earlier era it will generally look antiquarian. If that's what you want, fine, but it won't carry the same meaning as it did in the era in which it was originally printed, for the printing then looked "normal." In other words, true "matching" is, ironically, not authentic to the original feel, but adds a message of antiquity or nostalgia. 

So the "dialectic" you rightly speak of should start with a recognition that mimicking is as a rule a poor idea. It is mimicking that requires a special reason, and not the use of a type that today looks "normal." And if you choose not to mimic, then a wide range of possibilities opens up, many of which may be good ones. 

Historical association is one factor, but I think it is generally best attenuated. If I remember rightly the Penguin Complete Shakespeare is in Plantin. But it isn't the original look of the first printing of Shakespeare, but of the 20th century revival, which looks "classic" and 20th century, when it was published. So the historical association is rightly attenuated by quite a bit.

I'm talking about historically sensitive type choices that express something of the aesthetic of an age, apart from considerations of newness or antiquity.

What is the relationship between the shape of a sentence and the shape of a type?

I would like to believe there is some kind of ecological synergy, that writers have some inkling of the appearance of their text in the publications of their day, and write accordingly. Cultural works do not exist in isolation from time and place, but are expressions of them. If today we are interested in the past at all, and want to feel and understand it, surely inserting a filter of anachronism between text and reader is no help.

This is why historical theatre and film is generally performed in period costume. Typographers should pay attention to that, wise up, and stop being so sloppy and self-indulgent.

I believe Barnes and Noble has published a bunch of paperback "Classics", popular out-of-copyright books, and I will have to check, but I believe they have rather similar formats and fonts. I really don't think that is sloppy and self-indulgent. It may be that they put a priority on the look of the overall series, and frankly I don't think it would interfere with the reader's enjoyment, provided they are well set otherwise.

Sure they do.
In pursuit of the suspension of disbelief, set designer, costume designer, makeup artist, hair stylist and art director work under the director to create a seamless whole that enables the audience to become engrossed in the story. 

I wouldn't say I over-represent the importance of historical allusion, given that it is generally so poorly adhered to.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Nick, let me try again on costumes vs type. 

I don't think reading the novel or play in Times New Roman vs Baskerville is going to make you think that differently about the characters in Huckleberry Finn or Hamlet. But a great film that has costumes and the look of an actor may make you think about these stories differently. I just think the influence of text type is less specific, less attached to the content of the story. It sets a mood rather than gives a specific historical reference. It is a step further removed from the content of the experience.

I think the mood is more important than an historical connection. So, for example, I like Zach's idea of using Walbaum for Dracula, because it is a little unusual looking and stylish, so it might add to the general creepiness of the story. That Dracula was, in 1897, originally set in an Old Style (I checked on Google Books) I don't think is as important as the mood.   

The historical reference you can do more with display type, and I'm not against it. I agree with you that historical setting should be considered, but I have the feeling that I would put it lower in priority and you do, and I also think there's a danger of looking antiquarian, which will may work against the mood, in spite of being historically more accurate.

		<div class="commentbody">I agree with both of you :) With Bill, that mood is more important, or at least equally as important, as historical connection -- but with Nick that the aesthetic of an age interpenetrates both its type and its literature, often meaning that historically-appropriate choices will also be mood-appropriate choices, and vice versa, though of course not always.

I like Walbaum for Dracula not just because of its darkness and superficial creepiness (though I do like that; the S and C triangular serifs and the angular 3s all resemble fangs), but because it seems like there is a historico-philosophical parallel, despite the anachronism: both are rationalistic, but with an asterisk. Walbaum is the least strictly rationalist Modernist/Didone, if I'm not mistaken, and Dracula is full of characters who are too modern to believe in anything so mythical as vampires lurking in Eastern Europe, but find themselves forced to, written to readers who are similarly modern but still feel some attraction to all that dark magic. (Is anyone picking up what I'm putting down, or am I full of it?)</div>

		<div class="commentbody">"I do, and I would say that any Caslon revival is both classic and retro, but I fail to see how something that is timeless can be a 21st century typeface. You can't have it both ways, Bill!"

If something classic is timeless, then having it belong in the 21st century isn't having it both ways - but having it "retro" <em>would</em> be having it both ways. If something is retro, it is ostentatiously dated, and hence not timeless. So I can argue that you have it backwards - although, in fact, something can be classic by having much in it that is of timeless merit without being entirely free of elements that are dated.

Of course, Caslon really is an old typeface, and despite its popularity and merit which makes it a classic, the original face does have some characteristics which render it dated. A modified face, based on Caslon, can emphasize the timeless parts of the design and blunt the dated ones, or make the opposite design choice, and have something that is indeed 'retro' even if the timeless classic merits of the design are also present.

Also, I am surprised to see it suggested that a book ought to be typeset in a typeface belonging to the era in which it was written.

It seems to me there is no good reason not to typeset Shakespeare in Times New Roman, for example. Or <em>She</em> or <em>Tarzan of the Apes</em>, for that matter. The purpose of a type is to be something invisible to convey the words of the author to the mind of the reader, not to be something archaic with which the reader is not comfortable. You know, like a <strong>crystal goblet</strong>.

That being said, I also think that there are times when an exception is warranted. Thus, I would not at all mind curling up with a copy of "The Well at the World's End" or "The Lord of the Rings" typeset in, say, 14-point Kelmscott Roman. With generous leading, tight word spacing (which means words would be hyphenated at need), and decorative initials at the start of chapters (can you even tell a word processor to put the first line in all-capitals these days)...

But while the occasional indulgence is a pleasant thing, it is not appropriate for a steady diet.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">John, like most people, you misinterpret Beatrice Warde's metaphor of the crystal goblet.
She did not mean "crystal clear", as in an unadorned, plain wine glass.
She was well aware that crystal goblets, although transparent, are <strong>obviously and profusely decorated in an archaic manner.</em>

@John [quadibloc]: <em>But while the occasional indulgence is a pleasant thing, it is not appropriate for a steady diet.</em>

Thank you for agreeing with me.
I was recently looking at new books on Victorian architecture, and nary a one of them was set in a 19th century  didone.
Most inappropriate was the choice of Baskerville, as incongruous as a Chippendale chair in a Gothic Revival room.
It would be nice to occasionally come across some discriminating historical allusion, rather than typefaces which people have chosen because they are safe and conventional "book" faces. </div>

		<div class="commentbody">If darkness is regarding to the contrast, I would add fonts like Jenny (FontFarm) and Trinité (TEFF), but I think, it is not only regarding to the contrast. Jenny is a fantastic font with a very fair price by the way. In case of Expo (Serif), it is both, a relative low contrast and relative thick strokes in the regular weight. And Expo looks like it would be very versatile. I prefer typefaces with a relatively low contrast, at least, if they are printed in a dark black. Because of that I also dislike Sabon Next, because the contrast is so big. But I am not a professional and haven’t seen all these typefaces in well printed books, but in laser prints only. At least I never talk about the impressions, that I get, if I see body text typefaces on screen. I mean – I don’t conclude to their quality in print anymore. However, I have compared the quality of my printer with books, from which I think, that they are very well printed – books about typography from the publishing house Hermann Schmidt. And my conclusion is, that my laser prints are on a comparable level with regard to the shapes and the thickness of the glyphs, but not with regard to features like reflection of the toner/ink and the kind of the black, which seem to be not less important than the paper and the quality of the fonts. The toner (of my printer) is on the paper, while the ink of the books is in the paper. So the text looks a bit raised, although the toner coat is thin. And therefore my prints are much more susceptible for lighting conditions. But I think, that I can get a general impression of the typefaces in offset print. Merlo and Feijoa also belong to the dark typefaces. And I like them very much, although Feijoa is less versatile than Merlo and lesser versatile than Expo.</div>

Of course Mr Shinn is correct (although I think his typeface for that Canadian newspaper is just frightful - I mean, Times New Roman is obviously the best typeface for the job). I'm surprised that John would have misunderstood my metaphor as so many others have. I would have thought that the President of ATypI could have taken more time with his references. Dear John, please reread it but take careful notice of the paragraphs describing windows. I think that will help you understand it better.
