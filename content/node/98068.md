body: We are having a new vehicle signwritten and everyone has been trying to find
  out what font this is without success.  I am now turning to the experts please to
  help us.  Once it is identified can you tell me how to obtain it to use it!!  THe
  nearest I can get to it is Garamond or Cloister but they are not right.  Thanks
  in anticipation ,  Caroline
