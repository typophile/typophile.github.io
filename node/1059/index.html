<div class="post-content e-content" itemprop=articleBody>This is a redesign for my Mother's shop, Elizabeth <br>Horne. Their current design is cringe worthy, using <br>(gasp) Brush Script for the logotype, y'know the one that <br>comes stock standard on pc's. I reckon I owe it to her to <br>do a redesign. I am deliberately using Art Deco as a <br>starting point, because there is a huge amount of Deco <br>influence in the town, and the shop was established in <br>the mid -30's. She sells quality women's clothes, and I <br>want the logotype to reflect both the Deco heritage and <br>the elegance of her and the clothes. <br> <br> <br><img src=http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/14845.jpg alt></div>

<div class=commentbody>Kris, this is a really good start. <br> <br>* I'd agree with David about the E. <br>There are lots and lots of different <br>things you can do with an uppercase E. <br>One thing you can do: Challenge yourself to sketch <br>out 10-12 different forms and pick from there. <br> <br>* The z is nice. The middle sharp part, maybe <br>you might dip that below the baseline <br>until it looks just so, and the <br>same with the O and the round E if you keep it, <br>and the joins on the N. <br> <br>* spacing might look better tighter. <br>And how would it look stacked? <br> <br> <br>good luck. <br> <br>ps, Does your Mom know what you</div>

<div class=commentbody>The euro E is out. I have sketched about 4 different E's, <br>but have only just flicked it into Fontlab. (oh my <br>gracious, how wonderful is that program?) The spacing <br>is atrocious, because it hasn't been spaced yet. Mum <br>does know what I am up to, she realises the Importance <br>of Good Design, (I gave her enough stick about the <br>current logotype - her friend commented that the <br>business card looked like one put 50c in a vending <br>machine and out popped a card!). <br> <br>Thanks for the feedback, will post up changes in a short <br>while.</div>

<div class=commentbody>I like the overall impression. <br> <br>Your Z fits in, although I think, it should be more rigid. Maybe you could try letting the tail strat horizontally. <br> <br>Now every talked about the E being an Euro, I cant get it out of my mind either. Maybe you could try a combination of a classical E (angular) with a 1/4 circle bottom (get it?). And you don't have to make all three E's the same. <br> <br>---Jacques</div>

<div class=commentbody>Kris, these are stylin'...you make Christian's point <br>about doing something custom vs. rolling out a font. <br> <br>couple of things: <br> <br>* The space between words seems a bit wide. <br>* the space around the O in Horne seems tighter <br>than the rest of the spacing. Overall, you might get <br>a more pleasing result if you tighten a bit. The word <br>Fashion, btw, seems to have tighter spacing. <br>* the TH ligature is nice...did you try it the other way <br>and compare. <br>* what does the moms think? <br> <br>bj <br></div>

<div class=commentbody>I know I'm way behind here, but two things: <br> <br>1 Just to reiterate what Romesh pointed out, the TH ligature and the Z are both excellent. <br> <br>2 I don't know what the big Euro fuss was all about. Sure I see it, but one of the distinguishing characteristics of Art Decco was its reach for international (although usually focusing on the exotic) boundaries. In addition, just about any european reference always has a place in fashion. Having said that, I don't know where this shop is located</div>

<div class=commentbody>Some thoughts: <br> <br>1) I don't really care for the TH lig. It reads ok, but seems like added trickery for trickery's sake. Considering you already have lots of character pumped into your deco letters, plus two lovely swash letters. Do you need the ligature? I think no. <br> <br>2) Try opening up the space in the R just a hair. <br> <br>3) Your curves & stems look a little mechanical for flowing deco type. <br>a. Apex of the A <br>b. Horiz/Vert transition on the B <br>c. What if the stems had a waist? (optima-ized) <br> <br>4) Try the N with flat corners instead of the sharp ones. (more in character with the other letters) <br> <br>5) This is a matter of taste, but I'd either go back to a optical monoline, or increase the contrast in your thins. (You may not need to if you add a waist to the stems). <br> <br>Finally, I prefer the top E solution. Don't let them compete with your lovely swashes. <br> <br>All that to say, this is really nice. Bursting with potential. Congratulations! <br> <br>Randy</div>

<div class=commentbody>>>I still find the 'infinity' double 'O' distracting. <br> <br>I forgot to say previously that all type that doesn't say <br>'Elizabeth Horne" will be at 9-12pt, like on the business <br>card for instance.

<div class=commentbody>The alternate E's are excellent. Each is used in just the right places. Very, very elegant. <br> <br>There's something awkward about the numeral 3 but I'm not sure what it is. My instincts say it's slightly topheavy or left-leaning but when I examine it closely I'm not so sure. Maybe it's just too centered and ordinary among all the high and low crossbars. Try giving your 3 and 5 the same center as your 6 and 8. <br> <br>tangent: What is this, E's can't be round anymore because of the Euro? That's silly.</div>

<div class=commentbody>I would also like to applaud the nice work. <br> <br>I, too, feel that the numerals, 3-4, seem a little off. I think the "3" feels especially light, because it is positioned next to the "2", which seems to be the heaviest of the numerals. In fact, try turning the "2" upside down to see if it still feels even (in regard to weight) with the rest of the set. Maybe mix up the order a little to see how each numeral feels. <br> <br>Again, great work! <br> <br>Aloha, <br>Scott</div>

<div class=commentbody>Wonderfully elegant letters. And yes, the double o does work when it is small. <br> <br>My impression is that the word spacing is much too wide. <br> <br>Bringhurst says that a common word space is a quarter of an em. Yours looks to be three times that. </div>

<div class=commentbody>Also according to Bringhurst hanging numerals are meant to go with lower case (or small caps). They don't work with your all caps face, as you mentioned - probably for this reason. <br> <br>If you made small caps to go with your caps, which might be nice if you want to use this in other contexts, or to sell it commercially, then the hanging figures should be proportioned in size and weight to the small caps. <br> <br>Incidentally, in your small showing the E is not as closely spaced to the ligature TH; it should be closer, I think. </div>

<div class=commentbody>I saw your thread as it started but haven't been following it. Now I come back and wow, that is a HUGE improvement over what you had started with. <br> <br>But I agree with William on the hanging numerals and the word spacing. <br> <br>Good job, and keep at it, this could be just perfect.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Your lining numerals are so much better formed than your old-style numerals that I think you should just throw the old-style ones out. They really don't match or live up to this exquisite font. <br> <br>I agree that the word spacing could be tightened <i>some,</i> but I don't agree that it should be reduced to a quarter-em like any other font. The nice airy feel is well served by giving each word breathing room.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Looking at the business card the word spacing seems to work with this font I would not close it much tighter. The RN in Horne seems a bit tight and have you looked at lowering the middle horizontal stress of the E and on the second E in Elizabeth you could lengthen the bottom horizontal to tighten the space to the TH lig. On the reverse the Us seem a bit high and the Ss could break the baseline a bit further, on the point of word spacing I think the address line should break so that you read Street and not Saint. This thread makes for interesting reading.</div>

<div class=commentbody>here is a screenshot of a poster for the typeface. I need <br>it for the end of year exhibition. The type at the bottom <br>reads "eliza: a new typeface in 3 weights by kris <br>sowersby". Hot damn I am almost finished this! Thanks <br>fer all your comments so far. I will work on the ETH <br>spacing in "elizabeth". I originally had the top arm of the <br>E slightly shortened, and the spacing worked out a <br>treat. Somewhere along the line it fell away...but will be <br>restored soon. I will keep the os figures because I quite <br>like them. I will probably add smallcaps and/or a lower <br>case sometime in the future. <br> <br> <br><img src=http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/19595.jpg alt></div>

<div class=commentbody>Congratulations on this typeface, Kris. You are I gather a graduating student; I don't know what the market is like for type designers, but you sure have a gift for it. <br> <br>I would suggest posting Eliza to the 'sans' thread here and getting some critique from the pro type designers - who probably look at those threads more - to help your final polishing. </div>

<div class=commentbody>**blush** so many compliments - thanks! I am a <br>graduating student. I also live in New Zealand, and <br>there is, to my knowledge, only one type foundry.
