body: "Hello,\r\n\r\nI was wondering if anyone could help us out on i.d'ing the masthead,
  blackletter-type font of this publication. I have no further information on the
  font, designers etc. Any help or close matches to this font would be greatly appreciated.
  I am a student who wants to use something similar in a project. (I am especially
  fond of the capitals, namely, the lovely 'P').\r\n\r\nMany Thanks,\r\n\r\nFaron

  body: That's quite clearly a beautiful, but custom, design. There are quite a few
    elaborately ornamented blackletter faces (which look nothing like this one) -
    google for ornamented blackletter.  Incidentally, the newspaper name is called
    the Nameplate. The masthead is the list, usually, inside, of the newspaper's owners,
    publishers, editors, and principal staff members.     - Herb
