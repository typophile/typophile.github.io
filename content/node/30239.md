body: "I have been using Illustrator for quite some time, and I can't believe they
  haven't built in a  modulated stroke function. Something where you can make a line
  start at one thickness and then end at another, and adjust it in between just they
  way you adjust a gradient. It seems so basic. Currently I believe the only way to
  do this is make a brush then apply it to your shape, but then it's not adjustable.
  I hope someone from Adobe reads this. It would come in handy for a lot of logos
  I design.\r\n\r\n-Thomas"

    drawing to increase the stroke, and hitting the number 1 to decrease.\r\n\r\nOr
    is that a feature of Freehand? I haven't re-installed everything yet since reloading
    my computer, or else I would check."

    you have an option to alter diameter to random or depending on pressure, tilt
    and so on.\r\nBut I guess there is not much fun without tablet."

    \r\n\r\nI think the answer is that Adobe has an aversion to supporting anything
    Corel had in their product prior to 1998. ;-)\r\n\r\nCheers, Si"

  body: "There's an easy way to do this: make a long triangular brush and tweak the
    shape to change the thickness it starts and stops at. You can do similar tricks
    with brushes that have sets of points at the ends and middle to make it narrow,
    widen, then narrow again. \r\n\r\nThe downside is that when you have to make sure
    that when you change the brush, you don't apply the change to every line it's
    been used on.\r\n\r\nBut I tend to agree with Tom; Adobe needs to start focusing
    on longstanding customer complaints/needs and stop just adding new features without
    much thought as to what the software is really <em>missing</em>."
