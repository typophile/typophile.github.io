  the hand drawn or hand made quality of my design work. I like hand drawn typography
  but also screen print and sew occasionally.  For the logo I want it to be like a
  humble seal of quality. My last name is Hagadorn  so I plan on putting my name around
  or under the mark. \r\n\r\nThis is an early-ish sketch, let me know what you think."

  body: Maybe it's just me, but the difference in the widths of the loops keeps me
    searching to read something other, if not instead, than an H.

  body: "I agree with riccard0. I, too, was wondering if it's \"just an H\" or some
    sort of ligature. \r\n\r\nI do like it, though, and perhaps with the inclusion
    of your full name, the H will become more obvious. "

    name and website associated with your user ID? Typophile and Google are best buds.
    When you graduate and start job hunting, your account and this page will still
    be here, ranking very high on Google for \"Stephanie Hagadorn\" logo design, and
    branding. \r\n\r\nJust something to think about...."

  body: "Stephanie,\r\n\r\nI didn't realize how old this original post was. It may
    be a bit late, now... but here are some of my thoughts.\r\n\r\nI too like the
    simplicity of the design. But I also read it as a dp as well as an H. If you wish
    to lessen the confusion, it may be best to reduce the width of the loops, shown
    here. The reason they're reading as dp is that they are approximately the width
    of what those characters would be as compared to the cap H.\r\n\r\nThings to consider--
    \r\n\u2022 Italicizing the H might lessen the likelihood of it reading as a dp.(bottom
    left)\r\n\u2022 You mentioned hand written work, and sewing. Perhaps a more script
    looking H (bottom right)\r\n\u2022 And finally, perhaps tying it all together
    by using the same design in your name below and/or choosing a typeface that mimics
    the look of the logo.\r\n\r\nHope this helps.\r\n\r\nRob\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/hagadornROB_5001.jpg]"

  body: "Keep cleaning up your loops paths to create a happy medium between an <em>H</em>
    and a <em>dP</em>. What I don't think you should've changed is the weight of the
    top and bottom <em>H</em> stems. Your O.P. is kind of reminisce of how pressure-sensitive
    Wacom styluses are, if you use one, and their illustration capabilities.\r\n\r\nMy
    takeaway is keep rounding out the loops so they flow and form a nice crossbar,
    revert back to the old weight of the top and bottom <em>H</em> stems and try to
    retain the hand-drawn qualities beyond the mark."
