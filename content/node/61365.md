  body: "I checked Parts 11 and 6 in my Script Guide, and I looked at Comic fonts
    at Dafont & MyFonts. Lots of similar things, but nothing I recognized as identical.
    Blambot & Comicraft are full of all-caps comic styles, although your sample is
    a bit more erratic/irregular than most of them. More like amateur felt pen lettering.\r\n\r\nLast
    place I will look before I quit will be handwriting fonts at Dafont. If it's not
    there I give up.\r\n\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
