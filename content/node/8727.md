body: 'I am thinking of using Caecilia for a pocket book &#40;font size 8 pt, leading
  11 pt&#41;. It&#39;s an anthology, no texts will be longer than 750 words. My customer
  has vaguely hinted that he likes sans serifs but I think this typeface would provide
  better readability without losing the modern feel he is looking for. Any input on
  all this? <BR> <BR>Also, what sans serifs go well with Caecila &#40;for header,
  subheader, author&#39;s name&#41;? Is Franklin Gothic out of question? &#40;I thought
  so at first but now I guess I&#39;ve been staring at my printouts too much, and
  I&#39;m honestly quite confused&#41;. <BR> <BR>EDIT: First post, wrong board. I&#39;m
  terribly sorry...'

  body: I prefer Caecilia, but remember that it&#39;s quite wide compared to  <BR>most
    modern faces, so you might want to set it smaller. I think  <BR>your 8/11 is a
    good choice.

  body: Thank you. TheSans is nice. Unfortunately I&#39;m on a tight budget, but I&#39;ll
    try a couple of similar faces.
