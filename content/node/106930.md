body: "Hi Guys,\r\n\r\nI was hoping you might be able to help me identify two different
  fonts please?\r\nSpecifically im looking at Iding the VS in the first image - I
  think the first is an uber condensed version of futura that might be bespoke?\r\n\r\nAs
  for the second, im not too sure again it may be a bespoke font.\r\n\r\nAny help
  or insight would be hugely appreciated.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nRobyn\r\n"
