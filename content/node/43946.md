  says \"move is empty\" and says the point is invisible and should be removed. However,
  if you remove it the next node says the same thing. Anybody know what this means?
  I can't find a reference to it in the manual or elsewhere.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\n\r\nStephen

    several points piled on top of each other (sometimes tens of points) this happens
    quite often as a result of autotracing. '

  body: "I wondered about that, but I'm still uncertain. I selected the point and
    deleted it completely and still the next point showed the same. Perhaps there
    is a complete double of everything. It was a result of autotracing. I was experimenting
    with doing a textured version of a glyph that I added texture to in Photoshop.
    I tried several settings for autotrace, but getting clean points with that method
    is doesn't seem probable.I wonder if maybe its got conflicting contour directions
    and thus doesn't recognize the adjoining point.\r\n\r\nJust tried an experiment.
    Fontlab crashed on me earlier and thus reverted back to a point before these \"move
    is empty\" audits appeared. I believe it happened when I asked it to do to many
    fixes at once. It might have been the \"object too short\" fix. I did that again
    and they appeared again. Interestingly, if I copy a completed segment of the texture
    or glyph outline and paste it in another glyph window, the error message doesn't
    show. Then if I delete the original and replace it with the moved version, the
    error goes away.\r\n"
