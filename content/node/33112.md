  works well in small sizes in print but not on a monitor.  Is there a pixel or screen
  font that would look similar to Garamond that I could use?\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\n\r\nSharon"

  body: But pixel fonts aren't built to rotate either. How will a pixel font help
    with text on a curved path?

    do it all by hand, and it's seriously non-trivial.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: 'Well, its slightly arced with text at the top and bottom.  Mostly my problem
    is with letters like lower case y.  Parts of it disappear at the small size.  Hrant,
    I saw that garadot, but I can''t find a release of it.  But what you are saying
    is a pixel font won''t help.  Hmmm... '

  body: "What I was trying to say above is that I didn't think it was the curve that
    was causing the problem.  I thought it was the small size.  But maybe it's both!
    \ To add to the problem, it is white text on a dark blue background.  Go ahead
    and laugh. :-)\r\n\r\nSharon"

  body: "Yes, it's both (although mostly the size).\r\n\r\nA bitmap font will not
    only not help, but if it's an \"orthonormal\" design (with a lot of things lining
    up and being perpendicular) like Garamond (or really any conventional face) it
    will typically look [even] worse than an outline font. For curved bitmap text
    you either have to go to grayscaling (even more non-trivial) or you have to use
    a \"casual\" design (like a roundish cursive face) where the \"grid-busting\"
    is covered up.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    be to render an outline font and then clean up the grayscale pixels...\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
