body: ' Hello... <BR> <BR>I have a question that hasn&#39;t been answered to my satisfaction
  over at Adobe regarding the way Illustrator reads fonts in the Windows environment.  <BR>
  <BR>Often AI will display fonts in the font menu that it will not pull into a document
  when opened, claiming that the font&#40;s&#41; are unavailable. <BR> <BR>Also, when
  saving a document that uses fonts that I know are legitimate, purchased fonts, I
  will frequently receive a message stating that Illustrator is &#34;unable to create
  font subset&#34; and that &#34;protected fonts cannot be embedded&#34;. <BR> <BR>What&#39;s
  going on here? Anyone? <BR> <BR>Thanks! '

    it&#39;s odd, and I unfortunaly haven&#39;t got a solution. <BR> <BR>As for the
    protected fonts issue, legitimate purchased fonts often have a checkbox marked
    that protect the font from ebedding into documents. I have it you can change it
    in FG, but I doubt you&#39;re allowed by the license agreement. '

    in the <BR>Windows environment and have run into some <BR>strange kinks with all
    fonts &#40;let alone my own&#41;. <BR>From what I can figure out various versions
    <BR>of design programs &#40;esp. Quark &amp; Illustrator&#41; <BR>tend to create
    different results depending on <BR>the version of Windows. <BR>Very frustrating
    if you tend to lean towards <BR>obsessive perfectionism. '

  body: ' Are you running windows 98? If so I would recommend doing a search for &#34;adobefnt.lst&#34;
    and then deleting all of the files that it finds with that exact name. Then before
    starting any other adobe apps start photoshop first. It builds the best adobefnt.lst
    and all of the adobe apps share the same lst. That will fix some of the problems

  body: ' thanks tom. <BR>no, i&#39;m running windows 2000. <BR>it seems to be fonts
    that have been &#39;converted&#39; from mac to pc or from t1 to truetype that
    are at the heart of the problem. i&#39;ve spoken with adobe tech support &#40;some
    of the fonts in question were adobe&#41;, and the upshot of our back-and-forth
    dialog was that the problem most likely lies with fonts that have been altered
    in fontographer &#40;or crossfont, etc&#41;. at least that&#39;s been our best
    guess. i&#39;m not entirely sure how illustrator id&#39;s fonts for its menu,
    so i&#39;ve been unable to confirm this theory, but i can&#39;t think of anything
    else... '
