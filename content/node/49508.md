  body: "The script doesn't look much like anything digital that I know, other than
    [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/bitstream/monterey/|Mahogany/Monterey]] Script.
    The lower case seems to be close to a film type that the Solotype Catalog calls
    Jewell Script. My notes say this was shown as Piedmont Vertical Condensed in the
    Photo-Lettering Catalog, but the initials for that typeface are simpler than your
    samples.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: "I agree with Lex's call for the serif (at least in something digital). Mrs
    Eaves SC has the flat-topped 3, and the other attributes seem to match pretty
    well. The problem is that I don't think Mrs Eaves exists as metal type. So it's
    based on Baskerville, but I don't see any metal samples that have this '3'.\r\n\r\nIs
    there a technique to make a digital font look like letterpress?\r\n\r\n- Mike

  body: "<cite>Is there a technique to make a digital font look like letterpress?</cite>\r\nThe
    embossing that is often used on book jackets, usually stamped from the back to
    give a raised pattern on the front, must start with a template from the same font
    that will be printed on the front. The three different \"Great Ideas\" series
    from Penguin Books try and get a letterpress effect by stamping the front, however
    often the embossing and the ink don't align exactly."
