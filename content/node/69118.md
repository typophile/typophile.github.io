  recently became aware of the [[http://rixingtypography.blogspot.com/|Ri-Xing Letter
  Casting Firm]] (\u65E5\u661F\u9444\u5B57\u884C), what must be one of the last remaining
  traditional Chinese typefoundries in the world.\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Ri-XingLetterCastingFirm_p1_3905.jpg]\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Ri-XingLetterCastingFirm_p8_4077.jpg]\r\n\r\n\r\nYou
  can read a bit about them in English at [[http://wandering-taiwan.blogspot.com/2009/11/ri-xing-type-casting.html|this
  blog]], from where the above photos were lifted.\r\n\r\nThere is an effort underway
  to preserve and digitize many of the designs. The foundry is located in Taipei,
  and welcomes visitors and volunteers.\r\n\r\nTheir blog (in Chinese) is here: http://rixingtypography.blogspot.com/"
