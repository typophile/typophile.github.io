body: hello everyone, this is my first time in the forum and I love it! so much helpful
  info. <BR>I guess i thought of this topic because I myself am depressed. this is
  primarily due to he fact that I have not been able to design my own buisness card
  &#40;never truly happy with my results&#41;. I also find myself to be extremely
  self critical of my own work. This inturn makes it hard to start design projects.
  I&#39;m pretty sure this is common among other designers. maybe some feedback on
  this matter will help me as well as other designers. <BR> <BR>IM

  body: 'Being of hispanic heritage my dream would be to promote social change. Minorities
    are often depicted in an unfavorable way, this is due to the fact that minorities
    have not taken a true interest in promoting a good self-image. Often the image
    displayed are from people who have no idea what it means to be a minority. This
    depiction become our an unwanted representation of who we are. example: I find
    it desturbing to see minorities in movies cast as &#34;maintenance workers&#34;
    or &#34;waiters&#34; things like that. I would also like to be able to help design
    better products for companies who export their goods to the USA. I belive better
    design promotes economic growth. This is my goal.'

  body: I have designed many business cards and logos for myself over the past 40
    or so years.  I have never had any of them printed.  I look at them a few weeks
    later and say, &#34;I can do better.&#34;  What you have to realize is that you
    grow as a person and a designer every day so you will never design something good
    enough for the you who will see it a few months from now.  There is a place where
    you have to say, &#34;This will work for today.&#34; and just accept your human
    failings as they are.  You cannot ever be perfect but you can be satisfied to
    know you tried your best in the amount of time you had.  Remember, a business
    card, above all, is just a place to put your name and phone number, not your soul.  Take
    the pressure off of yourself.   <BR>Take 4 hours only and design a card. Print
    it on a Laser printer, that way it does not seem so precious or so permanent.
    If in 6 months, you can&#39;t stand it, do another 4 hour maximim card and go
    about your life. <BR> <BR>My family came here to the US from Greece.  We are such
    a small minority that nobody even knows we exist. I have worked sweeping floors
    in a resturant, as a laborer in a steel mill, and as a laborer in a construction
    job.  It was hard, dirty, tiring work but it was honest work and nothing to be
    ashamed of.  I worked my way through college and now work in an office as a designer
    but I am the same person I was in the steel mill scraping slag with a pick and
    shovel. <BR> <BR>Don&#39;t worry what biggotted fools may think of your herritage.  You
    know better.  Be proud of who you are inside right now, today. Don&#39;t measure
    your success as a human being by the size of your bank account--certainly not
    by the comments of fools.   <BR>The way you talk about your dreams to make the
    world a better place tells me you have the soul of a great man. The best thing
    you can do in this world is help others and love your family. You can do that
    as a designer as well as anything else. <BR> <BR>Best of good luck to you, <BR>

    <BR>When I&#39;m particuIarly happy with something, I have a tendency to let criticism

  body: There is an established link between depression and crerativity. Depression
    is most dangerous when you lose touch with your feelings. Because you are aware
    of the issue and are talking about it you are already addressing it in the most
    productive way there is.  <BR> <BR>Don&#39;t be so hard on yourself! Of course
    your business cards aren&#39;t perfect -- nothing is perfect. Enjoy the process
    and do the best you can.

    made me think that the problem is not if there&#39;s or not <BR>something perfect
    -- in typographic design as well as under <BR>other human perspectives &amp; relations.
    <BR>This link is interesting <a href="http://seeing.nypl.org/" target="_blank">http://seeing.nypl.org/</a>
    <BR>but would you dare to say that God is not perfect? <BR>It is also interesting
    to note that the actual Greek root <BR>of the word &#39;problem,&#39; namely,
    &#39;probalein,&#39; means &#39;to throw&#39; <BR>or &#39;to thrust forward.&#39;  <BR>Problems
    are the very means by which God drives us forward. <BR>Without problems, there

  body: I myself have gone through a major depression due to my obssesive nature about
    design,typography and life. So much so, that all sense of rationale and logic
    was lost in my wee little brain. I was forced, by my own mind, to stop designing
    all together&#40;and go fishing <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"
    ALT=":-&#41;" BORDER=0> &#41;. Once I did that, the design bug came back to bite
    me in the &#149;&#149;&#149; a year later. I learned a great deal about myself
    when I was depressed. The main thing I realized is that I am sad some days and
    happy others. As I have gotten  a little older I have learned to embrace the depression.
    I feel sad when I am sad. I feel happy when I am happy. Don&#39;t suppress your
    feelings. Breathing &#40;and Design&#41; ultimatey will make you feel alive. Alive
    doesn&#39;t have to be happy or sad it can be both....Enjoy both. This is just
    my personal expierience. Everyone is different, but judging from this thread,
    alot of us are the same. Let pain and joy guide you simultaniously.  All the best

    effeciency. It&#39;s better to make any  decision &#40;good or bad&#41; than no
    decision. Go out and find something that looks like s&#42;&#42;t and redesign

    have on sale &#40;except the initial Ottomat, in part, and the latter Ogilve&#41;
    were designed in a constant state of disgust and continuous doubt. As I was working
    of them &#40;and in many moments I gave up&#41; they seemed just worthless and
    ugly. <BR>Only after regaining balance I became able to look at them objectively,
    and see what was good in them. <BR> <BR>My only advice &#40;which is probably
    the best I always received from many people&#41; is to finish each thing you start,
    no matter how ugly or senseless it may seem. <BR>It&#39;s not easy &#40;I&#39;m
    rarely able to do so myself&#41; but it&#39;s the only way to reacquire a critical
    perspective.'

  body: '&#62;&#62;I get obsessive about details and then wonder if anyone will ever
    nottice them.  <BR> <BR>Yep. <BR> <BR>&#62;&#62;almost all the few typefaces I
    have on sale &#40;except the initial Ottomat, in part, and the latter Ogilve&#41;
    were designed in a constant state of disgust and continuous doubt. <BR> <BR>Agreed.
    <BR> <BR>I am in an interesting place. People come in wanting &#34;business cards
    printed&#34;. Totally unaware of design. I could just slap something up, shudder
    and print it. But it is much more exciting trying to explain in 5 mins or less
    what I can do that is much better. It might cost a little more, but the business
    card will be better for it. I feel like this is the front line, as it were. Sometimes
    I get waverings of depression thinking &#34;Garrgh, no-one cares!&#34; but choose
    to ignore it and get stuck in. I like the challenge of severe time restraints
    now, quoting and charging accurately are very interesting. I was also afraid that
    my type desiging time will get eaten into, but have decided to do some of my proofs
    on small signage jobs! Pretty cheeky, but I reckon it will be effective. '

  body: Hey everyone, thank you so much for you insight. It has been helping me quite
    a bit. Now if you can give your insoght on a personal desigh project, it would
    be greatly appreciated. I am currently designing a buiseness card for myself.
    It includes simple yet elegant type letterpressed on 100 percent cotton card stock.
    Now the design element I want to incorporate is the use of custom made rubber
    stamps of some of my &#34;type&#34; specimens and artwork. Since I will make several
    rubber stamps I&#39;ll have a few unique cards I can distribute to clients. I
    feel this will give the design a feeling of individuality and imagination. And
    if I ever get tired of a specific image I can just have new rubbrestamps made.
    What do you think?

    way to get ink and color on paper for 55 years. My late colleague and fellow member
    of the National Cartoonists Society, Charles Schulz, suffered from severe depression
    despite the fact that he made the Forbes list of the richest people in the world.
    Clinical depression is a medical condition that should be treated.  Occasional
    depression is something else. Perhaps we take ourselves too seriously at times
    and that we should find ways to lighten up. I&#39;m sure Mr. Lozos, who was in
    Vietnam would agree, that there are so many more opportunities to enjoy life when
    one isn&#39;t being shot at. Even then, things could always be worse, no matter
    the present situation. Descartes, a brilliant mind of the enlightened 17th century,
    said: I think,  therefore I am. It may sound trite to you but it works. I hope
    this helps. Good luck. <BR>PG <BR><a href="http://giam.typepad.com/the_branding_of_polaroid_/"

  body: '&#62; what was a lowpoint? <BR> <BR>Losing electricity halfway into writing
    a program on my C64? I guess not. Worse still was when the fighting was so bad
    around our building that we&#39;d have to go down to the bomb shelter. Usually
    I could convince my parents that we were essentially safe in this central room
    in our 6th floor apartment&#42;, but I remember the time my mother went to the
    kitchen to get some hot water for tea, and the light from the candle she was holding
    attracted an RPG straight into the laundry room next to the kitchen. We all ran
    to her, she was OK, but then a second one hit the division between our floor and
    the lower floor - basically half a meter higher and we would of all been toast.
    We were all deaf for a few minutes. Then my father glared at me and said &#34;We&#39;re
    going down to the shelter now&#34;... But that was just a bit frightening, not
    a &#34;lowpoint&#34;. The major lowpoint was when a close uncle got assasinated.
    His son recently wrote a great book, though - I highly recommend it: <BR><a href="http://images-eu.amazon.com/images/P/0743222830.01.LZZZZZZZ.jpg"

    <BR> <BR>&#42; Some of my best work painting D&amp;D miniatures was done by candle-light
    in that room, with Kalashnikovs and mortars raging in the neighborhood, with the
    beautiful, primordial prayers from the mosques blasting to encourage the fighters.
    <BR> <BR>My theory is that you miss <i>anything</i> that happened during your
    childhood. And if your childhood was messed up, that simply results in you having
    a messed up sense of what&#39;s healthy. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>'
