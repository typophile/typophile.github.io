I am doing a project for school and if it works out the way I want, I will need people's opinions and knowledge on teen pregnancy. The survey is to find out how much people know and what they think, not to find the actual facts. I posted the survey on monkeysurvey.com. its only 10 questions shouldnt take more than 1-2 minutes. I know I cant stop you, but please if you do take it don't just randomly click answers.

<a href="http://www.surveymonkey.com/s/B3TS9H6">survey</a>

Thanks in advance if you do take it. 

If anyone is interested I made a short video with some of the facts.

		<div class="commentbody">Why pick on teens?
Teen pregnancy is perfectly natural, and healthier than later.
More problematic:
How about a survey on 40+ pregnancy?
In vitro?
Senior hysterectomies?
That's my opinion on your survey.
Nothing like framing an issue by aggregating answers to leading questions, from people with a subjective opinion on something they haven't studied and know very little about.
No I'm not naive: I haven't looked at the survey, but I suspect it is really about teenagers having sex out of wedlock and abortion.

		<div class="commentbody">OK, sorry, but now I had a look at the survey, and as suspected the general presumption is that there is something wrong with teenage pregnancy. Don't you think that's rather prejudiced against young couples under 20 who start a family? it's tough enough for them anyway, without this stigma. "Teen Pregnancy" is a loaded concept, encompassing as it does 13-yr olds.

Teenage pregnancy is a worthwhile social goal, rather than the present trend in society, which is towards more Middle-age Pregnancy. A woman is most fertile at 18, and pregnancy complications increase significantly after age 35.

Of course, the way things are at the moment, there are all kinds of impediments to early pregnancy, most notably the impact it has on a woman's career.

Why not call the survey "High School Pregnancy"?

		<div class="commentbody">Your survey is full of suggestive questions, limited answer-sets, and radical ideology.

I am sure that you will gain no insight what so ever. Even if you do not aim on that, and just want to use it for ideology purposes, the questionary is so obviously flawed, that it will only backfire.

I don't think, I really could make you understand, but... forget for a moment everything what you thought to be true. Look at some facts.

This is [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Map-world-teenage-biological-mothers2002.svg|a world map for teenage pregnancy]]. It clearly shows the US has a significant higher percentage than other developed countries. 

What could the reason for that be? 
Teenage pregnancy is a problem of information and education that sex is ok, if one has respect for oneself and for the other. Teenagers are way more capable of making responsible decisions, than one might think. This kind of eduction would not be primarily focused on STDs and abstinence, just to scare teens off, like it happens in places in the US.

The norms of a society majorly influence teenage pregnancy. 

Compare the high values of teen pregnancy with high age of consent by law in the US and in [[http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Age_of_Consent.png|northern and western European countries]]. There is a negative correlation. Why? because law is just the normative formulation of the moral values of a society. Compare as well for example with this [[http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Atheists_Agnostics_Zuckerman_en.svg|map about atheists]].

Another part of the story is of course economically as well. To highlight this one could take a look at this map of [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Gini_Coefficient_World_CIA_Report_2009.png|global inequality of wealth per country. low value is a more equal society.]]

The law is a formulation of one set of moral values within a society. The sexualisation of children in advertising and pornographication of sexuality in popular culture demonstrates the active moral values of North American society at large, and has a much more direct impact on the attitude and behaviour of teenagers than either laws or sex education programmes. In most other parts of the world, traditional cultural moral values tend to be less eroded by free market capitalism than they are in North America -- although constantly under assault --, and sexualised advertising, music and film is not considered acceptable. The perverse approach to sex education in the USA is a desperate counter-guard fight against the prevailing social mores, ironically enacted by the same politicians who committed the country to the neo-con radical free market agenda that always and everywhere erodes the traditional values they try to prop up by legislative means.</div>

<em>This is a world map for teenage pregnancy. It clearly shows the US has a significant higher percentage than other developed countries.</em>

No it doesn't, because it's a map for live births.
Perhaps the US would be closer to other developed countries if abortions were easier to get there.

Also, the map doesn't show the average age of (mothers who give) live births.
I wonder how different that would be.

According to WHO data, there are 21 abortions per 1000 women per year in the USA and 12 in Western Europe. I don't remember which year. [[http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2011/01/11/AR2011011107331.html|Washington Post]] reports the rate as 19

Yes, unfortunately the statistics show that's very true. The children often grow up in poverty (or at least in financial difficulty), if the mother works outside the home they are often raised largely by a grandmother or other relative, and they often grow up with no father figure. I personally know several families in this situation.</div>

I don't understand how typophile is a bad place to get responses? It isn't my main source and the members do have brains and can take a survey. It is design related, it isn't a design that I'm asking for criticism on. Its part of the process of creating the design just like finding the right type face is part of the process. If it was a regular survey completely unrelated to design I would not have posted it here, it really does not belong on typophile.</div>

Well, my rationale for not taking the survey wasn't because it is off topic (though it is), but rather because the survey itself is rather poorly designed. Your questions involve tacit presuppositions which force the taker to choose between a variety of incorrect and potentially misleading answers.

I was not saying it 'information design,' I was answering someone as how it is design related. In an information design project I don't see how the research part is really different than picking a font. They both are a form of research for the design at hand. Yes, maybe if I put this in the critic forum or type id I would understand the whole this is not in the right place, but it clearly states "General Discussions Anything goes" which is why I felt I can post this with out breaking any rules.

I will be honest, thanks for trying to help me. Its finals weeks for me and I also have  a list of books I need to read, so I wont be able to read any of those books by the time I hand in this project. Would you be able to pick one of my questions and tell me why its wrong and why you're recommending these books?</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I assume your attempt is sincere and I actually don't mind a completely different opinion, as long as the research that forms that opinion follows some rules of deduction. My problem is, that your attempt to research fails any criteria that would be somehow scientific. 

I send you some articles of scientific journals on the topic, you can do your own research if you want to. If previous research would answer the current research question, then the current research question would not be necessary. Previews findings are important to understand a topic and to know which questions one need to ask in the first place to get new information. 

These four papers are highly relevant, as they will show important factors of teenage pregnancy in western industrialized societies. They help you to establish which factors that can influence an outcome are constant throughout the research and which do variable. With this information you can ask yourself why is your case different? What is the same and what is different in your case, than in other cases? There lies the key to the question about what ever you want to find out. As you can not experiment with society at large, you can only compare and try eliminate factors that do not have an influence. 

These papers as I said will help you to design the questionnaire in a better way. 

To your questionnaire, if you want to discuss it here, we can, but the content should rather be discussed in a social science related environment, rather than a graphic design. 

if you want me to really help me, then you can write what you actually want to find out with each question, which information do you want to get from your sample of interviewees?

		<div class="commentbody">You mix up a lot in your questionnaire, if you just want to test knowledge. I would as well check the source of your facts, if this is based on solid science. 

Example: The Q2 and many of its answers confuse pregnancy with sex. This is ideologically laden. 

You say you test knowledge, when you actually don't, you test opinions as well in Q3, Q4, Q7 (subjective, socially determined). Not only do you test opinions, when you think you test knowledge, but you have a very limited answer-set, which does in the understanding of some do not reflect the real causes or do not describe the issue correctly. 

That is why I send you some papers, so you can think again if your “facts” actually mean anything.

How can my stats be wrong because its all guys on here? The stats are suppose to show what people think/know are you implying guys are not people?

Té Rowan:
Yes, it may be completely pointless for you to take it because you gain nothing from it. Whether a person thinks about it or cares at all about the topic their answers will still be valid for my goal. 

flooce:
You can say my answers are very limited but that is the facts I found. I am not asking anyone to go and study up to find the answers. Its merely a test to see what the general public's knowledge is on the topic. If someone came around asking "How many people do you think live in the US today? A B C D E F" You only have 6 answers which you can argue is limited. The correct answer is amongst the six and you arent only given 2 choices which would make the results useless because its a 50/50 chance of getting the right answer. 
I had questions I am answering in  my project and asked the same questions in my survey. In the survey I listed the answers I found in my research. I test opinions or knowledge whats the difference, when saying people think or say this when asked question A? The way people answer is based on their opinion which comes from their knowledge. None of my questions are "whats your favorite ice cream flavor?" Yes that is opinion and not fact. My questions are facts, you can have an opinion or think you know something but its not an opinion based question.</div>

My teacher knows I made the survey and I have posted it to our class blog like she told me to do. 
I hear people's comments and agree that my original survey is severely flawed. I just don't understand how the new one is or how asking my professor's opinion will make a difference on people's opinion on here. I asked the questions and supplied all the answers I found on reliable sources. What else is there to do? I didn't make up answers so I won't be getting answers I want to hear its facts and social misconceptions. I have 18 responses for my new survey and 72 for my original. If I don't get at least 50 responses to the new one I am going to leave the part of "public's knowledge" out of my design.</div>

Okay but I was suggesting that you ask your teacher's opinion about the way the survey is written.

Sorry, I should have been clearer in responding. She told me to put it up on the blog because its the way we communicate and she also said that the class and her should take the survey. 

I appreciate people trying to help me with the quality of the survey. I'm wondering do people know the actual answers or what the sources say, that everyone is saying my answers are limited? 
Questions 1, 2, 3, 6, 8, and 9 how are they bad survey questions? 

I don't know anymore, to be honest I thought the survey was decent. I asked questions and gave the answers reliable sources(no articles and newspapers) supplied.

  <div class="comment card m-3">
	<div class="card-body">
		<div class="commentbody">I don't know what the actual hypothesis you are trying to investigate is, so some of my comments might be off base, but here are a few things for you to consider.

With respect to questions 2 and 3, I don't really see how people's responses here could possibly be interesting or informative. I can't figure out what type of investigation would actually care whether people know or don't know the specific numeric values which you give; I <em> can </em> see one trying to establish whether people's assessment of the prevalence of teen pregnancy is accurate, and whether their views on this matter correlate with attitudes towards teen pregnancy, but asking a question about raw numbers won't achieve this. Unless you have some way of establishing whether your respondents have a reasonably accurate view of the *size* of the relevant demographic, I don't see how you could possibly interpret their responses. Also, it's somewhat odd that in Q3 the entire range of 100 000–200 000 is omitted from your set of answers.

Also, bear in mind that when you start posting your survey on forums such as this one, you are appealing to an international audience. Most non-Americans have no real reason to know stats on teen pregnancy in the USA (you might perhaps want to reconsider some of Té Rowan's comments in this light -- he's posting from Iceland).

Question 4 and 5, though, are where the real problems lie. In question (4) you ask for reasons why teens have sex, but some of your answers seem to be more appropriate for a question regarding why teens get pregnant. 'Rape' and 'Taught abstinence Only' do not make sense to me as reasons why people have sex, though they might be reasons why they get pregnant. 'Lack of Education' only makes sense as an answer to this question if you are making the implicit assumption that teen sex is somehow bad and that only those who don't know better would do it. I can't help wondering whether you haven't inadvertently conflated two different questions here.

Putting that aside and assuming you really are asking about sex rather than pregnancy, your answer set is simply strange in terms of what it omits. Adults have sex for a wide variety of reasons including, among others, the fact that it is enjoyable, the fact that it can strengthen social bonds, and the simple fact that human beings have biological urges. Yet you omit all of these as possible answers suggesting that teens have sex for entirely different reasons than adults.

Now it's possible that this is the case, and perhaps you do believe this, but if you want to make some claim regarding why teens have sex, you cannot build this assumption into your answer set. The majority of your answers seem to presuppose that teens don't have an inherent desire for sex, but rather have this imposed on them by outside factors. Once again, it is possible that this is the case (or is the case in some instances), but if you limit your answer set to possibilities which make this assumption you are not going to get meaningful results (and of course, even if you did include a wider range of possibilities, establishing why people *think* teens have sex cannot be used to argue for why teens *actually* have sex which is, most likely, fairly heterogeneous anyways).

Question 5 is poorly constructed since it isn't clear whether you are talking about preventing teen pregnancy or preventing *unwanted* teen pregnance -- two entirely different issues. Also, given the weird blend of responses in question 4 which appear to conflate sex and pregnancy, I also find myself with a lingering worry that you are doing the same thing here and contemplating ways of preventing *sex* rather than pregnancy (at least for the answers 2, 3 and 5).

Also, use of contraceptives and abstinence fall into an entirely different category than education through parents, schools, or after-school programs. It's not clear that they really belong in the same answer set.

Moreover, your educational options are overly vague. You give, for example, the possible answer 'parents talking to their kids'. Talking about what? Contraception? Eternal Damnation? These answers really should be made more precise or you will not have any way of determining exactly how your respondents were interpreting these.

Finally, I think you'd get considerably better data if you asked about a more narrowly defined demographic than 'teen' -- after all, this would include middle schoolers, high schoolers, as well as many college freshmen and sophomores. I think you'll find that people's attitudes towards sex are *very* different for these three demographics.

Yes, your pre-existing knowledge.
Whether you do or don't know a thing about the subject you fall under the category of the general public. What I am trying to achieve is finding out what the world thinks/knows. Thinking can be wrong and based on inaccurate information. 
This is the basic idea of what I am trying to achieve. The design is just to portray my goal.
