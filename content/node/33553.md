  It is used on all headers (not mast head) for example in the visual \"the independent
  state of kate\".\r\n\r\nI have checked it against Chevin and there are slight differences
  with the n. Would be great for help.\r\n\r\nCheers"

    (an extra bold and an italic), why not go for Chevin? We bought it, used it and
    were really happy with it. What are you going to use it for?"

    17</a>, but there is only one style.

  body: "It seems to be a bit too late (an probably unimportant) but I don't think
    that is Typ1451\r\nI believe it is 'GravoStyle Basic' released by Optimo not too
    long ago. \r\nhttp://www.optimo.ch/pages/departement/view_font.php\r\n\r\nThe
    differences are small, but if you look toward the bottom of the cover (I know
    it is tiny), at \"Derek\" you can see the \"D\" is more squared than the D of
    Typ1451, much like DIN 17 that Stephen pointed to.\r\n\r\nBy the way, GravoStyle
    also has Regular, Bold and Black weights, plus italics for each.\r\n\r\nAnyway,
    just my 2\xA2\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/typ_Rubdown_dazed_6147.jpg]"
