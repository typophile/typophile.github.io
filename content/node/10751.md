body: If you were thinking about attending a typography conference, who would you
  be most thrilled to see on the speaker list? Who have you always wanted to meet
  at such an event, or hear speak about his/her work or another typographic topic?
  <BR> <BR>This is not an entirely hypothetical question, so please limit your &#39;dream
  speaker&#39; choices to the living.

  body: Michael Harvey... I&#39;d like to hear him talk about inscriptions, calligraphy,
    lettering and type design, or even do a workshop &#40;in Vancouver! I think that&#39;s
    what you&#39;re getting at, John? Could you invite him?&#41;. <BR> <BR>Akira Kobayashi...
    has he designed any Japanese typefaces? I&#39;d like him to talk about the new
    Optima he&#39;s working on with Hermann Zapf. And of course, I&#39;d like to hear
    Mr. Zapf too. <BR> <BR>Gerrit Noordzij... on graphology vs. type design. <BR>
    <BR>Matthew Carter... on his work.

    but Rene Knip is an interesting suggestion. The man is in fact a type designer
    but he does not only design the outlines, also the material, colour, etc. He&#39;s
    now working on a street name project for a new district of Amsterdam. <BR>How
    did you come across him? <BR>'

    far as how you see what I send. Is there a better way to set up my prefs? <BR>
    <BR>Rene Knip&#39;s work was introduced to me through an extremely memorable lecture
    given by Gerard Unger at Reading. He showed slides and slides of Rene&#39;s work
    and I became increasing intrested. I&#39;ve only be able to find one english article
    about him and it was too short &#40;Graphis&#41;. '
