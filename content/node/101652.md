  I'd like the A & C part seem as if it was chiseled.\r\nIf I may say so myself, I
  think my A is quite okay. But the C is driving me mad! \r\n\r\nI'd like to convey
  the effect in only two colours, and all the c's presented seems a bit off to me.
  Number 4, of course, is the most sketchy one. Just wanted your take on it, before
  I go on.\r\n\r\nbest regards\r\nMads\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/acccc_4963.png]"

    can''t. You were maybe approaching that with #4, but the logic isn''t consistent
    yet. I''d need to see the implied peak running through the spine of the letter
    for it to make sense.'

  body: "Are they supposed to be inset (engraved) or outset (relief)?  Judging from
    the shading on the A it appears outset (which is fine, as long as that's the effect
    you want).\r\n\r\nWith the C you seem to be having trouble visualizing which direction
    the light is shining from.  Going by the A it seems to be shining from straight
    above (12 o'clock), so in that respect #1 is actually closest to the right track.
    \ But you need to rethink the transition of shading from one side of the curve
    to the other.  Try starting with an angled transition as follows:\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>On
    the outside curve, a transition in the \\ direction, from dark to light, with
    the inner end starting at about 7 o'clock.\r\n<li>On the inside curve a parallel
    transition from light to dark, with the inner end starting at about 11 o'clock.\r\n<li>The
    outside ends of these two angled transition should both hit the edge of the letter
    at 9 o'clock.\r\n<li>During this transition, the centre spine will be unmarked
    (invisible).\r\n</ul>\r\nThat'll give you the basic idea.  Then you'll obviously
    want to tweak the angle of the transition so that it appears to reflect the curve
    of the letter (rather than being a straight line)."

  body: "Your first one is close to how I would do it. I would also add a shadow in
    the ball terminal, like this:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/acccc_6441_5637.png]\r\n\r\nI
    would also tend to do the shadow transitions on curves at 45 degrees. For this
    kind of effect, it tends to look better if the light is coming at a 45 degree
    angle, rather than straight vertically or horizontally. Those can work too, but
    you get less satisfying modeling of forms."

    flip it, I suspect the ball terminal will give you problems. Why not change it
    to a vertical serif?"

    quite a few of you, so I'm flattered you would take time to look at this. I also
    like that you all have a different take on it - makes me think that the task isn't
    easy :)\r\n\r\n@altsan - you're right: it actually does look outset. And I was
    in fact trying to do inset. Sadly, my lack of time and limited abilities will
    probably make me settle with this.\r\n\r\n@Mark Simonson & @Frode Bo Helland:\r\nI
    like both of your versions, and have drawn inspiration from both of them. Thanks
    a lot!\r\n\r\n@Luma Vine: Thanks for the references - very helpful.\r\n\r\nThis
