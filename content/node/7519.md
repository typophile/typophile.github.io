  <BR>Dan, in doing some research on Baskerville, I found an article by Bringhurst
  about Neoclassical types in an issue of Serif, and in it he&#39;s brought together
  many useful aspects of the RdR&#39;s development; for example he mentions the provenance
  of the various italics. If you&#39;d like a copy &#40;although some parts of <i>my</i>
  copy are actually hard to read&#41; just give me your ground address. <BR> <BR>hhp'

    to ask him about. I remember once running into his email address, but apparently
    have failed to keep it handy. Anybody out there who can give it to me? If privacy

  body: 'Baskerville italic: Yes, it&#39;s quite nice, especially in the lc. But I
    think the distribution of swashiness in the UC is a bit hare-brained. <BR> <BR>Transitional
    &#40;Neoclassical&#41; versus Modern &#40;Romantic&#41;: I much prefer the former;
    I would say the latter is too much of a good thing. And the duality you mention
    in the Neoclassical genre is an astute observation; it&#39;s something that I&#39;m
    trying to resolve well in my revival, by balancing lachrymal and pointy terminals,
    soft and hard transitions, etc. <BR> <BR>hhp'

  body: 'I think the identification of neoclassical type design as the stage between
    baroque and romantic is fairly obvious, both in terms of the chronology of Baskerville&#39;s
    work and its relationship to contemporary art, music, architecture, etc. It is
    precisely the ability to put type design in the broader cultural context that
    makes this art-historical terminology so much preferable than the specialised
    terminology of &#39;transitional&#39; and &#39;modern&#39;, which are meaningless
    in any broader context. <BR> <BR>Robert&#39;s real piece of brilliance in this
    area is, I think, the identification of <i>rococo</i> type design: the final flourishing
    of baroque before the restraining order of the neoclassical. This has contributed
    to a new interest in the work of Rosart and Fleischmann, which is very welcome.'

  body: The RdR marks the beginning of neoclassical type design. Although aspects
    of the style of the type belong to the baroque, the rationalist circumstances
    of its design make it part of the neoclassicist project. One could take the view
    that the work of the committee was neoclassicist, and Grandjean&#39;s interpretation
    of that work was more baroque.

    small edition, I think. It is called <i>Von der Romain du Roi zu den Schriften
    J.G. Justus Erich Walbaums: Eine Schriftstudie</i>, which means--&#34;from RdR
    to the typefaces of J.G. Justus Erich Walbaum; a study.&#34; It was written by
    Gustav Bohadti, and published by H. Berthold AG in Berlin and Stuttgart, 1957.
    <BR> <BR>It has a print of RdR paired with Granjean&#39;s true italic, from 1702.
    And then the same text is printed again with RdR and Alexandre&#39;s true italic,
    from 1712. <BR> <BR>Then come copies of specimen pages from Fournier, Didot, and
    Bodoni. Here&#39;s the cool part: it has one print comparing text set in RdR with
    Fournier, Didot, and Bodoni texts. <BR> <BR>And there is also a lot of text about
    Walbaum and H. Berthold AG, but that isn&#39;t as relevant to the forematter about
    RdR.'

  body: Actually, Hrant, the book is slim. Just about 75 pages. And there aren&#39;t
    that many images. It is just that even peripheral images of RdR are rare. So,
    I can still scan the images &#40;half of the images are Walbum stuff anyway&#41;,
    or just photocopy the whole book.
