    I was the typographic counterpart of that freaky music industry critique, what
    was his name? <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>

  body: I was actually talking about typefaces, but I&#39;d say that Hrant looks more
    like the former and not Navarro, simply because Hrant doesn&#39;t wear make-up.
    Although, I hope Navarro never stops. ;^&#41; <BR> <BR>Yes. Type separated at
    birth. And I&#39;m not trying to be a rabblerouser either. Some type, as Hrant
    pointed out, is honestly original on both sides, accept, they look identical.
    But, let us not be shy. Let&#39;s also show the type that one might wonder which
    came first, the chicken or the egg. Inspiration or deception?
