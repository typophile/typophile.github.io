  body: "Most likely depends on which PMS 296 you mean. Coated, Uncoated, Matte, etc.
    I'd probably check with your printer for best results and keep the design file
    in PMS for them to separate.\r\n\r\nFrom Illustrator CS3\r\n\r\nSolid to Process
    - 100/46/0/70\r\nCoated - 100/66/0/2\r\nUncoated - 100/94/0/29\r\nMatte - 100/46/0/70"

  body: "Thanks for your answer.\r\nIt's just that my client's version (recipe) of
    PMS 296 (solid to process) dates back to 2002.\r\nI have a 2005 Pantone swatch
    book and the recipe isn't the same.\r\nI just wanted to let them know that by
    declaring their logo PMS 296 they risk getting different shades of blue depending
    on which Pantone swatch book the designer has.\r\nI also wanted to know if my
    2005 recipe was the most recent. I know Pantone has released new swatch books
    but I don't have the latest version and was hoping to find someone with a more
    recent swatch book ie. 2006/2007 or 2008 to give me the recipe."

  body: My coated euroscale Pantone fan says 100c, 70m, 0y, 88k, but I can't remember
    when I bought this.

  body: "Mine says 100c, 73m, 30y, 83k so it must be 2005 or later. It's the color
    bridge coated, first edition, and I think I got it within the last 2 years.\r\n\r\nI'd
    use the formula guide, not Illustrator equivalents. \r\n\r\nSome printers will
    charge extra if you have them separate the PMS colors for you, might want to check. "

  body: "Hi you also have to look at how it is printed, Pantone changes colours like
    the wind, at least we are now aware of it. The best way I have found is to cross
    check with a SWOP Spot to Process vs Euroscale Spot to Process and make a educated
    guess based on how your printer prints AND THE STOCK you are printing on and also
    what they match to ie your proof or theirs. The safest way it to get the printer
    to match... though this can have unexpected results... because printers can get
    spots wrong.\r\n\r\nMy first choice has always been Euroscale Spot to Process.
    \ With magazines I use SWOP, though I am using Quickprint and Pagestore to manage
    this."
