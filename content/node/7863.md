  remember what fonts you have or if you have fonts that will fit your need. Bummer.
  Does an application exist to do the following: <BR> <BR>Scan the system for fonts,
  active and inactive <BR>Create a database: <BR>  catalog the metadata in the font
  &#40;type, foundry, date, weight, family&#41; <BR>  download keywords from a site
  like <a href="http://myfonts.com">myfonts.com</a> <BR> <BR>The purpose of this would
  be to make classifying, sorting, and searching your font collection painless. It
  should exist. ATM lets you create sets, but that has to be done manually for each
  family and there is no searching. No program I am aware of automates all these activities.
  None that I am aware of even creates a searchable database by keyword. <BR>However,
  it is an obvious idea... so where can I find it?'

    a database for your type, but you can easily see what is enabled or disabled,
    and you can organize your type however you see fit, by foundry, family, client,
    etc. It has a search function built in as well, and you can resolve duplicate
    issues.  <BR> <BR>Also try to get your hands on a document that was provided by
    Apple at this summer&#39;s TypeCon in SF, entitled &#34;Advanced Typography with
    Mac OSX.&#34; This would be a great resource for download from the Typophile site
    &#40;hint&#41;. This doc must exist as a pdf from Apple, try searching there first.  <BR>
    <BR>Good luck.'

  body: 'Have you tried Bitstream&#39;s Font Navigator? <BR> <BR>You can sort fonts
    by type &#40;according to the metadata tag, I assume&#41;. Then you can easily
    move them into folders for each type. <BR>Its still a manual solution, but at
    least you speed up the process by sorting into types. You can then install &amp;
    uninstall folders at a click. <BR> <BR>I think a fully automated solution would
    be impossible because many faces fall into more than one type category, and some
    are on the border of two or more. Type classification is a very subjective thing.
    <BR> <BR>Personally, I have: <BR>Serif 1 <BR>Sans 1 <BR>Slab 1 <BR>Script 1 <BR>Display
    1 <BR>Client 1 <BR>Symbol 1 <BR> <BR>always installed, with <BR> <BR>Serif 2 &amp;
    3 <BR>Sans 2 &amp; 3 <BR>Slab 2 <BR>Script 2 <BR>Display 2,3 &amp; 4 <BR>Client
    2 <BR> <BR>waiting to be browsed and/or installed if necessary. Anything I use
    often is in the first set. <BR> <BR>Font Navigator was bundled with Corel from
    about version 7, so you should be able to get it for next to nothing on e-bay.'
