  body: "This looks very similar to British Inserat. The letter 't' is violently different
    but just have a look at the link below\r\n\r\nhttp://www.linotype.com/310746/britishinserat-font.html\r\n\r\nHope
    it helps! Cheers!\r\n\r\n\r\n--\r\narjun"

  body: "Thanks Arjun, that font looks similar... however, unfortunately, if I want
    my idea to come together I will need the same one.\r\n\r\nI have tried to identify
    it on Myfont and identifont- any suggestions on how else I could identify it???\r\n\r\n"

    pen.

  body: "So I emailed Ken Garland, guy who initiated the manifesto and this is what
    he said:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfushia\r\n\r\nnice to hear from you. I'm glad you
    found the manifesto of some use, even\r\nafter all these years.\r\n\r\nas to your
    query: the headning type was hand-drawn by me; the text type\r\nwas\r\nmade by
    Ludlow Typograph Company of USA (now defunct) and was called\r\nRecod\r\nGothic.\r\n\r\nI
    hope you soon get pissed off with catfood, stripey toothpaste and\r\nshaving\r\ncream:
    no sort of diet for a forward-looking young person (which I assume\r\nyou are).\r\n\r\nken
