body: 'good morning -  <BR> <BR>i am searching for a modern font similar to the eurostyle
  typeface. <BR>i got inspiration from the following site &#40;the header font&#41;:
  <BR> <BR><a href="http://www.danishdesigners.dk/dd_default.asp" target="_blank">http://www.danishdesigners.dk/dd_default.asp</a>
  <BR> <BR>i think its looks nearly like an Eurostyle but a little more modern...

    target="_blank"> FTF Morgan Sans</a>, but that&#39;s  <BR>a Portuguese design,
    while they have plenty of nice Danish  <BR>faces in that particular style.
