    Morpheus</a> has been around for nearly a decade. <BR>It&#39;s well known and
    put to use by lots of amateurs &#40;only&#41; and <BR>I seriously doubt that Emigre
    has ever felt threatened by it.

  body: Well, I personally think this rips off some very specific design  <BR>details
    only found in Mason Serif, so I&#39;m inclined to categorize  <BR>this in the
    dark side of the fabled gray area.

    been made. Bad font &#40;I honestly mean this&#41;. <BR> <BR>That said, it is
    prolifically used, but have you <i>ever</i> seen it used in a <BR>non-amateur
    &#40;read: paying-for-fonts&#41; application. I haven&#39;t. Ergo, my <BR>Emigre
    non-issue stance. Ergo, why make it an issue here? <BR> <BR>By the way, who was
