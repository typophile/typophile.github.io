body: I&#39;m designing an identity and web site for a company who does downhill &#40;cruiser&#41;
  bicycle tours. I&#39;m considering Leviathan Black Italic &#40;maybe all caps&#41;
  for the logotype and looking for some suggestions in regards to a face pair with
  it. Something that is not so extended as the other Proteus project faces. The personality
  should be friendly, fun, exciting, and somewhat informal yet professional. <BR>
  <BR>My initial thought was Base Twelve Sans, but otherwise I&#39;m drawing a blank.
  Ideas?
