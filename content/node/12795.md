    Black</a> slightly stretched.\r\n\r\nThe silly one at the bottom is (unfortunately)
    Comic Sans."

    what they were thinking:\r\n\r\n\"hmm what would work well with Univers...hmmm...Oh!

    </a> might have worked, or even <a href=\"http://www.1001fonts.com/font_details.html?font_id=2426\">this
    free one</a>.\r\n\r\nAnd just in case anyone was wondering (as apparantly I was)
    sausagefont.com and sausagefonts.com are both available! "

  body: I think they were thinking "What typeface is so completely overused (and hideous)
    that there is actually a <a href="http://bancomicsans.com/">web site</a> devoted
    to abolishing it? Yeah, let's go with that one!"
