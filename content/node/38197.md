  Can anyone help? It's not Bell, which was my first thought. There is some variation
  in the letter strokes, it is definitely a serif. The printing is period-accurate,
  so whatever it is was (a) around in the early 1940s, and (b) used by the US military.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/tubebox_5841.jpg]"
