body: "Hi all,\r\n\r\nLooking for some feedback on a concept I drafted for a medical
  supply company that specializes in sales and rentals of electronic IV pumps to hospitals,
  clinics, and doctors. I'm especially looking for feedback on the typefaces \u2014
  suggestions welcome. \r\n\r\nImportant brand bullet-points:\r\n\r\n- Customer service
  is paramount (this is a highly customer-focused organization)\r\n- Offers good value
  but never will offer bargain-basement pricing\r\n- Quick service and delivery\r\n-
  Approachable and dependable\r\n\r\nPlease take into account that this is a fairly
  conservative industry, and the competitors' marketing collateral is pretty abysmal.
  Hope this is enough information for a critique. \r\n\r\nThanks in advance\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/CRI_logo_comps-02_01_02_5681.jpg]\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/CRI_logo_comps-02_01_03_4208.jpg]"

  body: "I see what you're going for. I'm leaning towards the first one. Looks firm,
    grounded, corporate, but with a little personality.\r\n\r\nThe one issue that
    I'm sure you're aware of is the lack of the dot of the i. Obviously, I understand
    what you're doing but it's hurting the communication. It doesn't take much to
    read is at cri, but it's a hair confusing when you slow down and read it. I would
    try and see if you can achieve the same statement in all caps."

    make the whole thing \"straight\" instead of italic\r\n2. Give a little more space
    between the type and the dots\r\n3. Make the type just a little bigger\r\n\r\nweng"

  body: "i actually don't mind the i without the dot, but there is a possibility that
    it becomes confused as 'CR1'\r\n\r\nperhaps an alternative could be to use one
    of the dots from the pattern above the letters as the dot on the i, if you see
    what i mean, will probably mean altering the logo a little\r\n\r\n"

  body: "One thing to beware: it's easy to see \"cri\" and think \"cry,\" at which
    point the drippy dots at the bottom threaten to become tears streaming from two
    eyes.\r\nIf you agree this is a concern, maybe caps would encourage reading it
    as an acronym rather than a word. "

  body: "Thanks everyone for your replies. Very helpful. I've attached a few more
    options based on the feedback received.  Personally, I don't like the look of
    the capital letters as much as the lowercase, but after reading @eliason's comment,
    i feel it necessary to consider caps. \r\n\r\nOption 1: @Lex Kominek's point about
    shifting the dot for the 'i'.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/CRI_logo_comps-typophile_02_02_5603.jpg]\r\n\r\nOption
    2: All caps, same typeface as option 1\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/CRI_logo_comps-typophile_02_01_5902.jpg]\r\n\r\nOption
    3: All caps, Futura Bold Oblique\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/CRI_logo_comps-typophile_02_03_4608.jpg]\r\n\r\nOption
    4: All caps, Meta Bold Italic\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/CRI_logo_comps-typophile_02_04_6096.jpg]\r\n\r\nSuggestions

  body: definitely stick with the slanted version of the logo, but maybe try rotating
    the dots by 45 degrees clockwise, so that the right most blue dot becomes the
    dot on the i

  body: I think the slant suggest speed and 'delivery on time', as you mentioned in
    the first post. It does look a little generic without the slant IMO.

  body: I agree with eliason. All I see is "cry" and to place that in a healthcare
    context is risky. I would strongly encourage you to explore additional avenues
    of [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_rhetoric|visual rhetoric]] instead the
    IV drip (tears) before thinking about typefaces.

  body: Futura seems to work best for me. I'd just fix the kerning. You have too much
    space between the R and I or too little between the C and R.

  body: I wonder if you can't take a step back and use the letterforms to better push
    your concept. The i shape is very similar to an IV tube, while the dot for the
    i could potentially be manipulated into your drip. I agree with Chris, though
    - you have an unfortunate name/image association and it may be difficult to get
    away from "cry" with any sort of drip.
