  working on a typeface family called Exemplar for the past years. Today I am happy
  to tell you that this typeface family is released and available via the website
  of PSY/OPS in San Fransisco.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/exemplarpro_4755.jpg]\r\n\r\nThis
  project has been very dear to me and it feels like giving up a child or something
  now when it\u2019s finally released.\r\n\r\nA lot of things involved in the process
  I have learned by You \u2013 the Typophile people, so would also like to say Thank
  You.\r\n\r\nI\u2019ve prepared a PDF specimen that shows the family and its OpenType
  features together some other information.\r\n\r\nExemplar Pro, english version\r\nhttp://www.autodidakt.se/pdf/ExemplarPro_Specimen.pdf\r\n\r\nExemplar
  Pro, swedish version\r\nhttp://www.autodidakt.se/pdf/ExemplarPro_Stilprov.pdf\r\n\r\nDirect

    part time, 14 years is meant to be a little bit humoristic in fact.\r\n\r\nBut,
    I started out 14 years ago, worked for two years (on and off) and then it was
    put to rest* until 2006 when I picked it up again and completed it. Glad I did,
    since it look and work so much better today :)\r\n\r\n/ G\xF6ran\r\n\r\n*long
