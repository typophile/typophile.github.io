body: I was hoping somebody could point me in the direction of a typeface that has
  a swooping, cursive Capital R. It does not have to be the exact font in the image,
  but something similar would be appreciated.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/building_6345.jpg]

  body: Thanks for the examples. Do you know of any free fonts? I am using this for
    a school project and do not have any funds to work with.

  body: I recommend drawing whatever words you need. I know that's a tall order, but
    use the fonts as a guide if it helps. A free font of this sort will only make
    you look bad.

  body: "Stephen, \r\n\r\nI have actually already tried recreating the font using
    Photoshop and that worked semi-well but however I need a larger font size for
    what I am working on. I would try hand drawing it but frankly I suck at drawing
    and it wouldn't work for me. Can you give me some examples of a free font that
    would be equivalent so I can decide my next course of action?"
