		<div class="commentbody">&gt; When does a &quot;revival&quot; become ethically unsound? <BR> <BR>That's a very interesting question. For example, one of the entries in Bukvaraz was just disqualified because it was based on Stone Sans. I don't know exactly what line the designer took, but to me the result is so different that it's almost a moot point. Nobody would use that font instead of Stone Sans. Sure, the intentions matter too, but don't we have bigger fish to fry? And I wonder, would it have been OK fifty years from now? If I had a dime for every type designer who's benefited from the fact that Jenson is dead&hellip; <BR> <BR>Besides the ethical stance, there's also the &quot;cultural&quot; one: overly literal revivals are good for making money, otherwise they suck. There have only been two fonts I've wanted to revive so far, and one of them I'd never do. The other is actually in the planning stages, but only because it's a totally unique text design that simply doesn't exist in digital form, in any guise. <BR> <BR>&ndash; <BR> <BR>Jen, it would indeed be good to have a list of &quot;open&quot; fonts, with sources. By &quot;open&quot; I mean fonts that you can just download, modify, resell (or at least redistribute), etc. Not that there's a lot of them, certainly not a lot of quality ones.

		<div class="commentbody">hallo jaques, <BR> <BR>i've done a few font modifications for clients of mine and have been wondering about the legal issues as well. so i asked the AGD (Alliance of German Designers). they reccomend, that you ask the creator of the original design if its OK with him/her, before starting on the modification. you and your clients definately need to purchase the proper licenses of the original font. make sure your client has done this before delivering and charging your modifications. i think you can also rename the font you've modified as long as you keep the original copyright infos included in the font's database. if the designer of a font that you want to modify isn't alive anymore, you'll have to go through the trouble of finding out who inherited the rights. in germany, the copyrights of a design remain valid until at least 70 years post mortem. i'm not sure if they can be extended after that. so, as long as the designer or the owner of the copyright says GO, there shouldn't be a legal or ethical problem, unless you or your client redistribute or give away the modified typeface. <BR> <BR>simon</div>

Why? For one thing, the fact that the guy is not dead shouldn't be the determining factor - he himself copied from others, without permission - any design is part of our cultural landscape, and the &quot;original designer&quot; is not entitled to absolute control, just some control (like requiring adherence to the contract).
