  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Hello all. I am a young graphic design student needing some critique on a logo. It's for a small nonprofit that needs a lot of help starting up. I agreed to help out pro bono since I don't feel comfortable charging for work at my current skill level. Right now I'm just trying to learn as much as I can as I work towards my bachelor's.
 

[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Joyful_6301.png]


It's a rough sketch and in need of tweaking but I wanted to see if you all thought I'm at least heading in the right direction. 


Thanks,

Josh</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Joxful? I think you're trying to fit a square peg in a round hole. The "y" doesn't really lend itself to this solution. The type needs a lot of work too. I'd be interested to see what other concepts you're working on.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">yea, I agree with clashmore. Keep going, do some sketches. The typefaces don't work together at all right now. I thought they were two separate things at first glance. And yea, I get it...the Y is a happy little man, but the way it looks now, being all static...it looks like that little man is running from something, not being overly happy and jumping up and down. My best advice is do some research on logos for evangelism ministries that already exist. And no...don't copy, of course, but you might see a good logo that conveys the same overall feeling you are looking to convey. Then study that logo. What fonts did they use, how did they treat their type...did they even us a symbol? Stuff like that.

I also did quite a lot of pro bono work throughout college, it's actually a really great way to get some experience. Portfolio material is a little more important at the moment and adding payment into it always adds a whole different level of stress to the situation if you can't do this stuff in your sleep.</div>

Stretching out the "Ministries" only accentuates the weird sloping "R".</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Thank you all for the comments.


<strong>@clashmore:</strong> Yea, that's what I felt but I thought that maybe there was something I could do to get it to work. I'm going to do some more work on the other concepts this week and upload them when I get a chance.


<strong>@cslem1:</strong> I definitely need to do more research on it. I'll be researching it this week as well as working on more sketches. 

I would like to be able to get some portfolio work, but like I said earlier, I'm trying to get my feet wet right now and as you all can see from the current logo, I'm not at that place yet.


<strong>@Liquid Sky:</strong> Thanks for pointing that out. I can see when a design doesn't work but I'm not at the place where I can tell <em>why</em> it doesn't work. Every comment like that helps.

		<div class="commentbody">Google "church logos" images. Get some icon inspiration. You can turn a capital Y into a one legged person, but I think you'd be better off finding a good set of fonts to work with and to create a church type icon.</div>
