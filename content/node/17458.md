body: Is it possible for a typeface to be designed as a timeless design? If so, what
  are the characteristics of a timeless design? What recent typefaces display these
  features? Pardon me if this has been discussed, I did a search.

    which can be predicted 100% of the time. So you, it is possible to develop a timeless
    typeface. But I doubt one would be able to sit down and say, \"today, I will design
    a timeless typeface,\" and then do it. You see what I mean?\r\n\r\nTimeless really
    comes about because of application, I think. If you are living in 1930, and you
    design a new face for the Times of London, it is a good bet it'll become a timeless
    face, just because the most significant newspaper of the day will use it. What's
    a 2006 equivalent? A face like Verdana that a company like Microsoft will put
    on ever machine so it'll be all over the internet?"

    I think that both Mistral and ITC Avant Garde Gothic are timeless, even though
    that are both dated. The weren't designed to be \"funtional\" per se (although
    they both had lots of alternates, so they were rich in terms of functions), but
    they were both designed with <strong>a purpose</strong> in mind. I doubt that
    in either case, the designer was bored and just drew something. \r\n\r\nStill,
    I agree that a good text (onscreen or off) typeface has a better shot at \"timelessness,\"
    even though the other way is still a possibility."

    be so expensive and time-consuming to produce type that you had to use it quite
    a while to get return on investment.  Today, you can use a face for one job and
    break even. \r\n\r\nChrisL"

  body: But what if you inadvertantly create a new trend (that gets overused) by eschewing
    all of the known trends? :-) I guess all you can do is study history as much as
    possible, as that is the closest you'll come to knowing where future trends may
    go.

  body: "Just because something feels like it is from the 1970s doesn't mean that
    it has to be pigeonholed that way. So much of design from the 90s is just recycled
    elements from the 70s (I'm not necessarily talking type design here).\r\n\r\nA
    dated typeface like Mistral (which betrays its age through its style) has been
    used for decades anyway due to a number of fortunate (for it) circumstances. Its
    continued use is therefore virtually assured. In this sense, I think that it is
    timeless."

  body: "Great link, Stephane.\r\n\r\nThe problem with the Neutral typeface designed
    for conceptual artists, is that by being designed for them, it ceases to be neutral
    in the way that Arial is by virtue of being the most-used default.\r\n\r\nAll
    that can be said about the neutral is that it is the Not, the Neither; as soon
    as it becomes something, it negates its neutrality.\r\n\r\nNeutrality is a quantum
    condition.\r\nAs soon as the observer recognizes or defines neutrality, it collapses.\r\nTherefore,
    neutrality, as related to type, is an ideal, like \"Bodoni\", which exists as
    a collective archetype, or perhaps a social contract.\r\nAs soon as the Neutral
    is specified, it is open to accusations of bias.\r\n\r\nWe can know what neutral
    is, but we can never see it.\r\nWhen you're in neutral, you ain't going nowhere."

  body: "Nick Shinn,\r\n\r\nThanks for this very thought-through remark on the subject
    of my neutral typeface. I was very well aware of the problem that marking or declaring
    \ the typeface as \"neutral\" would, at one level, destroy its neutrality. Just
    like Helvetica is so strongly accredited facelessness, neutrality, timelessness
    and what not, which, in turn, makes it very visible, strong, fashionable to the
    small circle of type nuts (and muttons) that we are. An inherent, but only at
    a rather \"academic level\" harmful problem.\r\n\r\nBut we don't really need to
    go that far, the concept falls short (or rather: is paradox) on a much more basic
    level:\r\n\r\nI think that Neutrality is nothing but an auxiliary construction
    that lets us describe things that fulfill the expectations of the members of a
    specific social and cultural group at a specific point in time; you call this
    very nicely a \"social contract\".\r\nBecause naturally these socio-cultural backgrounds
    of any of the members of a group differ from one another, the size of the group
    (that agrees on something being neutral) decreases as we begin to zoom in on something,
    as we start to discuss details.\r\nIn that, I concluded, neutrality is also a
    paradoxon, because the closer I wanted to approach neutrality, the less universal
    would this neutrality of my typeface be. Through this inherent problem, I knew
    that I would always have to fail the attempt to create a typeface that is completely
    and totally neutral for anyone but the smallest possible group: myself.\r\n\r\nBest,\r\nK\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Kai, I bought the book, and look forward to examining your design process
    in more detail.\r\n\r\nI have occasionally wondered what an approach similar to
    Brian Whitman's -- data mining music-- would produce in the way of a typeface.\r\n\r\nAdrian
    Frutiger has a nice diagram where he averages all his typefaces to come up with
    the \"Ur-Frutiger\" font -- but he left out Ondine, which would have screwed things
    up!"

    please also recommend me to all your friends ;-)\r\n\r\nOf course, the data mining
    provided, even more so as only a dozen or so of key parameters was measured, only
    a rough framework in which to draw. But disregarding all conceptual flaws, as
    discussed above, the typefaces quality lie, to a big part, in what it is <em>not</em>:\r\n\r\nIt
    is not a pure constructed sans, but also not a humanist sans. It is not very contemporary,
    but it doesn't look old, either. Most reactions when I showed it to type designers
    and aficionados in the beginning, were along the lines of \"So what about this
    text you're showing me?\". Which I find a great result.\r\n\r\nI am planning to
    prep the neutral typeface for release in some form or the other by early autumn.
    \r\n\r\nNick, I shall be curious about your remarks!\r\n\r\nKai"
