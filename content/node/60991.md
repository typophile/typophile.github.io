  it is my first time posting.\r\n\r\nI am working on a self-initiated project - a
  logo for Tel Aviv Printmaking Workshop.\r\nCurrently came up with this idea:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/logo_ta_6440.jpg]\r\n\r\nWhat
  do you think? Any help is appreciated,\r\n\r\nThank you."

    just the table, it seemed to me more like a pictogram.\r\nHere are the table variants:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/logo_ta2_6619.jpg]\r\n\r\nThe
    last one is another typophile T ;-)"

    to the T's cross bar? That might make the 't' pop a bit more.\r\n\r\nRight now
    I see a very obvious (and nice) A but the T isn't popping as well."

    the stem of the T more inside?\r\nDoesn't the totally black 'roof' seem too heavy?

    near edge. \r\n\r\nI think the black roof does feel heavy. Perhaps make the paper
    white?"

  body: "Hi,\r\n\r\nMaking the paper white does not work, \r\nunless I change the
    background to non white :-(\r\nI did some variations, 1 - is same as before, \r\n2
    - moving T stem forward, 3 - moving it even more.\r\n\r\nDo any of these look
    reasonable? Thanks!\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/ta5_4353.jpg]\r\n(I
    want to have a logo in BW, then it may be easily\r\nused for embossing it on etching
    paper.)"

  body: "i think someting inbetween the 6 and 7. I like most the 7th but i dont like
    the way i finsish on the right. For that part i like most the 6th. Have you tried
    to make a A less wide, i'd like too see that, i think the A could be ehanced but
    i can't point how...\r\nThe 8th is also very intersting."

  body: "Actually, what if you did put a background color in there? That might help
    the letter/legs pop a bit more and then give you that white sheet. \r\n\r\nOtherwise,
    I agree with lefty in that something like 6 or 7 is on the right track. The table
    top needs to be a tad thicker, IMHO.\r\n\r\nI still think the 'T' can be nudged
    down/towards the viewer a bit. Might be mechanically incorrect but I might help
    optically. "

  body: "Hi, thanks for the comments,\r\nLefty: \r\nI'll play with the A, see if I
    can make it less wide ...\r\nthere is actually something about 7 being sort of
    free shape, that I liked, still I agree it does not sit well. 8 might be interesting,
    cause it can support the T readability, if increasing the left black table stripe
    a bit,... ?\r\nAluminium:\r\nIf I add background - then do I put the logo inside
    circle, square, or do you mean something else? \r\n\r\nI'll try to make variations
    based on comments and will post the updates,\r\nthanks again!\r\n"
