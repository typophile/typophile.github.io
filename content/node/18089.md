    or other's worlds. :)\r\n\r\nMaybe there is some old marquee letters that have
    a lot of character, or aged metal lettering on the front of an old building, or
    it can be cut into stone. It is completely open. But if you wanted to use your
    local grocer's hand-painted sale signs, I think that could make for a very interesting
    project!\r\n\r\nA very good example of this would be the TypeCon 2005 logo designed
    last year (it was on the t-shirts). This was modeled after a <a href=\"http://flickr.com/photos/jlt/28609019/in/set-645286/\">parking
    sign</a> in New York."

    at one friday conference yesterday and i have noticed that arabic letters and

    Sometimes when a political message is communicated arabic is used (bad arabic

  body: "It's interesting to see how everyone is interpreting this stuff. What does
    everyone think about extending this one into next week? I wouldn't mind having
    another go at it, and from what people are telling me, it sounds like a lot of
    people what to jump in, but need some more time. What does everyone think?\r\n\r\nI
    had a harder time with this one than I thought. I had some troubles taking the
    warm living stone letters into cold bezier curves. At first I tried to follow
    the original characters more literally. In particular, I love the wacky variation
    in stem width. When I aped the same variations in splines, though, it just looked
    like a bad free font. What looks like character and warmth in stone, just looked
    tacky when digitized. So I evened out the characters, which I think is working
    out pretty well in its own right, but it has a totally different soul from the
    original.\r\n\r\nI think Mark's entry suffers from the same issue. So much of
    the flavor in that incredible lettering comes in the texture and subtle imperfections.
    I think they get a little lost in the transition to splines. That being said,
    sometimes I get stuck designing for the specimen, and not thinking about how designers
    might use the characters. I think Mark's alphabet could work really well once
    it is placed back into a context by a designer.\r\n\r\nDan, if you don't have
    access to a camera, try flickr. Found type is found type, right? Just cite your
    source."

  body: "Christian, what you're saying about found type is very true. And I agree
    with your assessment of my attempt. I think I could do better if I spent more
    time on it, but it may not be possible to really capture the spirit of the original
    in any case, as you point out.\r\n\r\nWhen you think about it, type--even digital
    type--, as a medium, is severely restricted in terms of visual expression. It's
    just black and white and there are limits on complexity. (This is why I like doing
    lettering--there are fewer restrictions.) Once you have a font, you can go further,
    using color, texture, and context to make something visually rich and unique,
    but a font by itself is limited (not that this is necessarily bad, it just is).\r\n\r\nIn
    any case, it all comes down to interpretation when drawing from any source material--even
    your own sketches. I remember seeing a piece written by Oswald Cooper (reprinted
    in U&lc. I think) about the endless ways the same historical typographic source
    material might be interpreted by a type designer. It will be different for every
    designer, and each designer may have multiple interpretations.\r\n\r\n"

  body: "In the original sign, they made the T and L wide and the M narrow because
    of the vertical orientation. It's constructed like a monospaced font. In adapting
    it, you have the option to use more \"normal\" proportions. \r\n\r\nYou might
    also want to look at some old reverse-stress wood types to get ideas on constructing
    the C and G instead of modularly borrowing bits of the existing letters. \r\n\r\nIt
    looks cool, though, and I don't think there is an existing font that looks similar.
    Kind of a Googie French Clarendon. :-)"

  body: Thanks for the feedback on my motel letters Mark! I started reworking the
    letters, paying more attention to proportions and they are looking better. Maybe
    I'll post them when I have a full alphabet; it all takes time ;)
