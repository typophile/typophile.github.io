  body: "The short story is that the plain text for the article is in Minion, so I
    used the end cap serifs from its uppercase 'C'.\r\nA longer version is in [[http://www.typophile.com/cms/node/48851]].\r\n\r\nI
    don't modify my Minion, I have a separate font for the IPA symbols (touching on
    [[http://typophile.com/node/58688|Font licenses that allow private modifications?]];
    I would consider this a highly related issue). A separate font is a bit of a hassle
    in everyday use, but I'm not too keen on trying to improve on Slimbach.\r\n\r\nIt
    has been suggested I should use open source fonts for just the IPA characters,
    but -- as you rightly remark in your other thread -- these IPA characters appear
    in otherwise regular phrases. Admittedly, an alternative would be to set the entire
    text in the same (open source) font. (Not that I have that option, realistically.)"
