  some letters in it.\r\n\r\nbit concerned about the lowercase wieght, x-height and
  curves- any hints before i move forward?\r\n\r\n\r\ncheers\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/prev_5421.PNG]"

  body: "The lowercase might be a little too light compared to the upper. It's hard
    to say with so few characters.\r\n\r\nThe \"b\" definitely needs some work. The
    right side seems to flatten out a bit (I think it should be more round). The bottom
    right corner looks a little too thick. And the stem on the left is too narrow.
    It also looks like your overshoot below the baseline might be a little much.\r\n\r\nAnd
    I'd probably shorten the lower horizontal bar on the \"F\" a bit\r\n\r\n\r\nKeep
    working on it and post another version once you've got more characters done."

  body: "there are probably not enough characters to judge - you should start with
    /a/, /n/, /o/ and, as you already did, /b/ or /d/. lowercase characters are bette
    suitable to define the character of the typeface...\r\n\r\nyour /b/ is too egg-shaped
    (compare the left part (where the bowl comes out of the stem) to the lower right
    part)\r\n\r\nthe weight of the uppercase characters is unbalanced (/A/ too heavy
    compared to /D/ or /K/; heavy joins of stems at /A/ and /N/) your /O/ is too light
    on its left and right side. the vertical strokes should be thinner than the vertical
    ones, because of its optical weight.\r\n\r\nwhat works really great when designing
    your first typeface is a lot of drawing, erasing and trying again... with pen
    and paper, not on the screen"

  body: "Here are a few more suggestions:\r\n\r\n\u2022 Generally, you'll want your
    vertical strokes to be a little thicker than the horizontals. This applies to
    \ curved characters like the D and O, too.\r\n\r\n\u2022 Diagonal strokes will
    need to be a little thicker so they look the same weight as other strokes. Doing
    this will help the K match the other characters. Try moving the bottom leg of
    the K a little to the right so it extends beyond the top arm.\r\n\r\nyou might
    want to check out Karen Cheng's book \"Designing Type.\" I think it's a really
    good reference for these kind of rules\r\n\r\n\u2022 The crossbar on the H might
    be a bit too high?\r\n\r\n\u2022 The curve on the top of the D doesn't quite go
    with the bottom. You might want to try making the D a bt wider, too.\r\n\r\n\r\n"
