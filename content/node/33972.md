  to this one so I thought I would post it to the forum\r\nWhat is the typeface used
  for movie theater marquee letters, such as these shown <a href=\"http://flickr.com/photos/emily_paup/302756590/\">here</a>?
  \ Looks like <a href=\"http://fontshop.com/fonts/singles/fontfont/ff_din_ot_black/\">FF
  Din</a> is fairly close, but its curves seem to be a little flatter than those in
  the marquee letters; anyone have an exact match?\r\nThanks in advance for any assistance!\r\nsno-man"

    have been created especially for this type of sign, so you probably won't find
    an exact match in a digital font. DIN is very close as you say.\r\n\r\n - Lex"
