  subscribe. I'm a bit confused by the current state of affairs...the Membership page
  mentions an apparently upcoming switch to a subscription system, yet a search yielded
  a 2005 Membership application form.\r\n\r\nWhat's the status of things? How can
  I join? If a new system is coming, is there a general sort of ETA for it? I'm keen
  to get a t-shirt too, but all of the links to depictions seem to be dead, so I can't
  tell what they look like.\r\n\r\nthanks very much,\r\nvv\r\nJ.O."

    as have just paid $44 last week.\r\n\r\nWill let you know what happens :)"

    no T-shirt!).

    and Bert, it looks like you somehow found the old (PayPal) membership link or
    caught us in transition (April). I'll contact you directly to let you know what
    we can do."
