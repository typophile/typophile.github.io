body: "[img:sites/default/files/old-images/goingCrazy_3537.jpg]\r\nI am developing
  a tech brand and one of the primary elements are these blocks (one not shown will
  be the logo), but I'm having a really hard time finding a typeface to compliment
  them. I explored many san sarifs and even threw Didot in just to see... to no avail.
  I am at a loss, frankly.\r\n\r\nI did make some headway by not using heavy weights.
  Throwing in a light Dicot (not sure where this came from... can't find info on origins).
  But I feel like the swell? fillet? (the round corners) aren't doing me any favors."

    Axia, how you swoon me. Thank you for the suggestions. I'll plug it in a see how
    things shake out. I see what you're looking for visually and I'll attempt to find
    similar styles. You're experience is humbling."

    sharing Nick.
