  about Magnetic Ink Character Recognition, and found it enjoyable if a bit dry at
  the end. The impact of the distinct numerals has had on graphic design and type
  over the last 50 years to be fascinating. I thought, \"I bet there is someone else
  on 'phile that would find this neato.\" \r\n\r\n The article includes a bit on the
  source of typeface E-13B's fittingly industrial name, and the forces that called
  for the design of MICR Numbers for checks."

    is interesting that both an electrical engineer and a r&d team contracted by a
    consortium of bankers chose to begin with artistic trial and error when targeting
    machine readability. On the other hand, the UPC would be equally definitive to
    the genre, and has a much more mechanical \"birth\"."
