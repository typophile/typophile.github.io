  body: "Well I am no professional, but I would like to say something. Gradients are
    useful but they can get out of control very fast. I like using very subtle gradients
    to break up a flat color. Dropshodows are useful only in motion-based work, no-where
    else.\r\n\r\nI understand that you DON'T want a great contrast between the background
    and text, but there are so many more \"professional\" ways to approach that than
    this.\r\n\r\nHope that helps."

  body: "\"Drop shadows are useful in motion work, nowhere else\" Well, as much as
    I hate overly shadowed and \"dimensionalized\" (is that a word?) design, drop
    shadows are useful anytime you need to create seperation between elements. In
    motion, print, or anywhere else. Just don't overdo it.\r\n\r\nTo me, your top
    sample is almost illegible."

    it was too harsh for the feeling I wanted, but I was able to eliminate the dropshadow

  body: "\"drop shadows are useful anytime you need to create seperation between elements.\"\r\n\r\nI
    am gonna disagree on you there Chris. And the word \"elements\" is very vague.
    There are so many other ways to create seperation other than drop shadows. The
    idea of drop shadows is to create depth anyway, which is sometimes useful in highly-dynamic
    motion graphics.... keyword being \"motion.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nPS: Great edit there
    fontplayer. Compositionally, the justified left creates a line which isn't really
    lined up with anything so it feels like its floating. I would tone the gradients
    down even more. Your quotation should hang on the outside. Now about the typeface...\r\n\r\n"

    If you mean the lighting in the photo, I thought that is what made the image cool.

  body: Well Prakash, you said they're useful in motion work and nowhere else. That's
    a pretty narrow point of view. I can definitely agree that drop shadows are overused.
    Photoshop filters can be used for evil or good :) But if used subtely, they can
    create seperation between type and a background. I've done drop shadows where
    you couldn't even tell they were there, but when they were removed it was obvious
    that they helped. If you don't need 'em don't use 'em. That's my 2 cents...

    investigating (in my opinion) all the same, you can also look at slightly rotating
    or stretching the background to avoid that. Have fun experimenting, reject any
    that you feel don't work keep the others (as a file or just at the back of your
    mind) to use in other circumstances that might suit. Part of the skill of designing
    is to know when to reject an idea.\r\nFor example that shadows only effect on
    white can produce a blind embossed look where budgets or circumstances don't permit.\r\nTim"
