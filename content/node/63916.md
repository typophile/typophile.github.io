body: "I just used FontNuke for the first time to see I could remedy a problem with
  a PS font in Adobe CS4 applications. I just did a general overall cache clean. It
  didn't solve the problem, but seemed to have caused a corruption with FontLab.\r\n\r\nWhen
  I open the OT window for features all the text in the feature code area is invisible.
  It seems as though it is still there, but unselectable. So if I type in a new feature
  like liga, it's invisible in the main panel, but shows liga on the left. This is
  version 5.0.2 \u2026BTW. Is there some easy solution to this or do I need to get
  the software guys here at work to reinstall?"

    editors in FontLab? (Preferences > General Options > Fonts) Maybe you could try
    to change it to a different font.

    portion of the Preview Panel simply stopped working: no checkbox list of features,
    so no way to test them internally. No FontNuke involved...go figure.'

  body: "Thanks Mark. I think you solved that problem and revealed another. The font
    FL used was Courier New. When I looked it up via Fontbook on my system the Courier
    New was Arabic! I have the feeling there must be a regular version floating around
    here somewhere.\r\n\r\nStephen"

  body: Assuming you have it, you might try running an MS Office app. If I remember
    correctly, Courier New is one of the fonts that gets reinstalled automatically
    by Office if it's missing.

    or reinstalling. Also, I recommend updating to 5.0.4. \r\n\r\nCheers,\r\nAdam"
