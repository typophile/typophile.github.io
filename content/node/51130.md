body: "I've been playing around with fontlab/openType for a school assignment but
  I'm not really getting it.\r\n\r\nI'm really interested in scripting a font. A teacher
  told me you don't have a lot of options nowadays since postscript type 3 isn't supported
  anymore? But you should still be able to do some nice things with openType I think.\r\n\r\nWhat
  I am after is the following;\r\nI'm making a font that lets all the characters respond
  to each other. Basically I want to check what the first character of a word is,
  and  let the other characters choose the appropriate glyph based on that.\r\n\r\nSo,
  when I write 'nosebleed' (wow, random) I want the o,s,e,b,l,d to choose their glyphs
  belonging to the n, some something like o.n, s.n, e.n etc.\r\n\r\nFor the combination
  CA you could do something like this:\r\n\r\nfeature replace{\r\n     sub C A by
  C.A;  (where C.A is a glyph containing both a C and an special version of the A)\r\n}
  replace;\r\n\r\nBut of course, this won't let you change the whole word.\r\n\r\nThis;\r\nignore
  substitute @LETTER f' i'; \r\nsubstitute f' i' by f_i.init; \r\n\r\nLets you change
  glyphs to make a ligature at the beginning of a word. But can you reverse this?
  Like; only replace the glyph if it's NOT at the beginning of the word, and replace
  it by it's version belonging to the FIRST character of the word.\r\n\r\nIn other
  scripting languages I would do something like this:\r\n\r\nSee if the typed character
  is the first character of the word being typed.\r\nIf it is, use the standard glyph.
  If not, see what the first character was and make the typed character the glyph
  'typedCharacter.firstCharacter'; \r\n\r\nDoes anyone know if there is a way to do
  this? Or something like this? Or something to get me started?"

  body: "A more conventional approach would be a calt feature, something along these
    lines:\r\n\r\nsub [A A.A B.A C.A D.A E.A] [A B C D E]' by [A.A B.A C.A D.A E.A];\r\nsub
    [B A.B B.B C.B D.B E.B] [A B C D E]' by [A.B B.B C.B D.B E.B];\r\n\r\n[A B C D
    E]' will be replaced, the class before is is what serves as context. This means,
    in the first line, any glyph following an A will be replaced by an .A alternate,
    and any subsequent glyph (i.e. following an .A alternate) will be replace by an
    .A alternate too. The first glyph of a word will not be replaced -- the above
    context definition requires that at least one glyph precedes the glyph to be replaced.\r\nJust
    wondering, how many alternates do you want to draw?&nbsp;&nbsp;;-)"

  body: "Well, I have to make a typeface with the full 256 characters, so that means
    something like 265 * 265 = 70.255 glyphs\r\n\r\nBut I'm not even sure if that
    amount is supported.\r\nI won't make them all myself. I'm pretty handy with scripting,
    so I'll just write some script which will generate the glyphs in PDF / illustrator
    format (and then I'll have to find a way of easily importing them in fontlab,
    instead of copy pasting them).\r\nBut I think I will start with about 5 * 5 =
    25 glyps so see if it works :p\r\n\r\nThanks for the reply btw"

    it's just glyph alternates. I used as suffix the first-glyph-of-word to which
    the alternate relates, so \"B.A\" is an alternate B which is used in words starting
    with A.\r\n\r\n"

    is the maximum number of glyphs in a font that can be created with FontLab Studio
    5. You should be glad to hear that this limit will be lifted in FontLab Studio
    6 (which we are working on) so the maximum number of 65,535 glyphs per font will
    be possible. \r\n\r\nAdam"
