  body: I&#39;ll double check, but at first glance it looks like Helvetica Black &#40;or
    Bold?&#41; Condensed.

    <BR> <BR>Tough to whether the difference in the roundness of the top of the S
    is due to the angle of the photo, the reproduction quality of the lettering on
    the sign, or whether it&#39;s one of a dozen other bold condensed gothics.'

  body: 'You may be right, Karen. Here&#39;s a quickie attempt to simulate the sign
    with Folio Bold Condensed.  <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/39387.jpg"
    alt="esplanade"> <BR> <BR>I think the perspective and a little &#34;squooshing&#34;
    might account for the differences in weight, but the S and R are little rounder
    in your sample. And the middle stroke of the N is too light in Folio. <BR> <BR>The
    S looks like it was borrowed from Franklin Gothic, Knockout or some other 19th-Century
    sans. '

  body: Hey, this is really close. The only differences I can spot are the diagonal
    on the N and the eye of the P. And it could be the angle of the photo too. Thanks
