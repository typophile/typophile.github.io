  for just one collection &#40;if possible&#41; that includes a big variety of fontstyles
  and &#40;like always&#41; he doesn&#39;t want to pay too much. anyway he needs something
  like 200 different fonts. any suggestions? thanks: lars'

  body: If he has a school connection, Adobe Type Classics for Learning is a great
    bargain. Bitstream and Linotype also have large collections. Some of Bitstream&#39;s
    are relatively inexpensive, like the Adobe Type Classics.

  body: unfortunately he has no school connection. but 99$ is really a bargain for
    such an open type collection. anyway, the collection does not has to be such a
    &#34;high quality&#34; one, also a collection of shareware fonts might come in
    place. it only has to include a big variety and a good licensing program &#40;like
    allowing to display the fonts as graphics online and so&#41;.thanks

  body: Hmmm. Check out also the <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/products/bitstream/cambridge/"
    target="_blank">Cambridge Collection</a>. It sounds like from the numbers of fonts
    and price, this may fit the ticket.
