body: "I'm trying to create an SVG-in-OpenType font by adding an 'SVG '-table to an
  existing font, but the SVG glyph will not render in the final font.\r\n\r\nThis
  is my process:\r\n\r\n1. I take an existing font and decompile it with ttx (Behdad's
  version)\r\n\r\n2. I add an SVG table with a single svgDoc entry holding an SVG
  image.\r\n\r\n3. I recompile the ttx (without errors) and test the font in Firefox
  (which supports SVG-in-OpenType).\r\n\r\nAlthough ttx doesn't throw any errors,
  the SVG glyph doesn't show up \u2014 the original glyph is being shown.\r\n\r\nMy
  addition to the font looks like this:\r\n\r\n<code>&lt;svg>\r\n&lt;svgDoc endGlyphID=\"4\"
  startGlyphID=\"4\">\r\n    &lt;![CDATA[\r\n    &lt;!-- svg data -->\r\n    ]]>\r\n&lt;/svgDoc>\r\n&lt;colorPalettes></colorPalettes>\r\n&lt;/svg></code>\r\n\r\nI've
  tried the following:\r\n\r\n* Using different TTF fonts to transplant my SVGs into\r\n*
  Using all kinds of different SVGs, including one I took from an existing ttx'ed
  SVG-in-OpenType font\r\n* Matching other tables to those of existing SVG-in-OpenType
  (e.g. adding a cmap_format_6 table)\r\n* Decompiling the generated font to see if
  nothing was being dropped by ttx\r\n\r\nI don't know why this doesn't work. It looks
  so simple, and according to various sources* adding the SVG table should be all
  there's to it. Inspecting proper SVG-in-OpenType fonts seems to confirm this.\r\n\r\nAnybody
  have an idea what I'm doing wrong?\r\n\r\n* https://hacks.mozilla.org/2014/10/svg-colors-in-opentype-fonts/

    verbatim; something needs to be added to it. The glyph ID, as used in the GlyphOrder
    table ttx generates, needs to be added to the SVG. For example\r\n\r\n&lt;GlyphID
    id=\"4\" name=\"exclam\"/>\r\n\r\nwould need\r\n\r\n&lt;svg id=\"glyph4\" ...
    >\r\n\r\nAnd I didn't notice the IDs didn't match. Duh."
