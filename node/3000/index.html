I've decided to get a bit more serious about my freelance web design work, so I've decided dump the name and logo I was playing around with before.  I'm looking for a distictive typeface to help develop an identity. <BR> <BR>I'm not planning on everything being married to the mark; I don't need a logo so much as a good typeface and consistent colors.  Nevertheless, any critiques on positioning, size, etc. would be helpful. <BR> <BR>So far, I've tried (in order) Morphica from Shinn Type, Luna Modern from PsyOps, and Reykjavik 2, D Weight from PsyOps.  Tell me if they work, and feel free to recommend <i>any</i> other typefaces. <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/25730.gif" alt=""><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/25731.gif" alt=""><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/25732.gif" alt=""></div>

Maybe use Morphica as your inspiration for the mark, rather than trying to find a font that works well with your mark. As you can see by the postings, thus far, Morphica seems to be a pretty good type selection, but there is a lot of concern about the mark. <BR> <BR>Aloha! <BR>Scott</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I like it even better with the descriptive byline. At small scale the descriptor is likely to disappear in places, but for once I think that works really well. Morphica goes even better with the graphic element at this smaller scale because of its detail increases in complexity. The descriptor, combined with the bolder and simpler (at large scale) title, &quot;chromatic&quot; looks more like the graphic. The interior shapes of the graphic look a little more simple than the vibrant shapes that seem to be flaring out. In fact, I wonder what it would look like if the interior shapes and chromatic were the same color, while the outer, flaring shapes and the descriptor were similar varying colors</div>

The mark has a Leroy-Neiman-meets-'80s-bezier look*, and it looks really uncomfortable next to the postmodern Morphica.  <BR> <BR>If you're bent on using Morphica, pair it with a simple mark that uses color to play off of the company name. Use shapes, sizes or proportions that are sympathetic to the type. Or, as you mentioned, lose the mark altogether. <BR> <BR>(*Where some see exploding violins, I see salad tongs.)</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Sorry, Daniel, those references *are* pretty obscure. Let me try to explain. Leroy Neiman is an artist who came to prominence in the '70s, and who, in my opinion, uses color in a garish way. Here's a link to some of his work: <BR> <BR><a href="http://www.leroyneiman.com/merchant.ihtml?pid=347&amp;lastcatid=20&amp;step=4" target="_blank"><a href="http://www.leroyneiman.com/merchant.ihtml?pid=347&amp;amp;lastcatid=20&amp;amp;step=4">http://www.leroyneiman.com/merchant.ihtml?pid=347&amp;amp;lastcatid=20&amp;amp;step=4</a></a> <BR> <BR>Your mark reminds me of what would happen if his style of painting was combined with the hard-edged style I associate with the '80s, when digital illustration via Illustrator/Freehand became popular. <BR> <BR>So when I look at your logo, I see visual nods to two decades, sitting next to type that's got a '90s deconstructionist feel. It just doesn't hang together for me. <BR> <BR>Chromatica is a really cool name. I guess that's why I think you should explore more options.</div>

I stumbled across something I liked and ran with it.  I still like it, but I think you're right in suggesting I kick it around a little longer.  Here's an updated version in which the shapes are smoother and a little better paired with Morphica.  I know your problem is more with the concept, but let me know if this helps at all: <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/26389.gif" alt=""> <BR> <BR>Also, I notice you said &quot;Chromatica&quot;.  Was this a suggestion, or a typo?  If the former, I've certainly considered that variant and haven't ruled it out yet.</div>

But now I'll say it - and I hate myself for seeing it, and I'm sure Freud would have something to say - but&hellip;.I'm being really honest. <BR> <BR>to me it looks like a bunch of penis's, penis's in a circle umm? splitting penis's? I donno - if the mark was smaller - maybe just a TM size'd mark or accent above the c and if it was a full flower? I do like the fall colours but I'm not sure what that has to do with chrome.  <BR> <BR>I do like the idea though - of incorporating alot of colours with a name like chromatic - it reminds me of  &quot;Technicolor&quot; except not. same with the typeface - I really like the type chosen here its old and new</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Okay, I'm pulling a Frankenstein and resurrecting this.  I still really like the illustrative quality, but it just isn't looking good to me at small sizes.   I've been thinking about how I can make the type-only treatment distinctive, since the Morphica is strong by itself.  I really kind of want to get away from the idea of a twee little image that is contractually obligated to appear with every use of the name. <BR> <BR>I was inspired by kris' recent Klim business cards to try a more illustrative approach.  The type is the only &quot;logo&quot;</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Yeah. I think this is a much better approach. Especially <BR>if the illustration varied from application to application. <BR>The &quot;graphic Design studio&quot; could match the colours <BR>of every illustration. Looks like &quot;autumn&quot;, very appriopriate <BR>for me, cos it is autumn here! Funny if you made a seasonal <BR>card! It might have cohesiveness like the CS branding, which <BR>I happen to think is rather successful. Good work bro. <BR> <BR>-kris.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">1 - your mark is fine, from the beginning. It does not look heavy metal to me, in fact that just confuses me.  <BR> <BR>If all logos were not busy, were would the busy people live? <BR> <BR>2 - I like the very first font you posted. Morphica lower case. Suits it perfectly. <BR> <BR>3 - The first thing I saw in the mark was a noisy flower. Energetic and fast. Swift! <BR> <BR>4 - That last business card, based on KLIM's inspiration, is the choice for me, yes precious. <BR> <BR>5 - I would be attracted to your studio with this design. The choice of colour is young and vibrant. Contemporary.  <BR> <BR>Great stuff! <BR></div>

		<div class="commentbody">hey daniel,  <BR> <BR> i read a book about signs and symbols by adrian frutiger and he stated that &quot;pure abstratction can lead to unwanted similarities in logotypes.&quot;  <BR> <BR>It seems like the people on this thread dislike it because they cant figure out what it is. I think you should go with the season idea. looking forward to seeing your progress. keep up the great work.</div>
