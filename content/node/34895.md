  body: There are lots of 'G's with this spur, including <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/singles/itc/itc_galliard_bold/&sample_text=The%20Great%20Method&sample_size=45">ITC
    Galliard</a> and <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/singles/linotype/trump_mediaeval_lt_std_bold_ot/&sample_text=The%20Great%20Method&sample_size=43">Trump

    from Arte Subtilissima by Juan de Yciar,\r\neven if it was designed by any swiss
    designers.\r\n\r\nBut I may be wrong."

  body: "The book was really designed by a couple of emigrant Dutch designers with
    a Basque editor from a Swiss publisher (the legend continues...). There is just
    something strange going on with the a \u2014 while the d, c, e and and s feel
    continuous. I'm pretty curious about this one, so I've hunted down one of the
    designers and sent him an email. We shall see!\r\n\r\nHorton\r\nFounder, <a href=\"http://www.thisdayintype.com\"
