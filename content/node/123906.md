  some additional characters. I noticed in the preview in FontExporer X some characters
  were filled. Anyone know what causes this?[img:sites/default/files/old-images/bad-glyphs_4909.jpg]

  body: Thank you agisaak, you got me looking in the right place. Turns out there
    were to copies of the glyph on top of each other. I was a bit sloppy with my copy
    pasting. Cheers.
