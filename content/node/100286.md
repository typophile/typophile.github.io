body: "I'm in the process of editing and reformatting some old undergraduate papers
  of mine (for possible use as \"academic writing samples\" for some of my upcoming
  grad school applications).\r\n\r\nThis particular one is a history paper on the
  Habsburg dynasty.  I've chosen to set it in 11pt Baskerville, which works fairly
  well.  However, there are a couple of places where I use indented quotations from
  a primary source (a publication of laws by Charles V).  I'd like to use a slightly
  different font for these, but I'm having trouble finding something appropriate.\r\n\r\nI
  want something that not only combines well with Baskerville, but doesn't immediately
  scream \"different font here\".  However, if possible, I'd also like something that
  can evoke the sixteenth-century European origin of the text.  (The original folio
  was printed in London in 1532, in English; I assume it was translated from either
  German or Latin.  It appears to use something similar to Caxton's Flemish blackletter
  types; <a href=\"http://www.altsan.org/creative/actes_xxvi.png\">here's a sample
  from the microfilm version I used</a>.)\r\n\r\nAt the moment I'm using Janson Text,
  but I'm wondering if something slightly more archaic would be better.  Are there
  any good fonts out there that could evoke a very subtly Teutonic feel without clashing
  with Baskerville?  (Preferably one that's either included in Windows or Office,
  or at least is not expensive; this is not paid work so I don't have a budget to
  speak of.)\r\n\r\nHere's a sample of what I have at the moment: http://www.altsan.org/creative/Habsburg_excerpt.pdf\r\n\r\n"

  body: Most laypeople--even grad-school admissions officers--can't tell Bodoni from
    baloney. A best-case scenario is that they won't even notice you used a different
    font for the extract quotes. A worst-case scenario is that they will notice, and
    think it's a mistake. My suggestion would be either to use Baskerville throughout,
    or use something obviously different for the extract quotes, maybe a humanist
    sans serif like Agenda Light.

    \ <a href=\"http://www.altsan.org/creative/habsburg_quote.png\">I quite like the
    effect</a>: it has a humanist, vaguely hand-written feel to it which nonetheless
    doesn't seem to clash overmuch with the surrounding Baskerville.  \r\n\r\nI'll
    experiment a bit more, but I think it's promising..."

  body: "Incidentally, as an undergrad I seem to have had some truly appalling judgement
    when it came to fonts.  I found at least two essays where I'd set the entire text
    in Souvenir.  Printed on a 24-pin dot matrix!  \r\n\r\nAnd that wasn't even the
    worst of it.  I can only plead feckless youth and stupidity. :)"

    If I noticed such a setting, I would assume that somebody made a mistake. Mojo\u2019s

    Have a look at <a href=\"http://www.stormtype.com/family-john-sans.html\">John
    Sans</a> for something that blends in well with Baskerville.\r\n\r\nPS: Check

  body: 'Alex, as others already pointed out, I wouldn''t set indented quotations
    in a different font: I think you should mantain the overall texture of the page
    homogenueus. Instead, you could try a smaller size and leading (eg. main text
    in 11 pts, quotations in 9,5): that is the standard way in essays literature.
    Which Baskerville are you using, by the way? It looks like some version of Berthold
    or Luin''s "Classico". And may I suggest you to check the apostrophes? The ones
    you''re using don''t seem right.'

  body: "@R. It's the slight handwritten feel that I'm after, which I hope outweighs
    any dissonance from combining two such different styles.  Regarding a humanist
    sans, that rather seems like going in the opposite direction.  Actually, I did
    consider URW A028 (very similar to Albertus), but I found it was too dark for
    this purpose.\r\n\r\n@ncaleffi I've wondered if using a different font is appropriate.
    \ I just feel that a highly regular transitional like Baskerville doesn't really
    'work' with the archaic language of the quoted text.  (Incidentally, it's URW
    Baskerville that I'm using.)"

    that for the quotations might work - IMO it has a slightly more organic feel than
    a true Baskerville...\r\n\r\nBTW I mentioned that Souvenir wasn't the worst of
    the lot... I found another old essay which I apparently set in <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/search/korinna/fonts/\">Korinna</a>..."

  body: I don't think an admissions committee will put your application in the reject
    pile due to use of weird fonts, but I think if the Baskerville doesn't get along
    with the text you are quoting, you should consider changing the whole document
    rather than using a completely different font for the extracts. FWIW, for an essay
    that covers all of Habsburg history from Middle Ages to 1918, I'd probably use
    something that looks academic but otherwise kind of "neutral", like Sabon or Minion.

    suppose the admissions people would care if it was in double-spaced Times (as
    the original version was).\r\n\r\nAs for Baskerville, I chose it because I recently
    bought it and am keen to try it out in academic writing.  I think it works very
    well for the overall text... I think the Fry version actually might do for the
    quotations.\r\n"
