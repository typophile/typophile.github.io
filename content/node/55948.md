  the bottom end to a poster I'm designing for our SGA. I want to get your feedback
  on the Copy Set. Satisfactory? Lacking? Terrible? Readability is going to be an
  issue because the picture takes precedence so any suggestions on alternative arrangements?\r\n\r\nSo
  you don't have to look it up: The Font is Century Schoolbook. I'm going through
  a Slab Serif phase...\r\n\r\nThanks!!\r\n\r\n-JD"

  body: "In my opinion the B in Ben is really fighting with the copy above it, perhaps
    try it as a drop cap?\r\n\r\nAlso, I would really try and get Richard Nixon back
    up to that first line, the way that first line ends at the moment just doesn't
    feel comfortable to me.\r\n\r\nAnd maybe try something different with the event
    details. Perhaps set the details over two lines, slightly larger and the same
    size as the date?\r\n\r\nGood work overall."

    B is inexcusable though. I might drop it from the side. "

  body: "Maybe it's because I don't see the upper part, but I fail to see an inherent
    logic in the placement of the date (except perhaps that the column starts where
    the other ends). Because it seems a bit crowded, you could try to flush it with
    the right margin? In general, I think it lacks some breathing space as well as
    contrast. Both could be achieved with more generous spacing between the details
    and the body (if possible) or a different face.\r\n\r\nUse proper quotes in the
    text. Use a dash for ranges, not a hyphen.\r\nWhat's with the slanted exclamation
    marks?\r\n\r\nI agree with the comment regarding the drop capital and the first
    linebreak."

  body: "What is the input on a Mac for proper quotes?\r\n\r\nAlso; I realize you
    are quoting larger typographic standards but I have consistently questioned the
    \"proper\" use of a dash concerning dates. For myself, I have always found that
    it consumed too much space on the page.\r\n\r\nRegardless, thank you for the suggestions!
    I'll work on it. I'll also post the full poster shortly."

  body: "I'd lose all of the superscript: 53rd, 1st and 7.00\u20138.30 PM (with PM
    in small caps after a space and an en dash instead of a hyphen).\r\n\r\n53 doesn't
    need to be in italic. Instead I would put the title What Matters Most in italic
    and lose the double quotes.\r\n\r\nAre these proper small caps or fake ones? I
    can't tell with the resolution of the image. If they're fake I would use a mixture
    of upper- and lower-case or all-caps in the title instead.\r\n\r\nFormer Presidents
    doesn't need initial caps. \"Late\" is also probably superfluous.\r\n\r\nWhy NYTimes?
    Do you mean The New York Times or are you only referring to the New York Times
    website. This could be more specific.\r\n\r\nModern-day renaissance man can lose
    the small-caps and the exclamation marks. I would lose the renaissance man completely
    anyway: it suggests that he has a wide range of talents in diverse fields whereas
    this person seems to be very successful in one field.\r\n\r\nGood luck.\r\n\r\nEd"
