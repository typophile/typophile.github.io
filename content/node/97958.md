  across this typeface and was trying to track it down. \r\nBeen through all the usual
  avenues but can't seem to find this one. Quite playful and bold script style font*\r\nWould
  love to figure out what this typeface is & know that this is the place for that.\r\nHope
  this comes in handy fro some of you out there too :)    "
