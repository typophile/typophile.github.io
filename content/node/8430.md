  problems? Example: 40_thieves-Regular <BR> <BR>I&#39;m working on a font with a
  name like this and am having trouble generating TT and PS fonts but opentype generates
  fine.'

    and European digits:  <BR>A-Z a-z 0-9 <BR>Also, spaces where appropriate.  <BR>
    <BR>Do NOT use any accented characters &#40;Western or others&#41; or any punctuation
    &#40;ampersands, underscores, slashes, hyphens&#41;. You should only use one hyphen
    in the PS Font Name to separate the family name from the style name.  <BR> <BR>Adam'
