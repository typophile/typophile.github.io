  already posted this on WTF Forums and found out that it is Folio with a custom a.
  I was just wondering if there were any fonts like this, ie in the same vein as Helvetica
  except for the a which would be in the style of Futura. (Not sure if there is a
  name for the two types). Thanks."

  body: Take a look at [[http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/singles/ourtype/remo_extra_bold_pro/opentype_cff/|Remo
    Extra Bold Pro]] from OurType. Though quite different to Folio, I think it is
    not too different in general feel from the Black Diamond logo and has a really
    nice warm, soft humanist style of its own.
