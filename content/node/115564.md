  the font 'Helena'  and was wondering if the typophiles out there could suggest something
  similar?\r\n\r\nI purchased 'Aesthetique' but that was a little to decorative.\r\n\r\nAny
  Suggestions welcome\r\n\r\nPosted an image of Helena with some text thrown in....\r\n\r\n\r\ng:

  body: "I am not certain what you mean by \"packaging with a devilish slant.\" This
    could range from a cute Valentines' day devil to a heavy metal like Graveblade
    http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/typodermic/graveblade/ -- which is definitely an
    attention grabber and not too \"decorative\" in the swirly sense of Helena. Another
    option is a script like Excalibur http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/scholtz/excalibur-scf/
    -- pointy in a casual way.\r\nIf you don't mind making letters, you could apply
    a motif like this  http://www.shutterstock.com/pic-56239237/stock-vector-devil-icon.html?src=vVNCXtoJFAkQruigYqN8Dw-1-9
    \ to the initial letter of your logo from an uncomplicated \"friendly\" font of
    your choice and leave the rest unchanged. \r\nDon"
