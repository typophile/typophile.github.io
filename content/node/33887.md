  body: "After trying to match this to every font categorized as 'wide'at MyFonts,
    I think I will stick with my previous answer. The only thing significant (to my
    eye) that distinguishes this sample from Zeppelin 41 Bold is the extra serifs
    on some of the letters of the sample.\r\n\r\n - Mike Yanega"

  body: "Georg, that typeface has similarities, but it does not match the sample in
    many details. Nice to hear from you again, as always. Most likely the original
    of the sample was done digitally, I would suppose.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
