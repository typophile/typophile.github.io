  in this commercial that is kinda similar to the emtype logo which was made by Eduardo
  Manso himself and is not a typeface and which is again kinda similar to the Bello
  Pro by Underware, but definitely different) =)\r\n\r\nI'd like to know the name
  of that typeface and where to get it. Nobody at C\xF4te D'Or could tell me. =)\r\n\r\nThank
  you very much!!\r\n\r\nregards,\r\ndav."
