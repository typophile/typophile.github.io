  program.\r\nAm I right in thinking it allows photographs to be used in the same
  way as a vector font?\r\nCan the photos be of a very high resolution?\r\nOnce the
  font is made, is it something that can be used generally in all programs (Word,
  Quark, Photoshop, etc), i.e. could it be sold?\r\nI am planning to photograph carved
  letters, lift the actual carved letters out of their background and then make a
  font from these letters. It can then be typed out onto a series of different backgrounds.
  Is this feasible? Or shall I just go back to my workshop and chew some straw.\r\nAny
  advice greatly appreciated.\r\nMB"

  body: "MB, \r\n\r\nPhotofont is more of a \"platform\" than \"program\", developed
    by Fontlab Ltd. There is the photofont format, which can be fonts that consist
    of arbitrarily high resolution, and that support alpha transparency so you can
    make them work over arbitrary backgrounds. \r\n\r\nThen, there currently is Photofont
    Start (for Photoshop and Illustrator) as well as Photofont WebReady (for web pages),
    in which you can use the photofonts you made. Within the next few weeks, we will
    release Photofont ID (for InDesign) and Photofont QX (for QuarkXPress). We have
    no current plans to support Microsoft Word, though. \r\n\r\nFinally, there is
    BitFonter, in which you can create your photofonts, by either drawing directly
    or converting existing photographs into photofonts. \r\n\r\nYou can find more
    information at: \r\nhttp://www.photofont.com/\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\nAdam Twardoch\r\nFontlab

    a million guys.\r\n\r\nWould anyone with the necessary computer wizardry and experience
    in font design wish to collaborate in making a carved letter font? (possible name
    \"Say It In Stone\")\r\nImagine - images of authentic looking inscriptions in
    any stone or material without employing a carver. Not the be-all-and-end-all,
    but could fill a niche, and would be fun. \r\nI have some ideas and preliminary
    work done, and can do the lettering, but am going to need expertise with the computer/graphic
    side of things.\r\nSome of my work at\r\nhttp://flickr.com/photos/m-brooks/\r\n\r\nMark\r\n"

    actually afford Bitfonter right now. If you\u2019re interested drop an email to
    james dot puckett at gmail. \r\n\r\nAnd I don\u2019t mean to derail the thread
    but I think that if Fontlab really wants Photofonts to take off there needs to
    be a way to create them without spending another $500 on software. Us hip young
    designers who like playing with new technology are all broke and will be for the
    foreseeable future. For a letterer and a font designer to collaborate on one Photofont
    requires a $1,000 investment in software, and I\u2019m not sure how quickly one
    can expect to recoup that selling bitmap fonts that require users to install a
    plugin. "

  body: "James, \r\n\r\nI can relate to your concerns. We have plans to at some point
    make a more affordable Photofont-creation application, but nothing in the immediate
    future. As you may understand, we are a small company and developing software
    is a costly matter, and I'm sure you'll agree that just as type designers deserve
    to be rewarded for their design effort, so are software developers who help them
    achieving that goal. \r\n\r\nAlso please note that early adopters of a technology
    may sometimes pay a higher price but they will also have a competitive advantage
    over others. \r\n\r\nI'm glad that you referred to buying software as \"investing\"
    rather than \"spending\". Indeed, I see it the same way. BitFonter is US$499.
    If you price your photofonts at $25 a copy, you only need to sell 20 copies to
    cover the software investment costs. I don't think this is an unreasonably high
    risk. \r\n\r\nBest,\r\nAdam\r\n"

    I\u2019m just not sure that I could sell 20 of a copies photofont right now. There\u2019s
    an extra marketing challenge here: most end-users don\u2019t know what a photofont
    is. But maybe if I do well with my other fonts I\u2019ll go ahead and give a photofont
    a spin."

  body: "\"Digitally cultured stone, one letter for always, and the same carver seem
    like blandness waiting to happen.\"\r\nOne letter for always - isn't that type
    design for you?\r\nWe might as well all give up and just use Times Roman for all
    lettering everywhere.\r\nThis not intended to replace Lettercarving, it will be
    an addition to the huge range of expressive options available. It may even inspire
    the commissioning of a piece of original carving.\r\nStone veining, I hope, will
    happen by having some translucency to the letters which will allow the markings
    of the background show through, but only slightly. This will look similar to what
    happens when actually carving. The polishing or honing of a surface brings out
    the natural veining of a piece of stone. The veining reduces down in the areas
    that are carved.\r\nOpentype - definitely. Ligatures aplenty.\r\nOther handiwork
    - Beautifully drawn and carved letters for a start.\r\nAny other ideas welcome.\r\n\r\nMark
