  is the kerned & animated version of the title piece. Top&#8212;Pharmacy, below&#8212;Roselyn
  script. I'll get Ray to update the static online version at Typodermic with this
  animated one.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/postscript_anim2_4536.gif]\r\n\r\nPharmacy
  was an early unicase type, an adaptation of a pharmacy sign Harold found <em>\"at
  a local (Albany, NY) drugstore. Waiting at the red light, I'd often stared at the
  sign, admiring its jolly and curious mix of upper and lowercase, and of course the
  peculiar asymmetrical capital A.\"</em>\r\n\r\nPharmacy goes rather nicely with
  Roselyn : ^ )\r\n\r\nWith much gratitude and thanks to Harold, who turned 50 yesterday.
  Thanks to Ray Larabie for hosting.\r\n\r\nj a m e s"
