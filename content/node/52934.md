body: "Hi,\r\n\r\nmy client is a Franco-German auditing firm consisting of three people.
  The company is based in Paris and works for German, Austrian, and Swiss companies
  operating in France.\r\n\r\nThe logo they are after should be a very simple wordmark
  containing their company name (\"ABTF\") as well as a brief description of what
  they do (literally: \"Audit, Bookkeeping & Tax in France\").\r\n\r\nUnfortunately,
  I was only able to come up with one idea:\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/logo_5917.png]\r\n\r\nI
  am planning to color this logo in the colors of the French flag.\r\n\r\nPlease let
  me know what you think of it and how it could be improved. Thanks a lot for any
  input!"

    Why a folded corner?\r\n\r\nTechnically: the scale between left and right seems
    off to me. Also the lockup seems very uncertain. I don't think you need the rules.
    I'd try something bolder on the right, or maybe a white box around the right.
    But more importantly, the idea."

  body: I agree with ^, the original version was better. Have you considered somehow
    emphasizing A, B, T and F of the right-hand side type to make it related to the
    ABTF on the left ? Perhaps something as simple as using heavier weight for these
    letters ..

  body: "Hi & thanks for your suggestions so far.\r\n\r\nThe client hasn't yet decided
    on which logo to go for. They want something very simplistic, even the earmark
    is too much for them. Actually, I'm making a website for the client and the logo
    is \"just\" a by-product. Here's the current version of the website, if anybody
    is interested: [[http://temp.designbits.de|Link to project]]\r\n\r\nFeedback is
