  for headlines in a local newspaper. It looks slightly like HTF Verlag Black, but
  the G and Q are a bit wider. Any ideas ?\r\n\r\n(this could be a custom type, it
  is a fairly big newspaper)"

  body: Nah, I did compare and Verlag is slightly wider (as opposed to what I wrote
    in the first message). Out of that it <i>is</i> quite similar. And I've looked
    into Neutraface too, but the cross bar on the E is set very low and I don't like
    it that much.

    case, have you seen <a href=\"http://www.houseind.com/fonts/neutrafaceno2/viewfonts\">Neutraface
    Nr. 2</a>? But still not exact, I think \u2026"
