  fascinating, great read on the history and development of the Adobe branding for
  their desktop apps:\r\n[[http://xd.adobe.com/#/featured/article/536?PID=2768139|Reinventing
  the System: The New Adobe Desktop Brand]]\r\n\r\n(also appears to hint that we'll
  see CS5 very soon)"

    squareness :(

    Taskbar. Nicely done.

  body: I just hope they actually make the interfaces of all the apps work the same,
    include glyph palette in all, and allow stylistic sets in AI. I could care less
    about the icons if they don't fix the hodge/podge interface.

  body: "Changing the interface has got to take time, when you are integrating the
    different interfaces from what, a half dozen companies. I think Illustrator is
    the only big app that is entirely Adobe-made. Even InDesign is based on PageMaker,
    which was Aldus. Then there is all the Macromedia stuff.\r\n\r\nWhile it might
    seem a great idea to pick one interface, the problem is choosing which one. Folk
    get upset when you start moving shortcuts and workflows around on them.\r\n\r\nI
    think Adobe has done a pretty good job, with the interfaces getting closer and
    closer together all the time. I suspect we will see more this version, but still
    short of perfection."

  body: Totally agree on the interfaces, and I realize most people here don't do web
    and interactive development but if you think the interface consistency is bad
    for print apps you should try going back and forth between Illustrator, Photoshop,
    and Flash. Paste in Place from Illustrator to Flash annoys me at least once a
    day.

  body: Don, they are working on CS-5 in what THEY call a suite. I would buy your
    argument for CS-1 & 2 but by now, they need to cut the crap and get it done, already.

    through typography is rad."

    would be a branding revolution: not having a thing at all.\r\n\r\nI would love
    to see the meeting where Adobe's designers explain this rebranding. :P"

    all you really ask for is quick recognition, not art.

    and workflows around on them.</cite>\r\n\r\nWhy not let the user do the picking?
    If there are five applications with diverse interfaces in the suite, fully debug
    each of the five interface styles for each application, and make it a user-configurable
    setting which one is presented by the application to the user.\r\n\r\nThat way,
    users comfortable with the traditional interface for any of the applications can
    keep those interfaces, and they can set the other ones to be similar for when
    they move to the other applications from the one most important to them."

    issues are a huge source of bugs for software.
