  body: "Keep in mind that text on any web page is subject to client-side overrides,
    and server-side impositions of font size and face annoy many end users. This isn't
    to say you shouldn't have reasonable control over your layout, just that you should
    maintain a degree of flexibility acknowledge that you can't have total control.\r\n\r\nUnless
    you post everything as an image or flash object or PDF, which will also annoy
    people.\r\n\r\nFor your title, which will in all likelihood be set as an image,
    have at whatever you want."

  body: "don't forget sIfr, its a handy flash-based override for text on a website
    (provided the user has flash, or else it will render in whatever the CSS tells
    it to)\r\n\r\nI wouldn't recommend it for the post text, but I've seen it successfully
    integrated into sites to spice up headlines, subheads, pull quotes and navigation.
    \ It's worth a try anyway!"
