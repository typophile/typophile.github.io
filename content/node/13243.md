body: "I apologize if this has been discussed here already. I'm having a hard time
  thinking of the right words to use in a search. I have a sense that the typographic
  world must be discussing this somewhere, but I haven't been able to track down any
  websites so far.\r\n\r\nHere's the situation: Target Corporation has licenses for
  around 1,000 fonts. There are about 700 creative types who have the access to this
  font library. Currently we have a couple of printed specimen books in the corporate
  library and one Type Specimen Book in PDF format that can be viewed over the network.
  \r\n\r\nRecently, the Corporation is transferring basic resources to the corporate
  intranet site. Our type team needs to come up with a way to organize and display
  our type library that will be useful to the creative teams via this intranet. Here's
  where I could use your ideas:\r\n\r\n1. Do any of you have experience with setting
  up web-based type specimen books?\r\n\r\n2. If you were able to view your company's
  type library on-line, what kind of options would you like to see?\r\n\r\n3. Do you
  know of a foundry or font vendor website that does a particularly good job of displaying
  their type libraries that you can provide links to?\r\n\r\n4. Is there software
  available to create specimen books for the web?\r\n\r\nI'd be happy to listen to
  your brainstorms or recommendations on people to talk to about this. I've got access
  to an internal tech team that is more knowledgeable than me. I wouldn't mind giving
  them a challenge! \r\n\r\n"

  body: As basic as it is, I've always thought MyFonts does a good job on sample text.
    However, Veer has a pretty cool setup with the mouse-over feature for a quick
    flavor.

    this isn't web specific but you can download a script for InDesign that creates
    type specimens of all your open fonts, say if you use Extensis to manage your
    fonts. I've used it. It works. It can take a while depending how may fonts you
    have open. You can also customize by editing the script directly.\r\n\r\nhttp://share.studio.adobe.com/axAssetDetailSubmit.asp?aID=10653&back=http%3A%2F%2Fshare%2Estudio%2Eadobe%2Ecom%2FaxBrowseSubmit%2Easp%3Fr%3D0%26t%3D54%26pgsel1%3D2"
