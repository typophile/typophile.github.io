  body: "These look like the cardboard inserts from the bottle caps on glass milk
    bottles. What is the age of these items? (I'm asking because these may be pre-digital.)
    I think Lex is right that these may reproduce a hand-drawn logo. A quick scan
    of Blackletter fonts didn't show anything that matched the Bridgeman lettering.\r\n\r\n-
