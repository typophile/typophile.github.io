    are some versions of Artcraft that aren't clones.\r\n\r\nI also have copies of
    Artcraft Light and Light Italic I purchased as shareware some years ago from <a
    href='http://www.mattjalbert.com/' target='_blank'>Matt Jalbert</a>, but he doesn't
    seem to be offering those anymore."

    Definitely 'Artcraft' but the OPTI version as none of the available to sell/legal/not-clone
    version are perfectly matching. The closest might be the [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/ascender/artcraft-pro|Pro
    version]].\r\n\r\nEDIT: knew I've seen before. Here's the [[http://typophile.com/node/100467|previous
    discussion]] on the topic."
