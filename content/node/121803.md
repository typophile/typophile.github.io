body: "Hello there! This is my font called FUSION SANS. The idea behind it was to
  pair up with the font called Sharik Sans (which is the font I used to write out
  Fusion Sans). It's main purpose is to be in body copy on packaging for the Fusion
  brand. I wanted it to look simple, readable, but still pleasing to the eye. \r\n\r\n\r\nDo
  you think it pairs well with Sharik Sans? If not, do you have any suggestions?\r\n\r\nWhat
  do you think about the spacing on my test words and do my letters work well together?\r\n\r\nThank
  you all! \r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/FusionFont1_6428.jpg]"

    body: "Thank you for commenting! \r\n\r\nThe overall look was supposed to have
      different weights, I was hoping it would give my font a more authentic feel.
      However, do you think the stroke thickness varying takes away from the font? "

  body: Since this kind of typeface emulates a pen stroke of some sort, it could be
    expected a modulation in thickness inside a single letter (here most visible in
    the uppercase). However, looking at your images, the strokes of |p| and |i| are
    overall darker than those of |a| and |n|, for example.
