body: Hello, fellow typophiles - <BR> <BR>I&#39;ve been trying for some time now to
  identify the typeface the New Yorker uses in their small headings &#40;not the titles
  of pieces, but titles of plays and movies, for instance, in the &#34;goings on about
  town&#34; section&#41; - <BR> <BR>I&#39;ve seen it a couple other places, too, and
  would love to know what it is - <BR> <BR>See the attached image for a sample I pulled
  from a PDF from the New Yorker -  <BR> <BR>Thanks for any help! <BR> <BR>A. <BR>

  body: It&#39;s neither of those - the middle horizontal stroke on the E and H in
    this typeface is vertically centered - also the center point of the M is on the
    baseline - <BR> <BR>Any other ideas?

    target="_blank">VF Sans</a> which was done for Vanity Fair. The New Yorker is
    published by the same company, Conde Nast. Unfortunately, this font is not available
    to the general public. <BR> <BR>The old metal face Vogue is also very similar
    to this.
