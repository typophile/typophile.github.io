  story g.\r\n\r\nWhile \"traditionally\" a y's descender is more diagonal than a
  g's, the difference is still a small one. I ask particularly because my own handwriting
  includes y's with a descender more like that's of a g's. Do we have history on this?
  Has anyone tried?\r\n\r\n"

  body: Why don't you give it a try yourself? I have a feeling that convention and
    tradition are why we don't usually see double-story "Y"s. However in handwriting
    you can sometimes catch a loopy tail on a "y" and this might suggest possible
    ways to design it.

  body: "Something else now that I'm thinking about it...perhaps a double-story y,
    if it loops back from the tail creating a second bowel, would be too easy to mistake
    with a LC g? \r\n\r\n@terminaldesign - that's a really nice looking typeface!"

    double-story y's. It's not rare at all.
