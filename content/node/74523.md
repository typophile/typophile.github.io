  over at iStockPhoto]] and now I want to create something similar for my own logo,
  even using the same image.\r\n\r\nThanks to the great support in the Type ID board,
  I could find out the font is RNS Camelia, so I could come up with this:\r\n\r\n...\r\n\r\nI
  don't really know, do you think the font is too thin?\r\nIt looks good it in the
  subtitle, though.\r\n\r\nI gave it a second shot using Segoe UI:\r\n\r\n...\r\n\r\nThis
  doesn't look as professional by far...\r\nI'm also unsure whether to use the Gaussian
  blur or not.\r\n\r\nPerhaps you could recommend a different font?\r\nI'm open to
  all kinds of suggestion (and I don't have any experience with design at all).\r\nIt
  doesn't have to use the red-and-white contrast either, I just liked the idea.\r\n\r\nThe
  logo is intended for my hypnosis/coaching company, it should convey a kind of wellness
  and luxury, like you would expect from an expensive spa hotel.\r\n\r\nThanks!"

    when you're simply taking the exact idea AND font AND image and just changing
    the letters. I mean, you even use the same single letter color difference as the
    already made banner. This isn't design, it's just copying EXACTLY something you
    like the look of."

    it's taken from a glossy magazine, I like that a lot.\r\n\r\nI'm aware that it's
    not identity design - and it's not meant to be.\r\nAt this point I'm just starting
    off with this, from a marketing perspective I'm probably not specialized enough.\r\nI
    want to get some more experience and then decide what I want to focus on (e. g.,
    helping people quit smoking or lose weight). Depending on that, I'd invest money
    in a good CI.\r\n\r\nSo right now, I just want to get a somewhat good design for
    my extremely low budget.\r\nAnd any help and suggestions are highly appreciated.
    :-)\r\n\r\nYes, of course it's copying - so what?\r\nI don't think there should
    be copyright issues (they use different styles for their banners every time),
    and I'd purchase the image.\r\nAnd as I said, I'll have a real CI designed once
    I know exactly what I want to specialize on and have a larger budget."

    the idea behind the logo that needs work first. No sense suggesting changes to
    the paint scheme of a boat you know is going to sink.\r\n\r\nI wasn't suggesting
    copying it was illegal . . . merely poor taste.\r\n\r\nWhy do you want to brand

    at all if you're a student)?"

    trying to brand myself actually, I'm merely looking for a nice-looking header
    to start with.\r\nI'm a science of computer science and I want to finish my grade.\r\n\r\nBut
    in addition to that, I've taken private classes in hypnosis - which is what I
    want to do for a living and to finance my studies.\r\nGiven everything I've read
    on marketing, one should always specialize so that you have a clear target group.\r\n\r\nSince
    I currently don't know what I'd like to specialize in (that comes with more experience),
    I think it's not really useful to think about branding at this point.\r\nMy CI
    would probably look different if I were targeting people who want to quit smoking
    than if I wanted to help people with improving their self-confidence.\r\n\r\nI'm
    not necessarily trying to reproduce something existing - you see, I'm just not
    a designer, and I lack the budget to pay someone serveral hundreds or even thousands
    of dollars for a logo that is likely to change in a couple of months.\r\nSee my
    dilemma?\r\nWhat would you do, given that situation?\r\n\r\nI also understand
    your criticism: If this were a programming board, I'd also recommend someone to
    either learn how to program properly or find a professional to do the work for
    him because that would be the only way to get decent results.\r\nBut, given the
    small budget and the fact that this is just an interim solution, I'd really appreciate
    it if you could put the higher standards aside for a moment. :-)"

  body: "> not a single suggestion concerning the logo itself?\r\n\r\nI realize you're
    just looking for a quickie solution, but you're going about this the wrong way.\r\n\r\nYou
    don't design a logo with a big promotional photo behind it. You first design a
    logo by itself; one that will work well on your letterhead, business card, etc,
    and that will work in black-and-white as well as color, and one that will work
    well in tiny sizes, and most importantly which does a good job of representing
    your business.\r\n\r\nOnce you've designed the logo, then you can start thinking
    about applying it to web banners.  \r\n\r\nSo put the photo aside and give your
    logo some careful thought and post some logo ideas by themselves, and I'm sure
    you'll get some advice.\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: "I think people are genuinely trying to help you with good branding.  Here
    are some perhaps provocative questions for you.  No need to answer them here,
    but you will probably have to answer them as you develop your business:\r\n\r\n\"I
    don't really want to invest too much energy into this\"\r\nWhy not invest some
    time and money into something as essential to the success of your business as
    branding?\r\n\r\n\"it won't be used anywhere other than the website header\"\r\nWhy
    even have a website when it doesn't relate to any other part of your business
    brand?\r\n\r\n\"I'd really appreciate it if you could put the higher standards
    aside for a moment\"\r\nWhy would you approach your business this way, do you
    want to communicate that sentiment to your customers?\r\n\r\nWaiting until you
    make enough to invest in a good identity and branding solution is like a computer
    programmer waiting to get a computer until they are a successful programmer.  In
    other words, you will likely never get there until you invest in consistent and
    effective communication with your potential customers.  That could be a logo,
    or it could be word of mouth, but you need to focus on the plan for communicating
    the value and benefits of your business to your customers.  Copying graphics is
    a waste of time that you could be spending working out the foundation of the business
    you are trying to create.  I do hope your business is a big success, and wish
    you all the best as you move forward with this challenging task.\r\n\r\n"
