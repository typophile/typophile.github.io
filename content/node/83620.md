  has a very characteristic font for its logo:\r\nhttp://www.vgrevolution.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/jagged_alliance_logo-640x250.jpg\r\n\r\nIt
  is NOT a real font, because it is known that it had been painted (i.e. a rastergraphics
  produced for the game). But I hope and believe that someone can tell me about a
  similar looking font!?\r\nI would really appreciate any hints or advices.\r\n\r\nKind
  regards\r\nChristoph"
