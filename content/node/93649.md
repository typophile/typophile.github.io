  me know what you guys think.\r\n\r\nSome background: Antique Olive, old german book
  of lettering and type for advertisement (yellow, wide, can't remember the name),
  bicycles, airplanes, generic influences (at least in my work) I guess.\r\nThis typeface
  is not for any custom project (at least yet).\r\n\r\nSo far I've only worked on
  the lowercase, kerning not done yet, in image i used optical.\r\nWill post more
  characters in few days."

  body: "On caps, compare to the squarish look of some letters /A,V,K,M,V), I think
    some others are too rounded /D,R,S,P/. However the lower case are rounded. So,
    find your way \u2014 square or round \u2014 and applied it on all the letters.
    The Y seems too narrow. I like the K"

  body: "<blockquote>find your way \u2014 square or round</blockquote>\r\nI think
    it's not so much an \"either/or\" situation. More a balancing act.\r\n\r\nSome
    random observation:\r\n|y| looks very narrow\r\n|g|'s lower right loop extends
    a bit too much\r\n|A|M|V|'s vertices are somewhat distracting"

  body: Thank you both for critics. I will look at all these things. I have to agree
    that it's a balancing act, but since I haven't even printed this one yet, I guess
    the roundness of some letters will change at some point.

  body: "You know what? I don't know why but just looking at these letter shapes one
    can say that you must be from a Nordic country. I really like how /s/ and /a/
    complement each other. /y/ is really waaaaay too narrow. I must agree on that.\r\n\r\nYou
    will also have to do something about stroke weight, because vertical strokes seem
    thinner than horizontal ones. That's actually quite common. And most mono-contract
    sans serif have verticals a bit thicker than horizontals to make them look the
    same.\r\n\r\nUC letters seem to have a lot of character but maybe bit too different
    one than lc ones."

  body: "Hi everyone,\r\n\r\nThanks for your comments. While doing this one very slowly
    lately I've come across so many weak points, that still exist in this pdf. K,
    S, s, g need a lot of work. Anyway, I put a new pdf (power3.pdf) to let you know
    what's going on. Any critic, etc. is welcome and hope it looks better than previously.
    For example UC letters have been tamed down a bit, those round letters just got
    annoying very quickly. Also kerning is undone...\r\n\r\nI will add lots of alternate
    letters, reason being possible future use where I or customer may have some preference
    for the project and we may find some matching things in alternates. I prefer to
    make fonts custom for each project."

  body: "Alphabetics:\r\nThe only glyph that really isn't working is the \"Q\". And
    in the \"g\" I would raise the horizontal bar a bit. In the \"y\" you can \"cheat\"
    by raising the part that sits on the baseline (to make more air for the descender).\r\n\r\nNumerals:\r\nThe
    \"4\" is too small - lower the bar. The \"7\" is too big.\r\n\r\nOther:\r\nThe
    acute/grave accents aren't working. I'm not sure about the comma/quotes. The period
    (and the others) would probably be much nicer larger. The bars of the Euro are
    too close. The percent doesn't need that curly join thing.\r\n\r\nBTW, have you
    thought about the Italic?\r\n\r\nI do hope to see this released!\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "Thanks!\r\n\r\nI think the other section is a bit too playful also. I've
    always been playing with some characters due to the nature of the jobs (or my
    \"customization\" towards the job/layout), which later I felt to be a bit unnecessary
    at times. Sometimes custom fonts I've made include already graphic elements/characters
    in the font file rather than made separately in indesign layout file. I think
    I will keep them for awhile and tomorrow change them into more consistent one's
    as I did with capitals:) \r\n\r\nI've thought about few different italics. One
    more slanted and one more organic/human. Before I start giving form to italics
    I will make this medium/semibold cut ready. I've been thinking about this kind
    of combo: Thin Light / Medium / Semibold/ Bold / Black and more condensed cuts
    better for long bodytext + maybe italics. On the other hand I really like working
    at the company I'm in (we have custom fonts made by Tomi / Suomitype) because
    there are no italics. Contrasts become more interesting and layouts look stronger
    / bold. Anyway, due to not knowing yet the destiny of this font It's maybe even
    good to make italics so I have that option also."

  body: "Hey, I can't stand Italics! It's quite refreshing to read what you wrote.
    BTW you might enjoy Typo magazine, which uses (used to use?) demi weights for
    emphasis instead of Italics. It worked superbly.\r\n\r\nThe things is, a designer
    necessarily accommodates things beyond his own desires, so making Italics is in
    a way an act of pragmatism for people like us. But if one does have to make Italics,
    at least one can do something interesting, culturally progressive. And here's
    an upside-down idea I had very recently: instead of making it softer, it should
    in fact be harder. We are after all talking about <em>emphasis</em>!\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
