I found a delightful (and delightfully outdated) book about a week ago called <em>Functional Newspaper Design</em> published in 1956 by Edmund C. Arnold (then editor of Linotype News) which, not surprisingly, pushes Corona rather strongly.

In no particular order, why not look at:

 Worldwide (Shinntype)

Oh, and one thing... newspaper readers want their content to be serious, so the typeface should be, to quote hrant, "honest." IMO, Paperback, although very gorgeous, is too decorative for news usage. i mean i love the design, so much so that i'm looking for an excuse to license it, but i think it would just be inappropriate in a news setting.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">That's a great comment about the seriousness of the typeface, Paul. The publication in question is an "Arts & Entertainment" sort of deal and possibly we could get away with a more playful typeface. But we have a sister publication that is more conservative and I want a new face for that one too.

Kandal is really cool and also is appropriate in that the paper is located in Mark's hometown of St. Paul, Minn. I got a PDF specimen of that to add to the stack.

A lot of good suggestions so far. But we still need to know at least the basics about the paper and its readership. Yes, a newspaper font needs to me more transparent than most, but there are still so many choices that narrowing it down based on things like the "angle" of the newspaper, the age of its readership, etc. actually helps - noting once again that Design is largely about constraints.

The paper is in need of redesign because nobody here was a designer until I came. I put an example of the cover of the paper in the original message in this thread. And it actually looked much worse than the jpg because the ink gain made the colors less contrasty.

I have a Mercury showing they were gracious enough to send, and have also previously requested one from Lucas Fonts for a few of their faces which they provided as well. Speaking of which - you may want to check out LucasFonts "The Antiqua" series.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I am the editor of a small student newspaper, and we just went through a redesign initiated by my Ad Manager and myself. We went from Palatino (a good basic font) to a great one called "Utopia"... the link is below. It can go very small before the visibility is compromised. We keep it at 9 pt with a 10pt leding.

Take a look:

		<div class="commentbody">>I really like PDF specimens and I wish H&F-J and Nick had them.

Sorry I don't have individual PDF specimens for my fonts (except Bodoni Egyptian).
One of many "must-do's".
However, there is a PDF of my whole collection (one page per typeface) on my home page, which gives some idea.

A good PDF resource for news faces is www.newseum.org.
You can download today's front pages for hundreds of papers from around the world.
And Acrobat enables you to identify the faces used.
(Two with mine in are The Birminghman News, Alabama, and the Globe and Mail, Canada)</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Thanks, Nick, I downloaded the big specimen PDF.

Right now the faces I like the best are Mercury and Farnham, but oy, the prices on those two! I don't think a little paper like ours can afford $1400+ for a 5-user license. </div>

Delicato by Mr. Hattenbach
Farnham by Mr. Schwartz
Grad & Kandal by Mr. Simonson
Mercury by H&F-J
Worldwide by Mr. Shinn

So, some beautiful faces are on the shortlist. Thanks for your help!</div>
