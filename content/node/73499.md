  versions by P22/Lanston Type Company and was intrigued: When bought directly from
  the P22 website, the prices seem to be quite reasonable ($80-%120 for a full type
  family with good glyph coverage and a full range of OpenType features) and I''m
  strongly considering picking up a few evergreen classics like Goudy Oldstyle and
  Cloister. Still, before I spring for it, I was wondering if anyone has anything
  to say about the general construction of the fonts. The online samples certainly
  look fine, but I''m curious to know how well kerned they are and how well-constructed
  the outlines are compared to fonts by other makers.'
