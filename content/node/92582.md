  body: "There was a thread elsewhere which addressed the question of what such thingies
    might properly be called as, if I recall correctly, \u201Ccatchword\u201D was
    the majority choice.\r\n\r\nSome of my fonts include catchwords, but not these
    particular examples. However, you could try a search at MyFonts.com with the keyword
    \u201Dcatchword,\u201D or take a look at Letterhead Fonts: the /THE/ especially
    has an LHF kinda vibe\u2026"

    Boston Truckstyle]]</strong>\r\nIt was stored in letter /& of the old Type-1 and
    TTF  version of the font,\r\nbut I see the latest OTF version has a normal /&
