body: if we had type sites that you could <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/workshop/browser/external/overview/ie7_opensearch_ext.asp">search
  directly from your browser</a>? I'm assuming that most browsers now support this.
  Wouldn't it be awesome to search typophile, veer, fontshop, myfonts directly? Just
  a thought. :^D

  body: "Wow! That Rollyo search is absolutely amazing. I'll have to \"roll out\"
    some of my own.\r\n\r\nI was going to suggest Yubnub.org, which is \"a (social)
    command line for the web.\" Basically, using very simple variables you can create
    commands to search your favorite websites for whatever you want (ex: \"gim porsche\"
    searches Google Images for \"porsche.\" To speed up my own searching for fonts,
    I made the commands \"myfonts\" and \"linotype,\" which, of course search those
    sites for whatever you want. It's not as comprehensive as Rollyo, but you can
    search from the search bar and/or address bar in most browsers (go to \"Installing
    YubNub\" at the bottom of the main page), so it's a bit more convenient than Rollyo."

  body: "In firefox, you can do the following:\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>visit myfonts.com\r\n<li>right-click
    the search-box, and select \"add keyword for search\" (or similar, I'm using the
    german version...)\r\n<li>enter a name and a short(!) keyword, and save it as
    a new bookmark\r\n<li>you can now just type to the urlbar: [keyword] [fontname]
    and press enter\r\n<li>firefox will do a search on myfonts, and display the results
    directly\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\nSo, for me this means:\r\nI type \"mf helvetica\" and
    I get the same results immediately, as if I visited myfonts.com and did a search
    there.\r\nImho this is even faster than using a search-plugin (because there,
    you often have to switch search engines (two clicks + typing) instead of just
    typing.\r\n\r\nOf course, this works with every search-field, not only on myfonts.com.
    I have keywords for google (g), google image search (gp), amazon (am) and many
    more.\r\n\r\nEdit: thanks to typophiles flash-interface, this doesn't work here
