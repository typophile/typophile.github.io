body: "After heavy google searching, whatthefont.com and searching other type databases
  including my own. I've yet to find any possible matches or similar Type. This \"Times\"
  is a Nameplate for a Newspaper in the Middle East. I was asked to update the Nameplate,
  However keeping the Traditional \"Times\" in tact. \r\n\r\nSo, before I take the
  time to recreate the type from scratch, I thought I would ask to see if anyone else
  had an idea of what typeface this was. (No EPS, AI, or any vector format was available.
  )\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://i53.tinypic.com/2i117hs.png\">\r\n\r\nThanks for your
  help,\r\n"

    you think could work and customise it.\r\nAnyway, for a chance to receive some
    replies, please move the thread to the Type ID Board proper (presently it\u2019s
    in Type ID Board \xBB Solved IDs \xBB Blackletter)."
