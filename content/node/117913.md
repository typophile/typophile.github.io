body: "Hey all, I'm currently revamping the typography for a text-heavy site. It's
  currently using Freight Sans and Freight Text, which are nice fonts but Text has
  some readability issues and Sans' style isn't exactly what I'm looking for\u2014it's
  a bit too 'whimsical':\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/XUYGFjn.png\" />\r\n\r\nI'm
  looking to replace it with [[http://carvalho-bernau.com/lyon/|Lyon Text]], which
  is a very clean and readable serif:\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/7J3ykxM.gif\"
  />\r\n\r\nI'm not sure, however, about what typeface (sans-serif, preferably) to
  pair this with. Helvetica Neue used to be a go-to, but it looks rather generic now.
  The designer of Lyon has an anonymous-feeling Grotesk named [[http://carvalho-bernau.com/atlas/|Atlas]]
  that looks interesting, and other options like [[https://commercialtype.com/typefaces/graphik|Graphik]]
  are catching my eye as well.\r\n\r\nI'm looking for a modern, slightly 'opinionated'
  but mostly neutral sans-serif face that is pretty versatile, that would match well
  with the clean-cut face of Lyon. I'd appreciate some help on this front\u2014thanks
  in advance for your suggestions."

    LL Brown.

  body: "If you want something a bit more neutral, the designer of Lyon has also made
    a font for that: https://www.typotheque.com/fonts/neutral\r\nI think it has a
    bit more character than Helvetica (and most importantly, isn\u2019t Helvetica)
    but is more quiet than others mentioned in this thread \u2013 most of which (LL
    Circular, Graphik, LL Brown, maybe also Founders Grot) I would find too constructed
    and cold to pair with a clean but still warm/\u201Cbookish\u201D font like Lyon."

  body: "LL Circular works great, but it\u2019s the choice of NYT Sunday Magazine
    (after all Lyon is commissioned by NYT Sunday). If you don\u2019t mind using the
    same style as a magazine that is read by millions of people, use it.\r\n\r\nLyon
    is modern, humble, scientifically apt, elegant and legible. It has a certain style
    and asserts a statement that is not so strong. So you could either go with plain
    Neo-Grotesks to knock it down (LL Circular/Akkurat/Brown/) or go with warm humanists
    to honor its style (Scala Sans/Kievit/Whitney/Mercury/Ideal Sans). Or you could
    even risk some slab serifs like Chaparral or well-done Clarendons like Sentinel."
