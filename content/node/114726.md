  a while in the pipeline but now it\u2019s there: I\u2019m pleased to announce the
  release of [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/andreas-stotzner/hibernica/|Hibernica]].\r\nHibernica
  is the \u2018Irish sister\u2019 of Lapidaria, on which design it has been based.
  So you have even the possibility to combine those two for a perfect harmonized look
  in multilingual settings.\r\nAll fonts contain the full set of dotted \u1E03 \u010B
  \u1E0B \u1E1F \u0121 \u1E41 \u1E57 \u1E61 \u1E6B in upper- and lowercase and an
  additional set of a dozen celtic ornaments.\r\nThank you all typophiles who commented
  earlier upon single aspects of the design. I\u2019m not Irish nor do I command any
  of the Gaelic languages, but, as a type freak, I enjoyed very much to dig into this
  matter. Maybe, you interested parties make something of it \u2026 \r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/schild_hib_4_4527.png]\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/schild_hib_5_4526.png]\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/schild_hib_7_4033.png]"

  body: "Really beautiful design! I have no use for this, but this is actually the
    first time would like to do some Gaelic typography. The only thing I do question
    is the sharp angle in the horizontal bar in /A. I might give that line a curve,
    but I'm not sure.\r\n\r\nBy the way, on the second line of the second picture
    you used the unicase /\xE9 instead of the lowercase /\xE9 in \"heireann\"."
