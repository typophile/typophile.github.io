body: "Hello guys!\r\n\r\nI am facing a strange font behavior. Let me sum it up- The
  glyph is slanted in the glyph cell. The thumbnail preview of the glyph is slanted.
  Until there, everything is fine. The problem starts when some glyphs appear upright
  in the Metrics window. Eventually, the .otf file carries these upright previews,
  whereas my outlines describe italic shapes!\r\n\r\nI have been re-booting FontLab,
  cleaning up the glyph cells, re-inserting, etc, the problem is still here. Does
  is make any sense to you?\r\nMany Thanks\r\n\r\n"

    in Font Info > Key dimensions. And positive value slants to the left.\r\nSurely
    this happens to all glyphs in the font.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\nJohnych"

    just checked my font info, and the values are correct."

  body: "After few try outs, I discovered the bug... It was hidden in the OT definition
    within the property window. For the given glyphs, switching their definition from
    Unassigned to Simple resolved the problem! EZ as Volt :)\r\n\r\n"
