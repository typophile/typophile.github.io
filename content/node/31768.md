body: "Hello! \r\nFor the body I want to choose a sans serif that is helvetica-like,
  only a bit more narrow. But not as narrow as Helvetica condensed, of course. I had
  Imago from BQ for a similar project, so I don\u2019t want to use it again. It should
  also be a bit more contemporary and lighter (and softer) than Imago. The Magazin
  will not look crammed, there is a lot of white space and room for large photos.
  \r\nI am happy to hear your suggestions.\r\nYour choices for a serif companion (interview-passages,
  quotations, editorial) are also welcome. \r\nbest regard, anton\r\n\r\n"

  body: "I recently gathered a few typefaces that are <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/fontfeed/archives/helvetica_alternatives.cfm\">similar
    to Helvetica</a>. <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=verity.search&searchstr=Paralucent\">Paralucent</a>
    Condensed would fit your requirements, but I don't know how well it would do for
    long reading.\r\n\r\nAlso consider relatives of <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=verity.search&searchstr=Trade%20Gothic\">Trade
    Gothic</a>, such as <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/showfont.cfm?fid=C.871.0.0\">Bulldog</a>,

  body: "Hello Stephen, \r\n\r\nthank you for your answer. \r\nFirst I took a look
    at paralucent light condensed. What startled me first a bit was devicefonts\u2019
    website that can not conceal the companies interest in \"fun fonts\". But p. really
    seems fine, i.e. serious. The \"g\" adds some personality. Plus a real italic
    is rare for this kind of fonts. Is the kerning really good? \"a\" and \"g\" nearly
    touch each other in the preview window, it might also be a screen problem, though.
    But: the dot on the i seems really big, that is for sure.  \r\n\r\nTrade Gothic
    is always a choice, but with this font I always think of pages full of text, and
    not of open and somewhat airy layouts. and maybe not \"european\" enough. \r\n
    \ \r\nBulldog, hmm ... it is a bit to narrow, and its elegance is maybe not so
    appropriate for this job (science, hiTech). But I have been using it for another
    client for years.       \r\n\r\nSpiegel: Here in Austria Der Spiegel is read a
    lot and it would seem a bit odd, if people think ... hm this magazin font reminds
    me of someting ... I think this is the reason why no magazin I know uses this
    (very good) font. \r\n\r\nBrown Light looks great in the FontShop Preview Window,
    and it is the font that I give some consideration. It also has the modernist (helvetica,
    imago-like) feeling, that I wanted. Does anyone have experiences with this font?
    It seems worth a try. \r\nOr: is there another Brown-like font that you know?
    \r\n\r\nQualifying Softer: Hmm. Maybe I was thinking of this squarish quality,
    that can be found in Paralucent. But this feeling only is conveyed in the more
    extended versions, I think. So maybe it was a bit contradictory.\r\n\r\nthank
    you for your help so far.\r\n\r\nPS: Good FontFeed at fontshop! \r\n"
