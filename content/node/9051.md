body: i found these books for about $2 each in an antique store. Quite a deal I thought.
  Does anyone else have or recognize these? The manual of style &#40;center&#41; is
  quite a handbook, that I would imagine is considered to be worth more than $2 dollars
  by many of you. What  do you think? <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/30/6458.jpg"

    is an &#39;antique typographic book&#39;. <BR> <BR>However, you may be well pleased:
    $2 each is a very good price for these old books. The only one I&#39;m not familiar

    feel old. ;-&#41; But John is right -- good books for $2. Enjoy, Mitchell. <BR>
    <BR>John, I had the chance to handle an original Fournier <i>Manuel</i> at the
    Veatchs once. Very nice. But I had to make do with the Darmstadt facsimile for
    my own collection. <BR> <BR>-- Kent. <BR>
