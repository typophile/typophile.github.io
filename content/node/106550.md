  I was looking for. So I hope that you can help me with this one too.\r\nLike before,
  I'm looking for the name of the font for game translation (to English) where I'd
  like to preserve original font. There are some parts of the text which were done
  in English too so I collected all of them in one image.\r\nCould you please help
  with this font?"

  body: I took a better look and noticed that actually there are two different fonts.
    I found font similar to the lines with bigger letter (it's close to CenturyOldst
    BT Bold) but a substitute of smaller one is still unknown, especially where "v"
    and "y" letters looks the same way (different thickness of sides). I changed the
    picture to the one where only text with necessary font is shown.

    UPC]], a Microsoft font for the Thai language.

  body: Yeah, I don't use Windows (though I have it) that's why I didn't know that
    there is the font I was looking for. But that's strange, did I really look through
    that font there or I actually don't have it for some reason (maybe I need to add
    support for some language)? Anyway, I'll check it again. Thank you for your tip!
