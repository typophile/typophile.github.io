  body: "I did some searching at MyFonts and Dafont, but didn't find this. Part of
    the problem seems to be to guess the category. It seems unicase and cartoon-ish
    (a.k.a. 'funny', sometimes), so I searched cartoon, comic, funny, unicase, even
    some in combination. It could be a freebie, or a professional font made to look
    amateurish. I'm stumped.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
