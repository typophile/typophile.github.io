body: This is my first post on typophile. I&#39;ve frequented the boards for some
  time, and am a great fan of many of the designers here. What a community! <BR> <BR>I&#39;ve
  been building a type catalog for my upcoming pixel font foundry for a long time,
  but have in general, been reluctant to throw my work into the mix. <BR> <BR>You
  see, what I don&#39;t know about typography, is a lot. <BR> <BR>But I do enjoy creating
  character sets. So, I think it&#39;s time I just get over it and show some of my
  work. I am all too aware of the gains to be had by joining the community, both in
  general knowledge, and in the quality of my own critiqued work. <BR> <BR>My only
  concern is that I don&#39;t have to offer what the community has to offer me

  body: it looks like a font to be used only for a logotype, because i can&#39;t read
    it very easily. <BR> <BR>i wouldn&#39;t want to read more than 10 words in this
    font.

  body: Yeah, this is definately a titling font. As is Nuetron. Not necessarily restricted
    to logotype, though. Titles with style. <BR> <BR><IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif"

  body: maybe a little thinner? without removing the current spacing? or maybe add
    spacing. but i agree, this is a titling font. btw that 8 is cool.

  body: Tiffany, thanks for your suggestions. I&#39;ve read your critiques on other
    threads for some time, and am thankful you signed on to mine. you always have
    good insights to offer. Here are two lighter weights to examine. The font, as
    a whole, starts to break down the lighter the weight gets. Proportionally, I mean.
    Extra Light needs the descenders to be shortened, I think, but then I encounter
    point size conflicts with Light and Regular. Take the m for example. Its acenders
    had to be compromised to keep them from touching tip to tip. They&#39;re now one
    pixel shorter than the rest of the characters. <BR> <BR>Miguel, I never thought
    of the Iron Maiden reference, but now that you mention it, I can picture it perfectly!
    <BR> <BR>Thanks for your post. <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/14185.gif"
