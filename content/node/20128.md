      as soon as the are placed in TypeTool.\r\n\r\nI have google the problem etc
      but so far nothing I have tried has worked.\r\n\r\nSorry about the vague first
      posting I was in panic mode.\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Ben,\r\n\r\nI don't use TypeTool, I use FontLab, so I don't have a lot of
    advice on your current problem. Though it may seem a day late and a dollar short,
    I always advise creating outlines in the type drawing program from the start.
    There isn't really any advantage to drawing in Illustrator, since the tools in
    a type design program offer more control over point type, and there's usually
    just more work in bringing outlines from Illustrator. I'm sure you'll be thinking
    about that for next time....\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, <a href=\"http://fontlab.com/Font-tools/ScanFont/\">there
    is a plug-in</a> for TypeTool and FontLab from the FontLab folks that enables
    you to convert EPS files to type. I hope you have some budget left to get it.... "
