body: "Hi\r\n\r\nI'm trying to make a \"font\" (I don't have a \"type maker app\"
  so it's currently in illustrator atm.)\r\nI'm calling it \"Symp\" by the way :)\r\nIt's
  based on the amphi in the logo (square with rounded edges)\r\nMy hope is to use
  it in a magazine I'm creating for the convention in march 2011.\r\n\r\nThe convention
  is arranged by students at the Norwegian School of Economics and Business Administration,
  and is the largest of it's kind in north europe. We are all volunteers and students
  at the school. \r\n\r\nI have no formal education in design or typography. I'm most
  likely to become an accountant, so bear that in mind when you critique :) \r\n\r\nHere
  are some issues I've found in this first revision:\r\n1)Width of I, J and L. if
  I'm going for monospaced these will look odd, how to solve?\r\n2)I'm unsure about
  Y, T, R, J and L. There's something iffy about them\r\n3)Could i distinguish glyphs
  like U and V, P and Q in another way?\r\n4)Are Q and \xD8 understandable?\r\n5)Any
  big issues with readability taking the blockiness into concern?\r\n\r\n\r\nAll tips
  and hints are welcome. (No accounting jokes please... :D )\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/NHH-SYMPOSIET-OK-1_6292.jpeg]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/ekstekst2_5783.jpg]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/eksfont_6090.jpg]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/ekstekst_4716.jpg]"

  body: Updated a bit, went for scaled curved edges instead of circle. A little cleaner.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/ekstekst3_3686.jpg]
