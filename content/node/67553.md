    As the user could turn on multiple of these features, as the type designer you
    need to decide what happens in those conflicts. For example, which takes precedence
    on the numbers, 'c2sc' or 'onum'? I'd vote for c2sc.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\n\r\nT\r\n\r\nP.S.

  body: In my own fonts, I make the smallcap figures available through a combination
    of "default figure style" (as InDesign calls it, i.e. neither onum nor lnum) and
    "smcp" or "c2sc". The only drawback is that it does not allow you to make a distinction
    between tabular and proportional smallcap figures.

    between tabular and proportional smallcap figures.</cite>\r\n\r\nWell, you can
    still do it as a type designer: let tnum and pnum work on your \"default figures\"
    and still have the small cap figures overridden if either onum or lnum is applied.
    But of course InDesign and friends don't respect this, because of their simplified
    model of applying multiple features at once for figures.... sigh.\r\n\r\nWell,
    I can't complain, I guess. When the function was being implemented in InDesign
    2.0, the engineer (hi Eric) ran it by me and either he or somebody was trying
    to simplify and combine things in the UI, because there were so many OpenType
    layout features. At the time nobody was talking about doing these sorts of tricky
    things with figure styles... so it didn't even occur to me that there could be
    an issue, or if it did it was very hypothetical, not being driven by actual fonts
    people were trying to make not working properly.\r\n\r\nDang.\r\n\r\nT"

  body: "I have considered producing one set of tabular figures, and kerning them
    to produce proportional spacing.\r\n\r\nSo the user gets proportional with kerning
    turned on, and tabular with it off.\r\n(The same principle could be applied to
    monospaced typefaces in general: several people have inquired whether a kerned
    version of Panoptica was available, which is what prompted the idea.)\r\n\r\nHowever,
    I abandoned this technique, as it would require too much metadata in order to
    be effective.\r\nIn other words, it's unlikely that users would be aware that
    such \"a feature\" was in a font, even if it was mentioned in, say, a pdf specimen. "

    have small caps figs subbed in with your {smcp} and {c2sc} features, then I suggest
