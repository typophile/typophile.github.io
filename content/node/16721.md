  Robert Thorne purchased the foundry of [[Thomas Cottrell]], a former employee of
  the original William Caslon, which had been founded in 1757 when Cottrell and [[Joseph
  Jackson]] were fired in a wage dispute. By 1798 Thorne had replaced all of Cottrell\u2019s
  types with his own designs and in 1801 was the first type founder to begin showing
  the fat face types. He went on to design many popular  display typefaces. He also
  moved the foundry to Fann St. renaming it the Fann Street Foundry.\r\n\r\nUpon Thorne\u2019s
  death in 1820 the foundry was purchased at auction by [[William Thorowgood]] using
  money he had won in a lottery though he was never involved in the type founding
  business. Subsequently many of the types identified as Thorowgood's are actually
  the designs of Robert Thorne."
