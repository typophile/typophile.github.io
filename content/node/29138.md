body: "dear typophiles\r\n\r\nin a specimen book by Bauer & Co, Stuttgart (1600 pages
  - wonderful!) i found a font called \"Schmale runde Grotesk\" (Condensed round Grotesk).
  \ i digized some glyphs from a photo of a copy, some lines arent vertical and so
  on\u2026 its just a first test.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/runde_grotesk_1_2_4149.png]\r\n\r\ni
  have two questions regarding this font.\r\n\r\n- the library wasnt able to date
  the book, but i'd like to know a circa date - so here the clues i have: on the bottom
  of each page, H. Berthold AG is noted beneath Bauer & Co - Bauer was bought 1897
  by Berthold, as andreas mentions <a href=\"http://typophile.com/node/17643\">here</a>.
  AG is shown beneath Royal-Grotesk, so i guess it was after 1908 (in the same post
  as linked above, andreas states that theinhardt was bought 1908). any idea?\r\n\r\n-
  is there a reason for the very thin connecting parts in a, d and n? this feature
  is found in a, b, d, h, n, m, p, q, u.\r\n\r\nthanks for your help!"

    stroke near the intersection of two strokes of a glyph to provide compensation
    for ink bleeding or plugging during printing or overexposure from a photographic
    process."

  body: "<em>What about the upper-case letters ?</em>\r\n\r\nRight. The principle
    is not applied consistently in the original design, or in the digital copies shown.\r\nWhy
    don't you have a go at applying the ink-trap conceit to the upper case Thierry,
    rather than just parrot the past?\r\nSome original digital faces with an \"ink
    trap feature\": Bradlo, Amplitude, Chunkfeeder."

    the third uses thorns, not traps) in a decorative way, not for actually fighting
    gain.\r\n\r\nIn the case of Schmale Runde Grotesk, I have a feeling those weren't
    \"real\" traps either (not least because the caps don't have any trapping). One
    should look at a range of point sizes for clues.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "thanks martin, i didnt know this font. i found this specimen at the libary
    of HGKZ (university of applied sciences and art, z\xFCrich), close enough to lineto.
    it seems like a direct digitalization of the font, so what i had planned doesnt
    make much sense anymore.\r\n\r\nso nick, yes, maybe your idea could be something
    innovative instead of repeating what martha strutteregger did with it. i'll think
    about it.\r\n\r\nalessandro, none of the UC-letters show inktraps. but, @hrant,
    as i found this specimen in a specimenbook (printed), i can be pretty sure that
    they were not intended as inktraps - because they're a feature of the design,
    not a necessity of the design itself. they're too extreme to be just inktraps.
    and they're featured in all sizes. as soon as i get a good scan of the original
    page, i'll post it. right now at home i only have copies of the book."

  body: Re. Chunkfeeder -- my semantic slip, I was actually thinking of what Trapper
    (also by Jim Grieshaber) looks like, but gave it the wrong name. Which is strange,
    as the topic is trapping! -- I can only conclude that Chunkfeeder is a much more
    interesting name and got "trapped" in my memory, whereas the name Trapper makes
    me think of Davy Crockett, not type. Trappist would be a cool name too, and I
    would think of a monk ... reading in silence.
