body: "Hi All\r\n\r\nI am creating a book and wonder what your favorite character
  was\r\n \r\nThe book will be a collection of typographer's work that will focus
  on the beauty, elegance and construction of letterforms.  \r\n\r\nThe purpose of
  the book is not to look at whole fonts but rather examining and appreciating the
  small details and characteristics of the designs. \r\n\r\nIt is about appreciating
  fonts as forms rather than letters. The beauty of curves and construction. \r\n\r\nAt
  the moment this project stands as a hypothetical project in the hope that it could
  be put into bookstores or featured in magazines. \r\n\r\nIts critical agenda is
  to look at font formation rather than fonts themselves. How does the construction
  of a font create a certain characters, feel or tone?\r\n\r\nThe images - are very
  very very intial ideas for my spreads\r\n[[http://typophile.com/files/g.jpg]]\r\n\r\nIf
  you would like to show me your own favorite character that would be even cooler"
