  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Hello <BR> <BR>Like many people on Typophile, I have a collection of old type samples, the majority of which are 20&#39;s and 30&#39;s books. I want to reproduce some of these pages for a magazine article, and I wondered if anyone knows if I&#39;ll need permission to do this.  <BR> <BR>I am not sure if 20&#39;s and 30&#39;s is outside of copyright, and as some of the companies no longer exist, I am not sure who I could get permission of for a few. <BR> <BR>Any suggestions would be welcome. <BR> <BR>Thanks <BR> <BR>Jim</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Short answer: I think you&#39;re in the clear. Long answer: it&#39;s hard to be absolutely sure. <BR> <BR>Here&#39;s a fairly authoritative guide to <a href="http://www.unc.edu/~unclng/public-d.htm">when works pass into the public domain</a> from UNC. Everything published before 1923 is definitely public domain. Between 1923 and 1963, the copyright owner had the option of renewing copyright, but if not exercised, the work is now in the public domain. It&#39;s not trivial to determine whether copyright was renewed &#40;it&#39;s not like there&#39;s a searchable list online or anything&#41;, but my guess is that it&#39;s very unlikely that specimen books had their copyrights renewed. <BR> <BR>What I would do: contact the companies that are still around asking whether copyright was renewed, and, if no answer, assume it wasn&#39;t. <BR> <BR>I have a small <a href="http://www.levien.com/type/">archive</a> online, mostly scans from ATF books 1912-1943. I&#39;m in the process of moving the archive to the <a href="http://www.tug.org/">TUG</a> server, which has graciously offered to host the high quality 2400 dpi scans as well as the 200 dpi scans I have up now. <BR> <BR>I am not a lawyer, of course. Thank God for small favors!</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Yes, please contact the foundries, or children of foundries that still exist. Most of them love publicity, and will say yes to this sort of request in a heart beat. <BR> <BR>Here is a list of old foundries and their successors, just off of the top of my head. I&#39;m sure that others here can fill in more blanks. <BR> <BR>Mergenthaler Linotype, Dr.-Ing Hell, Haas, D&amp;P, Klingspor, and Stempel are all now part of Linotype Library GmbH. <BR> <BR>AGFA Monotype is the continuation of the various Monotype houses &#40;although Gerald Giampa&#39;s Lanston might own exlcusive rights to some of Lanston Monotype&#39;s collection. I don&#39;t know any of these details&#41;. AGFA Monotype now owns ITC wholly, as far as I know. But you can still contact ITC directly. <BR> <BR>I would direct all questions about H. Berthold AG to Berthold Types in Chicago. <BR> <BR>I don&#39;t know how the ATF collection&#39;s rights have been divided up. That has been discussed somewhere on Typophile before, though. <BR> <BR>I&#39;m sure I&#39;ve left a ton of things out</div>

		<div class="commentbody">It&#39;s <i>really</i> complicated and murky, but for the most part the US has the longest copyright terms of any nation in the galaxy. For example, the copyrights are starting to expire in the UK for Elvis&#39;s recordings, but that won&#39;t happen here until something like 2047. <BR> <BR>So for specimen books published in the &#39;20s and &#39;30s, I really think it&#39;s all in the clear.

		<div class="commentbody">I find myself running into snarly legalish issues quite a bit when it comes to fonts. I think it&#39;s important to make clear distinctions between what&#39;s legal, ethical, and moral. In happy cases, they all align and there&#39;s no problem. But often they don&#39;t, for many reasons. <BR> <BR>To me, the primary moral question is: what is the harm? In some cases, it&#39;s clear. A designer who uses a font fallen from someone&#39;s hard drive, rather than licensing it, directly harms the foundry by not paying the money that they&#39;re legally &#40;and morally&#41; entitled to. That, in turn, has other negative consequences, not least of which is discouraging font designers by sapping their rewards. <BR> <BR>For what Jim is asking, I can&#39;t for the life of me see any harm. Can anyone argue with a straight face that Morris Fuller Benton was motivated in part by the fact that, after 70 years, ATF&#39;s assets would end up in the hands of some lawyer or other, and that copyright law would force people to pay for the privilege of reproducing his specimen pages, or more likely that legal fears would suppress that altogether? <BR> <BR>I like the kind of ethical solution that&#39;s been adopted by the fansub community &#40;fans of Japanese anime who release English subtitled versions on the Internet&#41;. Their ethical code calls for <i>not</i> distributing any series which is licensed in English-speaking countries. However, before a series is licensed, it is considered fair game, even though technically illegal. This helps anime producers in all sorts of ways, basically doing market testing for free, and increasing the interest in general. One could make the theoretical argument that free fansubs compete against DVD purchases, but the incredible growth of popular interest in anime belies that.  <BR> <BR>The fansub ethical code works especially well, I think, because of the consensus in the community that it is fair and just. You&#39;ll experience warm, friendly help if you&#39;re trying to acquire ethical fansubs, but if you&#39;re a scammer trying to make money off other people&#39;s work, you&#39;re shunned. In the end, everybody benefits, <i>including</i> the Japanese creators of the animes, who of course look the other way even thought their copyrights are being violated. <BR> <BR>I think the typophile community could do a great service by evolving and formulating ethical codes along similar principles. Are we capable?</div>
