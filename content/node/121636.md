body: "I'm new to Robofont and opentype features. This is in fact my first foray in
  producing a font. I've got a base character set and and alternate characters for
  many of them. \r\n\r\nAt the moment I am using stylistic alternates, but am finding
  that when I try to use the font in Illustrator or InDesign I change a character
  to it's alternate and all the following characters I type are also alternates when
  applicable. This doesn't happen all the time, only at certain times.\r\n\r\nTried
  using feature ss01 and ss02 to define the .salt1's and .salt2's but I got the same
  issue regardless.\r\n\r\nAny advice on how to properly code multiple alternate characters
  and not have them replace base characters when typing would be appreciated. \r\n\r\nThanks\r\n\r\n\r\nCODE:\r\n\r\nfeature
  aalt{\r\nfeature salt;\r\nfeature liga;\r\n} aalt;\r\n\r\nfeature salt { # my Stylistic
  Alternates\r\n\t\tsub a from [a.salt];\r\n\t\tsub A from [A.salt];\r\n\t\tsub three
  from [three.salt];\r\n\t\tsub four from [four.salt];\r\n\t\tsub five from [five.salt];\r\n\t\tsub

  body: I think the problem here is your apps rather than the font. In Illustrator
    when you select a .salt glyph while typing it switches the "salt" feature on from
    that point on unless you flip it back immediately. I find that kind of behavior
    annoying, but that's how it's set up. So I always recommend setting all of your
    text first. That will put in ligatures and contextual alternates by default unless
    you deselect those features. Then afterwards you can either switch on salt or
    any other available feature to the whole thing, or use the glyph palette to change
    individual letters. I don't use InDesign all that much, but I suspect it has similar
    behavior with stylistic sets.
