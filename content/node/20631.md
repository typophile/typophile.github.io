body: "Hi all,\r\n\r\nI am a designer working on a poster for an in-house program
  that's promoting employees to take alternative transportation to work. The program
  is new so there are no set standards on style except I must use Trade Gothic Bold
  Condensed as one of my main fonts since it appears in their logo.\r\n\r\nI am looking
  for a good, complimentary font to Trade Gothic. I had initially assumed I'd be using
  this additional font for the text, but I'm open to the idea of using it as a headline
  instead if it fits the bill.\r\n\r\nThanks to all ahead of time!"

    It's a nice deep family and sans seems suitable for transportation guidelines.\r\n\r\nRIGHT
    ON for public transportation. No need for those Hummers clogging the roads."

  body: "Dolly was my first instinct aswell when I heard the\r\ncombination of 'straight-laced'
    but 'fun'. Also look at \r\nPlantin Schoolbook. I think it was Stephen Coles who
    \r\nposted it in a another post the other day, and I now \r\nabsolutely love that
    face. It's another serif that has a 'fun', \r\nslightly quirky feel to it with
    its single story 'a' and 'g'.  \r\n\r\nOn a side not, do people think Dolly is
    going to become\r\none of those overused, see it anywhere and everywhere\r\ntypefaces?
    I really like it, but it almost seems like it is\r\nbecoming the default typeface
    for 'fun' serifs. \r\n\r\nPhil"

  body: "Rotis. I've been told, is a good companion to trade gothic, although it depends
    on your design. consider trade gothic as the text, hence a neo-gothic/grotesk
    for copy then decide what best compliments a grotesk for a headline. \r\n\r\n1)
    The obvious choice is a renaissane / roman, hence grotesks are a roman -sans with
    the same qualities., but would using a classic roman be justified in your poster
    theme? does it suit the style? probably not.\r\n\r\n2) then, try viewing all the
    fonts from the same type designer that created trade gothic, sometimes, like adrian
    frutiger, they suit each other well, ex: meridian/apollo go well with univers/frutiger.
    since the original designer of trade gothic used early grotesks as a base, you
    might have to dwelve deeper.\r\n\r\n3) Create a headline that suits the theme
    more than the copy. a font that conveys \"transportation\"... a few that come
    to mind are \" interstate for the U.S. and Frutiger for Europe (france). "
