		<div class="commentbody">When I worked at HTF, we would receive submissions from designers who have already blown out their typeface into sixteen weights, complete with italics. And we would look at these and see (I should say, Jonathan would see) some basic letterform design issues in the core weight. At that late stage, to suggest a revision would demand design changes to several dozen fonts, and the work that would entail would seem prohibitive. <BR> <BR>So I'm with Ed Benguiat on this one.</div>

In fact, I just send the a basic character set (suh panels done for Morisawa, it was in 1990). But this was before I start to design with computers. They don't have done any comments, I just decided how many weights, etc. <BR> <BR>Then, i submited Anisette to FB circa 1995/96, there, they asked for hamburgefonstiv and some others trials if you have, such weights, etc. <BR> <BR>Then, they reviewed it and ask for corrections, etc. <BR> <BR>Now, its my own boss who decide if he accept my designs, generally he is quite cool with me and we have same feelings on letterforms. <BR> <BR></div>

		<div class="commentbody">This is truly a powerful thread. I'm like Randy, very new to the game. It would be nice to see this info compiled into a handy PDF document for people like us to use as research. <BR> <BR>I believe the best answer I've recieved so far from anyone is this. Don't sell your first fonts, hand them out for free. By doing this you will get a lot more people downloading your font. By doing this you will find out if your font is truly perfect. Are all the contours closed? Are there kerning pairs that you didn't account for? Guaranteed that someone in the world will find something wrong. You also can get a name for yourself and start to generate a little traffic through your web site. Develop a fan base of sorts. <BR> <BR>Anyways, that's my two cents. I'd like to think that some of my early fonts could start generating cash, but I have a long road ahead of me (much like any starting typographer). If you look at type web sites almost everyone has a free font for download. Chank told me this once: All my free fonts are either very old fonts, or fonts I don't wish to continue on creating glyphs. I think that's a good piece of advice. Get as many of these buggers under your arms. Once you decide your path then take the good ones from the bad ones. <BR> <BR>Did I go too far off the original subject? <BR> <BR>t1m</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Tim, I would have to, by instinct, disagree with you on a couple of things.  <BR> <BR>First, I would not want to use my market to test my designs. They should ( my designs ) be perfected before they are released. It would seem an unfortunate situation that the first impression of your foundry or type face would be riddled with issues. I would give your market more credit. The name you get for yourself might not be good with incomplete efforts. <BR> <BR>Second,  &quot;Get as many of these buggers under your arms.&quot;.  I would rather have one design of top quality than ten of half of the first. In other words, quality not quantity. I believe Bringhurst could be referenced for a much more eloquent version of this statement. As a painter, I totally agree with Picasso</div>

Fog can do interpolation, but it seems FontLab's is better, not least because you can <i>extrapolate</i> too, and can often interpolate adequately between totally different fonts! <BR> <BR>* You can also create lighter/darker weights from a single font, but that's not interpolation, and it generally requires a lot of clean-up, as well as adjustments (like making the thins thinner/thicker). <BR> <BR>hhp <BR></div>
