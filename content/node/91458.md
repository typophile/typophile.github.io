  body: "Hi Danny,\r\n\r\n\"LOLITA\" must be <strong>[[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/roswell-itc/roswell-four-itc/|ITC
    Roswell Four]]</strong>\r\nmaybe a bit artificially heavier?\r\n\r\n\"NABOKOV\"
    is a bit small for a definite id...\r\nThere are 2 fonts matching, but they are
    both offered \r\nby the well known font-forgery companies Brendel & Novel:\r\n<strong>Quinta</strong>
    by Brendel Informatik GmbH\r\n<strong>Immediate</strong> by NovelFonts\r\n\r\nthere
    is also a free font that looks similar, but I doubt that the original printer
    has used this:\r\n<strong>[[http://www.dafont.com/reservoirgrunge.font?text=VLADIMIR+NABOKOV|Reservoir
    Grunge]]</strong> by ZetaFonts\r\n\r\nFivos\r\n\r\nPS: I really love Nabokov's
    Novels :)\r\n\r\n-----------------------------------------------\r\nI found them
    using Find my Font - http://www.findmyfont.com"
