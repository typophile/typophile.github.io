    perhaps sahara bodoni but not too sure.\r\n\r\nBobby "

  body: "Actually, the first one seems to be inspired by a typical cyrillic ornamental
    style called Vyaz.\r\nYou can find some interesting links starting here:\r\nhttp://typophile.com/node/59857\r\n\r\nThe
    second one seems a hybrid between a didone and a tuscan style of script.\r\nThe
    only tuscan of cyrillic origin I could find is this:\r\nhttp://new.myfonts.com/fonts/nicksfonts/rutin-tutin-nf/\r\nIt's
    latin only, but maybe you can contact fellow typophile Nick Shinn that could point
    you in the right direction:\r\nhttp://typophile.com/user/2021/contact"
