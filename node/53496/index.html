  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>And you can&rsquo;t tell me that this book sucks.</p>
<p><img src="/images/old-images/Finn_5953.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>This is a book I read for my Modern Anti-hero in Film and Fiction. It fills in the backstory on Twain&rsquo;s Huckleberry with the sordid tale of his father, the titular Finn.</p>
<p>This picture looks a little greener than the copy I have in my hand, but I think it&rsquo;s a beautiful cover. It&rsquo;s dark, isolated and weathered. Coincidentally, Clinch&rsquo;s Finn is, too.</p>
<p>I won&rsquo;t give anything away, but the book starts out with Finn cooking his wife&rsquo;s flesh and feeding it (her?) to his only friend, a blind man who sells him moonshine. I lied, he&rsquo;s not cooking his wife&rsquo;s flesh. He&rsquo;s burning it, and his friend smells it and demands some. And it&rsquo;s not his wife, but his wife who he was never allowed to wed because of their differing races. The Finn on the cover is listlessly floundering in his boat, just like Finn in the book does, both literally and metaphorically, on water and through his life.</p>
<p>Ahhh, metaphors for human futility. He can row, row, row his boat all he wants, but he&rsquo;s not gonna land anywhere comfortable. The ornaments are vaguely gothic, which pleases me, and complements the rugged atmosphere of the rest of the cover. Finn isn&rsquo;t successful when he tries to fit convention of beautiful life&hellip; but the cover does assimilate and is a pretty accurate representation of the content.</p>
