  body: "This may be a bitmap font, and you should search those if this is exactly
    what you need. Among regular digital fonts, the closest I saw was [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/parachute/pf-square-sans-pro/|PF
    Square Sans]], and then Font Bureau's [[http://new.myfonts.com/fonts/fontbureau/stainless/|Stainless]].
    The odd feature is the 'k' and neither of these has the exact same proportions,
    but they are closer than most other squarish sans faces I looked at, which had
    different style k's. Square Sans also has a similar M to your sample, where the
    crotch doesn't reach the baseline.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
