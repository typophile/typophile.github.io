<div class="post-content e-content" itemprop=articleBody>Hi anyone!
I was wondering if there would be someone willing to discuss with me about some details in Jensons typeface. I mean how, for example, the zones could be interpretated where curves are attached to the stems and so on.
I have the maybe strange idea that they weren’t attached in the way we are used to today.
I attach two of my digital Jensons letters – versions of the a (its only a fast study not meant to be finished well) – to explain what I mean. I say the first one obviously is more timelike, contemporary. The second one I made with tiny curves that define those detail zones as far as I believe they were because of the engraving technique. Yet, it’s only how I presume that they could be. Someone may say, no, its all because of the spreading ink, but I do believe that they had sort of these tiny triangles. Also they enhance the effect of a calligraphic ribbon that folds out of the stems. I like those ideas.
Does anyone share these ideas or is it complete nonsense?
I have the theory that this way to do forms could help the forms in text to be less striking, less irritating for the strong seperation between straight lines and curves is much less pronounced.

<div class=commentbody>Well, it depends. I suppose using counterpunches for counters could give you reasonably sharp inside corners. On the other hand, absolute sharpness would have got lost in the inkspread anyway, wouldn't it? If you are interested in those aspects, have you read Smeijers' enlightening book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Counterpunch-sixteenth-century-designing-typefaces/dp/0907259065/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1/103-7356566-3927867?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1186825014&sr=8-1">Counterpunch</a>?
And if you enjoy softened lines (I do, and also think they contribute to readability), you might like <a href=http://www.lazydogs.de/fabiol>Fabiol</a> (not that it doesn't have any sharp turns in counters). Some time ago I tried starting a thread to hear what other people think about it, but it was stillborn.

<div class=commentbody>Hi,
oh yes I bought Smeijers book a long time ago. Very interesting book I found.
Yet, I didn’t agree with the theory of counterpunches at least not within characters like Jensons.
There are evidences that - for example in his beautiful ‘g’ (at least in some of his prints - not all fonts were the same he used) - that also the inner forms contain of Jensons genious formed curves that weren’t round but had sharp angles were nobody would expect them! For example in the ‘g’ there is in fact a almost straight litte line on the inside nearby the stroke that finishes the letter on the right on the outside. There comes through his instinct that a form like this (the stroke on the right) would tear also the inner form towards the outside a little. There had to be signs of turns for the calligraphic laws behind it.
And above all those details are in great balance with the rest of the letter so that the calligraphically moved lines form almost perfect circles in the whole like in the ‘g’.
So for me it seems almost impossibile to think this (the inner form) through before making the whole form. He was a genious but I think he worked by instinct. Counterpunches would have been damaging to this kind of working I believe.
Nevertheless I believe that part of Jensons real look came from designs more like in the ‘a’ above on the right. If you would interpret the whole font as on the left side it would become more like a typical digital face somehow stretchy and soft in a negative way.

<div class=commentbody>Hi again,
yes I looked at Fabiol. It is nice.
Yet, for me arises the questions:
If we make so beautiful inspired intentionally “irregular” forms why is the attachment of curves and straight lines then so rational so if only a Computer would have done it in this way. Don’t know if I explain me right.
I think it was one of Jensons strenghts that it distributed those details equally over the whole form. Isn’t it so?
Yet, I didn’t see an orignal punch or letter either so all this is pure speculation.
Yet, I think Adobes Jensons for example does not look like Jenson. That’s the point.
And why doesn’t it? That’s the question to ask.
