  body: '''Screen purposes'' encompasses a lot of different technologies: CRT screens,
    LCD screens, TV screens and computer monitors, b/w vs. greyscale or colour, etc.
    Type for screen is typically optimised for particular technology. Can you be more
    specific in your inquiry?'

  body: "I make grayscale pixelfonts. Basically because I think they deliver the most
    readable onscreen type (in the sizes currently most useful). I think gs pixelfonts
    are even better than ClearType (which suffers from three flaws) except maybe in
    Italics.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
