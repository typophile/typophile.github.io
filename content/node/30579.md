  Macs. I work from a dependable g5 desktop and just purchased a new macbook pro laptop.
  Aside from transferring my activation back and forth every morning before I go to
  work, CS2 is perhaps the most unstable program I have ever used when running on
  the Macbook pro. Illustrator crashes every 20 minutes or so, and dont every try
  to use the pathfinder toolbar. . . bad juju. InDesign crashes on certain saves,
  and when page counts exceed 50 or so. \r\n\r\nI cant live with out these programs,
  as im sure many of you others out there cant. I would expect a little more support
  from Adobe for these issues. Some sort of a fix seems almost necessary. \r\n\r\nAnyone
  else having as much trouble as I am?\r\n\r\nIs Rosetta a program running behind
  the scenes on the Macbook Pros that allows the older programs to be compatible (barely)
  with the newer OS. \r\n\r\nAdobe claims CS3 will be ready in Spring and that Leopard
  could also be a fix. But I have no idea on that release date. \r\n\r\nAnyone who

  body: I'm sorry you're having trouble with the new computer. One reason I changed
    to a newer Power PC Mac last summer was that it was about the last chance to buy
    a new Mac without intel. I still need Freehand sometimes, and it doesn't work
    on the intel Macs, so I had no choice. Hope the CS3 solves your problems.

    see Illustrator CS2 crash because I decided to use the pathfinder. Any program
    is highly unstable, and when you have a big job / file, it will simply freeze
    or crash. Even if you aren't doing anything, just letting Photoshop CS2 sit idle,
    it will crash, sooner or later. It's abysmal.\r\n\r\nI am in love with the CS3
    beta, but I really, \u2014really\u2014 hope they speed the release of the complete
    Creative Suite 3, which is slated for Spring this year."

    It's easy to blame the third party developers because it seems to be their applications
    that are causing the problems, when really a lot of blame can go to Apple. Although
    I'm a Mac user, Apple seems to move too quickly without giving their developers
    enough time to catch up with their changes. The same sort of thing happened when
    they introduced OS X a few years back. If the keep doing it, it'll bite them in
    the a$$ eventually.\r\n\r\nSpeaking of the Wii, Nintendo had a similar problem
    back in the day when they decided to stick with a cartridge based system instead
    of compact discs. They lost a lot of their 3rd party developers and went from
    number one, to now trying to catch up to Sony and Microsoft for market share.
    A hardware change is a big deal to developers. Apple needs to start paying attention
    to this because people using Adobe products is major factor driving Mac purchases. "

  body: OS X was a different matter. By the time that all new Macs came with OS X
    installed, Adobe's apps were OS X-friendly. In the end, progress is a choice.
    You could still use OS9, but who has really tried OS X and wants to go back? Nobody
    I know.

    not own an Intel-Mac ( yet ) and I am not using Adobe software - apart from the
    old PhotoShop Elements 2 ( because I need some PhotoShop- only plugins every now
    and then ) and Acrobat Reader , I think this issue is indeed to blame on Adobe
    rather than Apple...\r\nI am a heavy 3d- software user and my main 3d app. - Maxon
    Cinema 4d - was among the very first applications to have a Universal binary version
    since January 30, 2006.\r\nOthers were soon to follow and even software from very
    small developers was soon updated - like Graphic Converter to name one.\r\nAs
    - IMHO - 3d software is not less complex than PhotoShop or Illustrator,  I think
    Adobe played \" the tough guy \" here and showed they were BIG enough to withstand
    all this... Pity. They shouldn' t have left their enormous userbase in the cold

  body: "The crashyness of the programs I use has varied over the years.\r\nSince
    OS X, I have generally had fewer crashes and freezes, and the beautiful thing
    is it's just the program that crashes, not the entire computer. And the program
    reboots real quick.\r\nSo sure, you might lose some work if you haven't been saving
    (but many programs have auto backup facility). If you know the prog is a bit dodgy,
    you will be careful with saves.\r\n\r\nThe worst ever was the version of Quark
    that crashed when you moved the cursor a little above the menu bar. I had huge
    horror stories with the introduction of both System 7 and the Power Macs. Getting
    used to OS X wasn't easy, but it had so many new features which made up for the
    problems. Apple going Intel has beeen relatively smooth, for me. \r\n\r\nI'm running
    CS on an Intel Mac, and it's slower than on the G4 I was using, but streaming
    content on the Internet is brilliant. I knew CS would be slower, but it was time
    for a new computer.\r\n\r\nYou can't expect Adobe and Apple to sync their product
    releases, so I don't think there is any blame here. And the upgrades come fairly
    frequently, so just sit tight for CS3 which will be Intel-native, ennit? \r\n\r\nI
    hope that was some consolation James."

    quite wrong there; just because Cinema 4D has limited functionality that makes
    it easy to port doesn't mean that the same applies to any other software, note
    the continued absence of universal binaries for Maya and Lightwave. \r\n\r\nSome
    of the Adobe apps really were to complicated to be compiled with XCode when Apple
    when to x86, which is the big reason for Adobe not rereleasing CS2 for X86. Adobe
    lays it all out <a href=\"http://blogs.adobe.com/scottbyer/2006/03/macintosh_and_t.html\">here</a>."

  body: I can chime in here... Because of a rapid growth situation in my art department,
    we've been forced to purchase several new macs. We've added intel iMacs, Macbook
    Pro's, and most recently, a few Mac Pro's. The major kicker with CS2 really seems
    to be RAM. With the first round of laptops and imacs, we didn't max the RAM out,
    and can't run illustrator and photoshop both without one crashing the other. Today
    is my 3rd day of working on a new Mac Pro Quad 2.66, upgraded to 4GB RAM. It's
    a compltetely different story. Some things seem to be even faster than my dual
    2.0 G5 2 GB RAM. The iMac is much better off with a RAM upgrade as well. It also
    seems like rosetta (no matter the mac) runs best if it's been restarted from time
    to time. The PS CS3 beta has been too buggy for me to continue with, and i'm happy
    so far with CS2 under rosetta. If you're stuck working with an intel mac at this
    point...shove as much RAM as you can in the thing and plug away until "second
    quarter 2007".
