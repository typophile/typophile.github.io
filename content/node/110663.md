body: "Hi, \r\nsince Bohemian Coding discontinued their App Fontcase and it kept crashing(their
  new App Fonts really doesn\u2019t fit me needs), I finally decided to switch to
  Font Explorer Pro 4 Mac in hope of long term use and less performance struggles.
  \r\n\r\nFirst I was a bit overwhelmed of the structure and usability compared to
  Fontcase. I hat to discover very early that neither merging fonts nor renaming/correcting
  a font\u2019s info isn\u2019t possible, which makes organizing your Library not
  essentially easier. \r\n\r\nIn Fontcase I\u2019ve developed a method which was pretty
  handy to find and sort fonts very easily (I guess I\u2019m not the only one in doing
  so). \r\nI had very general Genres like Serif, Sans and Script and the tags defined
  their attributes like text, Swiss, Dutch, geometrical, rounded and so on.\r\nVia
  Smart Collections it was very easy and fast to find a specific range of Fonts by
  sorting by specific Genre and Tag. \r\n\r\nSince Fontcas kept crashing while generating
  a Smart List I decided to change to FXP. In FXP there is the function to classify
  your fonts (tip: cmd+t works for multiple fonts, the first time I opened the software
  I thought I had to go through each individual font file) by the given Linotype Tags,
  which feel a bit strange for me, or even your own. \r\nI thought of Themes as Tags
  and Categories as Genres as they were in Fontcase and maybe Usage for foundry since
  it isn\u2019t possible to rename it in the file and they are not very consistent
  even if a font is from the same company. \r\n\r\nAfter tagging some of my fonts
  I wanted to try a Smart List and I encountered a huge problem to my method. It is
  impossible to set a specific category/usage/theme as a parameter for your list.
  It is only possible to mark Linotype\u2019s Tags or your own ones in hole. \r\nSo
  the parameter for for category would be Serif, Sans and Script at the same time
  and this is very unhelpful for sorting fonts effectively. \r\n\r\nI\u2019ve been
  searching the internet for some time now to find a solution. The only thing in the
  manual is this sentence: \x1E\u201CClassifications can be viewed in the font list
  and the small information panel and you can also create Smart Sets based on classifications\u201D\r\n\r\nWriting
  comments seems not like a solution to me, because there isn\u2019t a way to edit
  multiple Fonts at once. \r\n\r\nAm I using the software wrong, did I miss anything?
  Or am I not the only one struggling with this problem. \r\n\r\nThanks for your help
  and time, \r\nJannick"
