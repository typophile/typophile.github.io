  of font editor software! And i need your help!\r\n\r\nI'm would like to hear which
  software for fontdesign is your number one choice? Fontlab, Glyphs, other? (and
  maybe why?)\r\nDoes the company behind the software, and its appearence on the market
  matter to you?\r\n\r\nGreetings from Denmark, and thank you so much for you time!"

  body: "There are several other font editors out there. Some are not advanced enough
    for professional type designers, which seems to be the main audience here.\r\n\r\nHere
    are a few others you might want to include:\r\nDTL Font Tools - http://www.fontmaster.nl\r\nFontCreator
    - http://www.high-logic.com/font-editor/fontcreator.html\r\nFontForge - http://fontforge.github.io\r\nFontographer
    - http://www.fontlab.com/font-editor/fontographer/\r\nType - http://www.cr8software.net\r\n\r\nI
    think most font designers use more than one font editor, along with other font
    related utilities. Also be aware not all editors are available on all platforms.
    Glyphs is only available for Mac while FontCreator runs on Windows.\r\n\r\nNote:
    I'm the main developer of FontCreator, so I can't tell you which font editor I
    prefer ;-)"

    7, 8, 9 it is THE font editor to choose.
