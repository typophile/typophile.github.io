body: "I'd like to announce a new AND VERY BETA feature on Typophile we're calling
  \"marks.\"\r\n\r\nWe've heard a lot of requests for this one. This new feature will
  allow you to mark content that you're interested in following in real-time. Think
  of it as a Typophile-specific bookmarking system. \r\n\r\nTypophile Marks are for
  signed-in users only. Once you're signed in, you'll see a few small changes to the
  Typophile UI. First, at the top-right of forum topics and blog posts, you'll see
  a little bookmark icon. Click the icon to mark that thread.\r\n\r\nUnder \"My account\"
  you'll see a new item called \"My marks\" - This does exactly what you'd expect
  - It returns a list of the content that you've marked. You can also access it directly
  at http://typophile.com/mymarks.\r\n\r\nTo remove a mark, look for the \"Reset my
  vote\" link at the bottom of the topic's initial post. (Disregard any mention of
  \"votes\" you may come across - we're chasing them down and replacing them with
  \"marks\" but there are dozens of files to crawl through.)\r\n\r\nAgain, this is
  very BETA but would love to get feedback on how it's helping you keep track of those
  threads that you're following but have not yet participated in.\r\n\r\n//jared\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    hasn't got anything to say about, but finds the subject interesting.

  body: "Awesome!\r\n\r\nA few quick thoughts / questions:\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>I'm
    presuming the \"My marks\" list will show whenever there has been new activity
    on each thread, \xE0 la the Track page?</li>\r\n<li>Instead of having a \"reset
    your vote\" link or something similar, it would be more elegant if you could just
    click the icon again to un-mark it.</li>\r\n<li>I might personally use a different
    term than \"marks\" \u2013 something more like \"watch\" or \"follow\", maybe?
    \"Marking\" reminds me more of something static which is intended for future reference
    (i.e. bookmarks) \u2013 a slightly different concept from what you've described
    in your own words as something that you're \"following\" or \"keeping track of\".</li>\r\n<li>As
    with the Track page, this feature would be exponentially more awesome with its
    own RSS feed. Get me that and I'll be a happy camper! :)</li>\r\n</ol>"

    be ideal. \r\n\r\n@Nick: Agreed, the goal is to have the icon act as a toggle
    on/off, and I'm hoping to allow \"unmarking\" from your marks list.\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Hooray!\r\n\r\nStill, there needs to be an added line for emphasis other
    than &lt;strong&gt; inside blockquotes in the stylesheet. Something like <code>blockquote
    em { font-style: normal; }</code>. Or, you could remove the italicization and
    lessen the padding a bit on the left, and give it a background which repeats vertically
    that makes the blockquotes look like this:\r\n\r\n> this\r\n> is a\r\n> quote\r\n\r\nMarks
    are definitely an extremely good feature! Keep 'em!\r\n\r\nAlso I agree that both
    the tracker and \"My Marks\" pages would greatly benefit from their own RSS feeds."
