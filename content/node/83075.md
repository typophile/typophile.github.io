body: "Hello all! :D I wasn't quite sure where to post this, so I just decided I would
  put it in the general area. I'm not a type designer, but one who's getting involved
  in the Print/Web side of things. I adore type, and I feel it's the most important
  part of design, so I'm trying to get as educated as I can about it. \r\n\r\nMy question
  is this: is there a specific term for the italics that seem to be more, I don't
  know, rounded or flowy? It's hard to explain, so I'll use pictures:\r\n\r\n<img

  here's a few other examples of what I'm attempting to explain:\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://i392.photobucket.com/albums/pp6/CanwllCorfe/3e41a2973f4c30c147241b990c4001-1.gif\">\r\n\r\n<img

  help would be appreciated! :D "

    abrupt (emphasize the end of the stroke).\r\nThe serifs on the italic are unilateral,
    adnate (lead into the next stroke)."

  body: I think "cursive" is a(nother) good term. There are also upright italics with
    similar traits of handwritten forms.

  body: "Another relevant concept: folded.\r\nThis term was used by Stanley Hess in
    <em>The Modification of Letterforms</em> to describe the way in which the curved
    stems of letters may be configured\u2014for instance, the c and s in Frutiger
    are unfolded, but the grotesque c and s of Helvetica have folded forms.\r\nThese
    cursive terminals/serifs or entry/exit strokes are folded back against the letter.\r\n\r\nJoshua,
    how can they be adnate if they're not connected?\r\nAdnate means \"growing from\",
    i.e. a bracketed serif or an old-style triangular terminal may be considered adnate,
    growing from the stem, as opposite to a slab-like didone serif or a ball terminal,
    which appear attached."

    my first design courses we were talking about type, and I had mentioned that they
    were both so gorgeous. A little bit afterwards one of the kids in my class had
    said that he thought "all serif fonts are ugly". Yeah, I had a pretty good laugh. '

    cursive lowercase aren\u2019t necessarily swash, are they? I\u2019m not talking
    about the decoration, but rather the underlying structure. See Underware\u2019s
    Auto Italic 2 for an interesting example."

    \"cursive\" capitals are almost always swash alternates.\r\nI was responding to
    your comment about uppercase being oblique.\r\nLucian Bernhard was the rare designer
    who combined a non-script, cursive lower case italic with cursive capitals.\r\nAnother

  body: "> Joshua, how can they be adnate if they're not connected?\r\n> Adnate means
    \"growing from\"\r\n\r\nThat's how. They \"grow from\" the previous stroke, in
    the way that they would if the stroke and serif were made in one stroke of the
    pen, whereas to produce \"roman\" style serifs with a pen requires drawing the
    serif as a separate stroke or doubling back. Thus, \"roman\" serifs do not \"grow
    from\" the attached stroke in a natural way.\r\n\r\nThey are adnate with respect
    to the letterform they are attached to, not the following one, though they do
    suggest a link to the next letter."

  body: "However since type is never handwritten, the better way to use \"adnate\"
    is based purely on how the outline segments relate. So Times (I mean the upright
    style) for example has fully adnate serifs; Calluna's serifs are adnate on the
    left, and abrupt on the right.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"
