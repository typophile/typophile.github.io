  body: "Thought I could find a match with a [[http://4frenz.com/the-chivalric-romance|better
    sample]] but unfortunately not all :D\r\nBest chance is probably directly asking
    [[http://dribbble.com/shots/1440807-Recent-work-Pt-6|Jorgen Grotdal]] and if he
    tends to answer, drop the solution here as well. For the rest, I'd be not surprised
    and even if the repeating letters look identical, it could be all hand-drawn.
    Anyway, some alternatives for each lettering.\r\nCHIVALRIC ROMANCE: [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/pintassilgo/populaire|Populaire]],
    [[http://www.fontsquirrel.com/fonts/yanone-kaffeesatz|Kaffeesatz]]\r\n20/DENMARK/12/CUSTOM
    INTERIOR: possibly [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/latinotype/trend|Trend Ltt]]
    or <strong>[[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/latinotype/trend-hand-made|Trend Hand
    Made]]</strong> (using the alternate /[[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/latinotype/trend-hand-made/sans-one/glyphs.html#glyphs/576744/213|R]])\r\n\r\nEDIT:
    finally found the match for 'CHIVALRIC ROMANCE', that's <strong>[[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/kimmy/lunch-box|Lunch
    Box]]</strong>."
