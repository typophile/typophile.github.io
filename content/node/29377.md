body: 'i am currently designing my CV to send off to employers for a work placement
  (graphic design) but i want it to be creative and spark some humour into it because
  thats who i am but im having difficulties with ideas. I was going to do one online
  but aswell as that, i want to do one taht i can send off to them and add a little
  extra item thast creative and that they can have in their office. what could that
  item/object be? i was once sent a cd like cover that popped up and became a little
  box to put your cds in and was jsut kept intackt with 2 elastic bands inside that
  allowed it to become an actual cube. i''d like something creative and unusual. any
  ideas welcome. '

    a book all about this kind of thing. Plenty of examples of clever foldy stuff
    for promotional use, and even has a cd with eps templates. Could be just the ticket
    if you can get hold of a copy. '

  body: 'any other ideas for creative cv''s? what do designers like to be sent? what
    do they like to receive in creative froms? something useful taht they can use
    for the office or something creative that forms into something useful? i opt for
    the 2nd one but what could it possibly be? '

  body: "Here in Washington it's customary to have a plain resume and customize the
    design/text appropriate to the employer. A really wild design that might get you
    a job at a three-person design firm could end up right in the trash if it goes
    to the HR department of a big-firm looking for in-house people. Having something
    simple can also make it easier for you to use it for digital submission.\r\n\r\nConsider
    producing a really good-looking promotional piece that showcases your work and
    include a well-typeset traditional resume along with it. This way you get to show
    off your creative ability without having to worry about offending people who don't
    like creative resumes."

  body: "I would be very careful with the idea of trying to \"add a little extra item
    thast creative and that they can have in their office.\" You would have to do
    something very, very clever to be able to pull this off. Otherwise it will be
    another really lame attempt. I got an 'interview' once for a senior position (I
    was a junior) only because I had used Quadraat on my well-typeset CV. I didn't
    get the job, but I got to spend 1 1/2 hours with a senior designer, talking about
    all sorts of things. Now that design firm is a client of mine for type-specific
    work. Funny how these things work out.\r\n\r\n\u2014K\r\n"

  body: I remember my tutor saying that extravagant cv formats and ideas were soooooo
    last summer  and that we should keep it clean and sober and blah blah blah but
    the same year some guy in our course sent a cv that was identical to a parking
    ticket (the English one, yellow and black) and put in on the car's windshield
    of the "employer". He did get the job and the whole story was also published on
    the local newspaper.

    body: i guess what lore said makes sense but it probably wont work all the time
      i guess. depends how much humour the employer got. he could either love it or
      hate it all together.

    ones. And if I had a creative resume idea as good as that one, I'd definitely
    go for it. Hell, if the parking tickets here weren't the size of baseball cards
    and run off on thermal printers, I'd steal that idea in a heartbeat."

    about potential employers (this is useful when you have the classic interview
    question, \"why did you approach this agency?\"), if the Creative Director has
    a birthday soon, for example, you could create a cv around a birthday card or

    they gave were shocking. One guy just sent them a paragraph which was poorly printed
    and fuzzy with lines across it becoz the ink must've been runnin out.\r\n\r\nsomeone
    said that somebody sent a cast of their foot which said on it \"well now that
    ive got my foot in the door.......\"  Got him an interview.  \r\n\r\nanother person
    said that they were required to send of three examples of their skills but the
    employers could only see two.  They called the guy up and he said \"look a the
    envelope.\"  \r\n when they looked at it, he had hand-drawn the stamp and fooled
    everyone.  even the royal mail.   got him a job."
