  body: Either can work. It's all about balance (does something on the other spread
    counteract the white space?) and consistency (do you treat other story ends in
    the same way?).

  body: yep, either is ok... or you might try a more organic layout, where the text
    follows a curve, so ends a bit higher on the first one, similar height on the
    second, and so on...

  body: That rule at the bottom of the second page of the spread doesn't serve any
    useful design purpose. If it's to indicate the end of a chapter, that's already
    obvious from the fact that the text doesn't fill the page. It is especially unnecessary
    if you choose the column alignment where the left column goes to the bottom of
    the page. But unless you plan to have a rule at the bottom of all pages, I would
    eliminate it in either alignment scenario.

  body: "Thank you for the answers!\r\n\r\nAbout that rule at the bottom: it is a
    footnote, this made me think about a second question. Do you think extending it
    under both columns is a good idea or should I leave it only under the column it
    is referencing? (in this case balancing columns would be silly imo)"

  body: If you're gonna rag the layout, you can use the "hang from the washing line"
    concept -- rag bottom, so that all elements snap to the w-line, but hang by varying
    amounts.

  body: I tend to follow what Nick is suggesting. Or at least what I'm reading into
    it. I always protect against widows and orphans. It is, for me, more important
    that a thought begins and ends cohesively than the bottom of the page always align.
    I tend to like a little vertical rag, it helps add variety too.
