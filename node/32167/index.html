<div class="post-content e-content" itemprop=articleBody>Lately, I've been designing forms (diagnosis, patient information, surveys, etc.) for the healthcare industry. I would like to start purchasing fonts (complete families in both serif and sans) that would be well suited for this kind of work. As you can imagine, they must be able to read well at small sizes and multi language support. Any suggestions would be helpfull.

Are these PDF files simply to print and fill out by hand or are they meant to be filled out online? If the latter, then converting text to outlines means there is no text anymore, so the PDF becomes fairly inaccessible to those that need to use assitive technologies.
That said, if these are to be filled out online, I would suggest skipping PDF and making true HTML based web forms.</div>

<div class=commentbody><cite>...I would suggest skipping PDF and making true HTML based web forms.</cite>
That's good advice, Darrel. The forms would be easier to create in HTML and you'll have a lot more freedom for any additional features outside to a few check boxes and text input fields. It they're able to access PDF's online they'll be able to access a web page. If you do use PDFs, I'd refrain from making them interactive. The process is time consuming and sometimes it's just plain frustrating. Consider them a print and fill solution only. </div>

<div class=commentbody>I would definitely seek fonts that allow embedding into a PDF. There are enough really big libraries available that do, so you won't be shorting yourself in ignoring the ones that have restrictive licenses.
As for font types, look for sans serifs, which work well at small sizes. A large x-height is also useful. Look for those fonts with Bell in the name ... they were designed for the phone books, and as such work well in small sizes.</div>

For print and to be filled out by hand. I would just like to supply them with a "master file" so they won't have to come to me when needing additional copies. So you mean I can't sent them a PDF meant for print only with everything outlined even if it's just for print? Does the file have to be embedded?

<div class=commentbody>You can outline your text in a PDF. I think the suggestions were made, if the end-user was going search for specific text or copy/edit the text from the PDF. Outlining the text removes any properties associated with the text and makes it a static image. Fine, if your end-user is only printing these out and manually filling them in. </div>

That's my point I want to use a fon't that hasn't been used heavily. I like Freight Sans but I'm afraid it's lack of a condensed version will somewhat limit me.

There's a red flag. Why wouldn't you want to use something that works well, just because others have used it? Don't think that a designers job is to make things that are unique ... it is to make things that are usable. A form is a case where utilitarianism is probably the key requirement of a job. If you want to put your personal stamp on the project, then do so in the header and other elements of the form.
Keep the body of the form (labels, etc.) as clear and simple as possible. Your clients will love it if your work minimizes mistakes and omissions, and will completely ignore whether it looks unique.
One thing, while Freight Sans does look nice don't try to physically compress it ... this usually spoils the readability of a font.
And don't reject Helvetica Condensed because "real designers don't use Helvetica." It is Helvetica that is over used, not Helvetica Condensed.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Myriad is a large family that could work well on forms and has the added advantage of being offered by Adobe licensed for editable embedding, leaving you with the widest of options.
If embedding permissions _are_ important to you, have a look at <a href=http://www.adobe.com/type/browser/legal/embeddingeula.html>this</a> Adobe table.
There shouldn't be any need to resort to converting text to outlines for this sort of thing: you lose so much convenience. </div>

<div class=commentbody>I would look at faces that stand up well to poor printing and photocopying. If they are pdfs, they will inevitably be printed out on a lo-res laser printer at some point. And forms will almost certainly be photocopied. I would also look at faces with distinct numerals. I would suggest Officina (sans or serif), Meta, or maybe FF Strada (which according to the fontfont blurb is intended for forms). They are robust enough to stand up to abuse. I would steer clear of any width of Helvetica, because at small sizes, poorly reproduced, the numerals can look very similar (3=8=9 etc) which is tiresome. </div>

<div class=card-body>
<div class=commentbody>At this point Helvetica and Univers condensed are not appropriate choices because their usefulness for forms has been superseded by a host of new designs that are easier to read in the same settings, and as a side benefit, are probably more economical. Choosing them now means that you have them sitting around, and it's easy because we're all used to seeing them on forms and we don't question that. Being habituated to their use doesn't make them the best choice.
Freight is terrific but probably wrong for forms. The whole slew of vaguely-humanist, somewhat condensed info sans designs would be easy to mine for something appropriate. Consider Amplitude, Fago, Page Sans & Serif, Strada Condensed, Zwo, Slate Condensed, the Mentor family (serif and sans), Zemestro, etc. Lots of new options including superfamilies, width variants, and finely-tuned weights. </div>

The only red flag here my friend is your assuption that I would somehow trade usability over uniqueness.
<em>One thing, while Freight Sans does look nice don’t try to physically compress it … this usually spoils the readability of a font.</em>
That's Typography 101. Don't remember saying I would compress it. Just that I'm displeased that no condensed version is currently available.
<em>And don’t reject Helvetica Condensed because “real designers don’t use Helvetica.” It is Helvetica that is over used, not Helvetica Condensed.</em>
Helvetica is one of my favorite faces and it's usefullness and versatility are undisputed. But we can all agree it's a bit over used (both regular and condensed). Any serious designer, who can afford it ofcourse, should have a copy of it's complete family in there type arsenal (I know I do). I always consider appropriateness and usability in my designs. Then, and only then, do I consider personal taste.
Helvetica isn't the only choice out there as you have probably noticed from the input of others in this topic. But, if in the end I find Helvetica to be the correct choice then I'll use it.
"real designers don’t use Helvetica” there u go assuming again.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Mark, there are a couple of very cogent reasons why Gill Sans has gone unmentioned on this thread until now. For all that you might like it, it's simply not a good choice for form work.
Carls observation that Helvetica and Univers Condensed are simply what we are habituated to is a good one – it contradicts my earlier post and rightly so. There are many, much better, vaguely humanist, highly legible sans serif designs to be had nowadays. Gill Sans isn't one of them.</div>
