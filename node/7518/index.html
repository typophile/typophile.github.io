I found the website while looking up info on Caxton (yeah it's what I do in my spare time.) Some of the books look really great, especially since I live in Chicago. Hmm. also.. anyone going to the AIGA Seek conference this weekend? <BR> <BR><a href="http://www.caxtonclub.org" target="_blank"><a href="http://www.caxtonclub.org">http://www.caxtonclub.org</a></a></div>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Hi -</p>
<p>As it happens, I just found Typophile by having a Google alert
for Caxton &ndash; so I&rsquo;ll be exploring THIS site.  (As a Caxtonian,
I spend some of my spare time looking for Caxton citations on the Internet).</p>
<p>The Caxton Club includes a wide range of folks interested in the history of printing, and so includes everyone from small press publishers and designers to collectors, scholars, and other lovers of the printed page. (The club also has members of the Manuscript Society; lovers, I suppose, of the scribbled page). In addition to our two meetings a month, the club publishes a monthly journal, both in hard copy and on our website. The Caxton Club is not formally affiliated with the Newberry Library, but several Caxtonians are Newberry staff members and we have a small administrative office in their premises.</p>
<p>Last Wednesday we had a special meeting at the University of Chicago. One of our members, Kim Coventry, curated the current exhibit at the Regenstein Library drawn from the R.R. Donnelley archives. The exhibit might be characterized as the history of printing in the US as viewed through the history of the Donnelley company.  On November 15th our monthly dinner meeting (the third Wednesday) will hear a talk by Joseph Parisi, former editor of Poetry Magazine, on the subject of the 100 modern poems one might take to a desert island.</p>
<p>We hold an annual symposium in the spring. In April 2006, the subject was the history of copyright; the subject in 2007 will be translation.</p>
<p>As for this organization&rsquo;s interest, our preferred font is a Zipf, and the typophilic in the club with whom I&rsquo;m most acquainted is Hayward Blake &ndash; one of our distingished members.</p>
<p>If anyone has other questions or would like to attend a meeting, let me know.</p>
