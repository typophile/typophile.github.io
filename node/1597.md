body: Hello, <BR>Im hoping someone could help me. <BR>I have an ibook with system
  9 &amp; 10. <BR>I have upgraded alot of programs and now my ATM does not seem to
  be compatible because whilst it opens on system 9 my new programs such as indesign
  open on system 10. Is there anyway I can fix this so what fonts i turn on or off
  will work with the programs that open in system 10 or do i have to get ATM deluxe
  for system 10? <BR> <BR>Thanks in advance, <BR>David.

  body: ATM Deluxe is simply not available for OS X. If you are needing a font management
    utility for use under OS X, you will have to have to purchase Extensis SuitCase,
    MasterJuggler, or FontAgent Pro from Insider Software. Or else wait under later
    this month and upgrade to OS X 10.3 &#40;Panther&#41; and use Apple&#39;s own
    Font Book.

    to OS 10. anything.

  body: '&#62; <i>And get rid of OS 9, its so poor compared to OS 10</i> <BR> <BR>More
    stable? Yes. Better memory management? Yes. Faster? Most application processes
    - yes. Finder actions, file management, application launching - decidedly no.
    <BR> <BR>Although Panther has improved many of the Finder and file management-related
    issues I had with Jaguar, I miss using 9pt Geneva in my list views, among other
    aesthetic bits. <BR> <BR>And you&#39;ll have to pry my Classic-running Claris
    Emailer from my cold dead hands... <BR> <BR>Oh, and for those who have yet to
    switch to FontLab from Fontographer - the point is mootish. <BR> <BR>Back to the
    subject of this thread: even with Font Book and the recent revisions to SuitCase
    and the other font management utilities, there is no way in heck that OS X even
    comes close to OS 9 for handling large libraries of typefaces. Font/DA Mover feels
    more advanced at times.'

  body: Grant, Font Agent Pro truly is comparable to ATM Deluxe -- and this is coming
    from someone who really mourned the loss of ATMD and cursed the available options
    for many months. In fact, Font Agent Pro has some niceties that ATMD didn&#39;t.
    <BR> <BR>Agree about some of the Finder functions, though. It pisses me off that
    I can&#39;t navigate Open/Save dialogues by keyboard as easily as I could in OS
    9. Grrrrr.

  body: Meredith, I&#39;ll agree that FAP is the least crappy of the bunch, and does
    offer some nice controls over font libraries - but my main peeve is that it is
    still less than stable when handling over a couple hundred suitcases full of fonts.
    Our creative team at <a href="http://www.veer.com/">Veer</a> uses FAP, and it
    works for the most part - but it&#39;s no ATMD.

  body: Interesting that Veer uses FAP -- good choice. Do y&#39;all have any trouble
    with running Photoshop while FAP is running, or is it just me? <BR> <BR>I&#39;ll
    admit, I was &#40;and remain&#41; mystified by Adobe&#39;s decision to dump ATMD.
    Why, why, why?  <BR> <BR>Thomas? <BR>

    OSX.

    capabilities remains.

  body: No trouble specific to Photoshop, just general sporadic FAP crashing while
    browsing faces or freezing when adding voluminous amounts of new fonts. Again,
    it&#39;s one of those software stability issues I have with OS X. Sure, it doesn&#39;t
    being the whole system down a la OS 9, but why are these programs crashing in
    the first place? Keep in mind that we are juggling 13 medium to large type libraries
    at Veer, with a total font count of well over 5,000. That does not include system
    fonts. Quiet frankly, I don&#39;t think any of the OS X-based solutions are ever
    tested with that many resources.

  body: I&#39;ve tried them all and to me MasterJuggler comes closest to the ATM DeLux
    feel. No auto-activation &#40;like DeLuxe&#41; but with full UniCode support.
    &#40;unlike DeLuxe&#41;. <BR> <BR>Also like DeLuxe, MJ does not have to be running
    to keep fonts activated. <BR> <BR>So having found MJ I have stopped looking for
    a font management utility. <BR> <BR>I used to be a fan of FAP, but with lots of
    fonts installed it did strange things like refusing to activate the roman weight
    of a font family. FAP is also a bear in the startup, and the shutdown taking minutes
    to completely boot or quit.
