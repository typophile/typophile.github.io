  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>One of the problems with designing a typeface is getting feedback. Most designers work in a vacuum and that&rsquo;s why a forum like this is so useful. 
I have started looking very critically at my half finished type projects and decided that my passion for Dutch typefaces could provide enough impetus to design a really nice text face.</p>
<p>So I looked at a lot of the typefaces I really like such as Lexicon, Van den Keere, Swift, and Lectura. I started drawing without referring to any of these in particular and tried to make the characters as quiet as possible. I&rsquo;m looking at a useful typeface for extended reading.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a first jpeg of work to date and i would really appreciate any comments. <img src="/images/old-images/amarach_1_5905.jpg" alt=""></p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I too am a big fan of the Dutch style typefaces. Your sketch definitely has a nice character to it. I find it a bit too sketchy at this point to really go into too many detail, but a few things you could look at:</p>
<p>Mind the contrast (thick/thin), some letters are quite heavy compared to others (i.e. bottom of d/e are heavy compared to the c and b).</p>
<p>The o looks a bit like a rotated transitional o, instead of a humanistic o. Perhaps you could draw a few o&rsquo;s with a broad nibbed pen or broad felt tip (or tape two pens to each other!), to see how you can get that interesting humanistic relation between the inner shape and the outer shape. Some other characters might benefit from this too.</p>
<p>I find the s to be out of place; it doesn&rsquo;t really fit with the typeface (it is also too light), perhaps it&rsquo;s not humanistic enough. I.e. look at the terminals of the c and a, they are more brushy, while the s is very angular with its serifs. Speaking about the a; the top terminal looks a bit too light.</p>
<p>The bottom of the t looks a little bit wobbly. The g looks more French-ish to me than Dutch.</p>
<p>I also think what I said about the s could be applied to the capitals, they look a bit too rigid, especially because of the terminals and serifs. You know, the lowercase looks broad-nib/brushed, while the capitals look like they&rsquo;re chiseled.</p>

		<div class="commentbody">fantastic feedback: one of the things i did was to use sharp unbracketed foot serifs while the head serifs have a bracket. I will try some brackets on the capitals E F L etc so the contrast is not so abrupt, Yes the s, always a problem, if I increase the weight it seems too dense. The o was drawn completely in Fontographer so it looks a little transitional – I will have a look again But thanks again for taking the time to comment</div>

<p>Well, I think a typeface like this would really benefit from actually writing some of the letters with a broad nibbed pen or two regular pens taped to each other, so that you start to really understand how the tool has (historically) influenced the contrast and the relation between the inner and outer shapes.</p>
<p>As for the o; it&rsquo;s probably mostly that the contrast is wrong compared to the other characters. The axis of the contrast is something like 30 degrees, but with the o it isn&rsquo;t. In other words, the thickest parts of the o should be at the 2 and 8 o-clock positions, approximately. Just like the thickest part of the b is at 2 o-clock and on the d at 8 o-clock.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>This is gorgeous.  And unlike a lot of new designs out there, I think it really does have its own personality, its own reason for being.  Very strong and elegant.  Favorite glyphs: R, a, h, m, n, r, s.  And those tilted squarish tittles on i and j are killer.  You can&rsquo;t tell from a large-scale showing like this, but it looks like it might make a really readable face.  Mazel tov!</p>
<p>That said, I do agree there&rsquo;s work to do.  For one thing, I just can&rsquo;t get comfortable with a mix of bracketed and unbracketed serifs.  I know rules were made to be broken, but it seems self-conscious to me.  I&rsquo;d bracket them all, if I were you.</p>
<p>The upper case and the lower don&rsquo;t quite marry for me yet.  For one thing, the upper case seems lighter.  The stems on the upper case should be a bit thicker than those on lc characters, since they need to be proportional to characters that are bigger overall.  The curved strokes need to be heavier still; the fattest part of C should be much thicker than the fattest part of I.  The diagonal legs of R and K seem too light to me.  (So does the diagonal leg of the k.)  And the feel of the whole upper case strikes me as more delicate, lapidary, and van Krimpen-ish than the lower, which has a vigor that reminds me of Lexicon.  Maybe you could try beefing up the upper case and bracketing the serifs, and see where that gets you?</p>
<p>The u and t seem a bit heavy at the bottom, and the crossbar of the t seems short on the left side.</p>
<p>The top of that wonderful R seems a bit fragile; the big counter looks like it&rsquo;s ready to burst through it.</p>
<p>There are a few places where the transitions from thick to thin stroke seems too abrupt; the eye of the e, the o, and the lower bowl of the g.</p>
<p>But this is a terrifically strong start.  I&rsquo;m jealous, and I&rsquo;d love to see where it goes next.</p>

The cap R is a result of the way I do a calligraphic R. I tried it on my other post on Typophile (Erato) but it  wasn&rsquo;t successful</p>
<p>1996type: when you say ALL my curves are a bit clumsy I&rsquo;m a bit concerned. Looking at C and D for example C looks good
while D not quite lowercase g is a bit wonky as is u and the arm of lowercase k. If i really can&rsquo;t see where curves are bad I am as I say a tad concerned that I lack the necessary skills to see this through.
I will make the suggested ammendments and post a revised image soon. Maybe a pdf is better</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Much stronger. I think this is really pulling together and shaping up as a useful and distinguished face. Big improvements to c, r, and t.  The R&rsquo;s both gorgeous and sturdy now, and fitting in nicely. I&rsquo;m still not convinced by the g or the o, though; the g looks a bit heavy and as if it&rsquo;s tipping backward to the left, and the o seems light and just not, I dunno, organic. And I prefer the previous tittles; the very slight rounding of two opposite corners just looks tentative and unfinished to me. I miss the old Palatino-ish broad s, but the new one will probably read better.  Though I do think it&rsquo;s got kind of a bump on the bottom of the spine, toward the upper left corner. And could the crossbar of the e be a tad light? But overall this looks tremendous to me, and I think it&rsquo;s getting to where it should be reviewed in text sizes in running text before a lot of further revision is done.</p>

		<div class="commentbody">I really like this design. Some quick, candid thoughts: &lsquo;C&rsquo; slightly too wide? &lsquo;F&rsquo; looks wider than &lsquo;E&rsquo;, should look narrower. I&rsquo;d widen &lsquo;E&rsquo; a bit. Arm serifs on both look more prominent than their other serifs. &lsquo;K&rsquo; diagonal is too fat. &lsquo;a&rsquo; looks a little unbalanced to me. &lsquo;g&rsquo; beak should be better friends with &lsquo;i&rsquo;, &lsquo;n&rsquo;, &rsquo;m', &lsquo;r&rsquo; serifs. Also, &lsquo;g&rsquo; is too fat above its waistline. Try to rethink that glyph, I&rsquo;d suggest. Tittles look crisper than the rest of the glyphs, I&rsquo;d dullen them somewhat. &rsquo;s' a little to narrow for my taste, but it works as it is. Some serious issues with its curves, though. It looks like you use too many points. Use as few as possible, and mind your extremas. There are similar issues with other curves too. Get rid of all the uneccessary points, and this will be good.</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Your text sample certainly highlights some problems, Gary, but I also think it&rsquo;s showing a whole lot of promise.  The paragraph already has a very pleasing look to me; firm, bookish, and distinctive without being eccentric or distracting.</p>
<p>Maybe you should refine the letterspacing in your trial font before you go too far redrawing your glyphs?  I agree that the color is blotchy now, but a lot of those dark spots certainly come from too-tight and too-loose letter combos.  The left sidebearing of the a seems pretty narrow, for one thing, and the i&rsquo;s seem unmoored.</p>
<p>I agree that your g needs rethinking.  It&rsquo;s very dark now, with a very strong horizontal stress; the gg in your sample really jumps out.  And I find it just less handsome than most of your lowercase letters.</p>
<p>I think the widths of s &amp; e are spot on, and that the a balances beautifully; I&rsquo;d hate to see you mess with it too much.  But, yeah, those tittles look a little out of place now.  Maybe save the tilted squares for another face, and use some sort of rounded shape here?</p>
<p>This is a pretty substantial face now, in my view.  Are you sure you want to make it darker still?</p>
<p>I like the name.  But then, I&rsquo;m writing this from Dublin, where I&rsquo;m visiting my in-laws.  I agree that the name suggests something a bit more Gaelic than this.</p>

In particular, I think you should strengthen the links/necks (see the image attached). I&rsquo;m not enthusiast over the squared dots, but it&rsquo;s an original design choice. That said, it&rsquo;s a very interesting typeface and I hope you can get to a fully working version.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Lexicon&rsquo; also has very thin junctions. My newspaper (NRC next) uses Lexicon those thin junctions work perfectly fine IMO. In fact, they help to make the text look crisper and more vivid, without being distracting.</p>
<p>The g really seems to be too quirky compared to the rest. Try to base it slightly more on the g in lexicon, which has that crispness to it.</p>
<p>I think it will help the comfort of reading if you let the joints in /n/ (and alikes) and /p/ (and alikes) meet the stem at the same height.</p>
<p>Your thin points in /o/ should be the same thickness as the bottom of the bowl in b.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s a bit too early to move on to bolder/lighter weights, but it&rsquo;s your choice.</p>
<p>Keep going!</p>
<p>btw: There are still some quirky curves, but this isn&rsquo;t much of an issue at text size, so you might as well just ignore them.</p>

<p>True. But when I look at <a href="http://www.teff.nl/fonts/lexicon/pdf/lexicon_a3_print-600.pdf">Lexicon&rsquo;s pdf text setting</a>, the balance between the thick and thin serif looks quite right, while Gary&rsquo;s typeface pdf example gave the impression of lacking strenght in those linkings. Also, Lexicon was originally conceived and 
<a href="http://dpc.uba.uva.nl/inventarissen/ubainv57">drawned</a> for small size text settings, so I guess every devices has been carefully taken by de Does for achieving the right balance.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;d also like to draw your attention to Hendrik Weber&rsquo;s Lirico from Ourtype, where the junctions have been tapered down to literally nothing: there are tiny gaps between the stems and the arches.  And the result looks lovely and reads just fine:</p>

<p>The &ldquo;g&rdquo; is especially striking. When I first looked at it I didn&rsquo;t like it, but then I realized it&rsquo;s quite a mature and functional shape - in a way innovative even. I would however make the ear stronger (not least by raising it above the x-line).</p>
