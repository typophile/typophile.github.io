body: "Hi, <BR> <BR>Archura: arched textura. <BR> <BR>I started off the design of
  my first typeface with a post to Typophile &#40;<a href=\"http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/4100/29010.html\"
  target=\"_blank\">http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/4100/29010.html</a>&#41;,
  and so I thought I would submit the final design as well. Archura is the result
  of my typeface design class with Cyrus Highsmith at the Rhode Island School of Design.

  <BR> <BR>The most controversial aspect so far has been the spacing. This PDF shows
  a \xB115 tracking variation. <BR> <BR><!--attachment: archura-spacing-37681.pdf*mime_pdf.gif*application/pdf*638.4**archura%2dspacing%2epdf

  <BR> <BR>Thanks in advance for any feedback, and for being part of my project. Typophile
  has been a terrific resource."

  body: First of all, this is a display face. The one readability advantage that blackletter
    has &#40;structural divergence&#41; you&#39;ve done away with - &#34;romanized&#34;
    it most certainly is&#42;, and that pushes it &#40;even more&#41; towards display
    usage. And then the super-tight spacing&#42;&#42; reinforces that even more. But
    as a display face I think it&#39;s worthwhile, with a definite &#34;brush&#34;
    character. Perfect for a German deli! <BR> <BR>&#42; BTW, when you say that in
    text it looks like a &#34;cold romanized textura&#34;, while in display its rationalization
    brings warmth, it seems to me that it would be the opposite, since it&#39;s in
    smaller sizes that things get fuzzy and more open to organic interpretation, especially
    when it comes to texture. <BR> <BR>&#42;&#42; It&#39;s so tight that it&#39;s
    causing some intractable problems, like in &#34;ft&#34;. BTW, even the &#43;15
    setting is too tight I think. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>

  body: What about some additional variation in the caps. More different widths maybe.
    Or altered strokes. The X seems like a great candidate. When you have all caps
    they go utterly grey. The lowercase does not - it is suprisingly readable!
