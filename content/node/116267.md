  body: "With an ultra simplified design like this and only 8 letters of the alphabet,
    I can see this as being a case of independent development of a similar alphabet
    in 1986 or earlier [for the album cover] and in 2004 [as Why Square]. Among the
    differences in the two sets of 8 letters, I note that 1986 has shorter ascenders,
    the lower terminals on _e_ and _s_ of 1986 are double the length of 2004, the
    1986 _a_ upper stroke includes a vertical drop terminal ....\r\nDon"
