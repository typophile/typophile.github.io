body: "hello,\r\n\r\ni am looking for a typeface that is very impactful. a typeface
  that says 'boom' that is bold and heavy. i do not care if it is serif or sans serif...
  perhaps something similar to the kinds of 'branding' stamps that cows get. perhaps
  something close to Impact but a bit more interesting. i would appreciate it if someone
  can give me some suggestions. thanks in adavance :)\r\n\r\n(if possible, the family
  should have small caps)"

    it's going to be used for high-impact display type, do you really need small caps? "

  body: "cool, thanks so much! i really like knockout and titling gothic fb.\r\nthese
    will definitly work for me. giza is really nice too, but i feel its overly stylized
    for what im looking for. do you have any more suggestions inline with or more
    similar to knockout and titling gothic (my concern with the titling font is that
    the J's look too much like backward L's)."
