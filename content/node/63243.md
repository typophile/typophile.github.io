  Typophile interprets that as http://typophile.com/www.example.tld - which produces
  an error.\r\n\r\nI just corrected my entry adding \"http://\", and , lo, now it
  works. \r\nSince I saw that problem in quite a few of your user profiles I thought
  it worth mentioning.\r\n\r\nHAND,\r\nAndreas"

    of the problem.
