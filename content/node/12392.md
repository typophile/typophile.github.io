  being built on the coast of Dubai. As you can see, some of the floating islands
  are in the shape of Arabic text, making up what must surely be the largest piece
  of lettering in the world.\r\n\r\n"

    a typophile).\r\n\r\nAccording to <a href=\"http://www.thepalm.co.ae/\"> the palm's
    website </a> the \"elevated retreat homes linked by boardwalks\" spell out a passage
    from a verse by H.H. Sheikh Mohammed bin Rachid Al Maktoum, \"Take wisdom from
    the wise -- not everyone who rides a horse is a jockey.\"\r\n\r\nHelpful, if you
    thought all horse riders were jockies."

    be self-supporting, a 360\xBA arch perhaps.\r\n\r\nThe structure on what is now
    termed the Greenwich Peninsula (I'll have to check this) is more of a tent in
    my opinion. Admittedly an impressive tent, but not a dome."
