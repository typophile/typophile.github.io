  body: For a beginner I think this is ok. Not a great cost for the stuff, and the
    Adana Press is, I think, still available. I think this depends on what you want
    to do. When I was printing I used a Vandercook SP15 Press and printed books and
    brochures, and used monotype. I was self-taught which meant that I made a lot
    of mistakes. But I learned a lot. This is a picture of the press I used.[img:sites/default/files/old-images/SP15_5985.jpg]

    you could start setting type and banging impressions in no time at all. A composing
    stick would be nice though.\r\n\r\nWhen I gotten my 5x8 Kelsey, four years ago,
    it came with a similar assortment of fonts, leads and spaces, except everything
    was simply pied (dumped) into an old cardboard box filled with dead roaches and
    mice droppings. Still, a little cleanup, a few weeks of organizing sorts (letters),
    and I had my first run.\r\n_____________________________________________\r\nPersonal

  body: "Adana is very limited, but for a Newbee a great choice to get an idea what
    letterpress is.\r\n\r\nPlease do not buy the stuff on Ebay, you our link is showing.
    Its not expensive, but its only junk, what someone found anywhere.\r\n\r\nWrite
    an email to geoff.kennett(at)ntlworld.com. He's a very close letterpress friend
    of mine. Tell him, I send you and he will give you some advices. May be he can
    offer you some stuff. Better one than the Ebay stuff, for a fair price.\r\n\r\nThis
    is real letterpress :-)\r\nwww.Bleisetzer.de\r\n\r\nHave fun with your Adana...\r\n\r\n\r\nGeorg\r\n_______________________________________________\r\n\u201EIch
