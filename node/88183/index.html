  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Hi,

I've been working on a Hebrew companion for Neuton...

<img src="http://21326.info/work/test-8dec2011.png">

Any critique would be helpful... Looking at it now, I'm think the Hebrew might be a little too condensed, or at the very least my spacing is too tight. (Which is at least part of it.) Some of the thins also might be too thin also. I'll have to work on that. Anything else appreciated!</div>

		<div class="commentbody">FYI, I'm not an expert in Hebrew, but I have done a lot
of multi-script type design. I agree that the Hebrew is
too tight. But I'm happy to see you're paying attention
to the relationship between the two scripts in terms of
vertical proportions. However the Latin caps are too tall
compared to the ascenders; and the ascenders are too short
compared to the descenders. So I would make the ascenders
at least as tall as the caps. Also, again as you suspect, the
Hebrew has more contrast than the Latin; I would try to
make the thins less thin. Lastly, the "w" is too narrow.

Thanks. I knew I had problems with it. The shin seems to have been my hardest glyph, overall. I've been having trouble with it the entire time. I went through several phases of my Hebrew design, and haven't ever been happy with.

Hrant: Thanks! :-)</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Unfortunately  I don't have a lot of time, so I'll be short & simple...

1. I think that the main issue is the proportion (and the optical iIllusion); e.g. the kof vs. lamed ; the he vs. dalet -- the dalet looks too wide.

2. The yod, or the lower part is too short! see for example the work by Zvi Narkis -- Narkisim.

3. The shin is not just too small/condensed -- as Bill said --  but also too symmetrical; moreover, compare your shin, ayin, tzadi to Hadasa.

		<div class="commentbody">Hi Brian,
  Your Hebrew looks good alongside Neuton. However the Latin font is so much more dominating. This is a problem with most Hebrew fonts - those Romans were very much into domination!
What's to do? Maybe the serifs on the Hebrew could have fewer curves. Look how cleanly 'chiseled' are the upper serifs in Neuton. The serifs in the Hebrew look as if they were done with a brush or quill but the Neuton serifs were hammered into stone.

You might study the shin in other fonts. Nueton is a STRONG font with no nonsense and you need a strong shin to go with it. If it's going to lean, it should lean like someone striding (from right to left) with a heavy backpack.

The vertical of the bet has bend and might be better straight.

Mike
