  /img>\r\n\r\nUnivers was designed by [[Adrian Frutiger]] in 1956 and released by
  the Deberny & Peignot type foundry in 1957. It is a neo-grotesque sans serif; it
  features optically even stroke weights and a large x-height to improve legibility.
  It\u2019s become known for the variety of weights and set-widths included in the
  family. At the time it was designed it included 21 variations, and was the first
  type family to implement a numbering system as opposed to using names. Today there
  are over 27 different variations of Univers available. Univers is an extremely diverse
  typeface that has the ability to work very well at large display sizes for applications
  such as headlines and mastheads as well as in small sizes for body copy.\r\n\r\nDuring
  the 1990s, Adrian Frutiger worked together with [[Linotype]] to expand his classic
  Univers family. The result, [[Linotype Univers]], includes 63 different weights,
  each drawn carefully to ensure compatibility with all the others.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.linotype.com/1560/univers-family.html\">The
