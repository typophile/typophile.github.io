		<div class="commentbody">I use suitcase on a PC &#40;bleh&#41; and it&#39;s kind of buggy.  Usually it gets the job done, but don&#39;t spend too much time creating font lists and categorizing fonts in Suitcase as inevitably your list will get corrupt and you&#39;ll have to redo all the work over again.  It&#39;s a common problem according to Extensis, I found after my first tech support call.  So now I keep the fonts themselves in categorized folders and try to let the software do little more than turn fonts on and off. <BR> <BR>I&#39;m sure it works flawlessly on a Mac though. <BR> <BR>How is Reserve superior to Suitcase?</div>

The main difference with Suitcase is that it&#39;s visibly running, and the browser and the activator are the same application. It&#39;s only really annoying when you, like a friend of mine, are unable to get Suitcase to quit when you shut down the machine or log out. <BR> <BR>James, why do you like MasterJuggler? WAY back when it was my favorite font manager &#40;we&#39;re talking 1990 here&#41;, and I was intrigued to see that it was brought back from the grave, but it&#39;s been frustratingly difficult to dig up information on it.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I have tried all of the font managers for OSX and decided MasterJuggler was it.  <BR> <BR>MJ works very much like the old ATM Deluxe. You activate and deactivate fonts from anywhere on your system. It does not copy or create a database, it just turns on and off fonts. You can create sets, you can browse the various Unicode ranges, and you don&#39;t have to keep it running in the background all the time. <BR> <BR>There is no auto-activation, but I was told by Altsys theat that was something they were going to include in a future version. <BR> <BR>Unfortunately they don&#39;t offer a downloadable trial version. <BR> <BR>But they did have me listed as a registered user from back in the System 7 days, and they gave me the upgrade price.</div>

I&#39;d previously purchased and struggled through using Juggler and Suitcase.  <BR> <BR>When Adobe stopped supporting ATM I switched to Font Reserve.  It worked fine but after Extensis purchased the software it apparently wasn&#39;t supported as it should have been. I had problems with it after upgrading my Mac operating system to Panther. Customer support was excellent but in the end they couldn&#39;t resolve the problem. <BR> <BR>I switched to FontAgent Pro a couple of months ago and it&#39;s running well.
