  is a small business with big ideas formed in January 1995 to create fonts for other
  like-minded designers. 2Rebels offer a variety of typefaces ranging from the traditional
  to the experimental. Going beyond the classical, their approach is at times subversive,
  transforming the normal and accepted into innovative and personal font-images. 2Rebels
  in its own way hopes to contribute to the on-going revolution in typography and
  invites others to do the same. Right now is the biggest typeface foundry in Canada,
  and probably the most renowned.\r\n\r\n2Rebels features typefaces by:\r\n[[Annie
  Bastien]]\r\n[[Robert Beck]]\r\n[[Christian B\xE9langer]]\r\n[[David Boon]]\r\n[[\xC9ric
  de Berranger]]\r\n[[Marc Borgers]]\r\n[[Christine C\xF4t\xE9]]\r\n[[Denis Dulude]]\r\n\r\n2Rebels
  fonts are available through [[FontShop]].\r\n...\r\n"
