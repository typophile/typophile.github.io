  body: I&#39;m sorry Mar, but we don&#39;t do that around here.  <BR>You&#39;ll have
    to follow the rules and <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/itc-slimbach/"
    target="_blank"> buy a license</a> like  <BR>everyone else. Why is it that ITC
    Slimbach Medium <BR>suddenly is so popular? Second request today.

    &#34;A&#34; to tranform for a secondary backgrond, only that... <BR> <BR>But I
    agree with you, if I need it for a commercial or advertising work I&#39;ll buy
    a license really. <BR> <BR>In any case Yves, thank you very much by your answer.
