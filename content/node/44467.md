body: "This week has proved a typographic adventure. After designing the <a href=http://typophile.com/node/44259>Yale
  typeface article</a>, I had the opportunity to work on the <em><a href=http://www.yaledailynews.com/>Yale
  Daily News</a></em>' arts and living section, \u201Cscene.\u201D My colleague, Greta
  Carlson, and I designed the cover, which is traditionally highly-themed, after <a
  href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jost_Amman>Jost Amman</a>\u2019s \u201CDer Bierbreuwer\u201D
  in <em>Das St\xE4ndebuch</em>. Below I\u2019ve attached the cover and jump page
  for the article <a href=http://www.yaledailynews.com/articles/view/24529>(about
  student beer brewing at Yale)</a>, along with a close-up of the cover. \r\n\r\nThe
  type used is <a href=http://kltf.de/kltf_litteratra.htm>Litteratra Basic</a> for
  the headlines, subheads, and page 1 text; <a href=http://p22.com/lanston/goudytext.html>LTC
  Goudy Text Lombardic Caps</a> for the initials; and a slightly bigger size of our
  standard text type, <a href=http://fontbureau.com/fonts/MillerDaily>Miller Daily
  Grade 3</a>, for the jump's text. \r\n\r\nAs with the Yale typeface article thread,
  criticism is welcome, though naught can be altered now. Two problems I see are that
  the first initial \u201CS\u201D should have been nudged up a tad, and the justification
  is a bit wonky (owing to my turning off hyphenation because of the problems test
  readers had with Litteratra\u2019s hyphen).\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/0418_b1_5118.jpg]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/0418_b4_3800.jpg]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/0418_b1_Crop_6222.jpg]"

  body: "Nice spread of matching illustration and text. I like the colors used. The
    designer of Litteratra, Karsten Luecke will be pleased with this use of his beautiful
    font. He is a member of Typophile where he is known as k.l.\r\n\r\nIn the Middle
    Ages I was art editor of my university newspaper and have fond memories of clunky
    Linotype machines casting hot lead lines of letterpress that are then set into
    a matrix, inked and a paper proof made. If one of us hardworking students finds
    a mistake that line is tossed back into the machine, melted and cast again. The
    illustrations were made by another process whereby an acid bath eats away portions
    of a photographically-exposed zinc plate leaving the lines or screen dots that
    will be printed. No hissing sounds or acrid smell of hot lead as we now move mouse
    on mousepad, is there!? Great!"

  body: "Thanks for the responses. Thomas, you know I didn't even consider whether
    the Lombardic Caps were sympathetic; my logic was pretty much \"a fraktur book
    needs illuminated versals.\" But now that you mention it, they are maybe a bit
    too finely drawn for the page. If only I had bought Litteratra Complete I could
    have used the titling alternates ...\r\n\r\nVladimir, I was aware that Karsten
    Luecke is a fellow typophile. I may e-mail  him about this, too. And I have actually
    done a bit of work with actual metal type, but it was already cast, not Linotype;
    the amount of time involved just to print a paragraph makes me quite thankful
    for InDesign, though the manual method did have its advantages."

  body: I think, you get enough contrast and style, if you use the Litteratra Versals
    for the Initials. No special titling alternates are needed.

  body: If you're referring to just using Litteratra as a basic drop cap, I did try
    that, but the weight increase was so much that they dominated the whole page (it
    is a modern <em>black</em>letter, after all ;-) ). I was referring to the titling
    alternates present in the OpenType Litteratra Complete; I just bought the basic
    version, so I couldn't access what appear to be these lighter, more refined forms
    that might have been ideal.

    agree, Reed, computers make it incredibly easy to see and create good design.
    What in the old days could be only achieved through cumbersome effort that took
    days and weeks is now done in minutes and hours by typing and slight wrist motions.
    The challenge now is to find one's way to what makes the best use of the rich
    embarrasment of choices available to almost anyone. You seem to be fully aware
    of the need of restraint and precision and to keep a critical eye on the work.
    \ I guess nowadays there is the same difference between good and bad design as
    there ever was,  but now there is so much of both!  Sorry I am not expressing
    this very well...keep up the good work."
