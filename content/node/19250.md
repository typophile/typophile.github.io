  say I do admire a good name in a typeface though, since coming up with that perfect
  name can take almost as long as the actual designing of the darn thing! Or maybe
  it's just me.\r\n\r\nAnyway, what's your favorite typeface name?\r\n\r\nMine's \"Bembo\".
  I could walk around and say nothing but Bembo all day, just because it tastes so
  good to say. Bembo. Bembo. Beeemboooo. It's delectable!"

    1495. Wish I could remember the bibliographer's alphanumeric code for it. Doesn't
    exactly roll off of the tongue though. Not exactly junk food in that regard.\r\n\r\nI
    think the \"darn thing\" probably took a great while to cut (design was not a
    consideration). They didn't even bother to name \"letters.\" I doubt they even
    considered there was such a thing as the delectable, unless of course, they were
    thinking of the type of righteous life that would lead to salvation.\r\n"

  body: either you're yanking my chain or you didn't understand what i'm saying at
    all.. i didn't mean that the typeface is junk food, this thread is. naming your
    favorite typeface name isn't exactly high science or deep debate, hence it being
    a sort of "junk food" thread.

    BEMBO (a bakery in Mexico that makes junk food and bread), I think it was probably
    the margaritas that made it funny to me.\r\n\r\n(most people here probably know)
    Storm Type has a CD of fonts with the excellent name of Typophile.\r\n\r\nSomeday
    it'd be fun to partner with one or more designers to have fonts to offer at my
    site, like:\r\nFontPlay Clean (sans)\r\nFontPlay Odd (odd)\r\nFontPlay Nasty (grunge)\r\nFontPlay
    Hand (if my writing were used it would be another grunge font)\r\netc.\r\n\r\nI'm
    not sure about the situation where another company started claiming a trademark
    on something called \"fontplay technology\" after I had been using the name FontPlay
    publicly for about 7 years. If I start doing anything commercial I'll probably
    have to get a lawyer's opinion.\r\n\r\n"
