  clear out some terminology issues.\r\n\r\nIs the word \"typeface\" synonymous to
  the word \"font\"?\r\n\r\nI have heard some people arguing about this matter and
  now I am eager to know the truth.\r\nAlso, some people claim that the word \"typeface\"
  is technically incorrect as it is a legacy from the old typesetting times.\r\n\r\nOpinions
  and knowledge are appreciated.\r\n\r\nRegards.\r\n\r\nP.S. Sorry if this topic has
  been discussed. I couldn't find it on search."

    opinions have nothing to do with the matter, but there has been some corruption
    to the language.\r\n\r\nA typeface is a particular design, with all its attendant
    weight and width variations, plus alternate renderings, such as swashes and small
    caps. A font USED to mean ONE PARTICULAR size, weight, width and variant of one
    particular typeface. A font has COME TO MEAN a computer data file which renders
    a particular weight, width or variant of a typeface which is infinitely scalable.
    Generally, the term font HAS BEEN CORRUPTED to mean what typeface USED to mean.
    However, you are correct about no strict regulation: we have the Thought Police
    working on that..."

    element which tied two letters together, most commonly ct and st; a single cast
    piece of metal type containing the tied letters and the ligature--or simply tied
    letters like ff, fi fl, etc--was called a LOGOTYPE. However, with the passage
    of time and corruption of the language, what was called a logotype is now called
    a ligature, and the meaning of logotype has been reassigned.\r\n\r\nLook up \"trademark\"
    on Wikipedia; the article is clear and concise."

    are wrong about that. I have plenty of books that were written in different periods.
    The thing is that books often contradict one another and I there is no way I can

    don't you think that we all should agree on commonly used terms rather than interpret

  body: "A font USED TO MEAN a certain quantity of molded type slugs that you could
    order from a typefounder; it was usually sold by the number of copies of the lowercase
    \"a\" that it contained. So you could buy a 6-a font or a 20-a font.\r\n\r\nThen,
    this meaning became applied to things like computer files that contained the vectors
    with which to draw the characters of a given typeface, or to the disks or squares
    that contained negative images of the characters for use in a phototypesetter.\r\n\r\nAlong
    the way to being corrupted to be a synonym with \"typeface\", which to computer
    users made a lot of sense, since \"which font are you using\", if uttered with
    the \"old\" meaning of font, also implied the \"corrupt\" meaning... the alternate
    distinction of using font to mean \"this typeface, this weight, this size\", since
    those attributes were tied to a font - at least when made out of lead, if not
    necessarily in the case of a computer file, and usually not in the case of a phototypesetter
    disk.\r\n\r\nBut that meaning of \"font\" <em>loses</em> what is usually regarded
    as the primary element of the font/typeface distinction - a typeface is a style
    of lettering, and a font is the means used to utter characters in that style.\r\n\r\nSo,
    ideally, one would like a more specific word. IBM, when selling typewriters, refered
    to \"typestyle\" instead of \"typeface\", presumably in order to be less pretentious
    - and a single Selectric type element could only handle one weight and size of
    character. So one could use \"typestyle\" as the new, missing word here."
