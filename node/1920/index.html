  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Well, they don&#39;t really. The mention of Garamond is frequent &#40;to put it mildly&#41; but there isn&#39;t a lot of actual endorsement. <BR> <BR>Three threads contained actual endorsements of particular Garamonds: <BR><a href="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/30/11541.html">20 Typefaces to start a designer&#39;s career</a> <BR><a href="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/30/6318.html">If you could only use 5 typefaces</a> <BR>and the even more stringent <BR><a href="http://">Only One Typeface</a> <BR> <BR>The results: <BR> <BR>Stempel Garamond - 3 endorsements <BR>Adobe Gramond - 3 endorsements, 1 mention <BR>Garamond - 2 <BR>Garamond Pro OTF - 1 <BR> <BR>And that includes a single person endorsing both Adobe and Stempel. <BR> <BR>Now this is an afternoon of combing threads &#40;about 20 or so out of 148 of them&#41;, so it looks like I&#39;m at the point of diminishing return. <BR> <BR>I&#39;d like to ask some specific questions and see if we can&#39;t get a better measure. <BR> <BR>Which Garamond <BR>a. Would you buy for your own type library? <BR>b. Would you set a book or long text in? <BR>c. Would you set at display size? <BR> <BR>Be specific. Let &#39;er rip. I&#39;ll tally the results in a few days. <BR> <BR>Jon</div>

		<div class="commentbody">a. Sabon Next. <BR>b. Sabon Next. <BR>c. Sabon Next. <BR> <BR>An alternate choice for the display size would be 1530 Garamond, but it isn&#39;t for sale at the moment. <BR> <BR>Apparently Adobe may yet release Robert Slimbach&#39;s magnum opus Garamond revival, which has been in the works for more than ten years. <BR> <BR>For me, one of the principal criterion in selecting a Garamond would be the italic. I&#39;d want an italic based on Garamond&#39;s not Granjon&#39;s. That said, I&#39;m currently reading a book set in Linotype Granjon, and rather like it.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I was surprised that nobody had mentioned Sabon, Monotype Garamond or Berthold Garamond. <BR> <BR>I&#39;m not surprised that Stempel Garamond rated highly, but I have to say that I&#39;m not overly fond of it. I think it is just too &#34;chiseled&#34; for my taste as to what I want as a book face. There are even more chiseled looking faces that I like plenty, but not for book text. <BR> <BR>I would also note that as a typeface design, Adobe Garamond Pro &#40;OpenType&#41; is essentially the same design as Adobe Garamond. <BR> <BR>Normally I can&#39;t comment on unannounced projects, but Rob&#39;s Garamond revival is one that we have actually previewed in public. I will say that it is his top priority major project. I can&#39;t comment on a timeline, but it&#39;s getting plenty of attention and I don&#39;t expect it to end up on the back burner again. <BR> <BR>a&#41; Since I always have all Adobe typefaces, the one I&#39;d go out and buy would be Sabon Next. <BR> <BR>b &amp; c&#41;  Can&#39;t answer at this time. Would have to do a more careful evaluation of Sabon Next, and will soon be competing with our new project. <BR> <BR>Cheers, <BR> <BR>T</div>

In print, i.e. offset printed at 2400 or 3600 dpi, the regular is not too dark at all; in fact it can be a little light. I still think it is the best Garamond revival. Of course, I have a soft spot for <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/tiro/1530-garamond/">1530 Garamond</a>, but it is probably too authentic for daily use.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">I found strange to decide that a particularly weight of a particularly typeface is too light or too dark after tests on a particular laser printer. <BR> <BR>For example: to my experience, Apple laser printers give very bold type when HP laser printer give the reverse. <BR> <BR>And, specially, when the final output is offset litho, on a particular paper, what you&#39;ve got on a laser printer is irrelevant at all. <BR> <BR>If I comeback to Garamond question, I can say that Adobe Garamond was my prefered Garamond until I discovered that the general effect is too wide and too Italian compared to original French Garamonds &#40;from the various original books I had in hands from Estienne and others at the Imprimerie Nationale&#41;. Then, Stempel one, despite its angular shapes and Berthold Garamond despite not very available today as before, seems booth better. <BR> <BR>&#40;don&#39;t miss Augereau designed couple of years ago, another good one -- but a bit decorative on some forms&#41;. <BR> <BR>I can&#39;t comment on Sabon Next for obvious reasons.</div>

From the &#34;1530&#34; to the Berthold, Stempel, A Garamond, Sabon Next, etc. The result will be appealing to the eyes as old books can be. <BR> <BR>What about a Founders Garamond? &#40;in reference to Founders Caslon&#41;</div>

Stephen suggested that dark type can be a good thing, as demonstrated by Fred Smeijer&#39;s types, but I think there is a difference between type that is intended to be dark and type that just ends up that way because of a printer.</div>
