<p>i need to add some slightly unusual automated interactive features to an open type type face i will be designing as part of my major project at university.. but i dont actually know if its even possible..</p>
<p>would be quite nice to talk to some one who knows what they are talking about</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>oops forgot to mention the actual issue :) :)</p>
<p>I am studying mental disorders as a topic for the design of display typefaces. The disorder that i am onto now is OCD..</p>
<p>I wanna make a type face that strikes through the last word you wrote and writes it just above (kinda as soon as you press the space bar)</p>
<p>in my head it would work like a ligature.. in the sense that it would change to a different image, but then its not possible becausea ligature seems to be a pre determined image.. and i cant predetermine eveyr word in the dictionary&hellip;</p>
<p>so i was wondering if there is a way of making an automated strike through the last word you wrote (without pressing the strike through button - think interactive display of OCD)..</p>
<p>i really hope this makes sense&hellip; i can draw a diagram :) :) :)</p>
<p>thanks anyway!</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I am not sure if I understand what you are asking for. I waited, and no one else has jumped in, so perhaps a clearer explanation would help?</p>
<p>Unfortunately, if I get what you are describing, the answer is probably, &ldquo;no.&rdquo; That sort of event is beyond the intentions of OpenType, as far as I have heard or imagined. However, even as I say that, there <em>might</em> be some way to hack it to do so&hellip;.</p>
<p><strong>If it is even possible</strong> you would likely need some sort of generationg script to create a bruteforst word-string set. Start with a substitution for each character with a struck alternate. Add a condition to apply it when a space appears after 1,2,3,4,5,6&hellip; characters. That would require a contextual rule that can allow wildcards between the character to be subbed, or a script to generate all possible combinations. I think the former is a no-go. The latter is probably the only possible way, and would result in a set of tasks that would likley bog down any OT rendering engine beyond usablity.</p>
<p>When then leads to, what application would you be trying to present this in, that supports OT in the way you want?</p>
<p>You might be best off creating some sort of flash demo with actionscript or a similar lightweight language and presentation app.</p>
<p>Sorry I can&rsquo;t be more definite here. OpenType is a dark and nebulous  art, like immortality or understanding women. ;)</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>lol @ nebulous</p>
<p>yeah , ithought it might be beyond the capabilities of opentype.. i can see it being made in flash.. but i wanted to actually have it as a working indesign ready font.
having just recently discovered the necessity for coding a typeface i was keen to find the potential opentype might have.</p>
<p>Choz. im quite interesed in the latter possibility however like u said it would probably bog down the thing beyond belief&hellip;</p>
<p>might give it a go, see if it works
if not
ah well.. back to the drawing board..</p>
<p>thanks loads</p>

<p>To increase you general pool of knowledge, you might find this guy&rsquo;s work interesting, he&rsquo;s pushing OT as far or farther than anyone else, along those lines:</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Actually, I can easily see how to do this in OpenType. You don&rsquo;t need any dictionaries of words or anything, just a backwards chaining contextual substitution. Same techniques I used to produce some of the fancy effects in the sample contextual code I posted a couple of years ago.</p>
<p>Part of the trick is to use individual letter substitutions rather than any ligature stuff.</p>
<p>One way of doing it would be with some code that in FontLab or the Adobe FDK looks like this:
<code>
feature calt { # Contextual Alternates
sub @reg_let' @reg_let @reg_let @reg_let space by @spec_let
sub @reg_let' @reg_let @reg_let space by @spec_let
sub @reg_let' @reg_let space by @spec_let
sub @reg_let' space by @spec_let
} calt;
</code></p>
<p>Mind you, that&rsquo;s a simplified version which will only work with words up to four letters long, but I&rsquo;m sure you get the idea. You just need to define each of those glyph classes to include the same number of glyphs, and create an entire set of extra &ldquo;special&rdquo; glyphs in the font, where each one has the &ldquo;regular&rdquo; glyph struck through, plus the same glyph without the strike-through raised above it.</p>
<p>Somebody with a bit of Python experience could doubtless automate the creation of those added glyphs, btw.</p>
