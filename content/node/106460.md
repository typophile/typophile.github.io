  - the one in the circle with a lightning bolt. It's an old font from a tube box,
  probably there's not a present-time correspondence.\r\n\r\nAre there any current
  similar fonts I could use in a logo design?\r\n\r\nThank you for your help."

  body: "I was curious how this 1919 lettering would look if it was made into a set
    of Initial Caps. Sort of like a swash version of Cooper Black. All tips are rounded.
    There are no vertical or horizontal lines. No straight lines, except the mid portion
    of the lightning flash. Beautiful evocation of the era. Very different from the
    fonts we suggested as somewhat similar. Here is the result of the experiment.\r\n

    consuming to make the letters properly. No point in doing it without a client.\r\nDon"
