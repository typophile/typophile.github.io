  body: Wow, pretty nice. Solid work. <BR>&#39;k&#39; is fine for me. OTOH, I think
    &#39;j&#39; needs some  <BR>work, specially on its tail. And maybe the dot of  <BR>&#39;i&#39;
    and &#39;j&#39; could be slightly smaller &#40;in height&#41;  <BR>and higher.
    <BR>Overall, great job.

  body: Wow, nice! Reminds me a little bit of Chagrin. <BR>I&#39;d make it much more
    blackletter though, like a descending &#34;h&#34; and the works. <BR> <BR>hhp

  body: I like this. I would agree with Hrant about the descending h, but only as
    alternates. I am not too sure about making i t &#34;more blackletter&#34;. You
    could, as a suggestion, make a &#34;more blackletter&#39; version as a titling
    extra, or as an &#34;italic&#34; version. Keep us posted <BR> <BR>kris

  body: Super! The diagonal stroke on the z is too light, but then again it isn&#39;t.
    I guess what I&#39;m getting at is that the cross bar there &#40;which balance&#39;s
    the letter&#39;s color with the others&#41; looks out of place. It you applied
    this to some of you other characters &#40;maybe in the uppercase and numbers&#41;
    it might feel more at home.

  body: sweet! Any updates on this? This seems like a great in between font for the
    general public who would probably not like books set in blackletter.

  body: "Cool stuff! I'd like to see the alternate, one-story a in action, though.
    I've always thought it could do duty as an initial/final form, with the two-story
    either medial-only or initial-and-medial-only.\r\n\r\nPeace,\r\nJT"
