		<div class="commentbody">The bottom sample of the logo: I read this as multiple voices. Your idead, Scott, of somehow overlapping, could also somehow help it read more along the lines of multiple voices heard as one voice. Or something like that? <BR> <BR>The use of the logo in the adverts and the posters: I wonder if the talky-balloon could face the other direction. Sometimes? In the adverts especially it causes visual direction away from the ad instead into the ad. Where/How it is used at the bottom of the posters however seems to be directional in a positive way. <BR> <BR>Adverts: Not sure about the different sizes used on the black bars. Might be better if the photos could be full-bleed. They look as if they are very dramatic and I think the forceful &#40;too assymetrical?&#41; use of black is diminishing this. <BR> <BR>Posters: The paragraphs seem too close to the sides, more white space? And instead of the headline mimicking the color of the logo used I think it would be really strong to somehow use the 3 colors in the logo. Maybe? The word spacing is too much in the headlines also.  <BR> <BR>Very fun solution overall.</div>
