body: "This is to continue discussion from [[http://typophile.com/node/71989|this
  thread.]]\r\n\r\nI proposed as a draft of an Irish-style mediuscule sans alphabet:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/lap_gae_02_5414.jpg]\r\n.\r\nAs
  one can see it is not meant as an adaption or revival of some known older Irish
  typeface. But rather as a reinterpretation of Irish type on the sans \u2018instrument\u2019.
  An experiment, though.\r\n\r\nMichael Everson then was so kind to comment like follows:\r\n<cite>I
  find it a bit chilly, but I guess that's OK, as the font is a bit chilly. I dislike
  the W rather a lot. The hard angle at the lower left of the b is inauthentic. The
  hard angle at the top left of the F is inauthentic too; follow the f. Same for capital
  B and L. The ascenders of capital B, H, K, L rise above caps height in many Gaelic
  fonts.</cite>\r\n\r\n*Chilly* \u2013 yes! This ought to be chilly. (Maybe this is
  due to the climate, we have 32\u202638\xB0C in Central Germany these days\u2026
  )\r\n\r\nI followed his remarks to quite an extend; see what changed in the next
  version:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/lap_gae_02_3_6491.jpg]\r\n.\r\nAnd
  now it looks that way:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/lap_gae_03_4410.jpg]\r\n.\r\nThe
  b issue is rather obvious. Also the rounding of L. The ascenders of capital B F
  H K L (P?) are to consider. As you see I did not make them strech above the Capitals
  height. There are neccessary descenders already and also having ascenders in the
  uppercase would make the set too disturbed, I believe. However, I changed the angles
  into offsprings and that may well appear more Irish now.\r\n.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/lap_gae_03_tx_4463.jpg]"

    d or it will not take the dot of lenition properly. Also you are missing the insular
    r, \uA783, and you should show the Tironian et \u204A in the last line replacing
    \"agus\"."

  body: "Andreas... for what this is worth :-)\r\n\r\nTry and bring the exterior \"stems\"
    of the W in a bit. i.e. curve them in slightly. I think the \"h\" is a bit overdone,
    it does not have to curve in as much to give the same effect. You could also use
    the sane approach on the n and m.\r\n\r\nI really like where you are going with
    this tho! Good job. You might want to take a look at Victor Hammer's work. He
    dedicated much time to these forms."

    thanks for converting. There is a bug with the dotted b. Just noticed I had it
    wrong encoded :-O Whrrroaaaghgh damn\r\n\r\nI\u2019m aware of the insular r; I\u2019ll
    add it. How is it used? With an ambivalence similar to the usage of s/longs in
    German?\r\n\r\nh m n w / H M N W \u2013 now I wonder if those should be shaped
    adequately, be it straight-ended or curved. Straight mM and nN seem to be good
    practise in many fonts. So the curve should be abandoned in hH and wW too? That
    would mean hardly another choice for your disliked W, Michael.\r\n\r\n<cite>Victor
    Hammer's work. He dedicated much time to these forms.</cite>\r\n\u2026 as did
    I. With Andron ;-)\r\n\r\n(L. Uebele): yes, Walhalla sans has much to it. Though
    it\u2019s not Irish but continental."

  body: No do not abandon the hmnw originals. You can just curve the stems a bit.
    Like I said the h has almost to much of a curve. A little goes a long way.
