body: "[img:sites/default/files/old-images/MRS_PORK_3854.jpg]\r\nThis is a logo I
  did in school for my brother-in-law's farm years ago. The original files have been
  lost to time, and I need to recreate this logo. All I have is this old printout.
  Problem is I do not remember what fonts I used for this. \r\n\r\nCan anyone help
  me out? Obviously the \"k\" was customized. "

  body: "Fontgrube, you're right! It looks like I vertically squished the \"o\" and
    the \"r\" so that the M R S would top align with the P and K. Don't judge, this
    was long ago :) literally the second logo I ever did.\r\n\r\nThe \"M R S\" is
    Baskerville bold. \r\n\r\nOh, to revisit old student logos. It could have been
    worse. This is still in use, which I can't say for many others I've done. "
