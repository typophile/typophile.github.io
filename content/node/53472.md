  but you have all been so helpful <a href=\"http://typophile.com/node/10008\" title=\"Critique
  of a law firm logo\">in the past</a> that I thought I would throw another one your
  way.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Logo - Full Color (low resolution)_6151.png]\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\nThis
  was a full identity package that needed to work across multiple media: web, print,
  etc. It needed to be inviting but still professional. \r\n\r\nI really wanted to
  push myself on this one and get the identity to ride purely on the strength of the
  type, the color, and the layout. Too often I try to solve a logo problem by just
  finding the magic shape or illustration. The result is often that I don't spend
  enough time exploring type and color as a way of unifying and carrying the overall
  brand identity. So any thoughts along those lines would be much appreciated.\r\n\r\nHere's
  how it came out on the <a href=\"http://www.beukematherapy.com/\">website</a>, the
  <a href=\"http://www.beukematherapy.com/marketing/Business%20Card%20-%20Vertical.pdf\">business
  card (PDF)</a> , and <a href=\"http://www.beukematherapy.com/marketing/Letterhead.pdf\">the
  letterhead (PDF)</a>.\r\n\r\nThe design is done, so this is just a learning exercise
  for me.\r\n\r\nPeter"

    superfluous.

  body: I think the type is Droid right? Maybe the second line is too big and it takes
    importance from the doctors name. Should be second in attention.

  body: "Luciano,\r\n\r\nThat was one critique I had of the logo as well. But I was
    stuck with the second line. What could I have done with the second line to de-emphasize
    it? (Other than shrinking it)."

    shrinking it)\r\n\r\nWhen dealing with any kind of design you want to focus on
    breaking down the elements into their respective hierarchies.  In this case I
    would assume that the doctor's name is the most important element.  Assuming it
    is, I would have done three things differently.\r\n1.  Make the doctor's name
    bigger.  His name is his brand so emphasis on that is important.  I would also
    have made that the colored element instead of regular ol' black.\r\n2.  Drop the
    medical credentials down right underneath the doctor's name.  They are necessary
    only for validation that he is a medical professional.  \r\n3. Drop the rules
    to tighten up the whole package.  If you (or your client) feel that they are necessary,
    keep them in but take them down a point size or two and tighten them up.  Too
    much negative space in your composition will make it feel like it isn't cohesive.\r\n\r\nI
    always find it's fun to revisit a logo even when it's out the door.  It's a great
    way to learn from your mistakes and grow as a designer!"

  body: "Those are very helpful. Regarding #1: That's interesting, I actually made
    his name black because I thought that would emphasize it more. And regarding #3,
    you're spot on about tightening it up. That was probably my biggest hesitation
    about the logo when I handed it off though I don't think I could have articulated
    the problem at the time.\r\n\r\nMany thanks for the comments."
