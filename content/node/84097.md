body: "Hello,\r\n\r\nI've released a couple of fonts for the first time, and I'd love
  to hear to your comments. Both fonts can be downloaded for free in my web page.
  Both of them are display fonts, letters with no modulation, thought as a font for
  architectural signs.\r\n\r\nStadium font can be found here:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.angelsanchez.eu/index.php/project/stadium_font\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/StadiumFont1_6327.jpg]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/StadiumFont3_6730.jpg]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/StadiumFont4_4861.jpg]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/StadiumFont5_6042.jpg]\r\n\r\n\r\nThank
  you."

  body: The quirky typeface dept. has been leaving me wanting more of late, but I
    really like what you've done here. Quirky, but architectural <strong>and</strong>
    sexy.

  body: "Thank you all very much.\r\n\r\nAndreas, I drew all the letterforms from
    zero. All the design process was made by hand, before digitallization. The starting
    point were two circles inscribed in a 3:5 rectangle. The restriction I imposed
    myself was to keep the centres of all the curves in the typeface horizontally
    aligned.\r\n\r\nYou'll find more images in the web:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.angelsanchez.eu/index.php/project/stadium_font\r\n\r\nJeremyloyd,
    please, let me know if you use it!"

  body: "I would interrupt (internally) the slash of the zero, so to keep it even
    more distant from the O slashed. I also think it is aesthetically better.\r\nNice
    currency signs."

  body: Piccic, do you mean two gaps beetwen the slash and the 0 path? Or a gap in
    the midle of the slash?

  body: The first, interruption inside the zero form. I think it would make it stronger,
    and less crude, besides helping to distinguish it from the Oslash.
