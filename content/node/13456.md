  somewhere and I have seen it. I just cannot think of it right now. Take a look:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.simonebianchi.com/startfox.asp\r\n\r\nIf
  anyone can direct me to a download approximately like this or I have seen a Black/distressed
  version close to this somewhere as well.\r\n\r\nAny help would be greatly appreciated.\r\n\r\nThanX,\r\nKojo"
