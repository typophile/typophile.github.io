  having read that in acient times among printers there was the tradition that up
  to three errors in a book would be regarded as \"okay\". The nickname for an error
  was \"turtle\" or, since I think the story took place in Italy, \"tartaruga\". Therefore
  a printer created his mark showing two turtles so that in the rest of the book only
  one more turtle (= mistake) could be expected. In doing so he referred to his superior
  quality.\r\nI cannot find this story on the web. Is my memory wrong? Has anybody
  heard of a similar story? Thanks in advance for helpful suggestions!"

    sure I understand, would this mark appear in the book? If the printer found the
    errors prior to printing, why wouldn't he fix them? Or is this mark just used
    in advertising the book?"

  body: "@JamesM:\r\nBecause \"turtle\" was a slang term for an error, and the typical
    standard of the time was three errors in a book before one goes back and re-does
    the typesetting, the idea was that because the printer's mark was two turtles
    (instead of, say, a dolphin) that \"used up\" two of the errors, and so it was
    intended as a claim that there would be only <em>one</em> actual error in the
    book, at most.\r\n\r\nI thought the original post explained this clearly."

  body: '@JamesM -- As I understand it, the printer''s mark would appear on a page
    in the book, since it tells who printed it. So, yes, it''s a kind of advertising.
    But making the claim that there would only be one undetected printer''s mistake
    in any book takes titanium balls.'

  body: The claim was that there would only be one uncorrected detected mistake, or
    that there would be an average of one undetected mistake per book, or something
    like that, so it was a little less bold than that.

  body: Rephrased yours, @Gunnar, since it was new to me. I think your OP was clear
    enough but that @JamesM either hadn't had his first cuppa yet or had overdone
    the grog. I know my sense of understanding tends to go AWOL in these cases.

    seemed to indicate a problem understanding it. I had not heard of the anecdote
    myself before, so I can't help you in finding the source.

    mistakes.\r\n\r\nI wonder if the practice of reprinting with greater than three
    errors applied only to books where a page took up a single leaf? Or was it extended
    to editions with folded pages -- folios, quartos, even octavos?\r\n\r\nAnd what
    if additional errors were discovered after some customers had already purchased
    the sheets & paid an illustrator to draw in any drop-in letters? Or worse, taken
    the sheets to his favorite binder?  The printer couldn't just supply a fresh \"page,\"

  body: "Thank you, Dajare, for finding the answer sought.\r\n\r\nIncidentally, I
    see that Jacques Kerver, in addition to printing the famous French translation
    of the <em>Hypnerotomachia Poliphili</em>, also printed some of Nostradamus' predictions,
    and the Steganographia of Trithemius.\r\n\r\nAnd I learned something else while
    satisfying my curiosity about Kerver. It turns out that Aldus Manutilus really
    used the <em>same typeface</em> for De Aetna and the Hypnerotomachia Poliphili,
    except that for the latter the <em>capital letters</em> were replaced with a new
    set.\r\n\r\nThat suggests that someone might attempt a revival that, instead of
    being two separate typefaces, like Bembo and Poliphilus, respectively, might be
    two versions of the same typeface, with different upper-case letters only."
