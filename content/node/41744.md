body: "I have been working on my typeface Froggy for a few years now and lately I
  have revisited all my metrics yet again, mostly class kerning. After finishing setting
  up my classes and kerning the font, I noticed the next day that the kerning classes
  had vanished. In my frustration, I used the \"automatic\" feature to rebuild the
  kerning classes. The result was less than satisfactory so I restarted the job of
  setting up kerning classes a third time manually. I had finished the Cyrillic glyphs
  of the job and decided to test the progress before doing the Latin. Upon updating
  the kern feature and recompiling the OpenType window, I was greeted with a message
  that \"glyph class not defined (text was \"@lcall\")\". I checked my opentype classes
  and to my horror found that ALL of them had vanished (kern classes were still there).
  The only thing that seemed to be a correlation in both cases was that I had selected
  only certain class(kern or opentype)  to view while I was working (in the little
  pop-up menu at the bottom of the list of classes). Needless to say, I am not a happy
  camper. I don't know if this is a bug or just my incompetence but the frustration
  level is out of the solar system. There was no warning or dire caution of any kind.\r\n\r\nChrisL"

  body: "I ran into this bug recently. I'm not sure, but I think it's related to using
    the FL feature where you tell it to show only a certain kind of class, only OpenType
    classes for example. If you then use the \"clean up classes\" command, it deletes
    the classes that are not shown. Like I say, I'm not totally sure this is what
    caused it, but I was using those two features before my classes disappeared, and
    I don't use those features often AND this hadn't happen to me before. Maybe just
    voodoo thinking on my part.\r\n\r\nLuckily, I had started using the Time Machine
    feature in Leopard, so I was able to retrieve a version of the font from a few
    hours earlier and copy the missing classes."

  body: "Ah ha! I can reproduce it: \r\n\r\n- Open the Classes panel\r\n- Use the
    pop-up menu at the bottom to show only one kind of class\r\n- Choose \"Clean Up
    Classes\" from the pop-up menu near the top of the panel\r\n- Be sure to check
    the \"Sort classes alphabetically\" option\r\n- Use the pop-up menu at the bottom
    to show all classes again -- Oops! The others have vanished!\r\n\r\nI haven't
    tried every combination, but it seems to be the alphabetization option that triggers
    the bug."

    to view only one, and edit it by dragging its items into a different order, the
    contents of the other three get trashed."

    only. Couldn't figure it out and it was definitely frustrating, it has happened
    randomly here and there and I didnt know what to make of it\u2026 would be nice
    to hear if there is a fix for it\u2026"

  body: After one or two instances where I lost my classes, I started to export my
    classes to a .flc file on a regular basis. It started out as a backup strategy
    (and saved me more than once), but I also found it easier to review the classes
    or make some overall changes by working on the file in a text editor and then
    importing back into FontLab when I was done.

  body: "Thanks everyone! That sounds like the same issue I am having. When I select
    show only OpenType the kern classes vanish. When I select show only OpenType,
    the kern classes die.  I will stay away from that button! I hope the FontLab folks
    can fix it cause it sure is a pain! \r\nSparky, I just started doing the same
    thing by saving classes. Too bad that you have to though.\r\n\r\nChrisL"
