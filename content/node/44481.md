  Haha. Not the best, i''d say totally the opposite but yup. Goes to say, I have goofy

  body: "Now this is going to drive me crazy, missgiggles. Thanks a lot.\r\nI may
    be Scala, but I'm not sure at all. There's just something about Scala that reminds
    me of myself. I don't even like it that much. And I like myself (I think?!), so
    that's not right! :P\r\nI've been thinking about this for quite a while, though,
    this relationship between people and typefaces. For example, to me, Palatino really
    looks like an old, somewhat distinct, calm and collected man, someone who has
    lived a life and has lots of experience but doesn't flaunt it at all. Galliard
    is also someone with experience, but he can be a lot cooler and edgier than Palatino
    \u2013 which I see in the italic \u2013, but a kind of an educated   coolness
    that only years of experience can bring. But I only seem to be able to do this
    with some typefaces, and few.\r\nI'll get back at you, missgiggles. I'm really
    thinking about this! :P"

    It's discreetly quirky; it's coherent, but there's one or two things that seem
    out of place; it's pixellated, thus a bit sharp and it may seem cold, but it's
    very warm. But I think it's quite hard to really capture me in one typeface, if
    I'm allowed the presumption. :P\r\n\r\nBy the way, someone who knows me pretty
    well immediately rejected Scala for me."
