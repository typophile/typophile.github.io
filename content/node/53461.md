body: "Hi everyone,\r\n\r\nLong time watcher, first time register/poster here.\r\nI'm
  currently working on a typeface that I designed for a mens boutique in Brighton,
  UK.\r\n\r\nIt started off as a bold variant, but i've carried on as a regular weight.\r\nThe
  actual typeface generation (everything except the characters 'Peggs & son.') were
  created for a two week uni project.\r\n\r\nI'm now working on it in fontlab studio.
  A lot of the metrics still need to be tweaked as well.\r\n\r\nAny criticism, pointers,
  help etc would be hugely grateful!\r\n\r\nThanks\r\nEdd"

  body: "I think that you have the potential for a really nice font. \r\nThe serifs
    feel optically too heavy compaired to the other strokes within the forms. \r\nMost
    of the joints especially where a bowl meets an ascender are too heavy.\r\nThe
    tight radius curve on the ascender of your lowercase letters are a little broken
    (see Karen Cheng's book Designing Type on \"the bone effect\" to solve these issues.\r\nMy
    last comment is that the extension stroke on commas, etc. are too long.\r\n\r\nGreat
    structure and good luck, I would like to see the finished result.\r\n"

  body: "Nice work. This looks really promising. I do think you should change UC letters
    to incorporate that curvy serif transition. Righ now it's just K and L that have
    it. LC is more consistent with it.\r\n\r\nOtherwise UC letters remind too much
    of some other typography.\r\n\r\nThe same thing's with LC from v on. No distinction
    and not really looking like a part of the same family.\r\n\r\nBut it may just
    be me.\r\n___________\r\n<em>Robert Koritnik</em>"

  body: "Hi,\r\n\r\nThanks for your thoughts on this!\r\nA lot of the small kinks,
    and the like occured when I brought all of the glyphs into fontlab. I initially
    drew it in illustrator, and then brought it in, and as it wasn't drew on a correct
    grid, nodes got pulled around creating odd thicknesses etc. I'm currently going
    through it all and trying to tidy it all up.\r\n\r\nThe overall idea for the face
    is taken from old typewriter fonts where the bowls of characters sometimes don't
    connect, so this little feature was taken as a major inspiration for the face.
    In characters like the v, w etc, I couldn't replicate this feature, so got a bit
    stuck. I'll see what I can come up with though!\r\n\r\nThankyou everyone for your
    thoughts! Its always nice to get another pair of eyes on something that I've been
    looking at for a while."

  body: What works beautifully for the lowercase ascenders does not look good on the
    uppercase at all. In contrast to Robert, I think you should remove that element
    from K and L.

  body: Some little thing for now. I think your OSF 3, 4 and 5 number should be below
    the baseline. The top S should have his serif.
