body: "cross-posted\r\n\r\nVOLT includes various supplemental files including a version
  of USP10.dll (AKA as Uniscribe) users can optionally use that .dll for font testing
  fonts (for example by copying it into a folder along with a copy of notepad.exe).
  \r\n\r\nBased on today's security advisory we would recommend avoiding using using
  that DLL. For more details see http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/bulletin/MS10-063.mspx
  \r\n\r\nIn the coming days we'll replace the current VOLT download with one that
  does not include Uniscribe.\r\n\r\nCheers, Si \r\n"
