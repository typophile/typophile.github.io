    Short History of the Printed Word</em>]] is really good but it covers only the
    printing period. It was updated by Robert Bringhurst. \r\n\r\nOn a much more \"calligraphic\"
    or writing approach, George Jean\u2019s [[http://www.amazon.com/Lecriture-Memoire-Archeologie-Georges-Jean/dp/207053040X/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1204733772&sr=1-1|<em>L\u2019\xC9criture
    m\xE9moire des hommes</em>]] is really good, if you understand French. It was
    republished by Gallimard in 2007."
