body: "Hi all,\r\n\r\nNot specifically a type problem per se, but I thought the Typophile
  collective might be able to suggest a solution to the problem...\r\n\r\nI work on
  a Mac (OS X) and regularly need to print lots of PDF files (magazine pages). They
  need to be sent to our laser printer on our studio network and it's a grade-A hassle
  to print because if I try to highlight all the files and select print, a print options
  dialogue box appears for each and every PDF - meaning I can't leave the Mac working
  away and go and do something else, even though the print options are identical for
  each PDF file. It's not the end of the world or anything, it's just irritating,
  having to sit there and manually attend to the dialogue boxes!\r\n\r\nHas anyone
  got any idea of a way around this? Is there an AppleScript or application that will
  take the chore away?\r\n\r\nCheers\r\n\r\nSi"

  body: You can also create desktop printer in the Printer Setup Utility and simply
    drag all of the PDFs to the desktop printer icon. Not quite as sophisticated,
    but it works.
