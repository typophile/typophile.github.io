  good combination of type? What would you sugguest? Also what alternatives for the
  (free) font used for the logo?\r\n\r\nOr does anyone have any good examples of ads
  that don't look like they are striaght from the yellow pages? Thanks!\r\n-jesse\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/apropos01_3913.jpg]"

  body: 'I would rethink the layout rather than just the typeface. Most ads follow
    this hierarchy: 1. Headline 2. Visual 3. Body Text 4. Logo/Contact Info. 1 and
    2 are sometimes switched, especially if you have a great visual (photo or illustration).
    Right now everything has about the same visual weight which is making everything
    blend together. Increase the size of the headline, eliminate the wide margins,
    put the logo and contact info at the bottom and see what that does.'

  body: "As Chris mentioned, it's not so much the selection of type as the layout
    itself. It's like saying the color of your shirt can make you more impressive.
    Color and type are only parts of the whole.\r\n\r\nBTW -- I used to do small space
    B&W ads for newspapers and yellow pages by the hundreds many years ago (and still
    will for beer money ;-> ).\r\n\r\nMy key question would be \"what kind of clientele
    are you after?\"\r\nYour ad, since you design interiors, will be a direct reflection
    of your own style or the style that appeals to your potential clients."

  body: "Aight, im just not sure what to do with the layout because I can't think
    of any interesting visual elements i can add that will make the ad more exciting.
    So i just threw this one togethar to get type help. \r\n\r\nThe clients for this
    one will be a more wealthy crowd as this is going in a black and white gala brochure
    where tickets are anywhere from $150-$10,000. So something elegant and classy
    i suppose.\r\n\r\nThoughts?"

  body: "I'm going to agree and say a headline is the missing piece. Not to bog down
    on the words, but the slogan or tag line or whatever you want to call it at the
    top is a lost opportunity. It leads me to wonder, \"if I hired them to do my whole
    house, would they still work one room at a time?\" I don't see what the idea is
    selling.\r\n\r\nNow that I made a mess of that, if I didn't have the resources
    to develop a meaningful headline-style campaign, I would enlarge the logo to nearly
    fill the space, line list the bits at the bottom, make the number big but submissive
    (as you have it), and think twice about the pic (which may turn out rather unflattering
    considering the print quality).\r\n\r\n"

    figure out how to do it without people asking... \"why is there a name in there?\"

  body: "If ya gotta ya gotta. We all deal with that.\r\n\r\nYou could put the name
    and title above the number, so it reads as a contact.\r\n\r\nIf you use that dark
    curtain I could ask about the dot gain and peel it back to about 85% or so at
    its darkest spot. I'm generalizing about newsprint but they may have a more specific
    target."

    up the black as a whole on the image? Is this because a large dot gain will produce
    a darker image altogethar? \r\n\r\nI lightened up a bit through curves. I wanted
    the curtain to be fairly dark so it doesn't stand out too much.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/apropos05_3957.jpg]"

  body: Typically setting the curve to 85% will give you a solid black on newsprint
    pulpy paper. The details of the curtain may plug up and be lost at 100% K. I would
    worry abou the script wordmark closing in a bit as well.

  body: "I think you should try the headline on two or three lines and visibly larger
    than the bullet points. The rules under the bullet points look as though they
    will fill in even on high quality brochure stock, they are also too close to the
    copy and don't perform any real function (although they are better than using
    a bullet), if their purpose is to separate each subject then do you need one for
    organization? I would also use the logo in the form it appears on the website
    (horizontal) as this allows the type to be larger as it is overwhelmed by the
    illustration at the moment. The contact information could also appear in one line.
    One of the reasons for this advice is that the mixed alignment/typefaces/size
    and leading of the elements are fighting one another.\r\nI am not sure that the
    curtains really add to the design they seem more theatrical/horror movie than
    domestic and send out confusing messages; are we in a room looking out onto a
    foggy night; are we looking into a room from the outside?\r\nMy inclination would
    be \r\nHeadline enlarged split into three lines at top left possibly ranged right;\r\nBullets,
    ranged left starting nearer the horizontal centre vertically aligned to below
    the headline;\r\nContact Details in one line justified to the width of the horizontal
    logo bottom left, and\r\nBackground black\r\nThat's only a brief assessment and
    you might find it doesn't work for you, but I hope it is helpful.\r\nTim"

  body: "I think you can enlarge the headline (btw traMsforming:) and the logo, think
    of it in the way you want a viewer to read it, which is somewhat what others said
    about hierarchy; you need to introduce some kind of progression (as distinct from
    steps) from headline to subordinate copy to contact to logo (although logo and
    contact details are interchangeable). As for font choice you need to keep that
    progression in mind, Trajan is a fine display face but needs to be bigger to work
    with your body copy wheras the contact details are overpowering the logo.\r\nThinking
    further I don't think the last bullet point \u2022 Organization really means anything
    in the context of the advertisement, it is the kind of nebulous heading that needs
    supporting copy.\r\nTim"

  body: If its an ad and you are not in control of the printing any halftone will
    be a disaster. Loose any halftones or gradients. I would use a white background
    because it is clean, fresh, new all the qualities that reflect your clients business.
    The dark curtain of uncertainty is a negative in my eyes.

  body: I'm with Dan, lose the background. The white was better. There's a typo in
    your headline. It still looks static, because everything is stacked neatly. The
    logo should go above the contact info. Some of that type needs to be smaller and
    some of it should be bigger. You will create interest by creating a hierarchy
    of information, not when everything has the same visual weight to it. Right now
    you have 3 "chunks" of information that are relatively the same size/weight.
