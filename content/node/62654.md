  putting together a few fancy pictures of fruits and veggies and have placed the
  Latin names as labels to the macroshots of the food.  My copywriter provided me
  with the correct words, however there is a strange \"\xD7\" symbol that I have never
  encountered before.  What does it stand for?  I'm treating the kerning as if it
  where a regular \"x\" character but is it suppose to be ascended or descended?"

    as well, but \u201C\xD7\u201D apparently is also used in botanical taxonomy to
    indicate hybrids. Spacing and kerning probably should be handled as it would be
    as a math symbol. \r\n\r\nI reason this only by parsing your question and not
    any extensive knowledge of the relevant subject."

  body: "The \xD7 does indeed signify hybrid (cross-breeding). I believe that horticultural
    style guides vary on whether there should be space following the \xD7 or not.
    I think the current tendency is closed up, whereas previously it was open.\r\n\r\nIn
    many typefaces, the design of the \xD7 has it raised above the baseline slightly,
    depending upon the default figure style. If this is the case and you're using
    a closed-up style (with no space after), then I suggest you try baseline shifting
    it down to the baseline (or center on the x-height is also an option). "

    character in the first few words of your post for everyone's enjoyment. "

    map ornaments to semantic character codes."

    of.  What do you mean it \"maps\".  Do you speak strictly online to the randomized
    featured typeface on the forums page?\r\n\r\nbest regards,\r\ndaniel"

  body: "By \"maps\" I mean that when the \"\xD7\" character is replaced via sIFR
    with the featured font, Elmurst, in thread headlines or on the homepage background
    pullquotes, it is rendered as a flueron, rather than a multiplication symbol.
    Just a joke--and one that will make even less sense when they change the featured
    face."
