  body: '<B>To calculate the number of layout pages required to flow an article, use
    the following algorithm.</B> <BR> <BR>Note: In today&#39;s world, copy is readily
    available in digital format. Most major word processing software can give you
    a character account. &#40;Microsoft Word: Tools/Word Count&#41; If a character
    count is not available but you have a printed copy of the article, use steps 1
    and 2 to estimate the total # of characters in the article: <BR> <BR><B>Estimating
    the total # of characters in original hardcopy:</B> <BR> <BR>1. Average the number
    of characters  per line by counting the characters in the longest and shortest
    line and dividing by 2. <BR> <BR>2. Multiply &#40;the result of #1&#41; by &#40;the
    total number of printed lines in your hardcopy&#41; to get the total # of characters
    in your copy. <BR> <BR> <BR><B>Calculating the # of pages needed in your finished
    format:</B> <BR> <BR>3. Multiply &#40;the # of characters per finished line&#41;
    by &#40;the # of lines in finished column&#41; to get the total number of characters
    in your finished column. <BR> <BR>4. Divide &#40;the result of #2&#41; by &#40;the
    result of #3&#41; to get the # of columns needed in your finished format. <BR>
    <BR>5. Divide &#40;the result of #4&#41; by &#40;the number of columns per page&#41;
    to get the total number of text-only pages in your finished format. <BR> <BR>Now
    that you know the sheer amount of text space you&#39;ll have to account for, you
    can now estimate the number of pages you&#39;ll actually need to reserve after
    considering imagery, headlines, and overall pacing.'
