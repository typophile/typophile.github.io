  direction, it'd be greatly appreciated.

  body: Just use a marker and have at it. Is there a reason you would need a font
    like that as opposed to just handlettering it?

  body: Seems like a rather bad type style for wayfinding signage. But, as stated,
    grab a marker then start scanning it in...

    a California lettering artist do what needs to be done.\r\n\r\nThere is John Burns,

    (sp), Charle Borges (WA), etc! Go to www.cynscribe.com and search California calligraphers.\r\n\r\nI
    have always maintained that the time wasted by art directors going through catalogues
    or the internet they could have had somebody letter it for the same price that
    you billed for time spent searching.\r\n\r\nMichael"

  body: again, the purposes of the project forbid such an expenditure. while you're
    absolutely right about getting an artist to do it up front, the issue comes from
    it being a Chinese amusement park based around pirates. problems would be less
    if i could get away with simply markering it. but i'm not in china and they want
    a font to pick out so they can simply print up signs when the time comes.

    Or <a href="http://www.abecedarienne.com/" target="_blank">Thicket</a>, perhaps?
    You can get a closer match like <a href="http://www.dafont.com/search.php?q=triballaka&nb_ppp_old=10&page=1&text=Blackbeard+Coast+Danger&nb_ppp=10&psize=m&classt=alpha"
    target="_blank">Triballaka</a>, but the already poor readability gets even worse.
