  body: Nice, isn't it? If there's a specific use or even just a look you've got in
    mind, the folks here would be most helpful in pointing you toward more of what
    you want. There are several.

  body: That is a hard {"favorite" to come up with. Almost all oldstyle serif font
    (from a good foundary) comes with nice OS figures, and most have small caps as
    well. Jenson, Garamonds (other than ITC), Goudy Old Style, Palatino, etc., are
    all nice.
