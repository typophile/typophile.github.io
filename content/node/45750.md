body: "[img:sites/default/files/old-images/MMheader_5977.jpg]\r\n\r\nCan anyone identify
  a couple fonts that they use on the CNBC show Mad Money with Jim Cramer?\r\n\r\nThe
  main one I'm looking for is the stenciled font that is used for the \"MAD\" in the
  Mad Money logo.  Identifont came up with [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/atf/alternate-gothic/familytree.html|Alternate
  Gothic]], which looks like it, but I can't find any versions in the stencil style.\r\n\r\nAlso,
  if anyone has any ideas for the font used in this image that says \"MAD CAP RECAP\"
  it would also be appreciated."
