  make sure the reader slows down, and thus better understands the text? In particular,
  has anyone ever done this with a textbook or other educational materials? Or has
  anyone made another design decision with a similar effect, such as printing the
  text in light gray?\r\n\r\nNote: there is some empirical research suggesting that
  using more difficult typefaces can increase comprehension. Dan Kahneman discusses
  some of it in Thinking Fast, Thinking Slow, and a very recent example is the new
  study described here, which finds increased gains for dyslexic readers:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.telegraph.co.uk/education/educationnews/10089102/Hard-to-read-fonts-can-boost-pupil-results-by-up-to-a-fifth.html"

    make something harder to read if their clients  want to discourage folks from
    reading it. For example, in annual reports bad news is sometimes put in dense
    paragraphs of all caps, with numbers spelled out, making it harder to read."

    the teachers did make. Maybe Corsiva is more readable because it's an italic,
    maybe because the letter forms are more differentiated than in Arial. The same
    results could be argued to just prove the opposite, that Corsiva is more readable
    and thus the pupils' comprehension was better.\r\n\r\nThis study doesn't really
    hold up to scientific standards."

    I haven't read the study cited in the news article and can't vouch for its research
    design. But it's not the only one--I mentioned Kahneman's secondary work, and
    Chris listed other studies. I don't care about the details of this study (or the
    dyslexia vs. general population point). I'm interested in the general principle."

  body: Even if the general principle applies to experimental conditions where the
    subjects must study the material, that may not translate well to the real world,
    where in 99% of cases people have the option of just not frickin' reading it,
    because they lost interest in doing the extra work of reading something that was
    harder to read.

  body: Poetry is an interesting case of text that generally calls to be read slowly,
    preferably out loud. When we talk about the high contrast romantic types of Didot
    and Bodoni being relatively more difficult to read than lower contrast, oblique
    axis types, we often overlook just how much poetry the Didots and Bodoni were
    publishing.

  body: "A quick review for those who don\u2019t have database access (or don\u2019t
    want to pay $40.USD to download it).\r\n\r\nFor starters, the authour\u2019s and
    those who administered the tests are middle-school teachers, not research scientists.\r\n\r\n<strong>Subjects
    (Ss)</strong>\r\n275 students in Years 9\u201311 (age range= 13\u201316 years).\r\nMean
    and standard deviation not reported.\r\nSs were previously grouped into four \u201Cbands\u201D
    by Middle Years Information System tests.\r\nSome were diagnosed with Dyslexya,
    but there was no agreed upon definition, nor were they diagnosed by the same person
    with the same methods. Uncontrolled.\r\n\r\n<strong>Experimental design</strong>\r\nBetween
    Ss. Each group of Ss only received one condition (font\u2014Arial or Monotype
    Corsiva).\r\n\r\n\r\n<strong>Methods</strong>\r\nDouble blind study. Neither the
    experimenter (a teacher) nor Ss knew what condition they were about to administer/receive.
    During a 40 minute lesson of students copying material from the blackboard and
    answering questions from a textbook Ss were stopped, and shown a powerpoint slide.
    It contained the following text:\r\n\r\n<blockquote>The white dwarf star Amethyst
    is in the constellation Cassiopeia. It is half the mass of the Sun but has a diameter
    one hundred times less than the Sun. On its surface it has a temperature of twelve
    thousand Kelvin. It is mostly made up of carbon. Currently, we have found three
    planets orbiting\r\naround it.</blockquote>\r\n\r\nThe line-breaks can not be
    discerned from the figure presented in the paper.\r\n\r\nSs were given 90 seconds
    to read the text in silence. The lesson continued. Approximately 35 minutes later,
    they were administered the following questions:\r\n\r\n<blockquote>1) What is
    the name of the star?\r\nAmethyst/Amey/Myethyst/Alpha-Centauri\r\n\r\n2) In which
    constellation is it? \r\nCassiopeia/Cancer/Capricorn/Pavo\r\n\r\n3) What type
    of star is it?\r\nWhite Dwarf/Red Dwarf/Red Giant/White Giant\r\n\r\n4) How many
    times the mass of the Sun is it?\r\nHalf/Double/Ten Times/Five Times\r\n\r\n5)
    What is the temperature on its surface?\r\nTwelve Kelvin/Twelve Thousand Kelvin/Twelve
    Thousand Centigrade/Three Thousand Kelvin\r\n\r\n6) What is it mostly made up
    of?\r\nCarbon/Helium/Iron/Cadmium\r\n\r\n7) Have we found planets orbiting it?\r\nYes/No</blockquote>\r\n\r\nThey
    were on paper. Their typographic design is not reported.\r\n121 Ss saw Arial,
    154 saw Monotype Corsiva.\r\nSs were grouped into two groups by random balanced
    assignment\u2014random assignment followed by re-grouping Ss to ensure that each
    group had a similar percentage of Ss from all bands, including readers with Dyslexia.\r\n\r\n<strong>Results</strong>\r\nAcross
    bands, and including dyslexic readers,  Ss who saw Monotype Corsiva scored 12.8%
    higher. This was statistically significant.\r\nWithin bands, excluding dyslexic
    readers, the mean difference between Arial and Monotype Corsiva was 11.5%. This
    was statistically significant.\r\n\r\n<strong>The interesting part of the results</strong>\r\nAcross
    bands, the difference between Arial and Monotype Corsiva was 12.8%. Within bands,
    the mean difference was 11.5%. However, when looking at <em>only</em> readers
    with dyslexia, the difference between Arial and Monotype Corsiva was 19%. While
    arithmetically different from the overall difference, it was not statiscically
    significant.\r\n\r\n<strong>In one sentence</strong>\r\nWhen students with Dyslexia
    saw a slide with a passage of text set in Monotype Corsiva compared to Arial ,
    they performed significantly better on a short comprehension test, but the <em>difference</em>
    between their scores was not significantly greater than the difference between
    the scores of  students without Dyslexia.\r\n\r\n<strong>In conclusion</strong>\r\nA
    nice short and easy to read article. however, it is full of confounds and impossible
    to reproduce from the paper. In the concluding remarks of Diemand-Yauman et al.
    (2010, pp 4), they state \u201CThe potential for improving educational practices
    through cognitive interventions is immense. If a simple change of font can significantly
    increase student performance, one can only imagine the number of beneficial cognitive
    interventions waiting to be discovered. Fluency demonstrates how small interventions
    have the potential to make big improvements in the performance of our students
    and education system as a whole.\u201D\r\n\r\nThis is an great example of non-scientists
    testing disfluency theory, and a testament at how easy it may be to implement
    these techniques in real-world settings, for which they should be applauded."

    slowing down might increase comprehension when dealing with a few sentences. But
    would the same result happen when reading a whole book, or would people (like
    Thomas mentioned) simply give up?\r\n\r\nA real-world example: If someone sends
    me a handwritten \"thank you\" note, I'll take the time to decipher the writing.
    But a few years ago someone showed me a handwritten 1800s diary of our church
    history. Even though the subject interested me, I gave up after a couple of pages
    because reading the handwriting was just too slow and difficult."

    the other small, italic and screened, to represent \u201Chard to read\u201D. So,
    it was not typefaces that were being compared, but settings, according to the
    prejudices of the researchers, who rigged the experiment to set one typeface so
    that it was \u201Charder to read\u201D than the other.\r\n\r\nWithout seeing the
    slides involved here, I can nonetheless state that the Arial setting will look
    really boring, just the kind of thing that would make students\u2019 eyes glaze
    over and their minds wander, while the Corsiva setting will have a degree of novelty
    that warrants more attention.\r\n\r\nAs I pointed out in a previous thread, what
    is being compared is not, as the researchers believe, difficulty of typeface,
    but appropriateness of type choice and type specs, about which they are somewhat
    ignorant, because that ain\u2019t their bailiwick.\r\n\r\nSo congratulations,
    they have discovered typography!\r\n\r\nThe researchers here are victims of the
