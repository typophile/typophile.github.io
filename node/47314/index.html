  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Chank Diesel, a.k.a. [[http://typophile.com/node/46850|Charles Andermack]], was born in Canada, raised in Florida and educated in Minnesota. He currently runs his foundry [[Chank Fonts]] from his home office in Minneapolis, MN, USA. 

Chank strives to make fonts fun and accessible for both the average computer-user and professional designers. He distributes a diverse collection of display fonts through his website [[http://www.chank.com|Chank.com]] and also creates custom fonts for corporate clients who want exclusive rights and a specific design for a typeface. Chank's [[http://www.chank.com/gofontyourself/index.php|Go Font Yourself!]] service is popular with individuals who want a custom font of their own handwriting.

Chank began making fonts in 1992 when he worked as creative director of the alternative music magazine, <em>CAKE</em>. Making the most of his connections in the music industry, he road-tripped across America and visited designers at record labels. He earned a reputation as "The Travelling Font Salesman" and also snagged some high profile font appearances on album covers.

Chank's fonts were featured in the Smithsonian's Cooper-Hewitt National Design Museum as "important examples of contemporary typography" in 1996, the same year as he established Chank.com. In 1997 he was profiled in <em>The Wall Street Journal</em>, complete with etched portrait. More recently he was featured in the <em>New York Times</em> article entitled "[[http://www.nytimes.com/2008/06/26/technology/personaltech/26basics.html?8dpc|Down With Helvetica: Design Your Own Font]]."

He is also a [[http://www.mnartists.org/article.do?rid=217589|painter]].
