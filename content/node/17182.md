  at Ti Couz (Crepe house) on 16th & Mission\r\n\r\nIf folks call me to say they are
  coming @ 617.312.1968 then I will try to reserve a table of the right size.\r\n\r\nCheers!\r\n\r\n______________________________________________________\r\n\r\nOriginal
  post : I am SF bound and I am there for a week - any type related ( or unrelated
  ) recommendations?\r\n\r\nI know about \r\n\r\nWilliam Stout Architectural Books
  \r\n804 Montgomery St.\r\nSan Francisco, CA 94133\r\n(415) 391-6757\r\n\r\nBut I
  imagine there is much more to explore & do. \r\n\r\nI would also be psyched to meet
  any fellow Typophiles while I am there. Feel free to contact me via my profile.\r\n\r\n"

    recently, so it's only open in Berkeley.\r\n\r\nA print shop has opened in 2005
    in a basement space on Market street near Noe and 16th; they have a large stock
    of books on typography and design from around the world, and they seem very sympathetic
    to designers; a designers' printer, with a store. Odd, and interesting. I forgot
    its name. \r\n\r\nEben, these are the first things that pop into my head related
    to type, but there's a million things to enjoy about SF, from chocolate to plant
    collections to vistas to hiking and beyond. Plenty of panoramas.... \r\n\r\nBay
    Area Typophiles, shall we make Eben's visit a pretext for a gathering?"

    Book Arts & Special Collections</a> on 6th Floor of the SF public library (near
    civic center). <a href=\"http://www.sfcb.org/\">Center for the Book</a> is also
    worth checking out. \r\n\r\nPersonally, I enjoy the hand painted signs around
    the mission district (which seem to be something of an endangered species). While
    you're there, you should get a burrito at <a href=\"http://panchovillasf.com/\">
    Pancho Villas</a>."

    like it is a pretty rich collection. It says on the wbe site that they have a
    strong collection of 16th century stuff.

    I have to go back on the 18th. So the 20th won't work it turns out. Sorry!\r\n\r\nBut
    I am here now ( it's the 11th) in the mission near the Noe Valley ginza/shopping
    area. In a couple days I will be out in the richmond. Anybody got dim sum recommendations
    for out there? I hear it's pretty wonderful.\r\n\r\nAnd speaking of food, anybody
    for crepes in a few days? I know that Ti Couz is old news for everybody here but
    they seem to still be good based on my last few visits there - admittedly a year
    ago now. And I can usually hear what my table mates are saying which would be
    important to me. :-)"
