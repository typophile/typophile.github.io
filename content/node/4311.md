  on the internet &#40;or in pdf files&#41;? I was hoping to get a better impression
  of how it is best used &#40;being myself very much a typography amateur&#41;, so
  any examples would be much appreciated. Also, is there a good bundle of fonts where
  Wilke is included? <BR> <BR>Here is a link to the Linotype library: <BR> <BR><a

  body: I&#39;ve always wanted to play around with Wilke, but never had a project
    where it was appropriate. That&#39;s a big problem with Wilke; it has a lot of
    &#34;flavor&#34; so you need a project where being that flavorful is okay, and
    that particular flavor fits. <BR> <BR>If &#34;Cthulhu by Gaslight&#34; were to
    get re-issued, Wilke would be perfect for that. It&#39;s a horror role-playing
    game set in the Victorian era, and typically in England. <BR> <BR>Regards, <BR>
