body: Aren't primes and foot marks two distinct typographic marks? I've always been
  under the impression that foot marks (and inch marks, for that matter) have vertical
  axes, while mathematical primes (and double-primes) ought to be slanted. Please
  clarify this, someone! :-)

  body: "They're the same thing.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.unicode.org/\">Unicode</a>
    defines the following code points:\r\n<ul><li><cite>PRIME</cite> (U+2032): \u2032\r\n<li><cite>PRIME,
    DOUBLE</cite> (U+2033): \u2033\r\n<li><cite>PRIME, TRIPLE</cite> (U+2034): \u2034\r\n<li><cite>PRIME,
    QUADRUPLE</cite> (U+2057): \u2057</ul>\r\n(In case the above symbols aren't rendered
    properly on your browser, they're all angled.)\r\n\r\nThere are other variants
    of the prime scattered throughout (reversed, modifier letter, and so on), but
    there is no separate code point for a <cite>foot</cite> symbol. The closest there
    is is <cite>FOOT, SQUARE</cite>; it's defined in the <cite>Miscellaneous Technical
    Range</cite> and it looks like a prime hanging inside an opening at the top of
    a square box.\r\n\r\nThe <a href=\"http://www.unicode.org/charts/charindex.html\">Unicode
    Character Names Index</a> does have entries for <cite>feet</cite> and <cite>inches</cite>,
    but they are simple cross-references to the entries for <cite>PRIME</cite> and
    <cite>PRIME, DOUBLE</cite>, respectively.\r\n\r\nThe <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_(symbol)\">Wikipedia
    article on the prime symbol</a> supports this.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the confusion stems
    from the fact that on typewriters, feet and inches were represented using the
    same upright symbols used to represent apostrophes and quotation marks."
