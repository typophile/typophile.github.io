  body: "When I heard what the author had to say about the book \"The Rule of Four\",
    I was astonished when he claimed that Hypnerotomachia Poliphilii was this incredibly
    obscure old book.\r\n\r\nIn fact, of course, pages from it illustrate many books
    discussing the history of printing, because, along with De Aetna by Bembo, it
    illustrates the early roman of Aldus Manutilus.\r\n\r\nAnother thing about Hypnerotomachia
    Poliphilii that was noted as an indication of its obscurity was that only parts
    of it (written in a difficult Latinate form of Italian) were translated into English.
    This was true, but the book was translated in its entirety to another language
    which cannot be called excessively recondite: French.\r\n\r\nAnd, as it happens,
    the French translation of Hypnerotomachia Poliphilii also appears in many books
    on typography - as just what you seek, an illustration of Garamond in its original
    form."

    of 1592, it will give you an idea of how Garamond's types were used in the 16-17th
    century.\r\n\r\nJean Jannon also issued a specimen sheet with his typefaces, later
    misattributed to Garamond.\r\n\r\nThe Storm Typefoundy has some really good Jannon
    revival fonts.\r\n\r\nPS. Linotype has an interesting 'What makes a \u201CGaramond\u201D
    a Garamond?' page at http://is.gd/54GCX. This page has a link to the Egenolff-Berner
    specimen sheet.\r\n\r\n"
