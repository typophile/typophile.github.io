		<div class="commentbody">The thing you guys should be really offended by is a nation that is practicing apartheid and genocide on a smaller nation they completely control and have lead a brutal 45 year occupation of.  Israel has dropped 250+ bombs on this country in the past week alone, all unprovoked.  They are trying to systematically destroy a population of people, saying they have no choice, when in reality they control Gaza right down to the quality of their drinking water, which per them has been reduced down to only 5% safe for human consumption.  Israel controls where people are allowed to live in Gaza, continually taking more and more of the land for their own, and does not recognize any political party that may form democratically there.  The relationship Israel has with Gaza is the same as the US government has with the Native American reservations.  I doubt if any of you would rush to defend the US if they started dropping bombs on the Native American reservations.  Yes, 2012 Israel = Nazi era Germany.  They are committing an atrocity.

I have changed all my profile pics on all the networks I belong to to this picture in attempt to bring attention to this issue.  This is not an attack on "numerous forum members," but is directly solely at the nation of Israel, which I'm pretty sure is not a member of this forum.

This is all I have to say on the matter. I have no desire to change typophile into a political forum, however it seems that others here want exactly that.  This was supposed to be a thread about marketing fonts.  Who changed it into something else? Not me.  I have made no ranting political statements about this here other than this post, and I will not make anymore in the future.  The avatar will stay as it is until Israel leaves Gaza.  Again I have nothing more to say on the matter and will not respond to anyone who wants to press the issue further.

So, anyone want to actually answer my question?</div>

I think you kinda played maybe a small part in it, like when you changed your Typophile avatar into a bizarre swasti-Star-of-David symbol accompanied by a vulgar, tendentious slogan. This is supposed to be a forum about type.

<blockquote>"This is [...] directly [sic] solely at the nation of Israel, which I'm pretty sure is not a member of this forum."</blockquote>

Which makes Typophile a rather ill-suited outlet for expressing your anger toward them, wouldn't you agree?</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Ryan, you have no idea what you are writing about, which is a very complicated and tragic situation. Within hours after Israel voluntarily withdrew from the Gaza strip in Sept 2005 some within Gaza started shelling Israel, [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_rocket_and_mortar_attacks_in_Israel_in_2001_through_2006|as noted here in a Wikipedia article]]. If they were interested in further withdrawal from the West Bank, this would make no sense, as it is not exactly designed to encourage Israel to continue withdrawal from territories beyond the '67 borders. 

However the continual shelling of Israel by the Hamas-led government (which took over by violence) is understandable given [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamas_Charter|the Hamas Charter]], which explicitly adopts the goal of eliminating the Jewish state, and is full of hatred for Jews, not just Israelis—and has not been renounced by current Hamas leaders. [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinian_rocket_attacks_on_Israel|Gaza has continually shelled Israel since]] Israel left in 2005, leading to the 2008 invasion by Israel and second withdrawal, and then relative quiet for several years. But there has been [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinian_rocket_attacks_on_Israel#2012|escalation recently]]. A country being continuously shelled by another is intolerable, and Israel fighting back against those who have declared war against them and are continually attacking them is understandable. If some Mexicans were shelling Texas regularly, I think we would less see restraint on the part of the US. 

The situation in Gaza is also intolerable, partly due to Israel's blockade, and I am sure Israel has also done bad things. In any case, it is disgusting and horrible that people are dying on both sides, and right now many more on the side of Gaza. But the fact is that Israel is not conducting a genocidal war. If they wanted to do that, they could, and millions would die, but that isn't what is happening. It would also be insane and evil, but that is another matter.  

I am also not saying that the Netanyahu government is right to attack now. I am too far from the situation and know too little to have any wisdom about who does exactly what when. Also personally I distrust Netanyahu. 

But I would say this:  Hamas from its beginning declared war against Israel, and has prosecuted that war in an ineffectual but terrorizing way for many years. When Israel fights back trying to stop the rockets, and with some restraint but also a lot of horror and death, I think it rings hollow to complain about one-sided aggression. Hamas has asked for war by their continual attacks, and now they've got it, for the second time. Because of this background both the US <em>and European</em> governments have not been condemning Israel, though both have called for a cease-fire, which I devoutly wish happens soon.  

I will leave it to more knowledgeable people to write the story of this battle, and to sort out the rights and wrongs, which I assure you are not just on one side. And I understand the fury of those on both sides who are losing and may lose friends and relatives, and their own lives. But please don't spout off from a distance when you have no idea of the situation.</div>

Right, because it is Hamas who migrated in millions from all over the world to Israel, got backed and armed by world’s greatest powers, terrorized Israelis to leave their homes and lands, declared the state of Palestine, occupied every inch of Israel land they can occupy, killing hundreds of thousands of people in the process and making other millions into refuges. Of course Hamas started it, who can’t see that!</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Khaled, millions of people also migrated from all of the world to the US. That includes Jews, Arabs, and Muslims. If you overlay the New York area with a circle equal to the territory of Israel, you will include 80% or so as many Jews as in Israel, but nobody is killing anybody else in ethnic wars. The source of the war is intolerance, not immigration. Had not people like [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haj_Amin_al-Husseini|Haj Amin al-Husseini]] demagogically whipped up hatred, but instead tolerant and democratic processes had been followed, you would have the same thing in the Middle East. There would be an Arab led Palestine with a substantial Jewish minority all working together, prosperous and at peace. 

The Hamas war on Israel is part of being led by hatred, rather than cooperation and peace. If Hamas stops bombing, then building trust and cooperation can move forward. I'm not saying that it will be easy, because Israelis are traumatized by over 60 years of attacks, and are full of mistrust and in some cases hatred, as are Palestinian Arabs. But the path of war is a path to devastation and misery. Simply looking at the conflict as a question of who is the good guy and who is the bad guy, as you have done, is a symptom of an approach that leads to more conflict, misery and devastation.  </div>

The attacks on the two high-rise buildings damaged offices of the Hamas TV station, Al Aqsa, and a Lebanese-based broadcaster, Al Quds TV, seen as sympathetic to the Islamists. Germany's public broadcaster ARD; Russia Today, a state TV network that broadcasts in English; and Sky News Arabia said they lost equipment in the attacks.

Christophe Deloire, the director of Reporters Without Borders' international headquarters in Paris, called the attacks unjustified and a threat to freedom of information. He demanded an investigation into the circumstances of the raid.

Between February 2009 — just after the Operation Cast Lead onslaught — and August 2012, Israeli attacks in Gaza, averaging six per week. They came by aircraft, helicopter gunships, drones, and tanks throughout Gaza; the confiscation of, or damage to, fishing boats and the detention and arrest of fishermen; attacks on industrial, farm, and food production facilities; and military ground incursions.

The current crisis is framed in terms devoid of any real context. The issue goes far beyond which side precipitated the terrible violence that has killed innocents on both sides. The issue — largely forgotten — is one of continued occupation and blockade, a grossly asymmetrical conflict that has deliberately and systematically disabled Gaza’s economy and people.

The Gaza Strip is now in its 46th year of occupation, 22nd year of closure, and sixth year of intensified closure. The resulting normalization of the occupation assumes a dangerous form in the Gaza Strip, whose status as an occupied territory has ceased to matter in the West; the attention has shifted — after Hamas’s 2006 electoral victory and 2007 takeover of the territory — to Gaza’s containment and punishment, rendering illegitimate any notion of human rights or freedom for Palestinians.

The Israeli government has referred to its siege policy as a form of “economic warfare.” In a Nov. 2008 cable from the US embassy in Tel Aviv released by WikiLeaks, US officials wrote, “As part of their overall embargo plan against Gaza, Israeli officials have confirmed . . . on multiple occasions that they intend to keep the Gazan economy on the brink of collapse without quite pushing it over the edge” with the aim of having Gaza’s economy “functioning at the lowest level possible consistent with avoiding a humanitarian crisis.” This was achieved through an Israeli-imposed blockade that ended all normal trade.

The result has been high and persistent unemployment, which stood near 30 percent by June 2012, according to the International Monetary Fund. Approximately 39 percent of Gaza’s people lived below the poverty line in 2011. The figure would be far greater without donor aid.

Gaza’s economic decline is seen in the near collapse of its agricultural sector. One factor is the destruction of around 7,800 acres of agricultural land during Cast Lead. Consequently, approximately one-third of Gaza’s total arable land is out of production. Furthermore, Israeli-imposed buffer zones — areas of restricted access — now absorb nearly 14 percent of Gaza’s total land and at least 48 percent of total arable land.

Similarly, the sea buffer zone covers 85 percent of the maritime area promised to Palestinians in the Oslo Accords, reducing 20 nautical miles to three, where waters are fouled by sewage flows in excess of 23 million gallons daily.

Another critical constraint is water. Gaza’s aquifer has been ruined by prolonged over-pumping and sewage and contaminant infiltration.

Almost all of Gaza’s municipal wells used for drinking water are seriously polluted. Due to the breakdown of Gaza’s sanitation infrastructure, particularly after 2008, this infiltration has led to elevated levels of nitrates and chlorides in the groundwater and soil — far above World Health Organization safety levels — posing a dangerous health risk to humans and livestock.

Israel’s blockade policy restricts the entry of materials needed to repair, maintain, and upgrade Gaza’s sewage and wastewater treatment infrastructure. Save the Children reported in 2011 that Israeli airstrikes destroyed water and sanitation infrastructure valued at $1.3 million.

The impact on health is clear: Just under 10 percent of Gazan children under five suffered from chronic malnutrition in 2010. According to Save the Children, “Diseases of poverty and conflict combined with a degenerating health care system are claiming growing numbers of Gaza’s children.”

Birth defects, congenital anomalies, and cancer cases are reportedly rising. This is likely due to environmental contamination, including the possible use of toxic weaponry during Cast Lead. The current military assault will undoubtedly worsen environmental conditions.

Yet the US government will probably cut funding to the Palestinians if they pursue United Nations observer membership.

Political differences aside, where is our humanity?

In fact none of this current go 'round would of happened if Hamas recognized the State of Israel.

Simple enough for you Ryan?

Do you get the point?

Palestinians aren't the problem ...Hamas is the problem ...period!

Ryan you have three choices...

1. Hamas formally recognizes the State of Israel.
2. The people of Palestine get rid of Hamas.
3. Keep the current tension going.

...your choice, choose wisely.

		<div class="commentbody">@Ryan Maelhorn:
<cite>Israel has dropped 250+ bombs on this country in the past week alone, all unprovoked.</cite>

Since your post was dated November 17, 2012, the fact that the attacks by Israel on the Gaza strip that are taking place <em>this</em> week were not unprovoked, but were in response to missiles being launched at Israel is not directly relevant.

However, even without going to Wikipedia, I see by other posts in this thread that shelling and rockets from Hamas were taking place then too. I would like to see the blockade of Gaza end, but it won't end if it's obvious that will just give Hamas the opportunity to more easily bring in better rockets in order to accomplish its goal of driving Israel into the sea.

Hamas, not Israel, is the obstacle to a normal life for the Palestinian people. Naturally, though, it's going to be difficult to make many of the Palestinian people understand that so that they can take their place as responsible, peaceful world citizens, living peacefully in their own country beside Israel and not attacking it the same way that the people of Finland live peacefully in their own country without shooting missiles at Russia or Germany or wherever.

And what is also shocking is that these attacks are taking place <em>after</em> September 11, 2001. After terrorism had been exposed as utterly evil depravity, after the world has demanded zero tolerance for terrorism henceforth.</div>
