  body: hm. i've found what may be the lower font, but am reluctant to post as it
    is from a questionable source.

  body: i'm sure there is. somehow i can't see an international company doing what
    appears to be high end flooring using a "free" font for their logo. perhaps i'm
    deluded.

    Maps font family, which is also free.

  body: "Many things -beyond outright cloning- can be a good reason to avoid suggesting
    a font. Even a relatively mild EULA violation might be enough grounds.* That said,
    anybody who honestly doesn't think there's anything shady about a particular font
    should definitely bring it up; if somebody subsequently raises a red flag, he
    should re-evaluate its legitimacy, and possibly end up removing the reference.
    It's never too late - at least not when it comes to the big picture: it's not
    really just about not leading James astray, it's about not leading everybody else
    who might read this thread astray, plus not lowering the integrity of type design
    and Typophile.\r\n\r\n* http://typophile.com/node/100481#comment-543123\r\n\r\nBTW,
    I can't seem to find the Titillium Maps font. From what I can tell Titillium is
    a legitimate font, but I can't vouch for Titillium Maps (yet).\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    <em>never</em> about Formal Proof.\r\n\r\nIn this thread I'm not sure what you
    think is going wrong. Personally I don't know what the font is. If I did, I might
    not reveal it because: I don't know the person asking enough to trust them (this
    is something I'm totally OK with others not following); or the font seems unethically
    made/published (and we all need to look beyond the IDing itself to form some sort
    of insight into that, plus be open to changing that opinion - as I have a few
    times recently).\r\n\r\nOthers who seem to know what the font is are keeping it
    private apparently because they're concerned it might be tainted (even if they
    would so enjoy showing off their IDing expertise). To me that is a Good Thing.
    Helping James would be nice, but at what cost?\r\n\r\nWhen IDing is the end and
    not the means, type design and Typophile get harmed.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    for people who are into IDing to elevate their skills to be able to identify plagiarism.
    I actually know a few people who are at that high level, and they used to ID fonts
    here. Now they avoid the ID section like the plague. I wonder why...\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    and not even confirmed commercial font that we suspect was ripped off?\r\n\r\ni
    come here not only to learn by practice, but also to help others like myself who,
    from time to time, are in the position of recreating a logo either for the original

    a rip, under any circumstances, e.g. irrespective of whether it is the one that
    was originally used. The problem is of course that sometimes we can\u2019t know
    this at the time, but becoming better at spotting possible/likely/certain ripoffs
    is a necessary part of getting to know type.\r\n\r\nI suggest that the only ethical
    course of action where you find the font that was used and you\u2019re sure it\u2019s
    a ripoff is that you inform the OP of that fact, and of course not link to the
    find but to the original.\r\n\r\nAs highlighted in this other thread there\u2019s
    a slightly broader issue:\r\nhttp://typophile.com/node/100536\r\nWhat do you do
    if you know the maker to be guilty of copying or outline theft but they may also
    publish genuine fonts of their own creation? That\u2019s a thornier issue and
    each person will have to decide for themselves whether they\u2019d like to help
    support them.\r\n"

    yes, with conscience. but doesn't the designer have to exercise the same? we can
    easily i.d. legitimate fonts and provide good links to them, but don't you think
