body: "I have major problems with typography seen on tickets (movie tickets, boarding
  passes, etc) Maybe someone can enlighten me on the reasons why it's usually so bad.
  \r\n\r\nIs the current technology for ticket printing so outdated that it can only
  do off-register dot matrix patterns? In addition to figuring out the distorted letters,
  numbers, and cryptic abbreviations, the information organization on airline tickets
  could drastically be improved. The logical me wants to believe there's a reason
  for it all. Is there maybe a digital-based foundation to the design of these things,
  like the MICR font? "

    fast, high volume printing, dot matrix is still the way to go. Why the letterforms
    are so poor, I do not know. "

  body: "I would presume the continued use of dot matrix is still used because \"it
    will do\". I guess airlines in particular have bigger issues to deal with. Maybe
    the letterforms are poor because no-one has given these types of typeface any
    serious consideration (there's been plenty of parodies) since the technology that
    used them became antiquated.\r\n\r\nOn the subject of the presentation of information
    on the tickets, it's probably down to who ever set up the computer systems behind
    them. As a programmer,their interest would be in what was quickest and simplest
    for them to set up, rather than what would be simplest for the user. A similar
    thing happens with utility bills, and in some cases, websites. I know Erik Spiekermann
    recently did design work on the tickets for (I assume) DB German Railways."

    body: 'Probably not. There is however a real benefit from considering the way
      they present the other information on tickets, for example how long before departure
      passengers should arrive at their gate. Airlines get hit financially for missing
      their departure slots so making passengers very aware of the need for puctuality
      (and the fact that being late means your bags will get a nice flight but you
      won''t) would be a useful innovation for airlines. '

    in the US. You do it all online and then just check-in at the gate.

  body: "That's a very valid point but I suspect it's slightly culture specific \u2013\_I
    once heard that Americans use planes like the rest of us use trains. Those who
    fly frequently are less likely to be the ones who are late to their gates as they
    are more aware of the dimensions of their airport.\r\n\r\nDespite the fact I work
    on projects similar to the airline ticket one discussed, I agree with the principle
    that there isn't really a need for them."

    tickets in your car on a hot day or they will turn black.\r\n\r\nI don't know
    how that interfaces with typography but I'm sure there are limitations.\r\n\r\nDesigning
    tickets is a pain. I've done many vanity tickets and the amount of legal mumbo
    jumbo they want on the back is mind-boggling. I think at one point I had it in
    sub 3pt type. Couldn't read a lick of it - but it was there and they were satisfied

    way of saying it \u2013 you did. The design of legal information is (and the attached
    ethical issues), I suspect an entirely different thread!  Out of curiousity, what
    do you mean by a \"vanity ticket\"? It's not a term I've come across.\r\n\r\nCheers"

    tix, but every once in a while there is an event that they want a \"vanity\" ticket
    designed for. I don't know if that's the official term, it's just what we call
    it.\r\n\r\nSo it's the same size as a TM ticket except designed. It's like working
    on a miniature painting by the time I'm through including everything that has
    to go on there.\r\n\r\nKind of fun in a super anal retentive way\u2026\r\n\r\npeace"

  body: Great insight, all. Sadly enough, the legal mumbo jumbo jammed on the back
    of tickets, boarding passes, and other documents, is usually the most "designed"
    part of the piece. Though it loses some of the charm and authenticity compared
    to the "undesigned" primary info.
