  body: I'm not sure if it's <em>that</em> common. For example <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/downloads/creative_alliance/sinaloa/">Sinaloa</a>
    is similar but not a match.

  body: 'It may be a font made by <a href="http://www.boodas.de">Boris Schandert</a>
    himself? It reminds me of Larabies <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/larabie/misirlou/">Misirlou</a>
    and the work of <a href="http://www.non-format.com/">Non-Format</a>. If you just
    want something similar you could use Sinaloa (as mentioned), <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/agfa/atmatra/">Matra</a>
    or <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/ihof/p22-bifur/">P22 Bifur</a>...  '
