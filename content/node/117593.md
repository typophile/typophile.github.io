  body: I think you can tell the first letter of a word, but beyond that you'll have
    to let the layout program handle it.

  body: "I think you are asking about \"Initial Caps\"  the first letter of the paragraph
    made very large occupying the top telft corner of the paragraph spanning  several
    lines. They are also called \"Dropped Caps\".  Online they are created by some
    style code like CSS. But I do not know if there is an OT feature to substitute
    for them.\r\nSee  http://desktoppub.about.com/od/glossary/g/Initial-Caps.htm\r\n"

  body: "> Yeah, thats OT, right?\r\n\r\nNo, the layout program is not OpenType. OpenType
    is a font format. The software that does layout is something else.\r\n\r\nInitial
    caps are often the same letters as others in the font, just larger. Setting such
    letters is primarily a feature of page layout (and CSS on the web), not an OpenType
    thing.\r\n\r\nIf there is a desire to make such a letter stylistically different,
    the Titling feature might be appropriate, or perhaps a Stylistic Set. However,
    there is no paragraph-level layout functionality in OpenType today. Setting the
    first letter of the paragraph differently would be done manually, or by a feature
    in the layout software (CSS, InDesign grep styles, whatever), and not at the level
    of the font."

    I wonder who asked for it and what it is used for. It is supported at least by
    the following fonts\r\nhttp://www.fileformat.info/info/unicode/char/2029/fontsupport.htm\r\n\r\n"
