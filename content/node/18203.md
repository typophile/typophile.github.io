  these days? The asterisk, dagger, doubledagger system of marks seems a bit antiquated,
  and I\u2019m not sure if these are internationally understood outside of academic
  texts. Superscript numbers seem a bit boring, and I\u2019m not sure if these would
  need to switch to local numeral forms in Hindi or Arabic text. Any other ideas?\r\n\r\nCheers,

  body: "I've taken a look through a few recent scholarly publications and other non-fiction
    works with notes. In scholarly publishing, there seems to be a tendency towards
    inline citations rather than footnotes or endnotes; in popular non-fiction, endnotes
    are clearly preferred to footnotes, as they have been for some times. The note
    indicator is almost always a superscript number, the size and height of which,
    however, and a remarkable number of publications use fake superscripts.\r\n\r\nThe
    old asterix, dagger, doubledagger sequence was only ever useful for footnotes,
    generally where notes were sparse. Today they are used only informally, or in
    texts where notes are very rare. As soon as you have complex notes, multiple citations,
    etc. you really need a numeric system.\r\n\r\nRegarding localised numeral styles,
    I presume that the numeral style used for notes should be the same as that used
    elsewhere in the text. Use of European numerals is now very widespread, and it
    is relatively uncommon to see localised numerals in use. This is rather sad, especially
    since the localised numerals usually look better withint he context of the local
    scripts, but it is clearly the trend. I guess the implied question behind your
    query is 'Should e.g. an Arabic or Devanagari font contain sups glyphs and lookups
    for superior localised numerals?' I think it is possible that a minority of users
    might indeed find these useful."

    maybe the poker cards simbols or hands with rising fingers to count and mark the
    footnotes if you want to make something \"cool\". Also if printing allows you

    daggers and asterisks for introductory notes.\r\nSome publications use superscript

    I know use the margin like Bringhurst recommends:\r\n\r\n      Text Text\r\n      Text

  body: I saw a really cool book once - or maybe it was an article - I wish I could
    remember what (forgive the Alzheimers), where the word or phrase that needed the
    footnote was in a different color and then there was a corresponding box, the
    same color that contained the footnote. Of course that wouldn't work for just
    any sort of text but it looked great and was very easy to follow.
