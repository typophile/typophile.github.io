I thought the same about the O, trade gothic has the same issue (the O looks a bit narrower) but i have slightly adjusted it anyway.
I also corrected the kerning around V and T (not sure about E-R?), thanks for your suggestions!</div>

A perfect circle does not look &ldquo;right&rdquo; - someone more experienced can probably explain better exactly why - but this is apparent in your O and R. In O, the parts where straight edge meets curve needs to be smoother. You can try nudging your nodes and extending the vertical bezier handles to make the transition smoother and the half circles less perfect round (more of a slightly sqooushed circle). Try the same with your R, only horizontally.</p>
<p>V, E and M are too wide compared to your other narrow letters (or the other way around). In this style, capitals tend to be rather uniform in width.</p>

<p>I totally forgot about the joint of line-curve, thanks for pointing that out, here&rsquo;s how i corrected it:
<img src="/images/old-images/ovt7_5555.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Is the &ldquo;wideness&rdquo; of V-E-M so evident?
By making the M narrower i fear it might become too &ldquo;black&rdquo; compared to the rest of the logo and, while i can adjust again the points of connection between stems and diagonal strokes, that would ruin the evenness of strokes and would result in a less mono-line effect&hellip;</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Optically the bottom stroke of the O and E look a bit heavy. Also the waist of the R is looking a touch heavy as well. The V form in the M is also looking dark. The waist of the E is a matter of taste, but the shorter you make it the more 19th century the letterform becomes. The short waist is not helping the space between the E and R. In fact the VE, ER, RT and TI look too open when compared with the straight-to-straight spacing of the IM, ME.</p>
<p>The O still has some problems at the tangent.</p>
<p>Ed Benguiat first clued me in to the trick of lightening the bottom strokes of letters ever so slightly to compensate for the optical illusion of them appearing too heavy. It has to be a tiny move, maybe only a unit or two in FL. But it does make a difference.</p>

<p>Almost to reiterate terminaldesign, spacing this is utterly key, and since you are <em>drawing</em> the letters you actually have the opportunity to improve the spacing by adjusting things like the waist of the E, or apex of M. If you were spacing a font you&rsquo;d eventually have to reach a compromise between a form and it&rsquo;s spacing but here you can really tweak it. Then know when to stop ;-)</p>

While the first part are loose, the end (TIME) is tighter. At my own, I prefer the second part. So, I would suggest that you tight a bit more OVER. Also, I think your R would be better if you move a bit to the left the top of the oblique, under the bottom bowl or move the bottom to the right.

		<div class="commentbody"><p>I think you have problems here with rhythm, because of the relative widths of different letters. The widths affects the amount of white within and between characters, and this needs to be more visually even to get a good look, IMHO. Normally, the R and T would be wider than the E. My impression is that the E is the odd man out, but probably everything needs to be adjusted relative to the O, if that&rsquo;s the width you want.</p>
<p>I find it instructive to open other fonts&ndash;sans fonts in this case&ndash;and see what they do. Then try OOVOOEOOROOTOOIOOMOO IIOIIVIIEIIRIITIIMII, etc. and play with widths until you think it&rsquo;s all balanced. Since you&rsquo;re only doing these letters, not a font, theoretically it isn&rsquo;t needed, but you might find it helpful.</p>

<img src="/images/old-images/ovt10_6641.png" alt="">
But maybe it should go to the right anyway&hellip;</p>
<p>@William: I tried to compare the logo with trade gothic&rsquo;s letters:
<img src="/images/old-images/ovt11_5774.png" alt="">
The E is 85% of the O, while both R and T, as you state, are wider than E.
I also noticed that the R&rsquo;s leg exceedes the R&rsquo;s bowl, something that my R doesn&rsquo;t do, is that a common practice?
Here&rsquo;s my E and the width it should have following trade gothic&rsquo;s proportions:

<p>I will try to compare my letters to others as soon as i have the time!</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Just checking Trade Gothic (and News Gothic, to which it is similar), I see that the O is rounder and wider. When you do the straight sides, that will affect the rhythm of everything else, so you can&rsquo;t just take widths of glyphs in Trade Gothic as a guide. Though, still, your E is too wide compared to the R there. Also in your first drawing, on the grid, your E and R are the same width.</p>
<p>Not only width, but volume of whites matters&hellip;</p>
<p>Also your idea, if I understand it rightly, that &ldquo;more constructed&rdquo; equals &ldquo;more polished&rdquo; is not sound, I think. Trade Gothic is actually very polished, and pushing it into a coarse grid makes it very hard, if not impossible, to keep the polish.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Thank you William for your advices.</p>
<p>My idea was more of a &ldquo;trade gothic meets DIN&rdquo;.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m trying my best to pay attention to the &ldquo;white&rdquo; more than to the &ldquo;black&rdquo; since, at least for me, it is much harder to see.
I ordered &ldquo;Letters of credit&rdquo;, hope to improve in some way in the near future&hellip;
Here&rsquo;s the latest version:
<img src="/images/old-images/ovt13_5501.png" alt=""></p>
<p>&mdash; OT &mdash;
I have found this font on Gestalten, it&rsquo;s called Regular:
<img src="/images/old-images/gestaltenregular_5860.png" alt="">
is it me or the E is &ldquo;wrong&rdquo; (from what I have learnt in this thread)?

I&rsquo;m not sure about the latest M, with the shorter diagonal.</p>
<p>Instead, you can try a splashed M.
The Angles will reference the V in the beginning of the word, and you will benefit from the white space introduced there.
It can be a little more friendlier and memorable.</p>
<p>Just my 2 cents.</p>
