body: I posted a question a few days ago, and everyone was so helpful, I was hoping
  you could help find similiar fonts to some more hand lettering. The &#34;Spectrum,
  Heaven on Earth&#34; letters are really blocky, kind of similiar to Mojo, but can
  anyone think of any fonts closer to it? Thanks for your help again!<img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/70682.jpg"

  body: Really reminds me of a font from Fontalicious that I can&#39;t quite place...
    Superbly, maybe?  Either way, I can&#39;t get onto Fontalicious&#39;s site right
    now anyway, so....
