  body: I actually quite like Adobe Garamond Pro Italic. It has, in my opinion, an
    unexpected elegance. Apart from that maybe Bembo or Caslon.

  body: "I don\u2019t think a classical lead typeface (Garamond, Bembo \u2026) suits
    best for engraving. It should be a typeface which has something engraving-like
    in the very nature of its style.\r\nOf the well-known this could be something
    like Didot or a classical script face. If you\u2019re looking for something more
    fancy, look at\r\nhttp://typophile.com/node/58746\r\n\u2013 its perfect for engraving
    (and all your other wedding stationary).\r\n\r\nAh, above all: * B E S T _ W I
