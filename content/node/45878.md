  to post on my blog. The idea was to show how every little thing can make a difference.For
  that I counted every word used on the Kyoto Protocol text and created a way of showing
  the different proportions between all the letters used. When I'll post this on my
  blog I will explain all the design process. The type used is Helvetica.\r\n\r\nWhat
  do you think of it? How would you improve it? I'd really appreciate to ear from
  you.\r\n\r\nThank you so much\r\n\r\nPedro Monteiro\r\nhttp://whatype.wordpress.com/\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/kyoto_peq_5860.jpg]"

    The concept is <em>very</em> strong, I just think it needs zazz."

  body: "I think I'm with James. Perhaps it might make something more of an impression
    as a series of posters, each representing different big-difference documents.
    Or different languages into which the Kyoto Protocol has been translated. Just
    a thought. Probably doesn't work with the assignment.\r\n\r\nAlso, the placement
    of the letters within the bars seems problematic to me, especially where letters
    with descenders sit next to thought without. I'm not sure how to resolve it though."

  body: "Hi guys, thanks for the feed back. As for the feeling it was a bit intended.
    I was trying to give it two levels of reading. The first is the literal one, the
    black blocks of proportion. But what I was really aiming for was a second level,
    the one where after you've been 'smashed' by the simple and almost naked feel
    of the message you can go deeper and find out that even if the E block is so big,
    you couldn't have the protocol if there weren't any Z's (35 only).\r\n\r\nSo,
    if you want, for as much as the signature from the USA is needed on the protocol
    (the USA are obviously the E) you still need us mere mortals and Z's to have the
    protocol.\r\n\r\nEric, I agree with your point of view on the placement of the
    letters and has I didn't want to use all caps (because it's not in the feeling
    of a protocol text) it is really my own incapability to find a better way of dealing
    with it. And yes, it is a first of a series of work I want to do around this document
    but mostly because of being worried about global warming. I'll be annoying you
    very soon.\r\n\r\nAll the best\r\n\r\nPedro Monteiro\r\nhttp://whatype.wordpress.com/\r\n"

  body: I find it very interesting. I don't have any say on how to improve it. I guess
    you know it and understand it better then anyone. Makes me think what one can
    do with a BIG halloween pumpkin related to this 'accord'.

    me about the pumpkin because I don't get it :-D\r\n\r\nFor me, one can always
    improve on our work and that is achieved with opinions outside your own. That
    is why I've posted this. If it was your own project what would you do different?\r\n\r\nThank
    you so much\r\n\r\nPedro Monteiro\r\nhttp://whatype.wordpress.com/"

  body: "Hi Pedro,\r\n\r\nWell, I could say I am both. My family immigrated to Brazil
    in the sixties. Then returned to Portugal after becoming a EU member (1986).  My
    great grand father, Cristovam Colombo da Silva, immigrated to Brazil in the beginning
    of the 20th century and worked forever in the railway (REFER EP). He too come
    back to Portugal when he retired. So, yes, I have the discoverer blood.\r\n\r\nAs
    for the pumpkin, it is that the halloween pumpkin is suppose to inspire chills,
    but ends up in candy for the kids. I guess the pumpkin symbol in the Kyoto project
    of yours would add a subliminal 'chill', that is maybe more universal then black
    boxes. The boxes are ok, I just wanted to add a thought to you idea.\r\n\r\nSalud!
    E viva \xF3 Sporting!\r\n\r\nAndr\xE9"
