body: "I made a Times New Roman clone. It's derived from FreeSerif and Liberation
  Serif and I used Fontlab Studio 5 to produce it, but I'm not a typographer by training
  (we don't have the funds to hire one at the moment).\r\n\r\nThe font looks fine
  in print, and it's ok on screen when the font size or screen magnification is sufficient,
  but if I choose a small font size or change the magnification in Word 2010 to make
  it look small on screen, then the letters appear uneven.\r\n\r\nI attached several
  PNG screenshots from Word to illustrate the problem. The first is with 100% magnification,
  the second with 150% magnification. If you look closely at the 12 pt sample in the
  first pic, you'll notice how certain letters of My Serif (temp name) appear shorter
  than others, for example, u i r w x ... The pics also include the same text in Times
  New Roman for comparison of how My Serif should look.\r\n\r\nAt 24 pt size or at
  150% magnification the characters appear level though, and their outlines are even
  in height in FontLab Studio, so is there something I could do to fix this appearance
  issue?\r\n\r\nThanks in advance."

  body: "If this is on Mac, then you probably don\u2019t need to worry about full-on
    hinting. It could just be incorrect alignment zones (possibly inherited from sources).
    That, or possibly bad blue scale values not correctly managing overshoots.\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: Unfortunately this is on Windows and the sources look fine (so not an inheritance
    issue). I take it I need to hint each character, which is something I'll be learning
    as I do it. Is there a quick way to do it, or is this something that has to be
    done one character at a time? fwiw, I applied FontLab's Autohinting (F7) to the
    whole font, but it didn't fix the problem.

  body: "Manual TrueType hinting is done one character at a time. Note that there\u2019s
    a difference between TrueType hinting and Postscript Hinting. Fontlab\u2019s PS
    autohinting isn\u2019t half bad, the other one have a tendency to bloat the file
    size without much better rendering results.\r\n\r\nTruetype hinting gets more
    complicated the older the systems you want to support are, and for text sizes
    Truetype is still unfortunately the only format that \u201Cworks\u201D on screen
    in Windows."

  body: "Correcting the alignment issues you're seeing does not require\r\nextensive
    superhinting of individual glyphs; as was mentioned\r\nit's a much simpler issue
    with vertical zones.\r\n\r\nBTW for older (read: Win-XP) systems in b&w you could
    use\r\nthe GASP table to make all sizes render anti-aliased, resulting in\r\nblurry
    but passable rendering (essentially equivalent to OSX).\r\nHowever some of your
    thin parts might need to be thickened.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    your sources are open-source I assume you won't mind sending the original vfb
    file from which the font you have pictured is generated.\r\n\r\nIf you send it
    over to me, I'd be happy to take a look. (After fixing, I have no interest in
    keeping it or using it for anything - although I might take some screen shots
    for educational purposes -  I'll simply send it back to you and delete on my end.)\r\n\r\nThere's
    just too much back-and-forth questioning involved to handle hinting-related stuff
    like this within a forum thread.\r\n\r\nMy address is rfink at the same domain
    as my blog or at kernest.com.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/richard.fink\">Richard
