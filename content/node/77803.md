body: "So, if I can identify this font that would be great, but I'm guessing that
  it's a custom job, so if I can find something similar, or even samples of similar
  stuff that isn't font based, or EVEN just somewhere to start looking for inspiration
  so I can start from scratch myself, that would be awesome.\r\n\r\nThe main thing
  I want to replicate for a logo job I'm working on is a fun retro script, that doesn't
  look like it's trying really hard to be retro. The thing I like most about the Grill'd
  logotype is that the variation in width across the typeface is very subtle, and
  not overly calligraphic.\r\n\r\nTheir website is http://www.grilld.com.au/ if anyone
  wants to look deeper into it. Any pointers leading in any direction would be much
  appreciated!"
