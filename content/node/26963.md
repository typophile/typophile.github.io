    TARGET="_blank"> FontShop International</A> as FF Isonorm is a type family from
    their FontFont collection. I checked the &#34;designers&#34; section on their
    <A HREF="http://www.fontfont.com/shop/index.ep" TARGET="_blank"> website</A>,
    but the information on Kirchner is unusually sparse: &#34;Robert Kirchner, an
    Austrian FontFont designer.&#34; I know he passed away a couple of years ago due
    to illness.'

    there are not any biographies available. <BR>Just if you are interested, this
    was an answer. <BR> <BR>&#34;Robert Kirchner died in 1994, so all the information
    we have is that he was an Austrian graphic designer who made FF Isonorm. He had
    made the font in 1989 for a client in Austria and offered it later for distribution
    by FontShop International.&#34; '
