  body: "The typeface used above - and which Alaccari was (apparently unknowingly)
    reproducing -  was called, predigitally, Checkmate. The only digital version I'm
    aware of is called Chisel. It was put out by WSI - a company which would sell
    packages of cloned fonts to software makers to bundle with their products.\r\n\r\nGamer
    seems to be very close to Checkmate except that the corners have larger bevels.
    Those corners appear rounded in your image above. I don't know if there was a
    version that had rounded corners or if, as I suspect, the medium used blurred
    those corners."
