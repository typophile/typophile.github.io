  a finnish golfer by the name Henri Lipsanen. The client wanted something simple
  and I don't have much time to do this so simple it is. He also wanted a monogram
  of the letters HL and the colours grey and green.\r\n\r\nThis is my first version.
  Some simple type modification of Insignia with a monogram that is supposed to remind
  you of a golf course.\r\n\r\nAny feedback appreciated.\r\nPeter\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/hl_logo_v1_3416.jpg]"

    about a monoline typeface. Golf says curves and widths variation to me."

    then it looks like 'LH'. \r\n\r\nThe main typeface feels too 'futuristic/techno'
    to me. The quirky features also make it look more like a cheaply made free typeface."

  body: "Thanks,\r\n\r\nI think the typeface works. Golf is a very disciplined game
    and that's why I chose a simple sans-serif with some structure and symmetry. To
    me golf really doesn't say curves and widths variation at all.\r\n\r\nRemoved
    the connections between the letters, which are default on the Insignia typeface.\r\n\r\nAlso
    made a new A and S.\r\n\r\nAdded a simpler monogram.\r\n\r\npeter\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/hl_logo_v1_3521.2.jpg]"

- body: "I like the new type much better. Nice and clean. The green, IMO, needs to
    be just a bit darker and richer - less yellow and closer to grass - fall grass,
    not spring. \r\n\r\nI might try adding the little flag to the first stem of the
    H; in both the name and the monogram? In the monogram, the crossbar break is distinctive,
    but it needs refinement. The remainder of the crossbar looks too short, and as
    a result, the break feels too big. Right now, the space is vibrating rather than
    reaching over the bridge. \r\n\r\nSome of these issues could be resolved with
    color -- right now, the green and gray aren't balanced - they're different values.
    It's not a bad thing, contrast can work well, but I find equal values work best
    in clean Swiss-style design. It's easier to show you what I mean....in this example,
    the matching grays are simply desaturated (in photoshop) versions of the corresponding
    green. I rather like the #5 pair, personally, but all our monitors show slightly
    different shades -- which is another reason matching values is a good idea.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/colors-golf_5687.jpg]"

  body: 'The "S" in #2 is problematic - it looks constructed and top-heavy. Stick
    with #1 (of your second post). For the monogram, I agree with everybody about
    the H''s crossbar being too short. I also think the L''s horizontal bar is a tiny
    bit too long. You could also try dropping the L down a bit to make it more interesting(?).'

    'S' worked well to fill in the gaps created by the P and A, but if you're sticking
    with the traditional 'S' the stroke needs to be thinned. Same goes for your new
    R and P. For what it's worth...the R in your Jan 29, 5:04 post is so beautiful
    it's hard to improve. "

    \r\n\r\nI like the N. I wouldn't change it, unless it's just a subtle change like
    softening the peaks? The only tweak I might work on is the illusion that the top
    terminal of the S is floating upward -- very, very slightly. Actually, now that
    I'm staring at it obsessively, the whole S looks a teensy bit twisted counter-clockwise.
    \r\n\r\n(I wonder if I keep staring at it, it will begin spinning like a pinwheel?
    Hmm....nope. Whew. Insanity averted, once again.)"

    this doesn't work. The space is too small to define the wavy flag, so it looks
    more like a broken shard of glass. \r\n\r\nHave you tried putting the monogram
    atop a tee? (Maybe just the top part of a knocked-out tee?) Or inside a marker
    (the divot tool thingy)? The nice thing about golf ball markers is that they come
    in all kinds of cool shapes and...that's where this logo will end up, anyway;
    on a marker, a keyring, towel and/or glove. Maybe play with the shape of a fairway
    or green somehow? Or just the indents of a golf ball?\r\n\r\nJust some thoughts.
    It's hard not to go right to the golf cliches of ball, club, flag."
