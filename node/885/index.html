		<div class="commentbody">Hey, I personally discuss <!-- raw HTML omitted -->chocolate<!-- raw HTML omitted --> on Typophile! Lettering obviously has a lot of synergy with type, even more than aviation has synergy with boating&hellip; So it's fruitful to discuss it, at length even. I do it myself, to the extent of the little I know about it. But discussion aside, it's not crazy to think that something as singular as a logo on a mass-produced t-shirt benefits by being focused on the topic. The two popular-vote shirts didn't have the superb execution of the jury winner, but they were more appropriate, more in tune with the entity they were conveying. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I might be sounding like a fundamentalist, but focus in a visual piece is a virtue, right? <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->&ndash; <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->I was wondering why the jury chose a lettering piece. Because it was well-executed? Or if you look at the jury members, you might see a tendency to favor &quot;organic&quot; things. I love animals, but if you don't really like type that much, maybe you shouldn't spend so much time with it? John Downer for example is a highly skilled and talented letterer, and he seems to be increasingly focusing on that instead of type design. I still hope he has some great secret type design he'll spring on us (I mean besides Paperback, which so far is disappointing), but if he's more in harmony with lettering, why force it? Focus is good. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->hhp <!-- raw HTML omitted --></div>

The result is the responsability of the organizers* and jury. As for the submission guidelines, I don't think it would have been smart to have a strict typographic requirement (that would have potentially excluded genial non-typographic submissions), but maybe a nudge in that direction would have been helpful. I mean like in your case, since you make great fonts as well as lettering, it might have prompted you to submit a typographic piece instead, and it might still have won! On the other hand, such a nudge would have to be endorsed by the jury, and I'm not sure they would have gone for it. <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->* To be fair, the organizers did a superb job overall (as I've said before).

		<div class="commentbody">Hrant, that's good food for thought. It definitely crossed my  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->(our) minds last year and clearly there are trade-offs.
