body: "Hi everyone\r\n\r\nI'm creating a prototype magazine for a class assignment,
  and am looking for two particular fonts to use within it. \r\n\r\nIt's a sixties-inspired
  magazine, but still contemporary. I want it to look clean and professional - nothing
  that reminds me of Austin Powers!\r\n\r\nI'm keen on Bodoni for headings, but what
  is a sans serif that goes with it? A typeface I can use for the body copy? Any good
  ideas?\r\n\r\n\r\nOn a side note - what are good serif fonts that go with avenir
  or avant garde (or serif for courier new - that isn't helvetica)?\r\n\r\nHope you
  can help!\r\n\r\nThanks"

  body: "Because of its construction, pointed nib pen, Bodoni's sans counterpart is
    something in circle of Helvetica and other \"swiss\" typefaces.\r\nMassimo Vignelli
    had some good combinations of Bodoni and Helvetica - especially in period of 60's
    and modernism.\r\n\r\nAvenir and Avantgarde, that is a bit tough, because they
    are geometric fonts, and first answer would be Bodoni or anything in didone area.
    Avantgarde has its serif compatriot in Lubalin Graph, slab serif version of avantgarde."

  body: 'I think it''s also important which Bodoni do you use. If i think of <em>Bauer
    Bodoni No.2</em> I''d better try Akzidenz Grotesk instead of Helvetica. I think
    a lot of older static Sans Serif typefaces can work in one way or another, Franklin
    Gothic for example.. '

  body: 'Akzidenz Grotesk is great choice, and yes, it is important which Bodoni.
    Also you could risk with Baskerville as serif choice because of its transitional
    character. '

  body: "Bringhurst suggests several traditional combinations. Off the top of my head:\r\n\r\nGill/Perpetua\r\nFutura/Bodoni\r\nFrutiger/Meridienne\r\nHelvetica/Craw
    Clarendon \r\nSyntax/Minion\r\n\r\nI have had success with Helvetica Neue and
    ITC Century, especially due to the fact that they are both large families. The
    trick when combining serif's and sans' is to counterbalance the x-height, stroke
    width, character width, ascenders, descenders, cap height, axis &c. That's a lot
    of different variables. Look at [[http://typophile.com/node/55767|this thread
    on Utopia and Univers]] for a good Illustration. The traditional school of thought
    says go for similarity or contrast, but not in between (shit or get off the pot).
    Utopia/Univers is a good example of similarity while Futura/Bodoni is a good example
    of contrast. If you can afford to, I highly recommend investigating Berthold's
    Futura Serie as it has small caps and old-style figures.\r\n\r\nSome typefaces,
    such as Rotis, have both which can be convenient. And recently, I noticed that
    Font Bureau has a similar/compatible list of typefaces on the right hand side
    of their specimens. Also very convenient.\r\n\r\nAt the end of the day however,
    it's not the font, it's how you use it that counts.\r\n\r\n\r\n<em>(but that's
    just something people with small fonts say)</em>"
