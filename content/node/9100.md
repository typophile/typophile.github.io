body: searching didn&#39;t yield nothing on this subject so I do hope that this hasn&#39;t
  already been discussed. <BR>I subcribed to msn MFV group past month and didn&#39;t
  receive any kind of conformation.  <BR>does nayone here have this  application and
  is willing to share his observation about usefulness, I want to check one OT&#40;CFF&#41;
  font for any possible errors. _Is there some other utilities that does the same
  job? <BR> <BR>thanks

  body: Luka,  <BR> <BR>Microsoft Font Validtor can be used to validate all tables
    except the CFF table. The tools CFFchecker and OTFproof that are part of the Adobe
    FDK for OpenType &#40;AFDKO&#41; can be used to validate the OT font, including
    the CFF table. Also, the Apple ftxvalidator can be used for additional validation.  <BR>
