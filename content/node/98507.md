  going to buy some serif fonts for use on websites. I've seen several by Dieter Hofrichter
  that seem to have an affordable price, a contemporary feel, good quality and will
  also look good in display sizes.\r\n\r\n<strong>Given the list below, what you think
  the pros and cons of each might be compared to the others?</strong> Keep in mind
  that, although I'll be buying both a print and a webfont license, I'll mainly be
  using them for web sites. That includes body text at a 14-18px size.\r\n\r\n<strong>Cala</strong>\r\n[[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/hoftype/cala/|At

  body: "@ Mr. Shinn:\r\nFirst of all, thank you for being so helpful. As usual.\r\nSecond,
    you have small sizes in the four PDFs I linked to. Usually PDF specimens have
    small sized text, you know. Clicking on a link isn't that hard. I added the screenshot
    as an extra courtesy. I thought maybe it would be helpful to see the letters more
    closely. I imagine a trained eye can tell a lot about a face from just seeing
    how the letters are constructed?\r\nThird, if you go to myfonts you can look at
    them however you want. Myfonts usually saves in your browser whatever settings
    you last used in their font specimen tool so if you go there you can look at the
    font with your own preferred settings with no additional effort on your part.\r\nFourth,
    I am a novice. If you really want to respond to my question and are too lazy to
    click on anything at all to see the kind of specimen you want, then be kind enough
    to recommend the type of screenshot you would like to see and perhaps that way
    I can actually learn something from you. Is it long paragraph text? Are there
    any specific words you usually use in a sample to evaluate legibility?\r\nFifth,
    if I wanted to judge these faces solely on the base of legibility then I would
    have asked it that way. But I didn't, did I? My question was general from the
    start. It is in bold. The part about 14-18px is not. I'm curious about anything
    that pops into the mind of an experienced typographer when looking at these faces:
    personality (Does one strike you as more neutral? Does one look more antiquated?),
    flexibility (Does one strike you as more of a workhorse? Does one look like it
    would be easier to combine with other faces?), etc. So it is not all about legibility.
    \r\nSixth, of all the people in the forums you are certainly one of the least
    generous and constructive. You remind me of certain bad teachers I had at university.
    All that wasted knowledge. I am sorry I ever bought one of your fonts and I never
    will again."

  body: "@hrant: Thank you, I didn't know Ernestine. It looks a bit too extravagant
    for me though. Like the sample says: \"fluffy\". I'm just beginning to build my
    library so I'd rather start with some serifs that won't call so much attention
    to themselves. The chunkiness of Ernestine makes me think perhaps I should be
    considering slab-serifs more. Hoftype has one called Foro and Adelle has become
    pretty widely used on web sites. So has Museo but I've grown so tired if it. Do
    you think slab-serifs are better for screen use?\r\n\r\n@pablo: Thanks for sharing
    your specimen tool. Just the other day I was wondering if there was anything like
    that. Seems quite helpful."

    and drop them into the Web-font testing tool ( http://www.impallari.com/testing/
    ) and see for yourself.\r\n\r\nCala, for example, will give you a 8 pixels x-height
    when set at 16px on the web.\r\nIt's not the ideal (a 9 pixels x-height will be
    better) but it's also not bad at all.\r\nIf you use it for web body text, set
    it at 17 or 18 pixels and it will look better. \r\nThey also work well for headlines.\r\n\r\nThey

  body: "May I just request, as both a developer and a reader, that you please endeavour
    to avoid the all-too-common mistake of specifying web text in absolute pixel sizes?
    \ A fixed pixel size is quite likely to be either unreadably tiny or unattractively
    huge (more likely the former) on anything other than the particular range of display
    formats which use a DPI value close to the designer's.\r\n\r\nMy laptop, for example,
    has a display resolution of 120 DPI, and I'm constantly plagued by tiny flyspeck
    text on websites.  I can only imagine what users of these new 200-300-odd DPI
    screens have to deal with.\r\n\r\nIf you really must use a fixed size of text,
    IMO it's better to use points rather than pixels, because (at least in theory)
    that should be translated to display DPI.  I wouldn't recommend even that, however:
    many browsers actually map point size to a fixed pixel size (which is utterly
    broken behaviour, but that doesn't stop them, alas); also not all computer screens
    have an accurate DPI configuration.  (I've seen 15-inch notebooks with 1600x1200
    pixel screens which generally come out to more than 130 DPI physically, but are
    often configured for only 96 or 120, so everything comes out smaller than natural.)\r\n\r\nAs
    a rule, I always use relative scaling for text when I'm designing web pages myself."

    I do think its character is too strong for what I need now, though. As for Mr.
    Shinn, I've seen too many comments like that coming from him in the forums. I'm
    reacting not just to his comment here but to all those other ones as well. You
    know, even before I knew his work I had already memorized his picture because
    of the way he spoke to people. If you have nothing to contribute, then don't say
    anything. Being busy is no excuse. Silence would take up less of his time than
    being a smart aleck would.\r\n\r\n@ Mr. Shinn: I will apologize to you for one
    thing which is not fair on my part: \"of all the people in the forums you are

    nearly enough to know that. But I have seen several comments in which that was

  body: "Pardon me for being so lazy Andres.\r\nI didn\u2019t read all your post,
    just the \uFB01rst paragraph about web type, then looked at the pictures and jumped
    to the conclusion that they were what you wanted an opinion on.\r\nYou said, \u201CHelp
    me compare these four lovely faces\u201D and showed four images\u2014so I would
    say my response in skipping the bulk of text is quite natural.\r\n\r\nYou\u2019re
    asking people for their professional opinion, for free, so why not make it as
    easy as possible for them to help you? Why should I have to click on links and
    download PDFs? That\u2019s too much like real work!\r\n\r\nYou seem to be familiar
    with my posts here, so you should know that I post a lot of images in threads,
    and like to see discussions visually illustrated within the context of a thread,
    so that there is a coherence to them, and people are not required to wander off
    into hyperlink space and get lost browsing. And I usually make a point of asking
    to see a typeface in context, rather than an alphabet showing.\r\n\r\nNow you
    may think that the comments I\u2019ve just made are not \u201Cgenerous\u201D or
    \u201Cconstructive\u201D, but I think they are a reasonable critique of your post.\r\n\r\nFor
    comparison of types in alphabetic layout, it would be better to show them line
    by line, like the following, so that the viewer can appraise them without having
    to look back and forth great distances:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Four_3596.png]\r\nAnd
    rather than an alphabetic comparison, a word or two would give a better feel of
    the typeface.\r\n\r\n(Thanks for your comment, Hrant.)"

    don't be rude\r\nb) read the post\r\nc) try to help\r\n\r\nNo, I\u2019m afraid
    in this context I think skipping the bulk of the text <em>is not so natural</em>.
    After all, it\u2019s not a corporate website that you\u2019re reading. If I go
    to the trouble of writing something it's because I really do think it's important
    for the question I am posing. If you don't want to read it, that\u2019s absolutely
    fine. Simply don't answer. No one is forcing you. You are free to leave and spend
    your time on anything more worth your while.\r\n\r\nYes, I actually <em>was trying</em>
    to make it as easy as possible for others to help me. Perhaps what I did was not
    sufficient in your opinion but that doesn't warrant a rude answer on your part.
    Whatever I might do wrong, I do out of ignorance, not out of ill will. You could
    have written one line of text politely suggesting I change my approach. It would
    have been the same effort on your part. You see, some of us come here humbly hoping
    to gather a few tidbits of knowledge and I assure you we really are fully aware
    of our shortcomings. I want to be better and I want to learn more about your profession
    and I want to use typefaces properly. One would think people in your line of work
    would appreciate that. I don't expect to be treated with sarcasm just because
    I'm not an expert like you. Whether your comment was a reasonable critique or
    not, the sarcasm is completely out of place. How will your work ever be properly
    appreciated if you don\u2019t nurture those who approach you?\r\n\r\nThe next
    time you see me post a question please consider this: I understand that your answer
    is free, but if it's rude and it's not helpful, I think I'll be able to live without
    it.\r\n\r\nNow, to end this in a more positive way, I'd like to thank you for
    explaining the line-by-line comparison. From now on I promise <strong>I'll follow
    your suggestion in an effort to not waste your time or anyone else's</strong>.\r\n\r\nAlso,
    to take this a bit further, I'm wondering if it might be helpful to post some
    guidelines like this for newbies like me. They could be included in \"PLEASE READ:
    Typophile Forum Posting Guidelines\" or in a similar post. Perhaps there are a
    few recurring questions that could be answered more easily if such guidelines
    existed. Would it be a good idea to ask the community about this? Would it save
    you time?"
