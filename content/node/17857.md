  was founded by its proprietor Gerald Lange in 1975. The weblog BielerPress serves
  as a news service for the company. A secondary weblog entitled BielerPressII is
  published as an article and opinion repository to complement their primary weblog.
  BielerPressII was originally published under the name [[TypeRoad]] - a much snappier
  moniker if you ask me.\r\n\r\nBielerPress \r\nhttp://bielerpress.blogspot.com/\r\n\r\nArticles
