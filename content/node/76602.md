body: "'28 Users and 504 Guests online' - it's nice to know Typophile is still attracting
  a crowd. I kind of assumed with so many other 'networks' available that people would
  use this place less and less. \r\n\r\nAlso, it appears that Mr Coles in online twice
  at the same time - multiple browsers? or has he perfected cloning tech?\r\n\r\n:-)"

    regularly) a year or two ago?

  body: The <em>Who is online</em> panel does not shows for me anymore. I'm using
    Firefox 3.6 in Vista 64-bit. But up to some days ago it was shown. Something to
    do with a Firefox update? Is anyone experiencing the same problem?

  body: You're right, Kent! I turned off this option probably due to a mouse slip.
    Firefox is innocent, I'm the criminal I was looking for. Thank you very much.
