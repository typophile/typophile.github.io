body: "When first assigned to post examples of work from three design periods in the
  20th century, the first to come to mind was, my favorite, pop art. Pop art, beginning
  in the United States in the late 1960s, in my opinion is just plain fun. I love
  the use of irony in a lot of pieces, not mention the vibrant colors and a direct
  reflection of the pop culture happening at that time.\r\n\r\nI'm sure everyone can
  guess the name and artist of this piece:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Warhol-Campbell_Soup-1-screenprint-1968_5248.jpg]\r\nThat's
  right, Its Campbell's Soup I by Andy Warhol in 1968\r\n\r\nJackson Pollock came
  to mind next. A lot of his work falls under the Abstract Expressionist period. This
  was happening in the late 40s, early 50s in the United States. Abstract Expressionism
  is described as \"an American post\u2013World War II art movement,\" and Jackson
  Pollock played a big role in this movement. \r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/pollock2_4650.jpg]\r\nThis
  is Male And Female by Jackson Pollock in 1942.\r\nYou should check out this website.
  You too can be Jackson Pollock. You'll see what I mean. http://www.jacksonpollock.org/\r\n\r\nThe
  last period I'm going to talk about is Surrealism, another favorite of mine. This
  movement, beginning in the early 20s, featured unexpected juxtaposition as well
  as the element of surprise. Surrealism was not limited to just painting and design,
  but also literature, film, and music.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/The_Elephant_Celebes_4306.jpg]\r\nThis
  is my favorite by Max Ernst called The Elephant Celebes done in 1921."
