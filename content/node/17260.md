  last roman in its 1499 state - the font, in adulterated form, of the Hypnerotomachia
  - and his 1503 italic for Soncino. 'Faithful' here means avoiding the potentially
  banalising effects of human interpretation; with incunables, it can't really mean
  the copying of selected printed letter-forms. That worked better for Justin Howes
  with the relatively limited variation of Caslon's printed letters than it would
  for the mess of an Aldine page. \r\n\r\nSo I've written a little program which takes
  a large number of copies of a letter, normalises their colour, finds the right offset
  at which to superimpose each on a master-image, blends each with the master, repeats
  the process with the completed master from the first round as seed-image, and then
  thresholds the result to give a monochrome image around which to draw an outline.
  The degree of boldness from inkpress one wants determines the threshold. But I had
  previously had a very helpful exchange of emails with Sergei Egorov on his own method,
  by which tracings from a smaller number of characters were superimposed and an outline
  for the font drawn through the resulting blur. Still another method would be to
  try to model in software the Aldine printing process from punch to paper, which,
  run in reverse, could get to the punch - a thing at least of interest, even if an
  averaged character better represents Griffo's expectation of how the letter would
  look. The question: which method is best, and why? Would another method be superior?\r\n\r\nA
  'p' from the 1501 italic for Aldus is shown here, with Sergei's method shown in
  the second and his end result in the third image. My blended composite is fourth,
  and final image for tracing is fifth. This p shows, I think, something which I suspect
  Griffo practiced pretty consistently in his later work: rotation of the counter.
  I don't have enough data to be sure yet, but it's finding that sort of thing which
  makes painstakingly literalist revival interesting.\r\n\r\n\r\nGeorge[img:sites/default/files/old-images/p-1501.PNG]"

  body: "<em>Would another method be superior?</em>\r\n\r\nI think the best way to
    do a revival is by eye, with a magnifying glass.\r\nWhatever method of revival
    you choose, you are making an interpretation, by the mere act of choice. IMO,
    it is not \"human\" interpretation that is banalizing, but attempts to automate
    the process of interpretation.  \r\n\r\nBy using any system of averaging, you
    are opting for a composite which is softened and blurred, which is counter to
    the visually arresting effect of a letterpress impression. A flat two-dimensional
    photo-reproduction can never convey the <em>bite</em> of letterpress into paper,
    so the digital revivalist has to find some way of compensating, of adding an ingredient.
    But averaging does the opposite. The end result looks crude and ugly, whereas
    Griffo's intent and sense of style is clearly apparent in most impressions --
    the calligraphic ductus underlying the form -- which averaging obscures.\r\n\r\n<em>...even
    if an averaged character better represents Griffo\u2019s expectation of how the
    letter would look.</em>\r\n\r\nIt doesn't. Griffo was well aware that the individual
    impressions of a particular character would vary, and would have designed his
    glyphs accordingly, to account for that variation of the final image. Had he been
    assured of a uniform reproduction of letter shapes, he would have designed them
    differently. More like Bodoni.\r\n\r\nThe variety of serif treatment in Incunabula
    type accomodates the fact that had they been made the same, they would have ended
    up different, due to the vagaries of the printing process. So the reader's attention
    would have been drawn to this deviation from the ideal. However, to make them
    varied to begin with is logical, it disguises the depradations of the printing
    process.\r\n\r\nThere is something disconcerting about a page of Poliphilus, especially
    when it is digitally set. Perhaps not if one only reads it once. But if one is
    to savor the text by rereading, and if one is reading the typography as well as
    the content, it palls. Hence Monotype Bembo, the antithesis of banality.\r\n\r\nSo
    if you want to use digital technology to reinterpret old letterpress printing,
    I think you would be better off exploring the possibility of contextual alternates
    in an OpenType font, to capture the variety of impression, which is an integral
    part of the original design. I suspect that Incunabula printers used textual context
    to inform their selection of a particular sort of a letter, and may even have
    physically \"fine tuned\" some of them, especially the lower case \"r\".\r\n\r\nThe
    long left side of the main stroke has acquired a texture (of paper?) in the original,
    but in both the derived versions shown it is straight. This texture is part of
    the design, like the resonance of the room in which a piece of music is performed.
    You cannot produce a \"faithful\" copy without finding some way of paraphrasing
    this quality of the printing.\r\n\r\nPerhaps you could start with an idealized
    glyph -- clean, sharp and simple outline -- then apply a \"letterpress\" filter
    to it, similar to the way that the texture brushes in Illustrator can be applied
    to a glyph outline. This, and my comment about contextual alternates, is along
    the lines of your thought \"to model in software the Aldine printing process from
    punch to paper\".\r\n\r\n"

      the dullest reader could hardly have been fooled. I doubt that this was the
      primary motivation, when variety of seriffing has so many other virtues. I think
      the 1499 caps are the best proof of this: the serifs are designed to scoop white
      into a convincing counter (L) or eject it (C), thus making perceived counter-size
      sufficiently similar for the caps to make a readable text face - something not
      repeated by Garamond and the later tradition, and certainly not by Bodoni!\r\n\r\n<cite>Texture

      take the averaged letterform, toughen it, and then consistently waver the outline,
      paraphrasing the texture without simulating the actual and extreme variations
      of the printed letters.\r\n\r\nAs for Poliphilus, in 13+ point letterpress on
      suitable paper the only problems I see are in the consistently inconsistent
      weights of, for instance, h compared to m, resulting from Monotype's own attempts
      to paraphrase this texture. In fact I think letterpress Poliphilus is nearly
      one of the very finest typefaces - letterpress Bembo is the finest of all, but
      some of its letters are too wide and so too white (above all y) and its caps
      are a little too Garamondian. "

    to impose: in 1500 departure from calligraphic ductus was thought of as simply
    erroneous. But Griffo was clever, and made small (in this p's case not so small)
    deviations from calligraphic ductus, presumably in order to better unite the word-image.
    My averaging makes this this very clear - perhaps too clear, because the illusion

  body: "Very interesting. I think I've written approximately the same program. I've
    wondered what would happen when applied to very old samples - I know I've been
    pleased with the results I've gotten from originals in the 100-year old range.\r\n\r\nMy
    own approach is simply <em>not</em> to threshold. In my curve editor, I use the
    grayscale averaged image to trace from. In my opinion, there is valuable information
    present in the grayscale which is lost in thresholding.\r\n\r\nLook closely at
    two places you have grayness - the top join of the bowl of the 'p' to the vertical
    stem, and the spur that protrudes to the left. In the first case, it's reasonable
    to conclude that the grayness is caused by varying amounts of \"glutinous deposit\".
    Arguably, the truer shape of the metal can be recovered by tracing towards the
    light side.\r\n\r\nOn the spur, the grayness represents the probability of damage
    to the metal type - much, much higher for delicate projections such as this spur
    than, say, along the edge of a stem. With this interpretation, it should be clear
    that the truer shape of the metal is recovered from a trace of the dark side.\r\n\r\nSo
    when I'm tracing, I leave the image in grayscale, and make these judgements by
    eye.\r\n\r\nA couple of other notes about my \"recipe\".\r\n\r\n1. Start with
    a really high resolution scan. I almost invariably use 2400 dpi.\r\n\r\n1a. Use
    as many impressions as humanly possible. I'm astonished by the difference in clarity
    between a handful and dozens, and again in the jump to hundreds.\r\n\r\n2. I do
    my contrast adjustment <em>after</em> the averaging. There's no need to get the
    paper white pre-averaging, because the contrast of the paper texture will be dramatically
    reduced. In my opinion, this increases the chance of being able to see subtle
    gray variations.\r\n\r\n3. After averaging, I sharpen the image pretty significantly.
    I believe this compensates for the blurring caused by the (inevitable) errors
    in aligning the individual impressions to the master template.\r\n\r\n4. After
    sharpening, I tend to lighten the image so I can see the subtleties in the darker
    gray shadings more accurately.\r\n\r\nNick has a point about variation - you're
    likely to get results similar to what printers <em>would have</em> produced had
    they combined Griffo's punches with the type founding, paper, and printing technologies
    of, say, the 1912 ATF specimen book. If Griffo lived 400 years later, he may well
    have designed his letters differently to suit, but then again, perhaps not.\r\n\r\nI
    disagree that averaging obscures the calligraphic ductus of the original letters.
    I think it lets you visualize an image much closer to the actual shape of the
    metal than can be seen in any of the individual impressions. In some ways, I think
    it's even better to work from the averaged image than if you knew the shape of
    the metal, because the latter was probably overthinned to compensate for the ink
    gain on the press.\r\n\r\nNote, though, that in saying this I'm assuming that
    there was one punch, so each individual letter is a fair copy of the same original
    shape. Averaging together impressions from <em>different</em> punches would, I
    agree, be a travesty. If I recall Sergei Egorov's research correctly, part of
    what he found is that, for many letters, there may have been two or three similar,
    but subtly different, punches. If you carefully classify the impressions so that
    the vast majority come from the same punch, that should take care of that issue.\r\n\r\nA
    \"letterpress filter\" for type is a very, very interesting idea. I've been toying
    with the idea of building such a thing, but the research, both into characterizing
    the letterpress process, and into getting usable digital outlines of the results,
    is nontrivial. How strong would be the demand for such a thing?\r\n\r\nAnyway,
    George, very best of luck with your project. It sounds very much worth doing.\r\n"

    body: "Hello Raph, \r\nThanks for your help, and there goes my patent. Tracing
      from a sharpened version of the blended master sounds like a good idea. To clarify
      what you say about tracing the light side and dark side, presumably you're urging
      that I trace hard against the black at the top join of bowl and stem, but trace
      around the paler grey of the spur, on the understanding that it has been often
      blunted by damage. That would make sense - though it would be nice to investigate
      just how this damage characteristically operated, because I want to avoid unfounded
      interpretation. And Aldine type-metal was unusually good for the time, though
      the press-work was of course generally far below the level of a Ratdolt performance.\r\n\r\nFailing
      to normalise the colour in advance means each letter contributing very different
      amounts to the blend, and also increases errors in superposition. It's a compromise:
      with these scans I think careful normalising is a good thing. I've tried without,
      incidentally. I'm careful not to mix punches - and that's something software
      is very good for. Sergei's conclusion was that mixing of punches was not done
      in a form consistent enough to be aesthetically motivated - more likely an all
      hands on deck response to a big job, or large number of concurrent jobs. And
      the compositors were, according to Aldus himself, a pack of dunces, while nothing
      but good came from the 'daedaleis Francisci manibus Bononiensis'.\r\n\r\nFinally,
      is there a way to automate the selection from scans of all the letters from
      each punch? Cutting them out one by one is a bore. "

  body: If your aim is to capture something of he 'mess of an Aldine page', then I
    think Nick's suggestion of making multiple versions of each letter and using contextual
    substitution to vary their use makes a lot of sense. I think the peculiar sensation
    that I sometimes get when looking at a page of Aldine italic type comes from the
    tension of variation constrained by the typographic identity of each sort. The
    italic text seems to hover somewhere between the chirographic and the typographic,
    in way that the roman doesn't and which later improvements in printing technology
    gradually diminished and erased.

      Veteres, which I expect will be my roman source, inkpress is less noisy than
      in most pages from a Hypnerotomachia, and much less noisy, simply because of
      font size, than in a page of Aldine italic. Meanwhile the Soncino italic, though
      approximately the same size as its predecessor, received better treatment than
      the Aldine: <a href=''http://www.library.upenn.edu/exhibits/rbm/petrarch/petrarch_23-01.html/''

      of the Aldine italic, such that using alternative glyphs to represent the same
      punch might look like affectation, if only because of the obvious artificiality
      of the simulation. On the other hand some Beowulf-style postscript coding to
      provide a letterpress filter would be valuable - as it would be, in carefully
      regulated doses, for almost any text face. Minute variation is good for orientation
      on a page, and the sense that the reader is making progress through the word-stream.'

    What you are planning is a convincing deception. Nothing wrong with that, as it

    isn't around to explain his method. Copying in this instance is not like duplicating
    a digital file. He was digitizing an analogue 3D image, for offset reproduction,
    which requires not just selection, but interpretation. For instance, every digitiser
    has to decide \"how long to make the coastline of Britain\" -- and you too are
    doing that by picking a certain number of specimens to average. The more you choose,
    the shorter the coastline.\r\n\r\nI just had a look at \"The Well Made Book\",
    Updike essays, published by Mark Batty, which is set in Founder's Caslon. Read
    for content, nice. Looked at for typography, one thing that stikes me is the bounce,
    i.e. the deviation from baseline. Howes has incorporated this quality --- I first
    noticed that the \"o\" rides high. That's not mere copying, it's a design specification.
    En masse, it adds to the personality of the page, but damn my typographic reading,
    (which must come into play when passages are re-read, certainly in a book for
    typophiles!), I'm thinking, \"why is the 'o' always up? -- contextual alternates
    could fix that\".\r\n\r\nIt's all about the mise-en-page.\r\n\r\nThere are two
    approaches to \"redoing Griffo's last roman\", engineering or design. The engineer
    would perhaps provide a tool that gives the font-user sliders to control simulations
    of:\r\n- alternate character shape (corresponding to variable wear and sorts from
    different punches)\r\n- paper texture\r\n- ink spread\r\n- bounce\r\n\r\nThe designer

    life, rather than a photograph.\r\nIt was in answer to the question \"would another
    method be superior?\"\r\nThe context was about being faithful.\r\nIf one is attempting
    to make a two dimensional version of a three dimensional artefact, why not work
    directly from the three-dimensional impression? \r\nIt seems to me that the more
    intermediate elements that are removed, the more opportunity for the process to
    be faithful to the intentions of the original type designer.\r\n\r\n<em>...as
    opposed to merely his emotions coupled to a loupe*</em>\r\n\r\nWhy do you consider
    the more direct approach, without tracing over a simulacrum, more emotional?\r\nI
    would say the opposite is true. The conscious effort required to work from life
    is more difficult than working from a tracing; one becomes immediately aware of
    how incorrect one's initial, spontaneous drawing is, and works to modify that,
    in order to get one's glyphs to look right. So the repetititve process of drawing,
    comparing, and redrawing is one of suppressing emotion. It gives a better understanding
    of the original, of why the forms were made the way they were, and of one's preconceptions.
    This enables one to better address the grey areas that are open to interpretation
    (caused by loss of resolution between metal and impression, and variablitity of
    impression). It's here that interpretation is unavoidable, and the draughtsman's
    personality may be expressed decisively, because he has acquired a knowledge of
    the original designer's intentions by going through a similar working process
    of trying to get all the design elements to come together as a balanced whole.\r\n"

    more than the source; this confuses the -intended- results. Unless one's intent
    isn't to do a literal revival - which is great by me, but not the same thing,
    and not what George wants. I find that the best crits are the ones that take into
    account the creator's highly personal desires - not those of the person giving
    the crit. For example, I don't have to like humanist sans fonts to be able to
    make Ricardo feel like I helped him improve Lisboa. In giving a crit, I have to
    separate emotion and method, and focus on the latter. Trying to get people to
    make fonts I would make just makes everybody miserable. Like when I once showed
    a \"progressive\" design to a Famous Designer, and I told him the intent is such-and-such,
    and he come (sic) back to me with a ton of details of how to make it all homogenous
    like him (sic) own fonts, that's just a waste of everybody's time (not to mention

    of the effect of the Aldine page, and he of the type. He clarified his position
    as an interpreter, rather than a simulator, which is fine by me. End of that part

    at all. The reviver can never be photo-exact, but that's not the point, as such

    and the ideal piece of type. The reviver can only be relatively gifted, compared
    to the designer.\r\n\r\n<em>I think emotion is indispensable in anything a human

    don't think you got my point about drawing from life being a process of un-learning
    emotion. The \"magnifying glass\" method is this: Look at the original specimen(s)
    through the lens, draw part of the glyph (with beziers), look at the original
    again and refine the glyph, as many times as necessary. Then do a print-out of
    the same text as the specimen at the same size, and compare them. Then go back
    to the glass and the beziers. And so on.\r\n\r\n<em>Trying to get people to make

    by answering my criticisms, George could be a little clearer in his own mind of
    what he's doing and why. Especially as this is an MA project, and he can expect
    some harsh crits there. I also made a number of what I consider to be constructive
    contributions, rather than criticisms, such as the contextual alternates for varying

    a revival it's important to distill the essence of a design, which comes from
    the forms, not what happened to be in the original designer's head. For one thing,
    stuff in people's heads changes. Should I revive the JB on the morning he decided
    to get into typography? Or the JB the night he finished printing his Virgil? Or
    maybe the JB on the verge of giving up on typography in disgust? It's hopeless
    to approach it that way. So for example when I'm making the British Pound character,
    I can look at what JB made and say \"that was wrong\", and make one that fits

  body: 'I''m sort of with Nick on this one, at least insofar as I consider the human
    eye and brain to be a powerful analytical tool. I find it bizarre that ''emotional''
    and ''expressive'' are instantly assumed to be the predominant characteristics
    of human interpretation, as if we are somehow unable to actually see what we see
    and perform a rational analysis, but must rely on machines to get past our overriding
    emotional and expressive faculties. This is bollocks. I also think Hrant is wrong
    to attempt to try to frame this in terms of his favourite ''art vs craft'' dichotomy,
    as if craft cannot come from the eye and hand: where else has it come from for
    the millennia of human making? We have an analytical faculty and the ability to
    make rational judgements regarding what we observe. Among other things, we have
    an obligation to employ this faculty critically in considering the value of methods
    and tools. Looking at the images in the first post of this thread, the first thing
    I immediately see is that all of the derived forms based on averaging have a large
    black bump in the lower left, while the one photographic image shows something
    quite different; this seems to me to be a problem of method, because the averaging
    does not take into account relative lightness and darkness of the type image.
    Similarly, in the photographic image, there is a clear but very faint indication
    of the full extent of the terminal of the upper bowl where it crosses the stem,
    and this is completely lost in the derived shapes, presumably because it was too
    faint to be preserved in the threshold conversion. So these are just two places
    in a single letter where the human eye tells us more than the proposed methodology
    and tools. This is not to say that the methodology and tools are without merit
    or promise but, ironically, that they must be subject to the same critical and
    interpretative analysis that we can also apply to the subject.'

    simply that italics can be better fitted in that they may require far fewer kerning

    kerning pairs than the associated roman, it meets the criteria for 'better fitted'
    that Nick is using. So what is to counter? He didn't say that this was good for
    readability, in fact he explicitly stated that it might not be a benefit. It is
    simply an observation about the way italic letters fit together as compared to
    the way roman letters fit together. If you consider even one factor affecting
    the fitting of italics vs romans,  that the typical italic <em>a</em> is a cognate
    form with <em>d</em> and <em>q,</em> then you have identified a significant reason
    for the need for fewer kerning pairs. If you consider also that italic <em>v</em>

    discourse through direct engagement with criticism. So even if someone disagrees
    with my criticisms, he or she can further the conversation by responding to them
    directly. But you tend just to repeat your original assertion. You have not once
    even tried to explain why what everyone else calls rhythm is not rhythm, and your
    rejection of that term is based in the very mistake of associating it with flow,
    so the rejection is begging the question. You keep saying that rhythm implies
    flow and therefore there is no rhythm. But I've been demonstrating precisely that
    rhythm does not imply flow -- indeed, flow implies lack of rhythm --, but refers
    to the spacial relationship of letters within words. I come back to this again
    and again because I think your rejection of the term is unfortunate, because this
    spacial relationship is crucial to bouma construction and good notan. At its simplest
    level, the distinction between the rhythm of letters within words and the rhythm
    of word spacing (which you have elsewhere insisted should be even, i.e. rhythmic)
    is key to identifying what constitutes a word. But if word recognition does indeed
    involve bouma recognition, then regular, i.e. rhythmic, spacial relationships
    are also important at the sub-word level because it is only in these relationships
    that role architecture can define recognisable shapes larger than a single letter.\r\n\r\nIt
    seems to me, as I write this, that we have spent a long time talking at cross
    purposes, because you've jumped on the word rhythm with the statement that 'There
    is no rhythm in reading because there is no flow'. We don't disagree about their
    being no flow (although, discounting regressions, saccades have an average length,
    and when they skip words they do so in a predictable fashion, and periodic pulse
    is the very stuff of rhythm; in fact, if there were smooth flow then that would
    really be a lack of rhythm). But has anyone actually been talking about rhythm
    in terms of reading physiology? No, we've been talking about rhythm in terms of
    spacial relationships of letters in word formation. And my 'contrived' illustrations,
    have shown how word formation falls apart if you mess with the rhythm of the letter
    relationships. I've never understood why you have taken so strongly against this
    commonly understandable and accurate terminology. As soon as you recognise that
    there needs to be a relationship between the white space inside a letter and the
    white space between the letters, you are moving in the area of rhythm. This is
    what rhythm is: a proportional relationship. If you are not going to call that
    rhythm, then you'll have to come up with another term, because the phenomenon
    is real, demonstrable, and important to the matters that concern us both.\r\n\r\nGive
    some serious thought to the nature of proportional spacial relationships in the
    way letters form words, and tell me why it doesn't make sense to talk about rhythm
    in letter spacing. I've adopted 'notan' and even 'bouma', and I think you should
    reconsider a term that accurately describes a phenomenon that we need to be able
    to talk about. And that's not terminology for its own sake."

    general terms (like \"ink tends to overextend indentation at this point on that
    letter\"), the positioning of digital outlines, once one accepts the aspiration
    to preserve intentions on Griffo's part of which one is not aware. As Hrant says
    of Baskerville, Griffo's intentions will have altered during his work - that's

    so should remain arguable.\r\n\r\nA further note on \"bite\": the swerves in direction

    of the punches than in most instances from the original 3D page; since a good
    deal of bite comes from these outlines working against one another, as they do

    and depths onto uneven rag paper, a small amount of ink of totally different consistency

    rather beautiful.\r\n\r\nMy concern, looking at the variation is as stated much
    earlier in this thread: it is the variation itself that contributes to the look
    of the letterpress Aldine page, so averaging the variation to produce single letterforms
    seems to me not to be a very good way to produce a 'faithful revival' of the type.
    To a very large extent, what you are averaging is not letterforms per se but printing
    artifacts affecting letterforms. Consider, for example the scan of the third <em>p</em>
    from the left in the four examples a few messages back. In this specimen, the
    spur is very clearly present as a part of the letterform: it is really there in
    a very clean and structural way. Looking at this occurence of the letter, one
    knows for certain that this feature  of the letter is Griffo's design. But in
    other examples, perhaps even the majority of examples, this feature may not be
    so clear. But lack of clarity does not imply lack of presence and certainly doesn't
    imply lack of design. It just means that the impression was very often bad or
    that individual sorts were worn or broken, <em>such that the design cannot be
    ascertained from those examples.</em> This means that you have to apply judgement
    about which samples display the design and which obscure the design through printing
    artifacts. Looking at that beautiful combined image, we can see that what is a
    clear design element in one example is, through averaging of printing artifacts,
    made to disappear: the averaged form embodies the lack of clarity.\r\n\r\nTo me,
    this suggests that the averaging methodology has merit relative to the careful
    selection of input. There needs to be an analytical process to determine which
    specimens show forth the design, and which are simply poor specimens."

    of its spur, and I think it shows some perhaps unknowable degree of merely random
    ink-press. We need something to sway us besides aesthetics - Griffo might chosen
    to make only a little spur. So we turn to the averaged master and see that, as
    one might anticipate knowing the properties of softish metal, beyond the spur
    and also to the right of the descender serif there are darker pale-greys - ie
    more than background-random cases of ink impression in these regions, implying
    that yes, these projections have been blunted and should be restored, according
    to judgement. On the other hand if one chose to believe that the splurge on the
    bottom of the second p of the four was a ravishing example of Griffo's real intent,
    lost in too many instances by blunting, then one could check this aesthetic choice
    against the average and see that the progression from darkest to lightest is much
    quicker moving vertically down from the serif than to the right of it, so that
    the descender of the second p is simply botchy. \r\n\r\nAlmost all the impressions
    are visibly poor in some part or other, and when errors coincide it can be hard
    to see them as such - in other words two 'p's can both look convincingly perfect
    but be wholly unlike. Thus in selecting good material one must be careful not
    to exclude too much, though in moderation I'm sure it's sensible, and I have done

    forms in the results; they are ALL\r\nimperfect instances; and the more instances
    you average the\r\nmore you remove the arbitrariness.\r\n\r\n(I remember once
    having a similar discussion with you concerning\r\nwhat pairs to kern; somebody
    advocated using Google to form lists\r\nof pairs, but you pointed out that that
    would include pairs from\r\nincorrectly spelled words; at which point I put forth

    this type of effort.\r\n\r\n> averaging gives inkpress radiating to equal distances
    from the metal\r\n\r\nNote however that ink spread can be asymmetrical, and for
    more reasons than one. One reason is the paper: it can hold/spread ink differently
    in each dimension; see this example from a low-grade Armenian newspaper:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.themicrofoundry.com/other/armnews2.gif\r\n\r\nAnother
    issue is slur: if you might end up using a cylinder press (something Aldus of
    course didn't use) to reproduce/test these forms, the looser your makeready the
    more your gain will be greater in the vertical direction than the horizontal.
    This is especially if you apply extra pressure (see below). In the end, every
    little thing affects the results; maybe even the use of ink rollers instead of
    what they used then: ink balls.\r\n\r\nBTW, something I've been meaning to point

    effect (that a scanner can't show**) is that the more impression pressure a piece
    has the less faithful it is to the type! Which is sort of self-defeating. Quite

    actually explainable in terms of inking and impression.\r\n\r\nI think when looking
    closely at specimens of printed type, you have to make reasonable assumptions
    based on the competency of the punchcutter. The more a specimen looks like a complete
    letterform, like a well balanced and resolved design, the better a specimen it
    is. You have to assume this if you consider the punchcutter to be good at his
    job, and you can most often confirm this by looking at his larger sizes of type.
    If these look well designed, you can be reasonably sure that his smaller sizes
    were also. So if you are looking at fragmentary specimens in which the design
    seems weak and unbalanced, and you compare these to specimens in which the shape
    is clearly defined, then you have to consider that the latter show forth the design
    better. Yes, this requires a judgement call, but I don't think it is arbitrary:
    it is reasonable. Also, it is often easy to tell what are the prestige publications
    of a particular printer, those that have been printed with more care and attention,
    and these will provide a better quality of specimen than cheaper editions produced
    with less care.\r\n\r\nI don't think pre-selecting specimens is anathema to the
    averaging concept: it is a methodological modification. In fact, a useful exercise
    would be to perform averaging of both pre-selected and of randomly selected specimens,
    and compare the results of these. You might also have different people perform
    pre-selections, and combine the resulting set of forms. There are lots of ways
    in which one might play with the methodology. I think it is too soon in the day
    to say that it has to be done in one way only.\r\n\r\n\r\nI agree with you that
    one should not presume equal inkspread, even on a flat bed press. Letterpress
    impression displaces paper mass, and since paper is not of perfectly uniformly
    density, the displacement from one letter may be more than from an adjacent letter.
    Also, type was being inked using balls, not rollers, and even inking was virtually
    impossible. So one part of a letter might have more ink on it than another.\r\n\r\n<em>(I
    remember once having a similar discussion with you concerning\r\nwhat pairs to
    kern; somebody advocated using Google to form lists\r\nof pairs, but you pointed
    out that that would include pairs from\r\nincorrectly spelled words; at which
    point I put forth that there\r\nreally is no \u201Cwrong\u201D or \u201Cright\u201D:
    if the pair happens, it means\r\nit exists, and that\u2019s all a type designer
    needs to know.)</em>\r\n\r\nI think that must have been someone else, because
    my approach to kerning involves using test words that, for Latin at least, include
    examples of every possible combination. Including Exxon :)\r\n\r\n"

    the type anyway.\r\n\r\n> I\u2019m not actually convinced of that.\r\n\r\nOK,
    let's think about this a little bit more deeply and with open minds.\r\n\r\nIf
    you want to make offset output that comes as close as possible to this particular
    source (ignoring for the sake of argument the factor of impression depth*) you
    would have to incorporate the irregularity into the letterforms/type. The ways
    I can think of doing this are: 1) Have a base glyph stucture and apply pseudo-random
    irregularity to it (render-time), in a way that mimics the original. This is not
    possible in current generally available font technology. 2) Choose a finite number
    of instances of the source glyphs and deploy them pseudo-randomly. This is doable
    with OpenType. 3) Create a finite number of variants pseudo-randomly (as in #1)
    and deploy those pseudo-randomly using OT.\r\n\r\n* Which however you've said
    -rightly- is an integral part of the way Aldine typography looks/feels.\r\n\r\nWell,
    #1 and #3 require averaging. And #3 has the advantage over #2 that it removes
    a selection process that cannot be informed by the true intentions of the original
    designer. Basically, #2 is the furthest from replicating the original.\r\n\r\nThe
    thing is, impression depth is very important here. If you want to get <cite>really</cite>
    close to the original, letterpress variance takes care of the irregularity inherently
    and \"naturally\". At which point the type doesn't need to exhbit irregularity
    (which is a good thing, because technically it can't) and that makes averaging
    useful here as well.\r\n\r\nMultiple glyphs per character in the original:\r\nThat's
    different than irregularity. It's certainly useful to be able to group various
    instances of a letter as different original designs, but here again there's no
    reason to introduce the reviver's preconceptions (in a literal revival). What
    you would do instead is algorithmically decide on an instance-by-instance basis
    which variant of a character an instance is, and then average them separately.
    You might do this by determining thresholds within which an instance is a certain
    glyph and outside which it's another; and these thresholds might be determined
    by some iteration with models for which perhaps we do know the \"punch history\".
    Yes, it's error prone, but at least it's a \"neutral\" error, one that becomes
    absorbed if you process enough specimens (unlike personal interpretation, which
    just gets amplified).\r\n\r\n> Yes, this requires a judgement call, but I don\u2019t\r\n>
    think it is arbitrary: it is reasonable.\r\n\r\nMaybe arbitrary was a bad word.
    My point was that -no matter how\r\ngood or bad the punchcutter was- there's no
    safe assumption about\r\nwhat he intended - not in a literal revival.\r\n\r\nOne
    could say that a literal revival cannot benefit\r\nfrom intent; instead it spawns
    directly from matter.\r\n\r\n> it is often easy to tell what are the prestige

    is almost never the printer,\r\nso you can't know if he agreed with the results,\r\nor
    he intended them (assuming he even cared to get\r\ninvolved in the results, which
    is not the same thing\r\nas not having any intent).\r\n\r\nThis business of extracting
    intent really seems\r\nto make a horde of romantic assumptions that to\r\nme are
    counter to the intent of design, at least\r\nin the case of a literal revival.\r\n\r\n>
    I think it is too soon in the day to say that it has to be done in one way only.\r\n\r\nLike
    has been repeated, averaging is a tool. And yes, tools can be used  differently
    depending on what the desires results are. I think in the case of a literal revival
    like this one, interpretation should be actively limited (not the same thing as
    saying it can be completely avoided). And in any case averaging shouldn't be shunned
    - that's what mainly motivates my own participation in this thread actually.\r\n\r\n>

    of the few things about 15th C printing which makes my life easier is that hand-made
    paper will <cite>on average</cite> receive ink equally in all directions, because
    the fibres lie randomly. \r\n\r\nEssentially I agree warmly with Hrant that more
    input is better than selected input, with the qualification that I would recognise
    some obvious classes of impressions as plain misprintings, like the initial on
    verso and final on recto letters of lines. These I have left out. One other class
    worth excluding is letters the variance of which from the norm built up in the
    first round of averaging is bizarrely high: I think this probably implies a different
    punch (only one case from the 2 sides and 61 examples which were picked out to
    produce the averaged image you've seen). Punch variation is rare and inconsistent
    in Aldine printing so, contra Mardersteig, I doubt that it was intentional. It'd
    be hard to justify on any grounds the Lascaris interlopers among the 1499 caps
    in the Hypnerotomachia, for instance: they're fat lumps compared with the new
    letters; still more obviously wrong is the appearance of Roman caps among Greek,
    and vice versa. Punch variation is in any case much easier to spot with software
    that can quantify variation than by eye; and because the distribution of extent
    of variation is bell-curve normal there really aren't any samples which could
    plausibly be considered exemplary. But paper shrink is a problem which might make
    taking samples only from some arbitrarily limited central region of the page,
    where shrinking is least, a good thing.\r\n\r\nI have to say that I think Hrant's
    straw-man method #2, the choice of a finite number of instances of source glyphs,
    pseudo-randomly deployed, would produce (and is) just embarrassing junk. \r\n\r\nI
    have Burnhill's book, John; it's main relevance to my project is in making me
    doubt the propriety of altering vertical proportions (for the original roman,
    o is 5 units tall, H 7, h 8, y 8, with 1 unit of interlinear space) through MM.
    Note that o is as usual slightly taller than x, such that one cannot quite accurately
    say that x-height is five sevenths of cap height. Can these proportions work at
    10 point, I wonder? As for deciding by eye what impressions look good: the software
    numbers show clearly that the eye is no judge, because of the misleading attractiveness
    of errors in successful combination. \r\n\r\nPeter, once one makes one's reduction
    of Griffo's extant work to principles of construction sophisticated enough to
    incorporate \"feature-awareness-based\" analysis, one is giving oneself too much
    room for interpretive manoeuvre. The method ceases to be a method at the very
    moment it becomes justifiable."

    could expect to faithfully reproduce a typeface from a letterpress printed specimen.
    \r\n\r\nThere are a legion of problems. First of all it is difficult to find an
    Aldine specimen that hasn't been cleaned over the years. Cleaning takes out the
    impression. While this may resolve a certain discrepancy caused by the camera
    interpreting slope as 2-D it allows problems such as ink spread to be misinterpreted.\r\n\r\nWooden
    common presses were not a manufactured item and differed greatly one to another.
    And any publisher with the printing capacity of Aldus would likely have had many,
    many presses working on different sections of the same book.\r\n\r\nThere are
    other problems, variance in the paper, not only sheet to sheet but within the
    sheet causing characters to print lean or fat without reference to inking. Dampening
    the sheet (required with handmade papers) also introduces variance in the way
    the letterforms will appear due to the way the ink is accepted by any particular
    sheet (there is no way to make dampening standardized sheet by sheet). \r\n\r\nThere
    are inking problems not only as the result of ink spreading beyond the letterform
    (due to problems in proper visconsity and application) but in the technique the
    pressman used in applying the ink. As someone mentioned previously ink balls were
    used rather than rollers (first use of rollers was 1812). There is a significant
    difference (not better nor worse) in the way letterforms respond to these differing
    tools.\r\n\r\nVariance in impression, due to makeready or wear on type or problems
    in composition or lock-up will also effect the look of the letterform.\r\n\r\nAnd
    there is often the likelihood, in earlier printed work prior to standardization,
    that multiple punches were used to create the \"letters.\"\r\n\r\nThe search for
    some form of standardization is wrong simply because there is no initial form
    of standardization. There is only variance, and to some extent, particularly with
    the early printers, that was the whole point of it, whether there was a choice
    in the matter or no.\r\n\r\nThe only true way to capture a letterform from the
    past would be a carbon proof from the punch itself or find an exacting way of
    capturing the letterform directly from the punch.\r\n\r\nOnce it goes to print,
    all bets are off. While I can applaud the interest and research I cannot imagine
    that any result could be satisfactory. If the intent is to be \"faithful.\"\r\n\r\nGerald\r\nThe

  body: "I made, after reading Nick's and Raph's first posts, two changes to my position.
    First, having been undecided, I accepted that autotracing of the averaged form
    is unhelpful because, in preserving equally emolliating and merely emboldening
    inkpress, it misprepresents the perceived bite of the original. Second, I accepted
    that the averaged master image contains information which should be preserved
    and analysed in making decisions about the drawn glyph - information about likely
    features of the punch which are misrepresented in most impressions, because cast
    type degrades in predictable ways. Finally, I was culpably unclear in phrasing
    my initial post. Avoiding those acts of interpretation which are potentially banalising
    remains a goal: I dislike the fatalism surrounding interpretation (of which I
    don't accuse you): the repetition of truisms like \"you've got to interpret\",
    or, with more relativist conviction, that one's work is \"just your interpretation\",
    because the usually unstated assumption is that all interpretations are alike
    in the merit of the hypotheses they imply. But this is untrue, doubly so with
    newly available tools providing new kinds of evidence, but always so with the
    application of knowledge of the printing process (on which I'd love more detail,
    or recommendations of books on Aldine or incunable printing). What produces banal
    results is the kind of thinking that goes: Griffo was presumably a sensible man,
    and should have been if he wasn't; and sensible men know that typefaces are best
    when they're like <cite>this</cite>, or when they are consistent in <cite>this</cite>.
    As Justin Howes wrote, \"In our own time, the result of redrawing is, unavoidably,
    type design which edges ever closer to this period\u2019s dominant letter form,
    Times New Roman\". He tried to resist that with a method which was clearly, as
    he knew perfectly well, unconvincing in one respect (its variation is frozen),
    but nonetheless he succeeded better than almost any reviver in providing as fully
    as possible, given current limitations, what his model had provided to an ealier
    generation. I'll take a different path in pursuit of the same ideal. And I shan't
    mind if it's never used at all; I'd be perfectly happy if it were only something
    for me, and I hope others, to study. As I've said, though, a secondary purpose
    for it is in fine book work, for which sized variants will be provided."

    images which retain sharpness in some areas, but lose it in others. \r\n\r\nThere
    is some logic to this, in that the \"protected\" areas of the type, eg hairlines
    at joints, are more likely to retain fine detail than \"exposed\" parts of the
    type, such as serifs on stems, which tend to blobbyness. (There is more pressure
    here, as the paper is stretched over the neck of the type.)\r\n\r\nThis variety
    of image quality, with its slight unpredictability, is a pleasing effect.\r\n\r\nBack
    in the day, type designers took this into account, which is why vertical stems
    on M, N, V etc. were able to be so fine, and the letters proportioned accordingly.\r\n\r\nOne
    way to \"parse\" the effect of letterpress is to mix sharp and soft detail.\r\nIn

    good thing: it makes the counters as robust as rubber pillows, with their own

    genius type design has ever produced* is free from all constraint. He can make
    the letters he wants, and print them how he wants them. He would die almost immediately,
    but first produced at least two editions, a Boccaccio and Bembo's Gli Asolani
    - the latter appropriately, since Griffo may well have known Bembo personally
    from the time when the future cardinal was taking a keen interest in the production
    of De Aetna, for which Griffo cut his first mature alphabet. \r\n\r\nI finally
    tracked down that third italic. The reproduction's ghastly, but what a disappointment!
    It looks like a Tony Stan ITC Aldine! Having said that, it should have been very
    readable with that astonishing x-height to line-increment ratio, and it's unmistakably
    Griffo in, amongst many other things, the low-slung lowercase a, a readability
    master-stroke that appears in all his italics.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/GI3.JPG]\r\n*That's

    One can''t get a strong sense in seeing the Aldine page that one character is

    it would be lost among the inequalities of weight that come from the printing
    process. Griffo may even have chosen to cut variety of weight into his punches
    knowing that in printing these differences would have been greatly diminished.

  body: "George, let be a little more clear on the danger of aiming at a 'faithful'
    or authentic revival. \r\n\r\nFirst, you have yourself said you are not going
    to do this fully, in the sense that you are not trying to revive the look of the
    aldine page, with all of its variations. So what you are in fact doing, despite
    protestations of striving for authenticity, is trying to revive features of the
    typeface that you regard as good or desirable ones. And, as David Berlow pointed
    out, using a computer does not remove your personal choices as you are telling
    the computer what to do--to average in a certain way, rather than to pick out
    the 10 most common shapes of a given glyph, for example.\r\n\r\nLike you, I do
    think that there is much worth reviving in old typefaces. But my point is that
    reviving the worthwhile is a process of hypothesis testing. You can identify a
    feature, and then draw it in various ways, and see if it is actually responsible
    for what you liked in the typeface. It may be, or it may not be. Once you are
    aware that you are engaged in a creative process of guess work and trial and error
    to get the effect you admired in the original, then you free your imagination
    and intellect to create a lot of hypotheses, and test them. If your goal is 'authenticity',
    you can easily limit your hypothesizing, thinking that one tool, whether it is
    scanning or averaging or something else give you the 'authentic' result.  \r\n\r\nYou
    are already engaged in that creative hypothesizing, of course, so my urging is
    just to not let the goal of 'faithfulness' limit yourself to your first hypotheses,
    or one method--averaging or whatever--to such a revival. Such methods are valuable
    tools, but in the end your creative ideas about what is good in the typeface and
    your testing of your ideas will make your effort fruitful.  \r\n\r\nIncidentally,
    in another thread you I think rather underestimate the power of graphic design
    compared to type design. The look of a page is as much or more influenced by layout
    as by the typeface. So the way the Aldine page was laid out--the size of type,
    the leading, the measure etc. may well be a part of the impression you admire.
    Especially as Peter Brunhill found it worth the effort to figure out the system
    of proportions Aldus was using, it is likely this is in fact important. \r\n\r\nAlso,
    size matters. Some of the much admired old text samples--including yours?--are
    at rather large size. You cannot scale these down and get the same visual feel.
    So if you are aiming at a typeface family that can actually be used in a practical
    way--or in gaining knowledge that you or others can use for such a purpose--you
    will be faced with scaling issues. "

    hope to revive is a combination of very subtle features, varying from letter to
    letter, which could not but be bulldozed by any heuristic process of feature identification
    and redrawing. The time for heuristically developing my judgement is, in this
    project, afterwards, in choosing how much emolliating inkpress should consistently
    be removed, and, if necessary (as I hope it will not be), how much the weight
    of characters should be made similar, in order to get a combined effect resembling
    the original in bite and harmony, while preserving intact the combinatorial effects

    proportions aren't, with Bringhurst to hand, rocket science, and Aldine leading
    (1/12th of the line increment) will be incorporated into the fonts, as it was
    by Griffo. As for size, the horizontal and vertical proportions of the originals
    will be exactly replicated at ~15 and ~12 point for roman and italic respectively,
    and horizontal proportions and relative size of irregularities will be modified
    for optical similarity at other sizes using MM."

    you are after, which is impressive. I do think, as it seems you suspect, that
    you will find that when it comes to actually doing the face or faces, there are
    thousands of decisions to be made, and your concept will be refined and sharpened,
    and maybe changed by your new ideas and test designs. \r\n\r\nMy main point in
    posting on this thread is to make clear that the process of making a good revival
    is by no means an automatic process you can program. It takes many creative decisions,

  body: Yup, absolutely. And for the same reason - that a revival of something is
    not the same thing as the original - I think it's false modesty to name a revival
    directly after the original's punchcutter or printer, as Morison did with his
    infamous "recutting"s; this will either be called Horton's Griffo or something
    more vaguely suitable, like Astrophel - correctly reminiscent of Poliphilus, but
    pointing at a different book, the Scriptores Astronomici Veteres; and alluding
    more plainly to another Englishman's appropriation of the Italian Renaissance,
    Sidney's Astrophel and Stella, which was modelled on Petrach's Opere Volgari,
    for the printing of which Griffo made the italic I'll be using.

  body: "I didn't know you were interested in microproperties - I thought you trusted
    more to the role-architectural. Griffo's romans may fairly be called transitional
    between Jenson, whose matrices Aldus acquired by marriage, but chose not to use,
    and de Colines etc. Griffo's Lascaris roman, his 'prentice work, is a typical
    sub-Jenson Venetian. But with the 1499 caps Griffo is zipping off in a direction
    in which no one would follow him. Digital Poliphilus is just about accurate enough
    to see what he was doing, though, in approximately descending order of fakery,
    YRXJKZMNSQP are inaccurate (every single one of the changes seems to me a clear
    worsening). The widths are completely reset without much reference to either monumental
    or Venetian norms, and the cleverest seriffing I've ever seen is applied to bring
    the counters into readable relations with one another: this is the only alphabet
    of caps I'd want to read a book in. Such capriciousness is systematic. In the
    roman lowercase in its \"completed\", coherent state of 1499, I think serif capriciousness
    is more Jensonian, partly matching sidebearings (as in Goudy Lanston), and partly,
    along with variation of axis and vertical alignment, there for divergence's sake.
    I'll have a clearer idea of this when my Scriptores leaf arrives in a few days.
    I have no doubt at all, from the relatively low-res Hypnerotomachia scans I've
    studied, that Griffo was systematic about axis variation between similarly shaped
    letters.\r\n\r\nBut with Griffo's \"norm-violations\" we need to distinguish between
    different norms - modal Venetian forms, modal Venetian capriciousness (substantial),
    modal MS forms (very varied and influenced by fashions - there was no \"humanist
    roman\" style, they even had a wave of vertical-axis, geometric-bowl work which
    Hrant might call Modernist), and modal MS capriciousness (which could be low but
    which was obviously potentially very substantial). The clear departures from all
    the preceding Venetians and MSs in Griffo's mature work are narrowness, variety
    of axis, perhaps rotation of the counter, modification of serifs on open counters
    (with counter understood as any white space within the rectangle of the letterform),
    and small-eyed lowercase g. Griffo's capriciousness is not in itself norm-violation
    since everyone was doing it. The flat bar on e is not a violation of MS practice,
    though it is one of type-design practice. Making italics at all is obviously a
    violation of type norms, but not of MS norms. Likewise with a small but important
    feature of Griffo's work: stems are more equal in width from top to bottom than,
    following lapidary examples, type designers of sufficient skill tended to make
    them (Jenson, Centaur and Requiem are all waisted in this way). So:\r\n<cite>Are
    you hoping your averaging mechanism will converge on a definable or characteristic
    set of holotypic (Bringhurst\u2019s term) microproperties applied across the glyph
    set?</cite>\r\nYes."

    or the oracle at Delphi, a grounded understanding of perceptual processing in
    reading, and a tabulation of the perceptual processing impact of manipulating
    typeform microvariables, are maddeningly elusive and the literatures surrounding

    ambage viarum</em> [ conflicting maze of wandering paths ], but, when it comes
    to tabulating impacts of manipulating of typeform microvariables, virtually non-existent.\r\n\r\nThe
    question I ask is: where, relative to receptive-field behaviour in the visual
    cortex, is the inflection-point between 'optical grammatical' and 'gestural atmospheric'
    matters, when it comes to tabulating the perceptual processing impact of typeform
    microvariables.\r\n\r\n<em>Emigre</em> talked in the 1990s of type designers of
    that time as having a collective sense being 'primitives of the new era.' Griffo
    and his contemporaries and predecessors were the primitives of the metal era.
    I have often felt that cutting punches changes one's relation to the letterform,
    from a ductal routine empahasis to a situation where form-analytic featural evaluation
    begins to play a direct role in the very process of cutting. So there arises a
    tension between 'chiro-referentiality' or 'chiro-paraphraxis' and form-analytic
    based feature manipulation. This might be what you mean in talking about 'typographic'
    properties. This much I grant Hrant: feature manipulation based on form-analytic
    feature evaluation beyond strict chiro(para)phrastic contrast manipulation has
    a positive role to play. \r\n\r\nBut it seems to me that it is the relation of
    these two countervailing pressures that is being sorted out in this cricible where

  body: Thanks Peter. In the French old styles of the second quarter of the sixteenth
    century ductus is filtered through a static set of conventions, which reduced
    the real range of thicknesses given by the pen at different angles to a set optical
    thick and a set optical thin, modulated between on curves, and made serifs lachrymal
    or bracketted instead of the (slightly) more pen-formed straight or concave slabs
    of the Venetians. That is the punch-cutter's feaure-manipulation in its most normal
    form. Griffo's transformation of ductus is, by contrast, not regularising but
    actively divergent; his motivation for departure seems to have been quite opposite
    to his imitators'. (That said, in his italics he had to be more circumspect, because
    the whole point of that venture was to pretend to imitate the natural style of
    writing for oneself or a friend. Thus Q was given back its normal axis rather
    than the counter-clockwise rotation it had in 1499, though it seems that subtler
    things were going on in interior axes).

  body: "Peter ponders:\r\n<cite>yet the Griffo averaging process seems to average
    a higher level of degradation,</cite>\r\n\r\nWell, this is easy enough to understand
    on one level. Gain is nice and erosion is nasty. Oddly enough, the project I'm
    working on right now for work is compensating for a white-writing LED photoconductor
    printing technology that has erosion, so I need to add gain to the digital image
    before printing it. Most laser printers have black-writing technology (and a more
    complex two-component toner technology to support it), and have <em>plenty</em>
    of gain to show for it.\r\n\r\nThe <em>averaging</em> process undoes quite a bit
    of the degradation (in the strict technical sense of deviation from the platonic
    shapes originally engraved into the type) created by the pressing of soiled metal
    surfaces into flattened tree-pulp mush. Using objective image quality measures
    such as the sharpness of corners, I'm amazed by how <em>little</em> degradation
    you see in an averaged image made from letterpress printing. I now think that's
    because the metalworking technology in typefounding has always been pretty good;
    the bulk of the difference between 15th and 21st printing is in the smoothness
    and regularity of the paper surface, rather than the technology for forming the
    image and bringing it to the paper surface [and if you don't believe me, just
    take a close look at the difference that coated vs uncoated paper makes in inkjet
    printing].\r\n\r\n<cite>Are we too quadratically-smooth obssessed?</cite>\r\n\r\nIn
    the mathematical world I inhabit when working on smooth curves for font design,
    quadratics are a rather poor standard for smoothness. But I'll readily cop to
    the crime of being obsessed with such details.\r\n\r\nWilliam wails:\r\n<cite>You
    have regularized the base line,</cite>\r\n\r\nIn fact, I've spent very little
    effort on fit, and you can see all kinds of fit problems with my sample. If you
    want to make it match the visual appearance of the original, then you have to
    vary the baseline quite a bit (intercharacter spacing less, I think, probably
    because you have considerable compression force in that direction). To make a
    good visual match with the original, it probably <em>also</em> makes sense to
    do randomized variation on the individual impressions, as discussed in some detail
    upthread.\r\n\r\nIn any case, the \"unsharp\" outlines represent very nearly what
    George was talking about in his original post: extremely literal tracings of the
    platonic letter shapes as recovered through impression averaging, with very little
    judgement or interpretation other than classifying the original impressions and
    rejecting the ones that are too damaged to contribute to the composite image (not
    surprisingly, this is a lot trickier to get right for 500 year old typography
    than for stuff from the heyday of ATF).\r\n\r\nThe top outlines represent me using
    my eye to see where the image is soft or globby, and to sharpen those places up.
    In general, the quality of the platonic lettershapes is surprisingly good (those
    hairlines in letters such as 'a' and 'p' are real, and surprisingly stable when
    you look at the composite image as opposed to individual glyphs, many of which
    have broken hairlines and similar problems, and you also see similar examples
    of impressive sharpness in places like the top left serif of the 'i'). The consistently
    biggest problem is that the punchcutter does not seem to have been able to cut
    sharp inner-corners anywhere, and thus you have a largish radius on all inner-corners.
    (when I was tracing these, I thought that the corrections done to keep these soft
    corners from filling in and becoming too black may well count as an extremely
    early instance of trapping; we'll see what Hrant has to say about that). So I
    placed myself in the punchcutter's shoes, figured out the places where I think
    he <em>would</em> have made a sharp inner corner if he could have, and did a little
    curve touchup. Incidentally, at 600dpi in toner, the difference between the two
    is pretty hard to see - toner also has trouble with the radius at inner-corners.
    Some things are not so fantastically different after 500 years of printing technology
    evolution!\r\n\r\nI'm not sure which one to prefer, but I think at larger sizes
    the soft version is just going to be too soft and blobby, while the sharpened
    one holds its own with some interesting shapes."

    say he hardly used it, but it sure is true that he never had Malin cut a body
    smaller than 14pt and that by a quick survey of the Officina Bodoni\u2019s later
    work he tended to favour smaller bodies to set text, like 11pt and 12pt. For these,
    he had already the Dante type at his disposal, which makes me wonder whether he
    didn\u2019t feel like Griffo was suitable to be reduced any further.\r\n\r\nInitially
    the Griffo type was indeed meant to be a Bembo recut (the idea was of Stanley
    Morison but Mardersteig wrote he wasn\u2019t particularly looking forward to confront
    himself with a type already very successful at that time as Bembo), but then he
    began studying more closely an original <cite>De Aetna</cite> and came to the
    conclusion that he could indeed get much more close to the original.\r\n\r\nHe
    then asked Malin, of whom he had been an admirer for a long time, to cut for him
    this new Griffo type. Malin moved to Mardersteig\u2019s house for three months
    to do the job, and they would critique together his rough cuts every night. The
    Griffo type is indeed very different from Bembo; for one, it includes several
    alternate characters that were there in the original but had been removed from
    the Bembo cut. Mardersteig, Morison and Malin initially thought <cite>De Aetna</cite>
    was some sort of specimen of types by Griffo, but later on Mardersteig came to
    the conclusion that Griffo cut these alternates (as many as five of them for the
    <em>e</em> glyph alone) to try to imitate the works of calligraphers.\r\n\r\nMalin
    and Mardersteig didn\u2019t cut every single one of the alternate glyphs by Francesco
    Griffo, though, prefering to choose the base glyphs that looked best to them and
    some swash alternates as a complement. They also tried to choose the ones more
    different from Bembo, and that should explain the difference in how the capitals
    look."

  body: "George: I never particularly analysed how Bembo looked in Italian vs. any
    other language but it sure is something to keep under consideration. The main
    issue with Bembo to me is that who did the redrawing chose very nervous versions
    of the glyph variants, whereas Mardersteig and Malin tried something more organic.
    \r\n\r\nI should note that I can\u2019t claim any authority over any of this,
    it\u2019s just what my untrained eyes tell me: some glyphs look really odd in
    Bembo, like a (curve at the top of the counter, uneven shape at the top), e (continuing
    stroke at the bottom of the counter), g (unbalanced link stroke, odd, sudden turn
    in closing of the loop, r (slightly swhashy arm), f (very long, leaning-to the
    right main stroke at the top), s (looks a straightened up version of the original,
    slightly leaning to the right s). \r\n\r\nOther glyphs seem a bit too wide, as
    well: consider f, j, p, o, c. It may well be that these are feature that help
    increase legibility, improvements made by the savvy Monotype designers, but when
    I look at Mardersteig and Malin\u2019s Griffo I can\u2019t help but notice that
    these are exactly the features they got rid of in their interpretation (compare
    Griffo\u2019s r, a, f, e, s with Bembo). \r\n\r\nThat doesn\u2019t mean Bembo
    is not a successful typeface in its own right, or that there\u2019s a race to
    get closer to the original source that somehow Monotype lost against Malin and
    Mardersteig, it\u2019s just a different interpretation; I tend to lean towards
    Griffo, myself, but that doesn\u2019t mean there isn\u2019t room for more interpretations
    of the De Aetna type. If I remember correctly, James Clough teaches a type design
    class where he gets student to redraw the De Aetna type over and over again, and
    has been advocating getting intimate with these letterforms for a while now."

    so much the design of particular characters but that serifs are too thin and look
    like knife blades. As you said above its the contrary of organic form. Malins
    punchcutting brought nice and more feeled forms. It is softer and has more colour.\r\nAnd
    at last I really believe its nicer than its storic forefather! (One of the rare

    getting at the underlying shape, have I explained the method that Mike Parker
    recommends for obtaining images of the face of punches? You dip the punches in
    ink so that the shank is black, and then wipe off the face so that the letter
    is bright relative to the background; then you photograph it (in a light diffuser,
    so that you don't get a strong directional light; I believe Mike's setup involved
    a ring of lightbulbs diffused through a circular wall of paper), and print the
    image in negative for black shapes on a white background."

    a very frustrating process requiring physical contortion in an attempt to get
