    \r\nHowever, looking at it with fresh eyes I can't help feel it's custom. \r\n"

  body: Yes, some sort of Fleischmann-infused design. I was suspecting Farnham but
    that's not right. Actually, I do think Mercury does come very close (although
    it's hard to say without really seeing the details; I don't have Mercury so I'm
    just staring at the font tester thing). The open "P"s are almost certainly custom.
    Bear in mind that logos are almost always customized to some degree.

  body: "Designed by [[http://www.stockholmdesignlab.se/en/projects/peak-performance-2/logotype/|Stockholm
    Design Lab]]. You could just ask them. \r\n\r\nThere\u2019s no date on that site
    for this design, but I seem to remember it going back quite a while. Peak Performance
    was the go-to brand for rich kids when I went to primary school in the early 90s.
    Perhaps what I remember was the old mark, and the new one just does its job so
    well I never thought about the change?"

  body: "Dick, what do you do to your samples to make them look so jagged?\r\n\r\nAnd
    no, I'd say Pona is not close at all. The original sample has ball terminals,
    these are... I don't know what to call them, straightened-out foxtails or something.
    Also see: drawing of bowl of the \"a\", flags on top of the \"r\" etc., contrast. "

  body: They are screen captures (Snagit) of font images. Too many steps. It also
    distorts ball terminals into squared-off balls or something...  (sorry)

    closest.
