body: "Good day everyone.\r\n\r\nI am not looking for a specific typeface but rather
  a list of professional typefaces that would abide by the criteria listed below.
  \r\n\r\n<strong>Essentials</strong >\r\n<ul><li>Proportional spacing for the latin
  characters with <a href=\"http://fontfeed.com/archives/figuring-it-out-osf-lf-and-tf-explained/\">tabular
  lining figures</a>. (Thanks for clarifying Renko!)</li>\r\n<li>French accented latin
  charaters (\xE9, \xE0, \xEA\u2026).</li>\r\n<li>At least a plain and a bold weight
  option.</li>\r\n<li>Typographers' Quotes (Single and Double)</li></ul>\r\n\r\n<strong>Desirable
  attributes but no deal breakers</strong >\r\n<ul><li>A thin weight option</li>\r\n<li>An
  italic style</li>\r\n<li>A condensed style</li>\r\n<li>Fractions</li>\r\n<li>Stylistic
  ligatures</ul>\r\n\r\n<strong>Bonuses</strong >\r\n<ul><li>Both a Sans Seriff and
  a Seriff cut.</li>\r\n<li>Small caps</li></ul>\r\n\r\nI'm eagerly awaiting your
  suggestions.\r\n"

    browse the threads you have pointed out and see what other fonts listed there
    fit my criteria list. Thanks for the Centro suggestion. It's a very nice and complete
    typeface.\r\n\r\nThanks for your suggestions also johndiggity. "

  body: "FontShop has a list of <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/fontlist/super_families/\">super-families</a>
    that include serif and sans fonts. \r\n\r\nSome classic fonts, possibly not in
    the FontShop list, like Palatino and Frutiger have recently added new families
    to give both a serif and sans.\r\n\r\nYou'd have to investigate to see if they
    have all your criteria, but often if they are OpenType font families they would
    have most of the things you wanted.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
