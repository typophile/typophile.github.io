body: does anyone know where I cam buy Magnificat. It&#39;s a very OTT black letter
  font used very well in Another Magazine. Its name may have changed but that&#39;s
  what it was called in the 1976 penrose annual. I&#39;ll try and scan a pic for you.

    I still can&#39;t find it. I would be prepared to give up if I didn&#39;t see
    the entire family in the last four issues of Another Magazine.

    been digitized yet? I ran  <BR>both typeface name and designer through some  <BR>search
    engines, but to no avail. <BR> <BR>If it <i>has</i> been released under another
    name, then  <BR>we still can&#39;t find it without that scan you promised  <BR>us
    in your initial post. I guess nobody who read  <BR>your post has access to Another
    Magazine nor the  <BR>1976 Penrose Annual. I haven&#39;t, so basically I&#39;ve  <BR>got
    no clue what the typeface looks like.

  body: Fred Peter&#39;s type designs ended up with Letraset and then ITC after they
    bought the dry transfer company to whom they were originally licensed. Last time
    I spoke to him &#40;he lives in Vancouver&#41;, he complained that he had never
    received any royalties from ITC for sales of Vivaldi. I don&#39;t suppose he gets
    any from aIa either.

  body: It Would Be Nice if someone in the know could inform aIa that Mr. Peter is
    still very much alive so the two the two might work something out where the font
    gets sold at myfonts.com and Mr. Peter starts getting royalties for it again.
    Then this could come to something closer to a Happy Ending.  <BR> <BR>Ignorance
    is never an excuse, but I find that some font pirates have in the past changed
    their behavior when they become more fully informed of what exactly they&#39;re
    doing to people. Microsoft&#39;s response to the Book Antiqua problem is a good
    example of this. <BR> <BR>Does Mr. Peter get royalties for the Bitstream version
    of Vivaldi? Cos I have a license for it and use it. :-&#40;

  body: 'Johns H &amp; B, <BR>.  I just sent off an inquiry, including a link to this
    thread, to Kivart &#40;aIa&#41;. I tried to spell things out as clearly but simply
    as possible for translation purposes, but who knows how clearly the matter will
    be understood at the Japanese end. <BR> <BR>Playing Devil&#39;s Advocate here
    ... <BR> <BR>Both ITC and Esselte list Magnificat under their trademark listings:
    <BR><a href="http://www.eyewire.com/copyright/" target="_blank">http://www.eyewire.com/copyright/</a>
    <BR><a href="http://www.itcfonts.com/about/legal.asp?nCo=AFMT" target="_blank">http://www.itcfonts.com/about/legal.asp?nCo=AFMT</a>
    <BR> <BR>ITC, Letraset, Linotype -&#62; none of them seem to offer Magnificat
    as a digital font. Nobody seems to. <BR> <BR>Here&#39;s a reference I thoroughly
    enjoyed, but failed to find last night, that confirms Mr. Lawley&#39;s evidence
    trail leading to Magnificat: <BR> <BR><a href="http://www.pkfont.co.uk/page5.htm"
    target="_blank">http://www.pkfont.co.uk/page5.htm</a> <BR> <BR>May we &#40;me
    being a neophyte relative to you&#41; reasonably assume that Magnificat likely
    never got past the dry transfer sheet state? <BR> <BR>OK, so here we have a mid-20s
    Japanese designer/typographer who probably comes across a print usage of Magnificat
    somewhere &#40;Gamme&#39;s &#39;a&#39; is different from the image Philip Kelly
    shows, which suggests that Kivart didn&#39;t see all of the characters of Magnificat&#41;.
    &#34;Beautiful!&#34; he exclaims. What could he reasonably conclude about its
    status as a font? <BR> <BR>If it were a font, the language barrier would make
    the necessary detective work mighty tough. I&#39;d have to agree here, though,
    with your statement about ignorance not being an excuse. <BR> <BR>If it&#39;s
    not even a font, the mission to find a source would have been well nigh impossible!
    Heck, he may even have &#40;quite reasonably IMO&#41; concluded that the print
    image he saw was hand drawn. <BR> <BR>In light of this, I&#39;m: <BR>1&#41; Glad
    that Kivart digitized the thing. It&#39;s hardly something to &#34;widely use&#34;,
    but it&#39;s unique, arguably beautiful and evidently usable in magazine copy.
    It surely would never have seen the light of day as a font without Kivart&#39;s
    skills. Plus, it&#39;s an original version, with, apparently, at least one character
    different from Magnificat to boot. <BR> <BR>2&#41; Pretty sure that &#34;font
    pirate&#34; is overkill condemnation here. <BR> <BR>3&#41; Hopeful that Kivart
    contacts Mr. Peter, which would now be the right thing to do '

  body: "Since I've stumbled on this thread nearly five years late, no one will read
    this, BUT ...\r\nI thought the comment by Friedrich Peter about receiving no royalties
    was pretty sad. Magnificat won second prize in Letraset's 1973 International Typeface
    Competition, for which there were 2590 entries. According to the company's handout,
    he received \xA3750 and a \"generous royalty agreement.\" I never saw Magnificat
    used, however -- or either of the other two cash winners: Bombere, by Carla Ward
    of Washington, DC (\xA31000); and Stilla, by Francois Boltana of France (\xA3500).
    \r\n\r\nThe judges were Derek Birdsall, Roger Excoffon, Colin Forbes, Armin Hoffmann,
    Herb Lubalin, and Marcello Minale.\r\n(Was that the only international competition
    that Letraset sponsored?)\r\n\r\nThere were 18 more winners, who were also supposed
    to have received a royalty deal but no cash. I really didn't see much of any of
    those fonts in use, either -- except for the still-popular LeGriffe, by Andre-Michel
    Lubac, and Vic Carless's Shatter. \r\n\r\nShatter was one of three winners in
    the group of 20 that were based on Helvetica. The other two were Process and Suds
    -- the latter was Helvetica Medium caps that were made up of black outline + white
    fill circles of various sizes, to look like letters made of soap bubbles.\r\n\r\nMy
    favorite of all the winners was Vincent, by Trevor Vincent of the UK. It was a
    deco-ish face with thin white lines that sectioned the letters to suggest ceramic
    tile. I never saw a full showing of it."

    the award was given, Stilla only had lowercase letters. It's a nice typeface,
    but I'm not sure it was so good a design without caps that it deserved 3rd place."
