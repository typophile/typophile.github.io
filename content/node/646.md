  body: There used to be a Times-like typeface with sharp  <BR>serifs like that called
    Arrow, but I can&#39;t seem to  <BR>find it right now. <BR> <BR>You could try
    using <a href="http://www.shinntype.com/" target="_blank"> Nick Shinn</a>&#39;s
    <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/shinn/beaufort/beaufort/testdrive.html?s=Parisienne&amp;p=96"
    target="_blank"> Beaufort</a> and stretch  <BR>it a bit... if that&#39;s not stretching
    it a bit. <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif" ALT=":-&#41;"
