    but I am thinking there is another flare-sans titling font whose name is not coming
    to me at the moment. (Even Optima is close, but doesn't have the U stem.)\r\n\r\n-

  body: "Hmm, I've seen Donatello before, it's somewhat crude.\r\nChristiana, though
    a looker also, reminds me somewhat of Barbedor.\r\nIt's not exactly what I'm looking
    for cus I kinda fell for the upper part of the B and the narrow T. Thanks for
    introducing me to Christiana though!\r\nSince we're here, how about this guy?\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/decotwist_5930.jpg]\r\n\r\nJulian

    that we have written about recently. (Revived for WIRED under the name Zorro).

    using the alternate U. It has the narrow T and the small-top B.\r\n\r\n\r\n- Mike
