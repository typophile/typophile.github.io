body: "\"A Man of Letters,\" 28 June 2010 issue\r\n\r\nThought this excerpt would
  be of interest to Typophiles. He's talking about how the curious problem that we
  have a very specialized area of our brain for reading, yet writing is such a recent
  phenomenon that it could not be accounted for by evolution through natural selection.
  This is solved by concluding that these neurons were useful for general visual recognition
  (deciphering the environment), and then were recruited for reading.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Picture_5558.png]"

  body: "Nick: <em>Our perceptual apparatus is far more abstract and malleable than
    to be explained by simple reifications.</em>\r\n\r\nOur perceptual apparatus may
    be malleable but it very obviously is not abstract. There's no reification involved
    in treating physical phenomena as things.\r\n_____\r\n\r\nThe most interesting
    aspect of the article excerpt is the bit in parentheses. I wasn't entirely taken
    with Changizi's analysis of writing systems because it seemed to me that the great
    variety of forms in 100+ writing systems and the greater variety of forms in nature
    would pretty much guarantee a large degree of topological overlap. But if systems
    such as shorthand, designed for speed of writing rather than speed of decipherment,
    do not have the same kind of topological overlap, then the explanation becomes
    more compelling.\r\n\r\nBut to come back to Craig's introductory paragraph --
    I have not read the whole Sacks article yet --, if the reading area of the brain
    is specialised, how did it become specialised? If this area involves neurons that
    were, prior to the development of writing, used for more general topological recognition,
    why aren't they still so used, and why isn't reading accounted for by general
    topological recognition?\r\n\r\nThere is another explanation for the existence
    of these neurons, which is that they were free riders, i.e. that they did not
    have a specific purpose prior to the development of writing, that they are not
    explainable by adaptationism, but are simply part of the genetic baggage carried
    alongside selected for traits. Of course, the existence of free riders, and our
    inability to distinguish with certainty traits that were selected for and those
    that are free riders, reduces all adaptationist explanations to more or less probable
    just-so stories."

    than to be explained by simple reifications.\r\nIn other words, perception is
    not all mechanics, physical and chemical interactions, but has a certain amount
    of built-in nous.\r\nProgrammable software, if you like, as opposed to hardware.\r\n\r\nThat
    doesn't mean your \"free riders\" play no part in adaptionism, they are very useful
    in being able to cope with unprecedented situations.\r\n\r\n<em>There's no reification
    involved in treating physical phenomena as things.</em>\r\n\r\nThe reification
    is in equating perceptions of visual stimuli with physical objects.\r\nPerception
    is not reality, as various optical illusions, not to mention the cloning that
    occurs at one's blind spot, demonstrate."

    like many behaviors (such as recognizing that one's bladder is full and should
    be evacuated in a culturally-approved manner), is <em>learned</em> behavior, and
    the brain forms neural networks to facilitate that behavior. There is no predestination,
    only opportunism."

    yet the brain has fairly well defined areas that deal with specific kinds of mental
    activity, so the opportunism you suggest is clearly constrained by structure.
    What I am querying is the apparent existence of an area of the brain that is specialised
    for reading, and how it came to be that way in us as a species. Obviously that
    area needs to be trained -- literacy is not automatic --, but if that area did
    not exist or function as it does would reading be possible?"

    of their brains which control motor skills or speech can, in some cases, relearn
    those skills. Opportunism will follow predisposition--the path of least resistance--but
    is not necessarily constrained by it."

    Sacks' article, I was reading <em>[[http://www.harpercollins.com/books/Proust-Squid-Maryanne-Wolf/?isbn=9780060186395|Proust
    and the Squid]]</em> by Maryanne Wolfe. The book deftly weaves together three
    themes:\r\n<li>The invention and development of written language.</li>\r\n<li>How
    the human brain adapted to reading and writing.\_</li>\r\n<li>How children learn
    to process written/printed language.</li>\r\nProf. Wolf's research is primarily
    in child development, but in this book she displays great knowledge of visual
    communication. She also makes an analogy that should resonate with Typophiles:
    The invention of alphabetic writing in Greece about 2500 years ago was feared
    and resisted by the champions of the established oral culture, much as many people
    with a vested interest in print now look askance at the spread of digital media.\_\r\n"

    writing was not invented in Greece.\r\n\r\nWhat evidence does Wolfe provide for
    the claim that alphabetic writing was \u2018feared and resisted\u2019? I presume
    she cites Sokrates' parable in <em>The Phaedrus,</em> (which should be read in
    the context of Sokrates' critique of the Sophists). Anything else?\r\n\r\nI don't
    think <em>The Phaedrus</em> evinces either fear or resistance; rather, it conveys
    something that is simply true about the difference between oral and literary cultures
    and, hence, of what is lost in the progress from one to the other. Framing these
    kind of deep cultural anxieties in terms of \u2018vested interests\u2019 and \u2018established
    culture\u2019 might get you good term paper marks in an Marxism 101 course, but
    it seems to me pretty much backwards, in that the move from oral culture to literary
    culture involves concentration of power and wealth, and the creation of vested
    interests and establishments if a kind that are not possible without writing."
