    a font.\r\nInfluences on letters: _M_ and _N_ with sharp tips -- Futura, 1927\r\nDon"

  body: "Similar feeling of oppressive futurism in a font based on propaganda displays
    at the Communist Red Square parade in 1937 by Rian Hughes with the name Korolev
    Compressed Heavy [img:sites/default/files/old-images/KorolevCompressedHeavyAsTHINGS_TO_COME_5670.gif]\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/device/korolev/\r\nIt
    has an _S_ with a straight spine like the movie's unusual _S_.\r\nThe other letters
    could be clipped and tinkered with to make a reasonable match.\r\nBTW note the
    movie title's strange _G_ which looks like _C_ except for the sharp corner on
    the lower rhs.\r\nDon"
