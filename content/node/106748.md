  and this is the first time I'm really dealing with typography. It's only a very
  basic draft supposed to show the characteristics of a font I want to create myself,
  as I can't seem to finde anything comparable that tries this fusion of geometric
  structure and \"contemporary\" spurless details.\r\nIf you know any existing font
  with these features, please tell me - there has to be one somewhere.\r\nAnyway,
  please feel free to tell me, wether you think this is a project I should push further
  or if it is completely hopeless - architects tend to think they can do everything
  on their own and end up in a massive mess."

    as they seem way too curvy allthough following the design principles of the rest.\r\nThe
    beziers of the \"s\" are a bit messy, I'm afraid, as I constructed them in my
    CAD software to blend the curves of two circles and then imported them in illustrator
    where I designed the rest of the letters. I may be lacking the knowledge to do
    it in entirely in FontForge or the appropriate software ...[img:sites/default/files/old-images/alphabet_4062.jpg]"

  body: "Thanks for your comments, first of all.\r\n\r\nYou have a point there about
    the mid-bars in \"EFHK\" and certainly about the \"k\". I will definitly try this.\r\nBut
    I  happen to like the \"g\" and especially the \"r\" as they bring something sharper
    to the whole thing and I don't like the way the \"r\" is treated in most spurless
    fonts. I have to admit the \"f\" and \"j\" are rather problematic though.\r\nStill
    think the worst part are \"hnmu\" and I have not yet figured out how to deal with
    them.\r\nConcerning the optical tricks:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/1_5069.JPG]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/n_5515.JPG]\r\n\r\nPlease
    don't pay any attention to kerning etc.! ;)"

    shapes for \"hmnu\" but if I construct them in a similar way as \"bdpq\" the just
    don't look right next to the other shapes - especially \"m\" looks ridiculous,
