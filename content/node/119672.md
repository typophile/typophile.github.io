  there are quite a few differences when you look closely at it.\r\nI have performed
  a search using an image font identify tool but I didn't came up with a suiting result.\r\n\r\nDoes
  anyone else have an idea which font this might be? I have a feeling it's pretty
  custom.\r\n\r\nThanks for any help in advance.\r\n\r\nC."

    Closest commercial match I could find is Azbuka:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/mti/azbuka/\r\n\r\nSequencia
    comes close, save for the spur on the G:\r\nhttp://www.fontshop.com/search/?q=Sequencia&sample_text=DAIPXGWTLF"

  body: "Fivos, I think Kashiwa Sato designed the typeface for Uniqlo, while Morisawa
    developed it as a font.\r\nAnyway, the font is a custom font. It would not be
    good for you to use the font on your site, even if you use the font for font identification.\r\nDid
    Kashiwa Sato, Morisawa or Uniqlo allow you to do it?"

    I'll have a close look at the different choices I got now. Greenwich looks very
