  Espinosa Nova is finally [[http://new.myfonts.com/search/espinosa/fonts/|available
  via MyFonts.]]\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/EspinosaNova720x360_3456.gif]\r\n\r\nEspinosa
  Nova is a revival based on the types used by Antonio de Espinosa, the most important
  Mexican printer of the sixteenth century and very probably the first punchcutter
  anywhere in the American continent (1551). In 2010, its main fonts were awarded
  two certificates of excellence: one by TDC2 (Type Directors Club Typeface Design
  Competition), one by Tipos Latinos (Biennial of Latin American Typography).\r\n\r\nAccording
  to Robert Bringhurst, it is \u201Can unusually intelligent family of type, reaching
  back to one of the most exciting moments in typographic history and reaching forward
  to the typographic future\u201D. \r\n\r\nA comprehensive PDF can be downloaded [[http://estudio-ch.com/images/especimen/EspinosaNova-Specimen.pdf|here.]]\r\n\r\nAnd
  now the best part: THE LICENSE FOR THE REGULAR IS FREE! No credit card required:
  just select, read the EULA, download. Easy!\r\n\r\nQuestions & feedback: cristobal[at]estudio-ch.com."

    for some future project!\r\n\r\nHrant: Thanks! \xB6 And yes, I am aware of the
    risk of extracting the fonts. However, I decided to provide a nice specimen in
    the way I like to receive it, and certainly I love to watch every glyph in the
    family with full detail before I buy a license. Hope I am not the only one. Thanks
    for commenting."
