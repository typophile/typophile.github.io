  body: "Offhand I cannot think of any font that seems similar, because there is no
    consistency in the style. The strokes are high contrast, like modern, but the
    serifs are more like Art Nouveau. I think it is a fanciful design that is not
    based on any font.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

  body: Whoever did this did a great job of manipulating it into something new. I
    mean if it did start out as a typeface. Lovely.
