  and italic for a project at the moment.\r\nI need non-aligning numerals throughout
  though, is there a way of achieving this without selecting them and changing them
  to planitn expert?\r\n\r\nAny help would be much appreciated.\r\n\r\nThanks\r\n\r\nGeorge"

  body: Yes, there is a way. It seems there's no "Plantin OSF" available, but you
    could use [[http://www.fonts.com/findfonts/detail.htm?pid=433194&|Plantin Pro]]
    which contains both, lining and old style figures. Then, in an OpenType-aware
    application like Quark XPress, you would just turn on Old Style Figures option.

    mean I will have to manualy change figures to old style.\r\nOr is there a way
    I can automatically set it to use them?\r\n\r\nGeorge"

    symbol).\r\n4. Point to OpenType.\r\n5. On the submenu, click Proportional Oldstyle.\r\n\r\nThat's
    it. From that point on, any numbers you type will be oldstyle figures (provided
    you are using OpenType font containing also the oldstyle figures - e. g. Plantin
    Pro).\r\n"

  body: If, for any reason, you cannot use Plantin Pro, you can first typeset all
    text using regular Plantin. Then, in one manual operation, you can change (Edit
    > Find/Change, in InDesign) all "1" of Plantin (i. e. lining numbers) to "1" of
    Plantin Expert (i. e. oldstyle numbers), then all "2" of Plantin to "2" of Plantin
    Expert, and so on.
