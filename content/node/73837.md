body: forgive me, oh fellow designers, but i've used this face in the past and cannot
  for the life of me remember what it's called! it's french (or french inspired) and
  was popular in the 70s. the sample i've attached comes from a 1970s LP cover, and
  accompanies 1950s artwork from french painter fernand leger.
