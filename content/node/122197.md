  me for some time now. I'm trying to recreate the wallpaper that was used by the
  MI6 members in the movie \"Skyfall', I menaged to identify the main font of the
  system (Sol Pro Bold if anyone would be also looking) but I have trouble in identifying
  the secondary font, which can be seen on this picture [img:sites/default/files/old-images/Untitled-1_5437.jpg]\r\n\r\nAll
  identifying services failed, bear in mind that I need the exact same font, unfortunately
  having a substitute is not satisfying enough for me :/\r\n\r\nWith best regards,\r\nGeorge"
