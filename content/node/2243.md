body: 'Calling all typophiles: <BR> <BR>My agency, Pangea design, are about to design
  <i>Berling nova antiqua</i>. <BR> <BR>All contracts have been signed with proper
  authorities, and we have the blessing of Geith Forsberg, the widow of Karl-Erik
  Forsberg, the designer of Berling. <BR> <BR>As familiar with most of you, some of
  the typefaces made in metal have through the years and through technique or lack
  thereof, moved from dynamic useful typefaces to either dull, anorectic or plain
  bad interpretations.  <BR> <BR>This is not the case with the present Linotype version,
  which we think is good. It is not, however, complete. <BR> <BR>Our goal is to design
  a new book version and a new display version. It will include both going back to
  the sources <i>and</i> making the on-screen appearence good.  <BR> <BR>We&#39;ve
  been given access to Linotypes sketches, friskets, letraset letters, photo setting
  versions, early sketches by Forsberg &#40;unfortunately the original sketches given
  to the type punchers have vanished&#41;, new found and unused metal types have been
  printed in various sizes for us to use. The typographic guild in Stockholm have
  been briefed for feedback too. <BR> <BR>I would like to know what you think about
  this project, in general, and more specific, what would you like a new Berling to
  perform, something the current versions, unauthorized or not, don&#39;t? <BR> <BR>Which
  Berling do you prefer? The Linotype, Adobe, Scangraphic, Bitstream, megafonts or
  maybe some other version? <BR> <BR>For <i>what</i> do you use it? <BR> <BR>I believe
  the amount of knowledge on this site could give the project a definite good boost,
  and if there&#39;s interest I could keep you updated.  <BR> <BR>Yours, <BR>'

  body: 'Sounds like a great project. I love some things about Berling &#40;like the
    short descenders&#41; but also see some anachronisms. It&#39;s notable that Bill
    Hill chose Berling as the native font of the MS Reader software when that was
    lauched, probably for a combination of reasons, including its performance in ClearType
    as well as its high readability for book work. I also like that the Bold isn&#39;t
    too dark &#40;at least in the Lino version&#41;. The two things I don&#39;t like
    are: <BR>1&#41; The head serifs seem very affected. <BR>2&#41; The caps are a
    bit large. <BR> <BR>Also, since the x-height is nice and small you might consider
    giving it hybrid numerals. <BR> <BR>Lastly, if you really want to get heavy, you
    should give it two italics: a rigid one of moderate incline and Roman features,
    and a cursive one that&#39;s steeper. <BR> <BR>hhp <BR>'

- body: Yes, the caps are <i>really</i> large, <BR>but I&#39;ve noticed that the metal
    version&#39;s caps are proportionally way lower in smaller sizes.  <BR>I&#39;ll
    try and upload some comparisions early next week. <BR> <BR>Let me get back on
    some your other points later as well. <BR> <BR>Thanks! <BR> <BR>

  body: This sounds like a great project. What would be wonderfull is if you could
    log the progress for public access. Possibly a website dedicated to following
    the project? Pictures, timelines, specimens, that type of thing. <BR> <BR>Possibly?

    but I&#39;m not sure if we have the time. <BR> <BR>
