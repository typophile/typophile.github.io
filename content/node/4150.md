  expert sets and Zaph Dingbats in QxP.Preview in  Suitcase does not show them either.
  Although Font book shows all the symbols correctly. Does any one have any idea?
  Help is greatly appreciated! '

    &#40;somehow tied to fonts on some sites&#41; with Font Reserve. I think turning
    off all the fonts in FontBook may have resolved many issues. Good tip.
