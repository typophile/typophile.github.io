    It is a serif design. Given the lack of choice, it is better than nothing. Ideally,
    you would want to use a lighter sans serif design for on-screen use. In terms
    of what we offer on our Type Showroom, the Light or Medium weight of SM Gothic
    might be suitable. They are $29 each. See: http://store1.adobe.com/cfusion/store/html/index.cfm?store=OLS-US&event=displayFontPackage&code=1748\r\n\r\nDr.

  body: "In my opinion the best hangul font for on-screen use at the moment is Nanum
    Gothic \uB098\uB214\uACE0\uB515, which is available for free at [[http://hangeul.naver.com/index.nhn?goto=fonts#fonts]].
    It is a contemporary sans-serif with a warm touch and is expertly hinted for screen
    use, I think by the same individual who was in charge of hinting Malgun Gothic,
    the font bundled with Windows from XP onwards (and which is also an excellent
    screen font).\r\n\r\nAlong with it serif counterpart Nanum Myeongjo \uB098\uB214\uBA85\uC870,
    it is one of a pair of fonts (called the Nanum fonts \uB098\uB214\uAE00\uAF34)
    commissioned by the NHN Corporation which is behind Naver, a hugely popular search
    portal in Korea. They decided to distribute the Nanum fonts for free.\r\n\r\nThe
    usage guideline in Korean is provided on the page that I linked to. Here's a fairly
    literal translation:\r\n\r\n<cite>The Nanum fonts are the intellectual property
    of the NHN Corporation.\r\nThe Nanum fonts are provided free of charge for individuals
    and companies, and can be used in all publications and works.\r\nTo foster a culture
    of copyright protection, it is recommended that the source of the fonts is stated
    when using the Nanum fonts.\r\nIn addition, users may freely and directly distribute
    the Nanum fonts to others.\r\nHowever, one may not charge for the copying and
    distribution for any reason in the process.\r\nThe Nanum fonts may not be modified
    and sold by users other than the intellectual property holders for any reason,
    and they must be used in the form distributed.</cite>\r\n\r\nThey don't deal in
    very detailed EULAs, but I hope this makes it clear what you can use the fonts
    for.\r\n\r\nA third of the way down the page I linked you will see the huge letters
    \uB098\uB214\uACE0\uB515 in the said typeface, and a series of six white boxes.
    The first three are links for downloading the TTF files, the last three for OTF
    files. To take advantage of the hints in a ClearType environment you should download
    the TTF files, and you probably want the third link, a zip file, as the first
    two are installation programs for Windows and Mac respectively.\r\n\r\nI hope
    this helps anyone looking for a good hangul font for on-screen use but frustrated
    by the language barrier."

    href=\"http://hotlead.levien.com/2010/06/nanum-korean-fonts-now-released-under.html\">hotlead</a>,
    and in particular am interested in whether anyone would be trying these out as-is
    as web fonts, or whether we need to do more work to squeeze the file size down."

  body: "Thanks, I had missed the announcement. This is great news, especially for
    the Korean Linux community. It bears repeating that these are top quality fonts.\r\n\r\nThe
    obvious way of squeezing down the file size would be to limit the character coverage
    to only the most used hangul syllables. For most purposes, only a fraction of
    the 11,172 hangul syllables would suffice. The question is what to keep; the 2,350
    syllables of the EUC-KR standard are an absolute minimum, and maybe a statistical
    analysis of Korean text corpora will let us know which ones are sufficient to
    cover 99.9% of Korean texts."
