  body: I think it looks quite nice already. <BR>I like the idea of &#39;connecting&#39;
    a horizontal stroke to a vertical one. Maybe you should try implementing this
    kind of connection into more letters. The conventional script-y connection adds
    confusion to letter-pairs like &#39;ui&#39;, &#39;wn&#39; and &#39;um&#39;. Another
    possibilty is to <i>not</i> connect some letters. <BR> <BR>There are some inconsistencies
    regarding the horizontal proportions &#40;widths&#41;. Lowercase &#39;e&#39;,
    for example, looks too wide. <BR> <BR>Another observation. In &#39;q&#39;, &#39;y&#39;
    and &#39;g&#39;, the two bowls touch each other. I think you should have some
    more space between the bowls.

    of an ear on the <b>g</b> would be enough to disambiguate <b>guilt</b> and <b>quilt</b>.'

  body: good points, both of you. <BR> <BR>my problem with both c and e is incorporating
    the connector into the letter, as opposed to the extra loop in most letters. when
    put next to a non-connecting letter &#40;v and r in the previous example, it does
    look too wide.&#41; <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/51877.gif"
