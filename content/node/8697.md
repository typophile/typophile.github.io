  body: It&#39;s very small but I would say it&#39;s Arial horizontally stretched
    for the the Media temple &#40;the top of the &#34;t&#34; looks slanted not straight
    to me when enlarged&#41; with &#34;set your sites on us&#34; set in <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/myriad/"
    target="_blank">Myriad</a>. I think various weights of <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/helvetica/"
    target="_blank">Helvetica</a> also horizontally streched for Search Engine.
