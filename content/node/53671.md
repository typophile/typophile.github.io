  this book cover because it suits the title very well, at least in my opinion. The
  type used to fill the cover looks like the restless doodles of a designer who has
  been up a little to late developing ideas for their latest project or idea. The
  color palette also reminds the viewer of coffee, which further re-iterates the idea
  of a need for caffeine. If you look to the back cover of the book you will even
  find splashes of coffee stains to enforce that concept even more!\r\n\r\nIf you
  actually open the book it gets better...each page conveys a sense of urgency and
  excitement! I actually own this one, and LOVE it\r\n\r\n- toodles, it's been fun"
