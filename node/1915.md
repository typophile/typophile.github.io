  body: See also the first two Caxton editions of <a href="http://www.bl.uk/treasures/caxton/homepage.html"><i>The
    Canterbury Tales</i></a> at the British Library site. Very nicely done, showing
    the type very well and even, remarkably, giving a good sense of the qualities
    of the printing.

  body: If you ever get to the British Library, you can pick up CDs of the various
    books featured in their kiosks. I&#39;ve had the Lindisfarne Gospels CD for a
    few years, and it is a real treat to flip through.
