  Street in New York City, will be closing its doors for good in just a couple of
  weeks...  They have carried <em>Emigre</em> magazine for as long as I can remember,
  in addition to all sorts of books on graphic design, architecture and art...\r\n\r\nThe
  good news for typophiles is that they are offering a 40% discount on their remaining
  books (there are still quite a few). Even the framed, out-of-print Emigre posters
  that they have on their walls are for sale, at $65 each.\r\n\r\n<!--break-->\r\n\r\nTheir
  old <a href=\"http://www.fineartinprint.com\" target=\"_blank\">website</a> has
  been replaced with a generic page, but perhaps you can contact the owners at bevandavies@worldnet.att.net"

    small bookstores left in New York City, but not too many that cater to the graphic
    arts-inclined... and this is one of them. I know of two others, located near the
    East Village, but one of them hasn't even been displaying new type or design books
    lately."

    to my brother Bevan and his wife Michelle for 39 years. I agree that there is
    no replacing a bookstore like this one. Sure others carry books about the graphic
    arts but none like this store. I will miss the store as will many others. Sure
    write to Bevan. He will appreciate the kind remarks and I will e-mail him a link
    to this page. Thanks everyone.\r\n\r\nJordan Davies"

    kind of store I'd go in just to kill time and then end up buying $100+ worth of
    books. I'll try to get there before it closes.\r\n\r\nSoHo just ain't what it
    used to be. Nothing is."

    to browse, but they have such a great selection, and books nobody else has, that
    you end up buying something...\r\n\r\nI've never really taken the time to look
    through their huge postcard collection -- when you go in, on the righthand side
    there is a huge collection of original and antique-looking postcards...\r\n"
