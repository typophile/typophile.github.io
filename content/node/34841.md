  graphic design studio. It is intended to be very regular (common) looking -  at
  first glance, which with careful observation will reveal it\u2019s complexity and
  beauty. It must look really \u201Ctricky\u201D (if I may express myself that way:),
  because the people working there are professionals, hidden behind a firm name, generally
  meaning \u2013 unprofessional (something like anti-hero design agency).\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/diletant_prev_5476.jpg]\r\n\r\nI\u2019m
  posting it for critique and suggestions, which may add little perfection \u2013
  it must look really twisted, tricky and in the same time amazing. \r\n\r\nI\u2019am
  currently having a very hard time constructing the latin version\u2026 so any comments
  and suggestions\u2026.\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/diletant_prev2_4434.jpg]"

  body: 'The lettering of the word Dilettante is very nice, but then the next line
    seems wrong. The typeface, the word spacing (too much), the line spacing (too
    little). I''d try adjusting those things and even pushing the secondary line farther
    to the right, don''t have it cling to the same guide as the main line. '
