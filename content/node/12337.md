  have been planning to stay at Hotel Unter den Linden, quite nearby the conference
  location (and cheap), where I had a single room reserved.\r\n\r\nThe German design
  magazine [[form]] gives away free admission tickets to people who can answer specific
  trivia questions every year. This year, my girlfriend knew that that the logo of
  the [[Haus der Kulturen der Welt]], where the conference is held, was designed by
  [[Cornell Windlin]]. A few days ago, she won one of the free tickets!\r\n\r\nThe
  Hotel Unter den Linden though is booked-out: no double rooms available. Paying a
  fee for her to stay in my single room is not permitted. &nbsp; <em>Schade\u2026</em>
  So, a week before the conference. I'm not sure where I'll stay. Anyone know a good
  hotel with a vacancy?"
