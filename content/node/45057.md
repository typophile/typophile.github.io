  body: You probably have some errors in your kerning classes, is my guess. Check
    your left and right classes and see that there is no duplicates or errors.

  body: "Hey Goran,\r\n\r\nThanks. I have now tried to remove two kerningclasses,
    and now it works correctly!\r\nBut: I need this two class-pairs. Must I rename
    them, or what??\r\n\r\nBest, \r\nMorten\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/classes_5790.png]"

  body: "You can't put the same glyph in two (or more) different kerning classes that
    are intended for the same kern pair position (i.e., left, right or both, as indicated
    with the check marks). \r\n\r\nIt seems like it would be much more helpful if
    FontLab gave you an alert immediately when you do this, rather than waiting until
    you have done it perhaps dozens of times and try to generate a font. My strategy
    is to be very deliberate and organized in the way I set up my kerning classes,
    which has other benefits as well."

  body: "Morten,\r\n\r\nIn your example, you need to uncheck the right-side checkbox
    of the _kernA class. Then copy the contents of _kernA, paste them in the _A2 class,
    and add the AE glyph name to it. This will take care of half of the warning messages.
    To get rid of the other half you need to edit the classes _kernE and _E2 in a
    similar (though inverse) way.\r\n\r\nTo check for kerning classes' overlaps, you
    may want to use Karsten's [[http://www.kltf.de/kltf_otproduction.htm|KLTF Check
    Kern Classes]] macro, or try the button with a yin-yang sign in the Kerning Assistance
    dialogue.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/kerning_assistance_5593.png]"
