  books to look at? E.g. pop up books, parts of the book that fold out or even just
  interactive covers or pages cut in unusual sizes? I'm doing a project on the end
  of the book vs. the Ipad/kindle so trying to say why the book will be around for
  years to come because of the way in which you interact with them.\r\n\r\nRegards
