  body: "Hi there:\r\n\r\nBodoni is inherently beautiful. However if your going to
    choose a  'classical' Bodoni type, the Bitstream Bauer Bodoni is widely accepted
    one of the most elegant.\r\n\r\nFor a modern spin on Bodoni, Emigre's Filosophia
    is a most fabulous choice.\r\n\r\nRead this article to help you make up your mind:

    helped you.\r\n\r\nMikey :-)"

    take on the classic style.

    the popularity of slab serifs these days.

  body: Does it have to be a Bodoni specifically? If you just looking for a classy
    Bodoni-esque typeface, Andrade Pro from <a href="http://www.dstype.com/">DSType</a>
    is a nice alternative. It's a touch softer, with fabulous swash and script variants.

  body: "\r\nThanks eveybody for the coments, \r\n\r\nMikey, the article was very
    helpful, I am curently using Bauer Bodoni, which compared with the FF Bodoni and
    ITC Bodoni, I think, has more character. The ITC is very beautiful too but it
    looks more delicate and that's not what I am looking for this project.\r\n\r\nAbout
    the Andrade Pro, it is also very beautiful but I don't like the capital G.\r\n\r\nThanks
    guys, I think I will continue with Bauer Bodoni, but at least now I know why.
    \r\n\r\nStill if anyone has other suggestions I think its always fun to take a
    look at it!\r\n\r\n:)\r\n"

    Gianotten</a> is a nice Bodoni rendition that doesn't get enough press IMO. Perhaps
    because it doesn't have the word "Bodoni" in its name? Anyway, check it out!

    cut, with some nice curves. A bit precious, but nice.

    Gianotten is beautifull! \r\nI think I will use it, in FF Acanthus I think the
    contrast between the thick and thin stems is less strong than in Bauer Bodoni,
    and l like it more dramatic!\r\nDonatora Pro is sweet, but too friendly for this
    project.\r\n\r\nThanks a lot again!\r\nFersch"

    Loana_ by Umberto Eco? The main character's name is Giambattista Bodoni. Giambattista
    was a mouthful when he was a kid, so he went by Yambo. Weird, fun book, at least
    that's what I thought.
