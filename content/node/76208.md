body: I've been working on a poster for a client and he totally hates it. What changes
  do people suggest I make to the design?

  body: A little more info would help. What message are you trying to communicate?
    Who is the intended audience? What reason did your client give for hating it?
    etc

  body: I can guess that this may be one of those clients who has a problem with communicating
    what he wants. Still, it's a fair bet that what he hates is the whole concept,
    so the problem isn't going to be fixed with any mere changes we could suggest
    to make it look nicer. And no matter what his problem with it is, there is significance
    in the fact that I'm looking at it and I don't know what the heck it is about.
    It's a fine diagram of a spinning stack of blank posters, though.

  body: "> trying to convey the idea of remaking and refining \r\n\r\nSorry but I
    still don't understand what your client is trying to communicate or accomplish
    with these posters. Employee motivation to work harder? Part of ad campaign with
    the product name not inserted yet? Something else?"
