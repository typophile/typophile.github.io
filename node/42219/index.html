<div class="post-content e-content" itemprop=articleBody>I've just started a typography project on Gothic (Blackletter) typefaces, and have noticed that some classifications of sans serif typefaces are also termed Gothic. Please can someone help in clarifying why these obviously different typefaces have the same terminology?
Thanks</div>

<div class=commentbody>American san serifs are called Gothic, whereas European sans are called Grotesque. Gothic, when referring to blackletter, is kind of slang, for non-type people, probably referring to "Gothic art, a Medieval art movement."
I pulled that from wikipedia: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gothic
There are more specifics, but that is the basic idea. I hope that helps. Also, check out http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blackletter for other ideas. I know wikipedia is not a scholarly resource, but it will give you some background.</div>

<div class=commentbody>In French, Blackletter types or scripts are indeed called "gothiques", referring to their medieval origins — it is no coincidence, then, that they were revived by Romantic artists, printers and typographers, who where equally fond of the Middle Ages, as opposed to the classicist bent of Enlightenment art (neo-classical) art and typography (Didot, Bodoni et al).</div>

<div class=commentbody>but the question remains: why were sans serifs called either gothic or grotesque, both of which imply detail and business in a way that is clearly absent from sans serifs ?

<div class=commentbody>Sans serifs were called grotesque because they were viewed as "extraordinary." I'm brainfarting on the term gothic.</div>

The only explanation I've heard is that the early sans-serif styles of the 19th century were so foreign to those with more conservative design sensibilities that they were seen as barbaric and offensive, and therefore they applied such derisive names to them. This of course, could be nothing more than an urban legend.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Then again, the subtle meanings of words such as awesome, awful, extraordinary, exceptional, special, remarkable, spectacular, and other such descriptors have undergone significant shifts over time, some even in complete reversal. These words could be another case of the language getting away from the words' meanings.</div>

<div class=commentbody>this is fascinating. i read that hitler considered serifs to be decadent and instituted official use of sans, but then again those guys liked the blackletter.... talk about grotesque !</div>
