    one or not, but you can see it below link.\r\n\"MAZDA BIANTE\"\r\nhttp://www.mazda.co.jp/normal.html\r\nAnd
    you can see another name if you would reload this page.\r\n\"MAZDA DEMIO\" \"MAZDA
    ATENZA\"\r\n\r\nThis Japanese article is the same one you read.\r\nhttp://www.mazda.co.jp/corporate/publicity/release/2008/200806/080619.html\r\nI
    think \"NEWS FROM MAZDA\" is the new typeface."
