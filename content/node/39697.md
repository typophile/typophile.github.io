  imagine this is someone's internal tool, but does anyone know more about it? Seems
  very handy."

  body: "OTTED is a very sophisticated OpenType table editor developed at URW++ under
    supervision of Dr. Juergen Willrodt. Besides the  option to edit the tables, it
    currently has for instance a couple of viewers (font, glyph, embedded bitmap and
    GPOS/GSUB), a consistency checker and a tool to copy glyphs.\r\n\r\nAt the moment
    OTTED is in use at URW++ and the Dutch Type Library and it will be offered via
    the DTL FontMaster web site shortly."
