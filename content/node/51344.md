  all eternity tormenting one fan at a \r\n                              time in terribly

  body: "In order to bridge the gap between machine and mind in AI, we perhaps need
    to use our imagination and model extrasensory phenomena. We need to model polymental
    structures with less of a definite gap between them, thus obviating the need to
    bridge that gap. After all machines can already read each other's minds, why not
    let them?\r\nThe Turing test is a milestone, but someday we are going to arrive
    at a definition of AI\r\nwhich also includes creativity and humour. How would
    a collective view creativity? As a shared resource? In human terms, moral oneupmanship
    and hypocrisy - would they disappear\r\nor reach a critical meltdown. It may be
    interesting to attempt models incorporating a great many simpler, even dedicated
    elements but with these extrasensory sorts of boundaries. Quanta of effect could
    be shared, and when a cluster provokes attention, \r\nthe sort of attention provoked
    might aggregate these quanta enough to \"do something\"\r\nin a model, convey
    information or affect chance - low energy cost, high effect.\"  - A Chadmon "
