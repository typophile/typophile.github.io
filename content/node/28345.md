  am working on a book in InDesign CS (which needs to go to the printer today, natch),
  and FF Bau regular is acting up.\r\n\r\nIt keeps substituting individual characters
  from the expert set, or from another typeface, willy-nilly.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/bau_3_4783.jpg]\r\nAs
  you can see, the last two lines are gibberish. \r\n\r\nIf I change typefaces, or
  even weights of Bau, and then switch back to regular, it fixes itself. \r\nUntil
  the next time I open it, of course, when it reverts to its old messed-up self.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/bau_4_6187.jpg]\r\nNow
  for some reason the last two lines are ok, but the date after Derrick's name has
  gone screwy.\r\n\r\nAny suggestions?\r\n\r\nI've trashed my InD preferences, I've
  cleaned my font caches, I've installed new versions of Bau direct from FontShop
  (thanks, Ivan!), but nothing seems to work. \r\n\r\nAny ideas would be greatly appreciated.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nben"

  body: I hate to say it but try reinstalling your system maybe its corrupted. Also
    disable any plugins for InDesign, but I bet its a system problem.

  body: If you're in a hurry, and it's going to be printed today, convert those lines
    to outlines. Probably you should to that for the entire book, and not take chances
    with the RIP. Sure nothing definitive.

    Disable Auto-activation (if applicable). Disable ALL fonts. Put just the fonts
    you need in InDesign's font-folder. Log out, log in.\r\n3. Create a new user.
    Try working in the new user account.\r\n\r\n(I surmise you are on OS X)\r\n"
