body: "A <em>classic workhorse</em> typeface, a <em>workhorse</em> typeface or just
  a <em>workhorse</em> are descriptions given to a font tool that performs dependably
  (i.e., trustworthy and reliable) under heavy or prolonged use.\r\n\r\nIn a nutshell,
  a font is a <em>workhorse</em> if it performs well whether it is used in a few paragraphs
  or in a 600-pages novel.\r\n\r\nA <em>workhorse-</em> or \u201Ceasy-to-use\u201D-
  type means that no matter what size, leading, letter-spacing, etc., the setting
  just \u201Cfeels\u201D right. It looks professional, it looks appropriate. \r\n\r\nTo
  mark a typeface design as <em>workhorse</em>, one should also know what the designer
  intended, know if the target audience is (over)used to the font, what attitude it
  conveys subliminally; how dark it makes the page, whether it suits fine at looser
  or tighter leading and what point size is most suitable for different lengths of
  copy and for typographic hierarchies (e.g., headings). Also know how the family
  fits together; how much emphasis does a bold give to the roman, and if the italic
  is different enough for emphasis.\r\n\r\nA <em>workhorse</em> font must has features
  such as small caps, true italics, extended language support and multiple numeral
  styles; eventually including technological solutions for setting maths. Monospaced
  fonts may fit in due to their special metric and screen properties.\r\n\r\nWorkhorse
  text faces are often main foundries bestsellers rather than scripts and display."
