body: I need some help identifying this font. It&#39;s scanned from a book adn the
  size was about 8 pt. The lowest row &#40;&#34;Goldfinger&#34;&#41; is scanned from
  coated paper, so the thickness is closer to real. <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/51980.gif"

    FF Kievit for titles and such.

  body: I know the feeling! I have been hunting everywhere. It resembles <a href="http://www.veer.com/products/typedetail.aspx?image=UMT0000057"
    target="_blank">Dolly</a> &#40;Underware&#41; and has some features like Plantin&#39;s
    serifs, but I can&#39;t find a match.

    is called Nordling. It&#39;s available from Berthold &#40;<a href="http://www.bertholdtypes.com"

    trying to find it.. the closest I could get was Fournier.'

    find was Bembo.

  body: I&#39;ll have to make a note of that one. Thanks for letting us know what
    it was. Odd that it&#39;s been around since 1995 and was not in the big yellow
    FontBook, or any other font book I have on hand.

    Indeed</a>, <a href="http://www.philsfonts.com/zzz_showing.html?sku=BQ901180X1P1&amp;start=1"
    target="_blank"> Nordling</a> it is. 1995, I thought it was a fairly recent design.
