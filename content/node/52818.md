  signage, so I thought I'd share it.  There seems to be some wiring too, which leads
  me to think the letters would have been backlit at one time.\r\n\r\nJH"

  body: "It's interesting how all of the characters in the first line lack any of
    the \"special\" design elements so abundant in the second line. My first impression
    was that two different fonts had been used, but upon closer examination it's clear
    it's the same font throughout. Had I been designing this sign I would have been
    concerned about this -- I don't like things that make viewers pause for no real
    reason -- on the other hand, in this situation the line break couldn't be better
    \u2013 it would be much worse if there were words containing only non-special
    characters intermixed on the same lines. \r\n\r\nThe \"o\"s look too small (no
    doubt because they do not overlap the x-height), and of course the letterspacing
    is atrocious (especially around the \"a\" in \"General\").\r\n\r\nSorry if I'm
    being too picky for some, but, hey, what better place to be picky than on Typophiles?
    I couldn't ask for better company.\r\n&nbsp;\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>When

    the luck of the draw. It happens, and in a very real sense it shows the font used
    could have been better integrated so that no single letter or letters stand out
    from the rest. The N for example could so easily have been designed in architectural
    fashion to match the majority of characters on the second line. Same with the
    A.\r\n\r\nWhat irks me about that font is the density of P, R, W and M compared
    to the other characters. They stand out like dog's balls. Font rating: one star.\r\n\r\nj
