  designing a wordmark rather than a pictoral logo. That being said, I am trying to
  find a clean, art-deco inspired typeface with some interesting ligatures, particularly
  an L with an inset E.\r\nSo far, I have found [[http://www.veer.com/products/typedetail.aspx?image=UMT0000422#characters|Cordial]]
  and [[http://www.veer.com/products/typedetail.aspx?image=TTT0000021#characters|Estilo]]
  (which I love - have already used it for my wedding stationery), but I would welcome
  a few more suggestions. \r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\nNatalie"
