  1900s like the attached. I'm looking for a serif typeface (either from that period
  or another)  to use as body text and haven't found anything I love yet.\r\n\r\nAny
  recommendations?\r\n\r\nThanks very much![img:sites/default/files/old-images/moerlein_labels_3590.jpg]"

    to Bodoni somehow? At a fairly quick glance it seems similar just with taller
    and wider serifs. "
