  body: "A couple random thoughts.\r\n\r\nI find your wording of the \u2018Results\u2019
    a little unorthodox to my ear and possibly confusing: Substitutes x to y. It\u2019s
    your use of the preposition \u2018to,\u2019 which doesn\u2019t usually get employed
    with the verb \u2018substitute.\u2019\r\n\r\nI\u2019m personally more accustomed
    to any of the following: Changes x to y; or Substitutes x with y; or Replaces
    x with y; or even Substitutes y for x.  \r\n\r\nThere are OT fonts that utilize
    a Fraction {frac} definition that can be usefully applied globally. I spurred
    Tal Leming to write the code. Font Bureau will be adopting it. I think there are
    others. \r\n\r\nCode for {frac} is one of the most variable out there. There is
    no standard, and folks really need to pay attention to what any given font does
    with it.\r\n\r\nIn your Other Features section, for Case-Sensitive Forms and Capital
    Spacing, you might indicate that in most implementations these features are not
    explicitly turn-on/offable \u2014 they are deployed only when the app\u2019s All
    Caps styling is applied.\r\n\r\nAlso in your Other section, the Optical Size entry
    is not the same kind of thing as all the other features. That is to say, strictly
    speaking, this is not an OpenType Layout feature, as the others are. \r\n\r\nAlthough
    there is an Optical Size {size} feature registered, no apps currently support
    it, and what you describe is not this feature. Instead, you seem to be describing
    Adobe\u2019s specific approach to naming optical instances of their type families.
    Other foundries use different schemes. And, again, this is not specifically an
    OpenType feature or even limited to OpenType format.\r\n\r\nBut, otherwise, nice
    compilation."

    to Wikipedia to illustrate each point involves an awful lot of extra clicking.
    If you're going to take the time to write up all the descriptions, you ought to
    also take the time to provide illustrative images. They don't have to be terribly
    large or elaborate.\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n\r\nT"

  body: "I realise that this is intended as a beginner's guide and therefore glosses
    over various technical details, but there's one example of this which I think
    will generate confusion. In your section on superscripts you state:\r\n\r\n<cite>
    Substitutes lining or oldstyle figures with superior figures, and substitutes
    lowercase letters with superior letter glyphs. Non-OT fonts may synthesise the
    effect. </cite>\r\n\r\n(I assume by 'synthesise' you mean 'simulate').\r\n\r\nSimilar
    wording occurs in a number of your other descriptions as well. Actually, non-OT
    fonts can't simulate this effect at all. Various <em> applications </em> will,
    however, simulate this by scaling and vertically shifting glyphs. This distinction
    is important since the distinction between having real or simulated superscripts
    has nothing to do with whether the font is opentype or not, but rather with whether
    the font contains proper superscript glyphs.\r\n\r\nA non-opentype font can contain
    real superscript glyphs, though they are less convenient to access since they
    usually involve switching to an expert version. Conversely, not all OpenType fonts
    contain superscript glyphs, in which case applications will fall back upon the
    same sort of simulation.\r\n\r\nAndr\xE9"

    form, but interference with the verb \"replace\" has given rise to \"substitute
    x with y\" (which purists will frown upon) and even the dreadfully confusing \"substitute
    x for y\" with the objects switched. To avoid ambiguity, better to stick with
    \"replace\"."

  body: "'You'd be surprised at the number of people who work with fonts but have

    use an application that takes advantage of the Unicode features (and the features
    are available in the fonts they use), an OpenType font doesn't appear to them
    any different from a Type 1 or TrueType font."

  body: "Jon, as your goal is to explain the advantage of open type to those who are
    not aware of it, I think it would be helpful and distinctive if you would make
    your site more ambitious, and explain and show with illustrations how the different
    features help in designing a page or ad or poster. \r\n\r\nFor example, small
    caps, being the same weight as lower case, can often harmonize better with the
    lower case as running heads or sub-heads, and in acronyms in running text. Showing
    \"before\" and \"after\" with caps and small caps would make the point visually,
    and show the advantage and additional flexibility that small caps give the designer.
    \r\n\r\nSimilarly, you could show old style figures vs lining in running text,
    and the advantage of old style. Then the advantage of tabular lining in tables,
    etc. \r\n\r\nAdobe has done a video with some of this in it: http://www.adobe.com/type/opentype/\r\n\r\nAnd
    here is Adobe's PDF, with some further information: http://www.adobe.com/type/browser/pdfs/OTGuide.pdf\r\n\r\nThis
    \"designing with open type\", with before & afters is a more ambitious thing than
    what you've done, but I think it would add something new and useful to what's
    on the web.\r\n\r\nYou could solicit examples of open type designs from folks
    here on Typophile, and chose some excellent examples. Then alter them to show
    how they would look without open type. This would give you some nice \"before\"
    and \"afters\" that would illustrate clearly the additional design powers that
    open type offers.  \r\n\r\n"

  body: "Here are a couple of articles I wrote for Graphic Exchange a few years back,
    which you might find relevant.\r\n\r\nThe first, <em><a href=\"http://www.shinntype.com/Writing/DigginIt.pdf\">Diggin'
    it?!</a></em> was just prior to OpenType, so it talks about \"expert typography\".
    However, it's the same stuff, and I think that's a point you could make, that
    these are not new state-of-the-art software effects made possible by OpenType,
    but traditional typographic niceties which have been generally made more easily
    accessible than in the first generation of digital fonts. \r\n\r\nIMO the most
    interesting OpenType feature is contextual alternates, not particularly for straightforward
    contextualization in scripts--which was available back in the days of phototypositor
    setting--but for pseudo-randomization, which is a new development. For instance,
    in <a href=\"http://www.shinntype.com/Specimens/Duffy.pdf\">Duffy Script</a>,
    there are four versions of each character, which the contextual alternates feature
    deploys to minimize the possibility of adjacent or near glyphs being identical,
    for a less traditionally typographic, more hand-rendered effect.\r\n\r\nThe second,
    <em><a href=\"http://www.shinntype.com/Writing/BigThing.pdf\">Big Thing</a></em>,
    was in 2002, introducing the new format.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
