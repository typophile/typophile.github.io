    <BR> <BR>However I don&#39;t think the window will often lie &#34;cover up&#34;
    as it does not have one. <BR> <BR>Mind you if the window went sideways it would

    in German-language books text runs from the bottom up &#40;except on large-format
    volumes that are laid front cover up in the bookshelf, so that the spine title

    is standing upright on a shelf, this arrangement is certainly more rational--because
    one inclines one&#39;s head more readily to the left than to the right--than the
    international standard, according to which text should be made to run from the
    top down. That one can read this spine text better when the book is lying on the

  body: Vincent, <BR> <BR>For the most part I agree. But, more often than not, it
    is impossible to run the name of the volume horizontal. Also you probably can
    read the book title from the cover when lying down. A stack of magazines? The
    top one, stack of books the top one. But books tend to have more personality than
    magazines. Well. at least that&#39;s the way it was in my day. <BR> <BR>Besides,
    I do not subscribe to the theory that just because you are left handed, you are
    left eyed, or visa versa. <BR> <BR>Also I am not sure we can move our heads to
    the left or right any easier. My old noggin just gets dizzy no matter how I look
    at it.  <BR> <BR>Kids, be kind. <BR> <BR>I figure we just read from left to right.
    There are those that don&#39;t. <BR> <BR>If we rotate our heads to the position
    of &#34;left eye up&#34;, that eye is closer to the beginning of the text because
    it is up. If printed the opposite way, then the opposite is true. Unless we tilt
    our head the other way and theoretically all things become equal. Assuming, naturally,
    that the head is central to the text. Have you ever noticed how difficult it is
    reading the spines tight against the wall. My books closest to the wall left,
    I keep my books that are right reading upwards. My right reading downwards books
    I keep closest to the right hand wall. Try it, you will thank me later. Especially
    when you are as old as me. <BR> <BR>But, still we have those stairs, I think you
    may fall down if you choose the picture on the left, increasing liability insurance.
    <BR> <BR>So still, I stick to my position, at least for now, with sign as illustrated
    in the right hand picture. <BR> <BR>I think, it was the right hand picture. Oh

    a different discussion, although personally, being from The Netherlands, I am
    used to downward titles, and also the point that it&#39;s readable when the book
    is on its back seems logical to me. <BR> <BR>But since this signage is more like
    the &#34;vertical text on a big object&#34; matter than a title on a book cover,
    I choose the upward option. Also consider that the windows are very big, the text
    as you see it in the picture is almost 1 meter high! The alignment changed because

  body: 'Another way to think about it is:  <BR>Where would one normally look for
    the start of the text?  <BR> <BR>On printed matter, the first place you look by
    habit is  <BR>the top. Text, whether it is right-to-left or left-to-right  <BR>goes
    top to bottom. So running vertical text down  <BR>from the top implicitly follows
    this rule.  <BR> <BR>Out in the world, everything starts from the ground  <BR>and
    goes up. There is no <i>top</i> outside to use as  <BR>a reference point, after
    all. So, text looks more &#34;natural&#34;  <BR>going from the ground up &#40;or
    from the horizon up&#41;.  <BR>On the other hand, if the text was near the top
    of a  <BR>building, running down might be better. <BR> <BR>I guess my point is
    that it&#39;s more important where you  <BR>think the eye will go first and start
    the text there.'

    is a fact that italics and cursives are much more easily read from bottom to top.
    This position is actually less of a departure from the normal horizontal arrangement
    for them than it is for roman type, the latter being perpendicular to the normal
    angle, wheras italics are turned considerably less than 90'

    <BR> <BR> <BR>1. you don&#39;t make design with &#34;rules&#34;. you make it by

    that the best thing to do is  a little reaearch, see other samples,  ask people
    what they think, try differentcolors and Shapes!!!  <BR> <BR>3. by the way,  what

  body: David, <BR> <BR>For the most part you design with rules. But the rules don&#39;t
    make the design. More often than not I would prefer the work of a non designer
    following well established typographical rules than a bad designer abusing them
    or working without knowledge. Admittedly however, some brilliant designs are successful
    by playing with, or teasing both the rules and their makers. <BR> <BR>This particular
    problem, I believe, has no traditionally established rules. Maybe one, running
    stacking type downwards, are to some, an offence. But this specific design problem
    has irritated many in the past. Solutions are only to be found by compromise of
    established reading habits and therefore reasonably, leads to, as we can see,
    &#34;individual&#34; solutions.  <BR> <BR>The &#34;individual solution&#34; is
    Caspar&#39;s, he is the designer, and he shows us his solution. <BR> <BR>And from
    what I can make of it, a good one. <BR> <BR>Now I could say what I would do, however
    that would be my solution, not representative of Caspar. His individual solution
    is of paramount importance. <BR> <BR> <BR>Gerald Giampa <BR>P.S. Hope you got
    insurance. I think when I fell I banged my head and now I am a nice guy. <BR>
