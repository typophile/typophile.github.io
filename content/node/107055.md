body: " A couple of years back, while cleaning the letterpress workshop at the KABK
  in The Hague, we had an amazing find. A package that hasn\u2019t been opened for
  some time. We opened it and found eighteen printing plates in mint condition. The
  printing plates, we soon found out, were made by Gerrit Noordzij and date back to
  the late 1960\u2019s. They contain a brief lesson about writing with the broad nib
  and, once familiar with this basis, writing and drawing some different techniques.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/GewoneLetters_05_4997.jpg]\r\n\r\nSince
  it seemed the plates are never published before, we decided to do so and made a
  book containing prints from the plates. Next to the plates we asked former students
  Albert-Jan Pool, Frank E. Blokland, Aad van Dommelen, Huug Schipper and Petr van
  Blokland if they still had old work and sketches with comments by Gerrit Noordzij.
  The result is a collection of sketches and material, together with five writings
  about the plates, Gerrit Noordzij and his contribution to the field of type and
  typography. \r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/GewoneLetters_02_4749.jpg]\r\n\r\nFor
