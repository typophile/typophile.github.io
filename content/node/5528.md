body: 'Sorry, everybody, if this is to some degree redundant. I&#39;ve combed through
  the most recent threads on this and related subjects, but haven&#39;t found anything
  specific to my situation. <BR> <BR>I&#39;ve been contacted by a multinational brand
  producting everything from scientific gear to cameras to printers. They&#39;d like
  to see a copy of my terms/licensing agreement that would allow them to license 10
  fonts that can be 1&#41; embedded in one of their software applications as well
  as 2&#41; be rendered as graphics. <BR> <BR>My fonts? pixel fonts&#40;!&#41; Licensing
  terms for this sort of usage? I have no idea! Fair price? Royalty-based or flat
  fee? Again, no idea! <BR> <BR>The letter was sent by a Legal and Intellectual Property
  Officer in the interest of the company&#39;s UI Design team, so I&#39;m thinking
  they have budgets for this sort of thing. <BR> <BR>My question: how the heck should
  I price my fonts, considering pixel fonts commonly come in one optimized size &#40;at
  least mine do&#41;. They&#39;re not nearly as complex as traditional typography.
  <BR> <BR>I want my rates to be competetive, but I&#39;m still pretty inexperienced,
  and have nothing to measure myself against. <BR> <BR>Anyone have any tips on how
  to put together an embedding license agreement? Should I ask them what kind of application
  they plan on using the fonts in, or how widely the app will be distributed? Or should
  I just stick to a generic rate?'

  body: '&#62; <BR> <BR>License fees vary a lot. I was in a similar circumstance recently.
    3-15% of sales are license fees have been charged. It could be quite a lot of
    money. Don&#39;t get nervous! Talk with a IP Lawyer that understands license and
    contracts. If you want to contact me off list, we can discuss this further. <BR>
