  some titles that may help me. Anything really, as long as it covers the basics.
  Also I'd apreciate a recomendation for a good book about type in graphic design.
  \r\n\r\nThanx in front."

  body: Maybe the [[books]] entry should have a kind of disclaimer at the top, directing
    people with questions about "starter books" to the [[triumvirate]] or even a new
    entry just with recommendations of this kind? For a first-timer, the [[books]]
    entry might be too complex...

    to say that it's not just Hrant's top three intro books, but mine as well. There
    aren't many things Hrant and I agree on, but that's one of them.\r\n\r\nT"
