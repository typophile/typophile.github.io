body: "Macula can be described as the \u2018impossible typeface\u2019, since its design
  is based on the concept of impossible objects. This optical illusion was explored
  into great detail in the 1930\u2019s by the Swedish artist Oscar Reutersv\xE4rd,
  and simultaneously made very famous by Dutch artist M.C. Escher.\r\n \r\nMacula
  comes in five styles, some are great to use just by themselves and some are specifically
  meant for use in layers. By stacking different styles of Macula on top of each other,
  beautiful multi-coloured typography becomes possible.\r\n \r\nEvery character in
  Macula has been designed in two versions, and to enhance typographic liveliness
  these two versions are alternated automatically by OpenType features.\r\n \r\nIn
  addition, stylistic alternates for A, E, N and O are included. These will probably
  please all you hipsters out there! ;)\r\n\r\nTo celebrate the launch of Macula we
  are offering a special price of 35 Euros per font until the end of December!\r\n\r\nMore

  body: "Very Nice Jacques, and really well done! Congrats, it's awesome.\r\nThese
    kind of optical illusions always fascinate me.\r\nFor reference, there is also
    an old Mecanorma typeface called Zelek that I guess you will find fascinating
    as well, it also explores this impossible style, but using rounded forms instead.
    If you want to have a look, here is a quick screenshot of the recently digitized
    Dick Pape's version\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/mecanormazelek_3576.png]"

  body: "It's a very nice approach, the alternates add a good touch in keeping it
    interesting in words. Of course the shaded version looks most interesting (to
    me at least) since the line/filled version is a bit too even.\r\n\r\nI quite like
    the method for shading, it's very simple but still give the illusion of shading. "
