  Says hy</a> purely as an my first font endeavor. I uploaded to as many sites possible
  hoping to see it used everywhere (however bad it may be.) Lo and behold, I do a
  search for graffiti fonts on myfonts and see a font that is extremely close to my
  original drawings. So close that it can't be a coincidence: <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/wilton/shallow/\">Shallow.</a>\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/comparison_3976.gif]\r\n\r\nLooks
  like the designer softened up the letters, added whatever ornament necessary to
  distinguish it, thickened the strokes, and made some much needed improvements. Is
  this legal? Probably so, because I labeled it as freeware, right? \r\n\r\nNot that
  it bothers me, my original was crappy anyway. I'm just surprised. \r\nSlightly flattered.\r\n"

    such a thing, legally I mean, as a freeware license and if so how it reads.\r\n\r\nI'm
    guessing you can't do anything unless it is financially worth it to you."

      fonts can be downloaded and used free of charge for both non-commercial and
      commercial use. Although these fonts are available for free, the author retains
      the copyright, meaning that restrictions usually apply to alteration, reproduction,
      publication and distribution of the font. Practically no author will allow you
      to sell his/her font for profit or to include it in another product or CD-ROM
      compilation without permission and in most cases you will not be allowed to
      use parts of the font to create your own font. Detailed copyright information
      is usually included in the corresponding font zip-file as readme.txt, copyright.txt
      or an equivalent text-file.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was a nono after all."

    were \"inspired\" by anything else. \r\n\r\nNice to see even 1001fonts has a license
    which supports the designers best interest.\r\n\r\nThat said, I still don't know
    if this would be lucrative to pursue with any legal action."

    questioning the legality of the issue.

  body: Good news! I wrote an email to myFonts.com and they weren't convinced on the
    similarities. BUT, just when I was about to write a reply, they e-mailed me again
    to say the foundry that 'created' it, has agreed to take it down. Score one for
    the little guys!

    Any chance of you updating Kosal, where you draw inspiration from another source?

    the new font started from yours and tweeked a little bit. Details are a little
    bit too close to call the \"ripoff\" typeface original."
