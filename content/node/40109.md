  body: This is interesting. It's a little to programatic or rule detived to be REALLY
    great. But it's got promise. The lc c throws me a bit. What use to you intend
    it for? What's the history behind the font?

  body: "Could you elaborate a bit on 'rule detived'? \r\nI'm not developing this
    font for any specific project, I've just got this ideal fun (but not too fun)
    sans-serif font brewing in my head and I'm trying to bring it to life . It's definately
    got more work to be done, but the basic model is pretty much there. I plan on
    adding a lighter and heavier weight once I nail this one.\r\n\r\nFeel free to
    knock it around some more, because I'd love it to be REALLY great\r\n"

  body: "What I mean by rule derived ( sorry typo before) is that some of the shapes
    in your font take their form from a consistent approach to the forms. So when
    I look at the tail and join on the lower left of your lc a  I see it is identical
    to the lc d and u. This might be okay but it might not be. When forms repeat too
    often or too completely an opportunity for richness is lost. Similarly the shape
    of your lc c is the same as the left side of the bowl of your g. This was a quick
    way to do it & it's okay-ish but I think it is definitely not ideal.\r\n\r\nYou
    have come a long way quickly using rules. But now you have to focus on the well
    crafted exception! Do you see what I mean?\r\n\r\nSome of the questions you have
    to ask yourself have to do with what size the font will be used ( and \"Every
    size!\" is not a really good answer) and what purpose it will have. So for example
    this might be a novelty face meant for packaging. Weird choices could be more
    okay in that case. Or you might want the font to be useful for magazine Titles.
    Or you might want it be work at subhead sizes or for a magazine's article's body
    text. Each of these choices implied slightly different things in terms of contrast,
    optical tweaking and other purely typographic factors but also in terms of style
    because the smaller the font is used the more likely it is that you are going
    to want to draw on traditional forms in some way. \r\n\r\nPut another way - to
    be great the face will have to serve a purpose. The idea is that you can't hit
    something unless you aim at it.\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: "I would also consider making the white spaces in the h & n more silimar to
    the b & d.\r\n\r\nThe new c is better. Have a look at the top & bottom and thing
    if they should be the same or not. Also, what about the e... It seems a bit pinched
    to me."
