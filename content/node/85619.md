  with all kinds of words. Each word looks to be using different fonts.\r\n\r\nFor
  the word LOVE, I would love (to pun intended) to know what kind of font is it?\r\n\r\nHere
  is the youtube video link >>> [[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_AU1yyy_At4]]\r\n\r\nI
  attached a print screen of it to this post.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance for your help."

  body: "Have you considered the case this is not an actual font?\r\nIt can be easily
    constructed using 2 different typefaces:\r\n\r\n(a) One for L & E\r\n(b) Another
    for O & V (using letter D for the O)\r\n\r\nI say so, because if you remove the
    left part of each glyph,\r\nyou can read the remaining as L<strong>D</strong>VE
    with L,E having a different weight\r\nand being a different font from D,V.\r\n\r\nFivos\r\n"
