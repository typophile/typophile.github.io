  to material. Here's a newspaper article on the theme, not very deep, but food for
  thought. Now if political candidates could specify what font their name appears

  body: "This seems to agree with another recent article, which was a subject of a
    thread here, where a study showed that hard-to-read typography leads to people
    applying more critical thinking to what they read.\r\n\r\nWithout going into extremes
    of illegibility, perhaps I might take the liberty of recommending Manfred Klein's
    [[http://www.moorstation.org/typoasis/designers/klein03/text/nearaldus.htm|Near
    Aldus]] as the typeface of the future based on this new scientific research!"

  body: "Psychological researchers have picked up on how the crude comparison of type
    settings can produce laboratory results. \r\n\r\nNews media are interested in
    the \u201Chidden persuaders\u201D aspect of this.\r\n\r\nIn turn, mini-memes circulate
    within the design community.\r\n\r\nReadability and dis\uFB02uency are interesting
    theories, but they have no practical value for typography.\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: "On further reflection, this scientific knowledge could be misused to help
    convince people of the truth of a dishonest argument, in political or other fields.\r\n\r\nJust
    sort your arguments by their nature...\r\n\r\nWhere part of your argument is logically
    sound, but goes against the existing prejudices of the audience, use a hard-to-read
    type;\r\n\r\nWhere another part of your argument is concordant with the prejudices
    of the audience, but has a logical flaw, use an easy-to-read type.\r\n\r\nThus,
    you would stand a chance of changing the existing opinions of your readers, even
    though your argument was not valid, because the good parts of your argument, at
    each point, would be the ones that got traction, while the bad parts got missed
    or the difficult parts overwhelmed."

    they tend to do it with sex, not science. And, marketing firms are already starting
    to apply scientific reasoning to design decision making, and using it to sell
    colourfill. That ship has sailed.\r\n\r\nWith your statement, you now raise a
    <strong>much</strong> larger philosophical question regarding the ethics of rhetoric
