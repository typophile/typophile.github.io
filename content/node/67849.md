body: "Good Morning Typophile,\r\n\r\nI'm usually pretty good at identifying typefaces
  but I've spent a long time searching for this face and I'm stumped. It's very similar
  to Eloquent from Veer and ITC Century Bold but there are subtle differences to note
  in the capital R, S, O, W and A among others. Also, this face is wider and slightly
  heavier than Eloquent and ITC Century Bold.\r\n\r\nThose fonts just don't set as
  nicely in capitals as this face does. Does anyone know what it is?\r\n\r\nThanks
  for your help!\r\n\r\nLauren\r\n\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/18446_1372073298971_1145913165_1131419_2915560_n_4406.jpg]"
