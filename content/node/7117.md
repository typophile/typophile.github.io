  body: I think the closest ones could be 2 extensive typeface families from ITC -
    "Avant Garde Gothic" & "Bauhaus" - which were now part of Monotype Imaging since
    they acquired ITC (including Letraset Fontek) in 2000.

  body: I don&#39;t think it&#39;s Chalet, as bloomingdale&#39;s logo predates that
    font by many years. I wouldn&#39;t be surprised, though, if Chalet &#40;particularly
    the &#39;70&#41; was inspired by the bloomingdale&#39;s corporate identity stuff.
    <BR> <BR>My personal guess is that it&#39;s a modified version of <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/linotype/itc-avant-garde-gothic/itc-avant-garde-ce-gothic-book/testdrive.html?s=bloomingdale%27s&amp;p=48">ITC
    Avant Garde Book</a>. Certain details match, like the narrow &#39;s&#39;, the
    tiny aperture on the &#39;e&#39;, and the tall dot on the &#39;i&#39;. <BR> <BR>I
    vaguely recall that some of the characters in Avant Garde had &#34;bubbly&#34;
    alternates. However, it&#39;s quite hard to track these down. My best guess is
    that Bloomingdale&#39;s commissioned custom font modification for their logo and
    catalog.

  body: Actually, the logo was designed by Ed Benguiat &#40;at least that&#39;s what
    he told us&#41; and <BR>he said that it was a combination of Futura, <BR>his Bauhaus
    typeface &#40;i think&#41; as well as - something else &#40;that&#39;s what he
    said; &#34;something else&#34;&#41; , so - it&#39;s not really one typeface, but
    a combination of two or three, plus manual rendering, obviously &#40;like in the
    O&#39;s&#41; <BR>But there&#39;s a load of these kind of geometric typefaces such
    as Bauhaus, if you need to imitate or something like that &#40;like the fore-mentioned
    &#39;chalet&#39; typeface&#41;  <BR>anyway, it&#39;s a nice logo - i like it <BR>Regards,
    <BR>Amp84

    but he wasn't more specific than that.
