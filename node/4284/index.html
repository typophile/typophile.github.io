		<div class="commentbody">I don't mind the placement of Fatum offset to the left; actually, I think it looks pretty good in that general vicinity. The changes you've made certanly improve readability. Is there another lc Y you could use to avoid/minimize that hole between 'r' and 'y'? <BR> <BR>I think this marque is great for printed materials, but you might have some translation issues when going to clothing or vinyls for a window. The size difference between Fatum and Eurydice would make the former very small on an embroidered shirt or apron, and the 'grunge' face might not be easy to cut out of vinyl. <BR> <BR>Good progress.</div>

<li>I don't think the Garamond is working here.  The italics just don't look consistent enough to be used at display sizes. <BR> <BR>2.  I Think you need to consider the historical implications of your typefaces.  The average member of the populace won't know that Garamond is a Renassaince face, but the subconscious association is probably there nonetheless.  If you're doing something with historical meaning, why not consider a face from that period? <BR> <BR>If you're stuck on the sans/serif combination, you might try a lapidary like Sophia or Lithos with a display Roman like Trajan.</li>

		<div class="commentbody">@ DP:  <BR>Thank you for your opinion.  <BR>I think I got historical association exactly where I wanted. The thing is, I didn't want it to look Roman (or Grecian), I wanted it to look early Baroque, Classical in Louis XIV kind of way. Fatum Eurydicae sounds to me like a title of H. Purcell's play, or some of his conteporaties.  <BR>Think about it like that movie Gladiator - although it takes place in ancient Rome, theme, characters, costumes etc. are Baroque, not Antique.</div>
