  body: "This is an odd font. Most narrow high contrast serifs I can find, like [[http://www.veer.com/products/typedetail.aspx?image=ADT0004439|Onyx]],
    or [[http://www.veer.com/products/typedetail.aspx?image=CTT0000265|Ambroise]],
    or [[http://www.veer.com/products/typedetail.aspx?image=RRT0011410|Bodoni Black
    Condensed]] have all got ruled serifs. I suppose someone could have modified one
    of these (or similar) fonts to create a new font, so perhaps looking among the
    freebies would be worth doing. I searched 'narrow serifs' at both Veer and MyFonts
    and did not see anything closer than those I mentioned.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"
