  if anyone here sees any subtleties that I might have overlooked or if anyone had
  any feedback. The whole thing is hand lettered and started out as an italic but
  was converted to a upright script.\r\n\r\nThe top one is my final and the other
  two are just to show my process.\r\n\r\nThanks!"

  body: "Well what do they add? It seems to me they only complicate the design and
    it would just as well, most likely better, without them. The bottom ones feel
    cleaner to me, and much more pleasing to look at, though I do like the upright
    script. \r\n\r\nAlso, none of the lock-ups seem to work that well. The placement
    of 'in' doesn't ever feel quite right (though the bottom ones come closer to feeling
    right than the top one)."

    search has something to do with the sun.\r\n\r\nhttp://wankh.com/images/ankh_symbol/ankh_symbol_385x261.jpg\r\n\r\nBut
    considering the word faith, might I ask, is it relevant to associate the mark
    with Christianity? If so, the f could be prodded into a shape more reminiscent
    of the shepherd's staff (which it also reminds me of)."

  body: What kind of organization is this, and what message are they needing to send
    to the audience?  Right now the style looks like an old game show, or a vintage
    cooking product.  I don't get faith and family from this treatment.  Maybe you
    could describe a bit more about what the brief demanded and how this fulfills
    it?

  body: "This is intended for a non-denominational Christian project. The message
    I was trying to send is a friendly one, with heavier, slightly rounded type without
    being to bubbly. I wanted to make it look slightly classic since the concept behind
    the project is that tradition drives family. The client also does not want to
    scream that this is a Christian logo, with crosses, beams of light and halos.
    \r\n\r\nI agree, the final does need to be cleaned up a bit with the center part
    locking the piece together. I like the idea of opening up the counters in the
    'f' characters to make it look more like a staff with a cross in it, rather than
    the ankh symbol. What do you guys think, anymore suggestions? Should I try a version
    without the type treatment?\r\n\r\n@evanbrog My wife said the same thing once
    she saw it, but she is Egyptian so it makes sense for her to see an ankh rather
    than an implied cross. In all honesty the 'f's in the logo are an homage to The
    Artist Formerly Known as Prince. ; )"

    with no colour on the final... and my personal taste directs me to the centre
    design.\r\nif you've already made the decision to go with the top one thats cool,
    i can't see any client not being chuffed with it..\r\n\r\nkia ora bro"
