body: "Hey guys/girls, I had a little bit of extra time tonight and this is what became
  of it. Purely a collage of a lower case Didot Bold 'y'. Maybe I was thinking about
  Pirates of the Caribbean that I watched earlier, not really sure. Opinions? Throw
  it out? Keep it? I kind of like it...but what do you think? It was kind of random
  so either way it's all good.\r\n\r\nMy only feeling is that it might be a tad top
  heavy, I'm thinking maybe to add a few y's in the bottom left corner (black) to
  give some more movement to it. Maybe even move the title down there?\r\n\r\nSometimes
  I do random stuff like this with no real intent and I like to see what others think
  because as 'art' it's hard for me to critique myself.\r\n\r\nThanks.\r\n\r\n-Dave"

  body: "I agree with it being top heavy. I'd make the tag line \"y marks the spot\"
    more prominent by modifying you layout: try playing with the darher letters converging
    towards the white area that contains the tag line.\r\nAlso, maybe consider making
    it a bit rougher and dirtier in texture. You could add some transparency to the
    letters to give it some colour differentiation, thus building up the texture that
    you have going there.\r\nTry to play with the concept that the text is bringing
    to it: If y marks the spot, what is the spot it is marking?\r\nEnjoy!"

  body: "David, I think you've missed the essential beauty of that \"y.\"\r\nYou've
    picked up the strong diagonals in your collage, but negate the contrast of it's
    gentle teardrop descender. \r\n\r\nYou have no \"curves\"... it could have been
    \"v marks the spot\"... if you chose the \"y\" then explore it's unique shape.
    Just a suggestion.\r\n\r\nBut have fun, it's the only way you can tease beautiful
    accidents.\r\n\r\n"

    Ezer's</a> home page. It's essentially a portfolio, but also shows some interesting
    letterform collages, found object photos, doodles, etc.\r\n\r\n"

  body: Why make an X out of you y's. It might make a nice statement Y marks the spot.
    That would be a Herb Lubalin type (haha) of solution.

  body: "I have to agree with Norbert the terminal is definitely worth exploring,
    you do have a kind of cyrillic vodka label crossed with swastika thing going as
    well. As far as art/illustration the treasure map/'y marks the spot' concept is
    hindered by the large grey y on the right and the need for a strapline, although
    you might want to modify your concept away from the pirate theme (what's on tonight?:)
    \ (btw Norbert your link to Oder Ezer's site isn't working).\r\nTim"

  body: Thanks for all the comments, just getting an outside response really. I abandoned
    the project. Maybe I'll go back to it someday, maybe not, just a creative venting
    piece really (evidently not so creative :) )

    it start to look like a swastika? It's not completely, but it's really close.\r\n\r\nJust
    saying."
