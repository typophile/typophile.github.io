  freely available? I'm looking to test some fonts that have Western Latin, CE, Baltic,
  and Turkish glyphs.\r\n\r\nThanks!"

  body: "Chris,\r\n\r\nThat is an amazing link. Not only can you see the same text
    in various languages, you also get some background information on them, too. I
    just checked my own native language (Finnish), and the information seems to be
    correct. "

  body: "Mili,\r\nThanks, I am glad you found it useful. It is amazing to see the
    difference in set length for different languages as well. My family came to the
    U.S. from Greece but there has always been plenty of historical information on
    the Greek language. I also look at that site to see what was the basis for many
    of the languages and scripts that I am not familiar with.\r\nWe have a Cellist
    friend here who speaks Finnish. She love to travel to Finland in Summer. She even
    has \"Sibelius\" on her car license plates :-)\r\n\r\n ChrisL"

  body: ":^) \r\nit's advisable to travel to Finland in Summer... the difference in
    temperature between a hot Summer's day and a cold Winter's day can be about 60
    \xB0C. My English husband doesn't enjoy the Winters here, they're too long and
    cold."
