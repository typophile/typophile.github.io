  body: To me, the fact that there are such strong responses to even the idea of a
    Comic Sans documentary (whether for or against) indicates that it's an emotional
    topic, a typeface that fulfills an important role within our visual culture, and
    therefore perfect subject matter for a film.  Anything so polarizing ought to
    be scrutinized and documented.

  body: "I think that Comic Sans works well for an advertisement for a nursery school,
    for example. It has the problem that it doesn't work well for a lot of the other
    purposes for which it is being used - it is used in place of Hobo, in place of
    Papyrus (!), in place of a comic book lettering face, in place of Dom Casual...
    and not working well in those cases.\r\n\r\nPeople who don't know much about typography...
    don't see the need to augment the meagre default typographic resources of the
    Windows platform even with those offered by, say, sites like Dafont, or CD-ROMs
    with 1000 Windows Fonts without hinting. This is neither news nor really the fault
    of Comic Sans.\r\n\r\nThere will be bad typography - and Comic Sans will end up
    a part of it. But then, so will Arial and Times Roman, even though there isn't
    all that much wrong with those faces."

    Vince Connare seems to be a good sport about it). Making fun of Comic Sans is
    about as innovative as jokes about airline food.
