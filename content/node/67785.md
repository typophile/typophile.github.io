  local festival's 75th party. It is a separate event from the festival itself. Since
  the dogwood festival started in the 1930s, I was thinking that an art deco/streamline
  design style would be appropriate. My intent was to meld deco/streamline with an
  organic sensibility. I met with the organizers today and they were excited about
  this direction as they were also working on a 30s theme with a swing band for the
  event. Originally I was just working on the words \"Dogwood Festival\" the client
  now asked me to add \"75th Jubilee\". Is it too much in that style? My plan was
  to have the rest of the invitation copy set in a sans. I am not a type designer
  - parts of this look like it's working to me, but there are elements that appear
  awkward. I've been staring at this so long, fresh eyes and some expert advice from
  the forum would be greatly appreciated. \r\n\r\nThanks,\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/dogwoodfest_6068.jpg]"

  body: "When I first looked at it I read \"Dogsood testival\". I read the 'w' as
    an 's' because that's how an old italic 's' would look. If you lowered the middle
    part of the 'w' I prob wouldn't read it as an 's'. Even if you don't read it as
    an 's' the middle part of the 'w' still seems like it's too high up.\r\n\r\nI
    read 'testival' cus the top thin part of the 'F' kinda disappears when the lower
    part of the 'g' dominates that area. For some reason the 'F' looks like a small
    'f' instead of a capital 'F'.\r\n\r\n'Jubilee' looks a little thin.\r\n\r\n75th
    looks nice though and the type overall is very nice. I think it suits the event."

  body: "Don't scale down '75th jubilee'. The stroke weights should all be the same
    \u2014 think of it as if you actually hand wrote this with a pen. \r\n\r\nI'd
    also like to see more interaction between words. Right now they all seem haphazardly
    nested with each other \u2014 and '75th jubilee' definitely looks like an afterthought. "

  body: "First thanks for the feedback, very perceptive suggestions.\r\n\r\nHere's
    the next round. I tweaked the \"w\" and re-drew the \"F\" so it would read as
    a capital F not lower case. I also worked on the alignment and keeping all of
    the words the same size and weight.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/dogwoodfestv2_4880.jpg]"
