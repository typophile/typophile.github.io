body: "A poster I have designed focus' on the dichotomy of being <strong>dependent</strong>
  on the existing power grid and being <strong>independent</strong> of the grid using
  renewable energy. As I explored various solutions I came upon an observation; \"in
  dependence\" appears to say that one is dependent upon something. For example, \"Adam
  is in dependence of a wifi connection.\"\r\n\r\nHowever, I realize the previous
  statement is structured wrong, in that the words \"in dependence\" can not be used
  in such a way(please forgive my elementary understanding of sentence structure...
  I believe it's being used as a prepositional phrase).\r\n\r\nIs the previous statement
  technically correct? If not, then what does the \"in\" component of the word represent?
  Would it not be more appropriate to use \"monodependent\" or \"unidependent\"?"

    but this suggests that he is in a psychological state of dependancy, not that
    he is dependant on something like e.g. a wifi connection.\r\n\r\n\u2018in-\u2019
    in the word \u2018independence\u2019 is a prefix indicating \u2018without\u2019.
    If one has independence, it means one is <em>not</em> dependant."

  body: 'In English, we sometimes say that someone is "in denial"; what we are actually
    saying is that the person in in (a state of) denial. Adam, similarly, may be in
    (a state of) dependence on his wireless connection. But, (what is) more important,
    the sentence as it is now structured fails the most basic requirement for written
    communication: it muddles, rather than clarifies, your message.'

  body: 'There are two different Latin prefixes that mean different things but, as
    it happens, both take the form "in-". One of them indicates negation and is cognate
    to the Germanic prefix "un-" or the Greek prefix "a-"; examples: <em>infidelis</em>
    = not faithful, <em>invisibilis</em> = not visible. The other one indicates movement
    toward and is related to the preposition "in"; examples: <em>inflammare</em> =
    to set something on fire, <em>influere</em> = to flow into.'

  body: "<em>All right then, what about \"flammable\" and \"inflammable\"?</em>\r\n\r\nThey
    both mean the same thing: that something is burnable. American usage is \u2018flammable\u2019
    and British usage is \u2018inflammable\u2019. In this case the prefix \u2018in-\u2019
    means into or towards. \r\n\r\nYes, the prefix \u2018in-\u2019 has two different
    meanings."
