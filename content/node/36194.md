  it redesigned.  I found a really great blog posting [[http://cameronmoll.com/archives/2007/05/skinning_ms_sharepoint_with_st/]]
  that has an amazing(ly small picture of a) redesign.  For those of you that may
  be interested I will post my progress here in the blog.  \r\n\r\nStatus - Installed
  and working for multiple users. No mean feat!"
