body: "Hi\r\nI'm trying to use GREP for the first time for a simple find/replace.
  I have an endnotes section for a book where the space between the note number and
  the note entry needs to be changed to a tab. For example, a note reads \"13.*space*Ibid.,
  p. 36.\" and it needs to read \"13.*tab*Ibid., p. 36.\" So for the double-digit
  note numbers, I've put this expression in the find field:\r\n\r\n~b?(\\d\\d)\\.
  \r\n\r\nwhere the last character in the expression is a space; and this expression
  in the Change To field:\r\n\r\n~b$1.\\t\r\n\r\nBy including the paragraph return
  symbol in the front of the expressions, I was hoping to avoid finding any of the
  two digit occurrences within the text of the endnote. But no luck--those end up
  getting changed during the search/replace. Is there a more definitive symbol for
  a paragraph return (I tried using \\r as well, with no luck), or a better expression
  I can use? This will work if I punch through manually and \"find next\" on the instances
  within the note text, but there are about 1500 endnotes in this book and I'd rather
  not sit here for the next hour!\r\n\r\nthanks\r\ntom"
