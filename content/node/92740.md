body: "The boot camp training of CCNA is very useful and essential to pass the CCNA
  exams. It is a limited time span training (usually a 7-day camp) that is effective
  for both the experts and the new comers in the networking field. It is necessary
  due to fact that you should prepare yourself mentally as well as obtain the practical
  knowledge before the exam. It avails the professionals with the practical and demo
  scenarios so that they can learn in real time situations. It builds up the foundation
  of new technicians and enhances the practical knowledge of CCNA professionals.\r\nThe
  boot camp offers the training regarding installation, configuration, and operation
  of LAN, WAN and dial-access services for small networks. The training helps you
  in making yourself distinguished from other certified professional in the market
  by providing you the knowledge on the most desirable areas by your employer- that
  are routing and switching, security and infrastructure design. \r\nWith the help
  of real time scenarios and repeated practical measures, the boot camp training makes
  you more proficient and expert in all the areas of networking. After certification,
  you can use your hand knowledge and practices on your job to grow yourself as well
  as your organization. It will directly lead you to minimize your configuration and
  installation errors, which minimizes the cost as well as your efforts. \r\nAlthough
  these trainings are very expensive and take much mind preparation for spending thousands
  of dollars, but these are effective because these thousands of dollars would be
  converted into millions of dollars afterward. After becoming a certified professional,
  a lot of job offers from competitive organizations would be waiting for you. But
  remember; only passing the exam is not sufficient. You have to take training for
  the sake of your practical knowledge so that when you go for work in the market,
  you can prove you skills by implementing them. You would be responsible for a lot
  of operations on networking such as routing, switching, configuration and security.
  So, you would be able to handle those operations only when you pass your CCNA exam
  after boot camp training.\r\nThe professional people are selecting boot camps due
  to their individual construction of candidates, absolute theoretical and practical
  directions and competitive environment within the candidates.\r\n"
