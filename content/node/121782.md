    the name Cartoon for the Font Company is no where to be found, at least so far.
    \r\nCancun is the one made by or for  Corel Corporation in 1992. I don't know
    how to get a legitimate copy other than by purchase of Corel Draw. Still being
    sold?  I don't know if this is the same version as the one made for the Font Company.

  body: "Obvious clones and rips include Gizmo Ssi, from the notorious Southern Software,
    and Signboard with no authorship claim.\r\nCandide is Bay Animation, perhaps an
    independent work. I don't know of any legitimate way to acquire it.\r\nUnfortunately
    Mr. Trafton's Cartoon [Fresko] seems to be missing as a legitimate font in the
    digital world.\r\nDon"
