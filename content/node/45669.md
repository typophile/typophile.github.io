  body: ":^)\r\n\r\nOk. Just thoughts:\r\n\r\nk -- the top-right stroke would benefit
    from an angled terminal in the other direction. Would match the elegance of the
    bottom-right stroke.\r\nn and r (italic) -- the connection is too slim.\r\ne --
    it appears upside-down, I think, because the eye is smaller than the open counter.
    Could be a personal taste issue. Note that the bold e doesn't have the same issue
    for me.\r\nW -- again, a personal taste issue, but that middle bar seems odd to
    me. But not so much in the bold.\r\n\r\nI think the figures might be too wide.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    middle of changing all kinds of things foreseen and not foreseen. The things you
    mentioned are certainly more than worth considering ... \r\n\r\nk \u2014 still
    thinking of lowering the connection, not changing the terminal.\r\nn/r italic
    \u2014 I'll look into it\r\ne/W \u2014 I wanted these to be odd shapes. I'll take
    a closer look if I can refine them.\r\nfigures \u2014 Do you mean the spacing
    or the numerals themeselves?\r\n\r\nIf you like I could send the (not finished)
    font files for a closer look. Let me know ..."

  body: "Amazing Jos. \r\n\r\nI thought the dagger was an italic \"f\" at first glance.
    \r\n\r\nI guess it's a matter of taste, but the open \"tail\" on your lowercase
    g really bugs me. Reminds me of Trebuchet. "

  body: "Feliz Anivers(\xE1rio). Happy Birthday. I said that I would use <a href=\"http://www.josbuivenga.demon.nl/delicious.html\">Delicious</a>
    on a bus card. This morning, after taking care of the boys I decided to work on
    a project for <a href=\"http://www.photoblog.com/storage001/2008/05/25/\">Anivers
    Buivenga</a> (as my wife went to visit her mother in Arkansas; as I did not want
    to waste my time watching vampire movies...). As you can see, this is indeed squared
    so that there is nothing flying around. The logo is a imitation I did off that
    gif on your website. I hope it's not so out compared to the original, except that
    the F, is a extrapolation made from Anivers \"F\". The card is based in a interesting
    measurement (point system?) : The Quadratim. It is, as far as I know, a scale
    used by typographers in the grande Lisbon area. I don't know if the guys of Oporto
    use this measurement, or if it is a portuguese standard. Put plain and simple
    it is a 8 point square. The card measures 32x20 Qradratins, or Picas 21P4x13P4,
    Inches 3.55\"x2.22\", 90.3x56.4 mm. The background is based on the photoshop background
    he seems to like; the color is a recipe of mine that  resembles the color pearl.
    Red pms 202 U + Black or a dark cool gray.\r\n\r\nThe font is ANIVERS Regular.
    I did not started a tread with this cause I think it belongs here ;-)\r\n\r\nCheers\r\n\r\nAndr\xE9"

  body: "Was fun tho playing with your font. I don't have bold and I did not want
    to change anything in the font, or ad artificial stroke. The kern is default,
    when possible. I find the regular weight kind a light. That's good. Jos, the font
    that I downloaded don't have readme file with it - I guess you could include some
    text in there. As for the Quadratim it is interesting; I will dig for more info
    and try to make more sense next time. Also, it is typical of hand setting type.
    You are conditioned to space everything within the square.\r\nI can drop a pdf
    of the card for you (with crops and bleed, or the fh file) on the mail."

  body: "Andr\xE9, I would very much like to recieve the pdf, but maybe it's better
    to wait 'till the new release is ready. I'll provide you with the finished font
    files. The weight of the regular is fairly standard \u201480 em for the vertical
    stems on a 500 em height for the lower case\u2014 but I'm pleased you find it
    good. I'ld like to know where you had to change the kerning/spacing ... maybe
    I can use that for my new release.\r\n\r\n@ Alex - Glad you like it ;-) I don't
    think it will be as successful as Museo, but I hope it will hit the charts at
    some level."
