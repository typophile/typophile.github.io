  body: "Concerning the owners of the foundries advertising, listed above, Schwartz,
    Sowersby, Bi\u013Eak, Hoefler, Frere-Jones, Olson, Spiekermann and Tankard have
    all received editorial coverage in <em>Eye</em>.\r\n\r\nAlso, art director Simon
    Esterson uses fresh typefaces every time. For instance, the recent issue which
    had a big article on Massimo Vignelli was set in Schwartz\u2019s Helvetica revival,
    making for a brilliant tonality.\r\n\r\nI have yet to achieve suf\uFB01cient cachet
    to appear in the <em>Reputations</em> feature, but Mr Esterson did use two of
    my types in an issue, which was awesome, so I am inclined to think favorably of
    the publication, and have in fact advertised in it on several occasions before
    and after.\r\n\r\nI don\u2019t know whether Fedrigoni papers have been used for
    printing Eye, but I wouldn\u2019t be surprised, as Mr Esterson also specs a lot
    of different paper stocks \u2014 several in each issue.\r\n\r\nI draw attention
    to this symbiotic ecology not to diss it, but because it\u2019s really quite an
    interesting and productive publishing model. After all, editorial coverage of
    graphic designers in Eye doesn\u2019t promote their work, because Eye\u2019s readership
    is mainly graphic designers, not those who hire their services. However, features
    on the work of type designers are <em>de facto</em> advertisements for their product,
    to a key segment of their market.\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s a top quality printed type
    specimen in its own right, or, as foundries such as TypeTogether have used, with
    \uFB02yer inserts, a means of distribution."

    that's totally OK, as long as there's no covert \"synergy\" there (and I doubt
    there is). The sort of thing that might leave a bad taste however is if a given
    issue has an ad for a foundry <em>and</em> a glowing article about it (even even
    it's all legitimate). But since type design remain a small industry that sort
    of thing can be hard to avoid.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    by far the worst ever. It is hagiographic and so uncritical that it hurts. I considered

    around to it (yet).\r\n\r\nBTW I am not talking about the design and type used

  body: "Speaking of Monotype, this reminds me of a little project of sorts I've been
    toying with.\r\n\r\nThe IBM Selectric Composer, with its nine-unit system, produced
    output that, except for the limitations on the mechanical tolerances of the Selectric
    element, looked like type. If one compares character widths, though, M and W should
    have been eleven units, not nine, in width, to be consistent with the scale of
    the other letters.\r\n\r\nI've been looking at the relative sizes of the superscript/subscript
    characters and the second-level superscripts/subscripts in four-line mathematics
    to see what widths would have to be assigned to them for an imaginary daisywheel
    typewriter using the eleven-unit corrected Composer widths for the primary faces.\r\n\r\nApparently,
    the best fit would be a seven-unit system for the superscripts and subscripts,
    and a five-unit system for the second-level superscripts and subscripts.\r\n\r\nThe
    five-unit system could be taken whole from that used on the IBM Executive for
    Documentary and similar typestyles. The seven-unit system <strong>could not</strong>,
    however, be the one used on the Model 50, 65, and 85 Selectrics (and also the
    highly obscure Mag Card Executive), but would instead need to be more like the
    one used with ATF's Self-Spacing Type (since the characters in the former system
    were wider than its being a seven-unit system might imply; as with the Composer,
    the widest characters were compressed, not having their full relative width, so
    as to make a less coarse unit system).\r\n\r\nIt's well, I suppose, that laser
    printers took over before the power of microprocessors tempted someone to make
    a fancy daisywheel typewriter that produced typeset-quality output and which did
    even go to the length of providing four-line mathematics. I might have loved its
    complexity, but it would have driven others insane..."

  body: Well, the irony of who brung Eye, in respect of their advertisers, is that
    for a long time now Eye has predominantly featured the ads of independent type
    foundries and designers, and not those of the Monotype-owned companies. An editorial
    might have pointed out that while Monotype have a long, fascinating and nicely
    archived history, and continue to do important technological development, from
    a <em>design</em> perspective the more interesting and creative stuff is happening
    elsewhere, lot least among Eye's regular advertisers.

  body: I agree, John. But, in order to be financially viable in this century, you
    have to make expenses.  In order to do this, you sometimes have to court those
    with deeper pockets. Certainly, the biggest type houses take the least chances
    and do the expected kind of work.  Those leading edge designers often are at thin
    margins and cannot afford much in the way of supporting trade mags.
