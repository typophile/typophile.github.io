  I wanted to install them so I can scroll through them when using applications for
  design (adobe) \r\nI do not have much experience with font installation from a third
  party...Macappware Fonts https://macappware.com/software/1000-opentype-fonts/\r\nAny
  advice on how to do this without slowing my computer down and also how I can do
  this in a better manner than to install just a few at a time? It seems to be so
  tedious, any advice from experienced people here? If you have any better font downloading
  programs and or software please do share!!!\r\n\r\nThanks a bunch!!\r\n\r\nDana"

    good!
