body: "This doesn't really exist ... I am creating a business plan for such a program
  as a part of my Masters of Distance Education degree.\r\n\r\nBasically, this would
  be a graduate diploma course offered by a community college in Ontario that has
  a restriction of six years graphic design experience to enter, including 6 years
  work experience; a two year graphic diploma, plus four years experience; a three
  year diploma, plus three years work experience; or a four year MFA degree plus two
  years in the business.\r\n\r\nThe program would run two years, part time, with courses
  lasting 4 months (6 in total). It is designed for working graphic artists who would
  do this part time. Ideally world expert typographers would be the teachers (one
  of the advantages of being online is that  you don't need to have 5 or 6 experts
  living in the same city to offer the course). The other advantage to online is that
  flooding 25 to 30 graduates into any one city year after year would result in a
  surplus of graduates, while online these graduates would be scattered throughout
  the world.\r\n\r\nSuggested courses would be:\r\n1. Typographic History: The development
  of the alphabet, historic books like the Lindisfarne Gospels, Book of Kells, Gutenberg
  Bible, etc., down through to modern ages. Include exploration of other alphabets.\r\n\r\n2.
  Calligraphy: A hands on course teaching calligraphic skills (might be tricky to
  do online).\r\n\r\n3. The Business of Type: A course that would look at the business
  side of type, helping build licensing agreements, marketing processes, places to
  sell, etc.\r\n\r\n4. Initial techniques: Teaching the use of Illustrator and FontLab
  for creation of glyphs. Major project would be to create an upper case alphabet
  in a display format. (Decorative because it would be a first font, and most first
  fonts are crap. As well, Uppercase only generally happens only in Decorative, and
  these fonts are less rigorous to create???)\r\n\r\n5. Basic font: In this one the
  students would build a sans serif font with a complete Western Latin alphabet, including
  basic ligatures and accented characters necessary for all European languages.\r\n\r\n6.
  Open type font: In this one the students would build a serif  font ( with the western
  Latin alphabet, plus oldstyle and lining figures, true small caps, and full ligature
  sets. The expectation is that this font would be of commercial quality to be sold.\r\n\r\nMy
  questions to you all:\r\n\r\na) what do you think of the concept in general? Would
  this program succeed (draw students)?\r\n\r\nb) what do you think of the courses?
  Is it the right mix? Does calligraphy fit? Other courses or subject matter that
  should be covered?\r\n\r\nI appreciate any help any of you can offer. Thanks."

  body: "as a design student here in Ontario, I'm saddened that although I'm taught
    typography, the font design element is totally missing.\r\n\r\nI would love to
    have had a course that would teach me these things as a 1 year add-on to my 3-year
    design program, but once you start adding silly requirements of design experience
    and all that I just can't make it.\r\n\r\nLook, when I'm done, I'm shipping off
    - once I go out into the design world I'm not going for 4 years and then going
    back, I'm gone.\r\n\r\nI think you need to set the standard high and if they meet
    the standard, they make it, if they don't they don't, but making silly arbitrary
    prerequisites like years of design experience and a 2-year diploma go a long way
    to alienate potential students, but still don't solve the problem of students
    who have those requirements but still aren't up to snuff.\r\n\r\nI say have an
    entrance portfolio and interview and use that instead."
