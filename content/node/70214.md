  :)\r\n\r\nI've got an annoying problem (but then again, aren't all problems annoying?).
  Well here goes:\r\n\r\nI've pursued an old idea of splitting a font in half \u2014
  one font (half) containing the first set of fragments of each glyph, the second
  font (half) containing the rest of the fragments. I'm calling the font Unify 1 and
  Unify 2.\r\n\r\nThe idea is then to write something with a readable font, then duplicate
  the text you've just written and add Unify 1 to the first copy and Unify 2 to the
  second copy. To be able to read the whole thing, you need to put the two copies
  on top of each other and voila! It's complete.\r\n\r\nThat was the concept. Now
  to the problem, which I've explained in this short video:\r\n\r\n[[http://www.jokke-svin.dk/other/send/unify.mov]]\r\n\r\nWhat
  to do?\r\n\r\nI really hope somebody out there might have a clue as to what's going
  on here.\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\nJoaquim \r\n"

  body: "I've produced a (proprietary) font that does this.\r\n\r\nIt only works for
    one case of the alphabet, not other characters.\r\nType \"A\" and the left half
    is set.\r\nType \"a\" and the right half is set.\r\nSsOo YyOoUu HhAaVvEe TtOo
    TtYyPpEe LlIiKkEe TtHhIiSs.\r\n\r\n**\r\n\r\nIt would also be possible to extend
    the principle to the whole character set, using OpenType alternates, but you would
    still have to \"double\" the text.\r\n\r\nSo, the first thing to do would be to
    run a \"Find/Change\" script that doubles everything:\r\n\r\ne.g. \"Find A, change
    to AA\" and so on for all characters in the encoding.\r\nThen in the \"contextual
    alternates\" feature:\r\n\r\nsub A A' by A.alt;\r\n\r\nWhere A is the left side,
    and A.alt the right side.\r\n\r\nAnd so on.\r\n\r\n**\r\n\r\nIt would be easier
    if OpenType did one-to-many substitutions, but it doesn't.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

    separate glyphs.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Aa_5979.png]\r\nSelecting
    the \"right side\" glyph selects the inside of the letter.\r\n\r\nThis technique
    is long-winded to set up, but does have its merits:\r\n1. Only one font\r\n2.
    No layering of text boxes\r\n3. Easy to experiment with global colour schemes
    by editing the colours in the Swatches palette\r\n"

    'dot' style which you can see here a few slides in - http://www.reservesca.com/index.php?act=viewProd&productId=69\r\n\r\nYou
    can adjust the offset in Area Type Options>Offset>First Baseline of course, but
    even in the drop-down options there is no setting that by default positions the
    'supplement' style exactly as it is positioned using the standard 'Type Tool'.
    (as opposed to using the 'Area Type Tool')\r\n\r\nIt would be interesting to hear
    why the Area Type Tool handles typesetting offsets differently, and if there's
    anyway to solve the problem."

  body: Thanks Nick, but I think you're misunderstanding me. I've already designed
    the whole thing, and my problem is, that Unify 1 offsets upwards (I'm explaining
    everything in the video).

    in FontLab Studio. But the whole things doesn't really seem logic to me. The two
    fonts are based on the exact same font, and I haven't changed ANY values. I've
    just modified the glyphs."

    not occur at all in InDesign\u2026\r\n\r\nIf you can, try setting your type in
    InDesign and you should see that you won't have the vertical offset problem\u2026
    you can just do a copy and then paste in place or duplicate layer\u2026\r\n\r\nWould
    love to hear from someone about the discrepancies between the apps and the type

    one of the designers from Adobe\u2026\r\n\r\nMike"

    are identical. Do not allow the font creation software to automatically generate
    these: set them manually.\r\n\r\n2. If the problem persists when the vertical
    metrics are identical, then if may be a font bounding box issue as Nick suggests.
    The best way to resolve the problem in that case is to put an identical glyph
    in each font with an outline taller and deeper than the tallest, deepest glyphs
    in each font. This will equalise the vertical bounding boxes."

  body: "@ Mike \u2014 Aaah Illustrator hehe. Well, I guess I could tweak the settings
    in the software after the font has been generated to compensate for the offset,
    but the best thing would definitely be to have them identical to begin with to
    avoid any tweaking afterwards.\r\n\r\n@ Nick \u2014 That sounds like a possible
    solution to my problem. I had a feeling that it might have something to do with
    the BBox, but didn't know how to tweak those settings in FontLab as they were
    grayed out in the Font Info dialogue. Thanks for the heads up :)\r\n\r\n@ John
    \u2014 I checked, and they're exactly identical (and manually set). I just tried
    to create a glyph (called \"fixer\") which I positioned so the BBox values of
    the two fonts are identical as well, but the font still offsets :(\r\n\r\nWhat
    to do?"

    I designed Output and it's supplement I tried adding just one glyph that would
    match the others in height but still had the same problem.\r\n\r\nAgain, it's
    really only a problem when setting text with a text box / area type tool in Illustrator
    or Photoshop but even still it would be nice to know why."

    those apps know better than mere typographers!\r\nIf I was designing a layout
    app, I would position the top left of the em square of the first line of type
    at 0, 0 coordinates of the text box, just like real type. \r\n\r\n**\r\n\r\nAs
    per my initial post: doing this in a single font has some practical advantages."

  body: I went through all glyphs systematically to narrow it down to which glyph
    caused the vertical offset, and it turned out it was the lowercase d. Is it common
    that the lowercase d defines the vertical offset of a font?

    while were at it, get them to make the accessing of OpenType features more consistent

    and OT feature access completely different in each app\u2026 I wonder if they've
