  what typeface to use for the \"39\xA2 USA\" lines.\r\n\r\nCan you identify these:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/06_benf4_600s_4825.jpg]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/06_porter_500s_4311.jpg]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/06_sugarray_400s_4181.jpg]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/06_trueblue_500s_3722.jpg]\r\n\r\nNow
  I am working with this:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/stamp2_4158.jpg]\r\nI
  still need to include \"Saguaro National Park, AZ\"\r\nAny ideas on placement?\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nVictoria"

    Times New Roman, Sugar Ray Robinson looks like various weights of Futura (along
    with some compressed grotesk for the \"39\"), and the birds one looks like Franklin
    Gothic.\r\n\r\nI can't see your design - did you export it as CMYK maybe?\r\n\r\n

    inappropriate.
