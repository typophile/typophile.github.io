  Just thinking about the process for now.\r\n\r\nSay I want to allow a user to enter
  into a web form the name of a musician in the native language, it gets stored in
  the database and can be displayed later for other users. Preferably the form would
  not make the user explicitly specify a language or character set -- it would just
  accept a utf8 string and pop it in the DB.\r\n\r\nTo keep it simple, I'd want to
  use in the HTML a font with the broadest selection of unicode characters. But it
  would have to be a font commonly available in web browsers.\r\n\r\nI checked some
  fonts in FontBook on my Mac and it seems that Arial and Tahoma are the best candidates.
  Verdana not so great.\r\n\r\nIs that about the status of things?"

  body: I don't think it really matters much what font you specify in your html.  Web
    browsers will normally use whatever font is necessary to display the text, as
    long is there is some font installed on the machine which contains the characters.

  body: 'Which languages are important to you? Although Tahoma and Arial have more
    characters, Verdana does have support for Vietnamese and Extended-Cyrillic as
    well as the regular European languages. As Tom indicated if you''re happy with
    fallback for Arabic, Hebrew, CJK, Thai, Indic languages etc., etc., then Verdana
    would be as good a choice as any. '

  body: "Lucida Sans Unicode ...? Just for its (extensive) Cyrillic set? Its Greek
    is basic, Eastern Europe languages seem well covered, but the rest of the set
    is dedicated to weird symbols. Besides, it has no bold or italic.\r\n\r\nCalibri
    would be a better choice."
