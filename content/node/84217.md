body: "Hi.\r\n\r\nAre there any rules for how the text on a book spine should be oriented?\r\n\r\nFor
  example, when the book is lain with the front upwards, English books have the baseline
  of the text on the bottom (I only have two English written books, but looking at
  some pictures, others seem to follow the same rule). On the other hand, Czech books
  (for example) have the baseline at the top, the text is rotated 180 degrees.\r\n\r\nThank
  you in advance for explanation, eventually additional information or references."
