body: "As has been noted in some recent threads, a kind type designer will assign
  Unicode points to all glyphs so that users can access them in non-Opentype-smart
  applications.\r\n\r\n<A HREF=\"http://www.mufi.info/\">MUFI</A> defines an unofficial
  standard for assigning codes in the Private Use Area to a lot of characters and
  ligatures needed for the precise transcription of Medieval texts. It's prominently
  linked from the Wikipedia entry on Unicode, and it includes many ligatures found
  in modern fonts, like fj and tz.\r\n\r\nThe fonts I'm working on are never going
  to be used for Medieval work, but since it otherwise doesn't matter where in the
  PUA my extra glyphs go, I feel I may as well put my tt ligature at U+EED9, which
  at least <em>someone</em> has already agreed corresponds to a tt ligature. I think
  it's even reasonable to find approximations; for instance, my swash P alternate
  can go in the place meant for \"capital P with flourish\". It's not really the same
  thing, but it's a P, and that's better than random. MUFI spans E000-F2FF, so glyphs
  without an applicable MUFI encoding should start at F300, because if half the special
  characters turn into the right thing when a text is changed to a MUFI font, the
  other half should become .notdef, not the wrong thing.\r\n\r\nWhat are your opinions
  on using these codepages this way? Do you think it's a good idea, or a bad idea?"

    comment</a>), so why two new threads (including <a href=\"http://typophile.com/node/39657\">this
    one</a>) for the same issue ...\r\nAlso see <a href=\"http://typophile.com/node/32164\">this
    proposal</a> and google for even more related threads.\r\n\r\nIndeed most applications
    have a serious problem with accessing unencoded glyphs. But this is the problem
    of these applications, not of fonts. It is not up to font developers to work around
    applications' shortcomings (mostly). And it has nothing to do with type designers
    being kind or not-so-kind.&nbsp;&nbsp;;-)\r\n\r\nPUA may allow MUFI for faster
    decisions and agreement among members, but PUA per definition excludes the idea
    of 'standard'.\r\n\r\nThe more interesting question is, how can type designers
    make sure that <em>OpenType-savvy</em> applications can 'map' all unencoded alternate
    glyphs back to encoded glyphs, so that no GIDs end up in the document? (Which
    would be as bad as PUAs since they are font dependent and non-standard too.)"

    be allowed full use of a font they've bought? I feel that if an appropriate ligature
    or alternate is available to someone who is using my font to make a web banner
    in an old paint program, the results will reflect better on my typeface.\r\n\r\nAnd
    if you want to rest all the responsibility on the software programmers, I think
    applications that use OpenType lookups should be able to preserve the plaintext
    whether the replacement glyph is encoded or unencoded. That seems more like something
    I'm willing to think of as \"not my problem.\""

    you say that it is wrong to blame low-cost applications since they do not cost
    much, but it is fine to blame fonts since they cost something?\r\nIn OT fonts,
    the relevant information is there: glyphs can be 'mapped' to Unicode codepoints
    directly via 'cmap', but also indirectly via OT layout tables. Of course it were
    helpful if applications would not ignore half of the information ...\r\nSeems
    using low-cost apps has its price too. But having font developers pay for it,
    and be it with (more or less) hacks?\r\n\r\n<cite>I think applications that use
    OpenType lookups should be able to preserve the plaintext whether the replacement
    glyph is encoded or unencoded.</cite>\r\n\r\nIf you enter plaintext in your application
    and apply OT features, then the application already knows the plaintext and may
    preserve it, and it shoudl not matter if glyphs are encoded or not. So this is
    neither an issue nor your original question. \r\nThe issue is access to 'special
    glyphs', like inserting them via glyph palette. Then, the application has to find
    out, first of all, what a glyph's codepoint is. And here, PUA is just as bad as
    is mere glyph ID because PUA is non-standard. Change the font and see the effect.\r\n\r\nHowever,
    if you make fonts for a special audience whom you may please with PUA, and if
    the result is a gif where character code does not matter anyway, why not."

  body: So it's only a problem if the glyph is pasted in directly? The only people
    doing that will be those who can't get the glyph through OT features, and who
    know full well what they've done when they do it, and probably don't need to be
    protected from their own decisions. I don't see why giving it a codepoint is such
    a bad thing, then. You made it sound like it would create problems for the OT
    users.
