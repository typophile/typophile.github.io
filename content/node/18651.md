  \r\n\r\nhttp://www.howconference.com/\r\n\r\nI was wondering if anyone here has
  been to one and felt they got their $1,100 out of it? Someone in another group said
  they didn't learn anything they didn't already know, but I don't know anything...Chank
  is the only Type name I remember seeing on the schedule.\r\n\r\n(I know I'd like
  to do some photography in Vegas and haven't been in 25 years)"

    body: "> If type is your bag...\r\n\r\nI love type mainly because I could never
      write good, or draw, and it allows me to make things that please my eye. I have
      come to appreciate well-made fonts, and love all kinds of different letter styles,
      but I can't imagine having the patience to actually make a nice one.\r\n\r\nAnyway,
      type as it relates to design would be of more interest to me than designing
      type (but God bless the type designers!)\r\n: )"

  body: TypeCon (and ATypI) are type-centric but they're not totally type-designer-centric.
    Check out the past schedules for an idea of the talks and workshops.

  body: I had decided to take the plunge, and went to register for this today (I was
    hoping to get some good photos of the neon and lights in Las Vegas also) and found
    that two of the classes on the first day that jazzed me to start with, are already
    filled up six weeks ahead of time. So unless they can add repeats, I guess I just
    found where the rest of my PC to Mac conversion money is coming from.
