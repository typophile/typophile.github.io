  think this should be an easy one for anyone that knows something about type at all,
  I can't place it, personally.\r\n\r\n\"World on the edge\"\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/headline_5431.jpg]\r\n\r\nThanks
  in advance!"

  body: The price comes from the contents of the OpenType font which includes symbols
    and cross-platform compatibility. These are spread across several fonts in the
    legacy version. If you just want the basic character set for Mac or PC, you can
    get it for <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/singles/itc/itc_officina_sans_display_black/">$39</a>.
