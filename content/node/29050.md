  body: its not exactly the same, but <a href="http://www.lineto.com/The+Fonts/Categories/Text+Fonts/Akkurat/Normal/"  target="_blank">Akkurat</a>
    is definitely a grotesque with a modern edge.

    been extremely helpful. i think i am going to go with Whitney - its quite a departure
    from Franklin but completely suits the identity im working on.\r\n\r\n"
