body: "If it had been a one-off I'd have let it slide, but today I saw a second instance
  of a <a href=\"http://www.fontshop.com/fontlist/genres/skyline_serif/\">serif skyline
  face</a> on the Book Cover Archive. The covers were designed by two different designers,
  so it should be something readily available. Does anybody know what typeface was
  used on <a href=\"http://bookcoverarchive.com/book/the_essential_tales_of_chekhov\">The
  Essential Tales of Chekhov</a>, edited by Richard Ford, and <a href=\"http://bookcoverarchive.com/book/letters_from_abu_ghraib\">Letters
  from Abu Ghraib</a> by Joshua Casteel? I thought it might be an interpretation of
  Corvinus/Quirinus, but the angular S, thinning in the middle, doesn't match.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Chekhov_abu_ghraib_4859.jpg]"
