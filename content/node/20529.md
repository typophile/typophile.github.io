  body: "Thank you very much guys, I actually just found out that the \"Friedrich\"
    text is a free font called Broadview Regular found here: www.WebpagePublicity.com/free-fonts/b/Broadview
    Regular.ttf\r\n\r\nAnd the other typeface for \"Racing\" I was told was Felt something
    but it doenst match up to anything I've seen yet.\r\n\r\nStephen Coles, if you
    look at the \"R\" in Racing it doesnt match any of the following you posted. Also
    the \"a\" is different like the upside down , backwards g heh. instead of the
    cursive style \"a\".\r\n\r\n"
