    to exist. A lot of people talk about making letters move, taking them into the
    4th dimension, blah blah blah, but 99% of it is just boring crap. This is the
    real thing, and I for one will be spending a lot of time looking at/into it, and
    I&#39;m sure I&#39;ll learn a lot from it. Keep it up! <BR> <BR>hhp '

    A great tutor of mine from many years ago, Antony Froshaug RIP, would have loved
    the innovation and the lateral thinking behind &#39;Nomad&#39;. I can&#39;t wait
    to see it used on the cinema screen...perhaps innovation will breed innovation

  body: ' Help! I think my childhood Spirograph set is posessed! <BR> <BR>I am really
    impressed by the interaction of the various cells, and the surprising gestalt
    legibilty. This really would be an interesting face for movie or web page titles.
    And it&#39;s fun to poke at the interactive characters and see how they react.

    <BR>My only major design concern is that the &#34;D&#34; and the &#34;O&#34; are
    a bit too similar, making them hard to distinguish. Have you tried making an &#34;O&#34;
    out of three overlapping concentric cells, rather than overlapping portions of
    the cells, as in the &#34;D&#34;? <BR> <BR>Congratulations on a truly interesting
    experiment. <BR> <BR>David Thometz '

  body: ' Biologically speaking the cells which make up the basic building <BR>blocks
    of the human body are structurally the same. Yet, in the face <BR>of this, we
    still develop into recognizable individuals. How it this <BR>so? Because each
    individual has a distinct DNA code which differs <BR>from all others. The result
    of all this blending of individualism is a <BR>active structure called society.
    <BR> <BR>Nomad is an interactive typeface based on this socio-biological <BR>diagram
    of human society, where basically each character <BR>&#40;biological entity&#41;
    consists of independent cells each with their <BR>own given code. Once typed,
    these codes work together to form the <BR>Nomad characters. As these characters
    grow into words, sentences <BR>and eventually paragraphs they in turn from lager
    reactive structures <BR>each with their own unique identities. <BR> <BR>Unlike
    other typefaces in its similarity to biological creatures, <BR>Nomad relies on
    its complex structure and its ability to react to <BR>touch to create a more fluid
    relationship between the user and itself. <BR>Based on the aforementioned principles,
    I have designed two prototype <BR>versions of the Nomad typeface. One, which manifests
    its independent <BR>of external stimuli through motion, and the second which has
    an <BR>interactive component that reacts to external stimulus, thus allowing <BR>it
    to recognize the presence of the user. <BR> <BR>Handwriting allows one to establish
    the existence of its creator as it <BR>differs from person to person. Nomad act
    like handwriting in a network <BR>situation expressing the existence of the other
    user through the state of <BR>its interactivity or motion. As a result of this
    type of mediation we can <BR>begin to be felt across the network. <BR>&#40;originally
    Nomad was developed for touch screen&#41; <BR> <BR>Thanks for the advice. It encourage
    me to do another project. '

    I&#39;ve seen in a long time. But I wouldn&#39;t use the word legibility anywhere
    near it. It&#39;s art based on letters, but would fail as a means of passing on
    information. And it just kept me from work for a surprisingly long time :-&#41; '

    use to set a text block. That&#39;s why I was careful to use the word &#34;gestalt&#34;
    when describing its legibility. &#40;Is &#34;readability&#34; perhaps the preferred
    term here? All of my dictionaries give almost identical definitions for the two
    words, i.e., &#34;capable of being read.&#34;&#41; <BR> <BR>In any event, it is
    fascinating how the cells&#39; overlapping shapes coalesce into recognizable glyphs
    that can and do, in fact, succeed in communicating information. Not large amounts
    of information, mind you, but with proper attention paid to spacing, setting and
    context, this typeface certainly lends itself to display/head information. <BR>

    <BR> <BR>In regards to legibility, the Dutch designer Peter  <BR>Mertens once
    said it best: &#34;Typefaces are legible.  <BR>If some things are not legible,

  body: ' Thanks for making the distinction between legibility and readability. But
    by doing so you have effectively validated the relevance of both! The RvL quote
    is really too simple-minded. Saying &#34;legibility does not exist&#34; is like
    saying &#34;communism does not exist&#34;. No concept can exist in its pure state,
    sure. But even though the Soviet Union was not -and could not have been- a &#34;pure&#34;
    communist state, it was certainly more communist than the USA. In the same way,
    Quadraat is more legible &#40;and certainly more readable&#41; than FF Extra.
    Pretending otherwise is often an escape from having to take the non-artistic issues
    in typography/type_design seriously, and this leads to inferior communication.
    <BR> <BR>Note that intentionally downplaying legibility is something else. It&#39;s
    OK, as long as you have good reason to do it. But legibility &#42;does&#42; exist,
    and how! <BR> <BR>hhp '

  body: ' Hah. Good points. I should say that I haven&#39;t  <BR>bought RVL&#39;s
    argument outright. But I do think it&#39;s  <BR>useful as a way to put legibility
    in context. <BR> <BR>You can see how, in the case of Nomad &#40;and even in  <BR>the
    some of the old Ray Gun stuff&#41; how the seeming  <BR>abandonment of legibility
    is just another design  <BR>&#39;element&#39; or &#39;treatment&#39; &#40;for
    lack of a better  <BR>word&#41;. That diminished legibility requires readers  <BR>to

    can be powerful or  <BR>delightful or engaging. Used improperly you could  <BR>lose
    your audience and fail to communicate your  <BR>message. <BR> <BR>In essence I
    agree with you Hrant. It takes a good  <BR>understanding of the rules of legibility

    <BR> <BR>small points: <BR>Seemed a little slow on my mac.  Is there something
    that can be done to speed it up/make the file size smaller?  If the animation
