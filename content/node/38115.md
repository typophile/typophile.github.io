  body: Prolly. The way the loops interact with each other seems to indicate that.
    A bit too convenient for it to be coincidence.

  body: There are people that can make that kind of thing from scratch. I was looking
    at a book with examples by someone with a name something like DiSpigna, and his
    hand lettering was waaaay nicer than just a plain ol' font. Part of me wanted
    to idolize him, and the other wanted him to be locked up and put away for making
    me feel so inadequate.

  body: "Doesn't mean anything, <em>especially</em> in the digital age when you can
    copy-paste certain portions of the characters to achieve consistent shapes when
    hand-lettering, be it on paper or on screen. Bottom line is we don't have a clue
    what it could be, so our guess is that it's hand lettered. We could be wrong though\u2026"
