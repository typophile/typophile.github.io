body: "hey can you give me some advice on a logo I'm working on please. The logo will
  be on a the label of a pre made gourmet sandwich. The sandwich brand uses hand made
  stone-oven baked bread is fully Irish owned and uses all Irish products. I started
  using the hills in the back to represent this and the wheat to represent the traditional
  method in which their bread is cooked (apparently this is unusual) I'm having trouble
  with the font and as being done on a low budget I need to use a free font. I just
  feel that its missing a traditional, quality for money, good food feel all suggestions
  welcome!!\r\n\r\nThanks[img:sites/default/files/old-images/logo_4959.jpg]"

  body: "The rolling hills background doesn't look like hills to me even in an abstract
    sense. I do like the colors but would try to make the hills part of the logo not
    a background. \r\n\r\nThe name seems a bit hokey to me too - especially for the
    market. Sounds a bit \"AS SEEN ON T.V.\"\r\n\r\nIs the name fixed or possibly
    changeable. Right now nothing in this logo (name or design) suggests Irish owned
    or ingredients. Do steer clear of cliched stereotypes and iconography though.
    I'm Irish BTW :)\r\n\r\nHave a look at some nice branding by [[http://www.pinkincdesign.co.uk/portfolio_obriens.html|Pink
    Inc]] who do most of the [[http://www.obriensonline.com/|O'Briens Sandwich Bars]]
    work."

    say gourmet to me. It sounds like something Don Cherry would endorse. I'd suggest
    using the last name of the owner to give it a traditional, family-owned feel.\r\n\r\nI
    like what you've come up with, but it doesn't say \"traditionally-made with local
    ingredients\" to me. Even your image of the wheat is a bit sterile-looking.\r\n\r\nSince
    you don't have the budget for a font, why not hand-letter the logo?\r\n\r\n -

    irregular like mosaic tiles. I'd also lose the border.\r\n\r\nYou might also want

  body: "I know people are going to hate me for this, because this type of thing is
    bad to promote...but there are sites out there that do logo designs as contests...and
    they provide the font that is used. worth100.com is one that comes to mind. You
    get plenty of options and they do it for around $100-$200. I've seen some pretty
    good ones on there.\r\n\r\nBut...on another note, if you want to make it like
    a family business, I think hand lettering it might be a great idea! It gives it
    a home-y feeling, which can relate it to your Irish background and your family
    business. And who doesn't love a home-made sandwich?!\r\n\r\nAs for the hills,
    might be a good idea to drop them in favor for the wheat. Unless you get hills
    looking like hills, they are probably going to look unprofessional. A great tip.
    \"Keep it simple\". Good luck!"

  body: "Courtney: Logo design contests are a very very bad idea. I wouldn't discuss
    them 'round these parts.\r\n\r\n\r\namyloo: I like how this is shaping up. Try
    rendering the sun in the same style as the hills. Even just a golden circle between
    the hills would read as a sun. Wavy lines would also work, and would help break
    up the sharp angles at the bottom of the mark.\r\n\r\n\"SANDWICH!\" in upper-case
    doesn't work. It's already got an exclamation point.\r\n\r\nI can't see any rationale
    for the way the text is aligned in either of these logos. The text is too far
    away from the mark and seems like a separate element. Imagine that the mark is
    a letter, and use the same kerning or leading you would use otherwise.\r\n\r\nTry
    placing the text to the right of the mark instead of below it.\r\n\r\nYou should
    try a version with Fontin Semi, so the angles of the text align to the angles
    of the mark. I still would love to see a hand-lettered version if you think you're
    up to the challenge :-)\r\n\r\n - Lex"

  body: If the bread is baked in a stone oven, it's a pretty big deal, as is the all
    Irish products. The logos above don't reflect either. Look at TOGO's sandwich
    icon... that could be changed around to look like hills? This is an icon from
    a logo I did for a bakery that has a stone oven. [img:sites/default/files/old-images/Stone-Oven_4740.gif]
