body: I need help identifying the font used for the title of the movie, the Transporter.  The
  font could be an all italic font.  The S seems fairly distinctive.<img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/54578.jpg"
  alt="Transporter">

    Gothic Condensed Bold</a> has an S like that, but the R doesn&#39;t match. <BR>
    <BR>Seems like a Red Rooster font looks like that too. Be right back.

  body: Nope, not Red Rooster. It <i>was</i> House Gothic, but it was in the old version,
    not the current House Gothic 23. <BR> <BR>I don&#39;t think that old version is
    sold any more.

  body: Thank you, Mr. Yanega.  Up to this point, I hadn&#39;t located ANY font with
    an S of that particular shape after having gone through thousands.  Even though
    the R is different, it&#39;ll do.
