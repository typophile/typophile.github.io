body: "Hi Hrant, Raph, William and the other experts!\r\n\r\nI have a question. Hope
  its a good one and someone may offer a good solution.\r\nI am actually working on
  a font of mine that was orignally created with FontStudio\r\nand therefore and for
  it was intended to be so it is very thin and somehow fragile. As I said\r\nit is
  wanted to be so. But lately I feel the need to prepare it for using it in textsizes
  and I like\r\nto know wether there is a really good automatic way to give it more
  weight better than making\r\nit simply bolder because I always felt that this makes
  the letters somehow clumsy, they loose\r\ntheir original subtility that comes from
  the slight pen details, contrasts of lines etc.\r\nIs their a way to make it automatically
  bolder yet keeping the atmosphere of the pen stroke\r\nin it? Some good values or
  so (your experiences) for a filter or other ticks?\r\nWhat is with Multiple Master?
  I am ashamed to really not knowing very much about it. Can it help in\r\na case
  like that? Bezier curves in my font are quite rational i.e. maximum point are horizontal,\r\nvertical
  etc.\r\n\r\nCan anybody give me good advice?\r\n\r\nThanks guys\r\nStefan\r\n\r\nthis
  is the baby\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Bild-1_5515.gif]"

    view on screen, don't you?\r\nYou should only judge them when printed in a small
    sizes. You will notice that it usually helps to have a bolder stroke and less
    contrast. So making the text sizes bolder is a good start. You may try differnt
    settings for X and Y and you will need make adjustments, because you will loose
    some details like ink traps.\r\n\r\nRalf\r\n\r\nP.S. Schau mal auf http://www.typografie.info/typowiki/index.php?title=Optische_Gr%C3%B6%C3%9Fen"

  body: "Danke Ralph!\r\n\r\nOf course you are right with the principles, yet I know
    that there are some guys here that have made lots of experiences with using different
    values in the offered tools for example in FontLab. You can use a lot of tricks
    I believe. Maybe someone can give me some instructions how to do it in the best
    possible way. I loved the idea to make no further adjustments. So I would be able
    to work on with the thin version and make them when I want into textsize. Like
    a reference model. But maybe I am asking the impossible. Usually one has to do
    so much adjustments that it is like designing it all over again..\r\n\r\nThank
    you nevertheless\r\nStefan"

  body: "I'm actually trying to do just about the exact opposite thing, Stefan: taking
    my very heavy bold sans font [[http://typophile.com/node/34899|Gohan]] to lighten
    it into a text weight. I'm also updating the base design, but even the original,
    in spite of its flaws and chunkiness, holds up quite well printed at small sizes
    already.\r\n\r\nBut enough about me.~ What were those pricniples I was told about
    text fonts? Large x-height, short descenders, reduced contrast (all relative to
    a display font of the same weight). I'm probably mangling my vocabulary. Anyway,
    I wonder what Hrant will say come August!"

  body: "Stefan,\r\n\r\nSimply: Print several samples of text at several small sizes,
    such as 6, 8, 9, 10, 12 point. Then, look at them. Go for a bike ride, play soccer,
    sleep, wake up and return to the samples, and again, look at them. See them not
    as the designer but as a disinterested reader. Can you read them? Compare those
    samples with a variety of books and magazines. What is easiest to read, what is
    difficult? Once you have seen the effect of your type at small sizes, you will
    know what to do. \r\n\r\nGeneral rules: light typefaces, and typefaces set at
    very small point sizes are not comfortable to read. The smaller you set the type,
    the stronger the forms should be. \r\n\r\nIf you want to use automatic tools,
    FontLab lets you add different amounts of weight to verticals and horizontals
    at the same time. For example, you can add 50 units to the main stems and only
    20 units to the horizontals. This does not give finished results, but it can be
    useful. "

    I am quite unexperienced when it comes to internet forums. So this is the only
    way I know. By the way how can one find fast the discussions in which he is envolved
    instead of stepping through the pages and searching.. are there easier ways? What
    does this \u201Emy blog\u201C mean and for what it is intended?\r\n\r\nStefan\r\nHope
    you had nice holidays\r\nMines where way to fine so coming back is double hard.
    Don\u2019t know how I will stand my work as graphic designer in publicity agencies.
    I am tired. :-("
