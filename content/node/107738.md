  a book. I've found something similar with Eulalie. But it lacks the softness of
  the original. Eulalie feels more perfect and harsh on the serifs.\r\nhttp://www.myfonts.com/fonts/nicksfonts/eulalie-nf/regular/"

  body: "It seems that this is based on lettering by Walter A. Heberling in his 1922
    book _Basic Lettering_.\r\nLets try and sort it out.\r\nNick Curtis says that
    Eulalie (2009) is based on the work of master penman Walter Heberling. The similar
    font ITC Photoplay (2001) is also by Nick Curtis. According to \r\nhttp://home.kpn.nl/savoogt1963/FontSources.htm\r\nEulalie
    is a Walter A. Heberling design in _Basic Lettering (1922)_, and ITC Photoplay
    is a Samuel Welo design in _Studio Handbook (1927)_.\r\nBased on Nick's other
    fonts I suggest that he made the design more regular for his version of Heberling.\r\nA
    for Hendershot, this seems to be an auto scan by Rev. Josh Wilhelm of a variation
    of the lettering used in your book. The variation is not surprising, given that
    the original was in a \"how to\" book for lettering.\r\nIf the objective is to
    reproduce this lettering you could:\r\n* use EulalieNF, at the sacrifice of the
    very casual nature of the lettering;\r\n* contact the author of Hendershot at
    http://lifewithouttaffy.com/\r\n* check for other digital or photo type versions
    of the Heberling lettering;\r\n* Purchase or borrow a copy of _Basic Lettering_
    and make your own font. Book info Publisher: Wallbrunn, Kling & Co., Chicago,
    1922. Illustrator: Heberling, W.A. \r\nDon\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Thanks again Don! A wealth of knowledge you are.\r\n\r\nI think my best bet
    is to go with Photoplay as it is for a commercial project so everything would
    be legal and proper. Hendershot is nice but I would need to remove those pesky
    dots and I don't see any rights info.\r\n"

  body: "You're welcome Nicolas.\r\nI agree that most readers would not demand an
    exact match. Even though the fonts are based by lettering by two different artists,
    Heberling and Welo, their work has a similar circa 1920 flavor and your book should
    have a good period feel.\r\nDon"
