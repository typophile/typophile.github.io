  when I click generate glyph from the anchors preview window it is only generating
  for instance the a glyph and not the full agrave with the diacritcal mark. My anchors
  are named correctly and everything is perfectly fine within the anchors preview
  window...Never had this happen so Im kinda of confused. Tried generating the glyphs
  a few other ways same solution(or lack there of really.)\r\n\r\nAny ideas?\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nDavid"

  body: What do the components look like? In my experience, it generally grabs the
    spacing glyph. Are your combining marks the outlines, and the spacing marks composed
    from them? I don't think components nest.

  body: "Here is a shot of everything lining up in the anchors preview window and
    another shot of what happens after I generate the glyph from the same window.
    As you can see the diacritical mark is missing completely...\r\nI have included
    an image of the anchor on the 'a' glyph the marks have a corresponding anchor
    of _top so things should match after generation as they do in the preview window,
    but alas no...I have never had this happen and now it is. Frustrating...\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Screen
