  \u2013 4th grade).\r\nColors, type, type treatment etc\u2019 will be taken care
  of later.\r\nI\u2019d appreciate your thoughts about the general idea before I proceed
  with it.\r\n\r\nThanks\r\nLC\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/MCH_5617.jpg]"

    the big gap between the the 2 kids is bothersome. The font used for \"Children
    House\" seem out of place. Hope that helps.\r\n\r\nJake"

    you with both arms outspread.\r\n\r\nAlso, should it say \"children's house\"
    instead?"

    to keep the negative space of the house.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nLC\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/MCH3_5037.jpg]"

  body: "isn't the montessori method all about adaptation and interaction and environment?\r\n\r\nwhy
    would a school that focuses on this method require a structured and repeated 'mark'
    I think it would be more suitable and unique to have an adaptive mark (i.e, a
    series of images supplied by the students, or are representative of the ideals
    of Montessori)\r\n\r\nor if that proves too absract a single mark ABOUT the kids.
    get the students to draw symbols (not illustrations) of learning, of what they
    do - and use them. or .. get them to draw their world outside the house shape.\r\n\r\nseriously
    ... it's such an amazing opportunity to explore some abstraction and difference
    and without wanting to sound totally negative - what you present leaves a lot
    to be desired in my opinion.\r\n\r\nschools are about education, fun and interaction.
    create a logo that communicates and (perhaps on another level) educates whoever
    interacts with.\r\n\r\nin short ... make it flexible like the schooling method.\r\n\r\nand
    who do I send an invoice to?\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n----------\r\n<strong>Paul
