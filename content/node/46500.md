  body: As a logo, it's most likely custom lettering, but you can fake it with <a
    href="http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/singles/linotype/optima_std_roman/?sample_text=OLAY&sample_size=96">Optima</a>
    or <a href="http://www.fontshop.com/fonts/singles/wiescher/ela_sans_light/?sample_text=OLAY&sample_size=96">Ela
    Sans</a>.
