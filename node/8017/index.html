  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody">Lesson One <BR> <BR>A famous calligrapher was sitting on a tree <BR>resting, doing nothing.  A small type designer <BR>saw the man of letters and asked him, &quot;Can I <BR>also sit like you and do nothing ?&quot;  <BR>The calligrapher answered : &quot;Sure, why not ?&quot; <BR>So, the type designer sat on the ground below <BR>the calligrapher and rested. All of a sudden, <BR>a foundry appeared, hired the type designer <BR>and took advantage on him. <BR> <BR>Management Lesson : <BR> <BR>To be sitting and doing nothing, you must be  <BR>sitting very, very high up. <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR>Lesson Two <BR> <BR>A sad type designer saw a bull and started to <BR>tell him his thoughts.  &quot;Oh, bull, I would love <BR>to be able to get to the top of the font design <BR>tree,&quot; sighed the sad type designer, &quot;but I have <BR>not got the energy.&quot;  Suddenly the bull voiced : <BR> <BR>&quot;Well, why don't you nibble on some of my  <BR>droppings ?&quot; replied the bull. &quot;They're packed  <BR>with nutrients.&quot; <BR> <BR>The sad type designer pecked at a lump of dung, <BR>and found it actually gave him enough strength <BR>to reach the lowest branch of the font tree. <BR>The next day, after eating some more dung, he <BR>reached the second branch facing a slab typeface. <BR>Finally after a fourth night spent in front of <BR>FontLab, the type designer was proudly perched <BR>at the top of the font tree with an OpenType in <BR>his hands. <BR>He was promptly spotted by a craftsman, who shot  <BR>him out of the tree. <BR> <BR>Management Lesson : <BR> <BR>Bullshit might get you to the top, but it won't  <BR>keep you there. <BR> <BR> <BR> <BR>Lesson Three <BR> <BR>A little Finnish type designer girl was flying <BR>south for the winter.  Getting to the airport, <BR>it was so cold that the girl froze and fell to <BR>the ground into a large field in the middle of <BR>a forest.  While she was lying there, a reindeer <BR>came by and dropped some dung on her. <BR>As the frozen girl lay there in the pile of dung, <BR>she began to realize how warm she was.  The dung <BR>was actually thawing her out!  She lay there all <BR>warm and happy, and soon began to sing for joy, <BR>&quot;the ABCs of love&hellip;&quot; (<a href="http://tinyurl.com/4f84f" target="_blank"><a href="http://tinyurl.com/4f84f">http://tinyurl.com/4f84f</a></a>). <BR>A passing Art Director man heard the girl singing <BR>and came to investigate. <BR>Following the sound, the AD discovered the girl <BR>under the pile of reindeer dung, and promptly dug <BR>her out and took advantage on her. <BR> <BR>Management Lesson : <BR> <BR>1. Not everyone who shits on you is your enemy. <BR>2. Not everyone who gets you out of  is your <BR>   friend. <BR>3. And when you are in deep , it is best to  <BR>   keep your mouth shut !</div>
