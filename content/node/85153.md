body: "Hello,\r\nI am looking to purchase a full-family version of the font ITC Busorama,
  including the alternate characters. \r\nITC sells all three weights of the family,
  but apparently without any of the alternates.\r\nI've found some pirated/free versions
  that do include at least some of the alternates.\r\n\r\nMy questions (for anyone
  who cares or has any info):\r\n\r\n1. Do you know of a legal source I can get the
  Busorama family including the alternates?\r\n2. Why, oh why, would a font foundry,
  in this case ITC, go to the trouble to digitize an older typeface and leave out
  some of the characters? This seems to reflect a lack of regard for their own products,
  and certainly for their customers. \r\n3. In your opinion, is it unethical to download
  pirated versions of the font if that's the only place I can get the alternate characters?\r\n\r\nThanks
  for any info or thoughts you have on this.\r\n\r\n"

    exists. Whether or not House has digitized this particular one is not certain,
    however.\r\n\r\n2. ITC probably digitized the typeface before the advent of OpenType,
    so the available character set within a single font was limited; even so, yeah\u2014it's
    kinda dumb not to include at least some alternates in the lowercase slots.\r\n\r\n3.
    No. Buy the legit product and create your own alternates in Illustrator or CorelDraw
    or whatever."
