    permanently made the switch to Mac.\r\n\r\nBut, then, I thought, the speed and
    ease of use with the Mac OS comes mainly from the fact that it's (a) well designed,
    (b) written for a narrow range of hardware, and, since OS X, (c) on a Unix base.
    So, as long as they keep all three of these characteristics, and provide some
    means for helping legacy users make the switch--this will be the real toughie--what
    does it matter what hardware Apple uses? The processor and the motherboard were
    the last proprietary hardware holdouts, anyway. (I bracket for the time being
    the issue of diversity in processor manufacturing; I doubt that Apple will be
    interested in making sure that its builds of future OSs will run as well on AMD
    chipsets as on Intel ones.) And the case design won't revert to beige and black
    boxes.\r\n\r\nI found a (non-techie) post on a blog on my regular rounds (Crooked
    Timber) that puts this announcement in perspective pretty well, I think: http://crookedtimber.org/2005/06/06/apple-switches/.
    This should be the permanent link; apologies if I screwed it up. (the Internets

    So now I am embarassed about my post above, and your original entry, Joe, makes
    more sense to me.\r\n\r\nThe only thing changing is the chip, from motorola to
    intel, and nothing else. Right? So really none of us will have to even joke about
    \"switching\". I was told intel chips run cooler and faster, among other things,
    so it really is a good switch. Am I still confusing the information?"

    is marketing, and a desire for more sales: Intel has a much stronger reputation
    among laymen than Motorola/IBM, so Apple can start advertising \"Intel Inside\"
    hogwash, and sell more crap to less sophisticated people.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

  body: "Disclaimer: I actually know something about CPU architecture.\r\n\r\nFor
    90% of Mac users, it won't make much difference whether the CPU is PPC or Intel.
    What distinguishes the Mac is the operating system. OSX will still be robust,
    offer a nice user experience, and not collect spyware and viruses like Windows.\r\n\r\nNew
    versions of actively maintained software will just have to be recompiled; you
    won't see much difference. Older, legacy software will run in an emulation layer;
    if all goes well, it'll just be slower. Of course, there will be times when all
    does not go well.\r\n\r\nPeople debate the relative merits of the PPC and Intel
    architecture until they're blue in the face, but there's not that much practical
    difference. In areas where one had the edge (the G4 with its Altivec instruction
    set), the other caught up (SSE2 is as good; I know, as I've ported my vector-optimized
    inkjet halftoning code to both architectures). What does matter is the multibillion
    dollar investment Intel is putting into making a variety of chips across their
    product line, including cool-running laptops (Pentium M) and powerful server chips.
    It also helps that Intel has AMD nipping at their heels and keeping them honest.
    Apple was held hostage by PPC chip manufacturers (Motorola with the G4, IBM with
    the PPC970 = G5) who didn't really need Apple's business and weren't willing to
    invest enough. In the case of the G4, the clock speed is stuck at a small fraction
    of what's available in the rest of the world, and in the case of the PPC970, IBM
    wasn't willing to do the engineering to make a low-power, laptop friendly version
    of the chip.\r\n\r\nFarther down the road, it's hard to say what the implications
    will be. Apple plans to only ship OS X on their branded hardware, but in reality
    their gear won't be any different than a beige box. Indeed, the Darwin kernel
    at the heart of OS X already runs on commodity Intel gear. Count on hackers to
    port the rest of the OS X runtime. I can't say now whether this will remain a
    curiosity, or will cross over to being a mainstream alternative, just as all serious
    gamers now mod-chip their X-boxes.\r\n\r\nOverall, while this move signals the
    end of the era where aesthetics of computer architecture counted one whit, compared
    with the inexorable power of money, I see it as a good thing. Since Apple will
    be selling the exact same hardware as Dell, they will be forced to become price-competitive.
    Meanwhile, Mac users will actually get laptops with decent raw compute power,
    which otherwise would never have happened. There will probably be some adjustment
    pains, but when that's over, I bet Apple will pick up another point or two of
    market share, which is absolutely necessary if for no other reason than to keep
    Microsoft honest.\r\n\r\n(oh, and not to flame-war, but current Intel chips are
    definitely not laughable. A 3.6GHz Pentium 4 delivers about 1700 base CINT2000
    Specmarks, compared to about 986 for a 2.2GHz PPC970; it's hard to get real benchmark
    data for the PPC architecture because Apple doesn't seem to participate in the
    official Spec benchmark process; even the 2GHz Pentium M clocks in at a very respectable
    1528. In the arena of raw processing power, Intel beats PPC hollow in price/performance,
    and that gap is likely to widen).\r\n"

    This is true of the chip only, but won't be true of any other hardware. Apple's
    industrial designers are some of the most lauded in their field. I will still
    expect to pay more for Apple's brand.\r\n\r\nRaph also wrote:\r\n<em>Meanwhile,
    Mac users will actually get laptops with decent raw compute power, which otherwise
    would never have happened.</em>\r\n\r\nThat's what I'm looking forward to.\r\n\r\nSome
    are speculating that Apple will solely focus on the operating system and get out
    of selling boxes. I don't think that's true. Jobs killed the cloning business
    because the Mac clones were suffocating Apple profits (this was a move to not
    only stay in the hardware business, but keep it exclusive to Apple). Then again,
    that was 1997 or something.\r\n\r\nOthers are speculating (and this is where I
    think it gets interesting) that Apple  wants an Intel chip because, unlike IBM,
    Motorola or AMD, Intel is supposedly close to a chip that will handle digital
    rights management (DRM). Doing so would put Apple in position to continue to dominate
    media on the desktop in the age of DRM.\r\n\r\nIn the end, what I like about Apple
    hardware is that I can buy one and bring it home and never have to crack it open
    (if I don't want to). What plagues Windows is having to be compatible with every
    device manufacturer. It's Windows' strength and it's main weakness - being that
    open leaves room for incompatibilities, security holes and viruses."
