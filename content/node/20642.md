  have always wanted to design a typeface. My first effort is for my company Distil
  hence Distil Sans. So far I've only done the light version and the lowercase letters
  using a combination of Iluustrator CS2 and Fontlab Studio 4.6. The other weights
  are mocked up using a stroke in illustrator but are close to  what I would like
  the finished weights to be.\r\n\r\nI'd be grateful for any feedback at this point\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/distil_5895.gif]"

    body: "cheers, I know what you mean about the darker corners but i wanted it to
      stand out slightly but have a modern feel like Neo Sans or Neo Tech. \r\n\r\nJust
      finishing the other letterforms and adding some more weights, then I'll get
      the holding page changed. Cheers for the reminder. Then move on to designing
      the site itself! "

  body: "I'm not a type designer, but rather a typographer/graphic\r\ndesigner, but
    I will try and help you out.\r\n\r\nI'm not too sure about the dark areas either.
    Although I think \r\nit does work in certain letters such as 'u' 'q' 'y' and 'g'.
    For me \r\nit definately doesn't work in 'm' 'k' 'e' 'a' 'r' and 'h'. Try and
    \r\nthink where such clotting might occur more naturally within \r\nthe letters,
    as it does seem over forced.\r\n\r\nI don't like the shape of the 'w', 'x' or
    'k'.  Perhaps look at more \r\nconventional shapes. It seems like you're trying
    too hard to \r\nmake it stand out and seem original, probably because it's your
    \r\nfirst design. Don't be scared of really nice, but simple letters. I \r\nthink
    that a lot of peoples first type designs are quite gimmicky. \r\n\r\nThe bar on
    the 't' and 'f' needs to be stronger I feel. \r\n\r\nThe 'z' looks like it's leaning
    to the right. Perhaps extend he \r\nbaseline stroke to the right a little to balance
    it out more. \r\n\r\nThe 's' looks upside down. \r\n\r\nThe 'a' doesn't look right.
    Perhaps avoid the completely flat base. \r\nThe bowl also seems a little small
    and squashed vertically.\r\n\r\nThe 'e' looks a little awkward to me. Try extending
    the bottom \r\nstroke and making that left side more curved. \r\n\r\nA good start
    though, and good luck!\r\n\r\n\r\nPhil\r\n"

    on many points.\r\n\r\nOne more thing though:\r\nThe arm on the 'r' is way too
    long, it looks too much like a cropped 'n'. \r\n\r\nGood luck with the font\r\n\r\nMagnus"

  body: "RE: cropped \u2018n\u2019\r\n\r\nTotally. \r\n\r\nI would loose those dark
    spots. They mess with the flow of the face & I don't think they are fun enough
    as is to keep.\r\n\r\nThink about that e again. It should feel more different
    from your a - maybe grab a curce from the upper left side of your o.\r\n\r\nFor
    this face to look even it can't be litterally even. There are illusions at work.
    The problem becomes more & more obvious as the weight gets heavier. See it? If
    you do some searching on the web you will find references as to the why & how
    of this.\r\n"

    Is this type only for display or will it be also used for text sizes? Text faces
    are much less forgiving.\r\n\r\nChrisL"

    about biting them from the opposite side? The bites might be interesting if they
    were done well.\r\n\r\n"

    strange "e" in both and "a" in regular version only.

    feedback! I agree about the r and need to tweak the a and e. I'm working on the
    other weights and discovering themes and shapes which I may work back into the
    lighter weight. I hope you understand what I mean. The face is still work in progress.\r\n\r\nI
    was going to buy the book Designing Type by, I think its Carol Chan? Are there
    any other good books or websites which can help me with the basics?\r\n\r\nJerome\r\n"

    too.
