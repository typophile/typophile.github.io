body: "I just came across the results of the 4th Founder Award Competition in Chinese
  type design, which can be seen <a href=\"http://www.foundertype.com.cn/ztds_4_zpzs.htm\">here
  (in Chinese)</a>. There are also critiques in English by Akira Kobayashi on some
  of the entries.\r\n\r\nThere are lots of good entries, but one that caught my eye
  was this an effort by Wang Tianjia (\u738B\u5929\u7532), titled \"Chinese Characters
  Squared (\u6C49\u5B57\u7684\u5E73\u65B9)\". Or at least that's what I think it means;
  I don't speak Chinese, so I'm relying on my knowledge of Chinese characters and
  a dictionary.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/4zpzs_yxj_13_3731.jpg]\r\n\r\nAt
  first glance, it seems pretty normal, having a somewhat complicated look, like a
  text set in traditional Chinese. But for those who can read Chinese, what's amazing
  about this is that it is in fact simplified Chinese, but many of the elements of
  the glyphs have been multiplied--two strokes where there should be one, three where
  there should be two. Wang has created something like the effects of double vision,
  but disguised in a way that still looks sensibly like regular Chinese characters.
  It's something like unsimplified Chinese. Quite imaginative.\r\n\r\nFor comparison,
  here is another entry for the competition showing how the same exact characters
  <em>should</em> look.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/4zpzs_11_4516.jpg]"

  body: "Indeed very amazing!\r\n\r\nNot being trainedin Chinese, I wonder whether
    the letters, especially whole texts are immediately readable by a native reader
    of simplified Chinese, or would readability suffer, be reduced to \"being able
    to spell it out\" instead of reading it fluently.\r\nSo would that qualify as
    a decorative font only, or also as text-font?\r\n\r\nSzabolcs"

  body: "Definitely a decorative font.\r\n\r\nBut it's surprisingly readable. At least,
    I don't think a native Chinese reader would have any trouble reading passages
    like this, any more than a native English reader would have any trouble reading
    something set in the more experimental but successful display faces. (It would
    really have to be a passage of more than just a couple of characters so that the
    concept of the design is apparent, since just a couple of characters in isolation
    would just puzzle the native Chinese reader.)\r\n\r\nBeing Korean, I myself don't
    read Chinese, but I'm familiar enough with the characters to recognize most and
    even to read a few. It would be nice to get an opinion from a native Chinese reader,
    though."

    letters are not so good\u2026), many years ago I did a Latin typeface with a similar
    treatment. It's called \"Inexpressed\":\r\nhttp://www.identifont.com/show?1B1\r\nWang
    Tianjia's effort looks very good!"

    seeing afterimages of a violent shock, but it's settled that way permanently.
