body: Does anybody know of a good type design forum where someone can post their work
  for critique, or bring up some new and interesting type deign ideas and actually
  get a few meaningful responses?  I thought this might be the place. Perhaps it was
  years ago.  Now however this place seems to be made up of mostly old grumpy people
  who are stuck in their ways and look down their noses at anything new or radical.
  But hey, I guess it's a good place to discuss Retina displays and politics.

  body: Typedrawers.com is growing. It was created to provide an alternative to Typophile.
    Typeboard sources server hosting from a vendor known for reliability rather than
    using home baked solutions. And problem Typophile members have been blocked from
    creating accounts at Typedrawers.com.

    where only the loudest, most persistent, and most obnoxious voices come through.
    \r\n\r\nBest advice I can think of: start going to conferences and workshops and
    meet people who's work an opinions you respect. If you want people with good opinions
    to help you, you will need to proactively build a relationship."

    type conferences existed if it wasn\u2019t for Typophile."

    than just give a positive response, then yes, there are a few of those. But if
    you can't stand the heat stay out of the kitchen. Not everybody is going to fawn
    over your new and interesting ideas, especially those with many years of trial
    and error in type design, ie. <em>experience.</em>\r\n"

    bit in the threads you start; put a bit of info about what you're after in the
    critique (the one I saw http://typophile.com/node/94050, you just posted a jpg
    and nothing else - how are other deigners supposed to know if this is your work
    up for critique, an example of something you've seen, your kid's doodlings in
    MS Paint...); and lastly, maybe try coming across as less of a dick (http://typophile.com/node/93883).
    You're welcome.

    (with lots of time and experience behind them) may look at your \"new and radical\"
    with tempered eyes and see it as naive and flawed. There are some interesting
    qualities in some of the individual letters but there are also some \"mishaps\"
    in your forms. I would look to some other ancient forms to resolve some of the
    forms. I thought of three instantly when I was looking at your work. \"Forms can
    be adapted across time.\"\r\n\r\nI have found, when you challenge on this forum,
    members tend to take up the shield and sword. So approach it with dignity and
    humility instead of throwing a \"hot bowl of soup\" in their face.\r\n\r\nMichael\r\n"

    a lot of you don't give a shit. Why should you? It's not like I'm some famous

    has its flaws, and its ups & down, just like anything else. And it's no substitute
    for going to conferences. And certainly no substitute for quiet observation and
    deep introspection. But it's still a very good place (and by far the best online
    place) to do what you're trying to do, and in my experience a superb place to
    start and build relationships. Not everybody can handle everything about it, and
    you should try to change it into something you prefer, but most of all just see
    how you can grow with it.\r\n\r\nhhp\r\n"

    I started that thread because I had some legit questions re the impact of technology
    on type design and anticipated adjustments by foundries. The thread changed organically,
    eventually becoming a different discussion all together. Which was beautiful,
    I think.\r\n\r\nAnd Ryan, I thought your attempt to be humorous was very funny.

    There were no condoms then either--not that it mattered, we were not allowed to
