		<div class="commentbody">Thank you. Glad you like Manticore; I don't anymore, but that's true of most of my typefaces from before 1998. I'm probably going to retire them fairly soon, in large part because we don't want to support Type 1 fonts any longer but don't have time or much inclination to make OpenType versions of all our retail fonts. So that copy of Manticore may shortly be a rare item.  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Note that I only designed the digital version of Aeneas: it is based on lettering by the German calligrapher Werner Schneider.

		<div class="commentbody">Jon, you could also pick up Ruari McLean's autobiography, which is the only other publication I've ever seen set in Manticore. I was rather chuffed last year, though, to see Manticore Titling used on the dustjacket of a book by one of my favourite poets, Czeslaw Milosz. The biggest problem I find with the face, apart from some technical problems in the outlines and the hideously small counter of the lowercase &lt;I&gt;e&lt;/I&gt;, is the excessive weight in the bracketing of the serifs: I was going for the rugged blackness that you see in early printed books, but now I think I overdid it a bit. Ironically, while this feature was too heavy, I now think the overall stem weight was a touch too light.  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->  <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Back in 1997 (probably the last time I had any free time for such things) I started redrawing Manticore, but didn't get very far with it. Here are the original forms, on the left, contrasted with the revised forms on the right. Seriously, I doubt if I'll ever finish this. Perhaps it will be a nice project for my retirement.  <!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></div>

And on Type1: the 256 character limit applied even to Truetype. The large layout came with Truetype GX and now Opentype/Unicode. It's not such a recent and so widespread thing. I understand that for you, producing non-Latin and cutting-edge works in terms of technology also, Type1 may sould so old, but a huge amount of users and foundries will continue to use it. Personally I like the fact of having separate files for bitmaps, outlines and metric files. As I like having all in one with Opentype. I never liked so much Truetype for the additional points needed. I know they are way better for hinting, but not being into hinting (for now at least) I was pissed off when I needed to modify an existing truetype with the excess of points. Here, of course I'm speaking just for Mac. It's clear that if you need multi-platform faces you are forced to truetype. But it's amazing there are so many people using PC Type1 fonts. As far as I know Type1 was never a real standard under Windows.I also understand the &quot;potential customer service nightmare Type1 might present as operating systems and applications stop supporting the format, but why Type 1 represents a &quot;document encoding nightmare waiting to happen&quot;? Surely I'm missing a lot here. ]</div>

Thank you! And, yes, I guessed you were referring to the very smart ligature and contextual alternates handling of Unicode/Opentype when you talked about the problems arising in the continued use of Type1. Anyway, this is a real problem as long as you're a custom typeface developer such as you with Tiro. If I buy a face from Emigre or ITC today, let's say, and it's a Type1, it will be my problem to buy Emigre and ITC Opentype versions of it as long as they will be released, paying for the upgrade. So, as long as we have only MrsEaves at Emigre and, I think, none at ITC, you are simply forced to stick to Type1. If the foundry decides it will drop a face and not upgrade it to Opentype I will necessary have to buy it in Type1. So I agree with you about the need to help things occur, but unfortunately you are unable to predict what foundries will do, and if you need a particular face now, you need to buy it in Type1 and maybe re-encode it in Opentype, if you are able to do so.]</div>
