<div class="post-content e-content" itemprop=articleBody>This isn't truly typography-related, but i figure there might be people here interested in this sort of thing anyway.. I just wanted to mention that i was recently able to get ahold of the reprinted and seemingly not-so-easy-to-get-ahold-of <a href="http://youworkforthem.com/product.php?sku=P0125">Saul Bass and Associates book</a> (originally from 1979). i found it online at a specialized bookstore in Holland called <a href=http://www.nijhoflee.nl/bookstore/>Nijhof & Lee</a> and it costs for €36 + shipping, which wasn't too bad. it's certainly no definitive book on all things Saul Bass, but given the slim-to-none existence of Saul Bass books in general, it's worth having if you're a fan like myself.
(the first link has some samples from the book)</div>

<div class=commentbody>yup, that's a good one, though i wish they'd have them in video. sadly it's one of the few Saul Bass websites around.. a shame that the saulbass.net site just disappeared.
went to the Saul Bass exhibit in London in 2004, which was completely awesome. not only did it have all the goodies, but they had sketches, private letters and such.. i wish i'd taken a camera.</div>

Ajinomoto, a Japanese food company. they sadly no longer use that logo, it appears. a shame, since it's just such a beautiful logo.</div>

<div class=commentbody>Just placed the order. Thanks for the link! There should be a DVD of all his title sequences. Now all I need is an exhaustive book on Ronald Clyne and my cypher will be complete.</div>

yeah, "Bass on Titles". though it only contains 10 title sequences, not all of them. it's pretty hard to find (i haven't had any luck yet), but i do know it's available on a shorts compilation in North America called <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000055WG3/ref=sr_11_1/102-9167898-1822537?%5Fencoding=UTF8&v=glance&n=130">"Short 11: Ecstasy"</a>. no idea of the quality on that one though (the stand-alone release in the UK is supposed to have been digitally remastered).</div>

<div class=commentbody>Just want to say I just received this in the mail from Nijhof & Lee.  Excellent book, and for all you folks stateside that are alarmed by the shipping rates, I chose economy (that said 4-6 weeks) and it arrived in 7 days.
Also to reply on my own comment about a Ronald Clyne book--the man just passed 3 weeks ago. r.i.p.</div>

<div class=commentbody>The Bass on Titles DVD is available on Amazon in the UK and you can rent it as well as buy.
http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/B0006OR0XU/qid=1149268537/sr=8-1/ref=sr_8_xs_ap_i1_xgl/203-5278134-7216740
I think the reviewer on Amazon it sums it up in terms of price/duration/quality/aspect ratio issues (prepare for a lot of fiddling with the zoom button); I'm pretty sure it wasn't remastered. I'd just come back from the Design Museum show and didn't notice the production date on the DVD so mistakenly assumed it was the same comprehensive showreel I'd just seen there, so was rather disapointed! Luckily I'd only hired it.
