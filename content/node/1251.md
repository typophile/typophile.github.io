  and print your fonts, for Postscripts you obviously have Adobe&#39;s Type Manager
  Lite, but with that one you can only view one at a time, and basically it is far
  from convenient to use. So without forking out the big cash, I am looking for a
  handy shareware/demo little tool to do this, preferably downloadable. '
