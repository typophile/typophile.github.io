body: "Hello all,\r\n\r\nI hope this is in the right section. I have a legal issue.
  I designed three letters in the creation of a logo for a video production company.
  Yesterday I received by email a contract to sign were I state that the work is mine
  and I used nobody else\u2019s font. Fine until here. Then I reread the contract
  and note it\u2019s mostly about the typeface, so I asked a colleague of mine who
  is a polygraph to research the letters and see if it\u2019s no other logo already
  and we found one :( \r\nIt\u2019s a free font that can\u2019t be used commercially.
  The problem is not really there, it\u2019s that the creator could say I ripped his
  work and send me to court. The logo will be very mediatised. (If we could refrain
  from saying the mark in this thread it would be cool, not really wanting a Google
  search to turn up this thread)\r\nPerhaps it\u2019s the contract that worries me
  here, lines like: I certify that this logo is my original design and not a copy
  of an existing logo or font or typeface.\r\nI\u2019m not sure to sign, as in a way
  I do feel it is a copy or variant of Levi Halmos' work.\r\n\r\nI will put his three
  characters next to mine to show you the comparison. Edit: This isn\u2019t a good
  example as I think there is a lighter version.\r\nI also added the construction
  which is mathematically very simple, anyone could do it and that is also worrying.\r\n\r\nI
  have no idea what to do now. Perhaps refuse the contract.\r\nYour help would really
  be appreciated.\r\n\r\n\r\nThanks.\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\nDavid Pache\r\n"

  body: "Well, you're in a bind. Honestly, the road that I would suggest here is,
    well, honesty. Don't ever sign a contract that might ever get you into trouble,
    ever. Contracts are made for lawyers and judges. If your client gets mad, there
    is a good chance you'll meet them both. And lawyers and judges will only look
    at the letter of the law, so to speak. If your client spends real money putting
    this logo into the media, and then thinks that you violated the contract, then
    you could be liable for severe damage fees.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, playing
    the Devil's advocate, I doubt that anyone in the legal system cares much about
    the way three letters look. Do your letters look different from any others? What
    happens when you overlay them with the original? Is it an exact match? If not,
    you must have done <em>something</em> to them\u2026\r\n\r\nAlas, this is a matter
    which could be litigated back and forth. I wouldn't want uncertainty for that
    long. If I were you, I would hire a real lawyer (at least briefly), who is an
    expert on copyright and intellectual property law. That lawyer could do a real
    search for you, and give you a more definitive answer. If you got the go ahead
    from them, then\u2014by all means\u2014make sure that your client copyrights and
    registers their logo as a trademark. Copyright Registration and Trademarking are
    very important elements of the law, and sometimes all that can save an image.\r\n\r\nAs
    one of the moderators here, I really need to stress that this kind of question
    is sort of inappropriate for Typophile. I don't mean that it is a bad question\u2014in
    fact, it is a very good question\u2014but this is not a legal forum. Lawyers do
    not post and read here. Here you will get the advice and opinions of other designers.
    These may console or distress you, but they won't really help you solve the legal
    questions raised\u2026 sorry."

    but there are more than one font out there made in the same style.\r\n\r\nIf it
    was me, and I drew from scratch a set of characters that were similar to another,
    well, too bad, no legal problems. The style shown is one that is very easy to
    duplicate, even by accident, and this similarity of design is very common.\r\n+"

  body: "\"Well, you\u2019re in a bind. \" \r\nActually Not, my good moderator...
    The world's legal systems have made it almost impossible to COPYRIGHT the DESIGN
    of a typeface. This was done to, among other things, make it so when people like
    you steal forms, users, like large corporations, don't get raked over the coals
    for it. In the eyes of the law, you are in the same position now, as if you had
    bought the font (hinthint). You've used the letters of a font in someone's logo
    and that is just plain legal."

  body: "<em>You\u2019ve used the letters of a font in someone\u2019s logo and that
    is just plain legal.</em>\r\n\r\nI don't think that it is legal if the client
    and their contract expect the designer to have drawn the letters himself.\r\n\r\nDavid
    (Berlow), my concern is exactly the contract. If the designer signs a contract
    that says, in effect, \"I swear that all of this work is entirely mine, not influenced
    by any other,\" he <em>will</em> be in a bind if the client decides to think otherwise
    down the line. What is to prevent the client from him them if they feel like it?
    Even if he has the \"legal\" high ground here, the designer might not be able
    to match wits with the client's legal fees, and could thereby lose the case and
    be liable for whatever damages the client might seek.\r\n\r\nDavid (Pache) seems
    to be working in Switzerland. I'm not a lawyer, I don't live in Switzerland, and
    I don't know a thing about Swiss law. But this seems to me to be a question of
    contract law first, and maybe only second about copyright law.\r\n\r\nIt isn't
    my liability at stake, David (Berlow), it's the poster's. What would you do, David
    (Below)? \r\n\r\n\r\nSorry about the whole last-name-in-parentheses thing\u2026
    it seems to be the easiest way to differentiate between David Pache and David
    Berlow :("

    \r\n\r\nDache:\r\n\"I designed three letters in the creation of a logo for a video
    production company. Yesterday I received by email a contract to sign were I state
    that the work is mine and I used nobody else\u2019s font.\"\r\n\r\n...if the first
    sentence is true, and you made or know who and how was made the logo, and can
    positively prove that your letters are used, then: \"I have a legal issue\" is
    false. (period)\r\n\r\nThe company for whom you design the LOGO, should make the
    decision if and how they want to search to make sure no other \"Video Production
    Company\" or a substantially similar business, with the same initials, or name,
    or one substantially similar, that ALSO uses the same font(!), or one substantially
    similar, made a logo, just, , , like, , , this.\r\n\r\nThe existing font, is utterly
    not an issue, assuming that the following: \"to research the letters and see if
    it\u2019s no other logo already and we found one :( It\u2019s a free font that
    can\u2019t be used commercially.\"\r\n\r\n...is confused, as it seems a search
    was done for a logo, and \"free font\" was found...which is hard to understand."
