body: "It may seem this is miscategorised, since i already know the name of the font
  in question--Archive Thermo--but i decided to post this to the Type ID board because
  i'm looking for a 'clean' version of the typeface.  i love what ArchiveType does;
  their dedication to preserving type from vintage ephemera 'as is', however, when
  it comes to uses that demand a more crisp, clean, polished look, or when more precise
  kerning is needed, Thermo can be a bit frustrating.\r\n\r\nThe closest alternative
  i've come across is Kolo Wide, though it doesn't quite do justice to Thermo's more
  subtle curves."
