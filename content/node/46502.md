  University and really want to work in graphic design and illustration.\r\n\r\nI
  have some freelance experience creating new a website for a law firm, creating all
  graphical content (service logo, letterheads, business cards etc) for an NHS Mental
  Health Service. They now want me to develop their web presence and I\u2019ve just
  bagged another client - an indie venue in North London.\r\n\r\nI am also working
  on two personal projects: SCHOOLYARDRULES! An online graphic novel based on three
  characters from Hackney which is due to go live soon. This can be viewed on my online
  portfolio (www.daveyrockstar.co.uk) or through a Facebook Search: ShoolYardRules!\r\n\r\nThe
  other is a Gonk\u2019s Tale, An interactive children\u2019s book about deforestation,
  again, accessible at my online portfolio: www.daveyrockstar.co.uk.\r\n\r\nI\u2019m
  in the process of putting together my CV but am a bit stuck, as apart from the recent
  freealnce work, I don\u2019t have agency experience. I currently work in IT Project
  Management and have done throughout my studies, but now really want to make the
  jump...\r\n\r\nCan anyone help? Offer advice or even a job?\r\n\r\nRegards\r\n\r\nDavid
