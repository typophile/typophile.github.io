body: From what I have read about breaking the rules/ abandoning the grid, Im not
  sure it is completely possible to escape. Discussions of the designer being, well
  you could say, unleashed from the grid to result in a more creative and unconstrained
  piece of design. Though I have noticed, if not a grid then a form of structure/control
  is needed and used , to produce a functional piece of design. So is the grid really
  being broken or just recreated into another form?

    threw the grid out the window to make this font, not that I use the grid when
    designing a straight font anyway. The above font is a functional piece of design
    and I'm not aware of any grid being broken or recreated into another form.\r\n\r\nBesides,
    your last sentence is a logical fallacy. If a grid was recreated into another
    form it wouldn't be a grid any more, would it? It would be something else, and
    you could do something sensible, like call it something other than \"grid\".\r\n\r\nWhy
    people can't just accept most things and leave 'em alone is beyond me. I mean,
    it's only a grid innit? \r\n\r\nLike it matters?\r\n\r\nWho needs a grid? It (the
    font) either looks right, or it doesn't. I've done a small pile of grid-like fonts
    without ever having the grid switched on, so apparently I don't need the grid
    even when I'm supposed to use it.\r\n\r\nj a m e s"

  body: "The grid is very useful for organizing large numbers of elements so that
    the reader can find his or her way easily, but when things aren't so complex,
    it's quite possible to design well without a grid. \r\n\r\nI've designed several
    books that consisted of full bleed photos with small amounts of text on each.
    Each block of text was placed over the photos without regard to any underlying
    grid -- instead the shapes within the individual photos determined the placement
    of the text. \r\n\r\nWhen to use a grid, and when to break out of it, is a judgement
    call that designers must learn to decide for themselves. Experience helps.\r\n\r\n

    then all you are really doing is creating a unique grid per page, your page layout
    will entirely benefit from keeping with consistent grid even if you break out
    of it. By all means come up with new permutations of the grid but I feel to ignore
    it completely is knieve."

  body: "Superficially, check out Ray Gun Magazine and David Carson. They always discussed
    escaping the grid and such in the nineties. \r\n\r\nFor richer study: \r\n\r\nIf
    you start looking at design as visual connections you can create a visual language
    without grids by making paths of direction for the eye. Armin Hofmann was good
    at this. Many Basel designers are good at this even though known for working within
    grids as well. \r\n\r\nJust because you abandon the grid does not mean you are
    in some sort of nirvana within anarchy. Of course, there must be some sort of
    organization. For instance, Rothko and many of his generation would make a painting
    of dark violet and other tones only to shatter it with red. The red provided a
    focal point. So, there are many ways to create order. Creating visual order is
    a different task with perhaps different intentions that a grid is not necessarily
    a solution for.  You should start looking at designs or art or whatever you think
    looks good and ask the question: \"How is it this is working successfully.\" Discover
    different approaches to organization.\r\n\r\nAnother approach I have seen is when
    designs have an object of such shock or allure that your eye is directed to the
    information the designer wanted you to see. Lots of ideas out there. "

    squares of the same size and find the correct ways to organize them on a 1ft square.
    Maybe the squares were about 2.5 inches. By doing this assignment I realized that
    given the context of a situation there are solutions that look optically correct
    and visually pleasing. Even when given freedom to organize them as you may you
    will eventually see this is true. No grid necessary. \r\n\r\nIf you add words
    or content everything changes.\r\n\r\nStep two? Add a quarter inch red dot."
