  body: ' You should have gotten the manual as a PDF. <BR> <BR>BTW, FontLab tech support
    is singularly amazing &#40;especially in this day and age&#41;: if you ask them
    anything, they&#39;ll reply, and quickly. In contrast, I once had to ask Apple
    a question about QTVR &#40;which I had recently purchased&#41;, and they wanted
    to charge me $50 to ask it, with no guarantees that it would be adequately answered.

  body: Hey Joe, I had the same problem with importing Illustrator EPS files.  I&#39;m
    not sure why this is happening!  Any help out there?  Thank you in advance and
    I&#39;m looking forward to being in these forums! <BR> <BR>FYI, you can buy a
    manual for $39.95 at the FontLab site -- look for the manual link -- it&#39;s
    printed and sent to you directly from a third party.

  body: There are two ways to import Illustrator outlines into FontLab. <BR> <BR>1.
    You can copy and paste an outline directly from Illustrator into FontLab. Note
    that some bugs have been reported with this method, and I believe Yuri is working
    to resolve these. At the moment, it is best to copy and past individual outlines,
    not groups of outlines. Very complex outlines may also have problems. <BR> <BR>2.
    You can save Illustrator outlines as EPS and import using the Glyph/&#39;Import
    from EPS...&#39; function. I should note that I have not used Illustrator for
    a long time &#40;I do all my drawing directly in FontLab&#41;, so I can&#39;t
    confirm that this method is without problems. <BR> <BR>I recommend that you join
    the <a href="http://groups.msn.com/FontLab">FontLab user community</a> on MSN.
    This is a very lively forum with lots of knowledgeable contributors.

  body: I think I can help, since I always relied on Illustrator to transfer vector
    art in FontStudio and now I started doing so in FontLab. <BR> <BR>Illustrator
    support the copy and paste function John mentioned, but the architecture of Illustrator
    10 is different. You should use Illustrator 8 or 9. <BR> <BR>If you have FreeHand
    10, you can easily use the &#34;copy special&#34; feature which allows a different
    copy strategy for different formats. Selecting the EPS format works exactly like
    if you are copying directly from Illustrator 8 or 9. <BR> <BR>I tested FontLab
    with a lot of RAM and very complex digitized forms of a hyper-decorated Art Nouveau
    alphabet juping back and forth between Illustrator 10 and Freehand 10 and FontLab
    and everything vorks fine. I&#39;m under MacOs 9.1, by the way.

  body: '&#62; [Oh, I really know nothing of FontLab &#40;I did not own previous version
    3 and I just bought the new 4.5&#41; compared to people like John Hudson or the
    fantastic John Butler, the OpenType maestro. Just out of curiosity: have you been
    able to copy directly from Illustrator 10 to FontLab cells or have you done it
    via FreeHand 10? I&#39;m under Os9, maybe you&#39;re under Jaguar &#40;OsX 10.2x&#41;?
    Also, I&#39;ve seen your ITC text face release, don&#39;t recall, the name. It
    seems very, very interesting but hard to judge from the small samples. Would it
    be possible to have a pdf? Besides, here in Italy many people used Monolein for
    Book covers, some in a very bad way. Monolein and SGI seem separated at birth,
    but SGI was more gracious, in my opinion.]'
