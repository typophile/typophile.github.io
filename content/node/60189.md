  currently using Fontographer to create.\r\n\r\nCan I make the font so that when
  two Zs (e.g. ZZ) are typed together they will produce a different looking combination
  effect versus if I use a Z in another way (e.g. Za or ZA)? Basically, ZZ is stylized
  a different way from a regular Z.\r\n\r\nI think this is called a ligature, but
  I'm new to font creation and new to Fontographer. I only found one mention of ligatures
  in the Fontographer manual.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance for the instruction."

    feature tag which goes like this:\r\n\r\n# Ligature formation\r\nfeature liga
    {\r\n     substitute f i by f_i;\r\n     substitute f l by f_l;\r\n} liga;\r\n\r\nYou
    can find more sample of this at:\r\nhttp://www.adobe.com/devnet/opentype/afdko/topic_feature_file_syntax.html\r\n\r\nUnfortunately,
    you can't write those feature tags in Fontographer. Fortunately, you can use a
    tool called VOLT which is freely downloadable from:\r\nhttp://www.microsoft.com/typography/VOLT.mspx\r\n\r\nGood
    luck!"

    liga {\r\nsubstitute Z Z by Z_Z;\r\n}liga;\r\n\r\nThe above worked like a champ
    where the new \"Double Z\" glyph was named Z_Z\r\n\r\nThanks!"
