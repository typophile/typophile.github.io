  body: "If I am seeing your image correctly, this is lettering on a glass window
    in France. It's roots are a 19th century copperplate script. There is a somewhat
    similar digital font, <a href=\"http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/mti/palace-script/\">Palace
    Script</a>. But that's not the name that the font was known as in France. More
    to follow.\r\nDon"

  body: "In France this type of script was known as Calligraphics and a version was
    produced by at least one French foundry, Deberny & Peignot. Closer to the lettering
    is Graphic Script Bold by Bauer, 1934:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/GraphicScriptBold@JaspertP381@20_3508.jpg]\r\nThe
    lettering is more upright and is heavier with lower contrast.\r\nIt is possible
    that this adaptation has been produced as a digital font, but I have not seen
    it.\r\nDon"

  body: "Can't find a match for the last one either, could be a customization of commercial
    brush script, mainly reworking connections and customizing /R to create a unique
    lettering.\r\nSome in the same vein: [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/mika-melvas/belinda|Belinda]],
