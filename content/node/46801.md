    from a stationer, is spelled \"stationery\". Things that don't move are stationary.
    I suppose one could have stationary stationery, as long as it doesn't move. \r\n\r\nThe

  body: "Oh, but I have.  The problem is I'm not looking for letterpress work per
    se, as I find that the letterpress aesthetic is a little more \"Mrs Eaves\" than
    I'm looking for.  I'm hoping to find stationery with a more modern, contemporary,
    clean look.  Are there any studios that specialize in this and have examples in
    their online portfolios perhaps?\r\n\r\n______________________________\r\nAwesome>>

    could work for inspiration. '

    looking in Flickr... like <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/groups/77871177@N00/pool/\">here</a>,
    <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/groups/bizcard/pool/\">here</a> and <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/groups/identitydesign/pool/\">here</a>.\r\nFinally,
    take a look at <a href=\"http://designarchives.aiga.org/\">AIGA Design Archives</a>.\r\n\r\nHope
    this will help... :) \r\n"

    does beautiful work with stationery, though it looks like more personal and advertising
    work rather than corporate.
