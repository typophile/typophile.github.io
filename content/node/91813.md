body: "A few years ago (2008-2009) I started to develop a Windows application to ease
  the tedium of adding OpenType features to fonts. I had to set it aside then, but
  I am now working out the kinks and finishing it off. And I wonder if it would be
  of any interest to fellow typophiles?\r\n\r\nIt opens an AFM file to get information
  about the glyphs in a font and then autogenerates classes and features based on
  glyph naming (and suffixes in particular). It also allows manual creation of features
  and exports a feature (FEA) file.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/TypeOpenerCapture_3935.JPG]\r\n\r\nIf
  there's interest, I'll package it up and share it. Again, it's a Windows application
  and requires the .NET Framework. \r\n\r\nDownload and give it a try: [[http://www.timrolands.com/More/Downloads.aspx]]\r\n\r\nTim"

    that already exists. Does VOLT work with both PS and TT flavored OpenType fonts?

    features each time it opens a font file.

  body: "This is totally different from VOLT.\r\n\r\nVOLT is a visual editing tool
    for developing OpenType Layout (including GPOS). It does not use Adobe's feature
    syntax, but its own visual representation and text formats.\r\n\r\n[Bendy, VOLT
    does not 'convert everything to TrueType'. VOLT's visual interface requires TTF
    for display of glyphs because the tool does not have a PostScript rasteriser,
    but it will open and compile CFF fonts. So if making CFF fonts I do my editing
    in a temporary TTF source, then import the VOLT .vtp project file into my OTF.]"

    body: "Here's a brief rundown of what the application actually does. It first
      loads all the glyphs from the AFM file. Then it looks for glyphs with suffixes
      that match certain features (e.g., all glyphs with .smcp suffixes for small
      caps). The supported features are currently determined by a text settings file,
      so as new features come along, they can be added. All of the glyphs with a given
      suffix are then added to a class named for the suffix with a \"1\" added. A
      corresponding class is created containing all the non-suffixed matching glyphs,
      and this class is also named for the suffix but with a \"0\" added. 1 and 0
      for on and off, respectively. Substitution rules are generated using these classes
      (e.g., sub @smcp0 by @smcp1). For ligatures, glyphs with underscores in the
      names are used to generate those rules (e.g., sub c t by c_t). Other features
      are currently a bit more hard coded, like fractions. Hope that helps.\r\n\r\nTim"

    also part of OTM [since 2009]. This means that the character set does not have

    covered by the character set will be removed automatically during compiling [this
