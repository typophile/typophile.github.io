  there and works in every package. Still all good.\r\n\r\nThe only problem I have
  is that when I come to print to PDF a Word document (or PowerPoint presentation)
  with the font in it, the output shows a PREVIOUS version of the font, not the current
  version in the Fonts folder (even though the documents themselves show the correct
  fonts and also print correctly to hard printers).\r\n\r\nCorruptness somewhere...\r\n\r\nIs
  there such a thing as a Microsoft Office font cache and how do I clear it?\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\nNick."

  body: "Nick - this is the first time that you mentioned that more than one font
    file is involved. A very common problem with a group of fonts in the same family
    is their names.  In Windows and Microsoft applications in particular, multiple
    font files with the same family name can be problematic. Such products can consistently
    recognize only four members of any given font family - regular, bold, italic,
    and bold-italic.  Other varieties, whether Heavy, Outline, or anything else, require
    separate font family names.  Otherwise, what you see and what gets used can vary,
    and can depend on which font is opened first.\r\n\r\nAdam Twardoch (in the fontlab
    forum) and Tom Phinney (I'm pretty sure) have posted specific font naming methods
    that ae said to allow different style names to be properly recognized. The one
    time I tried it I probably did something wrong.\r\n\r\n - Herb\r\n"

    differently (for the time being at least!), i.e. not with family naming conventions.\r\n\r\nThey
    are called NameThin, NameLight, NameRegular, NameMedium, NameBold, NameHeavy,
    NameBlack.\r\n\r\nThey are all saved as regulars (in spite of being different
    weights); there is no linking within them whatsoever. I figured that way nothing
    would go wrong...for now!\r\n\r\nIt is only the Regular that is causing me the
    problem and only from Office to PDF.\r\n\r\nI have renamed it and the problem
    has gone away. It's like there is a NameRegular ghost in the machine from a previous
    version that was installed a while ago and no amount of reinstalling the font
    into my Fonts folder is making it go away.\r\n\r\nBoohoo :("

  body: How long is the name (I assume "n a m e" in your post is actually a different
    font name in the font settings)? I've run into problems if the name is too long,
    and I notice that "regular" has more letters than any of the other style names.
    Just a thought.

    at straws, but ...\r\n\r\n What Windows and Office do have, though, are font substitution
    tables.  These usually say to use font B if font A isn't available, which doesn't
    seem to be your case, but one never knows.  You've never said what the font name
    itself is. There is one hidden truetype font, Marlett, as well as over 150 hidden
    .fon (bitmap screen display) files in the windows folder. As unlikely as a name
    conflict would be, who knows!\r\n\r\nRun Start/Run/Regedit and look in\r\nHKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows
    NT\\CurrentVersion\\Fonts\r\nand\r\nHKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows
    NT\\CurrentVersion\\FontSubstitutes\r\n\r\nto see if there's anything there that
    resembles your problem font or file name.\r\n\r\nIf not, you could search (edit/find)
    for some recognizable portion of  your font name and/or its file name to see if
    it's already in there somewhere \r\n\r\nAnd, of course, DOUBLE-CHECK your font
    and file names - it's possible that somewhere along the line you've named the
    'old' and 'new' versions slightly differently. Something almost invisible like
    two spaces instead of one, or a zero instead of an oh.\r\n\r\nAs I said, clutching
    at straws! At some point someone (probably you) will find the problem and its
    solution and will be something extremely simple and obvious!"

    have you taken the resulting PDF and moved it to another machine to see if it
    still displays the old version of the font? \r\n\r\nMy thought is to determine
    whether the old font is embedded in and travels with the PDF, or whether perhaps
    it\u2019s an issue just within your specific system displaying the old font. \r\n\r\nThis
    might help sort out whether it\u2019s Office that is accessing the old font and
    putting it into the PDF, or whether it\u2019s something about the system and Acrobat
    that is calling the old font for display. \r\n\r\nDoes that make sense?\r\n"

  body: "Kent, the pdf travels to other machines with the glitch file embedded in
    it. Thanks for the suggestion though.\r\n\r\nHerb, I have looked in the registry
    as you suggest and it turns out that every re-install of the font results in the
    font file having a new name...\r\n\r\nIt does it on the basis of hexidecimal numbers
    (FontnamRegular.otf, FontnamRegular_1.otf, FontnamRegular_2.otf ... FontnamRegular_F.otf,
    FontnamRegular_10.otf... etc.) so I reckon when I got to FontnamRegular_F.otf
    is was fine but I think the minute I went for a sixteenth version install, it
    took the name above 16 characters (i.e. FontnamRegular_10.otf) and maybe 17 characters
    is just too many for it to manage?\r\n\r\nAll my other names were shorter than
    Regular (Thin, Light, Medium, Bold, Heavy, Black) and so maybe the others were
    not affected.\r\n\r\nAnyway, somewhere in the registry must be a place where the
    computer knows it has had a font with the same name installed before and therefore
    makes a new name for it in the registry. The question is, where is this information
    stored? Must be a simple text file I would have thought.\r\n\r\nIntriguing. Any
    thoughts on where the computer stores the previous font names that have been installed
    in the past?\r\n\r\nI feel like I may be making some progress.\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\nNick."

    the font name is only activated if you are replacing a font that is already installed.
    If you delete the old font first, the name remains unaffected. However, if you
    delete subsequent versions and install again, the system adds the hexidecimal
    number whatever happens. It cannot seem to cope with going back to the original
    name once a replacement version has been installed without deleting the previous
    version.\r\n\r\nNew question then, where does the computer store the names of
    fonts that have been previous installed? It must store the names somewhere or
    how would it know to add '1' to the last name used in the registry."
