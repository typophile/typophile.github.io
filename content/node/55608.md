  is a positive integer as opposed to a negative one. i.e. bold effect 10 vs. bold
  effect -10, could it really be any different, it's applying the same function\u2026
  I know it's an imperfect science by nature but it seems like I have a lot more work
  to do if I apply a negative integer to a glyph than a positive\u2026 and I'm talking
  in general with relatively non-complex character forms\u2026"

    blend to extrapolate a light using your bold and your regular (or build a MM out
    of the regular and the bold). '

    suggestion is probably the way to go."

    building MM versions\u2026 I was wondering if the negative bold results were just
    my perception\u2026 thanks for the replies!"
