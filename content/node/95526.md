  body: "The font is [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/itfmecanorma/artdeco/art-deco/|
    Mecanorma's Art Deco MN]]  (with an alternate S).\r\n\r\nI wonder why you're at
    all concerned about classifying it as serif or sans-serif, which has no bearing
    on its identification. In fact, it's neither; it's not a text font but a display
    face."

title: Can you help me find this font in the picture? Can't tell if it can be classified
  as a serif since it has only 1 bar?
