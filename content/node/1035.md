  Who has the best price? Who has the best cut for the price? Who has the best price

  body: I do realize that using the term &#34;cut&#34; is incorrect as I&#39;m asking
    about digital type and not metal.

  body: I&#39;m partial the face Renner - from <a href="http://www.thefoundrystudio.co.uk/"
    target="_blank"> the Foundry</a> in England. Mostly because it has some of Renner&#39;s
    alternate forms. I&#39;ve never found them that useful, but they&#39;re fun to
    have none-the-less :-&#41;

  body: The <a href="http://www.adobe.com/type/browser/F/FUTQ/F_FUTQ-10016000.jhtml">Adobe
    version</a> is my least favorite. It was one of their  <BR>earliest releases and
    you can kinda tell. <BR> <BR>The <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/bitstream/futura/">Bitstream
    version</a> is pretty good, especially for text.  <BR>There is also <a href="http://www.neufville.com/uk/startfuk.htm">the
    new one from Neufville Digital</a> which looks  <BR>very good and has lots of
    extras like small caps and old  <BR>style numerals. Also, it has CE, Turkish and
    Baltic language  <BR>support. <BR> <BR>One thing that I miss from the pre-digital
    days are the  <BR>display cuts of Futura. All the available digital versions  <BR>seem
    to be based on the text sizes &#40;except, I remember  <BR>Image Club did display
    versions, I don&#39;t know if those are  <BR>still available&#41;. The text cuts--even
    good ones--look a bit  <BR>clumsy at display sizes.

  body: Ok. So I know Futura isn&#39;t a favorite. Sorry about that. On the Neufville
    tip. Does anyone know who has the best price on it? It&#39;s a pricey little sucker
    innit? <IMG SRC="http://www.typophile.com/forums/clipart/happy.gif" ALT=":-&#41;"

  body: '&#62; On the Neufville tip. <BR> <BR>The good news for Apple lovers is that
    the version of Futura included with Mac OS X is the Neufville cut. If however
    you need the SC, OSF or a full set of weights, you&#39;ll have to lay down some
    cash as only the &#34;inexpert&#34; sets in four weights are included.'

  body: I&#39;ve always been partial to the Futura I have from URW. Lots of weights,
    very nice &#34;cut&#34;. They also have Futura  2, which as far as I can tell
    mimics some of the &#34;Spartan&#34; types. <BR> <BR>FWIW, I think that URW&#39;s
    Helvetica under the &#34;Nimbus Sans&#34; moniker is the best Helvetica around.
