  as well as lots and lots of companies that operate in the field of well-being, find
  it hard to choose anything different from Helvetica Light Extended. I don't blame
  them, it looks awfully good (I was going to type <cite>awesome</cite>, but that's
  a bit too much...).\r\n\r\nAnyway, I thought \"Why not make them an alternative?\".
  Light, wide, clean... I've used a big part of my free Sunday to draw up some glyps.
  They need a lot more work, but I'ld like to hear your opinions for now...\r\n\r\nThanks."

    H and N even more. \"g\" looks good when it is big but when it is small the neck
    looks a bit clumsy. Perhaps try to lower the loop a little bit.\r\nGood luck with
    the \"s\"!"

    bit too much stroke contrast."

  body: "Hey, lovely idea here! naturally being a art school student, I grown quite
    a pious reverence for helvetica in all it's forms, but its cool to see it alternatives
    being thought up.\r\n\r\nI like the idea present in the /K/ but it seems pretty
    wide.\r\n\r\nThe simplicity of the /G/ is exciting to me, maybe a similar treatment
    for the /Q/?\r\n\r\nThere is something weird in the joint of the /Y/, not quite
    sure what but take a closer look.\r\n\r\nThe right of the /W/ has a weird moment
    at the baseline joints.\r\n\r\nMaybe you can play with the flag of the /r/ its
    pretty intense right now.\r\n\r\nRegardless, nice stuff going on here. There is
    really something about the /G/, maybe it's just me."
