body: This is my first attempt at designing a typeface from the ground  <BR>up, any
  and all comments are appreciated. Be brutal -- I want  <BR>to learn! <BR> <BR>I
  wasn&#39;t entirely sure whether to post this here or in the display  <BR>section,
  since I only really intended it to be used in large sizes.  <BR>A couple of people
  have told me they like it in smaller sizes, but  <BR>I think it&#39;s too heavy.
  I may make a lighter &#40;and better spaced <BR>for text&#41; weight if this one
  turns out OK. <BR> <BR>Thanks in advance, <BR> <BR>Jordan <BR> <BR><img src="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/29/21589.gif"

    I need a new name for this! <BR> <BR>Jordan
