body: "Hello Everybody.\r\nMy name is Javier Rosa, I am from Barcelona. I am both
  a graphic design professional and student. Currently I am working on my final degree
  project.\r\nA week ago I've sent emails asking some information for that project
  to relevant people in the script typography field. One of this relevant persons,
  Bas Jacobs, suggested me to post a message in this board, and I thought it was a
  good idea, so here am I asking for your help.\r\nThis project is a theoretical one,
  developed in basis of a hypothesis. I personally have decided to focus the paper
  on script typography. The starting point of the work is the hypothesis below:\r\n<em>Studying
  the process used in designing text typefaces and the knowledge in legibility it
  is possible to develop a new design process for script typefaces that, if applied,
  would originate better script typefaces for large text use.</em>\r\nThe main subjects
  in the body of my paper are script typeface history, legibility / readability, and
  the differences in design processes between sans serif/serif and script typefaces.\r\nI
  have found a few sources that reflect the basic process of designing typefaces,
  but I have not  found many resources related to script typefaces. So, here are the
  issues I need to deepen:\r\n\r\n<strong>Sketching:</strong>\r\nGiven that the simulation
  of calligraphy and handwriting is the main treat for considering a typeface as script,
  I would like to know:\r\n-How important is the use of specific writing tools such
  as pen nibs, pencils or brushes?\r\n\r\n<strong>Tracing glyphs:</strong>\r\n-Should
  we draw the entire character set in paper before digitalizing it? Or, it is possible
  to work with modules, sketching just the few that contain the main treats at first,
  tracing them, and then developing the rest of the characters in the set with pieces
  and strokes of the firsts?\r\n\r\n<strong>Optical corrections:</strong>\r\nI know
  that there are some issues in diagonal crossing paths that look unaligned, which
  makes necessary to correct these intersections by using the eye as the main tool.
  \r\n- Is there any other specific optical adjustment in script typefaces?\r\n\r\n<strong>Letter
  spacing & letter connections:</strong>\r\nThis is a key point. Laura Worthington
  has made a webinar (some kind of workshop via videoconference) in collaboration
  with the FontLab web. There, Laura explains a method for making seamless connections
  between letters. In short, in this method she traces a master character, which is
  a copperplate \"r\", whose entrance and exit strokes coincide seamlessly when placed
  consecutively.\r\nIn the next step she attaches the entrance and the exit of the
  master letter to the rest of the characters of the set that need it.\r\nI think
  that this method does not take into account the rhythm needed for legibility, because
  of the fact that the letter spacing is determined just by the entrance and exit
  strokes previously created for the letter \"r\".\r\n- Is there any other method
  that takes into account the rhythm in connected scripts?\r\n\r\n<strong>A selection
  of high legibility scripts:</strong>\r\nBesides the process behind the designing
  of script typefaces I've got another question related to the same research. In the
  next step of my paper I'm going to analyze a number of different script typefaces,
  chosen by its good legibility, comparing its properties with legibility facts such
  as glyph differentiation, consistence in the forms of the typographic set, contrast,
  inclination, letter spacing, opening of the counters and so on.\r\nIt would be very
  useful if you suggest me script typefaces that stands out by its legibility.\r\nI've
  pre-selected a few which include Bickham Script by Richard Lipton, Supernova by
  Martina Flor, and Savoye by Alan Meeks.\r\nBut anyway, my opinion is not too relevant
  in this field, it is by far more rigorous if some professional specialized in script
  typography provide me some better examples in order to reference it on my project.\r\n\r\nI
  will be very grateful if you could answer my questions. Otherwise, if you cannot
  answer them, I would like you to provide me with names of professionals who could
  help me  with this task.\r\n\r\nThanks for giving me a portion of your time.\r\nJavier
  Rosa\r\n"

  body: "I conceived of <a href=\"http://shinntype.com/typefaces/handsome/\">Handsome</a>
    with text font functionality.\r\nFor this reason, it has a large x-height and
    relatively short capitals and descenders for a handwriting typeface, enabling
    close leading.\r\nIt also has a variety of weights and styles, better enabling
    typographic layouts.\r\n\r\nWhen I produced the Pro version, I used the Contextual
    Alternates feature to:\r\n\u2022 employ the traditional \u201Cjoining rules\u201D
    of connected, cursive writing\r\n\u2022 avoid duplicate double-letters, for organic
    comfort\r\n\u2022 remove entry and exit strokes at the beginning and end of words,
    to create more discrete word spaces, which, in my opinion, produce smoother reading.\r\n\r\nIt
    is not as polished a face as, say, Sanvito (the original OpenType script typeface),
    as I wanted to give it a lively and casual quality, and \u201Cwrote\u201D it in
    Fontographer using a Wacom tablet and stylus, which lacks the feel and control
    of writing with pen on paper. But I don\u2019t think that has much bearing on
    legibility.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

  body: "Hi Nick\r\nHandsome looks very readable, it is a very good example to start
    comparing.\r\n\r\nSanvito, although it is very readable, poses a new problem.
    This is a script typeface? I mean, is based on the Carolingian calligraphy and
    therefore, by definition, it is a script. However, in my opinion, the fact that
    does not resemble traditional cursive handwriting may cause to not look like it
    is handcrafted to most mortals.\r\nIt seems that it is a dillema between polised
    - readable and organic-handmade look, so if we want a very readable script typeface
    it will end up in most of the cases in a not-so-handmade-look typeface. I'm I
    right?"

  body: "Hello Les ONeill, I agreed. This is how my project starts.\r\nBased on the
    opinions of diverse typographers and the Vox-ATypI definition, I conclude that
    the main treat of the script typefaces is its cursive or italic structure. Besides
    that, there are a number of aspects that can reinforce its handwritten appearance,
    such as connecting letters, inclination, variations on the letterforms and texture.
    This optional features, as said, reinforce its handmade look, but often goes in
    detriment of legibility."
