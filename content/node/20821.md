body: "\"To design is to communicate clearly by whatever means you can control or
  master.\" \u2013\_Milton Glaser\r\n\r\n\"Art has to move you and design does not,
  unless it's a good design for a bus.\" \u2013\_David Hockney\r\n\r\n\"Both optimists
  and pessimists contribute to our society. The optimist invents the airplane and
  the pessimist the parachute.\" \u2013\_Gil Stern\r\n\r\n\"Design is a plan for arranging
  elements in such a way as best to accomplish a particular purpose.\"\_\u2013\_Charles
  Eames\r\n\r\n\"It's not what you look at that matters, it's what you see.\" \u2013
  Henry David Thoreau\r\n\r\n\"In art the hand can never execute anything higher than
  the heart can inspire.\" \u2013\_Ralph Waldo Emerson\r\n\r\n\"Painting is poetry
  that is seen rather than felt, and poetry is painting that is felt rather than seen.\"
  \u2013\_Leonardo da Vinci\r\n\r\n\"The visual image is a kind of tripwire for the
  emotions.\" \u2013\_Diane Ackerman\r\n\r\n\"Designers can create normalcy out of
  chaos; they can clearly communicate ideas through the organising and manipulating
  of words and pictures.\" \u2013\_Jeffery Veen\r\n\r\n\"Design is in everything we
  make, but it\u2019s also between those things. It's a mix of craft, science, storytelling,
  propaganda, and philosophy.\" \u2013\_Erik Adigard\r\n\r\n\"A common mistake that
  people make when trying to design something completely foolproof is to underestimate
  the ingenuity of complete fools.\" \u2013\_Douglas Adams\r\n\r\n\"Life beats down
  and crushes the soul and art reminds you that you have one.\" \u2013\_Stella Adler\r\n\r\n\"Design
  in art, is a recognition of the relation between various things, various elements
  in the creative flux. You can't invent a design. You recognize it, in the fourth
  dimension. That is, with your blood and your bones, as well as with your eyes.\"
  \u2013\_D. H. Lawrence\r\n\r\n\"Delay always breeds danger; and to protract a great
  design is often to ruin it.\" \u2013\_Miguel de Cervantes\r\n\r\n\"There is always
  a heavy demand for fresh mediocrity. In every generation the least cultivated taste
  has the largest appetite.\" \u2013\_Paul Gauguin\r\n\r\n\"Design, in its broadest
  sense, is the enabler of the digital era - it's a process that creates order out
  of chaos, that renders technology usable to business. Design means being good, not
  just looking good.\" \u2013\_Clement Mok"

  body: "Hi Jesse,\r\n\r\nsorry about the loss of your data, but i am afraid you won't
    find much sympathy with this kind of request here. \r\n\r\n<cite>I\u2019m trying
    to replenish cool textures, vector sets, fonts, basically anything that\u2019s
    beautiful and useful.\r\nPlease don\u2019t hesitate to hit me up with any juicy
    links or if you want to send me anything directly, please feel free.</cite>\r\n\r\nThis
    just sounds \"arrrgh, Pirate\" to me. If you purchased licenses for your fonts
    etc you shouldn't have a problem in getting new copies. But hey, maybe you are
    a good guy and i am just paranoid...\r\n\r\n"
