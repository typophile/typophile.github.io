    looks like a good substitute

  body: "The book is printed in a typeface of the era classified as \"modernized old
    style.\"\r\nFoundries had very similar versions under various names, e.g. ATF's
    Binny & Bradford. Here are a couple of generally matching samples from Devinne's
    1899 book on printing types:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Devinne1899p195detail_3657.jpg]\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Devinne1899p196detail_4769.jpg]\r\nThese
    typefaces virtually disappeared after 1900 with the revival of classic typefaces
    of the 17th and 18th centuries, e.g. Caslon, and new designs, particularly those
    produced by ATF under the direction of Morris Fuller Benton, which are still in
    the standard repertoire for book printing.\r\nDon"

  body: "I wish I could offer you a digital revival of a 19th century \"modernized
    old style\" but so far I have drawn a blank. Another popular font of the era,
    Ronaldson, has been revived by Canada Type, but it has much larger serifs on the
    arms and looks quite different.\r\nDon"

    though not introduced until after 1900, has a bit of the right feel, as does [[http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/bitstream/bookman/|Bookman]]
    (<em>not</em> Ed Benguiat''s 1975 version of Bookman for ITC). They are both revivals
    of Old Style Antique designed by Alexander Phemister in 1858 for the Miller and
    Richard foundry in Edinburgh. Bruce Type Foundry produced a US version.'

  body: "The story of Century Oldstyle is interesting. The publisher of the Century
    Magazine, Theodore Low De Vinne, was unsatisfied with the available typefaces,
    whether \"modernized old style\" or \"modern\" Bodonis, and in 1894, or thereabouts,
    \ commissioned Linn Boyd Benton at ATF to create a font with higher technical
    standards using new punch-cutting  technology at ATF. Century Oldstyle was the
    first of the new generation of fonts that we still use today. Also note that the
    appearance of Century Oldstyle is blacker than the rather wispy \"modernized old
    style\" fonts. It also has larger x-height and more condensed proportions.\r\nAs
    for the BT Bookman, I agree that given the lack of \"modernized old style\" revivals,
    BT Bookman might be as good a substitute as any if we were to reset the text in
    this specimen in something that had some of the flavor of the \"modernized old
    style\" type used in it.\r\nDon"

title: 1898 book font - common but what is it?
