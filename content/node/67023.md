  clips. Lot's of them are about the alphabet and I just wanted you all\r\nto see
  them. After a day of serious type work I am enjoying some friendly\r\ninterpretations
  of the alphabet. Hope you enjoy too!\r\n\r\nThanks for always answering my questions.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.youtube.com/user/mstatz#p/u"
