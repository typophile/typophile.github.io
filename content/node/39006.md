  on selling the font (it's really just for my own use), but I'm acting as if I will,
  because I want the experience of creating a polished font that would meet the requirements
  of a commercially viable font.\r\n\r\nWhich codepages does everyone think the average,
  commercially useful font should support? I'm using Fontlab on Windows, and have
  so far completed the MS Windows 1252 Western codepage. I've also included additional
  characters, such as L slash, the fi and fl ligatures, and a few additional diacritical
  marks.\r\n\r\nSo far, I've been basically shooting for the union of the Windows
  1252 and MacOS Roman code pages. Am I leaving anything out this way? I notice that
  neither codepage includes additional ligatures like ffi and ffl. Is there a more
  standard list of \"usually supported\" codepages among the major fonts out there?\r\n\r\nBefore
  I move on to metrics and the final round of details, I want to finalize my codepage
  support and wrap up all the remaining glyphs.\r\n\r\nThanks!"

  body: If by "average, commercially useful font" you mean one adequate for setting
    "western" languages in an office setting, then the Mac Roman/Windows 1252 would
    do for a minimum. Whether you need additional ligatures such as ffi and ffl would
    depend on the font design. And then of course there are old style figures, lining
    figures, small caps, scientific inferiors and superiors . . . all kinds of additional
    glyphs that can extand the usefulness of the font, not even considering additional
    language support.

    glyph set:\r\n\r\nMS Windows 1250 Central European\r\nMS Windows 1254 Turkish\r\nMS
    Windows 1257 Baltic\r\n\r\nThese ranges along with 1252 seems to be becoming the
    default character set for OT fonts.\r\n(at least that is the way we are looking
    at it)\r\n\r\n"
