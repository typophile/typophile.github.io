  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>I come across this word a bit; and most recently in Nick Shinn&rsquo;s post slamming free, seasonal promotional calendars. I use it myself to describe stuff that looks too trendy and too busy. I wondered: what do we mean when we say something is overdesigned? What makes something overdesigned? How do you quantify design so that you can recognise when there is too much? What is the difference, if any between badly designed and over designed?</p>
<p>Maybe an object is overdesigned when it&rsquo;s visually appealing but its function (so readability/useabilty/legibility) has been impeded by too many concepts or design elements or where an information system has been imposed where none is required (such as colour coding, directional arows, subtitles etc). Maybe it&rsquo;s also where the design is constantly &lsquo;noticed&rsquo; so that it becomes irritating, when it should be subservient to an object&rsquo;s function and so, after a period of time, disappear into the background as &lsquo;design&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Kind of incoherent sorry, what are your thoughts?</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>If you&rsquo;ve ever watched film of any (I&rsquo;m thinking now of New York School) painters work you can catch them wondering when a painting is finished. We all know approximately how subjective the idea of finished is, but we also can look at something and know when it has been worked a little too long.</p>
<p>Maybe there is a point where every element is necessary and more is too much. You wisely hear graphic designers comment for attempting to pull information together without resorting to the use of bold. It is another attempt to reign in the desire to overdecorate and overcompensate. I think designers really need good writers and editors to bring communication into a tight form. This makes success possible.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve kind of gone the other way in my design, to what I think most designers do; I started off being quite cautious and fearful of designiness and little elements and bolding and boxing things off and expressiveness for its own sake but just ended up with things that were functional but very plain and boring. I realised firstly, that I just didn&rsquo;t know how to do that other stuff and secondly, that the design that appealed to me wasn&rsquo;t plain and brutish like the stuff I came up with but more nuanced and massaged. I&rsquo;m guess nowadays I&rsquo;m trying to learn how to use detail to make things look&hellip; well&hellip; better for want of a better way of describing it.</p>
<p>But, no, I never know when I&rsquo;ve finished, I stop when I&rsquo;ve hemorrhaged enough time and the deadline rises up to smack me in the face.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>It really depends on the project. When I started doing classified display ads, I wanted to make them look &ldquo;pretty,&rdquo; so I used things like Emigre&rsquo;s Tribute or H&amp;FJ&rsquo;s Requim or fancy stuff like fleurons and whatever. (Surprized I didn&rsquo;t use Lagarto&hellip;)</p>
<p>But then after a while I realized that nobody cared, and what was worse, that the ad next to it set in all caps Helvetica caught more people&rsquo;s attention and thus served its purpose better. And it took 1/8 of the time to create.</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s refered to in the industry as &ldquo;straight out of art school&rdquo; and it takes a while in the trenches to figure it out.</p>

		<div class="commentbody">Overdesign means trying to impress and persuade with technique that does not fully address the needs of the content.
It can be hard to gauge how much professional slickness is enough, but clients are pretty good at keeping creatives on track.
However, in certain circumstances, that check and balance is not so evident, for instance pro bono work, and graphic trade marketing&ndash;to creatives&ndash;which is assumed to require in-your-face expression that will be appreciated for its own sake.</div>
