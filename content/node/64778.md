  they want to use it now for another project. Can you suggest a font similiar that
  would do the job similar to this. I'm after a flowing upright handwritten font ideally
  which will work well stacked on two lines\r\n\r\nhttp://new.myfonts.com/fonts/bluevinyl/shimmer/\r\n\r\nThanks
  all for your help on this! \r\n\r\nD"
