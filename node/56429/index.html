  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>I&rsquo;m in my fourth and final year of a design degree and am working on my final project. The project is a hypothetical, where the advertising industry (&lsquo;Madison Ave&rsquo;) is feeling the effects of the global recession and is embarking on a widespread advertising campaign. The whole thing is very much anti-advertising, and is designed to highlight how the idea of &lsquo;the consumer&rsquo; is really a product of the advertising industry. [[http://www.danflan.com.au/links/poster.jpg|This]] might give you a better idea of the whole idea, or if your really keen I&rsquo;ve posted my brief up [[http://danflan.com.au/madisonave/?page_id=2|here]].</p>
<p>Anyway, although its all early stages at the moment, I&rsquo;m up to the visual identity bit (small part of the assignment, but pretty important for everything to come), and am eager to get some outside feedback.</p>
<p>[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Post1_1_6202.jpg]</p>
<p>Visually, the aim of the identity is to appear slightly detached from the content. I want the logo to be somewhat ambiguous — playfully neutral — and hardly distinguished from a design one might expect from companies manufacturing pharmaceuticals or light-globes. Aside from a few clues, the logo that I have identified doesn’t say all that much about the ‘client’, and isn’t supposed to.</p>
<p>The alternate ideas all had a few issues associated with them (the first one is a bit cliche, the second one doesnt scale well), but have included them here for good measure.</p>
<p>Finally, I know this is probably too much to ask, and of course feedback in any form would be massively appreciated, but I&rsquo;ve set up a blog at [[http://www.danflan.com.au/madisonave]] (as an assessable task) to keep track of the project and for this sort of thing so any posts on that page would be appreciated beyond belief,</p>
<p>Anyway, love to hear what you think, criticisms and any suggestions,</p>
<p>Thanks in advance,</p>
<p>Dan Flan</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s something that I considered at the start, and then kind of shifted the word Mad to become a smaller secondary mark on its own.</p>
<p>However, highlighting the mad subtly would be keeping inline with the projects concept, so I&rsquo;ll put together a few more designs keeping that in mind,</p>
<p>I feel like just putting a line under the word is a bit of a cop out (and thats probably why I&rsquo;m not all that happy with the current logo), but any weight, colour or face changes would probably make it a bit too obvious.. Do you have any ideas?</p>

<p>Although I still like the look of a few of those shapes in series, I would be kind of happy to ditch that shape anyway because making the t.v. association is really pigeon holing advertising to just one type of advertising.</p>

I agree with your observation, some of the revised designs are strikingly similar to the Mad Men logo. Out of curiosity, do you think that this is necessarily a bad thing considering their common origins? Is this (originally unintended) pop-culture reference at all appropriate?</p>
<p>Incidentally, Mad Men season 1 is due to air on Australian free to air in the next few weeks, looking forward to seeing whether it lives up to the hype..</p>
<p>Will:
Thanks for your suggestion, I&rsquo;ll give it a go in the next round</p>
<p>Epsillicon:
That ad is amazing, thanks for posting it. He&rsquo;s living the dream</p>
<p>Alaskan:
Thelma and Louise is actually only two degrees from Kevin Bacon. Geena Davis was in Cutthroat with Frank Langella who was in Frost/Nixon with Kevin Bacon</p>
<p>Litera:
I really like your suggestion for the name, and in an ideal world I would probably run with it. However, such an application would probably go over the head of the intended audience. Speaking with people about my project so far, I&rsquo;ve found that a lot of people— although liking the name — have never heard of Madison Ave. and those who have often don&rsquo;t make the association with advertising. Being clever with the name like that would almost certainly add to the confusion.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;re completely right about the two lines under AD being distracting and looking like illegible text, thanks for that, I&rsquo;ll keep it in mind with upcoming revisions. And thank you for liking the colours, I&rsquo;m also really happy with them.</p>
<p>To answer your question, as you guessed, I&rsquo;m being a bit indecisive, but I think I&rsquo;m probably more inclined to highlight the MAD as suggested by William. I&rsquo;m only continuing to highlight the AD to address the above problem of people not linking Madison Avenue with advertising.</p>
<p>What do you think? Have I been speaking to a select few people who just don&rsquo;t get the reference?</p>
<p>Thanks for your words,</p>

But the shape doesn&rsquo;t really matter for the typography, and I think it&rsquo;s good that you&rsquo;re starting to develop that independant from the tv-shape. But I wouldn&rsquo;t ditch it just yet because it is slightly reminiscent of YouTybe. :)</div>

Aesthetically, it looks a bit out of balance.
The line under MAD and the placement of AVE creates a kind of diagonal which pulls it down on the left side.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Hi Dan.</p>
<p>1A, is somewhat ackward. It is less legible/readable (I&rsquo;m Dutch, never understood the difference).
My option (of the ones shown) would be 1B.
I like it clean. And it stacks pretty nice.
2A could also be a contender.</p>
<p>What are you trying to do with the line underneath ISON?
You emphasize it, is that what you want?</p>
<p>3A-AVE is very small and I guess it will be unreadable when small and/or printed in difference colours (CMYK).</p>

		<div class="commentbody">Hi Ray, fellow Groninger ;) Legibility is the quality of a typeface itself, how well you can read it. Readability is how well you can read the design of a piece of typography, so the design of the printed page. Or at least&hellip; I think.</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Thanks a ton for your feedback Ray,</p>
<p>Well observed that the line highlights the &lsquo;ISON&rsquo;, that wasn&rsquo;t my intention, so I won&rsquo;t be running with any of those on line 2,</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s kind of getting to the stage in the project where I need to finalize the logo design, so I&rsquo;m making the decision to run with the last ones that I posted (the ones with the block around AVE) — unless anyone notices anything that jumps out as drastically wrong?</p>
<p>Anyway, thanks again for your feedback,</p>
<p>Dan</p>

Maybe?</p>
