body: This is killing me! I designed this card with these fonts that came on my computer
  (two computers ago) and I didn't keep record of their names. Can anyone tell me
  the names of the three fonts used in my business card?!  Thank you so much![img:sites/default/files/old-images/WSlogojpg_3976.JPG]
