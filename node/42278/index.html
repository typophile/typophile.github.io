  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>Hello All,
I work at a magazine and we&rsquo;re discussing our use of the [[ellipsis]]. Currently, we use period, full space, period, etc. and I find it makes me crazy. There&rsquo;s just way too much space. I suggested using period, thin space, period, etc. but a friend told me I should just use the glyph since that&rsquo;s what it&rsquo;s there for.</p>
<p>What type of ellipsis are people using these days?</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

<p>Q. Our writing department uses Chicago’s style of putting spaces between the periods in ellipses. The graphic designers argue that in typesetting, the space is much smaller, and so use the ellipses character that is built into our publishing software. Who is correct?</p>
<p>A. Everyone is correct. Chicago uses the spaces, but not everyone follows Chicago style. Someone in your department just needs to pick a style and stick with it. If you use the ellipsis character, make sure your typesetters know whether you want spaces between the dots.</p>
<p>(of course the last sentence of the answer makes no sense - if you use the ellipsis character you can&rsquo;t put spaces btw the dots)</p>

<p>Be aware that there are multiple styles &ndash; Associated Press has one style, Chicago another, Modern Language Association another . . .</p>
<p>Consider this, too. If you use a fixed space between the points in (and perhaps around) an ellipsis, you have a character that takes up an em&rsquo;s worth of space or more, conjoined to a word that probably takes up several ems worth of space. You also remove those spaces within the ellipsis as &ldquo;justifying&rdquo; spaces in a line. Finally, many editors also don&rsquo;t want to have an ellipsis begin or end a line. All right, now if you follow all these purities (fixed spaces, no line breaks, etc.,) there are going to be times when, in setting justified copy, the few remaining justifying word spaces in a line are either have to be huge (loose line) or tiny (tight line), in order to set the line. I suppose if you are only setting 60 lines &ndash; a brochure &ndash; that can be worked around. If you are setting a book, 7,000 lines, that&rsquo;s a PITA with any author favoring ellipses . . .</p>
<p>BTW, PattyFab, my old Chicago says to use a 3-to-the-em fixed space between the points. (13th ed, section 10.36). That&rsquo;s a honking big space &ndash; bigger than a nominal justifying word space. We tried to make them see the error of that spec when we wrote the glossary; dunno if they made a change in later editions.</p>
<p>Charles' favorite dictum: &ldquo;All editors, and all designers, would be better at their jobs if they had set type for a while.&rdquo;</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Most editors are traditionalists and will prefer spaced periods. Most typographers consider this to be usually too much space.</p>
<p>Periods set tight are too tight. Looks miserly.</p>
<p>I think that using the ellipsis character can have it&rsquo;s own problems. For one thing, the design (spacing) of the ellipsis character can vary greatly among designers/foundries. Some are too tight, some are too loose. Usually the spacing between ellipsis and period has not been taken into consideration.</p>
<p>Charles mentioned the problems with justifying, and Patty mentioned the problem with line breaks. (Patty, I can&rsquo;t remember how I used to do it in Quark, but you can search out the sequence period-space-period-space-period and substitute non-breaking spaces. I think you might have to export the text as tagged text and use the code for the non-breaking space, then re-import. It&rsquo;s been a while.)</p>
<p>After some consideration, the practice I&rsquo;ve arrived at in my own type designs is to space the ellipsis periods with an interval equal to the space character &ndash; this yields an ellipsis which is a little tighter than spaced periods because is leaves out the sidebearings from the period character, but is looser than unspaced periods.</p>
<p>I then set the sidebearings on the ellipsis so that when set alongside a period, the space between the two is consistent with the internal spacing of the ellipsis (this yields sidebearings on the ellipsis that are wider than the period).</p>
<p>While I do some pair-kerning with the period, I don&rsquo;t apply the kerning values to the ellipsis. So there&rsquo;s a subtle distinction between period-ellipsis and ellipsis-period sequences, which shows up in the spacing relationship with the surrounding characters. I feel these differences support the subtle distinctions in how/why an author might sequence the two in either fashion.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>My 2 cents:</p>
<p>**  If you use the ellipsis character with justifying spaces flanking, you will at times end up with huge word spaces throughout the line, and then those tiny spaces between the ellipsis points. Looks really stupid. In fact, it says to me &ldquo;the person who designed this layout or set this type . . . doesn&rsquo;t know how to make a line look good.&rdquo;</p>
<p>**  I am not a strong believer that an ellipsis should not start a line. As a reader I find it no impediment to moving through the text. As a typographer, that little bit of open space does not look bad. Allowing a line to start with an ellipsis may also be a way to solve some other spacing problems.</p>
<p>**  My preferred method is to use thin spaces within and flanking the ellipsis. If you have designed your text well, and used H&amp;Js that will give you nice, tight word spaces, the thins won&rsquo;t be that much different from the justifying spaces. This is what Al Johnson at Phoenix Type here in Minnesota does when he sets type for me.</p>
<p>**  If all typeface designers took the care with the ellipsis (and with other sorts) that Kent does we&rsquo;d all be better off and be able to go home earlier. Few do, though.</p>
<p>**  Don&rsquo;t let editors badger you about type . . . or ellipses. Teach them what looks good.</p>
<p>**  I was going to use the ellipsis character in this post, to make a point (so to speak), but I don&rsquo;t know where it is. I guess I don&rsquo;t really care since I&rsquo;ll never use it.</p>

<p>Fifty years pass. Typewriters become extinct. Computer fonts do have ellipsis characters, but people who grew up with the typewriter spaced versions think they look too tight. It is like the second space after a period, which we are just now beginning to train typewriter-indocrinated people to omit.</p>
<p>The solution is simple. Use the character that a professional typeface designer created to look perfect with his or her font. If that character is wrong, then you probably have a poorly designed font.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m sorry, but I don&rsquo;t buy this &ldquo;typewriterism&rdquo; theory. There was no ellipsis character in the foundry case or on the Linotype/Monotype keyboard either, back when the typewriter was commonplace. The ellipsis was always formed from periods and spaces. The difference was that the typesetter had a variety of spaces at his command. The &ldquo;typewriter-er&rdquo; did not.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think there existed a pre-composed ellipsis prior to digital type.</p>

<p>I actually don&rsquo;t think most typeface designers create the ellipsis to look perfect with their fonts, since perfect (in the case of the ellipsis) is a function of the setting, not the typeface design.</p>
<p>Personally, I don&rsquo;t advocate the use of the pre-composed ellipsis for the reasons cited by Will and Charles. Given that it exists as part of the standard character set, I try to design it with care. But I don&rsquo;t use it myself.</p>
<p><cite> &gt; Isn’t the traditional method for foundries to make the ellipsis em-width?
Does that still have any merit? </cite></p>
<p>For all the reasons cited here, I think the em-width approach has no merit. I think this was another &ldquo;standard&rdquo; developed by early digital pioneers who weren&rsquo;t actually typesetters.</p>

<p>According to <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/typography/developers/fdsspec/punc.htm">Microsoft&rsquo;s character standards</a>, this is the correct way to fit this glyph. However, a quick check of the new CT fonts found that only 1 family actually followed this rule.</p>

<p>Anyway, given that a best case scenario would be to avoid the character and make each instance using the period and spaces, I find three basic possible configurations for the ellipsis glyph.</p>
<p><img src="/images/old-images/Example_3624.gif" alt=""></p>
<p>What is most confusing is that in the current Chicago, it appears that the examples vary from what I&rsquo;m showing above. Examples like number one above show a sentence space after the ellipsis. In examples like number two above there is a word space after the period. (11.63 &amp; 11.64 for those following at home)</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not a type designer, but it would seem there are uses for three separate characters, given that two would be identical save the side bearings.</p>

Likewise, I agree with those who find the included ellipsis in fonts to be too tight; is it ok to have a character wider than the em in fonts? I currently use a macro that inserts a space, then a combination of 3 periods and 2 non-breaking spaces, all with character style having tighter tracking, and finally a normal space. This works for the fonts I use. The first line below uses this method; 2nd line is spaces and periods, 3rd is the font&rsquo;s built-in ellipsis with regular spaces. <img src="/images/old-images/ellipsis_3504.png" alt=""></div>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Thomas: <cite>Why not just format it with “no break”? Or is this a feature not present in your DTP software?</cite></p>
<p>If you mean the <em>nobreak</em> space character, it is usually 500 units &ndash; an en-space. Too big.</p>
<p>Back when we were using TeX, we had a new customer who used Quark, and wanted an ellipsis with fixed space between the periods, rather than the justifying word space (my preference). But they had trouble specifying that fixed space. With TeX, we could define \ellip{} to be anything (e.g., .\hskip.02em{}.\hskip.02em{}.). We set ellipses with about 30 different values for the horizontal skip, so they could pick a value. Faced with that level of choice, they just gave up &amp; said &ldquo;set what you think looks good.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Varying house style s not something the type designer should address. From my point of view, the ellipsis character is there only for those who don&rsquo;t really have an opinion.</p>
<p>As to Chicago Style, I&rsquo;ve sat in too many meeting where the Chicago editors had to field complaints about &ldquo;Chicago style.&rdquo; Their answer, which seems perfectly appropriate to me, is that Chicago Style is the house style of the University of Chicago Press. Anyone who doesn&rsquo;t want to follow a particular part of it is free to do what they want. And while rare in practice, the University of Chicago Press does, on occasion, vary from their house style when it makes sense to do so. Formatting tables is one obvious place where the overall design of a book may require varying from the standard template &amp; style. That some other editors take Chicago Style as revealed truth rather than a way to proceed when all other things are equal is not Chicago&rsquo;s problem.</p>
<p>The best answer is to think about what an ellipsis signals, and how this is best done within the rhythm of the text. It would be a copout to only look at what Bringhurst says, or Chicago says. Whatever you come up with will be a compromise, so pay attention to what you are willing to live with.</p>

	<div class="card-body">
		<div class="commentbody"><p>I haven&rsquo;t read every scrap of text on this thread but will offer my take on ellipsis for what it&rsquo;s worth.</p>
<p>(1) To a type designer, ellipsis is a single, self-contained character, consisting of three dots <strong>and no more than three dots</strong>. For example, there is no such thing as an ellipsis made up of four dots. What are the bars like on a Euro? They&rsquo;re slashed from top right to bottom left. That&rsquo;s the standard for a Euro. What&rsquo;s the definition of an ellipsis? Three dots. That&rsquo;s all there is to it. Anything more and it&rsquo;s not an ellipsis.</p>
<p>(2) The idea of breaking up the dots of an ellipsis over two lines is preposterous and inconcievable.</p>
<p>(3) When I use ellipsis in typeset material (rarely) it goes at the end of a line or as close to the end of a line as possible. Usually I use an emdash instead of an ellipsis because ellipsis has become a typographic cliché thanks to the internet and message boards.</p>
<p>(4) If my editor or other seniors question the way I use ellipsis, or the fact I&rsquo;ve replaced it with an emdash I tell them emphatically &ldquo;It&rsquo;s just common sense. If you don&rsquo;t agree, sack me.&rdquo; Nobody has ever sacked me for it. I always get my way becaws it&rsquo;s very easy to demonstrate why breaking the thing up or putting it on the next line when it clearly belongs at the end of the previous line is the most utterly senseless thing you can do with an ellipsis.</p>
<p>(5) This thread and most of its participants are firmly in the grip of Bringhurst and the Chicago Manual of Style. The rest of the world is not slave to such unimaginative and stifling typesetting manuals.</p>
<p>(4) You don&rsquo;t put a period or a comma or any other form of dot-like punctuation after an ellipsis. What are you guys, nuts? An ellipsis is equivelant to a period. At the end of a sentence it indicates that the sentence continues. It&rsquo;s common sense that if the sentence continues, there is no need for a period, no earthly reason for putting one there. Replace the ellipsis with an emdash&mdash;now put a period after the emdash. No-no-no! Common sense. It doesn&rsquo;t belong there because the dash indicates the sentence continues. So why would you do that to an ellipsis? Doesn&rsquo;t make sense.</p>
<p>(5) Breaking the ellipsis up over two lines by typing it manually with periods and spaces is like taking an emdash and breaking that across two lines, or breaking an ampersand over two lines. Inconcievable! That makes no sense to me at all. I know, I know, I&rsquo;ve covered this point twice. I did that on purpose because <em>I&rsquo;m having trouble believing</em> that anyone calling themself a typographer, let alone a professional typographer or typesetter, would break an ellipsis over two lines for spacing reasons. Makes no sense to me at all and is the kind of boring pedantic act I would never contemplate.</p>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>Well James thanks for YOUR take on things but I work in book publishing where editors don&rsquo;t take too kindly to &ldquo;my way or the highway&rdquo;. Chicago and Bringhurst are designed to set up common styles and conventions in typesetting that make it clear TO THE READER what is going on. If you want to reinvent punctuation, be my guest, but don&rsquo;t expect your readers to thank you. If you&rsquo;re designing a poster for a rock festival or a contemporary art exhibition, then sure, play around with punctuation, but if you&rsquo;re typesetting a novel for folks to read, creating your own punctuation styles will only confuse, distract, and annoy your readers (yeah, I used the serial comma there. That&rsquo;s in Chicago too; I don&rsquo;t like it but my editors insist on it).</p>
<p>An ellipsis has a VERY different function editorially than an em-dash. The function of an ellipsis is to indicate omission in cited text. Yes, it is used as well to indicate a pause or hesitation in thought or trailing off, but those are not its primary function. In those latter cases it could perhaps be replaced with another character. But in its primary function it must be used as is. It should NEVER be broken over two lines as you&rsquo;ve said. And you are right that the punctuation (period, comma) should precede not follow it.</p>

<p>You&rsquo;re right that it makes the parsing more difficult, so that&rsquo;s a pretty good point. But the space between the last word and the first dot should give it away: no space means the first dot&rsquo;s a period, space means it&rsquo;s the beginning of an ellipsis.

<p>[[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_(punctuation)#Table_of_spaces]]</p>
<p>Especially the &ldquo;thin space,&rdquo; &ldquo;hair space,&rdquo; and &ldquo;narrow no-break space.&rdquo; However, in Word, none of these break.</p>
<p>In TNR, &ldquo;thin-space&rdquo; is the same width as &ldquo;narrow no-break space,&rdquo; and using combinations of these and periods may be a viable solution.</p>
<p>Part of the problem is that there are so many ways to create the ellipses.</p>
<p>InDesign has a character format setting that can specify &ldquo;do not break.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Looking at eliason&rsquo;s post above, for PERIOD THEN ELLIPSIS it would seem allowable to allow a linebreak after the period/before the ellipsis, but for ELLIPSIS THEN PERIOD, to my eye, any line break at all doesn&rsquo;t work, including before the ellipsis.</p>
<p>Also there is a discrepancy (in response to Charles_E): in newer fonts, the non-breaking space is exactly the same width as the regular space, but in many &ldquo;older&rdquo; (in Internet years) fonts it is an en-space. The unicode definition calls for the nb space to be the same width as regular space.</p>
<p>The advantage of using some type of space rather than a precomposed glyph is that your paragraph composer (human or programmed) could squeeze or stretch the ellipsis along with the rest of the line.</p>
<p>But of course if there is no ellipsis in the font many will complain &hellip;</p>

<p>Yes, but that assumes that as the reader you know what editorial convention the editor has used. I still think it is clearer to make the spacing between the ellipsis and any periods slightly bigger (or smaller) than the spacing between dots in the ellipsis (if you insist on using them at all). I prefer to simply use the ellipsis character, even if I am connecting parts of a quote that ran over two sentences. I think the alternative can be at best ugly, and at worst confusing for the reader.</p>

<p>1.) Chicago does have a simple three dot only ellipsis method, which is appropriate for many projects.</p>

<p>3.) Chicago may have not set their own book with the best examples of spacing, which clouds and confuses the ideas.</p>
<p>4.) Fonts built with an ellipsis character that works in harmony (equal interior spaces) with ending punctuation offer those without the software and those in search of an automated approach a good option. (See &ldquo;Granpa&rdquo; lol example above.)</p>

<p>For editorial style, it&rsquo;s still not uncommon to see the ellipsis placed in brackets for quotes, especially when the source text might include ellipses (and often times italicised):</p>
<p>Original text: So… I went down to the big blue store.
Quoted: “So… I went down to the […] store”.</p>
<p>This often comes up in quoting poetry.</p>
<p>If the distinction between period-ellipsis, and ellipsis-period is critical to the discussion of a text, I think most article authors would prefer to split the quotation even if it&rsquo;s as simple as “and later states”:</p>
<p>Original text: Alabama is in the Deep South.  Long ago, the North invaded the South because the South broke away desiring stronger state’s rights.
Article text: Matthew notes that “Alabama is in the Deep South”, and adds that the Northern Invasion, where “the North invaded the South” happened in 1861.</p>
<p>Note that even in this case the punctuation is ambiguous, because I would still quote it as “Alabama is in the Deep South” + comma even if the original sentence were “Alabama is in the Deep South of the United States of America.”</p>
<p>So, I don&rsquo;t think it’s a huge issue being able to distinguish the order in a period-ellipsis or ellipsis-period combination.  I do feel it’s important that they can be connected with no visual break between the four dots.</p>

<p>I have never sought to reinvent punctuation, only to keep it simple. Why do you assume bad faith regarding my methods (why else would you type in capitals)? The way I handle ellipsis is aimed at making it clear to the reader what is going on in a text.</p>
<p><em>&hellip;if you’re typesetting a novel for folks to read, creating your own punctuation styles will only confuse, distract, and annoy your readers.</em></p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve not done novels or story anthologies, but for jobs where I&rsquo;ve set prose fiction including dialog with ellipses and emdashes I quizz readers about the clarity of the typesetting. It turns out very few readers are even aware of any difference between ellipsis and emdash. For dialog the two marks have much the same effect and meaning as far as readers can tell.</p>
<p><em>An ellipsis has a VERY different function editorially than an em-dash. The function of an ellipsis is to indicate omission in cited text. Yes, it is used as well to indicate a pause or hesitation in thought or trailing off, but those are not its primary function.

<p>Why is ellipsis only supposed to be used to indicate omission in cited text? What about omission in other kinds of text? And if that&rsquo;s the editorial function of an ellipse, please define the editorial function of an emdash.</p>

<p>I love all of the characters in the Latin alphabet. It could be improved a great deal however, if only the world would allow type designers to do so.</p>

		<div class="commentbody">I hope you guys don&rsquo;t mind me reviving this interesting oldie, but I have to add that it seems quite US-centric. To add an international perspective: Putting spaces of any kind into the 3 dot sequence is not commonly done over here – I would say not in continental Europe, but at least not in Switzerland. Perhaps as a consequence, the unspaced &ldquo;&hellip;&rdquo; sequence does not usually seem too tight to me. 
So there is a cultural aspect to this, and one interesting thing that follows is that ellipses in American-designed fonts often seem looser to me than the ones in European fonts, and sometimes distractingly loose. When designing for an international market these regional differences might be interesting to consider.</div>

I saw what appears to be three dots on one key at a linotype keyboard (see <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/atoach/5944029870/">http://www.flickr.com/photos/atoach/5944029870/</a>, bottom right) &ndash; but cannot say if that key is really for typing an ellipsis character (it has a different shape than the other keys).</div>

		<div class="commentbody"><p>First of all, I don’t think that’s a Linotype keyboard. Looks more like Monotype, and (as someone already pointed out there) it has a Monotype label.</p>
<p>Secondly, I believe that key is for a three-dot leader. If you look at the same position in the left hand compartment, below the period, you’ll also see a two-dot leader.</p>
<p>I suppose a three-dot leader (presumably three-to-em) could have been used in place of an ellipsis — I don’t know if that was common practice in Monotype composition or not. If so, then I suppose I’ll have to stand corrected.</p>

		<div class="commentbody">Kent, thanks for the idea with the dot leader (and for being with me helping revive “this interesting oldie”, as Nina put it above [back in 2010!]). Somewhere I came across this already, but I did not see its significance then. Maybe part of the aversion against using the ellipsis character is connected with the wideness of an em-wide dot leader that had been used on Monotype machines to avoid manual spacing (and several keystrokes). This makes sense, also when comparing different printed matter from the late 19th and early 20th century, where books with Monotype mentioned in the imprint do feature exceptionally wide ellipsis marks. I have yet to check that again, but wanted to share that possible connection between dot leaders and ellipses – or, rather, this confusion in the representation of two different functions.</div>

		<div class="commentbody">Speaking of two-dot ellipses, that is not a completely new idea. 
German poet <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stefan_George">Stefan George</a> used that at the turn to the 20th century to distinguish his way of keeping his verse open in a more “closed” way, famously mocked by Theodor W. Adorno in his essay “Satzzeichen”. 
A digitised version of the font George had made in order to keep his poetry in line with his stylized “handwriting”, and including a two-dot ellipsis, is available <a href="http://www.textkritik.de/technik/stefan_george_schrift_engl.htm">from the Institut für Textkritik, Heidelberg</a> (and another one, with serious flaws, from <a href="http://www.p22.com/ihof/stgschrift.html">IHOF/P22</a>, for a discussion of said flaws, see <a href="http://www.textkritik.de/schriftundcharakter/sundc020george.htm">my critique [German]</a>) .</div>
