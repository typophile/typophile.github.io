    being cloned by SoftMaker as "G832 Sans One" and "G832 Sans Two" respectively,
    and each of these two are coming in the styles of regular and italic; both font
    names are appearing on "MegaFont XXL 3.0" and "infiniType 4" - both premium-quality
    typeface collections from SoftMaker - being released around May 27, 2014.

  body: Rats! I knew the three seven wasn&#39;t quite it, but the closest I was able
    to find was the <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/bitstream/gothic-no-13/gothic-no-13/testdrive.html?s=POEMS+EZRA+POUND+VORTEX&amp;p=48">Gothic  13</a>.
    Score a point for Magnus on a particularly subtle id.
