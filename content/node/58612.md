  ineffective? I've tested the search function by typing in keywords from my own posts
  and even these have yielded zero results.\r\n\r\nAnd, yes, I searched to see if
  anyone else had problems with the search function, but the lack of results only
  reinforced my concern.\r\n\r\nThanks."

    told me there were no results. What gives?\r\n\r\n"

    Apologies for leaving it broken for so long. Some bugs are more tenacious than
    others.\r\n"

    no results. For example, Typophile search returns no results for \u201Cdiacritic\u201D
    but Google returns 156 results for \u201Cdiacritic site:typophile.com\u201D."

    when did typophile require four letter words!? :-) '
