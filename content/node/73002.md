  it could possibly be? I don\u2019t know if you are familiar with the DIN 16518 classification
  http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/DIN_16518 or/and any other ones? Are they any good
  anyhow? How would you describe this attached one? I am tending to come up with something
  like \"Serifenlose  Klassizistische Antiqua\" which could be translated as serifless
  neo-classical antiqua. :)\r\nThanks!\r\n/T\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Example_5869.gif]"

    not until the work is complete.\r\n\r\nThe old DIN classification would probably
    throw this into the \xBBAntiqua-Varianten\xAB pot;\r\nin German, you could indeed
    call it a serifenlose klassizistische Antiqua\r\n\r\nThis might be of interest
    to you:\r\n\r\nhttp://www.typolexikon.de/s/index.html   >see \xBBSchriftklassifikation\xAB\r\n\r\nIt
    looks good btw!"
