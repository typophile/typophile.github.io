  Lightline</a> LET with some edits to the \"e\", etc.  The \"9\" and \"s\" are different
  though...\r\n\r\nAnybody recognize a closer match?\r\n\r\nMuchos gracias, in advance!\r\n"

  body: "I don't see a 'g' in your sample. Am I missing something? The 's' is an alternate
    character in the font. The 'e' looks like it might have been made from rotating
    and clipping the 'e' from the font. (Or based on the 'c' with some editing.)\r\n\r\n-

  body: "I have another explanation. I just looked in the booklet for a more than
    12-year old ClickArt collection of fonts, and there is one called 'Gaston', which
    looks exactly like your sample -- upright 's' and tilted 'e' and all. It was apparently
    a common practice to revamp one or two characters when 'borrowing' an existing
    design, and that seems to be the case here. Often these old fonts have a way of
    floating around on the web too.\r\n\r\n- Mike Yanega"

    nine in \"1973\" is really just <a href=\"http://www.bayfonts.com/images/fonts/large/GASTN___.jpg\">an
    inverted six</a>.\r\n\r\nYou all, as always, are amazing."

    <a href=\"http://www.searchfreefonts.com/fonts/z3.htm\">Zelda</a>.  The nine is
    correct too.\r\n\r\nYou're spot on though Mike. There sure is a bunch of copycat
    fonts!  We found three that would have worked in this thread alone.\r\n\r\nRegardless,
    you fellas are lifesavers -- and thanks again for the help and suggestions."
