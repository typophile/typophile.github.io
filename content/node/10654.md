body: I&#39;m looking for the ecco footwear logo-font. I&#39;m not sure it even exists,
  but if so I would like to know the name of it. House Ind. Chalet New York 1970,
  is a bit similar but without the &#34;stencil&#34; thing going on... Anyone? <BR>

  body: Nope, sorry. This <i>must</i> be a custom logo, and at the top of my shiny
    head I can&#39;t think of a commercially available typeface that looks like it.
    Maybe you can find something amongst the techno fonts at <a href="http://www.t26.com/"
    target="_blank"> T.26</a>? <BR> <BR>There&#39;s no relation at all, mind you,
    but the line quality immediately made me think of <a href="http://www.philsfonts.com/detail.html?sku=FF00707501P1"
    target="_blank"> FF Yokkmokk</a>, which must be one of the whackiest conceptual
    type designs ever.

  body: Nah, it doesn&#39;t look like you&#39;ll find it at T.26. I did a quick check
    and couldn&#39;t find any matches.

  body: It&#39;s not a match, but maybe you missed <a href="http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/t26/crisafulli/light/testdrive.html?s=ecco&amp;p=96&amp;refby=typographica"
    target="_blank">Crisafulli</a>, Yves. <BR>But it looks like it was drawn with
    a stencil and a <a href="http://www.typophile.com/forums/messages/83/3221.html"
    target="_blank">Speedball</a>, <BR>whereas the Ecco logo is clearly digital in
    origin.

  body: Thanks for the respond. In the mean time i&#39;ve been working with the Chalet,
    trying to make a match. It&#39;s still in the sketch-fase, but perhaps you would
    be so kind to let me know if you think my work is worth it. <BR> <BR> <BR><img

    same and make some more off that <BR>old design.

  body: Stephen, I missed Crisafulli because I didn&#39;t go through the &#34;Retro&#34;
    section at T.26 while searching for a match, as the sample didn&#39;t look very
    &#34;retro&#34; to me. The classifications/type categories at T.26 suck big time.
