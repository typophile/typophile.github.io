body: Last I heard, Phil&#39;s Fonts couldn&#39;t sell Josh Darden&#39;s very interesting
  new &#39;face, Freight, due to legal issues. Josh is silent. And Garage Fonts won&#39;t
  say a word about it, either &#40;although you can find their old pages with a Google
  search&#41;.  <BR> <BR>Anyone have scoop on the hold up of this release? After all,
  I got a fever for the flavor of a Freight type family!

    my Type Lust cloud my logic. <BR> <BR>Guess I was just curious to know details.
    I&#39;d have gotten away with it, too, if it wasn&#39;t for you meddling kids

    are anxiously awaiting Freight. It basically said the problems are almost solved.
