  body: Nina - for now, the tagging happens when you create/edit the post. Admins
    have the ability to go in and add tags to existing posts, and we are doing this
    slowly. We are hoping in the future to include a way for all users to tag outside
    of edit mode (Flickr style perhaps), but don't yet have the solution for this.
