body: "Hi Everyone\r\n\r\nI am looking for examples of contemporary serifs. \r\n\r\nIs
  there something like that? Would it simply mean serifs developed in the last couple
  of years, or is there something distinctly different about the design, the style
  of the characters? I have been looking at Fedra Serif, Mrs Eaves, Farnham even some
  slab fonts like FS Clerkenwell. Are they seen as contemporary? Or is there something
  else I'm missing.\r\n\r\nBest\r\nGustav "

    design of the recent years. Typical, for example, of the outcomes of Reading and
    evident in the distinction between TheSerif and TheAntiqua by Luc(as) De Groot."

    well refined piece of work. Congratulations. \r\n\r\nFrom this list the design
    that surprised me the most was definately Vesper and Premiera.. Truly beautiful
    typefaces,...and dare I say, contemporary.\r\n\r\nNick please tell me more...\r\n\r\n"

    serifs.\r\nSo convex-on-on-the-bottom, sharp-on-the-sides is a new idea.\r\n\r\nBeaufort:
    the serifs have an (almost) asymptotic construction, so that they are very sharp
    at any size, without optical scaling:\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Beauf_4701.png]\r\n\r\nThese
    ideas may or may not be particularly useful typographically, but they are contemporary
    in a way that decorative serif styling is not."
