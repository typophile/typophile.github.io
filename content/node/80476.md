  of Helvetica Neue for titles and Adobe Garamond Pro, for body text.\r\n\r\nMost
  of the people receive the PDF and read it online. Most of the readers are 50/60
  years old psychologists, philosophers or social studies related professions. So
  i wonder if 12 pt/14 pt leading, for reading from a screen is to consider big/clear
  enough. Most text are many pages long. \r\n\r\nBesides that, i would like to know
  what other font would you recommend for reading large texts on a PDF from a computer
  screen? Is the 12 pt ok? Lines are 80 characters long. Here is an example by the
  way.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThanks for any info!\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/11_4404.png]"

    to the width of their screen, if they like.\r\n\r\nI'm by no means an expert,
    but wouldn't a sans serif font work better for screen reading purposes?"

  body: "hi vilbel, thanks for the suggestion. Regarding San Serif or Serif for screen
    reading is something i am not quite clear either. Some website for example have
    great samples of Serif font like\r\n\r\nhttp://www.newyorker.com/\r\n\r\nbut other
    has done quite good with Sans Serif like\r\nhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\nS"

  body: I prefer to read Sans Serif when it's the body text. It's easier on my eyes,
    especially above 12 pt font. If you can, try and see if you can do a few tests
    with both a serif and san serif font with users.
