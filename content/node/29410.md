body: "I have a file where I've set up two numbering sequences: roman numerals for
  front matter, then arabic numerals for the main content. The numbering sequences
  are working fine in the file (that is, the auto-page-number changes where it should),
  but something funky's going on with my Pages palette.\r\n\r\nIn CS everything is
  fine: the numbers beneath the spread icons appear as they should, first as roman
  numerals (i-x), then as regular arabic (starting at 1). But in CS2, all of the numbers
  appear in arabic numbers, showing no difference between roman and regular, and the
  sequence starts at page 1 and does not begin again on page 11.\r\n\r\nAnd it's not
  just this file, it's ANY file I open OR create in CS2.\r\n\r\n[img:sites/default/files/old-images/Pages-palette_4882.gif]"

    most obvious place?
