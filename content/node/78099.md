body: "Eng or engma (majuscule: \u014A, minuscule: \u014B) is a letter of the Latin
  alphabet, used to represent a velar nasal (as in English singing) in the written
  form of some languages and in the International Phonetic Alphabet.\r\nLowercase
  eng is derived from n with the addition of a hook to the right leg, somewhat like
  that of j. The uppercase has two variants: it can be based on the usual uppercase
  N, with a hook added (or \"N-form\"); or it can be an enlarged version of the lowercase
  (or \"n-form\"). The former is preferred in Sami languages that use it, the latter
  in African languages.\r\nEarly printers, lacking a specific glyph for eng, sometimes
  approximated it by rotating a capital G, or by substituting a Greek eta (\u03B7)
  for it.\r\n\r\n<strong>Typophile Threads:</strong>\r\n<a href=\"http://typophile.com/node/21243\">What
